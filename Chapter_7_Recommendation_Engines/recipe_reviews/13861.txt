I cooked the hens whole instead of cutting in half because I liked the look of serving a whole hen to my company. Worked out fine and they were delicious. I accidentally mixed the salt and pepper in with the honey, but it didn't seem to matter. It was hard to get the honey mixture to spread onto the hens so I actually stuck them in the oven for 3 minutes to get the skin dryer and warmer and that helped.

I added about a Tablesppon of fresh crushed garlic and it gave it such a kick that the 2 hens I made were not enough and most of my other dishes were over looked because they all wanted more of the hens! ADD FRESH GARLIC, YOU WONT REGRET IT!

We served this recipe at a retirement party and everyone enjoyed it.  We cooked 16 cornish that night! They were easy to make and required only a little attention during cooking.

Wow!  This was so great!  The only change I made was to reserve about half of the sauce to coat the hens again right before serving.  The ingredients may sound like a strange combination, but the flavor is just amazing.  I'm going to try using this over chicken next time.  Wonderful recipe!

Excellent Hens with wonderful rich flavor. Note: I brined the hens first in salt water for about 2 hours to increase the flavor and did add a bit of poppy seed dressing to the honey poppy mix. These were very tasty!!!

I was a little doubtful during the prepping of the hens because the honey mixture didn't exactly brush on.  But the end result is beautiful!  The hens are just bursting with juice and the honey mix gave the meat just enough flavor to not over power the natural flavor, and still make it taste good (I can't stand poultry plain)  Thank you!!

I fixed these for dinner tonight and they were delicious!  Ok, I did make a couple of changes: I added the pepper to the mix instead of sprinkling directly on the hens. I omitted the poppy seeds because I didn't have any and instead added about a teaspoon of chilli powder. I also omitted the salt, as I do with many recipes, for a more sodium-conscious diet. Results...absolutely amazing! Beautifully roasted, crispy and moist. The honey and chilli powder married nicely for just the right amount of sweetness and kick! I can't wait to make this again! (7/1/12)

UPDATE:

Well, I've made these a few times since my initial review and I must say, they never fail.  This is a five-star recipe! If I coukd afford it, I would make these every week! They always turn out wonderfully and sssooo delicious!

A couple of times on special occasions, I've done another reviewer suggested and cooked them whole. (I added a little more time and checked for doneness.) They present so well, and each guest enjoyed that they had their own little hen! (Most ate half and carried the rest home another meal. Of course, I could only do this with a small dinner party.  Usually, I still cut them in half, cook and serve.) (6/5/16)

I love to cook, but because I'm a student, I can't spend as much time as I'd like preparing food.  However, this recipe was delicious and it was SO EASY--it took under ten minutes to prepare!  The only thing I did differently was to put some fresh herbs in between the skin and the meat while cooking.  I'll definitely make this again :)

I made some modification to this recipe since there is a diabetic from one of my friend. I cut honey to one-third only and still came out perfect! Delicious hens.

I've started thinking of this recipe as the "we've been in a relationship for a year and I wish he would propose so I'm going to make this for him" recipe.  So delicious!

It came out looking beautiful, it was juicy and moist, but it was, well, gamey.  Not impressed.  I guess if you like gamey meats this recipe is for you,  I nor my boyfriend enjoyed this.

I made this a few nights ago and it was so yummy. My husband loved it.  It was my first time cooking a hen and I was pleased it turned out so well.  We even made the marinate again and used it on chicken, which was also great.  I did add some garlic as others suggested and it really hit the spot.

The flavor on the outside of the bird was great, but it didn't seem to get inside. Maybe I did something wrong.

I am giving this recipes five stars because it was truly delicious! The only change I made was instead of honey, I used maple syrup..kind of a big change, but I was out of honey. I believe, however, that this would be just as good with honey!

The maple glazed my hen perfectly, and it browned beautifully!

MMmmm

This was amazing.  I dare say, my favorite way to eat a little chicken.  It was so good, that I suggest trying this on grilled chicken.  I ate the whole hen, a first for me.  Thank you, we will make this again soon.

This recipe was awesome!  My family loved it and has requested it several times.  The only thing I did different, was the seasoning of the hens just before baking them.  I added some season salt and pepper.  

Yummy!!!!!

This is the second time made this , this time around I doubled the honey sauce  recipe , I then microwaved it for 25 seconds to soften the honey to make it stir easier , I then cut hens in half and dried with paper towel , I then spread the pepper salt mix ( this time around I used fresh cracked peppercorns and pink Himalayan salt to boost flavor ) , with the birds bring dried off I then took a dipping spoon/1 table spoon ladle  and applied the honey mixture being it was semi viscous and it coated the hens very nicely with them being dryer it stuck like glue right where I wanted it to be.                               I then put in pan applied salt pepper again  to the bottom side and then applied honey mix and put in the convection oven at 350 for an hour turning once in between , this time it was way gooder !

This sauce is delicious. The hens turned out great. Had to use bottled dijon because I thought I had powdered mustard on hand, but didn't. Will be putting this sauce on my spiral sliced Christmas ham.

I had high hopes for this recipe,  but it was really very bland.  It definitely needs some sort of added seasoning.

This is just so easy and turns out consistently awesome hens! One of my go-to recipes for game hens!

Okay. These are actually cooking now. I tweaked the glaze a bit. Used a tablespoon of prepared Dijon because I didn't have dry mustard. I also added two small cloves of smooshed garlic...because... well, garlic! The glaze tasted delicious. And these are smelling wonderful cooking. I am cooking them whole cuz I didn't have a pan big enough to hold 3 of them cut in half. I'm also cooking them on 375 degrees for an hour because that was suggested on the hen bag. Serving with white and wild rice (a mix) and green beans.

I added a teaspoon of minced garlic. And switched mustard powder for curry powder.

Bland.  I even added more ginger than was called for.

I added chopped garlic and crushed red pepper but found it still needed more flavor.  If I make this again I will double the recipe and baste the hens.

I read the other reviews and doubled the glaze; glad I did, it would not have been enough otherwise. I brushed on the glaze at the beginning and again when I turned them skin side up.  Had just enough left to brush on for the final minutes.
I used what I had on hand, cane patch syrup instead of honey, flax seed instead of poppy seed, and I doubled the seeds and the ginger (so really quadrupled the seeds and ginger!) and it was perfect!  Excellent flavor!
Time and temperature were just right! :)  I made sweet potatoes with butter, clove, cinnamon and sugar; went well with the hens.

This was great! I've always wanted to try game hens, and found them at a great price. These turned out SO good.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and my husband and I didn't care for it. The sweetness took away from the flavor of the hens and the poppy seeds made a real mess on your plate, fingers and teeth.

It was just ok for me. They didnt get crispy like i wanted them to. But the sauce was pretty good.

Great for a dinner party.  The chicken was good, but perhaps lacking a bit of salt and flavor.  But a very good basic chicken recipe.

This was pretty awful.  The basting mix is so wet that the skin was soggy--not crisp at all.  The Cornish Hen seemed "stewed," not roasted.

Juicy, but too sweet and not very flavorful (for my tastes).
