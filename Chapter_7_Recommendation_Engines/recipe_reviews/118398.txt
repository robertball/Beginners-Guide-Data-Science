I made the recipe as is at first, it was nice and had a little zing to it from the lemon. I made a second batch with olive oil and mixed it together. I like it best when mixed but can/will use just lemon juice in the future. It's a nice, small change to regular pesto.

I thought this was an excellent alternative to oily pesto.  The only thing I changed was to use parmesan instead of romano (since that's what I had on hand), and added about 1/4 cup water to thin it out a little.  I sprinkled mine with crushed red pepper flakes.  Yummy!

Delish pesto that's low fat, awesome! I subbed parmesan for romano, spinach for basil, and almonds for walnuts because that's what I had on hand... and drizzed in a couple tablespoons of olive oil. I served it over tortellini first then used the leftover in the "pesto cheesy chicken rolls" recipe on this site.

I really liked the flavor of this, and it's nice to have pesto without all of the fat. Next time I will try it with pine nuts and add some spinach.

I am giving this 5 stars for being a very very good light pesto recipe.  I slightly prefer regular pesto with the oil in it, but this really tasted quite close to the "real" thing.  I used fresh lemon juice when I made this and instead of serving with pasta, I stuffed it in chicken and baked it.  Thanks for this great recipe!

WOW...I kept reminding myself that there was no oil! I will be making this a lot! I made the pesto the day before and added some pasta water to thin it out a bit. Great recipe!!

This is a great pesto recipe - I don't even miss the olive oil. I added a few leftover sun dried tomatoes and instead of pasta, I tossed this with grilled chicken. VERY good!

This is very zesty, definitely not your traditional pesto. If you are looking for a real pesto recipe, this is NOT it. It has a strange "kick" to it, and even though I love lemon I was a bit overwhelmed by the citrus. I did add a bit of olive oil after tasting it because it REALLY needed it for flavor and to make it stick to the pasta. As a regular recipe I would give this maybe 2 stars, but I am so thrilled to have a lower fat way to make pesto that I am giving it 3 stars. I might make this again, but I would DEFINITELY cut the lemon in half and add a bit of olive oil. Plus pesto should really be made with parmesan cheese and pine nuts, so next time I may make those substitutions as well.

It was ok given how it is much lower in fat than regular Pesto. But the lemon flavor overwhelmed for me.

I used a combination of pine nuts and Brazil nuts and also added 2 sundried tomatoes. The taste was outstanding. I love how light and fresh this pesto is. I will never go back to the oily stuff again! Thanks!

Delicious!! I used feta instead of Romano, and a few leaves of baby spinach since I didn't have a ton of basil leaves on my plants.  I think we liked it even better than the pesto recipes with all the oil in them!

I was looking for a lighter recipe to satisfy my wife"s pesto cravings.  I'm glad I found this one.  This is absolutely incredible with seafood!  We just tossed it with whole wheat angel hair pasta and threw in some freshly boiled shrimp.  A super-easy weeknight "gourmet" meal!  Thanks!!

I love how this recipe reduces the fat AND tastes really fresh.  It's great with basil, but is also good with arugula or arugula/kale combined (I get lots of both from CSA, so I'll make this and freeze it).  I make just a few modifications per my own taste... only 3-4 cloves of garlic, only 2 oz. parmesano reggiano (instead of the romano), and add about 1T. olive oil for richness and consistency.

Wow! Was this ever delicious and mostly healthy. I threw in some extra garlic, spinach and one roasted red pepper. When tossing it with the spaghetti, I added just a tsp of olive oil so it served better. Will definitely make this again, and again!
