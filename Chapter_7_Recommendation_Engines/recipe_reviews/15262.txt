I made twenty of these for gifts - and they look so nice, I'm not sure if I'm going to actually hand them out! For the cooking novice, note that 5/8 Cup = 1/2 Cup plus 2 T.

The taste of this cookie is outstanding, but I only gave 4 stars because of the prep.  You really can't mix butter with egg, it curdles.  That's just not how cookies are made.  I ruined a whole batch the first time.  Next time, I layered all the ingredients as stated, except the sugars.  I put them in a small zip bag and put them on top of everything.  I changed the recipe card so that you cream the butter with the sugar package, then add the egg.  Turned out like a normal cookie dough that way.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was my first attempt at making a jar cookie.  I just made 16 jars to give as gifts.  I did try the recipe out first and it is good. It is a dry dough but bakes up soft. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead, I think they made them a bit salty, so I reduced the salt a bit.  I wanted my jars to look fuller. So I layered the ingredients this way, bottom to top, brown sugar, white sugar, flour, nuts, chips, berries, oats, flour, soda, salt.  Also just a note for anyone planning on making a bunch. 12 jars used: 5 lbs flour, 2 lbs oats, 1.5 pkg of brown sugar (32 oz) and 4 pkg chips (12 oz).  I bought the nuts in bulk and bought way too may.  Next time I think I will take my measuring cup to the store.

This was a great gift to give and it tasted wonderful as well! To prevent the brown sugar from hardening I mixed the brown and white sugars together before adding them to the jar.  They stayed soft over a week before they were made.  Another reviewer stated that egg and butter couldn't be creamed so she put the sugar in a packet.  Egg and butter CAN be creamed - it just won't look the same as when you cream butter and sugar.  It will look how egg and butter look together. Follow the recipe's original directions and you should get a great cookie!

Great recipe!  I make them all the time.  I just do two things differently when I make them as jar mixes:  use Domino Brownulated Sugar to avoid having the sugar get hard in the jar, and stick a small crumbled-up piece of wax paper in the top to avoid having the ingredients move around (since the recipe doesn't completely fill the jar.)  I cover the top with a small piece of patterned cloth and tie with a ribbon, and you can't see the wax paper.

I love this recipe!!!  Tastes great, awesome textures, and it looks SO pretty in the jar with the bright red cranberries!  I printed out the baking directions on cardstock and tied it to the mason jar with rafia.  Taking the advice of another reviewer, I changed the name to "Cranberries in the Snow"...sounds more appropriate for the holidays and actually resembles it's name!  Two suggestions, DO NOT pack down the ingedients as some other recipes in a jar require.  This recipe fits in the jar just as it's poured in.  Also, using a wide-mouth jar and a cone made out of paper helps kids (and adults alike) get it all in without any mess.  Oh, used 7 grain flakes 'cause that's what I had, and walnuts instead of pecans (cheaper) and it tasted great! Will make this to give as gifts every year!

The kids loved making these and they were super easy for them  to assemble.  I switched the layers around so that the more colorful ingredients were at the bottom of the jar.  The nuts, white choc chips and cranberries were at the bottom,  then I packed the brown sugar and layered the remaining ingredients on top. The holiday fabric that I topped the jars with covered the flour mixture and all the "prettier" stuff was at the bottom and nothing seeped through the brown sugar.

I have given cookies in a jar as Christmas gifts for 3 years now and have searched through dozens of recipes to find one better than the last.  I have yet to find one better than this.  I made 100 of them last year and people are STILL raving about them!  They taste wonderful and look very festive in the jars.

Great cookie, my husband liked them bette when I rolled them into balls instead of dropping them by spoonfuls.  Also, I found the mix did not fill a one liter jar, so I altered it to serve 24, fits perfectly.

I made these cookies based on all the great reviews, and I must agree!!  They were very easy and fast to mix.  As great as they were, I love really vibrant flavors, so I will probably take the time to find UNsweetened dried cranberries next time, and will probably add a lot more than the recipe calls for. I'm just waiting for an excuse to give this mix to someone in a jar, as intended!

Good cookie.  I tripled the recipe for a cookie exchange and baked (did not fill jars.)

To recap the previous wisdom from you all, I agree it is best to:

1.  Cream the butter, vanilla and sugars first, then add egg.  I used an electric beater and it worked fine.
2.  Mix this dough with your hands, as suggested before - much easier on the arms than a spoon.
3.  Sprinkle a few drops of water on the batter if it seems too dry to mix - really helps.
4.  Flatten the cookie slightly before cooking.
5. I had best results using a Silpat - the trays with oil burned the edges too much.
6. Mine also needed extra cooking time - 12 mins average.
7.  Next time I make these, I will add more white choco chips.
8. Craisins help add extra sweetness.
9. The recipe does not say to pack the brown sugar, so I didn't...next time I think I will add a little more.
10. Next time I won't chop the pecans as finely but let them be lumps.

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars....I took the advice of another reviewer and kept the sugars separate. However, on my second jar I forgot to separate, so I ended up making a batch for myself. These are the BEST cookies in the entire world, period. They're so much more than I ever imagined a cookie could be!

I made 10 or so of these for family & friends this year.  The ingredients perfectly filled a quart size jar. They are very festive with holiday paper in the lid and the recipe card attached with nice ribbon (see photo).  This got rave reviews from all who saw them.

You should definitely modify the directions to increase the baking time according to your own oven and note they should NOT be baked on stoneware.  These cookies really aren't that sweet - add sugar if you want a sweeter cookie. Extra cranberries and white chocolate chips really help.  These taste more like a Nature Valley Granola Bar type of treat than a decadent holiday cookie.

These were a lot of fun to make for the holidays. My little girls enjoyed helping fill the jars. We used silicone funnels to easily add the ingredients. They cut out fabric squares and ties ribbons around the top of the jars. We called them "Cranberry Cuties" instead. My sister made them from the jar we gifted her and they tasted amazing! We've made them several times since and they always get great compliments and never last long. Thanks for a great recipe.

These look great in a jar ~ no problem fitting in all the ingredients. We used them for teachers gifts. After hitting the Christmas sales where we managed to get everything 50% off, we topped the jars with fabric and tied on a miniature tree ornament (12 for $1.50) with a bow. We made up a Christmas basket of goodies with the cookies, the cookie mix, hot chocolate mix in a jar, pot holder, kitchen towel, spoon and 2 mugs ~ all for under $8.00

Amazing!  I made the recipe in the jar for my daughter's teacher and made a batch just to see how they tasted.  WOW!  I have made probably 7 batches since mid-December and have had 4 people ask for the recipe.  FYI - I got jars that were too small and had to make 2 jars for the whole recipes...make sure you get the correct size jar!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Please keep the recipient in mind. If you are sending this to a person who doesn't bake much, or is living in an environment where they don't have access to kitchen staples and equipment,they may not be able to make your gift. I think I have in mind some college student on a tight budget who hopefully has access to a cookie sheet. I have used buttermilk powder, vanilla powder and whole egg powder and they work fine. These ingredients aren't hard to find (I know King Arthur Flour's site carries them, check your store's baking and health foods aisle), you have drastically reduced the ingredients the recipient needs to add. If you do change the ingredients, be sure to remember you may need a larger container and you will have to edit the instructions to reflect your changes. Instructions should be as clear and complete as possible. Using a phrase like "prepared baking sheet" isn't helpful at all to a novice baker. Say something like "lightly grease a baking sheet with Crisco, or any cooking oil, butter, or margarine, use just enough to lightly coat the part of the sheet where the cookies will sit". Include an expiration date and where to store the gift. For example, nuts keep about a month at room temperature, a lot longer in the freezer.

Sooooo tasty!  I get way more cookies than the recipe states, but who's going to complain about that!?  I made these last year for gift, and had nearly everyone come back and ask for the recipe so thay could make them again this year.  The guys at work are figting over my last batch - they are pretty much everything you want a cookie to be!

These cookies are so addictive, I put them in the freezer to keep from eating the whole batch all at once.  That didn't help, as I discovered these cookies are chewy straight out of the freezer!  I used 1 litre jars and had to increase the recipe to 24 servings to fill the jar.  That meant changing the recipe card to 2 eggs, 2/3 cup butter and 1.5 tsp vanilla.  I followed someone else's advice and reorganized the layers:  flour, nuts (semi-sweet or milk chocolate chips if making nut-free batches), cranberries, oats, flour with baking soda and salt, brown sugar, white sugar.  This made a much prettier presentation.  If I packed it down too much, I just added a few more cranberries at the top to fill the gap.  I also experimented and slightly flattened some before baking, and spooned some without flattening...it didn't seem to make a difference, they spread the same.

Excellent! These cookies have a wonderful combination together with the cranberries, white chocolate and oats. There going to make great gifts for this year's Christmas.  I found out that you might need to bake them for a little longer than 8-10 minutes, or I made them too big.   5/8 cup = 1/2 + 2 TBS, just so you know.  Thanks for the recipe!

You can cream the butter, egg, and the vanilla!!!!!!
It will take a good 5 to 7 minutes on medium speed, and then it will cream and fluff up nice and pretty.  Be patient.  I added all of the other ingredients in a bowl first.  Stirred them all together, then stirred the ingredients into my creamed mixture.  Next I formed them into tablespoon size balls and flatten the tops with a fork.

These are wonderful.  Follow the recipe and you will not go wrong!

I will definitely give these as gifts!

These were very tasty!!  I didnt put them in a jar, just made them regularly.  For the 5/8 cup, you do 1/2 cup plus a half of a 1/4 measuring cup.  I recommend these!

Layered the ingredients in the jars for a kid's christmas craft fair, then let the kids decorate them.  Used this order: 5/8 cup flour, nuts, white chips, craisins (instead of cranberries), oats, 1/2 cup flour with the baking soda and salt, brown sugar, white sugar, then since I had some room topped off with more craisins.  Also baked sample cookies and found out that they do not spread when baking so I was able to put 20 to 24 on a cookie sheet.  Tip: be careful when buying the oats and be sure to get the "old fashioned oats" not the "quick 1 minute".  I think the quick oats made the cookie dough more difficult to work with (more crumbly) although the taste didn't seem to be effected.  Very tasty cookie!

I loved these when I recieved them as a gift. I love dried cranberries and frequently use them instead of raisins in my baking.
Recently, I substituted dried raspberries in this recipe and they were excellent.
Also, I have used cinnamon chips along with the white chocolate chips  to add some more flavor....they were really good.
And, I have made these multiple times with the kids I babysit for and they just love them!!!!

When the ingredients were packed down, this recipe only filled the jar 3/4 full.  I just added more cranberries and white chocolate chips.

I followed this recipe to the letter. The presentation makes this a great gift! I wanted to verify the outcome of the cookie, just to be sure, so I made a batch for myself, following the directions exactly as they would be written for the recipient. The cookies themselves are quite good, pleasantly crisp/chewy and very flavorful! Glad I finally tried this recipe.

Great cookie recipe! When I make mine I also usually end up adding 1/2 cup of coconut flakes.

I have made this recipe numerous times and I gave it for Christmas.  One of my friends said it was the best cookie recipe she had ever had.  I had my reservations about mixing everything together in one bowl, but it turned out fine.  I now keep a mix in a ziplock back in my fridge at all times so that I can have cookies whenever the urge hits!  Just make sure that your butter is very soft.

My husband declared these cookies his all time favorite cookie!  I had to make a second batch for myself.  I cream the butter with the sugars and do everything else the same.  Mine take about 14 minutes to cook but I use a cookie scoop so maybe that is why.

I didn't change a thing, my husband rated them among the top 10 best things he has EVER had, someone else described them as heaven in a cookie and I don't care for pecans or cranberries, but these are one of my favorite things.
Great tip:  Make several batches at once for yourself, (you will want them, I did this when I knew I had 4 months of bed rest coming up and would want some of these) each batch in a ziploc bag, then when time comes to make them, add the vanilla and butter, mash up still in bag then add room temperature egg and mash again.
Taste best when making 14-16 large bulky cookies, smash them down a bit, and bake 11-13 minutes, if you take them out too soon they will look like you did something wrong and not taste good either.

I have been making layered cookie mixes in jars for a couple of years now......these are pretty to look at, as well as easy to make, and very tasty!! Just a quick note...for those of you who are not familiar with the dough that this and all cookie jar mixes make, it will be a dry crumbly dough that you roll into balls!! Don't panic when your dough turns out dry and crumbly...that is how it is supposed to be!!!

I adore this recipe, and the name——reminds me of one of my favorite Christmas movies—-Emmet Otter's All-Jug Band! :)  (The other suggested name is also cute: Cranberries in the Snow!) I haven't made these in a few years, but I am going to a cookie exchange, and quite frankly, am not a big fan of baking, but just remembered this recipe and am excited to "make" these again! The finished gift is lovely in the jar, topped with a little fabric/ribbon/raffia embellishment, and the cookies are divine, when made! Mouth is watering, as I type . . . appreciate all the great assembly/baking tips from others, too! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Great recipe!  You can easily substitute different nuts or even chocolate chips for the white chocolate depending on your taste.  We love them as they are for the holidays!

These were great! I had to make 3 batches in one night because they all kept disappearing! Now everyone wants the recipe! And the ingredients looked really cute in the jar! I put a piece of hoilday fabric on top, wrapped a ribbon around with a mini spatula attached and also attached the cooking instructions (with a little personalization from our family). It was a hit!

5/8 cup of flour? I just went with 1 cup of flour total, and 3/4 cup oats. Worked out beautifully. Omitted the pecans. Upped the cranberries and (dark) chocolate chips to 3/4 cup, to make up for the nuts. Added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg for some holiday spice. Delicious! I'll be giving a few cookies wrapped in cellophane with a pretty ribbon, in addition to the jar mix. Gotta give people a taste of what they're looking forward to!

I gave each of the girls I work with a jar of this cookie mix...they were beautiful! I made an extra one for my sister, and when my husband saw it he asked me to make one for his mom...he said, "She'll probably set it out as a Christmas decoration without making the cookies, it's so pretty." Thanks very much!

Worthy of every one of these 5 stars.  Due to a lack of cranberries, mine were actually Dates and raisin Hootycreeks (although, like a previous reviewer, I'd like to know what a Hootycreek is as well).  Whatever it is, it's yummy!!  Other than the cranberry substitution, I also subbed milk chocolate chips for the white choco chips.  Rest of recipe was made as listed and it was good.  Took a bit longer to bake.  Will definitely make again!!

The flavor was great, but every batch just kind of melted on the cookie sheet. I chilled the dough, then I tried using it at room temp, finally I scooped it into paper lined mini muffin pans. They shrunk a little in the middle so I put some more white chips on when hot and added a dried cranberry. TFS

I didn't think I would like these for myself because I'm not a fan of raisins so I figured craisins would be the same.  I was wrong, these cookies are DELICIOUS!  Thanks for a great recipe and now I am proud of the jar gifts I gave.

This is my NEW FAVORITE Christmas Cookie!  Rather than put the mix in jars, I made up a double recipe of these and, WOW, are they good!!!  A double recipe makes 5 dozen using a cookie sized ice cream scoop!

Fantastic cookie! I did change one thing, I added 3/4 cup softened butter (butter and egg can be creamed together, just looks funny) and it did wonderfully! Also, several people are concerned about the brown sugar hardening. Just cut a piece of bread (1/4) and place in the top of the jar and it will keep everything fresh and moist.

Delicious!  Here are my tips: use high-quality white chocolate.  I don't think Nestle white choc. chips are very good, so I broke a Ghirardelli white choc. bar into little bits.  That worked great.  I did follow the instructions and tried to combine the eggs and butter, and they did't get "fluffy" but it didn't seem to cause any problems either (did not "curdle" as other reviewers have feared), so I think you could do that or add the sugar at that stage.  Also, I used craisins, which are sweetened, becuase I couldn't find unsweetened dried cranberries at my store.  I think I would do this again, they weren't overly sweet.  I would cut back on the salt, though. And I also needed to sprinkle a little water on the dough to make it stick together.  I will definitely make these again!

oooo so good! I wasn't planning on baking any up, I just making up jars as christmas presents but I made the mistake of pressing down each layer so I had a big gap on top and decided to bake them up and refill the jar. I used a regular quart mason jar and layered them in this order: flour, oats, flour mix, white chips, cranberries (pack the berries when you measure), walnuts (instead of peacans - cheaper), brown sugar and white. You can also wait to put the nuts in until the end, just incase they don't want nuts. Very pretty... and oh so good. I've definately found my new favorite cookie! Update: Through travelling the jar got all mixed up.. I'd reccomend one and a halfing this recipe and pressing each layer for a more compressed fit.

AMAZING!  I made these for 2010 Christmas presents and everyone is still raving about them.  I changed the order in which the ingredients were added to make it look nicer, but other than that did not change a thing.  I will certainly be making these again next year.

Awesome.  I don't make the mix and give it though, I bake the cookies for the holidays-and they go quick!  I double the recipe, form the dough into 2 logs and store in the freezer a couple weeks in advance to make life easier during that crazy holiday baking.  And to the people who say you can't mix butter and egg-you CAN!  You need to emulsify them.  Beat eggs then add in SMALL increments , 3-4 little batches, to the creamed butter and sugar while still beating.  I never have any probs.  They are sooooooo tasty!

I don't know what I expected - but - these are really great! Rather than do them as jar gifts, I made the dough and divided it into 3 separate packages of cookie dough and stored well wrapped in the freezer. 2 were given as gifts, one I thawed & cooked Christmas Eve..they couldn't have been better.  One question??? How did the name come about? Thanks for sharing.

Just made 6 of these for teacher gifts! :)  I haven't made the cookies so I don't know how they taste but I'm rating them based on "giftableness" (I know it's not a word :) )  I skipped the nuts simply because they weren't on sale and it would have been an extra $12 or so.  But the jars turned out GREAT! Not hard to do- I used the rolled up paper idea to pour in most ingredients.  Cut out wrapping paper for the top.  Attached a print out of the recipe and an ornament and tied it up with a ribbon.  A great idea for a thoughtful gift!  Will probably do it again next year. Thanks!!!

These were wonderful gifts!! I made some of the finished cookies before hand and they were terrible! Dry and crumbly, but then I realized I had forgotten the white sugar. Made all the difference. Great tasting cookies. I took a tip from another post and layered the white sugar at the bottom and then white chips, then cranberries and then brown sugar, flour and oats. That way when you cover the top you can still see all the festive colors. I used old christmas card and glued the instructions to the back of the pictures. Made beautiful tags and didn't have to buy cardstock.

These are very tasty!  My niece, who is 13yo, made these and this was her first time baking.  She didn't really need any help with following the directions and they came out great.  The only problem was beating the butter and eggs - it didn't combine well. As suggested at another review, beat the butter,sugars and vanilla first and then add the eggs.  Will definitely keep the recipe:)

I made these cookies with my Girl Scout troop for Christmas gifts.  Except for needing to be baked on parchment, they were fantastic and easy. If you don't use parchment, the chips melt and scorch.  We plan to make them for our fall fundraiser next year!

These are very yummy and easy to make!  I made a batch with a friend (didn't assemble in a jar - just mixed a batch and baked as directed).  She liked them so much she took a few home to give to her parents.  She said they taste good warm and told EVERYONE at our women's group how good they were and they all want the recipe too!  Next time, I'll make several batches, assemble in Ball jars, add some holiday fabric, a raffia bow and directions and give as a holiday gifts to my friends.  YUM YUM!  Thanks!

I loved this recipe!! I only made a few minor changes (due to lack of funds, haha).  Instead of all pecans, I dids a pecan/walnut blend and used special holiday chips instead of white chocolate (mine were raspberry swirled and mint swirled).  Cookies came out awesome and the jars are gorgeous!  I used 12 one-quart Mason jars and all the ingredients filled up my jars to the brim.  Great recipe and gift.

I had to test these cookies out before filling the jars as gifts, and my only complaint is that they were eaten too fast!  ;-)  These are my family's new favorite cookies.  I reduced the salt to 1/4tsp, used unsalted butter, craisins instead of dried cranberries, and chopped the pecans pretty small, which I enjoyed more than having large chunks of nuts.  I rolled the dough into 1-1&1/2 inch balls, and made 32 cookies.  They cooked for 10-12 minutes, not 8 as stated.  The cookie balls can be placed closer on the cookie sheet than most other kinds of cookies because they don't expand very much.  When filling the jars, I packed the brown sugar down in the jar in hopes of it staying moist longer. Love them Hootycreeks, Susan!

I can't believe all the rave reviews which failed to mention the issue of mixing butter (oil) and egg (water). What a mess. Eventually had to mix everything together with my hands and then press the batter into patties, like hamburgers. Cookies tasted great, but I wouldn't wish this messy procedure on my friends and family, so I put the sugar in a decorative cello bag on top of the dry ingredients in the jar and amended the method to the tried and true 'cream butter and sugar together and add egg and vanilla'. Took care of the matter of the space on top, too. Kitchen chemistry, 101.

These are amazing cookies!  Even the name is wonderful.  I will be giving these jars of mix as Christmas gifts with confidence!  So tasty!  I substituted the 1/2 cup all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour to add some fiber and protein.  Yum!

The total flour in this recipe is 1 cup plus 2 TB., if you are just making them and not putting them in a jar (I have done both)  My hubby LOVES these, and he is not an adventurous eater (these I had to convince him to try, and he fell in love :)  Thanks for sharing!!

These are good cookies but they are not anything special.  I would probably make them again.  Also, since I slightly flatten my cookies before putting them in the oven they only need 7 minutes to cook.

Gave these out at a cookie exchange and most thought it was a great idea b/c they can make them later, plus they get a whole batch as opposed to just a dozen cookies.  I made a batch for myself and absolutely loved them, as did the family.  I used the brownulated sugar, which doesn't stack well in the jar so make sure it goes on the bottom.

The cookies themsleves are quite good, but I'm just ecstatic about the presentation in the jar!! Overall, a very nice cookie :) I did not have trouble filling the jar at all (used 1qt Ball smooth jar from Hobby Lobby). It was right to the top - I layerd like this: 5/8c flour, then soda & salt, oats, 1/2c flour, cranberries, choc chips, pecans, and lastly - brown & white sug combined on top. Thanks Susan for a great recipe!

These cookies are delicious!  I didn't have trouble with the dough not coming together, just mixed until everything was incorporated and instead of using a spoon to drop the cookies on the baking sheet, I formed balls by hand and flattened them slightly.  Not only is the mix beautiful when layered, but the baked cookies look gourmet!  Whether I make these to give as gifts or just to satisfy a cookie craving for my family, they are in our top 5 cookie recipes!

Wonderful cookie!  Got all wild reviews from recipients.  Very important to bake ONLY until edges start to brown; otherwise cookie gets very hard.  Will use again and again.

This was a HUGE hit at work!  My husband found beautiful festive jars at wal-mart for 2.50.  I filled up a bunch, tied with ribbon, and sent off to work.   I did separate the sugars and placed them in a ziplock bag and adjusted directions to match traditional cookie recipes.  Don't know if it affected the taste but it did help to fill up those jars a bit more since they were a little large!  People loved the look of jars and one co-worker brought in cookies to share...they were gone in a flash and people tracked me down to ask for the recipe.  Will definitely do again.

very yummy.  The butter and egg does appear curdled when mixed, but the cookies turn out wonderful.

This is a very tasty recipe!  The first time I made this recipe, I packed down each ingredient before adding another.  Unfortunately there was a lot of space left in the jar!  The key is NOT to pack the ingredients tightly.  If space remains at the top, just add more cranberries or chips.

As we say in Hawaii, these cookies are SO ONO (super delicious)!  I just made a batch today and was so overwhelmed by how wonderful they taste! Thank you for sharing this! I substituted walnuts for the pecans because I needed a little softer nut. I will be making this a pass it on gift by sharing the baked cookies and the jar ingredients asking others to make a batch and share it with their neighbors or better yet complete strangers to spark some Christmas cheer! What better way to share Jesus? :)

Pretty good.  I doubled the recipe since I'm not giving them in quart jars; I'm just baking these as part of my Christmas cookie tins. I also just made as I would usually make cookies:  mix the sugar and butter together, add in the egg and vanilla, then the flour and other ingredients with the cranberries and chips last.   I added the last of a bag of peanut butter chips and they seemed fine in this.  These are sweet, little cookies that don't spread much.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these this weekend and I think I've found a new favorite cookie!

I substituted half of the white chocolate chips with regular chocolate chips.  

I also used brown sugar coated pecans.

These are delicious and I plan to make more soon because they go fast!  

Also, these are a GREAT gift idea.  Both our mothers really enjoyed them, too.

I was looking for a cookie recipe that was not chocolate for something different.  I made a huge batch of these and another favorite recipe for family and a church function.  These are going way faster than the Peanut chocolate chip that have been a longtime favorite.  I didn't have pecans so I used some slices almonds instead.  I also added a little almond extract.  The batter is really stiff.  It gave my Kitchen Aid mixer all it wanted. I used a cookie scoop and gave them alittle smash.  I may use a little less flour next time.  Sometime I will make with pecans as that sounds good too!

These cookies are awesome.  The perfect holiday cookie and look so nice in the jar.  The egg, butter and vanilla blend well, as long as you beat it with a hand mixer, for quite a while too to make it fluffy.  This is a keeper for me and will be made over and over again. BTW, the recipe makes exactly 18 cookies.  Many, many recipes I have tried are way off on the number it will serve.

I made these as teacher gifts for my son to take to school for the holidays. I hadn't tried to recipe, I just went on the reviews of others. I had enough ingredients to make a batch for us to try after I had finished filling the jars. HOLY COW!! WHERE have these cookies been all my life? They are AMAZING and our new favorites! Thank you for posting this recipe. It is going into our personal collection to be made again and again!

I've made these cookies and these gift jars many times over the years and they are always wonderful.  Just discovered a few weeks ago that my girlfriend still had her jar from last year with the cookies unmade!  So we made them almost a year later and they turned out great.  I poured off the loose ingredients on top first into a separate bowl and tried to put just the sugars with the egg/butter.  I always use dark brown sugar and while it was a little extra firm, it eventually mixed in fine.

I used walnuts instead of pecans (taste better in my opnion). I made this for our young women church group and we gave them to the Grandmas in our church...it was a huge hit. They are seriously the BEST cookies I have ever had and everyone else says the same. What a great recipe!!! Fits perfectly in the jar too. You will want to use this one over and over. A keeper

Made these for Christmas and they were wonderful!  Very sinful, (you can taste the butter in them so I may cut back a bit on it next time) but my family went crazy for them as they're written!  Made beautiful cookie mix jars for Christmas gifts!  When making your jars, don't tamp down the ingredients as your adding them and fluff your brown sugar in a bowl before adding to the jar, and the recipe will fill your 1 quart jar very nicely!

A very tasty cookie! Not too sweet. I am giving this four stars because I mixed them up for myself, rather than following the jar recipe. I do think they would turn out alright even if you didn't cream the butter and sugar together first..

Oh .. a word of warning.  These are some highly addictive cookies. We are small business owners who usually give out approx 50 boxes of chocolates to special customers each year. As the economy has spiraled we still wanted to acknowledge our friends but couldn't really see spending the money this year. So! Decided to give cookies :)  What an incredible hit these have been.  Two comments I would make are... you can't blend butter and egg 'until fluffy' as the instructions indicate but it really doesn't matter. We just mixed the egg, softened butter and vanilla well and then added the dry ingredients. These are magnificent tasting cookies. Secondly, if you are giving out alot you might as well just include the recipe with... I have gotten request after request for the recipe.  Along those lines too.. I think if you have concerns over whether folks have nut allergies and the like this way they can see all the ingredients.  (It would be a shame to leave the nuts out if you didn't 'have' to in my humble opinion) So, enjoy these, they ARE fabulous and don't leave me alone in the kitchen with 'em

These were delicious!  Because most of my cookie sheets were tied up with other cookies, one batch was baked on stoneware and didn't turn out at all.  The rest of the batches were baked on a regular metal cookie sheet and were perfect!  Maybe the temp needs to be higher if you are baking with stoneware.

This is one recipe that I wish I could give more than 5 stars to.  The cookies turned out perfectly!  I followed it to a tee , using parchment paper to line the cookie sheet.  EASY! I didn't get 18 cookies since I made the first group pretty large.  These remind me of what I might find at a bakery.  Love them!

The mix in a jar is great: it is very esthetically pleasing, especially with the bright red cranberries. I also had the chance to try the resulting cookies and they taste delicious.

This is a favorite - even without putting in a jar first!   We often use dark chocolate chips instead of the white chocolate chips.  I've made this recipe often during the last 5 years.   Yummy!  And appealing in the jar, too!

I just made these cookies and they turned out o.k.  The only complaint I have are that they flatten out and crumble.  I dont know where I went wrong, but they came out burnt around the edges were they had flattened out..

This cookie is AMAZING!!! I made the cookie, not the mix, and it was maybe the best cookie I ever had. The only thing I did different was use walnuts instead of pecans because I didn't have any. Make this cookie!!!

I've made these per the directions before giving them as gifts, and I've made them the standard cookie way, creaming the butter and sugars, then adding the eggs, flour, and other stuff. They are easier to mix the standard way but taste absolutely wonderful either way. And they make beautiful gifts. I notice one reviewer said that the eggs and butter together curdled. They don't curdle, exactly, though that is how it looks. It's just difficult to get a homogenous mixture. Doesn't hurt the end result, though.

These cookies were a smash hit at Thanksgiving.  There were none left when the family was gone.  And everyone loved getting a takehome jar to make their own batch later.  I made them a week in advance and froze the premade cookies.  They were as good a week later as the day I made them.

These are so pretty and taste great too! I made them as Christmas gifts and people couldnt believe it. I added country fabrics and rafia to the lids. Everytime I make them they are gone to quick, I have to make triple batches!

These cookies are fantastic!  I made some and took them to work and everyone raved about them.  One gal said they were like the kind you buy at the mall.  My 22 year old son took one bit and said, "Wow!" I made the jars as gifts using macadamia nuts and they were beautiful.  A wonderful Christmas gift.  Will make them again and again.

Made a dozen jars for gifts.  Absolutely fantastic!  I, too, used craisins because that was all I could find.  i also made them twice:  once as originally posted and then with a few changes.  Second time I used real butter instead of b. flavored crisco, used dark brown sugar (because I like that molasses type of flavor and it seems to make it a bit less sweet)and chunks of dark chocolate!  Oh bliss!  They are beautiful in a jar, too.   Cindy

I wanted to try these for gifts this year but wanted to try them first, as others have said.  I made a jar up and made them just as if I'd gotten them as a gift.  They are SOOO good.  And the recipe worked out wonderfully.  I took some of the previous advice of cutting the white sugar by a few tablespoons, as I used the sweeter Craisins.  They were still sweet but not overly so.  I also was lucky to find some novelty snowmen jars that are 28oz.  They are just the perfect size and so much cuter than regular canning jars.  I can't wait now to give these as gifts.

I made 24 jars of these for Christmas gifts...getting bombarded with recipe requests!  I made several "test" batches prior to making the jars...incredibly tasty.  One note:  I found that the organic dried cranberries (found at bulk healthfood store) were so much more moist and flavorful than the commercially produced (Ocean Spray) dried cranberries I'd bought in the supermarket.  Either way, though, these cookies are "too die for."

I just baked these Cranberry Hootycreeks about an hour ago.  I decided to make these for my Christmas presents after looking at some other recipes, but decided that I had better put it in the jar and make the cookies as if I had received the jar as a present.  It was very easy!  I had used the Craisins instead of dried cranberries which made the cookies more sweet.  If you use those, you might want to cut out just a little sugar.  I also had plenty of room in the jar and I only packed down the sugar and flour parts.  The cookies were moist and delicious!  For fun, I put a few semi-sweet chocolate chips on a couple of cookie doughballs before baking (since I love chocolate), and I liked it much better.  My husband and son both loved them without the dark chocolate chips, though.  I think I'll add some for color in the strata of some jars.  By the way, I put heaping teaspoonfuls on heavy-duty aluminum foil (for my cookie sheets--it cooks more lightly, evenly and holds more cookies than my little cookie sheet).  It made 35 small cookies instead of 18 bigger ones.  When the recipe called for heaping spoonfuls, I figured it meant teaspoonfuls.  Try this recipe!  I planned to give it to my son's class for tomorrow, but my husband won't let me.  I gotta go make some more!
    updated 12-27-00.  I gave away a dozen mason jars with this recipe.  I baked extra cookies for people to try, and everyone that tried them loved them!

These cookies are incredible.  If you like all the ingredients, you'll love the end result.  I made them outright instead of as a gift, and the two seperate listings for flour are correct.

LOVE these cookies!!  I gave these as Christmas gifts to teachers at our daughter's school in England.  Everyone raved about them!  I altered the layering in the jars, and used Vanilla Powder instead of having the recipient add extract.  And I made a quadruple batch to share with tons of people!  All loved them!  I do agree with others that less white chocolate & more cranberries is the way to go.

Loved these. I had no problem filling one quart mason jars. I measured the flour and then sifted the flour into the jars. I actually had to push down the last ingredients to close the jar. I will make these for years to come.

i wanted to try these cookies first before giving as gifts. i followed the recipe and put all the ingredients into a mixing bowl. they spread out so thin and browned way too much before the middle was cooked. how is everyone giving this 5 stars??? i read and re-read the reviews, was i missing something? OMG i'm so stoopid...i totally missed the other 1/2 cup of flour!!! doh! i was wondering what that extra white layer was in the picture. i salvaged the remaining dough by adding flour and these cookies are fabulous. i can't wait to give these as gifts. ps. i toasted the pecans first to give it that extra pop of flavor AND no need to grease the pan or put parchment. they don't stick

I mixed the brown & white sugars together to help slow the brown sugar from hardening & clumping so soon.
I made a choc. chip + wt chip version & choc. chip + pb chips.  Both version went over extremely well with recipiants.  I test drove the choc. chip + craisins version & I didn't care for it.  I felt the different sweetnesses of the 2 didn't mesh well.

This will be my third Christmas baking these and packing them up to gift to our neighbors. You can mix and match the add-ins (semi-sweet chocolate chips, walnuts, butterscotch chips) though I find the original recipe is perfect as-is. I cream the butter and sugars first until the texture is light and fluffy, then add the egg. I also sift in the dry ingredients. The cookies come out moist and light every time!

I gave a variation of this out for Christmas last year (I used semi-sweet chocolate chips) and everyone LOVED them!  The only problem I have is that I can't find a better recipe for this year (or one even close).

Horray For Cranberry Hootycreeks!  I tested these out last night on my family and felt like I was cheating on my best friend all time favorite.....Chocolate!  But the picture looked so pretty and I needed a fun gift to give to Real Estate Clients and friends for Christmas so I took a chance.  These were absolutely amazing we were all cheering!  I am going to try them with whole wheat flour!  Chocolate....step aside, Cranberry Hootycreeks are here to stay!

Butter & eggs CAN be creamed easily with a mixture: make sure to only soften the butter, not melt (which can cause the egg to partially cook and curdle).  I tried this recipe both with & without nuts.  With nuts, I crushed them myself and got them too fine.  Will be getting them from store pre-prepped for my gift batch.  Without nuts it has a very biscuit-y texture to it & requires longer bake time.  Going to try adding 1/4-1/2 cup more of oats next time.  They bake just fine on un-greased aluminum foil, just add an extra minute or two.  Everything I used was off-brand or store-brand products & turned out great! No need to get fancy with this one!!

These are delicious cookies and a nice change from all the traditional cookies. I have give the jarred mix as gifts, and I have made them for work and friends. They are always well received. **A couple of pointers: either use unsalted butter or omit the salt from the recipe. I might even decrease the salt just a tad. I prefer these cookies to be golden brown around the edges and on top. They taste better when slightly crunchy. In my oven, it takes 13 minutes on 350 to get them perfect. Also, they don't spread very much so you can space them about an inch apart. I highly recommend these cookies :)

Good cookie mix for gifting.  The cranberries are festive and the white chocolate is an unexpected surprise.  The egg & butter wouldn't integrate very well and I had to bake quite a bit longer than the recipe suggests, but regardless they were very good -- rich, moist & very sweet.  They have a cake-like quality rather than a flaky, buttery texture.   I am making a dozen jars for Christmas gifts.

INAUGURATION COOKIES!!! My daughter wanted an excuse to bring cookies for her class today, so last night, she asked what we could do that's red, white, and blue.  I'd made these a couple of years ago as Christmas gifts, and we all loved them, so I suggested  making them with red dried cranberries and the blueberry-flavored (thus blue) dried cranberries we got from our local cranberry grower. With the white chips they'd be very patriotic.  She loved the idea, so we got up early this morning and made Inauguration Day Hootycreeks. I doubled the recipe and made them just like a typical drop cookie - creaming butter & sugars, adding eggs and vanilla, then stirring in the already mixed dry ingredients (I added 2 1/2 t. cinnamon.) They didn't spread nearly as much as they did when we made them out of the jar, but they still turned out lovely.  I can't wait to hear how they went over at school.

This was my forst attempt at cookies in a jar. I found it somewhat difficult to get the ingredient layers straight, but I managed to do it. I used a canning funnel to pour the ingredients in and poured them in slowly, making sure it was level as I went. I made a batch and found that, if you melt the butter first, the cookies mix better. I had to add about two tablespoons of milk to the better as well because it was a little dry. The cookies had amazing flavor, though.

Excellent recipe. Had to shoo hubby away when he came home from work. So we had some left. You have to make sure that you blend the butter, egg, and etc very well. As one reviewer said, 5-7 minutes. I didn't do this with my first batch and I had flat and crisp cookies. Second time around, everything went well. I used margarine the second time and liked them better with butter. I also added extra cranberries and chips, left out nuts the first time. I think that is necessary (to add more crans and chips).

This fit my quart mason jars perfectly; in fact, when I first put it in, I packed the ingredients too much and there was a huge ugly gap at the top that made me wonder if I'd left something out.  The cookies were easy enough to make, easier if your butter isn't 50* like ours was after being left out in our icy-cold kitchen. The cookies themselves were good, though I can't say they are my favorite.  That is not the fault of the recipe, it is that I just don't like white chocolate or dried cranberries.  My children, who *do* like those ingredients liked the cookies very much!  They turned out crispier than I tend to like cookies but that was my fault too because I made them too small.  I must have, because I ended up with 32 cookies instead of 18!  Watch your cookie sizes or else cut down the baking time!

The cookies turned out delicious and very pretty.  Next time though, I think i'll cut down on the white sugar a little.  Also, I have a question to all the other bakers out there--is there any way to keep the packed brown sugar in the jar moist?  I had put the ingredients together in the jar 2 or 3 days before I baked them, and the brown sugar was rock hard.  Please HELP! Thanks.

Made lots of these for gifts.  The butter has to be room temperature or you will have to do a lot of mixing by hand to soften the cookie.  If too thick, add 1 - 2 tbsp milk. Check to see how mix looks, if too wet, don't any more. The kids and recipients loved this recipe.  One girlfriend mentioned that the kids didn't get any.

I realy love this cookie easy to make and great taste. This cookie will be the hit of the party this christmas. Also made Jars as gifts. Note: 5/8cups is 1/2 cup plus 2 Tablespoons. (I used my cookie scooper and the frist batch came out puffy didn't spread much, doughie on the inside. So I pressed the next batch with the palm of my hand and it came out like a cookie.I was thinking about drizzling white chocolate over the cookie for a new look.

Great gift to give away at Christmas when you want to remember someone but not necessarily spend a lot of money. It's especially nice for your non-baking friends. It's a great cookie also. I simply change the amount of servings to 36 and bake 3 dozen at a time during Christmas. And you just have to love that name!

One of the best cookies I've ever eaten!  First time I made them exactly per the recipe.  Seond time I used dark chocolate chips and almond extract (I was out of vanilla) and took them to whole other level!  Also agree, you can cream the butter and egg, just have to beat for a 3-4 minutes.

I gave several "Hootycreeks" as gifts this year, and they were received with rave reviews!  Changes I made:  I wrapped the two sugars in green plastic wrap and packed them at the top of the jars.  I listed all the ingredients like a recipe on one side of the card, and on the other changed the instructions to read:  "Cream your butter with top two layers from jar; beat in your egg and vanilla until fluffy."  Many recipients also asked about the name; can anyone tell me?

These cookies were good, but not my favorite, although a few friends I gave the jars to for Christmas loved them.  Some made them into bars.  I found they were better with certain "better" brands of white chocolate chips than with more "available" brands.  I had to let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet as they were much to pliable to take off immediately; if I left then in the oven any longer they became too dark and crisp.  The jars made lovely gifts.

I made these as written to try before I packaged them for gifts - they were very yummy!  Being a seasoned baker, I was skeptical also of the directions to cream the butter and the egg but decided to try the recipe as-written.  I figured the recipe couldn't have gotten a 5 star rating from 544 reviews if it was flawed.  :)  As far as the butter and egg...I got impatient after several minutes of beating with my hand mixer and just ended up throwing the jar ingredients in a hoping for the best.  The butter and egg yolk fats/proteins emulsified but there was a little liquid/water left in the bowl that never mixed in (as I expected).  No worries though, the end result was great!  I measured everything into the jar as written but will probably do them in reverse order for gifts so the most colorful ingredients end up at the bottom since I'll have the top covered with a bit of fabric - just my packaging preference.  I also opted to throw in a tsp of powdered vanilla (Nielsen Massey,) so that it is one less ingredient the recipient has to add (my only tiny modification).  The dough was dry & crumbly but came together easily since I opted to roll it into balls (golf-ball sized, pressed down slightly on parchment lined pans) - I got 14.  Since mine were a little on the larger size, they ended up baking 13-14 minutes.  Great little cookie that will make a beautiful little gift!!   One question though...were does the name come from??!??!

I did not make the jars as gifts.  Instead I decided to make them and give the baked cookies.  I found  that mixing the 1 egg, and 1/2 cup of butter was just not enough to make a batter.  It was very dry and powdery I added a 2nd egg and that seemed to do the trick.   It was very tasty cookie and would probably do it again.. I'm thinking the probably was  the egg I used might have just been small.. Probably will be sure to use extra large egg next time.

Love these cookies! I doubled the recipe, and used raspberry chips rather than white chocolate. Great fruity flavor this way--Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.

Just made a test batch and they are definitely going to be my gifts in a jar this year! I accidently made them vegan because I didn't have any butter or eggs in the house (discovered after I started making them) so I used Earth Balance margarine and egg replacer mix. They turned out fantastic! The mix doesn't quite fill a quart jar so I'm going to use some crumbled was paper as another reviewer suggested. I also baked mine about twice as long. I think it's because I was using a light aluminum cookie sheet my old brown ones would have browned them much faster. In all, they made 20 normal sized cookies.  And besides being beautiful in the jar, they are EXCELLENT to eat!

WOW!  My husband and daughter both said these are their new favorite cookies!  I wanted to test it out before I gave it as a gift. I only added 1/4 tsp salt because my butter was salted (which is probably why some of the reviews say its salty).  Also I love the idea of mixing the two sugars so the brown sugar doesn't harden.  All in all- a GREAT recipe... can't wait to give it as gifts!

I was looking for a great homemade christmas gift.  These look so pretty in the jars, that I decided to give them a try.  I was skeptical, because I am not a huge white chocolate fan.  I made a sample batch last night and could not stop eating them.  Excellent cookie!  I followed the directions exactly, except I skipped the nuts and cooked them a minute or two longer than the recipe said.  Will make again, probably today!

I customized and changed this to just make at home in your kitchen, rather than giving as a jar gift.  You CAN mix butter, eggs and vanilla, but it does require the use of a hand mixer.  Anyway, these cookies are AWESOME!!!  Absolutely delicious.  My new favorite.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious!! I sent these to my brother's family for the holidays, and the kids were reported to be dancing around the house saying "hoo-ty-creeks! Hoo-ty-creeks!". The ingredients don't fit snugly in the jar, so don't pack too tightly. However, I've never received a complaint from the taste-testers!

Ignore posters who say that mixing the butter and egg together causes it to curdle...it's not curdled. The "problem" is you want to call it that is that the egg and butter don't completely combine without a binder such as the sugar. Once you add the balance of the ingredients everything will be fine.

I didn't make these as a gift but for immediate consumption.  I like to really cream my butter and sugars around 10  minutes.  If I were making these as gifts I would do as one reviewer suggested and keep the sugar separate from the other ingredients.  I used all brown sugar because we were low on white.  I also doubled the recipe in order to fill the cookie jar.  A great chewy/crisp combo.  We are now planning on making these as Valentine Gifts.

I started making these looking for an alternative to chocolate chip when one of our family members developed an allergy to chocolate and I have been making these cookies for several years now.  They are wonderful!  I get funny looks at the name but everyone agrees the cookies are great.  The only thing that I do differentyl is that I add 1/2 tsp. each of cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour.  Thanks for a

The cookie recipe is great, I got a lot of compliments when I made it.  I also gave these away for Christmas in quart jars and they didn't fit tightly in the jar so after some shifting around it didn't look as pretty as I would have liked.

I made these as gift jars for my daughter to bring to school for her teachers.  They look beautiful.  I used a quart Ball wide mouth mason jar and the recipe filled it to the top with no problems.  To measure the 5/8 cup flour, I weighed 1 cup of flour and did the math.  So, I ended up using 99 grams of flour.

This was my first time doing a cookie in the jar recipe. I decided to test it out before making them as gifts. The cookies came out great!

However, just a side note, the jars do NOT get completely filled. You have some options:
1.  Add more cranberries, white chocolate and pecans to the jar.  I made them without nuts, since I do not know if the recipients have nut allergies.  I added extra white chocolate and cranberries...quick fix.

2.  If you bake them yourself, like I did, add a couple cookies to the top of the white chocolate.  It is a good space filler.

3.  Purchase 3/4 liter jars, and the mix will fit perfectly.

I got a jar of this mix for Christmas and although I wasn't sure about the cranberries I made them and they were awesome.  Very moist and lots of flavor.  I am going to made them again and perhaps I'll give them out as gifts next Christmas!

These were surprisingly good. My family said "yuck, cranberry cookies?" and I thought I'd be taking them to work so they wouldn't go to waste here. These were really nice cookies and we all liked them after all. They didn't turn out the prettiest as they really didn't spread much. This gave me 2 dozen cookies. Not bad, I might make these again sometime, but I don't think they were that memorable, just different.

I can never remember the name of this thing, but my friends freaked out over this little gem.  I liked them well enough, but they were seriously near tears. I made another batch w/dried apricots and almonds that were more to my liking.

Everybody loves these (both baked and still in the jar). Last X-mas I mailed a few jars and I took a few jars with me on an 8 hour car ride. The ones that came with me in the car were fine. The ones I mailed were all mixed up (no layers) but still baked and tasted great.  Something to keep in mind if you're gifting these. The dough looks a little sloppy and crumbly, but don't worry, they bake up fine!

Made this a few years ago for the first time for Xmas presents, and now I have to make it every year or I'm in trouble with my friends!  One thing I do is get lined gift bags from Papermart.com, and make labels on my computer.  Then I just need to throw all the ingredients in the bag, which is much quicker than layering in a jar.

These cookies were delicious!  I made them for ourselves as a trial run before making for friends and family.  I used 1 cup of flour plus 2 Tablespoons to equal the 5/8 cup and the 1/2 cup.  I also used the white chocolate/semi-sweet chocolate swirl morsels and Craisins instead of cranberries.  Even my 2 year old loved them!  Oh and they took about 11 minutes to bake at 350 degrees in my gas oven.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for a fund raiser for breast cancer research. I used pink granulated sugar from cake decorating aisle and pink m&m's instead of baking chips. They were very good in my test batch before sending them off for the cooking in a jar bake sale.

I doubled this recipe to try it out on my family before giving as gifts.  I used the new choc/white chocolate swirl chips and I toasted the pecans first(this gives a much richer nutty flavor).  The cookies tasted delicious--definitely gift-worthy!!

These are excellent!  The blended flavors are even better than any of them individually.  Cookies are crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle, and not too sweet.  They were a bit crumbly when dropping on the cookie sheet, but I clumped them together as best I could, and they baked up just fine.

The hubby and I made 15 of these jars for Christmas gifts (2002), and I am still hearing from the recipients. They made the cookies and loved them. No one had a problem with the directions. Our test batch came out wonderful. I did have to sub some cherry flavored Craisins, because I waited until the last minute to grocery shop, but those were fine too.

INCREDIBLE RECIPE!  I made this for the first time as gifts this Christmas.  Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe, including a gourmet chef!!!  I made a batch for our family to try them out first and they are absolutely fabulous.  My husband loves white chocolate and really enjoyed these cookies.

We loved these cookies, my only problem was that they spread out too thin and then fell apart very easily.  I am going to try again today.

Wonderful cookie! I scaled the recipe to 24 and found it wouldn't fit into a wide mouth quart jar but since I was mailing it as a gift to my sister was just as happy to put the brown sugar (and extra cranberries) in a zip-lock bag to keep the sugar from drying out. She shaped the dough for baking in walnut-size balls and the recipe yielded 4 dozen cookies. I looked at every grocery supplier in town (including the local health food cooperative) and could not find unsweetened cranberries so went with the sweetened, dried cranberries and they worked fine.

These cookies were good, but I don't really care for white chocolate too much so I can't rate them higher.  I ended up adding chocolate chips as well and they were better.  It does make a very dry dough, which was okay, but the cookies also ended up a little dry.  All in all, I like the idea of cranberries and chocolate in cookies, they were pretty good and I will probably make them again.  They do look nice in the jar, but as others have said, take great care with the brown sugar- it WILL harden in the jar quickly.

I decided to give myself a gift and made a batch.  Awesome cookie.  No matter what size of cookie I made - it needed 12 minutes to bake.  I, like others, love the cookie name!!  Thanks

Weird name-good cookie!  I made this to try it before I prepared it for gifts.  I made as the recipe states except I took other reviewers advice and changed the order of ingredients in the jar so the pretty colors were closer to the bottom.  It is beautiful in the jar and the cookies are jsut yummy!  I made smaller cookies and it turned out 32 and they are all gone less than 24 hours later.  Thanks for sharing a great gift giving idea!

I really liked this cookie!  I too had a little room left in the jar, but will try the suggestion of adding more craisins.  I would love to know the origin of the name.  What a hoot!

Sorry I did not think this recipe deserved all the hype in the reviews.  I thought is sounded different so I gave it a try...First of all there wasn't enough ingredients to fill the jar, I had about 3" left in the jar! If you give this as a gift its going to get all mixed up if its not filled. Next the batter was very crumbly, I had to FORM them into balls.  They tasted okay, and the white chocolate with dried cranberries was different, but again I did not think they were anything special.

We painted some mason jars and layered in this recipe.  If you use regular jars as opposed to wide mouth, it fills the jar better.  We made dozens to give as gifts.

This cookie is like a chocolate cookie on STEROIDS. So yummy! The first batch failed because I didn't see the second 1/2 cup of flour but once I got that in they were heavenly. I put brown sugar on the bottom,white sugar,cranberries, chocolate chips,chopped pecans, mixed 5/8 C flour + 2 TBSP and 1/2 C flour, 1/2 Tsp Salt and 1/2 Tsp Baking Soda and put into a foldable sandwich bag at the top of jar and crunched up a paper towel to hold it all down tight. Came out beautifully. Makes 24 cookies when formed into balls by heaping TPBPS. 10-12 min Baking time on parchment paper at 350 degrees. Loved them!

OMG, so delicious!  Didn't use any nuts because of allergies in family, and only had chocolate chips so used those instead of white chocolate, but the combination of the rest of the ingredients is so good that I immediately made a second batch to freeze and add to the Christmas dessert table.  Great idea to give gifts jars of the ingredients along with the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

These cookies in a jar are awesome! My sons and I have made them for the past 4 years as Christmas gifts for all their teachers, a few family members and we've even used them as special giveaways at holiday parties.  I have gotten wonderful comments from everyone year after year. And have even gotten requests for the cookie recipe. 
I've made the cookies just as written.  I've also left out the nuts for those with allergies and substituted the white chocolate chips for dark chocolate chips and have gotten great comments from all variations. 

The presentation is wonderful and so easy to put together, my boys actually do a lot of the work. 

The instructions for making the cookies from the jar work just fine. Don't mind the reviews that report issues with mixing butter with egg and the mixture curdling.  If you have ever made cookies from a store bought dry mix, it's the same exact process. 

Try these cookies! And share with family and friends. You'll be glad you did!

I received a jar as a Christmas gift, but didn't make them until the first of March. I also was afraid that because the butter/egg/vanilla didn't get "fluffy" that they were ruined. Not so! The brown sugar was also very hard and lumpy once I got it in the bowl. Instead of stirring it with a spoon, I just used my "five finger mixer" (my hand!) so I could break up the lumps. They turned out great! Looked good and tasted good. This is a keeper.

I follow the recipe as is and I love it.  These cookies are always a big hit. The sweetness from the white chocolate plays well with the tartness from the cranberries.

Delicious. Just made these,Made few changes b'coz of purely personal choice, pretty sure this would be good as is, I liked my version also. Used all whole wheat flour, walnuts, semi sweet chocolate chips and also added good 2 tsp of ground cinnamon, doubled the vanilla just to mask the smell of egg for my hub, made into balls before flattening them a little, it was hard to just spoon this very crumbly mix.and since this was my very first time baking cookies , nervous about undercooking my cookies, baked them for full 12 min at 375. Result.. huge cookies with crispy and crunchy underneath and no they we're not burnt, soft and chewy top, just enough sweet and very very tasty. I know I'll make them again and again ,(just may be I'll cut down the baking time to like 10.5 to 11 min)and also will be gifting whenever I've a chance. Woohhhoooo, my first cookie baking experience was great. Thank you Susan! Update( 7/15/12): over the 4 batches I've done so far, figured out these easier numbers  1/2 cup of each flour, 3/4 cup of total sugar, 1/2 cup each of crans, pecans and the choco chips, 1/2 cup butter, 1 egg, 2 tsp vanilla,1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp each of baking soda and salt. and also cream the sugar along with room temp butter and egg. Super yum right of oven and also super duper easy. thanks again!

I wanted to know if it tasted good, so I tried and loved it!  My son really enjoyed it as well.  I used fresh cranberries instead and reduced sugar amount which I always do with any dessert recipes since our family prefer subtle sweetness.  It is a great recipes:)

I did not do this in a jar, but just baked the cookies instead.  Since I was making some for others, I left out the nuts in case of allergies, and just added some extra craisins and white chocolate chips.  So good!  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely wonderful. These cookies are very good (I will add a little less sugar next time - just my taste). The brown sugar doesn't harden as other reviewers stated.
Great gift idea and very delicious cookies!!

I received this as a gift for christmas. I personally don't like fruits in my cookies or sweets so I thought for sure I would not like these cookies, but I was wrong! I took the jar to my boyfriend's house, and made them there. His WHOLE family loved them!! The cookies disappeared within 30 minutes of making them. The next day was New Years, so I ended up making these cookies again for a party. This time I doubled the recipe, and it was a hit. Out of all the food at the party, these cookies were the first to disappear and everyone kept telling me how good they were. I definitely recommend this recipe for any event. I guarantee everyone will love them. BTW, I did not alter this recipe or do anything differently.

These are absolutely fantastic.  I have had this recipe for YEARS and finally, after about 5 years or so, I decided to try it. My only regret is that I didn't make these sooner. 
i tried the recipe as written before making the jars, and I had one small issue: the butter, egg, and vanilla never got fluffy, but the cookies were amazing!

In theory this gift idea is great.  However, the recipe did not work at all for me.  (Now take into account that I am a college student and not an experienced baker by any means).  I found that the butter, egg, and vanilla mixture was most likely the source of my problems.  I tried twice to make it look correct, but it just wasn't going to happen.  If the recipe could be perfected this would definitely get more stars!

I made the jar, and it was super easy and looks great! Only change was I mixed the white and brown sugars to avoid the brown sugar solidifying, per other folks' cookie jar instructions. I also found out a bit late that my friend dislikes pecans, and did some quick pecan/chip swapping! Just made the recipe to try it out, despite already having gifted it, and it was really tasty! Took me a while to mix it enough by hand, but it got there.

I don't really have a sweet-tooth, so I found these cookies to be WAY too sweet! I overlooked that the cranberries and chocolate chips would add to the sweetness. Otherwise I would have cut down on the amount of sugar. If you prefer savoury to sweets, I would suggest cutting down on the sugar and choc. chips portions and increasing the nut portion.
I still give this 4 stars though for the novel gift idea.

I was expecting these to come out really devine given the white chocolate and cranberries, but they were on the border of bland. The texture was also off, too dense and not chewy or crispy, just sort of blah. The dough was almost crumbly and I felt like they needed something to add some more moisture into them. I made these how I would normally make cookies and creamed the butter and sugars first before adding the eggs and vanilla then the dry ingredients. Still didn't come out right. I think I will stick to my basic chocolate chip recipe and just add in white chips, berries and pecans instead of making these again. At least I know I'll get a likable texture from those. Good concept, but needs some work.

These were delicious.  I made them as gifts, but also tried them out before hand.  I prefer cherries instead of cranberries and chose to use pistachios instead of pecans because it was around the holidays and it makes them red and green.  It is similar to a biscotti recipe that enjoy and it's great to not have to double bake these. Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies were a huge hit with my friends. I took them for a girls weekend at the beach and the five of us devoured them in no time at all. The ingredients look great layered in a jar, and they're incredibly easy. The parchment paper is key during baking. Bake them for the minimum time for perfectly soft cookies.

These cookies are delicious! Moist and chewy and the flavors really work well together. I used Craisins because that's what I had on hand. The family really enjoyed these, they were a nice break from the norm.

I also separated the sugars in a bag at the top of the jar with instructions to cream the butter with sugars first. These cookies are just wonderful and everyone who received this mix in a jar raved about the look of it and the ease of making cookies. Now they all want the recipe so they can make their own.

I am eating these as I type!  They're really good.  I followed directions exactly as written (except I didn't put these in a jar) and they are scrumptious.  The only problem I had was that the top middle part of the cookies didn't seem to cook well.  I didn't want to keep them in any longer than 8 minutes because they were perfectly brown by that point.  I let them sit on the cooling rack for a few minutes before eating and they seemed to be cooked through all the way. Thank you!

LOVED these cookies!  They're a huge favorite with the whole family!  Doing 1/2 choco chips and 1/2 white chips works just as well.

LOVE these cookies!  I do find they take longer to cook than the 10 minutes when 2 trays are cooked simultaneously.  They are chewy, just sweet enough, and delicious!  This recipe makes about 32 cookies.  You can make them smaller and get about 36 from this batch measure.  Try them, you won't be disappointed!

Awesome Presentation. The cookies warm out of the oven are fantabulous. As other viewers have suggested, the cranberries and white chips are such a nice change to the standard chocolate chip cookies... especially during the holidays. Thanks Susan for sharing!

Love this recipe! So easy to make, both as a mix and cookies. Very versatile recipe. I substitute semi-sweet chocolate chips for the nuts and have been known to substitute raisin for the cranberries. Excellent. Thanks for sharing!

I wanted to try these cookies before the holidays to see if I liked them enough to give them as gifts and they were amazing! I can't stop eating them, so I'm definitely gifting these. Even though I was scared of beating the butter and egg without adding the sugar first, I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect.

The cranberries and white chocolate go together so well! I do have a hard time filling up the jar when I make this but it doesn't stop me.

FANTABULOUS!!!! Perfection, fluffy without being over soft...just the right amount of softness. I omitted the salt because I used salted butter and I used baking powder instead of baking salt.

I made a trial run at home to see if these would be good for In-A-Jar presents. These were fabulous! I plan on doubling the recipe, not only to make them less complicated but to also fit them in a larger jar. Great recipe! I think these might be my new favorite cookies.

Two weeks ago I found this recipe and I've made it four times since not counting the time I made it for a gift in a jar. I've taken these to a few family gatherings and they are gone in a minute! I've made it exactly like the recipe everytime except once, I used walnuts instead of pecans because that was all I had and they turned out just as good! Thanks for this one, it's definitley a keeper!

These were okay to me, but I think I'll just alter my handed down oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe next time I want an oatmeal cranberry cookie. It just didn't have the specialness I was hoping for, though I can't place why.

I actually made the cookies for my work cookie exchange and they were GREAT!  I also added dried blue berries which added something extra to them.  They were pretty close to Otis Spunkmeyer's Red White and Blue cookies (with Macadamia nuts though).  Loved them!

this is one of the best recipes i have tried! i did not think i would like them because i am not a big fan of white choc or cranberries, but they were awesome. the only change i made was to bake them in bars (8x8 dish) and i loved them like that...crispy edges and chewy center. will definitely make again!

Five stars for sure!! I made the recipe in Mason jars (a very pretty presentation - I added a festive notecard and christmas ribbon). I also baked a double batch to taste test from two jars I had made. They were very yummy. Like other reviewers noted, even if your not a cranberry fan, it's hard not to like these cookies. I used Craisins that I bought in bulk at a warehouse store. I also used a generous 1/2 cup portion for the cranberry and white chocolate chips. This goes on my Christmas keeper list!!

I made these cookies this weekend and the recipe was a flop.  The flour measurements were not accurate.  It should have been at least a cup and a half of flour.  They came out of the oven like lace cookies and fell apart.  The temperature should have been 350o instead of 325.  I would not make these again.

These are one of the abosulutely best cookies recipes I have ever tasted. I leave out the pecans and add more brown sugar and they come out a little more crispy on the outside. Once I found the recipe they became a Christmas tradition!

awesome. these cookies turned out so great, moist and wonderful for a change of pace form the usual. I'm not a huge vanilla chip fab, so I have made these with chocolate chips and they are great too.

These mixes were a blessing to my Christmas season in so many ways: inexpensive and satisfying to assemble and give, beautiful in their jars on my counter decorated ready to be given, delicious baked, flattering when the rave reviews poured in after they were received and eaten...I can't praise them too highly.  I'm gathering jars and formatting the recipe labels for this Christmas.  It gives me a rich feeling just knowing I have this gift already picked out for so many on my list.

I tried these as a new cookie recipe for a change, and now they are everybodies favorite cookie.  I did add a teaspoon of almond instead of vanilla.  These are my most requested when someone wants cookies, and at the holidays.  Thanks for a great cookie recipe.

I will be making these again.  I love to give homemade gifts for Christmas and each year that I do I get more and more appreciation for them.   This mix is beautiful and tastey.  I just mixed up a batch that I had prepared at Christmas time (7 months ago!)  They were as good as ever.  Thank you for this great recipe.

We were given this as a Christmas present from Lori U.  We couldn't stop eating them -- I took our extras to our child's preschool, and all the teachers begged for the recipe!  YUM!  The director said that she felt like she was actually eating something healthy as opposed to a decadent cookie.

A delicious cookie.  I followed the recipe except I used approximately two tablespoons less of the flour...It calls for 5/8 cup, and then 1/2 cup, be prepared: the batter was still VERY stiff and took some muscle to manage;  but the outcome was excellent.  The cookies were well formed and tasted perfectly.  Will make again.

I must have done something wrong because the whole "beat together 1/2 cup softened butter, 1 egg and 1 teaspoon of vanilla until fluffy" just did not happen for me. The eggs hardly combined with the butter at all - and the ingredients were fresh because I bought them that morning ... That being said, these cookies still managed to turn out pretty good. Very tasty, but I decided not to give as gifts because I did not want the same issue to happen to other people.

This recipe was great.  The first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly.  The next time I used macadamia nuts instead of pecans and turned out great.  I also tried them with white and semi-sweet chocolate and these too were great.  Everyone enjoyed them and were eating them while they were still warm.  Will continue to make these.  I made a few jars for friends and kept a few for us as it makes it easy to make them in a short time.

I made these last night, and my roommates all loved them. I used orange-flavored craisins because the store had run out of the regular ones, but I was pleased with the cranberry-orange taste!

Gave these as Christmas gifts last year to rave reviews.  They have been requested again...These are really good cookies!!  They don't spead much when baked so they come out nice and thick, somewhat soft and chewy.  We don't know how they would be the next day as there were none left!!  This is a keeper for sure!!

Don't know how these delicious cookies received this odd name, but they are the best ever.  I have been giving these 'cookies in a jar' to friends and relatives for several years.  If you try them only once, you will be hooked forever.  Talq

I chose this recipe based on the ratings from other people.  WoW, was it a big hit! I mass produced this as a gift to many families for christmas, and i got calls (one tonight even) about how great the cookies are, and how many people shared them with friends, brought them to dessert potlucks, told me i should sell them :)  Thanks for the delicious creative idea!  It was very colorful and a little on the "healthier" side.

I have made this recipe for the past two years.  And the main reason is because I get so many requests for this cookie.  I also prepared the jars and printed the recipes on nice paper, which I strung around the neck with ribbon.  Plus I re-arranged the ingredient order to give the jar a more colorful look.  Very simple, yet very impressive.

These cookies were awesome.  I don't like cranberries, but I made them for Thanksgiving because I thought they would look festive.  Not only did they look great, but they tasted great, too!  Everyone raved and raved about them!!

Delicious cookies!  These were not gifts, so I made the cookies the usual way (ie. creamed butter and sugar first, then added egg and vanilla, then the dry ingredients) rather than the manner specified for the gift jar.  They disappeared in a flash--a new family favorite!

We didn't really like these much.  I have a "cookie monster" at home and these are the first cookies I've made that sat around the house for more than about 10 minutes - 2 days in fact.  They were nothing special which was surprising considering all the yummy bits and pieces that went into them.  We followed the recipe and the results were disappointing.  I really can't explain why everyone else seems to give these 5 stars, but I won't be making these again.

Wonderful!  Jar recipients raved--of course, I had to "test" the recipe before giving any jars away.  Different, good.  I cut the sugar and the salt a bit, but otherwise it makes a wonderful presentation and it's yummy.

Too dry (even with the tricks tried in earlier reviews); tastes exactly like a pat of salty butter.  The cranberries and other flavors do not make themselves apparent.

These cookies are so good!  I didn't get around to making them for gifts (the mix), but did throw a batch together for a Christmas Eve get-together and everyone loved them!  Thanks for a great, new cookie recipe.  Oh, and I call them Cranberries in the Snow......Hootycreeks just didn't sound Christmasy :).

These cookies were a HUGE hit with all that tasted them!  I decided to make up the jars for Christmas gifts and they turned out beautiful.  I added a 1/2 cup of cinnamon chips and the mix filled the jar perfectly.  Also, I used Craisins, but did not reduce the sugar and they were not too sweet...they were perfect!  Thanks, Susan!

A beautiful, colorful presentation for gift-giving.  Easy to make and you don't have to "force" the ingredients to fit into the jar. The cookies that I baked turned out perfectly and I'm not usually very good at baking.  A great recipe!

This recipe makes the cutest gift!  The jars are unbelievably decorative and look so good!  I make this for small, inexpensive gifts...only problem is that they are so easy and fun to make, I have to remember who I have already sent them to!  Must try for kids...hands-on and so much fun!

I have made this recipe, both as a decorative jar and as the baked cookies and it is absolutely terrific.  Everyone who has tried the cookies raves about how wonderful they are.  The jars come out really pretty.  I decorated the tops with cranberry motif fabric and gave them as gifts.

Although I didn't try these (I won't eat anything with nuts!) the recipe sounded so unusual I thought I'd give em a try. Am I ever glad that I did. The are always a HUGE hit! The cranberries seem to be the element that makes these so appealing. I often reduce the amount of white chips (just slightly) and throw in semisweet choc.chips or milk choc.chips or a combo of both so that the cookies have even more color and texture.

OK, I have to admit, I haven't made these yet, but we did make them as Christmas gifts this year. They were SO easy and FUN!! It's a great family or friend activity - and so wonderful to give and receive. We made 24 jars in ~40 minutes and a total cost of about $75. That's about $3 for the PERFECT gift! Cookies in a jar are wonderful - this one looks great (thanks to Allrecipes for the picture!) and we've gotten nothing but raves back from the recipients! I guess I'll have to make them for us too!

I tried this recipe out before giving it as a gift and I loved it!  Not only was it very easy to make, but the cookies were excellent.  I didn't pack down the ingredients, just leveled them to make pretty layers, and it fit perfectly.

This is my recipe.  I named them after the creek that runs behind our house.  A "hootycreek" is just my personalization of the recipe.  "Cranberry Hootycreeks" are so much more interesting than just Cranberry Oatmeal Cookies..lol.  I am so glad everyone has enjoyed them. They are my daughter's favorite.  A close friend, wanting to console my daughter after she lost her best friend to a drunk driver asked her, "If I baked you a batch of your favorite cookie, what kind should I make?"  The answer was Cranberry Hootycreeks.  Thank you, everyoone!

This makes a delicious cookie when baked and a fun, cheap, thoughtful gift when given as a mix. When I gave the mix as a gift I did keep the sugars separate in a baggie as I agree it's better to cream the sugar with the butter.

This is one of my favorite cookies. I wanted to share that I forgot to buy the cranberries but had dates so I subbed the chopped dates for the 1/2 cup of cranberries and I actually like the cookies even more now.

Made it prior to making up jars to give away. Easy to prepare, not sure what others meant about butter and egg curdling- mine whipped together beautifully.  Made 27 biscuits that were gone within a day! A perfect gift for teachers etc :)

I made these as bar cookies since it is extremely humid where I live.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I had to substitute chocolate chips for the white chocolate due to lack of availability.  I did not like these warm, but once cool, I liked them and my husband raved about them. I used Craisins and honestly could barely taste the cranberry flavor. One comment to those adding extra chips, nuts or cranberries to make the jar full: I found the batter very thick and had to use my hands to mix it and get it to hold together. Too many mix-ins could make this barely hold together. Update: Might cut sugar slightly next time, as quite sweet. Also need to loosen or remove from pan fairly quickly, as these stick and fall apart when removing. Love the mix of flavors!

I made these for the first time as gifts this year, I did take the advise on making them first and trying them out.  I did have to add an extra egg due to my batter was a little dry and I had to cook them a few minutes longer. They are very good and I am impressed on how they turned out. My only question is when I made them for me to try I measured the flour then sifted and when I made the jars I sifted a lot of flour then measured out the flour amount.  Not being a very good baker does that really matter ??

These are great cookies!  In fact, I entered them into a dessert contest at work today and won!  Everyone loved them.  I did what another reviewer suggested and creamed the butter, eggs and sugar together first and then added the rest of the ingredients.  This will be my go to cookie from now on!

Sorry Deb Millikan, but you can mix butter and egg, just whisk it until smooth and then mix in the sugar. Been doing it that way for about 50 odd years.

This recipe surprised me. It was so easy to make, in the jar, and would make a nice gift for someone that really does already have everything. I used a wide mouth candle jar, tied some beaded ribbon around it, and added a nice large gift tag big enough to print and paste the directions. What's nice, is the cookies actually taste pretty good from this recipe too. They are heavy on the dried cranberries, though, so just know the person they are being given to really likes dried fruit or cranberries in baked goods. I used semi-sweet chocolate, as I just find white chocolate super sweet. The full recipe using a cookie scoop yields 34 cookies, which is a good amount. The printed cookie directions are easy to follow and are possible for even a beginner baker.

I made these last year for office Xmas presents.  Had I actually tried them before giving, I would have had a hard time parting with them.  Read reviews for instructions on how much ingredients to buy if you are making in bulk and set up an assembly line putting in one ingredient at a time in all jars.  Also, consider order of ingredients using some of the prettier ingredients at the bottom of the quart jar where they aren't hidden by any decorative top you might use. Along with the decorative top, I attached a tag with instructions for baking.  Everyone raved about them.

I got this for a Christmas present and just made them.  They taste FANTASTIC!!  Mixing the butter, egg, and vanilla is a little messy; and it doesn't "fluff," but I just dumped the rest of the stuff in and mixed it up.  I might have to give these as gifts next year.  I'll definitely make the cookies again just mixing them up the regular way.

Really yummy.  I doubled the recipe because making 18 is hardly worth the mess!  I was short 1/4 cup of butter, so I sub'd olive oil.  I think that probably helped them to spread better when cooking.  I also added a full cup of grated coconut.  The final product was really tastey, but a little crumbley bc of my additions.  I also used mini choc chips which I think helped to disperse them better.  I'll definitely make them again, but I think I'll either add more salt or cut back on some of the sugar.  Just my personal preference.  PS- I made them for me to eat, not as gifts =)

These may very well be the best cookies I've ever made!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated, but eliminated the pecans.  I used orange flavored cranberries.  Tasted like a Christmas cookie.  I didn't need to grease the cookie sheet.  Cookies took about 12 minutes to cook and they were very moist.  Such an easy recipe.  Great tasting food with little effort is tops in my book.

I was actually given this in a jar with instructions attatched.it was so quick and easy to make,whipped them up on christmas eve,and they were hastily consumed and enjoyed by young and old alike on Christmas day.Only trouble was when I wanted to make another batch a few days later,I realised I didn't have the recipe.Hence had to google it(as friend was away)Luckily I found it easily.

I made ten jars of these for Christmas gifts to coworkers and they were a hit! The texture and favors complimented each other very well plus they looked pretty in the jar. One thing I did mention on the "how to bake these" note I attached to the jars was...when mixing the butter and egg ensure the butter isn't too hot otherwise one risks scrambling the egg. (Those coworkers who aren't cooks appreciated the heads up)

Wow!  I'm so happy I made these!!  I made them as Christmas gifts last year and so far everyone has really liked them.  I used unprocessed flour and sugar (make it a bit better for you I guess) and everyone has raved about them.  They are so beautiful too.

Every time I make these and give them as gifts, I am asked for the recipe just so that the recipient can make another batch of the cookies to eat!  Great recipe, great cookie, great gift idea!

I got this as a "Dirty Santa" gift from a neighbor. At first, I was disappointed thinking I dont like cranberries that much and certainly not in a cookie. But, tha lady that gave them as gifts is an awesome cook and baker so I decidd to give them a try. Boy was I glad I did, I made them Christmas day and they were gone before the day was over. Everyone loved them!!!!!!

The jars look very beautiful! I didn't bother to put fabric because I didn't want to cover up the layers so I just tied a bow. I used semi sweet chips in place of the nuts because I made these for daycare teachers and they have a no nut policy. I ran out of white chips when I went to make my own batch so I used all semi sweet chips instead. I found the dough hard to work with since it was super crumbly. I had to roll the balls in my hand first, not able to just drop onto the baking sheet. But the end result was a very delicious cookie! Oh, and I beat the egg & butter with the electric mixer, it does start to look normal and not like cottage cheese if you do this, but then I'm wondering if that's why my dough was crumbly.

I made this recipe, exactly as directed in the recipe.  The butter/egg/vanilla mixture doesn't really look right after beating.  However, once the other ingreadients are added, it DOES work out just fine.  The only complaint I had was that you had to mix the heck out of it with a spoon to get everything to blend properly. The cookie is very sweet and delicately flavored, while chewy from the oatmeal.  Actually a bit too sweet for me, but my kids inhaled the cookies.  I'll make the jars and give the cookie mix for Christmas, because it is pretty and most people will like it.  Good recipe, but not my favorite.

Just finished baking my first batch. I didn't want to give the mix in a jar as a gift until I knew first-hand that the results would be great.  And, they are! I am so pleased to have found this recipe. I know my friends will love them. These cookies are very sweet...keep that in mind when gifting. Some of my friends prefer a less sweet cookie such as biscotti.

We love this recipe.  One year I received it as a Christmas gift from my sister-in-law.  The next year I gave it as gifts to my mother, sister, and co-workers.  I don't make any changes to the recipe.

Perfect recipe as written. I didn't want these for gifts, I just wanted a good cranberry and white chocolate chip cookie and these were SO it!! I made them quite large using 1/4 cup for each cookie so I had to bake about 11 minutes.

This is the best cookie recipe. I make them like traditional cookies. (beating the eggs and adding the sugar to that etc...) I do not add nuts and i use chocolate chips instead of the white one. It is a terrific recipe.

I've been sending this as Christmas gifts for the last few years and had many people ask for the complete recipe.   When I make them at home I  cut the sugar in half and it still works very well with all the sweets from the chocolate.  
 My 7 yaer old duaghter was a big help in assembling this year.  She was actually "measuring" each ingredient which was not the case last year. 
  Great recipe!

Wow these are really really good. Made a test batch last night to taste them and they were gret. Neverreally ventured out of choco chip cookies so I was a little scared but these were yummy. I followed the advice of a reviewer and blended the sugar w/ butter before adding the egg and everythiing else. They came out perfect but I did have to cook them alittle longer then suggested. I will be putting the sugar in a small bag at top of the jar and recommending the butter be blended w/ sugar before adding egg and everything else. 

GREAT recipe you all have to try it!

BTW I used swirled choc chips with white choco and semi-sweet.

Great cookie recipe.  I think the base of this recipe could be used for other kinds of cookies - like try mixing in gumdrops at christmas time, or peanut butter cups for a chocolate version.

The cookies made from the jar are always flat. If you make the recipe as you would a normal cookie recipe-they come out great. The jars make such a pretty gift, though. I have given them out 3 Christmases straight.

I received this mix in the jar as a Christmas gift from a a student.  I am not a nut fan and have a daughter with nut allergies, so I made them and took to work to "get rid" of them.  They were so delicious I nearly ate them all (even with the nuts) before anyone else got them.  I plan on making them again without the nuts for my family.  YUM!

LOVE these!  Great alternative to chocolate chip.  My husband is allergic to cocoa (therefore to chocolate) and can't have chocolate chip cookies.  I think these are even better!

Got to be the best cookies I have ever tried.  The jars came out beautiful.  I did put all my flower at the bottom of the jar as suggested.  My batter did come out very dry so I had to add milk to it.

I just made these as gifts. They look wonderful. I taste-tested them before I made the gifts. They were wonderful and my neighbor's wife said he talked about them for four hours after I delivered some freshly baked cookeis.

I renamed them as suggested by other reviewers. 

Also, you can mix the butter, eggs, and vanilla. It does look funny for a few minutes, but if you are just patient and beat them (medium) for about 5 minutes, they start to fluffen up and look fine. 

I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of white chocolate. It worked fine. Also, I added a litte more pecans. I adjusted bake time to 10-12 minutes (more near 12 minutes). They were perfect!

My cookies came out delicious. Yummy!

Delicious cookies! If doubling the recipe, remember to double the ingredients shown in the directions also. Do not overbake -- the cookies will be too crispy if you do.

I loved the name and wanted a new cookie for our Christmas gift basket. We made a double batch and absolutely fell in love with these. If you make them from the jar recipe the egg and butter don't mix well, but it does not affect either the texture or flavor of the cookie. When I just want to make them I cream the butter with the sugars. Definitely have become one of our all time favorites.

Those cookies are delicious! What a great idea for Christmas gifts! I put all the ingredients in Kerr self sealing wide mouth mason jars and found that they fitted perfectly. I used some white and red white chocolate cookies to make the jars look more festive, - they are easy to find around Christmas. I also baked the cookies 10-12 min instead of the 8-10 min to make them even crunchier.

These are the MOST AMAZING COOKIES EVER!!!!  I've made them for gifts for year and my friends/family love getting them each year.  One year, I had just had a baby and my normal recipients were so sad not to get them. :)  They are lovely gifts, but I always make a few plates for our own house and they are devoured within a few days.  This year, I made a new label to go with them and I thought  I would share it with all of you.  I posted the document on to google.docs and you can get your own copy here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4h8DTMq0Mk2bFA5dWdDeDA3LWs/edit?usp=sharing

Make these TODAY - you will not be disappointed. :)

These were pretty in the jar but the cookies weren't anything special.  My kids didn't like them and didn't eat them.  My daughter entered them in our county fair and she didn't win a ribbon.  I'm not impressed at all.

Freaking awesome, I would also recommend interchanging the white chocolate for butterscotch chips. However, once I made them in the jar, I realized it did not fill it all the way up. = ( but the cookies are great tasting.

I just made this recipe exactly as stated (and you can "cream" butter and egg it just won't look to good) and it was fantastic.  Half the batch is gone - I will be making this jar for gifts!  P.S. Does anyone know what a hootycreek is?! :)

I just made the cookies for ourselves, but would definitely make the jars as gifts.  I used King Arthur organic whole wheat white flour, and the whole grain phobic daughter didn't notice a thing!  I also used both white and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Good cookie!

Doubled this recipe BUT didn't note the added 1/2 cup flour. Cookies were VERY flat and not what I'd call attractive. (but tasty). Will try again following directions this time. I Googled Hootycreek to see if I could find out the origin of the name. Still a mystery!

This is a delicious cookie!  I did find these needed to bake about 13-15 minutes in order to brown around the edges.  Very good!

First of all, I love the name.  Tasted delicious!  I needed to add an extra egg and a bit of water to make the dough scoopable but otherwise was a really easy recipe.  They disappeared the same night. Had to make another batch the next day!!!

These were good, kind of like oatmeal cookies with cranberries instead of raisins.  Took them to work to try them out before giving the premade jars as gifts and they were gone in no time. Thanks!

I brought these to work and everyone seemed to really like them. They are certainly unique, and I had multiple requests for the recipe. I didn't think they were that great, but that's probably because I don't really like nuts in my cookies. If I make them again for myself I'll omit the pecans.
I may add these to my Christmas cookie trays anyway because they were popular with my taste-testers, and it's always nice to offer something new.

This is an excellent cookie!  It fits perfectly in the jar & looks beautiful!  Even if you don't like cranberries you'll like this cookie.  The recipe is perfect as is.   No need to alter it in anyway.

These cookies are absolutely DELICIOUS!  The mix looks great in the jar, and is easy to put together.  I made a "tester" so I could prepare the cookies the same way I instucted on my gifts, and they turned out great!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I made these cookies to see if they were worth giving and I have to say they are THE BEST cookies I have ever had! They are awesome! As for the jar, the ingredients fit nicely in a 1 qt jar...I had no trouble making it all fit. I cut out 9 inch diameter cicles of christmas calico to screw on with the top and made decorative cards with the recipe and tied them on with ribbon. The jars look great! Thank you Susan!!!

I gave these as gifts and EVERYONE came back and asked for the "real" recipe!  I customized based on the person too, sometimes using all white chocolate, no nuts, sometimes all dark chocolate, etc.  GREAT idea!

I tried A LOT of different cookie mix in a jar recipes that I gave as Christmas gifts, and this one by far looked the nicest.  Everyone who tried these cookies loved them, and I have had several requests for the whole recipe.  Definitely recommended!

Wonderful cookies!  I used Craisins, and they turned out great!  I didn't have nuts on hand, so I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead.  I will use the nuts next time and replace half the white chocolate chips the recipe calls for with semi-sweet chips, since I think they added a lot to these cookies.  Too many white chocolate chips are a little too sweet for my taste!

I never made these in the jar - I just made them as part of my Christmas gift list.  They are incredibly good and very easy and definitely not time consuming.  They have a melt in your mouth like effect.  I substituted splenda for the sugar and it worked out very well.  Definitely, I will make these again.

I made a test batch of these cookies this weekend since I plan to give them to family for Christmas, and they are delicious!  They're a different kind of cookie, and very tasty.  I don't really understand the name of them, so I'll probably call them something different.  What is a hootycreek, anyway? Nonetheless, they are a great addition to our holiday food repertoire.

Made these to add to gift bags at Christmas.  Switched the layers around a little so the cranberries and white chocolate were in the middle.  I finished the tops off with material and rafia.  They were decorative and festive.  Next time I am saving some to bake at home!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe!  I made a jar of these for my grandmother for Christmas and she thought I bought it from a store because it was so beautiful.  It was definitely a huge hit.  I also made some of these ahead of time to try them out and they were wonderful.  I don't even like cranberries and I loved these cookies.  Everyone who tried them loved them.

These are wonderful.  Warm, cold, frozen and then thawed out, it doesn't matter, they're still great.  I would recommend mixing the dry ingredients together before you add them to the other.  Everyone that has tried them has loved them.

I gave several of these for gifts last Christmas. They certainly were a hit.  Not only because they were so decorative, but were absolutely delicious!!!  I have had 3 calls already this year for the complete recipe.  THANK YOU SUSAN!

I thought the dough was too dry.  After baking first pan of them I added a bit of milk to remaining dough--much better!  Probably not one I would make again though.

I've just spent a week "Kringling" a colleague at work - we give a small gift anonymously each day of the week to a randomly chosen member of the team.  It has been fun to have my "Kringlee" receiving a different small collection of ingredients every day.  Now her jar (actually a 1 Litre airtight plastic container) is full and looks very pretty.  The last day for gift-giving ("Kringling") is tomorrow - when she'll finally receive the baking instructions.  My wife and I just baked a batch and found them delicious.  We were a little concerned about the dryness of the dough, so added a lot more butter.  I have since read the comments about this being normal, but we didn't see how it could have worked.  Regardless, our cookies are still gorgeous, thanks. (Though probably much more fattening than the correct recipe).

I found most easily available jars (spagetti, peanut butter, etc.)to be 26 oz rather than 32 oz.  So I converted to a smaller recipe by reducing the number of servings.  Unfortunately, you have to be careful to reduce the quantities in the text of the recipe.  It would be nice if all of the ingredients were listed together so that all would be converted together.

I made gift jars last Christmas, and I have already had requests to repeat the gesture this year. The jars are easy to make, very attractive, and the resulting cookies are delicious! I've even sent email recipe cards to a number of people with this recipe.

I decided to try this recipe before I put it in a jar and gave it away.  Honestly, I was quite disappointed.  I didn't think they were that special or attractive.  Maybe in a jar they'd look nice, but they didn't meet up to my taste expectations.

I would recommend this recipe. Everyone I gave a 
jar to, said how pretty the jar is and how good the cookies are. I had fun putting the layers in the jar, and each jar had a character of their own.

I made the cookies according to the recipe, 18 cookies.  The cookies were far too big.  The next time I made them, I used a teaspoonful and made 36 cookies.  They looked much bette and produce more.  I gave six "cookies in a jar", (the Hootycreeks were the only ones that fit the jars I bough) talong with the recipe and I made sure I changed the instructions to say 36 cookies.

Pretty good recipe.  Doesn't make a lot of cookies but they're tasty!  I divided the white chocolate chip amount in half and added chocolate chips as well.

I love these cookies!  Very nice combination of white chocolate chips and cranberries.  I took them to work, and everyone loved them!  I also prepared several of these cookie mixes in a jar for gifts.  They are so pretty!  I prepared several of these cookie in a jar recipes, and this one is my favorite!  I especially like their name. :)

Hi! This is my recipe from years ago. It is my daughter's favorite cookie. They are called Cranberry Hootycreeks because that is the name of the road I live on (which is named for the creek behind my home .... which is a meeting place for barn owls and their mates who stay together for life, but do not stay together outside of mating season. They come sit in the trees and call to one another...it makes the creek very hooty. Enjoy and be blessed!

I made these up at the start of the year for our church youth group girl's birthday gifts, and they were terrific! This is the "prettiest" laying cookie mix I could find, and was honestly a little worried they might not taste as good as they look. That was absolutely not the case though; these cookies are delicious! Rave reviews from all the girls and leaders. Absolutely recommend!

Phenomenal! However, I accidentally purchased 60 oz jars rather than the recommended 32 oz jar. Doubling the recipe comes out perfectly to the top with no room to spare! On my tag, I added freeze and have another quick batch of Hootycreeks!

I made these as a trial run last night.  We have a nut allergy in our house, so I doubled the chocolate chips.  I liked the way they turned out.  I was thinking that I might try some with cranberries and pistachios or maybe dried cherries and semi-sweet chocolate chips.

Made these for the second time for Christmas gifts!  I used a large-mouth quart-size Mason jar as instructed, but there wasn't room for the pecans, so I left them out...which works out pretty well since I'm always worried about food allergies.  If you layer the ingredients as listed, you can stop at the cranberry layer and SMOOSH down using a small gravy ladle. That'll give you enough room to add the white chocolate chips.  If you don't have room for pecans (like me!), you can add a note to the recipe card to add 1/2 c. of chopped pecans if desired.

Made this as a Christmas gift idea for my two Granddaughters.  They are both young ( 9 & 10)and a little special family time in the kitchen is always a great time. Might even impress their cookie loving friends.

Advice not to overstuff the cookies with add-ins, otherwise it's all crunch and not enough dough to hold it together. Very filling. These did not spread on the baking sheet.

I made up some jars to hand out as gifts, and I tried one out tonight.  While they look nice and tasted pretty good, I had trouble getting it to form into a dough until I added about 3 tablespoons of water.  The butter, egg and vanilla made a mess that never incorporated with the contents of the jar until the water was added, one tablespoon at a time.

I used walnuts instead of pecans and I mixed it all with a mixer.  They were delicious.  I also made them into gift jars using quart jars (cheapest at Costco.)  I did not pack the ingredients and they filled a quart jar nicely.

I gave the recipe in the jars for Christmas gifts to friends a few years ago and they loved the cookies. I  rounded out the ingredients so even my sister who is not a cook, was able to make them. I put a fancy holiday fabric on the top and tied with a matching ribbon. I also made several other cookie mixes from this site but, Hootycreeks were the favorite.

These cookies came out so good! Don’t like nuts so just took then out and since I had semisweet chocolate chips at home I just subbed that for the white chips. Since I changed those two ingredients I had to reorder the layers in the jar just to make it look nice. They were delicious and such an easy gift for people!

Very tasty! I increased to make 24 and used 2 lrg eggs.  They turned out excellent.  Note:  The dough seems to dry at first but with a little extra stirring effort, comes together very nice.  
Thank you very much for sharing your recipe. I'm sure my gift receivers will love them!

I received a jar of these as a gift for Christmas and after making them, they are my new favorite cookie!  Absolutely amazing.  I just made a batch but selfishly, they are in the oven baking...not in a gift jar!

I don't think they are the most flavorful cookie I've eaten.  They needed something to spice them up a little.  Otherwise it was an easy to make cookie.

4 15 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/15262/cranberry-hootycreeks/ ... 'Hate to be the partypooper, but, while these taste good, they were a mess baking.  'Pretty sure I didn't make a mistake with measuring, but  I suppose it's possible.  ;D  I refriged overnight, balled 'em & they spread, spread, spread. - eventhough I didn't grease the pan.  I baked a similar recipe immediately before so there was a tiny-tiny bit left from the cookies, but I didn't grease before those either.  If I try again, I'll just add more oats &/or flour.  A while later:  'Haven't tried again, but since no one else mentioned the spreading problem, maybe I added too little flour.  The butter part I know was right.  I liked these more than the other very similar recipe I tried - same day.  E liked both. Note:  http://allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/63047029/cranberry-oatmeal-almond-vanilla-chip-cookies/ ...

I made these a couple of times and the kids loved them. I went out of town and my daughter asked for the recipe. I said it was a secret...She made the recipe on the back of the Craisins package which is close to this but not the same and they just didn't cut it. These ROCK!

These cookies are incredible! I only got 18 cookies out of one batch, so I had to double it... because I ate six by myself. ;) I'm not a huge pecan fan, so I replaced them with thin sliced almonds, and they were fantastic. This is now one of my favorite cookies!

I received this as a gift over the holidays.  Just made the cookies and they are SO GOOD!!  I'm personally not a big fan of  getting these types of gifts where I have to bake the item, but it was a cute jar, and the cookies really are amazing.  I'll be making them again sans the jar...

I made this the last two years and had hard time  finding them this year .  I printed it out this morning. When making them for family I put  apercot, dates, raisins, and cranberries. It's best to double the recipe. They disappear fast . Great recipe.  Kate

These are delicious. I tried making them with coconut oil instead of butter, and they turned out wonderful. I only had mini semisweet chocolate chips on hand so I used those instead of white. Also added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  Really tasty, thick, and chewy!

Oh, my goodness, these are wonderful gifts!  I used a 750ml hinged lid jar from the dollar store and the recipe just filled the jar to the top.  I attached festive ribbon, berries, a pine branch and a direction card to the rim, put a chalkboard label on the top and they look fantastic!

Been making these for years! Got them as a gift a long time ago, almost too pretty to eat-but not quite! I made them as gifts for all the family this last year, except I'm not really a fan of nuts in my cookies so I left those out. I do wish I had done what some had suggested and mixed the brown sugar in with some white before you put it in the jar, it's hard to get all the brown sugar mixed in throughly otherwise as its compacted and you get little chunks of brown sugar in your dough.

Very good, and not too sweet.  I used Truvia baking blend in place of the white sugar, and whole wheat flour instead of AP.  I also used black walnuts instead of pecans. 

I think butterscotch morsels instead of white chocolate might be a nice change.

I made this today I had to try them myself the cookies were delicious .the only thing I changed was I added 1 more egg and had to bake longer than the suggested time . I got nineteen cookies but 24 would gave been easy to get from the recipe which may have made baking time less then 15-17 min. The cookies were large and they did spread out, probably due to adding a second egg . None the less they were delicious . Now off to make some gifts !

I made 50 of these as favors and as the seating chart for my October wedding.  They were a huge hit!  Not only did they look gorgeous on the tables, they tasted amazing too.  I get requests on holidays for "the wedding cookies" and people still ask for the recipe a year later.  I'm definitely gifting these to people who didn't attend the wedding this year and years to come!

The first time I made these cookies, I had to omit the nuts due to visiting allergy sufferers.  The cookies were a huge disappointment. Very bland and I was not about to give this recipe as a gift and would not rate above a two.
Today I made them again with the nuts and they are soo much better. So, not sure if that made so much of a difference or what but something went wrong the first time around. I think that today, they turned out the way they are supposed to.
With the recipe as written, I got 16 large cookies which took 12 mins to cook.

I made these with my grandchildren, they loved them, but were too sweet for my taste.  They were a little thin.  I don't like white cho. chips, will probably use dark cho. next time.  Grandkids loved the name.

Very good cookie. My jars are FAR too big for these recipes, maybe double and it will fit. I made these as a practice, to ensure they taste good. I didnt have pecans, so without that. They  taste pretty good, BUT baking at 350 almost burned the bottoms (baked for 6 min) and the middles were still too soft. So I decreased the temp to 320 and baked my next batch for 8 min. Turned out PERFECT. the bottoms were golden and they were still chewy. Maybe my oven is just overly hot, but 350 was WAY too high a temp. Other than that GREAT!

FANTASTIC cookie in a jar recipe. The preparation in terms of layering the ingredients in the jar is always a bit of a chore but the jars look SO pretty and I've gotten more compliments on the cookies than on any other jar recipe I've done.  BIG hit at Christmastime!

This is a holiday favorite in my house.  I give them as "jar gifts" every year and they are always a big hit.

The jars turned out great! They look fantastic and will serve wonderfully as co-worker gifts. I haven't baked the recipe yet, but I have enough leftovers too!

Delicious! Made two of our other favorites types of cookies in the same sitting, but this one got eaten up the fastest. Definitely a Christmas keeper.

I made 12 Mason jars full today for Christmas presents for coworkers and friends. After making these beautiful holiday treats in a jar, I decided to sample a recipe and they were sooooo good! My husband (who normally doesn't like white chocolate) loved them. Definately a keeper!

I do these every year for the preschool staff.  They all start asking for them by end of November.  The cookies are really to die for and they look nice and festive in the jar.

Plus, it's fun for the kids to help with.

These are excellent!  My father-in-law is always asking me to make them for him.  And the fact that I can put them in a festive jar for gifts is a great idea as well.  Thanks so much!

These are some of my favorite jar cookies to give as gifts. It makes a pretty jar, and the cookies are fantastic.  I use the parchment paper to help them bake evenly.

What an awesome cookie!  I chose to just make the recipe, not give them as a gift (though I plan to in  the future).  We don't like nuts so replaced the nuts with more chips and cranberries, and when I prepared them, I mixed the butter and sugars, added the egg and vanilla, stirred in the flour, salt and baking soda and then mixed in the chips and cranberries with my hands.  They were just delicious, perfect in every way!  I wasn't sure if you're supposed to use fresh or dried cranberries so I used dry. Anyone know?  Oh yeah, and someone complained that the cookies were too big and they recommended making 36 small ones... one batch made 12 cookies for me, how embarassing that mine are so big! :oD

My Town has Black Walnut Festival coming up and I was put in charge of filling gift baskets for raffle. I found this recipe for a cookie in a jar mix and though, mmm, I could substitute Black Walnuts for the Pecans. So I did. When I made the test batch, they were AWESOME!! Alot of people don't like black walnuts, but in these cookies, their taste is nicely complemented by the sweet/sour of the cranberries and the creaminess of the white chocolate.
I plan on making up a whole bunch of these for Christmas for my Family, not sure if I'll still use the black walnuts (they are hard to find and much more expensive), but I have ever confidence they will be awesome no matter what nuts I use!!

found nothing too special about these except for the ingredient cost.  not something I would make often. I found it was your basic chocolate cookie recipe with cranberries and white chips. FIL really liked them.

I made this for all my family and friends for Christmas gifts and had several requests for the recipe.  I bought Christmas plaid material to put under the mason jar seals and tied a bright ribbon on top.  The dough was a little crumbly so I recommended they mix with their hands and had them add an extra 1/2 cup of butter.  They taste fantastic!

A great twist on the oatmeal cookie. Sometimes I like to use chocolate chips instead of white chocolate chips. Easy for kids to make as gifts.

This past Christmas, I wanted to make jar cookies for the hard to buy people in my family. Of course, I taste tested the cookies before assembling. 

These were great!  My husband and son just loved them. They did seem a little flat though. I baked them on the Pampered Chef stone, so that may have contributed.  It did seem to take longer than expected, anywhere from 9-20 minutes. This recipe is now a new family favorite.

Gave them away for Christmas gifts and everyone loved them!  I made them a couple time - using a different oven in each case.  My baking time varied from 9 minutes to close to 15.  So I guess you just need to watch them closely for the right time for you.  I also had a bit of extra room (about 3/4") at the top of my jars.  I won't pack it down so much next time because it made the stuff mix together while driving to deliver and the display wasn't as good as it could have been.  Still - the taste is incredible!

Thank you so much for this recipe!  I admit, the only reason I initially considered making these was because of the great name.  I wanted to give away a few 'homemade' gifts to friends, and this one picqued my interest.  I made the cookies before giving them away, and they were delicious!  I agree that mixing it all up with your hands is much easier.  Also, the cookies definitely do not spread much on their own, so if you want a flatter cookie, you should flatten them down a bit once they are on the sheet. And it was beautiful in the jar.  My 2 year-old was very proud to be able to 'help' make so many gifts.

A wonderful, jazzed-up oatmeal cookie.  The dough didn't seem like it would come together, but with a LOT of fairly hard cutting in, it did.  I think I will try the dough hook or paddle on the stand mixer next time.  As one other reviewer mentioned, I, too, had to bake for 13 - 14 minutes.  Will make these again.

I never got around to actually eating one of these cookies but the recipe was extremely easy to pack and prepare into a jar. I think i used a larger jar than stated because the ingredients fitted into the jar with extra room even without packing the ingredients down.

Made these for Christmas.  These are so good.  I used craisins for the cranberries, walnuts instead of pecans and milk chocolate chips instead of white as these were the ingredients I had on hand.  I ended up using my hands to mix all together, but didn't think the dough was any drier than any oatmeal cookie.  Dropped by rounded teaspoons onto cookie sheet, as I like smaller cookies and they did spread a little during baking.  I really like the hint of oatmeal in these.  My adult kids liked these too.  These will be on my list of cookies to make for Christmas' in the future.

I made these as a new cookie for the family rather than as a gift. I overlooked the oddity of flour listed twice thinking it was needed for layering if a gift, however, in hindsight, I wonder if the measure of flour is incorrect. The batter was so crumbly that I had to roll it into a log in wax paper & refrigerate. We baked them today & the possibility for a great cookie is there -- next time, I'll add a slight bit of liquid (maybe brandy!) but they did not spread & were dry.

Used Planters huge can of pecan halves and bits from a membership warehouse, so I ommitted salt from the recipe. Used Craisins, and substituted "swirl" chips for the white choc. chips. I'm sure any type can be used. I found it is best to use hands to really mix the ingredients well. I made up a batch and my husband saw oats and said "ew", but then he tried them and finished half the batch by himself! I ate the other half. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!!

The presentation in the jar is beautiful, they look so festive!!!!  We had to try a batch ourselves before giving them away.  I was initially a little worried because they seemed dry, but they baked up really nice and tasted great.

Haven't tried to bake the cookies yet.  I made them for gifts and I can say they look really pretty in the jars ready to go.  All I could find were 1 liter jars (I live in Canada) and there's a good inch of space left in the jar, so I'm worried the layers might get mixed up before I can give them away.  Next time I am in the US I will try and find quart jars for next year.

I made these outright not just put the ingredients in a jar.  These are really good cookies!  I used slated pecans and salted butter so I omitted the salt.  They flatten out while baking so give them room.  I got 3dz cookies.  They stay very pale and pretty.  The crandberry give the cookie a nice tangy surprise.  Very good.

These cookies are so good! My mom, sister and entire family clammor for them. I've never gotten the chance to give them as a gift, I just make the recipe and bake it right away. Now that I've found the recipe again it's time to bake up a batch -- immediately!

It was a great recipe, but very dry! I had to add a bit more liquid to make it scoopable. I made double batches and found that the scoopability and taste was PERFECT when doubled, but very dry when done as only one batch. I would totally recommend it though!

These cookies are excellent...and a great gift to give as well!  I did the following when making the "cookies in a jar": used a quart-sized mason jar, did not pack ingredients as I was filling the jar, but I did pack some of the ingredients when MEASURING (brown sugar, cranberries, flour), and I also layered the ingredients this way: white sugar, brown sugar, 1/2 c. flour, baking soda & salt, nuts (I used walnuts), cranberries, white choc. chips, oats, and 5/8 c. flour.  Towards the top I had to pack the ingredients slightly to fit everything in the jar, but just a little.  I also just called the cookies "Cranberry Cookies".  :)

Okay, I realize I'm in the minority but I was really disappointed in this recipe.  I love cranberries and thought this would have that nice little tang but they were so-so at best.  I make a cherry cookie that is similar to this but much more flavorful.  I'm sure they look pretty in a gift jar but I just wanted to make the cookie since it got such great reviews.  Sorry but this one is not a keeper for me.

I was so excited to try these based on the reviews.  Nobody loves a good cookie more than me!  So I was disappointed when I bit into this.  A not-quite oatmeal cookie confused by the cranberry and chocolate.  Even my 2 yr old didn't like it.

I just made a batch of these cookies. They taste great and are perfect for Xmas gifts. While I am not a cranberry or white chocolate lover, I really liked the cookie. The flavors blend well together and are not overpowering. Susan, this one is a winner! Thanks! :-)

Just as the other reviewers said, these were a big hit for Christmas gifts.  I gave away all the jars I prepared, but I was finally able to taste the cookies my friend made.  They are delicious.  I will start earlier next year and make more for gifts.  Very pretty in the jar, and everyone raved about them.

These were fabulous. I'm sure they would look lovely in a jar as a gift. I skipped that step and made them as part of my Christmas cookie plates for friends and neighbors. They were very well received.

Excellent cookie, loved even by my teens
who don't usually eat cranberries or nuts.  Baked better on parchment; spread too much on ungreased cookie sheet.  Caramelized edges were really good though :-)

great tasting and easy to make.  The only trouble I had was mine didn't spread out as much.  So, I had to flatten the tops of the dough before putting them into the oven.  Not sure why that happened.  Thanks for sharing.

MMMMMMMMM so good!! These are incredible cookies and a beautiful gift. We made the jars up last year as teacher and neighbor gifts and received many glowing reports and thanks. I have purchased all the ingredients to do it again this year. (And just to remind myself how good they are, I made a batch for us to eat tonight!)  I have to make one small change, and that is to switch the baking soda to baking powder. Living at 5000ft altitude, my cookies don't "fluff" unless I make this substitution.

Of all of the cookie mixes I've given as gifts, this is the most popular.  I changed the name to "Cranberry Christmas-creeks" and use it for holiday giving.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The taste is outstanding! Good alternative to chocolate chip cookies. I like this combination of dried cranberries, white chocolate and nuts!! I will try them with roasted macademia nuts. Favourite recipe; didn't put it in a jar yet but MUST give it to someone as a present! ***** now five years later, I still make these cookies! Sometimes I roll them into a ball and flatten them. They look prettier that way. I always keep the dry ingredients in a jar, so I only have to cream the egg and butter, and put the mix in. Very easy.

All I can say is YUMMMMMIEEE! I made a batch of these cookies and they were awesome and gift jars were such a huge hit. I think it was because of the different ingredients, not you typical chocolate chips and oatmeal cookies.

This recipe has been in my recipe box a long time just waiting for me to try it out for the holidays. Rather than make the jars...I just baked the cookies for a carry in at work. And I am so glad I did. They are great! I didn't add the nuts but they were still wonderful. Chewy and full of interesting tastes. I'll be making these again and again.

I trippled the recipe and made a large batch. They were delicious.  I baked them about 8 min. they were soft and chewy. I will be making gift jars for several people for Christmas. I will make them again.

I'm from Australia and cranberries are impossible to get here...I thought this recipe looked unusual, so I tried it with a kind of sweetened, dried cranberry that just came out. Sadly, the cookies were pretty ordinary. Looks like you need the real thing to make these zing!

My friends really liked this cookie. The white
chocolate chips were a surprise to everyone, but
it worked out well with the cranberries. The cookies turned out really flat and the oatmeal was not apparent, but the cookie was yummy. Thanks!

Loved this recipe! Gave several for Christmas presents and have made it several times for home.  Originally downloaded because of the name -- I just had to have a 'hootycreek'!
