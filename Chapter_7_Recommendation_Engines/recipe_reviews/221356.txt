I made these lebkuchen for my classmates for German class.  I like the taste of citron but it's not available for a few weeks yet.  I was not so sure about using apricots and dates but I have to say, these cookies were fabulous.  My classmates ate them up, asked to bring some home--in other words, they were a huge hit.  I'm definitely making these for Christmas!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  My only regret is that I didn't have a day or two to let them sit--I bet they just get better with time.

I made a bunch of these to be included with other various cookies as xmas gifts. I love cookies with lots of cloves/cardamom/nutmeg. Very seasonal flavors and so this seemed like a great one. I'm a novice baker at best though and maybe some of my issues are from that but I found these to be a serious undertaking to make. There are so many elements... if you are planning on making these just be ready to sweat. I've run 10k marathons where I didn't work this hard! First, just buy pre-skinned almonds. Second, buy pre-pitted/chopped dates. Third be prepared to make 3 to 4 times as much icing because these cookies were really not very sweet at all, they are a little dense. The end result is ok, they go pretty well with coffee. I will probably not make these again though.

My husband is from a German family and he buys a lot of commercial lebkuchen. So I decided to try this recipe and was really looking forward to tasting it based on the yummy ingredients.  I found the cookies to be rather dry and not very sweet. The glaze helped a little. Perhaps after they sit for a day the flavours will develop but usually gingerbread just tends to get drier.
