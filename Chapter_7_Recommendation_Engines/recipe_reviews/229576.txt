Instant coffee isn't my preference, but it does work in a pinch. This recipe is one where you can easily change any of the ingredients to suit what you like.

Quick and easy to make. A little on the flavorless side. Don't think I will make again.

I love these spices in coffee, but they are better when brewed with fresh coffee. Although this wasn't the greatest, the title did say quick. For instant coffee, these spices add some nice flavor. I used 1 equal packet in place of the sugar, and it was sweetened just right for me. Also, I added a pinch each of cinnamon and cloves on top of the whipped cream. Thanks for a quick idea to spruce up instant coffee.

I like the flavor. I'm going to try cold brew method
and  put spice in a coffee filter and tie it off with a stripe off the edge of the filter, float it in the coffee. just single, double, triple exc. per serving  of cold brew.

This recipe was so simple, but full of great flavor. Instead of microwaving the mixture, I warmed it up over the stove.

My family went nuts over it! This will now be a family tradition!

Tasted like flavored water and trying to add flavor didn't help at all.
