Please try this. Yes I'm the author and no it's not gourmet but for moms on the go it works. On the weekends I would make my own spagehetti sauce but we don't always have the luxury. Definitely add in the garlic I usually do two crushed.

Not great...do yourself a favor and make your own tomato sauce with a good recipe such as Mariana.

I love this recipe and use it quite often when I don't know what to make for dinner. I usually have all of the ingredients in the house. I didn't change the ingredients in the recipe at all but I do take short cuts like I don't simmer it as long or layer it. I just add the mushroom soup to the saucepan and mix the cheese in with the noodles before pouring the sauce over the top of the noodles. I do save some cheese for the top too. It usually tastes better the second day for that reason but I am a working mom and if I spend 2 1/2 hours cooking dinner we won't eat until 7 or 8.

My Mom used to make something similar when I was a kid so I was craving it the other day. It was great! Did not disappoint. I did modify it a little but only because of what I had on hand here at home. I added a bit of fresh minced garlic & instead of water I used milk in with the soup & sauce. I omitted the cheese only because I didn't have it on hand. It turned out terrific and the two men in my house said it was the best spaghetti they ever tasted. I served it with crusty bread....making for great 'spaghetti sandwiches'. YUMMY!

I had an interesting taste. I didn't have all that time to wait for the sauce (1 hour.) Just took too much time over all.

My family really enjoyed this dish! I made it as written with some left over sauce I had from a large event. This recipe is so versatile- you could even add some veggies.

Absolutely loved it wasn't sure about the cream of mushroom soup but was pleasantly surprised. Did alter slightly instead of water or milk I added heavy cream. Delicious!
