This one had a little too much sugar in it for our tastes.  It also definitely needed the optional salt and the addition of a little ground black pepper as well.

This will be added to my rotation of ways to cook salmon!  I used a little less than 1/4 cup brown sugar and about 4tsp olive oil and 2 large cloves of garlic.  This was so delicious but I think I could have even less brown sugar!  I was surprised the flavors didn't overpower the salmon!  Definitely worth trying!!

Please explain how this is "healthy".  Brown sugar and soy sauce?  Plus option for ADDING salt?  This might be a tasty dish indeed but certainly not healthy.

This was Perfect for me.  Tangy and sweet, didn't overpower the fish.  I will be making this one again.

My husband has early onset heart disease, so we have changed our diet a lot. We eat fish at least twice a week. It is hard because we are not big fish eaters. This is the best salmon recipe that I have found. I marinate it and grill it. It is delicious and simple.

the taste was great!  the salt and sugar make we wonder how healthy it was.  I think I'll try again using less sugar.  I din't 'use the lemon zest and it was still very tasty.

Made it just like the recipe was written. Wouldn't change a thing. Great recipe.
