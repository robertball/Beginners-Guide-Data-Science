This is delish! My mum said that it tasted like a chocolate sponge cake. however, we both agree that it's a tad too sweet, as there was this sweet aftertaste. the next time I make this, I'll reduce the sugar to 2 tbsp. (then again, we never liked stuff that was too sweet.) Also, I didnt make the icing.

Something to note - this batter only made 9 "muffins"/buns!

These are so cute to look at! I made them in my mini muffin pan to make bite sized butterflies ;). This cake is so light with lovely strong chocolate taste, which hit me at the very end. Since I don't keep self rising flour on hand I used 1 cup All-Purpose flour plus 1 1/2 tsps baking powder and 1/8 tsp salt. I used raspberry jam cause that's what I had on hand (plus it's my favourite flavour) and I only made half the frosting recipe which turned out to be just enough. It didn't come out too sweet because of that, but the surprise in the middle was very nice to bite into. Thanks for the great idea and recipe!

Pet's liquid measuring tools must be larger than what they say, because this whole thing is too dry.
The cocoa water mix was too dry to actually mix, needed at LEAST twice as much water for that, but still looked like it wasn't moist enough.  However, I have no idea what the consistency for that should be, so perhaps it was supposed to be dry and I made it wrong.  
Needed to add about a quarter cup extra water at the end, as the recipe acknowledges.
Icing in the picture is almost runny, (which could be because the 'bun' is still hot, in which case, they ignored their own directions to allow it to cool), my icing was almost as thick as for an oreo, and I used less icing sugar than it called for.
I used all margarine, which should have way more moisture than the optional butter.

The taste is bland, and the only reason this doesn't get a 1 is because the flavors go well together, and the presentation is neat.

I made two batches the same day, for a kiddie party. The first time I followed all the instructions, and my butterfly buns came out cracked and crumbly and not particularly sweet. Oh, and I got just about six out of the batter.
The second time, I doubled all the ingredients, mixed the cocoa powder in the flour rather than with hot water, and used half a cup of milk, half of fresh cream. Used strawberry jam instead of cherry and my own icing recipe. The texture and taste were improved. Really like its presentation, that's why the three stars. But don't take this up unless you have time and patience to spare!
