I use Chili no beans, Mexi-corn, Old Fashion Vegetable Soup, Tomato Soup and Mild Rotel Tomatoes. I break tortilla chips into pieces and put in individual bowls. Pour the soup over the tortillas and top with shredded cheese. My family loves it!!!

Sometimes you just want quick and easy and this fits the bill. I left out the vegetable soup because I didn't think it would add much but I added an extra can of beans because canned chili never has enough beans in my opinion.  I topped it with shredded jack & cheddar cheese.  Husband said we should have it again.

My husband liked this, but I didn't like it as much. One thing is that I assume the recipe is calling for condensed tomato and vegetable beef soups, since it says the 10.75 oz cans. All I could really taste was the condensed soup at first. So, I added one 10.75 oz can full of water, and it was much better. The Ro-tel definitely made this recipe. It gave it a nice flavor. (However, it made it too spicy for my 5 year old to eat it. Oh well.) I had left over homemade chili, so I used the equivalent amount of that instead of a can. Overall, it tasted okay as long as you add some water, and I liked it best with corn chips on top.
