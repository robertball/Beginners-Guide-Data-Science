Very good and quick to prepare. Halved the chipotle peppers and chili powder, only as our preference because we like food moderately spicy.

It was late or early depending on your view and I had all these ingredients. I was so hungry and this was so tasty, so wonderful! Woohoo! I never measure spices, I dump em in. I did not use much cinnamon 'cause I don't like it. And I used the whole can of poblanos which made it quite spicy but super great. I got a recipe for tortilla strips from another recipe, burned em and it was still good! Yeah!
