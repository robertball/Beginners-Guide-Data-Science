The chorizo adds some zing to an otherwise bland dish. Very yummy over brown rice.

We totally loved this recipe and would make it again when I have all the ingredients.  I did everything as described with the exception of being out of basil so I substituted rosemary.  The result is very much stew and very meaty and rich.  The chicken falls off the bones at that point.  It is easy to fish out the extra bones and pieces of skin while in the pot and before serving.  We had it with medium shell pasta noodles.  And yes, it is just as good the next day.

My family liked this recipe.  but I don’t like chorizo so I substituted andouille sausage, and instead of cayenne, I used chipotle powder. I also cut the chipotle powder in half to ease the heat a little.  I also substituted nonfat Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream to lighten it up a little without affecting the flavor.

Wow, perfectly spiced heat.  Love this over rice.  Leftovers reheated the next day were even better.  Recommend without hesitation and no modification.

Good stew! Only substitution I used was using Chicken Breasts and low sodium cream of chicken soup. Good flavor and will make again!

I've made this recipe about a dozen times. It's an immense hit with everyone. Only change I made was a reduction of the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp.
Make sure to use fresh chorizo sausage not the precooked, dry version.
Fantastic stew/soup

It took way more than 30 minutes to prep this dish; and it came out with a layer of fat over it and no taste.  The only taste it had was spicy - could not taste anything else.  Wasted chicken had to throw this out.

This is a great base recipe. I used 3 chicken breasts (we raise our own meat) instead of thighs and cut out the sausage. The other tweaks I did were to use 3X as much homemade stock, low sodium soups, half the cayenne (hubby doesn't like spicy), another half tsp on the spices and low fat sour cream. it made 2 dinners and 2 lunches for us. It was delicious!! The chicken melted in our mouths. I will definitely do this again!

I used the mild Chorizo sausage to tone down the heat and it was still quite spicy. My husband loved it!

When finished, it had an inch of grease on top, was colorless and flavorless.   I cannot recommend at all.

EXCELLENT!!!  Served it with garlic sautéed spinach from this site.  And no cayenne added as I figured I had enough spice already.

I was disappointed because I was expecting chicken stew. Too spicy and missing something.

Much, much spicier than I was expecting, but otherwise great.  Next time I make, I will halve the Cajun and cayenne.
