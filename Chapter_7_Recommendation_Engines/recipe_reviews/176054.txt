At the end, fold in a small container of Extra Creamy Cool Whip - don't whisk it! If you have only large boxes of pudding, just double the measurements of the other ingredients. You can stick them in the freezer so they taste like soft serve ice cream.

Flavored vodkas create tons of flavor combination possibilities:

Chocolate pudding w/ black cherry vodka
Vanilla pudding w/ orange vodka
Cheesecake pudding w/ cherry vodka
Chocolate pudding w/ espresso vodka

I'd love to see what other combinations people have tried!

I rated this a good start but you left out a very important ingredient to make it set right. 1/2 of an 8oz container of cool whip is the right amount needed for this (size)recipe. I've tried many different drink versions. white russian using kahlua & vodka & van pudding. Mudslides are choc pudding, w/kahlua, vodka & any Irish cream. Appletini's use apple pucker, vodka & van pudding. Washington apple, apple pucker & whiskey, Buttery nipples, use butterscotch pudding , choc liquor, kahlua & ameretto. Tiramisu seems to be my friends favorite. Van pudding, kahlua & ameretto. You could also make the pudding & instead of making shots make it a trifle with lady fingers for the tiramisu & pound cake or brownies for the rest of the different puddings. Add layers of cake, pudding shot mixes & cool whip, repeat layers. Fruit such as strawberries & bananas can also be added. If you want to make virgin style use 2 cups of flavored international creamers instead of the liquor & the milk. It tastes just as good(like there is liquor in them) & no one will know the difference. The creamer actually makes it better. I use 1/2 creamer & 1/2 liquor. Since experimenting I no longer use milk at all.

As others have noted - a tub of Cool Whip is also necessary for this recipe.  I have used regular or Extra Creamy and both work fine!  I've also used 1% milk and no taste difference.  And I only use 3/4 cup of milk at that.  I've never adjusted other amounts even if I've used larger box of pudding.  Don't limit yourself to Irish Cream and Vokda for alcohol choices.  Sub out the Vodka for things like coffee liqueur (like Starbucks) or even Gold Schlagger.  Some combos that are fantastic:  -	Choc Pud + 1/2 c. Blackberry Schnapps + 1/4 c. Vodka -OR-- Choc w/ Caramel Chips Pud + 1/2 c. Caramel Baileys + 1/4 c. Starbucks Liquor --OR--	Oreo Pudding + 1/2 c. Reg Baileys + 1/4 c. Vodka  --OR--Butterscotch Pudding + 1/2 c.Baileys + 1/8 c. Goldschlagger (it's too strong to use more) -- OR -- Pumpkin Pud + 1/2 c. Caramel Baileys + 1/4 c. Starbucks Liquor  The sky is the limit on combinations!!!

I get request to make these as I have been making them for years. I only gave it 4 stars because the cool whip was not listed as an ingredient. This is a must. Just fold in one container after you are done mixing. Then, I freeze them overnight. They taste like spiked chocolate ice cream!!!

Don't expect these to be like pudding.... they are a creamy shot, made to drink, not eat. This recipe is great because of the ratio of liquor to milk.  I used instant Pumpkin Spice pudding, 1 cup milk, 3/4 C Butterscotch Schnapps and 1/4 C vanilla vodka, I also used 1 Tbls of Cinnamon Schnapps, and it tasted like pumpkin pie with a kick.  We added a little whipped cream to the top before serving. They were gone in seconds.

I made these for New Years and the crowd LOVED them!  I'm only giving this recipe a four star since you really need to add the Extra Creamy Cool Whip.  The consistency is like ice cream.  I made a batch of vanilla using vanilla vodka with Bailey's and a batch of chocolate using the same vanilla vodka and Kahula in place of Bailey's.

I use 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup booze with the Cool Whip and it sets up fine.  I use cream cheese pudding and raspberry vodka.

I rated it low stars because he forgot to list the cool whip as an ingredient. I followed the others advice and added an 8oz container of cool whip. Also I cut the milk down to 3/4 cup. I also used vanilla rum instead of vodka. I whisked the pudding mix, milk, rum, Irish cream together, then folded in the cool whip. Spooned it into 2oz shooter cups, it started to set even before I had all of it in the cups, then put it in the freezer to finish setting. It made 28 shooters. The rum has a smoother taste than vodka, not as much alcohol bite. It has the consistency of chocolate moose with the feel good effect of rum. I didn't use any name brands, except the Kraft Cool Whip, it was the off brand rum, instant pudding mix, milk, and Irish cream, but it was all good. Got rave reviews from the people at the party.

I have been making these for years and made a total of 467 (4 different flavors) for 4th of July last year. The original recipe that I use is 1 sm pack choco pudding-3/4 c milk- 1/4 c vodka- 1/2 c baileys - 8 oz cool whip. 
Some people complained of this recipe being to strong and that is because you are using equal parts vodka/baileys and that's not correct. You can taste them as you are making them to add more alcohol. I always freeze mine overnight otherwise they get to runny to fast.

I use whipping cream instead of milk, and an electric mixer instead of whisking.  It gives the recipe the mousse consistency without adding the cool whip.  My favorite combination is chocolate pudding and creme de menthe.

These were awesome!  I did follow others' suggestion and add cool whip to them.  I made four types: 
tiramisu (van. pudding, 1/2 cup kahlua, 1/2 cup amaretto); 
oatmeal cookie (pumpkin pudding, 1/2 cup vanilla vodka, 1/2 cup butterscotch schnapps); 
tropical (banana pudding, 1/2 cup blue pucker, 1/2 cup coconut rum);
chocolate cherry (choc. pudding, 3/4 cup black cherry vodka, 1/4 cup amaretto).
I used 1/2 of an 8 oz container of cool whip for each, and let them sit outside for 4 hours (it was below freezing here), and they were thick but not mousse-like.  We ate them with spoons, and everyone loved them!

I wish I'd read the review before I made these.  I'd planned to use these to fill chocolate cupcakes frosted w/Bailey's butter cream.  However, this NEVER set.  It's still in our frig in a liquid state.  Now that I've read the reviews, I'll pick up a tub of Cool Whip and fold it in...it's too late for the cupcakes, but I'll still serve it as shooters!  It's VERY strong; hopefully the Cool Whip will take the edge of a bit.

If you want them to be a mousse consistency use only 1 cup of milk and no Cool Whip but if you prefer them to be an icecream consistency use 2 cups of milk as directed on the instant pudding box. For my recipe I used 1-3.4 ounce box instant chocolate pudding and 1 cup of Tequila Rose Cocoa Cream, 3/4 cup of Vodka (because we're not big fans of Vodka in this recipe) and if you want them to set use at least 1 cup of Cool Whip and cover whatever container/s you put them in. Best if left in freezer overnight. I also prepare another version of my recipe using Vanilla Instant Pudding, Tequila Rose Strawberries and Cream and add Grenandine to the mix until I reach the desired color of pink I want. If you do not use the Grenandine they tend to look a greyish color.

They tasted good a little strong though. I used vanilla vodka. The consistence was a little off. Threw must of them away. I’ll probably try it again. Not sue what ill do next. The recipe needs tweaking. I should add i tried this last December. before it had been rated. I'll like the ideas and will give them a try.

I love these....Use whipped cream and add the milk first.  I've found that if you mix the milk first, mixing until all the powder is wet and mixed in with the milk, and then add the liquor, they will set more firmly- if that is what you're after. I like mine to be just like creamy pudding that you can either spoon or lick out of a cup.

I gave this 4 stars because of the novelty of it.  I went by the recipe and it was too strong and it did not set quite right.  Maybe freezing them would have helped.

I had these @ a bar in ohio once and they were out of this world. I would recommend that instead of a whole cup of milk, use a little less (maybe 6 oz.) The pudding WILL solidify as written, however, since alcohol is thinner than milk, they get harder faster with less milk.  Also, these are really tasty if you use french vanilla pudding, 1/2 c. vodka and 1/2 c. baileys (or kaluah) :-)

These were very strong!  Everyone tried one, but mainly because they were curious of what a "Pudding shot" was.  Good way to switch things up, but I might try flavored vodka for more taste, instead of strength.

I made this for a party I recently went to and they were a huge hit.  I took the advice from other people who rated this recipe and used a tub of cool whip.  They turned out fabulous. Next time I make them I will try to freeze them, several people told me that would make them even better.  One thing is, these were fast and simple to make.  I am throwing out my jello shooters recipe because that gets too complicated!  The possibilities are endless with the pudding, I think I need to try butterscotch pudding with butterscotch schnapps and vodka.  Is it Friday yet???

I haven't made these myself yet, planning on it tomorrow.  I love the reviews from others, the liquir combo suggestions sound amazing! I recently had these at a friend's birthday and their recipe called for the cool whip and 3/4 cup milk but same for the rest. Also they stated they need to stay frozen to set.  condiment cups worked really well for serving. Can't wait to make them, and start experimenting!

I use plain greek yogurt instead of milk.  They freeze harder and I just freeze it in a bowl.  I use a small batter scoop to put them in petit four papers.  Much better than cool whip which I think is chemically tasting and gross.  I try different pudding and liquor combinations.  Our favourite is fudge pudding with Kahlua.

Yum..the cool whip added at the end definately helped...I also used a graham cracker/sugar and melted butter mixture and used that to make a parfait effect...then topped off with plain cool whip (w/ 1 tsp. vanilla) YUM!

This recipe turned out great!! I did modify a little and took the advice from other reviews and had great results.  I did add a tub of cool whip after mixing and placed the shots in the freezer overnight.  They ended up like tasty little portions of creamy chocolate ice cream with a bite.  What else could you ask for?? They were gobbled up quick.

I made these for a small get together & they were such a hit I've been told to make them for our poker party!  With a bit of whip cream on top, these are terribly dangerous!  In a good way of course! :)

I did add a container of cool whip & froze this.  Since the weather was hot, the cold homemade icecream texture & taste were a HUGE hit!  Be careful!  You will want to eat this by the bowlful with a spoon!

These were a great idea but too strong.  The Baileys was too over powering and no need to double the recipe it made to much.  Have lots of left overs

You have to add the whip cream. I freeze mine, it has the consistency of a fudgsicle. The only bad thing is everyone always ask you to make them.

Definitely add the container of cool whip and fold it in. I also put these in the freezer instead of just chilling in the fridge. My friends LOVE these. You could pretty much make a tub of it to serve as a "better than ice cream" adult desert. Wonderful!

These were great with the addition of the cool whip.  I used fat free pudding and 1/2 a tub of 95% fat free cool whip and they set over night just like ice cream and yummy.

These were very good.  I took them to a cook out and everyone was very excited to try them.  Needles to say they were all gone by the time the cook out was over.  I used baileys and vanilla pudding.

I made mine with aq large box of pudding and u MUST use a tub of whip cream and the reason  people say the consitity is not right is because u HAVE to freeze them and keep them frooze till ur ready to eat them that info was left off the recipe and I have found cut the vodka amounts down and add  that amount u cut to the other liqure vodka makes them strong tasting if these are made right U really dont taste the achole

THIS RECIPE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT INCLUDE COOL WHIP. If you are looking for a pudding shot recipe with cool whip so that its more of a boozy dessert THIS IS NOT THAT RECIPE. As and as some have stated, you CAN add it to this recipe.
HOWEVER - I was specifically looking for a recipe without it as I wanted a more liquified pudding shot, not something I had to eat with a dang spoon. This is a creamy, pudding tasting shot that you DRINK not eat. It will NOT have the consistency of pudding.
For those rating it less b/c it didn't have cool whip as an ingredient are ridiculous as that wasn't the intent of this recipe - if you added it and liked it better, good for you but this was a recipe that didn't include cool whip for a reason.

I made them with the Cool Whip and they were very popular with my guests - everyone requested the recipe.  The only adjustment I would make next time is to use a little less Cool Whip so the consistency is more liquid as opposed to mousse.  We had to squeeze the cups to get the whole shot out.

A huge hit at our office Christmas party!!  I tripled the recipe.  With about 35 people at the party, not a single pudding shot remained.  I recommend topping them with a dollop of whipped cream just before serving.

Love this over using gelatin!  I half tried this recipe but used our own twist after learning the trick from a local farmer: Instead of chocolate pudding, we used a black sapote (aka chocolate sapote) fruit which has the consistency and taste of chocolate pudding and mixes deliciously with the liquor. Will definitely make it again for Christmas this year.

I made the mistake of failing to read the reviews before purchasing the ingredients. I made the recipe as written and it never firmed up. It requires 4 - 8oz of cool whip to reach the firm, creamy texture.

Read reviews about the Cream whip, although it was mentioned in the video. I didn't have vodka but was looking for a recipe where I could use up some cheap cherry rum I bought by mistake. So, I added 1 cup of  Baileys (instead of 1/2), 1 cup of cherry rum ( instead of 1/2 cup vodka), had to add 2 packages of instant pudding or it was too runny.  Delicious!

I used exactly what was called and this DOES NOT set up like a mouse. More like a very slightly thickened chocolate milk, very, VERY disappointed! Don’t even bother, lesson learned.

I used Baileys creamer instead of milk. 
The other ingredients remained the same. They came out great.
I personally dont care for them with cool whip.

Sadly I mixed this up with another recipe and took them to a party. The general reaction was "tastes good...but I can't finish it - too strong!" And these people are drinkers. 1/2 C vodka is too much and overtakes the shot.  These wouldn't even set up. 

The other recipe calls for 1/4 C vodka plus a small container of cool whip added as the last step and they are awesome!

Wanted to bring something a little different to a St. Paddy's Day party.  People went wild over them and even the next day were thanking me for bringing them.  Super easy to make.  Purchased the shot containers with lids on Amazon.  Already thinking of the different combinations of puddings and alcohol I can make for future events.

Took the suggestion and added Cool Whip (1 container) and a friend suggested putting a mint leaf on top (it was for a St.Pat's party, but I'd do the mint leave anytime - lovely appearance and I enjoyed the mint!)

So, the cool whip is missing from this recipe and I knew that by looking at other reviewer's posts. Unfortunately, one reviewer said if you only have a big box of pudding, double the liquids...NO! This recipe actually uses a large box and big mistake on my part, I didn't confirm the size and went by that reviewer's  post. My shots never set up so it was a waste. Ended up sticking them in the freezer and they make yummy frozen treats similar to fudgesicles...not what I was shooting for but will work over throwing it all out. The only thing missing in this recipe is the cool whip, other than that don't change the measurements.

They came out watery and unusable. I made sure to measure with the measuring cup perfectly too. Disappointed.

It would be nice if this  recipe went away  rather than being the first one to pop up. The incomplete ingredient list ruined my all important birthday pudding shots for a friends party. Now I am left with 100  cold chocolate shots that are SO NOT WHAT I WANTED !!!!!  This gets a big thumbs down

It is great for getting drunk, but it is not as sneaky as it may seem. You can definitely taste the alcohol.

I also added the 8 oz. of whipped topping (not necessarily Cool Whip name brand).  I did use Caramel Vodka, a lot smoother than regular vodka. Get lots of comments on them. Also try Butterscotch pudding w/ Buttershots Liquor instead of Irish Creme, very yummy!

Unfortunately I didn't read the comments and didn't add cool whip so they were a runny gross mess. First time I made pudding shots I was really disappointed. I will add cool whip next time.

This recipe is not pudding or even mouse in consistency And it is very strong.  Reducing the milk and alcohol and adding cool whip, as well as freezing rather Than chilling all help

Followed these directions exactly BUT added RediWhip on top, just before serving.  No one complained about the consistancy. I made some vanilla and some chocolate.

These went over very well. I let them set up for over 24 hours and they really never got to a pudding consistency. It wasn't even a thick mousse. The top of the cup set up but the rest was very runny. They still tasted delicious and didn't go to waste, but they were not easy to drink.
