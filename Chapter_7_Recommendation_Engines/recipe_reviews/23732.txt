This is one of the best pound cakes I have ever had, very moist and flavourful. Next time will add chopped dried apricots, we love apricots! I used apricot nectar instead of brandy because they were gifts for families with young children. I made 5 mini loaves, baked at 325 for 55 minutes.  4 for my sons teachers, 1 for us! Yummy!

I have the same recipe and this is delicious! Full of flavor. The only difference(which is optional) all 1/2 C. chopped apricots that are lightly floured.

WOW, great flavor and texture. This was luscious, Melissa.We loved the combination of flavors provided by the various extracts. Your grandpa sure knew his way around the kitchen to come up with this great cake! I served it with apricot sauce and a dollop of whipped cream at our dinner party. Everyone loved it.

My family has made this cake for decades; the recipe from my grandmother is exactly the same except for 1/2 tsp. almond extract and baking 80 minutes instead of 60. 

The real key to this recipe is aging: take the finished cake, once cool, and wrap it in a tea towel dipped in apricot brandy. Place the wrapped cake in an air-tight container and store in a cool, dry place for 2-3 weeks.

This is an excellent cake. Very moist.I increased all the extracts as I like very flavorful cakes (I always increase the extracts in a recipe) Do not omit any ingredients. My husband loved it! Will make again and again

I made this recipe last year and it's excellent!  Try cubing for a chocolate fondue or chocolate fountain dessert night.  You can freeze the cubes for future use, but they also make a great frozen treat.  Yumm!  :D

Wonderful recipe.  I made it for an office party, and it got rave reviews.  It was a real crowd-pleaser.  I made mine with apricot nectar rather than brandy, but added in a couple of big spoonfuls of apricot preserves.  I also used an apricot almond glaze, made with 1/4 cup apricot nector, 1-1/2 cups powdered sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract.  I loved the texture and the flavor.

Moist, absolutely delicious! This is a family holiday staple at our house. Freezes and travels well, can be mailed in a tin for Christmas. Outstanding addition to your collection.

Excellent cake and indeed did freeze well as it spent 5 days well-wrapped in the freezer before being defrosted and decorated.   I baked it as one layer in a Wilton "lamb" pan.  It was somewhat heavy (unbleached all purpose flour) but moist and delicious.  The recipe is versatile as well.  Since I did not have apricot brandy on hand, I soaked a few dried apricots in rum then pureed them in my food processor.   Worked beautifully!
One guest asked for the recipe and I gave her a printed copy noting my ingredient adjustment.    
Nice Spring time flavors that really "hit the spot" for our Easter dinner.

Excellent pound cake!  I doubled up on most of the extracts as suggested by some.  Made it for my nephews 28th birthday.  my sister called and asked what mojo had I put in the batter...lol.  It's definitely a keeper.

I have the exact recipe from a Georgia church cookbook.  I have been making it for years.  It is my favorite pound cake.  It is always moist and with all the extracts, it has so much flavor, they all blend together to make it great!  It also freezes very well.
