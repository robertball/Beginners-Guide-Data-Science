I must say this is the best clam chowder that has ever come out of my kitchen!  Tastes like restraunt quality but really easy to make!! However, I think this makes more than 10 servings, I had to use my LARGEST roasting pan just to hold all the ingrediants.  Can't wait to make again! Thanks Becky!

I would never have tried this recipe except for all the good feedback...I did have to alter it a little since I wanted to cook it in the crock pot instead of the oven.  I chopped up some celery along w/the onion and used bacon drippings instead of margarine.  I added a pinch of thyme like I read in anothers review... I cooked it on low for about 8 hours and don't add the half and half until one hour before finshed. If you do then it will curdle.  the easiest and best tasting clam chowder I have ever made!

OK... the typical FANTASTIC RATING and review with "exceptions" on the ingredients.

First off... FANTASTIC RECIPE.. DOH!!.. could a recipe with base ingredients "out of the can" be better than a "hand wringing" personally inspected and selected batch of ingredients... ???? Guess what.. RIGHT ON!!!

Now for my "MODS"... everything the same "EXCEPT"... 6 slices of thick bacon crumbled; 1 TBSP of bacon fat reserved and added to the half cup of margarine (we used BUTTER) that I used to saute the 2 cups of onion, 4 stalks of chopped celery hearts till translucent/tender and, then, added 4 Red Potatoes washed, scrubbed and then cubed.. LEAVE THE SKINS ON....

We added this to the "canned" ingredients (but in our case they didn't have cream of potato soup so I went with 2 - 6.5 oz cans of cream of onion and 3 - 6.5 oz cans of clam chowder) and a 8 oz. bottle of Snows clam juice.

All this was combined with a TBSP of parsley and 1 tsp each of thyme and dill.

This was the BEST CLAM CHOWDER we have ever had... so simple it is mind boggling.

TRY IT; YOU WILL LIKE IT.

This was great!  Everyone but my picky son ate and enjoyed. My little girl asked for 2nds!  I did scale down the recipe to 6 servings and I cooked all day on low in the crock pot.  I added one stalk of chopped celery, a pitch of thyme and a few sprinkles of parsley.  What an easy dish to prepare that tastes totally homemade!

This was a huge hit at a recent dinner party!  It was so easy to make.  I did it in my crockpot.  Everyone said it was the best clam chowder they had ever tasted.  I didn't have the heart to tell them it was all canned soup. Let them think I went to a lot of trouble! Thanks for the post.

This is the best CLAM CHOWDER we ever tried, we'd been to san francisco, monterey, santa cruz, pismo beach ,redondo beach, etc, and there is nothing like this reccepie, It sounds weird that you have to use already made clam chowder, in order to make this batch, but IT REALLY WORKS !! My wife used the crockpot instead the oven and came up perfect, the only thing we noticed that by using exactly the measurements of the ingridients, we came up with a FULL, big size crockpot of chowder, wich wasn't a problem as the whole family loved it we had a little extra for next day...... Note: consider 3 to 4 hrs.(high)for cooking before you'll serve, and don't add the half and half until one hour before finshed.  We use RAYMOND'S SOURDOGH BAGGETTE, bread wich is made in south san francisco = a KILLER !!!!!

This was the best clam chowder recipe I have ever tasted!!  We live on the West Coast and have had many variations of chowder but even my husband said this one is the best!  I only changed the recipe just a bit by adding bacon, but other than that it was perfect just the way it was written.  Thanks!

I made it for a soup party and had great reviews, many people asked for the recipe.  I was a little concerned about using all the canned products, you couldn't tell there was a bunch of canned soups put together.  Very easy.

VERY good, I cut recipe down to 6 servings and it makes ALOT!
ONE WORD OF CAUTION, I added some celery and diced potatoes with skins on. The Potatoes need to be pre boiled if you add them, I had them in the oven per instructions and they did not get done at all!!!

This was a good, easy base. However, we found it had too much of a clammy taste for our little family so we added another can of cream of potato soup (we made a batch sized for two) and we added a little dill, paprika, and pepper. After our changes we loved it. I think next time I'll drain the minced clams first but overall a good, easy base for those who aren't very good as making a roux or don't know how but want a good clam chowder.

My FAVORITE recipe so far!! I took advise about the thyme, though I used both fresh and dried. Also I did add celery, Oh! I used this mornings bacon grease to saute the onions with a bit a butter, last thing I did was added the half an half a small amount every hour. I baked the chowder in a 5 1/2  qt. pot for 4 hours. My husband loved it. MUST MAKE

I was so anxious to try this chowder that it was absolute agony to wait 4 hours! I scaled the recipe ingredients waaayy back. Here's what I did. I cooked a small chopped onion in some bacon grease and a bit of butter. I also added a few slices of bacon. I used 2 cans of cream of potato soup, one of clam chowder, and 1 cup of half and half. I added 3/4 cup of milk (ran out of 1/2 & 1/2) and since i had some leftover cream of chicken soup I threw that in too. This may sound weird but I don't like my chowder overally "fishy" so I did not add the extra can of clams. This fit in a 8X8 baking dish and I had enough to confortably feed 4. This tasted great, like something you'd get in a restaurant. Fantastic.

Wonderful easy recipe!

I made it in the crock pot and cooked on low for the day on New Years Eve. It was ready for our "munchie/salad/soup" dinner!

I absolutely recommend this dish!

I loved this chowder!  I made it for four people, and reduced the margarine and half & half used.  I also added water in with the condensed cream of potato soup, because everything was altogether really thick.  The recipe came out beautifully!

This was disappointing as it was very "soupy".  We prefer a thicker
clam chowder.  Taste wasn't bad but nothing special.  It's also a
tad pricey to make and takes a huge pan as there's enough soup to feed an army.

My family and I loved this, even my picky 10 year old!I didn't have to add as much half and half as it called for, it was already creamy enough.  We will definitely be making this again!

This soup was pretty good but a bit too creamy for our taste.  The recipe did make a lot of soup.  I used my smaller roasting pan and had to bring out the big one because it would not fit everything into it.

This was really good.  The recipe pared down to feed 6 would still feed the masses.  Great recipe for a crowd.  Will make again.

This was delicious. Personally I did not put it in the oven. I used a regular soup pot, melted the butter, sautéed the onion until soft (added a little minced garlic) then dumped everything together. Stirring frequently brought it to a boil and then simmered it with fairly frequent stirs for about an hour. Turned out great. I made the recipe without changing servings. If you do this, it is only 9 servings if you are serving 9 people for 9 days. This is a TON of soup. I will definitely scale it back next time, but there will definitely be a next time!

This is the best clam chowder I've ever had.  Huge hit when I make it at home or bring to parties.

I was hesitant when making this because I like my clam chowder very thick but when I poured it into my rosemary, olive oil bread bowl I loved it. I even went back for more. Also, I couldn't find cream of potato so I used cream of celery and it worked perfectly.

Very good and very easy! WOW! hard to believe canned ingredients would produce such a tasty dish! I did cut ingredients down to 1/3 for my husband and I. We love REAL New England Clam Chowder. On a trip to the east coast we had the best over the top chowder at a little restaurant. It was so thick the spoon stood straight up in the middle of the mug. They also put a generous pat of real butter on top that melted over the top of the chowder. This recipe does not produce a soup as thick as that, but it does make a chowder rich and flavorful enough to cure our craving for a good clam chowder. I also added two good generous pinched of thyme and 1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning. Just before serving I topped with pats of real butter. Awesome soup!

Excellent. An easy recipe with tasty results, which can easily be adapted to meet your family's tastes. Served with crusty bread or a toasted cheese sandwich, this provides great comfort food on a cold winter's night. Very well done!!!
