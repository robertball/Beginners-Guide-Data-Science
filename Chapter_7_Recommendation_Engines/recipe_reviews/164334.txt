I usually make this soup after I've had a ham cooked.  I use the large bone from the ham and some leftover cubed ham to add to the soup.  Gives it great flavour.

I love any recipe that helps me recreate that back home feeling and salt beef is always a winner. For those that don't know of it, it is like corned beef (and cabbage) brisket.  Salt beef  is sold as "Naval beef" in  5 and 10 lb plastic tubs filled with brined chunks of beef in the chilled grocery section. Make sure you soak it well for a number of hours to remove the salt (change the water mid way if you really want to remove all salt).  I prefer it a bit salty, because the way my mother would always cook it. Thank you Carolyn. (Any chance for Fish and Brewis?)

I make "newfie pea soup" all the time...I would like to add that I also put chicken wings in mine, my Nan always did when I was a child and all my family members back home still cook it this way. Also I have never heard of anyone soaking the salt beef before hand. I always just throw it in the pot with the peas and let it cook up for about 2 hours before i start putting in the veggies. It's important to keep adding water. Also I always finish with dumplings (or doughboys as we call em' back home:)

I thought this recipe was delicious. I found "salt beef" at my local grocery store as "naval beef". It came frozen in a big tub. I used about 5 pieces of the beef, but off all the fat and was left with a bit less than a pound of small cubed beef. I used 3 cups of split peas instead of two, and also used about 12 cups of water. I added water every 20 min or so, everytime it seemed to simmer down a lot. I didnt soak the peas or the meat. I had to boil the meat and peas for 2 hours before adding the vegtables.

I used this recipe for my first attempt at pea soup.  It was awesome.  I added a little celery and onion and it was fantastic.  My 10 year old told me it was the most amazing pea soup ever.  Quite the compliment.  It was a little runnier than I was used to growing up so the only thing that I will do next time is cut back slightly on the water.  I found a recipe for dumplings on another site and the combination was great.  This is a true Newfie pea soup. Yummy!

Yummy!This recipe is just like my mother's. The only difference is we also add a diced onion and a couple of cubes potatoes. Delicious, and even better on the second day when its nice and thick!

I'm sure this ones delicious but for those not in the know back home we always  referred to rutabaga as turnip. I for one never knew the difference until about 15 years back when I moved away and was initially confused at the two different root veggies in front of me at the grocery store. for those who are used to what "turnip" looks like it was fairly obvious  but  for those non rock cooks be aware that it will not be the same soup.

Also, don't for get the dough buoys bye!
