Wonderful recipe.  You'd never know it was healthy!  I've found that if I heat a glass of water for a minute in the microwave, the microwave becomes a great place (warm and humid) to stash the dough for rising.

This is excellent.  As written, allow a little time for the dough to rise initially but then allow it to again for another 5-10 minutes on the pan before you bake it.  The result is a nice "pan pizza" like crust - GUILT FREE!  I agree wholeheartedly with the recommendations to pre-cook at 350 for 15 minutes or more (depending on thickness) and then add toppings and cook again.  My husband kept "oohing" and "ahhing" about the crust.  I think the honey really makes it.  For those of you who mentioned it was tough - perhaps you kneeded it too much.  You want to mix with greased hands just until the ingredients are incorporated.  We made individual pizzas which was really fun for the kids (ok - and me and hubby too!)

I made it in my food processor and added a couple swirls of olive oil to make the dough easier to work with...  Then I covered the dough and stashed it in the fridge all day.  I took it out of the fridge an hour before I wanted to use it to warm it up.  Cut it into 4 pieces and rolled it onto parchment, brushed with a touch of olive oil, and baked on a pizza stone at 450 degrees for 3 minutes or so.  Then took it out, put some pesto, cheese, tomatoes, and whatever else.  Fresh cracked pepper on top, and back on the stone for 4-5 minutes or until the cheese was melty. 

I will never make white pizza dough again....this was so incredibly good!  Love the honey in it!

This recipe is similar to a Betty Crocker whole wheat recipe I have always used except it is even more healthy! I really like that it has wheat germ and honey in it instead of oil and sugar. Prepared the dough in my breadmaker which allows it to rise for an hour, then pressed it into a medium size pizza pan sprayed with canola oil. Let rest for 15 mins and then precooked in 425 oven for 2 minutes before adding all the other toppings. Turned out great, crunchy on the outside and chewy inside!!

This recipe is quick, easy and tastes great. I tried it because it was cholesterol free.  I was in search of a whole wheat pizza dough and this one is great.  My family likes it with olive oil, fresh home grown tomatoes, fresh garlic, italian seasoning and mozzarella cheese.  I suggest NOT doubling the recipe your first time. This recipe is substancial for a family of 3-4.

Yummy! :) I did what STARS4BEA did below, I prebaked it for 17 minutes @ 350, put the toppings on, then baked it again for 20 minutes @ 350, then for an additional 5 minutes @ 400. I floured my pizza stone a little and used a thin spatula to loosen the dough off the stone after the first 17 minutes. It came out DELICIOUS! I had actually kneaded the dough and let it rise longer because I had the time. My only complaint is that it wasn't very crispy on the bottom, but this was my first time using a pizza stone, so I think I'll just have to practice. ;) All in all, the dough was VERY tasty, VERY quick, and a GREAT healthy alternative to regular pizza dough!

Very good! I used this dough to make two round 12" thin crust pizza's. It was a little softer than we like (we like crisp crust) but such a great flavor and we can adjust to the softness because it is sooo much better for us than jiffy pizza crust!  Very easy to make.  I did a few things differently. After I let the dough rise for 10 minutes in a warm oven then I kneaded it for a few minutes on a lightly floured surface.  I greased the pizza pans and my hands with cooking spray and pressed the dough onto the pans. Very easy! I let the crust rest for 10 minutes then poked holes and baked for 4.5 minutes @ 425 degrees. Added toppings and baked for 11 minutes @ 425 degrees. Great recipe, thank you!

Great taste and texture. I added some herbs (italian) to the flour mixture. Even better.

Excellent!  This crust is easy to assemble and tastes great.  I topped mine with ranch dressing, a variety of fresh vegetables, and two cheeses; but everyone agrees it is good enough to eat alone.  I try to avoid white flour, so I was particularly thrilled to discover this recipe.

I love this recipe, but could never get the dough crispy enough for my taste.  Tonight I raised the cooking temperature to 400 degrees, and pre-cooked the crust for 10 minutes.  I then put my toppings on the crust and cooked it for 6-10 minutes.  Perfectly crispy!

This crust was great! However, the author forget to  list putting honey in with the water and yeast in the directions.  As others have stated, when the mixture is combined knead it about 10 times to make a smooth ball before covering it to let it rise.  Also, it is much easier to work with if you let it rise at least 20-25 minutes.  It is quite sticky but if you put some AP flour on your work surface and on top of the dough and roll it out it will not shrink on you.  I also parbaked the crust at 450F on a pizza stone for 7 min, topped, and then cooked another 7-10 minutes until the edges were golden brown.  This will definately become a staple in my recipe box.

OH MY WORD!!!! I used to think it was trite for people to say they wished they could rate something 10 stars, but seriously, this deserves WAY more than 10 stars! I am in love with this crust! I'm never going to make another kind. It was perfect - healthy, but so SO tasty! I added some rosemary and garlic powder to the crust, and like some others suggested, I let rest a couple min on the pan before sticking in the oven ... I baked for 15 minutes, topped with a little pizza sauce, tomatoes, red peppers, onions, minced garlic, mushrooms, olives, spinach, little cheese, and low fat turkey pepperoni, basil, oregano, put it back in the oven for 15 more minutes, and then broiled it on low for about a minute to get the top crust and cheese a little toasted. It was SO good!!!

I subbed 1 cup of bread flour (so I didnt need the wheat germ). This turned out good. I baked it for maybe 10 minutes, then topped it, and put it in the fridge until just before my husband came home, then I put it in another 10-15 and it had just enough crunch, while still being slightly chewy in the middle.

One word - FANTASTIC!  I brushed mine with basil oil and added some fresh chopped herbs before baking for 10 minutes at 350, then added the Romesco sauce from this site, topped with goat cheese and lots of fresh basil - A wonderful combination! The perfect dough for endless pizza possibilities.  Next time, I'll try grilling it.

This was very good!  I did not use the wheat germ, I added a little extra flour.  I prebaked the crust at 400 and for 5 minutes and then added the sauce and toppings and baked for 12- 15 minutes.  It was superb!!  We made two medium sized 6 piece pizzas and a individual sized pizza for my daughter, so it does make quite a bit if you make a thin crust.

I didn't have any wheat germ, so I just followed another reviewer's tip to just replace it with an additional half cup of whole wheat flour. It worked really well! One thing I must say is that if you follow the serving size of a 12" pizza it will be on the thicker-crust side, and I had to bake it for about another 10 or 15 minutes. If I had made a 14" or 16" pizza I think it would have been more accurate to the instruction's bake time. Either way, great recipe. I'll definitely make this again!
Update: Made this again only I used a 24 inch pizza stone rather than the 12". Perfect! The baking time is accurate to that size and the crust was the perfect thickness. Even the anti-whole-wheat family members went back for seconds... and thirds!

I would have given this recipe a higher rating (since it was tastey), if I hadn't been stuck prying the pizza off of the pan.  I usually grease the pan before I bake pizza dough on it, but since this recipe said to roll the dough onto a "floured" pan, I decided to give this idea a try.  BIG mistake... make sure you grease the pan before spreading the dough on it.  Also, the dough was way too sticky to spread - so I had to use quite a bit of extra flour to make it workable (next time I'll cut down on the water).  Thanks for the recipe though - I'll give 'er another try.

I am on a quest to better health, so I wanted to find a more nutritional way to consume pizza... This is it! I had to substitute ground flax seed for the wheat germ because it was what I had on hand, and I also added a little olive oil.  I pre-baked the crust on the bottom rack at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes.  I topped the pizza with grilled chicken, tomato, green onion and cilantro.  Very yummy!  This will make it into our regular meal rotation.

The perfect pizza crust for South Beach dieters!  I made the dough exactly as the recipe stated.  I rolled it out very thin and cut out mini crusts with a 2" round cutter.  Baked them until lightly browned, then added toppings and baked again until hot.  (Goat cheese, carmelized onions and toasted walnuts for the adults and cheese & pepperoni for the kids...oh, and a few for dessert sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar)  No more store bought pizzas for us!

Since we're in between bread machines at the moment, I decided to do things the "old-fashioned way" and try this recipe for our weekly pizza night. I did make a few changes: kneaded the dough 10 times after mixing, let dough rise for about 1hr, pressed into pan with well-floured hands (very sticky!) then baked at 425 degrees for 15min. Crust was tender and flavourful. I'll definitely make it again :)

Yum!  I've never made WW dough or any dough for that matter but this was really good and really easy.

I followed the recipe except used 2/25 c flour instead of any wheat germ.  I also let it rise in a warm spot and then punched it down and let it rise some more.  I then spread it out on a 9x13 baking stone.  Baked for 15 min at 350.  Topped with sliced mushrooms, onions, roasted red peppers, handful of feta, shredded mozzarella, sliced steak and then baked for 15-20 min more.  Delish!

This was great!  We took the tip from another reviewer about letting the dough rise on the pans for a few minutes.  It turned out thick and hearty, but soft and chewy all at once.  My husband loved it and told me to put it in the regular dinner rotation.  :)  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

We LOVE this pizza dough.  I was worried, since I've had some whole wheat pizza doughs that weren't that great before, but it was awesome.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Awesome recipe. I really really wanted to have a pizza and a healthy one too. So as I was looking for a whole wheat pizza dough recipe I came across this one. Too good to be true. I made it today and hubby was literally licking the plate clean. The only change I made in the recipe was, that I added a about 3-4 tbls of semolina flour to make it a crispy. It turned out absolutely yummy.   As others have suggested I pre-baked the crust for about 10 mins at 350 ( I rolled my crust pretty thin. Also After rolling the pizza I let it rest and let it rise a little bit. Topped it with my home made spicy tomato sauce. Sprinkled on some veggies and a little bit of cheese and put it back in the oven for another 15 mins. And oh my god, the crust tasted like heaven. So much better than the one made with all purpose flour.   My crust was not soggy, in fact the bottom was pretty crispy. It might be because of the semolina flour. Also I baked it on a baking sheet, covered with foil and oiled with olive oil.   Guilt free pizza. Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy and taste recipe. I made it exactly as is and brushed the crust with olive oil, then baked at 425 degrees for 5 minutes, added all the toppings and baked  at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.

I never really trusted myself to make my own pizza crusts, but now I am SO glad I tried!  I followed the link from the December '08 "Single Servings" column, which suggested making four baby pizzas out of this dough and freezing them.  I baked the mini-crusts for five minutes, added sauce, cheese, and piles of veggies, wrapped them in plastic wrap and stacked them in a plastic freezer bag.  When I'm ready to eat, I put one in the oven for about 20 minutes and it's perfect.  So delicious.  It's been wonderful to have homemade, healthy, on-demand frozen pizza.  Next time I'll make more!

Excellent recipe!  Previous reviews really helped out.  Whoever gave the idea for the cup of water heated in the microwave for a min or so to create a proofer for the dough is awesome.. that worked out great!  After the dough rose I coated my hands with olive oil, pressed it out on a piece of wax paper and topped it with another piece of wax paper and rolled it out to the size of my pizza pan.. removed the wax paper and viola.. pizza crust.. It came out very nice!!  Hubby loved it!

This is a very delicious and healthy pizza dough...It was very easy to whip up (I made 3 batches one right after one another in a matter of minutes) and while I prepared my toppings, I let the dough rise--by the time I was done the dough was ready for rolling out~  ...a great alternative to delivered pizza!!

Oh Wow.. what a nice surprise! I've never made homemade pizza dough, always just bought the premade ones at the supermarket, so I was nervous and since I didn't know what I was doing I read and wrote down all the tips in the reviews. I made this recipe and Pizza Dough 1 recipe (from this site) so I'd have both in case no one liked this one. We're just starting to eat whole wheat stuff so I was nervous but I didn't need to be... I didn't even give the kids a slice of this pizza and fully expected to be the only one who would eat it but one by one they all tried it and 4 out of the 5 liked it better than the other pizza. Even my Hubby and Sister in Law loved it. There wasn't a slice left of this pizza and there were 2 slices left of the other one. I did what other reviews said and let the dough rise for about 20 mins on the stone and than I baked the crust for 15 mins first and before I put the pizza back into the oven I loosened the crust from the stone w/ a spatula. I also couldn't find wheat grem at the store anywhere.. I had no clue where to even look so I used the same amount of ground flaxseed alike another reviewer said and it was fine. The dough was alittle too sticky to roll out but I just put some olive oil on my hands and used my fingers to shape it on my stone... This was a WONDERFUL pizza, the best I've ever made and I'm using this one from now on! THANKS!!!

What a great recipe! I'd been looking for a healthy alternative to white pizza dough - and this is it! I like a more tender crust (and I had the time), so I kneaded it and let it rise for an hour, it was perfect. Even my 2-1/2 year old loved it. Next time I'll definitely double the recipe and freeze half.

I've been using this recipe for almost a year now, every time I make it I have requests for the recipe! It's wonderful and delicious. I modified the recipe a little, by adding herbs and red pepper flakes to the dough. Also, when I have the time, I let it rise once or twice for about an hour. The honey really gives it it's characteristic flavor. Enjoy!

This recipe was great with a couple of modifications. I used ground flax instead of the wheat germ, 2 tablespoons of honey, and 3/4 cup water. For the whole wheat flour I used 1/2 spring wheat and 1/2 hard white wheat, both of were freshly ground from whole grains. I used one teaspoon of instant yeast and let the dough ferment overnight in the refrigerator to activate the phytase enzyme in order to break down phytic acid and release the nutrients of the whole grain. A couple hours before baking, I removed the dough from the frig so it would warm up before I rolled it out. It was a little sticky. So I oiled the rolling pin to roll it out. I used this dough for calzones and it was great. Crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.

This was my first time making pizza from scratch and using whole wheat.  I used 2.5 cups of whole wheat flour vs wheat germ, a little extra honey, & a garlic/herb salad dressing seasoning pack to add flavor.  It was enough to make a medium/large pizza.  I placed it in the oven on warm for 30 min to rise in an airtight container, refrigerated it over night, & used the next day.  I also baked it in the oven for 3 min prior to adding my homemade pizza sauce and toppings.  The sauce definitely made all the difference regarding the flavor of the bread.  I will definitely be using the recipe again.

No one would eat it. I make dough all the time. As an experienced baker, I know bread and dough can be tricky, but I blame the recipe on this account. It was a huge waste.

This was wonderful tasting and very easy to make.  I am always looking for easy recipes that use only whole wheat flour.  I have made this twice for pizzas once a big pizza once for small indivdual pizzas.  My kids liked this crust so much I rolled out and baked the individual crusts and they topped them and ate them before I could cook them again.  My daughter used a leftover crust for her cold lunch the next day.
I also used the recipe to make bread sticks, I brushed with a little butter and sprinkled with garlic and sald.  They were great.

Turned out well.  Wasn't sticky at all.  I greased the pizza pan with a good coat of cooking spray; it came right off.  Came out thick and good. I followed someone's advice and prebaked it for 15 minutes at 350 then put the toppings on and baked for 20 minutes; then 5 minutes at 400.  Came out perfect.  My boyfriend who hates wheat bread, loved it.

Yummy!!!  I had no trouble with the sticky dough--just put a little olive oil on my hands and pressed it into the lightly greased (with shortening) 12" pizza pan.  Before doing that, I put dough in microwave on the lowest power for 1 minute; not sure if it helped it raise much. Type of WW flour can make a difference in how the dough rises. I used WW Bread flour, which is somewhat higher in gluten than regular WW flour. The crust turned out medium thickness, not "thin." Prebaked the crust 17 min. at 350 degrees, then loaded pizza with sauce, extra cheese, etc. Baked finished pizza for 20 minutes at 350 degrees followed by 5 more minutes at 400 degrees.  All this and it was not overbaked; just incredibly delicious. Will definitely make it again.

Great recipe.  My husband and I have been trying to eat more whole wheat products and this recipe was a winner for homemade pizza.  I used my bread machine dough setting and baked the pizza on my pizza stone at 450 degrees for 10-12 minutes.  It was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a wonderful dough, with a nice texture and flavor - it tastes nice enough you would want to bake it as a stand-alone bread or perhaps rolls.

Wow - this recipe really is not only easy but delicious!  I love that it's healthy (2 pts per serving on WW), also.  This is the first rating I've given ever, and I thought this recipe was well worth the 5 stars.  My family is asking me to make this every week now, and many of my health conscious friends and family members have asked for the recipe.  Thanks again!!

This was pretty good though and I will make it again but with some changes. It lacked the honey flavor so i might add a bit more next time. Also, when I tested it raw, there seemed to be too much salt but i didn't notice it once it was cooked. I would either half that next time or sprinkle in a just bit. I realize that might help bring out the honey/ sweet taste. I also wouldn't do a thick crust with this. It was rather dry but the thin crusts came out really nice. I made 4 personal pizzas from this and it was fun. My kids helped roll and top. I also let it rise covered for an hour. 
You would expect lower rating but it was a healthy crust, it was easy, and everyone else seemed to like it.

Excellent...you really cannot tell it's healthy. I agree with the other reviews and cooked about 10-12 minutes before adding toppings then cooked again for about 15 minutes after adding them. Will definitely be making this again!

This crust was delicious.  I didn't use wheat germ because I didn't have any but it didn't taste like anything was missing.  This will replace the recipe I've been using for the past 9 years!  The only thing I will do different is next time I will spray my pizza pan before I put the dough down.  I'll also knead it for a minute or two with some additional flour. (no more than 1/2 cup) Nothing that will change the taste of the pizza.

You do not cook a pizza properly at 350 degrees! Turn your oven all the way up and watch your pie closely, It'll take about 8 min. depending on your oven. Commercial ovens run from 600-1000 degrees! Take it out when the crust and topping is the way you like it.

Great recipe! We've made it twice. First time in 1 pizza but was too heavy. 2nd time split into 2 crusts, poked fork holes, let rise (not much happened in 8 mins) and baked 5 mins, then topped and baked for 13 mins. Yummo! Used suggested bake temp and ingredients.

Very quick & easy to make, it's a 4-1/2 star crust which I rounded up to 5 because it's healthy & quick to make. I really love the chewy crusts with a crisp exterior, but those are at least 1/2 white bread flour. This one doesn't have the texture that I love & doesn't rise much at all. But it is healthy & I'll use it again for all its good points. Next time I'll add 1 Tbsp. vital wheat gluten to give the dough stretchiness, producing chewiness. Will update review at that time. If inclined, do try this.

Awesome recipe.  I have been looking for a healthier pizza dough recipe.  I like that this one used no white flour at all.  I did not have any honey so I used 1Tbs of brown sugar.  It worked well I mixed it in with the warm water before I added the yeast.  I will make sure I have honey for the next time I make this as I would like to try it how it was written.

I made this recipe 4 or 5 times before it finally came out right.  I love the recipe and it's yummy but the crust never rose and was like wet cardboard.  I finally omitted the wheat germ and allowed the yeast to rise for 45 minutes.  Also, I added about 2 TBSP of olive oil.  When it finally worked, it was great.

We've tried several pizza crust recipes from this site and this was by far the lightest and the best tasting. It made enough for 2 pizzas, one we cooked on a cookie sheet and the other on a pizza stone. Both turned out great.

This recipe worked great on the grill. I made the recipe as stated. Threw my pizza stone on to pre-heat. Divided the dough into four equal portions and rolled out. Let the dough sit and rise for about 10 minutes while I prepped my toppings. Sprinkled a little corn meal on the stone and pre-cooked the dough, like many others suggested, for about 2 minutes on one side and a minute on the other.  Put on the toppings and threw back on the grill for about another 7 minutes or until the cheese was melted, puffed and started to brown just a little.  It turned out great and I did not have to heat up the house. Win, Win!

Really good recipe!  I made a couple changes-  2 1/4 c of flour instead of 2 cups, as I didn't have wheat germ, doubled the amount of honey, added about 1 1/2 tbsp of olive oil, and then some spices-garlic powder, onion powder, and italian spices.  Made enough for 1 large pizza, big crust.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside!

An excellent and very simple pizza dough recipe.  I've made this several times now and the whole family has enjoyed it.  I make the recipe exactly as written and employ the handy microwave tip for rising (very helpful).  It is quick and easy to make and the finished product tastes delicious.  This will be a staple in our home.

Great pizza dough! I used this with the Butternut Squash with Rosemary Pizza. Mine was light and yummy.  I only kneeded the dough enough to get all of the flour mixed in and no longer.  Also, I did as someone suggested and heated a cup of water in the micro and then let the dough rise in the warm microwave.  After only about 15 min or so it was ready.  Will definitely use this recipe again. Thanx!

This was a good recipe. One complaint- it isn't vegan (because of the honey), though I found it in the vegan section.  I simply replaced it with vegetarian sugar (yes, sugar isn't always vegetarian either!) and it was good.  Nice change from the typical boring white crust.

Honestly, this just wasn't our cup of tea. I had never had a whole wheat pizza dough on my pizza before (to be fair) and I don't intend to again and that goes for any recipe I think it could be good for someone who has had a wheat-based pizza dough before and enjoyed it but for my family this was just too wheat-y. It was worth a try since it has to be better for us than a traditional white crust.

As written, four stars. Has a lot of potential. My husband says he would give it a three. It was kind of blah and flavorless. I recommend pre-baking for longer than called for, adding LOTS of garlic powder for flavor, adding a touch more honey and a pinch more salt, and mixing in a few swirls of olive oil (and brushing top layer) for crispiness. I will use this recipe again sometimes because it takes significantly less time than my standard recipe, but it could use a little help. :)

I followed the recipe exactly and made a large pizza big enough to feed me and my boyfriend and have two slices left over. We each ate two slices that day. I love making recipes that are healthy and this is one of them whereas my boyfriend is still stuck on loving white bread. Based on the reviews I thought this would be a hit for the two of us (because I am slowly introducing whole wheat into his diet) and he hated the crust. And I have to admit, it wasn't the tastiest crust. I would make it again for health reasons but otherwise, I am sure there is something that can be altered to make it better. Maybe the wheat germ was too coarse and added too much texture? Maybe I should hae replaced it with whole wheat flour instead or ground flax? I am not sure. I would like to try this again but I need to see what can be changed here. It just seemed bland. Not a crust that would be tasty to eat without topping. I'm glad others had success with it though.

Changed the recipe a tad after reading others' reviews.  Followed recipe as stated, though I used a generous tablespoon of honey, maybe almost 2T?  Also noticed it took more than just a couple minutes for the dough to rise, even when I put it in the oven's warming drawer.  Also used about 2/3 of the pizza dough.  If I had used all of it, it would have been way too thick.  Lastly, it took 18 minutes to cook (with pizza toppings on top).

Great results. Based on other reviews, I: 1) dissolved the honey in the warm water before adding the yeast, 2) let the dough rise a second time after spreading it on the pizza pans.  I pre-baked the crusts before adding toppings.  Tried to spread the dough thin enough for two 11" "thin crusts" but couldn't quite make it. Used "Easy Pizza Sauce I" from this site, for a simple and healthy pizza (if you use that sauce, make sure to reduce the amount of water).

This has become our go-to pizza dough recipe.  The only things I do differently perhaps - I mix the honey with the heated water and then add the yeast to that to proof.  And, I bake the pizza at 400 degrees for 15-18 minutes.  It's great!

I made this for the first time tonight; I recently starting "eating clean", so I wanted to find a whole-wheat flour recipe.  I didn't have wheat germ, so I used 1/4 cup of ground flax seed instead.  I also used agave nectar in place of the honey, as it is supposed to have a low glycemic index.   I pre-baked the crust on a stone for 10 minutes at 350.  I found after adding the toppings, and baking for an additional 12 minutes at 400, that I wished I had baked a bit longer.  The middle was a bit soggy, but the edges were crispy.   Next time, I'm going to let the dough rise a bit longer before I pre-bake, but overall I thought this was super easy and super yummy!  My 3 and 5 year old ate it, so that's pretty impressive considering they don't like "healthy" food, lol. For the base, I used roasted garlic, mixed with artichoke hearts, and spread this around.  I topped with vegetables, roasted in balsalmic vinegar and olive oil.  Topped with a bit of goat cheese... and VOILA... Delicious, low-fat, and sooooo good for you :)

Wonderful pizza dough!  The only change I made was to bake it on a pizza pan (with holes in it) for 12 minutes at 425 deg.  It came out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside with a great flavor.  I think I will experiment with flavoring this dough and next time I'll try adding some garlic granules and parmesan cheese.

This was a fantastic recipe. My husband loved the dough! I made a few alterations: 1) I used 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed instead of wheat germ and 2) I prebaked the dough for 15 mins, added toppings and baked for an additional 15 mins. Highly recommend, even if you're not doing a pizza - you can eat this dough as-is and guilt free!

This is the best healthy pizza crust recipe out there!  Wow!  Definitely don't leave out the honey, it's what helps keep the whole wheat dough moist.  I used whole wheat pastry flour.  I do not advise bread flour, if you are using a conventional home oven.  The temperature isn't high enough for it and will just give you a hard crust.   So I really don't see why pizza should be unhealthy food if you are using this recipe.  I just stick to a tomato sauce and cheese base (I use 4 slices of provolone for a 4-serving pizza, they have 70 calories a slice), loading up on mushrooms, green peppers and onions, and leave out pepperoni (so high in fat anyway), and I get a pretty fab, lean meal, at around 300 calories.  For beginners: to get a thick crust, roll the ends of your dough inwards after shaping, to desired thickness.  If you leave the ends flat, you won't get any thick crust.

For a whole wheat pizza dough, this one definitely got five stars in my book!  While it's not my favorite dough, it was very, very good.  I was very skeptical that a from-scratch dough that did not require a lot of time to rise could turn out so well, even  more so when it's whole wheat!   I prebaked it on my pizza stone for 15 minutes, then actually transferred to a baking sheet (I needed to use the stone for a second type of pizza).  I brushed the edge with olive oil and sprinkled with parmesan and dried oregano, then baked it with the toppings for 15, maybe 20 minutes at 450 degrees (with the other pizza)  I couldn't have been more pleased with the result!  The bottom crust was thin, and crispy/chewy, and the edges were a bit bread-like inside, but crisp and flavorful (thanks to the oil and parmesan idea) on the outside.  I'm very happy to have this one in my repertoire now! Thank you!

This recipe was simple and delicious and I made it in my food processor.

First I mixed the yeast and water together.  

Then all the dry ingredients went into the processor and were mixed together.  

Once the yeast had risen, I added it to the processor with the honey and pulsed until well combined.  Don't overmix though.  

Into the microwave - after one mug of water was nuked for one minute to warm it up - to rise (which was a great suggestion by someone in the comments before me.)

Separate into two parts, and pat into rounds.

Pre-bake for 10 minutes, then top with toppings.  

I topped with our fav spaghetti sauce, polish sausage, minced turkey bacon, minced mushrooms, mozza and cheddar.  Then into the oven to melt and cook the toppings.

It got a 9.5 out of 10 in our house, and even the two year old enjoyed the crust, which was mildly sweet.

This is really very good. I followed it to the original recipe, though my dough took so long to rise at all that I thought I had done something wrong. I defintely needed at least 20 minutes for it to rise. My husband is picky about "healthy" recipes and he ate and ate and ate this pizza. :-)

Throwed it together for wifey tonight. I guess I'm a thin 'n crispy kinda guy. Was alittle too cakey for me. I'll continue my pursuit for a more cracker like dough. Tasted ok and wifey ate half. If wifey eats it, she likes it. Otherwise she just sniffs it and walks away.

Cheers,
OTRPU

My wife and I are doing the South Beach Diet, and this recipe is great because it does not have any all purpose flour - just whole wheat.  It is fantastic!  I grill the pizza on the BBQ using directions from The Joy of Cooking.

This crust is delicious.  I have been spending way too much money on South Beach Diet Pizza and decided to make my own.  This recipe is a great substitute and its easy to prepare.  I split the dough into 6 individual pizzas and prebaked each for 5 minutes.  I froze 5 of them and finished baking one of the crusts using the "Pizza with no red sauce" recipe toppings.  Absolutely fabulous!

Being on the South Beach diet, we were looking for a healthy crust, and loved this one.  I used freshly ground wheat.  The first time I did not have any wheat germ so I just added 1/4 cup extra flour.  It turned out great!!  I have made it both ways and don't really notice a difference.  I also usually add a TBSP of gluten.  It is a quick recipe and rises just right.    **As an added note, we used cooked turkey bacon in place of peperoni and like that too.  This coming from a junkfood fan -hence the south beach diet!

I love this recipe!!!! Even better the kids loved it!!! Healthy choice. Guilt free way to eat pizza.I topped it with spinach, garlic and feta cheese. Yum. I also notice that the longer you let it rise the thicker the crust, without having to double the recipe.

Tastes great and easy to make...mine came out thick though, and the center of the dough didn't cook all the way through. I made it a second time and cooked it for 20 minutes before putting the toppings on and it was perfect!

This is an excellent whole-wheat pizza crust. I make it all the time! My husband loves it too because he hates refined white flours. Although I did leave out the honey because it makes the dough too sticky and sweet. A definite keeper, thank you so much for the recipe!

Crust was very good! Easy to make and very healthy. To make the crust more crispy I dressed the top of the crust lightly in vegetable oil.

I was looking for a crust that I could just mix, rest, and roll out.  This one fit the bill.  I made as written and let rise for 30 minutes.  It was a nice crust and rolled out nicely, although it didn't crispen up as I had hoped.  I did pre-bake the crust at 400° for 5 minutes before adding the toppings. Once I topped the pizza I continued to bake at 400° for 18-20 minutes.  The pizza was very good, and I will try this crust again, maybe letting it pre-bake for a few minutes longer.

Great, easy recipe. I had a friend who loves pizza crust tell me that this was a very tasty crust. I do prebake the crust for 7-10 minutes and then bake it for 12 minutes, all at 425.

My family loved it.  No one complained because it was whole wheat.  

I used 1/4 cup ground flax seed instead of the wheat germ.

This was very easy to make but we didn't care for the taste or texture.  I was expecting a thin crust but it was actually pretty thick - about half an inch for a 12-inch round.  The wheat flavor was very robust and really overpowered the flavors of the toppings.  The recommended cooking time is way off.  We ended up cooking the crust alone for 10 minutes, then with the toppings for another 20 minutes.  The dough would have been raw if only cooked for 5-10 minutes.

I used ground flaxseed instead of wheat germ, but had trouble getting the crust to rise. I also felt it needed more honey, and it came out dry.  Maybe if I would have used quick rise yeast (which is not what the recipe called for) and kneaded it.  It also may have helped to use whole wheat pastry flour.  As of now, I will look for another recipe.

Great taste!   I don't know if it was the whole wheat that was just too heavy, or if it was my yeast, but it did not "poof" up very much in the rising or baking, nor did it become crisp anywhere.  Very soft crust.  I think 350 is too low to bake pizza.  That may have also contributed.  I like to cook my pizzas on at least 400 (which I should have done this time, but wanted to follow the recipe).  I also baked the crust for 5 minutes before adding sauce and toppings and finishing baking.  I might revise this  to 5 stars if I make it again with different yeast and have a better outcome!

This was ok. Maybe it's b/c I'm spoiled on eating white dough pizza. It was kind of bland tasting. I really like wheat but, for pizza - not so much. I gave it 4 stars b/c my husband loves this dough.

I am so grateful for a WW recipe!  The addition of wheat germ is great.  The flavor was wonderful, but the dough was a little dense.  I'll roll it out thinner next time.  Doubled the recipe and froze 1/2 for later use.  Added 2 additional Tbsp honey, and 2 tsp garlic powder to the dough (keep in mind the recipe was doubled!).  Spread it on a baking sheet lightly sprinkled with corn meal so the dough didn't stick.  I think I'll experiment next time, adding parmesan and maybe some fresh rosemary or oregano.

This was good for our first attempt at homemade wheat dough. It came out a little dry though. Next time I will add a little olive oil, rosemary, garlic and a splash more water. We sprayed it with cooking spray, then pre-baked it at 350 for 12 min (did another at 450 but 350 was much better). We'll definitely make this again with a few changes.

This is a great recipe! I found that I will need to double it (we like to make 2 pizzas and the crust a little too thin for 2 pizzas). Even with super thin crust, the taste was great! I forgot to poke it with a fork before baking - no problems. I ended up baking it at 425 degrees for 8-9 minutes before I added toppings and then baked it another 8 minutes with toppings. Nice chewy crust, crispy on the outside. Thanks for a great pizza crust recipe!

This was AWESOME!! I have such bad luck with pizza dough. I made sure not to overwork it, just as another reviewer mentioned. I cut it in half and rolled it out thin. I par-baked it in a 500 deg oven on a pizza stone (preheated) and then put my toppings on and baked it. The crust was crunchy and bubbled. Just like I wanted it. I have never had that luck. Thank you for the best pizza dough recipe ever!

After reading all the reviews, I was very excited to try this recipe.  However, even after prebaking for 8min before adding toppings and then baking it for at least 15-20, the center was far less than crisp.  I love wheat bread and use whole wheat flour often, yet found the wheat taste to be very overbearing in this recipe.  If I make again, I will use half whole wheat and half AP flour.

This recipe is perfect for someone who is looking for a healthy alternative to a white dough for pizza. I was nervous at first because I didn't think it was rising enough but after I put the dough in the oven (about 5 mins before adding the sauce and toppings) it was rising quite a bit. I poked wholes into the dough and I also cooked the pizza at about 460. I will definitely make this recipe again and again! Super easy and quick! Delish!

I didn't like the flavor at all, too strong that you couldn't taste anything else. My husband and I ended up just eating the toppings off the pizza.

This recipe was super easy but the wheat taste completely overpowered the pizza and was extremely dense. I may try again with wheat pastry flour instead.

I would rate this a four but my husband gave it a two so three it was.  He and my oldest son ate very little.  My one year old loves the extra texture of health food and ate his weight in our broccoli-chicken pizza.  I will roll it out thinner next time and prebake for 15 minutes....note that I did say next time, so I plan to keep using this recipe with tweaking.  This recipe is not for those used to white flour pasta and dough.  It has the extra texture of wheat and is a little bready.  I thought it tasted good, though.

I really wanted to like this recipe. I wanted to try something new, I was a tad short on time, and the recipe I usually use is a bit time consuming, although worth it. I followed the recipe exactly, only I pre-baked mine for 12 minutes at 450 like I always do. I topped it, and baked again for another 15 minutes at 400. When I cut into the pizza, my heart sank. It felt bread-y, with none of the crisp I was hoping for. The flavor was ok, but overall bland. My husband and I  still ate it, after all we were hungry and it was our dinner. I use "Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Crust" from this site every time. It is a bit time consuming, but totally worth it. It has better flavor, and there is a bit of olive oil in the dough that I suspect is one of the things lacking in this recipe. This recipe only make 1 pizza, the one I mentioned before makes 2, with a better crisp and flavor. I will return to my favorite, and just plan my time better.

This was okay but was such a breeze to whip up and so healthy that it may be my new pizza recipe.  Makes one pizza that's not too big but the whole wheat must make it more filling because my husband and I were totally full after 1/4 of the pizza each.  I would add a little more salt and honey though...it was a bit bland.

Updated 12/5/10 - I tried this again with whole wheat pastry flour, 2 tbsp honey and 2 tsp salt.  Rolled it a bit thinner, too.  MUCH much better.  The last time when I made the original, it was a weak 4 stars...now it's a strong 4 stars.  The kids raved about it and it wasn't so "thudball" with the lighter flour.  PS...The dog ADORES the remnants of this crust. : )))

Well, my family didn't like it.  My hubby says it didn't taste like pizza dough.  My son was very disappointed that I wasn't use the local bakery's white dough, and wasn't able to finish a piece.  He first said it was tolerable but didn't want me to ever make it again.  Then he didn't finish.  I, however liked it, but it didn't wow me.  I probably needed to let it cook more before adding the toppings as it was slightly undercooked.  At least I have leftovers for lunch.

I like a crunchy crust so I precooked the crust for 15 minutes and then added the toppings and cooked it for another 15 minutes. It was wonderful! I love that it is delicious and healthy! This is going to be my go to pizza crust from now on.

The flavor was good, but it didn't rise.  I made it into individual pizzas for the kids and let them top it themselves...it was great idea, and they ate it but it wasn't as chewy as I'd have liked.  I may make it again using a different method.

My husband and I wanted to find an alternative to cut down on heavy breads and weighty pizz crusts, and this was a winner! Makes a very tasty thin crust, and definitely held up with all the toppings we like (a lot of fresh ingredients on top - basil leaves, olives, tomato slices, onions, garlic, grilled chicken, etc). We shared this when we had a small party and it was a hit!

Love this dough. But to be honest it was a little too thick or doughy for me. I doubled everything and as for the flour I did 50% whole wheat 50% white perfect. Let it rise for 20 minutes. Break it into 4 dough balls. I wrap two and store in fridge for later use calzones etc. I make two pizza's after I rollout dough I let it set for 15 minutes. For some reason letting it rise again gives it the perfect thiness and perfect crunch taste.

Healthy and tasty enough that I'll try it again, but the first time around, I wasn't impressed by the texture.  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and had my bread machine mix the dough (on pizza dough cycle)which gave it some extra rise time.  Maybe the machine overmixed it ?  So next time I'll do it by hand and mix it just lightly. Other changesI  made according to other reviews were: add a little olive oil to the dough.  Bake at higher temp for shorter time - I used a preheated pizza stone at 425 degrees.  Baked 3-4 minutes without topping and then 6-7 with toppings.  It was pretty flat and dense.  I'll try again but may be on the lookout for a recipe that uses whole wheat but has a better texture.

This was pretty good, though I didn't have any honey on hand so used a tablespoon of white sugar and a tablespoon of brown sugar. My dough never really got crispy. I baked it for 10 minutes at 350 and then added barbecue chicken toppings from this recipe: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Barbecued-Chicken-Pizza/Detail.aspx Then I baked it again for about 15 minutes, but it probably could've been in longer. I'll have to try this again with the honey and different baking times.

This is a standard in our house, and it's very good. In my experience it has a tendency to puff up while baking, so make sure it's thin on the pan unless you want deep dish!

Love this recipe!  I make enough for 3 batches, cut them all in half and end up having 6 big crusts for a whole cookie sheet pan.  Make the one and freeze the rest.  Perfect!

Best whole wheat pizza dough that I have made.  I put the ingredients in my bread machine and let it do all the work for me.  Crunchy crust and soft on the inside.  This will be my new pizza dough recipe.

Great Recipe!  I followed the advice of S Griffin, and baked it for 17 mins @ 350, put on toppings, baked for 15-20 mins @ 350, and then on broil for 5 mins to slightly brown the cheese.  I used a regular sized metal pizza pan & substituted flour for wheat germ.  The crust came out just the way I like, crispy on the bottom, not at all dry in the middle.  I would definitely recommend prebaking the crust before adding toppings.  This was the first time I’ve tried this.  The top of the crust didn’t come out soggy from all the toppings.  Prebaking it first gave the top time to crisp instead of soaking up the juice from the meat and veggies.  From now on I will definitely prebake my crust.  I’ve tried different pizza crust recipes and this is my favorite.  The other recipes I found bland.  I can’t quite put my finder on it, but this crust just really added to the enjoyment of the pizza.  I think it was the honey.  Without a doubt, the best recipe I’ve come across yet.  One thing I will do differently next time, I will only use half the dough.  My crust came out a little too thick for my liking 1.5cm or 0.6inches for the Americans (I measured).  I strongly recommend this recipe!!

I used to make a different whole wheat crust that I loved, so I was reluctant to try something new...but wow, am I glad I did! This was SO good. It was not as bread-like as other whole wheat crusts (unless you let it rise for longer than directed). I let mine rise only 15min in the microwave after I nuked a cup of water for a minute to make it warm. I rolled it out onto a pizza stone dusted with corn meal. I pre-baked at 425 for 7min. Afterwards, I brushed the edges with olive oil and sprinkled with parmesian and garlic. Then I topped with sauce, mozzerella, feta, tomatos, pepper rings, red onions. I sprinkled basil and a touch of olive oil over the whole thing and baked at 425 for 15 minutes. [One more thing--I subbed oat bran for the wheat germ.] Perfect, chewy, delicious! Thank you so much; this will be my new recipe from now on!

I've made this a couple times and everyone really enjoyed it. I didn't have wheat germ so I substituted ground flax seeds. Great healthy recipe!!!

This was really good. I've made it twice now. The first time it came out a little undercooked, even though I followed others' advice to bake it longer. The second time was perfect though. I baked it 20 minutes, then added the toppings and baked another 15. This would be delicious on it's own, I'm thinking about trying to make bread sticks out of it next time.

I used to buy pre-made crusts at the store, but this recipe is so simple and tasty that there's no reason to anymore! I always double the recipe and make three crusts--this gives me a crust that's on the thin side, but still soft. The recipe forgets to mention what you're supposed to do with the honey; add it to the yeast and water :). This is my go-to pizza dough recipe. Wrap these in plastic-wrap or foil and they freeze great!

My husband enjoyed this pizza dough, but I thought it would have been better if it was crispier (it was still soft after 20 minutes in the oven - maybe because we cooked it on a pizza stone?).  Next time I will try dividing this recipe in half to get two smaller, thinner crusts.

This recipe was very easy and very tasty.  I divided the dough into four equal portions and pre-baked the mini crusts and then stashed them in the freezer.  Now when I get home and I'm in a rush, I just grab a crust out of the freezer, warm it up in the microwave for about 30 seconds, top it with some diced tomatoes, cheese and fresh herbs, pop it in the oven for a few minutes and I have a quick meal.

if your main concern is finding something healthy to use as a pizza crust, this is a great option.  if you want something that tastes anything like pizza crust... not really the recipe for you.  this is very tasty and yeasty but has a definite bread-like texture and flavor.  the more you let it rise, the breadier it will be.  if you bake it immediately without any rising, it will be more like a basic pizza crust... although, without any rising, this will only cover one cookie sheet.

I am so glad I found this recipe-I have been wanting a fast whole wheat pizza dough recipe.  Very easy and tasty.  To keep the dough from sticking to the pan, I sprayed the pan with cooking spray, then sprinkled it with grated parmesan (the kind that comes in a plastic jar) and cornmeal.

My whole family loves this crust - it is now our "go to" recipe for pizza crust/breadsticks, etc...
My husband loves the thick chewy crust, and I like the thin crust becuase it doesn't seem to sit in a lump in my stomach for the next hour. This is the perfect remedy for us both - it's a nice thick chewy crust but it's light at the same time and doesn't sit in like a ball in my stomach all night. It truly is awesome - and the flavor - I can't say enough about it. TRY IT TRY IT TRY IT - you won't regret it!!

I didn't really find this recipe that user-friendly. It ended up tasting good, considering it's whole grain, but the crust was really hard on the bottom and quite a few sections were completely stuck to the pan. I guess you need to put a LOT of flour on the pan and make sure there are no sticky bits underneath before you bake. Not sure what caused the crust to be hard on the bottom for me. 

Because this recipe is so healthy for pizza crust, I'll probably try it again using lots of flour on the pan.

Absolutely delcious. I, like other reviewers, let the dough rise for about 20 to 25 minutes. Turning your oven to 200 then shutting it off is a good warm place for the dough to sit. I also made made 8 individual pizzas instead of a 12 incher, and it worked out WONDERFULLY.  Super quick, super healthy, super tastey. Thanks.

This is by far the best pizza dough I have ever made. Thank you so much for posting this easy recipe! The only suggestion I have is to spray non-stick spray (or lightly oil) the pizza pan when rolling it out. We had some minor issues with the crust sticking to the pan, but it was still tasty none the less!

Yum!  I'm a pizza fanatic and was really anxious to find a healthy crust.  This was great.  I followed the previous reviewer's suggestion and microwaved a cup of water, then put the crust in the microwave to rise.  I let it rise for 10 minutes, but it didn't rise much.  I didn't have any more time, so I rolled it out anyhow.  I pre-baked it for 12 minutes at 350, and it rose significantly.  Added toppings and cooked for another 10 minutes.  Came out tasting great.  However, it really stuck to my pan.  I floured well as suggested in the recipe, but next time I'll use cooking spray.

My husband is not a healthy eater so I was worried what he would think of this dough.  He loved it!  In fact he said it was the best homemade pizza he has ever had.  I divided the dough into 4 sections and let the kids make their own pizzas.  I also snuck in some flax seed powder!

I just kicked off with a "get fit" program and was delighted to taste this wonderful wheat pizza! I let the dough rise twice, added a bit of wheat flour when I pulled it out of the bowl and it cooked up perfectly. I follwed the advice to cook it 15 mintues before putting on toppings and it was perfect.

Not so much like pizza dough, but still really good and super easy. I had all the ingredients on hand, so that helped. It was all gone at the end of the meal.  I would definately make again (if I had everything on hand).

I didn't use a pizza stone, but a cookie sheet instead (didn't realize I'd need one). I took about 40 minutes to make sure that it was cooked through. Very delicious.

My kids ate this!  We can eat pizza and not feel guilty!  Wonderful.  I did let the dough rise a bit before baking - baked about 10 minutes, then added ingredients for a wonderful pizza.  I also coated my pizza stone with olive oil and it did not stick at all.

I was excited to try this.  But to me it didn't taste anything like a pizza crust.  Mine came out tasting like I took wheat flour and mixed it with water and baked it.  Maybe I did something wrong...  I think I will stick to crusts that rise more.

A little bit hard, but given it's whole wheat, it can't be helped.  I ran out of wheat germ, so I used some crushed bran flakes.  But I think wheat germ would've given it a nicer flavor and aroma.  I also only used 3/4 cup water.

I thought this recipe was great!  I, like other reviewers, found the dough very sticky and had to knead it on a surface with all-purpose, unbleached flour for about 3-5 minutes.  I also, put a little olive oil on the pan and sprinkled it with cornmeal before putting the dough on.  Would make again...like that it's healthy.

I made this crust for SuperBowl Sunday for the first time, and what a hit it was!  Some dough did rise for about and hour, and other batches of dough was used almost right away.  Both came out fine! My company was thrilled that the Pats won (I live in Boston), and that we had a different kind of pizza to celebrate this occassion!!!!  This recipe is a definate keeper.

Delicious!! I just added a bit more flour (and left out the wheat germ), then let it rise for about 20 minutes. I didn't roll it out very thin, to please the thick-crust lovers in my house, and it turned out so airy and chewy! This is certainly a recipe I'll be using again!

Very easy recipe! I didn't have any wheat germ on hand so I left that out and doubled the honey.  I also added dried herbs and red chili flakes to the dough to spice it up, and about 3 teaspoons of grapeseed oil to moisten it. I would recommend pre-baking it for about 10-15 minutes at 400 before adding the toppings to avoid mushiness. My dough was very wet but I kneaded it once during the rest process and even though it didn't form a ball it was easy to form.

Such a delicious healthy alternative to take-out pizza! Since I started watching what I eat and cutting out a lot of processed foods, I thought I was going to have to say goodbye to pizza forever, but not with this! Like other reviewers, I cooked the crust for an extra 8 minutes or so at 400 degrees to get it nice and crispy before I added my toppings. I will definitely be making this again, thank you!

I didn't care for this pizza crust at all. The flavor just wasn't right. I prefer a crispy crust so I baked for 10 minutes before adding the toppings, then raised oven temp to 425 hoping to get it crispy. No matter what I tried, the crust was chewy.

Taste wise is was pretty good. I'm not sure what happened because the dough was very sticky on the roller and I had trouble rolling the dough out. Needless to say, I didn't get 12 servings.  Taste, texture was on point. I would definitely use this again!

Quick, easy pizza dough that tastes great and crisps up nicely. No reason to ever buy frozen/instant pizza dough again.

Even non-whole grain eating hubby liked this one.  Used flaxseed meal in place of the wheat germ, as that is what I had on hand, and added Italian spices before placing in the fridge for about 6 hours - probably could have left on the counter instead, as it did not rise then.  Put in warm spot about an hour before using.  Did not poke with holes and precooked about 10 minutes before adding toppings.  Thanks for sharing!

I carefully followed the recipe and had trouble with it rising.  I too thought the wheat flavor in the crust was overpowering, but there was little other flavor.  I prefer a crispier crust, but this one was very chewy.  I will keep looking for that perfect 100% whole wheat crust recipe.

Might be operator error but I was not a fan.  I made 2 batches for a girl's night and while everyone said they liked it no one wanted to take leftovers home.  I found it to be too chewy and not crispy enough for my own taste.  I actually wound up scraping the ingredients off the pizza.  I had such high hopes, might try it one more time and use the bread maker or mixer with dough hook.

I wanted to love this, but it seemed kind of dry tasting....even with me making sure not to over flour the dough.  I sprayed the pan and coated it with cornmeal to prevent sticking.  I prebaked it for 8 mins on 400 degrees then cooked it with ingredients for 15 mins.

I read some of the comments and took some advice.  I needed enough dough for a 14-inch stone, so I used 1-1/2 times the water, flour (though I used whole what pastry flour), wheat germ and salt, the one package of yeast, and 2 tbsp of honey.  It rolled nicely on my stone.  I baked it at 400 for 15 minutes, which was a few minutes too long; however, after adding my ingredients for a Greek pizza and baking it another 12 minutes, it was crispy and very yummy.  Next time I won't prebake it as long or I might decrease the heat to the recommended 350.  Definitely a crust I'll try again.  Yummy!

This is excellent.  I made the dough in the breadmachine and doubled the recipe.  I also let one of the crusts rise in a 200 degree oven before baking the crust for about 15 mins at 350.  Then I let it cool (wanted to make pizza the next night after getting home from work).  I topped it later with pesto, mozzarella cheese, and sliced tomatoes, then baked at 425 for 15 minutes.  It turned out perfectly.  I'm making a breakfast pizza with the other crust today.   I also prebaked that crust, but didn't let it rise, and it will be a bit of a thin crust.  It looks like if you let your crust rise you can get a thick crust without having to double the recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this tonight. Didn't have any wheat germ. My crust came out very tasty... but HARD AS A ROCK! 
I grind my own wheat... maybe this is the reason it was so tough.
I'll try it again with a little more water & honey, or a little less flour.

Keeping in mind this is a healthier choice for pizza I give this recipe 5 stars. Easy to make. Tasted better the second time I made, as i rolled dough out to a thinner crust.

Made this tonight for dinner, but didn't have any wheat germ so I used ground flaxseed instead. Not sure if it made a difference since I've never made it with wheat germ. I cooked it for 15 mins at 350, put on toppings and then cooked again for another 10-15 mins and it turned out great. Crunchy on the bottom and outside and chewy on the outer crust. It was pretty good, but not amazing, thus the four stars.

It was OK.  More like bread than a crust.  Maybe it makes a difference which brand of whole wheat flour you use...  I'll try it again, perhaps use more flour so it's less sticky, and will revise my review at that time.

Very healthy-tasting.  I made this crust for a barbecue chicken pizza & it worked really well with it.

I made this last weekend.  I didn't have any wheat germ, so I used gluten instead.  I put everything in my bread-maker and put it on the "dough" setting.  It came out beautifully! It was a perfect texture.  We used the whole recipe for one large pizza and it fluffed up nicely and made a beautiful "pan style" crust. It tasted even better than pizza dough made with white flour because it had a nice nutty, deep, rich flavor. This is going to be a staple in our house from now on!

This was my first attempt at making pizza dough.  It couldn't have been any easier and it was delicious! The recipe makes enough for 1 large pizza with regular crust thickness.  I cooked my crust for 12 minutes, topped it and then cooked it again until everything was melted and warmed through.  Perfect!

Very good taste! Even my processed-food loving hubby loved it despite how healthy it is! I doubled the recipe to make a x-large pizza, but ended up being x-large and way too thick... Next time I will make one recipe for a thinner crust.

Well, although this seems like a good idea, it just wasn't what my family likes. It really is too dense. It was much like having a bagel pizza on a whole wheat bagel, the dense kind. And there is no flavor. I know that many reviewers mentioned that they added things to the crust and I think that's a good idea. Anyway, it was fun to make and I'm glad I gave it a try :) However, my 12yr old son is eating a bowl of cereal right now because he couldn't manage to eat an entire slice ;o)

Yummy! Made this for my family and they all said it was the best crust they have ever tasted. It's crunchy and chewy in all the right places with a slight sweet honey taste. This will be my recipe for my pizza crusts from now on!

My boyfriends response "you cooked this like you knew what you were doing".  I enjoyed this recipe a lot. This was my first time making dough from scratch ever and it turned out perfectly!  I am on this no white sugar no white flour lots of whole grains kick and this recipe served me well! I have entered it into my cookbook to stay and enjoy!  I made my own pizza sauce and topped it off with mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, and soy pepperoni (because my boyfriend doesn't eat pork) and mozzarella! Delicious

Its a tasty recipe, but kind of a pain to make. The best way to cook the crust is to cook it first, then add your pizza ingredients and bake again. That extra step is a pain for me, but when I do make this crust it is very good.

This was an excellent recipe. I have FINALLY found the dough I will use for making pizza. My husband raved about this, and I didn't tell him until after he was done that it was whole wheat and he STILL loved it and told me to make it again! ;)

By far the best homemade pizza crust I've eaten. The addition of the honey is nice. My hubby and I like it because it's healthy and delish! Make sure to pre-bake it for at least 15 minutes, and if you're using a pizza stone, be sure to preheat that before pre-baking the pizza.

This was pretty good. Didn't have the wheat germ, but subbed for whole wheat flour and it turned out well. I halved the recipe and plan to make breadsticks with the leftovers. Pre baked before topping. I think I need practice to perfect this recipe, but I will try again.

Delicious!  This recipe makes a thick, chewy dough that is just a little bit sweet.  My boyfriend blanched at the idea of whole wheat pizza dough but he loved it and now this is the only recipe we use when we make homemade pizza.

I didn't give this 5 stars because it wasn't very crust-like. It was a great tasting bread-y product, but not the right texture expected for a pizza crust. Will definitely use again for breadsticks :)

I thought this recipe was good as written but I do think it needs a few modifications for my tastes. I normally like whole grain products however it was bit too strong for my liking. I'll be making this again and here's what I'll  sub: 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour. I'm also going to try increasing the honey to 2 1/2 tbsp and then using cooking spray to grease the pan as my dough stuck to the pan significantly. Overall not a bad recipe!

This recipe was amazing!!! The only changes I made were adding italian seasing to the dough and I didn't have wheat germ so I add an extra 1/4 wheat flour! I turned the oven on 500 for a couple of minutes. Then turned it off and put the bowl of dough in it to rise. Super simple and very yummy!! ***I just made this again and added 1 tbsp italian seasoning and 1 tsp garlic powder to the dough...fabulous! I also made it in my bread machine which was nice to just dump the ingredients and let the machine do the work.

This was DELICIOUS!  I made it for our Superbowl party and it was a hit.  I did bake it on a pizza stone that I heated to 400 then sprinkled corn meal on it before I put the dough on.  Then baked the dough for 10 min before I put the toppings on. It's fast and wholesome!  Thanks for such a great recipe.

I made this the other night.  I WANTED to like it because I know it's healthier, but it just tasted too healthy for me.  It's definitely decent tasting for a healthy recipe, but I probably won't make this again.

A really good dough. I followed advice of other reviewers and let the dough rise first for at least 30 min, then let it rest on the pan for another 15, then pre-baked for 5 min at 425, then baked with toppings for 15 min at 400. Came out great. It stuck to the pan a bit, but wasn't burnt. After pressing the pizza down, peel it off and make sure there's a nice dusting of flour/cornmeal to help it not stick as much. Also, I brushed a bit of olive oil on the crust before adding the sauce. It seemed like the right thing to do.

After using this recipe a few times my husband and I finally had to admit it was time to look for a new recipe. The sweetness of the honey is a great addition but we are preferential to a crust the crisps up a bit better (we even tried baking on the rack!). I love that this is a nice healthy recipe compared to other options out there. If you prefer thicker crusts, this is a great option!

Great pizza dough.  I didn't have wheat germ, substituted milled flax seed.  Dought was awesome - baked it first then added pizza toppings and baked.  Wonderful!!

Just the way I like pizza crust. I used all whole wheat flour though, and made it just one pizza crust so it was nice and thick.I will use this every time I make pizza.

Added 1/4 C oil.  A great crust plain or with added seasonings.  I've put garlic powder and some herbs in and tastes good either way.  Agree with others that letting it rise at least 15 minutes makes it not so flat.  Also, I cooked the crust for 10 minutes befor adding toppings, pressed down the middle part up to the edge to make a depression for toppings and create a crust.  Another tip is to let the sauce bake a few minutes before adding the rest of the toppings so the crust doesn't get soggy like whole wheat crusts tend to do. We've tried several whole wheat pizza crust recipes, and really like this one.  Just right.

We did not care for this recipe and ended up throwing it out.  We followed the recipe exactly and our dough was very sticky, and after cooking it was thick and heavy.  The honey and wheat taste overpowered the pizza - looking for something more authentic.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  I tried it based on the reviews however, I was very concerned when I began rolling out the dough on my baking stone.  It looked so dense and I worried it would taste like cardboard.  It rose nicely in the oven and looked great coming out of the oven.  The great thing is my kids loved it!!  I love that it is a good tasting healthy alternative to white crust.  I will be making this again.

Not bad, but mine came out a bit tough and a little bland. Needs salt and maybe a longer rise.

This had a really good flavor, and I felt good about the fact that it was whole wheat. I made it in my bread machine, and thought it was really sticky after a few minutes of rising. It was still pretty sticky even half an hour later. We make our pizzas using Mario Batalli's method of starting on the stovetop and then finishing under the broiler. I was able to wrangle the dough, even as sticky as it was, by coating my hands with a little olive oil before forming the crusts. Next time I plan on increasing the flour slightly to try to compensate for the board flour it would have picked up being kneaded by hand.

I tried this recipe and it turned out great!  This is only my second time making homemade pizza dough and my husband and I actually enjoyed it!  I agree with everyone elses comments, I let it rise for 45 mins. 

Very yummy!

I used my bread maker so substituted for 2 teaspoons of bread machine yeast, and put ingredients in per the instruction on the bread maker (liquids first, yeast last). We really liked the crust. It made enough for 2 very thin but large crusts. We will definitely make again.

Maybe it's personal preference, but the thinner the crust, the better. The dough seems too dense and overpowers the the pizza toppings if the crust isn't thinned out. Nevertheless, the honey makes this crust really scrumptious.

Excellent! I didn't have wheat germ but I added 2 tbs oil to the dough which prevented it from getting very hard. As other reviewrs mentioned I worked with it while it was a little sticky. Let it rise before rolling it and then again in the pan. Turned out perfect and very delicious from the first time. I sure will keep this recipe.

Very good. I don't use the wheat germ, but I've made this recipe several times and it is fine without it. My crust rises a bit more then in the picture. I also will add some glutton if I feel like it - that makes it rise quite a bit more.

I hate to give bad reviews, but I didn't have good results with this recipe.  I followed it exactly and ended up with salty, dense dough that barely rose, not even in the oven!  I made sure not to over-work the dough and had the water at the right temperature for the yeast, but I still ended up with bad results...

I really like the end result of the recipe. I was not able to find wheat germ so I used milled flax instead. Also, I had to use a generous handful of wheat flour to help the dough from being impossibly sticky when kneading it. I allowed it to rise for 10 mins in an olive oil greased bowl covered with plastic wrap. I then pushed it to the edges of my pizza pan and allowed it to rise for an additional 10 mins. I then baked it in a 375 oven for 10 mins. I finally topped it with sauce and cheese and baked for 15 mins. Good flavor, very tender and didn't "sag" when slice was held up.

Good, not amazing. I will make it again because it's so good for you. I made a sixth of the recipe into a single serving pizza. Next time I'll put way more toppings on (I did half cheese and fresh basil, half cheese/pineapple/mushroom) to balance the breadiness.

Delicious! I took an idea from another recipe (Pesto Pizza, found on this site) and added 1/2 tsp. oregano, 1/2 tsp. basil, and 1/8 c. Parmesan cheese to the dough. I will definitely make this again!

This was good for what it was. Chewy and fairly fluffy. I used Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site, which added a wonderfully sweet touch, and topped with veggies and browned sausage. Easy because you don't have to let it rise forever! Thanks for a yummy healthy recipe.

Great recipe!! I made this in my bread machine.  Made with 1/2 Whole wheat and 1/2 White flour, no wheat germ, added 1 Tbsp of EVOO. My son then took over and made the pizza, pre-baked crust 8 minutes prior to topping and baking for 10 minutes.  We will be making again, son says "It rocks". Thanks for the recipe and all the tips too!!

Very easy to make, and tasty and good for you too. The only changes I made were to let the dough rise a few times, and I used olive oil on the pan instead of flour. The crust did not stick to the pan at all. I pre-cooked the dough for 10-12 minutes before topping it and baking it again.

Hubby did not like this.  It was a good dough, but having lived in Sicily for a couple of years, we really wanted something more authentic.  This is a good and healthy recipe, but not what we were looking for.

Yum!! We often by wheat pizza dough from our grocery deli, but this was so much better! I love that you didn't have to wait for the yeast to rise, like other dough recipes. Like others, I prebaked the crust at 350 for 10 minutes, then added my toppings (artichoke pesto sauce,  onions, garlic, chicken, and cheeses) and bake for 10 more minutes. Thanks so much! This will become a standby for us!

Really really good.  I split it, froze half and rolled half out thin and then topped it with marinara sauce, mozzarella cheese, red peppers, chicken, red onions, and raw broccoli.  It was wonderful.  Ate half of the pizza, took the other half to work the next day.  So I can vouch that it is quick and tastes good right then, reheated, and baking after freezing! Thanks!

This tasted somewhat like pizza on wheat bread. The texture was very soft, and not what I would think of as pizza at all. The boyfriend loved it, though, so  perhaps I'm expecting too much from it.

WOW!  Simple, quick and fulfilling!  I would suggest doubling up the recipe, as otherwise the crust is very thin.  Combine this the "exquisite pizza sauce" recipe also found on allrecipes for a great dinner.  My 5 year old drowns all pizza (homemade and takeout) in ketchup.  He did not request it this time, and said it was the best pizza he had ever had!!!!!

I thought the whole wheat crust at the local pizza joint in the college town where I live was good, but this is even better. I've made it a half-dozen times with great results and we are now fully converted to a healthier pizza. I suggest coating the ball of dough with a bit of oil (olive is my choice) before letting it rise, a la Chef Boyardee.

Very good! It was quick and easy, and I even substituted bran for the wheat germ. I think next time I'll put a bit of olive oil under the dough, because it stuck to my non-stick pizza pan with great ferocity! For this recipe, a thin crust is probably better, as it can be overpowering to your pizza.

I like it.  Mine didn't rise as much as I thought it would, and it was a little hard to roll out (kept tearing), but it produced a yummy, healthier crust - which is what I was aiming for.  I made a buffalo chicken pizza (recipe found on this site).

We loved the crust! I would cook it about 15 minutes before putting on the crust next time to get it "crispier" but otherwise, it's great.

I'll probably make this again but I would suggest pre-baking the crust a few minutes before adding the toppings for a crisper crust. I found it to be a bit doughy.

I baked at 350 for 10 minutes, let cool slightly, ramped up the heat in the oven to 425.  Sauce, fresh basil, pepperoni, green pepper, pepperoncini, and black olives, mozzarella cheese.  I did oil my hands to handle the dough and rolled on a floured surface.  I am thinking without oil, the crust texture doesn't really get flaky.  I rolled thin and I think we are just used to flakier crust.  Tastes ok, I would add more honey.

I added one teaspoon of sugar to the yeast mixture.

Rolled out the dough on two 13x9 inch cookie sheets and pre-baked the dough for 2-3 minutes at 525F. 

I then topped the pizza with our favorite toppings and baked them an additional 5-6 minutes at 525F. 

Very good recipe!

I would make this again. The flavor was great. I would flour as well as grease the pan and because I did not have a pizza stone but only a metal pizza pan, next time I think I will try sliding the entire pizza onto the oven rack for the last few minutes of baking so as to crisp up the underside of the crust. DEFINITELY a hit!

We loved the crust!  We are switching from white bread to whole wheat so we were not sure we would.  We added more water to the dough and floured the counter to make it easier to work.  We also made 2 crusts out of 1 batch so we could have different toppings.  My husband got on a roll and made 1 too many batches.  We baked them and plan to freeze them.  We'll see how they do.

This is my favorite pizza dough recipe. It is crunchy on the outside but still with a chewy inside. The flavor is fantastic. I made with RapidRise yeast so you incorporate the yeast with the dry ingredients and just add some warm water to your well. This will be my go-to pizza dough recipe. Don't change a thing.

Even for someone who typically never has any luck working with yeast, it was pretty good. Followed some other suggestions ( oven at 425, pre-baking crust before adding toppings) and even my boyfriend gave me a big thumbs up! Admittedly I am my own worst critic, so I will definitely make this again.  Also....you can use wheat bran instead of wheat germ as they are interchangeable ( I did some research, lol). Loved it!! :)

WOW, really good dough!  Even though it only took about 15 minutes to rise, the flavor was there.  After we rolled it out, we placed it on a greased pizza pan, brushed it with olive oil and sprinkled with herbs.  Pre-baked at 350F for about 7 minutes, added the toppings, and baked again for 10 minutes...  turned out great!

Stuck to the pan, didn't rise well, and was very dry. I like using a 50/50 whole wheat/white flour naan recipe for pizza dough and will go back to that next time around.

I used flax seed in place of wheat germ - because I had it on hand. I let it rise for 10 minutes after mixing dough although I didn't notice much change in shape. I prebaked for 5 minutes at 400 then topped and baked a few minutes more.  The crust did rise as it was baked more than I expected so we had a bit of a cakey crust.  Will probably spread it thinner before baking next time. (I had spread it to a 12" circle.)

It was not bad. I think I will add some Italian seasoning to the dough next time, and perhaps sprinkle some Parmesan on the outside of the crust. I forgot to bake it before topping it. Based on my results, I think this is an essential step I should not have omitted.

Pretty good. May want to cook longer than 15 minutes, however.

This is great but 400 degrees was a better baking temperature.  I got crispy crust by prebaking for 5 minutes and then baking with toppings for 5 to 7 more minutes.  This is a time saving recipe even over store bought dough.Thanks !

My 10 year old made the dough all by herself and my 5 year old added all toppings.  We cooked it for 15 minutes in 325 convection bake since the turkey hamburger meat was raw, so we wanted it to cook all the way.  We then broilef it for 3-4 minutes to crisp the top a little.  I think next time we'll add a little bit more honey done it tasted more yeasty.  We did substitute more wheat flour for wheat germ since we didn't have it.  Otherwise, it was good but next time I'll make it all myself and see if it makes a difference.

This was GREAT - I meant to pre-bake before I added my toppings but got side-tracked and forgot. I was worried it wouldn't be crispy enough but it was just right. I followed the recipe exactly. My first attempt went awry...I used whole wheat flour from the freezer (DUH) and got a whole wheat ROCK as a result. I don't know if any others may have a blonde moment but must use room temperature flour :)   
Will make again soon

The dough was relatively quick and easy to make. The flavor was okay but the consistency was much more like bread than traditional pizza crust. It was just far too dense. Overall, we agreed that we'd prefer dough that was a bit less healthy and a bit more tasty.

Such a surprisingly delicious, hearty, and healthful crust!  I mixed everything in my bread maker under the dough setting and it worked great.  I oiled my hands with olive oil before shaping one quarter of the dough into a small 6" pizza pan and the rest onto a 12" pizza pan.  I baked the 6" crust for 7 minutes, loaded it with ranch, vegis, and cheddar and then baked it for 5 more minutes.  I baked the 12" for 10 minutes, let it cool, and have frozen it for future use.  I baked everything at 400 degrees.  The only thing I changed was using 1 cup of BF in place of the wheat germ.

This was awesome :)
I had to substitute Flaxseed for the wheat germ, it still turned out yummy. The only problem was that I burned the bottom...I should know better since I've worked in pizza shops before! My toddler ate up the slice I gave him of the pizza that I made out of this.

It was really easy to make!  However, I wonder if my flour was a bit old because it didn't stretch out as nicely when I tried to roll it.  Overall, it was a success!

I made this today and WOW it was execellent!!!  The taste of the crust is incredible.  The crust turned out kind of dry & chewy though, but in fairness this was my very first attempt at making homemade pizza so it could have been something I did.  Next time I'm going to add some olive oil to the dough but it still tasted awesome !!  I look forward to making this many more times!!

I loved this easy peasy dough! 
Note: I've made this 2 times and I had to add more flour, since the dough was too sticky. The third time I slowly added the honey and yeast mixture, just until combined well. It turns out great. 
Also I sprinkled cornmeal on the pizza stone before I rolled the dough directly on top. It definitely gave it a more crispier bottom.
Thanks brookes for a yummy recipe!

Oh, this was so good...and so easy to make!  I actually made turnovers with the dough...filled with ham/cream cheese/mushrooms and ham/broccoli/swiss.  Oh, so good!  I will use this dough for many, many other things!

Delicious. I would definitely recommend baking this for at least 15 minutes at the recommended bake time, however. 10 minutes was just a little less than perfect- a bit too chewy and not that crispy. 15 minutes would have been ideal. Even still, it was so good! The honey adds a nice touch to it. It is a sticky dough, but if you use a bit of flour (or olive oil) you can work with it pretty easily. Bake the crust first and then top it and bake again for a few minutes. Will definitely be making again :)

This was good. Tasted good but you could very much tell it was whole wheat. Made this the night before in the bread machine, stored half in the fridge for the next day  and half in the freezer for later in the week. I think I pre-baked it too long the first night and it was pretty tough but didn't bake as long the next time and it was much better.

I found this dough very dry and hard to work with, even after adding a bit of olive oil to it. When cooked, this reminded me more of bread, than of a pizza dough. Was something different to try, but not something I'll try again.

This was very good. I left out the wheat germ because they were out at the grocery store. It was very quick and easy for a pizza crust, I doubled the recipe so I can freeze some for later. I'm not giving this 5 stars because it was a very chewy crust, my jaw is a little tired from eating it! But maybe it was chewy because I didn't have wheat germ, not sure. I also baked it at a higher temperature- 10 min just the crust, no toppings at 350, and another 10 min w/ toppings at about 415. Anyway, I'll make this again because it was so easy and quick.

I must have done something wrong. My dough didnt really rise. It was a flat, dry and crunch dough. I like the flavor but would not make this dough recipe again.

Today was my first time to try this recipe.  It was a tasty crust but just a little bit too heavy with the wheat  flour (for me).  I am going to add part white flour next time that I make it.  I am sure that I will enjoy it more.  Also I will double the recipe... my husband and family enjoyed it very much!!

I am very impressed w/ this recipe! Very yummy! I did let my dough rest for about an hr in a humid microwave as suggested by KGOLD, then put it in fridge for a few more, until I was ready to cook. With a little flour and EVOO, it rolled out very easily on my pizza stone. I forgot to poke holes in it, but nothing bad happened!

I ran out of wheat flour, so I used half bread flour and half whole wheat. I then dumped all the ingredients into my bread machine and set it on dough setting. This crust was so good! I think this is going to be my go to pizza dough. Thanks!

YUM!  This was a great pizza dough recipe!  I did use half unbleached all purpose flour and the other half wheat flour.  Otherwise the wheat flavor is a bit too strong for my family.

The dough was as delicious as everyone says :)! I wouldn't say it makes 2 medium size pizzas per recipe but about 5 small round personal pizzas (or 1 medium).  Definitely let the dough rise for 20-30 minutes total. And you don't need the wheat germ. Using more wheat flour instead of wheat germ is good :)!

Great Pizza! This pizza had a great flavor even better than some regular pizzas that i had before. My family loved the flavor and my husband who doesn't like whole wheat bread didn't even noticed that the pizza was whole wheat pizza until i told him. I will keep making this recipe and i don't think i'll make regular pizza agiain. Thanks!

Excellent! Don't forget to grease the pan and then put some flour on it. Baked it for 5min at 425 and then added tomato sauce with oregano, fresh tomatoes and basil, goat cheese,and some mozzarella, and baked for 7 more minutes. Amazing and healthy!

This was so good! I was out of wheat germ, so I substituted flax seed. I mixed the dough in my bread maker, prebaked the dough, and brushed the crust with olive oil and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. My kids griped the whole time I was making the crust because it was "healthy". My oldest two ate 4 pieces each! They quickly decided healthy wasn't so bad after all! Thanks for sharing!

This is our favorite crust.  As others suggested, be sure to pre-bake and loosen from pan prior to adding toppings.  Also, will need some white flour near for your hands as the dough is somewhat sticky.

I used this recipe for homemade pizza on the BBQ. (You just oil one side of the dough, put it right on the BBQ rack, let it puff and brown on the bottom, flip it over and add your toppings and cook until desired crispiness - so tasty!) It turned out great! It's a simple, easy recipe that tastes great - perfect for a quick meal or snack. And it's a lot healthier too!:)

Easy enough to make with my bread machine. It grilled quite nicely, if not just a tad crispy and thick. All in all, I use this dough whenever I'm doing a healthy pizza!

I thought this crust was delicious and easy to make! I don't have a pizza stone and just used a cookie sheet and it came out great!! I did take advice from several other reviewers and baked the crust alone for 15 min at 350, then added toppings, then baked again for about... 10-15 minutes until I thought it looked melty enough and that the crust was cooked through (not too doughy). Will absolutely be making this again!!

Delicious and good recipe!  A healthier crust and you can make it to your liking - softer or crisper. I made an excellent cheese pizza out of it.  It was pretty quick and easy too.

Great recipe... This was my first time making pizza dough... I did not have the wheat germ but it came out fine without it. The kids loved making mini pizzas with the topping of thier choice. mmmm I also made some for my parents and uncle who also thought it was great! :D

Very tasty. I rolled the crust out nice and thin, and baked it for seven minutes before adding any toppings. Also, I divided the dough into halves to make two pizzas, froze the second half, and used it a week later -- still very tasty! Finally, I added Italian spices to the dough (Oregano, Basil, etc.)... yum!

Oh, my!  If you would have told me that my husband, my 18 month old, my 3 year old and my 4 year old would all eat EVERY LAST CRUMB of this pizza, I would have been shocked!  They gobbled it up so quickly that the only conclusion is that it is deliciously yummy.  I have made it twice now with the same response.  I replace the wheat germ with whole wheat flour.  I actually grind my flour myself which I think makes it rise better and taste better, and I believe there are more nutrients in it as well.  thanks for the amazing recipe!!  (I do precook the crust for about 20 minutes, as mine turns out pretty thick.)

This pizza dough recipe has proven versatile and delicious. We first used it for chicken spinach and feta pizza as well as a traditional pizza with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese in the oven. We've recently expanded our horizons by using the recipe as the dough for a Southerwestern sweet and savory pizza (please see recipe).   Thanks for posting such a delicious and healthy recipe!

This was really good and so healthy for you. My husband and I are on a 'trying to get healthier' kick and thought this would be a good substitute for regular pizza dough. We were right! It was incredibly delicious and my husband said that he couldn't even tell the difference between regular pizza and this. Will definitely make again!

Wonderful recipe! Best homemade pizza we ever had! I added some oregano to the crust for an extra zing!

I wish this worked, because it had a pretty good flavor. It turned out chewy (in a bad way) and dense.

This wasn't for me. I used the dough to make two thin crusts. I didn't care for the taste or texture. I really prefer the Jay's Signature Pizza Crust and the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust.

Easy and good. I took a suggestion from another reviewer and substituted half a cup of all purpose flour into the total amount, and it still tasted plenty healthy! I topped it with olive oil, garlic, cheese, and veggies. Next time I won't use garlic with this sweetish dough, but I will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks!

Used this as my healthy recipie exchage for going out to eat.  I think it's delicious.  I've already shared this recipie with my mom and sister and they make it in their homes now too.  It can just be really heavy though.  One slice sometimes does me in!

I thought that this was a great recipe.  I'm trying to be healthier, and one step towards that is to substitute anything white, with brown.  So this whole wheat dough was right up my street.  I've never made home-made pizza before, so I was very happy with the results.    The only change I made as that with my fast action dry yeast, I added it to the flour, and as I used hard honey, I melted it in the warm water that was originally meant to be used for the yeast instead.  It was this water that I added into the well.    All in all I thought it was a great recipe and will definitely use it again.  My partner thought it was very tasty!

TO DIE FOR! Simple and so much more tasty than a white dough. I let the dough rise for a little while longer than the recipe says, other than that I stuck to it. Definitely one to try

I cannot even begin to tell you all how much I LOVE this dough. I use mine to make big pizza's, personal pizzas, and even calzones. For those of you having trouble with it if your yeast dosn't proof properly then there's no sense in continuing. The water needs to be warm at least 45 but not too warm. If it proofs properly it will be thick and creamy on top. If you don't see this then start over. This is my staple pizza dough recipe and is so chewy and healthy. Thanks a million for sharing.

This dough was delicious and easy to make. My husband said that the pizza was "better than one you'd get at a pizza place," which is saying a lot considering the man LOVES pizza! It took around 22 minutes for the pizza to cook all the way through; I think I should have cooked the dough a bit prior to cooking the pizza. For toppings, I just pre-sauteed some frozen mixed peppers and chopped up some fresh tomatoes and jalapenos for an extra kick. Delicious!

Good, but kind of doughy. I will definitely try this recipe again, but maybe change some things a little bit. This was my first pizza crust I've ever made, and it was very simple to do! I like the fact that it is healthy. :) I did not have a pizza pan, so I used a 8x12 pan instead. Next time I will use a pizza pan. (Hopefully that will make the pizza more crispy!)

4.5 stars, and only because I need to practice!  This was easy, healthy, and tasted great.  Had my bread maker do the mixing and rising.  Baked on a stone and brushed crust with an egg wash.  The bottom was a little tough, but still good.  THANKS

I wanted to try a whole wheat crust because it's so much healthier and this recipe is not bad for a whole wheat crust, but it's just not good enough to replace a traditional pizza crust.

I liked the taste of this pizza crust because I am a health nut, and I like the taste of wholesome foods. However, you have to think of it more like of a "bread" pizza. It's exactly how it tastes--pizza toppings on whole wheat bread. I like the taste of it, and knowing it's a healthier alternative with simple ingredients makes it a wonderful receipe!

Made this for dinner tonight and my husband and I both enjoyed it... I baked it on a Pampered Chef stone (lightly floured it to prevent sticking), and it turned out beautifully!  I followed another's advice and allowed it to rise in the microwave after heating a cup of water for a minute.  Pre-baked it for 10+ minutes.  I coated the crust with a mixture of butter and honey before adding the toppings...  really good!   The description says this makes a thin crust, but it's not what I would call thin... more of a hand-tossed!

Turned out pretty well for my first time making pizza dough!  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and let the dough rise for about 30 min before rolling it out.  Then I let it rise for about 10-15 minutes more before baking it.  I also let it cook for about 10 min before adding toppings.  Doubled the recipe and made two medium sized pizzas, about 8 clices each. I did not get a strong honey flavor that other reviewers mention, so I will probably add a little more next time, or brush some on the dough.  All in all, it was very good for a healthy pizza crust, but the whole wheat taste was strong. Made one pizza with goat cheese, sauteed spinach with garlic and oregeno, with a little shredded mozarella on top.  The second pizza had pizza sauce, shredded mozarella, chopped tomatoes, garlic, and fresh basil. If you like whole wheat pizza, you will enjoy this.

I used my bread machine to make the dough, so I made a couple of minor adjustments, but this was a good and healthy alternative to the enriched flour version. Thank you.

I would probably give 3 1/2 stars for taste, but rounded up to 4 stars because of the healthy recipe.  I baked the crust prior to adding toppings for 15 minutes.  The crust was still a bit soggy even after the pre-bake.  I used low fat mozzarella, jarred sauce (gasp) and turkey pepperoni.  It was a tasty pizza treat without all the guilt, but unfortunately I still prefer traditional pizza with a side of guilt.

Our family loves pizza, but we rarely make it at home. Since deciding to change the way we eat, this receipe spiked some interest. The one problem we seem to have is getting the dough to rise. It doesn't seem to rise much at all. Being that we have never made breads, we weren't exactly sure what to expect. We do add additional honey as we couldn't taste it the first time we made it. The other modifications we use - added ground flax seed, cooking the dough w/out toppings for 15 minutes w/a light coating of EVOO. We make this several times a month.

I made the recipe as stated and used it for the "Chicken Garlic Pizza" recipe from this site. Personally, I liked it. However, my hubby and kids did not. They said it was too dry. My husband's exact words were "it takes the joy out of pizza."   Keep in mind that I've just recently begun incorporating healthier foods into our diet...we're used to eating more processed foods. Maybe I'll look for a some kind of a "hybrid" crust.

Yummy! So glad I have a boyfriend who will put up with my health food obsession - he seemed a bit skeptical when the dough was being prepared, but we both loved our veggie loaded whole wheat pizza! I'll definitely make this again

Nope, just too thick or powerful wheat tasting.

Great pizza dough, but better made with half all purpose and half whole wheat flour!

Overall, I think the dough tasted probably pretty good.  I had a lot of user error though so I need to try it again and see if i get better results. I had a really thick edge of my crust and the pizza itself was really thin, so it was kind of hard to judge, but the crust was fun to dip in extra sauce like breadsticks, I might try making breadsticks out of it some time. I didn't let my dough rise long enough, and I couldn't think of where to put it that was warm.  I read the reviews/tips only after I was finished, or I might have been ok. Also, I used a stone to bake it on, and I read once that I should warm the stone prior to use so I was afraid to roll the dough on the stone itself, so i did a horrible job of transferring it on to the stone and it stretched really thin. I had a really cute edge/crust from the stretching though.

This was excellent! We couldn't find any wheat germ in our area---(the deep south!) and so we just used a little more wheat flour.

I've made this a few times now. Its really good.  Don't be afraid to let it be a little sticky.  The first time I made it I added too much flour and it was difficult to spread out.  If its sticky its easier to work with.

We loved this recipe.  The kids never guessed it was whole wheat with wheat germ. We rolled it thin and grilled it outside.  My daughter says its the best pizza she's had (not included any pizza she ate in Italy)

I was concerned about it being too dense so I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour. And it turned out great. Next time I will be brave and use whole wheat.

This recipe is great and moist! The honey is really a binder and does not add to the flavor. I usually take an extra tablespoon and brush  it along the crust! That adds the "wow" factor! Everyone loves this dough, even better than the dry whole wheat crust at our local pizza place!

I made this last night, and the crust of my pizza was delicious!  I did not find that it turned out dry as many of the other reviewers noted, and I followed several reviewers advice about cooking a few minutes before adding toppings and then another few minutes with toppings, though my cooking times were shortened as I used this recipe to make several individual pizzas.  

It's just me here, so with all the dough I'm in the midst of a little experiment.  I used half the dough to make a few mini pizza crusts, used one for my dinner, and froze the other half of the dough to make more later.  I just didn't know if the goodness would last better if I froze cooked bread to add toppings to or to freeze the dough to make the crust each time I want to have a mini pizza.  Anyway.  Those like me who are only cooking for one have to be a bit experimental with this stuff.

But the dough itself was really really good.  The honey addition was nice.  It didn't give off a honey taste per se, but rather just a nice hint of flavor.  I really enjoyed it, and mine came out crisp though next time I may leave in for a minute or two longer to enhance that.

Hubby said this was a keeper!! I kneaded in more flour after the rise. And let it rise again (total of 2x) because we weren't quite ready to make the pizza's. Turned out great. I halved the dough and made to thin crusts that I just rolled out on the pizza stones. Nice and crunchy and firm. The crust held up well with the weight of the toppings. Thanks for this healthy recipe!

So it tasted okay, the flavor was there. But the texture was poor. I made a sponge with the yeast, added it to the flour mixture (half whole-wheat, half bread flour), with the honey and salt. Hand kneaded for 15mins until gluten developed. It rose perfectly and doubled in 1.5hrs. I tossed to stretch and placed it in the pan. It stretched perfectly, nice and thin, great gluten strands. It rose again for 45mins, then I topped and placed it in the oven. Once baked no more rising occurred, dough was slightly dense and chewy. I will try a different recipe next time.

I'm always trying to find healthy alternatives to family favorites, but this will not be a keeper.  Unfortunately, this dough made a fairly tasteless cardboard-like crust.  Worth a try though...maybe it will work for you!

I was looking for a pizza dough to make with children and was getting discouraged when many had to rise for an hour and a half... This one is quick easy and healthy and it was very good. The dough while sitting did not rise like I thought it would but it still turned out great. I think I am going to make this again tonight or tomorrow!

Not sure what happened here, we usually love whole wheat breads.  I used un-toasted wheat germ...perhaps that was the problem.  Texture and flavor after baking were too doughy.  Baked for 12 minutes at 350 w/ ~1/2 inch thickness after rising.

I forgot to add the honey and still loved it!  I'm looking forward to trying it with the honey.

I used 1/2 unbleached white flour for bread making and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  This is a very good recipe! Thanks!

This dough is very good. My crust didn't bake up as crispy as I typically like, but I think that had to do more with the pan I used than the recipe. I am just glad I found a healthy pizza crust that actually tastes good. Thank you for sharing!

i loved this dough. It was easy to work with and roll out and it baked up nicely in the oven. The only thing i would make sure i do next time (this was my fault) is i should have baked the pizza crust before i put the toppings on because the sauce made the dough soggy even after it was baked. The dough had good flavour though i will just make that change next time. AND I LOVED THAT IT'S SO HEALTHY :)

I thought this tasted good. It's much more nutrtional than white bread crusts, but it was more "bready" than what I like. As far as homemade pizza crusts goes though it was excellent. My husband even said that it was the best he's ever had--and he loves pizza so he's tried a lot!

I made pizza dough for the first time today using this recipe. It was a hit. The wheat germ adds so much nutritional value to it, and no oil! I can't wait to make it again.

This is amazing - I'll never make another kind of pizza dough again.  Per other suggestions, I substituted flax for wheat germ and coated ball of dough with a little EVOO.  I tried rolling dough out delicately, but it takes some muscle!  Please give this a try - you'll be SO glad that you did.

I am always on the look for new healthy recipes.  This one was really good.  I made it twice in the same week.  The first time I made it, I felt like the crust came out too thick and a bit dry.  So the second time I made 2 pizzas with the same amount of dough, only this time I added about 1-2 tablespoons more water then the recipe called for.  It made the dough a bit sticky to work with but the end product was much better.  Sent the left overs in my husbands lunch the next day and he said it was almost as good cold too.  This one is definately a keeper.(Note: there was no need to precook the thinner crust)

This was really good but mine ended up sticking to the pan a bit.  My six year old loved it and so did my hubby.

This was the first time I had ever made pizza dough.  I followed the suggestion to bake the dough for 17 mins. before adding topping.  The dough turned out perfect!  Great texture, taste, and very easy to prepare.  I will make again and again.

My favorite pizza dough! I substitute ground flax for the wheat germ and toss in a handful of whole flax seeds. Yummy!!

I was in a big hurry and made this dough carelessly - the honey wasn't mixed in well and I rolled it out very messy.  It still turned out well with a good flavor.  I will make it again when I have time to make it right, but I was still impressed with the flavorful result of this recipe!

I found this crust to be quite dense and heavy.  My friend and I could only eat one piece each and then we just picked off the toppings.  I will try it one more time, but this time spread it really, really thin to see if that helps at all.

Dough looked and smelled really good, but, it was very tough.  It almost looked dry when spreading this out on the pan!  I think I will add a little more honey/water mixture next time to "loosen" the dough up and maybe fluff it out?  Good taste.  Picky boyfriend said it was ok.  Will try again!

Great healthier alternative to regular pizza crust.  Tastes great and pretty easy to make.  It is a little sweeter than regular pizza crust so would also be good for a dessert pizza too.

This was ok. It tasted good, but didn't puff like regular crust. I may add a bit of gluten next time. It was very sticky, necessitating the addition of flour as I stretched it into the pan. I think just adding more flour (1/4-1/2 cup?) to the recipe would have been more appealing to me than having a floury coating. I used it for "Gourmet Chicken Pizza" and will use it again for that recipe. The recipe as is made a thick crust for a 12" pizza.

A pleasant change to a regular white flour pizza.
