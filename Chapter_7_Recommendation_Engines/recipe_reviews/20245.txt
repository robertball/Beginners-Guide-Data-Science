This is really easy to make and comes out great! I used Splenda instead od real sugar and I couldn't tell the difference!

Well, this was sooooo strong that I felt I was drinking paint remover.  Maybe because I used a store brand raspberry vinegar?  I don't know but it was barely edible and I won't be making this one again.

Way too easy to be so good! Loved the mint, somehow it went so well with our salad. This will be a great summer staple. I did add a Tablespoon of oil because it seemed weird to me not to have some oil in a dressing. Thanks for the recipe, PantryGatherings!
