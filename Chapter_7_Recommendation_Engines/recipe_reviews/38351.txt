I'm a bartender and i have a special recipe for lemon drops, this particular recipe will leave you with a pursed face and no buzz. To make a GREAT lemon drop martini, you need to first fill your mixing tin with 8 oz of ice, you need 2 oz. of (preferrably) citrus vodka, squeeze 2 lemon wedges for natural juice and drop wedges into shaker, add 1/2 oz. of cointreu or another citrus liquer, 1 oz. of lemon juice, and then 2 individual packets or 3 teaspoons of sugar. The trick to getting a PERFECT lemon drop is to shake the tin a lot, you want to mix the sugar up into the liquid, not having it settle at the bottom of the tin. Strain the ice and lemon wedges and enjoy a PERFECT lemon drop. My recipe will deffinitely impress your guests and keep everyone having an awesome time. Good luck...

One of my favorite shots when I go out!  I used about equal parts lemon and vodka and a little more sugar.  The way I made it it was a good sipping cocktail as well.  Obviously a good vodka is key - I prefer belvedere.  Fine baking sugar disolves very quickly in the martinin shaker when you make tis as well.  I like to cut lemon wedges and then coat them in sugar so people can bite into them after they take a drink.  Thanks!

This was really good, but kind of a sticky mess to make.  Well worth it, though.

I'm sorry, but I love Lemon Drop Martini and this was awful!  Way too much lemon juice.  I needed to add alot more sugar and vodka to it to make it drinkable.  After a few sips I ended up adding some peach nectar to it... After that it was awesome!

I used citron vodka, simple syrup instead of sugar (& I added at least a tsp extra) & I also rimmed my martini glass w/ sugar. I think this recipe might be meant for shots (there are two different lemon drops...a martini & a shot). I only got two martini glasses out of the recipe & mine are just the small 5 oz size. I think next time I will try rimming it w/ crushed lemon drop candies.

These are yummy. BUT I found an easier way: Frozen Lemonade Concentrate!  use that instead of mixing water & sugar or even corn syrup!  it's amazingly good!!!

I'm sorry to say that I had to add a whole lot of sugar to this one.  I've had many lemon drop martinis.  Probably more than I should admit to.   This was very sour.  I recently had a really decent one at our local restaurant and they used Snapple Lemonade.  I've made lemon drop martinis before and this one is by far the worst I've tried.  I'm so  sorry.  I hate giving bad reviews but this one was yucky

TIP: An easy way to get the fine sugar instead of buying it is use regular sugar and put it in a blender of your choice it makes fine sugar.

This would actually be a lot better made in a shaker with crushed ice, and then strained into a martini glass.  It should be cold enough to serve without adding ice to the glass.

After I tinkered, this is by far our favorite martini recipe...For 2 servings: 1 lemon , 2 oz vodka,3 oz. simple syrup into a sugar rimmed glass...heavenly! (Tastes dangerously like refreshing lemonade.)

This may be a 'duhh' but I made the mistake when making this drink just now, of using the lemon juice CONCENTRATE that you get in the store. Needless to say it was WAY too sour, but upon discovering this I 'saved' it by doubling the vodka, adding two tsp. more sugar and about 1/4c of some almost flat sprite that my roommate had in the fridge. Turned out wonderful after that. Next time I'll be trying fresh squeezed lemons.

As per other suggestions, I cut the lemon juice down and used a bit more sugar. All I had on hand was raspberry vodka and it turned out great!

Okay, so I'm completely guilty of one of the worst sins of an allrecipes member! I am NOT rating this recipe for its original ingredients. However, I'm giving 5 stars to it with "warrentyvoid's" tips! Why? Because it's flippen tasty! That's why. It is totally a must try for those lemon drop lovers!!!

This is good, but I did have to add extra sugar to it, hence the 4-star rating. I was worried that it would be super tart, but the ice melts as the sugar is incorporated. By the time everything's done the lemon is pretty mellowed, but the drink is stiff! Yum!

I, like others, had to  a LOT more sugar and vodka to make this drinkable.  Once I realized how much more I would need, I decided to stop rather than to waste a bunch of sugar and vodka.  I had high hopes for this recipe, but it really was just entirely too much lemon juice.

This recipe is a good start but waaaaaay too tart for us.  Simple syrup (1 part water, 1 part sugar) made ahead and chilled is a better way to sweeten this drink.  How much you need is entirely up to your taste buds!  1 oz. of Triple Sec (or other citrus liquor) is a nice addition. Also, if you'll take the lemon peels and pummel them in a shaker (or dish), for the release of the oil......it's a nice addition.   Chill your glasses, rub with a lemon slice and twirl the rim in sugar.  This isn't a drink for lazy bartenders, ya' gotta' do some work but it's well worth it!!

I'm not sure what went wrong here, but I followed the recipe exactly and this was SOUR! I mean, really, really, sour. I've had lemon drops before and they were nothing like this. I added an additional two teaspoons of sugar to make it drinkable, and eventually ended up filling the rest of the glass with cranberry juice because it was simply too lemony.

I've never had a lemon drop so I've nothing to compare it to, but my guests and I LOVED this drink! I sugared martini glasses and added a mint leaf. So pretty, so darn good and really potent! Thanks EDandy!

This is the recipe I prefer...being a former bartender. I dont like the citrus flavored vodkas, they tend to have too much of an artificial sweetner taste to them. 
As far as the sugar, taste it. Just like making lemonaide it depends on your tastebuds and level of sweetness you prefer.
Just dont forget to shake it! alot.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Lemon Drop martinis! I always have to add more sugar whenever I make this drink. I usually eyeball everything. You can buy Lemon Drop rimmer at specialty stores and it is a nice compliment to the drink, it's yellow too!

Excellent drink!  However, I used Citron vodka and put fresh lemon around the rim of the martini glass and then dip the rim of the glass in sugar.  YUMMY!  Really makes the lemon drop special!

in most bars, if you were to order this drink, it would be: chilled citron vodka in a shot glass. served with a sugar coated lemon slice.

I wonder if Splenda would work instead of sugar.
