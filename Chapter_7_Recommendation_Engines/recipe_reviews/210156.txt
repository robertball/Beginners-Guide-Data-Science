Absolutely delicious and very quick/easy to make! I used thinly sliced sandwich meat ham instead of proscuitto, and I served it with white rice. Great meal, and it also very good leftovers!

Absolutely fantastic!  I used sliced maple honey ham from the deli (after reading another comment); and used 3 slices of ham and 2 slices of provolone per chicken breast.  I also made my own sauce as I don't like the prepared stuff.  You can make alfredo sauce quite easily - I melted 2 tbsp of butter in a skillet, added 1 tbsp of flour to create a paste, poured in approx. 8oz. of heavy whipping cream, added 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese (fresh or the grated stuff), brought it to a boil and let it simmer for 1 minute.  Add salt (I prefer not to) and pepper to taste.  I also made some asparagus on the side (in a separate skillet with a little butter, garlic powder, and pepper).  FANTASTIC meal!  My husband and both of my young, picky boys absolutely loved it!  Highly recommended.

This recipe was amazing!  Very easy to make but a little messy.  Worth having again despite the mess.

It is a good idea to put the chicken in a plastic bag and pound it down to make the chicken thickness even.  I've made this with salami and have experimented with different cheeses. I also add a whole jalapeno or pepperoncini to the center of the roll and add some grated parmesan to the bread crumb mixture. If you are watching your fat intake: the chicken is usually moist enough for the bread crumbs to stick with out the use of oil. In the last 5 -10 minutes, I spritz the rolls with fat free butter spray to make the coating golden and crusty.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous.  I have been asked for this recipe many times.  If I could rate it higher I would.  I used Italian Panko bread crumbs and that is the only change I made.  Loved it!

My family loved this.  I served it with sun-dried tomato alfredo sauce with fettucine and a salad.  Will definitely be making again!

This was really great!  I used a slice of regular ham and a slice of smoked provolone on each.  Served with yeast rolls & will definitely be making again.  (I did need to bake for about 5 minutes longer because my chicken wasn't all that thin)

I actually got this recipe from a card Kroger sent and have been making it for a couple of years. The other directions say to pound the chicken, which really needs to be done for even cooking. I've made my own sauce and used the jar, all good. I've served with rice and with fettuccine and both are good. You don't need the salt on the chicken since the prosciutto and Alfredo have plenty. This is easy and gourmet enough for a dinner party. I don't bother to slice them, just serve whole. I'm all about easy and delicious and this is it... Hubby loves this one too!

REALLY GREAT Recipe the first time I made it using this recipe, the second time I altered it a bit.  I placed the chicken in a ziploc bag and used a mallet to smash them thinner, I let that marinate over night with a bit of olive oil and italian dressing. I also added a small amount of pesto to each breast when I assembled.  My teenagers are rarely quiet when we have dinner, this was a MAJOR hit and it looked beautiful on the plate!

Hubby loved this dish! I liked it but wish the outside breading was a bit crispier. Will try again,  maybe panko crumbs would be better.

Absolutely delish!!! Made chicken almost as the recipe calls for but I used honey ham and I did make my own alfredo from a recipe on here. My husband said this dish was the BEST I've ever made! I will definitely make this again and again.

This is an amazing recipe! I used the thin sliced chicken breasts to save myself time pounding the chicken and used honey deli ham. To save myself a bit of money and give a bit of a different flavor I purchased an Italian shredded cheese mix to put on the chicken.  The biggest change I made was using a cracker crumb mix to coat the chicken in instead of a bread crumb mixture. I also used a home made Alfredo sauce and the taste was amazing! A recipe I will be making again.
