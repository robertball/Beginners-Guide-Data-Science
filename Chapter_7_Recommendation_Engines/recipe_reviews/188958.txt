I love the idea of this dish, it just needed a little tweaking.  I sauteed some onion and garlic in the olive oil before adding chicken broth (instead of water).  This adds a lot more flavor.  I used whole wheat coucous and spinach instead of parsley for more nutrition.  The end result was great!  I love the texture of couscous and the artichoke, tomatoes, feta and lemon juice are all great flavors together.  I recommend this dish as a healthy and delicious side dish!

I changed the recipe a little. I cooked some fresh garlic and a tiny bit of onions in the oil first and then added chicken broth instead of water. I also forgot the lemon juice and had no feta cheese, so I put some Parmesan cheese in it instead...I know, a lot of changes but it was really good.

As is, didn't pack as much flavor as I liked so I whipped up some balsamic vinaigrette and sliced some black olives.. YUM!  Good cold, warmed up, works great with Chicken and fish as a side.. or just all by itself!

Absolutely delicious! After reading other reviews I first sautéed half an onion, garlic, and sweet peppers in the olive oil. I then added chopped fresh spinach for about 30 seconds before adding the chicken broth I was using in place of water. I cooked pearl couscous in the mixture, then when it was done I mixed in the tomato, artichoke hearts, feta cheese, and lemon juice. Served alongside a falafel veggie patty. Everyone loved it! I will be serving this on a regular basis from now on!

Made a few changes in accordance with some reviewers' suggestions, and in terms of what I had in the pantry. Sauteed onions & garlic together in olive oil with finely chopped green pepper (instead of parsley). Used veggie broth instead of water. Added one chopped roasted red pepper to add more color. When leaving the couscous to soak, I forgot to turn off the burner :( but fortunately caught it when it was just beginning to stick. I added a little water and left it a few minutes - it had come unstuck and was fine! To make this a full meal, I added a well-drained can of tuna. We both enjoyed it for a light, tasty lunch.

Yes! Next time I'm going to have it sitting next to a fat piece of salmon. I added a vegetable bullion cube to the water as it boiled. I did what some others suggested– grilled a little bit of onion and garlic prior. Substituted parsley for spinach (it's what I had). Everything else was the same. thanks! can't wait for the leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.

This was amazing!!! So crazy delicious!!! I took the suggestions of others: I sauteed garlic and onions in the olive oil first and then cooked the couscous in chicken broth instead of water.  Also, I did not have any parsley so I added chopped scallions instead. I have always liked couscous but this took it to a whole other level! Every last bit was gobbled up by my family and they asked if I would make it again tomorrow night!

Substitute the couscous with quinoa just cuz I had it. My 13 year old son who hates tomatoes love it. I do agree that it needs tweeking. grilled onions perhaps. Maybe next time

This is a great recipe!  I make it into a main dish by adding cooked chicken.  I also use sundried tomatoes instead of fresh.

This was really good.  A simple way to make a flavorful couscous side dish.   Off season so I diced a good quality canned tomato.  This is a keeper and a staple item . 

It was a perfect side dish to my lamb kebobs marinated in olive oil, rosemary, thyme, garlic and balsamic vinegar.  I also served  with a medley of grilled red pepper, poblano pepper and leek.

Edit.. Corrected grammar and punctuation .

This was super easy and super tastey.  I forgot the lemon, and added the whole small container of feta.  I put veggie patties on top, served warm and had a dinner in less than 10 min.  Might add more artichokes next time...
