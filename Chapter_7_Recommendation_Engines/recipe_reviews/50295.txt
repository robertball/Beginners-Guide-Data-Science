These muffins turned out beautifully. They were so tasty. What I had on hand dictated my substitutions: regular butter for reduced calorie margarine, 2 real eggs for 1/2 C egg substitute, packaged real bacon bits for meatless breakfast patties, and cheddar for Parmesan. I was a little freer with the cheddar than the amount in the recipe too. These were a tasty companion to this site's "Creamy Corn Soup". Thanks.

I was intrigued by this recipe, especially since no one else had reviewed it. :) The one major alteration I made was using whole wheat flour instead of white. The only other changes were using real chopped onion instead of powder( didn't have any powder) and some extra seasonings. These tasted pretty good. Next time, I am going to add some broccoli and perhaps some lowfat cheese to the mix, instead of parmesan.

This is my favorite muffin recipe, tho I do make some substitutions depending on what I have on hand: whole wheat flour for all-purpose, 2 eggs or 6T mayonnaise for the egg substitute, 1/4 cup of Bac-O's or bacon bits for each patty, and butter for the margarine as I cannot stand the thought of margarine anymore after reading a natural health article that pointed out it is 'one molecule away from plastic'.    It doesn't rise as much with the whole wheat flour, so I also fill the cups higher than I would normally, which usually only gives me 8 muffins.  I also tried greasing the tins with coconut oil this time instead of Pam olive oil spray or Crisco...and they taste better!  One other thing...I have a small, hot oven, but I still needed to go 14 minutes in baking them, probably because of the changes I made.

Wow. These were amazing. Substitutions: Yogurt instead of buttermilk, "Imitation meatloaf" instead of sausage (recipe on this site);  2 tbsp canola oil and some applesauce instead of butter. Also added 1/4 cup finely grated carrot and left out the cheese. I will make this again for sure.

This is a great base recipe.  It has so many options.  It is great for breakfast cause it is filling.  I used cheddar and sliced ham.  Thanks for the recipe!

these were really good! hubby & son approved! :D  

i added flax meal (but forgot to compensate the wet, so they came out a bit drier than i would have liked, but clearly my own and fixable mistake. :P) added some thyme, a little chicken bouillon (in powder), and subbed greek yogurt for the buttermilk. also used real butter and a cupful of parm. :D yum.

Woderful savory muffin.  We are not vegeterians, but this recipe is easily adapted using crumbled sausage, as I did.  This is an easy meal on the go packed with protein and oats.  We served this with scrambled eggs, and they were perfect.

We enjoyed these.   I'm putting them in the "rotation" of savory muffins that we enjoy with soup or by themselves for breakfast.

We loved these!  My husband and I wanted something other than standard breakfast fare, and these were perfect.  The only changes I made were to use plain soy yogurt instead of buttermilk, egg whites instead of egg substitute, and crumbled turkey bacon instead of the meatless patties.  I also left out the cheese.  They baked up nice and fluffy and had just the right amount of seasoning.  Thanks for the great new addition to our breakfast rotation!

Definitely a keeper! I doubled the recipe and substituted a pound of maple blueberry venison sausage in place of the meatless patties. I also used 2 eggs in place of the egg substitute & about 1/2 cup cheddar cheese instead of the parm. I baked them for 8 minutes, sprinkled on montery jack cheese, and baked another 2-3 min. I froze most of them so my dh and ds can take them to work but I'm sure my dd and I will be sneaking a few of them. So Yummy! :)  A+++

Very good recipe. I made some changes based on availability and preferences. I didn't have garlic or onion powder, but used a tablespoon of French onion soup mix (the powder instant kind), I used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk in the same volume, two real eggs, and butter instead of margarine. I also made my own vegetarian sausage first (soy protein, water, egg, wheat flour, sage, time, spices). My boyfriend doesn't like them, but I love them dipped in a little ketchup or with butter.

Our family is not vegetarian, so I made the following substitutions:  butter for margarine, 2 eggs for egg substitute, and real crumbled sausage for meatless patties.  The muffins looked nice, but they just didn't have much flavor at all.  I might add some cheddar next time, and maybe a teaspoon of seasoned salt to the dry ingredients.  They were just way too bland.

Seemed to be very dry and not hold together.  Although they were a tad better the second day.

These were quite tasty, although not a WOW from the boys, which I was hoping for so that I could put them in school lunches. Like other viewers, I used butter and real eggs. I also used 1/4 cup w.w. flour and the rest white. Might play around with it to kick it up a notch....

I changed these to whole wheat muffins, but I left out the seasoning (it didn't sound appetizing for breakfast). I subbed lowfat mexican blend shredded chz instead of the parm and increased the amount of cheese, but I couldn't even taste it. I would leave out the cheese and add in a can of green chilies or something.

I added chopped pears and used fat free cheddar instead of the parmesan and spelt flour instead of regular.  These muffins are awesome.  They are a nice change for breakfast.

These are not good.  Perhaps the sausage substitute I used was less than awesome but YIKES.  I would say to try these in the middle of diet when you are hard up for something filling.  If you make them in the beginning it will just remind you of what you are missing.  Back to the drawing board!

Made some basic substitutions, including using real eggs, butter, and real sausage.  Overall, the texture was good, but the flavor was really bland.  I won't be making this again...

I have been look for recipes like this for a long time. I don't use substitue this or that anymore, but I can tell a good basic plan when I see one. Thanks for taking the  time to share this.
