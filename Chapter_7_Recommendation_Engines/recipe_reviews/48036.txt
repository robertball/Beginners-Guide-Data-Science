Fantastic!  Cream usually comes in pint containers, so you can use 1 C cream with 1/2 C milk instead of the 1.5 C half-and-half.  Use egg yolks instead of whole eggs if you want it slightly richer (although this recipe is almost perfect as is).  Even after hardening in the freezer it was still relatively easy to scoop...The reason is that fats (inc. egg yolks) and sugar don't freeze, so don't back off too much on the sugar (or cream) if you plan on freezing it to serve later.

Wonderful!  First time used 1 cup sugar and found it slightly too sweet.  Made again with 3/4 cup sugar and it was perfect.  Paired it with chewy oatmeal cookies to make outstanding ice cream sandwiches.

A big hit. Very rich (it is custard-based), so we just used a small sorbet scoop to serve some alongside the Thanksgiving apple pie. Everyone loved it, kids and adults. Prepare the base the day or night before to let it cool completely (called "blooming") in the fridge. Then churn the next day in your ice cream maker. The waiting makes for a smoother, creamier and more intensely-flavored finished product.

If I could give this TEN stars, I would. By far, the best homemade ice cream I've ever done. A few things I learned that might help you:
- I doubled the recipe and forgot to take into account that it would take longer than the recipe instructions for the mixtures to heat on the stove. I stirred constantly and waited patiently, and it paid off, but it did take a long time.
- I also failed to consider that, for my ice cream maker at least, the mixture needs to cool before churning. Since it was coming hot off the stove, I had to let it cool on the stove then in the fridge for a while, which added about 45 minutes to my planned cooking time.

I hate taking a long time to cook, but I'm not kidding you, every minute was worth it. It was delicious and received rave reviews from our dinner guests. I served it solo and think to have served it with anything would take away from how good it was!

This ice cream is SO smooth and creamy!! I serve this with the Apple Crisp II. Insead of using vanilla flavoring, I use a Vanilla Bean paste that I got at William Sanoma. This recipe is a great base! I've also made raspberry ice cream! Just don't put in the cinnamon! Very yummy! This is a keeper! Also, I used an electric mixer to beat in the eggs so they wouldn't scramble.

This ice cream is SO rich but SO good. My only suggestion is to let it ripen in the freezer before serving it; it tastes better and takes the edge off the rich sweetness. I served it with apple crisp...yummy!

I love cinnamon ice cream so I was nervous about it not living up to my expectations. I LOVE this recipe and will make it again and again! I cooled the cooked mixture in an ice bath to make sure it would freeze easily. Thanks for sharing it!

Good, great, wonderful!  Forty years ago the best dessert in the world was the hot apple pie with cinnamon ice cream on top served at Kenning's in Columbus, Ohio.  This is so close.  I talked about how great it came out at work.  I had to make more pie and ice cream for them.  They all loved it, and now I am supposed to bring it to the summer picnic.  Thank you very much Elizabeth.

Perfect....creamy, not too sweet, cinnamon is not overpowering....love it.  Served it with fresh strawberries, yum!!!

To make the cinnamon mix evenly I mixed it with the vanilla and 1/4 cup of the custard before I mixed it into the whole batch.  No clumps :)

This is delicious!!  Very creamy and the cinnamon is great.  I doubled the batch and thought I could make it all at once, in my 2qt Kitchenaid ice cream maker (attaches to the stand mixer).  But that overloads the machine.  So if you double it, just be sure to churn it in 2 separate batches.  I got frustrated at first, because it wouldn't freeze right, but as soon as I split it up and tried again, perfection.  So tasty, and I'm glad to finally have an ice cream recipe that doesn't require just yolks.

Excellent!  I love cinnamon ice cream and can't find it now that I moved away from my home town.  It's fun to make home made ice cream, and this is now the only recipe I use to make any flavor of ice cream, just substitute for the cinnamon.

The cinnamon gave this ice cream an interesting afertaste. Not what I was expecting when I eat something sweet. Wasn't really my style but I'm glad I tried it.

This is a 10star! After researching cinnamon ice cream on various sites (epicurious,foodtv network) I decided on this because it didn't involve separating the egg, and it had excellent reviews.  Not one to review usually, I had to do it for this recipe. I followed advice about decreasing the sugar.  I even thought 3/4 cup was sweet; and used whole milk rather than 1/2n1/2. I'm addicted! Using whole milk and the cream was a nice balance: not too rich, just creamy enough to hold the texture; doesn't melt as quickly as ice-milk. Excellent Excellent Over-the-Top!

Like everyone else, I agree that this is a great recipe. I thought it would be intensely cinnamon-flavored, but in hindsight, I may have even added a little more! (I stuck with the 2 tsp, but also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon extract and stuck a cinnamon stick in the mixture while it cooled in the fridge--and it was still subtle.) 

I used fat-free half-and-half, which worked great, and 3/4 c. sugar instead of 1 (I really like things sweet, but even I agree that 1 c. would have been too sweet). 

As people suggested add-ins, I folded in 1 c. oatmeal praline pieces (recipe from David Lebovitz's The Perfect Scoop) and 3/4 c. crushed honey-cinnamon almonds from Whole Foods. The end result was amazing!! 

Hope my suggestions help.

Fabulous!!! I doubled it and it worked fine.  It is super creamy with a great cinnamon flavor. I've served with with apple pie like many suggest, but if you just want a bowl of ice cream it is great with a few chopped pecans and drizzled with a little Hersheys Syrup (Special Dark syrup is extra yummy!!)!! It has actually replaced mint chip as my family's favorite.

I made this for Thanksgiving to go with apple pie. It was sooooooo good! I made one for myself and one to take to a friends house. It was gone very quickly! The first batch was made with cinnamon that had been sitting in my cupboard for a while and it still turned out quite good (I added more than 2 tsp to compensate). I tried it again with new cinnamon and it came out fantastic! I think 2 teaspoons is the correct amount (don't use too little!). Also, it's important to cook this until it's very thick. I let mine cool on the counter then refridgerated overnight. It froze very quickly in my Cuisinart ice cream maker. I will make this every time I make an apple pie. Thank you!!!!

Yummy!  I used egg substitute in place of the eggs, fat free half and half instead of the regular half & half, and finally I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and the result was still very creamy and flavorful.  The true test will be tomorrow when my kids will get to taste it!

I never had cinnamon ice cream before but made it to accompany the apple shortbread pie from this side.  What a match made in heaven.  This ice cream is rich and creamy with an incredibly smooth texture.  I increased the vanilla to 1Tbsp. (I always double my vanilla)...My guests were very happy with my dessert.  Make this one early and often....

Great cinnamon ice cream!  I switched it up a bit because of the amount of milk I had and it was amazing.  I took the ice cream out of the maker and placed it between two toll house cookies I had baked earlier and let cool, then I placed them in the freezer until the ice cream hardened and served with a touch of whipped cream!  AMAZING!!!  this is a keeper and a HUGE hit.

Delicious and very rich.  I put a small scoop atop a carmelized pear and drizzled a small amount of caramel over the top.  What a heavenly treat!!

. The texture came out close to butter even though I put it in my ice cream maker for less time than I ever have before (15-20 minutes when I usually do 25-30 minutes). It thickened incredibly quickly. Replacing the 1/2 and 1/2 with whole milk should make it much better. Also, when I've made cinnamon ice cream before, leaving cinnamon sticks in the custard overnight before putting it in the ice cream maker produces a much truer fuller-bodied cinnamon flavor.

Please do not let this recipe pass you by.  It's SO scrumptious. Creamy and delicious. I have a Cuisinart soft serve ice cream maker. I made this recipe to be fat free and cholesterol free. I used 2 1/2 c. fat free half and half, 3/4 c. sugar (as others suggested), and 1/2 c. Egg Beaters. I did not cook it as the instructions said because for my I.C. maker, the ingredients are to be very cold. I was a bit concerned that the 2 tsp. of cinnamon was going to be a bit much, but it wasn't. It was perfect. I served it with pumpkin pie. Everyone wanted seconds and thirds. I can't wait to make it again. If I could give this 10 stars, I would.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe. This is one I'll be making over and over again.

So amazingly delectable!  More like a gelato than ice cream really.  Great with fresh raspberries or cookies.  I might cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup next time but it's not needed.

All I can think to say about this ice cream is WOW... 5 stars isn't enough. It's hard to believe how few/simple ingredients their are considering how incredible this tastes. I adjusted the recipe by 1.5 (to make 6 cups/12 servings) for my 1.5 quart maker. Took a little longer than I expected to cook and  cool (I let it cool to slightly warm on the counter and then in the fridge until completely cool) but it was worth every single second. I used whole milk instead of half & half because that's what we had but kept everything else the same. It was sooooo thick and creamy and the texture was perfect. Got rave reviews from my family too!

Fabulous!  But the serving sizes seemed small; we upped the recipe to serve 30 to fill the freezer can.

I can't say enough good about this ice cream. Just finished off a bowl and I'm feeling pretty proud. The texture was amazing. It was rich, but in a good way. I tried this without the cinnamon. Instead try adding 1/3 cup cocoa and 1 tsp almond extract or less to taste. Yummy! Thanks!

A BIG hit at our church homemade ice cream social!  Eggs make the mixture custard-like, without much hassle.  I use an electric mixer to keep from "scrambling".  The cinnamon is unique and a treat, but you can omit the cinnamon and the mixture makes a perfect base for any ice cream flavor.

YUM!!!!  This was the best ice cream I have ever put in my mouth!  

After being in my ice cream maker an hour it didn't firm up, but I think that's just my crummy ice cream maker.  I put it in the freezer overnight and WOW!  It's amazing.  Will make again and again.

I skipped the half n half and used 2 parts cream, 1 part milk. I also cut the sugar down to ½ cup and it was perfect. It's cooling right now but already tastes 5 star. Once it's frozen I'll stir in some cinnamon sauted apples. Yum!

Does this recipe call for 2 whole eggs?? I've only ever made ice cream with egg yolks. I made this recipe with 2 whole eggs and it's now cooling. But I had to stain it (I've never had to do that before) because the whites of the eggs did get a little cooked. I'm still going to make this mixture because thankfully, if it doesn't come out right I have time to try again. Please let me know if I should have gone with my gut and used yolks only.

This was my first attempt at ice cream, and it turned out perfect.  I took the advice of others and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cups, and the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  It was perfect.  I agree with one of the other reviewers, that it tastes kind of like snickerdoodles.  I am going to try other flavors with this same base.  Love it!

This ice cram is so easy to make nad so good. even my husband who is not a fan of ice cream loved it.the only thing I might change next time is reduce the sugar a little , it was a little too sweet. Also I don't have an ice cream machine, so what i did was cook on the stove as directed, then poured into the metal bowl of my kitchen aid mixer let cool. then I put it in the freezer and every half our took it out and mixed for 5 min with my KA for 4 hours. well worth effort. can't wait to try other flavors.

I only stirred in crushed ginger snaps during the last few minutes of freezing and added an additional teaspoon of cinnamon. Terrific base recipe that can be altered to whichever flavor you want, by simply omitting the cinnamon.  This was my first custard style ice cream recipe. I'd only suggest that you strain the mixture through a fine sieve to remove any coagulated egg, that's what I did to ensure a smooth product. Thanks for sharing!!!

Very very tasty!  I used a combination of honey and maple syrup i(about 3/4 the amount called for) nstead of refined sugar and it was super yummy.  My only concern was that both times I made this, there were cinnamon clumps in it.  I wonder how to whisk it in better?!

This is the best ice cream base I've found.  It's wonderfully creamy without having that fatty mouth feel like so many other homemade ice creams.  I've made it with cinnamon (delicious), instant coffee (yum), vanilla, and amaretto.  All have been excellent!

This is awesome ice cream. I've made cinnamon ice cream before and it has always tasted good but has had an almost gritty texture to it.  This one doesn't seem to have that problem.  I think it is the use of the whole eggs (rather than just the yolks) and the higher half-and-half to heavy cream ratio than I've used before.  Try this recipe! I promise you'll love it!

This is my favorite ice cream to make at home.  I used 3/4 cup sugar and skim milk instead of heavy cream, but it was still plenty rich and delicious!  I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

I love this ice creme recipe and have paired it with peach pie and cobbler as well as grandma Ople's apple pie from this site.  I have made the recipe as written and in a pinch, I made it with whole milk instead of half and half with good results.  It is a rich ice cream, but it is very, very good!

OK, the first night that I served this ice cream to my family, my son (who inhales anything) took a couple of bites and said, "does anyone want my ice cream".  I thought it was too rich, and my husband asked was it cheesecake flavor, lol.  But, a couple of days later, we decided to give it another try with some apple pie...OMG!!!!  TO DIE FOR!!  Now I know what the fuss was about.  This is an awesome recipe, my only recommendation is to PLEASE eat it with something. Cookies, apple pie, something to complement the taste.  Tonight I made some gingersnap cookies to try with it, and was sad to see that there was hardly any left (after our apple pie session =) )  I have to make another batch soon, because all we do now is dream of the endless things that we could eat this ice cream with.  My hubby keeps saying he's craving apple pie (I know what he really means....lol)

This is a phenomenal recipe. Each year I make ice cream as a part of our family's Christmas dessert, and this recipe is the best one we've ever tried. It's VERY rich and flavorful, and to me it works best as a complement - just a scoop will fill you up. We paired it with my daughter's pumpkin swirl cheesecake, and it was delightful!

This is really good, but a litte too sweet- hence the 4 stars.  I should have followed some reviewers who used 3/4 cup sugar.  It's really good and tasty though, especially for a cinnamon lover.  I should have strained the cooked mixture before refrigerating, because I had tiny bits of egg white in mine.  It was totally my fault- I probably overcooked it a little.  Straining would have taken care of that though- I'll make sure I do that next time (and with any cooked ice cream recipe).

Oh, yum! I LOVE cinnamon ice cream, but I can usually only get it during the holidays.  Now I don't have to wait. This is a great recipe. Very smooth & creamy with a wonderful cinnamon/vanilla taste. I thought it was a bit sweet on it's own, but I served it with the Peach Pie recipe on this site submitted by Marcia Kammann & it was heavenly. Since the ice cream is pretty sweet, it goes really well with a slightly tart pie. I think it might also be good to add some pumpkin pie puree & crushed up vanilla wafers & it would be like Dairy Queen's pumpkin pie blizzard.

I was leary of the amount of cinnamon this recipe called for, but it was perfect.  I served the ice cream over grilled pineapple and it was heavenly.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thank you!

I had never heard of cinnamon ice cream before, so I thought I'd give it a try.  Although it had a wonderful, creamy texture, I didn't find it to be the sort of ice cream you put on a cone and eat by itself (I tried).  I think it would be terrific with some apple pie or with something else mixed in with it (one of the previous reviewers suggested sugar cookie dough, I think).  It's very sweet.

I made this recipe along with 7 other homemade flavors for a large 4th of July party, and it was the favorite with most. We live on the border of Mexico, and many compared it to the taste of "fried ice cream" found in some local Mexican restaurants here. It was definitely good and rich.

My family loves this ice cream. I add 1 to 1 1/2 cups of coarsely chopped homemade oatmeal cookies ( no raisins) when it is done processing. Fabulous! Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

The custard was very good, however i could not get mine to freeze the way i like it. I like hard Hagen Daaz-like ice cream. I left it in the ice cream make for a little over an hour. I also left it in my freezer for a few more hours. It was still very loose.

I changed the base slightly - 2 cups heavy cream and 1 cup whole milk and this was fantastic.  Really rich, creamy, and delicious.  I served it with the pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving.

hard to have a bad ice cream so we ate this, butt tasted so much like eggnog and would not harden up. We have been given the wrong salt at feed store my husband said. Not pure salt. So I would have given this a 2 or 3, but since salt may have been problem gave it a 4. I was hesitant at doing custard type. regular no cook w/out eggs better for us.

I had cinnamon ice cream ONCE, as a splurge during a diet, and no dessert has ever captivated me so.  I looked for it in stores and ice cream shops for months before opening up to the idea that I could MAKE it.  This recipe is perfect.  It is exactly as I remember it... and I'm sure glad it's complicated to make (I don't have an automatic ice cream maker); otherwise I would need to go on another diet.

WOW!!!  Wonderful, creamy, flavorful ice cream.  The cinnamon really comes through in this.  This ice cream is great just plain in a bowl, but is absolutely terrific on a plate of warm apple crisp.  We had not planned on having it on the crisp, but about a week after making the ice cream, we had apple crisp for dessert and my husband found 1 scoop of this ice cream left in the freezer.  We all had a tiny bite, but lucky him.  This was the perfect compliment to the warm crisp.

This was AMAZING! I agree with another reviewer that it does taste just like a snickerdoodle. This did not thicken in the ice cream maker like I am used to with other ice creams, but it did thicken in the freezer after 24 hours. Also, this only made 1 qt. Next time I will double the recipe, as I have a 2 qt ice cream maker.

OMG! This is Crazy Good! My guests were in LOVE at first bite, even the one that doesn't care for cinnamon. The recipe only makes a small amount so if you're feeding a crowd or want some for left overs (I stashed a little for later)you'll want to increase the amounts using the calculator. The leftovers stayed creamy not ice like...

VERY GOOD, but very sweet.  Not a bad thing, but I think I will either half the sugar next time, or use about 3/4 cup of sugar instead of the whole cup.  Ice cream is supposed to be sweet, this is only my personal preference.

Besides that, the texture of the ice cream is to die for - so creamy. This was my first time ever making ice cream and it was amazing. I served it with a fresh apple cake and it was the perfect compliment.

I just made this ice cream and just tasted it too.  The texture is creamy but oh boy is it sickeningly sweet! And  I used full raw sugar (which is usually less sweet on its own) and about 10% less than what the recipe called for.  I am sorry to rain on the recipe, it is actually easy to make which motivates me to make another batch minus about 30 - 40% sugar.    Thanks for an otherwise great recipe!

I will probably never buy ice cream again.  I made it in my ice cream maker and froze the left overs.  I was surprised to see that it froze just like real ice cream and taste just as great.  Can't wait to try different flavors with this recipe.

Really yummy.  I used only 3/4 cup sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon (Penzey's).  The ice cream was very rich with an almost too intense flavor.  Might try just one teaspoon cinnamon next time for a more delicate ice cream. I think it would pair well with another scoop of a different flavor--chocolate, coffee, or peach.

I made this to go with a carrot cake and it was absolutely amazing.  Instead of using 2 whole eggs, I used 3 egg yolks, and I had a cinnamon stick to so I put that in while the custard was over a double broiler.    This was the first time I went through the effort of making custard style ice cream... definitely worth it.

I followed the recipe exactly. My initial "taste during preparation" was really tasty ...... but after it was frozen it had TOO MUCH CINNAMON!!! If I were to make this again I would double everything else except the cinnamon. The original recipe only made a small amount about a pint).

This was my first time making ice cream.  My husband and I love the flavor and how creamy it is.  It's been years since I had cinnamon ice cream - I'd forgotten how tasty it is!  I don't have an ice cream freezer, but found directions on how to proceed without one.  After the cooking portion, I poured the thickened mixture into my metal mixing bowl to cool in the fridge.  Once it was in the freezer, it was super easy to pull it out and slip it into my electric mixer stand to beat as needed.  I can't wait to make another batch!

Very Easy and no Fail. Very creamy. Strong, but not overpowering taste. Some Ice creams with eggs I can taste the egg in the final product. I did not have that problem with this recipe.  Great with  an Apple Crisp or  an Apple Dump Cake

This was yummy, and well received by the family members who gathered for a small Father's Day party. Thanks to the other reviewers, I doubled the batch -- so glad I did! There were seven adults; we served it with cookies and very little was left. A single batch would not have been enough. Definitely on the sweet side -- I used just over 1.5 c of sugar (in the double batch) and it was plenty sweet. Freezes well, stays pretty creamy and scoops nicely the next day.

great!  used 1 cup 1% and the rest cream as that is what I had on hand.  slightly more than 3/4 cup sugar (of which 1/2 cup was splenda) and only 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 vanilla bean.  I wanted vanilla ice cream and this is smooth, creamy and excellent.  cooking the eggs/cream was not as time consuming as I thought it would be, well worth the trouble, thanks!!!

This recipe was fine; the consistency was perfect.  I've made it twice so far, and both times, I've thought that its flavor was fine.  However, it has an after-taste to it, and it's pretty heavy.  Of all the recipes I've used with my ice cream maker, this is the least spectacular.

I have been making homemade ice cream my whole life.  This ice cream is fantastic.  It is rich, creamy, the perfect amount of cinnamon and so refreshingly light at the same time.  I have an ice cream maker that holds 5 quarts.  I doubled this recipe and should have tripled or quadrupled it.  It did not make enough for a crowd even with doubling it.  Shoot.  This will be at the top of my list from now on with increasing the recipe for sure!  I will serve with oatmeal chocolate chip cookies or apple pie/crisp.  THANK YOU!

my first time making ice cream and I chose this recipe. It came out great! I must confess I did change it.... I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, ( I love cinnamon!), and I also thew in some red hot candies.... It turned out fabulous.... thanks for the great recipe....

Tastes wonderfully cinnamonny.  Very refresing during the hot summmer.  I made a double batch, churned it, then popped it in the freezer for a few hours and it froze up great.

We just made this over the 4th of July weekend.  WOW.  The custard was so thick, and the ice cream turned out just like the pros - no ice crystals at all.  I did think it was a little too sweet, but my family loved it.  We tripled the recipe, and then cut it into 2 batches - just right for our 1 1/2 qt freezer.  I will try using this recipe as my base with other ingredients.  Thanks!!

What a great recipe for cinnamon ice cream.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect!  I served it with snickerdoodle cookies and everyone raved!  One thing that the recipe says is to "cool" the mixture.  I put mine in the refrigerator for about 3 hours and it turned out great.

Very good!  I tripled the recipe for my 6 quart ice cream maker.  Then when it's time to put it in the freezer I scoop it into about 15 of those little Gladware containers which makes a perfect single serving of ice cream.  Nice creamy texture and would be great with pie!

Very good recipe, next time I would use about 3/4 of the amount of cinnamon, it had just a little too much kick to it (although I was using fresh ground cinnamon, maybe the pre-packaged kind would make it a little more mellow).

This recipe was extremely easy.  I have never had cinnamon ice cream before and since this had the highest number of reviews with the highest number of 5 stars, I thought I'd try it.  Unfortunately, it was absolutely delicious and I ended up eating the entire small batch in one sitting as soon as it was done.  It was just phenomenal!!!  Reminds me of sticky toffee pudding by Haagen Daaz.  I will definitely make this again, and again, and again!

This recipe is fantastic!  I paired it up with hot Apple Crisp and everyone loved it!  It didn't set up right, but I think that's because I didn't cool it all the way before I put it in the ice cream maker--I think I would cool it overnight before putting it in the ice cream maker.

Heavenly!  We make this to go with our yearly apple picking & pie making (highly recommend Granny Ople's pie filling with the earthquake crust from this site!) and it is divine.  Definitely a rare treat due to the calories but we look forward to it every fall.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! The flavors balance out very well. The instructions for tempering the eggs were easy to follow, and the resulting ice cream was smooth and creamy. Unlike other ice cream recipes I've used, this one was more easily scoopable even after hardening off in my freezer overnight. Nice on its own, or with carrot cake, apple pie, apple crumble/cobbler, etc.

OUTSTANDING! I doubled this recipe because I have a large family.  It was a hit with young and old alike.  Creamy and great cinnamon flavor.  I doubled vanilla - but that was the only thing I did differently.  I will definitely make this one again!

Very rich, creamy, and and delicious. I only used 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon because I was adding crushed Skor bars, and I added a little more half-and-half. Served with Pecan Sour Cream Pound Cake, from this website.

I had never tried cinnamon ice cream before making this recipe.  I can't even believe how creamy and delectable it turned out- way better than expected.  I served it with my own apple crisp recipe.  A rich taste though, so you definitely need to eat it in small amounts or to complement another dessert.  Now a part of my ice cream favorites collection!!

This was my first attempt at homemade ice cream, and it was very easy.  I made it for my family's Fourth of July barbeque, and it got rave reviews from everyone...even those who don't care for ice cream.  I served it over warm, grilled peaches.  Yummy!  I will definitely make this ice cream again.

Good.  Made a mistake the first try and threw out the first batch (forgot to cook the combined mixture) but I thought it was too sweet, too.  I reduced the sugar to half a cup on the 2nd attempt..and it turned out fine.  Very smooth.

I'm always so skeptical about ice cream recipes. I mean come on people, who wants to waste expensive ingredients and time? No one. But this cinnamon ice cream recipe was amazing and even my picky little brother loved it! The consistency us creamy and exactly like store bought ice cream. 
However some suggestions could be to just do a little less cinnamon. My family did say there was a bit too much, but at the end my little bro still loved it. I tossed some pecans at the end of the process... I think I prefer spiced or sweetened pecans a bit more. Otherwise I think this recipe is very safe to use, and delicious! Carry on and make some ice cream ??

You don't need an Ice cream maker to make this! My ice cream maker broke down 30min into the stirring/freezing process.  All I did was put it into the freezer, and stirred it manually every 30-45mins till it was thick. Making it took longer than I thought to get the cream boiling, but worth it...definitely go slow when adding the boiled cream into the eggs (you don't want to make scrabbled eggs).  I added 1/4 tsp of pumpkin spice and 1 3/4tsp of the cinnamon, but my husband can't taste it so next time I'll add 1/2tsp. of the spice, and keep adding till we can taste it (and subtract out the cinnamon accordingly).  This is a very creamy ice cream, similar to Gelato.  I also wish it wasn't so expensive, the 4cups of ice cream costs more than buying a gallon, but of course, the 4cups homemade tastes better.

I have not tried the recipe however; I was looking for a recipe that was similar to Ray's Cinnamon Ice cream. So excited you posted this. I will be making it for sure. Thanks. :)

I just had to try this recipe, for a few different reasons. 1-When I buy vanilla ice cream, I mixed cinnamon into it. 2-I love all things cinnamon. And 3-It had great reviews. I only changed one thing, the same thing I do with my cinnamon rolls, I did 50/50 white sugar and brown sugar. The taste is phenomenal! It's a warm flavor like all of the cinnamon pastries and desserts. This would be great with apple pie! Highly recommend this recipe and will definitely be making it again soon!

Loved this!! Save yourself the heating step and grab some pasteurized eggs. That way no scrambled eggs. I always make ice cream with the whole egg as well not just the yolks. So easy- throw it in an ice cream maker and your good. This ice cream is awesome on top of pumpkin pie.
Nice recipe- thanks for sharing.

Great taste!  I was disappointed in the quantity.  I recommend doubling the recipe.  This was only the 2nd ice cream recipe I made with my new Kitchen Aid ice cream bowl attachment for my mixer, which incidentally works GREAT!  (I got the attachment for $50 at kohls.com)!  I should have realized I was not using as much cream,etc. as I did in my first endeavor.  Next time I'll know to double!

Very nice texture and flavour.  I did change it a bit: I used soy cream instead of dairy, added some instant coffee and a couple of shakes of cayenne to go with some Mexican chocolate cupcakes.  Delicious!

Wow!!  I made this for my husband using my ice cream maker attachement for the kitchenaid mixer.  It was so good!  It was extremely creamy, more like a frozen custard.  I served it over a home made apple pie, and the ensemble was to die for.  We couldn't eat all of it, so I froze the rest in a large tupperware.  Unlike other home made ice cream recipes I've tried that get freezerburned or lose their texture after a day in the freezer, this one got even better!!  Yum!  This recipe is a keeper for sure.

It came out nicely and was easy to make. My family likes it, but personally I don't care for how rich it tastes. I think it'd go great with apple pie or something similar, but on its own I thought it was too much cinnamon. To fix this I added a chocolate swirl to it before freezing. I will definitely make this again closer to the holidays.

I loved how creamy and thick it was.  My son and I like the cinnamon flavor, but it wasn't a hit with others in my family.  I have taken the recipe and not put in the cinnamon and used it for vanilla ice cream and with that added 2 Dove chocolate bars when I took it off the stove for chocolate ice cream.  So good! Uses less cream too, which is more expensive than half and half.

Nice work! This one is a winner! I made this as recommended in the recipe except I ground up fresh cinnimon sitcks and used 3 teaspoons instead of 2. The result was an outstanding ice cream that my family loves! Thanks and keep them coming.

This is a fantastic recipe, so good a la mode with any warm apple dessert.  Things to consider for next time I make it (definitely a repeat!): I would take out about 1/4 cup of sugar but I think all ice cream recipes tend to be on the sweet side and I used fat free half and half because it was all I had and you can't tell still soooo creamy!  Love this recipe, it's a great way for ice cream to be a fall dessert.

This is my third attempt at making homemade ice cream and my husband has declared this batch as "dangerous"....we quickly polished it off. We are not huge fans of ground cinnamon and I was worried about the typical thickness of cinnamon. The cooking process nicely blends the cinnamon, leaving a smooth and subtle flavor. As I do not have an ice cream maker, I made it by hand.

So good!  I didn't even use an ice cream maker.  I just found instructions on the internet of how to make ice cream without a machine, which there is more than one method out there.  The only thing I changed was I used only 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and that is just because of taste preference.  My husband does not like a lot of cinnamon.  It turned out creamy and yummy!

I like a little bit  of ice crystal texture in my ice cream, not this heavy, creamy, too smooth texture. This helps me to eliminate ice cream recipes similar to this one. Thanks anyway.

This was very good.  As others have mentioned, this custard base would be great for a lot of different flavors.  Why not 5 stars?  I simply am not a big fan of the cinnamon flavor in Ice Cream, nothing more.  The recipe itself is very good though, no modifications needed.

A beautiful recipe! Another reviewer called it a Snickerdoodle made into ice cream . . . indeed!    So here's what I had to change.  I didn't have half and half, so I used whole milk.  Also, I used 3/4 cup of Spenda rather than sugar.  Couldn't help but think that if there was a difference, lord knows I couldn't tell.  Oh, and I used Veitnamese cinnamon (sp?) . . . it has a bolder flavor profile, and really holds up well in this recipe.  Thank you!

It was definitely creamy and rich but I was hoping for something lighter and WAY to sweet for my taste. Had to add milk and still too sweet. I would cut the sugar to 3/4cups and use just whole milk with heavy cream (instead of half-n-half) next time.

I made two batches of this.  The first batch was the standard recipe.  The second batch, I used 3 egg yolks (eliminated the whites) and used apple pie spice in place of cinnamon (I'd used all the cinnamon I had in the first batch!).  I also folded in some chopped pecans.  This stuff was really amazing!  It goes super well with Grandma Ople's apple pie from this site - the pie doesn't have cinnamon, and the ice cream compliments the pie PERFECTLY!

This is awesome! The only thing I did different was added a vanilla bean to the sugar and half and half during the cooking process....otherwise this was a huge hit at Thanksgiving!

I served this over Barefoot Contessa's pear, apple and cranberry crisp for a dinner party on Friday, and it was outstanding! One of my guests was a local (Baltimore) celebrity chef, and he said - stressing his sincerity - that this was the best ice cream he had eaten in 20 years. I'm floating on clouds having received that high a compliment from him!  I altered the recipe slightly simply because I had to use what I had on hand.  Instead of 1-1/2 cups half-and-half, I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup skim milk.  Absolutely delicious, and a perfect complement to so many winter desserts.

This was really good.  I'd read some other cinnamon ice cream recipes, and made one change.  When heating the milk and sugar on the stove I included a 3-4 inch cinnamon stick.  I left this in all through the cooking and cooling/refrigeration period, taking it out just before putting the mixture into the machine.  I think it added a slight warmth to the after taste.  Delicious!
11/21/2018 - Delicious, but a bit overly sweet. Next time use 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup. I combined all ingredients and a cinnamon stick in the pot and heated, whisking constantly (except ground cinnamon and vanilla). This way the eggs heated gradually and we needed no straining. Made a double recipe which close to 2 quarts (in my 4 quart machine).

My ice cream freezer makes a quart and a half, so I made one and half times the recipe.  The first time I made it, it seemed a bit too sweet to me, so I cut the sugar by a quarter cup and it was perfect!  I also found that adding the ground cinnamon with the sugar at the beginning of the process results in a more even distribution of the cinnamon.

This is a delicious ice cream. As DPINKUS suggested, I used a pint of heavy cream and 1/2 C. of milk (skim) since that is what I had on hand. I did not alter the amount of cinnamon from what was in the original recipe. I let the mixture chill in my fridge overnight. I used my Kitchen Aid ice cream maker attachment to make the ice cream. The texture is great. It is very soft for scooping and I will be making this one again, for sure.

Awesome! I let this "cool" in the fridge over night before putting the custard mixture in the ice cream maker. The ice cream is super smooth and super creamy. Also - instead of using cream I used whole milk.

This makes a deliciously smooth and creamy ice cream!  The recipe calls for 2 and 1/2 cups of mixed cream products.  Instead of 1 1/2 cup of half and half I used 2 cups.  For the heavy cream, I substituted a half cup of 1% milk to bring the total amount of liquid to the required 2 and 1/2 cups.  I saved a few calories and fat grams and still ended up with the creamiest home made ice cream ever.  I love cinnamon, but felt that 1 teaspoon was plenty.  This is so rich that a little really does go a long way.  Think I'll try it tomorrow over some fresh sliced peaches.

Since getting my ice cream maker, I've made many a flavor. This is among the top three I've made. So far, it seems to have a diverse following, from as young as three years old, to adults as well.

I have been wanting an ice cream maker for years and finally found a good deal recently I couldn't pass up.  I have tried a couple different ice cream recipes but have been disappointed.  They have turned out with ice crystals and were not very creamy.  Not this recipe.  This recipe was smooth, creamy, and the consistency was just what I was looking for.  Yes, it is very rich as other reviewers have mentioned, but yummy nonetheless.  I think the heavy cream and half and half mixture is what makes it so smooth and creamy.  The other recipes I have used called for regular milk.  When making this, be extra careful pouring the warm mixture into the eggs.  Even though I poured the mixture slowly and was beating til the cows came home, I noticed very small bits of cooked eggs in mine - not  so much though because hubby didn’t notice.  So be extra careful with that step.  Just wish it would have made more because it sure didn’t last long! Now I am trying to figure out how to make this into different flavors of ice cream! Thanks for the delicious recipe.

I really wish I would've doubled this recipe b/c it was that good! My husband is a huge fan of the cinnamon ice cream at Maggie Moo's so I decided to make this at home with my ice cream maker attachment for my Kitchen Aid. I decreased the sugar to slightly less than a cup and used two egg yolks instead of the whole eggs. I mixed in crushed Butterfinger pieces. So yummy!

This was a really smooth and creamy ice cream.  The cinnamon flavor was a little too strong for my family, but that is easily adjusted according to taste.  This makes a very small amount, which is great if you're preparing it for one or two people.  If you're making it for four or more, be sure to double the recipe so that everyone can come back for another bowl!  I agree that this would be fabulous with warm apple pie, apple cobbler, or apple crisp.  I'll omit the cinnamon and use this recipe as a base in the future.

This is a fabulous ice cream recipe. I made is the first time using 1/2 milk and 1/2 cream, and was amazed at how smooth and creamy it was. I figured i'd found the perfect custard base for ice cream, so this time made the custard base, then flavoured it with melted chocolate, instead of the cinnamon.   I can see a whole new world of ice cream opening up now i have this perfect ice cream base!  thankyou!!

Only had 3/4 C of heavy cream left and no half & half, so I used 3% milk for the balance of the liquid. Obviously, wasn't reading the recipe too closely and cooked the cinnamon & vanilla with the milk and cream. And it still came out amazing!  Good recipe. Thanks!

Anything inspired by Ray's ice cream of Royal Oak, Michigan is bound to be delicious.  I even had Ray's at my wedding in lieu of a cake!

Very delicious, but a little sweet, next time I`ll reduce sugar. I used only heavy cream.

Very good and Very rich! I also added some chopped baked apples after it came out of the ice cream freezer. Next time I will add oatmeal or sugar cookie crumbles or just have the baked apples on the side with the cookies.

This was phenomenal!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and cut back on the sugar (used somewhere between 3/4 of a cup and one cup).  I also let the custard cool in the fridge overnight with a few cinnamon sticks thrown in.  I fished out the sticks the next morning (before using the ice cream maker).  DELICIOUS.  It was excellent by itself, but I served it over warm gingerbread.  Swoon!  

One negative: it doesn't make a whole lot of ice cream.
Another positive: it doesn't make a whole lot of ice cream.

If I'd had any leftovers after my guests departed tonight, I probably would have eaten them all in one sitting.  Still - next time I'll double the recipe.  I think there will be plenty of room in my 2-quart maker.

I will definitely be making this again.

This is my favorite ice cream recipe.  It is so good.  Whenever I tell people about it they are a little skeptical, but then they try it and are hooked.  In fact it is such a good recipe, that I now use it as my vanilla base recipe (omitting the cinnamon) to turn into other flavors.  It's really good in the fall with apple pie.

Very good rich ice cream.  Easy as well.  I reduced the sugar a bit since I was planning on serving with a peach/blueberry cobbler.  It got rave reviews but it is so rich that I won't be making it that often as a little goes a looong way!

Awesome, is the only word to describe this ice cream! So rich, creamy and decadent! I wasn't sure about cinnamon flavored ice cream, but it was incredible. I doubled it for my 4 qt ice cream maker and it still could have held more and believe me, you and everyone else who tastes it, will want more!

Absolutely perfect.  I think I did mess up somewhere though.  After reading all the other reviews I noticed people saying it was too sweet.....well mine wasn't sweet enough.  To make it a little sweeter; after we scooped it into our bowls we added a couple spoonfuls of cool whip....that really made it taste fantastic.  Thank you so much for a "keeper" recipe.

I USE THIS RECIPE NOW FOR MY BASE RECIPE TO MAKE SO MANY DIFFERENT FLAVORS.  I ADDED PEANUT BUTTER AND REESES PEANUT BUTTER CUPS IN ONE RECIPE.  I HAVE MADE BUTTERFINGER AND TOFFEE.  THE BANANA AND STRAWBERRY IS REALLY GOOD.  YOU JUST CAN'T HARDLY GO WRONG WITH THIS RECEIPE.  I DOUBLE THE RECEIPT AND THEN ADD EXTRA HALF AND HALF & CREAM WHEN I POUR IT INTO THE FREEZER CONTAINER.  I FREEZE THE ICE CREAM FIRST AND THEN DIVIDE IT INTO TWO PARTS AND ADD WHATEVER CANDY ETC TO ONE BATH AND LEAVE THE OTHER AS PLAIN VANILLA. THIS IS FANTASTIC ICE-CREAM. SO CREAMY RICH AND EASY. IT ALSO FREEZES GREAT.  MY WHOLE FAMILY LOVES IT!!

I chose this as the first recipe in my new tiny little ice cream maker. Very easy instructions, kept in fridge overnight, churned it the next night. then placed in freezer container. excellent. i just passed it out at work and everyone called me Martha Stewart! I will definitely make this again. and luckily i still have some in my freezer at home since everyone at worked gobbled up what i brought :))

Oh my goodness. This ice cream was fantastic. Rich and creamy. I made ice cream sandwiches with it. Mine came out a little more of a caramel color than the picture here shows, but it was perfect inbetween snickerdoodles.  I took them to a potluck, and everyone loved them.

Wow!  This ice cream is phenomenal!  I first made it for Thanksgiving to have with apple pie.  I was a little worried because I just received a little Krups Ice Cream maker for my birthday and had never "tempered" eggs before, but the instructions for this recipe are very easy to follow, even for a novice like me.

I love all things cinnamon, so the only thing I changed in the recipe was that I added a bunch more cinnamon to it.  I just made it for the second time today and added some chopped Hershey's cinnamon chips in it.  The more cinnamon, the better!  But this ice cream was a big hit for Thanksgiving and is so rich and creamy.  Definitely five stars!

I made a couple changes - I used egg substitute and used cinnamon extract, this way I didn't have to cook it first.  Blended it in a blender, chilled then poured in my ice cream maker - turned out great.  It's really hard to find cinnamon ice cream in the stores here so it's nice to be able to make it myself.

This ice cream tastes good but was not what I was looking for.  Some ice cream parlors around San Diego have cinnamon ice cream which I was trying to make but his recipe was WAY too creamy for my liking.  The flavor was great but texture was too thick and creamy.  I will not make again.

This ice cream is extremely rich!  We didn't find the taste too cinnamony, but we did think it was a bit too sweet.  However, paired with a tart apple dessert, It's going to taste divine.
With all that being siad, I would absolutely make this again.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but I really liked the flavor. I wouldn't change the recipe a bit, but I do what to experiment with add-ins. Sugar cookies, perhaps.

Was skeptical about using whole eggs but worked out great.  Ice cream was very creamy and loved by all.

I love this recipe.  It makes delicious cinnamon ice cream that I serve with apple pie but is also good on its own. I use the recipe without cinnamon as a base for other ice cream flavors. Like many others, I reduce the sugar to about 3/4 or 2/3 cup depending on what else I am adding to the ice cream.

It was just a bit too sweet for my taste. Next time I make it, I'll reduce the amount of sugar. Otherwise it was delicious. Can't wait to try it on warm apple pie.

I used light brown sugar for half of the sugar, two egg yolks (no whites) and chilled the batter for about 5 hours before putting it through the machine. At the end of the churning I added hot water 1/3 plumped raisins. This batter was fantastic after it spent the night in the freezer!

Nice creamy ice cream.  Followed directions as written.  No changes necessary, excellent just the way it is.  I did cool overnight in the refrigerator as one reviewer did which was convenient.  Served with maple apple crisp on this site and it was just awesome.  Definitely a keeper.

This was really easy and tastes great! I used more half and half instead of the heavy cream. It was a little sweet so I'd cut back the sugar next time.

I made this to go along with apple pie. I chose to use Ceylon cinnamon, which is a better grade, over the normal Cassia cinnamon. I made it exactly as posted.  This was incredible. If you have a problem with graininess, try using the Ceylon, which is less grainy and also slightly milder and sweeter. This will be a favorite, but I'll have to increase the quantity from now on.

I scaled back a little on the sugar as one reviewer suggested. This ice cream reminded me of red-hots candy. Just a bit too much cinnamon. Other than that, it was great.

My husband and I loved this ice cream. Perfect with the apple turnovers I made for 4th of July. I added an extra egg yolk. I also ran the mixture through a strainer before I put it into the ice cream machine. It made for a smoother ice cream and helped cure my less-than-perfect anglais. Will make this again for sure!

Wow! I used fat free half n half and an extra tsp of vanilla. Delicious! Tip: dissolve the cinnamon in the vanilla and a couple of tblsps of the heavy cream before adding it to the mixture. It won't clump that way.

This makes a very creamy ice-cream.  Next time I will replace the half-and-half with milk.

Wow what a great recipe.  Full of cinnamon flavour.  I did strain the mixture with my fine mesh strainer into the bowl that I had set into the fridge.  Chilled for several hours before using my ice cream maker.  Note for KA Ice Cream Makers please remember to follow the instructions for making ice cream.  Especially the chilli part for the mixture

Easily the best homemade ice cream I've ever had. Very smooth. There was no grainy texture whatsoever. This amazed me, because our ice cream maker broke down, so I had to straight freeze this in the freezer with no mixing. I was afraid it would be hard as a rock in the morning, but it wasn't. It was easily spooned into bowls and the texture of any store bought ice cream. Next time I will quadruple the recipe. I used a heavy hand with the vanilla, and for vanilla I used my mom's homemade pure vanilla, which is key. The 1 cup of sugar was slightly too much for my taste, and I will reduce it to 1/2-3/4 cup next time. I confess that I gave the kids one bite and told them that's all they could have.

I have been making this recipe for memorial day for a few years now.  And this year I will do it again.  I am already getting calls to make sure I will be making it.  It is great!!  I make a dutch oven spice cake with apples and serve this with it.

I had never tried cinnamon ice cream before this recipe and I was pleasantly surprised. This is very creamy and goes well with several desserts. My favorite way to use this ice cream is to make ice cream sandwiches with iced oatmeal cookies and this cinnamon ice cream in the middle.

Awesome! Have made twice. I make a double batch. I use a little more than half the recommended sugar. I sub in milk for about one-quarter of the half and half. Just trying to make it slightly healthier. Plenty sweet and very delicious. I'm serving with apple pie for Thanksgiving...but first, I'm going to steal a little bit and mix it with my homemade cinnamon applesauce as another reviewer reco'd. Sounds awesome!

Yum, yum, fabulous! So nice to find a recipe that uses whole eggs instead of just yolks. To make it healthier, instead of 1 cup sugar I used two tablespoons raw sugar, two tablespoons honey, 1 cup heavy cream and 1 1/2 cups whole milk. The ice cream still turns out wonderfully creamy and sweet. Great base for many kinds of ice cream!

I used  3/4 agave nectar instead of  1 cup of sugar by far the softest ice cream I've made so far Ill use this recipe again. Cant wait to try different flavors. I like that it uses the whole egg. The other recipe i used called for 8 egg yolks left allot of whites to use up.
                                                                           Thanks

There are really no words to describe just how amazing this ice cream is.  I made it in a 4 qt machine so I tripled the recipe.  That worked well, it just takes a looooong time to cook.  It was very sweet. If you wanted to cut back the sugar a bit, it would still taste fantastic.  This was great on its own and served over warm apple pie.  Definitely making this again!

This ice cream is delicious!  It was the first recipe I tried with my new KitchenAid ice cream attachment.  It is very rich and creamy.  I may decrease the sugar next time to 3/4 cup.  A couple of adjustments I made to the recipe:  I used 3 egg yolks instead of 2 whole eggs, and I increased the half and half and the heavy cream by about 1/4 cup each.  This would be delicious with apple pie or apple crisp or pumpkin pie.  Wonderful by itself.  A real winner!  I will definitely be making this again.

This is excellent cinnamon ice cream. I can't wait to try it with an Apple "something or other" this fall.  Today i used it to make Mexican Ice Cream pie.  A definate 5 stars and it works perfectly in my cuisanart ice cream freezer.

This recipe was the best cinnamon ice cream that I have ever eaten!  I put it in my white mountain ice cream maker and it came out perfect!  I doubled the recipe and my friends and family ate all of it in a matter of minutes.  I will be adding this recipe to our list of family favorites.

Oh my gosh!  Incredibly smooth and OH so delicious!  My boyfriend wanted rhubarb pie for his birthday and LOVES cinnamon ice cream.  I stumbled across this recipe and thought I would give it a shot with my NEW and FIRST ice cream maker.  Followed directions to the T (except for a little "extra" vanilla spilled in the mix while Kevin was assisting haha)  When I let Kevin try the finished product this morning, his comment was... "OMG... you have created a masterpiece!"  Based on that, I say BON APETITE!

To say I have a sweet tooth, is a dramatic understatement.  That said...this was WAY too sweet!  And I found the flavor to be pretty one note!  I recently got some fancy cinnamon and vanilla, and thought this would be a great place to showcase the fancy spices.  Even with fancy Roasted Saigon Cinnamon and Mexican Vanilla, this recipe lacked depth of flavor.  I think it needs one more ingredient for flavor but I can't put my finger on it.  Maybe salt, ginger...?  Also, while cooling, the custard formed a skin (like pudding.)  I didn't realize the paddles in my machine wouldn't work this out, so I got small lumps in my ice cream.  I don't think I would make this again...

This is good..... but not great. It is much more a custard than an ice cream because of the eggs. Reminds me of the frozen custards I grew up with in the midwest, altho not as creamy.

This ice cream is fantastic! Used half sugar and half splenda. Also used egg beaters. My kids love it. Going out to get waffle cones now.

Excellent recipe. I only used the egg yolks, added a few drops of cinnamon oil, and once I took it off of the stove I beat it until it was cool rather than putting it in the fridge, but other than that I stuck to the recipe. It was ridiculously creamy!!

This is amazing.  I didn't think I would like it that much because cinnamon ice cream didn't sound appealing.  But I trusted the great reviews and now I'm convinced.  I served this over peach cobbler and tonight I'll be serving it over strawberry rhubarb pie.

This was my first attempt at making ice cream, and it was a huge success! Like most reviews, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was still quite sweet. Instead of heavy cream I used 1 cup of canned evaporated milk along with 1 1/2 cups half and half (all the dairy I used was fat free). I also added a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper to give the cinnamon a little kick, and I also refrigerated the mixture overnight like several other reviews suggested. My final product was deliciously creamy, sweet, and flavorful! I will absolutely be making this again!

Excellent recipe! I followed it exactly as written and it turned out wonderfully!  I enjoy that it doesn't take that many eggs (Not that I'm health conscious, but eggs are pricey!) and that the ingredients are easy to come buy, most I already had on hand.  I whole heartedly recommend this recipe.  Give it a try, you won't be sorry!

By far the best ice cream for texture and flavor.  Very easy to make as well, thanks!
The flavor actually reminds me of an irish potato

The cinnamon flavor of this ice cream was delicious.  I served it with apple turnovers and everyone loved it.   The only drawback for me is that this is a very rich dessert and I usually prefer something much lighter.  A little bit goes a long way.

I wish I had taken the other reviewers advice and reduced the sugar. The ice cream is quite good, but just slightly too sweet. If I make it again I would only use 3/4 cup of sugar.

This ice cream rocks! I didn't change a single thing, but I did mix it up and chill it overnight like another reviewer suggested. It was perfectly creamy, thick and cinnamon-y! Even my picky husband approved. This one is definitely going into my permanent recipe file.

Fantastic! I used all milk instead of half & half and cream, just because that's what we had, and it's plenty rich for me. I'll definitely make this again.

I did change half and half to 1 cup milk plus added 1 cinnamon stick to the pot while it heated. This makes one box and has a fabulous taste. Highly recommend this for those who love cinnamon.

I have a Gallon (when froze) Ice cream freezer. I doubled the recipe (followed to full cup of sugar). Put when I added it for the freezer container it fell short of the line, So beening as I'm the kind on person that waters down Kool-aid. I was worried about the sweetness. I went ahead and add about 3 more cups of Half-n-Half to the mix to bring it up to the line. Kept it in the frig over night. PERFECT!!!!! No wonder why it is at the top! I will make it often. thanks Elizebeth great recipe!!!!!!

This was incredible. I don't think it could possibly be any creamier. I quadrupled the recipe for my 4 quart ice cream maker. Decadent, rich (don't tell anyone it's just cream and eggs!) and simply amazing. I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 for one recipe. Thanks Elizabeth!

I loved this, but the man and kids found the cinnamon flavor too strong.  We served with fresh peaches, and the combo was great-- the fruit helped to tone down the cinnamon.  This is a great old fashioned flavor of ice cream.  I will make it again, but will use one tsp of cinnamon instead of two.  The texture was very good and creamy. Thanks!

The amount of cream was perfect to create the "creamy" consistency of high end ice creams but I found the cinnamon to be overpowering - just too much. Maybe use half as much?

Oh my gosh! This ice cream is so good! Very rich and creamy, wonderful cinnamon taste. My only regret is I only made half the recipe. This just keeps calling me back for more! I followed the recipe exactly with no changes. Very delicious...thanks for sharing!

I didn't care for it at all. I love rich and creamy and really sweet - but this was way overload. Couldn't even eat a second spoonful. My kids liked it, but I made a double batch and threw the extra away. The cinnamon (and I LOVE cinnamon) was way to strong also. And I actually measured everything this time. Won't make this again!

Always a crowd pleaser. For a home made ice cream it's amazing.  Leave it in the fridge for 2 months and it is still very easy to scoop.

There's not much more I can add to what has already been said in terms of how DELICIOUSLY AMAZING this ice cream is. We are on a huge homemade ice cream kick this summer, and this has so far been our favorite. I made a few minor changes, just to cut down on the sugar AND the fat. Instead of using 1 cup of sugar, I cut it to 1/2 cup and find it's still PLENTY sweet. Instead of using the 1-1/2 cups of half-and-half, I used either one can of coconut milk or part milk and part half-and-half to substitute. When I calls for whipping cream, I avoid this altogether and instead use half-and-half or milk. I also add a dash of almond syrup or amaretto. So delicious!

My husband and I tried out this recipe without the ice cream machine and we made it the old fashion way.  It was DIVINE!  I found it to be too rich and too sweet; he thought it was just fine.  We were going to share with other family members, but before we had a chance to share Hubby-o-mine inhaled it!  He said that it was just as good if not better than the Cinnamon Ice Cream from Marble Slab.  I, personally, thought it was better than most cinnamon ice cream I've had.  If you have doubts, try this recipe as it will make you forget you ever had any doubts!!!

OMG!!! This is the best ice cream ever! I did  use Vietnamese Cinnamom which I had on hand and wow I think it made a big difference rather than regular cinnamon. It is very rich and creamy. Didn't change a thing in the recipe. It is my #1 ice cream recipe from now on.

Out of all the ice creams I have made so far, this is the best.  This beats cookie dough ice cream and even plain vanilla. I can not wait to try this with apple pie or crisp.  Excellent.  This deserves more than 5 stars.

I was very happy with how this ice cream turned out.  The best way to describe the flavor of this ice cream is drinking the leftover milk after you have a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  The ice cream was gone in a matter of minutes.  YUMMY!

Wonderful ice cream.  I make lots of ice cream and this one was delicious and very creamy. The only thing i did different was to cut back on the cinnamon a bit, 1 1/2 tsp instead of 2. I couldnt stop eating it as i was put it into a container to put in the freezer. I also hd fresh oatmeal cookies, and oh my were they good together. Cant wait to eat more.

This was my first attempt at making ice cream and I think it was a success.  I decided to make cinnamon ice cream to go with Mexican Chocolate Cupcakes that I made the night before.  The combination was really good.

Creamy, smooth and delicious. I would disagree with other posters who said the cinnamon flavour was too strong though. It was perfectly spiced, but I did find it too sweet and while I will make it again, I will half the sugar. I like a creamier than sweet ice cream though, and my guests didn't think it as sweet as I did. All in all a great creamy dessert. I served it over warm gluten-free espresso chocolate cake (found here) and every plate was licked clean!

I loved the creamy texture of this ice cream. I made just like the original recipe and I thought it was great. My husband thought the cinnamon flavour was a bit too much though.

This is simply blissful. The only way to improve it is to use Saigon cinnamon (I buy mine at Costco - Kirkland brand).  I decreased the sugar to just over 3/4 cup, because I served with fresh Oatmeal Raisin cookies and didn't want the components to overpower one another.  Hubby groaned with delight throughout dessert - I'd say it's a keeper!  Thank you for sharing!

followed recipe exactly.  very easy to make!  very tasty and different from my traditional vanilla homemade ice cream.  i like cinnamon, but not as much as this recipe called for.  next time i will try a tsp. less and see how that turns out.  and it makes you very thirsty so have a glass of water handy.  this ice cream would be great with apple pie!  thanks for the recipe.  didnt give it 5 stars cos for me personally, it wasnt the "best", but still very good.

This was my first time making ice cream from scratch, and I must say that I was terrified of the process.  I did manage to mess it up; I followed the directions completely, meaning that I only *cooled* the mixture, rather than chilling it completely, so the ice cream took forever to "freeze" and it ended up being more soft serve-ish than I think it was supposed to be.  So make sure you chill your mixture completely!  Mine firmed up nicely in the freezer, however, and the flavor is awesome; I grated fresh nutmeg to put on top and it was wonderful just by itself.  Definitely making again, only next time I'll do better. :)

The taste was great, but the only issue I have with the end product was that it was almost TOO rich.  I had a couple bites and was done.  It was a little heavy.  I'd recommend substituting the half and half with 2% milk for a lighter texture.

I followed the recipe exactly and my husband said it was the best ice cream he'd ever eaten. I got an ice cream maker in May and we've tried many, many recipes over the summer. This is still my favorite! I can't wait til the fall so I can make it with all those yummy apple desserts.

Delicious.  Perfect amount of Cinnamon flavor.  The ice cream is not very dark, so you might want to add food coloring if you are used to commercial ice creams.

A wonderful ice cream recipe!  After having Cinnamon Gelato in Italy, I was craving a really good cinnamon flavor at home.  This is a perfect creamy blend of flavor and richness.  Easy to make, fantastic to eat!

This is so very good! We took our ice, icecream freezer, and ingredients to the Cheyenne River on a 100 degree 4th of July and managed to make this. It was the biggest treat ever. I did add 2 cups of whole milk to the recipe and ut the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. This is a keeper, the best ice cream recipe I have ever found.

Made this for my son (years old) who was missing our local gelato shop since our move.  His favorite was the cinnamon.  Given - this isn't gelato, but it's lovely.  I've also served it with apple pie.  Our family gives it 5 stars!

WOW!  This was the first ice cream I made aside from the plain vanilla recipe that came with my ice cream maker.  And it turned out great!  I made this for my family at Thanksgiving and everyone raved!  It will become the thing I bring each year, I am sure of it.  The only thing I did different is that I used whole milk instead of half and half, simply because I forgot to buy it.  I am sure it would be good the original way also.

I wish I could give it more stars!  Made and served it with "Easy Apple Crisp" for a BBQ we had and it was such a huge hit!!!  This is a must try.

I had never made ice cream before, and I was surprised at how easy it was. This ice cream tasted so much better than store bought, it was amazing. My friend thought there was too much cinnamon, but I thought it was perfect. I will suggest this recipe to everyone I know. Thanks for the recipe!!

Luscious!  We loved the flavor and texture of this ice cream. It was a perfect accompaniment to Apple Pie by Grandma Ople from this site.

I tried this recipe today and was WOWED ! It was easy and truely great! The only thing I did diferently than the recipe is in the final heating after adding the heavy whipping cream I tossed in 2 cinamon sticks and then continued to heat the mixture till it coated the back of a metal spoon . Talk about decidant ! I also added a drop more of vanilla extract. Now I can always find cinnamon ice cream ! :)

Tasted great.  I reduced the sugar a little bit and served it over the Apple Oatmeal Crisp posted elsewhere on this site.  The consistency was pretty soft for the first few hours in the freezer after mixing, but I may have done something wrong since I haven't made ice cream before.  Since I wanted it to melt over the warm dessert anyway it didn't really matter.  I'm definitely going to try it again!

This is a wonderful recipe!  The flavor & texture are very good.  I could see this accompanying most any fruit pie but it is also good on its own!  My picky husband thought it was very cinnamony, so if you aren't crazy about cinnamon, you might want cut back on it.  Thank you for this fantastic recipe!!!

Wow!  This ice cream is fantastic.  So creamy and cinnamony.  We sandwiched it between oatmeal cranberry cookies and it is absolutely sinful.

This is very good and smooth.  Although I do still have to work at whisking better before the eggs cook.  I guess I'll have to keep practicing.

Very good flavor and creamy texture, but extremely rich.  Be sure to cool mixture thoroughly before putting in the ice cream
freezer.

I made this for my little boy's birthday because he loves Haagen-Daz cinnamon ice cream and they don't sell it in our area.  The taste was delicious although very rich.  The consistency however is not great unless you freeze the ice cream for several hours after it comes out of the ice cream freezer.  Also, I had to triple the recipe to make a full freezer of ice cream with my ice cream maker.  I'll definitely make this again with these factors in mind.

This recipe is delicious.  Very thick and creamy after it "set up" in the freezer.  I served this with homemade chocolate sauce and it was a big hit.
