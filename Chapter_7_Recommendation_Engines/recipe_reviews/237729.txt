I left out the butter and added a tsp of sugar per cup of coffee.  I liked the light coconut taste, and the thin layer of foam. If you use a blender, you should use one with a lid that screws on, or wait until the coffee is cooler.  The steam will force the lid off otherwise.

I "get" this recipe.  You are starting out your day with healthy fats for your brain.  We have been using ghee in our coffee but this is awesome blended with coconut oil. You don't need sugar and cream, this is delicious as is!

I was very skeptical until I tried it and wow, it was exactly like a latte.

Like others have stated this coffee is great and hard to imagine that adding coconut oil and butter create something so good. Until I made it myself and drank a cup I too was skeptical. The coconut oil and butter add just enough sweetness, lighten the color, and create a delicate foamy topping. If you try really hard to taste coconut oil or butter you can detect a slight hint but only because you know it's in there. Coconut oils vary in flavor with some having a very prominent coconut flavor and others none, I used a coconut oil with a prominent coconut flavor and my coffee still tasted like coffee. Better to go "lighter" on the measurements of coconut oil and butter than to go "heavy" so best to measure and not eye the amounts. I would make this again in a heartbeat! THANKS for sharing such a unique and delicious way to drink coffee.

OH.MY.GOODNESS! This was devine! I made it using my Cuisinart Smart Stick, instead of a blender! Just like a latte! I also added a sprinkle of Stevia.

I loved this! The foam was great and the flavor, rich! Please note: Any one expecting a sweet St*rbucks drink will be seriously disappointed. So sip with an open mind ;o) With that said, if you want to sweeten it I suggest you do so before combining with other ingredients. Blend it, add the butter & oil and blend as directed. I added cinnamon after the fact and it did not blend at all. I loved it just the same, though. Enjoy!

I have been drinking this with only a tsp of organic virgin coconut oil and about 1.5 tsp from-grass-fed-cows butter. Love it. The hardest part was giving up the morning sugar! (I hated the taste of stevia in this.) I add some cinnamon powder before blending. During the hot summer months, I even add ice and protein powder for a super creamy coffee smoothie.

I loved the flavor and creaminess of this recipe! I only used a tablespoon of cold pressed coconut oil in Sumatran coffee and found it added sufficient richness and sweetness. Thanks for the idea!

Don't think I'll ever make this again.  Really should give this 2 1/2 stars.  Maybe my coffee wasn't strong enough because it just tasted like oily coconut.

I reduced Butter to one tablespoon and added 1 tablespoon of honey. Coconut oil is very good fat to start the day and it gives and excellent taste with butter. If you want it sweeter add more honey maybe 2 tablespoons instead of 1.

I tried this recipe because I read somewhere that adding coconut oil to coffee would result in an energy filled day. I'm not sure if this is true and I'm not sure if I will make this again. It tasted ok, nothing spectacular.  I placed the unsalted butter and the coconut oil into a mug and then placed the mug in my Ninja Coffee Bar. I selected 'Classic Brew', 'Cup' size. Once the coffee brewed I added 2 packets of Splenda and used an immersion blender to froth it up.

I was leery of trying this because I don't like coconut. And the idea of a beverage with butter? But try it I did! What a treat! I only used a small amount of butter, maybe half of a teaspoon, and it was salted. It was what I had on hand. The coffee I used was cold so no issues when I blended it. I also added about a teaspoon of sugar. I'll be using this more often than my usual coffee with creamer. Ta-ta, International Delight!

Just tried it!  Yum!  If you do not absolutely LOVE coconut oil, then decrease the amount or don't try.  It is a very obvious scent and taste.  I did add 2 teaspoons of sugar to mine as well.  The coconut flavor becomes more prevalent as it cools.  Strong coffee flavor base to start.

I am attempting to go dairy free so I made this with ghee.  I was excited to try it because of all of the rave reviews but also  skeptical because I don't really like the flavor of ghee.   I made the recipe with measurements as written.  My first reaction, was wow, this is awesome!  Second reaction, is wow, this is so rich...I don't think I can drink the whole cup of coffee.  So, I think this recipe will work for me as a half and half replacement if I cut back on the oil and ghee.  Will try again tomorrow with half the ingredients and maybe a little vanilla.

This was very good! I mixed it all in my manual cappuccino maker and it came out nice and frothy. I used virgin coconut oil so there was a nice coconut flavour and the butter gave it a creamier edge. I used salted butter because it's all I had but think unsalted would definitely be better. I did end up adding some sugar though. I will definitely drink this again. Thank you Gruntled Gourmet for the recipe!

As written, I did not care for this recipe...it was drinkable after I added 2 teaspoons of sugar to it.  I am someone who likes strong black coffee with no sweetener, but when I tasted this recipe, it really hit my taste buds wrong - hence, the added sugar.  I guess I like my plain coffee unsweetened but expect my "lattes" to be a little sweet :)  Even with the added sugar, however, I don't think I'll be making this coffee again - which is too bad, I had high hopes for it!

This was great.  I used 1 tbs coconut oil and 2 tsp butter.  Still gave me the froth without the calories and good oil and butter.  I didn't add sugar as I don't use sugar but it you like sugar in your coffee feel free to add it.

What a treat!  Like other reviewers mentioned, this is not sweet at all, so add sugar if you need to after making your black cup of coffee in the beginning (I am fine with unsweetened coffee so I didn't). Beautiful foam on top just like a latte.  Great recipe!

Holy . Used fresh ground vanilla hazelnut coffee from Costco, margarine, and coconut oil. Used slightly less margarine because I wasn't convinced I needed that much butter first thing in the morning, and it turned out beautifully. I will definitely be serving this as a dessert beverage for fancy dinners, the frothy foam is so decadent! Who needs an espresso machine with a steam wand when you have a blender?!

I have been looking for a way to get healthy fats into my diet and this fit the bill perfectly.    I loved the coffee, texture and the frothy top.    Of course the health benefits are an absolute plus.  I plan on making this a morning "treat" often.    Thanks for the recipe.

Ya yuck I must not have used the good coconut oil because mine tasted like a mouth full of oil. I used espresso with my try so I know the coffee was strong enough. I was disappointed because I heard of all the benefits of coconut oil and thought this would be a good recipe to try to add some into my daily routine. :(

Whollee Kow ! This is good. I have drank a few barrell fulls of black coffee over the last 60-65 years and never cared for any of the fru-fru stuff others would get me to try. HOWEVER, I stumbled across this looking for something else and got me so curious I had to try it. Used my Bullet thing my daughter got me and got a very pleasurable  surprise. I like it with really stout espresso type coffee.

As so many others have said in this thread, I have also amended this recipe.  I sweeten it up a bit with either honey or blue agave, flavor it with cinnamon or almond extract. Thinking about other flavors to change it up some.

It is different but good. I think next time I'm going to try without butter and little bit of sugar. Even with unsalted butter I had to add sugar cuz I'm not liking the taste.

I will try and make this again without the butter. I only used half of the butter recommended and that is all I can taste. I had to add a half tsp of sugar  just to kill some of the butter taste.

I've been making my coffee like this ever since I first heard of Bullet Proof Coffee. I love the health benefits of the coconut oil, plus I like that I really don't need cream in my coffee when I make it this way. I don't understand why, but I don't. I do need a little stevia, though, since I like my coffee sweetened just a little. If I make it in the blender there is more foam on top as opposed to making it with my immersion blender. This has the mouth feel of a latte.

I only made one cup so I halved it and I also didn't add the butter but a little cream instead as that's how I prefer my coffee. I thought it was SO creamy and yummy!! I'll be making this daily!!

Normally, I drink my first couple cups of coffee black—if it's good coffee. I add cream if it's later in the day. I thought I'd try this, since I was curious about the whole "bulletproof coffee" thing.  And I thought I could use an extra kick in the pants once Daylight Saving time started. Apparently, I'm not highly attuned to my physiology, because I didn't notice a difference between caffeine buzzes. It tasted pretty good while it was still really hot, but I didn’t care for it once it started to cool down.

I just made it and it is wonderful.  I can't wait for my husband to get home for lunch so I can make him one. We both love coconut.  It's funny I've never bought coconut oil before and my daughter was telling me recently that she used it all the time. So, l was placing an order on Amazon Pantry and bought it. This is the first time I've used it. So I'm glad I had it on hand. I used splenda,  a little vanilla and probably about a half teaspoon of butter and it's wonderful. Those were the only changes I made.  I used a magic bullet to blend it and it was great !

This is delicious and doesn't need sugar or cream. I did add a dab of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. It was perfect.

I made this with unsalted grass-fed ghee instead of butter, but it still just ended up tasting like oily coconut, and there was no taste of coffee at all. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, a little sugar, and some cloves, and they helped, but it still wasn't great. Maybe the ghee was the problem, but if I were to make this again, (and I probably will) I'll use WAY less ghee/butter and half the coconut, and probably blend the spices in with it off the bat.

It was just oily coffee. I tried to enjoy it but it wasn't as creamy as I would like and it tasted bitter no matter how sweet I tried to make it. Good concept, though! I would be willing to try something similar.

I was skeptical, but decided to try it since others liked it so much. Made it just as the recipe directs. Disgusting. Perhaps I'll try without the butter sometime. Way too oily and buttery tasting. Will not do this again.

I should have blended it like instructed, added a little sugar, and added an extra table spoon of coconut oil. I also did one teaspoon of butter as opposed to two tablespoons.

My wife put ice, brown sugar, and cinnamon in it which helped. Her's was better.

My friends in Micronesia, and those that returned would like this.

I did not care for this recipe. The butter is too much. It feels like I'm drinking a stick of butter, which is unappealing to me.
