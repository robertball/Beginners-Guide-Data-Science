Very easy! I use the fresh dough from the grocer's deli. You can add whatever pizza toppings you want. I make it all the time when I am tired after work.

I love this recipe! It was gone in a heart beat. I did make some miner modifications and will change somethings next go around. So here we go: I added pepperoni, peppers and the cheeses suggested and omitted the paramesan. I Jelly rolled it and cooked as said, but the center of the Roll didn't get cooked all the way. So I would add 5-10 min to cook time. I did let it set too, but still I'd more time. I also use Ragu with garlic and it was FANTASTIC! I will be making this again.

These are very good, and quick! We like to add other pizza toppings, sliced pepperoni, thinly sliced ham, sliced mushrooms or green pepper.

Loved it.  Made it exactly like you said and my kids loved it.  I used the same style of roll/cook the next day for a party but used pesto, provolone and shredded, grilled chicken in it.  It was amazing.  Will sample other ingredients and make this way over and over for many events.

My family LOVED this! I loved that it was so easy! The only change I made was leaving the sauce out of it, because any stromboli we've had from a restaurant leaves the sauce to dip, not in the roll. Plus it's great that you can put anything your family likes in the stromboli. Will make this many more times!!

I used contadina pizza squeeze that my neighbor gave me when she moved. I served it with black olives. We had it for lunch and really liked it. I think it would be even better with pepperoni and olives in it. I will make it again. Good easy lunch for the family. I think next time I will try making my own sauce instead of store bought.

I modified this recipe. I don't like buying pre-made sauces, so I made my own, and added a lot of thinly-sliced vegetables. It was good and cheesy!

Awesome! You can't screw this up, it's very easy and versatile. I just used my best judgment with the sauce, added pepperoni, onions and mushrooms. I didn't have provolone, so I skipped it. Turned out great. Sliced up and dipped in sauce. Will make again soon.

Very Simple! Didn't use any meat but used half an onion and some diced green pepper. It turned out really tasty and was so easy.

It is a bit cheesy, next time I will use a low fat mozerella, cut down on the cheese and add veggies, or small pieces of chicken.  You can make this recipe like a pizza:  any toppings you want.

It was super easy and fast to make. I made mine without the sauce because traditionally in my family we never used sauce except for dipping.

Yummy! I just made these tonight and they were delish! I added sauteed sliced green peppers, onions, garlic and spinach to ours and it was so good. Definitely a great recipe for those nights when you're tired and not looking to spend too much time in the kitchen.
