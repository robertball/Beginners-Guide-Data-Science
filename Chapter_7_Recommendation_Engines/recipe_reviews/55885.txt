This is a pretty basic pilaf recipe, and it's fine. 

However, I think it's really important to stress in the recipe that you have to rinse the quinoa really well before you cook it!!!  Otherwise it tastes terrible.

Sorry JBUCK123 - 3 stars for you - 5 stars for me.  I changed this so much it isn't the same recipe - BUT I'll give you credit because I used your recipe as the basis for mine. I started by rinsing the Quinoa a couple of times and then soaking it while I fried 1/2 onion with garlic in olive oil and when it was brown added about 1/4 cup of white wine (allowing for the alcohol to burn off), then added carrots, chicken broth and the quinoa. Before serving I added the walnuts. NO bitter taste. This is the first time making and eating Quinoa - thanks for getting me started and achieving 5* results.

This is a tasty, basic pilaf, open to many variations.  I'm always on the lookout for new ways to cook quinoa because it is so super good for you and this is a nice, straightforward way to prepare it.

I echo the sentiment of the reviewer who said to follow the directions and **RINSE** quinoa before cooking.  It has a natural coating that is very bitter and must be rinsed off.  It takes one minute, but means the difference between yummy and inedible.

I really liked this pilaf. I'm not a vegetarian, so I used chicken broth in place of the vegetable broth and added some salt, since my broth was homemade and hadn't had salt added.

I think quinoa itself is a flavor that takes getting used to, but I really enjoyed this dish.

This was my first time cooking quinoa and i loved it.  i didn't have any walnuts, so i added a touch of black walnut extract, but it was still really good.  my 2 year old gobbled it right up.  i will definately be looking for more quinoa recipes to try.

I liked this simple side dish.  I didn't have any walnuts so I toasted pine nuts, the dish turned out very tasty.  I also used chicken broth.  I will definitely make it again.

Surprisingly good!  I tasted this prior to adding the parsley and walnuts and thought it was kind of bland.  The finished product is very tasty though.  Simple and easy recipe, would definitely make again.

Delish! My husband and I thought it was great.  I didn't put walnuts or parsley on it.  My kids tried it but weren't loving it.  But I'll try again and hope they'll develop a taste for it.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also added some garlic when I sauteed the onion.

Yum!  This is our first time eating/cooking quinoa.  Following the advice from another reviewer, I cooked onions with garlic before adding 1/4 c of burbon- sorry we drank the wine :).  Then I added carrots, celery (diced) and the quinoa and cooked them for 1 minute before adding chicken broth.  I omitted the walnuts and added a pat of real butter for creaminess before serving.  Thanks for giving me a great base for such a healthy and satisfying side dish.

I followed the recipe aside from the following: I toasted the walnuts before adding and waited until the very end to add the fresh chopped parsley, important to use fresh for this recipe. I also added 1/4 C of golden rasins while I was boiling the quinoa. Gave it a nice sweet and savory flavor. finally, we added a little grated parmesean. It was really good!

Excellent Quinoa Pilaf!  I've made quinoa several times and could never get a good flavor out of it until now!  If other users think they aren't getting enough flavor, do what I did and add minced garlic at the beginning and use a vegetable broth CONCENTRATE!

Very good! I kept the recipe pretty much intact - I added some spinach and toasted the walnuts which gave it the most delicious nutty flavor! YUM! I'm looking forward to eating this all week for lunch!

A good basic guide that can adapt to numerous possibilities. This was my first time trying quinoa (finally) and I followed the tips of others making sure to rinse the quinoa well.  Then I added 1 clove garlic minced with onion, used chicken stock and a tablespoon of tomato pur√©e (paste), omitted carrots (just personal taste), then finished with the nuts, parsley and some crumbled blue cheese. Yum!  As I was eating it, I kept thinking of other things to incorporate...fresh greens maybe or peppers or olives. Thanks for posting!

My first time making quinoa and we really liked it.  I didn't use the walnuts and I used dried parsley because that's what I had.  Very good basic recipe.  Even picky kids liked it.  Definitely rinse the quinoa well and add whatever veggies you like.

Very easy and tasty. I added peas and spinach and we loved it as a side dish. I love a recipe that I have all the ingredients on hand. I may add a tomato product and use it to stuff peppers or mushrooms as a main course for vagetarian.

This dish was just okay. I rinsed the quinoa and followed the recipe as printed, but it turned out bland. I seasoned it with salt and pepper before serving, but I couldn't seem to bring out a good flavor. I won't be making this again.

This just wasn't tasty at all. We had to add a TON of salt and pepper to make it edible. Maybe we just need to get used to the taste of quinoa, but I don't anticipate making this recipe again.

Except for adding fresh garlic at the start and rinsing the quinoa, I made the pilaf exactly as written.  It was delicious, and my quinoa-hating husband loved it.  I think you could add any vegetables that you like.  Thank you for the recipe.

I tweaked it by adding minced garlic at the beginning with the chopped onions & used low sodium "better than bullion chicken" for the broth! YUMMY!

This dish is awesome!  I served it with baked zucchini and tomatoes with shredded Asiago cheese.  My husband and I each had two plates full!  Will definitely make this dish regularly.

We loved it, although I must admit we used millet in place of the quinoa (dh likes it better).  Didn't add the walnuts (dh doesn't like nuts in his savory foods).  Overall, WONDERFUL flavor!  Definitely a keeper.

This was ok, not great. Mine came out mushy and I even reduced the amount of broth.

I added some yellow squash and red bell pepper, also substituted pecan for the walnut.  Very well received by my six kids and hubby!

This was very good.  I followed the recipe.  I soaked and rinsed the quinoa.  Thanks to reviews for the reminder.

Didn't use the nuts or parsley, and I used chicken broth instead of vegetable.  We really liked it!  Was my first time with eating quinoa and thought it was good!

I make this recipe fairly regularly and keep it on hand in the fridge.  It is good hot or cold.  I change up the broth.  I have used chicken and the new Tail infused broth as well.  Both are delicious.

Halved the recipe, but stayed heavy on the walnuts, toasted them before adding.  I rinsed the quinoa and sauteed it briefly with the carrots and garlic before adding the broth.  No onions in the house, so used some dried chopped onion just before all the liquid absorbed.  Quinoa can be pretty bland, but came out great with the extra walnuts.  Will definitely make again.

I think this was a great start for me I added corn,garlic,and little bit of sweet potatos. First I used coconut oil to toast up the garlic and onion. then I added the one cut up carrot about a handful of finly chopped sweet potato and frozen corn. I let that cook for about 5 min then added the quinoa and then the broth. I put this into a cooked acorn squash that I cooked with butter and maple syrup. Very Very good if I may add....

Mixed reviews at our house tonight... Admittedly it's the first time any of us have had quinoa, let alone cooked it, but we tried 2 different quinoa recipes tonight - this and one for pudding from this site.

Followed several reviewer's suggestions to add minced garlic at the beginning, and I used chicken stock instead of vegetable, but other than that followed the recipe. Even with the garlic and salt & pepper to taste, it was pretty bland. Topped it with some grated asiago which added a nice flavor.

Hubs liked it, as did our 15 y/o boy (which is an accomplishment is because he's SUPER picky!), but our younger kids thought it was gross. I didn't love it, didn't hate it, but I'm willing to try quinoa again in again in another recipe.

I followed it exactly and it was really good.  I had to use cheese cloth to rinse it.  Anyone have a better idea?  But will def do again and use as a base for some creative recipes...

Pretty good.  Use only one carrot.  It took over the flavor of the grain.  I loved it.  Partner thought it just "okay".

A basic, but very tasty recipe.  It will be easy to modify in the future to compliment whatever the main dish will be, or to use whatever fresh vegetables are in season.

Totally awesome. I used chicken broth instead and cilantro instead of parsley. Amazing as a side dish with Burgers. Try some hot sauce on it. lol.  It's awesome with that nutty flavor.

We loved it! We did add one large clove of garlic as others suggested and used"Better than Bouillon" vegetable base for the vegetable broth. We also used the While Foods "Super Grains" blend of red and white quinoa, millet and buckwheat. Thank you for a great recipe!
