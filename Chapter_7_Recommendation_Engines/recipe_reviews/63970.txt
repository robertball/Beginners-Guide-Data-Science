I tried this recipe several times.  The taste is great, but it never thickened. I would love for someone to post a fix to this.  Could using real lemons botch the recipe?

This is a fantastic pie.  I call it a lemon ice box pie.  It is not a lemon meringue pie!  My mother made this pie for me all through my childhood, and now I make it for my family.  I always double the recipe and make it in a long glass pan.  Oh, by the way I use a box of vanilla wafers for the crust and crumble the wafers as a filler for crust.  Additionally, I use fresh lemon juice.  I just love this pie.

With freshly squeezed lemon juice this rates 5 stars. I can't imagine whey the recipe doesn't call for fresh juice instead of that awful bottled stuff that is so bitter and harsh. Lemons are available year round and are really not that hard to squeeze.

I have used this recipe since I first began cooking. It is great and works as well for a key lime pie by changing the lemons to limes. I am wondering why the reviewer who said that this is not a lemon meringue pie thinks that. Lemon pie with meringe on top. Sounds like one to me.

Tried making this recipe for my dad.  He loves lemon pie, but thought I would try something new this year since my mom alwys makes it out of the lemon pudding.  I wanted to impress him, well I was the one that came out impressed, the recipe with the consensed milk never thicken.  I used everything the recipe called for except decided to use real lemon juice instead of the concentrate but didn't work.  Now my dad is not having lemon pie this Thanksgiving, can't see how people say its one of the best.  :-(

This is a classic recipe, but not tart enough for my family's taste!  Try using a 9" crust, 4 to 5 eggs, and increase the lemon juice amount to YOUR tartness quotient, adding lemon extract, along with lemon zest to the custard!(taste as you go!) Then sweeten the meringue a bit more, and once cooled to room temperature, pop into the freezer to transform it into a summer-time triumph. If you're not fond of sweet & sour desserts, ignore my advice, but it's  definitely worth your efforts to come up with your own variation on this classic recipe!

This is a pretty good lemon pie, but the layers were too thin.  They would probably be OK in a small, prepared graham shell but not for my pie pan.  I recommend doubling both the filling & meringue for a higher pie.

My daughter wanted a lemon pie for her birthday, so this is the recipe I chose. She loved it and so did we. So easy to make and taste great. I used lemon extract instead of the zest and Keebler shortbread pie crust. She was very Happy with it!

ANSWERS to the problems some have had with this pie.  If you want your pie to be firm and each piece stand alone, you must bake it to set the raw egg yokes.  Bake the crumb crust for 5-8 minutes and cool. Then fill with lemon filling and bake 10 to 20 minutes.  When you lightly touch the pie, it won't feel like a sticky goo.  Cool for 2-3 hours then cover with whipped meringue and brown in oven.  Cool again and serve.  Or skip meringue and cover cooled pie with mixture of sour cream, confectioners sugar, and vanilla.

Worked for me! Easy. Set up just fine after chilling overnight in the fridge. Will probably be my go-to lemon pie recipe :-)

My mother made this pie in the 50's, it's got to be one of the easiest and best recipes out there. I read a couple of reviews that were bad, ladies you are doing something wrong, using the wrong milk or something, this sets up wonderfully and is so delicious. I've been making them for 40 years now. I had never put lemon zest in my pies but the one that's cooling in the fridge right now has some lemon zest in it, can't wait to try it. Use a wire whip to mix your egg yolks and juice. If it didn't work for you, try it again, it's fabulous.

It isn't fool-proof by any means, but 9 times out of 10, this comes out great, so it gets 4 stars out of 5. This is my Dad's favorite pie, so I grew up on it.

This has been a favorite in my family for over 50 yrs.  I have added my own personal touch also.  For the ones that have remarked about the pie being too thin....make sure that you mix BY HAND ONLY!!!!  You may use a wisk, but a wooden spoon will serve the purpose well. Remember you only are BLENDING the ingredients.  For a more TART pie. I squeeze the lemons for fresh lemon juice. I roll the lemons on the cabinet to soften them so they will be juicer (hopefully), then squeeze them for the juice and pulp to measure 1/2 cup of juice.  MERINGUE: Make as normal, but I also add DRY POWDER...COUNTRY TIME LEMONADE , when I add cream of tarter and sugar, (as stated in receipe) Ummmmmmmmmmm Good!!!!!

The best lemon meringue.  Beat the filling longer than you would ever think you have to so it doesn't ooze out of the pie.

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  It was too tart, it was flat, and 2 egg whites barely made enough meringue to cover the pie.  I will definitely not make this again.

This is my daughter's as well as my brother's favorite pie.  I have to make several every year or there will be a mutiny.  My husband is upset because every time I make it, he goes off of his diet.  It's the only lemon meringue pie recipe I will ever use.

To assure the filling is set, in our family, we cook the filling in a saucepan or better yet, a double boiler to someplace short of the set point before baking. And I always double this recipe for a nine inch pan. More is better.

Have loved this recipe for decades, and do indeed agree that one should use only freshly squeezed lemon juice and zest.  I recall that this was in the recipe in "days of yore".
