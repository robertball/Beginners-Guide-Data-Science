One quick suggestion...mix together the butter and mayonaise - makes it easier to spread on the pork chops.

I think this is the tastiest pork chop recipe I have ever had.  I try to avoid butter and so instead I sprayed olive oil on the pork chops.  They were delicious, thank you. My husband's favorite pork chop recipe now!

My fiancee loved this!! I was skeptical about the cheese on the top but I made it for dinner the other night with some homemade mashed potatoes and he is still raving about it! Definitely a keeper!

I thought this was a great, easy way to change up pork chops.  I didn't have mayo, so I used lite ranch dressing instead and it was good!  Thanks!

I believe my husbands exact words were "wow babe you can make this whenever you want...next time make more though" :)

Suffice it to say he enjoyed it and we will be making it again!

I made this with left over pork loin from last nights dinner. I sliced the loin, added the ingredients and put it in the oven for 15 minutes till the cheese melted.
I just had it for lunch and it was great !
Will make again. So simple and easy and great for my Atkins diet !
Yummo !

These pork chops are amazingly good! My chops were thick so I left off the cheese and covered them with foil, baking for 30 minutes. I uncovered them, topped them with cheese and baked them for an additional 15 minutes. They were so tender and so flavorful.

Recipe was delicious.  I used Penzey pork chop seasoning on both sides, and then covered it in the mayo/butter mixture.  Then I covered it in shredded mozzerella, parm and a sprinkle of goat cheese.  It was wonderful!  This will go in the rotation for sure.

I can never fix pork chops right without them tasting "dried out" and this recipe made them so moist, they were amazing! In fact, my husband said, "these are amazing"! I am excited I have found such an awesome recipe!

WOW! This is so good!  I only tweaked it a little bit with what I had on hand. Instead of mayonnaise, I used Miracle Whip, which gave it a little extra zip! Also, I used bone-in pork chops and I cooked them a little longer than 35 min.  And, instead of sharp cheddar, I had mild, so I used it.  It turned out great!  It's amazing how such a simple recipe can turn out amazing results!  Will surely be making this one many times again!! :)

WOW!  I was looking for something different to do with some pork chops.  Picked this because I had all the stuff.  Really wasn't sure about it....AWESOME.  FYI...I used Can't Believe It's Not Butter, light mayo and 2% sharp cheddar cheese.  Really, really good.  New favorite!

I made this recipe for my aunt and sister for Mother's Day.  We all liked it, but I did change it slightly after reading a lot of the reviews.  I mixed the herbs, butter and mayo together before putting it on the chops, but I also put some additional herbs directly onto the chops before adding the mixture to lock in the flavor (some of the reviews had mentioned that the chops came out bland because the herbs ran off of the chops due to the butter and mayo).  Also, I put the cheese on during the last 15 minutes of cooking to avoid burning it.  This came out moist and very flavorful.

For someone like me who is just beginning to figure out how to cook (did I mention I just last week learned the proper way to brown meat? lol!) this recipe was, as it's title suggests, very simple! I used italian cheese instead of cheddar, and the chops came out wonderful! (I'm sure the cheddar would have tasted great too, but italian cheese was all I had on hand)

These were excellent. My spousal unit loved them too. Seemed almost too simple to taste like much, but they were so tasty and juicy.  I only had one problem with the baking time.  I bought boneless chops at out Costco on Maui and they cut all meats here into very large & thick pieces. Consequently, it took more like an hour to cook to 170. Delicious just the same. Next time I will slice a chop into two chops. Thanks for sharing.

Eh, it wasn't anything to write home about, but it was edible. I used miracle whip (we never have mayo on hand), three 3" thick boneless pork chops, and had to finish it in the microwave, because it was taking so long to cook (well over 45 minutes), and hubby had to get back to work. It was rather oily from the mayo/butter I presume, along with the cheddar cheese. If someone wants to try this recipe, I would make the following suggestions to make it more palatable: 1) put a cheapo cooling rack in the bottom of your pan to keep the pork out of the oil/grease 2) 1/4 cup of cheddar per chop is a bit excessive, I'd eyeball it and just put on a minimal sprinkling until it looks right to you 3) DON'T rely on the cooking time (you never should anyway, too much variance between ovens) and instead opt to monitor them with a thermometer--then you won't be sorry.

Like I said, it was edible, and perhaps with some of the changes I listed above, I might try it again....maybe....if there is nothing else that I have on hand to make....

Fabulous!  By no means low fat according to the original recipe but modifiable.  I recommend using a meat thermometer - pork overdone is nasty.

Well, I thought it was pretty good, but I asked my hubby and his response was "You get an A for effort babe". So, I guess I will rate this as "average".

We mixed the ingredients into a sauce first and spread over and it was amazing I would actually make this as a sauce and use it for other meals as well.

Sorry folks, this one was not so good to me.  Tasted like pork chops with mayo on top.  I know others found it quite good so maybe it was just our taste.

AWESOME!!!  I used Montreal Steak seasoning, but all the other ingredients the same.  I cooked for 45 min. 'cause I made six chops.  They were really yummy!!!!  Thanks.

Very best pork chops ever.  I seasoned them before adding butter and mayo with salt, pepper, garlic and onion.  I had colby jack cheese so used that instead of sharp cheddar and my normally very picky husband that wants only salt and pepper added to his fried or grilled meat absolutely loved it.

We eat these about once a week. They are so yummy! I only use 2 teaspoons butter and 1 tablespoon of mayo and it is a lot less greasy. I like things a little crispy on the outside and moist inside . The cheddar keeps things really moist.

Yummy, but kind of greasy with the bone in loins. Added several spices etc and melted the butter and mayo together as well. Will update about leftovers...

I have to say that we were skeptical, but were curious to see how they would turn out. I made these with just one change - I mixed together the butter, mayo and seasonings and then spread on top and sides of 1 1/2 inch thick chops and they were absolutely first rate.  I would never have thought to smother these in cheese, but the combinations of the ingredients just work.  This will be a recipe that we will make over and over again.  Thanks!!

I made this the first time with 4 thin bonless chops and it was OK. They would have been better with just Shake and Bake. The 2nd time I did it I made with 2 THICK  bone-in chops and it was much better. I really think it moistened the thick chops and kept them juicy. I moved it up from a 3 to a 4 for the last meal.

I thought this recipe was really good!!  A good way to put a twist on some pork chops!!  I used margerine instead of butter and it tasted just fine.  Next time I make it I will for sure use a little less mayo.  However, I did use thin pork chops so maybe 1 tsp of mayo would be fine with thicker chops.  This is going to be a regular meal we are gonna make at my house.

Overall a quick and easy way to make pork chops.  I think I would have preferred a different variation of the cheese topping but otherwise it was a pretty good meal.  I served it with Fried Broccoli and Cajun Sweet Potatoes.

These were easy and tasted fine, but they were nothing special. The mayo and butter combo is salty, so seasoning the chops with salt made the final product too salty for our tastes. The chops were tender, and I might make again, but it's not the best pork chop recipe.

This turned out great!!!!!!  The only thing I did different was I used rosemary instead of the parsley, and i chopped up some green onions using the greens as well. A very, very good recipe.

Easy quick meal to fix.  Cut the spices in half, but otherwise followed recipe.  Very good and would make again. (I didn't use pepper because it's not in the ingredient list, but noticed in directions after I had it in the oven, suppose you can add at table, if you like)

These were pretty good for simple ingredients. I love pork chops but get annoyed at how dry they can get. Somehow these were pretty tender. I did forget the garlic powder & I never have dried parsley. I just sprinkled them with sea salt & fresh ground pepper. I baked for about 30 min (used thin, boneless chops) @ 350degrees. A strange combo but it works!

This had great flavor and the chops were soooo juicy.  There was a lot of fat that ran off into the pan.  It was not greay though.  I don't think there is anything to be done about the fat.  but this is definitely a keeper!!

Very easy and very very good.  There was some left over in the fridge and my daughter ate one and called  me and said that those pork chops were great and wanted to know how I made them.  She never does that.  Thanks

We did not care for this combination - although the mayo and butter kept the chops juicy, it also made them greasier than usual, and the cheese did not seem to add anything much to the flavor. It was not bad - but not anything I would consider making again.

This was good, nice flavor.  Only had colby-jack on hand but it worked fine.  Did mix the butter and mayo b4 spreading.  Simple is true but tastes like you worked harder.

This is really simple (like the title) to put together and taste delicious.   I cooked three for dinner and hubby went back for his second one.     So, I know they taste good - because he is pretty darn picky.

In my oven it took about 32 minutes. I highly recommend a digital meat thermometer, it makes all the difference in baking pork. I also used Cabot white cheddar. I didn't worry about slathering the butter perfectly or anything like that. I just put a chunk of butter spread out the mayonnaise and  topped with cheese. What a nice recipe! This will be a go to for years after I get out of prison.

I was looking for something I could put together quickly and stick in the oven so I could work on other things while dinner cooked ... I live alone, and this recipe is SO easy to adapt to just one chop, so I tried it.  Measurements don't have to be exact, and you could probably use any seasonings you want ... I stuck with the recipe and it was delicious.  I did broil it for an extra couple of minutes just to get the cheese a little brown and bubbly.  It was delicious ... will go back to this again and again !

I used fat free bleu cheese dressing in place of the butter and mayo.  Also added a few panko bread crumbs to the cheese  :)
Broiled for a few minutes at the end.

35 minutes was way too long for mine, and they came out so tough that I could barely chew the meat.  But we liked the flavor on top :)

Melting the butter & using a basting brush and having a squirt bottle type mayo makes quick prep time.  Worked okay using asst'd cut, bone-in chops too. It's a good base recipe; wil add add'l seasoning next time.

I thought this was just OK.  The taste was a little odd, and the chop wasn't overly tender.  Probably won't make it again.

My husband and I didn't care for these.  Didn't have much flavor.  I don't really get the purpose of the butter and mayo.  It just adds lots of extra grease.

Absolutely delicious! Made enough to enjoy leftovers for a couple days and it was just as terrific on the last day.  Adding it to my rotation.

Wow!  This was amazing - best pork chops ever!  Super moist, lots of flavor and lots of compliments.  I used Miracle Whip, didn't have mayo.  I also didn't have seasoned salt, so I just used regular salt -- and, following the advice of others, I cut the amount of salt in half and it was plenty.  I also mixed all of the ingredients, other than the cheese, and then spread it on the pork chops.  The ONLY change I'll make next time is to stick the pan under the broiler when it's done cooking to brown the cheese.  One very important note - I used a meat thermometer when I cooked the pork to make absolutely certain it was cooked to the temperature we like (150 degrees) -- once it hit 150, I pulled it out of the oven.  I only had to cook it for 20 minutes, if I had cooked for the time recommended, I would have had shoe leather...

Delicious!  I had no idea cheese would work so well on pork chops.  Made it exactly as the recipe said to, and would happily make it again.

Didn't make any changes ingredient wise, but did mix the mayo with the butter and put the seasoning in the mix before spreading it on. It was okay, I ate most of my chop. It was *very* salty. And I like salt. My 7 year old loved it, lol. I probably won't make it again.

I was blown away at the thought of using a mayo/butter marinade on pork chops.....!!! But BOY, these were tasty! Honestly, I hate pork chops but my husband picked them up during our last (attempting to be) budget-friendly shopping trip. This recipe lit a fire in me that will passionately burn for years and meals to come!!! Thanks for sharing!


I followed some tips from previous users and lightened up on the cheese (just preference) and premixed the butter/mayo. Other than that, followed to a "T"! AWESOME! BTW, I used a super thin slice of pork chop. I saw a previous user complain about her 3in not cooking in time... Mine are like a half inch and perfect! :)

I too mixed the butter & mayo- much easier to spread. I used parmesan  cheese rather than cheddar. Baked 28 min but should've pulled them a few minutes earlier. Still very good

This was decent for the near lack of effort required to execute it! I will definitely make again, as my kids were very satisfied with it! My husband wasn't crazy about it, but he is extremely hard to please if it isn't steak lol! I didn't have enough mayo even reducing it, so I added a bit of ranch dressing and it came out really flavorful!

I thought the taste was ok, but I didn't expect the mayo to look like it did under the cheese...it was by first time ever baking anything besides a cake with mayonnaise, so I didn't know what to expect, it was not appealing to me at all.  That being said, ny husband loved it! If I could have gotten past the mayo issue, I probably would have liked it a lot more, but once I saw it, I was sure I could taste it, too, lol. Next time I will omit it.

Instead of all the salt/garlic/parsley, we used the herb & garlic mayo, mixed with the butter, and then topped with Lawry's and cheese. The kids and hubby loved it!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight, and I have to say, it is the best pork chop recipe I have ever had! Even my husband, who hates mayo, LOVED it! I did use Parmesan instead of Cheddar. Cannot wait to cook it again :)

We just finished these yummy chops! My husband is a pork chop lover, he loved them with cheese. I will definately make these again. The mayo and butter topping seems like it would be a good topping for chicken too. It really kept the chops nice and moist. Can't wait to try it.

The method of cooking the chops was perfect, I must say. I followed the recipe as written, it needed double the time stated to cook (for 3/4" thick chops & I browned them in a skillet for 3 mins. on each side first!) and was wayyyyy too salty!!! I am naturally a SALT FANATIC but, even for me, it was more than I could handle!! I suggest, depending on the thickness of your chops, only seasoning them with the mayo/butter/parsley mixture before putting them in the oven. If you have thicker chops, brown them in a little vegetable oil on med-low heat for 3-4 mins. on each side before cooking at 350 deg. for at least an hour turning them half way through. THEY WERE EXTREMELY TENDER & JUICY, but we had to throw them out due to the UNBEARABLE saltiness that had penetrated every chop!!! I had VERY HIGH HOPES for this recipe because it sounded so original and delicious but, I have to say, I felt very guilty for having wasted all of those expensive ingredients on a dinner that didn't even yield any leftovers. Next time, I will know better.....  Thanks for the great method of cooking my pork chops in the oven. Other than that, I think you may need to tweak your recipe just a bit.

I didn't find these nearly as good as most reviewers, but my chops were very thick-cut.  I think it's worth another try with a thinner chop.

This was so easy and exceptionally tasteful! I was very skeptical at first, because I am not a "cook" and was very unsure of how hard this would be or if I was going to "mess it up", but this is nearly impossible to do. GREAT dish!!!!

Delicious and easy!  I just had my first baby and it's been hard to find recipes that I can take on and get on the table without too much interruption.  This is great.  I season and sear the chops before throwing them in the oven.

followed this exact.  For the butter I used spray so it would be easier to spread the mayo on top.  I found this to be a nice change for pork chops and very easy.  The pork chops were very juicy not dry and overdone.  I will be making this again.

Very simple. To me and my bf the taste of it  reminded us of fried/scrambled eggs. It was good but we couldn't get over how much it reminded us of breakfast. So for us it isn't something we would eat again, but was worth trying.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  As a rule I am not a fan of pork chops but these....are so so good.  The only ingredient I leave out is the parsley because I don't have it on hand, it doesn't matter.  Also, I use whatever cheese I have available, they are all great on this dish.  If you are questioning whether ort not you should make this....go ahead and do it....you won't be sorry!

So easy and tasted so good!  I don't like mayo either but I took the suggestion of another reviewer.  They said to use Ranch, I didn't have any, but I had a sweet onion dressing - so good! They came out perfect and juicy.  I will make this again!

These were really good. I was out of parsley so I used thyme instead and they came out wonderful. My wife and son really enjoyed them. We added this recipe to our "make it again" list.

I tried mixing the mayo and butter like others have suggested and that was kinda messy. I increased the garlic powder a little (and omitted the salt), and that flavor came out great. As I was putting the cheese on, there was just tons there... used 3/4 cup and stopped. left the dish very oily between the ingredients anyway. DH and both liked it okay, not a bad flavor but not our favorite.

The flavor of these pork chops were good, but they were not nearly tender enough for us. I followed the recipe, but maybe I did something wrong??

My family LOVED these. I used thinly sliced pork chops and I was a bit skeptical about the mayo...but my family asks every week for this for dinner! We went from a family who rarely had pork to them wanting this recipe all the time. Go figure!! Thank you so much for a great recipe!

I am so impressed with this recipe.  My kids DEVOURED these pork chops and I have to admit I was wishing I had made a few extra chops. The kids could cut the meat with their forks they were that tender.  The tangyness of the mayo (people, don't use miracle whip on these, it's NOT the same as mayo.  I love miracle whip on a sandwich just like the next guy but it's not a substitute for mayo in everything!! sorry, I'll get down off my soap box now)is a tad strong so next time I may use a bit of sour cream in it's place.  Just to experiment and see if it works.  That is just being nitpicky...these are great!

I didn't think that this turned out very well, although my husband didn't think that it was too bad. It was really oily and the pork wasn't all that moist. I was disappointed.

Even though I hate mayo, I tried this recipe because of all the good reviews. My family really didn't care for it, but I do see potential. There was just way too much butter and mayo - it was like melted butter soup in the bottom of the pan. maybe less next time and make sure to brown up the cheese a bit - that part was the best.

Combined all ingredients and put on top of chops.  I added additional garlic, some onion powder and cayenne as people were saying it was a little bland.  It was definitely too salty, but the underlying flavor was good.  It wasn't greasy at all, and I'll definitely make this again.  However, I will omit the salt completely.  Also, I used this on 3/4 inch boneless chops, I think this would work better with a thinner cut.

We really like these chops! Great step away from the ordinary. My only change would be to use half the seasoning salt and maybe another herb combo. Was kinda salty for my personal taste.

I mixed the butter, mayo and spices together and then spread it on each pork chop.  Then topped with cheese.  It was just ok.  I didn't care for the spread.

This is truly a nice and simple dish. It was quick in the oven and I could concentrate on other things. The smell during the baking was awesome. I used the sauce that was in the pan afterwards to put on the noodles. Really yummie.

I made these tonight for my family and Daycare children and even my picky eater enjoyed these pork chops.  I mixed the butter, mayo and seasonings together before putting the ingredients on the pork chops.....much easier.  I will make this dish for my family again but will try with the spray oil instead of the butter to make it a little bit healthier.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were tasty and a nice spin on plain pork chops. I mixed all the butter, mayo and seasoning together before spreading on three very thick. They turned out delicious and moist. For those saying they were too greasy, I wonder if they were using tablespoons of butter and mayo instead of teaspoons. We will definitely  be making these again.

Good, easy, and quick. The only thing I'd change the next time is to combine the butter and the mayo beforehand. Will definitely consider adding this to the dinnertime rotation.

Great, easy recipe.  I mixed the spices and used them as a rub.  Then I used ranch dip (not dressing)because I don't really like mayonaise and mixed it with the melted butter and cheese and spread on top.  Loved the flavor and it kept the pork moist (I used thick boneless pork chops)

This was mediocre at best.  It would probably have tasted better if the seasonings were on the meat instead of the mayo.  I don't think I'll try it again to find out though.

Awsome... My husband isn't crazy about pork but loved this recipe. The taste is wonderful and the chops are so tender.  I made them in a stoneware baking dish. (Natually you have to bake them according to your oven and thickness of the chops.) About 45 min.  This dish is so easy and looks great. Will make it again for hubby and also for guests! You can't go wrong with this one.  It's GREAT!

First of all I used an Italian cheese blend instead of cheddar. But this recipe was great. My husband didn't care for the "stuff" under the cheese but I will make this again because it was delicious and so easy. The pork was very tender and moist. Will play with the topping though.

We all really liked this. Next time I might use a little less cheese and maybe thicken the sauce a little. Otherwise, perfect. Great with a side of chicken and mushroom rice a roni and broccoli for a veggie.

My fiance adores this recipe!  He's asked me to make it at least once a week, and says that it's the best thing I've ever made!  His only complaint was that I didn't make enough.

My family loved it even though I messed up. The ingredients calls for garlic powder, but the instruction say pepper, I wasn't thinking much about it and used pepper the first time. Now I did it the right way and it is great. Thanks for sharing.

I've made these pork chops a couple of times.  I love them!  Instead of sharp cheddar I use colby.

I like to make this with sliced fried potatoes.

My hubby and I both agreed this was just "okay." The chops came out a little too salty for my taste and my husband didn't care for the cheese and scraped it off. However, it was really easy and the prep time was quick so I do plan on making this again and tinkering around with some of the ingredients.

LOVED it!!!  I used bone-in pork loin chops, because I had them--had to cook longer because of it.  The only change I made was to add some Parmesan cheese on top of the cheddar.

Simple and easy.  I put BBQ rub on my pork chops, seared on one side in a cast iron, flipped to the other side to sear and put in the oven.  Added cheese on top the last 5 minutes.  I never thought about putting cheese on top until now and it turned out wonderful!

Delicious! Of course, I made a couple of changes:

• I combined the butter, mayonnaise, and seasonings together while the oven was heating and let the flavours blend into a compound butter/aioli. I also used minced garlic (1 tsp per chop) rather than garlic powder and added a little cayenne to perk up the taste.

• when the oven came up to temperature, I used a spatula to spread the butter mixture over the chops and then covered with cheese and baked as per directions.

• The pan juices were so flavourful that we couldn’t resist dipping our dinner rolls into the pan, but I think one could just as easily mix up extra butter/aioli and spread it on bread and sprinkle cheese to make incredible garlic bread using this recipe!

• The pan juices were so tasty that after dinner I mixed the remainder with a good amount of cream and made a wonderful savoury spread for the next morning’s bagels.  Highly recommended!

I made this last night and it was delicious.  Quick, easy, and as an added bonus I could fix just one!  I live alone so making a dish, however good it may be, that serves 6 is usually not an option.  I made Chef John's recipe for seasoning salt and it was perfect.

I used EVOO instead of mayo.  I used fresh basil and parsley along with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.  I used the butter on top of each pork chop and basted them halfway through cooking process.  Absolutely delicious!

I really enjoyed this recipe and I had no complaints from the rest of the family even though my husband never eats pork! I did not include the better cause II’m watching calories And I followed other reviewer’s suggestions to add the cheese in the last 15 minutes and to add Dijon mustard. I will definitely make this again so easy.

My family liked the chops okay.  They were very moist and tender.  But need to tweak the recipe next time.  We found the cheese didn't add to the dish, so I'll  leave off the cheese.  Also, the garlic powder was too strong, so will use fresh garlic.  Will replace the seasoned salt  with Mrs. Dash original.  Can't wait to try them with my corrections.

I made this last night for dinner.  I didn't know what to do with the boneless chops I had so I went looking for a recipe.  This one looked easy and with minimal ingredients.  I too mixed the butter and mayonnaise. I also added French fried onions on top the cheese; that gave a nice added flavor. I gave it only 4 stars because I thought the chops were a little dry. Maybe I'll decrease cooking time next time.

Tastes great, but if you cook it 35 minutes at 350 degrees, it will still be raw.  Up the temp to 425, and add another 30 minutes to get semi-thick chops fully done.

Yes it sounds odd but was this ever tasty!  I cooked a single chop in a toaster oven so only took about 18 minutes. This one is a keeper!

The best way too make porkchops I've ever tried. So moist and soo easy to make. I wasn't sure about the mayo part at first but you would never know it was on after its baked. I used bone in chops because that's what I had and it was great.

Delicious! Fast, easy, full of flavor. Followed the recipe exactly (I mixed the mayo and butter together before spreading on the pork chops).

I got lazy and mixed the butter, mayo, and spices all together and then spread the mixture over the chops. Sprinkled with sharp cheddar and Voila! Hubby asked me to "please don't lose this recipe". Thanks for submitting this one!!

Made it twice now. Family has declared it their new favorite meal. With how easy it is, and usually have all ingredients in the house, it is my new favorite to make! 
The second time I made it, I mixed together the mayo, butter and spices and then spread them on the pork chops. It was so much easier and didn't change the taste or presentation since the pretty spices are covered by cheese anyway. 
Love the "au juice" served over rice.

I thought this was a great recipe for moist pork chops. So many times, pork comes out dry, with this recipe, it is moist and tender. 
We prefer using no mayo, just butter, but that our personal opinion. I have made this twice so far and will be adding it to our regular pork line-up. 
Thanks!

Followed the recipe exactly, per ingredients requested. I did add a few shots of ground black pepper, only because they mentioned pepper in the instructions, but not in the ingredients. It was done in 35 minutes and full of flavour. Thanks for sharing a great recipe...it's a keeper!

This came out great. I only had bone-in pork chops so I used that. I followed other reviewers advice. I mixed the mayo and butter. I also added the garlic powder and dried parsley to the mixture before I spread the butter/mayo on to the pork chops. I think I added more than 1 teaspoon. I didn't really measure it.I just estimate the amount. 
I will definitely do this recipe again.

this one is definitely in my official recipe book.
But we got tired of mayonnaise and tried so.e other things.
 I've found you can substitute just about any sort of condiment or spread for the mayonnaise.
so far, we've used Guacamole, Hummus and Cream Cheese, and they've been great.

Like others, mixed butter and mayo the first time. (Other idea below) Thick chops so added mozzarella and cheddar cheeses later. Have made it a few times for the kids cuz it made it's way into the meal rotation plan.

An idea I borrowed from a steak recipe that works well. Can make a topping (minus cheese) ahead and store in the refrigerator for up to a few days ahead. Make a paste with softened butter, mayo and dry ingredients (plus parmesan , form the blend into an longed roll formed inside of a sheet of plastic wrap. Roll the plastic and store in the fridge till ready. Then cut evenly into pieces to put on top of pork.

Saw the recipe, and was hesitant about the mayonnaise. I used ranch dressing instead. Mixed the butter and ranch together, then spread on top. I also used finely shredded Mexican cheese blend because that's all I had. They turned out absolutely delicious. My wife never finishes her plate, and even got a second chop.

I took the recommendation of mixing the butter and mayo to make spreading easier, but went a step further and added the seasoning to the mix as well.  These were some of the best and most flavorful chops I've ever had.  From the lower end reviews complaining about flavor I also salt, peppered and lightly garlic powdered the bottoms.  I'm not quite sure if the cheese is necessary, but the butter/mayo/spice mix was awesome.

This is delicious!  I made it for my kids and my husband came home, finished up what was still on the baking tray, and then literally took the food off his son's plate!!
I made a few tweaks - i put a dry rub on the meat with onion powder, sage, celery salt, regular salt and pepper. I omitted the butter and just put mayo.  Came out better than i thought it would!

Delicious and moist! Mayo is the key. My husband loves this recipe. My pork chops are generally pretty thick and it only takes about 25 mins to get to 145 in the middle. I followed the current recipe the first time and overcooked my chops I would set a timer for 20-25 and check it. Overall, very good!

Oh my gosh my family loved these!!!!  SO moist and tender.  I cooked 6 boneless center cut chops according to the directions with a minor change.  I used reduced fat ranch dressing instead of mayo because I don't like mayo and never have it on hand.  I mixed the dressing and butter together and spread on top of the chops - much easier to spread the butter by doing that.   I tried this recipe as a "tester" (tell my family if they don't like it, we'll go out to eat).  It was unanimous - this recipe was added to the BOX!  Such a great alternative to broiled or grilled pork chops that can sometimes be too dry.

Tastes great, however, the pork chop wasn't very tender. My fault, I should know. Pork HAS to be brined. Will make again with brined pork chops, then it will be 5 star-worthy, I'm sure.

It was incredibly salty but it wasn't terrible in taste. If we make it again we will probably reduce the amount of some of the ingredients.

I made this tonight for dinner. I mixed butter and mayo before spreading on chops. Read in a review how they did not brown, so I broiled for about last 15 mins. Then put cheese on and threw back in oven just to melt! These were very tasty for as simple of a  recipe this is. I will more than likely make these again or try same thing with chicken. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I used less mayo and butter so I could feel better about my diet. I used two kinds of cheese (mozz and sharp cheddar). I added a few extra spices like turmeric and paprika for the top. The parsley is great on the chops. They were flavorful and tender.

Very yummy.  The mayo butter mix sounds weird but u don't really taste it.  I agree with others mix the mayo and butter together first

I made this for my mom. She must have said how delicious and juicy they were about ten different times. :) I liked them, too. Super simple, super tasty.

Add a little to your cook time, or raise the temp.  It was salty. (For me) Use unsalted butter and use less seasoned salt. Lucky for me, hubs likes salty... (I rarely cook with it, I let people add salt to their liking) other than the few tweaks, it was good!

Delicious! The only changes I made were to soften the butter and mix it with the mayonnaise before spreading it on the pork chops.  I also doubled the recipe in order to make 8 instead of 4.  End the end, I decided to do 6 chops the new way and leave 2 pork chops plain just in case the hubby didn't like the recipe.  He is a stickler about his pork chops and usually doesn't prefer anything extra like sauce or gravy on his.  When he made his plate for dinner, to my surprise, he took one regular pork chop and one of the cheese topped pork chops.  I said, "Let me know how it tastes."  He took one bite of the cheese topped pork chop and said, "It's good!" When he went back for seconds, he by passed the other plain pork chop, I had prepared for him, and went for another cheese topped pork chop. Lol! I will be making this again! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Great flavor but the chop was a tough. I was hoping that it wasn't going to be so chewed. I think I will try this again with chicken and see how it goes. Awesome flavor!!!

I liked this recipe, but found it took closer to 45 minutes to bake (I used boneless) and the cheese  sort of slid off. I fixed that by adding more cheese to it 10 minutes before removing from the oven.

I'd like to start by saying that I am not someone who generally likes pork and even I like this!

Dinner tonight started off with a different recipe so the pork was brined' the pork for 2 hours in a mix of water, salt, garlic, chili and lemongrass. I then patted it dry and put it on a tray before spreading margarine (my butter was rock solid) and the mayonnaise on top and adding the cheese. I let the cheese melt for about 15 minutes before adding some fresh parsley and letting it cook the rest of the way.

I was a bit sceptical about the mayonnaise and cheese with the pork but dinner turned out to be a big success and the guests thought it was 'something very different' and 'surprisingly delicious'! I will definitely be masking this again!

I used all of the ingredients, just didn't assemble them exactly the same way.  I didn't measure the seasonings, just sprinkled the tops of the pork chops generously with them.  Then I melted the butter in the microwave and stirred in the mayo, then spread that over the chops and sprinkled on the cheese.  My pork chops were the really thick kind, so they baked for 45 minutes.  They turned out great, though!  My husband and I both really liked them, and they're so easy and use ingredients we always have (minus the pork chops).  I bet I will make this one pretty frequently!  Next time I'll try stirring the seasonings into the butter/mayo mixture, but that's just to streamline the process even more.

This was much tastier than I thought it would be. However, mine did not end up crispy like in the picture. Instead, there was, as I suspected, a lot of liquid (melted fats, butter, mayo) in the bottom of the dish. The flavor was still great, even though I did garlic powder and salt instead of seasoned salt, but I do wish it had been crispier. Maybe doing it on the stove would cause the cheese to crisp up? Also, as other mentioned, it's a bit difficult to spread butter, then mayo, so perhaps mixing them first would've helped a bit more. Still, I imagine it would've been difficult regardless.

I don't eat meat but my husband thought these were great. I even messed it up a little by melting the better instead of softening it. I mixed the mayo with it (which didn't really work; there were little clumps of mayo floating in the butter and I was positive I ruined it!) and poured it over the chops. I seasoned them with salt, pepper, parsley, onion powder and garlic powder. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes. Chops were juicy and tender, like I said the hubby loved them.

My fiance asks for this recipe all the time! This is so easy and yummy!

I've made this recipe a dozen times and love it. A go-to for a quick and easy dinner that's absolutely delish! Have done it with both pork and chicken. Tonigh I am doing it with chicken and switching it up and using the Land O Lakes Garlic and Herb spread in place of regular butter and garlic powder! Can't wait to find out how it comes out!

This was pretty good. I forgot to take a pic tho. My husband loved it. I followed recipe pretty much as is except I mixed all the spices together with the mayo and butter and then spread it on the pork chops. I also doubled the ingredients to make more sauce since I had 9 boneless chops and I put the spread on both sides not just the top. It was pretty good and definitely something different for boring pork chops. I will make again!

This was very good and I'm not a big pork chop fan. I seasoned the chops on both sides with garlic and seasoned salt then added the butter/mayo spread. Topped with shredded 5 cheese Italian for the last 10 mins. Easy and tasty.

Great and simple recipe. I'm a guy that doesn't like to buy a lot of ingredients to cook something. With this recipe I already had everything I needed. Wasn't sure what it was going to taste like but I was extremely surprised. This was honestly the most delicious pork chop I have ever tasted and my wife was shocked that I had cooked something this good.

My family loved this! It came out very tender. After reading some of the reviews I decided to leave out the butter, added 1/2 tsp. onion powder to the spice mixture, omitted pepper and salt,  and sprinkled on Cheddar/Monterrey jack cheese. The topping stayed on and added just the right amount of flavor. I used pork chops that were on the thinner side ( less than 1/2") and they were done on time. We have pork chops at least once a week and will definitely have this again.

Surprisingly good tasting and very easy. Works just as well for bone-in chops.

I'm not sure what I may have done wrong, but I am not a fan of these.  Maybe I used too much butter.

Awesome! I do it to chicken breasts, turkey steaks and pork chops. I don't use the parsley. I mix the butter and mayo together, smear a big spoonful on each piece of meat, sprinkle with the seasonings and top with a pile grated cheddar.  SO easy!! The boys always ask for more.

So simple and so MOIST, without having to sear first. Wow, a keeper for sure. I mixed the mayo with Brummell and Brown yogurt spread, and seasoned the meat first before putting on the spread. Then I sprinkled with parsley. I did not use cheese and it was still delish. Baked 3/4" chops for 30 mins and they came out perfectly. Thank you!!

Easy to make, and really delicious.  I melted the butter, mixed it with  ranch (instead of mayo), and poured it over the chops in a 9 x 13 pan sprayed with EVOO.  Sprinkled with about 1/2 tsp or less seasoned salt, pepper, and dried parsley and basil (didn't use garlic powder).  Used about 1/2 cup of grated sharp cheddar.  Baked as directed.  Served with ratatouille and rice.  Got rave reviews from hubby and company!  This will be my go-to pork chop recipe.

Used ranch bc I didn't have mayo, and used the spices as a dry rub instead of sprinkling after. they were goooood. 350 for 25 minutes got them to 135 degrees internal temp for me, then 10 minutes sitting on the counter finished getting them cooked. Delicious. Next time I think I will add some onion powder as well......

A last minute move that I made for my wife. The recipe is super easy with a good pay off.

I think I used less cheese that in the recipe and used Mozzarella instead of sharp cheddar.  I also used Garlic Salt instead of Garlic powder and used chops with bone in but it all turned out great and very tasty.

We'll pop in in the rotation for sure.

Great taste for so little effort.  Glad I didn't have to brown the chops first.  That always makes a big mess.

This was disappointing! I followed the recipe but forgot the garlic powder because it wasn't in the written directions. While the meat was cooking toppings, butter, mayo, cheese slid off of the meat. 
Wouldn't fix again!

Excellent recipe.  Substituted Mrs. Dash for seasoning salt as on a low to sodium free diet.  Still like the butter idea as it really is not a whole lot of sodium.

Delicious! Easy! Fast!

I don't know how many times I've tried a highly rated recipe 'as is' only to be disappointed with the outcome. Not this one. It was flavorful, juicy, and tender. My girls ate every bit of it and my husband loved it. I was hesitant about the mayo but I'm sure glad I used it. Don't skip it!

Very simple and very good.  Had thin chops so I reduced the time and they came out very moist.  I had some French's Onion pieces in my pantry and sprinkled them on top for the last 5 mins. of baking.  Added a little crunch and improved appearance.  Will do again.  Served it over Quinoa flavored with rosemary, diced yellow pepper and sundried tomatoes.

My mom made these for dinner and my husband has been raving about them ever since, so I made them for us the following weekend. The dish was easy to prepare and the flavor is fantastic.  I was a little worried about the amount of salt when I was sprinkling it on top of each chop as it looked like a lot, but they tasted fine.  They were wonderfully flavorful and tender.  Made the dish exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing!  Served with home fries and apple salad.

I salt and peppered both sides of the chops and placed them in a glass dish. Placed butter on the tops along with Miracle Whip. Had some smoked ham in the fridge I had gotten from the deli. I chopped it up real fine and spread it on top the mayo. Then I took taco cheese and spread all over the chops. Placed a small bit of chopped ham on top the cheese. Threw some fresh garlic and ginger in the bottom of the dish and baked it. BEST CHOPS I EVER MADE!

I was unsure about this but all the reviews were so good. Yeah it is flavorful but the cheese on top does not belong. Not good. We like trying new things but this one is a loser.

A great simple recipe for pork chops.  They came out really moist and oh so tasty. Even my picky eater granddaughter ate all of it and asked for more.  This recipe is a keeper at our house.

This recipe was a great inspiration for me to create a similar dish. I paired the porkchops with fresh pineapple and the tastes complimented each other famously. Also served with saffron couscous.

I made this last night and loved it!  I used Adobo in place of all the spices because it incorporated all of them.  I put butter in microwave for 15 seconds to soften it and then combined the mayo with it and then rubbed it on the chops.  This is wonderful!  We put the juice after baking on our rice that I served this with and it was so good.  Will make this again!

Tried this but added a little panko breadcrumbs on top instead of cheese. 35 mins. was too long - they were a little dry. Anyone suggest
a lesser cook time or a good time to check the temp?

YUM!!!! I made this for dinner and my family loved it!  Definitely going in the recipe box.  I followed the directions, but just seasoned to taste...didn't measure. I cooked exactly 35 minutes and they came out perfect!

these were wonderful. I used mayo and ranch dressing and minced garlic instead of powder and they were yummy. A lady my DH works with smelled his lunch the next day and asked for the recipe.

My family and I did NOT enjoy this. I read some of the other reviews and tried the ranch dressing. NOT a good idea. The seasonings did not go well together and all the cheese was melted off the chops and I added it only 15 minutes before they were done.

I made this for dinner tonight with 2 small changes and it was excellant!  Easy to make, very little prep or clean up, and the pork chops were moist adn yummy!  The two simple changes i made were 1- i made an herb stuffing and baked the chops on top of the stuffing and 2- i skipped the cheddar cheese.  Using the stuffing made the cook time a little longer, but was well worth it!

I was looking for a pork chop recipe that was fairly quick.  Everyone liked these. We don't like mayo, so I used ranch instead. I made double the recipe and it was still done in less time than stated.

Why didn't mine look like the picture if I followed the recipe? The topping basically ended up in the pan as a liquid not the nice golden brown like the picture?

OK but I won't make it again. It's one of those recipes you  don't tell them the ingredients until have they tell you what they think. My youngest came out and said she did not like the cheese on top, my husband said it was pretty good and asked if it was blue cheese. They were very mosit, I followed the recipe to a t but won't make them again as I didn't really care for them.

We all liked it, even my picky kids.  I didn't have seasoned salt, so I found a recipe for it, then found that I had no paprika, so I just threw on the other spices-onion powder, salt, pepper, garlic.

Excellent recipe. I served the chops over white rice, steamed broccoli and a pomegranate juice reduction sauce. I took away one star because 4 tablespoons of butter is definitely too much. This entire recipe should be cut in half. The seasonings and butter/mayo was enough for 8 chops.

I thought this was an odd combination, but made it because of the reviews and the fact that it was late, dinner needed to be made, and I had the ingredients.  I did use ranch instead of mayo--I just can't go there conceptually.  It is great! It's become a staple for a quick dinner.  I do have to be careful and not get it too salty.

I thought that these turned out really well. I blended the mayo with the butter before spreading, it does make it much easier. And I had sharp cheddar that I grated over the top. I used 6 smaller chops so I just guessed on the amount of cheese on top. I baked them at 350 for about 30 minutes. They were moist and flavorful. The only drawback I saw was that the cheese melted right off the top. ((We just scooped it back up but...)) I may next time add the cheese to the top about 10 minutes before done. See if it sticks better....But the entire family really liked this so we will use again!! Thanks

Very juicy and delicious.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good and easy porkchop recipe.  I thought the idea was a little weird but my partner really loves cheese so I went for it.  I do not regret it!  Do try this dish!

awesome, i love cheese and was thrilled it worked so well with pork chops! i also mixed the butter and mayo, and used oregano, salt and pepper instead of whatever else and it turned out just awesome with thin chops, and broiled the cheese a bit at the end. simple, quick and yummy! thanks!!

My boyfriend and I rarely eat pork, but decided to try this recipe.  It was very good and very easy to make!  We will be adding to rotation.

This was an ok pork chop dish. Better than the basic shake and bake but not as flavorful as I had hoped. I suggest expanding on the seasoning options.

I also mixed together the mayo and butter together (used light Miracle Whip and margarine) before spreading on the chops which worked well.  The pork chops did not cook all the way through, so I had to cook an extra 10 minutes, which I think dried out the pork a little.  I think next time I will brown in pan before for a few minutes then bake.  Tasted good anyway and Dad said I should make again

First and foremost the chops were very tender! Flavor was good as well. I made them earlier in the morning (dinner time is crazy with 5 kids) I took readers suggestions and mixed mayo with butter. My kids loved them. I think I will brown them with onions next time. Very good though thank you!

Just didn't do it for me at all. The cheese floated on top of the mayo/butter and actually floated off a couple of the chops all together. Needs more flavor too.  I used the recipe as is, no changes.

This was a hit for my family.  I used other's suggestions and marinated the pork chops in salt and pepper for 1/2 hour and then mixed the mayo (low fat) with olive oil instead of butter for a healthier version and added the seasonings with extra garlic since we are fans of garlic.  They turned out great! I will definitely make again.

This was a surprisingly easy recipe to make.  My wife even tried her hand at it and thought it simple.  Not to mention the taste was wonderful.  I had no idea that the mayo would mix well in the recipe, but it did.  The mayo added a slight twang but by no means overpowered the meal...you will not be let down by this recipe.  If you are tired of doing the same ole things with chops, try it once and you will want to do it again.

Pork chops were nice and moist, but the flavor was not "WOW" for us.  Just tasted like seasoned pork chops with cheese on top.  I actually could not taste the cheese really.

I tried this recipe last night and I thought it had a nice flavor to it.  I followed the recipe to a "T".  It was juicy, but the pork chops turned out tough to eat.  Not sure what happened.  This is the second recipe I have tried from this site and found the meat to be tough.  The other recipe I tried was with chicken.  I think I may need to find another store to buy my meat at.

This was quite easy and very tasty.  My pork chops were small and not incredibly thick, so I only cooked them for 30 minutes.  Definitely a recipe that I would make again.

My family really liked this. Like some other reviewers, I melted the margarine and mixed it together with the mayonnaise. I used light mayo, since that's all I had. I used the smallest casserole dish the chops would fit in, so they would "marinate" more in the sauce. I'll make it again!

I followed another's suggestion to mix butter and mayo. Other than that followed the recipe. My cheese melted off and made a greasy mess with the butter. Still determined I spooned the sauce over each chop as I served them. They were very chewy. Probably won't make again. I was hoping it would be like a chicken monterey but with pork. BTW The sauce was actually good, if your not counting fat grams and all. But hey, who doesn't love butter and cheese?

I used bone-in chops, otherwise followed the recipe and found this to be very greasy. We didn't care for the sharp cheddar on the pork.

The pork never browned, and needed much more time to cook than what is noted in recipe. Didn't like the mayo toppping.  My 10 year old and hubby did like the recipe.  This is not going to be a "make again" at my house.

Very good! Was very skeptical at first because of the mayo/butter but I was very pleasantly surprised!! Will most definitely make again. I made it with old fashioned green bean casserole, great combo! Will try with some potatoes next time.

With the mayo and cheese, it came out greasy. Maybe melting the butter in a sauce pan over low heat and whisking in a bit of flour, add the cheese while whisking pour over chops then bake this may work better....Just a thought.

I made this for our Thursday cooking class and it was a hit!  I think it only took me less then 5 minutes to prepare and 35 minutes in the oven and they were perfect.  I marinated them in salt and pepper and garlic before I put the butter and mayo mixture on top.

Awesome! I sprinkled some "garlic and herb Mrs. Dash" on the mayo and butter. What flavor.

I really liked this recipe but my husband said it was not his favorite thing I ever cooked.  I was skeptical about the mayo, but it turned out wonderful.  I did as one of the other reviews said and mixed it with the butter first.  If it weren't for my husband, I would definately cook it again.

These pork chops were simple and easy to make.  They were very tasty but I would not recommand them if you are on a diet.

This was soooo good! I followed the rscipe pretty closely - except mixing the butter & mayo, as that seemed the easier thing to do. My husband said it was ok, but he is really picky, so "ok" is edible! I am going to make this again, but try substituting the mayo for ranch dressing next time (as some others suggested).

This was quick and easy!  I used (2) 1 1/2" thick chops and reduced the butter and mayo down to 3 tsp. of each.  I mixed them together as suggested, seasoned w/ salt/pepper and added some minced shallot. After brushing the mixture onto the chops, I added enough shredded cheese to cover and baked as directed.  They took a little longer to cook due to their thickness, but the topping had wonderful flavor and turned a nice golden brown.  I will definitely make these again using thinner chops or perhaps stuffing thick ones w/ the mixture and added extra to the top. Thanks for sharing, it's a perfect weeknight, get on the table quick entree.

Very tasty recipe.  I did what other reviewers suggested and combined the butter and mayo.  I also browned my chops first and increased baking time to 45-60 minutes (depending on the thickness of the chops).

I totally messed this up and it turned out WONDERFUL!  I must have read the recipe wrong, I put 4T of butter in instead of just 4t, but it still tasted so very good.  I almost melted the butter, mixed in the mayo then added all the seasonings to the butter/mayo blend and just spooned it over the chicken.  Oh and I used chicken because I didn't have any pork chops (although I could have sworn that I did, freezer must have eaten them). I'll totally be making this again. And maybe I'll even try doing it right :)

Thought this was good but next time will use less seasoning salt and minced garlic instead of powdered. As suggested, I mixed the mayo and butter to make it easier to spread on the chops. Pork chops did come out of the oven juicy!

These chops were good, but I thought the butter was a bit to much.  I will make again, but decrease the butter.  I used a little minced garlic instead of the dried parsley and it added a nice flavor.

These are just awsome! I followed the recipe to the T but sprinkled paprika on top of the cheese for nice color.I did go a bit lighter on the margerine and mayo.Very easy and very good! I think this would be good using BL/SL chicken too! Such a nice change!

I'm not sure if it was the recipe or my pork chops just being too thin.  They came out dry and so tiny that my guests laughed at how much they had shrunken down.  That was funny.  Regardless, the flavor was good and it went well with the pecan spinach side dish I also made from this website.  Next time, i'll use thicker boneless porkchops and even possibly chicken.

The flavor of these pork chops were okay. This recipe uses WAYYYY TOO much butter you have to drain the extra out. I would definately eat this is you are worried about fat.

I used this recipe on pork butt and it was still good. I also modified the recipe according to what I had on-hand. I sprinkled 1/8 tsp of salt on the meat, followed by some Garlic Plus seasoning, the margarine and garlic flavored mayonnaise. It turned out great - will definitely make it again.

It wasn't bad.  :)  I waited until the pork chops were almost done before I put the cheese on, so that it wouldn't burn.  I think that next time I will try something other than mayo, though.  Still, it was only slightly more tangy than I would have liked.
