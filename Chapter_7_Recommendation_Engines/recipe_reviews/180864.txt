This recipe was absolutely delicious. This is the first time making a scallop dish and it turned out great. Next time I would make one change, the baking time was too long and the scallops was overcooked. But in all a wondeful meal.

I usually cook scallops only 2 min. per side and questioned baking them for 15 min. as the recipe said but went ahead with the recipe because of the other reviews. Before I baked them I patted the scallops with paper towels so they were not wet and followed the recipe to the "T". I took them out of the oven after the first 15 min. and found they were stewing in juice. I removed them one by one with tongs and put them in the glaze for only a minute and I  found them to be way over cooked. I don't know what they would've been like if I baked them for another 15 to 20 min as the recipe said! We did not care for this recipe and will remove it from "My Recipe Box".

Veryyyyy good flavor!!  I cook scallops all the time and I will be using this recipe many more times!  I changed the oven temp to 350 since they cook very fast, and you do not want them overcooked.  I added another clove of garlic (love it!) and didn't quite add the full amount of Old Bay.  Already gave a copy to a friend!!

Cook's Tip:  Bay scallops can be substituted for sea scallops. If using smaller bay scallops, lower the baking time by about 10 to 15 min.

I don't know what I did wrong but my scallops were floating in liquid (not from the scallops themselves either). Not good. Lacking flavor.

This recipe is wonderful!  The only change I made was that I omitted the margarine and added 1 tablespoon of pure maple syrup instead.  I wrapped the scallops altogether in tinfoil and grilled for about ten minutes.  My guests loved them as did I!  Not one scallop left! Delish!

Absolutely delicious!  I would double the sauce recipe since you will definitely want more!  My brother-in-law doesn't even like scallops and he devoured his portion!

Too much honey flavor came through in the glaze, and not enough of *something* else.

Served with brown basmati and wild rice and French cut green beans.  Clos du Bois Riesling.  Did not create a glaze but stayed saucy instead.  Sauce good on the rice.

This came out pretty tasty with some adjustments. I used the same proportions of ingredients, but approximately tripled the sauce amount for use on a pound of scallops. I had large scallops, U10 (about the diameter of ping pong balls), and 15 minutes cook time was plenty. Instead of cooking the sauce in and hoping it would thicken, I spooned a little sauce over each for flavor, but let most of it simmer  On the stove for the 15 minutes. It thickened to a nice caramelish consistency, and I ladled these over the scallops when plating. I also added about 1/4 cup coconut milk that I needed to use up; it was a perfect complement to the other flavors. Not a spice combo I would have come up with on my own (especially cooking in the lemon juice!), thanks for sharing this recipe!

And anyone having liquid issues - most commercially sold scallops are injected with a solution to keep them from drying out, and this liquid is expelled during the cooking. The labels are supposed to disclose this. You can minimize this by draining them on a rack or small colander in the fridge overnight, then patting them dry before cooking.
