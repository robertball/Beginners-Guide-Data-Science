Although this recipe has potential, the chili powder is over powering and the results are a dry salad. I further investigated the recipe to find out that the submitters personal recipe only called for 1 teaspoon of chili powder which sounds right.

Very easy and fast recipe. I did an extra tablespoon of mayo as it seemed dry. Nicely spicy with 1 teaspoon chili powder, use less if you want something mild. I think a splash of lemon or lime juice next time may be good too.
