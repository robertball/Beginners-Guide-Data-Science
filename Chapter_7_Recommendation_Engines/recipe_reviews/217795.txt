Delicious and very simple.  Only difference, I used dry white wine instead of the sherry and a stick blender.  Great easy recipe.  Thanks!

do we use the asparagus that was set aside or save it for another purpose?  If so, when do we add it?

I make this same soup but for those who prefer a chunkier soup delete using the blender portion. It is terrific both ways and my hubby loves this recipe. If I could give this a 10 star I would.

Thank you for a nice easy recipe.  In an attempt to reduce the salt and the fat, I made some changes.  I used unsalted butter, low salt chicken stock, and low fat buttermilk instead of cream.  I will make this again.

This is a little thin for us as written.  But really nice flavor.  I used white onion instead of red and next time I would add about 2 Tablespoons of flour to the butter / onion - make a roux by cooking the flour in the butter and then adding the liquid.  I used a stick blender in the pot and reserved some of the thin asparagus tips as a garnish along with a little additional cream.  It makes for a beautiful presentation.

This recipe was okay.  It was very thin not at all a cream soup.  I choose not to add the heavy cream it simply didn't need the liquid and I didn't need the fat and calories.  Instead I added a little corn starch after the blender step and put it in the crock pot for about 4 hours.  The taste is bland and needs salt and pepper for sure.

a thickening agent

Very easy and tasty. I have made this recipe several times for family and office parties.  Never any left overs!  My advise is to use all the ingredients and follow the instructions, it's not that hard and it does make a difference!  Thank you for this great recipe!
