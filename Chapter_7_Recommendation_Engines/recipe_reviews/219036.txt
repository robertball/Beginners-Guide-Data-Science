These brownies are amazing!!! I've made them twice, and the second time around I forgot the cocoa powder, but having substituted half the zucchini for pears, they were still awesome! My advice: the darker the chocolate the better. I also only use about a total of 3/4 cup of sugar. Serve with raspberry coulis...to die for!

For a healthier version of brownies, these turned out pretty good. The only thing I did a little different was used Nestles Dark Chocolate and Mint morsels because thats all I had on hand, which gave it a nice Minty flavor and I also substituted about a 1/2 cup of applesauce for the vegetable oil. Other than that, they came out moist and more cake-like rather than a brownie texture, but still pretty good! :)

Made this today and despite my modifications they turned out moist and delicious. I will definitely make them again. Here's what I changed:

1. Used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (didn't have white whole-wheat).
2. Used 1 tablespoon flaxmeal with 3 tablespoons boiling water in place of egg whites (due to someone with egg allergy at my house).
3. Also used 1 tablespoon egg replacer mixed with 1 1/2 teaspoons warm water (again, due to egg allergy).
4. Didn't have enough chocolate chips (crazy, right!?) and had to use 4 ounces melted semi-sweet baking chocolate in place of 1/2 cup melted chocolate chips.

In spite of all of my tinkering they were a big hit and are a nice way to get zucchini into my preschooler and my husband without complaints. Husband and son both loved them.

These are delicious treat that your kiddos will love! (And you won't feel bad letting them eat them!) After making them the 1st time, I did make a couple modifications.  I pureed my zucchini, to keep it well hidden.  This loosened up the batter some.  I also baked them in a 9x13 pan and they turned out PERFECT!  My girls are begging for me to make more! :)

Way too grainy and dry. Would have been much better with white flour.

I just made these yesterday and I really like them!  The only thing I changed was to use one whole egg instead of two egg whites.  These brownies taste like a cross between zucchini bread and fudgy chocolate cake.  You can taste the zucchini just a little, but I love zucchini bread, so that was not a problem for me.  I had no problem using only whole wheat flour, either.  They are so rich, chocolatey, and moist that I kept going back for more!

These brownies are fabulous.  My new favorite!!  Don't panic when the batter turns very, very stiff after you add the flour.  It will loosen up dramatically when you add the zucchini.  Unfortunately, I did not have a 9x9 pan, so I used an 8X8.  Next time I'll use my 8x8 but increase baking time by about 5 mins to make the brownies a little firmer.  But this is a keeper -- serious dark chocolate moist brownie goodness.

Very good. I pur√©ed two small zucchini based on another review...which ended up to 1 cup.  I used 3/4 cup whole wheat and 1/4 cup white.  I used applesauce instead of oil.  Used semisweet instead of dark chocolate because that is all I had.  And topped it with 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  It came up to 147 cal each.  Very good---definitely cake like.  Somehow I would like to figure out how to be more fudge like since that it how I like my brownies---but nevertheless these are a keeper .  Thank you!

I used whole wheat pastry flour, which may be the same as the white whole wheat flour that is  called for in the recipe, and they turned out great.   The 30 minute baking time was too short for me; it took a little over 40 minutes.  They did 'fall' a little in the center of the pan as they cooled  but were both  moist and light, an unusual combination for a brownie, in my experience.  My wife has a favorite zucchini cake recipe that she has used for years, and she declared that these brownies tasted better.  I placed walnuts on top before baking them, and they truly were very tasty.

Holy delicious! While mine did turn out more cake like than a brownie, these are scrumptious! I used applesauce instead of oil and pureed my zucchini to give it more moisture. I used Nestle's Dark Cocoa as well. Honestly I would make this for a birthday cake without the chocolate chips on top and ice it! The only problem is I just ate a whole row myself! Thanks, this one is a keeper!

Well a house full of kids and they ate it up and none of them was the wiser...that says a lot! I didn't taste the zucchini in the recipe and it came out surprisingly moist.  The dark chocolate made it delicious. Certainly traditional brownies are tastier but this wasn't bad for a more nutrient-packed version.
