How nice to have a pasta dish that has no tomato sauce or cream sauce that makes a great accompaniment for other ingredients.  This was perfect as a nest for Texas Beer Boiled Shrimp.  I used angel hair pasta and cut the water back to just 1 tbs, which I added to 1 tbs lemon and lime juice and 1 tbs EVOO for 2 servings.  Cilantro isn't a favorite so I used basil instead and reduced the sage to a rounded tsp.  The possibilities are endless.  Thank you Ryan, this is a keeper!

This is a nice light pasta.  I used fresh parsley, lemon balm, and basil.  This would be really good reducing the water and adding a drizzle of olive oil.  Also, this would be good with a little added zing- maybe with a little sprinkle of parmesan.

Good, if your going to have it as a main meal may want to add some kind of meat. Next time I think I'm going to try that and only adding half a tablespoon of each herb.

I decided to try this recipe to go with some grilled trout and shrimp I made for dinner tonight. The seasonings mimicked those in my seafood, so I thought it'd be a nice accompaniment. I did change it a bit though.
I omitted the water completely and used about 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead. I used about 1 teaspoon of sage, half a tablespoon of parsley, half a teaspoon of white pepper, and a teaspoon of sea salt.
It was a refreshing change from the norm and the flavors did go really well with our fish. Definitely something I'll make again.

This was a nice light pasta. Great for lunch. I added chicken, got rid of almost all the water and used a pre-mixed Caribbean spice mix. Could've used a sprinkle of Parmesan.
