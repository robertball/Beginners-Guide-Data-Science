Great for busy family; easy prep with few ingredients. I broiled for last few minutes in oven to crisp n brown chicken. Also,  I poured off the juice into saucepan on stove on high heat, mixed 1/4c milk n 2T cornstarch in  small bowl, then added that once juice boiled. Boil until desired thickness of sauce, then pour over now-rested chicken.

I love recipes that are this delicious and require minimal time, effort and ingredients! I browned my chicken thighs on the stove with a bit of oil first, then poured the sauce over top and put in the oven for 25 min. I used 1 clove of minced garlic instead of powdered. Family loved it, even my picky 6 year old.

This was ok, not special or something I will add to my regular rotation made as written. The picture is misleading in that it shows a crispy skin and the recipe states skinless. The sauce was flavorful but runny, not sticky. Everybody ate it. No complaints, but no raves either. If I make it again, it will be with major changes that render it a different recipe.  BTW, why in the world are there so many reviews by folks who have not made the recipe? It skews the rating & is a disservice to fellow cooks who want to try it. I wish Allrecipes would screen & eliminate these reviews.

I thought the amount of honey & garlic powder  sounded like too much for six pieces of chicken so I changed it up a little. I browned the chicken first in 1 Tbls of olive oil in a cast-iron skillet, then I remove the chicken, added the butter, rosemary, 3 cloves of finely chopped garlic and 1/3 cup of honey to the pan,  stirred that around for a minute to combine, added the chicken back in and turned it in the sauce a few times  until it was well coated. Then I popped the skillet into the oven at 350° for 30 minutes. It came out moist, beautifully browned with a nice sticky coating and very tasty. I served it with some stir fried Asian style veggies and steamed rice. Very good dinner!

I made this using the recipe as directed, except I also added some lime juice to cut the sweetness down. I used chicken thighs with skin on and dipped them into the mixture and placed in a cast iron skillet. I then poured the sauce over the thighs. I baked at 375 for 45 minutes because the thighs were large and then broiled for a few minutes until the skin was crispy.

Simple and delicious! Wasn't sure if I was supposed to use fresh or dried rosemary (doesn't specify), so I used dried (a little less than called for, b/c like I said, I wasn't sure) and that worked out great. The whole family enjoyed this. I used some skinless legs too for the kids. A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

So good!  I followed the instructions as written, but with 5 skinless chicken breasts.  Turned out wonderful over a bed of steamed rice!

The five stars are for the ease of the recipe.
The next is the end results  of everyone loved it. Even my picky chicken eaters(those breast people)loved it; so I knew I had a hit. Will be doing it again,thanks.

I made this dish and it was great. I made it with a couple of changes, first I mixed the butter, salt, pepper, garlic powder and added additional seasoning like sazon, adobo & parsley after these sizzled I added the honey and dipped the chicken breast. I then cut up potatoes and boiled some green beans and added them to the same pan then poured the remaining mixture onto everything in the pan let it cook at 400 for an hour and a half.

I loved this recipe- I had on hand all the ingredients and only had to get the chicken!  The only advice I have is to cook the chicken at a little lower temperature for a longer amount of time so that it's well cooked- tasted great!!

I thought this was incredibly yummy. I didn't have any rosemary so I had to substitute thyme for it, otherwise I followed the recipe as written. I used dried since it didn't say what kind to use. It had a delicious sweetness to it due to the honey, however, I couldn't taste the garlic at all. I definitely plan on making it again but I would add a clove or two of crushed garlic instead to give it a stronger garlic flavor. I followed another reviewer's suggestion by making a sauce with the leftover juices with a milk and cornstarch mixture. To die for fantastic!

I made this tonight and it was delish! I browned the chicken first and I didn’t have any rosemary on hand so I substituted with Thyme and it turned out great. I think next time I’d add some fresh garlic to the mix but all in all it was very tasty.

This was sooo yummy. Perfect timing for tenderness and sauce was delish also served on a bed of brown rice. Wish I had rosemary but thyme worked well as a substitute. Great recipe.

Super fast and yummy weeknight dinner.  Chicken was very moist.  I will probably use fresh garlic next time instead of garlic powder just for a better flavor. Served it with rice.  The kids gobbled it up.

Sticky savory sweet chicken! Turned out so well and it was a hit with the family. Will make this again for sure. We smoked our chicken first with hickory before finishing off with the yummy glaze in the oven.

Delicious!  I took the skin off the thighs, made the sauce around noon, let it cool completely then poured it over and under the chicken in the pan.  Let it sit in the refrigerator until an hour before baking  and took it out to warm up. After turning the chicken over, baked as directed.  Poured the sauce into a gravy boat and served it with rice.  Clean plates all around.

This was delicious. I used  fresh rosemary and garlic (micro-planed it) and a little bit of granulated garlic. I also used bone-in and skin thighs, seasoned with salt and pepper,  browned them first, and poured the sauce over it, basting a couple of times while in the oven. Served with mustard greens and wild rice with mushrooms.

This came out pretty good. I followed the recipe as written. The only modifications I did was adding 1 tsp of dried rosemary instead of 2 tsp and I added 2 TBSP of minced garlic instead of the 1.5 TBSP of powdered garlic. I thickened up the left over juice with milk and cornstarch (eye ball how much to put in otherwise the juice will get too thick)

I used chicken breasts so it took a bit longer but it turned out fantastic. I cranked up the oven to 400 for the last five minutes to crisp up everything and caramelize the honey. definetely going in the rotation.

Followed the recipe as is and it turned out great! My chicken was nicely baked (golden brown with some nice “charred”) spots on the chicken when I baked it.  I didn’t take any photo but next time I will. I saw this receipe and last minute decided to make it.  The chicken had a nice flavour to it.

Too sweet and too much rosemary for my taste.  I would make it again reducing those ingredients.

Used garlic salt and so I didn’t use the regular salt. Didn’t have only Rosemary, but had a blend with garlic that worked wonderfully with it. Cooked boneless, skinless chicken breasts in this sauce and then, used the liquid to create a glaze. I loved it!

I doubled the ingredients for 10 thighs but realized I needed less butter and honey when it was all said and done.  The sauce needed to be thicker.  Could have reduced it some but feared it may get a burned taste.  I'll tweak it for our liking.  It turned out wonderful and yes we'll make it again......maybe this week.

We loved this! I substituted the thighs for boneless skinless chicken breast, and paired it with "Asparagus and Cashews" here on all recipes by Shelly Domke. The chicken did take an extra 15-20 minutes to fully cook. We served this all over some steamed white rice. Delicious! We'll definitely make this again!

I tried this and thought it tasted pretty good and my Fiancé enjoyed it as well.  I decided to leave the skins on, and went with 4 tbs unsalted butter simply because it would have been more effort to cut off 1 tbs of the 4 tbs stick of butter.  I also left off adding any salt or pepper.

I used bone-in thighs with skin and baked them for an additional 15 minutes.  The chicken browned nicely like the photo.  I plan to reduce the sauce by half next time.

My husband enjoyed this, but the rest of the family thought it was just so-so.  The sauce never thickened, which was disappointing.  It does help to put the dish under the broiler for a few minutes at the end.

My husband and daughter really liked this and I did have high hopes for it because of all of the good reviews, but I just thought it was too sweet. Maybe reduce the amount of honey and figure out something to add to reduce the sweetness?

Love this recipe! Easy and very adaptable. My husband has high blood pressure so I omitted the salt altogether. Instead of rosemary I use club house garlic plus herb blend. I also sear the oieces of chicken in the saucepan before transferring to the oven to bake. Great flavor. And because I sear it, it does look like the photo above.

This may be my absolute favorite recipe so far on this site. I have made it quite a few times with my own tweaks. I don't like rosemary, so I stick to butter, fresh grated garlic, honey, and salt and pepper. I use bone in/skin on thighs and season skinless side with garlic/onion powder and salt and pepper on both sides. Like other reviewers, I also brown the skin before it goes in the oven and then thicken the sauce on the stove with some corn starch. I just make it to my own tastes and it is wonderful

Quick and easy to make! I used 4 chicken thighs rather than 6 and used just a little less rosemary than directed as it was my first time using it. Turned our pretty well, I put the oven on broil to get the skin crispy. No complaints, but not a roaring favorite. Will surely make again because I did love how quick and easy it was to make.

A little disappointing.  The bake time was off (it required an additional 15 minutes) and it was on the bland side.  The chicken should be seasoned directly, in addition to the sauce.

I don't know if it was the honey I used, but the honey flavor was overpowering and you couldn't even taste the garlic powder or rosemary. There are other similar recipes on this site that I will make instead next time.

I didn't have any fresh or dried rosemary, so I used the pure essential oil of rosemary by Young Living in the sauteed butter with minced garlic instead of the powder form. I also added half of a medium sweet onion lightly chopped to the mixture. It is great with brown rice and quinoa to accompany it.

AMAZING. As you can see I gave this 5 Stars. The recipe is SUPER easy. The only thing I would adjust is the fresh rosemary. It’s a little overpowering.

Better than other honey chicken recipes, but things never come together like I think it should. There really wasn't much "glaze" over the chicken, which is what I'm looking for. Also the rosemary is a distraction from the chicken unless you can grind it up some 1st.  The only change I made was to add more honey as other suggested & I used chicken breasts instead of thighs (personal preference). Won't make again.

Very easy to make but plain tasting. I’d recommend marinating it in the mixture for a couple hours before baking.

My husband loved it.  I did as one reviewer suggested and put the chicken under the broiler to brown a little.  Put the sauce in a pan while the chicken was under the broiler and mixed 1/4 cup milk and a little corn starch and added it to the sauce to make a thick gravy.

Love it! Just the way it is. To make it a little healthier the second time, I used olive oil instead of butter, and reduced amount of honey.

The flavor of this dish was really, really satisfying. I'd make this for guests. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, so I cooked them for about 22 minutes at 425 degrees. I have changes I'll try for the next time I use this recipe. I'll grind the rosemary with my mortar and pestle; I used dried spices and it was still too much like little toothpicks, even after the brief pan simmer/boil and the 22 minutes in the oven. In addition, there was too much liquid produced. I'd cut both the amounts of butter and honey.  Again, the taste was wonderful. Will definitely make again.

This was pretty simple to do. I thought that the amount of "sauce" made could have been more so I added extra honey, butter, and seasoning to my sauce. I put my oven on broil for the last few minutes to add some color and I think it turned out well.

It was OK, I'm not a big fan of just Rosemary, and I think I'll use fresh garlic next time as the powder didn't impart that much flavor, and maybe experiment with using Basil to bring out the sweet just a bit. Make sure you use a good quality honey. Over all it was worth checking out.

I made this recipe as written. I used dried rosemary and bone less thighs because I didn't read the instructions before making my grocery list. We ended up inviting a friend over for dinner last minute. Everyone really enjoyed this dish, and it was easy for a weeknight meal. We will make this again.

Very easy recipe which came out delicious.  Broiled the chicken for a few minutes at the end and thickened the sauce at the end my combining  1/4 cup of milk and 2 tbs of corn starch.  Heated the remaining juice from the pan in a small saucepan and added the milk and cornstarch and heated until thickened.  Will definitely be making this again!

Made this for tonight's supper. Followed the recipe to the letter but was disappointed in the result. The chicken was very sweet for my tastes and lacking in depth of flavor. I could probably tweak it but not worth the effort. I doubt I  will make again.

So good! followed directions to the T except at the end I broiled them for 1-2 mins to get the skin crisper. the sweetness of the honey with the rosemary came together beautifully :)

Made this 3 times . It was okay but,was not where close to picture. So the third time I made some changes . First  of all 30 minutes is not enough ( baked for one hour ). Then took chicken out and then left pan with sauce in the oven to boil down and that's when the honey started to caramelize and then i poured over chicken .

Why dirty 2 pans , just use your cast iron skillet. Nothing special about this dish. Good, but wouldn’t make again.

This was delicious!   I was worried that it would be too sweet, but it wasn’t.   Followed the recipe as written except, as others suggestioned, I crisped the skin under the broiler at the end of the cooking time.   My only other change,  I soaked the chicken in a simple brine for about 2 hours first.   The chicken came out so juicy, tender and flavorful.  My cooking time was longer than suggested in the recipe. It was more like 45 minutes for me.   However I do live in higher altitude which is probably a factor.  I definitely will be making this recipe again.

Tonight i decided to make this recipe and follow it exactly as instructed.  Did not fail!  Very flavorful, so good, moist.  Definitely will be making this again.   Even our kids approved.  ****In response to a comment about the chicken not being crisp:  Raise your heat to 450 for 10 mins.  That's what I did for crispy skin.

This came out really well followed all directions however made with skinless boneless chicken breasts instead. the sauce really can be used on any chicken you are baking in the oven. definitely make sure to add salt and pepper to cut into the sweetness. We used dried rosemary.

So I usually don’t EVER follow recipes without at least tweaking things a little but this time I followed the recipe exactly as is and it turned out so amazing!!! Seriously you don’t need to change anything it’s delicious, juicy and full of flavor! This is now the second time I’ve made it and I’m sure I’ll be adding it to the usual monthly or even weekly menu, so that I found this one! Definitely use fresh rosemary if you have it I’m sure it makes all the difference.

My kids loved it. I want to make it again just as it is here but the way I made it was baked with potatoes and then I made a gravy from the juices.

This is called a quick and easy recipe, and so it is, with a delicious sauce that is not too heavy on the rosemary. The recipe recommends chicken thighs, which I don't like, but if you choose another cut, make sure it is still on the bone to keep the meat tender. I would not change anything else. Yum.

Good idea to reduce honey sauce towards the end and let it broil afterwards to get a bit crispy.

One of the best i’ve made. Used less honey because my significant other doesn’t like it a lot. He loved this chicken so much he wants me to make it again tomorrow. We paired this with a potato medley seasoned with pepper, salt, and rosemary. Perfect.

Hmmm, it turned out too sweet for me, too much honey and not enough substance to the flavor. It’s probably my fault by not adding enough garlic powder. I thought maybe it would taste better with some fresh garlic, I only used 1 tbl spoon powder instead of the 1 and 1/2.

I did make this. Easy dinner great results. As a few suggested I did brown the chicken prior. I dipped it in egg then flour then browned.  I also always put a few sliced onion under the chicken when backing.  Helps to keep it moist.  I did use fresh oregano and added a touch of Dijon.  Yummy. Used fresh thick breasts

Will definitely make this again! Didn’t make any changes other than baking about 10 minutes longer. Went together very fast. So tasty! Great weeknight dish when you are short on time. Or, would be excellent for a large number of guests.
   Had ours with rice and asparagus.

The thighs were so moist and tender and the flavor was great.  I will make them again but use more garlic because the sweetness from the honey masked the garlic flavor and we do love garlic!

Fixed it just as recipe calls for except for rosemary, which we don’t like. Substituted clinatro.  Served with a mixed veggie mix with mini bow tie pasta from Schwanns. Yummy.

This was an easy and quick chicken dish. The only thing I changed was to broil for 5 minutes at the end to crisp and brown the skin. I poured the juices over the chicken just before serving 
This is now in our dinner rotation!!! Highly recommend!!

I made it exactly like recipe stated with 6 skinless chicken thighs even though photo shows skins on.   My family did not like it at all.  The 3 chicken thighs left over went in the trash.

I change the chicken to 4 boneless skinless breast cut into smaller pieces, so that I ended up with 12 "chicken tenders".  And I did not have Rosemary, so used Thyme instead.  Family loved it!!  and I did, too, because of how tasty it was, but mostly because how easy it was to make!!

In an effort to use meat that I already had , I used chicken leg quarters. I feel it turned out really well, however, I wil follow it step by step and use the chicken called for just to see the difference.  Otherwise was pleasantly pleased with how the meal turned out .

My family really enjoyed this. It was so easy to prepare and the sauce was yummy! I served it with angel hair pasta but brown rice would have been good too.

This was good and very easy to prepare. Added a little lime juice in the honey mixture and poured the sauce over the chicken instead of dipping each piece.

Super easy to make as written. Very tasty - hubby asked for it to go into the rotation. He has declared that it may now be in his top 3 favorite meals.

I made this recipe as shown but next time I will try a bit less honey. A little bit sweet for my taste but still very good.
I melted the ingredients in a large Scanpan which is oven safe. I placed the chicken thighs directly into the pan and put the pan in the oven for 35 minutes. I basted the thighs a couple times during baking so that they browned up a bit. Using only one pan is perfect! Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe for the sauce, except I added some fresh garlic. I chopped up chicken breast, cooked it on a skillet until fully cooked & browned. Added the chicken to the sauce and served with rice, green beans & sliced water chestnuts. Wonderful!!!

This was a great recipe. It was easy to complete and tasted terrific. I will definitely be making this one again!The only change (if you could call it that)  I made was using boneless, skinless thighs as my family doesn’t like to mess around with them.

This looks tasty- but I would recommend adding crushed cloves of garlic and a liberal amount of tamari. Look for the real deal if you’re not already acquainted. Noting at all like the caramel colored salt water most people know as soy sauce.
Place all in a heavy duty plastic bag-at least overnight. Especially important if you plan on grilling outside.

Delicious!  Added onion powder and paprika, personal preference. Chicken was moist and had just the right blend of honey and rosemary. We’ll make it again.

simple to make and family really enjoyed!!! I cooked one clove of garlic in the butter and only added 1/2 tablespoon of garlic powder. I also added some onion powder and marojam.
