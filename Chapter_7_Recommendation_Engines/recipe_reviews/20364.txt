I made the recipe with two changes. Only one tbsp of flour and then added one box of cook and serve vanilla pudding.  This thickened the pie a little more!  AWESOME!

The term "Chess Pie" is not easy to find even on the web where you can find almost anything. It is nice to find that there still some of the "Old" way of doing things left in this world.
                  Thank You.

This was very tasty.  I used a 20 oz can of pineapple and a little extra coconut, and it was a little too sweet. So if I were to use extra pineapple and coconut next time I would cut back on the sugar... honestly it is probably better just as written.  It was also too much filling for a regular crust, I should have used a deep dish.  I think the mixture would be good on top of a sweetened cream cheese base to make tropical bar cookies too, yum!

I made this for our very last summer BBQ and every crumb was eaten!  I didn't have a big enough tin of pineapple, so I made it up with canned peaches - even more delicious.  A definite five-star pie!

My husband loves using this recipe! He made 4 of these for Christmas last year and everyone loved them. The only change we made was to substitute Splenda for sugar. The flavors and consistency are melt in your mouth good!

This was delicious! I doubled the recipe as written and filled 2 deep dish pie shells. There was some batter left over, so it probably would have filled 3 regular shells. The consistency is like a thick custard and the coconut bakes perfectly with the pineapple. Ppl were asking for the recipe!

I have made this pie several times before, but lost my original recipe. I thought that the pineapples were left undrained and I used less cornmeal and flour, but I followed this recipe, with the exception of using 20 Oz can of pineapple and extra coconut. I found it to be too dry once removing from the oven. So, I took the reserved pineapple juice and cooked it with a pat of butter in saucepan and then brush it onto the pies. This made them much moisturer. Hope they will taste like my old recipe. Rosa

This was a great recipe and if I'd had all the exact ingredients, I'd not have changed anything. I didn't have crushed pineapple, but a 20 oz can of pineapple rings. I crushed these in a blender and cut the sugar to 1 cup only since I used more pineapple than called for. Baked in a deep dish and covered for the last 10 min. to keep from over browning. Cooled and placed in fridge for a few hours. Texture was great and pie was perfectly sweetened. Thanks!

This is NOT the pineapple chess pie. I used this recipe as base and created my own. I added 1tsp apple cider vinegar, 1.5 quarts of strawberries(sliced,crushed, drained) I added about half cup confectioners sugar to berries and chilled  for about 6 hours. I also added juice and zest from 1 lemon. I made a homemade all butter flaky crust and waited for the oven timer to okay my taste test. 50minutes at 350, cover and 35-40minuted to complete. AMAZING

I modified the recipe by adding 1/2 tsp of rum extract, 1/4 tsp of Orange extract and 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract. Very light and tasty. I plan to increase the rum extract to 1 tsp the next time I bake this pie.

Made this birthday "pie" tonight for my girlfriend's b-day. She loved it!  Didn't change the recipe at all and it was great.

It was lovely but slightly too sweet. Maybe because I used a fresh pineapple, not the canned one. Also 4 eggs seemed too many so I only used 2 eggs which worked just fine. I had also shortened the cooking time to 45 mins and then 30 mins. My family just loved it!

This is a great recipe.  I changed a few things, I substituted coconut oil for butter and increased the amount.  I used coconut flour to thicken instead of regular flour and I used fresh pineapple instead of tinned.  Very good, would definitely make again!

My family liked this. A little custard like you might say. I used unsweetened coconut, just to be specific! I forgot to cover with foil the last 20 minutes and it turned out fine. I made homemade crust, though, so it was a little thicker. May be why it didn't over brown. Thanks a lot for this recipe!

This was just OK. It wasn't anything special...just pineapple and coconut together in flavor and texture. I think it would taste better with a sweeter crust like grahm or as a cookie with some type of crumble topping.
