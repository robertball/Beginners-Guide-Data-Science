It was a great recipe but I have to admit I made some changes. I added a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup and 2 sm cans of mushrooms. I added a Tbs of Worcestershire sauce and 2 beef bouillon cubes. I omitted the tomato paste because my hubby and son do not like tomato based sauce. I kept everything else the same. lt came out delicious! You'd never know it wasn't made with sour cream. It has the same "tangy" taste but even better. Thanks!

Wonderful! I did make changes to suit food in my fridge: Sliced an elk steak left from a previous dinner in place of sirloin, used grape tomatoes sliced in half in place of tomato paste, did not add lemon juice or milk.  Served this over spaghetti squash,  although noodles would also have been yummy.

I've made this a few times now though I've altered it a bit and omited the white wine and the seasoned salt, doubled the recipe. Added a bit more tomato paste and put it over egg noodles.

Tonight I decided to throw this together with chicken following the recipe aside from I do omit the wine and used chicken bouillon instead of the beef. FANTASTIC.  I imagine tossing some spinach into this would be heaven. Might do that next time!

It was on the tart/sour side, not sure if I would use the lemon juice again.

This is a good recipe with a few adjustments.  I used a can of cream of mushroom soup as many other reviewers mentioned. I also don't drink so I didn't have any white wine and I didn't see any need for the cornstarch and didn't want to open a can of tomato paste for just two tablespoons. 
It makes a huge amount, so there will be leftovers for a couple days!

Made this tonight and it was yummy. I didn't have the wine,  cornstarch or mushrooms but it was still good. I used leftover dark chicken. I agree that the lemon is not needed.

A great way to use leftover steak! Two issues: one, it was too dry so I followed someone else's suggestion to add a can of mushroom soup. I also added 1/2-3/4 cup milk. Two, the smokiness was too strong for me. Next time I will cut the smoked paprika in half.

Very tasty!!  I may add some spinach next time and mix up a few ingredients but over all a great way to use some leftover London Broil!

I had high hopes for this recipe as I really like all of its ingredients on their own ; however it was much too rich for my taste.   Also, there is something about mixing milk and wine that just doesn't seem right, but I still made it as it was written.  It was way too thick after adding the steak so I kept adding milk to thin it out but the consistency  would not change.  I even tried adding more wine, but it was still way too thick.  Unfortunately this is not a recipe that I will be making again.  Thanks for sharing though.  Others may enjoy this if they like rich tasting foods.

My kid has gotten into the picky eater phase and he liked this, he even ate the mushrooms and he's been against them lately.  We used ground pork instead of steak because I needed to use it up but I bet it would taste just as good.  I did use the whole 6 oz can of tomato paste only because I'm not making anything else in the near future and didn't want it to go to waste.

We didn't think it was tarty or sour.  Next time I might add a few others things in as well though to make it more of a one dish meal...maybe some peas or broccoli...
