Perfect as written just be sure to let the chicken marinade overnight for best results.

AMAZING!!! This is the best marinade for chicken that I have come across, and I have been searching a long time!  The first time I made this I marinated it for a mere 6 hours and it still blew my family away. Now, I marinate it overnight for a flavor explosion the next day. It’s a simple and quick recipe to put together at night before you go to bed. I made no changes. I stuck with the original recipe. My only suggestion: DOUBLE the recipe. You’ll want leftovers to add to a salad later on in the week!

Fantastic! Made it exactly as written. Turned out amazing! My extremely picky 14 year old loved it and had seconds!
