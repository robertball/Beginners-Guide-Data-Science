I was looking for a good filling to fill my Dark Chocolate cake with.  This was the best ever.  Good in the cake, good all by itself.  A big hit at my family function.!!!  A keeper!!  
Thank you Carol for sharing :)
9/01/07  I also wanted to add that when I go to events THIS is the most requested dessert for me to bring.
1/24/11  Another update:  This is still the most requested desert.  I follow the recipe to a T.  I do have to whip it again before I use it.  I think it has great flavor.  Enjoy.  It is worth the bother!

Normally I hate it when people review recipes after they make a bunch of changes, but it just turned out so good that I decided to go ahead. I decided to try and make it more carb friendly and so I used splenda for baking instead of sugar and half and half instead of milk. I followed the rest of the directions to a T and was very impressed with the final product. The only thing is, I was expecting it to be more pudding like, and when I added the whipped cream it turned out more like, well, whipped cream. I tasted it before I added the whipped cream and it was amazing. This could be used in boston cream pie or as pudding if it is made without the whipped cream. It could be used for cream puffs or other pastries as is. My lower carb version turned out fabulous. I give this recipe an A+.

This is very creamy, and very rich, only let kids eat small amounts.  My only problem was deciding what to do with it once I had made it, I made it for Food Tech class.  We had to make a dessert that had to be frozen and I chose this, it made like 4 cups and afterwards I didn't know what to do with it.

To someone that has never made custard of any kind before, this recipe is slightly confusing.  I have made this twice.  The first time, I followed all directions and ingredients exactly.  I believe I overcooked the custard because I was using a plastic spoon, not a metal one.  It is difficult to tell when the mixture coats the spoon, so metal works best.  Overcooking resulted in the yolk of the egg scrambling.  The second mistake I made was with the straining.  The recipe does not indicate which portion to keep when straining and because my egg cooked I had a significant amount in the strainer as well as in the bowl under it.  I did not know which part to keep and I believe I used the wrong part of the custard for the remainder of the recipe.  My end result was very little flavor and bits of solid pieces in my Bavarian Cream.  However, the second time that I made it with the metal spoon, I took the mixture off the stove as soon as the back was becoming coated.  I strained it and it became obvious that the portion to keep is the liquid that comes out of the strainer.  I used this to complete the recipe and it turned out beautifully.  We used the Bavarian Cream to make delicious filled homemade donuts for breakfast.  Probably a novice mistake overall, but I feel the author should have indicated exactly what to do after straining the mixture.

i thought this was very yummy, and very easy to make.  It was very thin when I finished folding in the whipped cream, buy if you let it chill for ten minutes, it is perfect.  If you are filling a cake with it, just make sure to make a dam with the buttercream so that it won't sqeeze out the sides.  Also, I know this recipe says you can eat it as pudding, but I wouldn't, and I would never let my kids. It is full of fat with all that heavy cream and sugar.

Disappointing. I was hoping for more of a pudding taste to it, and it isn't. It has the taste of the whipping cream rather than a vanilla flavor. I will not be making this again.

This recipe called for ingredients I don't normally have around the house, which would be okay if the taste was worth it. Unfortunately, the description is accurate when it calls the cream "light," since it was nearly tasteless... the gelatin somehow ended up really chunky, and the overall texture of the cream was less than pleasant... also, if you do choose to use this, be sure to stir constantly when boiling the milk, I seared the bottom of my pan by accident. 

I had to add extra sugar and vanilla to this to make it taste somewhat decent, but decided it would ruin my cake if I were to use it for a filling, and it didn't taste good enough on its own. It could be that I did something wrong, but I reviewed the recipe again after I was finished to make sure I did everything right and... well the result just wasn't very good at all. :(

I personally was not impressed.  I used this recipe for the filling for a 50th birthday cake.  Not one comment was made on the filling.  
This was not my idea of Bavarian Cream.

This is the perfect Bavarian Cream.  If it doesn't turn out for you then you did something wrong.  This recipe does lack the tecniques needed to make the recipe turn out correctly.  I had to learn the techniques from a french chef at culinary school.  Hard to make, don't try it unless you know the different tecniques to get it to work correctly.

Tastes to much like whipping cream. Maybe it would be better if you used less cream.

I got this same recipe from my grandma, she made it in the form of a pie, with either a chocolate waffer crust or a graham cracker crust, and toped with grated dark chocolate. It requires a ton of patience. Its easiest to refrigerate the custard mixture the goal is you want it set up to a pudding thickness (But def not thicker than pudding). I usually refrigerate while whipping the cream, its usually just about perfect timing, sometimes it needs to chill a bit longer. After mixing with the cream it needs to chill for a good 2 hours before eating. (and it should definately have its own unique taste, not at all like whip cream)

Are you looking for "American Bavarian Cream"? This is the pudding like custard used to fill doughnuts...then look for vanilla pudding or crème pâtissière (pastry cream) recipes.

Meanwhile....

YUM! This is the real deal! I whipped this up and Great Grandma LOVED it. She said this reminded her of "the Old Country" and it started hours of conversation on childhood desserts. 
Very Tasty and fairly easy to make!

not at all what I think of when I think Bavarian cream. To runny to put directly in a cake layer and once it has cooled it sets so completely it doesn't spread nicely on the cake. very bland

This was amazing!  Just what I was looking for to fill my cupcakes with.  I followed the recipe to the T, except I used splenda as I was making it sugar free, and it turned out perfect and delicious.    Word of advice, when straining the milk/egg mixture use a small holed strainer or one of the meshy strainers.  Reason being the gelatin mixture has the little balls and if you use a regular strainer it leaves them in there making the mixture gritty.  You will have to take a fork to it to get the liquid out and will need to empty the strainer from the remnants from time to time.    If you want it to have a stronger taste, try adding more sugar and vanilla.    I will definitely be adding this to my collection.

***UPDATE at bottom***  Really disappointed.  Needed a cream filling/topping for a pastry.  Followed to a T and when "folded" in the whipped cream it just melted into the mixture.  Nothing more than a thin cream soup.  Had no time to remedy anything.  Had to buy whipped cream.  Bad experience. *UPDATE* The directions need to state that mixture must go in fridge for several hours or overnight.  The recipe time states ready in 55 min which is misleading.  I have to now agree with some that it is a little bland and tastes more like over glorified whip cream.  I was looking for a creamy pudding like cream topping/filling.

This recipe is a keeper for me. I followed it to the letter with no substitutions and it is wonderful. I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews that stated it did not thicken and was too thin for use as a filling. Well, with two tablespoons of gelatin I was confused as to how this could happen. I'm glad I tried it out for myself! Within 1 1/2 hours after putting the Bavarian Cream in the fridge, it was the perfect consistency for filling. I plan on using this to fill some coconut cupcakes for a birthday dinner. Yum!

Too much time for something not so great. This had a consistency very different from what I am used to with bavarian cream. It was a little too gelatin-y. It didn't have the right thickness and I thought it was pretty difficult to make. My family really liked it, but I won't ever make it again.

Unfortunately this did not work for me.  I reread the directions and didn't seem to do anything wrong but it was liquid when I was done.  Waste of time and money on ingredients.

I made a 4 layer devils food cake with whipped icing and bavarian cream for my sister's birthday.  The bavarian cream itself was awesome.  Good flavor and the directions were easy to follow.  However, it oozes really bad.  I noticed after cutting the cake that the cream did not ooze.  My suggestion is to make the cake, add the bavarian cream and put it in the fridge.  It will ooze but then you can scrape to drips off and still successfully make a pretty cake.  I did not do this so the decorating was kind of crappy but it still tasted good!

Tasted very good by itself before I refrigerated it.  I used it as a middle layer for daughter's Bavarian cream cake.  The flavor of the chocolate completely drowned out the Bavarian cream.  Also, daughter loves Bavarian cream doughnuts and expected this to be same which it isn't.  The cream doesn't flow (she called it "gelatinous") and I guess the texture isn't the same.  Still, it wasn't all bad.  I actually refrigerated it in a cake pan, dipped it in warm water to release it and made it a middle layer between two yellow cake layers.  When I put the top layer on the B. cream kind of oozed out a little, but held firm.  Interesting stuff, not the greatest taste treat.

Very good for a pudding-like cake filling, it did what I needed it to do. However, I was looking for a good bavarian cream, as I was trying to replicate a cake from our town's finest European bakery (anyone from Kalamazoo should know who I am talking about!)for my mother's birthday. This turned out more like thickened, almost jelly-like, whipped topping, no bavarian cream taste here. I wanted a true, bavarian cream filling and this just did not have the taste. May have been better with a pudding base instead of the whipping cream.

In my earlier review, I forgot to say that I substituted Splenda for sugar.  I added a few slivered almonds the last time    This recipe is absolutely wonderful as written!! It can, also, be manipulated a lot and is still delicious.  Thank you SO much for sharing it!!!!

Like some of the other reviewers stated, It was a little too much like whipped cream for me. I guess I was expecting more of a custard. It was a good flavor and still tasted great in the banana cake I made, but I will probably try to find a more custard like recipe next time.

Wasn't quite the type of Bavarian Creme I was expecting, but it turned out well all the same. The recipe made way more than what I needed to fill a cake. It does have a vanilla pudding/custard taste but for the "quick and easy" version, not bad.

I'm Bummed.  The Cream did not thicken at all.  I followed the directions perfectly and even used whole milk  in the cooking process.  I don't understand what happened.  I can't recomment this recipe.

The Author should have told which part to keep after straining. This didn't work out the first time because I didn't know which to use the liquid or other. This came out more liquid than I was expecting. I followed the directions then looked up different ones on youtube and it said to mix the gelatin with the mix before you strain it not after and that worked better than the other time.

As a pro chef   And I used to make this regularly some 25 years ago. Forgetting how it was done I refer to this recipe it is exactly what I've been taught from me French chef.
 For those who have trouble don't don't don't overheat  your custard .  And if it comes out then your problem is in the folding cream .  As always Bon appétit

It was very fluffy. Not very sweet but that's okay. I used it in a trifle with strawberries and angle food cake. I don't like pudding so this was something good it was a little thicker.

This is the best filling ever! My family loved it with a dark chocolate cake. They loved it all by itself! Will make this again.

This would not support any type of cake as a filling. It splattered everywhere when trying to eat it in eclairs. Taste was very bland even after adding more vanilla. Not a keeper.
