Excellent dessert/ snack ! Best chilled as recommended. Tastes like a small moist brownie! 
I recently started eating vegan for health reasons. This is a wonderful healthy option. I left out the coconut and still delicious! Even my picky friends loved it! I toasted my almonds, a personal preference . 
Enjoy!
