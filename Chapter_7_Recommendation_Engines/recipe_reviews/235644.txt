So easy yet so Delish!  I used 2 cans of Kirkland chunky white chicken breast meat and in place of the water, I used milk.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for another great recipe!

I made this as the recipe was written, with the exception of using my own leftover mashed potatoes rather than instant.  I think next time I'll add a little salt and perhaps a dash garlic powder. The family loved it!
