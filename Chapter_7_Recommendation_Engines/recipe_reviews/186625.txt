Ohhh my...this was delicious!! I doubled the amount of shrimp and dressing...but only used 1 1/2tblspns of cajun seasoning total..I thought this had enought kick. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added the zest of one of the limes for more lime-y flavor. They are excellent! Served with Tangy Cucumber and Avocado Salad from this site. Thanks!!

This was a great recipe for shrimp. I tried it and it was very good. I also tried it on chicken wings with a dab of tequila,and marinated it overnight in the 'fridge and baked them the next day as an appetizer for friends. Now that was awesome!! Gimme lime anytime!

Make sure you use a Cajun seasoning you like, since they vary so much in both heat and flavor! Then, add it to taste, and not necessarily as much as the recipe calls for and you will have a dish tailored specifically to your liking.  Similarly with the lime juice - while we used considerably less Cajun seasoning than called for and were happy with that, we used the amount of lime juice called for (and it was a good sized lime!), found it wasn't "limey" enough for our liking and squeezed extra on afterward.  Hubby just broiled these rather than grilling them, a few minutes on each side. We used these to top "Lemon Vinaigrette Salad," also from this site.

I used Old Bay seasoning instead of the Cajun seasoning.  Old Bay really made it spicy.  Good recipe though.  My husband loved it.

Great flavor!!  I marinaded for about 6 hours and threw them in a grill wok (meant for vegetables on the grill) and tossed them for about 6 minutes.  Turned out great!!  Will be repeating.

Good recipe however mine turned out WAY to salty. I used Tony Chachere's for my cajun seasoning, I'm sure it all depends on what cajun you use. I'll make again because it was very good, next time I'll just use maybe 1TBS of cajun seasoning.

Delicious, added some sea salt as my cajun spice mix had no salt.  Grilled on the stovetop.  Also grilled thick slices of red onions to go along.

We loved this! I added some cilantro to the marinade and toasted some corn tortillas and they were fantastic little shrimp tacos. I also topped with avocado and homemade pico de gallo. It was great!!

Fab!!!! Easy and tasty. Low carb, low fat, low calorie and tasty!!!!!! One thing though. I don't know what kind of plastic bags y'all are usin but my shrimp poked little holes in the bag (tails) If the tails are still on , use a plastic container. TX for the great recipe. Will make again and again!

As written with 3 T. Cajun seasoning, the shrimp is too hot to be edible--thus, the one star.  With the Cajun seasoning (less than 1 T.) just sprinkled over the shrimp, it is very good with a nice mild lime flavor.

This was so good.  I took the advice of other reviews and only used 1 T. of cajun seasoning.  It was plenty of spicy for us.  Everything else I kept the same.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a very good basic recipe, but you can't have shrimp without garlic! Saute 3-4 minced cloves in a little butter, cool, then add to the marinade - makes a world of difference.  Also sub olive oil for the vegetable oil, and add a little garlic powder. Note that if you use the full 3 tablespoons of Emeril's Essence, it WILL be hot! 1 tablespoon for the faint-hearted gives it excellent flavor, and just a good bite, but doesn't "burn" your mouth. If you really want to get creative, you can add spices such as marjoram and basil, but you will have to increase your marinating time.

I've used the Pampered Chef Jerk Rub and added a tsp of chopped garlic.  Great to throw in a wok with some vegies.  Quick to fix too!

Even though I love spicy food, this was too much seasoning. I would like to try it with jumbo shrimp and less quantity of seasoning.

Delicious and easy! Substituting Creole seasoning for the Cajun also works well. We grilled the shrimp on skewers and squeezed a lil lime juice on them after removing from the grill. My husband and I both really enjoy these.

An awesome recipe! 
I didn't put the shrimp on skewers, rather, cookd them right on the grill.   Only caution, use extra large shrimp or a griddle (with holes) ontop of your grill to prevent losing any.
Also, I used regular Cajun seasoning and then marinated for 4 hours.
Very tasty :)

Very easy to make and only takes a few minutes; I strongly recomment this! It isn't the best shrimp I've ever had, but considering how low in calories it is, I will certainly make this more often! Throw a few veggies on the grill and you have a very quick and healthy dinner!

Wow, I'm so disappointed.  I love cajun seasoning, but this was way too much!  I should have read the reviews.  Do yourself a favor and cut the cajun seasoning in half.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and still gave it 3 stars because I know this could be a really great, simple recipe with lots of flavor.  I will try it again, but with half the seasoning.

I used these on shrimp from Sam's Club. I think the key is to get the uncooked shrimp so they don't get too rubbery. Also, I used cajun spices and crushed red pepper. Didn't use fresh lime juice but these bad boys were good. They definitely had you fanning your mouth and reaching for your glass of water. Will make them again.

Loved this one and followed ingredients to the letter.  One BIG caveat, however: My version of this was incredibly salty!  I used the cajun seasoning I had on hand and it obviously had an enormous amount of salt in it which I didn't check first.  Those concerned with sodium levels need not try this dish.  In the meantime, I will look for alternatives to the cajun seasoning I used.  Over all, we like this a lot and I will make it again.

For me this was a great marinade. After reading a dozen or so reviews I reduced the cajun spice by half (Tony Z's) and added the zest from the juiced lime. I may have let the shrimp set too long as the lime juice began to "cook" the shrimp (ala ceviche) so I wont do that again .... but now that I have the marinade recipe I plan to use it for other thinks like flank steak and chicken!!! THANK YOU!!!

I did cut back on the seasoning ( I used My home-made Essense recipe ) to 1 Tbsp. and that was plenty, so you could still taste the Shrimp.  Olive Oil for a healthy option ,and I followed everything else in the recipe to a Tee.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star, is I feel that the flavor would be greatly inhanced with the addition of afew cloves of minced garlic to the marinade.  It was a bit "one note".
I served this with wild rice, sliced tomatoes and sweet peas.   I will certainly make this again and it was indeed easy to prepare.

These were seriously amazing. I did add more lime and cut the Cajun seasoning in half. I also don't have a grill so I sauteed them over the stove. Going to make these over and over and over.

Great spice. I think next time I'll add cilantro with would enhance the flavor profile. The bigger the shrimp the better too. I used petite b/c that was all I had and I wouldn't recommend doing that.

Really delish and so easy, eh? I added some finely minced fresh garlic.  Just love the grilled shrimp with an extra squeeze of lime after they're done!

Delicious shrimp! Just a tad salty and spicy for my taste but will tone down the seasoning next time. Thanks for a tasty recipe! :)

This tasted good but was VERY salty. I cut the Cajun seasoning in third based on other reviewers indicating that it was too salty. I used Tony Cachere's Cajun seasoning which I believe is the culprit here. I bet this recipe would be very good with a different Cajun seasoning. I will try it again with a different brand. I added two cloves of finely minced garlic to this which definitely gave it a very nice flavor. Overall, a very nice recipe - just use a different Cajun seasoning than I did.

Great recipe, only thing preventing five stars is the amount of cajun seasoning listed.  Its just too much.  Too spicy, too salty, too much everything and not in a good way.  

***USE 3 TEASPOONS CAJUN SEASONING*** 

If you use more your shrimp will be far too salty.  Add cayenne or even better, add crushed red pepper to add zing to your shrimp.  After they are grilled squeeze juice of half a lime over shrimp.  Amazing! :)

Sounds great but once grilled, we didn't taste the lovely marinade at all.  From my experience, it's more flavorful to grill them plain, then add the sauce AFTER grilling, no matter what the marinade is made of.

This is our favorite grilled shrimp recipe! The only thing I have changed is less seasoning for my husband, but I love it spicy.  This is quick, simple and FANTASTIC!  I usually make a few shrimp to grill when we have steak.  Otherwise, this shrimp served with cajun spiced rice is a great entree!

Like what most people reviewed, the brand of Cajun seasoning means a world of difference. I used Walmart's Fifth Seasoning brand and used only half of what was called for and it was still way, way too salty. I tasted the potential in this recipe though so I will try it again with only a third of what was called for.

Just add crushed red pepper when you serve it. It gives it a little kick. I marinated it for 45 minutes, and added the crushed red pepper, and it was definetly better than the first time i made this.

This didn't do it for me. I thought the cajun seasoning overwhelmed the shrimp. I made it just like the recipe except I only used 2T of cajun seasoning after reading reviews. I do not think I will make again.

Eh. This was "OK." Nothing special, IMHO. If I were awarding stars for ease of preparation, I'd definitely give this a 5. I am rating based on flavor, so I can only give 3. During the work week, I'm always on the lookout for quick-fix recipes. This was exactly what I was looking for. I pretty much followed Kim's directions to a T, except for two things - I decreased the cajun seasoning (Emeril's Essence) by 1 T and I marinated for 12 hours (put everything in a large Zip-lock bag before I left my house at 7 AM). When I got to work, I panicked thinking that I ruined dinner becasue either a) my shrimp would be too spicy due to sitting in the marinade all day or b) the lime juice would "cook" my shrimp (I've heard that you should only marinate seafood / acidic ingredients for 30 minutes MAX, but at the last minute, decided to try out this theory myself lol). Neither happened (thank God!). My fiance warmed the coals on our Weber just before I got home, so all I had to do was thread skewers, prepare our rice side dish (Zataran's garlic & herb), crack open a bag of tortilla chips and store-bought guacamole and mix up some frozen margaritas (yummm...)! Thanks for sharing this no-fuss meal idea, Kimmy. I'm not sure this will make a repeat at my house, but I'm glad to have given it a try nonetheless. At least we had a decent meal to fill our tummies! :)

I made this a few hours ago and it couldn't have been easier! My boyfriend had a steak with it and he loved it! My only problem was that it was kind of gritty still. Could be something I didn't do right. Regardless, this is now a go-to recipe for us! Thanks!

Excellent! I marinated for about 4hours with tue shells on and then ended up steaming them instead of grilling them. My husband loved!

made these last night and they were a big hit. Just enough of bite without being too spicy. And so easy to make, a great easy appetizer.

Yummy and very easy!  The only problem with the recipe was the grill time for the shrimp.  My shrimp was undercooked.  Needed at least 5 minutes per side.

Used a milder "Island Herb Mix" and still enjoyed.  Very easy.  Will repeat the lime juice/oil concept.

Excellent!  I used Emeril's Essence.  I also added a splash of tequila to the marinade, but I'm not sure that it made a difference.  We also added a squeeze of fresh lime to the shrimp after cooking. Yummy yummy yummy!

I loved the outcome of this recipe, but I have to say I didn't taste the lime really at all!  It was plenty spicy and extremely tasty, and I only used half a tablespoon of oil, which was enough...next time I might squeeze two limes or use lime zest as well like  a previous reviewer suggested.  All around great recipe though!

I have made this numerous times. I love it and everyone who tries it loves it. I am actually not a huge fan of non breaded shrimp, but with this recipe I am a huge fan. When I am not using the grill, I will throw them in a pan with a little olive oil and saute for about 30 seconds to a min and done.

The flavor wasn't bad but boy was it SALTY.  I highly recommend if you don't want to drink a gallon of water when you are done, to mix your own.  We served it with some chili sauce to offset the salt and heat with only 2TBS of mix....

It was super easy, quick and delicious. It is spicy, but my husband and I are fans of spicy foods, so I added a little cayenne pepper to kick up the heat. I served the shrimp over a bed of cajun rice. Man was it good. I suggest letting the shrimp marinate in the frige at least 1 hour prior to cooking.

This is awesome! I only used 1 1/2 TA of the cajun seasoning and it came out with the perfect kick.  Served over garlic rice.  Marinated for about 4 hours.  Husband who isn't the biggest shrimp eater loved this.  Will be making this a lot through out the summer.  Thanks for the recipe

I only used two heaping teaspoonfuls of cajun seasoning and that was plenty. It had just the right spice without being too spicy for my children. Loved it!

This was outstanding. I didnt have Cajun, so instead I combined Cayenne, black pepper, and a Roasted Garlic and Spice seasoning, also instead of Vegetable Oil, I used Olive Oil and I grilled it on stove top. This was delicious. It was spicey with a strong flavor of lime. Thumbs up! Will make again!

This was tasty, but I think I would add more oil and lime so that the marinade wasn't so pasty on the shrimp.  That was the only complaint my fiance had!

This was a great recipe.  Like some other reviewers, I used Old Bay seasoning instead of Cajun and only used half the amount called for, which was sufficient.  This was such a nice change from the usual way we grill shrimp.  Try the Tangy Cucumber and Avocado Salad recipe from this site with this shrimp.  It goes very well with it.

Enjoyed this a lot. I started with only 1-TBL of cajun spice and added from there. It is very spicy so I think it's better to add a little at a time to suit your taste.  Didn't have shrimp but wanted to try it, so I used it on salmon and it was very good.  It's also good on most any firm white fish.  Trying it on halibut steaks tonight.  I'll eventually get around to trying it on shrimp as well.

I'm not a "spicy" kind of person so I wasn't a huge fan, but they were good. It seemed that some were more spicy than others, even though they were all in the same bag. I didn't have any cajun spices so I used Old Bay, like other reviewers said. I've only had O.B. once before so I'm not sure how much that differs from Cajun but they were good (the ones that weren't too spicy, that is). Overall good though and I will try this one again. Thanks!

Very good!..  I did mine under the broiler but next time would like to try them on the BBQ if I have larger shrimp... I was afraid these little guys would burn up; I didn't have cajun seasoning, so I made my own with different spices, and added a little cayenne for heat!.. The family always loves shrimp!..

Disclaimer:  I think I might have messed up.  The flavor was overwhelming, way too much chili powder.  I think it would have been better if the spices were reduced. and I had fewer margaritas.  I'll try it again and review my review.

Awesome shrimp recipe! It was pretty spicy and had lots of flavor everyone liked. I had a pound of 29 shrimp and marinated it for about 7 hours, then put them on sticks and grilled them. The taste depends pretty much on what Cajun seasoning you are using and how much. I used less than three tablespoons and it was still pretty spicy. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a fast and easy recipe.  The shrimp was very good. I served this on salad greens and it really was a good combo.  I took another reviewers advice and put it under the brolier for several minutes. I gave it four stars instead of five because I don't think this is an 8 serving recipe.

I purchased the only Cajun seasoning available in our area and it was so salty it wasn't edible.  I may try again if I can find Emeril's seasoning.

I used lemon juice instead of the lime and marinated half frozen shrimp on the counter for an hour. Instead of putting the shrimp straight on the grill, I used a grilling basket. GReat recipe all of my family loves it!

A keeper with a decrease in the amount of Cajun seasoning. When I made these I only had 1 Tb of seasoning left in the jar so I used that and I think it was just right...no way would I want to triple it! I also tried this using Thai seasoning (wanted more shrimp and as noted was now out of Cajun....) and the Thai worked really well too. We only ate half of them..then next night I tossed the extras with alfredo sacue and served over pasta. I think I liked them even better that way....gave the alfredo sauce some nice kick.

Was ok - did not use as much spice (per others reviews).  I trippled the lime and it was too much.  Probably will not make again.....

So easy and so good! I used jumbo, raw shrimp and McCormick's Cajun seasoning. I scaled the Cajun seasoning back to 1.5 TBS because 3 TBS was VERY hot. I also soaked the skewers while the marinating the shrimp. This has become a regular in our household. Thank you!

Substituted a salt-free chile-fusion grinder for the Cajun seasoning (live on Maui so often have to sub what is available) and t was great. We like things spicy, and this was a hit with everyone. Also, couldn't be easier to prepare! Have made several times since the first, and will continue.

Next time I will do as other reviers suggested and decrease the amount of cajun spice. I used Weber brand and it was quite spicy. I added extra lime juice, but I still didn't taste it. Next time, I will increase the lime juice to try and get some of the flavor. Mabye it was just overtaken by the spice. Overall, it was OK, I wasn't impressed, but it wasn't bad either.

We like spicy food, but I thought the amount of Cajun seasoning in this recipe would be way too much.  So, I used half of the amount indicated and my end result was more like 3 stars - serves me right for not following the recipe.  It really needed that extra pizzazz.

Very tasty!! Like another reviewer suggested, pick a Cajun seasoning you like! I tried Weber's New Orleans Cajun and found 3 tbls was a bit much, will probably reduce it 1 tbls next time. I was also anticipating to taste more lime, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Otherwise, very tasty, simple and easy to make!

I loved this! I used a spicy salt and added some fresh minced garlic and it was heavenly! I found that I wanted a little more marinade for mine, but that might be because we used bigger shrimp than it calls for, but in less quantity. I will try this again!

Fantastic! We added a hot hungarian paprika to our mix, because the cajun spice blend we had in our pantry was a little tame and it turned out great. W will be using this often. It was so easy and quick.

This was a very good recipe.  Super easy.  I did think that the marinade came out a little thick, though, so I'll probably wind up using 1 tbsp less seasoning next time.  The level of spiciness was just right, though.  As an aside, I wound up sauteing the shrimp.  Still delicious.

Made this on the cast iron griddle inside. Possibly the best shrimp I've had. Serve with extra lime. Delicious.

Want to see your shrimp disappear? That's what happened to mine when I made this recipe for a family dinner.  Based on other reviewers, I did reduce the cajun seasoning (Emeril's essence) to 2 tablespoons and it was a major hit... balanced while adding zing to the table.  While I prefer lime, I have also tried this recipe with lemon and it did work.  This is super easy to make on the grill when you use skewers! If you can, make extra and you can use it cold on top of a green salad tomorrow...yum.

Good! I did cut the Cajun seasoning in half, as I'm a bit of a wimp. Quick and tasty. Thank you!

Way, WAY too much cajun seasoning!  So, if you cut that into thirds you should be good.

We made this at the weekend for a BBQ, I made my own spice mix, and we did marinade them for nearer an hour but everything else was the same. My children had great fun and we decided that we would make these again. Thank you for the recipe

I shouldn't give it a 5 star since I made it with flattened chicken breasts.  I had made some of the Emeril's seasoning rub and used it on the chicken with the line and oil.  Let it marinade at room temp. for 1 1/2 hours and grilled it. Great technique for other rub flavors

Very Spicy Shrimp.  We used Creole seasoning which was very high in salt content which took away from the overall satisfaction of the entree.

This turned our really good.  I only used half the amount of Cajun spice, and will use less next time.  Even my kids enjoyed it, but it was a bit to spicy for them.  I served it with a mix of grilled veggies.

Outstanding! I ended up marinating these overnight in the fridge because dinner plans were cancelled unexpectedly. Then the weather wasn't cooperating, so I just tossed them in a hot skillet with a little additional oil.  We used them for shrimp tacos with a little baja sauce and, shredded cabbage, and pico, and they were divine! Probably would taste even better on the grill.  I had some Weber cajun spice in the cabinet that worked out perfectly.

I cooked this in a skillet with some coconut oil instead of on the grill. I put it over a salad with some goat cheese and raspberry vinaigrette dressing. The shrimp is definitely spicy but delicious, I will be making this again probably in the very near future.

Loved this recipe!  I only used 1 Tbsp of Cajun seasoning, which still made it spicy without overpowering the flavor of the shrimp.  Will definitely make again, but may play around with the amount of seasoning and different brands (we used Luzianne this time).

Followed the recipe and was very pleased with the result. The shrimp and a large salad make a great meal.  I will definitely make this again. I will probably reduce the Cajun seasoning a bit as it was spicier than I like.

This was exactly what I was looking for as far as the right mix of spice and citrus.  It was so good I can't wait to make it for the whole family.  I used Emeril's Essence Creole Seasoning and the juice of two limes and it was perfect!

I ended up have BBQ issues, so I made it stove top and it was GREAT!
Just enough spice made it a nice taste without too much heat.

I used  a 1 1/2 of shrimp and used 2 tablespoons of seasoning  but it was still rather salty and we could not taste the lime. If I make it again I will use one tablespoon of seasoning.

Used Chef Paul Prudholmes Magic Salmon Seasoning and some Old Bay rather than Cajun spice.  Squeezed lots of lime on the shrimp before putting on the Foreman. The lime partially 'cooked' the shrimp so next time,  only 2 min or so on the Foreman. Served it with the Orzo/veg/white wine salad on this site- added some cilantro and finely chopped baby spinach immediately before serving. We will definitely be making both of these again!

We  thought these were great!  Wasn't real sure about the grill seasoning but tried Grill Mates mesquite and that seemed to work just fine.  Had a can of adobo sauce but not the peppers so just doubled up on the sauce.  Didn't put them on buns but served alongside some fresh tomato/basil sauce with pasta and mozzarella cheese.  Yummy dinner!

I made a similar version of this but with the following changes that my family really enjoyed:
Add some salt and pepper
Add lime zest and more lime juice
Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of Veg Oil
Add a touch of honey

Excellent.  Lime juice kind of pre cooks the shrimp.  Great lime flavor.  I made one skewer with Lowery's (gluten free) and the rest Tony Chacheries  for everyone else.  used 1 T of seasoning and it was plenty spicy.
Will make again.

I made this using 2T of Emerel's Essence and 2T lime juice. Found it VERY salty. Also, didn't catch any lime flavor. Next time, I'll try 1T Essence and 3T lime juice...we'll see how that goes. Overall, a quick, easy recipe.

I made this for my husband and youngest daughter(17) on vacation in Florida with fresh shrimp. Very tasty but to spicy. After making this as directed the first time (as any good cook knows) I did some adjusting. There was just so much Cajun seasoning you couldnt taste the shrimp. I made it last night with 2 pounds of fresh shrimp but used only 1.5 tablespoons total of Cajun seasoning. It was still spicy and very flavorful. I made a yogurt dip with a lime pineapple flavor for the shrimp. My husband loved it. It was WONDERFUL!

I've been making this for years! I can't believe it doesn't have more 5 star ratings. I used to think I didn't like shrimp. But then I tried this recipe and I've never tried a different one. Even my husband who didn't think he liked shrimp loves this recipe! I don't measure anything though so I may use more Cajun seasoning than the recipe calls for. I use frozen shrimp. I submerge about 20 large frozen shrimp in milk, to remove that "fishy" taste, for about 30 min. I then rinse off the shrimp with cold water, pat dry with paper towels, and put them back in a bowl with olive oil, lime juice, and plenty of Cajun seasoning. I let marinate for another 30 min. or so. Then I grill them up and serve hot! My husband and I could eat bags of this stuff if we didn't limit ourselves. Best grilled shrimp ever!

Everyone at the dinner table loved this shrimp dish.  I cut the Cajan spice to 1 TB like everyone suggested and we all loved the flavor. Other then that I didn't change a thing.

Waaaaaaay too spicy. I believe in making these recipes the way they are written and then reviewing based on that. I am generally happy with recipes from this site, but this was to the point that it was not edible! Unless you eat habaneros for breakfast, you will need to decrease the Cajun... Just my fam's opinion...

Delicious! I made two batches of marinade, the first I put on bone-in chicken breasts and refrigerated it for about four hours. Then I made the shrimp and served them together. I used Bobbie Jean' s cajun spice mix from this site. Came out awesome!

This was SOOOOOOO good. We had thirds and we still kept eating. My only concern was the lime giving a sweet flavor and that was definently a no-no. We will look for more recipes like this. Thanks!!!!!!!

SO good, easy to make, and healthy too! I have made these twice. Tried another lime shrimp and this one is way better. Followed the recipe using olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Also grilled the 1st time and 2nd time cooked them in a hot cast iron skillet with a light coating of olive oil. Both were perfect. The skillet maybe a little easier to tend to, but grill worked out nicely, as well. If you don't have a grill or don't feel like firing it up, don't hesitate to make this...use a hot cast iron skillet and still get a great result. Thanks Kimmy K for the awesome recipe, it's already a favorite.

Marvelous and EASY. Peeled shrimp early in day, made the marinade early as well and kept in plastic bag. Soaked the bamboo sticks in another plastic bag. 
Just before leaving for the BBQ, dumped the shrimp into the marinade bag and gently massaged too coat well.  Took longer to get to the BBQ but the extra marinading time didn't hurt. 
Once at the party I then threaded 5 shrimp each on (doubled) skewers.  Didn't want to thread them earlier as I was afraid the bamboo might pierce the bags while traveling. 
I used 30 shrimp of 26-30 size, home made Cajun spice, juice of 2 (very small) limes and a heaping (?) Tbsp of veg. oil.
Was a huge hit and because everything is so easy to do ahead of time, the marinade is very fast and simple, going to see a lot of these shrimp on the BBQ!
Thanks so much!

Way too spicy! I used a generic cajun seasoning and left in fridge for an hour which may have been the problem but it was so spicy we ended up rinsing the spice off of the shrimp in the sink and that only helped a little.

Very good, very easy. Initial bite it seemed too salty, but after the second shrimp it was just right. Entire pound of shrimp was devoured within minutes of hitting the table.

Delicious!!  We used this recipe for Shrimp Tacos.  I only used 2 Tbsp of Emeril's Essence instead of 3 Tbsp because our 2-year old son ate them.  He gobbled them right up and kept wanting more.  I will definitely use this recipe again!
