I made this tonight. Incredibly GOOD! Will make this on a refular basis. I can't believe no one has reviewed this before. I used Ritz crackers with vegetable flavor because that Is whar I had. The flavor of the seasonings...garlic salt and a ranch salad dressing packet made this a big hit with my family. The autor of the recipe is right...the cracker crumbs stayed on. Chicken was moist tender and delicious.

My kids loved this meal and so did I. It was delicious and crispy. The crackers stayed on and the chicken was juicy inside. I did not use the ranch sauce and it turned out just fine.

Fantastic results. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I didn t have the ranch dressing mix so I just used salt pepper and seasoned salt. Still delicious. I will definitely make it again.

Tween wanted something different since stay at home and I looked for something to do with a chicken breast. I found this recipe and made it in our deep fryer. Used Marion Kaye 99X spice instead of ranch. He loved it. Thanks, will make this again!

Oh so delicous. Of corse its not the healthiest recipe out there but its so good. I made it with thin sliced chicken breast and my entire family loved it including my two picky brothers.
