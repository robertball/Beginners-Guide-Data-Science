Hubs really enjoyed this, and since he's not a fan of wheat bread, this means this definitely is saved in the recipe box.  I thought it had a nice light wheat bread flavor, but it did need more flour.  I ended up using about 7 cups total of flour (3 wheat, 4 AP) and had to add back in about 1/2 c of water, so I would try next time with 6 1/2 c of flour.  The flour to water ratio is off; if you tried as written, you'd end up with a soupy bread.  Reading the recipe, though, reminds me when my mother gave me her pizza dough recipe.  She was a bit more off, though, telling me to add flour as needed without even giving me measurements.  On the bright side, those are recipes for people who like to keep adding flour until they get the right consistency.  Inexperienced bread makers might like a little more guidance, but that's why they have reviews on here.  ;)  Thanks for the recipe!

Hey Everyone! I love this recipe, but I would love your opinion! Let me know how you like it! :D
Kooldog: when I make this recipe, i usually make the dough pretty loose and then knead more flour into it. Probably should have added that into the instructions. But if you make a bed of flour, pour the dough on top and then put more flour on top of the dough and knead, adding more as needed, it works better. Thanks!

Followed the instructions (did use about 2 cups more flour), came out perfectly. No complaints, highly recommend.

Well, I gave it a try with changes,  reading the reviews it seems wet to dry was off a bit….   So I used 4 cups wheat flour and a bit less than 2 cup A/P flour.  I added 3 tbsp vital wheat gluten to the wheat flour.  My wheat flour is old but does not smell rancid (my built in excuse).  I used a stand mixer and seemed a little dry so I added a bit more water..   I opted for 3 loaves since I had upped the amounts…  I sprayed pam and floured the pans (1 metal, 2 glass).  Seemed like a good rise after an hour…    did not rise at all while baking, went about 28 minutes..    came out like bricks, taste is good  but not the lighter texture I was hoping for…  my search continues

This bread is good, after the following changes.
 At first I  followed the recipe to the T. There was definitely way too much liquid verses flour because it was like a batter and not able to be kneaded. I had to add about 1.5 cups more of flour. Then kneaded for 10 minutes.  It rose well and in the end the bread is quite airy and good. I was afraid it would be dense like other recipes I've tried but its pretty good!

Tastes great but as others have said needs far more flour. I had to use gluten free for the all purpose and xhantham gum due to an allergy. Worked very well. Tastes amazing with honey butter. A keeper

For me, the dough turned out more like cake batter. So, I kept adding more all-purpose flour a little at a time until it was the right consistency. I would guess it took about another whole cup. The bread turned out beautiful though and very tasty. Will make again soon. Thanks!

I must have done something wrong because after all the ingredients were mixed together, the dough was like batter, not dough. I added another 
1-1 1/2 cup flour to stiffen the dough.  Any suggestions?

I thought the recipe was good, but I had to add lots more flour to the batter. It came out well and went great with soup!

I think you need to adjust the dry and wet ingredients.  Using what you listed, the consistency of my dough was that of muffin batter.  I had to add at least another cup and a half of both AP and WW flour combined.  The dough is in it's first proof, so I'll update when it's finished.

Update: The finished product came out a little too soft for my preference.  It wasn't really able to stand up to spreadable butter.  Even though it wasn't my favorite recipe, it was still pretty tasty.
