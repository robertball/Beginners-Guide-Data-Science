What can I say.  This cake is easy and awesome.  I took it to a potluck at work.  (I personally did not eat any b/c I try to limit my sweets.)  The cake was quickly gone, even though others brought desserts, too.  Also, there are three lunch shifts, and the cake was gone during the first shift, I think.  Some people who didn't get to try it were dissapointed.  I even had someone say, months after that potluck, that it was the best cake they'd ever ate.  Next time I make it, I want to decorate the top with cute and easy oreo penguins.  Just lay the oreo flat, twist off the top cookie, and break it into two pieces.  The two pieces form the wings as you lay the two pieces on top of the cream.  Then, just plop a hershey's kiss above the broken oreo.  Finaly, decorate the kiss face of the penguin.

A recipe similar to this was originally on the Pillsbury Cake Mix box.  It said to add 1 1/4 cups water, 1/3 cup oil, 3 egg whites, and 1 cup coarsely crushed Oreo cookies to a white cake mix.  Stir in the cookies gently after all is blended.  The frosting recipe was different, however.  It was 3 cups of powdered sugar, 3/4 cup shortening, 1 teas. vanilla, and 2 egg whites (pasteurized, today, available in the egg section of the store). Combine 1/2 cup of the powdered sugar, shortening, vanilla and 2 egg whites; blend well. Beat in remaining powdered sugar until frosting is smooth and creamy.Garnish with additional Oreo cookie halves.  This frosting makes it easier to make ahead, take to a potluck, or to someone's house  It has always been a winner! (As soon as I saw this recipe I remembered that I had this version in my recipe box from many years ago.)

I just have one thing to say about this recipe:DELICIOUS!!!I made this for my husbands birthday and everyone went nuts over it!i had to make two of them for my daughters birthday because it went so fast.This is a great cake for a childs birthday or even your husbands!One more thing before I go,this recipe called for white sugar,i didn't know if it was regular sugar or confectioners sugar so I used confectioners sugar.If it was supposed to be regular sugar the confectioners sugar I used made this cake delicious anyway.

thank you so much for sharing this recipe with everyone!

The grade-school guest children refused to take even one bite of the cake after one of them read the cake name aloud.  Their parents loved it.

The moistness is the best thing about this cake! I used extra oreo crumbles in and on this cake. And I made Cool Whip-cream cheese frosting (Creamy Cream Cheese Frosting from this site).

I made the cake as the recipe was given and it came out delicious and got very good reviews.  The homemade whipped cream & oreos made this cake.  Wouldnt change anything.

this did in fact taste like a boxed cake recipe. However, I made it for my daughter's 5th birthday and the whipped cream inside with the cookies was a big hit with the kiddos AND the adults. It wasn't difficult to make either. As long as you have a hand mixer, whipping the cream is easy! I did not use the cream to frost the outside though. I made chocolate icing, and it worked well also! Great recipe for a quick but distinct cake.

The filling's very good--not too sweet, even my husband who is not a dessert eater, likes it!  My kids can't get enough of it...!  They kept coming back to eat the scraps I cut out when I was shaping the cake.  At the party, all the kids ate the cake and most of them finished it, even the boy who usually don't eat cakes, ate it up...!  The parents have asked me if I could make a birthday cake for him.  Like some reviewers mentioned the cake itself did taste a little bland, the combination of butter cream and whipped cream fillings make a huge taste difference!  I might try making white cake myself instead of a box next time.

I made this cake for Christmas. The Grand kids loved it! Real whipped cream was a great treat making this cake moist. Serving the cake cold was a hit, plus it was so easy to make.

Not really as great as everyone is raving. An average cake, best part was that it was easy but it is bland. Not impressed at all...

Based on other reviews, I made a white cake from scratch instead of using a cake mix. I also added additional oreos in between layers as well as on top of the cake.  It was very bland and family wasn't too enthused about this cake.

Pretty bland. Just tastes like a white cake with whipped cream. Chocoholics will not be satisfied.

If you don't mind box cake (like me) then this is the quickest cake I've ever made. Everyone liked the name as much as the cake. I didn't make this icing, but I should have. I made another one and it ended up grainy tasting. I added the cookies on top and brought it to the office anyway and it was gone in no time.

the cake is... blah.  there's practically no taste there.  the oreo cookie diminished its flavor when baked, it also went soft.  for some of the batter (i made cupcakes) i added one whole cookie in addition to the crumbs, and they stayed crisp.  they were also a little foamy... like sponge scrub.  out of the six children (ages 2-8) i offered this to, all took a bite; but only one continued and finished half of the cupcake.  maybe yellow cake will be better next time around.

This was the best cake ever.  Everyone loved it.  Will certainly be making again.  UPDATE:  I have now made this cake for every birthday for my youngest son.  He will be three this Friday and once again we are making this cake.  It is the most requested cake I make from family and friends.

Delicious!  I cut the recipe in half including using half of the cake mix...half the calories, still a large cake!  I only baked one layer and cut that in half after cooling to make 2 layers.  I sprinkled some extra cookie crumbs on the outside of the pristinely white cake to make it look like dirty snow on the outside too.  Also, there was some extra frosting and cookie crumbs so I mixed those up to make those "roadside chunks" of dirty snow and put them on and around the cake (see picture).  Moist and Delicious!  Fun to make!

Great reviews from the family. 
I will probably make this again for a childs party dessert or school treat.
