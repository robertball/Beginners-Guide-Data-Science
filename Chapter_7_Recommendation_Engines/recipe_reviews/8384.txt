I have been making this pound cake for years, with only small changes.  Increase the vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp or 2tsp, (your preference) I use 2. Start with ROOM TEMPERATURE butter,(REAL butter) cream cheese and eggs which makes for easier mixing and a more creamy outcome, and using cake flour (cup for cup) gives it a more velvet type texture.  I also add the eggs one at a time and make sure each one is completely mixed in before adding the next. And the baking time really depends on how true your oven temp is. Sometimes it may take two hours for this cake to bake if your oven is lower than 325, but baking at a higher temp will cook the outside, but not the in. Tricky?  Yes.  Worth the effort?  Oh yes! Be patient with the mixing, and you will have the best pound cake you will ever eat.  It stands alone, or you can top it with whatever you want.  Simply the best for a good old fashion comfort dessert.

Wonderful! I made this cake (with just 2 adjustments) for my boss' birthday yesterday, and absolutely everyone devoured it and asked for the recipe. In fact, one woman almost cried when she took her first bite- she said it tasted just like her mother's pound cake from decades ago! 

The only changes I made were to decrease the sugar to 2 1/2 cups, and add some almond extract along with the vanilla. 

Also, just a note, but swan's down cake flour is the only flour that I will use for pound cakes. It gives the cake a very fine crumb without the need to sift. 

One more comment: to those people who have uncooked dough in their finished cakes, make sure that your butter and cream cheese are both at true room temperature. Otherwise, the cream cheese doesn't get mixed in and never bakes up, no matter how long you leave it in the oven. 
If your crust burned before the cake was completely cooked, either the oven was too hot, or your oven doesn't circulate the hot air (convection oven). Use a thermometer to tell what the exact temperature of your oven is, and rotate the cake every 20-25 minutes if it's an older oven.

I don't give very many 5 star rating unless the recipe is truly "the best".  This pound cake deserved all 5 stars!!  This could probably be the best pound cake I have ever made...but I did tweak it a bit.  I used 1-1/4 cups of butter and 1/4 cup of buttermilk.  Buttermilk is a secret ingredient of mine that I like to use in place of regular milk called for in a recipe.  It makes your cakes, muffins and breads very moist.  This recipe didn't call for any liquid, but I did add a little for that "moistness".  I also added a tsp of lemon extract to the batter along with the vanilla.  The lemon flavor was very light, but gave it a little something special.  Perfect recipe!!  Many thanks Nanci.

This a great pound cake! The texture is truly like velvet.  It was golden on the outside, creamy white on the in. And it was just delicious. I've found that good pound cakes aren't hard to make, but they require some care in making them. You can't rush the mixing process. (If you have one, use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment for the best result.) Beat the butter and the cream cheese until it looks silky. Add sugar in a slow stream with the mixer still running and beat until this is full and fluffy. This takes a good while, but this how you'll get a lighter cake. The butter, cheese, sugar and eggs mixture should be well mixed because once you add the flour, you are only mixing to incorporate. Beating the flour in will result in a mess. I followed someone else's suggestion and exchanged 1/4 cup of butter for buttermilk. I baked in a cold oven, the way I always make a pound cake, and had a nice crusty exterior.

I'm not sure exactly how to rate this.. I made it Saturday for a party on Sunday and cooked it for 1 hour 20 minutes as directed (I used a bundt pan).  I checked it with a toothpick for doneness and it came out clean. Imagine my HORROR when I went to cut it 20 minutes before the party to find that it was raw in the middle.  I have never had this experience with a cake before and I bake often.  So as for taste, the edge I could taste was great, but WATCH YOUR TIME so you won't be scrambling at the last minute like I was yesterday.  And the toothpick test for doneness apparently isn't accurate for pound cake.  :-(

This cake was absolutely phenomenal. I used two loaf pans. I mixed the sugar into creamed butter and cream cheese in a thin stream, then added one egg at a time (Make sure that the egg is at room temp). To freshen things up a little bit, I filled the loaf pan about a third way up, and sprinkled some raspberries. Then I topped more batter to completely cover the raspberries. The raspberries were a delightful surprise!  Refer to my photo to see how it looks like. Not only does it add a refreshing touch, but also looks beautiful when sliced. Absolutely gorgeous cake!

Delicious!  I made the recipe as directed the first time, and it was great. The second time, however, I decided to tweak it a little. I prepared the batter as directed, then I added 1/4 cup of buttermilk and 2 tsp of pure lemon extract, because I love lemon pound cake. I also made a yummy glaze out of 2/3 cup of melted margarine, 3 cups of confectioner's sugar, and 1.5tsp of lemon extract. This is a slightly crispy glaze when it sets, and the margarine has just the right amount of salt to offset the sweetness of the cake.

I've made this cake twice.. and both times it turned out great... the first time I substituted 1/2 stick of butter for 1/4 cup of buttermilk like another poster suggested.. that made it very moist but it was still very dense.. the second time I subsituted the buttermilk again and also I left out another 1/2 stick of butter and added 1/2 cup of sour cream... this was the perfect combination.. it made the cake light and fluffy with lots of taste.. neither cake lasted 24 hours in my house... so to make it simple.. I used 2 sticks of butter, 1/4 cup of buttermilk, and 1/2 cup of sour cream.. and I creamed  it all in together with the cream cheese..

I've used this recipe for several years.  My husband yearned for his Mom's pound cake and unfortunately no one seemed to have her special recipe. I looked for many years until I found this one in a church cookbook which he believes is "just like Mom's".  In our family cookbook it was voted "The Best Ever Pound Cake".  Others might be interested in an alteration I've made when adding nuts to this cake.  Reduce the flour to 2 cups and add one cup of pecans by hand at the end.  For several years I've reduced the sugar to 2 cups and haven't missed it.  But if you like chocolate chips or icing on your pound cake then you'll most likely want to keep 3 cups of sugar in the recipe.  I also start baking in a cold oven, my grandmother said it made the crust true.  I'm not sure if there is any truth to this or just an old wives tale, but the cake turns out great!  A definite family favorite.

Oh my word....This is the best and easiest pound cake I have ever made. I do think the key to a good pound cake is allow your ingredients to set out so that it can be close to room temperature prior to mixing also beat the ingredients for a while make sure everything is mixed well and that butter and sugar are FLUFFY. You could put fresh fruit or even do a glaze for this cake. Thank you for the great recipe!

As others have noted, I have made this cake, or a near exact version of it, for many, many years. I prefer to use cake flour rather than all purpose, and a full tablespoon of vanilla. The cake is heavy, dense and very versatile - great  topped with berries, used for carved or decorated cakes, or just on it's own. You could also add different flavorings or extracts, the zest of oranges, lemons or limes, use brown sugar rather than white, or add fruit or nuts! It's rich, delicious, perfectly flavored with the vanilla and the mild hint of cream cheese. This time I added a full pint of blueberries and topped it with a simple glaze of lemon juice and powdered sugar. A classic, go-to recipe for the perfect pound cake!

I have a recipe VERY similar to this that has been made for years and years!  We LOVE it!  The only difference is that when you add in the vanilla, we also add in a teaspoon of lemon juice.  It gives it a little extra yummy!  I make this cake when we go to our friend's house for fondue night.  Bake it early, let it sit to cool, and cut it into little cubes that dip perfectly in a nice chocolate fondue!  YUMMY!!!  This cake will also last for a good week in a tupperware container and still be moist and delicious.

I have made this pound cake probably about 8 times in a little more than one year.  When it comes out right, nothing on Earth could compare to this.  The taste, texture, smell, and everything, is just to die for.  I baked it in a Tube Pan and did take other suggestions for ingredient substitutions and methods.  To Summarize (And, thank you to all for the helpful suggestions):  I used 1.25 Cups of Butter and .25 Cups of Buttermilk.  I did replace the Flour, cup for cup, with Cake Flour.  Some of the things I did differently which might not have been specified in the recipe were as follows.    1.  I do bring everything to room temperature. 2.  Patience is key - I use a big mixer and I really cream the Butter and Creamcheese. 3.  When adding the sugar, like a past reviewer or two said, I add it in a steady slow stream.  The slower the better.   4.  Eggs - I add one at a time, beating each egg in thoroughly.  To not get antsy I might measure the Flour out or grease the tube pan so as to let the egg mix in well.  I find "something to do" so as to give each egg its chance to get in. 5.  The first time I made this, part of the cake seemed to implode, as if there was an air bubble, so from now on I spin the tube pan around as I add the finished batter in.  If you just lump it in, the batter will "meet" in the middle, and somehow I think that could have caused the problem.  By spinning the tube pan and letting the batter go in layer by later, I feel like it helps. 6.  On the air bubbl

Have made a similar recipe for 30 years using 1 tsp baking powder and a dash of salt in addition to the ingredient list.  My recipe calls for NO preheating. Cook for 2 hrs @ 300 degrees in a greased, floured  bundt pan.

The salt and starting in a cold oven combat the over-sweetness and burning that many comment upon.

Switch out vanilla extract for almond  extract for a nice change.

A lovely pound cake.  I make a few slight alterations to produce a slice of heaven ...  First I use a tablespoon of vanilla and almond extract combined, and then - and this is an odd little trick I picked up years ago from a Silver Palate recipe - instead of adding the eggs 2 at a time, I beat the FLOUR into the sugar/butter/extract mixture until fairly creamy.  I then beat in the eggs, on at a time.  I've never seen the method reversed like this except in the Silver Palate recipe, however it works perfectly in this recipe.  It will result in the finest texture possible (I also use cake flour if I have it).  Ummmmmmmm!

This was EXCELLENT. The only change I made was adding one additional teaspoon of vanilla. I also microwaved some of that cream cheese frosting that comes in the tub at your local grocery and drizzled it over the top. My dad became the resident cake maker for our family when my grandmother passed. It is time that I begin to build my arsenal of recipes for family gatherings so one day I can take the torch. This recipe will defiantly be in the mix. "Like Father Like Son".

This was my first time making a pound cake and it was delicious. I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. I added a tsp of lemon extract in addition to 2 tsps. of vanilla extract. I did not preheat the oven and I baked it at 300 degrees for 90 minutes. The cake turned out beautifully. It is a heavy cake so I served it warm with Redi-whip and fresh strawberries.

I used 2 glass loaf pans.  The tip I got for using glass was to cut the temp by 25 degrees.  So I baked the loaves at 300 for an hour and 20 minutes.  I started out with a cold oven, another tip I read.  They were perfectly done!  The only alteration I made to the recipe was I added a teaspoon of lemon extract.  I did use the tip of having all ingredients at room temp.  This was a GREAT recipe.  So good and makes a ton.  Froze the other loaf for next week.

OMG this pound cake is like a slice of heaven! It was moist, sweet and simply delicious!!! The only changes I made were to use cake flour instead of regular flour and I used more vanilla about 2 tbs. I also added a little lemon zest to the batter. I baked for 1hr and 20 mins and it was perfect! I did make a glaze for the top of the cake (personal preference) that I seen on a video. It includes 2 cups of confectioners sugar, juice of 1/2 a lemon and 1/3 cup of water give or take (I used a little less than 1/3) mix until the right consistency and pour on top (after cake is cooled of course). Overall this recipe was great going to make again! Thanks :)

I didn't change one thing in this recipe and it was wonderful.
When you change so many things in a recipe and then rate it low...it's not being fair to the original recipe!  I loved this and will use it often for birthday cakes.  I toasted a piece and put vanilla ice cream on top..yummy!!

Excellent!  I love anything cream cheese and this didn't dissappoint!  I reduced the sugar to 2 cups, which was plenty.  I made this cake to use for strawberry shortcake, but it was a shame to cover up the delicate flavor with the strawberries.  A little high in fat content, though, only problem!

One of the absolute best cakes I've ever made!  I followed the recipe ingredients and measurements exactly but used cake flour and added about a teaspoon or two of fresh lemon zest along with the teasp of vanilla.  I think it turned out so well because I beat the h*** out of the butter and cream cheese until it was really light and then added the sugar very slowly and then beat until it was very fluffy.  Lemon flavor was very subtle but enough to help balance out the sweetness.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and the Fruit Salad Dressing on this site that I thickened to almost a custard consistency.  Served it at the dinner we did for Ronald McDonald House and it was gone quickly.  I will definitely make it again... Soon!

I have made this pound cake numerous times and everytime I do, my husband raves about it.  Anytime I have made it for an event, it is all gone before I can even get a piece!  I never use real butter in anything and I use fat free ingredients whenever I can, so I use margarine and fat free cream cheese and it comes out wonderfully!

I know I'm in the minority here. But I read all of the reviews and made sure to mix things properly, all ingredients were room temp. I cut the sugar by 1 cup and increased the vanilla to 2 tsp. The cake looked beautiful when it came out of the oven. I let it cool and then stuck it in the fridge for a couple of hours. Hubby and I couldn't even eat one piece. It was so dry and sweet. I should have taken the sugar down to 1 cup. I don't understand how anyone could eat this cake if made with the full 3 cups. It would be like eating sugar straight out of the sugar bowl with a spoon. P.S. I am an experienced cook so it wasn't anything I did it was the recipe.

This is identical to a cream cheese pound cake I make except I add 2 t. vanilla and put it in a COLD oven turned to 300 degrees then for two hours. It comes out perfect every time!

I have never made a pound cake before.  I was in the mood to bake and thought I'd give this one a try...I followed the recipe exactly...and some of the suggestions...everything at room temp, starting in a cold oven...it is fantastic.  Moist and dense, just sweet enough.  I can't wait till strawberries are in season to have with this.  Thanks Nanci.

This was a very good cake. I made a few adjustments - I used 1 stick of 'real butter' and two sticks of margarine. I also used 1 cup of real sugar and two cups of 'Splenda'. It was good, but I think next time - I will follow some of the other's advice to decrease the butter slightly and use buttermilk. I will also try the 'cold oven'. I agree that your ingredients need to be at room temperature for best results - I think mine were still a little too cold. Pound cakes aren't hard to make - but it's all about taking the time to mix it correctly with room temperature ingredients. I will update on my next one & let you know how the changes affect the overall result.

This recipe was wonderful. It is super easy and totally yummy! I only made two small changed which others had suggested in previous reviews. I used cake flour, and mixed the eggs in one at a time. The cake was very dense and very good. It took 25 more minuets than the recipe says for mine to bake all the way through. I served it while still warm, which made it only better.

WOW!  I impressed myself with this recipe!  I was surprised at how yummy it turned out.  Moist and the taste reminds me of shortbread cookies.  Everyone raved about this!  I followed this recipe as written without making any changes - EXCEPT that I stirred in approximately 2 cups of chopped fresh strawberries before pouring in the pan.  It took about 1 hour 40 minutes to cook in my oven.  I will make it again and try fresh blueberries!

UPDATE: Redid this recipe with the following modifications: used 1/2 cup less sugar and did increase the vanilla. Much better taste, much better texture. I did bake it in the 10inch tube pan and it did bake perfectly golden brown in about 1 1/2 hours. Love this recipe now! .........Earlier Review from Sep 2008: Followed this recipe exactly. It is too sugary for my taste, so if I make it again I will use 1/2 the sugar. Also I didn't have 10inch tube pan, so it made more batter than would fit into my 9 inch pan, I had enough batter left over to make 2 additional small cakes. Lastly, it took over 2 hours to bake. My neighbor loved the recipe, I'm willing to try it again with a few modifications.

I don't think anyone mentioned that this is impossible to digest!!! I like butter, I love desserts, I enjoy eating french fries or deep fried food sometimes, I am a healthy 120 pound woman with no troubles. My husband is a big guy and likes to eat. This cake made us both sick, we only had a small slice. I didn't change anything in the recipe except I always use less sugar, and it came out really good! I had no problems with anything, I made two cakes in two loaf pans, it took a few more minutes to bake it, they didn't fall, didn't burn although you do want to be careful and watch it, and they tasted very good.  this is not me, it's the cake! very heavy. Please note, this is not a mocking review. I will use sour cream recipe next time. My 10 yo had no problems. But I am letting you know. I can chew on a piece of butter and won't have these problems. This cake is a killer!

Excellent pound cake. (It was waay to sweet though, I will cut back the sugar to 2 cups)  Takes some time to mix, but totally worth it. Use room temperature ingredients. Instead of vanilla I used one and a half tsp of almond extract and a half teaspoon of raspberry extract.  It was wonderful.

I've never tried to make a cake from scratch before so I was a bit nervous about attempting a pound cake, but this recipe is wonderful!  I followed some of the review's advice and added 1/4 c. buttermilk and 2 teas. lemon extract to the batter.  It really does make a difference to start in a COLD oven and the ingredients must be a room temperature.  My husband is not a "cake-eater" but he ate 3 pieces! Thanks Nanci!

I baked this cake for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I had some cream cheese icing left over from another recipe, so I drizzed some over the top of the cake. It took the cake to another level.  Great! See icing recipe below.

1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened 
1/2 cup butter, softened 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar

When I was in Jr. High I made a pound cake, and I lost the recipe.  I was searching high and low for a recipe that tasted as good, and this one hits the spot!!!  I serve this with the Buttercream Icing recipe from this site.

Tried this twice. Followed directions to a tee and was very disappointed both times. Baked in a bundt pan and the second on a loaf pan. Both times the toothpick came out dry. But the inside still uncooked. Don't waste your time. Grandma's poundcake still on this site was good.

I am giving this three stars because my family enjoyed it much more than I did. I found it to be a little bland, and I struggled a lot with the baking time. At the one hour mark, I noticed that the cake had cracked in a circle around the middle of the pan, and although the center was done, the batter inside the crack was still raw. I baked it for twenty more minutes, and then in five minute increments until it finally firmed up around 1 hour 45 minutes. The interior texture ended up varying from drier/denser to more moist. Overall, not what I was hoping for.

Extremely tasty and moist. I baked mine for 1 hour 35 minutes and it was baked through perfectly. The people with pockets of unbaked batter probably used cold cream cheese that didn't mix in smoothly. Be sure your cream cheese is at room temperature and mix it with the butter until it is completely smooth and you should have an evenly baked cake.

Excellent Recipe.  Others have complained about the cooking time but it was exact for my oven.  REally nice texture and quite moist.  I used 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond extract - next time I think I will use a whole tsp of vanilla and 1/2 almond.  Needed just a bit more flavor.  May try some lemon extract, also.  This has become my new base recipe for pound cake.  Thanks for sharing!

This pound cake is phenomenal! I don't find it dense or heavy at all! I was taught years ago, that to make my pound cake rise, I need to beat my butter for 7 minutes on medium speed. Since it was butter and cream cheese, I beat the 2 for 7 minutes. Then I slowly added the sugar, mixing that for an additional 5 minutes. I added the eggs next, 1 at a time, mixing for at least 30 seconds each. Now I turned off the mixer and stirred in 1 tablespoon of vanilla. Turning the mixer back on to low, I added the (sifted) flour gradually, waiting to add the next batch when the previous was fully incorporated. I put mine in a bundt pan, cooked in a 300° oven for 1 hour and 45 minutes. It was perfection. Pure perfection! This is going to be my go to pound cake from here on out! It's so moist and light. I don't find it heavy or dense at all. I'm serving it with fresh strawberries, I think next time I'll fold in some fresh blueberries. Yummy!
Forgot to add, always, always in baking start with room temperature ingredients! Since I was using unsalted butter, I used 1/8th tsp of salt. Enjoy!

This is a very good pound cake, however, in my and my family's opinion it is too sweet.  First time I made it with 3 cups of sugar, second time with 2-1/2 cups.  I'm thinking the third time will be the charm with 2 cups sugar.  

Everything else was absolutely perfect--texture, moistness, flavor.  With pound cake, technique is what makes it good--room temperature ingredients are a must, and a stand mixer will definitely get everything incorporated perfectly.

Really excellent.  I rarely give 4 stars but this is good.  2 changes I highly recommend:  Use Castor Sugar and Cake Flour.  Really....you won't regret it.  You will need to use a bit more of the ultra-fine sugar and a tablespoon more cake flour per cup of regular flour.  Also, made with chocolate chips...really rocks!  Enjoy

Similar to another reader I baked this cake for 1 hr. and 20 minutes, let it cool, cut into it and found a very raw, underbaked cake. I made no substitutions and followed the recipe exactly.  Please don't make this cake as something is terribly wrong with it!

Hands down the best pound cake recipe i've ever made and eaten. I have modified this recipe by using only 1 cup of butter instead of 1-1/2 cups. It brings out the flavor of the cream cheese without sacrificing moistness.

I made a lemon pound cake out of this recipe by adding 1 cup lemon juice and 2 teaspoons zest. This is the best EVER! If it weren't for the stamps, I'd mail you money to make this JUST so you would know how good this is. I beg you, try this.

I made this for thanksgiving and topped it with a vanilla glaze.  My guests loved it; it's very rich and dense.  The next time, I'll add a flavor, perhaps a bit of lemon or orange zest.  It's delicious and is excellent fare for a special occasion.

Gets better the day after. Made this cake for Christmas , and it was gone by the 30th. I cooked it for an hour and 15 minutes in a 13 by 9 inch cake pan. Came out rich, buttery and golden brown. My fiance said it was perfect, I think it needed to cook 10 more minutes. After the first day though, I felt I cooked it long enough. Im making it again for the new year. I also added 1/2 tbls of fresh orange zest....Fantastico

Made this today and was a disappointed that it turned out a bit greasy.  I softened the butter and then mixed w/ cream cheese as instructed but to me, the batter seemed a bit runny before putting into the oven.  If I do make again, I'll need to determine how much less butter to use.

Specatcular and so easy.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Be sure to let your butter, cream cheese and eggs come to room temperature before starting.  I even got a compliment from my MIL, she loved it!

I have made this pound cake for years.  It is in the Bell's Best cookbook.  The only difference is you put it in a cold oven at 300 degrees and bake for one and one half hours, Mary

This was excellent. I'm saving this recipe for future reference. The only thing I did different... I baked it in an old thick aluminum Bundt pan which was greased with genuine butter and floured. In the aforementioned pan it took about two hours to get done instead of the hour and twenty minutes as suggested by the recipe for a ten inch tube pan. I will make this again.

I usually bake a cake once every two weeks or so, and I must say, this is THE best pound cake I have ever tasted.  And it's probably the best cake in general that I have ever had.  It is a category to itself.   When baking it, I substitute almond extract for the vanilla.  And I substitute half a cup of sour cream for half a cup of butter, and I add about 2/3 cup of buttermilk. When I baked it the first time, I made a key lime glaze out of boiled key lime juice (1/2 cup), sugar (1 cup), heavy whipping cream (2/3 cup), and butter (1/2 cup).

YUM!  This is a very dense and flavorful buttery pound cake.  I didn't read the directions correctly and beat the sugar and butter and then added the cream cheese.  I beat in three eggs at a time.  It still turned out perfect. I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla.  This would be good for carving and rounding top edges, frosting with buttercream and topping with fondont.  Froze well.  I made another cake using a chrysanthemum bundt pan.  This recipe is too much for this pan...fill the bundt pan with a 1.5 inch space from the top edge.  Bake at 325F for 1 hr. 20 minutes.  Decrease heat to 275F and bake another 10 minutes.  Soooooo goood...like velvet.

I have been using this recipe for years and absolutely love it. I do use more vanilla and also add 1 Tb of lemon exact too. Oh and I also add about 1/2 tsp of salt. I think a little salt always makes a cake taste better. I also sell this cake for $25.00 in Los Angeles and I forgot that I also add a lemon cream cheese glaze.

This is really really really delicious. I made it just as it's written, left out the cream cheese and butter so they were nice and room tep and it came out SO very rich and moist. I can't wait to make it again. It baked up really lovely, it was a gorgeous uniform crumbo and was like velvet on the tongue. Will absolutely make this again and again !! Thanks!

This recipe is great I hope Nanci doesn't take it personal when the recipe doesn't get good ratings, because if you know how to cook you will really like this one!! The only change I made was to sift my flour and I didn't use cake flour and it came out fluffy and very moist!!!  The second time I made it was better than the first.

This was it! The recipe I have been searching for.  I used to make this one years ago and I lost the recipe and this is definetly the one I remeber.  Other recipe say to add almond extract no matter how hard I try I simply do not not like almond extract.  this one had the perfect flavoring.  I serve this particular cake with strawberries and whipped cream for a tasty strawberry shortcake.

I love this cake! I made it 3 times in about 4 weeks. Everyone I share it with loves it. It's a throw-back to what a pound cake used to be (a pound of this, a pound of that...). I mix-in the flour one cup at a time and use 2 tbsp of vanilla for the best "pure pound cake" flavor.

This recipe is just wonderful.  I am now known as the "cake" lady because of this cake.  I did alter the recipe and added a tablespoon of vanilla and teaspoon of almond extract.  The almond flavor and the moistness of the cream cheese, will make you a very popular person.

I have made this recipe dozens of times......the recipe is perfect, but everybody's oven is different.  I use a dark pan, so I lowered the temp to 275 degrees and baked it for 1 hour 40 minutes.  Using an oven thermometer helps because some ovens cook hotter, resulting in the outside cooking faster than the inside.  Believe me, after much trial and error, with a few tweaks, this is a great, moist pound cake.  Also, I use 1 teaspoon vanilla and two teaspoons almond extract which is really tasty!  I've used this recipe for chocolate and coconut pound cakes, too.  Love it!

Wow!!! So this was my first attempt at making a pound cake and for my 1st try, this came out fantastic. I did use cake flour instead of all purpose flour as some of the other reviewers suggested but that was the only change I made. The only thing that was different is that it take a little longer than an hour and a half to completely bake through. It was completely done after about an hour and 50 mins but that could've just been my oven. This recipe is definitely a keeper and I will be making this again. Thank you so much for the recipe :-)

This recipe is AMAZING! I am an amateur cook ( just moved out of my parents house and trying to learn how to cook for myself! )and i found this recipe really simple and easy to follow. I was really scared when the batter came out thick, but i went ahead anyway and i got a really moist rich dense cake! My friend and I cut some slices added some whipped cream and strawberries and had a delicious girls night in! Thumbs up to whoever created this recipe... again, its really easy for beginners!

Great recipe.   Cake turned out velvety smooth.  I used ingredients at room temp, cake flour, 2 tsp. vanilla, and added eggs one at a time.  I, too, start with a cold oven for a wonderful crust. This one is a keeper. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

This cake is too dense and heavy. The recipe could do with a lot less of everything, especially sugar. Will not be making again.

This wasn't as good as I expected. Maybe I over baked it, but I thought it was slightly dry. Or maybe it was since I used two loaf pans... The texture and color was very nice though. I may try it with a little less sugar as others have suggested since this was very sweet. (I love sweet, but I've never  had a pound cake this sweet.) The batter made a LOT and two loaf cakes, so, I'm freezing one for later. Someone said it's even better after freezing for a while, so maybe that will improve the moisture issue. ? Anyway, we ate the first cake without a problem, so it's good; mine just wasn't 5-star. Thanks!

OMG!  I just made this and it came out of the oven smelling divine.  I only had a bundt pan so it did rise over the edges with a very crispy crust.  I inverted on a plate and the bottom doesn't look pretty but oh dear god!  This pound cake is awesome!  I can't quit eating the overhang.  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of the extracts:  used 1 tsp almond and 1 tsp vanilla.  Just used plain old all purpose flour.  Thank you!

This recipe is one I have had for years.  It was from my Grandmother that she had before I was born and that was over 50 years ago.

Her version uses 1 teaspoon of vanilla and one teaspoon of almond extract with a pinch of salt.  Also place in a cold oven, bake at 300 for 2 hours.  This cake is actually a little better if you freeze it for a few days or a month.  I have made in 3 small loaf pans, baked for about 45 minutes then freeze.  That way I have a mini to take to someone when they are sick.

I have made many, many poundcakes in my day... but I must say this is the best tasting one to date! WOW!  The first time I made it, it came out gooey because I didn't let it cook long enough.  I cooked it again a week later and it was absolutely perfect!  I will use this recipe again and again! Thanks!

I forgot about this one in the oven and thought that it was going to be ruined, but it actually turned out fabulous.  It was dense, rich and buttery. I chose to top this with whipped cream and fresh raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries.  Fantastic summer dessert.  This recipe is so versatile.  I also thought about topping with a caramel icing, or perhaps some grilled peaches and honey.  Will be making again to try something different.

I can't imagine a cake with cream cheese but not almond so I added a teaspoon of almond extract.  The texture and taste of this cake are fantastic.

Well I won't be using an other recipe for pound cake this was exquisite!  I was very careful to let my kitchenaid do MUCH blending with the butter, cream cheese sugar part, and then also with the eggs one at a time. REALLY IMPORTANT TO BLEND TOTALLY (all ingredients at room temp).   But when i added the flour, i simply incorporated it only, no extra blending (great advice, thanks to another reviewer). I also used 1/4c less butter and 1/4c buttermilk (from powder) instead. Be careful not to take it out too early, i used a short toothpick in a bundt pan, but after finding a longer bbq stick, i was glad i didnt take it out too soon. Toothpick was too short and may appear done when not.  Total cooking for me was 1hr 12 mins at 325 in a coated bundt pan. EDIT:  I made this again and used a loaf pan AND a bundt pan..I'll let you know

One star for the taste.  Sadly, in order for this pound cake to be fully baked inside, the outside takes a beating by becoming too crisp for a pound cake.  The crisp outside does not make for cutting smooth, clean slices.  Sorry to say, I will not be saving this recipe.  I truly don't understand the great reviews it did get.

This is exactly my personal recipe handed down for generations in my family. To really add some flavor, substitute vanilla butter nut for the vanilla extract. Also, to make a lighter colored cake, I cut the temp to 300 degrees and cook for a longer period. To lighten the recipe, I've used lowfat margarine, eggbeaters, and lowfat cream cheese. It only changed the texture to a more spongy feel--but still as tasty and appreciated by the women in my office. The trick to making a great cake is beating in air by alternating 1/2 cup flour to 1 egg--beating after each flour and each egg addition. It has lots of starts and stops; but, it is so worth it!! This is my personal favorite cake recipe as it so versatile!

I really really wanted to like this recipe, but even after 2 hours in the oven, this cake still wasn't cooked all the way through.  I saved it by cutting it up into chunks and used it in a trifle.  However, the tip about starting with a cold oven was right on--I got a great crust.

This cake reminds me so much of the ones my husband's grandmother used to make, and I've made him a happy man by trying this recipe. A note to the thrifty: I used 2 sticks of margarine and 1 stick of butter and my husband can't taste the difference. The only other change I made was to up the amount of vanilla to 1 tablespoon. It is very important to be patient as you mix the butter and cream cheese together - do it slowly, and wait until it is very creamy. I started with a cold oven, and the baking time was about 2 hours. Perfect old-fashioned pound cake!

This pound cake turned out very good! I found that the batter was very thick, so I added a little milk. I also added 1 teaspoon of baking powder and vanilla to flavor (1 teaspoon wasn't enough). I think that the baking powder made it a little less dense, but if you like a really dense cake, then skip that. Overall, though, it was really simple and tastes really good!!! Thanks!

I love this pound cake and have made several variations over the years with flavoring, nuts, etc... Now that I am very familiar with the recipe I always reduce the sugar and make sure all contents are room temperature before starting.  Everyone in the family wants to know my secret and raves about the cake.  Thanks Nanci this recipe is a jewel!

I did not change a thing, followed the instructions completely (ingredient quantities) and came out with a delicious pound cake. However, for baking I did follow previous tips on NOT pre-heating and backing in a cold oven- pound cake was flaky on the outside and oh, so moist/dense (like a real pound cake)...superb.  Will definetly make again.  Thank you!

Very good!  For a variation, try adding a bag of mini choc chips.  I made it into 5 mini loaves instead of a cake to give as gifts for Christmas.

This was the very first pound cake I have made and I was really looking forward to it based on the reviews, but I was disappointed with the result. I must have done something wrong! The batter was so thick, like cookie batter (was it supposed to be that way?) the cake fell a little after I removed it from the oven, and the middle seems "too" moist--it doesn't have a cakelike texture. (Although, the toothpick came out clean after 1 hour!)  Maybe I'll try it again with less butter!

This cake is well worth the time and money but with a few adjustments as well as knowing how to bake. I use  3 1/2 cups of sugar, 7 eggs, 1 Tablespoon of vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon baking powder. There are several keys to good baking and having a cake turn out the way you want it to. 1. Use real butter 2. Make sure all ingredients are good and in date. 3.Sift your flour for fresh sifted flour will make your cake rise better. Now for a well mixed cake do these few things. 1. Beat eggs and add little by little while alternating with the sifted flour. 2. Do not just pour the flour in. Mix the flour, salt and baking powder together. If the top starts to brown to fast, just place tin foil on top. This is a recipe that is a well worth it. It is the same as my Grandmother use to make back in the 50's and 60's.

This cake was wonderful, however I did use cake flour like others suggested. It turned out perfect except for that the crust lifted a bit from the actual cake (which might just be because I opened the oven prematurely.)

I've made this cake for years, not with 100% success. I've had many to drop like a rock when I took them out of the oven!  As for taste, my son-in-law said he'd be glad to take all the "fallen" pound cake home with him.  Yes, the taste is remarkably delicious. Pondering what to do or give up on it, I read other reviewers comments and have figured out, my cakes fell because I didn't mix the ingredients long enough. Very likely, because I'm always hurrying to get things done.  You cannot hurry this recipe.  It is tried and true and whether you use lemon, vanilla, almond extracts, or butter or coconut extracts, the cake is moist and the flavor and texture unique.  No longer disappointed now that I've learned to slow down and taste the cake!!

Excellent Cake.  Definitely start in cold oven, sift flour twice, 3 tsp vanilla and use room temperature ingredients.  Makes the world of a difference.  Extra work but so worth the effort.

Overall a good recipe. I reduced the sugar to 2 cups, added the zest of two lemons, one lime and one orange, omitted the vanilla, added 2 tablespoons of lemon-lime juice and mixed wild blueberries in with it. It was still a bit on the sweet side, but otherwise, it's a great base recipe with endless possibilities.

This was the first time I have baked pound cake from scratch and I must have done something wrong.  I baked the cake for 1 hour and 20 minutes and it came out horribly dry.  I checked it with a toothpick per the directions but obviously that didn't work.  I am afraid to try again.

i had never made a pound cake before or a bundt cake and i tried to make both for my mother's birthday. I was afraid it would be not done enough in the center or some other catastrophe and was nervous because i could not check it out before serving! I served it with a spray of flowers in the center of the cake (as seen in a magazine) and a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top. I even had to make it the night before and it was AMAZING. so pleased with this recipe. my mother was thrilled and my grandmother (who has forgotten not to say things she thinks out loud gave a very honest review and licked the crumbs from her plate). Kept very well in a glass cake dome for days. The butter and cream cheese make it moist even if you must make it ahead. yum.

Yum!  I used Neufchatel cream cheese to lower the fat (really??? as if it matters with 3 sticks of butter in this! oh well :).  It took longer than 1 hr and 20 minutes to bake but it was worth it.  Very dense and moist.  I plan to serve this with strawberries and cool whip.

Absolutely the best!  If you are trying out this recipe please be patient preparing the batter.  Cream cheese and butter must be whipped until fluffy, after adding the sugar beat again, add an egg at a time and mix well after each one. I prepared a bundt cake pan and put chopped pecans on the bottom of the pan.   I followed the advice of a rater to bake it in a cool oven.  It turned out perfect.  Nice soft golden crust and creamy inside.

This should be called Heaven Cake! It is so delicious OMG!!!! I made it with coconut one time and I couldn't stop my husband from eating it! I also want to mention that I split the recipe in half and I made one yellow and the other black by adding coco powder. It looked beautiful for about 10 minutes and then it was gone.......Thanks very much for sharing this!!!

This pound cake is very good, I left the eggs, butermilk, butter and cream cheese out for several hours to make sure it was roome temp and very soft.  I used softassilk cake flour, which added significantly to the texture.  I also added vanilla, lemon, butter and rum flavors.  That being said, there is that rich, deep pound cake flavor missing.  Next time, I will sub a half cup of butter for an extra cup of cream cheese, add more flavorings and see if I can make it 5 stars.  Otherwise, good taste, good texture and a great starting place to be tweeked!

Yes heavy, yes dense, yes extremely good pound cake!  It didn't quite fit my tube pan and the excess made a kind of collar when I inverted it onto a plate.  The collar was crisp and delicious and all picked off before the cake even got served. Since we had leftovers, my husband fried his slices in butter the next day.

I just have to say this is THE best cake I have ever tasted in my entire life!  I used margarine instead of butter, it was fantastic!  I also made home made whipped cream and drizzled strawberries on top.  I can't get over how great it was!!!

I used fat free cream cheese because it was the only cream cheese I had- I used country crock churn style for the butter.  When I made this I only made half of this recipe.  I only had less than a tablespoon of vanilla it still tasted so yummy.  I used reg white flour it still came out perfect! OMG I love this recipe- it tasted like cheese cake and pound cake at the same time.  I've never had something like this before I loved it!  I suggest that you use an electric mixer because the batter is very thick and dense.  (hard to hand stir) It tastes so good!!!  Love this da best ever!!!

i was extremely disappointed with this recipe. the outside hardened but the inside stayed mushy, even though i baked it for an extra 30 minutes. the outer layer burned, and it was inedible. i will not make this or recommend it again.

This is exactly like my mom's pound cake - a cake that she's been making since I was small, twenty-some years ago.    This recipe works best if you leave the butter and cream cheese out overnight to soften.  You can also substitute margarine for one stick of the butter, or add 1/4 tsp almond extract for a different flavor.    Great recipe.

I thought this was very good. I followed other reviewers tips and made sure my cream cheese, eggs and butter were at room temperature. I tried the "cold oven" and it seemed to work out well.I also used the cake flour (Swans) and used two teaspoons of vanilla extract. Wait a day before eating to get the full flavor affect.

I made this for Christmas to give out as mini loaves for family and friends. I used almond extract in place of vanilla. I have had so many requests for the recipe. It was an incredibly good cake and so easy to make. This week I am going to use this recipe to make my mother's birthday cake and frost it and use fondant to decorate it. I am hoping that it will hold up!

Well, I only got to taste a crumb because I made this for a bake sale, so I may have to rate this one again when I make it a Christmas!  The batter was just gorgeous as it blended together - thick, smooth and velvety.  I altered recipe a bit and added three ounces melted unsweetened chocolate to about 1 1/2 cups of the batter so I could have a marble pound cake.  When removed from the pan the outside looked a little crusty and not too attractive.  Used Hard Chocolate Glaze to "cover up" and it was wonderful.  I'm going to make loaves of this (will probably do the marble effect again) to give as gifts at Christmas.

Excellent. Nice dense texture, with a slightly crunchy outside. Best pound cake I have ever made. I did tweak the recipe a bit though. Might be helpful to others.  I used cake flour rather than all purpose, this gave the cake a little extra. Also I replaced 1/4 cup of butter with buttermilk, made it a little more moist.  I used 2tsp. of vanilla and 2 tsp of almond extract.  If you don't love almond, use less, my husband wasn't crazy about it.  I also tried a cake with 1tsp of coconut extract and made a pineapple glaze, great summer flavor.Just a heads up, each time I baked the cake it rose a great deal out of the pan, but was fine once I filled it out on a platter.  The baking time was more along the lines of 1hour 45-50mins.

This was the first time I ever made a pound cake. My mother had said it was easy to make, but I had my doubts.
This recipe was very easy and the results were great! Even my father who says the only pound cake he likes is the one my mother bakes said to was very good. He's been eating my moms pound cake for nearly 60 years and if he says it was good you can take it to the bank. It was very good

I have made this recipe several times and always with great compliments, but i was wondering if I wanted to make it a little lighter, what would I do?

I like this recipe, but I think I'd have to make changes if I made it again.  Three cups of sugar is too sweet for our taste (even my two year old said that).  I'd also use a bit of lemon extract to give it a little something extra.  That being said, the texture is so smooth and dense - just like a pound cake should be.  I also like that it is crispy on the outside and moist inside.

Here are two things that do not affect my rating, but that others may want to know re: this recipe.  It makes approximately 8.5 cups of batter so if you're filling a stand-up or special pan, you can plan on about that much.  Also, it is too dense for the stand-up house pan by Wilton, in my opinion.  In order to get the inside of the cake fully baked, the outside became really, really tough.  I think either a different pound cake recipe needs to be used or less than the 5 c. of batter recommended by Wilton.

This was the first time I have made a pound cake and I was a little worried how it would turn out.  I made it exactly as stated.  It turned out GREAT and tasted just WONDERFUL.  My husband had to put strawberries on and I just had my plain.  He said it was much better than angel food cake and that was what he now wanted with his strawberries from now on (WOW - never expected that). Thank you -

Oh.. my.. gosh. Absolutely the best pound cake ever. I had no idea it could be so easy. I added 3 tbsp. raspberry earl grey tea leaves to the mix before baking, which gave it a wonderful raspberry flavor. This is definitely going to be my only pound cake recipe.

I wasn't too fond of this pound cake.  It was a bit dry. My company liked it, however. I served it with strawberries and whipped cream, highly recommend doing this.

My children wanted a coconut cake for Christmas, so I chose this cake because I had all the ingredients at home, and plan to add a coconut glaze or coconut icing. The batter is very thick, even with extra vanilla, almond and coconut flavor. At one hour in the oven, the cake was still very raw inside, so I turned the heat up to 350* for about 12 minutes. It was perfect after 1 hour & 20 minutes. It turned out beautiful and reminds me of cakes made by my grandmother.

Excellent texture and taste! The only thing that I changed was that I added 1 cup of mini choc. chips to the batter before baking. (chocoholic me)
It was a hit and my family agrees!  Julie

Although fairly easy to make, the outcome was a bit of a disappointment. It tasted too eggy and it was somewhat moist, but overall... not my favorite pound cake. I would pass this up in favor of trying other recipes.

This is the best pound cake recipe I have ever made.  Easy too! I made just one small adjustment.  Instead of 1 teaspoon vanilla, I used 1/2 teaspoon each of Vanilla, Almond and Lemon Extracts.  AWESOME!  My Mom is the Pound Cake master - she wants this recipe!

This is the quickest, easiest and best pound cake recipe. If you want more flavor, you can add almond extract (you have to experiment), which gives it a wonderful taste. Substituting regular flour for cake flour (cup for cup), sifting only once is good also.

My "go to" pound cake recipe. Incredibly easy to make and comes out great every time! 

I find that the cake needs a bit more time than quoted to cook, averaging around 1 hour and 40 minutes to be completely baked.

Have been making this for many years.  I use one cup of brown sugar and two cups of white sugar...Amazing!  This cake freezes beautifully...I freeze it in portions I will likely use for unexpected company.  Always have the base for a yummy dessert on hand.  Often lightly toast slices, top with vanilla ice cream and homemade fudge or Carmel sauce.

It tastes like short bread cookies in cake form, which might not be the worst thing, but it is certainly totally bland and waaaay too sweet.  It took 2 hours to bake and still had burnt edges that needed to be cut off before tasting the cooked center.

Excellent.  Just made it  for the first time.  I did take my time to make sure butter and cream cheese were at room temperature before starting.  I also added and mixed each egg in separately (with an electric mixer) for 1 minute each.  only difference in ingredient was I added 2 tsp and not 1 of vanilla.  When I make again, I'll just use 2 cups of sugar.  I tend to like less sweet....but my kids loved this!!

MMMMMMMMGOOD! added sugar after mixing cream cheese and butter. Read on the net that you should mix cream cheese first then add butter.  First, I let eggs and butter become room temperature. I added the eggs one at a time and mixed about 30 seconds per egg. I used cake flour instead of regular flour. I added 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla and a teaspoon of lemon extract.  Will try adding almond too next time. I also added 1/4 cup of milk as suggested by another viewer. I think I will try buttermilk next time.  I made a lemon glaze and pour over once the cake was removed from the bundt pan.

New Edit:
Made the cake again, tried the buttermilk- don't think I will use buttermilk again;because the cake was a little dry.  I will use the 2% I did before. 
I added 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla, 1 and 1/2 of lemon extract and 1 tsp of almond astract. Will do 1 and 1/2 of the pure vanilla next time.

This cake came out wonderfully, and to enhance the flavor in addition to the 1 1/2 tsp of of vanilla flavor I added 1 1/2 tsp of lemon juice to give the cake a lemon taste and used Swans Down cake flour as well.

I made this yesterday,and it was FABULOUS!!!!I followed a previously posted advice by putting it in a cold oven and started the kitchen timer when the oven got to 325 degrees.  The only tweeks I made was to reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup and increased the vanilla to 2 tsps.  Like I said, it was a HIT!!!! Another recipe for my recipe box.  Thank you for sharing this great pound cake recipe.

This has become a family tradition for us.  Both my boys like to help so I like this recipe because it is easy and you don't have to alternate eggs, flour, etc. for it to come out right.  It is so moist and the crunchy edges are our favorite!!!

If you have a metal pan, you do have oil and flour your pan. If not do not oil and flour pan. The crust of the cake came out very hard.

This is my very first time ever making a pound cake from scratch! I tried this recipe and I absolutely loved it!! And so did everyone else ....all of my friends and coworkers loved it and wanted more:-)  I guess this was a true success . The only thing I did different was at 1/4 cup of buttermilk, other than that this recipe was a smash :-)
Xoxo

I just got into baking and baked this cake for the first time yesterday and it was a total SUCCESS. My family loved it this cake is a heavy cake but it was so moist. I also made a glaze to top it off. I will be making this cake again.

I made this exactly as stated, it was the most amazing pound cake I've ever had. Be careful that your oven is set at the specified 325 degrees for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Mine took about an extra 7 minutes.Awesome cake.

This cake was marvelous.  I made it for the principal and yes, he enjoyed the cream cheese lemon pound cake.  I've been asked to make this cake for our christmas party. This cake had a wonderful color I will make this cake again and again. I used my granny bundt cake pan  which has been passed down several generations.

This pound cake is very good as written, but I found it a bit too sweet for my taste. I will make this pound cake again making some of the adjustments suggested by many of the reviewers, which included reducing the amount of sugar among other suggestions.

Excellent recipe! I chose it for its simplicity in ingredients as well as preparation ease. It was so well enjoyed that I am bringing the coworkers a second one tomorrow. I followed the recipe to the letter and give this anytime cake all five stars.

I forgot to mention my addtions to this recipe. I used cake flour which always gives the best texture results. I also added 1 Tbls. of lemon extract w/ an equal amount of vanilla. Since this recipe contained no levening or liquid I added 1/4 tsp baking soda & 1/4 cup whole milk. The results... PERFECTION!!!!

I make cakes to give away for the holidays.  And this is my most requested Pound Cake recipe. I normally use 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of lemon flavor. 
                                                                                   
This past Thanksgiving, I changed up and used the 5 flavor method.  I used one teaspoon each of Vanilla, Butter, Cocoanut, Rum, and Lemon.  I also added 1/4 cup of Buttermilk alternating it with the flour. I also made a butter cream icing using 1/2 teaspoon of the flavors used in the cake batter.   It was fantastic.  I've already received requests for several more this coming weekend. In my Opinion this is the best cake recipe ever.  Make sure the ingredients are at room temp and that you mix well.

I just made this today and let me just tell you that it is an awesome recipe.  I did use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour and sifted it twice before I added it to the cream cheese & butter mixture.  I also used 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon extract.  The flavor is perfect and the texture is like velvet.  This recipe is definitely a winner and I will be making this again.

This is a wonderful pound cake. You can do anything to it and it turns out beautifully. I love to add the zest and juice of one lemon. Then glaze with a mixture of icing sugar and lemon juice. Stunning. Thanks for a great great recipe!

Everyone really enjoyed this basic pound cake. I let all of the ingredients come to room temp before mixing as was recommended by other reviewers. I also baked it in a bundt pan, instead of a tube pan, as I saw others had. I would definitely make this again. Thanks for the wonderfully easy and delicious recipe.

Finally...a great pound cake recipe that works! This turned out great. I used room temp ingredients and followed mixing instructions carefully. After adding the flour, I was careful to beat only until well blended. I used an oblong Wilton pan, equivalent to two loaf pans, and cooked until a long wooden skewer was clean. I'm going to try this again, adding lemon extract and a cream cheese glaze. I think it would turn out like the ones you get at Starbucks!

The flavors were good, but my pound cake practically burned on the outside while still being partly raw on the inside.  I would recommend starting this in a cold oven, and lowering the temperature.

Made this pound cake this afternoon. Can't say it was my favorite, however it WAS good. It was a bit dry for my taste. I decided to dress each slice with ice cream, strawberries and whipped cream. Now we're talkin'...
The only changes made were, 1/2 cup less sugar and 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond extract.

This is my go-to pound cake recipe.  I've made it in bundt pans, cupcake tins, and round layers.  always turns out great.  Plus, add a package of butterscotch chips and 1/2 c chopped pecans to make it extra special!

I baked this and followed the instruction exactly....except I had only margarine, which concerned me a bit.  It turned out beautifully...served with fresh fruit and drizzled with cream cheese frosting.  Not one crumb left after the party. Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed the directions exactly, except I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla (2 total). It was very moist and I didn't have the problem of the outside getting overdone before the inside. I used a bundt pan instead of a tube pan- there was A LOT of batter so it rose over the top but still looked pretty inverted. It had a great flavor- it was a little too sweet for me, so I may decrease the sugar next time, but my husband thought it was outstanding.I guess it just depends on your taste. I will definitely be making this again:-)

This is the best pound cake I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using 2 tsp of vanilla extract instead of 1 and I used cake flour instead of regular flour.  The cake was sweet but not too sweet and very moist.  You could definitely taste the cream cheese in it.

DELICIOUS!!! My mom must have said four different times while eating the cake, "this is just such good cake." It has an incredible flavor; I did 2 tsp of vanilla and used reduced fat cream cheese. This is a winner!!!

This pound cake is so good. Very simple but delicious. I tried so many pound cake recipes that were complicated and didn't taste good, then I found this recipe. I've been using this recipe for several years now and it has yet to fail me.

Tasty. Made as called for, but wish I had added a little more flavor- more vanilla or some lemon zest something to take away from the egg flavor. Good base pound cake.

mine came out really dense in the middle. I think next time I make this, I'll use cake flour like someone suggested.  Otherwise it was delish. Thanks!

I have made/eaten lots of pound cakes and this is the BEST yet!!  Cake is very moist.  I added 1 tsp of both lemon and almont extract.  Also made a glaze out of powdered sugar, a little milk, butter and vanilla, lemon and almond extracts.  The cake is actually better the next day and next!!  It seems to get more moist as it sits.  Everyone who has tasted this cake just raves about it!!

Delicious!!!!  As other reviewers stated, work with your ingredients at room temperature. It does make a difference.  I didn't change anything with this recipe, and I wouldn't!  Mine did cook at 325 for 1 hour 20 min. I took it out and let it finish the last 10 minutes out of the oven. It was perfect.  Easy to flip out of the pan if you take the time to spray with some flour spray. So delicious, moist and dense. I will make this again and again when I want a pound cake!

Nice cake with a dense a velvety texture. I made this with Splenda Sugar Blend, and also added of a tsp. of lemon juice. It was done in 1 hr. 15 min. Allowed to cool in pan for about 15 min. and then cooled on the rack. Served with blueberries and cherries. Update: I made this again tonight and did not have enough butter, so I substitued one stick of margerine and it was ruined! I just can't believe one stick out of 3 made such a difference, but it sure did.

I also took the advice of keeping the ingredients room temperature and had no problem with the center being done.  I also reduced the sugar to 2.5 cups as well and added plenty of vanilla.  I think this would be great as part of something else, a trifle, served with fruit or a glaze,etc...on its own it was nothing spectacular.

This was probably the best tasting pound cake I've made.  The edges were good and crispy and the 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp lemon extract was perfect for flavor.  I would have liked it to be slightly moister and will try the buttermilk suggestion next time.

OMG!!! This was beyond yummy! Everyone loved this cake! I added a tsp. each of almond and coconut extract in addition to the vanilla. I also topped it with a lemon/coconut glaze (1 cup powdered sugar, 3Tbl lemon juice, 1 tsp coconut and vanilla extract) YUM!!!! This was also super easy. I followed the advise of others and let the butter, cream cheese and eggs get to room temp.. It was very rich and....well just plain awesome! Thanks for such a great recipe!

This was a pretty good pound cake.... not the best or most moist I've had, but pretty good. The bottom did have a bit of a hard crust but I actually liked that, it almost taste like candy.

This was a great recipe.  We made it just as the recipe stated, except we used lemon extract instead of vanilla.  It was extremely moist and we used it cubed in a wonderful strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry trifle for the 4th of July.

This was the BEST cake that I ever made!! It was so sweet and moist! To increase the moistness I added 1/4 cup of buttermilk. I also added 1 tsp. of lemon extract. I made a glaze with key lime juice and lemon extract. This cake was a wonderful addition to the list of things I can make. I will definitely will be making this again!

AMAZING pound cake!!!!  I made it exactly as written and it was amazing.  Then, I made it with a few alterations based on other reviews and it was HEAVENLY!!!!   I used cake flour instead of all-purpose and added 2 tsp of vanilla extract instead of 1 tsp.  The texture and flavor were SO MUCH better.  Very velvety.    Make sure your cream cheese and butter are at room temperature and that you beat well with the sugar.  Take your time and make sure it's really fluffy.    I've only used loaf pans to make the pound cake.  It will make two pans worth.    Give this recipe a try!  You won't be sorry you did!

This was SO. GOOD. Dense, creamy, and sweet. I made a lemon glaze for topping out of confectioners' sugar and lemon juice; next time I'll do a reduction of raspberries. Definitely a recipe that can be used over and over again and reinvented by what you serve it with.

This is a good recipe but I did follow the suggestions of other users: 1. Use cake flour instead of regular flour 2. use 2 tsps of vanilla 3. add eggs one by one The only "problem" I had was the baking time. I put my oven on 325 but my cake was baking too fast. I dropped the temperature down to 300. That was better but it did take 1 hour and 45 mins to cook :( I used a dark heavy aluminum tube pan. Perhaps that had a lot to do with the cooking time. At any rate the recipe was great and I even had some for breakfast. shhh don't tell anyone :)

Awesome.  A Kitchen Aid mixer is definately needed for mixing this cake.  I used smart balance butter and it turned out great.  I did use 6 eggs, 2 1/2 cups sugar and 3 cups flour.  Used for strawberry shortcakes and the texture was perfect.  Thanks so much for sharing

Now, I hadn't made a pound cake since I was about twelve when I tackled this recipe. I had spent a week sitting at home with a broken collarbone and got the urge to make something despite my one-armed condition. I managed to pull this off beautifully and it was so delicious that I made it again only a few days later (don't worry, I have plenty of boy roommates around who gladly helped me eat!) All agreed that the crust was the best part. The cake is good plain, with ice cream or with strawberries and whipped cream. I followed some of the recommendations such as reducing the heat to 300 and starting in a cold oven. I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and increased the flavoring to 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract. I live at ~7000 ft and didn't have any problems with the cake rising as noted by someone earlier. A wonderful, rewarding choice if broken bones will only allow you one recipe!

Yum!! This is great. I have made it twice now it it was perfect both times. I use a loaf pan instead of a tube, so 1 recipe make 2 loaves baked for 55-65 minutes. Delicious!!!

I baked this cake just to see if it was any good and it was!! I love the crusty pound cake top. It was just like my gram's. The texture was velvety and I added vanilla, butter and nut flavoring and 1 tsp. of flavor enhancer and it was great. I will most definitley make this again.

So good! :)  I did reduce the sugar by about 1/4-cup and would reduce it further next time. Cooked at 325 degrees part of the time, 300 the rest, and would probably cook at 300 the entire time next time to keep it from drying out. Wonderful taste and texture. Thanks!

SO good.  Think next time, though, I'll cut the sugar down by 1 to 1/2 a cup.  Other than that, it was a simple, delicious cake... didn't add any toppings to it.  And the crust on top - to die for!  Thanks for sharing :)

We love this recipe so much, I became a member so that I could review this cake.  My young son, who is generally not a fan of cake (and only devours the frosting at his friend's parties) loves this cake and consistently requests it whenever there is a reason to bake a cake.  I joke that he must take after me, as I am also not much of a cake fan, though I am generally a dessert hound, but I cannot resist this rich and buttery cake.  We generally decorate the cake with fresh berries and whipped cream or powdered sugar.    I discovered this cake after I bought a Nordic Ware train cake pan to bake my son's second birthday cake in.  It comes with a cake recipe that did not work well for me that year.  A friend that's a professional chef recommended looking at this site for a more dense cake.  After much searching and some trial runs, this recipe stood head and shoulders above the crowd.  Though I discovered most of the hints on my own, quite by accident, I ran across this site late in the game that may help others trying to do the same: it's Nordic Ware's "Bake Perfect Bundt" tips. I did find, however, that using regular flour, rather than cake flour to flour the pan actually worked better.  Of course I had to adjust the time, but this recipe couldn't have been better for this purpose.  I'd make it in a regular pan in a heartbeat, though my son would surely be looking for his beloved trains!

I tried this recipe yesterday for the first time and I was scared that it won't turn out good but luckily it did!I followed other reviewers advise to bake it first with a cold oven,I did and it took my cake 2 hours to be done and I had to cover it with foil to prevent too much browning.All in all the only thing that matters is the finished product,which was great!Thanks Nanci for posting this recipe

I baked the cake for 1 1/2 hrs and it still came out a little moist than I would like it. I had wanted a cake like Sara Lee's and although the end product wasn't bad,  it wasn't great. Although not burnt, the crust was crispy and cracked when sliced into it making it not very durable presentation wise. I thought maybe the cream cheese will make this cake stand out somehow but ultimately it did not. Will continue to search for a better recipe.

This makes a ton of cake.  Very good, but very dense.  If you like it rich, this is the recipe for you.  I used it as the base of strawberry shortcake.  It went over well with my family and friends.

Delicious!  I love to bake, though I rarely make pound cakes because they always seem plain to me, but this one was delicious!  I made a chocolate cream cheese version last night with a few alterations as suggested in other reviews. I used 1 1/4 C butter and 1/4 buttermilk as suggested.  I also cut the sugar back to 2 2/3 C.  I made the batter in my stand mixer beating each addition extremely well.  I poured half the batter into my bundt pan and sprinkled with chocolate chips.  Then I mixed 1/4C. unsweetened cocoa powder into the remaining batter to make it chocolate and poured the rest into the pan.  After the first hour of baking I checked it every 10 minutes - I believe it finally took about 1hr. 35min total and was perfect inside.  I frosted it this morning with cream cheese frosting and brought it to work for a co-workers birthday - we've all eaten some for breakfast already! Absolutely delicious - will definitely make again and can't wait to try other variations!

This cake was absolutely wonderful!  I believe that the secret to this recipe is to make sure that your ingredients are at room temperature.  I used my stand mixer, and it was so easy!  This is the only pound cake recipe I'll ever use from now on!

This is my first review ever and I felt the NEED to have to write a review for this super deliouse cake. I've made this cake several times and the past two time i have added chopped walnuts and i made a home made cream cheese frosting that i also found on the website and with those 3 things combined they are AMAZING together. And the cream cheese isn't overpowering in either frosting or cake but it is just right.  LOVE IT... and so did the hubs which he is picky when it comes to cakes.  so go ahead and try it, super easy and blissful.

5 stars, even though it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. I did use cake flour as per another suggestion, and I did use room temp eggs, cream cheese, and butter. I didn't have any trouble with it burning or with it being raw inside, I think those reviewers may not have thoroughly mixed the cream cheese in. Warm cream cheese helps. The trouble I'm having, I guess, is that I'm used to a butter pound cake which is, I think, a bit more rugged and, well, buttery flavored. It IS velvety on the inside and so I probably will make it again when I want to top it with things (like berries & cream, or if I'm dying for a burst of citrus glaze) but for plain old snackin' pound cake, I'm going to have to try again, because this just isn't the same as my grandma used to make :-) But it's darn good!

I made this for a pot-luck at work and drizzled homemade icing on the top and it went faster than the corned beef and cabbage that was the main course.  I used a bundt pan and it baked for longer than one hour but was crunchy on the outside and moist and dense on the inside!

" This was really good" my family loved it and they are picky. Nice and dense the way a "pound" cake should be. It smelled really buttery and was very rich. This truly doesn't need any sauces or icings it is just good on it's own. Thanks a million!!

This was an excellent pound cake!  I used 2 loaf pans.  I baked them for the 1 hour and 20 minutes, although next time I would probably check them after 1 hour and 10 minutes.  It is very important to let all of your cold ingredients to come to room temperature.  Also, I used 2 tsp of vanilla extract but would use some lemon extract next time.  I had people over for dinner and they absolutely LOVED this dessert.  I served sliced strawberries and vanilla ice cream with it.

Came to add my 5 stars to this great recipe.  Using a stand mixer is paramount to getting the right texture to this delicious pound cake.  All ingredients at room temperature is what makes this cake work the best.  I did add 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla but followed all other directions.  This did puff out of my bundt pan when baking and became that crunchy bottom when turned out on the cake plate.  I also had to bake it for 1 hour 50 minutes at 325 degrees, started in a preheated oven.  All said, this is my keeper of a pound cake recipe, it was what I was looking for for both taste and texture.  Next time I think I'll try using two loaf pans instead for the traditional shaping.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I prepared this cake following the recipe with one exception after reading the other reviews, I added another teaspoon of vanilla. The cake was ready after 1 hour and 10 minutes.  This was one of 3 cakes that I baked for Christmas and it was the biggest hit.  Thanks so much for what will be one of my holiday classic recipes!!

I was a little disappointed in this cake after reading all the positive reviews.  I made this cake and followed the instructions to the letter.  I checked it after 1 hour and it wasn't done so I let it go the last 20 minutes. The whole bottom of the cake burned.  I cut off the burned part and ate the rest with ice cream.  It had okay flavor but nothing spectacular.  I will still be searching for the perfect pound cake.

I made this for Christmas gifts and used 6 mini loaf pans.  After the batter was in the pans, I added 2T of Smucker's blackberry or strawberry "Just Fruit" onto the top and worked it into the batter a bit.  I baked them all at one time at 325 degrees F for only 40 mins.  My friends loved them!

I have never made a pound cake before but I wanted to give it a try I am so glad that I picked this recipe it was so easy and I took the cake to work because I knew that the people there would be honest about my first attempt OH MY WORD the cake didn't last long and my supervisor who brings pound cakes that his mom makes said that it was wonderful. I have found my cake now and I have confidence in my pound cake baking abilities.

I've made this cake many times, and my family and friends love it. I had the experience of having pockets that seemed undercooked, but I've been baking it at 300° for a longer time, and that helps. But every time I make it, the top layer of the cake cracks off as it cools. Has anyone else had this experience?I've made it in a bundt pan so that this cracked top becomes the bottom, but it's so frustrating.

This pound cake recipe is great! I also made a few adjustments. I used 4 sticks of butter and 1/4 cup of buttermilk. I beat a minute or so after each egg. (I only had 5 eggs.) Put cake in cold oven and baked for 2 hours at 325 degrees. Wonderful!!!!!!!

The taste of the cake was ok. It took almost two hours to bake - which threw off the rest of my prep for a dinner party. It had a great dense texture. However, the chocolate glaze I used to top it didn't give it enough moisture. If I were to serve this again, I would use a strawberry sauce. It needed something wet to top it off. Everyopne left at least half of it on their plates - which was a bit embarrassing.

I made this cake and turned it into a marble swirl poundcake.  I must say it is the most delicious pound cake I have ever made.  Perfectly baked with a wonderful buttery taste.  I used 2 packets of Nestle Choco Bake premelted chocolate in one cup of the batter and swirled it in with a knife.  Excellent!

ran across this recipe & decided new years--also good excuse to buy the new silicone bakeware--bought bakeware-roundedup ingredients-started-prep easy enough--ive had flu-mind still hazy-a little concerned about filling pan so full (but not much) put in oven-went to lie down--smoke detector--oven on fire-- pan cake smoke boiling-the fire on pan went out immediately-removed from oven- the top of the cake had caught fire & was badly burned-i & afriend(a chef of course)decided to remove the top & see what was under-well it was cake-pulled the pan from side it looked great-upon poking we found at least 2 inches of batter-when the oven cooled we cleaned out the burned mess-turned oven back on put the cake back - NOW 4 HRS LATER- THE CAKE IS ALMOST GONE-IT WAS REALLY GOOD EVERYBODY LOVED IT-I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE also the bakeware the fire didnt hurt it & all i had to do was turn it wrong side out &rinse it so it too is recommended

Mine was complete goo in the middle.  Not sure if it was me or the recipe, so I'll just rate it on how it cooked.  I'll try it again sometime and re-rate it if I have better success.

This was great!! My daughter made it for our county youth fair and won a ribbon.  She did use 2 teaspoons vanilla and 1 tsp of almond extract. Baking time was actually 1 hour 40 minutes.  Wonderfully moist even several days after being cut.

Delicious -- I changed up the recipe a bit by adding a little less sugar and adding 2 tsps of vanilla, 3 tsps of almond extract, and 1 tsp of lemon extract (my friend adds 2 of each but I wanted more almond taste than vanilla).  I thought it was delicious -- reminded me of what my mom used to make.

I took one look at the pic and then knew this was the poundcake for me--DENSE, crunchy crust at the top, and moist, moist moist! This is good, old-fashoined pound cake like you used to get at church bake sales. Don't change anything--you'll ruin it!Although, the next time, I'll use lemon flavoring--I'm just partial to lemon in pound cakes. This is the best---don't overcook! I took mine out after 1 hr and about 10 min--still moist and glistening on top.

A great, easy recipe.  This was my first true pound cake, and what wonderful results--a dense, buttery cake.  I had no problems with "eggy flavor" which some people reported, and the cooking time was fine. Everyone who tried it raved about it and wanted the recipe, which gave me a chance to sing the praises of Allrecipes!

This was definatly over rated.  The reason why I gave it as 2 star is because 3 stars is average and I may use the recipe again.  This recipe I will not use again.  I would try another pound cake recipe.  For me it was way too sweet and it didn't taste buttery, how I like my pound cakes to taste.  Plus it is not worth the calories!  I would much rather eat something else with all those calories and fat!! The one good thing about this cake was that it tastes better as it ages.  Another words wait a couple of days and then serve it.

This is an excellent pound cake, and I would love to be able to cook it correctly.  It has taken a lot longer than it said to cook and it always falls.

How long do you let it cool in the pan before flipping it? Upate: I let it cool for about 15 minutes before flipping it.  OMG. What a great cake. Used the exact ingredients from the recipe and then added about 1/8 tsp. of salt!  It's a great base for strawberry shortcake. I started with room temperature ingredients and really mixed the butter and cream cheese super well before adding each egg and beat it slowly with my old Hamilton Beach mixer  to get more air into the batter.  NO preheating the oven and baked it  just shy of 2 hours at 300 degrees.   Make sure you use the larger bundt pan as it almost baked over the edge.  I checked for doneness with a longer wooden skewer as a shorter toothpick just couldn't  reach to the bottom of the pan.   Update 2: On my second try I baked it in  3 small loaf pans for about 45 minutes on 300 degrees.  Froze 2 of the loaves for later.  The first loaf I sliced and then put in the toaster to heat it up and then served it with strawberries and ice cream.  Really amazing!!!!

Turned out perfect.  I made sure to get the butter, eggs and cream cheese to room temp.  I also checked with a toothpick in several places before taking it out of the oven based on other reviews.  it required an extra 10 minutes in my oven.  Done in some spots but not towards the middle.

Moist and delicious! The only change I made was adding the zest of one lemon and one orange and it tasted exactly like a lemon poppyseed muffin without the poppyseed. I am going to use this recipe for muffins as well. I ended up not making a glaze for this because it was already extremely sweet , and instead I dusted with powdered sugar.

This pound cake is amazing!  Before making it  I read some reviews and am so glad I did!  I made sure my eggs, cream cheese, and butter were at room temperature which is key for this cake.  I also left out the almond extract (personal choice, I hate how it makes cakes taste) and added more vanilla and a dash of salt (also a personal choice).  I get rave reviews when I make this cake.

I made this cake and the only thing I added was some almond extract.  I used Swans Down cake flour  which I like better than all purpose flour, and sifted it first. It was great. My friends loved it and I'm baking it again this weekend!

This was my first attempt at a pound cake. It turned out amazing. Somebody smarter than myself warned me to do all the mixing on low and mix everything very well. I just can't say enough about how good it is.

This cake is a tad too sweet with 3 cups of sugar, but the texture is fabulous!!!!! It was moist and velvety even using AP flour (out of Swans Down).  Next time I will decrease the sugar by a half a cup or so and this cake will be perfect!!! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is so easy to make and the results are outstanding!  My husband said that it tasted better than "Sarah Lee" Pound Cake and to make this more often and serve with whipped cream and fruit.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Cooking the cake at 320 in my oven seemed low. Most of the cakes I have cooked at this temperature drip and are failures.
This cake was firm enough not to drip through the tube pan, however, my cake had a thin layer of wet cake at the top. I followed the recipe completely from beginning to end. The taste of the cake was very good and moist. It could use a little more flavoring and I will have to critique my temperature for my oven.
Overall, the family loved it , even the thin layer of wet cake. I will be baking this cake again and adding it to my Christmas desserts.

So yummy! I made no changes for high altitude, but I did thaw some frozen berries & add them as a layer inside the cake (limiting the juice). Because there are so few ingredients, I’m sure that I can remember it if on some occasion I need a cake & don’t have WiFi to look this up.

Great recipe. Cake was delicious. I should have used 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. I think it would have really brought out the flavor. I sifted the flour to make it easier to beat only beating 2 cups first and then a last cut separate.  I added a white chocolate pecan caramel drizzle. It gives it a more nutty flavor but pairs extremely well with cream cheese and vanilla flavoring. I’ll definitely be making this one again!

We've been making this cake for a couple of years now with only a slight change and everybody has loved it.  We cut the Vanilla to 1/2 teaspoon and added a 1/2 teaspoon of Almond extract.  I agree with others, get your butter to room temperature 1st.

Make sure you touch the skewer after you withdraw it from the cake. It could look clean and still be sticky from an undone cake. Know your oven and your cake pans. Thinnner pans take a little less time. Darker pan can darken the cake's  crust too much. Don't be scared to use a lot of vanilla.

I have made this 6 times without changing anything except added just a little more vanilla. Pound cake should be a little more dense than round cake and I appreciated that about this recipe.

It seems I have to keep this cake in the house at all time. My Mom likes it more than a recipe she's used for over 50 years. I do use cake flour and at least 1 1/2t of vanilla. Room temperature on all ingredients from the fridge as well. Check it at the posted time and don't be surprised when it takes up to a half hour longer. Don't worry, the wait is worth it. I mean, this is basically cream cheese icing with flour baked into it. What's not to love?

I made a few changes. Instead of 1 1/2 cups of butter I used two sticks, Instead of 3 cups of sugar I used 2 cups, Instead of 6 eggs I used 5 eggs, and instead of 1 teaspoon of Vanilla Extract I used 1 teaspoon of Vanilla powder. My family and I adored this pound cake I would definitely make this again.

I have to say, I stopped trying to make cakes from scratch because the results were disappointing. This pound cake was perfect! It tastes exactly like I was expecting and is dense just like a pound cake should be. Like others suggested, I started with room temp eggs, cheese and butter and I used cake flour. I added a little more vanilla. I forgot to check it at an hour as the recipe was written but it was perfectly done at 1 hr 20 minutes. This is a great cake to serve with berries and whipped cream. It would also hold up in a chocolate fondue. I can’t wait to make it again!

I added 1 teaspoon concentrated lemon.  Used a tube pan prepared with cooking spray and lined the bottom with parchment paper also sprayed with cooking spray.  Baked as the recipe said, preheated 350 oven for 1 hour.  Checked for doneness with a toothpick and found it was not done in the center so baked another 15 minutes and it was perfect.  Let cool 5 minutes and loosened cake by sliding a knife up and down between the cake and the sides of the pan and also around the middle tube.  Was easy to remove cake from the pan and it looked beautiful.  Served as strawberry shortcake desert.  Very happy with the results and will definitely make this cake again.

My first cake. Ever. Absolutely fantastic. I did substitute cake flour and I reduced the sugar to only 2.5 cups  ( still was very very sweet. Will try just 1.5 cups the next time). I also added the extra baking powder and salt suggested by another user. Started with a cold oven. Just wanted to add - I used PAM oil+flour spray to oil and flour my pan / plus cake four - and i think it made all the difference since my crust was EXTREMELY amazing !!!! 
With fresh cream and strawberries - big hit !

This recipe was really nostalgic for me because it took me back to my childhood enjoying my father's pound cakes. I have made this recipe a few times now and my family loves it.  I made it tonight and it came out so light and fluffy. I did add fresh lemon juice and zest to give it a little extra flavor. So good !!

Only pound cake that I've made that was actually moist!  Very good.  Served with strawberries and whipped cream.  It was just as good without toppings.  I'll make this one again.

This cake is heavy, dense, sweet, and REALLY GOOD. Don’t overbake it!  It will be done at 1 hour 20.  I got worried based on reviews and baked it for 10 more minutes... wrong thing to do.

I think it is important to mention that each pound cake is to be followed closely, even when using the same recipe. The process could've been explained more, but YouTube really helped. The first time I made it, it was a brick. I  didn't know what to do to remedy it. It was dry as you know what. Let me tell you a secret, if you cook too long do a butter sauce like making Kentucky butter cake, leave in  Bundt pant, and pour in with cake while cooling on  wire rack. If oven is off, you fluffed the butter longer or added additional liquid, you need to tweak prep and baking time. I have made this cake on a number of occasions, but I've tweaked it to a science. I followed the traditional more sugar, more flour pound cake but added three sticks of butter and some buttermilk. Always use room temp ingredients and cream butter and cream cheese together for ten minutes, an additional five after adding sugar slllllllloooooowwwwly and bake at 325 for about an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. Not a bad cake, but I made three before it went the right way.

I don’t know if I over mixed it but it tasted like overly sweet cake.  It didn’t taste like pound cake and not sure if you’re supposed to taste the cream cheese bc that didn’t happen either.

My experience was the same as Michelle Knee Talley from a few years back except that I had cooked it an extra 15 min. as the pick was still coming out doughy.  After the additional time, the pick came out clean so I took it out to cool.  When I cut into it, GAH!, it was still very doughy inside.  What a waste of a LOT of ingredients as it had to go in trash.

I've been baking since I was 10 years old. I don't mess up cakes or anything else. This recipe is awful. The cake broke and started dripping down into the oven (thank goodness I keep a pan in my oven or I would have one hell of a clean up). I upped the temp so the cake would cook faster, and two hours later the cake is still dripping and raw inside. The part of cake that dripped into the pan below is also still raw.

I was trying to find a recipe to use up some extra cream cheese, and I chose this one. I read lots of the reviews and read about lots of changes made to the recipe. I was going to make some changes too, but decided I couldn't properly review this recipe if I made those changes. I followed the recipe exactly, and I love the results. I did have to bake it for 1 hour 40 minutes, but that's the only difference.
I feel like I can't stop eating this cake--it is super good. It is moist and has a somewhat chewy texture. I will definitely make this again in the future without altering the recipe.

This was a dense and delicious pound cake. My only change would be to add a pinch of salt to the batter. It baked for 1 hour and 20 minutes. No glaze required.

Amazing, thank you for sharing! My changes were about a 1/2 cup less sugar (not much of a sweet tooth here) and a tsp each of lemon and orange zest because I love those flavors in cake. As per other review tips, used cake flour  (1 cup flour - 1 tbsp + 2 tbsp corn starch sifted 6 times) and it came out velvety and not as dense. The key is the beating; about 6 mins for butter/cheese, 5 mins for sugar and 3 mins for eggs. The longer it was beat, the fluffier it got. I mixed in the flour by hand and put the cake into a cold oven. Yummy!

I've made this several times now and it is truly an excellent base recipe! I'm not usually crazy over pound cake but this one is delicious and always disappears quickly. In addition to the Vanilla extract I also add almond extract and butter extract. The flavors meld incredibly well! I also will typcially make a glaze for this cake however it is certainly not required. Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe! Very moist, very delicious. Thank you. Based on multiple reviews, reduced the sugar quantity to 2 cups.

One more modification would be to increase the vanilla essence to at least 1.5 tsp if not 2 tsp (1 tsp vanilla essence is a little too less for the number of eggs that goes into this recipe).

Awesome Pound Cake! Made it as written and served it with lemon sauce. Everyone raved about it! I would like to try adding orange or lemon extract next time. The crumb and texture are perfect, just like a pound cake should be, rich and dense but not heavy. 
Took about 15 minutes longer to bake than the recipe stated, and it did not sink. It rose very high and stayed that way even after cooling. 
There are no directions for cooling the cake, so I cooled in the pan for 15 minutes before removing. I used a tube pan, or better known as an Angel Food Cake Pan. Had no problem with sticking either, generously greased and floured. 
This will be my permanent pound cake recipe, it is perfect in every way.

I made it according to the recipe, but I also included other poster's suggestions:
-used 2c of sugar instead of 3
-started in a cold oven. I cooked it for  90 minutes.
It was fantastic!

I cooked this cake for 1 1/2 hours and it was raw in the middle.  Toothpick came out clean but the middle was raw.  I had to run to store and buy some pound cakes for my dessert for company. I will not make again.

I was a little challenged cooking in a high altitude.. previous cakes just crumbled. This cake is one of my faves so I made the following adjustments to adapt to the altitude of 7000 feet. I added one extra egg and a tablespoon of coconut oil. Cranked the heat down to 300 degrees and after 40 minutes kept a very watchful eye on it to be sure the outside didn't burn. The knife test was coming clean but the center looked like it needed a few more minutes. I have done this with brownies before to make sure they don't over cook. Turn the heat off on the oven and leave the cake in another 15 minutes. The center will continue to cook and the outside won't get any darker. I also had some strawberries that were starting to get a little mush so I chopped them up and threw in a cup of those as well... Mission accomplished. Cake is delish!

Moist and delicious, one of the best cakes I've ever made! Next time I may cut back on the sugar a bit as the cream cheese contains a fair bit on its own.

This was very good and extremely easy to make.  Having made lots of pound cakes before, I upped the vanilla to 1 tablespoon (glad I did) and added a bit of freshly squeezed lemon juice. And a few tablespoons of sour cream.  Mine took every bit of an hour and 20-25 minutes and was perfectly baked (cake tester came out almost clean.). There was a lot of batter and I thought it might have overflowed in the oven, but it rose perfectly and looked beautiful.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the great, easy recipe.

Awesome! I love heavy pound cake. And it was  super easy to make. If you're an amateur like me, don't be scared by how thick the batter is and it may not pour like normal. Scoop it into your bundt pan. Im making another one today.

It is a very expensive cake to make, not soft or moist at all.;  I only used 2 cups of sugar and added extra vanilla like revies said and almond extract and it was still bland.  Will not make again.

No calories here! But this pound cake is worth the splurge. I made it in a large bundt cake pan and baked it for just over an hour. The outside ended up golden and crispy while the middle stayed soft and fluffy. This cake is so buttery and delectable, it practically melts in your mouth. I served it with farmers market berries to help balance out the sweetness. Betcha this cake would be really good with a bit of lemon juice mixed in the batter.

This is the best pound cake recipe I've ever tasted.  The outside is buttery and sugary and the inside is moist and fluffy all at the same time.  It is a texture dance on the tongue.  My husband said that he found himself going after the crust first and then indulging in the middle.  I baked it according to instructions exactly, (with the exception of an added 1/2 tablespoon of lemon extract because we to have a hint of lemon to offset the vanilla flavoring.) Used a dark bundt pan and it took about 1 hour 45 min to perfection. LOVE IT!

This cake is a winner and it is easy and quick! I've made this several times and shared it with family and friends. Every one loves it, no complaints from anybody.  
Even if you think you can't bake give this a try. It is a real confidence booster.

This recipe is the original recipe for Sara Lee Pound cake. The only difference is that Sara Lee uses powder sugar instead of white sugar and no cream cheese. It changes the texture a little to a softer texture. INCREDIBLE recipe. My favorite!!!!!

I made this recipe using some of the modifications suggested by other. I decreased the sugar to 2.5 cups and added 1/4 cup buttermilk. The crumb was tender and dense, and the flavor was subtle. I did have a hard time telling if it was done, and ended up over baking it a bit. I don't know that you really need to wait for a the toothpick to come out clean. Its probably fine if the crumbs are not wet and you've been baking for over an hour. It will keep baking a bit in the pan after you remove it from the oven. I will probably make this again.

This is an amazing pound cake! It is incredibly dense and heavy, yet delicate and moist.  The top or bottom of the cake, whichever way you think of it, is crunchy and buttery.  In fact, it is so pretty and so good that I hated to hide it when I turned the pan onto the plate. 

I followed the recipe as written with two small changes.  First, i sifted the regular flour twice, and second, I used a tablespoon of lemon flavoring and a healthy squirt of concentrated lemon juice and omitted the vanilla flavoring.  

I used a portable electric mixer until it was time to add the flour.  At this point, I mixed in the flour and lemon flavorings by hand, because the batter just seemed too thick and heavy for my portable mixer.

I followed the directions of baking the cake at 325 degrees for an hour and 20 minutes.  After an hour I turned on the oven light and took a look at the cake through the door.  It was obvious the cake was not ready.  I waited the final minutes and tested the cake.  It was still doughy.  I set the timer for an extra 20 minutes and tested it again.  It was lightly brown and showed no sign of  wet dough when I inserted the knife.  After cutting into the cake, I believe the cake would have been absolutely perfect if I had baked it an additional 15 minutes rather than 20.  Still, this cake is still perfect as far as I'm concerned. 

I will be making this cake again -- probably sooner than later because I don't believe it will last long at all.  Next time, I think I wil

Halved the recipe and followed it exactly. Cake turned out great! Good texture, rich and tasty. A little too sweet for my personal taste, but others were happy with it. Also my cake ended up with a crispy top layer which was actually kinda added to the texture the cake more fun to eat (suspect it's due to oven being too hot).

The batter was foamy and almost souffle-ish because of all of the eggs. And so sweet my teeth hurt. I cooked it way over the recommended time and it still didn't set in parts. And it tasted very strongly of eggs and cream cheese.

This cake was great.  I used cake flour instead of all purpose as suggested by my friend who makes this cake. I also used a homemade cream cheese icing  to drizzle over it.  Took my time mixing everything. Baked on 300 in my over for 1 hr 45 minutes.
Next time let butter, cream cheese & eggs sit at room temp and  use 1 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.

I honestly have no idea what went wrong. First off I'm not sure what the texture of the cake is supposed to be. I literally just took mine out the oven after an hour and nearly 40 minutes (used a butter knife to determine that it wasn't done the 1st time I took it out). Not only was it not done though, the consistency was that of a regular cheesecake! 20 minutes later and the top is browner, but the knife is still full of softness. Previous reviewers did the toothpick test and had dry toothpicks (otherwise I'd assume that it just needed cooled down. I'm so sad..

Simply divine!  In place of all-purpose flour, I used cake flour, adding an additional 2 tablespoons per cup called for.  This made for a silken, velvety texture.  Instead of vanilla extract, I used 2 teaspoons of almond extract (maybe a titch more of a splash) that sent this one over the edge delicious!  Without modification, this cake will turn out great anyway.  Some of us just have to put our own touch on things.  I would suggest any type of a fruit garnish with a dollop of fresh whipping cream.  Hopefully there will be some left so I can take my own advice.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe made a wonderful shortcake! With fresh strawberries and fresh whipped cream it is to die for. As per other reviews I added 1/4 cup of buttermilk which really made the cake moist. I also added a dash of lemon extract along with the vanilla because I prefer a slight lemon taste. This cake is quite dense, but it is so moist and delicious and pairs well with just about any fruit or is just great by itself!

Very good cake, took about an hour and 45 min in my oven but worth the wait.  Reduced sugar to 2.5 cups and made sure butter, cream cheese and eggs were at room temp.

This is my go to cake recipe for everything. My daughter requests it for every birthday, because it 'owns any store bought cake'. Sometimes I make cupcakes and they are awesome as well. I'm still searching for the perfect topping...

I read both good and bad reviews for this recipe. I added a capful of butter flavoring and a half a capful of lemon flavoring. Other than those two additions I followed the recipe for ingredients. I read another reviewers suggestion to place the batter in to a cold oven, and did this as well. My cake is tasty and cooked through. I will make this again!

The part of the cake that was done was tasty, however, I found the cooking time was a bit off.  I followed the baking time to a "T", however, when I went to cut and serve it, half of the inside had patches of areas that were not completely done. Wasn't too pleased with only being able to serve half pieces to my quests.  Will try again though and just bake it a little longer.

I was so disappointed in this pound cake! I baked it for 1 hr 30 min. and the tester came out clean.  It looked beautiful, came out of the pan perfectly and then collapsed into a wet, dense mound of dampness.  I couldn't even salvage it for trifle.  Such a shame.

I don't know why - habit, I suppose - but I always mix my cakes up with a hand mixer...even though I FINALLY got the stand mixer of my dreams.  Like I said, it must be habit.  Well, my hand mixer died and I was in the mood to make this cake.  Like nearly everyone else, I used Swan's Down Cake Flour instead of All Purpose (just too lazy to sift, resift, reresift, etc.) and my stand mixer.  What a difference the stand mixer made in my pound cakes.  I've always had delicious 5 Pound Cakes (they're THAT heavy, dense).  This came out like a Cloud Cake (that beautifully light, airy) and I honestly believe the improvement in the texture made it taste even better.  So, the recipe gets 5 stars because, well, YUMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!! but as a footnote I will say, if you have to save $1 a week for 4 years, it's worth it a thousand times over to have a good stand mixer when making this or any other cake.

Awesome! Even more awesome when turned into Pineapple Cream Cheese Pound Cake. Use 1 can chunk pineapple, drained,  add 3 T pineapple juice (delete vanilla) for the cake.  Frost with Pineapple cream cheese frosting: 1/4 C butter, 8 oz cream cheese, 3 Cups confectioners sugar, 3 T Pineapple Juice, 1 can crushed pineapple (drained well)

I've made this cake about 8 times. I've followed others' suggestion to place the cake in a cold oven and start the timer when the temperature comes up to 325 degrees F. This will help with the middle of the cake cooking through. Also making sure that all of the ingredients are room temperature (not cold from the fridge) also helps to set the cake. The last several times, I've cut the sugar to 2 Cups and substituted half the flour with almond meal. It came out to be very rich and slightly marzipany. More importantly, my Type I Diabetic mother-in-law said that this "modified" recipe does not spike her blood sugar. It's delicious both ways.

Absolutely delicious! This is my 1st attempt at making a pound cake in over 10 years and it was so gooood!  I tried in the past and failed miserably.  This is a great recipe.  I took several suggestions from others that commented.  I used cake flour instead of regular/enriched flour and I used 2 tsp. of vanilla flavoring instead of 1.  Even with the increase in vanilla flavoring, the cake was not too sweet.  All of the ingredients were room temperature.   I thoroughly mixed ingredients at each step before moving to next step (I spent several minutes at each step).  I think this is SUPER IMPORTANT.  Taking your time in blending the ingredients will deliver a SUPERB cake.  Also I baked the cake for 1 hour 40 minutes instead of 1 hour 20 minutes.  The cake was not quite done at I hr 20 min.  My oven must bake slow…This recipe is definitely a keeper.     I can now honestly say that this IS the BEST POUND CARKE I EVER MADE AND TASTED!

I don't know if I baked it for too long but mine came out a tad bit dry? Anyway, me & my mom LOVED this! We cut our slices, & poured milk over it, TO DIE FOR. Fatty, but very worth it indeed.  Thank you for sharing!

After reading some reviews I was worried that it wouldn't be cooked all the way through, but I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using only 2.5 cups of sugar and I only had Neufchatel (lower fat cream cheese) on hand so that's what I used.  I lost track of time and may have baked it for an extra 10 minutes, but it was perfect and delicious!  I served it with home made whipped cream and mixed berries.

I made some adjustments. I added 1/2 tsp. of baking powder, 1 tbsp. of vegetal shortening (Crisco) and 1 1/2 tbsp. lemon extract. My bunt pan is 9" diameter so I decided to reduced the amount of flour to 2 3/4 of all purpose flour and the same with sugar. Mine was done at 55 minutes. I just have to say that it was more than I expected baking a pound cake. Dense, velvet, moist and with a great taste. This is a very versatile recipe. You just add the extract you want and thats it. If you want to make a chocolate pound cake just use 2 1/4 flour and add 3/4 baking chocolate and 1/2 tsp baking powder. I recommend this little adjustments I've made because it was the best pound cake I've ever tasted. So I give 5 stars with the adjustments.

I had to review this after recently trying a different recipe for the first time in years. I was making a poppy seed pound cake recipe and decided not to substitute this in for the basic cake part of the recipe. Mistake. It was actually great, but nothing compares to this recipe. It's phenomenal. I don't change a thing other than occasionally adding orange or lemon zest.

This was my second attempt at making a pound cake. My first attempt failed miserably(not this recipe). I did make two changes, cake flour for regular flour and added lemon extract.Everyone loved it. It dissappeared  in a matter of minutes,with the last piece being fought over. Will definitely be holding on to this recipe.

Love this recipe!! I used 1.2 cup butter and 1 cup crisco and it was perfect. Let everything get to room temp before mixing. Did preheat the oven. Had to cook the cake at 325 for almost 2 hours though. Came out perfectly! Excellent taste! Added vanilla extract and alittle almond as well.

Amazingly good. I made it with 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 1/2 tsp lemon extract the second time and it was great. I used an electric hand mixer and mixed 1 to 2 minutes between each egg. I also made sure the butter and cream cheese were room temp. Great recipe!

Words can't express how delicious this cake was! This is a very easy and inexpensive cake to make for gifts, parties and bake sales. I also added a lemon glaze made with fresh lemon and confectioners sugar.

Just like my Mom used to make...before she lost her recipe in Hurricane Katrina!  So delicious my friends wanted me to make and sell them a cake and my Mom asked for the recipe!  An added note, I baked it at a slightly lower temp for a longer time.

This was very good! I didn't have any problems with this cake. My sister said it was the best pound cake ever! I used whipped cream cheese and I think that made it even better.

This produces a very dense and delicious pound cake.  It took much longer than the 1hr 20min to cook - closer to 2 hours, and it still wasn't completely cooked inside (just small patches).  I love the crunchy exterior this makes. Very easy to make.

Love this! I have only ever made the 7up pound cakes before this, and I think this is even better! Very old school, down home flavor. I followed the directions exactly, added 1/2 tsp almond extract and used cake flour instead of all-purpose because I had it on hand and I know it makes cakes very velvety. I did start with room temp butter, cream cheese, and eggs, a must to get the best texture. The change I would make, is maybe 1/2 cup less sugar next time, it is pretty sweet and I would like it a little less so that I can add a glaze.

I have been looking for a fool proof pound cake simple recipe, and finally found success. I would use more vanilla extract. The second time I made the recipe, I remembered it, and did not have to look back upon the recipe. This is a keeper!

Very simple recipe, I love it! I made sure the cream cheese, butter and eggs were at room temperature. Mixed them well. I didn't have cake flour so I found a recipe for cake flour substitute, it involved a lot of sifting. I have no idea if it was worth it. I baked for 1hr10min but will try a tad less next time. The outside was golden brown and was probably the best part of the cake! But I felt the inside was just a tad too overdone. I will make this recipe again, but will try it with actual cake flour and will decrease the sugar by half a cup. I will still try another version after that until it's perfect to my taste. GREAT BASE RECIPE THOUGH!!!

I took others advice and increased the vanilla a little bit.  I should have decreased the sugar because it was very, very sweet.  I will try this again with less sugar.  I hope that helps because if not I would probably not make this again.  I'm giving 4 stars because it was easy to make and the people I served it too enjoyed it very much.

CAN I ADD MORE STARS?! Because I would!
I read the reviews.  Honestly thought, with as few ingredients this just can't be THAT good.  I followed the recipe and baked 1 hour 20 minutes in a bundt pan.  I took it out of the pan and immediately thought this looks hard & dry.  BUT, when I tried it...I realized this cake is dangerous!  I loved it.  It's great on its own and with berries and whip cream ...it's heaven! (my opinion!!)  It is heavy and sweet...so just a small piece goes along way!

Fantastic, just the way it says it is! Well, actually, I added more vanilla, but I usually do to everything I bake. Just make sure you beat the sugar in really well, or you'll get an odd flaky sugar-crust bubble...and that isn't even that bad really; it still tastes fantastic and the cake underneath is superb!

This is the best pound cake recipe I've found.  I've tried a lot of them, but this one is moist inside with a crunchy top.  It is stays moist for a long time.  It also freezes nicely.

Oh my Goodness, what a great pound cake!  I made no substitutions. I made a double batch in which I made a 16"inch cake x 4". The base size for a wedding cake, it was awesome.   I had to cook it a lot longer due to the size, but to my amazement it was not dry. The cake got rave reviews from the guests.  I will continue to use this recipe based on the compliments. Great  cake for weddings, bridal showers and baby showers.

Well... I don't know if it was just my stove, but I mad this for Thanksgiving and it was pretty bad. Then again it could have been my stove. But It was done about 1 inch from the outside but everything else was like chewy grossness. Almost a fudge like texture. Nothing ike the picture. I am really thinking my fault due to I followed the instructions EXACTLY and didn't work. And this recipe has great reviews. Worth a shot ...

I made this as cupcakes and as a loaf (for anyone curious this recipe will make 12 cupcakes + 1 loaf). I have to admit it is exactly as described, but it is a little on the dry side and lacking something. I think the other reviewers suggestions of adding the buttermilk are a really great idea. I will def. keep this recipe but tweak it a little next time. Also, this is really dense and would be perfect for fondue.

I think I just added a little extra vanilla and that was it.  I bake it for an hour at 325 and it's perfect. Lovely brown crust. This cake was gone within 2 days in my house. Thanks for sharing- will use again.

I did not change a thing on this recipe and it turned out awesome!  Everyone at work loved it and wanted the recipe!!  I did set the cold ingredients out and let them get to room temp, but no additions or tweaking at all.  Will be making another one this weekend for the family!!

This is my absolute favorite pound cake recipe!  I have been making this cake for years and have played around with the flavoring/extracts used in the recipe.  My favorite combination is 1tsp. each of vanilla, lemon, orange, almond, pineapple, coconut, & banana flavoring/extracts.  Try it or any combination of the above and you will have a winner every time.

I made 2 of these today.  The first one got started in a cold oven and did not raise as much as the second one in a hot oven, crust was the same, so I don not think there is any truth to the suggestion to start in a cold oven.  The tooth pick test did not work for this cake.  The toothpick came out clean but  the cake needed an extra 15 minutes.  You will just have to trust the time.  I prefer the sour cream  pound cake on this site.

It was the first time I made a pound cake, and luckily it came out great. It lacked the golden color i was hoping for but from the inside it was very dense and it had a rich buttery taste. I used cream cheese which had a hint of blue cheese in it, all the while dreading the fact that the smell of blue cheese might be overpowering but contrary to what I thought it came out meticulously. Next time I'll use regular cream cheese to mark the difference. Yup, I'll definitely make this again!

SOOOOO MOIST and DENSE!!!! This was so delicious!!! I made it parve/non-dairy - so used toffuti cream cheese instead of regular creamcheese. I used Earth's Balance Margarine in place of the butter I increased the vanilla to 2.5 tsps. I took other's advice and made an attempt at adding nondairy 1/4 cup buttermilk - by using 1 tbsp lemonjuice and added soy milk to make that into 1/4 cup.  I poured 1/2 the batter into the bunt pan, added about 12-15 chopped nondairy oreos, and poured the remaining batter on top. Baked for about 1hour, 10 minutes (maybe will do 5 minutes less next time). When cooled, flipped ity out and drizzled a nondairy cream cheese frosting on top and sprinkled it with chopped oreo's - the cake was finished in just minutes of serving it!!!

This is exactly the type of pound cake I was looking for. Dense, moist, and yummy! I kept finding myself (and everyone else) sneaking back to the kitchen for another slice..Before I knew it half the ring of cake was gone LOL Definitely worked perfectly with the suggested changes. Used 2 tsp of vanilla extract, made sure the the eggs, cream cheese & butter were room temperature. Also, don't preheat your oven, put the cake in a cold oven and turn on to 325, bake for 1 1/2 hours. Was perfect sweetness for adding icing, but I left that off because I'm not fond of it on pound cake and it was good enough without it.

This was very good. I am not giving it five stars because I think it could have been richer and more flavorful. But for a simple, basic pound cake recipe it was good.

Excellent Tasting. However, I made 3 mini loaves and 1 regular. My mini loaf pans are silicone and the outsides of the cakes and especially the bottom came out very dark and burned. As did the regular size metal pan, however less dark. I would recommend lowering the oven temp. and lengthening the time baking! Very great though, will make again!

This recipe is phenomenal. I followed the reviews of others and added more vanilla. I didn't make any other changes. I did think the cake came out a tad too sweet, but it depends on how sweet people like their cakes. The cake was perfect with french vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and strawberries!

I'm giving it 5 stars even though it did not turn out perfectly for me.  I made 1/2 a recipe and baked it in a loaf pan, taking others suggestion to increase vanilla and I also added a little almond extract. I baked it at 300 for 1 hour 15 min. after I took it out of the oven  to cook the center sank down and the cake did not seem to be done in the middle so I put it back in the oven. The center never did seem to get baked completely even after quite a bit of time in the oven. The outer crust was great and the flavor was great! I'm going to try and make this again, only using smaller pans and baking at the 325 the recipe calls for.

This is one of my family favorites. I also change it up a little I add 1 teaspoon of almond extract besides the vanilla. It's my secret ingredient!! I guess it's not a secret anymore!! I also add my ingredients one at a time blending between each egg and each 1/2 cup of flour.

This was a great recipe. It tastes much better the next day. I put a glaze on top 1/4 c sprite and1/2c white sugar, melt it on the stove top until the sugar dissolves. poke holes in the cake and pour over it. THis would have been 5 stars, but it still was not as moist as I  had hoped for. A great recipe until I find the right one.

Added the 1/4 cup of buttermilk as suggested.  This is a very good pound cake.  Just be sure to not to over bake it so it won't be dry.

This is a very delicious and flavorful cake.  If you are looking for a soft moist cake- this is not the one you want to try.  But for a traditional POUND cake, this is the perfect recipe. I made this one morning before the kids woke up for school, and my 5yr old was so excited by the smell, he had a slice toasted for breakfast (with milk of course!) It's been a hit at my house every since. I too use both vanilla and almond extracts because I love the blended flavors. A little sweet. But I wouldn't reduce the sugar by more than 1/2 cup. I have made this one a permanent pound cake in my home. Thank you Nanci for sharing.

Phenomenal!!  You know how most birthday cakes sorta get ignored?  They are *ok* but not a treat?  Not this one!  This is one of the few times the cake went faster than the ice cream at my daughter's birthday party.  She chose this cake, with a chocolate ganache and sliced strawberries.  It was wonderful that way, but to be honest, it was as good or better completely plain!

I don't know if I would call this cream cheese pound cake although its a pretty good pound cake. I couldn't really taste the cream cheese in it...When it says a heavy and dense pound cake they are not lying...This thing weighed a ton. Good flavor, although I ended up with some type of strange crunchy crust on the top, not sure where that came from. I scraped it off and the actual cake was somewhat moist although not as much as I thought it would be. I did add additional vanilla along with some lemon and almond extract. I don't think I'll make this again. It was a lot of work for something not quite as moist as I wanted it...

Perfect. I've been looking for a good pound cake worthy of gifting to others and This Is It!  It really does have a velvet texture and melts in your mouth. With that said, we know that 100 people can prepare the same recipe and it is possible for each and every one to have different results. Happy Baking!

To all of those who are having a dry cake...I have made this a couple of times now and the first time I cooked it as directed (325 degrees) and got a crust that was too done in some places and an inside that was dry in some places and not done in others.  I reduced the temperature to 300 and cooked it for 1 hr 35 minutes and it came out perfectly moist and the crust was just right! I also rotated the cake every 20-25 minutes. Oh I also added the eggs one at a time. Perfect!

Excellent.  I followed a lot of reviewers' advice.  I whipped the heck out of everything and all ingredients were room temp.  I think I baked it about 1 hour and 25 or 30 mins.  I served it with a raspberry rhubarb sauce (2 stalks chopped rhubarb, 2 pints raspberries boiled with 1/2 cup water, 1 cup sugar, 2 tbsp arrowroot).

Like everyone else has said, this is a great cake recipe, and was loved by everyone who had it.  I used a large spring-form tin instead of a tube pan - this required slightly more than 2 hours of cooking before it came out right.  After the first 1:20 I took the heat down to 125C and covered the top with foil, checking every 20 minutes until the toothpick test came out clean.  The result was fantastic!

Wonderful! Topped it with homemade whipped cream, raspberry sauce, strawberries & blueberries. Took almost 2 hours to bake in a bundt pan.

I made this for my wife and it was VERY good!  I also left the butter and cream cheese out to soften for a couple hours.  Tossed in some mixed berries (I wouldnt recommend whole strawberries).  Only thing wrong with the recipe is the bake time...I would recommend 1 1/2 hours at 325.  Came out great!!

The taste is awesome, but mine didn't set up properly.  I had all my ingredients at room temp, and whipped it all up with my KichenAid, so I really don't know what went wrong.  My toothpick came out clean at 1hour20min, but when I cut it this morning, it clearly needed more time.  I will attempt this again some day!

I made this for friends, served with blueberries and fresh whipped cream, and it was a big hit. I followed the recipe except for the addition of a teaspoon of almond extract for a little more flavor and a quarter teaspoon of baking powder.  I sifted the flour three times as recommended by another reviewer.  No one thought it was too sweet.

This is now my FAVORITE cake EVER!! I increased the vanilla to 2t and the baking time to 1.5 hours (or basically until the outside of the cake looked DONE.) I can't believe how tasty this is. And the texture! Pure heaven.

This was delicious! However, all of the batter wouldn't fit in my tube pan. I had to put the leftover batter into a loaf pan. So I got a whole tube pan cake as well as a small (it was only filled 1/2 way) loaf pan pound cake. It was raved over! Thank you so much! I will be using this recipe over and over again!

I scaled to half, but added double the vanilla, and baked in a cupcake pan for individual cakes :) Perfect for strawberry shortcakes!

Superb! This is the first pound cake I have ever made and it turned out exceptional! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding lemon flavoring along with the vanilla. I also topped it with a simple lemon glaze made from powdered sugar and lemon juice. I didn't ice it completely, just drizzled it over the cake. It added pops of lemon flavor here and there. I tasted the cake prior to drizzling the glaze and it was equally as good without it. This is a wonderful recipe, that presents a moist flavorful cake. I love it!

I made this for a dinner party, and drizzled over it an white chocolate orange sauce. It was pretty good that night, but DELICIOUS the following days. If you are making it for an event I suggest making it a day or two before and just keeping it covered.  My only complaint is that it took MUCH longer than the recommended time to cook. I made sure my ingredients were room temperature, but maybe my house is a little cooler than it should be and the items were too cold. Either way though it ended up delicious.

Wonderful, simple and easy.  Made it for a dinner at Church and it was a great hit.  Hard to compete with those church ladies' deserts but this one did it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  A keeper indeed.  Didn't change a thing!

This recipe was good, and turned out well.  I smelled so good while i was baking it, but I thought it was a little dry.  It was definately not over cooked, but maybe that's just pound cake.

Flavorful and moist.  So delicious.  Will definitely make again.  I cut the bundt cake in half.  On the bottom half I put home made whipped cream icing evenly spread then topped with sliced strawberries.  On the top half i put whipped cream on it and put them together.  Entire cake has whipped cream icing covering it.  Everyone loved it.  So yummy!

I made this cake for out Preference Night for our sorority.   Everyone raved about it and the new girls said they'd join just so they could have this cake again! I am more of a critic of my own cooking so I only gave this a 4 because I thought there was something missing, but I just can't put my finger on it.... but there was none left at the end for me to take home so that was a plus!

I left the cake longer and it still did not cook all the way through, the center was runny...  The cake tasted good but I was not overly impressed.  It needs a little more vanilla.

Excellent!  I didn't change a thing.  It rose above my bundt pan, to make a crunchy layer.  The inside was moist and perfect!  I will surely make this again!

I've also been using this recipe for years, but with a lot more vanilla flavoring and I also add lemon extract. This is, in fact, the best and easiest pound cake recipe I have found so far.

I guess I was hoping for an allstar cake after seeing all the 5 stars.  The batter was sooo delicious we should have just eaten it raw. I had to bake for 1 hour 40 minutes in order to cook thoroughly, therefore the outside crust (that touched the pan) was burnt :(.  Still warm, it tastes way too sugary...but the next day it is quite good.  Perfect texture, husband loved it, daughter said it tasted like egg.  If the whole crust could taste like the crunchy top (or really the bottom when taken out of the flute pan)it'd be fabulous. We had to eat cut off the crust. I added the extra vanilla.

I will try to bake again reducing heat part way through, or bake in multiple loaf pan making cakes not too tall/thick to avoid burning.

Just took this out of the oven.  I used this recipe to make 2 loaves, which were slightly brown and crunchy on the outside, and perfectly textured inside - dense, but still light, if that makes sense.  Thanks for this keeper!( I did increase vanilla to 2 tsp.)

I only have an electric hand-mixer, not a stand mixer, but I was able to blend the cheese/butter/egg/sugar until it was as fluffy as could be, no difficulties there.  This recipe is indeed delicious, I doubled it & made 4 mini-loaves, baked them first, then 2 regular-size loaves & baked them together, so as not to have to open the oven too many times..unfortunately I dropped one of the large loaves while poking it with a skewer, so my hubby got to have what was left as a warm treat with ice cream right away!  Served it with a rum-soaked fruit compote a friend gave us for Christmas, unbelievable.  This recipe will be a favourite for many years to come...& the whole house smells fantastic!  Even the neighbours commented as they walked past!

Oh my goodness. This is heaven!!  I wasn't going to review because I made two changes.  But this smelt so good I just had to try it before it was even cool, and it is the best thing ever.  The changes I made was to add 1/4 tsp salt and instead of 1 tsp vanilla I added 2.  It is SO good and I am so glad I made it for Christmas to take to my in-laws!!  Maybe I'll finally impress them with something!

I made this cake just to make a cake and it was a hit with my co-workers and my daughters friends. I even have some co-workers willing to pay me to make this cake for them for the holidays.I read all the reviews and made a few changes. i really didn't care for the cake flour so next time I will use all purpose flour. 
I added an extra stick of butter and 2 tspns of pure almond extract and 1 tspn of pure vanilla extract. It was also done in 60 minutes.

I must admit it was very good...I will use this recipe again.

So incredible!  I made this for Thanksgiving to use for strawberry shortcake.  I'd never made this or any pound cake before, but I just followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  It's so dense and buttery and moist.  My father-in-law said it was a new classic for our holidays!  Thanks for this recipe!

Delicious, dense, moist cake..doe not take much to satisfy but it was gobbled up at Thanksgiving.

I did add a bit more vanilla and 1 tbl of orange to the egg and sugar mix.

I poured into two 8 x 8 pans for 30 minutes.

I also made the icing with 3 sticks of butter, 1 tbl of orange and 2 cups of powder sugar.  I split the icing between the cakes, layered them and covered the top with 1 cup of blueberries.

I thought it turned out great.  I followed the advice of adding 2 tsp of vanilla, and butter/cream cheese at room temp.  It took a little over an hour and a half to cook, and turned out so pretty.  The texture is amazing and the taste is wonderful.  For a pretty finish I drizzled powdered sugar frosting over the top.

Very good recipe for a truly dense pound cake but you can play with it to make it more moist....decrease flour and sugar and butter and it will be lighter but as is it is a "pound cake". I have also used self rising flour. U can add blueberries and lemon zest for a yummy twist.

Great pound cake.  I made this for my grandson's birthday.  I used a 3-D Thomas Train pan that required a dense cake for the "train" to stand up and this was it.  Moist and tasty.  Will make again in another pan.

Really really great!! I added maybe an extra half teaspoon of vanilla. After about 45 minutes at 325 I was worried that it was getting too brown, so I dropped it down to 300. Total baking time was about 1 hour 10 minutes and perfect brown crust. Too afraid to try it in the cold oven but maybe next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made several different variations of pound cakes over the years and this is a keeper!  Sometimes the most basic recipes yield the best dishes and this is one of them. I've made this several times now, and have not tried to embellish or change the recipe, with the exception of adding a handful of fresh fruit (raspberries or blueberries).  Thanks so much for sharing!

Unfortunately I think I overcooked my pound cake a little.  I probably should have taken it out after an hour but left it in the full hour and 20 minutes.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and started it in a cold oven.  The top and middle of the cake was very good.  However the sides and bottom were very overdone.  Next time I'll follow the directions exactly and preheat the oven.

Fabulous pound cake! Super easy to put together.  I really creamed the butter and cream cheese thoroughly, beat well after each egg, and added extra vanilla.  Next time I think I'll use almond extract instead.  It took exactly 1 1/2 hours to bake at 325.  Just wonderful.  Thanks.

Absolutely delicious!  I made this for a party and my friends didn't believe I actually made it.  It was so good and everyone loved it.  I baked it in a bundt pan, sprinkled powdered sugar on top and arranged fresh beries around the cake.  It looked like something out of a magazine!

Based on what everyone else says, this was the best poundcake ever. I was not sure how to make one, but it still turned out great. I used my Kitchenaid mixer to incorporate all ingredients.

Awesome recipe! Totally reminded me of the poundcakes I used to make with my grandmother when I was a little girl. I took some of the batter and mixed it with unsweetened cocoa and put it in the middle for a marble effect. Loved by all!

This was easy and was a hit with all who tried it. I did mix cream cheese, butter and suger very well, fluffed up very nice, one egg at a time. I will use this recipe a lot. Oh! its very good topped with Strawberries and vanilla ice cream.

I am 45 years old and have never made a pound cake from scratch. I made this last night for company and served it with fresh strawberries. It was absolutely delicious!  I was so proud of myself. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfect.  I used a stand alone mixer and it worked out great. Very moist on the inside and crisp on the outside. I will definitely be using this recipe again.  Thank you for sharing.

Great Pound Cake.  I usually mix in a cup of blueberries or raspberries and top the cake with a streusel mix of 1/4 cup sugar, 1/6 cup flour and 2 TBSP butter before baking.  Fantastic Dessert!

Everything the 5 stars rating reviews promised and more. I really think think is the best bundt cake I have ever made. The outside is firm,not crispy, hard or burned and the inside was cooked perfectly after 1.5 hrs. Great with a little powdered sugar.

This is a GREAT basic pound cake!!! I had more batter than would fit into my shaped pan so I poured the rest into a loaf pan.  I then waited to it to cool and put toothpick holes all over the cake and poured Almond Liqueur (about 1 shot) all over the top.  The next morning I poured about 1/4 cup more over the top and in the center,  The other loaf pan one I left plain.  I got rave reviews on both!!!!! Yummy!!!

It's a good poundcake, definitely takes more than 1hr 20 minutes to bake at 325F.  I put mine in at a little higher than 325, and it took about 1hr 40 minutes to cook fully.  But with some homemade strawberry topping (1 bag of frozen strawberries, thawed, 1tbl lemon juice, 1/4c orange juice, 1/4 confectioner's sugar, all pureed) everyone loved it!

This pound cake is wonderful and easy.  I took the advice of others and add my eggs one at a time.  I also add one tsp of pure lemon juice with the vanilla (2 tsp).  It turns out well and is enough for our family as well as if we have guests.  I have also added a lemon glaze and/or fresh pureed strawberries.  I have to cook this for 10-15 minutes longer as well.

This pound cake is the best I have ever had in my life. No kidding! I am baking one right now as I am typing this. I made one before for my husband's birthday and he absolutely loved it. The only thing that I change at all is that I use cake flour.Unbelieveable texture. I also add a teaspoon of lemon extract. The crunchy didn't go to well with some others people, but that is the best part. THANKS A BUNCH FOR THE RECIPE. Life time recipe for me now.

Well, after all the super reviews, I hate to add mine, but I just thought this was too over the top.  It was so killer sweet and rich, I thought I was going to have a heart attack eating it.  I love real pound cakes, but this one was just too much.  My guests liked it, though.  I won't be making it again.

Great-tasting recipe- easy to do, great pound cake texture and crust!  Very yummy too.  I put Satiny Chocolate Glaze on this and we had it for my baby's 1st birthday!  (Yes, he is a baby of refined tastes! Lol.)

Not bad. The crust was a little hard for my taste. But undercooking it was not an option as it is very dense and thick. I would make this again, but might try playing with the recipe a little and making it a little smaller to cut the cooking time down.

Love this recipe!  Very moist and dense.  Am making my third batch as I type!  When cooled, I slice the cake and wrap each piece in tin foil so there's always a piece ready for me to nibble on!

I love to bake, but I have never baked a pound cake before.  This recipe was very easy to follow and the cake was SO GOOD!  It browned beautifully.   I made this cake for a friend’s birthday and she and her family loved it.  Her niece thought that it was store bought because it appearance and texture.  Great recipe! Thanks Nanci!  I will definitely make this cake again!

Ok.  Took forever to bake and still parts were uncooked but if I hadn't taken it out, it would have been more dry than it already was.  Good flavor, but I like pound cake dense and moist and it wasn't.

I changed the recipe a bit by adding a 1/4 cup of milk, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder.

I did not pre-heat the oven as suggested by another user and baked for an hour and a half.

This cake came out very moist and delicious.  I am definitely keeping this recipe!!!

Wow... really good. Was in the mood to make my first pound cake although (and this is odd), I don't really like pound cake. Well, I do now. This is exceptional. I did add the juice from a lemon & the rind and it's just perfect. Poured a thick glaze of lemon juice & powdered sugar over the top. It's in the frig now for the girls at work tomorrow. I will have to find a good excuse as to why there is a big slice missing.

While this pound cake tasted good, it came out very flat and dense, even after baking it longer than the recipe calls for. I'll be sticking to my old tried and true pound cake recipe.

Very good cake that I received lots of compliments on.  The only thing I changed was added 2 tsps. of almond extract in addition to the vanilla.  Served with homemade whipped cream and strawberries.  Haven't tried as toast but as others suggested, I can see this being real good.  Thank you for sharing.

This cake is awesome! It's much better than my old recipe.  I followed the directions, but added 2 tsp of vanilla and I made sure the ingredients were blended very well. I served it Strawberries and whipped cream, but the cake is excellent alone.

I also served this cake with homemade whipped cream and strawberries.  And it was the best strawberry shortcake I've ever made.  It was a major hit.  I didn't change a thing and it came out perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I have been using this recipe for a little while now, and then I found it on here, too.  This is a delicious pound cake!  I love that it uses cream cheese.  It's a very moist, dense pound cake.  In my oven, I definitely had to bake this longer than the recipe calls for.  It also was uncooked in some parts and cooked in others.  You just have to be on top of it in the last half hour or baking.

I won't use another pound cake recipe.  This really is scrumptious!

This was my first pound cake. It turned out well. I did cut the sugar to 2 cups after reading many of the reviews. Also...make sure you have the proper sized pan. I used one of those silicone baking bundt pans from Wal-Mart. Near the end of original baking time, it began to rise a bunch & overflowed through the middle to the bottom of my oven. I added about 30 minutes total to the original baking time, probably because of my pan. It must be too small. The cake itself was very good. I made a glaze from confectioners sugar & lemon juice. I think it turned out great. Thanks!

The batter tasted promising, but I was unimpressed with the final outcome.  I did as the recipe says, checking the cake at 1 hour and then every  5-10 minutes until the toothpick test worked (took just over 1 hour and 20 min).  But then when we cut it, there were still wet parts here and there.  The flavor was nice, but not especially stunning.  Maybe I'm just not a connoisseur of pound cakes, but I will stick with the Georgia Peach Pound Cake from this site.

I'd give this one 4 and a half stars if I could. It's not quite 5 because it was too sweet. I'll definitely make it again, with maybe 2 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 3. This is a nice, dense pound cake, and is much better after the first day. I served it warm from the oven to some friends who dropped by, and now I wish I hadn't--it wasn't nearly as good as it was the next day.

Very good, dense, moist.  Just like my grandmother's.  Very, very good the second day.  I used 3tsp. vanilla & 1 tsp. almond flavoring.  I baked for 1 hour 25 minutes.  This is a very good pound cake recipe.

This was the first "homemade" cake I have ever made! I was worried it wouldn't come out because the batter was a little different than a cake mix, but I followed the directions exactly and man oh man, this is a GREAT pound cake! EXCELLENT and easy to make! The whole family loved it!  I served it with strawberries and whipped cream! THANKS!

This is an excellent pound cake recipe.  I made it just as recipe called and it is wonderful!!  The only thing I had to do different was place extra batter in a loaf pan because my bundt pan is smaller (9" instead of 10") than what recipe called for and it still tastes Great!! and came out perfect.   Thanks Nanci!!

This cake was everything the notes said it would be: heavy. dense, exceptionally easy to make.  It was the perfect foundation for fresh berries and I packed it the second day in my childrens' lunch.  I will make this again!

This is a fabulous recipe!  It bakes up beautifully and is great for chocolate fountain dipping because it is so dense (no crumbs to fall into the melted chocolate).  I added a bit more vanilla for our taste, and it keeps well in Tupperware for a couple of days at room temperature.  Everyone at Christmas raved about this cake.  Thank you for sharing!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I brought it to a Christmas Eve party, and everyone just loved it.  I baked as directed, and it turned out perfectly. It is moist and rich tasting, with just the right amount of sweetness. I added a cup of mini chocolate chips, and drizzled some chocolate frosting over it.  It turned out perfectly.  You can't go wrong with this one. Thanks for sharing it.

Although this recipe turned out tasty, it definitely wasn't like a traditional "pound cake". I agree with some of the other reviewers, it was quite eggy and more like a "custard" cake. It did turn out very dense and moist (due to a few ingredient adjustments I made: egg substitute vs. whole eggs, Land-O-Lakes light butter vs. whole fat butter, one 8-oz. cream cheese and 4-oz. low-fat cream cheese, and 1-1/4 c. white sugar with 1-1/4 c. Splenda vs. 3 c. of white sugar). I also increased Vanilla to 1.5 tsp and also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract. My husband like it very much but he would have preferred it to taste closer to a traditional pound cake. I happen to like the "custard" flavor so I liked it just fine.

This was a very sweet yummy pound cake. It was thick and moist. The resaon I gave this recipe 4 stars is because I had to cook this about 10 minutes longer and, the way it looked when it came out was just okay, but overall it was very good.  I took it to work the next day and one of my co-workers asked me for the recipe.  I will surely make this again. Thank You.

Easy to make and very tasty and moist. Some reviewers mentioned the "eggy" taste of this cake. I did notice that it tasted eggy when I tried a piece fresh out of the oven. The eggy taste goes away though when the cake sits overnight.

I love this cake, but it is not the light and fluffy pound cake my mom likes.  It is really heavy and thick, but tastes great... at least I think so.  Do not use margarine with this cake, it really needs real butter!!

This cake was wonderful. I made it for my Mother's birthday and the whole family loved it. I topped it with a homemade fudge frosting recipe I have and it was just fabulous. I did add an extra tsp. of vanilla but that was the only altering I did. Cooking time was perfect with my oven also. I will be making this again. Thanks for a WONDERFUL recipe.

Want to impress, but short on ingredients and time? This is your recipe! After reading the reviews, I increased the vanilla 1/2 tsp, and added 1/2 tsp of almond extract. Might go heavier next time, and I might throw in extra cream cheese. You'd think I'd leave perfection alone! :o) Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

I made this cake for my Mother-in-Law.. A big hit. Since I'm not a baker, it took a little more time mixing, it was worth it. The only thing different I did since I was late baking the cake. I put it on a plate and covered with aluminum foil. 4 hours later it was still warm for the party. My first Cake!!!

This is a very good pound cake.  It took awhile to fully cook though!  My family love it, but I wouldn't make this all the time since the calorie/fat content is extremely high!  I think these would make great gifts if baked as loaves.

I have made many pound cakes but this was perfection!  I used 1 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of buttermilk.  It baked over high and has a lovely, delicate crumb.  This will be my go-to from now on....thank you!

This is my second time  this cake and it came out awesome each time. The first time I used it to make cake pops. The second time I added one more teaspoon of vanilla and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice to change the flavor and I was not disappointed! Definitely worth the extended bake time to let it cook properly! Yum

This is the basic recipe for Cranberry Cream Cheese Pound Cake. Just add 15 oz of fresh cranberries sprinkled with flour. I sometimes also add 2 1/2 Tbl orange flavor with the cranberries.

The only thing I did differently was I didn't add all of the flour at the same time.  I slowly added sifted flour.  I have found that you don't find lumps of flour in your batter with this method.

I tried this recipe twice both were epic fails. The first time the batter spilled over the pan and never fully baked in the center. I had batter all over the inside of my oven. The second time I put less batter in the pan and put the rest in mini bundt pans. The minis rose, baked and then collapsed. The larger cake rose,  spilled over again and then collapsed. Crazy thing is the baked pieces  were delicious. Not sure what I did wrong.

HELP!!!! What did I do wrong?  Had such high hopes based on all the reviews. Used suggested modifications including room temp ingredients, 1/4 C buttermilk replacing some of butter, mixed in 1 egg at a time, slowly mixed in sugar & flour, baked until tooth pick came out clean (even a little longer than that) and it still came out raw inside.  Have a pretty high end oven and everything else I bake comes out great.

I've made this delicious recipe several times. I always cream the butter and cream cheese together for a few minutes and then add the sugar and let the mixer run for about 5 minutes before incorporating eggs, etc.  I also put a pan with water in the oven with the cake. Someone told me that insures moistness. I'm not sure if it's not true because I've never baked a poundcake without doing it. It's always moist by the way. I've also made this a lemon poundcake by adding 2 tsp of extract and a tsp of zest. A nice lemony glaze tops it off nicely. I bake it for 1 1 hour 30 minutes to 1 45. This is a very tasty poundcake.

This turned out lovely. I defiantly agree with earlier comments in letting the butter cream cheese and eggs sit  out and become room temperature before mixing. It made for a smoother batter and a more velvety cake texture.

This cake is so easy to make. As long as you don't overcook it, it's magical. I add more vanilla than the teaspoon and a pinch of salt.  I've also used almond extract. It's a staple for me.

I liked this recipe. Made half of it and mainly as is. I added almond essence in addition of vanilla. I also replaced half a cup of the flour for cake flour. Mind that I made the recipe in a hot day. I feared this constraint could potentially deflate the dough quickly.  I also poured them in cupcake molds which yielded 17. I baked for 40 minutes and can bake them for 35 if made in such size. Now, my recommendation to fear less when making the recipe would be in addition to room temperature eggs, cheese, and butter, to beat this recipe a lot and if you can, whip it in a standing mixer. Add the ingredients while the mixer is running. For instance: butter+cheese beat them a lot until pale then without stopping the machine add the sugar etc. Take your time a good 5 minutes does wonders to fluff the sugar+ butter+ cheese. I made this "mistake" and the outcome was excellent. The long beating fluffed this recipe out regardless of my procedure mistake. Also, beat eggs completely before adding the next egg. The more time you spend beating the mix the more air it will take up especially after adding eggs. Stop the mixer sparingly only to scrape sides and bottom of bowl. Don't add the eggs until you see the butter, cheese, and sugar going pale and fluffy. Room temperature is also key for fluffy success. My 4 stars actually are for the sugar. I used 1/4 cup less sugar for half the recipe and noticed that it was still a bit too sweet. Reduce the sugar by 1/2 c. if you don't like too much

This was my first pound cake,so I was doing something for my co-workers. So I decided to do lunch on me. And I was gonna do another dessert, so I decided to do this pound cake and let me tell you. I'm glad I did I got so many people tell me how good it was. I usually make cakes and sell them and never get to taste them. So I tasted it and OMG it was so moist and delicious. I will definitely fix it again. Did every ingredient as should and just added half of teaspoon of vanilla flavoring and icing it with a dream cicle icing. Delicious.

A very SWEET yet flavorful pound cake. The directions are a bit different from pound cakes that I have made over the years. . .such as put in 2 eggs at a time instead of 1 egg at a time; add ALL of the flour at once  instead of alternating the flour with another ingredient (like eggs or a liquid) .  I just prepared it the way I always do and it was perfect! Thanks for sharing your ingredients.

Honestly, I’ve made a lot of yummy cakes and this is not a great recipe, i did everything perfectly only reducing the sugar by 1/2.  Not sure how anyone could eat this with 3 cups of sugar!!  And lastly it is VERY dry, pass this one up guys...big thumbs down!

Excellent !  I tweak almost everything I make but this cake is perfect as is.  Buttery flavour, moist, dense but not too"chewy", easy to make, doesn't stick to the pan,  basic ingredients (so no special trip to store is needed), great for company  but fine for just us when recipe is easily halved (loaf pan).  Only one caveat -  I overbaked this once so now I really watch it during the last few minutes.

It was the best cake I have ever had because I don't make a lot of cakes. But still it was delicious. It came out perfectly. I twerked it a little by adding cherries and red food coloring. The cherries added a fresh taste to the pound cake. I will make this cake till I die.

Came out very well. Used spelt flour. High in niacin. But I did go with the original measurements. The reason it’s called a pound cake is because it uses a pound of each ingredient. Eggs, flour, 1/2tsp vanilla and I use powdered (confectioners) sugar and in this case 1/2pound each of butter and cream cheese.

Very good pound cake.  I made it for a family dinner. Everyone loved it, including the young grandsons. 
Very important to bring all ingredients to room temperature. I made it in a bunny pan and looked pretty dusted with confectioners sugar. I
I will be making again.

Very good flavor and texture but some areas of cake were not quite cooked even though I used a long cake tester and it came out dry in several test spots.  I think the oven temperature should be 350 degrees instead and then the time would be as close to what is stated in the recipe.  I have a very similar recipe I have used for years and it cooks at 350* and I never have a problem with uncooked areas.

I'm not a pound cake fan.  While I thought this cake was okay my dad thought it was great.   It was his birthday cake so that's what matters.  I let the cold ingredients sit for 70 minutes or so to get them up to room temperature before mixing.   I monitored the temperature throughout the bake cycle and although the oven was a consistently close to 325 I did need to increase the temperature to 350 after 80 minutes.  After 20 additional minutes of baking at the higher temperature the cake was baked through.   No problems getting it out of the pan.

Made it 3 times already, it's a big hit in my house. Didn't alter anything, just added a glaze to it, hubby says it's wonderful without the glaze he just needs vanilla icecream.

Made this pound cake for Easter. Doubled the recipe and made it in two spring form pans. Made it exactly as written. Followed the advise of other bakers and used room temp butter, eggs and cream cheese. Since i never plan ahead, warmed up the eggs and cream cheese (in the foil wrappers) in warm water while i prepared the spring form pans with parchment and non stick spray. Nuked the butter until softened. Caked turned out perfectly. Golden brown, moist and tasty. Will add it to my make and take list.

Too sweet even after I cut the sugar to 2-1/2 cups (brown sugar) and too dense. A little bit better after whipped cream but even after following recipe with the time, it wasn’t fully baked through even tho it was still edible.

I’ve been making this cake for 30+ years and it’s delicious! This is my go to recipe when I need take a dessert for an ill friend, event or whatever. I always double or triple the vanilla and it makes it so much more yummy! We live in East Tennessee where there’s a lot of humidity and the elevation is only 1600 feet and I’ve found that an hour and a half bake time is perfect.

This bundt cake is simple and has an amazing vanilla flavor.   I made this exactly as written with an addition of one teaspoon of almond extract as suggested by another reviewer.   This is an easy cake to make and is perfect for brunch or dessert after dinner.

The family love love... did I say LOVE... this cake!
I will surely make it again. I made a few changes..
1. Added 2 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp lemon extract. 
2. Used Neufchatel Cheese, did not have Cream Cheese.
3. Baked in cold oven at 300 degrees for 1 hour 40 mins.

PERFECT
Made a lemon cream cheese glaze!!!

I made this glutin free. So I had to triple the flavoring, and in place of xanxthan gumI used corn starch.  This was so creamy, light, and tasty it was all I could do to decorate it because I put it in a sand-castle bundt mold. Wonderful

I did it the first time few weeks ago and was disappointed that it did not raise.  Today morning, I decided to do it adding 1 tsp of baking powder and ¼ tsp of baking soda to the ingredients. Also I shortened the sugar to two cups and still was too sweet. The results were amazing.  Everyone loved it!

Great recipe ... even better due to the suggestions. The addition of buttermilk and the use of cake flour made this cake magical. A little almond extract next time and muah!

added 1/4 cup of buttermilk as I had some on hand I wanted to  use up.  This cake is so delicious, almost creamy in texture.  Definitely going to make this again.

Delicious and light!!  I used a funnel pan because I don’t have a Bundt pan.  Slightly reduced the sugar about 1/4 cup. Used real butter not margarine. Made fresh whipped cream and served with fresh strawberries and frozen raspberries.  It was amazing!!! Everyone loved it and it disappeared quickly.

Great recipe but I did make a few changes. I use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. It really does make a difference in the texture of the cake. Also, add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon almond extract, and this is my secret — 1/2 to 1 teaspoon butter extract. Don’t replace the vanilla extract — add these, too. Makes the BEST Southern pound cake on the planet! Oh, and always generously grease and flour the cake pan.

Was very good! I did substitute lemon extract for vanilla and it turned out better than I expected.  The crust of the cake was flavorful and not too flaky.  Just a really good recipe.

Just a couple of minor additions, added  lemon zest and amaretto. Also used cake flour like other reviews suggested. Kept a tray with hot water in the oven for moisture. Turned out amazing!!!

This was the first cake from scratch that I have ever made. It turned out beautifully. It was a bit heavy, even for a pound cake. But that could have easily have been my inexperience. Otherwise the flavor was addictive and would satisfy any sweet tooth.

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out verryyyyy good .. The only thing i would do next time is reduce the sugar and put 2 cups instead of 3 cause it was a little too sweet for my liking. Other than that, it was delicious.. Whole family loved it.

This cake was almost perfect. It's moist and light. The only criticism I received was it's a tad too sweet. Next time I'll use 2 1/4 cups of sugar.

I made the cake almost exactly as directed, adding only an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of almond extract. Because I have a convection oven, however, I baked it at 300 instead of 325. It took nearly two hours to cook, and while the insides were very soft and moist, a crispy external crust almost a quarter inch thick developed. Obviously, I hadn't planned that, but everyone who ate it loved the crust. It was particularly sweet and crunchy. I might try cooking at 325 next time, though. Otherwise, this cake was dense, moist, nicely flavored, and went great with fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream. Only four stars because, while it was good, it didn't blow my mind

I made this in two loaf pans.  I made no other changes, but I was disappointed in the results.  It was ok, but a bit dry.  Maybe I baked it too long.

Very moist and delicious cake! I made a couple of changes I use vanilla extract and a hint of lemon extract and I have to cook it a bit longer. I also noticed that if I used my dark lighter weight bundt pan versus the silver  heaver one, the cake cooks better.

I use the recipe all the time, I got it from my great aunt.  Since she was old skool of course she does things a little differently. My cake is NEVER dense, nor dry, because I use cake flour and sift my ingredients.    I was taught to sift my flour and sugar 3x each.  After creaming my butter and cream cheese, I alternate adding my ingredients, 2 eggs, 1c sugar, 1 c flour (repeat 2 more times).   I also, use ALMOND EXTRACT, in lieu of the vanilla.  I fold it in at the end.  I dont know how to add a photo.

Not sure how people can rate it a 5 Star. I did exactly the recipe and it was gel like, not at all like a cake. Wasted all my ingredients! I think it used self rising flour instead of regular flour. Also, I knew something is wrong when no baking powder or baking soda was used. ??

Double the bake time or do it in oversized muffin tins. Taste is totally worth the complicated bake time. Everyone I've shared this with is obsessed.

I loved this cake. The cream cheese makes it moist and the taste is mild. I shared with neighbors  and my family was not happy...lol The cake is so good. I used 2 cups sugar and also 2 cups flour with 1 and a half tsp vanilla.  Cooked in convection oven 80 mins...cooked thru perfectly.

I substituted lemon extract for vanilla. Other than that I followed all instructions. Except one I used a spring form pan.  DON'T! The tooth picked can out clean, I let it cool for 10 minutes, sprung it, then the center started to sink.  As soon as I cut into it the cake looked like a yellow lava cake. The taste was great but I am going to have to figure out how to fix it. Do I scoop out the center, or just cook it again?

It's gorgeous and the crust tastes darn good. Unfortunately, the texture of the cake is awful. I think maybe I mixed it too long because it's very dense. The taste too is pretty bad. There is no reason it should not taste wonderful!  I added a tablespoon of lemon juice to it and increased the vanilla to a tablespoon. I used cake flour instead of all purpose because it's what I had. I looked up how to substitute and it's easy to do. Ahhh. maybe it's the cake flour? I do not know but I sure don't want to eat it. I'll have to take it to my grandson; he and his roommate will eat anything!
It's awful pretty, though...

Based on other review, I only used 2.5 cups sugar, 2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp lemon juice. It turned out delicious!

I followed Barb's recommendations on adding the eggs one by one and increasing vanilla to 2 tsp. I found this cake to be overly sweet and even though I carefully checked the cake at 1 hour and removed it as soon as it was done, it was very dry. I would not recommend this recipe.

I just made it and waiting for it to cool before turning out.
The changes I made were separating the whites from the eggs and beating to soft peaks adding 1 cup of the sugar to the whites to stabilize, creaming the butter cream cheese and sugar then adding the yellows and folding that mix to the egg whites.
The time was a little more than 1hr 20 min. 

I started to get concerned, but patience pays off.
I can't wait to cut into it.

Color was beautiful. Next time I would cut the amount of sugar. Definitely too sweet. 
2 -2 1/2 cups should be plenty and kick up the vanilla or whatever flavourings your going to use.
I think next time I will use cake flour also, but the AP flour is fine.

I substituted I CAN'T believe it's not butter, 3 sticks and made sure all ingredients were room temperature. The video made it clear. I also added 1 t. Lemon extract and an extra t. Vanilla plus the zest of 1 lemon. First time my pound cake has been good in 40 years of trying!

I’ve made it twice so far but its going to be a “go to” recipe for certain. It’s easy, super delicious, and has an impressive appearance. I had leftovers with the first batch so I sliced it and put it in the freezer. I find myself grabbing a slice on the go and almost prefer it chilled. Serving at a work event tomorrow with chocolate, caramel, and cherry pie filling.

I have made this cake a few times and have followed the suggestions of those before me. The biggest change is the vanilla to two teaspoons. Everything to room temperature for sure. I keep my flour in a sealed plastic bag and I shake it up before I gently scoop it out. Delicious!

I added a vanilla bean to the sugar ahead of time to allow the flavor to permeate the sugar.  Used the cake to dip into chocolate fountain.  Wonderful texture.  Also used cake flour substitute of replacing two tablespoons per cup of flour with two tablespoons of cornstarch.

this turned out so perfect, just delicious!  The texture was velvety.  I made the recipe as stated, however followed the bon appetit recipe (pretty much the same ingredients)  for the bake time which had the baking times/temp as follows, starting with a cold oven:

    Place pan in cold oven. Set temperature at 200°F; bake 20 minutes. Increase temperature to 250°F; bake 20 minutes. Increase to 275°F; bake 10 minutes. Increase to 300°F; bake cake until tester inserted near center comes out clean, about 1 hour longer. Cool cake in pan on rack 15 minutes.

Decided to make it following the original directions but split the batter up in 3 loaf pans.  Definitely needed more flavoring as others suggested (vanilla, or almond or lemon).  By the time the inside was baked the outside was way too brown.   It did have a very velvety texture and after trimming the crust away and topping with juicy sugary strawberries and real whipped cream it was pretty good.  Thank you for the recipe and also the helpful comments.

Came out gorgeous, I made one thin small cake and a set of jumbo muffins, so baking only took 40 minutes! I added extra vanilla. I ate it with vanilla bean Bluebell, and it was delicious, but I will be having it with just milk next round. Dense but light, with perfect insides! We were impressed. I will be looking into a lemon version of this.

Sooo, good!  But I don't taste the cream cheese much, if at all, which is a little disappointing.  It is very buttery and dense.  Cook of 1 hour 20 minutes? My cake was practically raw after that time.  It took 2 hours for my cake to fully cook, but it came out with a thick, crunchy-sweet crust that makes me moan with delight.  I will make this over and over again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely love this recipe. Followed Barb Maxwell's tips. Also made this as a German Chocolate version.  Substitute 1/2 cup of flour with cocoa powder. Half of vanilla and added 1 1/2 tsp coconut extract. Added about 3/4 cup coconut flakes. You can add chopped nuts if you'd like too. Great flavor. Easy recipe!

I've made this cake a few times. It's always been a hit. I have sometimes experienced serious sad lines in my cake. Not sure how to avoid it. However, the tips I read about all my cold ingredients being room temperature are great tips and will help me reach pound cake perfection. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe but I just can't give it 5 stars because it was a tad dry for my taste buds and I prefer pound cakes over other types of cakes.   Maybe I had it in too long for my taste buds but my family loved it.  I will give it another try to see if I need to shorten the time it baked.

Delicious! I personally added a bit more vanilla, which is always a risk when working with cream cheese, as there is a risk the vanilla will overwhelm the taste, but it didn't seem to hurt it too much. I don't own a tube pan so I used simple loaf pans and the results were the same. Definitely recommend making sure everything is room temperature.

Cooked it about 1:35 but other than that I followed it perfectly and everyone loved it. Next time I might try coconut on top or figure out how to incorporate coconut milk inside. This will be my launching pad for experimenting.

Made it the first time and used the suggested amount of sugar.  Way too sweet!  The second time I made it,  I reduced the sugar by 2 cups.  What a difference.  For those who have a sweet tooth you can reduce by half.  Reducing the sugar improves it dramatically.

I made this cake yesterday 8/27/17 and it came out excellent. I used cake flour instead of all purpose flour and eggs, butter, and cream cheese at room temperature before use.  Make sure the cream cheese and butter are mixed to a smooth texture before adding the other ingredients. My family and I absolutely love it and it has now been added to my list of recipes.

This is so simple and so delicious. I have never made pound cake before so I looked through a ton of recipes looking for one that would be moist (nothing worse than dry pound cake). I have a ton of blueberries and wanted something to use as a shortcake, of sorts. This recipe was perfect! The crumb was fine and moist, not at all coarse and dry.

I didn't make any changes to the basic recipe except for adding slightly more vanilla and adding a half teaspoon of almond extract. And I only used 5 eggs but that was because they were jumbo sized eggs. 

I used two 9x11 loaf pans to bake it since I wanted to add blueberries to one of them. If you add fruit to this recipe, be sure to add a bit of extra time in the oven for the batter to cook through. That loaf was a little less done than I would have liked, but that's my fault, not the fault of the recipe.

I LOVE this recipe! So simple and relatively easy to make! I did follow the previous reviews about using a COLD oven set to 300*F and bake it for 90 minutes minimum, then check at 10 minute intervals for doneness. I also mixed it super well with ROOM TEMPERATURE ingredients. The eggs I added one at a time, and beat well in between each egg. It is so dense and delicious! Definitely a go-to dessert recipe!

Very nom nom. The first time I forgot the flour. I attribute this to age and untreated ADHD. How do you forget the main ingredient in a recipe? Whatever.

The second time I got it right, and as I said, nom nom. (That's adolescent for delicious.) Followed directions and ingredients precisely except added eggs one at a time. Cake gone in a day.

This is likely one of the best pound cakes I've ever eaten.  It is light with a great crumb.  I made mine a lemon pound cake by adding lemon extract and some fresh lemon juice to the glaze.  This one is a keeper for sure!

I followed the recipe almost exactly , substituting cake flour for all-purpose and baking it in two loaf pans instead of the 10-inch tube pan.   I was worried while it baked because the  center was flat, but it almost evened out by the time it was finished.  Baked at 325 for 70 minutes.  Everyone enjoyed it!

I half the recipe changing to 7 servings and use a narrow and long loaf pan, increase vanilla to 1-1/2 teaspoons and cooked 1:15. Yummy. Great for strawberry shortcake.

Recipe was great but I made a couple changes first I added an additional teaspoon of flavor I've tried with both lemon and almond both are good. Also, I reduced oven temp to 320 degrees for 1 hour 25 min

I was weary about making this pound cake after reading some of the negative reviews. I'm glad I didn't listen. It came out perfect. Many reviewers complained that the cake was raw in the middle even though they followed the recipe. Well most didn't follow the recipe. You said you used a Bundt pan. The recipe specified a 10 inch tube pan. Very different from a bundt pan.

This recipe is excellent but it is improved with three easy changes:  increase butter to two full cups, use a teaspoon of lemon extract instead of the vanilla and, most importantly, use CAKE FLOUR and not all purpose flour.

Further tips:  make sure butter and cream cheese have the SAME firmness before starting to blend them.  Blend them patiently with a fork before using the electric mixer.  Regarding cake flour, package directions always suggest sifting before measuring; for this cake you should measure first, THEN sift to break down any lumps.  Add the lemon extract just before the eggs (not last) and, once all eggs are added, run mixer fast for 4 or 5 minutes for high volume.  I find that this makes a cake that's slightly large for a Bundt pan, so I prefer the standard old-fashioned 10-inch tube pan.  If you must use a Bundt pan, consider reducing recipe by one-sixth:  5 eggs, 2 1/2 cups each flour and sugar, etc.  I use an oven temperature of 350 F. and in the tube pan it takes about an hour and 25 minutes.  Let cool at least 20 minutes in pan before attempting to remove; while still quite warm put cake into a sealed container and leave it there 2 full days.  Drops of moisture that form inside container will be gradually absorbed by the cake.

My grandmother made a fabulous pound cake and I could never get the recipe.  It was very sweet with a crusty top.  This recipe came pretty close.  I was tempted to not use the entire quantity of sugar called for, but I think all that's what gives it a crust.  I made a cream cheese glaze but next time I'll just serve with lightly sweetened whipped cream.  I also baked in two loaf pans and it still required the entire 80 minutes to cook through.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was my first attempt ever at making a pound cake, and I will definitely be doing it again!! Recipe is simple and easy to follow, and it tastes great. It took a little while longer than suggested for the cake to cook all the way through, but that could be because of my stove.

Excellent pound cake and very easy to make! I was skeptical of a recipe that didn't call for baking powder or baking soda but it rose and browned beautifully! Surprisingly, it's a tad sweet but overall, it's a quick and easy cake that will get rave reviews!

I made this cake exactly as directed and it turned out perfect. Absolutely the best pound cake I have ever locked a lip around. I used farm fresh eggs and real organic butter and flour which I believe only enhanced the true flavor value.  It was very moist and not to sweet. Thanks for sharing this recipe....I will be making it often.

I added  2 tsp of pure vanilla extract. The taste and texture of this cake was amazing.  I followed the recipe as written and found it to be delicious and not too sweet. When the cake is fully baked, take it out immediately and let it cool. I turned the oven off and left my cake in for an additional 10 minutes and the top got crusty but fell apart. My mistake. I am going to make this cake again as it stays moist and delicious even after three days.

This was the first pound cake I have made. It turned out great!. I want to thank all who shared their recipe adjustments and baking tips. Definitely the success of this recipe is by decreasing the sugar to 2.5 cups,  using room  temperature ingredients, and most importantly, putting the batter in the cold oven. this was a hit for for the 51st super Bowl night. PS. I used almond extract infused with vanilla bean

I've made this twice.  So easy, so good, so pretty.  I used the Nordic Heritage bundt pan so it really looked special.  The only change i made was to use almond flavoring.  I will make it again and again.  Truly the best.

I read reviews on this cake recipe AFTER I baked it. This is an awesome recipe considering I just started baking. I had been looking for a perfect pound cake that "tastes" like one I had some years ago. This is it! I absolutely love it. And to get a thumbs up from my hubby was a plus. I added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. lemon extracts. It was well work the wait. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious and tender, very tasty!

I followed a few of the suggestions from other reviews. I used butter to grease the pan and added a dusting of flour to prevent sticking. And, I doubled the vanilla. I started with a cold oven rather than preheating, and my baking time was about 80 minutes. Cooled it in the pan for 10 minutes or so, then turned it out onto a cooling rack. No glaze or anything needed, since I left the sugar quantity the same.

Fabulous!  I beat the butter/cream cheese and sugar for 5 minutes on high.  I also used slightly less than 3 cups of CAKE FLOUR (rather than all purpose).   Amazing result.  This pound cake is our new family favorite!

I made the recipe exactly as written.  It ended up having to cook longer than stated because the middle wasn't cooked through.  Once it came out of the oven, the outside was too crisp.  The cake itself is way too sweet.

Very disappointed that I wasted 3 sticks of butter and 8 oz of cream cheese on this cake.  Way too sweet and it never gets done.  Back to the drawing board of looking for a good recipe.

Stumbled onto this recipe 5-6 years ago and have made it every Thanksgiving since!  A great, great pound cake--it is everything you'd want in a pound cake.  Great by itself, or you can add to it, either with toppings or with the slight changes to the basic recipe (adding lemon juice/zest  or other flavoring in place of  or in addition to the vanilla).  You have to watch the bake time at first, but once you figure it out, you're fine if you use the same oven and pan.

This was just fantastic.  The first time I made it I left out flour by accident.  (I know, was multitasking too much.)  We actually ate it after scooping it into ramekins like custard.  I made it again a week later with the flour of course, and it was just fantastic.  Will make again this week for Thanksgivigin.

Fantastic!! This is my second pound cake ever! I did an extra tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of lemon extract. It is Amazing. I used an Emerson blender to blend the cream cheese and butter before adding it to the mixer to make sure it was creamy. I will absolutely be making this again. Great recipe!!

I really wanted to love this cake.  I got all the ingredients together and made it exactly as the recipe is written...  I'm not sure what went wrong but it was just OK for me.  It's far too sweet in my opinion and it wasn't very moist either.  It can be masked with some ice cream or strawberries on top but, as is, I'm not impressed. I'm gonna assume it was user error since so many others liked it so much but, again,  I followed the recipe. I even softened the butter, cream cheese and set the eggs out a bit so they weren't freezing cold, it just didn't wow me. I may tinker with it again in the future if I'm in the mood to possibly waste ingredients.

I made this recipe for a family gathering. It was the talk of the event, and I added cream cheese frosting, one cup less sugar, cake flour and cooked 15 to 20 minutes longer than called for. The elders stated that it taste as if my grandmother guided me, because it taste like her pound cake. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Before I even made this recipe I printed out 3 copies to give to my guest who I knew would want the recipe and they did LOL
Sometimes I can just look at a recipe and know I am going to love it, of course the reviews helpedas well. :) Only thing I added was a lemon drizzle on top of the cake. Best pound cake I have ever made and will always be my fav. Thanks for this great recipe.

This was incredibly disappointing. I made the recipe exactly as stated. It never fully cooked on the inside, despite being baked for over an hour and a half.  I'm giving it two stars because my children happily ate it.

I made a half recipe in a loaf pan, and it didn't puff up as much as I hoped, but it was delicious and quite easy to make. I did add the juice and zest of half a lemon, otherwise no changes. Served with whipped cream and fresh-picked blueberries! Yum.

Not sure what happened but the cake came out very dry.  I did decrease sugar to 1.5 cup of sugar .  Don't know if that caused it but it looked good but was almost inedible.

Very good and very easy. I like that it only takes one bowl, I just did each step in my mixer. It had a nice crust on the outside and was very moist on the inside. I followed the directions exactly but I did serve it with some fruit and whipped cream. I feel like it does need something like that to make it taste complete...I would think a glaze or a berry sauce would be great too.

Wonderful cake! Just like my grandma's. I followed several posters' suggestions and substituted 1/4 c buttermilk for 1/4 c butter. I put it in a cold oven at 300 and baked for 2 hours. Perfect! Thank you!

I make this cake very often and don't make a single change, except get butter and cream cheese at room temp for easier Mixing. It's a favorite! If you are using your kitchen aid mixer, be sure to stir the huge amount of flour before turning it on or it WILL go EVERYWHERE!

Great recipe! I had to bake the cake at 310 for about 1 hour & 45 mins so it would bake properly (after 3 tries of the cake not cooking all the way through).  The cake came out very fluffy.

I bake a lot, but this was the first time I made pound cake.  It turned out absolutely perfect!  I served it with macerated strawberries and homemade whipped cream for Easter.  The texture was great--a crispiness to the outside, and a dense, tender sponge to the cake.  It was so good, it could stand alone without anything else.  That says a lot because I have a sweet tooth and normally want everything covered in icing or chocolate.  It was wonderful!  I will be making this again and am so glad that I found this recipe! I'm not sure where others went wrong when they came out with a raw cake.  I baked mine for about 1 hour 10 minutes at 350 and then 10 minutes at 375 because I was running late!  Anyway, I tested it for doneness with a toothpick and pressed on the top of it to feel if it sprang back well.  You want it to feel firm and be a medium to dark golden brown.

it was a great light dessert. I mixed in a little lemon too and added walnuts to a nice confectioners drizzle with citrus juice on top. Very easy to make.

OMG!!!! This cake is AWESOME!!!  I can't wait to make it again! Iht's a lot of batter, I could have made 2 cakes using my "Temptations Bundt pan " which is smaller than traditional tube cake pan.  Also I had to bake much longer, used a skewer all the way done to avoid an uncooked center.  It took almost 2 hrs. This is THE BEST pound cake I've ever made!  Thanks for this recipe.

I followed other reviewers' recommendations and substituted cake flour for all-purpose.  Cake was moist, dense, and had a tasty crust on the top, but otherwise, didn't really have a lot of flavor.  It was a great vehicle for fruit and whipped cream, but I was surprised the cream cheese flavor didn't come through more.  There are definitely other pound cakes out there that have more flavor.

I've been making this cake for years..it's my mothers exact recipe..the only additions I ever make, is adding some lemon or orange extract..     Depending on the occasion.. And I also make a very simple glaze to match the flavored..1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 water and juice from half a lemon or orange and half stick of butter.. Bring it up to a light simmer and brush cake while still warm...that's what I love about this cake.. Its an open canvas...oh, did I mention that it's perfect as is...

This cake is yummy!   I used room temperature ingredients as everyone recommended.  It cooked 1 hr and toothpick came out clean.  I was afraid it would be raw inside as someone had experienced, so I went 10 more minutes.  The top was looking brown, so I pulled it out.  It stuck to my bundt pan on top just enough that it took some of the crusted edge in a few small areas.  Not much but it took 3 tries to get it out of the pan.  I tried to make sure it was well buttered and floured, but didn't come out very easy.  Not sure if baking it 10 more minutes would have helped or hurt the crust round the pan.  It was fun to make.  The batter is very fluffy going into the pan.  It's my first pound cake from scratch.  I will try it again and add some fruit to the center!  Thanks for the recipe and all the helpful reviews.

While I don't particularly care for this pound cake, I still gave it 5 stars because the recipe itself is not the issue for me. My family loves it, and I found the recipe super easy to execute. The result was great. The only thing I may do in the future would be to add more sugar, but not much. Overall, this was simple and tasty.

Excellent recipe! I used this one for my very first time baking ANY kind of cake from scratch and let me tell you, it is the bomb! The only changes I made were letting the cream cheese, eggs, and butter reach room temp first and 2 tsp of pure vanilla extract instead of one.  My family loves it! My recipe from now on. (Oh, yeah, I also used Swan's Down cake flour instead of all purpose.)

An incredible, basic pound cake like I grew up with -- However, I did triple the vanilla to 3 teaspoons.
When I was a child, this was the base for our strawberry shortcake!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe. It rivals my grandfather's recipe, which I adored when I was younger. Unfortunately, he died before I was able to get the recipe. I know he'd be proud seeing me baking his favorite cake. You did a great job, thank you.

To pay tribute to the German pound cake: Add 1/2 tsp almond extract. Zest of one lemon. I/2 tsp cardamom. Reduce sugar to 21/2 C. Make sure butter, cream cheese and eggs are room temp!

Lovely pound cake that my husband's parents and my grandparents loved although they are not too big on sweets.  Make sure butter, cream cheese and eggs are at room temperature, and don't overmix.

Made no changes whatsoever! This cake is to die for! Just sprinkled with light cover of powdered sugar. This will be one I'll continue to make for years!

HOLY MOLEY!!! What a cake!!! Love the crusty outside. It defiantly takes more than 1 hour and 20 min to cook. I went 1 1/2 then left in the oven while it cooled down. That way it's not browning the outside, which was a perfect golden brown. Very dense, very moist. I did add 2 tsp vanilla. And lemon zest would be a nice addition next time. A treat for sure. It's a VERY thick batter, more like frosting than batter. My handheld mixer couldn't do it at the end. But it is a cheapy one. A Kitchen Aid mixer would have been nice here.

Great recipe! My alterations were to use cake flour instead of AP flour, up the vanilla to 1 TBSP and substitute 1 cup of the white sugar for brown sugar for more flavor. Delicious!

I used cake flour and followed the rest of th recipe. I tasted the batter and it was delicious however, the cake was for a woman at my church.  So I did not taste the final product.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for except I used two teaspoons vanilla and cake flour. It's the first pound cake I have ever made, so I wanted to stick as close to the recipe as possible. OMStars! It's wonderful! It's not as heavy as some pound cakes, probably because of the cake flour, but it developed that wonderfully, sugary crust that is so good. Next time, I will try to add some lemon or coconut extract to see how we like those flavor a.  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW! This cake was amazing! I only had almond extract so I used that instead of the vanilla, and since I wasn't sure if the eggs I had were big enough in size I ended up using 7 just to be safe. I made sure to blend it really well after each egg was added and the batter was really smooth and creamy. The cake baked perfectly well and was just amazing! Thank you so much for providing such a delicious recipe!

Very delicious. Best and easiest pound cake I have ever made. I made a small change by reducing the sugar to 2 1/2 cups.

This is one of the best poundcake recipes I have found. The flavor and texture of this cake are wonderful. The reason I only rated it 4 stars is I made a few changes after reading many reviews. I used only 1 1/4 c butter and added 1/4 c buttermilk. I used Swans Down cake flour, and started in a cold oven. I set the temp to 300 degrees and baked for 2 hours.

I made this a few days ago and my god was it good. I followed the recipe exactly. It came out just the right density. I used an electric mixer and made sure that the ingredience were at room or close to room temperature. I watched it as it cooked and it took the full time. Also i created an easy lemon glaze for it. It was GONE in 1.5 days everyone loved it and raved. You will be proud of yourself!

Followed recipe exactly, no changes. My family is not into desserts. At ALL. But I? am, and I? always have something sweet after big dinners. Made this after Christmas dinner and it was GONE. Even the pickiest eaters liked it, some asked for 2nds & 3rds. My opinion: moist, dense, subtle, lovely. Plain yet sublime. Will make again, and again.

This was my 1st from scratch recipe! BIG SCORE! I did alter the recipe a little. Instead of 1 1/2 cups of butter, I used 2. I added 2 tsp of vanilla extract and a 1/2 tsp of lemon extract. I made this as part of my Christmas dinner and it didn't last past the 26th! It has definitely been added to my holiday spread now.

My first time baking a cream cheese pound cake, I love the recipe. It was very simple. I have a Kitchen-Aid Mixer which made it a cinch. I followed the recipe as instructed. Me and my children and boyfriend loved it. I used land o lakes butter and Egg-lands best eggs. I also use Swans Down Cake Flour (sifted). Highly recommend this recipe to everyone. Keep up the outstanding work. My friends that I gave a piece of the cake loved it. It reminded them of a cake that should have been prepared by grandma. I will use this recipe over and over again.

Oh my, this is a keeper!  I added a bit more vanilla extract but otherwise followed the recipe. Let the cream cheese and butter whip really good before adding the rest of the ingredients... worked awesome!  My husband even asked me to keep this recipe which he rarely does! I served it with mixed berries and whipped cream!  Yum!

I have made this recipe 3 times in the past month for various occasions.  Everyone loves it.  I added 1 tbsp of good vanilla extract, and it balances well with the cream cheese.  One time I added the zest and juice of one lemon, and that was delicious also.

Very similar to a cake I've been making for years to raves from everyone who eats it! In addition to those ingredients I add 1 tsp.  baking powder and 1 tsp. salt. Then I sift them into the mixture with the flour. Crunchy outside, creamy inside!

Made this cake last night to go with dinner.  It was very easy to make with the simple ingredients and directions.  I was looking for a pound cake loaf but decided to try this anyhow.  It turned out great.  My only complaint is trying to wrap a cake this shape to keep it from drying out is difficult.  I put it in a plastic cake carrier and this morning the cut ends were a little dry.  Other than that the cake is great.  Its the same today as it was last night.  I made the recipe exactly as it is written.  I wouldn't make any changes unless you wanted a flavor like lemon or something, but we like it as is.

This recipe is the bomb .  I use it for a chocolate layer cake and peanut butter layer cake , it was simply great. I like the flavor as well as the cake's body to hold homemade icing .

Just perfect!  Great density, not too sweet, a great base cake.  I got a little crackly crust but that was tasty, too.  Had the first slice warm with a little Nutella, delicious.  Used a blackberry topping when I served it and it was well liked.

This is the best pound cake I have made. I used cake flour instead of all purpose. I read incorrectly and only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and it is amazing. I will always cut the sugar in half now!

I am giving this recipe five stars on faith. Like MichelleT, I mixed and baked the cake EXACTLY as directed, but ended up with an unbaked center. I was very disappointed because I made it for my husband's birthday and wanted him to be pleased. I read many of the reviews and believe that my ingredients must not have been room temperature. I plan to try again today, and keep trying until I get it right. It really is an easy recipe, but it takes experience to know just how to combine the magic ingredients.

I baked this cake yesterday, and I loved it. I took some to work to share with co-workers and everyone loved it. Several co-workers asked for the recipe. This is the first cake I've ever baked that lasted less than 24 hours. I did substitute 1/4 c of butter for 1/4 c of buttermilk and I added 1 tsp. of almond extract. I will definitely be baking this cake again.

I took a few suggestions from above kept butter same amount but added 1/4 cup buttermilk.  Also added eggs one at a time. Also make sure ingredients are room temperature and use sofasilk cake flower..also added teaspoon of fresh lemon juice to give a hint of spring freshness. Was awesome ...a keeper family recipe.

Perfection!! I followed the recipe, with a slight addition of 1 tsp of almond extract. Everyone loved it! Perfectly dense, not too heavy, moist...this is now a dessert staple in my household!

An absolutely outstanding pound cake that needs nothing changed on it whatsoever. Dense, moist just perfect.  Followed the directions to the letter which is usually hard for me as I'm sometimes one of those I'll just add a smidge of this or that. Changes will only make this less than what it is....excellent

Very good. I like the flavors better as originally posted or with the addition of just lemon. I tried it with lemon, buttermilk and sour cream as suggested and the flavors were muddied in the result.

I had to bake this cake for 2 hours 10 minutes and still it wasn't completely done on the inside! I beat the cream cheese and butter for 4 minutes, the sugar another 2 minutes and the flour another 2 minutes because of the other comments. The only thing I can blame the under cooked cake on is the oven temperature. The cake was very tasty but I was disappointed with the result.

This was my first time baking any cake from scratch and it turned out beautiful. I was a little concerned at first because I cut a slice when it was still warm but the next morning, very different. I'm new to baking from scratch and I don't understand why some put the cakes in cold ovens but I'm sure that I will learn. Will try other suggestions too.

The cake turned out pretty good. I love pound cakes. I substituted one and half cups of Splenda blend for the sugar because my husband is diabetic. He suggested that I use one and three fourths cups of Splenda blend.  I also think that when I make it again, I will add one fourth cup of buttermilk to add a little moisture.

This turned out great! I made some modifications. Used 2 1/2 cups sugar and low fat cream cheese. The out layer was too dry after baking 1 hour 25 min at 325. Next time I will make following changes. Use 1 1/4 cups butter 1/4c buttermilk, 2 1/4c sugar, 5 eggs and bake in cold oven for 90 min at 300 degrees.

This cake is phenomenal. My husband is something of a cake connoisseur (really it's the mainstay of his whole family's diet; I have no idea how they are so thin and healthy) and he says it's the best cake he's ever eaten. I never like cake without frosting (I'd just eat the frosting off most cakes if it was socially acceptable) and I loved it. 

I did modify a couple things. 

First of all, I used eggs fresh from my backyard and added them in one at a time. They never even went in the fridge so they were definitely room temp. I used room temp cream cheese and unsalted butter. I subbed, cup for cup, Swan's cake flour, and since it's much finer than AP flour, that probably accounted for why my first cake overflowed into the oven. I also added extra vanilla and also some vanilla bean. It's my humble opinion that there's no such thing as too much vanilla. 

Since my first cake overflowed and we had to stop midway for cleanup I have no idea how long actual cooking time was. It was much longer than 1:20 though. My second cake is in the oven now and I am cooking it on a cookie sheet plus some extra dough is waiting in muffin tins for later.

This recipe seems very versatile and I'll be tweaking it more in the future. Thanks Nanci!

Man oh man! Read all the reviews and decided to stick to the recipe the first time and see how it turns out. The only change was 2 tsp Almond Extract instead of vanilla.

Started with room temperature ingredients, used my stand mixer to do the mixing, used a angel food cake tube pan in a preheated 325 oven for 90 minutes and the finished product was a slice of pure heaven!

This cake is truly a keeper! May reduce the sugar a bit next time, a bit sweet as others have mentioned. The texture and taste of the cake is just wonderful, will make this one again for sure, soon as I run off all the calories and fat this cake has.

Excellent recipe! I took the advice of previous reviewers by ensuring that the cream cheese, butter, and eggs were at room temp before mixing. I added the eggs one at time, mixing well after each. I used 2 tsp of vanilla extract (I LOVE vanilla). I started off in a cold oven and baked at 325 degrees for 1hr and 20 min. The result is a dense cake with a deliciously rich flavor. This will be my go to recipe for a pound cake.

Cake was very easy to make, very moist, but too sweet! Next time I will cut back on the sugar, and use a different flavoring instead of vanilla extract.  Perhaps orange liquor, orange extract or orange zest.

I cut the sugar down by 100g and it's still too sweet. Will cut down to 400g of sugar instead. I baked from a cold oven and the cake turned out beautiful.

This is good and easy recipe. I added 1 teaspoon of lemon extract to give it that extra kick!! The cream cheese makes it very moist.

This cake was phenomenal! I never bake. But, recently, two grandchildren were diagnosed with tree nut allergies. And my daughters say you cannot trust bakery products not to have traces of nut oils. So, I bought new pans and baked. I don't have a stand mixer. I just used my hand mixer and stirred in the flour. So so easy. Everyone loved it. Thank you for testing and supplying this easy recipe.

Made this today as directed in the recipe.  I added a cup or so of blueberries.  I made the mistke of baking in a greased and floured bundt pan!  It stuck and my cake fell apart.  My husband got the broken chunks and said it was absolutely delicious!!!  Will make sure I use a tube pan per directions next time.  It is delicious and the time for baking was just right for my oven.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My husband loves this cake more than his Dutch grandmothers! For me that's huge! haha I did have to bake it much longer, maybe 1 hour and 40 minutes. I'll edit this if the next time is different.

I read some of the negative reviews and was a little nervous. But I followed the directions AND I baked it in a water bath and covered the top loosely with foil towards the end to prevent the crust from getting overbaked. It turned out amazing. It was so moist and delicious. Even 3 days later (it's only me and my husband here) it was still moist and yummy.
I'm about to make this again now for a work potluck tomorrow!
I'm going to top it with some berries and homemade whipped cream. Can not wait!!!

Per other reviews, I used 2 tsp vanilla and maybe a half tsp of almond extract (I just eyeballed the almond). I ended up baking it for nearly two hours. It turned out delicious, though! Very good pound cake!!

I absolutely adore this recipe. I cut the recipe in half and it fit my loaf pan perfectly. Reminded me of my grandfathers pound cake. I also like that there was no levening agent, that made it perfectly dense. But not too heavy. It was gone by the end of the night, I'm going to have to make another one, lol. Thank you for this recipe.

This was indeed the easiest pound cake I've ever made and the best taste and density by far.  I did increase the temp to 350 dg and had no problem with burning and everything was cooked through.  I made a glaze for the top and my husband can't stop eating it.  Thank you Nanci for sharing this with us all.

Soooo yummy. I used this recipe to make a Wilton 3D teddy bear cake. Not only did it look great, but it tasted amazing. I doubled the vanilla, and used cake flour, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. It did take 1:45 to cook, but given that the pan was a large 3D teddy bear, I wasn't surprised at that.

I do believe this tastes a good bit like a Sara Lee pound cake. It gets better each day, but still a tad too dry. This cake was okay, a bit too dry for my family. I did add the 1/4 cup of buttermilk someone suggested. I now realize that was the only liquid except for the eggs. I much prefer the five flavor pound cake from this site. This cake was dense and good flavor, but not what I was looking for.

This came out exceptional.  I sprinkles powered sugar on the outside when done and it looked professional.  The cake was moist on the inside the outside had a nice crust.  I will be making this again.

My uncle requested an almond cream cheese pound cake for his 60th and this had great reviews so I thought, let's go for it! I'm SO glad I tried this recipe out because, WOW, it's delicious! Doubled the recipe to bake in 2 10" cake pans and used a generous amount of almond extract and voila! Scrumptious cake! I will definitely make this again and again =D

I made this for my first poundcake on my boyfriends birthday instead of cheesecake like I had planned.  I followed it to a T and it came out done at the right time and  we tasted it about 30 minutes after. It had a decent taste and moist, but it seemed a little "bready" so I had thought that I over mixed it.  I waited to taste it the next day and tasted richer and not nearly as bread-ish tasting.  I actually enjoyed this with homemade stawberry glaze/pieces on top.  It had a kind of Walkers Butter cookie flavor which I love!  Also enjoyed it chilled.  I guess the main thing was that it's not like those store bought pound cakes that I had ate in the past but I ended up liking it better once I got used to the dense character of it.

A very good pound cake, however, I tasted absolutely zero cream cheese. So if you're wanting a cake with a cream cheese flavor, this isn't going to do it. Maybe add a cream cheese frosting.

Absolutely delicious! It was a little sweet, even for my sweet tooth so next time I will decrease sugar to 2 1/2 cups like other reviewers. I also added some lemon extract to for another layer of flavor. I made it last night and half of the cake is gone already!

This was the first cream cheese pound cake recipe that I tried when looking for a cake to make and use at my vow renewal ceremony next year and was I ever so amazed that I don't need to look any further because this is the BOMB!  I didn't change anything except the pan that I baked it in.  I used 2-9" round cake pans and timed them for 30 minutes and then checked every 5 minutes for doneness and I think it took about 45 minutes total for the cake to be finished.  My husband and I covered it in buttercream and then fondant for practice and when we were taste testing it I think he ate 3 pieces :).  Thank you for sharing this recipe and ending my search for the cake I'm using for my celebration!

I have been making this recipe for about 6 years, I believe I originally got it from the Taste of Home magazine.  It comes out perfect EVERY-SINGLE-TIME!  The only difference is I add a tad more vanilla (1.5 tsp).  It is my all time GO-TO recipe.

It was much better a day or two later. It was too dense, and didn't have the right flavor at first. There are easier and less fattening pound cakes to make for better flavor.

You know, I'm sad to say that this wasn't my favorite. I had high hopes for this as my first pound cake and I won't blame the recipe as it could have easily been something that I did. When the cake came out it was GORGEOUS. I was very pleased. But when we cut into it, it was so very thick. I think maybe a little less cream cheese? I'm not sure and will most likely try another recipe first but I did like another reviewer did and added raspberries in the middle - saved it, in my opinion. I would recommend giving the recipe a shot but it didn't work for me.

A simple, delicious pound cake recipe.  The cream cheese really gives it a rich taste.  I baked it in a bundt pan, and it turned out beautiful.

This is exacly like the lemon pound cake I have been cooking for awhile now, only I add 1 tsp of lemon extract and 1 tsp of lemon juice.  and a glaze of 3 tsp lemon juice and cup of confect sugar.  I have my ingredients sitting out now about to cook one up for Sunday I am going to try the cold oven baking tip to see what I come up with.  i'm also going to try to change my flour up to the cake flour and buttermilk like I saw sugested. The cake is already wonderfully moist but never hurt to try new things.

Very good. Didn't have buttermilk, so did not make adjustment to the recipe like the other suggestions. Changed to cake flour and added one tablespoon of lemon juice though. Cake does rise a little, so it'll be good not to over fill the tray. Took 1 hour 30 minutes but came out nicely. Baked from a cold oven too.

This cake is AMAZING. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. I made it and my 3 guy roommates finished it within hours! It has a thick, creamy texture but the firmness of pound cake. I dont like cheesecake so this was the perfect balance! Delish!

This is the first time I have ever made pound cake and it was so simple and absolutely delicious.  I almost purchased a pound cake at the grocery store and it cost $4 for a small cake.  I decided to make this recipe and it tasted better than the one at the store!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Brilliant texture to this cake, dense and moist.  I made it with orange juice and zest with an orange drizzle on top to make it more flavourful.  The only odd bit was the finished product, it dropped quite a bit in the pan and left a tent like topping/crust.  Peeled back easily for a cooks treat ;) and once I put the icing on you never knew the top wasn't right.  Not sure if baking the cake in a loaf pan made the top funny, but I needed 2 smaller cakes for 2 events and this recipe was plenty for 2 smaller cakes.  Flavour wise this cake is fab!

I don't like shortbread and had a bunch of strawberries so I decided to try this pound cake since cream cheese goes so well with strawberries.  This had such a nice texture when done and dough was tastey too!  I was going to cut the recipe in half but accidently added too much butter so I had to add more cream cheese, I ended up using 3- 3oz packs. I put mine in 2- 9" loaf pans and they took a long time to bake. It was atleast an hour if not longer. I am not sure because I would add a few minutes then check again.  Turned out perfect though. I served the sugared strawberries on top.  YUM!

I made this with room temperature cream cheese, eggs and butter. It took a about 15 minutes longer to cook in my oven, and I was worried that it wasn't quite done yet, but didn't want to burn it. After sitting about 10 minutes, it had finished cooking. I brought it for the dessert for Easter dinner with strawberries and everyone LOVED it! I will definitely make this again.

I LOVE this recipe! The only change I made was to decrease the butter to 1 1/4 c and add 1/4 c buttermilk, as suggested in a previous review. I don't know if it made much difference, but the cake is SO good! I started with room-temp butter, cream cheese, and eggs. I beat the butter and cream cheese until very smooth, then added the sugar a little at a time, beating very well until fluffy. I beat in every egg separately, instead of 2 at a time as directed. I baked the cake in a silicone bundt pan. It needed 1 hr 35 min bake time to pass the toothpick test. nice dark golden brown crust, super moist and dense inside. This is my new favorite cake!

This is my favorite pound cake recipe. My family's favorite way to eat it is to slice it up, wrap each slice individually, and freeze it. Then eat it as a treat right out of the freezer while still frozen. Sounds crazy, but chewy and delicious!

It is an excellent recipe and the cake turned out delicious.  To make life a little easier, feel free to use whipped cream cheese.  It's practically the same as regular...just with air in it.  Just make sure to use the same amount weight-wise.  This REALLY helps with the initial beating process.  Cheers

Excellent recipe!  I followed the measurements as they are given.  I used Softasilk Cake Flour instead of regular AP flour, and I used 1 tsp almond extract instead of the vanilla, per other reviewers recommendations.  Also, I added about 1 tsp fresh lemon zest to brighten the flavor.  The cake turned out delicious!  As many other reviewers have said, this recipe turns out a cake with a delicious, dense, soft, flavorful interior, and a lovely crunchy sweet crust on top.  Everyone at Christmas dinner kept picking the crust off the top of the cake as we sat around talking and drinking coffee!  Overall, an excellent recipe...it did not last 24 hours in my house!  Guests loved it.  We served it w/ fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  This is a definite keeper, super easy to make!  I am adding this to my collection of go-to recipes!  Thanks for sharing!!!

This cake was WOW. I did have to cook it 5 minutes longer than called for 1hr 30min. It did rise up really high and with a crusty top. Looked beautiful on the cake plate.

This was my first try, and it turned out perfect. I was concerned for not adding any baking powder, but the end result was delicious. I will make it again.

I just made this pound cake and it tastes wonderful!  My only complaint is that it took FOREVER to completely bake.  I used two loaf pans, checked it after 1 hour, again after 20 more minutes and in total had it in the oven for an hour and 45 minutes or a little more.  Then I had a heck of a time getting it out of the pans even though I had greased and floured them.  Maybe  I did something wrong, but can only give this recipe four stars.

OMG!!! Thanks for this recipe!!! The best cake I ever made, it was so fluffy and moist. The texture is so unbelievable. Absent minded me realized I ran out of vanilla in the middle of mixing the ingredients so I use a 1/4 cup of maple syrup and a sprinkle of ground cinnamon. It was sweet, but so delish. I will make this over and over again with the right ingredients.

Based on the recipe as is I gave this four stars, it is a great start and very good as is. However, if you follow some of the reviewers advice and tweak it to suit you taste then it is easily a 5.

Wonderful pound cake texture, but even with cutting the sugar to 1 cup and increasing the vanilla, it lacked the depth of flavor of a classic pound cake.  It stayed fresh for several days in a covered cake stand.

This is a very good and simple recipe. You have to watch the baking time however. I used a Nordicware " Autumn" themed cake pan and it made a really beautiful presentation. This pound cake has lots of deep rich flavor. I served ith with mixed berries ( blackberries and Raspberries) YUM!!

This cake was delicious.  My family and neighbors really enjoyed.  I stumbled upon this recipe trying to find something that I could bake with the ingredients that I had in the fridge... so worth it.  I highly recommend this recipe to others.  I did not have the browning problem that others discussed... I reduced the oven temperature.

Best poundcake that everyone loves! My bf who absolutely loves pound cake but is brutally honest with my cooking, ate the entire batch (less the 2 pcs I got!) I made one loaf and had enough batter to make about 6 cupcakes. I froze some, and they defrosted fine. SO DELICIOUS!

This is my first time making it and the house smells amazing!  It came out of the oven about 20 mins. ago and I'm trying a little piece right now =) I made it exactly as the recipe stated just to be fair and see how good it was. It's very dense and beautiful.  The only thing I had to alter was the baking time and temp.  I baked at 300F for 1.5 hours (it was browning too quickly at 325) but otherwise it came out exactly as promised.  I'll be trying again but with some alterations and maybe fruit to add more flavor.  As is, it's very plain but a good vessel for fruit and toppings. Thanks!

This is a good recipe I will use again and again, and everyone loved it, however, I cooked it in two layer cake pans, I used 'cake flour', so I didn't have to cook it death (as instructed), which also left it nice and moist.  Loving it!

The cake was delicious. I didn't give it 5 stars because it was a bit too dense for my taste, and by the time the inside was cooked well enough, the outside was too hard. Maybe it needed to be covered for a bit of the baking time. Other than the texture, it really did taste great.

This is my go-to basic pound cake recipe. The exchange of cream cheese for some of the butter in other recipes gives it a nice, subtly differnt flavor.

This cake is amazing! I used organic sugar but only 2 1/2 cups, I substituted buttermilk for 1/2 cup of the butter and I used Lowfat Neufchatel. I also doubled the vanilla per others suggestions. Now this is the best part I replaced all of the flour with soft white wheat flour. I double sifted it, and only folded it in at the last. It cooked in a Bundt pan for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Truly this is the most excellent recipe. Tastes like a moist sugar cookie almost when served warm at least that's what my two teenage daughters said. I wish I could give this recipe more stars if for no other reason than converting so flawlessly without compromising taste, or texture. Today was my birthday and I was craving something to go with fresh raspberries and whipped cream and this is marvelous! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! For posting this recipe.

This is a good pound cake, but I had the same problem another reviewer did in that it looked 'mottled' (for lack of a better word) in the middle.  Because I made this for Fondue night, I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar to 2.5 cups because the chocolate will add more sweetness.  If I was going to be serving this alone, I think I'd want the 3 cups.  I also mixed it for a good long time (while I cleaned up the kitchen) and the batter was gorgeous.  One batch made one large loaf and 4 mini loaves.

I'm only giving this a 4 because I think I'll need to make some high altitude adjustments. It had a great texture but didn't rise into a dome for me (altitude) I made 2 loafs in stoneware, I started it in a cold oven and it took just over an hour. I added a little glaze and served tith Passion Fruit mousse for a dinner party. Raves all around! Thank you.

The BEST pound cake I have ever had.  It made for the best strawberry shortcake.  I only doubled the vanilla and it cooked for exactly 1 hour and 20 minutes like the recipe stated.  Thank you!

This is an amazing recipe! My cake turned out velvety and delicious - it was a big hit with everyone lucky enough to get a piece. I made two alterations to the recipe - I added 1 tbsp vanilla extract instead of 1 tsp and I added some heavy cream for moisture. Also, if you sift the 3 cups of all purpose flour three times, you can ensure the velvety texture :-)

Yummy!  This is a super good pound cake.  It has that crunchy sugary crust on the edges and moist dense center.  Perfect.  I used my wisk attachment on my kitchen-aid to really whip it up.

First time I've ever made a pound cake.  Made it for the boyfriend and he said it was  gooood.  He's a sugar cookie kind of guy so I guess this was right up his alley.  Probaly gonna be makin this one again...if he stays outta the dog house.  :)  Just made it a second time and made some simple changes but it is soooo good.  I elimanated a 1/2 cup white sugar and substituted brown sugar.  I also added a half a package of vanilla pudding and added 3 tablespoons vanilla (i love vanilla!)  Hope yours will turn out just as good as mine!!

This was very good. I added fresh raspberries (like in the picture), and also the zest and juice of one lemon.  The texture was great, and the cake was very moist.  I made mine in two round cake pans, and dusted with powdered sugar before slicing and serving.  Thanks!

Awesome!  I took the suggestions of others and used Swan cake flour and an extra teaspoon of vanilla. I'm salivating just thinking about this cake.  YUM!

WOW!  This is a fantastic pound cake!! Great flavor, great texture!   Made and baked exactly as recipe stated.  Key is BEATING butter and cream cheese, as well as after each addition of eggs. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a light and flavorful pound cake. I've made it using almond flavoring also. I was responsible for coffee type cake between services at church one Sunday. I lie not, when I say I saw several ladies actually wrapping pieces of this cake in napkins and conspicuously slipping it into their purses!

I've been holding off this review for a couple of weeks now.. It never got fully eaten =( Not sure why though, it tasted good but it just sat amptly on the counter all week until finally I gave it to the dog. Who didn't even want it!!! It was great in the Easter trifle I made, however, so I'd like to thank you for that. But I don't think I'd make it again..maybe we jsut don't like pound cake or MAYBE they wanted frosting..hoo humm..Thanks for sharing!!

Great recipe! I grew up with all butter pound cakes, but adding the cream cheese gives it an added dimension. I beat the dickens out of the butter/cheese mix, then added sugar gradually. After adding the rest of the ingredients, I stirred in 1 tsp. grated orange rind and 1 TBLsp. orange juice. The batter was so creamy, it was good enough to eat right from the mixing bowl! The cake baked up nice and velvety. Just like Great-Grandma's!

This poundcake is a-mazing!  I've been making it for years, and it's devoured each and every time!  I usually make half of the recipe and make a loaf.  It's wonderfully moist, rich in flavour, dense but still cake-like, and the golden yellow color is so lovely!  Thanks for this recipe.

I am very grateful to the reviewer who mentioned she checked doneness with a toothpick and found her cake raw in the middle.  I made this pound cake for a church carnival cake walk and it looked so nice when I got it cooled and glazed. Then I read her review and got worried.  I had baked the cake for 1 hour and 25 minutes and used the toothpick test on it. It looked beautifully brown and had cooked for close to the recommended time so I took it out, let it cool and put a beautiful lemon glaze on it.  After reading the review I thought I'd better cut it in half to check and it was doughy in the middle.  I would have been embarrassed if someone had won that cake and cut into the doughy mess.  I bake a lot but pound cakes only once in a while.The outside bits tasted very good - just wish I had cooked it long enough.

This was the best pound cake I've ever eaten! I followed other's recommendations and added 1/4 cup buttermilk, let eggs butter and cream cheese come to room temperature and mixed the sugar in a steady stream as it was mixing.  also added about a 1/2 T of lemon extract and started baking in a cold oven. I'm getting ready to make this again as the first batch went so quickly!

when I made this my grandfather told me it was some of the best cake he'd ever had in his life!! Everyone one else like it too. I'm a beginner so this was the first time I'd ever made a cake that didn't involve a box-mix.  The only thing that kind of went a little differently was that I had to cook it much longer than the recipe said to. But that was probably just my old oven being weird.

This cake was good but nothing extraordinary.  The cream cheese definately makes it noticably creamier but I prob wont make it again.  Not a ton of flavor.

Wonderful!  This recipe has just enough cream cheese to give a subtle c.c. taste to the pound cake.  The cake bakes beautifully and holds together when sliced and transfered to plate.  I enjoy this as a breakfast treat, toasted, with a touch of light butter.

This was absolutely delicious.  The cream cheese made it very nice.  I did what one reviewer said and used 1/4 cup buttermilk.  It was very good.  We shared half with a friend who just had a baby.

This is a wonderful recipe. Followed the directions exactly. The only change I made was in adding 1 teaspoon of lemon flavoring along with the 1 teaspoon of vanilla. That's it! My family really loves this pound cake. I will definitely keep this recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly and baked it in two loaf pans, adding fresh raspberries in one of the pans. The batter did not rise nearly as much as I had expected or would have preferred. The result was two very dense pound cakes. The center was still very gooey by the time the edges were done and I had to cook for longer than the recipe called for. After the cakes were cooled I used a knife to carve off the dry corners. The one with raspberries I piped decorative stripes of mascarpone lemon and raspberry cream cheese icing onto, and the plain one I made a chocolate icing and a coconut icing to decorate it with. With the help of the icing the finished cakes were tasty and enjoyable, but far too dense for my preference. I will definitely not choose to use this recipe again.

What a great pound cake recipe! I don't have a tube or Bundt pan, and this filled 2 loaf pans just perfectly. It came out very moist and yummy, with a great outer 'crust' and was sweet & golden inside. Much better than any 'box' pound cake, perfect for warmed fruit topping and whip cream. Definitely a keeper!

This is my go to recipe whenever I have the craving for pound cake. I've made this for years for pot lucks, family gatherings, holiday parties, and everyone who's tried it loved the density, the moistness, and flavor of this cake! I've made this cake as the recipe states, and sometimes I would cut back the sugar by a half cup if I don't want it too sweet. All in all, it's a great cake!

Very good! Both my kids inhaled 2 pieces, and that, to me, is the sign of good food! My hubby and I really enjoyed it, too. I thawed out and sugared some strawberries to put on it. The only thing missing was whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, but next time...

Velvety texture and perfect density! I've tried other pound cake recipes from allrecipes but this is hands down the best.  Made a few modifications: two teaspoons of grated lemon peel for a nice subtle lemon flavor. (And don't grate the white of rind ladies just the yellow) and upped the vanilla to one teaspoon. Will make again tomorrow since half of it is already gone!

I'm really dissatisfied with how the texture turned out on this, but I'm pretty sure that's my own fault for putting in too many eggs at once while distracted on the phone. But not only that, the flavor turned out rather disappointing too... will be making again to make sure it wasn't something I did, but in the meantime I'm rating this a rather average pound cake.

I have been using this recipe for years.  I have tried over 50 pound cake recipes and this is by far the best.  I also add a teaspoon of Almond extract.  Gives it a delicious nutty flavor.  Use this cake as your starting point.  Then add to it what you like best.  It will adapt to whatever you put in it.  The best!!

This smells amazing when it is baking.  The cake is delicious and versatile, I either top the slices with fresh berries or drizzle some chocolate on the plates to give it a little something extra.  I will make this again for sure.

Heavenly cake. So many ways to dress it up.Drizzle plate with chocolate and caremel syrup, lay on a piece of cake, sprinkle with powdered sugar and on the side a couple of fresh strawberries dipped in white and dark chocolate.Yummy!! Ps..I use 3 tsp. almond extract and 3 tsp. vanilla or 6 of just one.( any flavor to your taste will do)

This was excellent.  I halved it and baked in a loaf pan but I did regret b/c it overflowed a bit and didn't cook right.  Tasted awsome and nice velvety texture.  It was ugly but we mowed it.  Next time I will do the full recipe.  I bet it freezes great.  Thanks!

I typically don't care for pound cake but tried this because of the great reviews, it was delicious! I made it just as the recipe calls, starting with everything at room temperature. I have now made three in the past week for friends.

First of all I love pound cakes, the only person who has ever made the best pound cake has been my mother-in-law. Now that I am not living close to home, I had to find a recipe that wasn't too hard, I found it with this recipe, it turned out GREAT.....I did add a little of lemon flavoring and other than that it was good. My son who does not like cakes ate three slices. I am so excited about this recipe and can't wait to call my mother-in-law.

This is soooo wonderful! I made this for my husband to take to his fire station to his fellow fire fighters and they ALL asked for the recipe. It is spectacular!

This was so deeeee-lish!  The inside was dense yet springy while the outside was kinda crunchy.  I followed the recipe to a tee and it turned out wonderfully.

I found this pound cake while searching for a good pound cake recipe. I have made this pound cake many times and it is always a hit! I have added lemon extract or orange extract in place of the vanilla  extract and it still comes out perfect. The only change that I have made is that I beat the eggs in one at a time instead of two at a time. This pound cake is a must try for anyone who loves a heavy and dense but great pound cake!!!

This is a great poundcake, and very versatile (-you can add any extract you want, and it'll still be good).  I used the almond extract as many recommended, and had mashed strawberries on the side for my guests to add if they wished.  It was very tasty - strawberries or no strawberries.  I am debating about presentation though.  I made it in a bundt pan and it looks like a plain yellow cake without the frosting.  Some people suggested adding a glaze - I would consider that.  It doesn't need one for taste, but it might give the cake a more finished look.

This pound cake was very easy to make & tastes wonderful!  I followed another users advice & only put in 2 1/2 cups of sugar so it wasn't overly sweet.  I also added 2 teaspoons of almond extract & it added a wonderful light flavor to complement the vanilla.  I used the Pro Ganache recipe to cover my cake & it tastes wonderful!  I suggest not trying your cake out until it completely cools though.  I was bummed when I tried it warm & it wasn't what I thought it would taste like but after cooling over night it was absolutely heavenly!  We'll see how bunko likes it tonight!

Oh my goodness, what a delicious cake.  This is one of those cakes you just keep cutting away at because the texture and flavor is so wonderful.  My Mother in Law makes a similar cake and even though I love hers best, this comes close!

Excellent recipe!  I would not change a thing!  I used two loaf pans instead of the tube pan and was able to share one with a neighbor - much to my husbands dismay!  : )  This was dense, flavorful and downright perfect!

I wasn't real crazy about the crunchy outside of this cake, but I'll make it again because it had good taste and texture.  I may try cutting the sugar a bit next time too.

I figured this recipe was a safe bet for a get together this morning because I wasn't sure how you can go wrong with a pound and a half of butter, three cups of sugar, a brick of cream cheese, half a dozen eggs and flour ... and apparently you can't. The funniest part of the morning was when one friend was eating her second piece and asked if I had any Splenda for her coffee.  "Um, I don't think I'd worry about the few calories in a teaspoon of sugar..." But WOW was it good.

OOoh very nice! Just trying to clear up the egg and cream cheesecake as it was just about to start rotting.
I only had two eggs, so I had to reduce the recipe for two eggs worth. I "spilt" vanilla extract a bit too much but it was not much of a problem. 

I cooked mine in a cake tin, for the temp and time it calls for. Spot on!
Thanks for the recipe.

This is a very good cake. It is easy to mix up, and like another reviewer posted, the batter is delicious.  I did have to cook it about 15 minutes longer than called for, but my oven is older.  I will definately make this again!!!

When I first made this, I made the mistake of not greasing and flouring the pan. I also added some white chocolate chips with it. Between my famil and I, it was gone in a week, we loved it!

I made this & gave it to my mom today for her birthday. I used 2.5 cups of sugar, added lemon extract & made a glaze using lemon juice & powdered sugar. This is a great, basic recipe. You can make it as-is or experiment with different flavors.

This is a great tasting pound cake. The only thing is it needs a glaze or something on it. So I will try to make the Satin Chocolate Glaze, like someone else here recommended. Thanks!

This was a great, easy cake.  Will use as a base for many cakes to come.  Took more like 2 hours to bake.

I made this cake for my godmother who had just lost her husband.  I didn't get to taste it before I delivered it to her, but it smelled and looked really tasty.  I cooked it for 1 hour and 30 minutes.  My sister, however, did get to taste it and she said it was really heavy for her taste, but otherwise very moist and good texture.  It reminded me of the 7-Up pound cake I usually make...I probably will make it again because the recipe is so easy.

Very good, made this for husbands birthday and topped with Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe from this site as well as glaze made with 1/4c blackberry jam, 2 T apple juice, 1 T brandy.  It was to die for!  So good, thankyou!  Also, I only needed to bake mine for 1 hour 10 min and it was ready.

this cake was absoulutely fabulous! i had made it in a bundt cake pan and i had to cook it a little longer because the outside was done and the inside wasnt but it came out great anyways. i let it cool and made a chocolate "drizzle" to go over it and it was great. i made this for co-workers and it was gone in a matter of minutes..they loved it!  this is definitely a keeper. thanks :)

This was sooooo good - moist, dense, creamy and heavenly that one of my friends mistook it for "modified" cheesecake!  I did not have a bundt pan, so I used 2 cake pans and prepared as I would a layer cake.  Will make many times again!

I added 1 tsp of baking soda, and 1 tblsp almond extract. I also added about 1.5 cups frozen raspberrys. It took quite a long time to cook, I think because of the added moisture from the raspberrys, but it tasted great :)

Extremely easy to make, very dense and yummy.  I added fresh fruit and strawberries to my piece, my kids and hubby ate plain.  Delicious both ways.  I froze individual pieces and they tasted no different.  I'm making another cake today!

Its REALLY YUMMY! Its moist.. thats a good thing. The recipe makes a LOT of cake though.. so I recommend that you decrease the ingredients.. Way too much sugar though. I added 3 cups like it said to and it was just too much! Geez. You only need like 2 cups of sugar, the MOST. Trust me.

OMG! This cake is sinfully delicious! I made this cake from my mom to cheer her up after coming home from the hospital, and it did the job. The only problem is that the family ate it so fast that mom only got one piece. I have NEVER seen a cake go so fast.I had to make it again the next day - threefold! One for my mom, one for her kids, and one for the grandkids. Thank you, Nanci

i love this. I often have a little that falls (despite ing. @ room temp) so last time I added 1/2 tsp of bkg soda/or powder, I can't remember which. I love to add 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp lemon, 1/2 tsp coconut, and 1/8-1/4 almond extracts! For special occasions I will do dots of icing on the cake with those same flavorings. It is SO good. Try the flavorings if you like those tastes.

I have NEVER liked pound cake - UNTIL I made this one. It is absolutely delicious. I use my counter-top mixer to get a really fluffy whipped batter. Everyone who tries it says it is the best pound cake they have ever had!

I gave this one 4 stars because my kids really liked it.  I agree with another reviewer who said the finished product had an eggy taste, so it wasn't a favorite of mine.  The batter reminded me of sugar cookie dough!

Wow, what a difference cheese cream makes! I've only tried making plain poundcake before - but never again! This recipe is YUUUUMMY.  I added more vanilla than called for (3 tsp) and only added  2 1/2 cups of sugar ( next time I might lower it to two). Like the poundcake I tried previously, I felt like I was beating cement mix towards the end but this cake turned out nice and moist.  Will definitely make this again and again!
