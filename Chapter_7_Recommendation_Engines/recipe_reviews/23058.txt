I haven't tried this particular perogy recipe, but a genral tip for perogy dough making: Reserve the water you boiled your potatoes in, and use that to make your dough. The starch makes the dough easier to roll and handle.

I followed the recipe for the most part to make the dough, but my polish family always sauteed ground beef and sauerkraut together in a pan and then used this mixture to stuff the dough.  Also after we boil the perogies, we always fry them in a pan with onions.  Not the healthiest meal, but it is very good.  I am not really sure what the "traditional" filling is, but my family either used potatos and cheese or this ground beef version, which is  the family favorite.  We also always served potato salad and coleslaw and my grandfathers homemade polish kielbasa!

I used this recipe only for the dough, and added some fresh cracked pepper for a little flavour.  Make sure you keep the dough thick enough, or they all fall apart when boiled!

The flavour of these perogies was so much better than store-bought!  But I had way way way too much potato filling - I got 17 perogies out of the batch, and used maybe 1/3 of the potato mixture.  I'd cut the potatoes to 2 lbs, bacon to 1/3 lb, and the cheese to 1/2 cup next time.

This was a great recipie. My kids and family love the pototo version and have asked for it several times since I first made it. It is time consuming though. I use peppered bacon, and fry the boiled perogies in the bacon grease. My only problem was there wasn't enough dough.  I had to double that part of the recipie. My husband took some to work, and a coworker offered to pay me to make some for him! Thank you, Doris

I couldn't rate the kid part because I didn't feed this to a child, but I thought they rocked!  Fantastic flavor.  I made a vegetarian version however, which is really the authentic way anyhow.  I used smoked mozzerlla and aged white cheddar though.  The smoked flavor is incredible!  I also fried them in olive oil and onions.  Thank you.

They take awhile to make, but well worth it! My family loved them! They said that they tasted MUCH better than store bought! I make a whole bunch, and freeze them! That way I can have a great snack anytime!!!! Thank you!

AWFUL.followed recipe, found filling rather bland. recipe made way too much potato filling for the amount of perogies that i was able to get out of the dough. will not make again. the ones in the freezer at the grocery store are much better!

Like several of the others I used this mainly for the dough. I tripled the recipe and added fresh pepper and garlic to flavor. (For the middle I just used instant mashed potatoes, sharp cheese, Romano Cheese, and diced onions) - From start to finish which includes clean up of all the mess and getting the Perogies into the freezer (and a couple of diaper changes- yeah I washed my hands), it took me three hours. It made a total of 56 perogies that are comparable to the store bought size (I did take another reviewers advice and made them a little thicker to insure they did not fall apart). I gave a couple to my little ones with melted butter and sour cream, as well as myself - they passed! I made 8 servings of mashed potatoes - only needed about half but we will enjoy the left overs! I have never tried fry them and will try so with a batch I know have in the freezer. Thanks!

this is a very good recipe. when i make them i allways use potato,bacon,onion,hamburger,cheese for the filling. if you try making the filling with meat, you will never go back to plain potato. I even mack them with seafood, they are great.

This recipe was a total and complete disaster. I have never had dough stick to itself as bad as this dough did. It was extremely hard to roll out and would not hold its shape when cut.  I laid my perogies on each other in overlapping rows just like I have every time I have made them. They all stuck together. I tried to salvage as many as possible by cutting them apart with a knife, but it was a total disaster.

I made my own filling so I can't rate the filling in this recipe.

Do not use this recipe to make your dough. You've been warned.

I tried this recipe and I might of changed it a little and it worked for me... I got 50 instead of 16 perogies out of this recipe. I made mine into half moon shapes and maybe a little smaller, but still a perfect size. I also added some sauted onions and a little fried bacon to taste in the potatoe mix. The recipe really worked. I will be using it alot...

I doubled this recipe for my family, and it made 26 bigger than palm sized perogies. Everyone loved them (filling i picked was potato, bacon, and cheddar). I boiled them first, then fried and added some extra shredded cheddar onto which just melted from the heat. I also used slightly less water than it called for, in fear the dough may become to sticky. SOOOOO YUMMY.

I grew up always making perogies for Chrismas Eve so this year I thought I'd try mixing some Polish heritage to my TX born husbands taste. I used a filling of garlic mashed potatoes, jalapenos, bacon and cheddar cheese. They turned out great! Served with fried onions and a little melted butter.

The cheesey potato filling was fabulous!  Unfortunately, the dough was really hard to make.  The end texture just wasn't the same as store bought.  So even though they were really tasty, the effort involved is hard to justify the need to make these from scratch.  On the other hand, the filling is great as a side dish on its own!

I found the dough in this recipe to be too sticky and as others noted, not enough for the amount of filling. I omitted the egg in the second batch of dough I made and just added enough water to create a good consistency. I didn't try this filling but I made one with the following ingredients:
butter, milk, clove garlic, grated onion, fresh parsley, parmesan cheese, and nutmeg, salt ,and pepper to taste.
It turned out phenomenal!!

This was an excellent recipe.  But 5 lbs is way too much for the potato amount.  My wife changed this around a bit and left out the bacon and just used sauteed yellow onions, potatoes and mild shredded cheddar cheese.  Then we boiled them first and then sauteed them in a pan of butter and bread crumbs.  They tasted just like my polish step mother makes.  But for one batch you probably only need 1 - 2 lbs of potatoes.

Tried this recipe as it differed from my own (my mom's) and can't compare it to store bought as I've had the pleasure of never tasting store bought.  I make large batches and have never used egg in my dough recipe as egg makes the dough tougher and dry out faster - thus not sticking as well as it should.  But I tried it and found the dough was much stiffer than the soft, pillowy dough I use to make mine.

I am only reviewing the dough from this recipe. It was not to my liking. Rolled out fine, had good elasticity but was not fork tender after cooking. You should feel no resistance when trying to slice the pierogy. This dough is nothing like real pierogy dough.

Hands down the whole recipe was great! When forming the pierogie. I roll out the dough and cut a circular piece out. Set on top of the piece a portion of filling. After, fold the pierogie in half and use a fork to seal the edge. I holds together very well and look more appetizing. Also frying in onion is the way to go!

It was hard to get the dough thin enough for the perogies.  I used the bacon filling, and I made a filling with potato, cheese, and beef.  Very good, and they freeze very well.

I made the potato version of the filling. It tasted so good! However, the filling was way too much for the dough. Or maybe i just didnt roll it out thin enough? I loved the perogies my school cafeteria makes. The ones i made tasted exactly the same! if not better! All i can say is wow...this recipe ended my perogie cravings.

The dough was a little sticky at first, but I just kneeded it with some flour after I mixed it up, then when I rolled it out I used a lot of flour.  It worked great after that.  I used my own filling, but the dough was great.  Oh, and I doubled the dough recipe so I could have some to freeze for later.  It definatly made enough.

I gave this a five because I found the dough easy to work with. I didn't use this filling because I had mine already made up. Really enjoyed this recipe otherwise. Thank you for it

The dough for the perogies was the best I have ever worked with.  I did improvise on the filling as I was really only looking for a good perogie dough.

This recipe produced some of the best tasting perogies I've ever had. I made the filling less bland by adding my own spices, I tripled the dough recipe so that there wouldn't be that much extra potatoe. We had it with sausage and everyone loved it. Definatly better fried then boiled.

These are the best!  So much better than store bought.  My 11 year old son helped me roll and stuff.  They are time consuming to make, but we had fun doing it.  The filling was just right, taste it to check on the seasoning before filling, you can always adjust to your own taste.  The dough was a little sticky for me, so I had to add more flour.  I also only used 1 - 2 lb of potatoes.  I still have potatoes left and will have to make more dough tomorrow to finish it up. Mine will never stand up to my Mother-in-law's but these will have to do!

My Polish Grandmother taught me to make pierogis by browning onions in corn oil and adding them to the hot mashed potatoes with white american cheese and a generous seasoning of salt and pepper.  We also serve these with fried onions and a creamy sauce made with mushrooms, milk, and butter.  Try this for an authentic pierogi experience.

The recipe for the dough was good! However, the potato and cheese mix was great (I added some finely minced onion) but  I think the ingredient list had an error - no way did it take 5 pounds of baking potatoes. I only used 3 pounds and I still had plenty left after filling up 24 perogies. Mark

I used 1 cup semolina flour and 1 cup brown rice flour, egg replacer, little olive oil and ground flax seeds to make this a little healthier/vegan friendly.  All the filling was vegan too. Sprayed non stick pan with Pam after I boiled them and it tasted awesome.

Great dough recipe - I used my own filling in an attempt to recreate what my Finnish grandmother used to fill hers with (a mixture of potato, milk, Velveeta, salt and pepper)  and they turned out great (although a few split open in the pot - my error though; I think I'll have to invest in a perogy shaper). Fried them afterwards with bacon and onions and served with sour cream. Mmmmmm.

I'm only giving this 2 stars because even though I followed the dough recipe exactly, it was way too sticky to even handle, nevermind rolling out.  I made my own filling, so I don't know how the filling in this recipe would have turned out.

Same ingredients my Polish grandmother taught my mother and I to use.  A variation on the potato filling in my house is to boil the potatoes in salted water, drain when cooked, and then add American or Cheddar cheese and finely diced carmalized onions and the butter they were cooked in.    I use farmer's cheese for the cheese version and to that I add 1 jumbo egg per 2 lbs of cheese, salt and pepper.

These were really good! I love perogies, and thought they'd be hard to make. However, using this recipe, I found them very easy. The dough is just as good as store boughten ones, and wasn't hard to seal. I took the advise from other reviews and made less potato. I made 3.5 lb instead of 5 lb, and still had half of it left, so doubling the dough batch is a must. I made both bacon and onion ones, boiled them for about 4-5 minutes, then browned them on both sides. Delicious!

I was looking for something with bacon and cheese to make for my toddler after he had lost some weight from being ill. He hasn't tried them yet but I loved them and that was without frying them. This was my first time making and trying them and I was very pleasantly surprised. I used wholemeal flour as that is what was on hand, and I added a combination of garlic and onion salt in place of the plain salt for the pastry. The pastry also sat for a few hours before I actually got to use it as my toddler was keeping me busy. I had no hassles with stickiness etc, it rolled out beautifully. Thanks for an excellent recipe. (eta-toddler has since tried them and loved them also, so it's definitely now worth 5 stars)

This is the same, almost, recipe I learned long ago but I use some sauteed onion and some sasuage also.  The comment about the dough too thin is absolute no matter what recipe is used, otherwise it becomes a stew which is not too bad in it's self :-).

These were great according to my boyfriend.  I will say , though, that the dough needs to be at least doubled if not more because the mixtures make a lot of filling.

Wow, what a great recipe!  All of the filling options are tasty; these disappear in a flash.  Quite time-consuming to make, but after I made them once my husband swore we'd never buy perogies again.  I'm currently making a huge batch to freeze so we can eat them after we have our third baby!

i was quite skeptical before i started as i've never made perogies before, but these turned out great. i followed the dough recipe exactly but for the potato/cheese filling i just used a pack of instant mash potatoes to save time and about a handful of cheddar cheese and salt and pepper. i boiled them and then fried them in butter till they were brown and served with sour cream. they were delicious. leftovers froze well.

I live in residence at university but want to avoid the storebought, processed meals that all the other students live on. So, I made a triple batch of these, and keep a big bag of them in the freezer. I added a generous amount of garlic, pepper, and Garlic Tabasco to the potato filling, and I must say that frying them is essential - they taste absolutely perfect that way (along with a huge amount of caramelized onions, of course.) Thank you for this delicious alternative to storebought food... my pierogi cravings have been (temporarily) satisfied!

This review is for the potato filling, I didn't try the sauerkraut filling, and used a different recipe for the dough. The potato filling turned out great, but there was far too much left over, and my dough recipe was more than the one here. I recommend cooking the potatoes longer so they are very soft, this way you get a creamier filling. My partner said they were the best perogies he's ever had  :-)  I'm going to use the leftover filling to make potato soup.

The sauerkraut filling tastes fantastic with the sour cream in it.  I added some roasted garlic to the potatoes just because I like garlic potatoes.  This is an easy and really good recipe.

Everything worked out well except I actually used 5 lbs of potatoes .  I ended up with a lot of filling left over.
The dough should be doubled and then the filling would all be used.

Easy dough recipe. Didn't try the filling recipe. A long standing tradition for my family is to fry in butter and eat with maple syrup. I know it sounds weird, just try it.

I was missing a few of the filing ingredients so I just used leftover mashed potatoes with cream spinach and some shredded cheese. 
I served them with chicken bacon already.
This is definitely something I'll make again. A hit in my house.

I was concerned that the perogies would come apart during boiling but they didn't. Definatly sautee them afterwards in butter though, adds a little bit more of finishing touch.

I made my own filling just snagged this for the dough. I have made many different dough types for other dishes so I have  experience with dough and this one was very sticky I am not sure if the author used a smaller egg or if they typoed on the amount of flour. I used a large egg and ended up adding another cup of flour before it was a consistency that I could actually work with.  Perhaps perogie dough is intended to be stickier than most but even in that case it was entirely too sticky to roll out on any surface with any tool.

I feel the proportions of the ingredients for the dough and the fillings are completely off.  I was only able to make 17 wrappers and soooo much filling left.  Also I couldn't get the dough thin enough, so I possibly could've been able to make more.    

I made both fillings, potato and sauerkraut.  I actually preferred the saurkraut and bacon filling.  So much more flavor!!  

I would make this again but would experiment with the dough.  Or just not make as much filling!  I just ate the left over as mashed potato side so not a huge deal.

The dough was wonderful! The filling I guess I made a few changes. I had a bag of potatoes that were starting to grow. I peeled them and cut them in about quarters. I put them in my small crackpot. I added garlic powder, onion flakes, sea salt, pepper and about 1/2 Cup of water. I put them on low from about 10:30p.m. till I got up for work at 7a.m., give or take 20minutes. I then put the pot with lid into the fridge till about 9p.m.. I took a small amount in a bowl. Heated in the nuke just to taste. That's when I knew that they should be perogies! The next night I mashed the potatoes and made the dough. They were GREAT!!!!! Just an idea for potatoes that are about to go bad.

These were so easy to make. I was surprised at how sticky the dough is. I divided the dough into small dough balls and then rolled each one individually. The more you work the dough the tougher your perogy will be.  I will be making another batch tomorrow! Thank you

Very good, but I have to agree with previous poster; too much potato filling for the amount of dough.  Half the filling and triple the filling and it should work fine. I also agree, sautee the perogies in with the bacon and onion, than top with sour cream.

They taste pretty good, not much different flavor from the store ones except with these you can change up the filling and you actually know what goes in them.
Rolling individual balls through a pasta machine helps get the dough really thin. For some reason when I try and run the whole sheet through it just ends up breaking though.

These came out great!  The dough and I got along better the second time I made them.  There was a lot of extra filling compared to the amount of dough.  The second time I made them I added more cheese to the potato.  Fun, I look forward to mixing up the filling ingredients.

Perogies are honored tradition in my family.  We know our perogies.  The only change I made was that instead of putting the bacon in the potatoes I sauteed the bacon with onions slowly until it was cooked down and soft then put it over the cooked perogies.  Huge hit! Really good dough.  Easy to work with and I am a horrible failure with other doughs.  Potatoes do outweigh the dough, I had to make 2 batches to match the potatoes.

These were my first perogies so I dont know how they are supposed to taste, but I really liked this recipe. I dont think they make a very good dinner though, more of an appetizer. I also used instant potatoes.
