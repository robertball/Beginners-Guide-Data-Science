I added extra onion and garlic with only 3 cups of corn.  I used an immersion blender.  Did not like the "sludgy" quality of the corn so I strained it.  This definitely improved the soup, in my opinion. The taste is quite subtle, though.  Garnished with cilantro and a squeeze of lime.

This was scrumptious and easy to make. Will add it to my rotation of summer soups!

This soup tastes like summer.  I suggest adding bacon and a squeeze of lime on top.
