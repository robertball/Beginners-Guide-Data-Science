Gregg is not fond of quiches.  I think the pie crust should be poked and baked at 400 so that it is baked through.

Very easy.  I cooked the shell at 400 for 10 mins.  Also added a bit more bacon, fried my own onions in the bacon fat, and used 1 cup of mixed cheeses I had on hand.  It was very good and super moist! I was afraid to try a quiche, but now I wonder why!

This tasted pretty good.  I left out the French fried onions since my husband doesn't like them, but I think it would have been better made exactly according to the recipe.  The Worcestershire sauce was a nice touch.

My husband said it was okay, but I thought it had a funny flavor, maybe the french fried dried onions.  I don't think I'll be making this one again.  I usually can rely on the reviews of others, but I was disappointed in this one.  Sorry.

I made this for a family brunch and the entire family loved it!  Now I am always asked to make it!  It is very easy too.  Next time I want to try making it in a 13X9 dish because we have a very large family and I would rather have two 13x9 dishes in the oven instead of 4 pies.

It is an easy quiche and was eaten in its entirety by the family  How ever I thought it was too salty from the onions. I don't think I will make again for the reason there just are too many quiche recipes out there to try and this one just wasn't a personal favorite.

I cooked the shell at 400 for 10 minutes, didn't take much time to cool it, and made sure to only use the listed amount of french fried onions (2 and 3/4 oz). I certainly didn't want to use even an entire small can.  My husband and I liked it... my toddler's vote doesn't count because he's so picky! Can't wait to have the leftovers for breakfast.  Easy to make--I'll serve this to any overnight guests.

I used it as a base for making up my own concoction. I took 1/2 green pepper 1/2 onion 5 strips of bacon and food processor then into oven to cook put this in bottom of the baked shell cover with cheese then cover with 4 eggs and sour cream mix I like it a lot I'm thinking about adding spinach leaves on top of bac/oni/pep mix in oven and deep dish shell.

Such a huge fan! I use a few less yolks and a few more whites. So far my favorite filling is caramelized onion, ham, cheddar and broccoli. Great base recipe with the ability to get creative.

Instead of bacon I used crumbled turkey sausage and saut√©ed onions to replace the canned onions. Delish. My kids love it with cheese grits for breakfast.

Very good! Used ham instead of bacon.
