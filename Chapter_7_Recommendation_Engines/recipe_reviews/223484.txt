This produced a great ice cream! I did two things differently: I mixed the ingredients up in a bowl using a hand mixer and everything combined nicely. I did chill the mix overnight, then put it in the ice cream freezer. The freezer recommended 20 to 30 minutes in the freezer, and I found it needed to run closer to the 30 minutes' time. The only thing I recommend against is combining the ingredients in the freezer bowl because when it's frozen, the ingredients will start to freeze before they are fully combined. I agree with a previous reviewer: this ice cream is outstanding even without the PB cups added in.

FANTASTIC! I did have issue w/ it coming to 'soft serve' stage in my ice cream maker, but there may be a problem w/ it and no fault of the recipe. I mixed all of the ingredients (used reg. peanut butter), in a bowl to make sure they combined well. I had a hard time getting the peanut butter to fully incorporate, but it was mixed through enough. This ice cream was so creamy and had great flavor (the peanut butter flavor really came through). I used mini Reeses cups (the real small ones) that I just cut in 1/2. I would've liked this just as much w/o the pb cups added to be honest...the ice cream is that flavorful on it's own w/o the additions, but it was wonderful w/ them too! This was just too simple... I would def make this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Absolutely fantastic!  The only change I will make with the next batch will be to cut back slightly on the sugar.  This is a very rich, creamy ice cream and a little goes a long way.  I also didn't bother with the plastic wrap - just popped it into a container and into the freezer after it was done mixing.  My husband just loved it!

Really good ice cream!  Made it several times!  The first time I made it as the recipe is written.  MMMM.  The subsequent times I left out the sugar and it was plenty sweet enough with the sweetened condensed milk.  Boy is it delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

I've made this twice - first time followed directions other than used 2% milk and did not add candy. It was delicious! Second time used light soymilk instead of whole milk and didn't add any sugar, and it was still delicious! Not to mention had many fewer calories and less sugar. Best peanut butter ice cream I've ever had.

Really easy! Peanut butter and ice cream...WIN!! I however cut out the sugar all together with the sweetened condensed milk it was sweet enough for me and used almond milk rather than whole for a creamy and nutty flavor then finished it with a pinch of salt! tastes like cookies grandma used to make!

I am WAY too into peanut butter. That being said, I have made this 3 times, and I usually have to double the recipe because it goes FAST. I leave out the extra sugar and the PB cups because we don't really need them. 

Besides just eating this plain (which is amazing), we also use it to make ice cream sandwiches, using chocolate chip cookies for the outsides. Seriously good with perfect peanut butter flavor.

This was fabulous!  My 11-yr-old made it --it was very easy.  We used 2% milk and slightly less sugar, as suggested by some other reviewers. We liked eating it right away while it was still soft, but it is good after being frozen also. Will definitely be making this again!

This ice cream is awesome! My new favorite ice cream. It turned  out very rich and creamy. I used 2% milk instead of whole milk and increased the peanut butter to 3/4 cup.

This was the best ice cream I've ever had. Seriously! I'm making it again tonight and will probably cut the sugar down to 1/8, but it was absolutely delicious. Will be in our rotation of favorites for sure :)

Absolutely delicious if you're a peanut butter lover. The ice cream was creamy and rich, almost like the ice cream version of peanut butter fudge. I did not add the sugar since the condensed milk is plenty sweet and I'm glad I did not. I'm a sweets lover, but I think I'll alter the recipe next time to cut down on the sugar further. I did increase the peanut butter a bit, and at the end added mini Reese's cups and Rolos (I wouldn't recommend the Rolos because they turn into frozen mini caramel popsicles that shatter and then take a while to melt in your mouth). I blended all the ingredients before putting in the ice cream maker, to avoid the peanut butter clumping. Enjoy!

Just made this with my kids and they love it! We mixed it in a blender rather than mixing it in the ice cream maker which made it super easy to mix the peanut butter in(put the peanut butter in the blender last) I left out the sugar and used two very ripe bananas instead and it turned out great. If you like peanut butter and bananas try it!! It was VERY rich so you dont need much to satisfy your sweet tooth ;) Great recipe thanks for sharing!!!!

I omitted the sugar and chilled the peanut butter cups, then put them in the food processor for about 15 seconds right after the ice cream was done. Folded the crumbles into the ice cream and pour some straight into a glass for a milkshake. Wonderful! Froze the remainder in a covered plastic bowl. Will definitely make again!!

This ice cream never set, and was soupy despite an extra ten minutes in my ice cream maker. We found the peanut butter taste too subtle using such a small amount. I get better results just using fresh heavy cream and milk 2:1, a pinch of salt, and a cup of chunky peanut butter. No cans.

VERY easy to make and my kids loved it.  (I mixed it in the blender after reading numerous reviews here.)  My son said it was the best ice cream he has ever eaten.  I'll definitely make it again.  I liked that it wasn't a custard base so it didn't have to chill in the fridge for several hours before putting it in the ice cream maker. Thank you for the recipe!

This is a terrific recipe. Followed the ingredients exactly. Put everything except the milk in my freezer canister, mixed the ingredients thoroughly with my immersion blender and then added the milk. This hardened up in 30-40 minutes. Since we were not ready for dessert, I put the ice cream into my freezer to "cure". It was firm enough to eat once the ice cream freezer stopped. Very good flavor. Twenty hours later the left over ice cream is still good--no grainyness in texture and while quite firm, I could spoon it right out of the storage container. If it did not set up, maybe you did not have the right salt/ice proportions.

This is the best pb ice cream I have ever had! It is so simple to make. I just threw the ingredients in my ice cream maker and let that do the work. I recommend putting the plastic wrap over that will keep it from getting ice crystals. Smooth and creamy!

This was my first attempt making ice cream (brand new ice cream maker!). I used skim milk, fat free evaporated milk, fat free sweetened condensed milk and PB2. My family thought it came out pretty good! I also added mini peanut butter cups (cut in half)..about 3 oz.

I love peanut butter ice cream so I searched and searched for the perfect recipe- I found it.  This is SOOOOOO good.  My daughter made it for her 12th birthday- it was easy to make and so delicious.  We did mix it in a bowl first before we put it in the ice cream maker and we did not even bother with the chocolate candy- it was too good all by itself.  This is a new family favorite.  Thanks!

Tastes great, however I had a hard time with the peanut butter. I kind of just wound up with vanilla ice cream and two big globs of peanut butter (not even ribbons of PB like I thought might happen). Next time I will use a blender to mix all of the ingredients together before I put it in my ice cream maker. Also, instead of peanut butter cups I just added milk chocolate chips. Delicious!

This was my first attempt at making ice cream with my KitchenAid mixer. I chose this recipe because I am on an unparalleled peanut butter kick right now and can't seem to get enough.

Having no prior experience, I mixed the ingredients right in the frozen bowl.  I let it stir for about 30 minutes, checking on it every five, but when it stopped thickening up I stopped the mixer and put it straight in a Glad-ware container and into the freezer.  No plastic wrap, but that's because I forgot that part.

It turned out very good.  The consistency is off - quite hard when fully frozen, and once it thaws a bit it's a bit slushy again.  But all in all, the flavor is fantastic and well-balanced.

Definitely going to do this one again!

Amazong! Love it!! I don't like chocolate so I ommited the candy, but i used crunchy peanut butter and added extra...absolutely a dream! I mixed the ingredients in my kitchenaid then added to the icream maker. Iwaited until it was a bit better that soft serve and dumped it into a container for the freezer.
