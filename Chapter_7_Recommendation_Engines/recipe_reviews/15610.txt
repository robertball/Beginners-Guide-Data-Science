I enjoyed this recipe on steak tips with a few changes to it.  I used the juice of 2 limes instead of the apple juice and I substituted whole grain Dijon mustard instead of the brown mustard.  Also, I added about 1 tbsp of minced garlic.  I turned the meat 4 times while grilling and brushed on the mixture each time.

I don't really like steak, neither does my son, but we both love this recipe.

Didn't really like the flavour of this as it was too sweet, but overall it was OK.

i thought it was very good, the trick is to not be two overpowering with it. the sauce is better as an accent to the flavor of the meat, if you think it will be to sweet try puting some fresh garlic and pepper in the sauce to melow it out. i use a jack daneils mustard i thought it was really good

LOVED it!  Although I did add a little bit more honey for my taste and threw in some horseradish to give it a little bite but other than that it was EXCELLENT!

This was good.  Not one of the best.  Not sure if I will make it again or not.

The flavor wasn't really what I was looking for. Will try again with a different brand of mustard.
