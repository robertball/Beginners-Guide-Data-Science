The tomato sauce that this recipe makes is truly amazing. I had it with chips and spent the entire time going "Ooh. Mmm." But oddly (for the sauce is made with the juices of the lamb) the two flavours didn't go together brilliantly. I think this is because they both have very robust flavours. Because of this, I would have only given it four stars. However, the lamb was also tender and well cooked. I had it on it's own but it would have been great with any sides. As an essential ingredient in the sauce is the meat juice I have not yet thought of a way that you could make the sauce without having to cook the lamb too but I am going to find out and put it up as a sauce recipe in it's own right. I would not hesitate to say that if I failed to find a substitute for the meat juice that I would make the lamb just for the sauce.

On a second note, having made it again, I have to emphasize to use good lamb shanks. I bought some poor quality ones from the supermarket and the recipe wasn't enough to make up for the indifferent meat. This is because the flavour of the meat with the other ingredients is what really makes the dish.

I thought this was OK, probably better than I thought it would be.  The sauce was creamy and tasty, wasn't great but quite nice.

Will not be making this recipe again.  The flavor of the sauce just didn't go well with the lamb at all..  The saving grace was that the lamb shank was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  I added a bit of italian seasoning to the lamb when it was cooking.  But did not like this recipe.
