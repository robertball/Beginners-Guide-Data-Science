This was soooo good! I made a few adjustments that made it delish. I added about 1/4 cup of seasame oil and 1/4 cup of oyster sauce to the liquid dressing. Also, I sauted the chicken and mushrooms and bell peppers first, then let it simmer in the dressing for about 10 min. Then I added the rice, and tossed it all togethor, and eat it more like a warm rice dish than a salad! It tasted great! Will definatly make again!

Absolutely delicious!!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  My family enjoyed it, but didn't love it as much as I did.  I ate it for the next couple of days for lunch!!  Thank you for this recipe!

This is so addicting and easy to make! I use a can of bamboo shoots rather than the water chestnuts but other than that I keep everything the same. So delicious!

I dunno, something just wasn't cohesive with this for me.  Maybe I chose the wrong kind of brown rice or something, but it was kind of mushy and was just weird.

Pretty good- go easy on the salt with "salt & pepper to taste".  The soy sauce adds more than you would expect.  Very very good side dish for an asian-inspired meal.  I marinated overnight and left out the celery and water chestnuts.  The taste is there immediately though- still good without marinating.

Yum, with modifications. I made it the night before (much better flavor) and then heated it the next day and made lettuce wraps with it as the filling (made a sauce for the wraps of rice wine vinegar, oyster sauce and a little sugar). To the sauce for the chicken mixture I added oyster sauce and some sugar. I must admit that I cheated and used pre-cooked chicken.

I think this is good BUT with some changes.  I used long grain and wild rice, added garlic, baby spinach and crushed red pepper.  I also replaced 1 tbsp of the EVOO with sesame oil.   IMO - the 1st day it is not that good at all but after sitting in the fridge overnight it was better.  Thanks for the post.

This was OK, but seemed to be missing something.  I definitely think the dish improved after refrigeration, but I don't want to make it again.  I tried adding cashews after eating a few bites and that helped a little.

This was ok the first day, but could hardly choke it down the next day.  I always follow the recipe exactly the first time I make something, so if I were to make this again (which I'm not planning on) I would follow the suggestions of what other reviewers have done to make this edible.
