This is very good, but I'd recommend waiting to eat it until the second day. The tastes blend so much overnight and it really ends up taisting amazing. I used regular quenoa instead of red and it was just great! We liked it on day one, and LOVED it on day two!!

As written, the recipe is good/ok - with some changes it can be a five star - add 1/4 c. toasted pine nuts (toast by cooking at 350 for about 8 minutes) and add a oil/vinegar mix before cooling/chilling - I use 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar and 6 tablespoons olive oil - mix and add - it's wonderful - very much like a cous-cous salad found here - but with healthier quinoa - I used regular quinoa, as the red is difficult to find.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this to take to a picnic.  It was delicious and pretty quick to make.  I mixed red and regular quinoa and yellow and flame raisins.  I agree that it is better after allowing the flavors to mingle a while.

Definitely don't cook the Quinoa with the sautéed onion, add it later.

I made a few tweaks to this recipe and I think it turned out really well. First, I am a vegetarian, so I cooked the quinoa in veggie stock. I also added a spoonful of Better Than Bouillon No Chicken Base. I also cooked the quinoa separately from the rest. When I make this again I will also not use as much quinoa. I ended up having some leftover that I will have to use for something else. I would try to start with 1 1/2 cups to start. 

I sauteed fresh garlic, shallots and fresh minced ginger. I also drained the chick peas and added them to the pan with the garlic, shallots and ginger to cook them a bit. I added the cinnamon and cumin, cooked everything for a few minutes then added the cooked quinoa. 

I didn't have any mint, but I used fresh sweet basil and parsley. I also had about a cup of yellow raisins (which I plumped with hot water as the directions said). I mixed everything in to the pan with the quinoa, shallots, and spices and let it simmer for a few minutes. Shredded raw carrots were added. I also added a tablespoon or so of extra veggie broth while everything was in the pan to give it a little more flavor.

Definitely don't skip the lemon juice, either. I think it ties the whole thing together nicely. I only had a spoonful while it was still warm, but already it tastes awesome. I'm sure once it chills and the flavors meld a bit more it will be a new favorite. Thanks for the recipe!

I find that 1 cup of quinoa is enough. I always rinse the quinoa thoroughly and then roast in a pan without oil or anything first. In a pot, cook as prescribed. I did the recipe as written and added diced red pepper and a few table spoons of oil. YUMMY!!!

I usually like quinoa/Moroccan recipes but I probably won’t repeat this one. It was okay for a healthy lunch but I didn’t like the almost-raw carrots and the cinnamon was too strong for my liking.

Delicious.  Made it for my lunches last week and it was great. I would serve this to company.
