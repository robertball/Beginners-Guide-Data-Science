I made this recipe without the salt but, added a light breading made of: 1 cup garlic and herd bread crumbs, 1/2 stick butter and about a 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese, followed the same grilling instructions and was absolutely AMAZING!!!!  Thank you for the recipe.  It is now my favorite Talapia recipe ??

This isn't a recipe for grilled tilapia. It's a recipe for tilapia on the stove. By definition, this is a terrible recipe for grilled tilapia.

This was delicious! I don't measure these types of things but did about 1 TBSP oil and no salt, just for health reasons. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this for lunch. I wasn't disappointed. I did add 1/2 tea. of onion powder as well as 1 tbs of brown sugar I increased the olive oil by 1 tbs as well. It was enough glaze to over 6 servings with no problem.  It gave it a hint of BBQ flavor . Will be making again! Thanks for sharing!!!

Very good! I brushed the seasoning onto the fillets and then put the fillets in aluminum foil and then put them on the grill.  That way they don't get stuck to the grill. I Grilled squash and had fresh fruit and it made a perfect meal.  My kids loved it (the ones who like fish lol).  Thx for the recipe!

WOW! The hubs really wanted fish and I didn't want to heat up the house, so I found this recipe. Tilapia is one of our favorites. My 12-yr old son whipped up the seasoning, and the 11-yr old son put in on the fish. I heated up our Traeger grill, and use used our grill mats to cook it up.  AMAZING!  It is light and tender and juicy...the fish flakes perfectly. We are having it again next week with grilled veggies. This is a great healthy option when you want a quick meal.  Thank you for the recipe!

I cut the recipe down to one fillet. I put all the seasonings in a zip lock baggie with the fish and let it marinate for thirty minutes or so while I prepared the rest of dinner. Grilled it on a cast iron griddle and it turned out wonderful and pretty. I served it over a bed of braised veggies and it made a wonderful, healthy, light meal! Thank you !!

Nice...and easy!   Great for Tilapia.   Added a little cayenne pepper to give it that 'extra spice'.

Bland, bland, bland.  Could really use a few more spices to add some zing.  I ended up sprinkling my serving with more salt, cayenne, basil, and thyme just to give it some taste.

I made this as a single portion on the grill. Omitted the salt but added just a little crushed red peppers instead. Threw on grill with some yellow squash and red potatoes. Wow! What a lunch. Definitely a great recipe and keeper.

This was delicious...we first had it alone with a vegetable side. With the leftovers , we made the tilapia into fish tacos and also had enough to use it in a seafood salad. We will definitely make this recipe again...so easy and it was so delicious !!

Recipe was spot on.  It is simple to follow and the meal was fast to make.  I made mine a bit spicier because that's the way I like it.  And it turned out great!

Flavor was good, I would only suggest making sure the fish does not get over cooked.  For those who actually cook on the grill that can be a little more of a challenge.

This was very good, and very easy. I used regular paprika since I didn't have smoked and didn't change anything else.  I did cook it on the outdoor gas grill on top of a non stick griddle-type pan. I was happy with the result. Will definitely make again.
