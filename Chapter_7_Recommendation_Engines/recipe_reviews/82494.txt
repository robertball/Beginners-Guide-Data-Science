I made this salad for a party last weekend (doubled the recipe), and in the end it was all gone! Very interesting because of the grapes and almonds (I used sliced almonds). I used orange bell pepper instead of carrots. Very tasty, pretty and colorful!

Quick and delicious! This salad is bursting with flavours and doesn't need any dressing: a dash of lemon juice is enough to bring it to life. The only (minor) changes I made were toasting the almonds first and omitting broccoli (I don't care for raw broccoli).

I liked this one!  I had to get Greek Dressing just for it, but it was sooo good with it.  The flavours really combine well, and this was my first time really having radishes.  So enjoyable!  It made an awful lot for four people, so we still have leftovers!

Even though this was supposed to be a side- everyone ate more of the salad than the entree!

Stunning with the Greek Dressing I found on all recipes.  Swopped out lettuce for baby spinach and left out the radishes.  As a vegetarian I am always looking for new salads and this my new favorite.

This dish deserves more visibility! I was searching for a way to use radishes, lettuce, & carrots from this week's crop share box and found this under-appreciated gem. Agree that toasting the nuts is a must! Used one head of (red leaf) lettuce, skipped the broccoli. Almost left out tomatoes because didn't have any Roma, but went with about 4 Tbsp. diced from a can - and glad I did. Very satisfying, full of complimentary flavors, great crunchy textures!

This is a great salad, but 1 head of iceberg lettuce and 1 head of leaf lettuce is way too much. Just one head of lettuce is enough.

I made this for my family and we all thought it was O.K. I only used iceberglettuce and no leaf lettuce or italian dresing. My mom added Cavenders Greek seasoning and some lunch meat and said it improve the taste.

I liked the salad but it could definitely use less dressing.  Maybe start out with half and add more if needed. Also used spinach instead of iceberg.

Really good salad-full of antioxidants.  I skipped the radishes and used balsamic vinaigrette dressing which was perfect with the fruit/veggie combo.

I used less of the optional vinaigrette. Very fresh and tasty salad. My husband complained there were too much almonds, so next time I'll use less almonds to better suit his taste.

Just made a single serve portion of this salad for lunch because I had most of the ingredients on hand. I used a homemade Greek/Italian vinaigrette and I wished that my dressing had been a bit sweeter - like a good balsamic or even fruity vinaigrette would probably be really good with this. I didn't have broccoli, radishes, or tomatoes in mine but subbed in cucumbers because that's what I had. Be sure to TOAST your nuts - makes a huge difference. Also, do yourself a favor and forego the iceberg lettuce; it's not nearly as nutritious as other darker, leafier varieties! I used red leaf lettuce and spinach. It was still a pretty tasty salad, but a sweeter dressing (and maybe even a few dried cranberries) would really put it over the top!
