Fanstatic! I am always leary about pasta salads...not sure why, just am. Myself & my girls totally loved this recipe. I can't really say I did things differently, I did stick to the recipe, but as I only had Tomato & Basil Feta and a 4.25oz can chopped olives, I used them & removed the seeds from the tomatoes before chopping. Follow the recipe to a T. At 1st I thought the white vinegar was going to over power the ingredients but I was totally wrong. This recipe worked, there was a pleasant and nice zing of flavor & my use of the seasoned Feta I had...did enhance the recipe thoroughly. I seriously doubt, I will use plain feta in the recipe at all. I totally will make again and Will look for the Tri-colored cheese tortellini for the next round. Can't say anything bad about the recipe....and surprisingly..the walnuts work too! Go figure. TY TY!

I really enjoyed this salad.  I used almonds instead of walnuts.  I like the crunch it gave the salad.  I only used 4 ounces of feta cheese.  Next time I think I use less oil and vinegar.

Loved all the ingredients but it was way too much vinegar for us; if I try it again I definitely would reduce vinegar amount

Sooo yummy.  We used 1/4 cup Red Wine Vinegar and 1/2 cup White Vinegar.  We also substituted almonds for walnuts simply because we didn't have walnuts.  Will most definitely use this recipe again.

We really enjoyed this tortellini salad.  I was a little nervous about the vinegar after reading some of the reviews, but for my DH and I, it was perfect.  It definitely is better the second day when the flavors have had time to marry.  We don't care for olives, so I subbed diced cucumber and it worked for us.  I would make this exactly the same way, next time.

I made this without the green onions and just added chopped fresh basil.  I also used only about 1/4 C vinegar.  Instead of 2 packages (9 oz / 250 g. each) of tortellini, I would use 3 packages with the same amount of other ingredients next time. The walnuts really made it good.  I would like to try adding green onions next time.

This was very nice. I made it exactly as written, except that I used a whole 20-oz. package of Buitoni "Three Cheese" tortellini (i.e., a little more than called for), and skipped the salt.
It lasted me for 4 or 5 meals, I think, and I have to say that the final leftovers weren't all that great (a little soggy) - not surprisingly. But before then, it was a very tasty and filling salad.

The raw garlic is overwhelming, and we love garlic.  I used tortelloni, the BIG stuffed pasta, which made the salad pretty heavy.  Subbed kalamata olives for the black because that's  what I had.  Decreased the vinegar by more than half and it was still pretty zingy.  Good basic concept for a pasta salad.

For my personal taste the vinegar was over powering...that being said I had to make a triple batch for get together and it was all gone. I even got asked for the recipe by a few people. I did forget the garlic but other than that made as written. Loved all the ingredients just going to fiddle with the dressing.
