This marinade (for two full+ days) certainly reduced the gamey taste venison can have.   The steaks were as tender as venison tends to get, but the beer taste was quite evident, which we're not fans of (oh the irony, as we love beer, but don't tend to care for foods cooked in/with beer).  THANKS for the recipe!

This recipe was great. The only thing I would change is the cooking time. I found that 3-4 mins per side was sufficient. If I"d grilled longer than that, the meat would have been way over-done.

Followed thoroughly and the meat did end up very tender and edible. I don't eat wild game too much and with this marinade I didn't like the meat, but I made the elk steak marinade on this site I loved the meat. My friends who only eat wild game was split in half on likes and dislikes of this flavor.

Great Marinade for Elk Steak.  I did add 1 tsp. Minced garlic, 4 chopped green onions  and substituted 1/2 cup Cabernet wine for the beer. 24 hrs is a must  to get the maximum moisture and flavor . My first  experience was 4 hours and the longer the marinade time was even better!!
