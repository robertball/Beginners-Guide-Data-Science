I had extra butterscotch chips and used the ingredient search to stumble upon this recipe. I really liked these cookies. They had a nice crispy texture with a little give to them. They were sweet but not too sweet with just a hint of the butterscotch flavor. Everyone at worked like them too and asked for the recipe.

Very crispy and buttery the dough was a crumbly buttery mix but the cookies baked perfectly in 10 minutes. I added some white chocolate chips on 2nd batch which added some flavor. These would probably be good with some raisins and peanut butter. These cookies came right off of the sheet (no pam needed!!)

doctored the recipe a bit: I uses half brown sugar and half white sugar then added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. I'm soo amazed these cookies didn't crumble due to the lack of eggs! I love these cookies!

I was looking for a change from my old stand by oatmeal cookie recipe so decided to try this one. I learned that I do not like the addtition of butterscotch chips in an oatmeal cookie. I think that is definitely a personal preference but as it is such an important part of this recipe it factors in my review. I also thought these were a little heavy on the butter as they were rather oily and flat.

I liked these cookies but the recipe didn't quiet work how I thought a cookie recipe should. Next time I will let the batter completely cool before backing. (I got giant flat cookies with the warm batter). Reduce the amount of butter to about 1/2 cup (they were very oily) and play around with adding on egg and some more flour. Despite their flat greasy texture they were very tasty. I did however add 1 tsp. Vanilla cinnamon and allspice.

I've made these many times and they are AMAZING!!  This last time I used 1/2 cup butter instead of 3/4 cup, and they didn't spread so much which is what I was hoping.  I like them wafer thin as well (regular recipe), but with less butter you get a normal looking cookie with just as much crunch and butteriness, and more ease removing from baking sheets.  LOVE THEM!!!

To see the dough for these cookies you would never believe that they would bake up to hold together at all...but they DO! Pretty tasty light cookie too.

Tasty but very dry and crumbly. Do not try to move them until they've cooled. I will not make these again.

It was a little challenging to get the batter to form into cookies on the cookie sheet but they turned fine. Very tasty and quick to make!

I used a small jar of butterscotch sauce instead of chips thinking it would work out the same. IT DIDN'T!!! I cant get the cookies off of the pan! Next time I will use the chips.. On the other hand the dough was very tasty so I give this recipe a good rating.

Good. DH says these are his favorite cookies that I've made. I put in a little extra salt because I like the salty/sweet combination. I would probably give them three starts myself and he would have given them five so I rated them a four.

We like these alot. Don't put them too close together on cookie sheet though. If you do they spread into one another. Thanks for this recipe.

These tasted fine - I'm sure the 3/4C butter was the main reason. I made these for my grandkids but they were far too greasy for little fingers. I'll stick to the old-fashioned oatmeal cookie recipes.

These were delicious; even my boyfriend who doesn't like butterscotch liked them! Mine weren't "very" crisp but they weren't soft either.

Surprisingly good. soft light and tasty. I was going to add some spices as the recipe seemed to bland but decided to try it as is first. Glad I did these were so good.

I too ended up with large flat cookies. I ended up completely rewriting the recipe so as to not waste the batter I'd made. I can't figure what the difference was between mine and those that succeeded with the original recipe. The flavor of these cookies is great but it needs work.

DELICIOUS! The dough was very crumbley so I packed it into balls before I placed them on a cookie sheet. Great with raisins too!

Easy to make and delicious. I used salted butter and skipped the pinch of salt. Big seller at bake sale.

I was skeptical of this recipe when I saw it called for no egg, and baking soda in hot water. I was pleasantly surprised how perfect a cookie this is. Taste is wonderful and butterscotchy.
