I made this it was so good I did not add mustard but I did brown sliced onion  to put on top of bun before adding sloppy joes for those who do not like onions.

This is my second time making this- first time it was too spicy but used regular chili sauce and it turned out so delicious! Even my picky nephew had seconds so this must have been good!

This recipe is great. However, I wouldn't recomend using Siracha as your Chili sauce. Yes, the sandwiches still were yummy, but I had to add a few tablespoons of tomato paste and a couple more spons of brwn sugar.

If you like super spicy though, I made the whole 6 servings and used 1/2 a cup of Siracha

We have made this several times. We have added chopped onion which we cook with the ground beef. Since we double or sometimes triple the recipe we use either a medium or large onion.  Also we have changed the amount of mustard and brown sugar according to taste. Serve cheesy potatoes with the Sloppy Joes.

Loved how easy these were to make.  I sauteed some chopped onion before browning the ground beef.

I really like this recipe , it really simple to make and pretty fast to make too. I, also like that I didn't have to chop anything up or anything like ...all I had to really do was measure and pour. I doubled the recipe so that it would last a little while longer. I also wouldn't think of putting chili sauce in a Sloppy Joe, but it made really tasty.......would make again  :)

Had no 'Chili Sauce' on hand so subbed in Sriracha Ketchup and wow this was good, sweet and just the right level of spicy kick for everyone.

So much better than the canned stuff. I do think it comes out a bit sweet so next time I think I'll use less brown sugar.

I love this recipe.I did have to change  some things to lower the sugar(diabetic). I used half chili sauce and half Heinz reduced sugar ketchup,1 tsp. Splenda brown sugar  blend and1 tsp regular Splenda.I also added 1/4 cup water as it was thicker than I wanted .I did use 2 tablespoons red and green peppers and 1/4 cup onion.I will make this again.Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for our family reunion and received loads of raves.  I did, however, omit the mustard and vinegar, but added diced roasted red peppers. Yummy!!!!!!

This was pretty good. I thought the vinegar was a bit much and will probably leave it out next time. Hubby liked it!

It was pretty good. I'd have to make some changes to the recipe before it would be a favorite. It's very quick & easy to make.
