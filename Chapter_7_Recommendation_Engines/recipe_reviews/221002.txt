I happy to be the inaugural reviewer (and photo submitter) of this recipe and be able to give it such a glowing review!  I've never really gotten the phrase "comfort food" before.  I mean, I understand what it means/what it is, but nothing has ever really screamed COMFORT FOOD in my world.  Until today.  It's unseasonably cold and dreary and I could not wait to get home and taste this.  It did not disappoint...."comfort food" popped into my head a first bite.  I followed the recipe, though I did slightly increase everything to use potatoes and ham I had on hand.  This will become a slow cooker staple in the LTH house.  THANKS for the recipe, Jane!

Made this for dinner.  It was very hearty - comfort food is a great description for it.  It could almost be served as a breakfast item.  Yum!

I didnt have the cream of tartar and I didnt need so much milk but overall this is an ok recipe. At the end I tasted it and added a big spoonful of reduced fat sour cream and some garlic salt and pepper.

I added garlic salt since that's a favorite in my house. The potatoes cooked up just right.

Will definitely make this again. A great meal with minimal time. I found the 9 hrs way too long - it was cooked to our satisfaction in 4 hours on low, using the fully-cooked smoked ham. Also threw in a layer of sliced mushrooms, a few cloves, and a dash of Frank's HotSauce - I put that s**t on everything. Gave it just the added kick.

It was an easy fix with left over ham. I did just a couple things different. I melted 2 Tb butter and stirred in the flour, then the milk (I used almond), and stirred over medium heat until thickened. I also added Ranch dressing mix as someone else suggested. I used only 4 potatoes. I put it on high in the crockpot, but it was done in about three hours. It did not separate as a couple reviewers had problems with.

I hate giving bad recipe reviews, because I feel like taste is such a personal thing. However, this recipe did not work for us at all. The sauce completely broke. We ended up with a soupy mix, and it wasn't soupy in a good way. It didn't taste right either. I found it barely edible, and I'll eat anything! For the amount of work that it took to make the milk sauce, I really wanted it to work. I may have an issue with my crock pot getting too hot... since it worked for others (that still doesn't fix the taste issue)

If you didn't like this you did it wrong. This was fabulous! maybe it was the ham quality. I didn't have cream of tartar, so I skipped the water and tartar all together (water gets drained anyway). Great way to use up Easter ham. I don't measure anything, but I used red potatoes, a whole yellow onion and tons of chopped ham and whatever amount of cheddar I had on hand. The milk flour roux was perfect as well. I had creamy, flavorful ham and scalloped potatoes. This was my first time ever making them and it was to die for!

Great simple recipe.  Use 1/2 cup Seriously Sharp Cheddar and 1/2 cup medium cheddar.  Great flavor and not too cheesy!  5 hours on low worked well.

This recipe is a keeper. I did use chicken broth and what  a difference it made in the taste of the potatoes. I used red potatoes, sliced them in the food processor with the skins on. I used an 8 ounce package of mixed shredded cheddar cheese as I happened to have that on hand. Also used 2% milk.  My husband loved it!!!!
Am telling our granddaughter where to find this recipe from you.  Will make this again.

Tried this recipe and it was really good. I would change a few things next time - add more cheese, at least 2 cups and add a bit more ham.
The 9 hours was also a bit too long.  I would try 8 hours on high.

I made it twice, the first time following the exact recipe and it turned out fine, but the second time, I made a cheese sauce using 2TBSP, butter melted in a saucepan and then adding the 1/4C flour making a rue.  I then added the milk a little at a time until it all was incorporated.  Once it was cooked and thickened, I added the cheese (I also used the cheddar and added a little parm./romano).  I poured half the sauce over the potatoes, then added ham and poured the remainder of the sauce over all.  I cooked it on high for 2 hours then turned to low for another 3-4 hours.  Came out great and no mess in the oven!!

This was easy to make and my kids didn't complain (huge win). I followed the recipe exactly and gave it the 9 hours it called for. We were not home before then, so I didn't realize that it was very over cooked. Orators were soggy and meat was dry. I have 4 stars because the recipe is good. Next time, I will just reduce the time and maybe the amount of potatoes.

This was good. Followed recipe exactly as this was the first time I made it. Like others stated, it definitely doesn't need to cook as long as recipe says, especially when potatoes are sliced thin.  Mine was  done in 3 1/2 hours on high. I think the cream of tartar was to keep potatoes from turning pink while you prepare the rest. Salt water would do the trick too. Great way to use up leftover ham. Sauce separated but I just stirred before serving. I would make it again.

I'm just learning how to cook and I love the way it turned out, so did my sweetheart! I made a few tweaks. I added garlic salt and butter to the roux. I topped it with Tony Chacher's Creole Seasoning for a little kick. Also tons of different kinds of cheeses! You can never have enough cheese! Let's just say that there were no leftovers :-D

My family loved this!  I ended up baking this for 1 1/4 hours at 325F, as I ran out of time in the morning.  As indicated in other reviews, I made the following changes to the recipe:  I made a roux using 2T. butter and 1/3 c. flour, with one cup milk and one cup chicken broth for the sauce.  Stirred in 2 cups of cheddar (instead of 1) as well as some garlic powder and parsley to complete a light cheese sauce.  I omitted the ham altogether.  Stirred the sauce into the potatoes, then baked in a 9x13 glass baking pan.  I think the addition of a crunchy topping will be in order next time around.  Delicious!

Our family loved this recipe. I used smoked sausage instead of ham, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It took about 3 1/2 hours on high in my crock pot. Perfect busy-day supper.

This actually tasted good, but the visual appeal was extremely lacking because the sauce separated.

I didn't have time to do this in morning due to oversleeping so I followed the recipe when I got home and stuck it in the oven for about 1 hr and 15 min.  I also added some Ranch seasoning (powder) because I was not sure about Cream of Tarter.  LOVED IT.  Husband said I should make this often and both my 2 yr old at all of theirs.  My daughter told me "Yum, Good job mommy!)
