We have lots of people dieting at my office and I made this for someone's last day, thinking a good diet coleslaw would be great.  I'm sorry, it wasn't good, it wasn't great.  It looked like coleslaw but it didn't taste like coleslaw.  I would not recommend this!

added 1/2 green pepper, 1 stalk celery, used less carrots. Also used a bit of cayenne instead of paprika and did not have pineapple so I used a couple Tblsp of apple cider vinegar. Yummy and healthy!

Very easy and ridiculously healthy. I used non-fat Greek yogurt (a little more than the recipe called for) and more pineapple as well. Balancing seasonings is always a little tricky for me but once you get it right it's delicious. It could easily be made vegan by using soy yogurt.

The pantry/fridge was running low on supplies.  Needed a recipe to make with a small red cabbage and three carrots.  Searched for a carrot and cabbage salad and up came this recipe!  My son has a pineapple allergy so made a few substitutions.  Omitted the pineapple - obviously - and used 1/2 cup of Greek vanilla with honey yogurt (to retain the sweet of the omitted pineapple) and 1/2 cup of Hellman's mayo with olive oil (so the recipe wouldn't be too sweet).  We were having a BBQ so used smoked paprika. YUM!
