We are trying to do the gluten-free thing. I made this with Bob's Red Mill gluten-free flour (blue label), 1/4 quinoa flakes, plain applesauce, and Smart Balance. I left out the coconut (not a fan). Great muffins! I am glad to find a GF muffin recipe that I like

Followed the recipe exactly but they were not good.; too much nutmeg and not sweet enough. Will not make again.

I will definitely make these often. My husband loves them. We both appreciate the low sugar and they are more than sweet enough with the applesauce and sweetened coconut.  I thought about using unsweetened but am glad I  followed the recipe as there is only 1/2 cup brown sugar. I had to cook them 30 mins in my oven...let them cool and they were super delicious..loved the crunchy outside texture and the moist inside...love the oats in this version of morning glory muffins too! Thank you for the posting!

Definitely not a sweet muffin and has a heavy carrot taste. I would add raisins / apple / pineapple - something else sweeter instead of so much carrot.

Very good.  Not too sweet.  Didn't add nuts, but will at some point.  Will make again.

Very good .  I wished it had more oats, so I may alter the recipe next time.  I tried the gluten free version and used mostly almond flour.

These Morning Glory muffins are wonderful!  I made the recipe last week, and plan to make them again, this week.  The only changes I made were to omit coconut - personal preference - and add a few more walnuts.  The muffins kept well in a plastic container for 3 days, as the recipe specified.

I didn't have any applesauce so I subbed 2 bananas (mashed) and 2tbps vegetable oil. 
It was good but needed a bit more flavour. Next time I want to top the muffin with an oatmeal/cinnamon/sugar topping for flavour/crunch.

We made the muffins with a small twist. We were out of apple sauce (and coconut) so we substituted one peeled and grated apple, plus 1/2 cup of sour cream. Quite a wonderful morning muffin.

I read previous reviews about the sweetness of the muffins.  So during the preparation I tasted how much sugar it needed more, so I added around 1/2 cup more of white sugar.  Additionally, I didn't have applesauce, so I substituted it with 1 cup of cottage cheese and ended up very good!

These were heavy and chewy. Not to my liking. Also could have used more sweetness, either from fruit or sugar. Won't make again.

I would recommend spraying the muffin papers with cooking spray, batter sticks to papers. Very good though and will definitely make again!
