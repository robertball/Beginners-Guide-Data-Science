I used Granny Smith apples and skipped the coconut only because I didn't have any. I topped each apple with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and a drizzle of the juices from the baking pan. This was so freaking good. One of the best things I have eaten in a while.

I loved the apples. I ate the apples just as written, no ice cream or whipped topping here. The cinnamon and brown sugar combination was delicious. I will definitely make these apples again. I did have to cook the apples another 5 minutes.

This was really, really good. I didn't have any coconut though, so I just cut up some of the inside of the apple and mixed it in with the spices and butter before putting it back into the apple to back. I also cut the bottom of the apple to make it stand flat and cut the top of the apple off- then used toothpicks to fasten the "lid" back onto the apple.

Very good, though I'm going to have to try it with coconut.

First time baking apples and they turned out fanatic! I cut the bottom so they would sit flat.  Followed the recipe to a "t". So much juicy goodness to drizzle over them. Great for any time of year. This will definitely be a regular dessert here!

This was sooooo good! Mine took an hour in the oven to soften, but I used Fuji apples and I'm at high altitude. I followed the directions exactly. Everyone loved them! Thank you for a great recipe for an old favorite!

Great recipe. I didn’t have any coconut and did add a small amount of honey. The only thing is i pulled the apple out of the oven at 30 min and it wasn’t enough time to cook. Apple was harder than it should have been. That’s what I get for not checking first. Lol.
