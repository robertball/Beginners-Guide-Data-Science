Super easy to make and delicious. I didn't have self-rising flour, so I used the recipe on Allrecipes for homemade self-rising flour (just flour with baking powder and salt) and it worked out well!

This is a great recipe for a quick and easy pizza dough. I almost always have greek yogurt and flour on hand, so this is great to have in my back pocket in a pinch. It comes out surprisingly chewy (in a good way!) for not having yeast. Definitely a keeper!

01-03-16 ~ Great pizza crust with two ingredients and one of them is not yeast.  I made 'Self-Rising Flour' from AR to use in the recipe.  I doubled the recipe so I could use my large pizza pan.  It was humid the day I made it, so I did have to add extra flour.  I put it in my KA and let the dough hook do all the work.  I ended up with too much dough, so I roll it out and made 6 bread sticks with the leftovers.  The crust came out nice and crisp and worked great!  I par-baked the crust at 450° for 5 minutes before adding 11 toppings.  The crust held up great and had wonderful flavor.  I most definitely will be using this crust again.

Made this again & its just as good as we remember.  I never buy self rising flour so I just add 1.5 tsp. of baking powder to 1 cup of flour & voila self rising flour hack.  Generously coat a baking sheet with organic olive oil & a dusting of flour before spreading out crust.  Par bake at 450 for 7 minutes.  Take out & top with ingredients & pop back into oven at 500 degrees for 10 minutes. I'm a high altitude baker at 5040 feet so not sure if that affects my baking time but recipe always comes out great. Thanks!

I made this and sectioned it into 4 personal pizzas for the kids to decorate themselves and they LOVED it!!!! I will say that after making it a few times I learned to put the pizza on parchment paper because it really is hard to get off the pan (even with cooking spray)

I was reluctant to try this because I didn't know what to expect. I've always made good old yeast dough but Wow, I was surprised how good this was, my husband LOVED it. Will definitely make again; most likely this weekend because it is sooo easy:) Thank you for sharing.

Was pleasantly surprised at how this turned out! Used this recipe for a taco pizza I  pre-baked for about 5min, at the suggestion of another review. used a pizza stone for one pizza and a cookie sheet with parchment for the other. Both came out crispy on bottom, sightly chewy on top. Husband (who is persnickety) said it was really good! my 4 year old thought it too crispy on bottom; my 9yr old, who I might mention has a dental appliance, was able to chew with no difficulty. Who knew all this time that homemade pizza dough was a couple cups of flour and some Greek yogurt away?...especially in a pinch! Keeping this "golden nugget" for future use. Thanks!

Was Great! I preheated the over to 450 and worked the dough till it was no longer sticking to the counter. If your making your own sauce be sure to make it thick, if it's runny it will make the crust soggy.

Wow it was delicious! I used full fat Greek yogurt. It reminded me of sourdough bread. So easy too! I'm glad I tried it. I wonder if it would turn out well with whole wheat flour.

An easy dough recipe that yields a very tasty crust. I used a 7oz greek yogurt with 1 1/2 cup flour. We did not have self rising flour so i added 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/4 tsp of salt. This made enough dough for two delicious calzones.  Once dough is rolled out don't forget to spread olive oil over crust for browning. Thanks for sharing!

The crust does taste yogurt-y, but I like that. It's very simple and easy to make. I doubled the recipe and I baked it at 500 F for 12 minutes, on parchment, on a big cookie tray, and it was great!

Not very good. Reminiscent of a grade school lunchroom pizza. Will be going back to a yeast dough.

Loved it! I followed the recipe exactly and rolled out pretty thin. I was able to make a large thin-crust pizza and 8 bread sticks. I really like the chewiness of the crust. This will be my go-to pizza crust from now on.

I use fresh-ground Kamut flour (instead of all-purpose white) to make it a bit healthier. We always have fresh home-made Greek yogurt in the fridge (though, I'm sad the probiotic benefits are lost when the dough is cooked). I have to add 3/4 tsp salt and 1.5 tsp baking powder.
I also roll the dough super thin (1/8 inch), so you don't really notice the absence of chewiness and spring in the dough. It makes a great wholesome base for any toppings (those healthy, as well as those not so healthy)!

I wish the author had put all the baking directions in the recipe instead of her comments. I didn't see the instructions to brush with olive oil and bake at 500 until mine was done, baked at 450 based on another reviewers suggestion. Not even until after I had written a review, that I don't know how to edit to add this. There still isn't a suggested amount of time to bake either.

This recipe is so easy it's ridiculous! Is it a real yeast based pizza dough like from the pizzarias? No its not. Does it taste good? Yes it does.

I used White Lily self rising flour and it came out great. I also added 1/2 tablespoon of Italian herbs to flavor the dough. The family was pretty impressed.

I accidentally used AP,  it was great, added salt to the finished product. It was very good, I rolled out the dough for a thin crust and the recipe made double. I'm making it again tonight but going to use the right flour, want to see the difference. I'm going to hold a pizza making party at my house for our dating and engaged couples.

This is such a unique, but easy way to make pizza. It didn't have the chew or bubbles you get from a yeasted dough, but still had a nice tangy flavor. This won't replace my favorite yeasted dough,  but for fun fast pizza it's great.

I made this pizza dough as per a recipe I found on another site the ingredients  vary slightly instead of using Baking Powder my recipe uses Baking Soda.  I didn't need the dough and I like other posters had to use a little more flour than suggested.  I did a blind bake of the crust for about 9 minutes at 375 degrees then I put on my toppings.  I did use parchment paper on my cookie sheet and spread the dough out pretty thin, when it was finished baking I flipped my dough over and then brushed olive oil on the top and made that the bottom then I brushed on my pizza sauce and then cheese and used primarily meat toppings and some onion and yellow pepper put back in the oven at 375 to bake for another ten minutes or so but found my cheese was melting so I put it under the broiler.  End result a thin crust not crispy but tender and golden brown bottom.  Next time I think I will knead the dough a bit then rest it and then  roll it overall I would say it was a tasty success.

This was very tasty, and super easy. I used Bob’s Red Mill cup for cup gluten free flour, added baking soda and salt to make it “self rising”, and full fat Greek yogurt. THe dough was very dense, and I was worried that it would taste like rock, but behold... it was delish! I pressed it out by hand into a non stick roasting pan drizzled with olive oil. I doubled the recipe, popped it in the oven at 500 for 7 minutes, then topped it with sauce, cooked chicken, turkey pepperoni,  pizza blend cheese, Italian herbs, and fresh parm. Baked for another 5-10 minutes till golden. Very very good. Will def make  again, my 15 yr old son loved it. Next time will be sure to really press it out thinly, the edges were perfect, but the inside was a bit chewy. Still enjoyed it! Will try with regular yogurt as well.

Very good recipe.  I baked mine in preheated oven at 500F for 10 minutes.  I added some Parmesan cheese to the dough and brushed olive oil to edges for crust. Came out very tasty!  Edges were crispy everywhere else softer.

This recipe is so awesome!  I used the self rising flour recipe like others first.  I also substituted greek yogurt for sour cream since that's what I had on hand.  It gave the dough a sour dough taste which was very good.

Delightfully simple and diet friendly, this crust when patiently rolled thin and pre + post baked on a well heated stone comes out crunchy under and soft on top. I used a corn meal sprinkled wood peel to deliver it on the pizza stone. Suggest cutting the pre-bake time to 4 or 5 minutes because it heats dough faster then a steel pan. Also MUST use Greek yogurt, normal plain will require almost 3x the flour to reach dry elastic feel.

I made this for my parents and I just cause I had the taste for pizza we are on a budget. Everyone got their own pizza so I just made the recipe three times. This is super simple and quite amazing dough for it being 2 ingredients. Thank you so much, I will be making it again this week lmao.

This is by far one of the easiest things to make (from scratch)! It took very little effort and time and it came out delicious. Next time, I do plan on adding a little bit of italian seasoning to the dough before hand, but all in all, this pizza dough recipe is going to be a regular in my kitchen.

Super easy to make, tastes delicious, and the kids had no idea it was “reasonably” healthy. I made it on a cast iron pizza pan and it was crispy and sooooo good!

One of my favorite recipes of all time. When used to preparing and making this pizza, one can be eating homemade pizza in ~1hr, with a clean kitchen! The macros are stellar on this dough relative to most other recipes. The texture is a bit more chewy than typical pizza dough, and its harder (for me ) to roll as thin as I'd normally like to, so I season the dough well with homemade pizza seasoning, and usually pick a flavor style for the outer crust such as Cajun.

This is my "go to" pizza dough. It is super easy and always turns out perfectly. It freezes well too, I'll often use a tub of greek yogurt and make  4-5 doughs at a time. Greek yogurt is quite an expensive ingredient (in NZ) but natural yogurt works just as well.

Easy and quick to make. Tastes good and if time is an issue,  this pizza crust will fit the bill. Personally, I like leavened dough as there is more elasticity to the finished product. I let my dough rest for 15 minutes before I formed the crust using my palm and fingers.  It took about  16 minutes to be golden brown on the bottom.

That person who said it needs to cook at 500 degrees is crazy !!!!  I do it and cook my pizza at 385 degrees and it gets done and browns beautifully, Takes longer to cook but hubby said it is the best pizza he has ever had. that way all the toppings you put on it get done. I am going to add some herbs to the dough next time and see if it is good. Will take pics as I am going to make it tomorrow when we watch the OU game !!!!! by the way I use 0% Fat Fage yogurt. Yummy !!!

This was surprisingly good! It took more flour for me but that might have had something to do with the humidity here. Instead of kneading the dough by hand I stuck it in the food processor with the dough blade for a couple of minutes then  kneaded it very briefly by hand. It helps to oil the top of the dough before attempting to spread it out because the dough is  pretty sticky. Next time I'll oil the bottom as well to help with browning. Following the suggestion of a few reviews I par-baked for 5 minutes before topping. It's a chewy dough that you would never guess only had two ingredients!

Simple pizza crust that we also tried as gluten free, and it worked just as well.  No, it's not what you expect at a pizza shop, but no homemade pizza is.  The crust does not rise much.  Everyone liked it and we'll be using it again.

I created a profile just to rate this recipe it was so good! I've made yeast dough, refrigerator dough, frozen dough, any and all imaginable kinds... this is the best one I've made! It was so good!!! I'm such a fan of easy and delicious and this recipe meets both requirements. I threw it into my kitchenaid with the dough hook while i prepped another dinner and it basically made its self.

The absolute best pizzas we've ever made! The most incredible aroma rises from the combination when mixing. Topped with Alfredo sauce, pepperoni, onions, mushroom, mozz & provolone! Baked a little longer in my oven, about 25 mins. Thank you so much for such a perfect, easy to make pizza dough!

I make this dough with gluten free flour and it works so well!  It is better if your yogurt is NOT fat free.  The pizza crust is SOFT, which my gluten free daughter really enjoys since most gluten free crusts are crispy.  Once I made a pepperoni roll out of it and it worked incredibly well too!  I typically roll the dough on parchment paper and then transfer it onto a hot pizza stone in the oven.  The outside is brown and crisp and the inside is soft and yummy :-)

Made it per the recipe and it turned out well.  My picky eater mentioned how good the crust was.  My husband prefers a crispier crust, but said the flavor was good.  Overall, a very easy and good recipe.

Made this pizza dough tonight for a quick supper. It was super easy & pretty tasty. The only thing I will do next time is roll the dough out a little thinner. It made a crust a little thicker than I like. Recipe is a keeper. Thanks!!

I thought that this pizza was delicious! We didn't have self rising flour so we made our own flour. All we had to add to the flour was baking powder and salt. With the right amount of sauce and cheese, it was the best pizza I've had in a long time.??

Crust was fun to make with a bunch of 9 year olds, but I did not see how long to cook it for.

This is so easy to make and turned out great.  I made one with just white fpour and another with half whole wheat and half white flour.  Definitely let the dough rest for about 30 minutes before spreading it in the pan.  Have already shared this recipe with friends and family!

I love love love this recipe! It’s quick, easy and extremely calorie friendly for those days I underestimate snacking and so much cheaper than premade or takeout or delivery. I used the serving tool to break it to one serving which is plenty for me! I bake the dough at 350 for 5 min, add toppings (jar pasta sauce and fresh mozzarella) and then bake for 10 more. Makes a perfect soft chewy crust just the way I like!

Actually made this crust in my Kitchenaid with the dough hook. I let it knead for about 2 minutes in the mixer and then kneaded a minute or two by hand on a floured surface. Turned out very good - even our littles helped with this easy recipe!

Was in a really bad mood so walked the 3 miles round trip to pick up the yogurt and toppings. Everything was bogo or on sale. Mood began to improve. Pulled out a bowl. Mixed the ingredients, perhaps kneaded a bit too strong handed. Topped the pizza, baked for 20 minutes at 500 degrees. Cooled. Ate it. Mood definitely improved!  The satisfaction of a nice dinner that I made for about $8 helped so much.

Nice recipe to have in arsenal I liked the chewy dough. I used butter instead of the spray. I'm going to pre bake the dough as suggested and cook at 450 next time.

Yes, I will make it again.  Have to use that flour that I never keep on hand!  The reason for the 4 stars is that I avoid kneading whenever possible.  And I don't have that fancy stand mixer that would do the job for me.  But yes, the taste and texture were good.  Isn't easy finding a good pizza crust recipe.

This was a super fast dough that I whipped up when a kid asked for pizza. It was faster (and way cheaper) than ordering pizza, and so much tastier. It actually tasted much healthier, too. I added a couple shakes of Italian seasoning, and maybe a teaspoon or so of onion powder and 1/2t garlic powder. 450 degrees to par bake for 6 minutes (just went by how it looked) and then 500 degrees until the bottom was crispy (used an actual pizza pan with holes).

Takes a minute to fully blend but overall super easy and delicious! I added some italian seasoning and roasted garlic and herb spices to mine because I wanted a flavored crust. I love how this recipe has so few ingredients and can be super versatile!

I use this recipe and make individual pizzas, so everyone can make their own. I also precook one side and put the toppings on the precooked side before I finish baking it. Do not use a pizza stone!! Use a stainless steel cookie sheet or pizza steel and oil it well or it will stick.

I had heard about the 2 ingredient crust before but never had tried it as I often have frozen pizza dough balls from a local grocer ($2) in the freezer.  I had, however,  decided at the last minute to make pizza for supper so hadn't taken it out to thaw.  I decided to make this one but as luck would have it I didn't have greek yogurt on hand .. enter sub of sour cream 1:1.  I mixed the sour cream with the self rising flour and kneaded it until it was no longer sticky then divided into two pizza size pieces.  As suggested by others, I par-baked the crust at 450 F for 5 minutes .. it did bubble in the middle so next time I will poke it with a fork.  After 5 minutes I took it out and added toppings then baked at 450 for another 18 minutes.  The crust was crispy and had I not rolled it quite as much, would have been chewy and both hubs and I really liked it.  I will likely always have a dough ball in my freezer  but will definitely make this again, either with yogurt or sour cream.

There is no time allocated for the pizza. Temp, yes, time no. 
It takes approx 15 - 20 mins at 250deg C. Don’t be fooled, the dough is very thick and will rise therefore extending the cooking time. 
Overall though it seems good!

This is a simple recipe for an awesome crust. Brushing olive oil on edge before cooking contributes to a nice, brown crispy crust.

These two ingredients make a fluffy yet crispy pizza crust. It’s hands down our favorite for making pizza. No more ordering pizza for this house!!When I make this crust, I knead for a few minutes, make a ball then let the dough rise for about 10 minutes before rolling out. We also use a cookie sheet to make ours, and this is still enough dough. You can double the recipe for a thick crust.

Hello,
Initially, I wanted to give it a four. I was looking for more moist crust, but in essence it turned out to be crispy which was fine. The calories were not too much. I lessened the recipe by using 1/2 cup less flour and less 3 oz. of Greek yogurt. 
Knowing this is flour and yogurt only it came out well. Next time I'll add a sprinkles of salt. My topping was fresh basil, mozzarella cheese, cherry tomatoes, capers, and salsa, absence of tomato sauce. About the time I put ingredients on the Pizza, I didn't have a place for the sausage slices.

Um, a 7 oz. container of Greek yogurt is not nearly a liquid 8 oz.  It is only half a cup.  I realized my silly error when I wondered why it was so dry.  The recipe, correctly measured, made a wonderful crust with a texture that wasn't exactly like pizza dough, but made a tangy, fluffy crust.  I pressed the dough into a cast iron skillet, which had been generously lubed with a rich, dark olive oil, and made a Chicago style pizza out of it.  I baked it at 425 for about 30 minutes, and the crust did not suffer for being cheated out of 75 degrees more...this recipe specifying that it must be cooked at 500.  It was crispy, crunchy, and golden brown on the outside.  My family approved heartily, so I'm never going back to the old way again.  Incidentally, I never buy self rising flour, but only did so for this recipe.  I'm going to measure out recipe quantities the rest of the flour into sandwich bags and store them in the freezer for future quick dinners.  That should keep the flour from losing its self rising property.

This is super easy and delicious! Thick and chewy! I doubled the recipe. I rolled out on a greased pizza pan to about 1/2 in thick.  I skipped the olive oil and put garlic butter on the crust then cooked at 500 degrees until lightly brown. Then I added my toppings and cooked at 500 degrees until melted.  Delicious! Husband and kid also loved it!

I followed the the directions and the footnotes provided. The only review of others addition I add was brushing olive oil on the crust and baking the crust first for 10 minutes at 500 degrees then added toppings. The hubs and I love crispy thin crust Ida and I rolled it very thin. It was absolutely yummy. I let my KitchenAid do the kneading which only took about 3-4 minutes!!! I used 2% Greek yogurt too.

I double  the recipe and use foil on my pizza stone. Dusting the pizza stone/foil/pizza pan with a generous amount of flour is a must! We’ve made this several times and it’s always delicious and a perfectly chewy crust!

Loved this recipe! Added 1 tsp of garlic olive oil and made it in my Ninja on the dough setting. Baked it on a preheated stone for 10 minutes then added toppings.  Turned out perfect and crispy. Will never buy store bought crust again!

Happiness!  I'm not supposed to eat yeasted foods and have searched for a way to make pizza dough that does' taste like a biscuit.  I found this recipe.  It is sooooo yummy!  It tastes a little bit like sourdough, is  chewy, and delicious!  I pre-baked it for 5 minutes as suggested by others.  Best pizza I have had in years!!

Pretty good for being so simple. I couldn't taste the yogurt, which was a good thing. Don't expect a premium pizza with this pizza dough recipe.

OMG I wouldn't have even thought about using Greek yogurt for pizza dough, but it is very tasty. I've even made this into bread sticks with lasagna and it was very tasty. Soooo worth a try!
