Taco Salad w/ Spinach Haiku: "Desperate for more spice. Colorful and healthy, sure. Just needed some jazz." W/ only salt and chili powder going into the ground beef, one taste and I had to add a heaping scoop of AR's "Taco Seasoning I", and when I plated everything, I was tempted to add cheese and salsa, but wanted to follow the recipe as written. A lovely, light dish, but the spinach was disappointing, just laying all limp below everything else, calling out for dressing or something. I would gladly make this again, but would have to doll up the meat considerably, and use Catalina dressing or salsa on top.

This was so super easy and yummy!!!  My kids loved it!!!  I added  cumin though because it definitely was alittle  bland.  Also topped it off with some salsa and just a touch of sour cream.  All and all a nice light meal coming in at 300 calories which is perfect for dinner!!  I'll definitely make this again.

Used up some leftover shredded buffalo chicken. Added some sliced onions and corn too. Delicious and healthy way to clean out the fridge!
