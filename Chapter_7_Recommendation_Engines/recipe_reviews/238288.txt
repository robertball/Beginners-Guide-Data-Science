I made this using sour cream instead of cream cheese and probably more strawberries. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe. If I made it again, I would do cakes from scratch and real whip cream because the mixes and the cool whip gave this a pretty chemically flavor IMO. However, not bad for a casual, pot luck type thing. Also, the Cool Whip stays fluffy, which is better presentation for something fast and easy.

My family absolutely loved this cake. They wanted a moist cake and they loved the combination of cream cheese with the whipped. The only change I made is I used real whipped cream instead of the frozen whipped topping. I have made it twice and I think I is now a new family favorite.

I used pineapple and blueberry in between layers instead of strawberries. Super easy, and super delicious! I'm making it again today!

Yes, I did make changes. I cut up the strawberries and soak the strawberries in nutmeg, cinnamon and rum for about 4 hours priors to making the cake. It was a good change. Also, I only used  an 8 ounce container rather than the 12 ounce of whipped topping.
