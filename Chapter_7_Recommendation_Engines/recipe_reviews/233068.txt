Getting skin off poblanos was the hardest part of this recipe! These are the changes I made and it was delish!! I chopped whole onion, sautéed with butter then added flour. I used 2 cans of chicken breast (this was all I had). I added cayenne pepper at the end along with spices called for.  Instead of pepper jack, I used 8oz of velveeta and about a cup of sharp cheddar. Really good soup!!

This was great!! I made this with pears and apples - added a little more cinnamon, and I sprinkled coconut and almond pieces on the top - wonderful! Very easy recipe with a great result. I served it with runny custard sauce, whipped cream and raspberries on top. It became a special dessert with special friends over.

It made my home smell wonderful! Used 7 pears but did not double topping.  Wouldn't change a thing!

This was delicious! Next time I will definitely use less maple syrup to cut some of the sweetness. Otherwise it is a keeper. I used a combination of apples and pears. I agree it is more of a crisp than a cobbler.

Oh my gosh this is so delicious!!! I used some pears that we received in a gift basket that were perfectly ripe. My husband loved it and asked if I would make it for Christmas. Next time I will definitely cut back on the sugar. The pears are so sweet anyway, so I'll cut back on both the maple syrup and the brown sugar in the topping. It was amazing, though. We topped it off with some french vanilla ice cream. I can't wait to make it again.

This was very good - I cannot have wheat so I added some finely chopped pecans and ground flaxseed meal to the topping recipe as a sub for the wheat.  I did not use as much butter in the topping, and I used mostly Truvia w/ about a tablespoon of brown sugar as I am trying to limit sugars as well.  Thanks for posting.  
And for those purists - technically, I think this would be considered a "crisp", not a "cobbler", but it's worth making what ever you call it.  :)

I have a pear tree that produces hundreds of pears every year. I have always been at a loss on what I could do with all of them. This recipe is awesome! I make about a dozen cobblers with every harvest (in addition to pear sauce and giving some away). Everyone compliments the recipe when I make it and have asked for the recipe. I have even made it with pears that I have peeled and sliced and frozen in a ziploc and then defrosted. This looks really good in a cast iron pan ;)

I like the simplicity of the ingredients.  I sub'd honey for maple syrup and added salt & vanilla to the maple mix for flavor as the recipe has no salt.  I halved the brown sugar and oil in the crumble making it a little dryer, but to our taste.  Overall a solid recipe.

We liked it!  Made it according to recipe with red pears and real maple syrup.  When I mixed up the topping. though, it was not crumbly  -  it was pretty wet, so I think 1 stick of butter (total) will be enough next time (1.5 or 2 Tbl to coat and the rest for the crumble).  Oh, and you can do the coating process right in the baking dish - no need for another bowl!

It was so good! Added a little powdered ginger to pear mixture. Baked it in a cast iron skillet. I don't care for pears... But baked? A whole other yummy animal!

so glad I made this!  I needed to use up some pears that weren't ripening correctly. I also had two apples that were a little bruised.  This was great! Vanilla ice cream on top, and it was a wonderful dessert for a fall night. Didn't change one thing other than adding the two apples.

Very good. I made it using a combination of apples & pears since the pears I had were overripe and 4 turned into about 2 by the time I got done cutting away the overripe parts so I added 3 Granny Smith apples to the mix. The only changes I made (besides the apple/pear combo) was to add some toasted chopped walnuts to the topping (I had some that needed to get used before they were too far out of date) and I added an additional teaspoonful of cinnamon to the fruit mixture along with the butter & maple syrup. Because of the additional fruit & nuts I turned the cooking temp down to 350? and upped the cooking time to about 55 minutes. Because of all the brown sugar & butter I was hoping for a caramel sauce but it was thinner than I expected. Maybe once it cools in the fridge it will thicken up. I served it with a little real whipped cream. Overall it was quite good and I'll very likely make this again.

Easy-Peasy!  Followed the directions nearly exactly as we had four pears that needed to get eaten up.  Only changes were that I used the juice of one lemon since I had one on hand, increased the cinnamon and added a little allspice and a little ginger.  Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream over the top.  Delicious!

Made this for my sisters birthday as she is healthy and gluten free so needed something with fruits, oats and no gluten. The crumb topping was delicious . I found it easy to make and all guests very much enjoyed.  Midway thru making, I decided to make a second one for us at home since it was so simple.  Ill eat it for breakfast too in a pinch.

This recipe was great. Used 3 pears and an apple. Mixed in with the pears a little bit of vanilla, white sugar and cinnamon along with the lemon juice. Found the syrup made the topping a little bit chewy and sticky but it was still good. It was more wet than the dry crubble topping I was expecting. Would make again.

This was excellent! I made it with pears, which made the dessert a bit fancier (with apples, I'm sure it's delicious, too). As other reviewers said, this is a recipe for a crisp, not a cobbler. I cut back on the sugar by half a cup and subbed whole wheat flour instead of white for the topping. I served it warm, with a little heart made of strawberries as decoration. It was a perfect Valentine's Day treat!

This was delicious and so easy! The only thing I would change is add more pears because I used pears from my pear tree and they were small. I would also add more lemon juice because I like a little more tartness. Other than that it was great! I enjoyed the use of the maple syrup, it gave it an interesting flavor.

I had some pears that were getting very ripe and decided to make this. I was glad to see the suggestions for reduced sweetener, which I followed (my reason for 4 stars). Because my pears were so ripe, it was a little runny. So, if your pears are very ripe you may want to add some thickener to the fruit. Flavor was delicious. We gobbled it up!

Used the crumb topping for a peach and raspberry pie. That's why I only gave it 4 stars.

This was amazing!! Just the one simple change of the syrup adds so much to the recipe. I made the Apple version and was hesitant trying it out with company coming, but everyone loved it!! Perfect amount of tart and sweet!!

It was nice that it’s so easy to make and the pear mixture was great. But the topping had so much sugar in it that it wasn’t even edible. I had to restart and cut the sugar in half to make it edible at all. And I was disappointed when I found out this was a crisp, not a cobbler.

My family enjoyed this and fought over the last piece.  I followed the recipe Except for using 5 apples instead of the 4 and adding an extra .5 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Yummy!

Must have with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! I think I would rather use a traditional crisp topping then using oats as the recipe suggests. And I think next time I want to add dried cranberries for a more holiday inspired dish. Thanks for sharing

Made it for Thanksgiving this year and everybody loved it! Only suggestion is maybe peel the apples and my only complaint is that it was a bit liquidy, but otherwise great! I used 3 pink lady apples and Log House maple syrup and fresh lemon juice.

The flavor of this was very good and it was super easy to make, but the end result had so much soupy liquid in the bottom that I decided not to serve it to company... not sure what I did wrong.

This recipe is delicious! I used 8 local apples, tossed with the lemon juice, syrup and butter, added 1tsp vanilla. Then doubled everything except brown sugar. Baked as directed in buttered 9x13 dish. So good! Thanks for this great recipe!

Oh, this is so yummy. I didn't have any maple syrup so I used homemade chokecherry syrup. 
I'd also use way more pears in the recipe. Possibly even double the amount. that is the only issue we have. It's delicious!

I really liked this recipe. But I did make some of the changes suggested in other reviews. I used a tablespoon of honey in lieu of the maple syrup. I also used a mix of pears and apples. The pears worked better when they were a bit less ripe (the ripe ones were too mushy.) I would recommend this recipe to others!

I added an apple. Dish was great but a little watery. Crush was still firm. Guests loved it. Next time I'll not use as much sugar in the topping and (perhaps) riper pears.

So simple and delicious!  I used canned pears and peaches because it's what I had on hand and needed to use them.  It's pretty hard to mess this up, so am not sure why people had issues and gave it a low rating.  Thanks for the recipe.  I've been baking for 40 years and love easy recipes!

It was wonderful.  We like the crisp part and thus made a little extra of this.

I made this with some pears that were wasting away in my fridge after Christmas. This recipe was perfect. I didn't change a thing and it was really delicious! Great recipe for pears.

Too sweet and I didn't even add the maple syrup.
Perhaps just a half cup of the brown sugar would be plenty. My pears were very sweet to start with.
But I loved that a lot of healthy things got into my kids tummies! Apples, pears, oats, and I even used sour dough starter instead of flour to reduce the phytic acid!

Great cobbler, especially warm! Tossed in two ripe apples I had too. After sprinkling topping on I poked it down into the pears a bit before baking - gave it a little depth. Will use pears more often in cobbler.

I added some coconut flakes on top and gave it a little extra flavor 
Next time I make it I would put less sugar, it was too sweet to me.

I did make changes. I could not figure out how many cups of sliced pears  because pears vary in size so much! So I used 6 cups which I thought may be double. Then I also doubled the recipe. The topping was too thick so I made a second pear cobbler and used the rest of the topping on it, but I had to add flour and oats because the topping was not crumbly. Everything looks great and I can hardly wait to eat it!

I used pears from our backyard tree and it was delicious! I used just over half the maple syrup to cut back on the sweetness a bit. Apart from that I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect.

Totally delicious with pears. I put in less sugar and butter than it called for, and it was still heavenly.

Delicious!  Easy to make.  Instead of using maple syrup, I just added a tiny amount of honey and cinnamon to the apples before adding the topping.  I added pecans to the topping because I had some.  I can see that I will have to double the recipe when I make it again.

I've made this recipe several times and every time it gets rave reviews. I never have to worry about the bananas turning dark, because it never lasts long enough! I may have used more cool whip on the top because I got a large tub, but the recipe is perfect..just make sure the cream cheese is room temp. Yum!

I used firm, green pears so I baked them about an hr., until they were soft.   When the dish had sat for a while, I discovered fluid accumulating in the pan.  I think the syrup s/b reduced and I believe some of the extra liquid was from the pears.  I made the dish for someone else so I suggested he bake it at 350 for another 30 min.  I suspect using a larger pan would help evaporate off some of the liquid. Tapioca might help, also.

I used 3 pears and 2 apples; reduced the maple syrup to 1/4 cup. It's quick and yummy. Rave reviews from friends and family.

This was so good!  I used a longer baking dish and threw in a handful of blueberries with the apples.  That added some color and It was done in a  little less than 45 minutes. Didn't have ice cream so finished it off with whipped cream. My husband enjoyed it so this was definitely added to my recipe box!

Made it almost to specifications....I had one extra really ripe pear that I added.  We loved it with vanilla gelato.  The house smelt fantastic while it was cooking.  Yum Yum and while I write this, my husband is busy licking his plate!!!!!!

I used dark brown sugar and pears that I canned myself. So I didn't add the cinnamon or lemon juice because that was already in the canned jar. It turned out amazing and tastes great!

This was a hit when I had my family over.  Served it with a scoop of vanilla Haagen Dazs and couldn't have been better.  Used pears only and added a bit more maple syrup and cinnamon.

Very good.... I made it just the way the recipe stated using pears. Only sub was light butter pancake syrup, because that is what I had on hand and it was so yummy! Great Recipe.

Made this recipe with pears.  Simple ingredients, easy to make, and delicious! Best served warm with vanilla icecream.
