Awesome recipe!!  Loved the taste of the lobsters, so easy to grill them and then mix the chunks with this authentic sauce.  I used corn tortillas, which required me to hold the tortilla down onto the grill with a spatula while I was cooking it.  I got the hang of it and the rest of them turned out perfect!!

I used chicken for this recipe (hubby isn't a huge seafood-at-home fan) and these were AMAZING. The flavor of the Herdez sauce was absolutely perfect. I loved the light crunch of the grilled tortilla with the melty cheese, warm filling with just the right amount of heat, and cool toppings. I added a drizzle of sour cream which was mixed with some of the Herdez tomatilla sauce and the whole meal was fantastic!! Definite keeper!

I made this using the Herdez Pasilla Cooking sauce and it was amazing. We loved the smoky spicy flavors. Excellent! Thanks for the recipe QHHunters.
