Fantastic!! I made this a few times already. The first time I only let the chicken marinade for a few hours. The next two times I prepared it in the morning and let it marinade all day. Soooo moist and tender. It was good both ways but the longer you can marinade your chicken the better. I did scale the recipe back a bit since it makes quite alot.This is my new standard way of doing chicken on the grill. Thanks so much for sharing!!

My family loved this marinade on boneless chicken breast.  I used 6 large peices and cut the recipe in half using the conversion chart.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and only had half the amount of soy sauce so I used 1/2 soy and 1/2 teriaki sauce and just a dash of salt.  I also baked mine in the oven on 375 for 40 minutes instead of dragging out the grill:o)  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I have to put my two cents in on this marinade.  Oh my gosh, I love it!!!  I have used it on chicken, pork and beef. It not only tenderizes, but gives great flavor.  A nice change from barbeque sauce. The recipe does make a large amount, but I now keep it in a bottle in the fridge to have on hand for whenever I want to marinate something.  I was a bit skeptical, but after trying it, I'm sold.  My husband loves it (as do I).  Thanks Jill, for this fabulous recipe. I wish I could give it more stars!

I scaled this down to 12 servings for three boneless chicken breasts.  I used olive oil vs. vegetable oil.  I always use low sodium soy sauce and I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried.  I made this in the morning and let it marinate all day.  The chicken was very tender and full of flavor.  This would be great for kabobs!

I recently made this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and was very pleased at the result.  It makes A LOT so I refrigerated the leftover marinade to use another time soon.  Due to the soy sauce, there's no way this recipe needs the salt.  I left out the parsley simply because I didn't have any.  I'll make this again.

We used this for steak and it was AWESOME!  We tried one batch exactly as the recipe stated and for the second batch, we added 1/2 bottle of Italian dressing and 1 Tbsp. liquid smoke.  The steaks were delicious and very tender.  This recipe is a keeper at our house!  Thanks!

This is the best chicken marinade ever, even my very picky daughter said "don't loose this one mom". I did not add the salt either as some reviewers suggested. The soy sauce made it salty enough.

Very easy.  Very yummy.  Marinaded the chicken boobs overnight and then barbecued them.  Had company over and got rave reviews.  Will make again.

Very good marinade as written, sensational with the addition of garlic and brown sugar.  I added 4 cloves of garlic, chopped, and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  I also opted to use the zest of one lemon instead of the lemon juice.  I never use the salt and find that the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce provide enough for our taste.  This time, I used chicken thighs and let them marinate over night before putting them on the grill.  I set the grill up for indirect grilling, browned the skin over the coals and then moved them over to the cooler side to finish cooking.  The flavor of the marinade was down to the bone! I've used this for awhile and have since cut the oil in the recipe down to 1/2 cup and added other items in my own custom version.

Very good!  I used this on boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I marinated them about 4 hours, and then grilled them.  It was very tasty & not overpowering.  Great recipe, thanks!

Here's the deal.  I made this exactly according to the recipe, no modifications.  Just happened to have everything it called for on hand (I couldn't believe it, either - that never happens).  The first night, we only let the chicken breast marinate for 1 hour before baking it (375 for about 40-45 min).  Comparing it to recent chicken I've cooked, it was very much juicier, and tasty.  HOWEVER.  I then used the rest of the leftover marinade (it makes a lot) to soak some more chicken in, overnight in the fridge.  Cooked it up for dinner tonight and it was RIDICULOUSLY juicy and delicious, and the flavors of the marinade had blended better.  3-4 stars for the one-hour marination, 5 stars for the overnight marination.  We liked this one.

Ummmm, NO....Sorry, did this exactly as shown on the recipe.  I make marinades all the time.  This was way too salty and way too much Worst sauce.  Sure citrus is going to make the meat tender and juicy, but I didnt like it at all. Red wine vinegar???  Apple cider vinegar would have been better.  Im surprised at the great reviews.  Made this for the first time and took to friends house, they were polite but we all had the same reaction.  Sorry.

I have made this dish a thousand times already and it's always AMAZING.  During all of those prepping occasions I've experimented with the recipe and marinating times.  This chicken is best on the grill, the oven and pan did it no justice.  I like to add a few minced cloves of garlic, or a tsp of the already minced to save time.  I've also tried Tastefully Simple's Garlic Garlic and it works wonders in a pinch!  Per previous reviews, a quick dash of hot sauce really makes a statement without over doing it.  If you don't have dry mustard, yellow or brown work just as well (fyi I matched the amounts, tb-tb).  I also subbed EVOO for the oil.  Personally I find cutting the chicken into strips helps cut down on cook time and adds more flavor, since more meat touches the marinade :) 

As for marinading time, 4 hrs is perfect!  6 and 2 will work, but overnight is too long.  The meat gets too salty and cooks slightly from the vinegar and lemon making it dry and causing it to cook unevenly.   

My husband liked the chicken so much we had it 3 times a week for 2 months, lol! Then, on an out of state trip, he made me go to the store for the ingredients so his family could try it :) They loved it too.

I'm currently experimenting with subbing salt substitute, omitting the soy sauce and using water instead of the oil. (Hubby's on a strict diet)  I'll let you now how it turns out.  Enjoy!!!

This recipe for marinade is now the only one I use.  It is Great! I don't use the oil, you don't need it.  I also try to marinate the chicken as long as possible.  We make chicken A LOT! and this is priceless.  I have grilled the chicken and baked it in the oven using this marinade - either way is great! If you bake it, cover the pyrex with foil so it doesn't dry out.  THANK you for this recipe -

This was pretty good marinade.  I changed the servings to 10 instead of 32.  I followed the ingredients and measurements exactly but then added 1 clove of garlic and 1TBS. of honey.  Will be making this one again!

This marinade rocks! My boyfriend actually loves it! I've made this every week for a month.  I've learned that I like to add some brown sugar, and I like around 6 hours of marinating - anything more is too tart, anything less is not juicy enough.

What a DELICIOUS marinade. Used it on bone-in chicken breasts and cooked on the grill after marinading 4 hours. Incredibly moist and just the best flavor. For what it's worth, I always poke a few holes in my chicken with a fork before adding to the marinade so it will get inside the chicken. Also, I put everything in a ziplock bag and massage the marinade into the chicken periodically. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is the perfect chicken marinade.  If you cut the recipe to 16 servings, that's about right for a 4 lb butchered bird.

Tried this first with chicken and thought that it needed a little something to give it more zing.  The chicken was very tender and tasty but next time I will add something to make it a better than good meal. Tried it a second time with pork tenderloin but added one clove of minced garlic to a quarter recipe of the marinade.  The result was over the top - beyond 5 stars.  By the way, you get a lot of bang for little effort with this one.

I never leave reviews because I usually alter the recipes I find so significantly, it would be easier to just add a new recipe.  That was not the case here!!  I was looking for an alternative to my sweeter marinade I usually make and this is hands down, one of my favorite recipes so far.  I halfed the recipe as it does make a lot. I used olive oil instead of vegetable and less than called for. I omitted the extra salt and added onion powder and garlic powder (maybe 1 1/2 tsp of each) and marinated overnight.  Awesome on the grill!

Good, but not great. I used canola oil in place of vegetable and marinated for 6 hours in the fridge.  I think for the best flavor I may marinate overnight next time.

All guests from 18 to 88 gave this two thumbs up! I used this recipe to marinate thick, meaty, boneless, skinless chicken breasts. The only change I made was adding garlic and ginger - they kicked up the flavor just a notch to my family's taste buds. I used a corn cob holder to poke holes on both sides and tenderize the chicken - the prongs are just the right size. I then marinated the chicken for 6 hours and cooked it on a gas grill. During the last 5 minutes I added a sweet bbq sauce to half of the chicken. I am not a bbq sauce fan but I must say the combo of this marinade with a sweet bbq sauce was very good. This marinade is a keeper and shines on its own or as a base for other sauces. I will be using this often.

Really nice, basic marinade.  I didn't even have to marinade my chicken very long and it gave it a wonderful flavor.  Will be used over and over.  The only thing I changed was I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

I haven't tried this recipe for chicken, but I've tried this Beef Marinade http://barbeque.allrecipes.com/az/bfmrind.asp for which is almost identical. Nice to know it's good on chicken too

This is my new favorite chicken marinade.  I knew it would be amazing when I read the list of ingredients, I love those flavors.  The only changes I made were- substituted dry mustard for Dijon mustard (ran out of dry mustard yesterday), instead of lemon juice I used lime juice (I prefer lime to lemon), eliminated salt (because I thought the soy sauce and Worcestershire probably had enough salt) and fresh parsley (didn't have any in the house).  We marinated thin-sliced chicken breast for three hours and then grilled it. The next time I make this marinade, I'll reserve some to marinate vegetables.  Thank you Jillypooh for sharing this incredibly versatile and delicious recipe.

Have used this marinade several times and the chicken always comes out tender and full of flavor.  I sometimes add fresh garlic.  I cook mine on an indoor grill pan.  Delicious!

Brined bone in chicken breasts and leg quarters overnight.  Marinated them for 10 hours today before grilling.  Did not add any sauce when grilling and it was very tasty.  Thanks for a good recipe.

I don't know if I have different taste buds or something but I followed the recipe exactly. I used fresh parsley, fresh lemon juice, etc. My chicken came out tasting TOO SOUR/ACIDIC. It could be to the amount of vinegar, worchestshire and lemon juice altogether. I had marinated chicken legs and thighs overnight and barbecued on our grill. While the chicken was juicy, it just tasted TOO ACIDIC!!! I would not make this again.

This recipe is awesome! I was browsing recipes and came across it. I decided to try it and so I made the marinade and put it in. I only marinated it for two hours because I found the recipe so late in the day. It still came out delicious! Everyone loved it and said how tasty it was. So juicy! One of my favorite recipes. I put it in a glass baking dish and baked it on 350 for 45 minutes. Next time I plan on marinating it overnight! Highly recommend it!

AWESOME!  Tastes almost just like chicken BBQ chicken!  I made as is, minus black pepper and I realized as the marinade was almost complete I was out of parsley.  I also decreased the oil a little to trim some fat.  This is def a repeater at the LTH house!  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!!

Made exactly as directed.  No adding things.  No omitting things.  No substituting things.  I'm giving this marinade 5 stars without changing any ingredients.  Makes me crazy when people rate a recipe that they've changed so much ..... I'm left wondering why they bothered to rate it since they've basically rewritten it.  This marinade is outstanding as written.  We loved it!

Very good recipe, but I did omit the salt with the soy sauce being so salty as is. I marinaded chicken breasts overnight, grilled, sliced and place on top of a salad tossed with balsamic vinagrette dressing. Served with Darbey bread (this website)and it was a perfect for a hot day meal.

Wonderful! I prepared this marinade yesterday and let the chicken (boneless skinless breasts) sit in it overnight. Grilled this evening and served over mixed greens with my own balsamic vinaigrette, hubby loved it. Will be adding this to weekly rotation. Thanks for sharing Jillypoo!

I tried this marinade for 36 chicken skewers.  It was fabulous and got so many compliments.  The only thing that I did differently was to add one clove of minced garlic, teriyaki sauce and I added some honey. In place of dried mustard, I used dijon mustard.  I omitted the salt since all the sauces had enough salt in them already.  I let it marinate overnight, prepared the skewers the next day but actually barbequed the next day after that.  Got rave reviews, everyone loved it. The chicken was so tender and flavourful.

This is an excellent marinade.  Just the right flavor.  I marinaded the chicken breast for about 30 minutes and it turned out very flavorful, but not overpowering.

I marinated boneless, skinless chicken breasts overnight in this marinade and I'm sorry to say that this made the chicken waaayy too salty.  I even omitted the 1 teaspoon of salt and added 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar but still - much too salty.  When I realized this upon removing the chicken from the oven to taste a piece, I knew right away that my husband would not like it because he does not like a lot of salt on his food.  I rinsed the cooked chicken under hot running water to wash it off.  Luckily, I had on hand a bottle of Wegman's Spicy Orange sauce to brush over the chicken (it is somewhat sweet) to counteract some of the saltiness and my husband said it was good.  (he had no idea what I went through).  However, I will be searching for another marinade recipe.  Sorry.

This marinade makes an excellent base (if you doctor everything like I do) that I believe would taste good with any meat. I made a few changes for my own taste by adding about a tbs. of minced garlic, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, about 1/4 c. honey, and a few dashes thyme. The honey really seemed to round out the flavor, for those concerned about the acidity, and didn't make the chicken too sweet at all. We marinated three large chicken breasts (with plenty holes poked in them) for about 3 hours before grilling and it was still excellent. As a side note/suggestion, we also grilled up some herbed and olive oiled zucchini, squash, and vidalia onions. Delicious!

WOW!  I have used this marinade twice now.  The first was on boneless/skinless tenderloins that we grilled.  They were so tender they melted in your mouth and the flavor was phenomenal!  Today I used this on split chicken breasts with rib meat (got for a steal at the grocery) and baked them on a roasting pan for an hour at 375 after marinading overnight...and they were great!  Very juicy and tender.  Used the liquid left over for marinading and reduced down to a sauce and brushed over the chicken when it was done.  This is my go-to marinade for chicken from now on!!

Excellent marinade!  I was looking for something that had good flavor without being too spicy or too sweet- this was the perfect solution.  I modified it slightly by omitting the salt (not necessary with soy and Worcestershire IMO) and adding minced garlic and onion (no fresh on hand).  Even with only five hours in the marinade, it turned out great.  This is one for the regular rotation.

Gives chicken even boneless skinless breasts a good flavor.  I used just about a half cup on four breasts, and had at least two cups of marinade left over for future use (stored in fridge).  Didn't have much time to leave on, so I used my multi-blade meat tenderizer.  I recommend one of these little wonders highly - it not only breaks up tough fibers in meat but also helps to drive the marinade into the meat. The result was extremely tender and tasty meat.  My nine-year old son gave the chicken a very high thumbs up, and he often complains that it is "too chewy".

This was really good, but it still needs a tomato-based edge.  You could start with 1 tbl. of ketchup, but instead I pulsed a peeled/seeded tomato and added it to the marinade.

A touch of brown sugar balances the acid in this recipe.   Try it - - you'll like it!     Don't marinade too long or it'll actually change the texture as the acids begin to "cook" the chicken, just like in ceviche.    You will notice a change in the texture of your chicken if you marinade it longer than an hour or two.

The chicken was moist. The overall flavor was okay. I added bbq sauce because it makes everything tastes better, lol, and threw it back in the oven for about 15minutes. It was real good by then.

My kids' favorite chicken recipe.  I put the raw chicken and marinade into a freezer bag and freeze it.

Tasty and easy - marinated chicken breasts for several hours - left a little aside (prior to marinating) for baking - good stuff.

This is the very best chicken maranade. I made this for a family dinner party and had several requests for the recipe. I did make some minor changes I did not have red wine vinegar so I used white vinegar, instead of dry mustard I used a spicy mustard and I used half olive oil and half veg. oil and added 1/2 tsp of red cayenne pepper for just a little kick.  I marinated 4 lbs of chicken tenders for 6 hrs but did not grill it all so left the remainder in the marinade over night and it was even better being marinaded over 24 hrs!

This was so easy to prepare and yet so tasty on the chicken!  My middle son couldn't get enough which is odd since he's not very much of a meat eater.  My younger son is extremely picky and doesn't really like chicken and yet his eyes lit up when he tried it.  I will definitely make it again!

This wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  It wasn't bad, but there are much better marinades out there and I don't think this deserves 5 stars.  It actually lacked flavor which was surprising since my chicken marinated overnight.  I may try it one more time, using full sodium soy sauce and a few other spices.  I used "light" and maybe that is why it was disappointing.

Outstanding. I only marinaded 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts for 2 hours before grilled. Used indirect heat. These turned out so juicy and tasty, I can only imagine how good they'll taste after marinading for several hours. I cut the recipe to 8 servings, perfect for the 4 breasts. Thanks for a great recipe! Hubby LOVED it!

Wow,Wow, and .... Wow... I marinated my chicken thighs in this dreamy marinade for about 7 hours.  This is an exceptional marinade.  The only thing I changed was.... I did 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar and 1/4 cup of BALSAMIC ... vinegar...  I thought the sugars of the balsamic would carmelize nicely on the grill...and I was right.  I'm looking forward to making this again..  thank you so much for sharing...

We loved this! By far and away, this resulted in the most moist chicken we have ever eaten. I halved the recipe, but otherwise everything was the same. I marinated 6 medium chicken breasts for 4 hours, then baked them with all the marinade in a foil-lined 9x13 pan covered tightly with foil at 400 degrees for 35 minutes. The meat thermometer read 165 degrees and it was just perfect. The secret ingredient is the dried mustard - yum! This does make a LOT of marinade, even when halved. I had to put a cookie sheet underneath the pan because it was bubbling over in the oven toward the end. Delicious, delicious, delicious... this one's a keeper!

Really good marinade for chicken. I tenderized my skinless boneless chicken breasts and then put the marinade in a zip bag with the chicken. I probably marinated it for about 1 1/2 hours and then grilled on my indoor grill. VERY moist and flavorful. I did omit salt and added garlic powder and onion powder and scaled the recipe back for 6 and it was plenty. Also used olive oil b/c that is what I had. I know some people don't like reviews when we change the recipe but sometimes it just is strictly a personal preference as to the changes made. I practically add garlic and onion to most everything so that is why I added them to the marinade.

This marinade was awesome! Didn't have red wine vinegar or dry mustard & only had time to marinate the chicken for an hour. Cooked the chicken on the grill...moist & tasty.  Sliced the leftover chicken and added to a salad the next day. Can't wait until I have all the ingredients & longer time for marinating. Adding this to my arsenal of must have recipes.

My family loves this recipe!  I have made it several times in the last couple of weeks and no matter how much I make, the family wants more!  I use olive oil to replace vegetable oil, Braggs liquid aminos to replace soy sauce and apple cider vinegar to replace red wine vinegar.  I use the juice of one lemon, and zest the whole thing as well.  Trust me, it's worth the effort.  I rarely have fresh parsley, but dried works as well.  I take as many flash frozen chicken breasts (I buy them in huge bags at the big box stores) as I can stuff into a gallon ziplock bag and pour the mixed marinade right on top.  Seal the bag and squish it all around.  Then I put the sealed bag into another sealed gallon ziplock bag (to make sure there will be no spills) and pop it into the fridge for 24 or so hours.  Super easy and rave reviews when it comes off the grill.  This is definitely a new staple in our household.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved this marinade.  I used it on boneless chicken breasts and marinated them for about 4 hours.  The flavor was excellent and the chicken was very moist and delicious.  I scaled the recipe way back since I was only preparing 2 breasts.  I'll probably use this often.

This was excellent and gave a really nice flavor.  I marinated the chicken for about 9 hours.  I think I may half it next time though because it makes a ton when you're only grilling 4 chicken breasts.

Wondering if the negative reviewers realize the recipe is 32 servings?  Enough for a huge chicken bake, so perhaps the sour/bitter is from too much marinade?

This is a GREAT marinade!  Not only is it wonderfully flavorful, but it made my chicken so tender!!  I scaled back the serving size to 24 and used a large pkg of boneless/skinless chicken breasts and it was the perfect amount.  I marinaded it the day prior to BBQing.  I cut back the salt by 1/4 tsp at the suggestion of other reviewers and it was perfect.  I will definintely use this marinade again and again!!!

Very tasty.  I used canola oil instead of veg and reduced the amount to make it healthier.  I marinated it for 24 hrs.  Will make this again.

Just made this chicken for grilled chicken paninis. It is excellent my 6 yo daughter took apart the sandwich after one bite and ate the chicken before the rest of her meal since she enjoyed it so much. I marinated it for a hr and broiled it. Very tender and flavorful chicken!

Probably one of the BEST chicken marinades ever. Easy simple and tasty. My daughter who hates chicken has even tasted this recipe and given her thumbs up on it. Thank you JillyPooh for sharing this great great recipe.

I've made this twice: once using steaks and once using chicken. Both went on the grill and they were outstanding. This will be my go-to marinade for all meats!

After all the great reviews I was some what disappointed, served it to 4 people NONE made a comment on it, good or bad. The chicken breast was better than the wings. It was nice and moist.  sorry, but I judge a recipe on how others like it and since there were no comments at all it wasn't great.... or they would have said something.

I made this as written and was very skeptical that my husband wouldn't care for it. He LOVED it! I had some boneless chicken thighs that I left sitting in the marinade for about 5 hours and cooked them on the grill.

I can' believe this recipe received so many positive reviews. I marinated skinless boneless chicken breasts for about 3 hours and was really disappointed with the end result. The Worcestershire/vinegar/lemon combo was too sour and the soy made it a little too salty for my taste. I could see maybe using it on a tough cut of beef, but i will definitely never use it on chicken again.

Delicious marinade!  My breast was in the marinade for about 4 1/2 hours.  I then baked it at 375 for 37 minutes.  Oh, my!  So good! And juicy and tender and tasty.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, which I plan to keep and use often.  By the way, I did omit the salt and have to agree that it doesn't need it because of the soy sauce.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.

This is great, I use it for steaks too. Everything is tender and full of flavour. I stuck to the recipe except for the red wine vinegar, I substituted white wine vinegar. It's a perfect blend of flavours. I have done long and short marinating times, and had great results with both. I mix a batch up and keep it in the fridge so it's so quick and easy to use. I dropped a couple frozen chicken breasts into some marinade and let them marinate while they defrosted.

This is my go-to marinade. I used olive oil (garlic infused and regular extra virgin olive oil both work well) and instead of parsley, cilantro (only bc I didnt have parsley on hand). It's a great marinade. The lemon juice also really enhances the cilantro. I then bake the chicken (no grill) and it's always a hit.

Followed recipe exactly except subbed dried parsley for fresh.  Turned out so great.  Will definitely make again.  Oh, I scaled back the servings so I wouldn't make too much.

Wow!!!  I was looking for something a little different than the Asian marinade I ususally use.  This is it!  I do think if you marinated all night it would be a little strong.  I marinated in the morning for a BBQ at 6:00 and the meat was darkened (and flavorful) from the marinade.  Just so you can estimate.......I marinated 14 1/2 breasts and it was just the right amount of marinade.  Very, very, very, good~

This chicken is really good.  The nice thing about it is it uses ingredients that you would most likely have in your pantry.  I halved the recipe for three chicken breasts and there was plenty of marinade to spoon over white rice.  I think you could skimp some on the oil, but other than that it's perfect.  I was only able to marinate it for two hours and it still tasted good.  Even my two-year old ate it...that alone is worth 5 stars.

This was a good marinade. I know it's a chicken marinade but I used this for my pork chops that I was about to grill. The only thing that i didn't use was the lemon juice (because I didn't have it on hand) I marinated my pork chops for about an hour and a half and it turned out great. I think I'll be using this recipe from now on instead of buying a marinade at the store.

this recipe make a huge amount so be prepared.  i normally only make 1/2.  the longer you let the chicken soak, the better - it just melts in your mouth.

We have been using this marinade since the summer of '09, and we love it.  We like it best when we use boneless, skinless chicken breaasts.  It is a crowd pleaser.....even my picky eaters love this one!  You will not be disappointed.

You know the old joke about something that "tastes like chicken?" Well, not this! Are you worried about the price of steak, or if the cut you buy will be tough? Well, your worries are over because this recipe will make your CHICKEN taste exactly like STEAK, because it consists of the basic steak marinade ingredients (see Steak for Marinade I, and Best Steak Marinade in Existence). If you marinate it for 24 hours, then grill it, just close your eyes and you'll think it's the most tender steak you've ever had. However, if you want your chicken to "taste like chicken" you might want to try something else...

This was fantastic!  I took the chicken out of the freezer and marinaded in the fridge while it thawed, so it ended up marinating for like 1.5 days... and it was soooo tender.  What a great flavor, too.  I always think of worcestershire sauce as going on beef, but now that I've seen how good it is on chicken, we will definitely be having this again.

Delicious! I was afraid I made too much chicken but my family (even my 8 year old who usually complains when I make chicken) had a whole piece. Definitely a keeper and will make it again!

I really wasn't expecting too much given the list of ingredients, but I was wrong. My family LOVED this recipe and we have since had it for guests who raved about it as well.  It's moist and has great flavor.  I used leftovers in a salad the next day for lunch and then in a pasta salad for dinner.  Thanks!

Very good marinade - I subbed olive oil and added a couple of crushed garlic cloves and let the chicken soak in it  overnight - good eats!

I have to give it 4 stars because of the saltiness. I omitted the salt and even then the amount of soy sauce made it a little salty. Cut back on the soy sauce. Great marinade. I marinated overnight and grilled the following evening. thanks

Fantastic!  I made a half recipe and also cut the oil back to 1/4 cup (watching calories). My husband loved it and the chicken comes off the grill so golden brown

I made this recipe large enough for 86 (probably a bit too much) for a birthday party we had this past weekend.  I marinated the 60 something chicken thighs for 24 hours. 

The chicken was such a hit that I RAN out of chicken.   I just emailed this marinade to everyone in attendance because I had so many requests for it.

I've use Allrecipes weekly for the past 6 months, but have not felt compelled to submit a review until now. 

Even though I was only able to pick at my daughter's chicken and didn't get a full piece of chicken to myself, I highly recommend this marinade based on the comments received by our party-goers.

Delicious, juicy and tender chicken!  Makes a large amount, which was great, and easily marinaded 6 large chicken breasts!  I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours, and it had plenty of flavor, so  I'm done looking...this was great and so easy!

This was awesome! This was my first attempt at making marinaded grilled chicken and I was very pleased with the result. I must confess that I didn't measure ingredients, I just kind of ball parked it and I added a bit of minced garlic. Also, I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic. I will definitely make this again.

wow, i thought this was really delicious.  my 6 year old said it was just okay, but she ate it all anyway.  i was afraid that i might be able to taste some of the individual ingredients sticking out in the flavor, but i really couldn't.  it all blended together really nicely.  the chicken ended up looking really good too.  yum!

the recipe was great, but you really don't need additional salt, there's enough salt from the soy sauce. I made it both ways and the way without the added salt was alot tastier.

Great marinade! The chicken was very tender. I used it on shish kebobs with chicken, zucchini, peppers, mushrooms and red onions. I substituted dijon mustard for the mustard powder and cut down a little on the lemon juice(to about 1/4 cup) as another reviewer suggested. I marinated the kebobs for 3 hours. Delicious!

I didn't read any of the reviews (but I usually do) before making this marinade. It turned out great! I didn't use any parsley, b/c I didn't have any and I used only about a Tablespoon of lime juice instead of lemon juice(that's all I had). I let my chicken marinate overnight and this was some tasty chicken. A++ I only poured about half of it over the chicken. I put the other half in the refrigerator. I'm going to use it for steak or pork. I haven't deciced yet.

This was great! I just used what I had, so I used a little less soy sauce and omited the dry mustard. I used dry parsley instead of fresh. I only had time to marinade the chicken for about an hour and it was still very good, my husband was very impressed.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I cut it in half and it was still enough to marinate 4 breasts.  I didn't have any wine vinegar on hand so I used apple cider vinegar and it was still tastey!

This was a great marinade. I will make it again. It gave the chicken a very nice taste, and kept it moist inside. It smelled fantastic while the chicken was on the BBQ.

I usually make a 'tried and true' recipe if I am entertaining guests but since this recipe received great reviews I decided to try it.  I am SO glad I did! This is one of the best marinade recipes I have ever tried.  I did what many suggested and omitted the salt.  I also added 3 tablespoons of brown sugar just to give it a little kick from another suggestion.  It turned out great.  My guests thought the chicken was so juicy with lots of flavor.  Next time, I will marinade it over night instead of  5 hours like I did.  I think it will be unbelievable.

FANTASTIC!  Grilled the marinaded chicken legs last night & I must say, its the best tasting ones I've ever had or made.  I followed the recipe as its stated for 4 big chicken legs and it was enough marinade for it & it would have been fine for 6 legs as well.  Before marinading them I poked holes all over the legs, so the marinade can seep in & marinaded them for 24 hours.  

Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us.

Excellent.   We let this marinate for 3 hours and made 8 servings for one package of chicken.   I substituted prepared mustard for dry,  using a couple tbsps of it.   Grilled the chicken.

I use this marinade for boneless skinless chicken thighs and my family really likes it.  You can marinate them ahead of time and put in a freezer bag and just thaw when ready to use and the flavour is great.

This is excellent!  I only had1/2 the amount soy sauce, so I did 1/2 soy and 1/2 teriyaki....  Will be a new family favorite!

This is hands-down the best chicken marinade I have ever tried!  I also think it will be good for any meat really.
Next time, I will marinate a whole chicken and rotisserie it.

Wow!! this marinade is really wonderful. I made it up for chicken and let it marinade for two days. Baked  it in the oven on 350 for 45 minutes and it was the best i ever had. I will be making this again and again. Plus i can't wait to try it on the grill. Thanks so much JILLYPOOH for such a great recipe. **Update: put this marinade on pork chops and the only thing i can say is OMG!!! really amazing.

I quartered the recipe because I only had two chicken breasts and added a squirt of honey. Be sure to let chicken marinade for at least 4-6 hours in the fridge--that's what makes it delicious!

The parsley dosen't seem to do much one way or the other for this recipe, but, add a little minced garlic and this recipe will really come home. I've used this for years.  I originally made this to use on venison, and then found it works great on chicken, pork or beef.

This is a very good maranade. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Kicked up the seasonings a little and let the boneless chicken breasts maranate in the fridge for about 7 hours then grilled.  Very good! Made a lot so I put chicken in a baggie and covered with maranade. Bottled the rest for later use. Thanks for a great recipe!

Decided to try this because it's so different than the marinades we tend to throw together and I had the ingredients on hand. We loved it. The chicken turned out great.

This is an outstanding marinade!  I wouldn't call it a barbecue sauce because that always makes me think of sauce like Sweet Baby Ray's or similar.  This is a fantastic marinade for grilling chicken and I made no changes to the recipe.  It's PERFECT as is!

Made this yesterday and it is now going to be my go to marinade/baste for my chicken!  Excellent!  I didn't have dry mustard, so I used Goulden's spicy brown prepared mustard and I didn't have parsley so I just left it out.  But the chicken browns so nice and it tastes GREAT!  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is awesome!  I only had balsamic vinegar and plain vinegar so I mixed that 50/50 and this still turned out wonderful.  I normally hate chicken breast but because I am on a healthier lifestyle, I wanted to try to make them better.  This marinade was unexpectedly delicious and I cannot wait to use red wine vinegar (it will only improve the recipe).  Thank you so much for posting this!!!!

Very good marinade...used to marinate chicken for kabobs. I didn't add salt and added two cloves of minced garlic. Even my picky 3 year old and 1 year old gobbled it up!

This is the ONLY way I can get my 6 year old to eat grilled chicken! He scoffs at all chicken except this one...he asks for seconds!  It does taste better the longer you marinade. It does make a lot so I usually freeze some of it for later use.

I let boneless, skinless chicken breast that had been pounded thin marinade overnight.  They were grilled over medium heat until they reached 170 degrees and were absolutely delicious without being dry!  The only change was using dijon mustard instead of dry mustard since I didn't have any dry mustard.  I will definately make this again!

This marinade is my go to marinade. I use Balsamic vinegar instead of red wine, but that's an individual preference. I marinate boneless skinless chicken breasts for 24 hours, and then I cook them in the marinade in a slow cooker for 4 or so hours on high. They are juicy and retain all of the flavor.

Great Marinade, I made it as listed and loved it.  So original recipe gets 5 Stars.  However the second time I made it I added a little liquid smoke.  Even better.  I use a gas grill so if you LOVE the SMOKED flavor, try adding some liquid smoke.

Easy to assemble...accessible ingredients...it doesn't get much better than that!  I only used 1/2 cup of oil and still had enough marinade for over a pound of chicken tenders.  I love the caramel glaze you get at the end of cooking time.  Good flavor and SO MUCH BETTER than ANYTHING you can buy premade at the store!

This was FANTASTIC on grilled chicken wings! Followed the recipe with the exception of adding 3-4 crushed garlic cloves. Everyone raved about the wings! I made 24 wings and there was more than enough marinade :)

Oh my gosh!  We tried this chicken marinade over the weekend and my husband said it was the best chicken he has ever tasted!  We marinaded boneless chicken early in the morning, put it in the refrigator all day to marinate and my husband put it on the grill in the evening!  Yum!!  It was juicy and it tasted so good!

Everyone I've served this to, loves this marinade. I've used it on chicken and pork chops and put the meat on the grill. I also love that there is plenty left over to use again. I put it in a freezer zip lock and store it in my fridge. Thank you so much for sharing!

Delicious!! I didn't have soy sauce on hand so I omitted it.. added a half bottle of greek salad dressing that I've had laying around. Great base recipe!! It can be extremely versatile! I served it with rice and beans. Already planning on using the marinade again tomorrow, maybe with some roasted potatoes :o)

This marinade was exceptional!  My family raved about the chicken thighs I grilled.  Thank goodness I noticed the recipe makes 4 cups - that is a lot!  I cut it by 1/3 and that was plenty for the 10 chicken thighs I made.

I omitted the salt...soy sauce is liquid salt, and added a whisper of teriaki sauce.  Made half a batch for two chicken bosoms and had enough for two batches.  Oh--didn't have dry mustard, used Dijon--delish--  Outside grilled, sure impressed my little Sister!

Wow, I can't believe I'm going to write a review for a marinade, but I had to join the chorus and say how fabulous this one is.  I've always used the powdered marinade in which you add vinegar and water.  Didn't have that on hand so I looked up this one.  Wasn't expecting the great results that I got.  Even my husband, who didn't even even know I used something different, commented on how good it was.  Yummy! I only let it set for about an hour so I'm curious how much more flavorful it'll be after marinading for longer.

I've used this marinade for over a year now and it never fails to get rave reviews. I add minced garlic because I'm addicted to the stuff, but that's the only change. Best to let the chicken marinade overnight.

I love this recipe, I do add a bit of garlic salt, and a little honey. (But only a little so it won't burn on the grill.) Thanks Jillypooh for sharing.

I love this marinade! It's got a little sourness to it and is delicious! I marinated the breasts overnight and grilled them the next day. Leftovers have been just as tasty, especially on salad.

Great recipe, wonderful chicken marinade, I used boneless and skinless chicken breast two thighs and two drumsticks but since soy sauce has salt already I omited the salt and instead of using redwine vineger I used white vinger and I used concentrated lemon juice, great recipe for broiling chicken and hibachi chicken.

I don't know if it was just me or what, but the marinade added nothing more than a peppery taste.  Had company for Memorial Day; decided to serve chicken breasts; marinated 5 breasts for 24 hrs and was more than waste my time.  I wonder if there are others who felt the same about this recipe.  Sorry Jillypooh.

AMAZING!!!!! I found this recipe last week and have already made it 3 times. The first time, I only let the chicken marinate for a few hours and then made shish-kabobs. That was the first time my husband has EVER (in 5 years) said "Wow!" about a meal I've made. 
The 2nd time...marinated overnight and it tasted even better. I will make this again and again. Thank you so much for sharing a wonderful recipe!

I made exactly as written.

Love this recipe.  Makes a ton, so plan accordingly; you can't beat it when cooking for a crowd.  I like to use boneless, skinless thighs, and the leftovers make great chicken sandwiches or slice up the leftovers and put them on a green salad/caesar salad.   Super easy and the ingredients are in the pantry.  I haven't modified the marinade recipe at all except to cut it in half when I have a smaller group.  My extended family always loves this chicken.

This is a great and easy marinade for grilled chicken. I let some boneless chicken breasts marinate in this for about 24 hours, and I found the vinegar taste became a little strong. 

I had doubled the recipe to fit all eight boneless chicken fillets to sit in there. I would recommend cutting the vinegar added by a bit.

You ever read a bunch of reviews say screw it and go for it? Well I did that here. It is just OK. Very oily which is fine when the sauce is mixed up. It was just ok. Not the best not the worst. I would make it again if i had everything on hand. The chicken was flavorful do not get me wrong but it was just OK

Awesome! Only change I had to make was leaving out the dry mustard...didn't have any. I added a few tablespoons of minced garlic and some crushed red pepper. Baked it in the oven at 350 for 45-50 minutes. Will be using this again!

I marinated for 5 hours 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  I omitted the salt as one rater suggested, and upped the parsley to 1/2 cup, since I had a big bunch and wanted to use it up.  I drained the chicken and pan fried it, deglazed the pan with enough water to warm some cooked potatoes and carrots and had a delicious supper!! Great recipe.

I love this recipe because you can grill, bake or fry on the stove top and each method taste great. Let it sit for several hours or even over night and the flavor becomes more bold. It really is delicious!

Marinade for Chicken Haiku: "This quiet flavor. It sneaks up, subtle and nice. Maybe add garlic?" This recipe is a pleasant marinade, not overly-bold or flavorful: it doesn't scream, "Hi! I'm chicken, and I've been swimming in citrus and herbs all day!" I enjoyed it, but if I were to make it again, I'd probably add some minced garlic and crushed red pepper. Otherwise, a good marinade w/ -Bonus!- ingredients that I always have on hand.

This is the best marinade.  I used this on chicken thighs for the meat eating members of my family.  My youngest son and I are vegetarians, so I marinated vegan chicken in this and baked both sets of chicken.  It was delicious.  I will be using this again. Thanks!

I cut this recipe in half to use for 2lbs of boneless chicken breast.  Marinated for 4 hrs.  Very moist and delicious.  Best chicken marinade I've ever used!

Juicy with a subtle tangy flavor. I had omitted the salt because some said it was salty but I just wished I had added salt.

Wow!  This was really delicious.  I was only able to marinate it for one hour, but the taste was fantastic.  We used this in stir fry and it added excellent flavor to the vegetables too!  5*'s!

Pretty good.  I didn't have red wine (sub it for season rice wine vinegar) and in place of soy sauce, I opt for Teriyaki sauce instead.

So super good and easy! I was cooking for 4, so adjusted amounts appropriately. I didn't have any mustard powder, so used about 1 tsp. Dijon mustard instead. Also added a clove of crushed garlic and about 1 T. of brown sugar. Only had a few hours to marinade, but next time I'll leave overnight if I can. Try this, you will like it!!

I did not care for this recipe. It was to salty and bitter tasting, no one in my family liked it. I tried to add some honey but even that could not fix it.

This was good.  I cut it in half and it was just the right amount for 6 good size chicken breasts.  It definitely needs to marinate a while....4 hours was not enough.  8+ hours would be better.

I rated this 4 stars but I wish I could have given it 3.5.  My thoughts on this were "ehhhh".  It's by no means bad, but for me it was just o.k., nothing to rave about, but it's "good".  If I make this again, I'll use less soy sauce because that flavor came through a bit too much for me.

This is a great marinade and so easy to make. I only had a short window before my guests arrived so the chicken only sat in the marinade for about an hour and it was delicious. They all raved about my chicken and asked for my recipe.

I used this with b/s chicken thighs, and when they were done they were fantastic.  I let them marinate for 5 hours, which was perfect.  This made the best chicken shish kababs I have ever had, hands down.

I marinated thick cut boneless pork chops in this sauce for 24 hours and grilled them.  They came out fantastic!  I was a little apprehensive yesterday when I tasted the sauce because the mustard seemed overwhelming.  But, I'm glad I trusted other reviews...everyone loved them and I will definitely be making these again!

excellent marinade!!....I did and entire cut up chicken in this and it was a big hit with the whole family, even my 6yr old son!!...I let it sit for about 5 hours or so...next time I'll try it overnight for even more flavor!!...I halved the recipe and it was just right for a whole chicken in a gallon ziplock bag...I did leave out the salt, I think the worc. and soy have plenty....thanks for a great recipe!!

Delicious!  Saw it featured...and made it the same night.  I didn't have parsley, wine vinegar, or lemons.  I used balsamic vinegar and lime juice. Omitted the parsley.  I pulled some frozen chicken tenders out of the freezer, put them right in the marinade...and left them in the fridge for the day.  They were still a little frozen in the middle...but cooked up perfectly on the grill.  The whole family loved it.

This was a very good marinade.  I marinaded the chicken for about 2-3 hours.  I halved the recipe and it was still more than enough for 3 breasts.  The chicken turned out tender, juicy and well flavored.  No extra sauce needed for this chicken.  I subbed olive oil for vegetable oil, and added about a teaspon of garlic powder since I love garlic.  Otherwise I followed the ingredients and porportions exactly.  Turned out great and the chicken had great color!

WONDERFUL marinade.  Honestly, I did not have dry mustard on hand so I used prepared.  Also, did not have parsley so it was omitted.  I hate when people make changes to the original recipe and rate it anyway but here I am doing it.

We used this recipe as a marinade for grilled chicken drumsticks.  My husband didn't like the marinade at all-he said it tasted sour (vinegar and lemon juice flavors).  I thought the marinade was OK but my husband asked me not to make it again.

This was really impressive.  I halved it and marinated two chicken breasts for about 12 hours.  I used dried parsley in place of fresh.  Then I baked them, covered, at 350 for about 30-40 minutes.  Yum yum, used one breast in a salad. I might freeze the other one for later, I'm so tired of chicken right now...

This marinade was great! I used it for chicken thigh meat, which I cut in small pieces for kabobs. The marinade kept the meat nice and tender while I scorched them on the grill, my grandmother and I loved it! I didn't have dried mustard so I used dried marjoram and dijon mustard instead. It turned out great! Thanks for this easy marinade!

3.18.10 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/30523/marinade-for-chicken/ ... Ten year old daughter loved it.  To me, good, but flavor is very faint.  If I use this again, even less oil or increase the seasoning flavors.  I used on four turkey wings.  My measurements:1c oil, 1/2c soy, 1/4c worcesteshire, red wine vinegar & lemon juice, 1t sugar, 1/2t black pepper, 1T dry mustard

I made this marinade for chicken for a salad pot luck. I used white wine vinegar because I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand. I was asked for this recipe by almost everyone. It was FANTASTIC!!! Thank you for sharing!

Not for us.  Just think it was too many flavors that didn't really blend.  Salty even though I left out salt and did reduced sodium soy sauce.  Will try another.

This was fantastic. I made only one change to the recipe and it was by mistake. I used lime juice instead of lemon juice. Grabbed the wrong bottle. It added a deeper layer of flavor. I will make this mistake again! Also used dried parsley, as it was all I had on hand. I used on chicken thighs (with drumsticks attached) and let them soak all day while I was at work. Threw them one the BBQ and then devoured them when they were ready. I halved the recipe, but probably could have quartered it. It makes a TON. Thank you for the submission.

We liked this very much.  The only change was I did not have fresh parsley.  Making it again today.  We usually use a fireman's BBQ this is a nice change.

Very easy and super tasty! I cut the recipe in half and had plenty for two large chicken breasts.  After letting the chicken marinade for over 4 hours, my husband grilled it on our gas grill and it turned out so juicy and flavorful. We were both impressed and will use this recipe again!

We thought this marinade had a really great flavor, and my chicken came out moist.  I do think that it was a little salty for our tastes though, and if I make this again, I will leave out the additional salt and use low sodium soy sauce. I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes to add a bit of spice which really livened it up some.  Other than the saltiness this was great.

No more dry grilled chicken at my house!  This was delicious!  I did not have lemon juice so I used lime.  I think it added a nice zing to the recipe.  I also only used half the amount of soy sauce because I ran out.  The recipe makes a TON! I will probably cut it in half next time.

Five stars!!!!  Produced some flare-ups from the oil in the marinade on the gas grill, but that also provides a great flavor!!!!  I used boneless chicken breasts...Would be a great marinade for kabobs!

Absolutely fabulous!  I've made it twice and found that it's a real 'keeper'.  I made it exactly to recipe with no changes at all.  It's so great to find another way to dress up chicken that is just as good the next day as leftovers.

This was a fabulous marinade.  The chicken had so much flavor.  My husband went on and on about it.  It was so easy to make, and I had all ingredients on hand.  I did cut the recipe in half because of other reviews, and had plenty of marinade.

Outstanding! I made this with pork and it was one of the best pork marinades I've ever tried. I made only 1/4 of the recipe and it was plenty for 5 steaks. I let them marinate all day (8-9 h) , browned both sides in pan for a few minutes and then followed some of the reviews and baked them at 350F for 40 min or so. Even my little kids loved them because they came out SO moist and tender. Thank you :)

This is a fabulous recipe. I also put the marinade in a ziploc and marinaded it for over a day. WE loved it! When I took the leftovers to work, the entire staff kept coming back to see what I was eating because it smelled that fabulous. Will make again!

We love this marinade!  I use boneless, skinless chicken breasts pounded out to an even thickness.  I halved the recipe, left out the salt, and added minced garlic.  I BBQ the chicken and make more than needed for dinner because it makes wonderful sandwiches the next day!  Be sure to save off a little marinade before adding it to the chicken because it is yummy to drizzle over the cooked chicken and sticky rice (calrose).

This was pretty good. I ran out of propane before I could grill it, so I ended up pan-searing it. It probably would have been better grilled. The marinade gave the chicken more of a beef flavor, so if you're missing beef, then this will probably work for you.

I made the chicken on kabobs with lots of fresh veggies & everyone really liked them.  The chicken seemed to be much more tender than I expected. Next time I'll marinate longer, for more flavor.  We loved the flavor!

Been a chef for 25 years in the Uk and at the top restaurants at that, and this recipe for a chicken marinade is very suculant.
Everyone should try this one at leats once. My hat is off to you sir well done. One thing to everyone that is about to try it don't go over the marinating time, or you will lose the gently suculant balance that this marinade is meant to do 10 Stars **********

All in all, a lovely marinade! I reduced the serving size to 8, and the only thing I changed was using dried parsley instead of fresh. Chicken turned out moist and tender, with a delicious subtle flavor. I think next time I will make extra, and brush it on the chicken as it grills to get that extra kick of flavor! Thanks for sharing this recipe! :)

WOW!! This is the first marindae when my husband DID NOT add additional spices to his chicken. My kids all asked for seconds. I did add some crushed garlic, dried dill, a small amount of Turmeric and Cumin. It is SO delicious! I only allowed the chicken to marinate for 4 hours due to time contraints. Will use over and over again!

This marinade was the first one I've really ever tried, so I don't have anything to compare it with.  It did make very tender BBQ chicken breasts, but I felt it was missing something in the flavour.  I will use it again though, maybe adding a few more spices.

It was 5:03 pm when I remembered that I had chicken in the fridge that I had to use tonight. Between finding the recipe, preparing all of the ingredients, pounding the chicken a little flatter (these were some chubby chicken breasts), it obviously didn't leave a whole lot of marinade-time.  The chicken sat in the sauce for about 20 minutes and even still, it was good - not blow-a-gasket-mind-boggling-good but the potential was definitely there.  With a few hours (or overnight as others suggested) I can really see this marinade seaping into the chicken and tasting super yummy scrumptious.  This is one that I will absolutely make again.

This is excellent and is the only marinade that I use now.  The only adjustment I make is I use more mustard powder.  We like the tanginess of the mustard, so I increase it.  Otherwise this is perfect and the marinade gives the chicken a great color!  Everytime I serve it, I get rave reviews.  Thanks for sharing this!

very good, I added 2 to 3 tbsp of brown sugar and it made the chicken nice and gooey off the grill. Try this on wings after piercing and marinading overnight.

A great marinade. Second attempt i got it right - big tip make sure you give this time to marinade - i did mine for about 10 hours - and the difference was very noticeable. The only thing is that i would agree with a previous reviewer that its (just a tiny bit) sour, but the second time around i added a just a little honey...oh and a little minced fresh garlic. I didn't have the herbs suggested to hand so omitted, and also used ready made mustard as i didn't have any powdered, but still came out ok!! Will use again.

I marinated vegetables (squash, zucchini, red pepper) for about 18 hours before grilling, and they turned out very well! My only complaint is that the recipe is a bit sour, and I would use less lemon juice next time, but overall the grilled veggies got rave reviews from my carnivore friends, which is high praise.

This was a winner at our dinner party last night.  Everyone loved the chicken.  Followed the recipe exactly and baked the chicken covered with foil at 350 degrees for 45 min. then uncovered and baked for 20 minutes.  So moist and full of flavor.  This is a definite keeper.

This is FANTASTIC!  I was looking for a marinade that didn't have to sit too long.  I put my chicken in the mix for an hour before grilling, and it turned out wonderful -- tender and flavorful.  We will keep this one.  My husband said it is "company worthy."  I did leave out the salt because of high bp, and I felt the soy sauce had enough sodium.  I can't wait to cook it again.

I feel bad contradicting everyone and I'm not saying that this wasn't a good recipe, it was nice and it made the chicken very tender...I just felt personally that it lacked the "WOW" factor that I thought it would have.  It was a little bland for my taste.  Good, but not great.

I have used this marinade several times and it never disappoints!  Chicken comes out so tender and flavorful whether baked in the oven covered with foil or grilled out-of-doors.

Used regular mustard in place of dry and apple cider vinegar in place of red wine vinegar because it was what I had on hand. Next time I would definetly use less or even omit salt, and I'm a salt-o-holic. It was delicious. Great with rice.

The barbecue aroma is outstanding while the chicken is grilling, and the way it coats all over the chicken (breasts in this case) gives a great flavor all through the meat.  In addition, the chicken remains extremely moist while grilling, even at high heat.  It's an excellent combination of ingredients which really gives outstanding results.

Used this on pork tenderloins the other night. I poked holes in them and marinated for 3 hours; delicious flavour. I cut the tenderloins into medallions and basted them while barbecuing. It made a lot of marinade, even for what I had. No leftovers, the whole family loved it. Thanks!

Great marinade.  Substituted Braggs liquid aminos instaid of soy sauce. Was only able to marinate for about 20 minutes and it still came out good. Can't wait to marinate overnight. Might even throw in some bay leaf.

I always tweak things a bit, but this was so straightforward that I left it alone!  One change for me, because of high salt content in commercial soy sauce , we use Liquid Aminos all purpose seasoning which I find is a great alternative for soy sauce.  Never use bottled sauces unless ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.  Gail

I'd give this more stars if possible! I use this constantly. I love to marinade thin chicken breasts if I don't  have lots of time,  but have also used it on regular sized  as well as chicken on the bone. My husband always comments how delicious the chicken is, and he's not one to rave about my cooking! The recipe makes a ton, so I keep extra in the fridge. Thanks for the best marinade ever!

Used less Worsteschire sauce, no salt, dried parsley and lime juice instead of lemon juice (that is what I had on hand).  Marinated about 24 hours.

I like vinegar, nothing wrong w/ the multiple benefits of acetic acid. That said...I don't recommend extra. Since I don't always measure, hard to say. Next time I'll reduce it a little maybe...or at least measure eh?

Halved the recipe and left out the salt.  Marinated 5 breasts for about 4 hours, then grilled.  Tender and full of flavor. Will definitely make again!

I have been looking for a new chicken breast marinade.  You may think this is the same as the others, but when you make it to the letter, although I subbed in about 3/4 cup olive oil for the oil, and resisted adding garlic as others said  because what isn't better with garlic.... Completely different flavor.  It was great!  I could sense it as my husband grilled the chicken.  Suggested changes:  cut oil to 3/4 c olive oil and don't leave out fresh parsley ( I grow mine) and dry mustard.  Any prepared mustard is like apples to oranges.

My husband and I loved this chicken! I had 3 ginormous boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut them in half. For the marinade I used 1 cup olive oil, low sodium soy sauce and low sodium Worcestershire sauce. Added the recipe amount for the red wine vinegar and lemon juice. I didn't have any dry mustard so I used 2 TBS of regular yellow mustard, no salt and no parsley. I also added a heaping TBS of minced garlic. I let the chicken marinade in a large ziplock bag in the fridge for 6 hours. Put the chicken breasts on my stove grill top and grilled them on high for about 5 mins each side and then turned it down to medium heat and grilled them for about 8 mins more on each side. (Just make sure the juices run clear) They were tender, juicy and delicious! Made a side of garlic quinoa (recipe on this site) and a side salad! All very yummy!! Thanks for the recipe!

My husband absolutely loved this -- and he doesn't really get excited over marinades.  Was raving about how we should use it on pork.  The recipe is WAAAYY too much, but what I love about All Recipes is that you can change the serving sizes!!!!!

This recipe is so easy, and delicious. I used chicken thighs, and marinated them for 3 hours. They were so good.  Next time I will marinate for 2+days!

Very salty recipe but it was good.  I don't think there is a reason to add more salt after having soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce in the ingredient list.

This recipe was amazing! I tried it for the first time. I mean the first time that I have EVER marinated anything from scratch and it turned out wonderfully. I let it marinate over night and it was a hit with my family. A must try and so easy. Thank you!

I made this recipe last night, followed the directions EXACTLY AS WRITTEN. I didn't pay attention to how much it yielded and that was my mistake, it makes enough to do  AT LEAST 10 boneless skinless chicken breasts (big ones) I accidentally put 5 pieces in and have a load let over. I did read reviews first and took notes but missed the part of "it makes alot". First of all I need to say that the smell it made while cooking wasn't appealing to any of the 4 of us, but with that said I must admit this marinade is absolutely fantastic. I think the smell cooking was too vinegary but once the chicken was done the taste was nowhere near vinegary. It was absolutely delicious! Everyone would be happy to eat it again, they just don't want to be home when I am cooking it, lol I kind of don't want to be either. Noone complained it was salty, I am a salt freak, didn't add any to my plate tho, hubby complains if stuff is salty and he didn't. I am glad to be able to make this, save loads on store bought stuff that is virtually good forever because of the  they stick in it (and trust me, I am not a health freak, just getting grossed out as I get older for what I believe is "food" I am eating. All natural ingredients = fantastic marinade! thanks for the recipe!!!

Absolutely fantastic marinade! THANKS JillyPooh! I've made this before written as is and it was PERFECT. Today I needed chicken for Pancit Bihon (on this site: Quick and Easy Pancit) so I modified this marinade accordingly to get a more Asian flavor. I used canola oil with a few dashes of seasoned sesame oil, added garlic, green onions and mixed soy sauce with calamansi juice (toyomansi).  I mistakenly dropped in caraway seeds because I reached for the wrong jar. But it didn't ruin it. I used this to marinate boneless skinless chicken thighs for four hours in the fridge. The chicken turned out fantastic with the Pancit Bihon. This marinade is so versatile it works for any kind of meat! THANKS AGAIN! >:)

I have tried this recipe several times and I love it. This last go around, I omitted the salt since the soy sauce has enough sodium. I added half of a jalepeno pepper for a little kick and actually you don't even know its there. I added some cilantro instead of the parsley because I love cilantro. I added two table spoons of brown sugar to balance it out and I poured all of it into my Ninja and blended it. I had a hard time mixing the oil the first time I made it so this was my solution and it is perfect. Everything stays together and the oil doesn't separate. 24 hours in the fridge and back slaps on grill day.

Marinated the chicken for about five hours and helped the chicken retain its moisture.  After grilling the chicken breasts for 25 minutes they were perfect.  I added abit more mustard powder by accident, but still turned out great.  I will definitely be making this again.  Complimented the chicken with the Dole BBQ Ranch mixed salad mix to this and some side basmati and it made a perfect supper!  Thanks for submitting.

Wow, this really was a good reicpe. In fact, fixing again this weekend. The longer you marinade the better. We plan to throw the 1/2 frozen thighs in tonight to serve on Sat (using frozen like this really doesn't hurt this). We use the boneless/skinless chicken thighs from Costco (5 per pack). This recipe actually makes enough to double the pack. If you are using less than 5, hightly recommend you cut recipe in 1/2. Here are the alterations we made: to prevent the saltiness- we used low sodium soy sauce and omitted the salt (you get a lot of sodium in the worchestshire sauce). Excellent recipe once we modified for ourselves! Highly recommend......Walt & Lloydine Morgan, Woodstock, VA

Turned the chicken an awful, unappetizing color for one.  Marinated for 6 hours.  Did NOT tenderize the chicken and imparted very little flavor.

I made the recipe in the measurements stated, but had to make a few substitutions, Balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, prepared mustard instead of dry mustard, and thyme instead of parsley (gave it a little more savory flavor).  I also added chopped garlic, 2 tsp.  I ended up letting it marinate for 3 days, due to change in dinner plans, and boy, was this ever good!!! I cooked it on the grill for approximately 12 minutes, total, using skin on chicken thighs.  It was heavenly to smell while it cooked, I couldn't wait to try it!  This is now my standard marinade for grilling chicken, although I'm sure it would be wonderful cooked on the stove or baked. I am finishing the leftover piece today, as I write...  This is a "Must Try" recipe.

I used only 1 cup of oil and it was still too much in my opinion, and hardly any salt.  I put chicken legs in the marinade overnight and baked them in the marinade, too.  They turned out very moist and flavorful.

This is most definitely our go to marinade for chicken. Love it! I do not add salt, however, as there is plenty in some of the other ingredients. Also, I scale down on all of the ingredients including only using 1/2 cup canola oil instead of the 1 1/2 cups vegetable oil. That's probably because we normally only marinade 2-4 large boneless, skinless breasts. Thanks Jillypooh, for this great recipe!

Makes a ton, so I scaled back to 8 servings, followed the recipe until red wine vinegar. I only had apple cider vinegar, which actually sounded better.  It felt a tad salty to me, so I threw in about 1/4 cup of organic dark brown sugar.  It was the PERFECT addition.  Added some nice carmelization when grilled.

Not good at all. I followed the directions exactly. So this review is solely based off of this recipe. Not this recipe plus whatever I decided to add. Which makes it no longer this recipe but someone else's.

I actually used all of the marinade at once since it was for a bbq and it's absolutely delicious, everyone loved it. I mixed some of it with italian dressing but it wasn't needed (although still delicious).

I hardly ever do reviews, but thought this was so wonderful!!  I scaled it down to half for 5 pcs. of boneless chicken and could of probably made it even smaller.  This by far is the best tasting marinade for chicken!  My whole family loved it!  I will definitely be making this in the future!!!!

I was hoping to like it and it smelled great but was too salty.  I used low sodium soy sauce and less salt than recipe called for and still too much.  I made about 1 1/2 pounds of chicken breast and halved the recipe like other reviews said to.  It made plenty for that amount of chicken.

Very nice.  It does make loads of marinade, so I decided to make all the marinade and marinate some veggies as well--I marinated chicken breasts (separately, of course), bell pepper strips, and broccoli stalks overnight.  Hubs grilled the chicken and I roasted the veggies in the oven.  Served it all at a barbecue with family and they LOVED it, chicken and veggies.  I sent home the leftovers with the sister in law, she loved it so much.  I did leave out the salt since we have people watching their sodium--I thought it was plenty salty anyway.  Really easy, and tasted kind of like teriyaki to me.  We all enjoyed it.

Used the recipe adjustment calculator on website to make enough for 3 chicken breasts. Marinated for 6 hrs. I didn't notice that the chicken had much, if any flavor.

Thanks for posting this marinade recipe.  I'm definitely not a chicken lover, but this marinade made it delicious!  It really didn't taste like chicken and it was incredibly tender.  Didn't have parsley, so I substituted cilantro.  It was great, and the leftovers were perfect in a Chicken Ceasar Salad the next day.

YUM!  So moist and a lot of flavor!  NOTE This make a lot of marinade! We should have cut in half as we had a lot left over.  Make sure to marinade for at least 12 hours for full effect.  We also baked on 375 for 30 minutes covered in foil and 15 uncovered. Really delicious!

This marinade was delicious!  I made extra and used it on chicken the first time and pork loin the second.  Left it marinading in the refridge for the entire day until dinner.  Didn't change a thing - Yum!

The marinade was a wee bit on the bland side and FAR too oily. With more seasoning and less oil, I might try it again, but definitely not as written. Sorry.

I made this marinade for grilled chicken. I used boneless/skinless breasts & thighs. I marinated the meat for 7 hours. The flavor of this marinade was fabulous! Everyone at our Easter lunch was raving, and I got numerous requests for the recipe. Definitely a keeper!

Loved it, you bet! With so many positive reviews, I figured I couldn't go wrong, and I wasn't disappointed! I changed the serving quantity to 8 from 32 and did everything else as was called for (using olive oil), though I did leave out the salt, as some suggested. I marinated three chicken breasts, cut into smaller pieces for kabobs, for close to 6 hours, reserving 1/4 cup for basting on the grill. We brushed it on the veggie skewers too, and everything was delicious. The chicken was remarkably tender. I served this with hazelnut-mushroom pilaf, also on this site. Absolutely fabulous, and it made three generous servings. Definitely a keeper!

I did enjoy this recipe for the most part. However, next time I think I will leave out the lemon juice as I found the red wine vinegar flavour was masked and I all I could taste was lemon.

Positively wonderful. We eat a lot of chicken and this recipe makes a very flavorful meal.  I ended up using the full recipe to the detail but ended up adding twice the amount of chicken because there was SO MUCH marinade. My family all loved it! So no complaints from them equals no complaints from me! Plus the chicken was great as an addition to my salad the next day.

Just tried this and can't get over how flavorful this makes boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  And it keeps the meat moist for a perfect BBQ presentation.

This is a great marinade for boneless chicken thighs.  Brushed it with barbecue sauce the last few minutes.  Chicken was tender and juicy.

I have made minor tweaks based on what I am making chicken for and all have been good, I add barbeque sauce, and serve with corn on cob and baked beans, or I add teriyaki and serve on a bed of wild rice with broccoli and my children devour it either way.

Yummmmm! I followed the recipe except I boiled the used marinade and poured it over the chicken after grilling. This is a new favorite for my family.

I've made this a few times for guests and everyone loves it. Lots of flavor and you don't have to worry about over marinating. This is now my "go to" marinade.

This marinade is GREAT!  We followed the recipe exactly and it made a lot. We had 5 lbs of chicken tenders marinating and there was enough marinade for at least another 3 lbs of chicken.

This is not a bad recipe by any means, I am just really surprised that it got such high marks.  All of the ingredients seemed to be overpowered by the soy sauce.  I love salty foods, but this was too salty even for me.  I only let it marinate for 3 hours, and I did end up with too much marinade.

Wonderful...but need to leave out the salt...soy sauce and Worcestershire supply enough of that.  I only used 1/3 of the salt it called for and it was still a little too salty.   However, my family said it was the best chicken I'd ever made.  I marinaded it starting at 10am and cooked it at 5pm.  Super moist and flavorful.

I made this today, Fourth of July for our bbq.  I let the peices of chicken breast strips in the marinade overnight and skewered them.  Made recipe exactly as shown and it was wonderful.  My only regret was that I dumped the leftover marinade and should have boiled it for 5 minutes and added a little cornstarch to make a sauce for drizzling.  Will definitely make again and make the sauce too.

We enjoyed this recipe.  It was a very simple, flavorful "grilled" taste.  No "one" flavor stood out.  Ver easy to put together and I used bs chicken breasts.

This was an amazing recipe!  I used this for 6 boneless chicken breast and used the 8 serving one and there was just enough marinade for all of them!!!  They turned out great!! Wish I would've marinated a little bit longer though!!!

Amazing!!! My bf loved this! Something I will continue to use & try with different meats. I didn't have dry mustard so I substituted it with yellow mustard (make sure if you do - triple the amount) YUMMY!!!!

Oh maw gosh this is soooo good!  I did leave the chicken breasts in the marinade for over 24 hours then we grilled.  The chicken had so much flavor it didn't need any kind of additional sauce.  This recipe as/is does make a lot but it does hold well so I suggest using half and saving half.  This is great for almost any kind of meat and possibly fish.  I may try this on fish next!  Yummy!

This is an awesome marinade! I will use it from now on, and will try pork and steak the next times.  Made a few changes though: olive oil instead of vegetable oil, the juice of one orange in place of the lemon juice, teriyaki sauce (i didn't have worcestershire), a clove of garlic minced, and a teaspoon each ground ginger and crushed red pepper flakes. Next time I'll use a few less red pepper flakes as I overdid the heat juuuuust a bit, but the taste was great!

My husband and i recently started the Paleo diet.  This marinade is perfect, and helps us feel like we are getting away with something.  Very tasty!  We do substitute Canola for vegetable oil.

The chicken tasted very good.  It was especially nice that all the ingredients used I already had on hand.  The chicken marinaded while I was at work for approximately 11 hours. I was afraid that the seasonings might be too strong and potent after having set for so long, but not at all.  We grilled the chicken breasts on the barbecue and it came out so tender.  The marinade was great.  Will definitely use again.

The best marinade EVER! I only used 1-1/4 cups of canola oil and just under 1/2 cup of soy sauce (because it's all I had). I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger and I let the boneless, skinless chicken thighs marinate about 7 hours. My picky family literally inhaled dinner tonight! I'll definitely be making this again!

Really good!  I wouldn't call it a "barbecue sauce", but just a marinade for the barbecue.

Best marinade ever.  I use it often and have shared the recipe with lots of friends.  I leave out the salt, but other than that, it is perfect! Make a double batch, you will love it!

Very good.  My husband admitted to adding the remainder of the steak seasoning to the chicken before cooking it.  The end result was too salty, but I can't be sure that it wasn't his fault ;)

A tasty, easy marinade. Put chicken breasts and marinade in a zip lock bag, threw it in the cooler and took to the cabin for a BBQ. Turned out perfect!

I made this the other day and perhaps it needs more time to marinate, but I thought it was just okay. Nothing special. I have a few other marinade's I like better. It makes a ton, so I saved the rest and will try again.

This is my go-to chicken marinade recipe! I haven't found another that I like better. I use it regularly for shish kebabs. Half the recipe is plenty for my chicken and vegetables for a family of four. Yummy!

I've grilled chicken breasts with this marinade twice in as many weeks.  I usually marinade overnight and grill the next afternoon.  Yesterday, I sliced the finished grilled chicken up to use for fajitas. Delicious!

Delicious! I substituted cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar and made half the recipe for 4 chicken breasts. It was enough. Marinated for 2 hours. Husband loved it and my 3 year-old and 1 year-old both had seconds. It's a hit.

This stuff is unbelievable!  We marinated chicken breasts for about 30 hours in the refrigerator.  We had people over for a barbecue and they were raving about the chicken.  It is tender and moist.  I will not use any marinade other than this one for chicken!

We liked this marinade, but it didn't give a load of flavor (I let it marinate about 8 hours). I will try adding some garlic next time.

Spectacular!  Exchanged EVOO for the veg oil.  Cut soy to 1/3 cup.  Dried garlic for parsley.  Savory and mildly sweet chick breasts that everyone enjoyed.

I used this recipe for a dinner party last night and it was a HIT!! I added: Minced Garlic, Oyster Sauce & Thai Sweet Chili Sauce to give this excellent marinate even more kick and body.

I used this marinade on thick cut pork chops and it was amazing.  I did cut the soy sauce back to 1/2 cup for personal taste.  I didn't have red wine vinegar.  I used regular vinegar and a little red wine :)

I have made this marinade with and without the salt and prefer it without. It is just me and my husband, so I scale it to 8 servings. I put 2 boneless chicken breasts in a gallon ziplock bag, pour the amount of marinade I need, then refrigerate the rest since we eat chicken at least once a week. I have marinated this for 4 hours and have also had to let it marinate overnight because we got home too late to cook and it was great either way. I know the lemon can cook the chicken, but I have never had a problem with this. I have also used lime in place of the lemon, and found the lemon makes the flavor stronger, so I prefer lime. When I review a recipe, I make it as written the first time, then adjust to suit my taste. This recipe is 5 stars as written. The marinade makes my boneless skinless breasts very juicy,which I often find dry.

This recipe was great :DD! I was completely skeptical about this recipe because of all the salty and acidic ingredients and the amounts! But it turned out really good. I used it on chicken breast and it made them very tender (as acidic things should.)    Only thing was is that I used low sodium soy sauce (because that's the only thing I had), regular mustard since I didn't have any dry mustard and probably a 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce because I ran out ._.  But it still came out ^_^ Also, I added about half a teaspoon of salt less than what it said since I thought it you be salty and I added extra pepper, parseley and garlic =D! Came out great! Definitely recommend it!

Fantastic marinade. I was leary about the quantity of cooking oil, so used about 75% of what was called for and it came out great. Marinated for 3 hours then grilled the chicken breast...supurb.

This is a great marinade however these people that use skinless chicken breasts are missing it.  Use legs and thighs with skin.  God put skin on chicken for a reason.  Its wonderful.

Amazing Marinade!!! Just finished eating chicken breast (cut kabob style) that was marinaded in this (cut servings down to 4 for 3 large chicken breast) sauce. Thought I had red wine vinegar, already dumped most of the ingredients, so just used apple cider vinegar. Stuck with everything else in the recipe. Fabulous! I think I might add a bit of spicy pepper to kick it up a bit. Still, YUM!

I originally gave this only 3 stars then decided to try it again, changing 2 things.  First,  I pierced each piece of chicken multiple times with a fork to allow the marinade to work its way into the meat.  Second, I allowed the chicken to marinade for 2 days, turning each piece over after 24 hours.  What a difference!  It was full of flavor and produced the most tender chicken I ever served.

We just survived Hurricane Earl on the South Shore of Nova Scotia (where it made landfall) and I needed a quick meal to grill. This fit the bill and was easy to make with ingredients we had on hand (even better, it was tasty). I made 1/4 of the recipe amount and didn't add the parsley - that was one thing I didn't have. Thanks for a stellar recipe which will now be known as Earl's Chicken in my house.

This marinade is delicious!! Made into chicken kabobs with veggies and it was a huge hit! The only two changes I made was cutting the oil down to 1 cup and added three cloves of garlic. This makes a TON of marinade so you can easily cut it in half for up to 8 chicken breasts.

Really easy and tasty. I omitted the salt and marinated the boneless, skinless chicken thighs for 1 hour (so the meat wouldn't become tough from the acidic marinade).

Used this yesterday and it was outstanding.  I find most marinades don't add a lot of flavor but this one does.  But not too strong.  Perfect taste and very tender chicken after marinating for 4 hours.

Yum! Little salty. Next time, less soy and more red wine vinegar. Used skewered bits of chicken breast, marinated chicken before skewering for 3 hours in fridge.

3 hours before my bbq I was desperate for a marinade for chicken breast and I stumbled upon this recipe.  Whipped it up and prayed it was "as advertised".  This chicken ended up being the "best thing on the menu"!  I did not try it until the 3rd person commented on how good it was.  I used what I had on hand:  apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, dried parsley flakes instead of fresh, canola instead of vegetable oil, and a tsp of regular mustard instead of dry.  Also, I didn't add (and didn't need) salt.  It was absolutely delish fresh off the grill!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent marinade.  The combination of sauces, vinegar, lemon juice and dry mustard are a perfect combination.  I was skeptical at first because I thought this marinade would be too bitter.  But when I cooked it with the chicken, I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only did it have great flavor, but it was juicy.  I used canola oil and dried parsley and added chopped dried onions and garlic powder.  I also used a 2 1/2 pound bag of frozen chicken breasts and placed half of the marinade in with the raw chicken and kept the other half for basting the chicken while grilling.  The quantity of ingredients in this recipe worked very well for me.  I'm definitely going to make this marinade again.

This stuff is THE best marinade I have come across.  We soaked the chicken for 5 hours, then dipped in eggs & rolled in italian bread crumbs.  We have had it 4 times in the last 2 weeks!  YUMMY!

This is yummy!   I cut the recipe in half and used it for chicken breasts and legs.  We ate them at a picnic and everyone enjoyed the flavor.  I felt the marinade gave the chicken plenty of flavor.  It is nice change from bbq sauce.

I cut this down to 8 servings and it was plenty to cover 6 nice size chicken thighs.  I let marinate about 7 hours and it tasted perfect!  It grilled up so nicely on my charcoal grill.  I will certainly be using this marinade in the future!  Thank you Jillypooh!

Seriously, the best marinade I've ever made!  I cut the recipe down to only 8 servings because the original recipe makes a lot!!  I've used the marinade for as short as 2 hours and as long as 24 hours...the chicken is delicious either way, no matter how long it's been marinating!  Definitely a keeper!

I was skeptical, but WOW -- this was great!  Cut down the oil to 3/4 c and used dried parsley.  More than enough marinade for 1 1/2 pounds of chicken and 14 oz of tofu.  Best tofu marinade I have tried so far and the meat eaters raved on the chicken.  Thanks for a great recipe!

except for omitting the salt, I followed the recipe exactly  -  marinated chicken breasts 7-8 hours; baked in marinade in a covered casserole for 20 minutes at 400*; removed cover & reduced heat; added little red wine to marinade in baking dish, baked until chicken reached 160*; removed from over; covered loosely, allowing rest period  -  perfectly done  -  moist, juicy, flavorful  -  great combination  -  thank you.

This recipe doesn't look fancy, but the taste is fancy. It tasted like something from a nice steak house. Like everyone said, it was tender and juicy and the chicken didn't need any sauce as the flavor was great all on it's own.  Can't wait to have this for company.

This was fantastic!!!  Unlike any marinade/sauce I've ever made.  I marinaded chicken breasts in it for about 3 hours, then cooked them on the grill.  The chicken was delicious.  I then heated the leftover marinade until boiling, simmered for a few minutes, then added a little cornstarch/water to thicken it.  That was my favorite part- the sauce I could dip the chicken in!  I loved it.  I only made 1/4 of the recipe, because that's the amount I had on-hand.  It was perfect for 1 pound of chicken.

This marinade is DEELISH!!!  I have made it about 4 times in the past couple of weeks and it makes the chicken so juicy and tender, with great flavor.  This is now our go-to marinade.  We are using it today for our 4th of July Chicken cookout.  Can't Wait!!!

This was amazing! I used boneless skinless thighs and halved the recipe since it was only my husband and I home tonight and had way more than enough for the four thighs we cooked up. The only thing I will do differently next time is make MORE chicken! :-)

This is the best chicken marinade! I made this last minute so I cut my chicken into cubes for skewers and marinated for an hour.  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I substituted Balsamic vinegar. I cut the recipe in half for 4 chicken breasts and it was plenty of sauce. Super easy to prepare and I got rave reviews!

Love it, I use Italian dressing instead of oil and vineager.  Love to bake chicken thighs in the marinade and  then  thicken it with cornstarch for a great sauce.

Reading all the rave reviews I was surprised at how bland this marinade was.  The only flavor on the chicken is a bit of soy otherwise there is no zip / zest to it.  And BTW, I was concerned in mixing the ingredients that the soy would be too strong.  That was not the case at all ... it was well balanced.

My whole family enjoyed this chicken!  I reduced servings to about 15(?) and had more than enough for 5# of boneless skinless chicken breast.  My husband said "Make this again!!"  It grilled up beautifully!

Edit:  The leftovers of this chicken are PERFECT for fried rice!

My "no read meat" aunt and uncle visited from out of town and I wanted to make something good we could grill. It was a hit! I used small pieces of chicken (chicken tenderloins) and marinated overnight. The flavor was bold but not too salty. I ate the chicken the next day cold from the fridge and it was good cold too!   My mom thought it was too "vinegary" so someone who does not like tangy vinegar flavor may not like this marinade.

This was a great recipe!  I marinated my chicken for six hours and it turned out great.  My children who are 18 and 20 said that it was the best chicken that I have ever made. :)  Little do they know it was super simple.  Thanks very much!!

My family didn't care for the flavor of the marinade very much.  It didn't taste bad, but it didn't really taste good either.  Although, I must say that I used it for grilled boneless, skinless chicken breasts and they came out extremely tender.  We used dipping sauces with it and it was fine.  I just didn't care for the taste alone.

This was just OK for me.  I didn't care for the soy/worcestershire combination and luckily I added some crushed garlic - otherwise there wouldn't have been alot of taste.  I also added some sesame seed, thin sliced green onions and a bit of cilantro the second time I made it.. and it still had an odd flavor.. and it was very salty even though I used low sodium soy sauce.  Sorry, I really wanted to love it as I appreciate a good chicken marinade, but will stick with my own teriyaki from now on.

A solidly delicious marinade! I cut the recipe to 10 servings; two tablespoons lite soy sauce and two tablespoons teriyaki; dried parsley because I was too lazy to chop fresh; and used olive oil, just a bit to help mix everything together. I left it vacuumed in my instant marinater for about two hours and grilled on my Foreman. Leftovers will be great in a chicken salad! A definite keeper.

Yummy, just the way it is!  I ate this chicken leftover, cold, for a few days and it was still delish!!!  I used the automatic calculator to make it only 8 servings and there was still plenty of marinade for 4 big breasts.

Wow, real good, I cut it in half and made with boneless breasts. Cooked on my charcoal grill not my gas grill, I think that helped the flavor. Next time I have people over I think I'll slice the boneless breasts into fingers, marinade them and cook them like that. Will make again for sure. Great summer recipe.

This is my husband's rating..the chicken breasts were almost tasteless. I'll stick with my brine and buttermilk.

It does make a lot but I bought chicken thighs in bulk. 10 thighs and 1 cup marinade in a medium freezer bag. Take them out of the freezer the morning you want to cook them and defrost in the microwave for 20 minutes. Store in the fridge for the rest of the day. Your meat is marinated and ready to cook at suppertime. Outstanding!...but I did make the marinade my own by subst. 1 cup of homemade Italian Dressing & 1/2 cup of oil for the 1.5 cups of oil. Also left out the additional salt.

This was a very easy, but yet delicious recipe chicken marinade.  Both my fiance and I enjoyed it greatly, and have already made plans to make it again. Thanks for sharing!

I used just 3/4 cup olive oil, that's all I had, but don't think I'd use the full 1-1/2 cups if I had had it - just sounds like TOO much.  Used garlic flavored red wine vinegar and dry parsley - had no fresh. It was lovely, moist and delicious - will make again!

I thought this was boring.  I marinaded chicken breasts for several hours, then grilled them.  You would never have guessed that they were marinaded.  Maybe with some of the alteratiions suggested this could be better.

This marinade was good, easy, AND inexpensive!   Just as Jillypooh said, they are ingredients most people have on hand.  I did change the serving size to 8, and it was just about perfect for six boneless chicken breasts that I cut in half for quicker grilling time.  I will definitely be using this marinade again.  Oh, and I did marinate overnight.

Everyone seemed to like it but me. It was also a new group to entertain so they could of been just saying it to be nice haha. I thought it was a little to strong for my taste. You couldn't barely even taste the chicken. Only changes I did was use low sodium soy sauce and omitted the salt, and used dried parsley flakes instead of fresh. No need to measure the dried mustard; I measured it and it was exactly the whole .45 oz thing. I used 4 chicken breast halves, but could of easily fit 6 or 7 even. I marinated them in the smaller mixing bowl from my stand mixer and covered it with seran wrap in the fridge for exactly 1 day. Give it a try!

I cut the recipe in half and still had more than enough.  Next time, I'd probably make the directed amount and then freeze a portion for another use.  At any rate, I would give this recipe five stars for tenderness - I marinated the chicken breasts for about four hours before grilling, and they were super-moist!  The flavor, however, was just OK for my family.

We really enjoyed this marinade.  I really loved how it smelled and the skin had a nice shine to it.  The chicken had a nice flavor and though we had BBQ sauce on hand, we really didn't use much of it.  This marinade stood nicely on its own.  Can't wait to have it for lunch today. Thanks JILLYPOOH

Fantastic marinade!!  It will make any home cook look like a professional chef! You will not be disappointed.  You'll get so many raves, you'll need a bigger chef's hat!   (btw, you can sub balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar, its  really tasty that way. Your chicken , beef or pork will practically stand up and take a bow for you!)

This is so good! I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours then baked it. Instead of vegetable oil I used coconut and olive oil since those are much healthier. The marinade certainly does not need any more salt, the soy sauce takes care of that. The chicken came out tender, juicy, and full of savory flavor! If you don't have any dried mustard on hand regular will work fine.

Tried this last night with a cheaper cut of beef steak. I let it marinate 8 hours in the refrigerator, used the charcoal grill and it turned out WONDERFUL.  I did leave out the parsley and cut the oil to 1 cup.  The family raved.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good marinade. I thought it would taste too much like soy sauce- but it didn't- a nice blend of all the flavors. Only change I made was cut the recipe in half- and it still made more than enough to marinate 4 chicken breasts. Perfect for the grill- we are going to try it with beef next!

This is a great marinade for summer grilling.  It has a nice mix of flavor with the Worcestershire sauce and makes for moist chicken in 20 minutes.  It goes with just about all side dishes, from potato salads and grilled vegetables to risotto or baked potatoes.  The family loved it!

I omitted the parsley as we don't like it, and I used prepared English mustard. Marinated the chicken breasts for about 12 hours, and cooked them on the Foreman grill. They turned out very moist, and there was quite a lot of flavor. Still, if I were to make this again, I would add a little freshly-minced garlic to the marinade. Nice recipe. Thanks!

Tried this marinade with chicken for dinner and my husband said it was the best he has had.  I marinated the chicken for five hours and the flavor was sensational.  Next time I might try marinating overnight.  Had the best flavor and will definitely use this again.

This is really good. Didn't have to change a thing. I let mine marinade about 24 hours. My family and I LOVED it.  Thanks so much!

I only marinaded my chicken for 2 and a half hours, and it was yummy, but it did seam a little salty for my taste.  Perhaps next time I would omit the salt and cut down a little on the soy.

This was really good.  I used it on steak tonight.  I cut the recipe in half and used 1/2 cup italian dressing and 1/4 cup oil instead of all oil.  I added 1 tsp of brown sugar and omitted the dry mustard as I didn't have it.  I also used dried parsley.  I'll be using it on chicken later in the week! Thanks! EDIT: I used this on chicken last night and it was just as good!  It's been put in my recipe book.

This is the best chicken marinade recipe I've tried. I only marinated about 1 hour and the chicken was moist and the flavor is great. Can't wait to make this again when I have more time to marinate the chicken.

My husband seems to like it, I don't eat meat so it is hard for me to judge, but it looks and smells great. I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

This makes a lot, so I usually mix up a batch, pour what I need over chicken breasts in a large Ziploc bag, and then keep the rest in a bottle in the fridge for next time.  I rarely use fresh parsley.  A favorite at our house.

Unbelieveable!  I didn't have time to marinate the chicken long before we bbq'd, but it was still fantastic.  I did not add the extra salt; it was salty enough on its own (and I'm a big saltaholic).  I'm not sure I'll even share this one with anyone; I want to keep it all for myself!

Because others had said this made a large batch of marinade, I cut the portions in half - used olive oil and didn't have red wine vinegar so substituted white vinegar. Didn't have fresh parsley so used dried. It was fantastic - the chicken was so tender only after a couple hours of marinating.

Excellent marinade!  Marinated chicken breasts for about 7 hours and then cooked them on a grill.  Unbelievably flavorful and juicy.  Wouldn't change a thing.

I made this exactly as directed except I cut back on the vegetable oil a bit to make it less fattening.  This was pretty good but came out very sweet, which limits your options for using leftovers in other recipes.  I have some marinade left over that I will use for something else (I'm thinking it would be better with salmon?) but probably will try other marinade recipes before making this again.

Wow, I didn't think a marinade would be that good but this completely changed my boring chicken and rice dish.  I changed the servings to 2 since I was just making one chicken breast, cut it up in pieces and marinated for about an hour and then stir fried in a little canola oil and it really made the chicken stand out.  I will definitely make this again.

I have made this twice now and both times it turned out great! I cut down the lemon juice, vinegar, and mustard because my husband doesn't really like those things. He loved it and never noticed that it had those three ingredients in it! I made chicken sandwhiches with this, add a little bit of ranch dressing, cheese slices and tomatoes...its great!

Excellent!  This one is a keeper.  I followed the recipe exactly and our chicken was so good!  Next time, I will omit the extra salt because I think the soy sauce has plenty.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Sorry, the family was not crazy about this recipe. They ate it but said they would not eat it again. I don't like that soy taste and I even used light soy sauce and ommitted the salt.

This was absolutely, hands down, the best chicken that I have ever grilled!  The ONLY change that I made (but it was a critical one, I believe) was to use balsamic instead of red wine vinegar.  Everything else, I kept the same.  My chicken was a beautiful caramel color, smelled wonderful while cooking, and tasted amazing!  I will say, though, that I'm an idiot and didn't look at the serving size and this made WAY too much marinade.  I had six HUGE chicken breasts and this was entirely too much for them, so I would scale it back by at least half.  I served with Herbed New Potatoes from this site, a green salad with homemade Italian dressing, and Easy Peach Cobbler (also from this site) for dessert.  We had a great meal!

This was awesome!  I was a little concerned because all of the different flavors going on, but it was great.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine and also added some cumin and garlic.  Very good chicken with a unique flavor.

This is the BEST marinade I have ever made! (And I have made many!!!) I used it on chicken tenders which my husband grilled. Excellent flavor and tender, juicy meat! Next time I may add some minced garlic. Not that the recipe needs anything added to it, I just love the garlic flavor in a marinade!

The chicken was marinaded over night. It was full of flavor, but for us it tasted too much like vinegar, and mustard. We purchased some mini premade pizzas and I put Bull's Eye Sweet and Sticky BBQ sauce, then cut up the chicken, sliced a button mushroom, and added marble cheddar cheese. It was great on my version of a BBQ Chicken Pizza.

I can't give it 5 stars because this is my first marinade recipe, but I LOVE it. I continually use this as a "starting place" and modify it. Instead of Worcestershire sauce, I use Yoshida's Original Gourmet Sauce. I have also used lime juice instead of lemon (zingy!) and dried Japanese horseradish rather than mustard. In addition to dried parsley, I have also added basil and thyme. And it's not just for chicken! Worked GREAT with pork cutlets! Thanks for this one!

I scaled the recipe in half, since full recipe makes quite of bit of marinade.  I scaled back the oil and used 1/4 cup vegetable and 1/4 cup olive.  I marinated for about 4 hours.  Nice to not run out to the grocery store, since I had all ingredients on hand.

Marinated overnight just as written. Very tasty. Used boneless skinless breasts...next time I'll pound them thin before marinating and I think it will be even better.

This marinade was excellent!!! I used whole skinless, bonless breast and pounded them out to 1/4 thick. I am always afraid of white meat drying out but not a concern here. The meat was moist and very flavorful. Cooked on a very hot grill for no longer than 3 mins per side. Excellent color and charcol taste. The mustard is a background flavor and it took awile for the family to guess it. Good Stuff

I used this on chicken; marinated for about 30 minutes and used my George Foreman grill. Pretty good but I needed some type of sauce for dipping. So I found a honey mustard sauce from this site and it was WONDERFUL. Will do again!

This is a really good and easy marinade to make.  We let our chicken marinade about 7 hours and grilled it and it was very good.  Used lime juice and lemon juice both and it gave it a good citrus taste and we topped it with homemade black bean salsa and it was delicious!

Worked like a charm. Best marinate I've tried off of All Recipes for Chicken. Flavourful, moist and everything I could have asked for in a marinade.
Made as directed, seared the chicken in a skillet at high heat until dark brown on the sides and finished in the oven.

This was good, but not great.  Surprisingly it was not all that flavorful.  We enjoyed it, but there are simpler recipes that we like better.

I actually let this marinate for about 2 days, so of course I thought it was wonderful and easy...will do it again soon.

This was probably one of the best marinades we've ever tried. I used this on boneless chicken breasts and my husband grilled these over mesquite charcoal for some of the best grilled chicken ever! I ran out of lemon juice and only had half of what it called for so I used about 1 1/2 T of lemon pepper instead of regular pepper. Very nice flavor, many thanks for sharing your Dad's special recipe!

This chicken came out very flavorful, but I expected it to be more moist than it actually was... not that it was dry.  It marinated for approximately 5 hours.... next time I might try longer.  It was also very easy and inexpensive to throw this together.  Next time I might add honey to the marinade.  We served this chicken with grilled corn on the cob, asian style cole slaw, macaroni and cheese (for the  kids) and garlic dinner rolls.

Excellent!  My first time with a homemade marinade and I didn't change a thing from the recipe.  Used this on chicken and it was very tender and moist!  Marinaded for about 8 hours.  I am going to try it again with some pork chops!

This was so good, just make sure you realize this recipe is scaled to make more than 30 servings!  I made the whole recipe and had enough for 9 chicken breasts, with some left over! I just put the leftover marinade in a jar, and will use it within a few days of making it.  It was very tasty, though.

My husband and my mom said it was a 5 star and my dad said it was worth 10 stars. This is an easy marinade and really excellent flavour. I added some fresh garlic too it but that was the only thing I did different. So good on the grill. Thanks Jill!

This marinade is great.  I was out of red wine vinegar so used white wine vinegar.  I used chicken tenders and let them marinate for approximately 2 hours.  They were so good.  Had enough marinade left to do two steaks and some onion and peppers that I stir fried.  I couldn't believe how tender the steaks were.  Thank You!

I would give this more than 5 stars if I could.  I made it exactly as written and it produced the best grilled chicken we have ever eaten.  Flavorfull and moist.  Everyone ate 2 pieces (which never happens).  This will be my chicken marinade from now on.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

My family loves this marinade!  I have been using this for a long time.  I can't bring myself to try any other marinade, because this is just so good. For convenience I use dried parsley and bottled lemon juice and it turns out great.

I loved it! My husband liked it, he's very picky. I only used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil and marinated it for two hours. Next time I will do it over night. It was very easy and I had everything on hand. I cooked this on my George foreman grill, it never gets used! It turned out great!

Great marinade! My husband (who is a very picky eater) loves this recipe.  I added two cloves of minced garlic and it tastes even better!!!! Only thing is that this recipe makes a large  amount.

Served this twice now, and both times I got rave reviews, even from my nit picky 4 year old who has, until now, refused anything off the BBQ. Moist, flavorful, and just the right amount of zing, this recipe is a keeper!

We didn't care for this.  I used thin sliced skinless chicken breast (I usually use this type of chicken) and the flavor was bitter and overwhelming. It may be better on regular chicken breast(I am not sure - since we always eat the thin sliced.)

Great!! I threw these in a ziploc & let these marinade for a full day, then we took 'em camping..I did cut the oil back to a few tbs., doesn't need as much as called for as we still had plenty left after grilling. Will definitely use again!

It's possible I over-marinated this dish...I ended up marinating it for 2 days before freezing it and using it the next weekend. In either case, I didn't like it. If you're used to worcheshire for steak, it may taste a little weird. It was also VERY salty. With the soy sauce already in the recipe, I'd skip on the extra salt. All I could really taste was the worcheshire. Everyone else seems to love this, so I guess I'd say don't over marinate!

Omitted the salt and used only 1T of oil. Loved the acidic taste of the lemon and red wine vineger. Does not need all that oil, tasted great with just the 1T. Will make again.

I left my chicken to soak in this marinade overnight.  I then pressure cooked the chicken.  It turned out so moist, and tasty.

I have used this recipe 3 times with great success!!  The chicken has been tender and juicy and very tasty!  I skewered some chicken and froze it in the marinade -- the best I've ever had!  I used it on boneless, skinless breasts for a work potluck and everyone wanted to know my "secret."  And I used it on a fryer pack (legs, breast, thighs, etc) -- and the kids even loved it!  I didn't have dry mustard, so I used yellow mustard; no fresh parsley, so I used dry Italian seasoning.

I cut the oil in half, and added a tiny bit of brown sugar.... FANTASTIC!  The ingredients seemed odd to me, but I tried it anyway.  The flavor is wonderful, and the meat turned out very tender.  I marinated the chicken overnight.  I think this is the key to a good marinade.  My kids loved it, and we ended up using the leftovers in a chicken salad.  Delicious. ENJOY!

Very good! I put my chicken breasts in the marinade on Thursday night and we ate them camping on Friday and Saturday nights. Everyone loved it so much that we had it AGAIN on Sunday night when we got home with leftover marinade I had left in the fridge. Those chicken breasts I only marinated for 30 minutes and it was just as yummy. I used only 1/2 cup of oil to try to cut the second time I made this and there was no noticable difference!

You know you have a winner when your (picky) 3 year old exclaims, "Mmmm...Mommy, I Love this Chicken!!!".  This was very easy to make.  Served it with Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad from this site.  Great Meal!

I put the chicken in to marinate in the morning and then cooked it in the oven (at 350 F) after I got home from work. I wish I had made more! I made it as written and LOVED it. Thanks Jill!

Awesome recipe! I personally do not like to marinade meats with lemon juice, so I added the lemon juice just prior to cooking. It came out great!

Easy to make, good results.  This is not a "flashy" marinade... no particular flavour stands out, except maybe a bit too much "sour".... too much vinegar or lemon, maybe?  All in all pretty good.

This was awesome! I wouldn't change a thing. I made the marinade two days before, and put the chicken in it 24 hours ahead of time. The flavor goes all the way through the chicken.

Marinated chicken for 4 hours today.  Although it was good, I thought it might taste a little better considering the rave reviews.  Yes, I will use this marinade again, but if I didn't have the ingredients on hand, I'd stick to italian dressing.

This was a GREAT marinade! I was so surprised at how flavorful my chicken was after marinating for only one hour. I can just imagine how this would taste after marinating several hours longer. Thanks for a terrific recipe!

It certainly is easy to make.  Chicken was very good but boy did it cause flare ups on the grill.  Maybe next time I will try baking it in the oven or in a foil pan on the grill.

Great marinade.  I think it is very important to marinade at least overnight (mine was 24 hours).  I did not have any parsley, I was thinking it might burn anyway.  I made 1/2 the recipe and as a money saver used whole chicken that I cut it in half.  Grilled on low heat for about 45 min.  The meat was tender and delicious, got the thumbs up from my husband (he always puts some kind of sauce on chicken to cover blandness, but not this time!) Will definitely make again.

My entire family loves this marinade.  We marinade at least 4 hours, but overnight if we have the time.  Chicken stays very moist and flavorful.  Only change I've made is instead of salt/pepper, I use a tbl or two of grilltime for chicken instead.  We make this at least once a week!

AWESOME!!! I marinated frozen chicken in this for about 5 hours.  It was still frozen, so I was afraid the flavors would not have been absorbed, but I fixed it on my George Foreman grill (you can fix frozen chicken on it in about 10 minutes), and it was INCREDIBLE!!!  This is my husband's new favorite way to eat chicken, and mine too actually.  I couldn't stand to throw away the leftover marinade, so I threw some steak in it, and we're having that tonight.  I'll let you know how it turns out!

Really easy and super quick!  We let the chicken breasts marinate overnight and the flavor was intense.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it was a tad bit on the salty side.  Next time we're going to try to add a bit of brown sugar to the mix and see what happens.  Warning:  if you're cooking this on the grill, it tends to flame up a lot!  Makes for quite a show!

I used this and it was the most flavorful chicken ever! Made it for a New Years Party and was a HUGE hit. I stuck frozen chicken in the marinade and allowed it to thaw in the fridge for 1 day and grilled it the following night... YUM. I am definately making this one again.

YUM YUM YUM!!! I used this for chicken and liked it so much I used the exact same marinade for steaks the next night. It is great. I didn't have redwine vinegar so I substituted with balsamic and a splash of apple cider vinegar. I also added 1 tbsp of minced garlic because you can rarely go wrong with garlic. This recipe is now a staple for delicious and simple meat preparation. Thanks, Jill, for a wonderful recipe.

Hit of our big 50th Wedding Anniversary Cookout.  I was asked for the recipe by quite a few guests!  The chicken was very juicy and tender.  Even my father who doesn't like white meat raived about it!  Very recommended!

Made 1/2 a recipe - enough to marinate 8 large boneless, skinless breasts. They are so moist and so tender. This is our new "standby" way to make grilled chicken!

I have to admit that, when making this...I did not at all...care for the way that the combination of ingredients smelled but once it was cooked...it was fabulous and a nice surprise. We all enjoyed it and will be making it again.

I sort of halved this recipe.  I omitted the salt, vinegar and parsley and added a splash of ketchup as someone else suggested. Since I was going to use my George Foreman Grill I cut my boneless chicken breasts in half lengthwise and marinated them for half an hour.  It was enough.  They came out fabulous.  I'll use this recipe whenever I grill.

Appreciate you sharing this one!! This marinade makes the most moist chicken and adds a great barbeque tang to it.

Very tasty. I've been working alot and had my husband make this with drumsticks for the kids and I. The combination of ingredients makes a wonderful marinade. I didn't however add any salt, as I found the soy sauce added enough flavour. We will use this one again.

This is an excellent marinade. Did not would not change a thing.   Although I did halve the recipe since there were just 2 of us. One idea is to marinate cubes of chicken breasts for kabobs. Mmmmm so good! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is the chicken marinade we've been looking for! We used it for a raclette (hot stone fondue) night 3 days ago and all 8 of us thought it was the best we've had yet.  This will definitely be our go to from now on! We won't be changing a thing in the recipe; just using as is.

Made as written and it was ok. Both my husband and I think it's lacking a specific flavor, but I just can't put my finger on it. I'm not certain if I'll make it again. If I do, I might try adding garlic.

Love this chicken marinade . I am going to try it on pork chop next time I bake them. The  boneless  chicken breast and thighs were flavorful and moist. I put them in refrigerator over night and didn’t remove them till time to bake them. I did add onion on top of my meat. I also used a little water in pan. I wasn’t sure if they would stick. I definitely will make this again .

Easy enough.  Everyone loved it. I may cut back on the added salt next time, enough sodium in the soy and Worcestershire sauce. 

I marinaded for about 2-hours, I will soak them longer next time. But, 2 hours was enough to pass...

I followed the recipe, except I didn’t have red wine vinegar, and used regular vinegar instead. Also, I used dried parsley. In spite of that, the marinade made the most delicious and moist chicken strips.

Excellent flavor!!  Made this for our 4th of July BBQ, and it was a huge success!  The only change I made was to reduce the oil to about 1/2.  The next day I used a few leftover pieces for a quick chicken noodle soup, the marinade flavors added a whole new depth to the broth’s flavor.  Even the picky eaters were raving about it!!

Excellent marinade!   Marinade the longer the better ( usually do at least 3 hours ).  Do use foil for chicken on the grill since the drippings will cause flame ups.

Great results!  I used chicken drumsticks, and only marinated them for 45 minutes.  I scraped the bottom of the mustard barrel so only used half the amount, and got away with it.

I  following the recipe exactly.  Marinating most of the day, grilling it, then biting into it, I was really disappointed!! It tasted blah. I added a few sprinkles of garlic powder to the to and a little salt. Way better! I have half of the batch left and going to add a tablespoon of garlic power and another teaspoon of salt to see if it improved.

I made an AllRecipes account just so I could save this to my favorites because I always come back to this recipe and it doesn't show up as first anymore when I search for chicken marinades. I sometimes crave it, especially in the summer time. I use this for kabobs! I even put the veggies in it. Everything always turns out amazing.

This has been my family recipe for over 50 years. Just add 4 cloves of smashed cut up garlic and 2teaspoons onion powder, and it's like Grandpa used to make. Great for pork tenderloin on the grill too. We marinate chicken for 16 to 24 hours. Slow cook and let the marinade drip to the coals and fire up smoke. Devine.

Made the chicken taste very good. Hubby really liked. I thought it had a lot of flavor. Altho I decided in the last 15 mins of marinating that I wanted a touch of heat, too, so I added a small amt of Sambal, unfortunately it wasn't enuff to give us the heat I was looking for (mental note for next time).  I went ahead and poured the remaining marinade over the chicken after placing it in the dish.  I believe that really gave us the full flavor we experienced.

It wasn’t my favorite marinade. It was very, and I mean very, salty. The amount of soy sauce is the culprit. When I made it, I thought it would be a good candidate for a steak marinade (I did use chicken though for this).

I was not impressed with this one mainly because of the salt (I used low sodium soy sauce as well). It needs something to balance the salt-maybe ginger, garlic or red wine?

Cheers

One of my favorite marinades! Had it on venison tonight as well as mixed about 1/4 cup into my brown gravy mix for mashed potatoes. I rarely have the opportunity to actually grill,  so most of the time I cook this on the stove. Just be prepared for it to smoke. Oh, and I omit the salt, soy sauce has enough salt in it for me.

For anyone watching their fat, I made this with NO oil and it was fantastic. Boneless chicken marinated overnight and then grilled. Going in my regular rotation.

So easy and flavorful.  I used red wine I had leftover from a few days earlier instead the wine vinegar.  The recipe was more than I needed so I bottled it and will try on beef soon.

I had chicken breasts thawed for 2 days so I tried this marinade and soaked them 2 days. I took the hint to leave out the salt and I quartered the recipe so as not to waste ingredients. The chicken was fabulous after grilling: moist and tasty. I will use this again and perhaps follow the recipe as is, use what I need and refrigerate the remaining marinade.

Oustanding marinade!! I made it exactly as prepared and it turned out both flavorful and very moist and tender Only marinated my chicken breasts for about 3-4 hours....Served with baked sweet potatoes with cinnamon and garlic roasted green beans. Also, a little dijon mustard goes well with this....

The full recipe makes 30 oz. so it fits perfectly into a mayonnaise jar, which makes for a great shaker to combine marinade ingredients before pouring onto chicken or meat. I used 1/3 of the recipe for a whole chicken cut up. Then saved the rest in the refrigerator for future use.

Normally I'm not a fan of chicken breast but this marinade made it taste like something I want to put into the regular rotation.  Fantastic & everybody loved it.  Like most, I reduced the amount (by about 1/2) keeping the ratio the same, & added 1 large minced garlic.

I put the chicken breasts in a zip top bag before I went to bed then grilled it the next day for lunch. The chicken was amazingly moist and delicious. Made it exactly as written. Will be using this every time.

It was ok at best I thought. I think it was the red wine vinegar that threw it off for me, tart and sour. Won't be making it again.

Made according to recipe except for fresh parsley (only had dry on hand). It made enough to marinate 4 large chicken breasts and about 3/4 of a quart jar to use later. Marinated all day in frig and grilled for dinner. Moist and delicious! Definitely worth the effort. Will make again.

Love this marinade. It's so tasty! I made sure to marinade for over 4 hours. Totally worth it! Then I used the leftover cold chicken to make chicken salad and it was spectacular!

Great!  I added some garlic powder, 'cause everything needs some garlic, right?  Make sure to use low-sodium soy sauce, or else it will come out too salty.  Six hours marinating seems to be about right for thighs.

Please note, this makes a large amount, so I adjusted recipe to 8 servings and it was plenty for 2 large chicken breasts. Be sure to use low sodium soy sauce.  I don't think it really needs much salt added to recipe. The day I made this, I intended to grill the chicken, but my propane tank was empty.  So I baked in a cast iron pan in the oven at 425* for about 30 minutes, flipping halfway through.  towards the end I poured the rest of the marinade on the chicken breasts and 1 T. vermouth.  It turned out very tasty! I also swear by Costco Organic Chicken as it is always so tender. I am making this again today, but going to try on the grill.

I made the marinade for chicken pieces and it was delicious. Because the recipe makes so much, I only used half and saved the rest for another time. Following the suggestion of others, I left the chicken in the marinade for about 8 hours and I didn't add any additional salt
 The chicken was moist and juicy. I plan to try it on pork chops and maybe a turkey breast. Thanks for a wonderful recipe

I use 1/4 soy sauce and 1 cup Worcestershire sauce to make it less salty.

I marinated chicken breasts for about 16 hours....I thought the chicken was tender and flavorful but too tangy. Next time I will omit either the vinegar or the lemon juice.

We served the marinated grilled chicken breasts over romaine salad and it was terrific. We plan to make all summer long! Excellent marinade!

As another poster noted, too salty and too much wurs. But next time I will tweak, and I'm sure it will be better.

I started making the recipe then realized it was for 32 servings!  It was really good but I should cut this recipe in 1/4. I need to read the details next time.  Learned my lesson. The recipe itself was good.

I didn't do this recipe as written - I omitted the salt (because soy sauce is salty in itself...no need to add extra sodium). I added a couple cloves of minced garlic, dried parsley (no fresh on hand), brown sugar, and real maple syrup. I also measured by eye/feel.  I found the marinade to be way too oily (I will cut down the oil by half the next time I make it to see if it makes it better).

My husband and I enjoyed this marinade. It has flavor except only on the outside of the chicken. We couldn't get the flavor to really permeate (maybe I should have poked holes in the chicken breasts with a fork before placing them in the marinade). 

I liked the tanginess of the marinade but the oil was way too much. It almost overpowered everything.

Pretty good base but WAY too salty for me, even without adding salt and with low-sodium soy sauce. I added a somewhat sweet balsamic vinaigrette I had, just a little, and extra oil, to dilute the saltiness (I also made only about a 1/4 portion) and that made it perfect, added some extra spices too. After marinating, did chicken breasts on my George Foreman grill and cut up into spaghetti, really good.

Sorry but we did not like this. I followed the recipe except for halved the mustard because my husband doesn't care for it.  The only flavors we could taste were vinegar and lemon. I gave this 2 stars rather than 1 because I used thin cut chicken breast and maybe because of the small size of the filets they took in more marinade than a thicker cut.  They only sat in the marinade for about 3 hours.

It was good. The recipe yielded more than I needed even when I cut back 2/3rds of all ingredients and I would use less vinegar/lemon next time but great colour and flavour. Thanks!

My family really enjoyed this.  It's a nice change from same old boring chicken.  We found the flavor to be perfectly balanced and not too strong.  The only substitution I made was balsamic vinegar for red wine vinegar and it worked great.

I used this marinade on chicken breasts. I ended up letting them marinate over night, and then I grilled them. They were so tender and juicy. I highly recommend this recipe. I can't wait to try it on drumsticks or a whole chicken. Thanks for the share!

I used balsamic vinegar and regular mustard and it was great.   I paired the chicken on wooden skewers with onion, red pepper and zucchini.  I used the remaining marinade on vegetables.   Easy and tasty!

This marinade is excellent, but as other reviewers point out: if you have the time to let it marinate for longer... Do it! I used about a quarter of the recipe to marinate 4 chicken breasts overnight... The results were delicious! I baked the chicken breasts in the extra sauce and then used some of the leftover marinade the next day to stir fry bok choy... This marinade has many excellent uses!

I use this all the time for my Carrabbas Copy Cat Pollo Rosa Maria. I always try a recipe as written before making any subs and this one was spot on. Didn't have to change a thing. Sometimes if I don't have fresh parsley I do use the dried or just omit. I don't find that it lends that much flavor anyway. It all fits perfectly into a quart mason jar and just give it a few shakes, done!

This is now my favorite go-to marinade for chicken!  I usually cut the recipe in half and use 2 chicken breasts cut up into smaller pieces (big enough not to fall through the grill but small enough to make a bunch of bite-size pieces). My picky 3 year olds love it as well as my picky husband!!  If I could give 10 stars I would!

This marinade recipe makes ALOT. I made a half-recipe for 8 chicken thighs and had more marinade than I needed. Next time I'll try a 1/3 of the recipe.  Only change I made was to omit the parsley (just don't like it) and added chopped garlic (one large clove). Took the skin off the chicken and marinaded for 24 hours. Broiled on low for 7 minutes, turned meat and broiled 5 more minutes. It was delicious and tender! Adding this to the "make again" category!

I wish I could give 10 stars. The best not thing I did that was different was I used olive oil. Every quarter in on the chicken breast I made cuts about halfway through, marinaded it for 2 hours, threw them on the grill and when I flipped them I reapplied the marinade with a brush. Everyone I fed complimented the chicken. My wife was upset because they usually talk about her macaroni salad, lol.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I didn't like the dry mustard.    Next time, I will use some Dijon or prepared yellow mustard instead.  I will say, the chicken was very moist and tender!

Very flavorful chicken! Used this for 10 chicken thighs. I added garlic and cayenne pepper and let the thighs marinade for 2 days before grilling them. So yummy. My new go to marinade.

I used the recipe for 16 servings and marinaded my chicken breasts for 9 hours. The chicken did not pick up the flavors from the ingredients. It was bland. I baked the chicken for 40 minutes at 375, covered with foil and I left it in the marinade. I served it with the marinade because it needed the flavor. This recipe is not worth the effort and I will not make it again.

After reading so many 4 & 5 star reviews, this was an absolute disappointment! Followed recipe except only used 1 teaspoon black pepper as I thought what the recipe called for was way too much. I love Asian cuisine where soy sauce is a staple but the overwhelming soy flavor in this recipe combined with the other ingredients was just not good. Thank goodness I decided to halve the recipe so I didn't waste too many ingredients on this flop!

I made this last night for the first time.  Based on reviews of others, I omitted the salt, added some minced garlic and cut way back on the oil- 1/3 cup.  I let the chicken marinate in the fridge for about 6 hours.  I thought it was just OK, but my husband liked it and he is very picky, so I will probably try it again.  Next time I will add some brown sugar, as some have suggested.

I have made this quite a few times and it is excellent! It's great on chicken and pork. I usually let the meat marinate overnight, because I think the longer it sits in there, the better.  Thanks for the great recipe, Jillypooh!!

Delicious!  
After marinating, we added some brown sugar and sriracha and reduced the mixture on the stove. We used that to glaze the skewers for the last couple minutes of cooking.

Even though I overccooked the chicken, everyone still loved it! That's how moist and delicious the chicken was! One thing thing I wish I realized though was the large serving size of this recipe. I should have read the reviews first and chosen a smaller serving size in the options to have the recipe reduced!

My family and I really liked this.  We didn't marinade very long...about two hours and the chicken was part-frozen.  But it really tenderized.  I used olive oil and was very generous with the lemon juice.  I discovered I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so I added a little more  soy sauce and added a glug of steak sauce (desperate times call for desperate measures). Everyone thought it was great...ages 3,9,12,16 and 42.  Served with a homemade cheese sauce or barbecue sauce for those who preferred that over top a bed of basmati rice and fresh veggies..  I'd marinade a lot longer if I didn't add the accompanying sauces.  The cheese sauce over top was worth the effort and added yummy decadence.  Just saying.  I will make this again!

I made this just the way it called for, nothing different.  I do own a marinater container that takes the air out  and allows it to marinate faster. I used this because, I wanted it for dinner and it was about noon. I did cut up 2 chicken breast  and put them with onions, bell peppers , zuccinni and pineapple. Screwered them and grilled on all sides useing some of the marinade to  brush on it as it grilled. Very good.  I then put the remander Chicken in a plastic container and put in icebox. I cooked it on the grill whole the next night. It was  also good but more flavor to it and I did not brush them just turned them. Soo Great. Next time I will do the same I have two dishes in one marinade.

This marinade makes the chicken SO tender and has a great flavor!! I used Teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce since that is what I had on hand. My hubby loves this recipe so I think it'll be my go to for chicken!! I let it marinade all day.

I made this almost exactly as the recipe reads with three exceptions: I did not add salt; I didn't have fresh parsley so I used about a teaspoon of dried; and I added a quarter teaspoon of liquid smoke. I marinated it overnight and everyone raved about the flavor of the chicken and how tender and moist it was. Will definitely make again!

This is my first time using this marinade and my roommate and I agree it's a keeper. Next time I will use olive oil, I was out so I used vegetable oil. I marinated my boneless, skinless chicken breast for 4hrs. and my chicken was perfect.

I will use this recipe again. I followed the recipe except I did not add the salt because several people said it was too salty.

Excellent....served my daughter, her 2 kids aged 2 & 4, plus my wife and I.....everyone loved it, kids wanted more; Success! I used canola oil and next time will try extra virgin olive oil. I also had fresh lemons so squeezed the lemon juice fresh!

The recipe was for 32 servings which i'm not sure how much chicken that would marinade. I scaled it down to 8 and used it in a seal-a-meal marinade container for 3 chicken breasts. It's a really pleasing not over powering marinade.

What a great find this recipe has been.  My family loves this marinade and it's the one they always ask for when it's time for chicken on the grill.

Followed the recipe and added 1/2 tsp. minced garlic and 1-2 tsp. of honey.  Had scaled back to 8 servings, and marinated 4-6 hours.

This was fantastic! The chicken turned out perfectly. I put it on kabobs with yellow potatoes which we marinated in the same sauce and we all loved it. Already saved the recipe and will definitely make again!

really didn't care for it.  After adding in some brown sugar though, it was perfect and is now my favorite marinade recipe.  I divide this recipe by 3 when I make it and still have enough marinade to flavor 6 big chicken breasts.  I add in enough brown sugar to equal the measurement of red wine vinegar (which, when you divide this recipe by 3, ends up to be 3 Tablespoons).  Perfection.

I'd been looking for a decent chicken marinade and finally decided to try this one. Glad I did! My whole family loved it, even the picky kiddos. I omitted the salt since the recipe called for soy. Marinated for about five hours and grilled it. It was perfect!!! I love to grill so this will be a regular from now on.

This recipe was ok, i used exact as stated. i had to add sugar to balance out the salty taste. Good basic marinade, won't make again due to the salt content, sorry.

I made this because I could manage it with ingredients already on hand. It doesn't have the intensity of flavor I like in a marinade. I'm wondering if it is too much oil.

I cook a lot and I never take the time to review these recipes. I can't not review this one!! It's super delicious, super easy, and yes, this recipe makes quite a bit so I have gotten three separate pounds of chicken breasts out of this. My kids say it's the best they've ever eaten and I do agree! Thank you for sharing this:)

I marinated my chicken as directed last night.  I pulled it out of the refrigerator tonight to find the whole dish covered in a thick, jelly-like substance, similar to grease that's cooled and hardened, only green.  Not sure what to do at this point.

Followed the recipe with the exception of using dried parsley. I used chicken thighs and grilled on the bbq. I thought it was just ok, there was a lot of flavour, though it wasn't something that I would make again.

I make this all the time.  Especially great on chicken thighs.  I follow the recipe exactly but substitute dried parsley and add 2 heaping tablespoons of brown sugar and a teaspoon of garlic powder.  Always gets raves!

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and my chicken came out very acetic. Maybe I just have a overly zest lemon? Did I let it marinade too long (6 hours)? Perhaps it was a mistake to cut the chicken into strips before marinating? Not sure what went wrong. Sigh.

I had a lot of chicken to be grilled for quick dinners and lunches.  I divided it up between a lime-cilantro marinade and this recipe.  I needed a recipe where I had all the ingredients in the house.  This one was a good fit.  Only substitution I made was I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  The chicken was awesome.  Everybody loved it.  It's definitely a keeper and we'll be making it again.

We tried this recipe and it was a huge success! The first thing mentioned at the table was that the chicken we grilled could be served in a restaurant and it would be a hit! Any naysayers about this recipe certainly did something wrong.

Great marinade! I used it for chicken on the grill. One small change, I added some honey for sweetness. Didn't hurt original recipe at all. For those of you who don't need as much, use the "change servings" (under the Ingredients) as I did and you won't waste any by making too much!

Great recipe!   I made half of the marinade for a few chicken leg quarters.   I marinated them for four hours and then cooked on the grill.   It kept the chicken so moist, and the taste was delicious!   I omitted the salt and used low sodium soy sauce.   Adding to our favorites.

This is fantastic, I have never been able to make good barbeque chicken this did the trick. My family loved it, I let it marinade overnight and it tastes great. thanks for the recipe. I added liquid smoke and garlic powder.

Outstanding! My family is super picky and everyone loved the chicken. I also used the on portabella mushrooms and BBQ'd them.  I thought they were too salty but my husband ate nearly a pound of them. He doesn't like mushrooms. Highly recommend this recipe.

Exceptional! Also tried it on pork, beef, even a piece of salmon (a little bit). Very tasty. Makes a good sized batch that you can keep in the fridge until you need it again. Thanks for sharing!

I also did not add the extra salt.  In addition I used slightly less Worcestershire and slightly more soy sauce because I knew we would like it that way.  I thought there was maybe a tiny bit too much mustard, but my husband didn't think so.  I used this for baked chicken, but for some reason it didn't get crispy at all.  I think it would be really good for chicken on the rotisserie.

Excellent marinade.  This just moved up to my "go to" marinade for chicken.  I marinated the chicken overnight and it was incredibly moist and tender.  I'm glad I found it!

This marinade is perfect. I usually skip the salt because the soy sauce provides enough. I could seriously eat this on bbq chicken everyday of the week - it's that delicious!

Definitely the best chicken marinade I've made.  But I did replace the veg oil with EVOO and also added 2 cloves of garlic for a 10 person amount.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I took the advice of ValleyGirl that said it was too salty.  I actually didn't use ANY added salt as I know the soy sauce already had a lot in it.  Was GREAT!   I think perhaps next time I may put just a little bit of molasses or sugar and see if it gives just a hint of sweetness.  Will use again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty!  Didn't have a lemon, so added more red wine vinegar. Also added some honey for a bit of sweetness. Would definitely make this again, especially in a pinch as usually have all of these ingredients on hand.

I cut up an 4# whole chicken (bone in, skin on)and used this marinade.  Time prevented more that about 1 hour for marinade.  
However, it was very moist, I pulled off most of the skin when we ate it.   Some was nice and crispy and way too yummy to trash.  I will marinade 12 hours or so next time!!

My family loved it. We eat a lot of chicken so this was a new marinade for us. I marinaded the chicken overnight, and only used half amount of salt. The chicken that was leftover was fantastic on salad. I will be making this again. Definitely makes a lot of marinade,I will half the recipe.

This was okay.  I don't think the problem was the marinade.  We just like something with more punch.

I made this using chicken breast for BBQ kabobs. I saw the recipe and had all the ingratiates on hand. I was a bit nervous since I hadn't made it before and we were having company for dinner. It was excellent. My company said that it was so good that they want me to make the same thing the next time they come over. I would suggest halving the recipe unless you are making a lot of chicken.

I don't particularly like grilled chicken.  I find it often bland and a bit dry.  But I used this marinade on some chicken tenders and cooked them out on the grill-- even my ridiculously picky 9 year old loves it!  He refuses to eat chicken any other way.  And really, I don't blame him. :)

SO salty after only 1 hour of marinating... will definitely do again with NO added salt. And I used low sodium soy sauce.  The chicken was really tender.

This was very good - I also cut the amounts in half. Forgot the parsley (even tho I did have some!)

I wasn't too sure about it after it was made. I must say I used melted coconut oil (refined) instead of vegetable oil due to health benefits- when I added the cold ingredients (my Tamari (soy) sauce & worcestershire sauce) it caused the coconut oil to "gel" up.

No problem tho once it went on the grill! I used it for boneless skinless chicken thighs - they were very tasty! Will definitely make it again!

I made some changes.  Not a fan of Worcestershire, so I deleted it and sub'd a whole crushed clove of elephant garlic, sub'd olive oil instead of vegetable oil, sub'd juice of one fresh lime instead of lemon juice, and sub'd two tablespoons of prepared horseradish mustard for the dried mustard.  I marinated chicken thighs all day and we grilled them.  Awesome!

We liked this a lot and would definitely use again. I left out the salt as other reviewers suggested and it was plenty salty, which is why I gave the recipe as written 4 stars.

I have made this many times for grilled chicken and it is always a keeper. I use low sodium soy sauce and sometimes skip the salt. it's just a matter of taste preference.

I made no other change except to use olive oil, and drop the black pepper back a bit more than half as my kids don't like anything that they perceive to be "spicy." This has to be the best marinade for chicken I've used. Ever. I have Zaycon chicken, which tends to be a bit tough as it's not injected with anything. I wanted to marinate overnight, but forgot to put it together until about 4pm this afternoon. I put it on the grill at 6:30 and was sure it would be tasteless and tough. It was delicous, juicy and tender. Just the right amount of "spice" and fabulous flavor. I am already wondering when we can have some family over so I can make it again.

Super delicious! Once I was done marinading the chicken, I reduced the sauce and added sugar to make it into a BBQ sauce... Seriously --- it's the best sauce I have ever tasted!
I used actual mustard and dry mustard and rosemary instead on parsley.

I will definitely repeat this recipe, but next time I will omit the additional salt that is called for and maybe reduce the soy sauce a bit.  It is very salty, but otherwise very tasty and moist.

Superb marinade. I used olive oil & low-sodium soy sauce. The batch as listed makes enough to fully marinate 2 gallon zip bags full of chicken pieces. The longer you marinate, the better it is. I plan to try this with pork chops and skirt steak as well. Thank you so much for sharing this!

Made as directed EXCEPT I used low sodium soy sauce and low sodium
Worcestershire and cut the recipe in half as it is only "The Boss" 
(read wife) and I.  Outstanding.  We're just emerging from a viscous
winter and this was the perfect way to kick off the grilling season.
You owe it to yourself to try this.  
Many thanks, JILLYPOOH.

This recipe has a great flavor . I substituted olive oil for veggie oil and added a splash of teriyaki sauce. It's winter so I used an electric  grill ... And the chicken breast ended up moist and nicely browned. Thank you ... The hubby loved it!

delicious. I added a tbsp brown sugar, and a tbsp fireweed honey (made fresh by some family friends!) it turned out awesome. I had tasted the marinade after preparing it as is and it was still delicious. Was not necessary to alter, but I did per my personal taste.

I did not have any worc sauce (we don't like it) and added some garlic cloves. I also used herbs vinegar which also worked fine. I let it marinate over night. It was wonderful! Thank you!

Just a little too salty. Going to make it again and look through reviews on how to tweek it. But everyone thought it was really good though.

This is as good as others have said. I made a half recipe, marinaded chicken for a family of 5, and still tossed out a lot of marinade. Every bit of chicken was devoured.

Instead of using red wine vinegar I used white wine vinegar, I substituted the vegetable oil for olive oil, and instead of powdered mustard I used the same amount of regular mustard.  I also added sugar to taste.  My husband and I grilled our chicken breasts after a 24 hours soak and they were absolutely delicious.  I will certainly be using this again with my own twist on it.

I've used this as a base for a number of chicken recipes, all of which have been big hits with family and friends.

This marinade was awesome, used it for Chicken and Pork, everyone loved it! The Chicken was as good as the BBQ Chicken you can buy from all morning grilling, but only took me less than 15 minutes, and the pork, when first seared 1 minute each side and then cooked on medium tasted like Steak!

Amazing. I followed this recipe and marinated the chicken in the fridge for about 5 hours before cooking. My family destroyed 4 1/2 pounds of chicken breasts, and what's more is they think I'm la grill master. Thanks for sharing your recipe. !!!!

Great recipe! Only have one minor change, or should I say addition. Add a small amount of GARLIC powder. It's good for you, and you will like the flavor.

The chicken was very tender with this marinade. There was no special flavor, however. It seemed to be missing something.  It would be fun to try the brown sugar suggestion next time.

One of the best marinade recipes we've tried (and we've tried a lot) hands down. Tested it on about 10-12 different people on 4 different occasions and everyone raved about it. For less than 4lbs. of chicken cut the recipe in half. Love it!

Delicious grilled chicken! My 5 and 3 year old named it the "Best Chicken Ever" and asked if we can have it again tomorrow night.  We all loved it and will make it again (every night if it was up to the kids).

Fast, easy, pretty good. I used boneless chicken thighs and pan-fried. I skipped the salt as many other reviewers recommended--great call as the soy sauce was salty enough on its own! I didn't see a huge difference between marinating for two hours and overnight; maybe the chicken was a little more tender in the latter but it wasn't a stark enough contrast to be worth it for me. Next time I'm going to marinate for 2-3 hours and grill.

I pricked boneless chicken thighs with a fork and marinated the chicken in this marinade for about two hours. I broiled the chicken (I'm not a grill aficionado) and my husband and I found it very tasty and moist. I will definitely make this again but I won't add the salt because I watch sodium very closely; there is enough soy to compensate, I believe.

We love this marinade!  Since we only buy boneless, skinless chicken breasts now, I'm happy to have a new marinade that adds something to an otherwise bland piece of chicken, especially if done in the oven.  We barbequed the chicken and the marinade created a great crispy coating and the meat was very moist despite cooking the chicken to 170F.  Thanks for a great marinade.  It's now my go-to for chicken!

I made this marinade for my father in law last week and I was surprised how good it came out. I scaled back a little on the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce so it wasn't that strong. He was my ginny pig going into 4th of July weekend lol. I will definitely make this for the holiday coming up.  The other thing I didn't do was add salt.  I will be using this a lot more in the future it is very tasty.

WOW!!  I am normally NOT a "marinade person," but this was DELICIOUS!!  I did make the adjustments recommended by other reviewers...We added honey and minced garlic.  Also, we wanted to marinade overnight, so we left out the lemon.  We took a chance on leaving the vinegar in, as that can sometimes dry out the meat, too, but it didn't at all!  Everyone raved about it and after years of resistance, I am now a fan of marinade!! At least this one!  :-)

I thought this recipe was good, but not exceptional. I halved the recipe for approx 2lbs of boneless skinless chicken thighs (it was still more than enough) and marinaded for 7 hrs.  Chicken was flavorful, but not overkill like some vinegar based marinades.

This is a great recipe for Chicken marinade. After marinating the chicken for several hours my husband grilled this chicken and it taste great. I will be using this marinade again. Really loved it.

Aside from having all the ingredients which Is a first for me I made it exactly as written except to scale it down. Maybe by scaling it down made a big difference but to us it really had no flavor to speak of on the chicken, I used skinless breast so maybe if it had skin it would have been better. Probably won't try again sorry.

We marinaded & then cooked this for the first time last night and we are SURE to be fighting over the leftovers tonight! The flavors are AMAZING when combined, and yet it was so simple to make. We let it marinade overnight and then our patience was rewarded with a flavorful, simple meal to bake. We made ours with boiled red potatoes as a side as well as sliced squash & zuchini with a chopped-up onion sauteed in some water with a little bit of butter. This meal was FANTASTIC!

We've been using this for years w/ a couple of variations: beer or wine in place of the vinegar and a clove of garlic. Also, we marinate the meat in a Food Saver cannister, which cuts down on the marinating time.

This marinade is quite good! You can substitute any Italian dressing (like Wishbone) for the oil and vinegar, if you like. It does well on meats and vegetables. The longer you marinate, the more flavorful the food.

Used this marinade (minus the pepper - husband hates pepper) for shish kabobs at lunch today.  Marinated the veggies in it also.  We enjoyed the flavor and it is simple to make with ingredients you have on hand.

This was sooooooo delicious! I added minced garlic and used this same recipe to marinate steaks the next night. I have a lot of people in this house ranging in ages from 10-45 and EVERYONE loved it!!
I'm using it again tonight =)

This is a great marinade.  I've been using this exact one for flank and skirt steaks for the last 25 years. It's especially good if you can marinade for up 8-10 hours before grilling; anymore and you risk burning the meat. It was my mother who gave me the recipe, though I don't know where she got it from originally.  It is my go-to recipe and I'm so happy to see it on the web.  No more looking through those old, stained and now disorganized recipe cards!!!  Thanks.

We both agree it is ok but nothing to jump up and down about.  Used light soy sauce, don't need extra salt.

Truly delicious and very easy. Smoky, complex flavor. Marinated the chicken for 4 hours which was plenty, though more time makes it even better. I only used 1/2 a cup of oil rather than 1 1/2 cups, and could probably have used even less.

I followed the recipe exactly and let the chicken marinade all day as other reviews recommended and the chicken came out extremely salty.  Maybe less time or low sodium sauces would help but I wouldn't even make it again.

very tasty...marinated about 12 hours.Flavor was stronger around the edges of the chicken so next time I`ll poke holes all over the chicken to let the marinade flavor it better. 
I used greek seasoning instead of s & p. Will make again soon.

I didn't know how to change this recipe so I just guessed last night when I made it.  (The recipe I saw was for 32, and I was doing 2!)  With just guessing, it turned out great!!! Today I figured out how to change it per serving.  I will use this marinade again and again.  I just joined Allrecipes today!!

Wow, my family devoured this, including a 3 year old and a 4.5 year old. We literally fought over the last bite. Will definitely be making again, maybe even tomorrow - and doubling the amount of chicken!

Perfect.  I left out last item or 2 because I didnt have on hand.  Great anyway!  I only marinated for about 90 min.

This is a must-try recipe.  The ingredients are already in your cupboard.  I Experimented with it on Memorial Day to see if it would work for my mother-in-law's surprise 75th  birthday party. Rave reviews each time!

Quick and easy marinade.  I was only able to marinate for 5 hours.  I am certain that it would have benefited from more time.  I am taking the advice of another reviewer who has suggested that this would be a great marinade for steak.  Having tasted it with chicken, I completely agree. The Worchestershire sauce is what made me think that this might even be a better pairing with steak.  We shall see!

I made this marinade last night for some chicken we were going to grill for dinner. I only had time to marinate the chicken for 1-1/2 hrs, but the flavor was absolutely phenomenal! This chicken was the moistest chicken I have ever had anywhere:) I still have lots left for at least 2 more batches of chicken, as it makes a very generous quantity. Thank you for sharing this phenomenal recipe!

I really don't like grilled chicken, but I found this marinade to be very good! Will re-make as is. But don't forget to adjust serving size if you are only making for one serving, unless you bottle the rest.

This is definitely a keeper!  We loved it.  Cut recipe in half in case we didn't end up liking it.  Marinaded boneless chicken breasts for about 2 hours before grilling.  They were awesome.  Kept the remainder in the fridge and served to guests.  They raved and wanted the recipe.  This is our new favourite way to do chicken on the grill.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I wasn't that impressed. I used this marinade on grilled chicken and veggie skewers. I did add the garlic that otheres reccommended. I let the chicken and veggies marinate for 20 hourse. I don't think I'll try this recipe again.

This was a hit at our last BBQ! I personally thought it had too much of a vinegary flavor. Otherwise, the chicken was very moist and tasty!

Delicious--will be making again! I used a little less soy sauce and spicy mustard because I didn't have dry mustard on hand. Marinated for about 4 hours. Super juicy and so yummy!

This has become my go-to marinade. I make a big batch and keep it in the frig. We like marinading the chicken overnight and find chicken thighs to be our favorite with this.

OMG!  Amazing!  Husband loved the chicken and immediately said we have to make this again.  We did the chicken breasts on the bbq  and they were like the chicken breasts we get in the good restaurants.  Next time I will put feta on mine a few minutes before taking them off the bbq.

Incredible.  My 11 yr old son hates anything new and didn't really want to try it.  He asked what it was made with and I only told him the ingredients I thought he would like.  Well - he loved it!  Definately becoming on of our regulars.

Great marinade however doesn't need so much oil!  I used 1/2 cup olive oil instead of 1 1/2 vegetable oil so it was much healthier. I didn't have ground mustard so I substituted Grey Poupon.  Delicious!

Amazing!  It's fantastic grilled, and even better when it's used the next day cold in a pasta salad.  This marinade gives it just enough flavor without being overpowering.  I have to feed a picky husband and 4 kids under age 6, and this is one thing we ALL love.  The only change I've made when I needed to is to use prepared mustard instead of dry (when I'm out of dry), which works really well to substitute.

It was alright... Made this next to a batch of homemade Jamaican Jerk and this didn't compare. Nice recipe for a first-time, homemade marinade.

Used this marinade for BBQ on the grill after I got tired of the overpriced, generic tasting, preservative laced, store shelved  that all tasted the same. I wanted something different.  This was it.  Intitally it just looks like brown gook and you wonder if you really want to pour this over your chicken.  You do and for 24 hours! combine all of the ingredients and pour into a mason jar and shake it like those women on the shake weight commercials.  This is the only way you will get it to stay together.  Other wise it will seperate on you and you dont want that.  Awesome, awesome, awesome marinade when executed properly and allowed to seep into the meat.

I thought this has good flavor, but it is very salty (and I like salt).  Next time I will opt for low sodium soy sauce or eliminate the 1 tsp of salt that is added.

Amazing!  I've used this on chicken, pork, fish and beef.  Incredible on all!!  Before this recipe, I would brine pork and chicken for a day or more.  NO MORE!!    Thanks so much for sharing.

Made this just as specified (except only had white wine vinegar) and only marinated three large breasts.  It was way too much marinade but the flavor and moisture were fantastic!  I let the chicken marinate for about 3 hours and I would do it again that same amount of time or longer.    Will definitely make this again.  My husband and mom both enjoyed it as well.

This marinade is awesome! I used it twice on chicken and im going to try it on steak tonight!! Such a great taste to add something to plain ol meat. The only thing i did differently was add alittle more of the seasoning to it.

I love this marinade! This was so good, and just what I needed to revive "boring old chicken". I only made a few modifications because it's what I had on hand. Apple cider vinegar instead of red wine, a good squirt of spicy brown mustard instead of dry, dried parsley instead of fresh, and it still worked really well. Chicken was so tender and tasty! It even survived the microwave the next day!

This was excellent!  I cut the recipe in half to marinate 8 chicken breasts and that was plenty. It was very moist and juicy.  Next time, I might add some minced garlic or garlic powder.  Try this = you'll like it!

Fantastic, and so quick and easy. Just made this for the second time, and was able to whip it up in just a couple of minutes with my clingy 15-month old in my arms. I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand so I subbed balsamic, and it was very good. This makes chicken breasts - which are notorious for drying out on the grill - so juicy and tender - I will never BBQ them without this marinade again!

This was okay, but I think that most of the people who rated this a five must not have tried the Rosemary Ranch Chicken recipe on this site.  It's so much better than this one, and I was expecting something of that caliber.  Oh well, I won't make this again.

marinated overnight. The chicken was so salty and the strong mustard flavor added to the saltiness was not appetizing at all. Would not suggest this recipe unless you cut down the mustard and soy sauce or just try another recipe all together.

I wish I had time to marinate overnight for more pronounced flavor, but this was tasty after 4 hours.  I have just grilled the first boneless skinless breast which I pounded and pierced before marinating. I'm attempting a sauce with the leftover marinade, which I suspect I wouldn't need if the chicken had soaked up flavor all night. *Update* I had time to marinate overnight, and my chicken was moist and flavorful.  Delicious with potato salad, corn on the cob and a garden salad. I really like this recipe as is, but if you add a little garlic, it exceeds five stars.

WONDERFUL!  I was kind of nervous because of the very brown color, but it worked out great! So tasty and VERY moist and tender.  The only change that I will make next time, is either omit the salt or maybe just use 1/4 teaspoon.

Great marinade!  I only marinaded the chicken for 5 hours and I agree with other reviewers that over night would be even better.  The meat was very tender; served over couscous, it was really delicious. I didn't have parsley so I used chopped fresh chives - it was a good substitution.

I think this is the first time I have given anything one star off allrecipes.  It tasted vinegary and salty.... Will say the chicken legs marinated it in were a bit better, but still not that good.

I've been using All Recipes for almost 10 years now, and this is the first review I've ever left.  This one is so good, I had to review it.  This marinade is fantastic.  The chicken comes out, practically tasting like steak.

The only exceptions to the resume I made were EVOO instead of vegetable oil, and prepared dijon mustard instead of dry mustard (which I did not have on hand). It's a great marinade, and makes a lot, so just store it in the refrigerator until you need it again. I have also used this on veggies like red peppers and zucchini that I was cooking alongside the chicken. We are in an apartment so we can't grill, but I bet this would be great on the grill. As it was, I roasted the chicken (bone-in breasts, and trying bone-in thighs tonight) and it turned out great. I would recommend marinating it for more than a couple hours, which was all the time I had. I may try adding some fresh rosemary to the chicken when I cook it tonight.

This was awesome! I didn't have Red wine vinegar, so I used regular white, marinaded 6 chicken breasts for about 6 hours and grilled them to perfection.  My husband who uses salt and pepper, and my son who uses barbecue sauce for all things meat, thought it was to good to doctor up. 
Thank you!

Enhances the "grilled" flavor of chicken on the grill and keeps it nice and juicy, but doesn't give it much extra kick.  I halved the recipe and had plenty for 6 breasts, and marinaded for 12 hours.  I also omitted the salt.

I could not believe how good this chicken was.  Marinated bone in chicken thighs and served with Bada Bing Bada Banged Potatoes from this site.  One of my favorite meals in ages.  Will make again soon.

I used this marinade on chicken breast bone in with skin. Very good flavor! Next time I think I will marinate them longer, the flavor didn't reach the center of the breast.

I used this marinade for some chicken thighs we had on hand. I was tired of the same boring BBQ flavors. This was great! I love the flavors and will be using it again for 4th of July's BBQ! Thanks for sharing!  P.S. I didn't have hours to marinate it, but with just 1 hour a lot of flavor pulled through.

This was OK, but I've had others from this site without all the oil that had much better flavor.  Definitely needs to sit in the marinade for a long time.  The oil causes a lot of flare-ups on the grill.

This was very good.  I changed the serving size to 4 for two pieces of chicken and it was a good ratio.  The flavor was really good and we both enjoyed it!  And, it's easy!!

This is a winner!  I did not add any additional salt, there is PLENTY in soy sauce and W-sauce.  It's worth the smoke & flare ups when grilling.  Best done outside, to be sure.  It makes ~4 cups, and I used ~1 cup to marinate 6 boneless/skinless chicken breast halves.  Place them in a gallon sized bag, placed inside another container and the 1 cup of marinade is plenty to cover/coat the meat.  Definitely improves the longer you marinate.  I would also suggest using a vacuum sealer approach to marinading, too.  Would be even BETTER!

Excellent!  I used chicken tenders instead of chicken breast and I let it marinate for 3.5 hours.  My husband grilled them and despite his overcooking the chicken, they turned out great!  Our dinner guests loved them and they were great the next day added to a green salad!

Excellent marinade. I halved all of the ingredients and substitute EVOO for the vegetable oil, as I was only using 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves. I let it marinade in a ziploc bag for about 4 hours, then cut the chicken into even strips and skewered the chicken and grilled on the George Foreman 360 grill on med-high heat for about 8-10 minutes. Absolutely wonderful and tender, served with long grain rice, and English peas.

So good we marinated chicken and grilled out.  Hubby made chicken sandwiches with cheese, lettuce and mayo he loved it. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I subbed with A1, I also reduced the servings to 6 and had enough for 4 chicken breasts with some left over. would be great on veggies or steak and will use again!

This is now my family's most favorite marinade. To make it a little healthier we eye ball in only a tablespoon or two of olive oil and it still comes out great!

This marinade is SO good!  I love that is uses basic ingredients that almost anyone would already have on hand.  I have used it on chicken breasts and pork chops and they both came out fantastic.  The only change I made was to use apple cider vinegar because it was what I had on hand.  Will use this over and over.

I didn't think this marinade had much flavor. Probably due to the proportion of vegitable oil. I'd use less next time (if any) and marinade it much longer.

this was good. i changed a couple of things, i didn't have mustard powder so i used prepared mustard, i used apple cider vinegar instead of red wine because that's all i had. i also added onion powder, a couple of gloves of garlic, and monterey chicken seasoning. i like my chicken a little sweet so i added 1/4 cup of honey. i had 4 lbs of chicken and i had moren then enough marinade. baked it, because it's snowy and cold here in ny. turned out good...i'll make this again.

Well, it was definately flavorful. I planned on marinating for 5 hours, but plans changed, and I ended up letting it marinate overnight. I'm not sure if that was the problem, or what. There was too much salt. There's plenty of salt in the soy sauce, so I recommend omitting the extra tsp of salt altogether. I made it as it, and it was a LOT of marinade. I had 4 chicken breasts and could have easily halved the recipe and still had plenty. The flavor was almost too strong, so I don't recommend a overnight soaking. Not overly impressed though.

I had one large skinless boneless chicken breast left over from last night and decided to marinate it for tonight. I mixed this up and marinaded it for about 2 hours in the fridge. Then baked at 375 for 35 minutes. My boyfriend couldn't stop commenting about the wonderful smells coming from the kitchen, and it tasted just as good as it smelled! Who knew chicken breast could be so juicy and flavorful!

I made this recipe as published. Marinated chicken over night. Grilled on George Foreman.  Husband nor myself thought it was good. It didn't stand out. The chicken was very tender though. Thanks for the recipe, but will keep looking.

OH MY WORD!! This was wonderful! I let it marinate quite a while as our dinner plans had changed and I had to keep it another 2 nights. I thought it would over power the chicken and make it not work out. It was still very good- very flavorful, but not overly stated. Loved it. Definitely going to quit purchased the bottled stuff that has all the chemicals in it, and keep this on hand instead. Perfect!

Good stuff.  I used this for chicken when friends came in from Kansas City.  They were very skeptical because I didn't put barbeque sauce on the chicken, one bite and they were converted.

This was absolutely delicious. My husband is very picky and to him if chicken comes of the grill it better have some bbq sauce on it b4 he will eat it. But in this case he told me not to bother it was good all by its self. I did have to make a change bc I didn't have any red wine vinegar, so I just mixed half red cooking wine and half white distilled vinegar instead and t was still great!

This was good. Not the best I have ever had but really good. I will make again. I cook on the grill in tin foil to keep in the juices then move directly to grill for grill marks.

VERY good! This is definitely a large recipe so I cut it in half for 6 thighs. The longer you marinade (aka I didn't end up cooking it for 36 hours...so good!) the BETTER!!

Easy and fabulous.  I marinade chicken tenders with it and slap 'em on the grill.  Happy wife and kids for sure.  I just add a little fresh garlic.  Good stuff!

Excellent marinade! Easy to assemble, and really tasty.  I didn't have dry mustard, so I used 2 tsp of dijon. Will be making again.

Sensational - I used a syringe to inject the marinade into the chicken, 1 hour on the kitchen counter top is all I needed after the injection.  I prefer split breasts with the bone in for maximum flavor - added a little liquid smoke to the marinade too.  Delicious - thanks!

I made a half batch for 1.3 pounds boneless chicken breasts.  Would have been enough to marinate double that amount of chicken.

I find this recipe a little salty...but hey...I like salt!  The marinade is easy to make and does go a long way.  I usually make 3 breasts or chicken strips and need to cut the marinade recipe in half.  Good taste and would recommend letting it marinade overnight.  We have used the grill to cook the chicken and I have cooked it in the oven.  Both ways taste great!

This is a great marinade!  I recommend that you give it at least 24 hours.  I used this for 2.25 pounds of chicken (3 large breasts) but this easily could taken care of double that.  Would have been awesome for drumsticks.

Great flavor.  I was looking for a quick marinade for the legs and thighs we wanted to grill for dinner. I cut the recipe in half.  I had all the ingredients on hand except for fresh parsley so i used dried instead.  I was only able to marinade a couple of hours and the chicken was moist and flavorful.  Next time I will let it sit overnight.  I think this would work great on pork also.

This is a delightful marinade.  This is the second time using, now modified (but still 4 stars) ...I used olive oil, low sodium soy, no additional salt, prepared mustard, no parsley, added : honey, herbes de Provence, garlic & lots of love.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I have been using this marinade for quite a few months now and it is WONDERFUL!  I have marinated the chicken over night and also marinate for only a few hours and both ways were great. I always use Cider Vinegar and usually use dried parsley, since I rarely have fresh on hand.  This marinade is a keeper and recommended!

I didn't have lemon juice or ground mustard in the house so I had to do without. It was still amazing and juicy. Next time I will add the lemon juice and ground mustard and marinate over night and see how that works. But this still worked out well!

The whole family loves this recipe!  The chicken is really moist and it doesn't need to marinate long for great flavor. The last time I made this recipe, it only marinated for 30 minutes while the charcoal grill was heating up and it was very flavorful. And any recipe my 5 and 4 year old boys rave about get 5 stars!

I'm undecided on this rating.  I personally wasn't thrilled with it, but the hubby and kids liked it, so I'm giving it four stars, but I think this is being generous. :)  The chicken was very moist (I think this is what the kids liked about it), but I thought the taste wasn't anything to rave about.  I did reduce the oil to make it healthier, but I don't think that would have affected the flavor too much.  Maybe it would have been better without the Worchestershire sauce???  I probably won't make it again unless the kids personally request it.

This is a great marinade and I'll be using it for all my grilled chicken. It's easy and I always have everything on hand. Chicken always turns out juicy and flavorful.

This was absolutely amazing.  I made this marinade for a birthday BBQ and got rave reviews on my chicken.  The chicken was so tender and flavorful that it almost melted in your mouth.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using low sodium soy sauce and oil olive.  I will use this recipe everytime for now on.  Tip:  make sure you change your serving size to reflect how much you will need.

My son who always "hates" chicken, loved it and asked for more! The meat is tender and moist. Simple yet tasty marinade. I recommend this easy recipe.

All I have to say about this is that is was delicious! The only thing I did different was I used regular yellow mustard as I didn't have dried!! The chicken was very tender and had a great taste!! We will be making this many times over the summer months on the BBQ!! Cheers!!

Absolutely delicious! I made this marinade exactly as the recipe stated. I wouldn't change a thing about it--I think it's perfect. Used it for chicken, which I marinated overnight and grilled for guests. Everyone raved about it!

Very easy and tasty marinade. Definitely made enough to last a few more meals. I used it on chicken breasts that we grilled and it came out perfect. Marinated chicken for about 2 hours, next time I'll try a little longer.

Not sure if I didn't make enough to soak the chicken but it was not very tender, it was tasty but next time I will make more (i cut down the recipe for 2 chicken breasts) and see if it works better.

It was almost time to throw the chicken on the grill when I decided a marinade might be good.  I quickly chose this one, and didn't bother to measure anything, just guessed and threw it in the bag with the chicken and mixed it up and pounded the meat a little.  It didn't sit in the bag for more than 5-6 minutes before my husband was ready for it...it was Delicious!!!  What a treat!

Yum! I don't keep dry mustard on hand, so I used some spicy mustard instead. I marinated the chicken overnight, and it was very flavorful and juicy.

I ommited the salt and used dried parsely. I mixed the marinade with 6 chicken legs and 2 thighs (bone-in, skin on) and it sat in our cooler until Saturday night. We were camping and cooked it on the grill. It had great color - very rich and golden. The flavor was good, but I think that it lacked garlic. I will add several cloves of crushed garlic cloves next time. It was overall a very good recipe and the chicken was moist and packed with flavor.

I'm giving this four stars because the chicken was very moist and tender but it really didn't have much flavor for me.  I probably wont use this again.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I was short on time, so it only had 2 hrs. to marinate. It was great, but will marinate longer next time.  I would use olive oil rather than vegetable, and it doesn't need as much oil as the recipe calls for.  I used lite soy sauce and cider vinegar rather than red wine vinegar.  Don't add salt to this recipe.  Experimenting with rice wine vinegar is yummy, too - but only a little as rice wine vinegar is pretty strong.

Fantastic!  I used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil and lite soy sauce.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  1/4 of the recipe is the perfect amount for 1 lb. of boneless breasts.

Wasnt sure about this marinade but I gave it a try anyway-didn't care for it at all. Soy sauce and lemon juice do not mix well in my opinion.

What a versatile recipe - a wonderful foundation on which to base lots of different marinades!  I made 1/2 recipe of this for the first time on Sunday, and have made two meals: one was chicken breasts with extra garlic and oregano for an italian-style menu, and the second time a flank steak with srichacha sauce and ginger that I grilled and added to noodles and stir-fried vegies to make a noodle bowl (boiled the left-over marinade for the sauce).  Both were excellent.  I think I will do as one reviewer suggested and make a full batch of this and keep in the 'frig so I always have a base.  Thanks for a great starting point for lots of weekday meals!

Very good marinade! I used whole chickens and roasted like described in the sticky roasted chicken recipe, for 5 hours at 250 degrees. Turned out wonderfully!! Definitely will be a staple recipe for our house, thanks!

This was great!  I buy chicken breasts on sale, pound them a bit to make flatter and more uniform, then freeze them on waxed paper.  When they're frozen, I put them in a freezer bag and use as needed (which is often because they're quick and easy).  Today I marinaded two in this marinade and grilled them on our indoor grill.  They were tender and seasoned just right!  I am so glad to have found this recipe!  I only cook for the two of us and we didn't use much of the marinade, so I put the rest in a jar for the future (which will probably be tomorrow).  Oh, and another thing I liked about this marinade is that I only marinated the chicken for three hours and they were great!

Yum! Quick, easy, and I had just about all the ingredients on hand. I used dijon mustard b/c I didn't have dry and used dried parsley b/c I didn't have fresh. I only marinated the meat for 20 min. b/c I was in a rush, but this marinade made delicious chicken burgers! I will try this for the grill and kabobs. Thanks!

People use to love my raspberry-chipotle BBQ chicken.  When I served it with this recipe, the "marinade for chicken" all went, but the raspberry-chipotle had some left.  Everyone loved this recipe. Will definitely use it again.

This is delish. I cooked it on my George Foreman grill which I usually don't do with chicken, since it cooks it too fast an makes it tougher, and it was still nice and juicy!! I even marinaded mine for a couple days and it turned out great. I did substitute with olive oil, reduced sodium soy sauce, regular yellow mustard, and omitted the salt. I suggest making the 32 servings but keep what you don't use for later. Also...I marinaded green bell peppers, tomato, and onion and grilled them and they were amazing!

Not bad. A little too thin though. Next time I'll marinade overnight instead of just a few hrs.

Very tasty! Marinaded overnight and put the chicken on the BBQ. I even used the left overs for a chicken salad the next day. Yummy!

Comes out AMAZINGLY tender. Threw all the ingredients into a ziplock bag and left in the fridge for about 6 hours. BBq'd on low heat, basting chicken every 5 minutes or so, flipped once, then turned the heat up to crisp it up a tad right before it was done. I can't tell you how amazing the taste is! I've looked for a good marinade for quite some time and I FINALLY found one. Melts in your mouth! Thank you!

Exceptional recipe.   The flavors that marinade in the chicken are wonderful.   It’s best served after grilling the chicken.   This recipe will work with steak as well!

This was a great recipe.  I didn't use mustard powder (because I didn't have any)but it was great with my chicken! This is a good base recipe with many possible variations depending on your tastes.  I will definitley be using again :)

This recipe is so versatile.  I had to substitute with what I had on hand to get dinner on the table. I used olive oil, not vegetable. I had no lemon, so I used orange juice.  I had no red wine vinegar, so I used white wine vinegar.  Left out the parsley so my kids wouldn't complain about the little green things.  Still an amazing marinade.  As long as you keep the ratios of acid, oils, and spices - use whatever you have on hand!

My mom had shoulder surgery and can't really cook so I've been cooking some things for the past week, but I've never really cooked and I just made really simple stuff. Then today I had to work so I marinated chicken for my sister to grill and I used this recipe after searching google. I saw that some people thought it was too spicy, so i just put 1/2 cup of soy sauce instead of 3/4 and it was really great! thanks!

Great marinade.  The recipe makes a lot.  The second time I used it I halved the recipe since I was only using enough meat for my husband and I.

much too salty.  may make again but omit the extra salt, because the soy sauce makes it salty enough.

Great recipe and so easy!! Marinated chicken breasts for only 2 hours, but that was enough.  Made a few adjustments since I did not have all the items required.  Used apple cider vinegar instead of red wine, substituted fresh lime juice instead of lemon(less acid with vinegar), and green onion instead of parsley.  My husband loved it and so did my 21/2 year old.  It was so moist, will definately use this recipe again.

Truly scrumptious! We tried this first on turkey cutlets - started the marinade the night before and grilled them the next evening (turned them once in the morning and again early afternoon) - they were melt-in-your-mouth perfect.

First off, I adjusted the recipe for 6 servings since I didn't need 32, lol.  I thought this was a great tasting marinade!  I've used a couple from this site, but this one really seemed to permeate the chicken but wasn't overpowering.  Just a little "something something" that made it taste great.  I made very small changes based on what I had on hand (used about 1 tsp of Grey Poupon Country Dijon mustard in place of dry mustard), omitted salt since I wasn't using a reduced sodium soy sauce, used 1/2 the pepper called for in the "6 servings" recipe, and I added in some chopped green onion because I had it on hand.   Other than that (and those were very minor changes, imo), I stuck with the recipe/ingredients.   It was marinated for about 3 hours too, so not a real long time, so I was very pleased with the flavor.   Thumbs up!

Wow! What a great recipe! I marinated the chicken for about four hours and it was so tender and flavorful. Everyone was asking for the recipe. I think it will be even better with steak and can't wait to try that. Definitely going in my "keeper binder!"

A wonderful blend of flavors.I marinated chicken for about 2 hours and both my wife and myself thought it was the best baked chicken. I chopped 2 cloves of garlic and added to the sauce. The next time I make this,I'm going to make a double batch and store 1 batch in the fridge in a mason jar for future use. Thank you so much for the recipe.It really deserves 10 stars,thanks again.

This marinade was outstanding with the addition of crushed garlic, red pepper flakes, and double the fresh parsley.  I let it marinade for about 7 hours - we could tell it would be great once we pulled the chicken breasts out of the plastic baggie and put them on the grill.  The finished project was savory and juicy - received many compliments - will definitly add this to my recipe box!

Great Marinade!!! I used it on chicken, grilled the chicken on my george foreman, then put it over a bed of fettacini alfredo and it was a great blend.  Unlike most marinades this was not over powering, in my opinion it was just right.

I was at my daughter's house for Mother's Day and she served her chicken kabobs with the wonderful maranade on it. It was hands down the best maranade I have ever eaten. I have already given it to many people. Every flavor came through the chicken and made the chicken very moist. Will definately make this again, trying it on different cuts of meat.

YUM!  Made the marinade this afternoon (half the recipe) and threw in a clove of crushed garlic.  Poured it over some chicken tenderloins, let it sit for a few hours, then grilled.  Came out moist, flavorful, and delicious.  I'll definetly make this again.  Better tasting and much cheaper than grocery store marinades.

This was very good. I marinated the chicken all day and barbecued it. Very tender and tasty. 

I didn't use the mustard (didn't have any) and only had dried parsley. I did add a couple of cloves of crushed garlic. I will make this again.

The chicken turned out very moist.  The flavor was excellent.  I used half vegetable oil and half EVOO (extra virgin olive oil), added more lemon juice because I really prefer it that way. I also used part low sodium part regular soy sauce. I let it marinade for about 4 hours.  Great recipe!

Spicy brown mustard works as a fine substitute for the dried mustard.  I also have added a splash of red wine.  Great recipe!

I really enjoyed this marinade.  I would suggest using large chicken breasts when doing this.  I used thinner pieces and the soy sauce seemed to come accross very strongly.  I will definitely use this recipe again, but with larger pieces of chicken or less soy sauce.

The flavor was good.
I used skinless chicken cut into chunks and sauteed in the pan with fresh garlic and scallions.
Next time I will use it on whole bone-in chicken breast and grill it.
Yum !

My family absolutely loved this marinade. I didn't even have any left overs and I usually do!!! The only thing I did different is that I put in some prepared mustard instead of the dry mustard (couldn't find it in my messy pantry). I just can't say enough about it!!! Thanks for the post!!!!!

made enough for 8 chicken breasts at least.  Use low sodium soy sauce next time.  a nice change if you need something quick because you should have most of the ingredients on hand.

I agreed with other reviewers - this made chicken juicy and tender, so that was great.  I marinaded chicken all day, so was a little disappointed that the flavour wasn't as strong as I expected.  Nevertheless, I intend to make this again.  Thank-you for submitting it!

I reduced this marinade to 8 servings and used it for 3 large chicken breasts.  I didn't have any dry mustard so I just used prepared mustard and threw in about 1 tablespoon of fresh parsley.  I didn't have much time before dinner, so I put it all in a bag and let it sit in the fridge for 20 mins. Even after that little bit of time, this turned out very flavorful. I did brush some on the breasts as they cooked on the grill.  I'm going to keep this one on the year-round menu!  Although next time I think I'll skip the salt (personal preference).

I have made this marinade several times this summer and everyone always asks for the recipe.  It is easy to make, and is not overpowering but lends a delicious flavor to the chicken which grills up tender and juicy every time.

I thought this was ok, although didn't get what all the fuss was about. It was relatively moist after grilling and the flavor was ok. I guess I'm looking for wow.

This marinade was wonderful!!  I used it on chicken drumsticks and grilled them.  It reminded me a lot of the Kiwanis Chicken Barbeque you might see on the weekends.  I received many compliments from my family members too!

I used this for chicken and it was very good, but had some left over and marinated some salmon I was going to grill at the same time.  It was amazing.  My husband and son can't get enough.

This is a must if you are grilling.  The flavors combine beautifully together.  I only had time to marinade    2 hours, I think I might try a little longer next time.  My husband said he would give it 10 stars.

Good flavor- a little salty though! I decreased the recipe to fit four servings, but I ended up having to double it anyway for two (quite)large chicken breasts.

Really great! Made this with chicken thighs and marinated 24 hours. No one flavor really stood out, but it was very good.

This was our favorite chicken marinade this summer!  I eat blsl chicken breasts and my husband and kids prefer bone-in skin-on thighs and drumsticks.  I would usually marinade them all together for 8-10 hours and we were never dissapointed.  I did like some of the previous posters said, and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup per batch of marinade.  THANKS!

My husband requests this marinade everytime we have chicken!  We use boneless skinless breasts, and they always come out flavorful and juicy.  We don't always think about marinating the chicken well in advance, but even grilling after only a half hour in the marinade, the chicken turns out beautifully.  This recipe is a definite keeper in our recipe box!

Very good.  Let mine marinade for about 5 hours.  Did not think they were salty at all.  Pounded the chicken breasts first and they came out very tender.  Thanks

We ate this chicken but thought it would be more moist and flavorful than it actually was, considering all the ingredients it had.  I will not be making this again.  I did follow the recipe exactly.  It does make a large amount of marinade.

I used this marinade on butterflied pork chops.  I only marinated them for 8 hours.  Everyone loved them.  So juicy and tender.  Great flavor.  Will make again for sure.

Very good marinade!  I did as others suggested and cut the oil in half and it turned out great.  I also cut down on the lemon juice a bit and did add a little brown sugar as others did-would make again!

I usually find soy based marinades kind of disappointing, but this one is delicious!  I decreased the amount of oil and used "lite" soy (personal preference b/c of salt) and added a bit of Splenda.  Really, really good and highly recommended!  Thank you.

This recipe is amazing!!!  I have made it many times especially when having guests.  Everyone loves it!  I do reduce the lemon juice amount to 1/4 cup.  I have never included the parsley.
The only issue I have is that I feel like I am being wasteful because this makes so much marinade.  I think I will try to half the recipe for the marinade in the future for 6 chicken breasts.

As at least one other person pointed out, this makes quite a bit of marinade, but it is very good. I had some left over and kept it in the reefer until the next time. Thanks for a great marinade.

This marinade resulted in very moist, flavorful chicken off the grill.  I didn't have fresh parsley on hand, so I left it out, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Delicious!  Will definitely be using this recipe often this summer!

Wow.  Fantastic marinade.  I halved the recipe and still only used ~1/4C oil for 3 very large bone-in chicken breasts.  Left the chicky to soak in this savory concoction overnight, then slow roasted on the grill over indirect heat the next day.  Moist.  Flavorful.  Perfect.  Thanks!

This marinade was fantastic! Taste similar to nelsons' chicken, yum.  For some reason I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce so i used a splash of  A1 sauce, i also followed others' advice and omitted the salt, I didn't miss either of them.

I thought it was way to salty, but....I also used chicken tenders and left them marinating for about 30hrs due to a change in schedule. I will try again and not marinate for more than a couple of hours max.

Fantastic!  Makes your chicken taste like steak!  I used lime juice instead of lemon juice, added garlic powder and eliminated the parsley.  I'm sure it would have been just as great without changing a thing!

Chicken marinated for a couple of days.  Nice flavor and juicy.  I brushed leftovers with buffalo sauce and made sandwiches.

By far one of the best marinades I have ever made for chicken. I only marinaded for about an hour and still the flavor was beyond excellent.  Simple and delicious, I will definately use this one again and again!  Thanks for sharing this with us, Jill!

WOW!!  We all loved this - didn't have red wine vinegar, but just used red wine and a little extra lemon juice.  Grilled boneless breasts and it was terrific.  Note:  this makes A LOT of marinade.  I 1/4'rd the recipe and it was still plenty for a whole package of boneless breasts.  YUM!  Thanks Jill!

Thank you, Thank you.  My picky 4 year old who never eats his meat, ate every bite.  I loved it too.

Very versatile, and VERY good. I ran out of soy sauce, and substitutions of cider and balsamic vinegars worked extremely well. I added 2 cloves pressed garlic and marinated pounded chicken for about an hour. Print & keep this one!

It was too salty and I didn't even add the salt.  The soy sauce was too strong and the mixture kept separating from the oil.

This was excellent!  We only had time to marinate for about 2 hours, but it still was great.
