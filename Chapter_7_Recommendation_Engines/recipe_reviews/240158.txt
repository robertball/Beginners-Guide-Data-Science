Far too much syrup for this quantity of potatoes. Heating then cooling just ends with the yams being very soft on the outside and very firm on the inside. I would recommend dicing the yams and spreading them on the pan without any pre-baking. If you do go the pre-baking route note that it varies by size. Smaller yams will have to be pulled out well ahead of the larger ones. 35 minutes is also way too long for just heating the yams through.

Tastes great and adds just a touch more oomph to the normal dish and the directions worked great for me!

I don’t know what I did wrong, but these didn’t turn out for me. The syrup never thickened up and the yams came out swimming in liquid brown sugar. If I made this again I’d probably exclude the orange juice and add a bit of corn starch to help thicken up the syrup.

The recipe itself was good, it was a little too sweet. Next time I think I would cut down on the brown sugar. But other than that it was a good recipe ;))

I didn't use the orange juice but substituted water instead. It turned out delicious.   Just had a few for left-overs.

As previous people have stated, it made a lot of syrup.  Was a little too orange juicy for me.  Cut the recipe in half, added ginger and cinnamon and made with a mix of oj and mango juice.  Yummy.  I like the idea of baking the yams ahead of time, I cut them up and then let them soak in the syrup until I bake it.  Great recipe for kids to make.
