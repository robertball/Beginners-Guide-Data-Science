These cookies are so delicious!  The cocoa powder makes a tasty light texture, and the occasional piece of apricot is a real flavor bonus.  So easy to make ahead, bakes and cools quickly.  I gave these as office gifts and everyone just loved them!  They will be a new holiday tradition for us.

Really enjoyed these!!! :) I divided the recipe in 4, just because I am going to be the only one eating these... LOL! So when I divided it into 4, I should have used a half an egg, or less. These came out quite fluffy. But that was my own fault. Still yummy. I feel like they could have been a bit more chocolately.  Definitely will make this again!

I thought these cookies were just okay. I found the recipe in my recipe box and was looking for a recipe to use some apricot preserves and just made 1/2 recipe. I didn't understand the method of folding it into a block or why, so I just used a cookie scoop and scooped it. I was expecting so much more taste wise with the idea of chocolate, almonds, apricot. It just tasted like a "brownie with fruit and nuts" in the shape of a flat chewy cookie. The chocolate pieces melted right into it creating a gummy cookie, along with the fruit, with odd bits of almonds. The texture was just strange to me, unless it is my preference. Maybe, I was just expecting more than a brownie.

Wonderful cookies!  I chopped the chocolate and almonds in the food processor to make it easier.  Loved the convenience of making the dough ahead and then baking them off when I wanted.   I sprinkled the top with some sanding sugar before baking.  I bit hit in our house.  Think I have to make another batch very soon!

Tasty crispy cookies. I thought the preserves I had were apricot... they were peach,  so I used that. Next time I want to try raspberry in the recipe.
