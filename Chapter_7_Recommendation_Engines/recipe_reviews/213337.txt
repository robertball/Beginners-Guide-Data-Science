Made this for St. Paddys and everyone loved it.  So filling and rich, but so, so delicious!  I must confess, however, that I did start by frying up about a half pound of bacon, and then sauted the cabbage, leeks and onions in the bacon grease, and added the bacon back in the dish before baking.  Boy, that was decadent and fattening, but divine!  The whole family loved this and have been asking me to make it again.

Perhaps you meant 3 pounds versus 3 potatoes?  This was delicious...I added 10 oz of chopped ham to make it a one course meal.  Would make again...

My potatoes were kind of small (organic reds) so I used a few more. I didn't have bouillion cubes but I did have chicken Better than bouillion so I used a couple teaspoons of that. Because I always make colcannon with bacon, I did add a half pound of cooked, crumbled turkey bacon. This was super yummy--we all enjoyed it quite a bit. A new unique way to eat colcannon!

VERY GOOD! I did add a little extra salt and pepper, but that was my own preference. I would definately make this more often than just on St. Patrick's Day, and I intend to! Also, I did assemble this the night before and just baked it off the next day...it worked out perfectly! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great recipe!  I used 2 bags of shredded hashbrowns instead of mashed potatoes.  Chopped medium head of cabbage with 4 leeks, sauteed in olive oil with salt till tender.  Combined with uncooked hash browns and other ingredients (except bouillon because I had none ) added some garlic powder and paprika.  I put cheese inside the mixture, added some extra on top at the end of baking.  Went well with pork chops.

Thank you so much for posting a recipe that actually sounds like Colcannon. I have always prepared or purchased in an Irish pub Colcannon that is made with Irish bacon, two kinds of cabbage and BAKED. That's the only way I have ever had it. I don't know what to call the other socalled Colcannon recipes I saw on this website.

Turned out very good, with a nice flavor. I used 5 large potatoes (Costco size), and also put 5 crushed garlic cloves in with the potatoes. Next time I think I will add some bacon.

Yummy!  Made this last night to go with the corned beef for our "early" St. Patrick's day supper.  Used kale instead of cabbage (my preference), used 10 very small white rose potatoes (all I had), and added about 1/2 lb. bacon, diced and cooked crispy.  Forgot to add the bit of milk -oops!  Came out perfect!  Just fit into my large Pyrex deep-dish pie plate.  Hubby loved the addition of the bacon, and the leeks added a nice bit of sweetness.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I doubled this and took it to a St Patty's Day Potluck, and it was a huge hit! 4 people asked for the recipe.  I left out the leeks, but other than that followed it exactly.  I made it up the night before, then baked it just before the party.  It was delicious!

Tried this one for St. Patties day and am SO glad I did!  YUMMM!  I will definitely make this again~often!  Followed the recipe (except didn't use leeks)...used about 10-12 red potatoes and a med size head of cabbage, (+generous salt & pepper).  Even took some leftovers to work today and was a hit!  Can't wait to try with bacon next time!

Frugal food at its finest! ... I used leftover mashed potatoes, a quarter head of cabbage that had been sitting in the fridge for 2 months, the green top part of leeks that I had leftover from another dish, and bacon strips left over from last week's breakfast. (plus the other ingredients). Almost all from leftovers, and it STILL tasted terrific! You really can't go wrong with this one :-) Thanks so much for posting the recipe.

I made this for St. Patty's day and we really enjoyed it.  So now I know I'm a leek fan! The only change I made was adding bacon, but next time I think I'll do cornbeef or ham. To me it fit better as a brunch dish. Enjoy!

This was very good!  I made a corned beef in the crock pot with carrots and this went with it great! I followed the recipe to a T, except I had some bacon crumbles so I threw them in for added flavor. At first I was a little worried because when I mashed the potatoes they seemed too runny, but as they baked they thickened up nicely.  I will be making this again.

Great idea and a tasty dish.  I used kale, and the store didn't have leeks so I used green onions.  I added shredded cheese to the potato mixture, and because I was short on time and needed to get dinner on the table, I used frozen mashed potatoes.  I omitted the butter and milk as the potatoes already contained them.  The end result was a hit, and Next time I'll try with cabbage and fresh potatoes.

Odd how taste buds can change when you get older. When I was a kid I hated cooked cabbage and onions. But then nobody ever made this around here, because I probably would have felt differently. This was a treat and I will certainly make every now and then. Next time will add corned beef. Thanks!

This will be my healthier alternative to scalloped potatoes.  I had some left over ham and added maybe 1/2 cup of it to the recipe, used small red potatoes with the skins on for more nutrition & color, and used a coleslaw/carrot ready mix. Also used vegetable broth because I had it on hand & it enabled me to cut down on the butter.  It was very colorful & a bit healthier with these changes - but as I stated in the beginning, this turned into an alternative to scalloped potatoes.  I will follow the directions "as is" for the next Irish meal that I make.

Delicious and very comforting. I didn't use the leeks and added some polksa kielbasa in with the cabbage and onion while it was cooking. I think the amount of potatoes is wrong in the recipe!!!

I was a little confused about the recipe calling for 3 potatoes. Maybe it turned out so dry because I used a couple more. 3 wouldn't have fed 8 people. At the end of the day, except for the ol' raw egg debate you could get away without even baking this. Suppose that would defeat the purpose of the name. Sorry, this just wasn't my favourite colcannon recipe. Glad I tried it though.  Thanks Chardonnay Queen.

Great recipe. I am a huge fan of leeks and potatoes. Whenever I can combine them in a recipe, I do. I made this exactly as directed (which is the only way that you should if you are to review it) and thought it was outstanding. Change nothing and keep up the awesome meals.

Made it without eggs so substituted flour to bind. Hd it with salmon. Worked well as a side dish. It's not a star dish that you buld a meal around in my mind but a good dish for complementing meat dishes. Would make a great dish to take to a potluck dinner or to sneal greens into kids :).

I was looking for a recipe to use up some cabbage and found this one. I didn't have sour cream, leeks or chicken bouillon, so I used mayo and onion. Also added some bacon. It was really good. I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe for the first time last St. Patrick's Day (2012)and again just last night. Yum-O! I did do some slight changes... Used 4 potatoes instead of 3. Used an entire cube of butter and 3 cubes of the chicken bouillon.  Also, for step #3 I fried up 1/2 lb. of bacon first, once cooked, I then added the cabbage, leeks and onions directly to the pan with the bacon grease.  I believe I read this suggestion by another reviewer last year and tried it this year.  Wow, it sure adds to the flavor!  Everyone absolutely loved this as our "starchy" side dish as apposed to the traditional red pototes served with corned beef and cabbage.  I also forgot about the first 40 min. baking time and cooked it probably another 10-15 on top of that without realizing it.  It was perfect and crispy on top, not burnt at all. Then I added the cheese and gave it just enough time to melt the cheese.  This will be our traditional "side" for St. Patrick's Day from here on out!!!  (Oh, one last thing, as far as the prep time, it took a lot longer for me, but well worth the effort!!!)

This is a delicious recipe. I didn't have leeks, so I just added extra cabbage. I used about 5 large potatoes rather than the 3 that the recipe requires.

I didn't have time to bake it, so did everything but the cheese (plus I'm trying to watch my girlish figure!) and it was a huge hit! Next time, I'm going to take the time and bake it with the cheese - I think it will be an even bigger hit (if possible). Thanks, Chardonnay Queen (BTW, love the name!).

Absolutely fabulous!  I added some chopped ham at the end, a little paprika and garlic powder.  Replaced mashed taters with frozen hashbrowns like other reviewers said, and skipped on the boullion.  Also used scallions cuz that's what I had on hand.  SOOOOO good!

A real winner.  My only addition was some rutabaga and leeks I had in the 'fridge.  I shared this with my CSA friends, and every one of them agreed it's a keeper.  I served it as a side to bratwurst for a hearty winter dinner.

A great hearty casserole.  I used pre-packaged shredded cabbage, which cut down on some of the prep time.

Everyone loved this.  Great recipe to make ahead of time and pop in the oven for dinner.  Went terrific as is with the corned beef.  Next time I make it I will add ham and bacon to make it a complete meal in itself.

This was a great side with corned beef today for Paddy's Day. I did make a few changes. I used about 6 med.-large potatoes and about 1/2 cup of warm milk. I also omitted the bouillon cubes as I used some bacon instead for some great flavor. While the potatoes were cooking, I fried up about 1/2 lb of bacon and used some reserved bacon grease to saute the sweet onion and shredded cabbage. After 40 minutes bake time, I sprinkled the bacon and topped with cheese for the last 10 minutes. I did find it slightly dry and will add more cream next time. Even cabbage haters will enjoy this! Great recipe.

this was delicious.  I made it for St. Patrick's Day and am making again to go with lamb chops and asparagus for Easter dinner.  My son-in-law and husband both raved.  I did use the 5 potatoes as suggested in another review.  This goes in my permanent recipe collection.

OMG! This was sooooo good. I added some turmeric to cabbage, leeks, and onion. I used red potatoes. I left some lumps in the potatoes and that gave a little more texure my cabbage was prepared with a little crunch also.

Absolutely amazing! Wonderful comfort food that will be a regular on my table from now on. Great any time of year. I sauteed my cabbage and onions in a cast iron skillet, added the potatoes, and baked in the cast iron. Great flavor.

It was a hit at our couple's get together.  I made it with 3 pounds of potatoes, 6 cups of shredded cabbage and only 3 tablespoons of butter.  Keep all the other ingredients the same.  It is a keeper.

This was really good. We like our cheese mixed inside so that’s what I did. Really good that way. I didn’t have leeks or onions so I added extra cabbage.

Tasted like a poor version of Twice baked potatoes.   Followed directions to a T and you could not taste cabbage, leeks, butter or anything but a dried mashed potato.

The only change I made is the type of shredded cheese, I used Oaxaca because I already had it.  It blends in with the pic, but I assure you there is cheese.  This came out a little bit dry, I would double the sour cream next time.  I had already doubled the milk.

Made this delicious dish today pretty much as written except I added 4 slices crumbled and cooked bacon. I used a little of the bacon grease instead of adding oil to cook the onions, cabbage and added some caraway seeds to this mixture. This is a wonderful dish and thanks for the recipe. Great with corned beef or tonight with meatloaf! YUM!                                                                                          CO Karen

Delicious!!  My husband claims it was right up there with the gourmet potatoes I make and he LOVES those.  I made a larger batch so the amount of ingredients may have been off, but it is a forgiving recipe and I used all the ingredients it called for.  I have only cooked with leeks once and that would be a mistake to leave them out. Yum! Had this with corned beef and carrots. It also worked great as a make ahead.  Will definitely make again!

This was Awesome!!  I used 5 red potatoes with the skins on and a half head of cabbage.  I didn't have sour cream, so I pulled from another recipe, and used 4 oz cream cheese in the potatoes.  I didn't have leeks.  I did add some chopped garlic to the cabbage & onions as it cooked.  I had 6 slices of turkey bacon left over from breakfast so chopped that & threw it in too.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan and  I will be making this in place of hashbrown casserole in the future!!

The family loved this recipe. After reading several of the other reviews on this, I did add in about 8 pieces of crispy bacon chopped up, and used 6-7 potatoes instead of 3. Otherwise I followed the recipe and everyone loved it!

Very good!  I basically followed the recipe, but added some leftover chicken I had in the fridge to make it a complete meal.  I enjoyed several helpings and the older children liked it.  (The younger kids did not like the stringy cabbage hiding in the mashed potatoes, but all ate without much complaint!)

Excellent recipe. The only question I have if the recipe is meant for 3lbs of potatoes? Because I normally use 6-8 potatoes, and it comes out creamy, and delicious.

My husband, who thinks he doesn't like cabbage, enjoyed this dish enough to eat it for days. Like others, I added a small cubed ham. What a great way to use up a cabbage!

Ok, of all the dishes I made for St. Pats day, this one disappeared as fast as the beer cheese soup!  Great recipe.  I added cheese to the casserole prior to baking then of course put it on top in the final bake.

I followed the directions as printed but added the bacon as suggested by other reviews, it was delicious.  I took it to a potluck and came home with an empty dish and lots of compliments.  5 stars for sure.

This was a HUGE hit with my family on St. Patrick's day!!  The only think I changed was I browned 5 slices of bacon and cooked the cabbage\leek\onion mixture in 1 TBS of the drippings then added the crumbled bacon to the colcannon before baking.  Will definitely be making this again!!

This was really good and a hit on St. Patricks Day with corned beef.  I didn't use as much butter as it called for, I used about 1 T. for potatoes and one T. for cabbage and it was still great!

This turned out be the best St. Patrick's Day, food wise, EVER!!!!  The colcannon turned out awesome.  Best way to use cabbage we ever tasted.  Also used the Corned Beef Sandwich recipe from this site using 2 cans of beer, peppercorns, garlic, bay leaves and a little water in the slow cooker.  Cooked some carrots in the corned beef water while the beef was resting and, well, just plain perfection.  Glad I doubled the corned beef and colcannon......leftovers.....YIPPEE!!

Made this today - not a fan - found it to be dry (even though I added more milk and sour cream)  and too strong of an onion flavor.

Wonderful to see a Colcannon recipe! I have been making it for my family for well over 30 years after learning it in the kitchen of my great grandmother, a first generation Irish American. Hers always had Irish bacon and years later I substituted corned beef as a way to use my St. Patrick's day leftovers. Now I make 2-3 times more than is necessary for our St. Paddy's day dinner so that we can have homemade corned beef hash and colcannon from the leftovers. I gave this recipe 4 stars because the authentic dish includes bacon which gives a whole mother flavor dimension.
