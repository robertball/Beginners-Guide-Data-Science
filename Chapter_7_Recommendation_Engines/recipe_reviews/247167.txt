I used fresh, locally-grown Ohio peaches and organic vanilla bean ice cream. Also took the liberty to drizzle some caramel sauce on these, because, why not?! Ah-may-zing!!

These were so easy and awesome!  We were at a community grill so we didn't have the ice cream instead I put a little cinnamon and some granola and everyone loved them!  Makes my mouth water thinking of them.  Seriously try it.

Yup! Put some vanilla ice cream and a couple mint leaves on it.
