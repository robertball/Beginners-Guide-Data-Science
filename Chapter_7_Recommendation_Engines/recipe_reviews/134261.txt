I took the idea from this recipe but changed a few things. I used a bag of dried Chile Colorado, poached it with the tomatoes and garlic cloves, added about a cup of water and blended it with a chicken boullin instead of tomato boullin. Then I added it to the chopped chuck and let it simmer for 15 minutes, it was AWESOME! I am now going to use this same adjusted recipe for sauce for enchiladas!

This was excellent, it had an outstanding flavor to it and we all enjoyed it, I will certainly cut my meat a little smaller and consider simmering the sauce and meat in a crock pot to let everything simmer in together. I simmered the meat and sauce on low for an hour waiting for my husband to get home for dinner and it was great! This will make it into our dinner meal rotation!

This is a great recipe! I love it. I originally found this recipe because I was looking for beef recipes with less than 300 calories and this was on the list. To cut down on the calories even more...I used olive oil instead of the vegetable oil which is much better for you! Thanks so much!

Very good. My dad was known for his carne con chile. He will roast the chile de arbol peppers in a pan, then blend them and keep them on hand. I also added tomatoe sauce and alittle water/chicken stock at the end with some flour to ticken it up.

This recipe was easy and tasted great. I added chopped up potatoes to mine which made it even better.

Simple and yummy! Made it with side of mash potatoes. The beef let out a lot of water and I thought it would steam and not cook right but it was just perfect. I put the sauce in as soon as the beef changed color (turned it around too). Three minutes after that it was all done. Oh, and I cooked the garlic with the sauce before putting in the blender.

This recipe is so yummy. I had been making carne con chile with slight differences, I tried this way though and I liked it a lot better. You serve it with refried beans, orange rice , slices of avocado to another side and warm flour tortillas and it is absolutely amazing !!!

I make it as is with the exception that I add an extra tomato because my family loves pouring the sauce over mexican rice. Here are my tips:1. Use carne de pulpa (or pulpa negra) you can find this at any mexican grocery store, it's better than flank for this recipe.2. I don't cook the meat all the way through before adding the sauce. Once you put the meat in the pan with the oil, cover it. This allows for the meats juices to be released, once I see the juice released I add the sauce, it really gives it extra flavor.

Absolutely phenomenal, in fact my fiancee loves this enough that he's willing to pitch in to chop the pepper since I cannot. (I'm sensitive to the oils of the raw peppers, and it causes me breathing difficulty)  It's become an absolute favorite of the house and it's incredibly simple to make.  I suggest de seeding the peppers for those wanting a little less heat.  The only change I made was to add 1 cup of chicken broth and put it in the slow cooker, it was absolutely amazing in some tortillas.  And I might add it with a side of papas or mexican street corn.

I did this in a crock pot and came out very good! I just started cooking and this was easy. Next time I will add potatoes.
