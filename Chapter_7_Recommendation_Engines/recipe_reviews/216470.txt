Geez some people drive me crazy! How on earth are you going to rate this recipe when you haven't even made it??? & because of the calorie/fat content? Not at any point does this recipe say low calorie or low fat! To rate a recipe with 1 star because of what it "sounds" like completely defeats the meaning of this website. I've never commented before,  but I am just amazed at some users sometimes!!! By the way...wonderful recipe!!! Will make again & again...& again!

Fantastic!  Made it exactly as written and my whole family was delighted. As is often the case with pasta, the flavors "married" overnight and the leftovers rocked!  I am pleading with those of you who feel compelled to give a negative rating to a recipe you've never tried to please resist the urge. If you read the ingredients and decide it is not for you because of calories, salt, fat, or whatever, why are you even reading the reviews and adding your opinion?  The rest of us are not interested in your lecture, but rather the experiences of those who have actually made the recipe.

This was a very simple and tasty dish.  I only made two small changes.  I halved the pesto because the pesto at my store comes in 7oz containers and most people said they halved it anyway.  I also used diced tomatoes, but that's only because I grabbed the wrong can and didn't notice until I had already poured it in the bowl.

I don't know what it tastes like with all 15oz of pesto and crushed tomatoes but it was just fine with only 7oz of pesto and diced tomatoes.

Also, this dish was very big.  I had to pour it into a 9x13 casserole dish AND an 8x10 casserole dish.  I had a party with 10 people and the 8x10 went untouched and there was about 1 serving left in the 9x13.  If you're making this for a family of 4 or 5 you will definitely want to halve the recipe.

I didn't give it five stars because it didn't "Wow Me!".  It was very good and I'll definitely make it again!

Great family meal!  I have made this dish three times in the last month, and the beauty of it is that you can "tweak" it every time and it's still delish!  The first time I made it, I subbed tomato paste
for crushed tomatoes as had an open can in the fridge--family loved it!  Second time, used diced tomatoes and different cheese--another hit!  Tonight, I actually used crushed tomatoes, but for the cheese I used a combo of mozarella, provolone, guida and parmesan, and added a little more spinach--family again fell all over themselves getting seconds!  The only thing I've done consistently is halve the recipe, because it does make alot!  And, I make my own pesto in the summer and freeze it in golf-ball size servings-and one of them seems to be just perfect.  My family thanks you for posting such a great, pantry-adaptable recipe!!!

This was great. I used fresh tomatoes instead of crushed, and I did not use the afrado sauce. I recommend this recipe to anyone.

I don't even have this in the oven yet and I'm giving it 5 stars. Have you ever seen 'What About Bob'? The scene where he is having dinner with his doctor and the doctor's family - that was me preparing this. SO GOOD. Tweaks - I halved the pesto, used diced tomatoes, omitted the spinach (didn't have any) & seasoned the chicken a bit. I did it all in one pan on the stove top with the exception of the bread crumb mixture, obviously. Poured it in the 9x13 pan, topped with the crumb mixture & popped it in the oven. It smells divine, too. Can't wait to get my eat on. This is not at all healthy - but outstanding. Thank you so much.

We've been making this for a few years now, usually when we're expecting a crowd because this does make ALOT. We've since modified it to: reducing the pesto (we always have homemade in the freezer) & the shredded Italian cheeses by half, substituting spaghetti or marinara (again, homemade) sauce for the tomatoes (if we have some leftover, otherwise we've also used fresh - roasted or not - tomatoes with success, much better than canned) & we use the spinach if we remember to buy it, leave it out if we forget, never used the breadcrumbs - either way it's always a satisfying & relatively easy crowd pleaser - with or without the chicken even!!!***(Oh & I forgot to mention that we almost always include sauteed zucchini, yellow squash and/or mushrooms)***

Loved this pasta dish.  It is nice and creamy and makes a lot.  My 13 x 9 pan was filled to the brim.  The only change I made was to use mini penne pasta because that is what I had on hand.  The pesto, Alfredo and crushed tomatoes was a very nice combination and the spinach added the additional color that this needed for a good presentation.  Make sure you add the bread crumb and Parmesan cheese topping as it really enhances the flavors.  linda has provided a recipe that is sure to be a hit.  Thank you!

I thought this was delicious.  I wanted to let people know that there is an easier way to make this to save time and reduce clean-up.  I used my large stockpot and boiled the pasta first.  I then drained the pasta and let it sit in a colander in the sink.  In the same pot that I made the pasta, I then cooked thinly sliced chicken in some oil, and added some fresh garlic.  After the chicken was cooked, I added the other ingredients right to the pot, mixed it well, and then added the penne.  No need for additional mixing bowls.  I then poured the mixture into my large 9 x 13 baking stone, and had no problem fitting it all in.  Next I sprinkled on the topping and baked for 30 minutes, which was plenty.  I thought it was delicious and will make again.  I did reduce the chicken to 1 1/2 pounds, the cheese to 2 cups, the pesto to 8 oz, and the penne to 3/4 of the box.  If making again, I would do exactly the same, except use the entire box of penne.  THis was a keeper!  Thanks, Linda!

This was great! I am glad I cut the recipe in half as you suggested, it still made a lot! I agree that the pesto was a little strong and I would probably use less in the future.

Delish! I didn't have Italian cheese blend, but I don't think it really needs it with all the Alfredo sauce.  This was easy enough for me and made enough food for 3 people and lunch leftovers plus some.

Very tasty!!  I made my own pesto and only used half of what was called for.  The recipe called for what I thought a lot of chicken, I had 2 grilled chicken breast leftover from the night before and just cut into small pieces.  Also I only used about half the cheese blend, just seemed like a lot for 1 box of pasta.  I also diced 2 fresh tomatoes, because that's what I had on hand.  It's in the oven baking right now, but have been tasting along the way and will definitely make again!!!!  I can't wait for dinner!!

Outstanding recipe; both that night, and in the days that followed.  Some observations for others...
- While this may never be a low-fat dish, several ingredients can be tweaked including low-fat alfredo sauce, fat-free milk, reduced pesto augmented by extra of the herbal ingredients sans oil (or if you don't love the pesto flavor as much as I do, just half pesto), and adjusted cheese proportions.  In retrospect I think about an alternative suspension to oil for the crumbs and parm crust, but haven't tried it yet.  Low-fat alfredo may not fool your Italian grandmother in a primarily-alfredo dish, but this recipe is sufficiently robust that you won't notice the difference.
- Most average AR users like myself won't own a single bowl anywhere near large enough to mix all this (or all of a half-recipe), or a deep enough "9x13" casserole dish.  I was making roughly half the recipe quantities and it was still well more than I could fit.  You might plan on doing the big combination steps in two passes or two dishes, or just buy those bigger dishes you've been thinking about getting eventually anyway.  Planning ahead will save mess and inconvenience.
- I still have not figured out how spread the crust mix evenly over the dish - if any reviewer figures it out, please tell us.  Also, I think I should have used more grated parm relative to bread crumbs.

Thanks linda for the contribution, and let us know where you buy your 8 quart mixing bowls and foot deep baking dishes :-)

This is the first five star I have ever given.  And it  deserves it.  My family went wild, kids included.  My wife couldn't stop talking about it.

I did make a few changes.  

First, I cut the chicken, pasta, Italian cheese, pesto and spinach into a third of what the recipe called for so that it woud fit in a 12X12 casserole dish.

Everything else I cut roughly in half.

Be careful with too much pesto as it can overwhelm the dish.

I also blackened the chicken breasts (2) on a cast iron skillet as it added great flavor.

This is a great dish for company as it can be prepared ahead of time.  Congrats to the  cook who submitted this.  A true winner,  winner chicken dinner.

II made this for a track team prior to a meet. I bought some jarred pesto that was on sale that I don't normally use and did not look at the label - it contained both pine nuts and cashews - the one I normally use doesn't have nuts in it at all. Anyway I caused a child with a nut allergy to have a huge reaction which put him out for the rest of the meet - I felt terrible so I just wanted to warn anyone feeding something with pesto in it to check for nut content if you are feeding to anyone with nut allergies!

Perfection just like it is! Make the adjustments as your family may like if you wish she never said everything was written in stone.... I like to have lots of left overs this amount works for my family, it gives us some left over for a midnight raid & perhaps to take for lunch the next day! Thanks for taking the time to share..........

This recipe was PHENOMENAL. Honestly, I'm not sure how anyone could give it less than 5 stars. ....I read some reviews saying it was "tasteless".... Others complaining about the fat content, yet didn't even MAKE the recipe.... First of all, pesto is the key ingredient here - hence THE TITLE! If you're going to leave out the pesto due to cost, don't leave a review. OF COURSE, it will be tasteless! Second, no where on this recipe does it claim to be healthy. Besides, I believe in moderation and portion sizes. Having this recipe every now and again, will not hurt you! ANYWAY, my family of 6 LOVED it. From my youngest, who is 4, to grandma at 64! My husband raved about it. ...said it was better than any pasta at a restaurant. The only things I changed was that I cooked my own seasoned chicken, and I used garlic parmesan alfredo sauce. YES, it has LOTS of flavor and YES it has LOTS of calories. My advice, if you don't like flavor or fat, then move on...no need to troll with a cruddy review! I, for one, will DEFINITELY be making again! YUM!

The combination of ingredients created some degree of palate confusion.  I decreased the amount of pesto to 9oz and it was still too much. The finished product was a nondistinct presentation, looking more like 'mush' with no appeal. I will not make this again.  IF I needed to alter the recipe, I would make penne with pesto, add some chicken, add some sun dried tomatoes, and decrease the 4 cups of shredded cheese.  One star was way to generous.

Mmmm yummy :) This was very good. And easy. I did change it a little bit because I misread the ingredient amounts and didn't write a list before I went shopping (oops). So I used 1 4 oz jar of pesto, 2 jars of Alfredo sauce, 3 large chicken breasts, only 2 cups Italian cheese, and added some garlic. I also used fresh diced tomatoes. This made a ton of food! I used my deepest 9x13 dish and it almost didn't fit in that! Then at the very end of putting this together I realized I forgot the milk :O So I just poured about 1/2 cup over the top and added a little more of the Parm/bread crumbs. Family loved it and fought over leftovers for lunch. Very forgiving recipe, I know I completely messed it up but it was fantastic. Will make again, maybe using sun-dried tomato pesto, doesn't that sound fantastic? Thanks for the recipe linda.

Instead of pasta we used the Vagetti spiral vegetable slicer and made zucchini 'noodles'. Then we halved the recipe for everything else. It turned out delicious!

This was easy to prepare, and I followed the recipe as stated except only used 7 oz of pesto. I actually think this tastes better the second day, as it gives the ingredients time to marry. Thanks for sharing~

Incredible!!!  Used small jar pesto and diced italian tomatoes as others recommended.  I took it to work for a luncheon and put it in a slow cooker instead of the oven.  I left the topping off.  It easily served 12 people.  EVERYONE loved it!! Brought a little home for my family to taste...a winner again.  Will definitely make often.

This was so good, my two boys (6 & 4) even gobbled it up!  I did sub a little, I used fresh roma tomatoes diced, and a little less pesto since what was in the fridge seemed a little concentrated, and I tore up the spinach leaves.  I made this before I left for work so all that needed to be done was to pop it in the oven until hot. I wonder it if freezes well?

Amazing.  I got so many recipe requests after I served this at a girls night -- I was in charge of feeding 19 women for dinner, and one friend made a baked spaghetti dish, and I made this recipe and also this spinach artichoke lasagna. This indeed made more than a deep-dish 9x13 (enough for a decent 8x8 for me & the hubs) -- like the reviews suggested, I halved the pesto (7 oz. total) and used a sun-dried tomato version, and fire-roasted diced tomatoes (just bc it sounded yummy).  I'll probably also use 3/4 or half the alfredo sauce next time, since it was a bit rich for me, but *everybody* loved it the way it was.  I also prepped all of this the night before and stuck it in the fridge so all I'd have to do was pop it in the oven for the party -- came out perfect!  And, btw, I also accidentally skipped the milk, and maybe that's why the alfredo sauce was too rich for me :D  Will.absolutely.make.again!

Very delicious!  I too used only half the pesto only because I saw how much a jar of it cost!  Ouch...my 7&14 yr old. loved it and that's all that matters.  Used my Celebrating Home Roaster Oven pan.  This is a huge dish will cook better if you use something larger than a 13x9 size pan.

This recipe is excellent! I modified it to be gluten free and it was phenomenal! The only changes that I made were that I switched out the spinach for frozen green peas and uncooked broccoli and I sautéed the chicken with butter, olive oil, garlic salt, and S&P. Thank you for submitting this recipe!!

I made this last night and let me just say it was a hit.  At first my son wasn't so sure about it because of the pesto in it but once he took that first bite, in less than 5 minutes he got up for another bowl.  My daughter loved it as well and asked when would we be having it again.  I will be making this again.

This was amazing!  I followed everything to the T.  Well, sort of.  I had two chicken breasts that I cooked then cut up into cubes.  That seemed to be just enough.  I mixed the cheese up as well.  I used Italian blend and Mozzarella.  And I didn't exactly measure out the spinach either.  I just did handfuls and assumed each one meant a cup.  This came out so good.  My family ate it up!  Thank goodness it makes a lot, because we're all very excited about the leftovers.

This was very easy to make! I used 2 fresh roma tomatoes, 7 oz pesto, and a whole bunch of fresh torn spinach. I also used only 3 cups Italian cheese blend. The bread crumbs I used were crushed stovetop stuffing. Thank you for this recipe! My whole family loved it and it's a beautiful dish to serve with all the colors!

This was delicious and made a huge amount, even though I halved the recipe.  I did make a few changes, only because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand.  I only had a small amount of pesto suce, maybe 1/4 cup, and it was plenty.  I almost think the full amount of pesto called for in the recipe might be too much.  I substituted an equal amount of sour cream for the milk, used plain panko bread crumbs rather than seasoned, and in place of the canned crushed tomatoes, threw a handful of cherry tomatoes in the microwave for a minute or two, then crushed them a bit.  The result was great!  Anxious to try the recipe as written also!!

Used less pesto as other reviewers recommended. Not that impressive. Didn't look appealing and taste was fair. Brought to a potluck. Guests liked it but I was not impressed. Will not make again.

This was an amazing dish.  My nine-year-old daughter helped me with the preparation, and although it was relatively simple to prepare the taste did not convey that.  I did notice that I needed to bake this in two dishes, one 9x13, and one 8x8.  That's alright, because now we have left-overs!

Very tasty! My only changes to this recipe were to use dreamfield.s pasta, (low carb) and made the Alfredo sauce using an Ellie Krieger recipe. It lowers the carbs, fat & calories.  Still tastes like comfort food, without the guilt

I just made this tonight and it made a score of 9.5 with my family.  To make it easy just cube raw chicken into small pieces and put it in the mixture.  It cooks perfectly in 45 minutes.  I only used one 7 oz. jar of pesto and 2 cps of cheese and a 15 oz can of italian stewed tomatoes that I pureed in the blender.  My husband loved it with a little red pepper sprinkled on the top.  This is definitely a keeper!!!!!!!!!!!

Very good, used diced tomatoes instead of crushed, and omitted the olive oil from the Parmesan/breadcrumb mix, it didn't seem like you would be able to spread it evenly when it was moistened, so I sprinkled it dry and drizzled a little olive oil on it. Completely filled an 8 x 10 AND a 9 x 13. Half cooked the 8 x 10 and froze it.

very flavorful and tasty! I substituted red bell pepper for the tomatoes just because of personal taste. I also used reduced fat Alfredo sauce which helped a tad with the calories. I will definitely make again but will cut down on the amount of sauce. It seemed to overwhelm the dish in my opinion. Served with a simple salad. Plenty of leftovers!

This recipe was easy to put together and get on the table for dinner. It calls for entirely too much pesto. This amount of pesto overpowers all of the other flavors. It also lacked alot. This is a great base recipe for something spectacular if you played with it and modified it.

Yummy!!! I did use less pesto (8oz) because that's how it came. I think more would be too much. And I  only used 3 cups of chicken because we're not very carniverous. And yes, it makes a TON of casserole- lots of leftovers.

This is now one of my favorite meals of all time! Seriously. I followed the exact directions, except I did half the Pesto  sauce as suggested by most people here. Definitely made a lot! Making it again and again for sure!

We put 7 ounces of pesto and it was still a LITTLE too much.  I will put 5 next time.  Otherwise, very good recipe!

This dish was great and my whole family loved it.  I decreased the pesto to the 8oz jar and used diced tomoatoes versus crushed like other reviewers stated and this came out wonderfully.  It was also so easy to prepare that my 4 year old did half the work!

This was definitely the recipe I was looking for. I will definitely make this a second time but I will reduce the pesto as it was a bit much. Loved it!!

New Post: I just made this a second time with some minor tweaks and it was delicious!! First I substituted vegetable pasta in to tone down the carbs a little. Second, I halved the amount of pesto and Italian cheese combo and left everything else the same. It was PERFECT!

This is good stuff!  But it makes a LOT.  I just put about 2/3 of the recipe in a 9x13 pan, and froze an 8x8 to have on hand during the hectic holidays.  I make this exactly as written, with two small changes:  I only use half of the pesto; and I mix everything except for the noodles in a big bowl.  Once the noodles are divided between the two casseroles, I pour a portion of the sauce/chicken mixture over top and mix right in the casserole.  Thanks for a keeper recipe!

I just made this for dinner tonight and we just finished eating it. It is soooooo delicious. My  husband was raving over it and even went back for seconds. I hate when people make changes to recipes and then rate them bad, and unfortunately I had to make just a few small changes. I used bowtie pasta only because it was what I had and I needed to use it(we don't eat a lot of pasta in our house). I also only used a 7oz. jar of pesto as that is what they had at Publix and it was quite expensive. Other than that I followed the recipe to a tee and it was amazing. It does make quite a bit but we do not mind as we like to take leftovers to work the next day. Thanks for a really great recipe!!!!!!

This is such an awesome dish!!!  I made my own Alfredo sauce, and used fire roasted tomatoes instead of crushed, and only half jar of pesto, and boneless skinless thighs.  Everyone who tasted it loved it, including my son, who is a chef!  It's almost gone, and I want to make some more now!    Oh, I forgot, I thought I had bread crumbs, but didn't, so I just used just the parm on top.

This recipe was amazing.  I made a few changes because of what I had on hand: I used about half the chicken, left out the spinach, used a large can(28 oz) of spaghetti sauce instead of the crushed tomatoes, made my own pesto and halved the amount, and left out the milk entirely(it didn't need it).  It fit perfectly in my 9x13 pan and my husband and I enjoyed the leftovers for several days.

Absolutely delicious! It is very rich and tasteful. It does make a lot. Didn't change a thing except used diced tomatoes and my own pesto sauce. It was enjoyed by everyone and even heats up well the next day.  Thanks so much for sharing, linda!

Tasty and easy to put together.  Everyone liked, even picky teen.  I only used about a third of the cheese to reduce the fat and calories.  Will make again.

I wanted to try something different. I typed in "chicken cassarole" into the search feature and this recipe popped up. I thought it sounded really unique and different. It was. Really really great dish. My family loved it! (and take Linda's instruction to heart...this made ALOT!)

I followed the recipe pretty close except...my local store didnt have pesto so I dumped some chopped basil with a dribble of olive oil and garlic in. I also lightly floured and sauteed the chicken (which added to the overall flavor). I also spiced it up with some cayenne pepper. I asked my family if they liked it enough for me to make it again and the answer was a resounding YES PLEASE!!!

Thanks for sharing Linda...*smile*

Based off of other reviews I made a few changes: 
I used about 2/3 the recommended alfredo and pesto, 1c milk (vs 1.5) and 3c. mixed in cheese  (vs 4) , I also added 2 sauteed zucchini.  I used chicken thighs because that's what I had. With the decreases it still had PLENTY of sauce and was very cheezy
The full recipe fit in a 9x13 and 8x8 casserole dish.
This dish is my new favorite casserole and definitely one I will be taking when I make food for a potluck or to feed another family. You could definitely play with adding more veggies- sun dried tomatoes, yellow squash, artichoke hearts, mushrooms....
I'm really excited to have found this recipe, thank you to the chef who submitted it!

AMAZING FOUNDATION. I HAVE BEEN MAKING THIS FOR YEARS. Tweaks: Halved the recipe. Halved the pesto again. Diced tomatoes + 1/4 cup tomato sauce instead of crushed. Browned chicken with cajun seasoning. Added veg: 4 oz browned mushrooms, 1/2 caramelized onion, 1 red bell pepper. Added seasonings: tsp paprika, pinch chili powder, pinch red pepper flakes, pinch cayenne, tsp Italian seasoning, tsp dried basil. Serve with bread slices and sugar snap peas or roasted vegetables.

This is delicious!  I made it exactly how the recipe calls for, and my family loved it!  We love basil, so the pesto was not too strong for us.  I have put this in my favorites and will definitely be making it again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I've have made it  and must laugh..every time I serve this
dish... everyone wants the recipe. A great dish for a large
crowd. We modified it for gluten free. Using gluten free
penne and gluten free bread crumbs. Absolutely delicious
either way!!! Using a rotisserie chicken makes it easy.

Easy recipe that was well-liked by my family. For a short-cut, I used store-bought rotisserie chicken that turned out to be almost over-done, so when I mixed it in with the other ingredients it started falling apart. Next time, I'll chop the meat into slightly bigger pieces and add chicken at the last minute after all other ingredients are mixed together just before pouring mixture into baking dish. I cut down on the pesto sauce and the cheese blend, as others have suggested, and added in some mushrooms. Might add some other veggies too next time (peas, blanched broccoli, red bells, etc.) for a great one-dish dinner.

I would rate this a 5 if it weren't for the amount of pesto this dish calls for. It's way too much. Decrease it to 6 oz, and this was awesome. Everyone in my family had seconds. Next time, I'll use more spinach just because we like it. Delicious.

I followed the directions exactly. My family didn't really care for this recipe. I think i might try a different recipe next time. Just our own personal taste. I think it was the pesto sauce.

This lends itself very well to improvising and my family all loved the result of my modified version. I cannot wait to try the original now.  My modifications were:

3 diced fresh Roma tomatoes in place of crushed
Blend of fresh mozzarella and pepper jack cheese
Added lightly sautéed fresh mushrooms and because I didn't have Alfredo or milk, I used one can of condensed cream of celery soup and water.

I cook for a family of seven every night.  Five of them are teenagers so the size of the dish was perfect for us!  The only change I made to the recipe was to saute onion, garlic and red pepper and add that to the pasta mixture.  I might add artichoke hearts the next time.  We'll definitely make this one again!

Following the recommendation of other reviewers, I cut down on the pesto, cheese, and milk, and added chopped onion and mushrooms. I also used 2 packages of chicken tenderloins (so about 2 lbs- I don't know how that compares to 6 cups), which I cooked, seasoned, and cut up myself. With the revisions, it was delicious! Three stars for the recipe as written, but it can definitely be improved upon and tailored to your own tastes.

I rely on the reviews at this website so much that I decided to finally write my own.  I made this tonight and found it to be a really tasty recipe. I'll definitely make it again.  Other than reducing the amount of pesto per other reviews (I used 7 oz.), the biggest change I made was to use the pasta cooking water in the place of milk to make it less rich. I made my own alfredo sauce by melting a stick of butter and then stirring in 1 c cream and 1 c shredded parmesan cheese (recipe from Joy of Cooking). I started to add the crushed tomatoes and found the color the casserole was turning to be alarming, so I nixed it.  In the future, I will add a can of drained petite diced tomatoes instead. All in all, a company-worthy, family-friendly recipe!

This recipe was wonderful and easy to make. I used rotisserie chicken and lightened it up with light Alfredo from a jar and a light Italian cheese blend. Use all the pesto recommended. This is a perfect casserole for a potluck, a moving day dish, or if you need a taste of comfort food. Delicious!

I am trying it tonight, I like many of you look forward to some of the comments regarding the ratings, I have to admit people who have negative comments because maybe it's too fattening, lol why don't you adjust it for your own dietary needs or just don't make it. There are tons of other like recipes...just a thought.

We loved this recipe! There was more than enough to take to my expecting friend and for our family. Pesto only comes in a 7 oz jar, so added a little more alfredo sauce instead. Also used the crushed tomatoes with basil. Replaced the seasoned bread crumbs with the regular crumbs we had on hand and added a packet of dry italian dressing mix to the crumbs! Yummy!!

This makes a ton of food! I froze half of it the first time I made it and it froze really well. I just made it and cut the recipe in half but kept the same amount for the bread topping. Everyone loved it! Didn't change a thing either! Delicious dish! Thank you!

Ok, I did what most did and halved the pesto, the store only had small jars of pesto so that's what I used, other than that I followed the recipe to a T. A lot of people commented that it was too much so I made the whole recipe and divided it into 3, 9" foil pie tins and we ate one and I froze the other two for future dinners. My 7 year old son wasn't trilled but my husband and I loved it and I will be making this again. I loved the fact it made enough to freeze for future dinners! THANK YOU!

This Is truly a great recipe. I've made this about 5-6 times and it's a hit every time with my family. The only modification made was replacing regular crushed tomatoes with a can of Rotel...that's it! Thanks for sharing!!

First of all YUUUUMMM!!!! This dish was absolutely amazing!  My husband and I were so thrilled when this came out of the oven!  Our apartment was filled with the most delicious aromas.  We drank wine, played Sinatra and for a night, felt like we were in Italy. The pesto sauce absolutely makes this dish!! I admit, I was kind of worried when I went to get the ingredients for this recipe as certain items, like pesto, are rather expensive. Fortunately, I found buy 1 get 1 free jars of pesto at the grocery! Also, I definitely didn't put in 6 cups of chicken. I put in 3 cubed chicken breasts (yes it was a little light, but still amazing!) When considering that this recipe makes 12 servings, I am able to justify the $18 I spent ($1.50 / serving).  Sure, I could have made a ton of spaghetti for less, but this dish was totally worth the smiles it put our faces! Moreover, I would have easily spent more money at any fast food restaurant - ick!

This is a tasty casserole that, surprisingly, all of my kids liked (even with the spinach)! If you have prepared pesto and pre-cooked chicken, this dish is easy to prepare. I used a can of diced tomatoes (drained), but next time I might use fresh. I found that the recipe made too much to fill a 9x13 baking dish, so I used an additional 8x8 dish. I also used the Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto recipe from this site instead of store-bought pesto. Excellent!

I made this and cut the recipe in half.  I wasn't overly impressed.  I didn't care for the bread crumb topping, I think reserving some of the shredded cheese for the top would be better.  I also think using frozen spinach would be easier in this recipe.  Overall, it wasn't horrible.  It just needed some tweaking to make it more appetizing for our tastes.

I loved it and so did the husband. I used a light alfredo sauce and half the amount of the pesto. I also added some red and green peppers and half the amount of cheese (also low fat). It was really good! Service with warm dinner rolls and a side salad. Will be making again soon.

I thought this recipie was just OK...I didn't use the pesto sauce because is was soooo expensive but used all the other ingredients.  I thought it made quite a bit...I made it in two 9" squares.  I would not make it again.

It's quite easy to prepare. Is one of those dishes that comes under my heading as a hearty and filling meal. When it comes to a wow factor, I find it fails and is expensive to put together when you factor in some of the ingredients.

I made this for my husband and a friend last night, and it was awesome! Thanks to my toddler, I could not find my dry measuring cups, so I had to estimate some of the amounts-overall, I ended up with less chicken and spinach than what it called for, as I used the chicken I had on hand,I think it was about 4 cups. About how much chicken makes 6 cups? I had to guess on the spinach, taking about 1/3 of the bag..I thought I was pretty close, but my friend said he thought more spinach would be good. I also added extra pesto...it just seemed to need more as I was mixing. I used the crushed tomatoes as called for, but next time will try petite diced. The tomatoes virtually disappear, and I think the diced will give a bit of body and color. I wish the pesto had retained it's vibrant green color instead of turning sort of gray, does anyone have suggestions on that?  DEFINITELY make more of the crust, as that is the best part...the boys picked it all off the top, so I had to make a fresh crust for the leftovers...and we scraped that off the empty pan too! Many reviews said it was better the next day..we didn't notice any difference the second night, but it was excellent both times!  I will be making this often, and can even make it without the chicken to make it kosher for synagogue potlucks!

Easy and delicious! This recipe is wonderful as written. I do not like people who like to change things in the original recipe and then rate it; that makes no sense and ruins the concept of rating the original recipe!! Great recipe that I think will be wonderful with turkey leftovers. I also envision making it with crushed bacon bits and leaving out the pesto sauce. However, that has nothing to do with my rating or this recipe, which, is great. I am going to freeze the leftovers and bring them to my sons in college, who will love them!

This was very easy to assemble, love the crunchy bread crumb crust. It passed the kid test, too. For me, it was a bit rich with all that cheese and creaminess, but I think, on the whole, it is a crowd-pleaser.

I made this tonight - it was wonderful. I did make adjustments though - didn't use spinach (b/c I didn't have any) And I did cut back on the pesto. And I halved the recipe once I read the other reviews. And it still made a 9x13 pan full.

I made this for 10 plus people with salad and garlic bread and it was plenty of food.  I used 28oz can of crushed tomatoes cause my grocery store did not have 16oz, and added some chopped garlic. Everyone at the party was raving about it and wanted recipe.  For my personal taste I would run the pesto sauce in grinder to smooth out the pine nuts.  Other than that it was superb!!

Made substitutes with what was on hand: diced tomatoes instead of crushed; mozzarella and cheddar instead of Italian cheese blend; no pesto available. Great recipe that welcomes adaptations. Makes more than enough for one 9x13 pan for sure.

This was very good.  I was in a hurry so I just decreased the amount of milk and skipped the baking part.  I topped it with Parmesan w/o the bread crumbs.

We just loved this wonderful dish that made my kitchen smell like Olive Garden! A keeper for sure..the only thing I would change at all would be to add a little less pesto...but that's just a personal preference...some folks probably like the extra spiciness! I would also only make 1/2 the recipe next time as this makes a HUGE amount of food! But it is absolutely Delicious & THANKS so very much for sharing!!!

Easy recipe that tasted great. I followed the recipe for the most part except I decreased the amount of shredded cheese and pesto. I used only 2 cups of cheese and (1) 7oz jar of pesto. Instead of crushed tomatoes, I used a can of fire roasted tomatoes. The breadcrumb/parm topping really gave this a nice taste as well as a nice texture. I will use this recipe again.

My sister made this and her whole family loved it, so I decided to give it a try. I loved it, too. I used diced tomatoes, but stuck to the recipe otherwise. It was great re-heated. My boyfriend, who's not a pasta-lover, had leftovers for lunch the following day and then more for dinner that night. A hit!

My family loved this, and you can easily cut the amount of fat and calories. I have made it both ways, and it's just as good. I used a low fat alfredo sauce, used 1 cup of cheese instead of 4, cut down the milk to a half of a cup, and doubled the amount of tomatoes. I also only used 5 oz of pesto, but added some chopped onions and fresh garlic to my chicken when I cooked it. (I used 1lb of chicken because that's what I had on hand, and I think it was probably closer to 4 cups). I have a family of 7 and there was not a lot leftover. My 1 yr old ate a full grown man sized portion, and my 3 and 5 year old really liked it (I did use frozen spinach instead of fresh so they wouldn't notice it so much). My  husband said he could have eaten the entire 9X13 dish.

This was yummo-licious!  As always, I read the reviews to get tips before following a recipe.  I made some changes for my family of 4: used  2.5 cups of uncooked whole wheat penne pasta , used half of a 7 oz jar of pesto. Used maybe less than a 1/2 c of crushed tomatoes (eyeballed it to taste).  Used 3 oz of cut grilled chicken strips.  I used the entire 15 oz jar of alfredo sauce.  I don't think I used 3 cups of spinach.  I eyeballed this too, to my liking. Used 2 cups of italian blend cheeses and 3/4 c of milk.  I used the specified amount of parmesan cheese and bread crumbs, but I probably used 2 TBSP of EVOO because 1 TBSP wasn't enough.  My kids are somewhat picky when it comes to eating, and they (and DH) LOVED it!  This is definitely a keeper.  I agree, it's not a healthy meal, BUT using whole wheat pasta and watching your portions will make a difference.  Thanks, Linda, for submitting this wonderful, comforting, family meal!!

I thought this recipe was delicious.  I'm glad I listened to others who suggested putting in less pesto. I put in 3/4 cup and it seemed perfect.  I would however put half the amount of parmesan cheese in the filling. I felt it was way to much as there is already cheese in the pesto.

This makes ALOT ~ we're a family of five and have had it as a main dish for supper twice and still have some left over!  Don't know how anyone could get this into a 9x13 pan.  I used an 11x14 and an additional casserole dish.  It's more flavorful the second day ~ I served with leafy green salads.  Also added more spinach than it called for as other reviewers suggested and glad I did ~ there's ALOT of pasta.  May even be good with brocolli instead?  The only thing I will do differently next time is to add some additional alfredo sauce and probably some sauted onion & garlic.  Just wasn't as creamy as I anticipated.

Really good.  I totally improvised based on the other reviews.  I used Ritz crackers, frozen spinach, left-over spaghetti sauce and a packaged creamy pesto sauce and minimized the cheese and subsituted some of the cheese with cream cheese.  Yum!

I am giving this 5 stars as all of my teenage boys and husband loved it.  I made without the spinach (although I would like that) and halved the pesto as others had recommended.  I think sprinkling pinenuts over the top would be a nice addition, and I might try that next time.  I will definitely make this again!

This looks really good.  I couldn't fit it all in a 
9 X13 and filled up that and a 8 in. 
Also not an inexpensive dish.. 
Still can't wait to taste it as it is in the oven and 
smelling yum!
By the smell I rate it a 4 star.
So I have made this three or four times now and it is the best chicken pasta dish ever! Rate it a 5 star now.  I am making this now and will be halving the recipe. Makes so much for just two people. Even when you love the leftovers.

Just made this tonight for dinner. I did halve the recipe as was suggested.  My family loved it!  I thought it was a little fattening but I think it could be made lighter: light alfredo,light pesto and barilla plus pasta.  I would definatly make this again and would do it for a big crowd.  I am giving it 4 stars because it is pretty unhealthy.

OMG this was GREAT!  I made according to the recipe but halfed the pesto as was suggested. I made my own Alfredo using another recipe from this web site. I used low fat cheese, reduced fat Parmesan, fat free cream cheese (in my Alfredo).  It was awesome!!!!  Thank you for your great recipe!!!

I never can tell whether my fiance likes what I cook.  This definitely gave me the reaction to look for in the future!  He LOVED it!  The dog even jumped on the counter and got a lick.  Normally he would freak out but he was more worried whether or not we could save it!!  He stood over me and told me how to cut around the "suspect" area!  Lol.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Very tasty, I used fresh Alfredo and Pesto sauces and I added an 8oz can of drained sliced mushrooms and an 8oz can of drained sliced olives (rinsed).  I added everything together per #3 except the chicken, this enabled me to make a small vegetarian casserole. I added chicken to the rest and there was more than enough.  I did have to double the bread crumb topping in order to have enough for both casseroles.  I also used Focaccia style bread cubes (crushed in a plastic bag w/rolling pin) as my bread crumbs.

This got a thumbs up from my hubby and teen son.  I thought it was very tasty too.  I made an alfredo sauce from a packet with non-fat milk to save on some fat and left out the tomatoes because I really didn't think they were needed.  I will make this again!

Delicious!  Everyone in my family loved this - even my picky kids!  I halved the pesto (15 oz seemed way too much), and left out the spinach b/c I forgot to pick it up. It's a keeper!

Followed recipe the best I could. Didn't have alfredo sauce, or, Italian cheese mix... so I just skipped the alfredo and used shredded mozzarella, instead. It was AWESOME, totally healthy, and I am glad I skipped the alfredo for hubby's sake with high cholesterol. Last, I only had Panko bread crumbs, instead of bread crumbs, but they worked great. Next time I will shop before, and try it the way it was written. Kudos to the gal that posted this... It's a winner.

The sauce for this is awesome.  I used 4 oz pesto and added a couple teaspoons of sugar.  We like sweeter sauces.  I decided to just use spinach and not the chicken.  We loved it.

I love this recipe!!!  I didn't want to use store bought pesto because I had basil growing outside so I used another recipe on this site - Spinach Basil Pesto.  It worked out perfectly because I needed spinach for this one AND that one.  I followed both exactly except for adding 4 oz. of Portabello mushrooms to the pasta mix.  I do have to say that I cut the pasta recipe in half and one normal prep. of the pesto.  I will be giving 5 stars to that recipe too.  WOW, what a fantastically great meal !!!!

Only used half the pesto called for which was plenty for my family. Add some bread sticks and you have homemade Italian restaurant taste. It does make a lot.

This was soooo good.  My fiance doesn't like "white" sauces and he didn't know there was alfredo sauce in here.  It does make a large batch so I put it in two foil pans and froze them to use when needed.  I also made some for a friend that is sick.  Her family raved about it.

Rich but very tasty... my family loved it. I made my own Alfredo and only used a cup and a half. I also only used half of the pesto.  I had cut back on the bread crumbs, but will do more next time per husbands request...

Made this tonight using GF pasta, breadcrumbs, and sauces. I didn’t have spinach so I substituted a bag of frozen broccoli. It was really good and my family enjoyed it immensely.  Even the picky eater went back for seconds!

5 stars from my son, 4 from me. To be honest, this just has too much fat in it for me, but it smelled heavenly and I did taste it - it was delicious. My son (who is trying to gain weight) thought it was just great and has been happily pounding down heaping portions of it for 3 days!

Agree with others that halving the recipe is perfect for one casserole; full recipe would be ideal if you want to keep one/give one, or serve one/freeze one.  

Thanks Lindalou, this was just what I was looking for, for my son.

I made it and it was tasty.  The only change was I used 8 oz. of pesto.  I think the dish was very rich and quite heavy.  If I make it again I will cut back to 4 oz. of pesto, 2 cups of cheese and add some mushrooms and probably some zucchini to cut the richness.

The taste is great, don't get me wrong. But it needs some adjustments. I cut the cheese and pesto both by a third which worked out pretty well, but if you're not a huge fan of pesto you may want to cut that back even further as others have suggested. The bread crumbs mixture is WAY too much for me, next time I'd cut it in half at least, maybe even a bit more. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. Liked it and will make it again with these tweaks, thanks to the recipe creator for the ideas. Also there's no way in a million years this is gonna fit in a 9x13 baking dish. I used my huge Dutch oven and it was still hard to mix and over 2/3rds full when I put it in the oven.

I made this with Barilla “protein”pasta and used almond milk.  The pesto sauce came in 8 oz jars so I used two.  The flavor was excellent.  I’ll definitely be making this again.

Obviously not healthy (it's not claiming to be), but delicious!  I cut back on both Pesto and Alfredo (maybe half), otherwise it's a little too salty for my taste.  A friend brought me this casserole after I had my baby, and now I make it as a dish to give to people when they need a meal(new baby, home from hospital, etc).  Just make sure you use the biggest bowl you own to mix it all together, it makes a ton.  I split it between 2 dishes or disposable aluminum containers and give one away and keep one for myself.  PERFECT for make ahead and refrigerate or freeze.  Great recipe!

This recipe is DELICIOUS. I don’t care how “fattening” it is. There’s definitely no “non-fat” label on this recipe, and that’s perfectly fine with me. It feeds a ton and is absolutely amazing. My husband and I are obsessed with it and will add it to our regular monthly meals!

My daughter  thought this looked good, so we tried it (no ingredient alterations). It's just the two of us, so we halved the recipe. It was still A LOT - I don't know how it fits in a 9x13 pan as written. It's quite tasty right out of the oven, but we've had to eat it all week long (more than six servings for us), and it doesn't really reheat that well. It's still good just not as impressive as straight out of the oven. I would make it again for a larger group of people. The jury is still out if it's something that we make just for us again though.

This recipe was fabulous as written, my whole family loved it and the kids really liked the crunchy top.  This recipe makes a lot and fills the 9x13 pan to the rim.  I put some of the casserole in a second dish and froze it for a smaller meal for two for a later date.

It was great!  I think I would have baked it longer than 45 minutes, to add more of a crunch top layer.  I also used gluten free penne pasta from Whole foods (boiled it for 5 min., then baked).  AND, Gluten free cheese and Garlic  croutons for crunch top later.  Came out great!!! I also used a 6 oz. of basil pesto, then 7 oz. of tomato pesto.  Added MORE spinach, and a cup more of CHICKEN cubes. Hubby loved it too!!!

I made this recipe and it was wonderful.  We loved the breadcrumb topping because it added another dimension to the casserole.  I used the entire package of spinach and it wasn't too much.  I used gluten free pasta and it worked great.  I will definitely make this again and my husband asked me to put a heart on the printed recipe so that I would know he loved it.

I have a family of professional complainers and they all liked this recipe, so this is definitely a keeper.

The only thing I can add to the other reviews here is that this makes A LOT of food. The casserole pan was filled right to the top. All four of us ate and that only dented about a quarter of the pan. The rest went into bowls for meals tomorrow and the deep freeze.

Wonderful casserole! I made a couple changes based on  personal preference but this casserole was a good as anything that I have been served in an Italian restaurant. I used 6 ounces of pesto instead of the 15 ounces and replaced the additional 9 ounces of homemade alfredo and I used diced tomato instead of crushed. You will love it.

This was delicious comfort food!  I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow. I just couldn't bring myself to put four cups of cheese in it, so I reduced it to three, and also reduced the pesto to 7 ounces as I didn't get a 15 ounce jar.  I accidentally opened a can of diced tomatoes instead of crushed, but that was fine with me anyway.  I used an entire 6 ounce bag of baby spinach and even spread a layer on top and spread some reserved cheese on it before the crumb topping.  I can't wait to make this for a crowd.

I really like this dish and I love it even more because my husband loved it. It is super delicious, is good for big families, and for small families that need good food that will last a while! This dish definitely gets five stars!

I made this recipe tonight and it was a hit! I halved the recipe for 5 of us, and there was still leftovers. I didn’t half the bread crumb topping though. The only change I made was I used Classico Spicy tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes. My family loved it. I’ll definitely be making this again.

This was good. For those of you that are not big pesto fans I would recommend reducing the amount of pesto.  That being said... fresh homemade pesto is totally different than store bought pesto.  If using fresh I would go with the full amount... store bought  only about 6 oz or less depending on how much you like pesto.   normally I would make fresh pesto...but since this was a weeknight dinner I used store bought.  I also used diced canned tomatoes instead of crushed. 
6 cups of chicken is way to much in my opinion... but that all depends on personal preference... I like more pasta than chicken.  I used 3 cups chicken and that was plenty for us.  I also added some fresh sautéed mushrooms because I had some I needed to use and added  some chopped onion to the mushrooms while cooking.  A great dish that can be tweaked to your taste... I will make again... it made lots... so looking forward to leftovers.

Made it exactly as directions said (except half the pesto), and it was a HUGE hit with the family - from my 98 year old grandmother to my very picky 15 year old son and 12 year old daughter!  So easy, and so flavorful - this recipe is definitely a keeper!

I felt like something was missing. A spice? Bacon maybe would make it better?  The tomato added a weird flavor. I prob won't make it again.

Husband loved it, daughter and I thought it was good. I used quick oats because I ran out of bread crumbs. Used a packet of Alfredo sauce because jars are so unhealthy. I added a bag of thawed broccoli to make it healthier.

I made this for a potluck; people really liked it.  It makes a very generous casserole; I was able to take a large casserole to the potluck and leave another at home for the kids from one recipe.  It is a creamy comfort food, but next time I think I will make modifications to it that will make it lower in fat and still taste as good.

Oh my goodness. This is my 5-6 time making this dish and it is amazing!!! Usually make as directed except for cut the pesto in half. I've tried it with turkey instead of chicken and broccoli instead of spinach. Anyway you make it, it's delicious. And yes, this is a heavy dish, but definitely a family pleaser! Thank you!

I didn't make any changes, and my hubby just LOVED it. I like GOOD recipes that I can make in a hurry and freeze for later, so I froze half of this. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, and even though I have Humira shots, I still have "flares" off and one which mainly affect my fingers and wrists. I also have Stenosis in my low back.  So I LOVE 
make-ahead meals that I can FREEZE and are still great tasting. This recipe was tasty and EXCELLENT!   :-)

Nice dish for a cold day when comfort food is in order. Used diced fire roasted tomatoes in place of crushed and doubled the amount to offset the strength of the pesto flavor. If you're not a big pesto fan you should consider using a smaller amount. Used fresh pesto and homemade alfredo but store bought will work equally as well. 

Remember this is a casserole so if you're looking for a pretty plate - this isn't a good choice. But if you are looking for a dish to pile on your plate without regard for appearances and full of cheesy, gooey flavor - this is it!

Great flavor profile but I couldn’t get around the grease. If I try again I will try and reduce all the components that add grease so it would be more edible

A new family favorite! I wasn't sure about adding pesto as I have never cooked with it before, but it adds a fresh, yummy burst of flavor. And thank you Linda for pointing out that this recipe makes a lot. I cook for a large household and automatically double any recipe I try, but no need with this recipe, it was perfect.

It was ok but I thought a little bit tasteless.  My boyfriend like it though.  I used the mini penne pasta and only the 8 oz jar of pesto since that's what it came in.  It might have been better using the 15 oz.  The spinach was the best part of it.  It also made not only a 9x13 inch pan but also another 8x8 inch pan too.  It would be good to make for a large group.

Didn't blow me away, but it gets 4 stars for me because it was tasty, super filling, and made a LOT (I'll have leftovers for days!). I actually didn't find the pesto to be overpowering; it seasoned the chicken nicely. I did have to split the mixture into two separate baking dishes, because there was no way it was all fitting in my one! Very nice wintertime comfort-food recipe, especially if you're on a budget and want a long-lasting, low-energy meal that's also affordable.

This one was great!  I parboiled four chicken breasts in a broth/water combination, then cubed the chicken.  I'm not sure it made a lot of difference, because the alfredo/pesto combination was flavorful enough as is.
Kids loved it, wife loved it, leftovers were gone the next day.

Wow! Just wow! Used 8 oz jar of pesto and 5 cups of spinach (chopped just my preference). It was great! My whole family loved it.

Wow. Those ingredients are expensive! For me, at least. sad
I'll rate 5 stars, because it looks really good and I would like to cook it in the future.

This is amazing! I followed the recipe for the most part, but made some changes for my dietary needs: gluten free penne, gluten free Italian bread crumbs, and almond-coconut blend milk. It was the best thing I've ever made!

I sautee an onion and package of mushrooms to add. Use half the pesto and can fire-roasted tomatoes- I boil 4 chicken breasts then shred them using Kitchenaid mixer. Cook pasta (bowtie) in chicken water.   Its a crowd pleaser!

We loved this dish.  I did not change a thing  other then using diced tomatoes and I cut the recipe almost in half. People complain about it making so much but you can tell by the recipe it's going to make a lot so just cut it down  before you start it. It's not rocket science! For instance, 6 cups of chicken? Wow, way too much, I used probably 2 1/2 cups and we thought there was still too much in the casserole. There was no way I was going to put in 4 cups of cheese which is a lot to begin with but the Alfredo sauce already had a lot of cheese in it so I probably used not quite 2 cups. I also used maybe 12 oz. of pasta as I knew one 16 oz. box is going to be way more then we need. I bought one of those small jars of pesto and did not use all of that because a little goes a long way. I also made my own Alfredo sauce (the first time). I have never bought the stuff in the jar but when I looked at a couple jars at the store and saw the list of ingredients I thought it was simple enough to make my own. I bought a small plastic tub  of  Italian cheese blend which I noticed didn't have mozzarella in it so I added that to it. I don't like the bagged shredded stuff, it has potato starch in it to keep it from sticking together.
My husband doesn't usually say this but he said it was as good as a restaurant.

O.M.G!!!!! This was sooo good! I added sliced Kalamata and  green olives. I used diced tomatoes seasoned with basil, onion, and garlic. I used flavored Alfredo. I mixed everything the day before and refrigerated it. When it was time to cook the casserole, I put the breadcrumb topping on. It turned out to be a show stopper!! I can't wait to make it again. It does make quite a bit, so you may want to have the recipe.

Thanks Linda for a great recipe.  I made this for the first time, for a last minute family dinner, including invited guests.  Which could have been a disaster...  but this was delicious.  I used Tyson Shredded Chicken because my prep-time was limited.  I also only used one jar 8 oz pesto.  I had another jar but one looked like enough.  I had to exclude the tomato's as my husband is allergic.  So I added two jars of Alfredo sauce, and only one cup milk.   I used my large 11x14 inch casserole dish.  Thanks again, this will be a recipe that goes into our family recipe book.

I made this recipe for my sister's family when she was having surgery.  It was a  huge hit.  As others have mentioned, the recipe makes a lot of sauce, so I made two separate casseroles.  In the casserole for my sister, I made it exactly like the recipe says plus I added mushrooms because they are her favorite.  In the version I kept for my house, I switched the mushrooms for Broccoli, also very yummy.  My husband is my pickiest eater.  He doesn't like spinach or pesto, but he loved this recipe.  Everyone mentioned how much they liked the breadcrumb and parmesan crust, so don't leave that out.

Since I didn't have any parmesan cheese on hand, I substituted the Italian cheese blend in the crumb topping, and only used about half of the pesto. We had six adults and two children for dinner, (some who had seconds) and there were still leftovers. I got lots of compliments on this dish. Definitely a keeper!

This was very good.  I cooked the chicken in white wine to add more flavor to the chicken.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and took it to a dinner where it was appreciated.  It is very filling so you need a crowd to eat it, but it is easy to make.

I made this recipe without the chicken since my daughter is a vegetarian (but loves penne and pesto). This was delicious! It was a huge hit with my son. The flavors come together nicely. The meal is quite hearty and rich. I used one jar of pesto and two of the refrigerated containers of alfredo sauce for this meal.

THIS!!! THIS dish is OUTSTANDING! My family and friends all loved it. We ate it for three days. Nothing else, just this. Its addicting. Anyway...I made my own alfredo sauce and used that instead, and I used Colby cheese blend instead of Italian!

I just made this and it is beyond delicious. Followed the recipe pretty straightforward but added some mushrooms because... well I love mushrooms and it is definitely going into the rotation of weekly meals made. When people tell you but it makes a lot of food believe them because I filled up an entire 9 by 13 and 8 1/2 by 11 inch-pans with this concoction and froze the smaller of the two.

I made the whole recipe and believe when it says it makes a lot.  In my case it worked out it was shared with 3 other families.  We ALL LOVED IT!  I did make one unintentional change, I forgot to add the tomatoes - it was still amazing!

This was so good. I eliminated the tomatoes as my family has texture issues and same with the spinach. I halved the recipe and there was still a ton left over. We just loved this! Do go easy on the pesto- its strong. Wonderful.. thank you!!!

I've made this on special occasions for my wife for the last 3 years. I think I have made it 3 times...? Each time I make it the same,  follow the recipe almost exact except without tomatoes. I would of put them in, but I forgot to pick them up at the store. Anyway, its a delicious meal! I highly recommend it, and just be careful on the portion sizes. It does make A TON! Have a salad on the side to help curb the tendency to grab more than you need.

I have made this two times!!! I found this recipe by searching for something new to eat. I must say I love it! This time around I changed the cheese to the sargento Mexican blend and diced tomatoes. I love it either way. Thank you for this recipe you have saved my household since mc corrmick took away the chicken penne season package. This is now a staple in my recipe book!! One last thing I had never eaten spinach and in this dish it was good so I'm willing to try it different ways!

Added  sautéed zucchini, mushrooms and used plum tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes.  Would add sautéed red peppers next time. Made my own Alfredo sauce using cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, milk, butter and garlic.

I haven't made this, but rating it 5 since it sounds incredible. Question for you master home chefs: If I want to spare calories and eliminate the Alfredo sauce, will the recipe still work? Or should I sub in something else like sour cream, cream of chicken, etc?

This is my go to recipe for large family gatherings. All age groups enjoy it. This recipe makes a lot but you can freeze what you don't use it a ziplock. When you thaw it just pop it in the pan and top with the breading cheese crust.

This was so tasty I'm so glad I stumbled upon it. I wanted a special dish to cook for my mom as well as my 17mo old daughter and this was a total hit. I made the bread crumbs and Alfredo at home to opt for healthier versions and I used tomato/carrot penne. I only used one chicken breast cut up very small. I love the spinach in it as well as the combo of the pesto, alfredo, tomatoes, and cheese. I think it turned out perfect and next time I make it I will not change anything!

Good with changes.  I used only 7 oz of pesto (as suggested by others) and that was the right amount.  The problems with this recipe are that is makes way too much and is too salty.  I didn't even have a bowl or pot big enough to stir it all together and had to use my 6 quart slow cooker as a mixing bowl.  It made one 9x13 casserole and another 8x8.  I will make again but halve the recipe, make the alfredo sauce myself to cut back on the saltiness, add more spinach, and again use only 7 oz pesto.

I have made this recipe many times and it is a staple in my home. The best part of this recipe is that it makes enough that I can separate into two 9x13 pans and heat one for dinner that night and place the other in my freezer for a later date! I usually make to recipe but have at times changed the type of penne pasta used and I sometimes omit the breadcrumb topping.

Pretty simple and basic casserole that does the job. I could do without the breadcrumbs next time and just more cheese and I'd be happy. Fairly oily due to the sauces, so cut back on the pesto a tiny bit if that's an issue for you. I used fresh tomatoes.

Loved it.  I did make some alterations-- used a full 4 oz spinach, omitted the top layer of cheese and breadcrumbs, and took the pesto down to about 4 oz.  It all fit nicely in a 9x14" baking dish.  I covered with foil for the entire cooking duration.  Came out delicious, and plenty of servings for me and my fiance to enjoy for a few days.

I give this dish a solid 4 stars. It's yummy and very adaptable.  I half-ed the pesto and pasta and added 1/2 a jar of mushrooms because i had in the fridge.  Still made a 9x13 dish. Very easy to make.

This dish is tasty and great to eat throughout the week. I love pesto but this was a bit much, so I think I'll follow other suggestions to only use half the pesto. Also it does make a ton; I filled both a 9x13 and 8" round dish with this recipe! So I gave the round casserole to our neighbors who just had a baby girl :)

This was a great family comfort food meal! Per several reviews, I cut the recipe in half for my family of 4, it was plenty and we’ll still have it for leftovers tonight! To lighten it up a bit, I used lite jarred Alfredo sauce, about 1/2 cup less cheese, and a full can of tomatoes. I also added some balsamic vinegar, Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the chicken mixture since some reviewers said it wasn’t very flavorful......and we like a lot of flavor in our house. It was a hit, and will be added into the rotation for sure!

Crave-worthy deliciousness!  I was looking for a casserole that would have a similar taste to the pesto cavatoppi from Noodles & Co. and this hit the mark! I made 1 1/2 times the recipe amount which nicely filled two 11x13 pans. Fed it to a group of 4 families and got raves, even some of the pickier kids asked for seconds! Based on what I had on hand, I halved the pesto and reduced the cheese a bit, then added a can of mushrooms and a bit more pasta (whole wheat fusilli instead of penne), and omitted the bread crumb topping. I will make again!

I thought this is an amazing dish when feeding a crowd.  I doubled the recipe with the exception of the pesto sauce, I used two 5oz. containers.
When done this doubled recipe fills 3  9x13 dishes.  I was having a group of about 30 people over for a Holiday party and we served this, a big salad, and some amazing crusty bread.
Everyone loved it....  I have  a pan in the freezer now...has anyone ever frozen this before??  If so did you thaw it completely, or take from the freezer to the oven?  How long did you bake it...?  Thanks for any help you can give me!!

I doubled this recipe and made it for 25. I had plenty of leftovers for the week. Delicious and easy! I omitted the bread crumbs and just used Parmesan on top. I think I may try sun dried tomatoes next time.

My family loved this!  I was worried while it was baking because the garlic smell was so strong, but it turned out fine.  I omitted the tomatoes and used about 1 cup of spinach because that's all I had.  I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is delicious!! My fiancé and I were looking to make something different for dinner, when we came across this recipe . I followed the recipe as directed. The only 2 changes I made to the recipe were, I used mini pene pasta instead of the regular size and used a basil pesto Alfredo cream sauce blend, instead of separate bottles of pesto and Alfredo sauce . This is definitely a hit in our house and will be made again :)

I used a pesto packet instead of pre made and half a jar of Alfredo but it still came out so tasty! I also put some mozzarella to melt inbetween the bread crumbs and casserole and the melted cheese was delicious! A great dish to make in the beginning of the week and munch on throughout the week. Definitely recommend!

Great recipe, I omitted the breadcrumbs, added fresh broccoli, more Italian blend cheese, and more Parmesan. Fried three spiced(Seasoning salt, summer savory) chunked, chicken breast. I also topped the dish with the cheese blend, and Parmesan. Also cooked it with a casserole dish with a lid. Turned out great.

Loved it!  I got a late start on dinner, so I omitted the milk and put it in the oven just until it was hot and bubbly and the breadcrumbs were toasted. This kept it from being too runny....20 minutes in the oven would not have allowed the liquid to absorb. I used lite Alfredo sauce and fire roasted diced tomatoes, drained.  And rotesserie chicken....the whole thing was done in 30 minutes and soooo good!!

A little too much pesto for our tastes. My husband and sonwouldn't even eat it. I did and it was ok. If I were to make it again, I would double the alfredo sauce and use about 1/3 of the pesto sauce! I also left out the spinach.

Second time making. We don't drink cows milk so used soy... Still amazing! Also add a little more pesto because we love the flavor. Cook for 60 and turn off oven but leave in for another 20 for the crispy top. Love love love this!!

I made this casserole and took it to a family potluck.  My children couldn't believe it came from my kitchen!  I did cut the pesto in half (used only one jar), and it tasted fine.  Definitely a keeper!

My family loves this dish just the way the recipe says to make it! It's a keeper! We make it all the time!! Great leftovers too! And a great dish to make when you have company visiting as its delish & feeds a lot of people! Just add a salad and voila a meal sure to please any guest! I use gluten free penne and bread crumbs and I get my Parmesan and pesto from Costco. The chicken, I brown in oil and season with salt and pepper in a pan and then add broth and cover until cooked through the day or morning before. Super super duper!!!

Yummy!  I followed what others have said and halved the pesto sauce.  I used rotini pasta instead of penne.  I totally forgot to add the tomatoes but that's alright cuz it still turned out fantastic.  If I were to make it again, I'd use real tomatoes and add mushrooms.  Yum!

It has potential but it was too rich for me.  I added extra pasta, tomatoes, and spinach, and used a lighter alfredo recipe and still too rich.  If I make it again, I will use less cheese, and make the alfredo sauce even lighter by using less butter and whole milk instead of half and half.  I halved the recipe, used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, made my own alfredo sauce (so much better than store bought!) and I skipped the pesto.

I have made this recipe for friends and they love it. I use about 3/4 the amount of pesto, add garli, and put the bread crumbs on about 15 minutes after it starts cooking.  I am getting ready to make it now!.

I made this for a crowd. Easy to make for a crowd, which is what I was going for. Went over well, but somewhat a little cheesy for me. I would prefer it to be creamy.

It definitely makes too much. Based on the reviews I didn't add all the pesto.  I'm not a big fan of pesto so I only added a little.  To be perfectly honest it took me  awhile to make it.. I needed a huge bowl to be able to mix all the ingredients together. It just wasn't what I expected.  It was OK.  My husband liked it.  I wont make it again...

The pesto is very greasy with lots of olive oil.  I did not find it creamy at all, in fact it was very strong.  It smelled much better than it tasted.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!! I did, however, make a few changes to "healthify" it a bit. I made my own alfredo sauce (using cauliflower) and I used coconut oil to make my own pesto sauce. Even with those substitutions it was still a little bit heavy but so  good that I'm on my way to the store right now to get the ingredients and make it again!!

I love pesto and still think that this recipe is a bit heavy on the pesto.  My family loves this dish. I make it a but different every time: mushrooms instead of tomatoes, I've added shredded carrots... I love versatile recipes.

Pretty good. I only used 7 oz pesto because I was too cheap to buy more, but I think more actually would have been too much anyway. The crumb topping probably isn't necessary. Overall really liked it.

I don't think I have ever eaten a pasta dish this decadent and delicious! I followed the recipe as given, and it turned out beautifully! I highly recommend making this for a larger family, though, or halving the recipe, because it makes a lot!

Excellent dish!!!! I love pasta so much, and it combines many flavors I already love so much on their own, but together?!?!?! Watch out!!! An unbeatable combo for sure!! It actually reminded me of Parma Rosa sauce which I used to get (made by knorr) and absolutely gobbled it up everytime I made it!! It is so good ;) it is definitely added to our dinner rotation. Thanks for a great recipe!

I really like this a lot!!! It's not a super saucy sauce so if you like it saucy I recommend using half a box of noodles... I also used Panko instead of Italian bread crumbs and it was so crunchy and delish!!!

This is a keeper. Next time I will add more pesto (home made is the only way to go). That is more for personal taste. My husband had three servings and I had 2. It does make a lot even after I altered the recipe to feed 6 because I like left overs.

This recipe is a winner, and I plan to make it again! It is just as good without the chicken, for those vegetarians out there. I chopped the spinach and also used chopped (in the food processor) fresh tomatoes instead of canned. So many flavors! It was a huge hit at my dinner party.

Delicious! I've loved this dish since the first time I made it, using jarred alfredo. Nowadays I also make my own alfredo since I prefer that to storebought. :) Great recipe!

Made this recipe for dinner last night.  It was a definite hit and a 'do-over'.  The only thing I did was add a bit of garlic powder.  I divided the batch in half and made 1/2 without the chicken for my vegetarian friend.  Very very good recipe!!!!

Talk about delicious, not to mention easy!
I followed the recipe closely, although I used less chicken (4 cups) only because it was all I had on hand. My hungry wrestlers loved it!! This recipe has become a family staple. Its also great for team parties. Its got quantity and taste, and its much better than the proverbial bucket of chicken.

My son loved it. I added alittle garlic salt and I had to use diced tomatoes because I didn't have crushed. My son said it would have taste better with allittle salt. It did make a lot more than I expected so I put some in a smaller baking dish and took it to work. Everyone loved it. I would make it again but I will try using crushed tomatoes next time and some salt or more garlic salt.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted fine although it had a bit to much cheese and pesto!  Very rich in taste. My younger kids didn't really enjoy it however my older kids and husband and I did

This was very good.  The only changes I made were to use thawed frozen chopped spinach and a can of diced tomatoes because that's what I had.  I also probably used less chicken - I had one very large breast, not sure how many cups.  We thought the seasoning was perfect (we like pesto).  It was yummy and filling and perfect for week night meals since it will last several nights.  Great comfort food for a cold winter night.  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing recipe filled with flavor.........used less pesto, more spinach that I tore into smaller pieces, sautéed mushrooms, garlic and some chopped red pepper, then stirred the chicken into that before adding to mixing bowl, a dash of cumin and smoked paprika and off to the oven! It does make a ton, but that was just right for handing out small casseroles to friends and family while saving enough for myself. Would highly recommend everyone try this dish!
Tip: use light Alfredo sauce and fat free cheese to lighten the end product, while keeping the great taste.

I made this recipe, but did not put the milk in, halved the pesto and added garlic powder and it was very good. I was thinking it would even be good meatless and will try that next time.

We really liked this recipe. Next time I will omit the chicken.  It was high in calories and quite costly to make, but it was delicious, fast and easy, so I will make it again.

Delicious and super easy! I used light Alfredo sauce which is fine. Go easy on the milk. I don't think it needs as much as the recipe calls for and I used skim milk-about 3/4 cup. Filled the 13x9 glass pan to the brim. With a side salad this dish will easily feed 6.

Very good, and I made as written, but used 8oz of Pesto...everything else I followed...It did make a large 14X10 Pan full.Next time, I will add a sautéed chopped onion, 3-6 miced cloves of garlic,and an 8 oz jar marinated artichokes, chopped...I really wanted to add to this, but this time I wanted to try as written. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is a very heavy dish that is too rich. It would be fine if you had to feed several teenage boys after hockey practice. Its a lot of food but I wouldn't bring it to a pot luck at work because its "too much"-too much fat, cheese, salt, heaviness and the fresh flavours get lost in the dish. Sorry!

I have made this recipe several times and everyone eats it with gusto. A few times I couldn't make it exactly as written and my inadvertent modifications were great. In a pinch, 1/2 cup cream can be substituted for the milk. Breaded chicken patties are ok (I was desperate). Italian style diced tomatoes work well. Reduced fat alfredo sauce is just fine.The one thing I noticed is that a thick firm pasta is needed. I attempted to make this with bow tie pasta once and it was a mushy mess. I love this, it comes together quickly, tastes great and I make it often.

I read the recipe at 5 pm tonight and went to the store to get the ingredients we didn't have in the pantry. I used a whole cooked chicken and Paul Newman's Alfredo sauce (although I usually make my own). By 7:40 I had dinner on the table. My family of five loved it!  We renamed it Italian Chicken Mac & Cheese. We had a ton of left overs to freeze for later quick meals!  This would also make a great dish for a pot luck! It's a keeper!

Yummmmo. So I made a few little changes to make it more "mass" friendly but very tastey all in all. I just left out the tomatoes and spinach and I used premade turkey meatballs instead of chicken (cause I forgot to thaw it out) this was super good and enjoyed by all (even my 3yr old!).  Creamy. Flavorful.  A crowd pleaser (even for my super picky crowd!)

Good flavor, but way too heavy. I'd make it again, but I'd cut the ingredients in half and then probably add even less of the Alfredo sauce, pesto, and cheese.

Love this recipe! Can't get enough! I have made numerous times with demands for more! I do double the cayenne but that's the only change I've made.

I followed the recipe to the T. With the exception of following a couple of tips and cut the Pesto in half.  I like pesto, but not everyone does so I cut it down.  If I make it again I will use the full 15oz jar.  

I thought it was 3 stars OK. However I gave it 4 stars because I took it to a potluck dinner and everyone really enjoyed it, a couple of people asked for the recipe and my fiance thought it was 'pretty good'.

Liked but needs more spice. Made half with only 4 oz pesto and used 9X9 pan. Used frozen chicken cubes thawed. Will make again.Next time will try more pesto and maybe garlic, pepper, oregano.

This pasta is delicious!  I made it this evening. The only thing I changed was that I used a 8 oz jar of pesto, rather than 16 oz.  Very flavorful..."restaurant style". :-)

Very easy recipe to make.  I halved it and froze one in a tinfoil baking pan for later.  I tried to cut down on calories and used low fat cheese, light alfredo sauce and skim milk.  It may have helped some, but this is an indulgent type of recipe that is very good.  I doubled the spinach because I had extra and wanted to use it up.  You can't taste the spinach in this dish.  I will make this again.

I made this last night with only one change. Halved the pesto as other reviewers suggested. WOW is all I can say. My husband & I LOVED it. The flavors are amazing. Leftovers are a must. It bests any restaurant dish. It does make a lot, so shared with neighbors who also raved. Will definitely make again, especially for a crowd.

This dish was more thank I expected. Every bite was delicious. This is a restaurant quality dish that I will serve guests! Next time I will use one less cup of chicken because I thought it was a little too much. In fact, the dish would be just fine without the chicken if preferred. Great dish!

I halved the recipe, and quartered the amt of pesto I put the cheese on the top, like a lasagna. I am gluten-free so used gf pasta and no breadcrumbs. Very yummy, will definitely make this one again!

My husband loved it but I thought the pesto was too strong. My daughter didn't care for it. Will make again but with some changes. Less pesto and chicken being the biggest changes. More spinach for sure and probably add some mushrooms as well!

I really liked this recipe. I made my own pesto, without nuts, to be roughly the amount called for, about a cup and a half.  I didn't think it was too much. I also made my own alfredo and bread crumbs which did make more work and clean up, but end product was great, and love all the leftovers. Once thing I would change is to use less chicken, probably about half.  Overall great recipe!

Amazing! This is a dish my kids will remember me by someday when they are grown. Seriously, it is that good! My four year-old ate a plate full, which is a good thing because it makes enough to feed a dinner party. I may reduce the pesto by half next time, but either way, it will be delicious. My husband couldn't get enough. Thanks for sharing!

This dish was delicious...reminded me of a pasta I would order in a restaurant. I added more spinach just because I love it. Turns out very pretty with the different colors. I will definitely make this again and think it would also serve well for a dinner party.

I made this as written except I changed to recipe to feed 48 (rather than 12). It actually made five 9 X 13 pans. Very yummy. Easy to make. Lots of people asked for the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe for my family a few nights ago.  It was awesome! I followed the recipe as it is written with two exceptions. 1) I used 6 average sized fresh Roma tomatoes instead of the canned tomatoes (simply because I forgot to buy the canned tomatoes). 2) I marinated the cooked chicken in the pesto sauce for about 10 minutes after I cooked it and before adding it to the cheese, spinach, tomato mixture. After their very first bite of this dish, my husband and my two sons all immediately stated, "This ones a keeper!" I will make this recipe for them again and again and again! Thank you so much for sharing it with us!!

My family loved this!  I even had enough leftovers to share with the in-laws (they love me when I feed them, ha!).  As last night was the first time we made this, I have to admit that I totally forgot about adding the crushed tomatoes, my bad!  However, it turned out absolutely awesome and I'm not sure if I will add them in the next time....why fix it if it ain't broke!  We followed the recipe to a T (sans tomatoes) and it filled my 9x13 baking dish to the rim.  Will definitely feed a lot of people.  I'm thinking this dish would be great to "keep warm" in a crock pot to take for a potluck.  Thank you, Linda, for sharing such a great recipe :)

This is a great, hearty casserole.  I agree with others that it makes a lot, so I purchased an extra large disposable 10 x 14 pan and it was perfect.  I tore the spinach into small pieces, instead of leaving whole.  I also used only 8 oz of pesto, instead of the 15 oz called for in the original recipe.  In the future, I would probably add more italian cheese to the top before adding the bread crumb topping, as I like things very cheesy.   Our family and my friend's family all enjoyed it tremendously.  The leftovers this morning were perfect!

This was amazing - restaurant quality and so simple. Great combination of flavors and textures. (used can of diced tomatoes I had; other than that, followed exactly).  Make full recipe, use one casserole for yourself, and take another to a friend in need.  It's the perfect dish to share!

I am writing this review just after we sat down to enjoy this delicious meal!  Wow!  We felt like we were at a five star restaurant! The good news is that I have six kids, five are boys and there was barely enough! I made the mistake of listening to other reviews and I cut some of the pesto sauce, I feel like it would have been fine with the entire amount.  Still an excellent meal and oh so easy to make! I also doubled the breadcrumbs/parmesan cheese topping and I'm glad I did because it was a good addition!
Thank you so much for sharing this amazing recipe:)Such a refreshing change to plain old chicken!

LOVED this dish!  It was a big hit.  I used my own homemade pesto sauce as well as a recipe for Alfredo sauce from allrecipes.com.  Super delicious.

I loved it! I halved the recipe, and it filled a 9" x 13" pan easily. The only alterations I made to the recipe was doubling the tomatoes, and using a couple more tablespoons more olive oil in the topping (so it would actually brown), and then doubling the amount of topping. It was a little on the salty side, so next time I would use panko breadcrumbs instead of Italian seasoned ones. It didn't need the extra seasoning. LOVE that pesto flavor!

I loved this recipe! I just tweaked it a little to meet our family needs (a little more of this, a little less of that) but not by much! I will definitely be making it again!

I have to agree with Sunflower. Just by looking at the recipe you can see it's not low fat, but comfort food. If you want low fat then you'll have change the recipe. I'm making this recipe tonight and I know my family will love it. I'll make a salad for myself as my main meal and a small scoop of this as a "side."

Love Pesto, Love Alfrado, but this combination was just a meltdown of flavors that you would have expected. Considering the cost of the ingredients this just does not deliver. Stick with just making your favorite Pesto or Alfrado recipe. I won't be making this again.

This was very good. But did not have enough pesto flavor! I just made a batch of fresh pesto and this came in my daily dish the next day, so I thought "why not?" For all you reading the reviews and considering halving the amount of pesto, don't do it! Also, do not use Italian diced tomatoes. I'm a die-hard for their delicious flavor, but they will not make this dish the way it's intended! 

I usually cook from a recipe, and then change things the way I feel I want to eat/taste (I do not tend to write reviews when I do.) Many of them end up the way a collective recipe would be from the people who suggest changes. But then you miss the point of the pesto. Yes, I'm passionate about it. I will choose any dish for the word. If you are like me, I would skip the recipe if you are hoping for pesto-deliciousness.  

Other things. It didn't need 4C of cheese. 3 is plenty and cheaper (I'm not trying to make it healthy!) It doesn't need 6C of chicken. 3C still ensured plenty of meat (though I will contend that if you add all 6C then I suppose you want all 4C of cheese.) Finally, this does make a lot more than a 9x13 as written. With the only difference being 3C meat versus 6, it was completely overflowing.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!!!  With only two people living in my household, we were able to eat off this one casserole for almost a week!!!  And, like most pasta and Italian dishes, it only got better after it was refrigerated and reheated because the flavors FURTHER melded together.  I did change two things though...I added some fresh garlic into the mix, and I also used "garlic and herb" breadcrumbs and a squeeze of lemon in the topping.  YUM YUM YUM!!!!  Thank you for this great recipe!!!

Even my picky eater kids asked for seconds. I would not change a thing! We used barilla plus penne so to increase the protein content. If you are going to eat pasta you might as well get a ton more protein too and it doesn't affect taste. This was a winner

I've been making this recipe for a couple years.  The only thing different I do is instead of using plain crushed tomatoes, I use Red Gold's garlic and olive oil diced tomatoes, drained.  Yummy!

So delicious. I liked that it didn't use a canned soup base, and that there were no ingredients that you couldn't safely sample so you could season it to taste. I suspect there are hundreds of "perfect" ways to tweak this.

This turned out great!  I did make my own Alfredo sauce since I have yet to find a jarred sauce we like.  For everyone who thinks the pesto is too strong a flavor...try an unusual pesto like broccoli pesto, or kale pesto.  I've used both with great results!  You could even use those in place of the spinach, but I'd microwave the kale to soften it up a bit first.  Now I'm off to find a nice tomato pesto recipe for a real game changer.  Thanks for a very inspiring recipe!

Recipe was very tasty and easy to prepare.  I reduced the amount of pesto a little since my husband is very "picky".  Great casserole to make for a potluck or gathering.

LOVE this recipe!  I agree with those who halve the pesto, and I only put bread crumbs on the portion I know we will eat the first night.  I don't care for bread crumbs reheated (personal preference). Oh, and I use the light Alfredo. Enjoy!

Delicious! I used my own homemade (lower fat) version of alfredo sauce since I don't generally care for the jarred kind anyway.  Really good overall though

I deleted the spinach and added a can of quartered artichokes and two yellow squashes cubed & sauteed. I used a 10 ounce jar of pesto. I also used diced, smoked tomatoes with garlic. I deboned a whole roasted chicken and cubed it - still not 6 cups but enough. Next time, I think I'll delete the pasta and try more vegetables like zucchini. I don't think the bread crumbs and cheese on top added much. Will skip that. Lots left to freeze which I like. My family loved it!

This recipe is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!  Thank you so much Linda for sharing.  My family and friends are always wanting more of this.  I wouldn't let folks give me heartburn that don't even have the curtosy to try something before commenting.  It's like saying a dress won't look good on you without trying it on.

This dish is excellent! My family really liked it, even my 18 month old. I added mushrooms and didn't add as much pesto but other than that made according to the recipe. Thanks Linda!

My two young girls and husband loved this dish!! I get a little burned out on the casserole dishes but this was amazing. I did use a little less pesto like others said and a little less chicken but that was the only change I made. My husband is the chef in our house and is very picky so that fact that he loved it made my day. He liked it even more the next day in his lunch. I will be making this again soon!

Use sundried tomatoes--it's amazing!
Also, I didn't have Italian cheese, so I used cream cheese. So good!

Entirely too much pesto--7 oz. would have been plenty.  I may try it again but will halve the dish--I needed my deepest 9x13 and another 2-qt. dish.  Also was a bit dry, so will add in some chicken broth next time during baking.

We halved the pesto and thought that was a good idea.  I didn't have a 4-cheese blend, so I used mozzarella and parmesan, though my Alfredo was a 4-cheese flavor.  This fit into our 9x13 pan no problem.

This is more than five stars.  I loved this so much that I had to share with family at my niece's house, while we were there for her wedding last year. Everyone loved it and I had to give them the recipe. The people on here that gave it one star must have no taste buds.  Need I say any more!!!

I really liked this. Good flavor. It does make a lot. I left out the milk because I thought it wasnt needed, but I think I was wrong I think it would have been even better with the milk. Yum!

I think this recipe is great! I made my own cheese blend of mozzarela, cheddar and mazythra cheese and left the spinach out since my fiancee and i dont like cooked spinach. This one will be a favorite in my house.

Have made numerous times.  Substitutions/Additions because of preference:  additional cheese on top instead of breadcrumbs, diced instead of crushed tomatoes, frozen spinach well drained instead of fresh, half regular basil pesto and half sun-dried tomato pesto, sauteed onion and minced garlic (we like garlic), chicken chopped and cooked with onion and garlic.  Very easy and tasty!!!  Rave reviews and recipe requested always!

I have to say that this dish was amazing!!I changed a few of the amounts listed. I used a whole bag of baby spinach since we love it and it cooks down anyway. I only used about 1c of milk. I put in less alfredo sauce and only about 2c of the Italian cheese blend. I think 4c is too much. The 9X13 baking pan was fillled to capacity. My family absoulutey loved it. I would recommend using more spinach like I did. I think it really enhances the flavor. This dish was a winner!

Wow!  This is so so good. I halved the recipes and substituted sauteed mushrooms for the spinach because that's what I had on hand. It's been gobbled up by me and my boyfriend for two days now. It's hard to keep your hands off of! Good job!!!

Had some cooked chicken left over and found this recipe. Impressed, the only thing I altered was to add coriander and cumin (and black pepper) to the tomatoes.  My whole family loved it.  Many thanks!

This recipe is simple to make and absolutely delicious!I have made it several times and have taken it to an Italian dinner potluck, served it to guests, and just served as a regular family dinner. Every single time I am asked for the recipe and get raves about it. It makes a very large amount so I have been putting it in a 11x14 glass baking pan to bake. I have been doubling the crumb topping and sometimes add sliced artichoke hearts and sun dried tomatoes. I don't think I have been adding 4 cups of cheese to it however, just a few handfuls of whatever white cheese I happen have in the fridge.  Definietly a keeper recipe the kids will always ask for

This was sooooo good! I halved the recipe since it was just for my husband and myself. It was still a lot, but we only had 1/4 of the casserole left over. I didn't have any seasoned bread crumbs, so instead I used crushed up saltines and seasoned them myself with garlic and seasoning salt. It turned out wonderful. I too took other reviewers advice and halved the pesto sauce, and the flavor was perfect. I also seasoned the chicken while cooking it, my husband is VERY picky about his chicken, but he really liked this, so thank you for a dish that includes chicken that my husband will eat! I will definitely make again. Thank you for the wonderful recipe. :)

This would be probably excellent just as submitted, but I didn't have Alfredo sauce, we're not fans of tomatoes, and I didn't have the cheese blend.  Bread crumbs and Parmesan topping did the trick.   I had to substitute with some heavy cream,  cream of chicken soup and additional water, but let me say, it WORKED.  Either way, I'll be making this on a regular basis.

This recipe is amazing!!! Just made it tonight and it was a hit! I had to half the recipe, and still had a FULL 9x13 dish. The only changes were that I sautéed sliced mushrooms and about 2 teaspoons of mined garlic and added that to the mix. Otherwise, healthy or not, I don't care, it was wonderful. Thanks so much for this recipe!

I love it so much.  It made a lot for my family size.  Didn't have to use a lot of pesto sauce as listed.  It took about 4 oz to use.  It is a keeper.

Husband loved this, wants it every night.
I forgot the pesto and it was still fabulous. I sauted Pork instead of chicken with onions and garlic. Husband allergic to chicken.

This was pretty good! I had a bunch of basil in my garden so I made fresh pesto and homemade alfredo sauce instead of jar stuff.  I forgot about the bread crumbs so I just omitted.  My family liked.  Its a bit of a heavy dish though. so i don't think I will make it often.

Really good and easy.  I did adjust to what I had on hand.  Cut the pesto to 1/2 a small jar, used light alfredo, added a container of mushrooms, used fire roasted diced tomatoes (drained), panko unseasoned bread crumbs and sprayed them with butter flavored pam.  Also only used about 1/2 the chicken it called for and used a box of whole grain rotini pasta.  It was really good!  I'll make it again.  The only thing I will note:  I would cut up or tear the spinach.

I gave it 5 stars even though I tweaked it after reading some of the other reviews. We loved it! I halved the pesto and I used low fat pesto and low fat alfredo sauce. I forgot the milk which could be why mine turned out a little dry. I also halved the crushed tomatoes because my husband has this thing against eating chicken with red sauce. As per one recommendation, I added some shredded mozzarella on top of the casserole but under the breadcrumbs. I finally have an alternative to a basic baked ziti for a crowd! I would only make this once or twice a year though because it makes so much and even with using low fat sauces it's a little high in calories. But it really is worth making it was SO tasty!

This is very good and easy to make, but it's also extremely rich.  Because of this, I would recommend halfing this recipe, even if you need servings for 4 adults.  If not, be prepared to freeze the rest!  Also, I would reduce the pesto by 25% and add some chopped tomatoes.  Great recipe!

I tried cutting this recipe down because it is just my husband and I. Some of the noodles dried out while baking. The parts that had the sauce were good. I may or may not attempt to make this again.

This was a huge hit for my family! I cut the pesto in half, left out the milk and only used 3 cups of cheese to make it a little less fatty and it was completely Dione. My mom, who doesn't usually like casserole said it was amazing! So thank you Linda:)

Delicious!!!  One of the most tasty dishes I've ever made.  I followed the suggestions in the reviews I read - only 7 oz of pesto (instead of 15 oz) and I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed.  I also sauteed mushrooms and yellow squash and added them to the dish.  The reviews also stated this dish made alot so I only used 3/4 box of pasta and my dish was overflowing.  Of course you could put the extra in another dish.  I HIGHLY recommend this dish.

I cook every night and im pretty good at it. This lacked flavor and was a waste of time making. Pre time was way to long and the cost of these meal was more than I would like it to be. I wouldnt make this again.

This was ok, but I think this recipe can be so subjective due to the varieties of pesto and alfredo. The only change I made was to use plain panko bread crumbs in place of seasoned ones.

My family loved this -  even my hubby who is NOT a chicken/alfredo fan at all had two big helpings.  My son said it tasted like something he would get at a restaurant.  The only things I did different - I cooked the chicken breasts all day in my slow cooker so I shredded the chicken rather than cutting into cubes.  I think that really helped it hold the sauce & cheeses.  I don't care for crushed tomatoes so I used some that were diced and in garlic and olive oil (drained first).  I used bow-tie pasta because I had it on hand.  I planned to halve the pesto based on other reviews, but I forgot.  However, my family thought it was just fine with the full 15 ounces.  It made a large 9x13 baking dish full (like lasagna) so there were plenty of leftovers for everyone's lunches.  This is a keeper!

This is so delicious!  Our whole family loved it.  I will definitely make it again!  I also cut the recipe in half and to make it a little healthier, I used whole wheat pasta, light alfredo sauce and nonfat milk.  I'm so glad to have discovered this recipe. Thank you!

My boyfriend is not a pesto fan so I decided to nix the Alfredo and the Pesto and use 1 Jar of Regular Marinara instead. It was DELICIOUS! My boyfriend absolutely LOVED it and he is picky about what he eats. I did not use full measurements of the ingredients- and like everyone else I think it's safe to say that halfing it will do just fine.

This is really really GOOD. We baked the chicken in some olive oil and shook some Italian seasoning over it. I'm sure plain chicken works with this recipe, but I think the coating made it tastier.

This was awesome!  The prep time was a little longer but it was worth it. So flavorful and not so rich as chicken Alfredo.

So good!  Added some frozen broccoli, left out the spinach.  Halved the recipe and it needed a 9x13 dish.

This dinner is fantastic!! I was able to feed 4 adults (2 of them pregnant women) and a picky child several servings with half the casserole left over. 

I followed the directions step by step except that I cooked the chicken in a skillet before mixing all the ingredients together. 

I will definitely be making this again. Thanks so much for sharing!!!!!

I admit I was afraid of the pesto- never used it before.  Used half of what was called for-  This was so delicious I would have gone back for thirds if no one was looking.  Cut the recipe in half per other recoomendations, but I think I will be making the other half very soon!

This dish is wonderful! I used 1/2 the amount of pesto,used Alfredo sauce w/ mushrooms and artichoke hearts instead of the spinach. Of course, I added garlic to the mix also, this was so good. Definatley a keeper, Thanks :)

I must say this was a very easy and delicious dish. I halved the recipe and it still made alot. I did follow one of the suggestions and used diced tomatoes instead of the crushed but everything else I kept the same and everyone raved about how good it tasted.

Fabulous and filling. A new family favorite and also an addition to my freezer cooking co-op swap menu list!

Yep, it does make a lot - but that is bonus points! Freeze half before baking. I froze the noodles and mixture in separate bags.

I read the previous reviews and used 1/2 the pesto sauce; however, I will use the full portion next time as it was lacking a little zest for my family's preference.

Additionally, I used 3 cups of chicken with 3 cups of artichokes (I used whole artichokes in water and cut in half) - very yummy!

Great job and thanks for sharing Linda!

This is a wonderful recipe and very easy to prepare.  I took the advice and halved the pesto.  It made a lot (two pans full) but the leftovers were very good.  I made it with vegetable oil (out of olive oil) and it was still excellent!  Maybe next time I will use broccoli instead of spinach...because there will definitely be a next time!

Only three stars on this first try.  The flavors worked well together and it was a beautiful looking dish, but it turned out very dry.  I made my own alfredo with ff cream and olive oil spread to decrease the fat content somewhat. As others suggested, I decreased the amount of pesto and I did not use quite as much cheese--about 2 cups.  The family really liked it and my 13 year old is excited that we are having left-overs tonight.  I am going to add some more milk and maybe a touch more cheese on top during warm up.  All-in-all very tasty and definitely one I would recommend.

So good!  The only change I had was using ham instead of chicken (only because I had leftover ham),  and I made alfredo sauce.  Will be making quite a bit!

Made this last night and it was amazing.  The smell lingers in my house still and I am totally okay with that.  I seasoned the chicken while cooking it with some minced garlic and montreal chicken seasoning and it was great.  Will make it again for sure.

I made my own Alfredo sauce because like a lot of others, I don't care for the stuff in a jar. I followed it otherwise tho except used 1 1/2 4 oz jars of pesto. I am cooking for a crowd tonight, so hope they will love it. The jarred pesto was very good and no work! Semi homemade has nothing on us:-)

I'm currently a Peace Corps Volunteer in Albania, and this was the perfect recipe to bring some VARIETY to my table!  Pesto isn't available everywhere, but I was lucky to find some!  And I made my own alfredo sauce since the jars don't yet exist here. When it was all said and done, the dish met rave reviews.  We all loved it and I'll be making it again... as soon as I get my hands on some more pesto!

Literally just made this. AMAZING! I don't like jarred sauce so i used 1 alfredo and 2 pesto packets of Knorr along with the milk. (i will use 2 alfredo packets next time.) I think i'll cook the chicken with some garlic next time also. This really does make A LOT. but the kid and the hubby are STILL eating, so maybe the pan will be gone by tomorrow? Thanks submitter.

Fantastic recipe!!  Like other reviewers, I used half the amount of Pesto (I can't imagine that I would have wanted any more) and I only had 4 cups of chicken.  So fast, easy, and so delicious - and makes 2 X 3qt casserole dishes.  Perfect to share, freeze, or feed a crowd!  Thanks Linda - this is a keeper!

This was excellent.  I did have to leave out the milk because I didn't have enough, so I filled the alfredo sauce jar half-full with water and shook it to get the least of the sauce out of the jar.  I used that water/sauce mixture (about 8 oz) in place of the milk.  

One thing I learned was that my largest Pyrex bowl (a HUGE, yellow bowl from that classic four-color/four bowl set our grandmothers used) was only barely large enough to stir the sauce/chicken/spinach/cheese mixture.  I ended up putting on latex gloves and working it together with my hands.  I had to do the same thing when I added the sauce mixture to the cooked pasta, as the pot in which I cooked the pasta was barely large enough to hold the entire pasta/sauce mixture, let alone stir it.  When I make this again, I will use my largest stainless steel bowl and a huge stock pot that I usually reserve for canning.  That way, I know I'll have enough room to thoroughly mix the ingredients without making a mess or needing to use my hands.  So, that's my advice.  If you think the bowl you're using is large enough, pick one that is even larger before you start cooking.

The entire mixture fit into 2 casserole dishes--one 9x13 and an 8x8, which I refrigerated (uncooked) and sent home with a guest, along with the recipe.

This dish was flavorful, easy to serve, and needed no additions.  Some people added some shredded Romano cheese and a bit of cracked black pepper, but others enjoyed it exactly as it was.

Too Much and Too Oily.  This recipe was too much for my 9x13 pan, (needed a second pan,) and ended up VERY oily. The flavor is really good, but puddles of oil on the plate is not an option for my family. Changing the pesto to a less oily option might fix this.
