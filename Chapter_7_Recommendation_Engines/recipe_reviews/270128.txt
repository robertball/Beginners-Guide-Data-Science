This came out really good, but it is more of a soup to me than stew. Maybe some of the issue is that I didn't know what the recipe submitter meant by beef soup with mushrooms. I skipped that and used beef broth in place of most of the water.  Also I used Golden Mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom. The meat was very tender and it  had a nice flavor.
