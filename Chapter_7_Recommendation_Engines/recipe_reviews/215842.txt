This recipe was VERY easy to make and really filling. I made the full 6 servings, but was only serving two. I was able to refrigerate the leftovers and took them to work for lunches, and it tasted just as good days later. The cheesy sauce is really rich and heavy, so maybe reduce the amount of cheese you use if you're looking for something a little lighter.

The title of the recipe is fitting. This was super easy to make and it was also very yummy. The kids love all things pasta and they ate every last bite, which surprised me because of the spinach. They said the loved the sauce, which I suspect covered up the spinach taste for them.

Love this.  The receipe was easy and delicious.  I did add some italian sausage to the recipe just because my husband is a meat eater and I didn't think he'd eat it without meat added.  It was good and I'm sure it would have been just as good without the sausage.  I have just recently begun trying new pasta recipes and was skeptical about the sauces combined together but it was great.  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious recipe.  Will make again for sure.
used my own marinara sauce, to which I added a cream sauce instead of Alfredo, and eliminated the last Tsp Italian seasoning.  My husband and really enjoyed this.  Served with pork chops and a salad.

My family really loved this.  I left out the alfredo and just went with the red sauce. I also added some chopped fresh kale which I sauted along with some zucchini. I find its easier to get my kids to eat dark green veggies when they are in a red pasta sauce.

My family absolutely loves this recipe.  The only thing I do differently is I use one big package of cheese tortellini and one small bag.  I also prefer it with fresh spinach when I have the time to chop it.  Best part -- kids love it and don't realize they are eating spinach.  :)

This was a big hit with the family.  I added onions and ground Italian sausage.  It was awesome and super easy, great for a last minute dinner!
