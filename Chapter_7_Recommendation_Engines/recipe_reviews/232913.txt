Followed this recipe to the letter, and I do think they're a little "light" in flavor.  They cooked up nicely, the soft texture is perfect, but as my husband said "...the peanut butter flavor doesn't jump out at you."   Although I wouldn't say this now will be my all-time favorite peanut butter cookie, I will say that I like the soft texture more,  it's a good cookie, and I would make it again.  Thanks Malki in Minneapolis for sharing your recipe with us.

I love this recipe! Easy, quick, delicious; I altered this recipe by adding a half a bag of chocolate chips and it worked out perfectly.

These cookies were great!  And they do stay soft like the recipe says.  Only change I made to the recipe was accidental.  I missed the part about chilling the dough.  But, they turned out fantastic anyways.

The cookies turned out great, soft and a nice peanut butter taste, a couple extra steps than traditional recipe I have, but I like the softer cookie, so it was worth the extra effort.

I love peanut butter cookies, but the no-flour ones tend to make me feel a little sick from the greasiness. These were great.
