While not a 5-star dish, which I take to mean "memorable," this is still very good. I halved the recipe for the two of us, and substituted Italian parsley for the cilantro.  I also added some chunky portabella mushrooms and minced, fresh garlic.  I wasn't sure how the Balsamic vinegar would fly in this recipe and was tempted not to use it. But in fairness to Lenie's recipe I did use it, and it was amazingly delicious! Eating this we felt we really were doing something healthy and good for our bodies--very little fat, few calories, nutritious vegetables, and the right type of carbs. We enjoyed this,and ate every last bit of it! Definitely worth making again, or trying for the first time.

I  didn't cook veggies first, just piled veggies on a sheet of foil, topped with fish, (seasoned salt and lots of pepper on fish) drizzled with evoo and balsamic (more balsamic to taste), sealed it up and popped in toaster convection oven. Used dried basil and cilantro cuz I was out of fresh. Didn't have the zucc but added in some broccoli, it worked. Served over brown rice.  Really enjoyed it, thanks!

The veggies were good- the fish was pretty flavorless, even though I drizzled olive oil and fresh lemon-pepper over it.  I used halibut (maybe my fish was bad or something).  I think I will eat the leftover veggies over rice, but maybe use the rest of the fish in a fish chowder or something.

This recipe really surprised my family! I skipped the olives, but followed the rest of the recipe. I loved the way all the vegetable flavors mived with the herbs. The zucchini added a tiny bit of cunchiness and fresh cilantro a bit of a zing. My 10 year old son tried it and ended up asking for seconds. I served it with mashed potatoes and we all loved it!

This was really good! My dad has high cholesterol, so I made it for my parents as a healthy dish. Substituted tilapia for cod. Next time I would add less onion and another tomato.

A great new way to cook fish. Very tasty. I used whole green pepper, 8 oz of baby portobello mushrooms and 3/4 of yellow squash, skipped olives and zucchini. I thought that balsamic vinegar will taste too sour, so I used sherry cooking wine instead. Also, to reduce "fishy smell" I added 1/4 fresh ginger root, very thinly sliced.
The fish and the vegetables were very tender. 
My boyfriend is not a big fan of squash, but he did not even noticed it in the dish!
A little too much sauce for my taste, but definitely will make again!

We love vegetable combinations with fish and this one with the squash was great.  I had lots of chives to use from garden so used them in greater quantities and skipped onions and shallots; used stuffed green olives instead of black; and only used fresh basil due to lack of other herbs.  Added at least 1 tsp. red pepper flakes.  It's been hot this week, and the leftovers were also good just at room temperature, served over steamed spinach.

I made it exactly according to the recipe.  Next time I will reduce it to one large onion, and put the herbs on the fish on both sides.  My whole family ate it, and so that puts it in the win column, as I have a lot of family members who don't love fish.

It was good, not spectacular. Needs some crunch  and/or something  stronger seasoning... something sour? More balsamic vinegar?

It turned out really well. It had a great taste. My husband liked it as well. I did not make any substitutions or omissions. I think this may be my new healthy option for fish as opposed to frying. In fact, it tasted so good I repeated  the same recipe, the following day, but  used chicken thighs instead.

I really enjoyed this dish and would have been better if I had sauteed the zucchini, squash, olives and tomatoes (I didn't have time).
The dish would have been even better with a little cayenne.  It needed a little kick.
The cod was good, but I think I'd like the dish better with salmon.
I used 3 leeks instead of onions and used a whole green pepper, zucchini and squash instead of a half.  The balsamic was a wonderful addition and should not be left out.
We did not add cilantro because no one in the family really cares for it.
Salt and pepper are critical and it will be incredibly bland if enough is not added (I salted and peppered both sides of the cod).
I will definitely be making this again!

Was ok, didnt really play up on the flavor and texture of the cod. Needs some garlic and maybe some spice, like red chili flakes. Thats what ill be using next time! Very tasty!

The first time I tried this recipe, it was DELICIOUS! The second time I tried it... it wasn't what I would call delicious. The first time I made it, I used tilapia and the cut was thin. The second time, I used cod and they were thick. I think that's the clue to this recipe--buy thinly cut fish, or cut your thick fish lengthwise in half. If it's too thick, the flavor doesn't make its way into the fish. Also, the second time I made it, I forgot to layer the herbs, so all of them were on top! Which means that not much flavor made it to the bottom.

When I made it the first time and it was awesome, I only used one onion, no shallots, and lots more zuccini and yellow squash than called for.

This fish is fairly easy to make and taste pretty good to.  I only used 1 onion and it was plenty of onion.  I also used a whole yellow squash and zucchini, but mine were on the small side.  I did not have any chives so I left those out, but I'm not sure you need them with the onions and shallots.  Thanks for sharing .
