The flavor was pretty good - a few more seasonings in the gravy would be better, but I appreciate the simplicity. I did have an issue with the execution of this recipe. After sauteing the onions and garlic, there is no butter left in the pan to whisk the flour into. You will definitely need to add more. I also think you should take advantage of the pan juices from the pork chops to make the gravy because...hey, more flavor! If I were to make this again, I'd saute the onions, garlic and mushrooms in a pan, then place them in a bowl. I'd then saute the pork chops in the same pan until browned on both sides, then remove to a plate. I'd then scrape up the browned bits in the pan, with a little added fat and the flour to make the roux, add in the broth to make the gravy, then add everything back into the pan and simmer.

I added more black pepper and a dash of white pepper to the flour as I stirred it into the butter and pan juices from the chops. Keep in mind this isn't a recipe found on the "healthiest meals" list so the dingbat commenting on the flour choice needs to get a grip.

I'm very glad I read the reviews before I cooked it. Many were helpful (France C in particular, but I'd reverse her suggested order next time, Pork chops 1st, onions, garlic - & mushrooms- why not saute them? next then the gravy & simmer.) Also, you shouldn't need more that a T of butter for the pork chops, maybe as much as 2T for the veggies (but you can never have too much butter), then when it comes to the gravy, use your judgment, the fat has to match the flour to get a smooth roux. Also the comments on lack of flavor were dead on, but they could not have tasted the gravy before starting the simmer, it was too obvious! It will take a LOT more salt & pepper, and I even added some Worcestershire sauce & beef bullion cubes to my (superb!) homemade chicken stock.

Given these adjustments, I served with rice & green beans. The gravy & rice was the best part of the meal, we all agreed.

This recipe reminds me of the smothered pork chops everyone in my Louisiana family would make, except better!  The sauce is very creamy and thick, the chops were very moist and tasty, and you have room to play around if you want more or less of the onion or garlic.  I did not use the mushrooms because I can't stand them but this didn't need them at all.  It is simple to make and, to save pans, I fried the chops ahead of time, then made the gravy in a skillet later and added the colder chops to it.  1 skillet, no fuss.  Using coarse ground black pepper gave it an extra mild kick.  As mentioned in the recipe, it is best to use thinner chops and keep all of them the same size to ensure even cooking.  Loved it and will make it again and again!

I seared my boneless chops in butter and added some veal demi Glace into the sauce. I also used twice as many shrooms. This is definitely a winner winner, pork dinner.

I love this recipe.  Absolutely delicious and very easy to make.  I didn't have fresh garlic but used freeze dried.  I will use fresh next time.  I will be putting this in my favourites and will be using it again.

Very good and easy. It’s really important to cook the flour mixture until it’s a nice brown - more towards the 10 minutes. That will be the finished color of your gravy. And food even simple food should be appealing to the eye.

I went strictly by the recipe except I added more mushrooms and made more gravy because I made five 1 inch thick pork loin chops. Definitely a 5 star rating for sure

I used sliced pork tenderloin and cooked the pork first.  I had to use more butter and had to add corn starch to thicken the gravy.

Delicious and easy! I used cheap packaged  powdered gravy mix. You could probably squeeze in an extra two pork chops if your pan is big enough. We followed the advice of another review and served it over rice so none of the gravy would go to waste.

We both loved the gravy.
I cooked the gravy separately, and cooked the chops on the grill. The gravy came out amazing, my husband and I both loved it. The only thing I changed was adding a few splashes of Worcestershire Sauce to deepen the flavor. This gravy can be used on mashed potatoes, meatloaf, or any other meat recipe.

Going to try this with other meats, can be done in slow cooker. Mashed potatoes,  veggies or salad. A hearty dinner without turning on oven.

I made this and it turned out great! I made the roux gravy a bit darker and thick and I used 3/4" thick center cut chops and it was perfect.

It was ok.  The gravy was a little bland. My daughter thought the same thing.  My husband liked it. So I guess it depends on your taste.
