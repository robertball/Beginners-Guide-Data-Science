This recipe was so simple, I thought they'd be boring, but they actually have a really nice, delicate flavour. I've made 4-5 batches now, and they've never stayed int he shape of balls though, they spread out quite a bit, so make sure you leave room on the pan for that. I also made one recipe without rolling them in the sugar and they were just as good.

Nice, easy recipe.  Replaced flour with whole wheat flour and brown sugar with Splenda brand brown sugar.  Cookies are a light not too sweet treat.

I made a small batch of these tonight, on a baked goods craving. They turned out great! I rolled them in brown sugar and then cinnamon, instead of white and brown sugar. They were just cooked enough at 10-11 minutes that even when they cooled, they were still nice and soft. It's nice to find a cookie I can easily make w/o an electric mixer!

Very yummy!  I only rolled in white sugar and added a drop of almond extract to the dough. Recipe not well-written and did not make 6 dozen, only about 2 1/2 dozen.

It was only okay for me. Found them simple in flavour and boring. I will add chocolate chips next time.

Good cookies, reminds me of a snickerdoodle. Though definitely does not make 6 dozen! I made 1inch balls and it just made 3 dozen. But flavor wise they are good.

oh, man, these are good! i followed the recipe exactly, aside from using just plain white sugar and cinnamon to roll the dough in before putting it in the oven, and they came out delicious! i was in a pinch for a recipe for a party for tomorrow, and my original baking plan fell through, and these were just the ticket. :) will definitely be making these again. :3 a side note, though-- they didn't make all that many cookies though, but you could easily double the recipe to get more. ;)

Very yummy cookies! I used the coffee icing also found on this website and the two combined made a delicious treat. Not sure if I will have any left to share with the family. :)

Delicious and easy to make, I am definately making these again.  It is also a simple recipe to add your own variation to, such as nuts or spices, I added cinnamon.

This is one of my new favorite recipes! These cookies were so simple to make and I always have the ingredients on hand. Like some other reviewers advised, i also used cinnamon the roll the cookies in. They were dwelicious:)

So easy to make and they are usually gone in seconds.  They dont tend to last in our house. :)

These turned out well but I did not follow directions exactly. I used a medium cookie scoop rather than rolling them into balls and just dipped then in a white sugar brown sugar blend before putting them on the baking sheet. Just seemed a simpler way of doing it but with the same results.

I didn't understand the part about cutting the dough, dipping in sugar, rolling and dipping again. I just rolled the dough into balls, rolled the balls in raw organic sugar, and baked them. They flattened somewhat, but they're so delicious I can't stop eating them, and I NEVER am tempted by cookies.

these turned out to be surprisingly good!
of course, mine did not turn out looking like the default recipe photo uploaded though. 
i think the photo is what scared me off and made me think they wouldn't be any good. lol
anyways, they turned out great and there was no need to alter the recipe to get it right.

Very easy to make and delicious! My 4yo daughter loved rolling them into balls and around the sugars. They turned out great to my surprise since I was out of butter and had to use stick margarine.

Considering how easy these were to make and with so few ingredients, I was delightfully surprised with how these turned out.  I followed the recipe as written and they do in fact hold their ball shape for the most part when baked.  They held up well over several days in a ziploc bag.  They weren't what I'd call sinfully good, but definitely worthy of 4 stars in part due to how easy they are to make and that you're likely to have all the ingredients on hand.

These were great.  I added a cup of chocolate chips and the kids loved them.  They didn't spread and were very chewy. Thanks.
