I have a son who will not eat mashed potatoes, so this was a creamy substitute that everyone could enjoy with meatloaf. To try and please everyone I added a 1/4 cup half and half, which was a good addition.  Used Trader Joe's polenta with a potato masher. It was a quick and easy side dish. Will make again!

Easy, fast, cheap and gluten free-you've got my attention! I used 'from scratch' polenta instead of the prepared type. I enjoyed the addition of paprika and added a bit more than a pinch once I tasted it. I used smoked paprika and it gave such a nice earthy flavour it was hard to stop at just a pinch. This is a wonderful compliment to baked chicken. Thank you keithahaney for sharing this recipe.

Ok so I made this last night for dinner! What a Killer side dish! I put the  cornmeal in the chicken stock, heated the milk till boiling, added the cornmeal mixture, lowered the heat and continually stirred. I added 5oz of cut-up white cheddar and 2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese. I  finished with a small pat of salted butter. I omitted the salt listed in the recipe because this dish was salty enough with the stock, cheeses and butter. This cooked up so quickly. It was so tasty I kept eating it and forgot to take a picture for you guys! hahahahaha??

I've never eaten or made polenta before, so I honestly didn't know what to expect. I was not disappointed by this recipe, I was surprised by how similar it was to mashed potatoes. I think the next time I make this recipe, I'll probably throw in more seasoning to kick up the flavor a notch.

Simple and very good. A nice alternative to typical sides.
