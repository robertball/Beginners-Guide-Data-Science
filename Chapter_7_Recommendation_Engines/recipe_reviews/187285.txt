OMG these were to die for!!!! I followed the actual directions and these were incredible! I can't believe someone only gave this two stars after they switched the entire recipe around. You must try this, but please follow the written instructions. My entire family loved this one and have dubbed this one of their "allrecipes.com" favorites. The only change that I recommend is to bake for 20 minutes after removing the foil, more if you want your potatoes softer. Twenty minutes uncovered after the initial baking period is perfect for scalloped consistency. I use minced garlic from a jar these days instead of dicing each time, and I used one level tablespoon. This was fabulous and easy to prepare. It doesn't get much better than this! I was concerned a bit about being too salty after sampling the spoon pre-dishwasher, but it worked out well in the end. Please do not judge this based on reviews that were written based upon alterations of this recipe. Make it as written, add at least ten more minutes of browning time at the end and you will be delighted! Thank you so very  much for this wonderful addition to my "must make again" recipe files. Perfection!!!! Cream of broccoli and cream of celery-SIMPLE. Don't sub with variations including cheese, or low sodium, etc. Make this as written and you won't be disappointed.

I followed the recipe exactly except subsituting cream of mushroom for cream of broccoli.  I did what other reviews said - take foil off and bake for another 10-20 minutes.  This was AMAZING.  I'll probably never buy boxed scalloped potatoes again.  Actually, I know I won't.  Sooooo good.

My dad requested boxed scalloped potatoes for a birthday dinner and made this instead.  They were a huge hit!  All I had to use was 1 can cream of celery and 1 can cream of mushroom.      I think it took longer than 10 minutes to let all the juices settle, mine came out a bit soupy.

Glad everyone is enjoying this recipe.  FYI - you can make this with any kind of cream soup.  Sometimes I use cream of chicken and cream of mushroom.  I have also used jalapeno cheese for a change.  And yes you do have to cook this for a while, sometimes as much as 45 min longer depending on the stove.

cooking time = how thick you cut your potatos!!! I cut mine by hand so i know some peices will be a bit thicker. SO - to be safe i cook mine 1Hr & 40Min.   It will not hurt this dish to cook that long. I PROMISE! Not only that, who wants to eat hard potatos??

Needed to cook at least 20 min. longer to brown on the top.  Very tasty though!

Not the best nor worst scalloped potato recipe here.  Used low sodium cream of celery and broccoli cheddar soups. Might exchange cream of mushroom with the cream of celery if I make it again.  Switched oven to broil for 5 or so minutes when done to brown the cheese; and let it "settle" for at least 10 min. or so after baking, to solidify.

Outstanding! The BEST scalloped potatoes I have ever made. During the last 30 minutes I put some pork chops on top of the potatoes. I turned them after 15 minutes at which time I also laid some broccoli spears on top of them. It was a delicious meal with super easy cleanup.

These scalloped potatoes were quite delish!! I did however, modify the recipe somewhat. I used 8 cups of extremely thin sliced red potatoes, 1-medium yellow onion diced, and 1 medium red onion diced, 3 large cloves of garlic minced, 1/2 cup of 2% milk, 1/2 cup of half-n-half cream, added 1/2 teaspoon of salt, plus 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Only needed to saute' the onions for 3 minutes, then saute'd the garlic for just 1 minute. By mistake I only used 2 cups of the shredded sharp cheddar cheese, which my husband and I thought that was plenty of cheese. I also mixed together, the sliced potatoes and the soup/cheese combination, before adding it to the buttered pan. I like how that help to coat the potatoes nicely. Baked the taters for 1 hour and 25 minutes, and after removing the foil, I continued to bake the potatoes for another 10 minutes. Then let the taters set ontop the stove for 15 minutes, so they'd absorb the sauce in the pan, and sprinkled the top with some dried parsley before serving. I also wanted to add... the next time I do make these potatoes, I'll most likely substitute the cream of broccoli soup for another creamed soup. It's just a preference on my part. What a nice side dish to serve with our Sunday dinner. Thank you metzstar for sharing your recipe!!

This was good, nothing special though.  I followed reciped (except instead of cream of broccoli I used cream of chicken).  I even tried to add additional seasoning, but these potatoes came out bland in my opinion.  Added chicken sausage to the mixture as well, which helped flavor the dish a little bit.

I cooked this in my crockpot.  The flavor was great, but the butter separated in the pot which made for a messy presentation.  Nonetheless, there wasn't a bit leftover.  It tasted great!

These were pretty good.  Very rich!  Definitely needed about 20 minutes extra cooking time.  Tasted similar to a broccoli cheese soup with potatoes.  Not a bad thing but maybe a bit too rich for our tastes.  :)

I needed a change of pace from my regular scalloped potatoes and this recipe worked. I used the two soups listed and thought they worked nicely. It is a creamy, delicious recipe and I've got a small spiral ham to enjoy it with.

My husband loved it! Had several older red potatoes leftover from our garden and used them all in this recipe. One whole large sweet onion and several cloves of garlic. Almost used broccoli & cheese, as I didn't think I had enough cheddar cheese, but glad I didn't. The cream of broccoli & celery were great. I bet it would be wonderful with cream of mushroom, too! Nearly filled my Dutch oven! I cooked as stated, as the potatoes were cut thin, but still hadn't browned, so turned oven to broil & browned the top nicely in a few minutes!!

This dish sounds delicious, however I would not call it Scalloped Potatoes! As this recipe calls for Cheddar cheese I would call it Potatoes Au Gratin. Scalloped does not call for any cheese and with butter and milk shouldn't need any. I like with or without cheese. I just think it's confusing.

Very good. Made 5 lb bag of reds and none were left! Next time I'll use yukon golds, Or russets..because the reds were too sweet. Canned sliced potatoes, drained, would work too. I used one bag (2 cups) sharp cheddar (mixed half with liquids, other half put on top at the end)..3 cans soup total w/a little over a can of milk, and rather than buttering pan i used spray. Also mixed potatoes with liquids then poured 
in dish. Cooked for almost two hours.  
 It baked almost 2 hrs, then cooled 15 mins to absorb the sauce in the pan.

It doesn't burst with flavor, but it is a very tasty side dish that i will make again.  next time i'll just shred the potatoes into the baking dish and stop when it is almost full.  8 large reds is too much for one pan. I will also stir the sauce into the potatoes next time.  the recipe doesn't state so, but it is a very necessary step.  The sauce is quick and easy. I'll use more garlic next time, and a Sharp cheddar to enhance the flavor more. Overall this dish was a big hit and served as a wonderful side with a steak dinner.

I have just tried this recipe, and presently finishing it off in the microwave, so we can eat dinner before bed! I sliced the potatoes thinly and followed the recipe exactly, however the potatoes are still too hard for my taste after almost an hour and 10 minutes in the oven. I am thinking that red potatoes are not the best choice for making scalloped potatoes. And 45 minutes, definitely not long enough to cook them. So I may use the ingredients again, but use a different potato. In the meantime we are hungry, waiting for these darn things to soften up. I am glad I did not have company, it is just my husband and I.

Fantastic recipe.  I substituted a few things only because I was out of potatoes and my milk was spoiled (ugh).  I used shredded hasbhrowns for the potatoes and fat free ranch dressing for the milk and this still turned out great.  Thanks for sharing!

Did not use the red potatoes because russett was what I had. I used garlic powder too and followed everything else has is. Well, actually my daughter-in-law put it together for me while I was at Church. That made it taste even better... Thank You for the good recipe and I will make this again.

This was almost too creamy. It did thicken nicely, but I had to put it back in the oven because the potatoes were still too crunchy. The flavors were good together though, and it was super easy.

This was okay. I would definitely cut the amount of cheese next time by half, and would mix the sauce and the potatoes together instead of just pouring it on the top.

My family loves these scalloped potatoes!  I like to add chopped green onions to the top of the potatoes the last minute or so of cooking.  I think these potatoes would be awesome with chopped cooked bacon or ham mixed in.  This is a keep recipe!

Turned out great. We all loved it. We wI'll be making more often.  Vary simple. Depending on your oven sometime you need to cook a little longer till potatoes are tender. If you cook is a day ahead and reheat it is even better, it thickens up and flavor soak in. Thank You

I love this recipe, and best of all, my husband loves it too! I make a few changes when I make it. Instead of cream of broccoli soup, I use cream of mushroom. I also add a small can of mushrooms to the onions to saute. What really gives mine some flavor is cooking up a whole pound of bacon, and crumbling it over top of the potatoes with the cheese! I make this often, and it tastes just as good for leftovers too!

Loved this recipe after I increased the eggs to 8 and kept the milk at 2C and had to add about 15 more minutes to the baking - I always add more garlic to everything so that goes without saying!

All of the stellar reviews for this weren't exaggerating!  It was fantastic, according to both the wife and me!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of not buttering the dish first, but only because I forgot before layering in the potatoes.  As it turns out, there was no need!  Oh yes, I did use everyone else's "adapted directions" and extended the uncovered baking time to 20 or 25 minutes.  So perfect!  Also, it's just the two of us, so I actually split the recipe into two smaller pyrex dishes and put one in the freezer (pre-baking).  We'll see how that one turns out another day.
UPDATE- the frozen pan may have been a tiny step down from the original, but worked like a charm and was still delicious!!!

We love this recipe! Only thing i would change is the length of time it cooks. I found the first time I made it it almost needed another 30-60mins to bake completely. Some parts were crunchy. So other then lengthening the cooking time I wouldnt change a single thing. We love his recipe with ham. Its an awesome comfort food especially when its cold outside.

this turned out fantastic! so delicious! my husband loved it! i had to alter a little to what i had in the kitchen-i used 9 small red potatoes, 1/2 of a big onion sauteed in butter/water mixure,garlic powder, a can of cream of chicken soup, 1 cup milk, 2 cups cheese(a mixure of mild cheddar + monterey jack). i put in a buttered 8 x 8 glass dish and put another cup and a half or so of cheese on top.  did have to cook about 22 minutes without the foil for the top to brown.

This was great and i will use a base for scalloped potato going forward , i used cream of mushroom since i already had some  and i halved the recipe so only 1 can and a handful of cheese  , I used Mexican cheese blend , again using what i already had on hand
I used my mandolin to slice 1/4 inch 
Baked 1 hour  with foil and taters were pretty done , baked without foil for 20 and broiled for 5-10 (gotta watch a broil no matter  what ) 
When it comes to potato’s i agree that these can’t really be over cooked and you can’t rush them either.  i always start potatoes 2 hours before they would need to be served. 
I served this with my corned beef for st Patrick’s day i know that’s not the norm but all my potatoes didn’t fit in my crock pot lol

Reading the other's comments it appears that I'm one of the few that followed the recipe word for word. These turned out very creamy and good but next time I'll follow other's route and substitute something else for the cream of broccoli. The broccoli taste was sort of overwhelming. Maybe cream of chicken and cream of potato.

And yes, 1.5 hours minimum cook time as others suggest.

I actually sautéed the potatoes with the onion and garlic then added the other ingredients and cooked for about 20 minutes in the stovetop because my oven was "taken."  I cooked for 20-30 minutes in the oven. The only substitution I made was only 1 jar of cream of mushroom soup. I added some fresh rosemary and chives from the garden just because.

So delicious! I'm giving it five stars for taste and how easy it is to make. I did use one cup of half & half instead of milk just because I thought it sounded extra good. And to make it more of a main dish I also cut up a store bought rotisserie chicken and layered it between the potatoes. This is an "even better the next day" dish.

I made these exactly as written and they were delicious.  They did take about 1 1/2 hours to cook and I sliced them thin and divided into 2 containers, one of which I froze.  Hoping that they hold up to the freezing.  Next time I'll cut back on the butter some because with so much cheese it creates too much oil which separates out. I agree with another poster that these are Au Gratin potatoes, not scalloped.  Scalloped potatoes don't have cheese.

I believe the addition of cheese would make this au gratin as opposed to scalloped.

I made this side for Thanksgiving dinner and my family loved it! I would recommend cooking dish longer so potatoes can be more tender.

I was hesitant to cook this recipe because I'm not a huge fan of can soup, they always seem to have a funny tin taste and smell. After reading a few reviews I decided ignore my cooking instincts and stick to the recipe. With almost all the ingredients simmering in the saucepan I could still smell and taste the can flavor but like magic I finally put the cheese in and it all went away. This was a great dish everyone enjoyed. I can imagine that changing the can soup flavor wouldn't alternate the flavor to much since you cant really taste the celery or broccoli in the final product.

I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of broccoli and russet potatoes instead only because I had neither on hand.  This recipe was pretty good, but a little too salty since the soups already have salt in them. I just wasn't too impressed.  I think I've tried a scalloped potatoes recipe that didn't have the soups in it and I prefer it that way.

It was good but the cream of broccoli soup over-powered the dish. I couldn't taste anything else really.

I made this with what I had on hand - so I used cream of potato instead of cream of broccoli and yukon gold potatoes instead of the red potatoes but with that said this was absolutely delicious and I don't think that the substitutions I made really would have effected the end result.  Got better overnight with the reheats.

This was awesome and easy.  I used russets instead of red potatoes because that's what I had on hand.  Didn't have broccoli soup so I took another reviewers advance and added 1/2 c. of milk.  Added some smoked gouda on the top.  Cooked it 45 mins longer than suggested.  Great.  Definately will be making this again.

Ok, this might replace our Thanksgiving mashed potatoes, we loved them that much. Made them without the onions and may try to replace it with something else, but the sauce is cheesy and delicious, and the whole dish comes out luxurious.  Definitely needed the extra 20-30 minutes that everyone else suggested.

I had never made scalloped potatoes before- these were great!  I only had ONE can of cream of mushroom... so I added a bit of half & half and a half cup of sour cream... doubled the garlic (I LOVE garlic), halved the cheddar and added a bit of vegan parmesan (normal parm has rennet or lipase.. I'm vegetarian not vegan) Added a few seasonings, parsley and stuff to try and compensate for the lack of soup.. but it had plenty of flavor!!!  I'm pretty picky and I loved them, it is hard to ruin so just play around with what you have!  I would definitely add sour cream to this though, even if I had 2 cans of soup.  Baked for 1 hr 15, then 15 uncovered.

Not sure if I went wrong somewhere, but I didn't care for them.  I had to put it in for longer, too, as the potatoes were a bit hard, still - and the sauce was runny.  My mom liked them a lot, though :)

slice the potatoes , then cut them in half. If not sliced , then cut in smaller chunks or cook them for like hour or an hour and 15 min ., instead of 45 min.

Yum, Yum, Yum. I agree with other reviewers you need to bake it longer to get the potatoes softer. I also added gruyere and fontina cheeses and a bit of half and half . This was awesome. I would make my scalloped potatoes anyday compared to that box stuff :-)

Loved this! Except when I made it I used a lot more potatoes (my red ones were smaller) and I would recommend maybe use less cheese. A pound of cheese is a LOT of cheese. But I will definitely make again. :)

I would probably be rating this a 5 but I have yet got to taste it! I have done everything to the "T" and am having to cook it now an extra hour and am hoping it will finally be done. The potatoes are taking forever to cook!

these are great. I did do the Cream of Mushroom intsead. I will tell you if you like your taters softer go AT LEAST 35-45 minutes longer. I plated some and tried them. I ended dumping them back in my glass dish(gross whatever, pretty sure the 350 killed all of my germs) covered them and cooked 35 minutes longer. MUCH more to my liking. STILL 5 stars.

Absolutely the best scalloped potatoes in all of recorded history!  I followed the recommendations of several other members and baked them for about 15 extra minutes with the tinfoil off and the result was spectacular.

If you are looking for something that is very creamy and cheesy, this would get 5 stars. It was too creamy and cheesy for me. The seasoning got lost in the cheesiness. I used homemade cream soup, added paprika, and garnished with green onion. It took longer than the suggested 45 minutes to bake.

Just made this with russet potatoes, cream of celery and cream of mushroom. So good! Baked it for 65 minutes at 350 and potatoes were so hard. Cooked at 375 for an additional 45 minutes and potatoes were done.

Good base recipe for a rich and creamy potato! I added chilli flakes and thyme to the sauce to add an extra kick and mixed mushrooms and smoked ham into the potato to make it a full meal. I found it took double the suggested time to cook but that may be because of the extra volume added by the other ingredients.

I really loved this recipe for the simplicity & flavour! I subbed Cream of Mush soup instead of Broccoli (my husband HATES broccoli LOL) and I added 1 extra chopped garlic when cooking the onion.

Will definitely make again!!

I checked the sauce flavour before I added the cheese, and I am going to try that next time as that tasted really good on its own (with the onion & garlic).

I love this..I have made this numerous times with different soups but the original version is my favorite. The only thing different that I do is mix the soup mixture with the potatoes before it goes into the pan so everything is coated with yumminess and I cook them about a half hour more but that all depends on the thickness of your potatoes.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made these for Christmas dinner and they were a huge hit. I followed the advice of some of the reviews but really didn't change much. I did mix the potatoes with the soup mixture before pouring it in the baking dish and only because i didn't have any I did not use garlic and I cooked them longer than 45 minutes. I had them in the oven for nearly twice that time. You really just need to watch them and make sure the potatoes are soft then let the top brown a little.  Thank you for the recipe. My family liked them so much that I have another batch in the oven today.

Made it just like the recipe. It was awesome and everyone loved them. I’m not a big scalloped potatoes fan but I even liked them.

This was a HUGE hit at my family’s Easter Dinner. As many others have remarked, it did take considerably longer to bake than the instructions indicated. No worries, though...I just baked it longer! So good!

I used only cream of celery soup.  I just didn't feel adventurous enough to  add cream of broccoli.  We loved the recipe!  I served it to my family on Christmas day.

I made this a couple weeks ago for a family birthday dinner.  It was great and I would have given it 5 stars but of course I added ingredients.  I did not use red potatoes, but used Idaho.  I added more spices (this is not an insult, I add more spice to everything I make) and on top of the Cheddar cheese I added pepper jack.  It turned out wonderful!

Just what I was looking for.  I used cream of mushroom instead of broccoli.   I will try cream of chicken too.  My husband loved them and he is pretty picky about anything other than mashed potatoes.

Made this for my family of 8, and everyone lost their mind because it was that good!!!  They tore it up not, a single bit left , no left overs and I made a lot!!!  Even my mother in law, who is having difficulty eating due to recent dental issues could not stop eating it!!!  I served it with a pan seared to oven rib eye steak and fresh asparagus!  Followed the recipe exactly and the potatoes came out incredible!  Never ever ever will I buy these potatoes from the box again!  My family is literally begging me to make them once more!!!  Might even be tonight....

Everyone really enjoyed it.  I did use the red potatoes and let them cook longer, as some  people said and I didn't use all of the shredded cheese as I used cream of broccoli soup with cheese.  I would definitely make it again.

I love this recipe - so simple and delicious!  I vary it with what cheese I have on hand and whatever kind of potatoes - like russets are fine too.  I like the cream of mushroom soup flavor the best.

I halved the recipe so I used only one can of soup (cream of celery). Also, I didn't bother peeling the potatoes. Turned out great. We finished them up the second day and my boyfriend made a point of telling me to be sure to save the recipe.

Wow these were good!! I didn't have cream of broccoli soup so I used cream of chicken. Still turned out great and my family LOVED them. Lots of cheese in it though. I might cut out some of the cheese next time so it's healthier. Will definitely make these again soon.

My family loved these potatoes.  I used Yukon gold potatoes, yellow onions and celery and broccoli soup.  Took the lid off at the end to brown a little. I didn't use cheese.

These were amazing. I had never made scallop potatoes before but I always remember them best when cheesy. Recipe is great but agree - cook for 20 mins uncovered then let for 7ish minutes to stiffen up. Loved it!! My 6-year old ate 2 helpings!

This is a winner!  I used mostly cream with a little 2% milk, since I had some cream on hand.  I used cream of celery and cream of mushroom, and cut the potatoes a little thicker.  I planned to cook it a little longer, but it still wasn't long enough.  Next time I will cook for 2 hrs (at least) and let it set out for 20 min. They ended up cooking for about 2 hrs. and actually I put them in the micro for about 10 min, then we had to serve them right away.  The potatoes still had some texture, which I think my husband preferred, because he didn't want me to cook them anymore after I had served some.  These are so good! I will be making them again with the time adjustments.

i made this last night and eventually gave up on it. it took forrevverr to cook and after i had it in the oven for almost an hour and a half and still wasnt done, i was done with it. im not sure if it was my oven or if i had too many potatoes in it but i planned the rest of my meal around it and by the time i got everything done, it was still not ready. i will most likey try this again another time as it tasted really good when i tried it to make sure it was done. i followed the recipe as written and took the advice of others and removed the foil and baked for 15 minutes to brown but it was just not cooking through. tasty though.

I changed out the soup for cream of broccoli and cheddar. It took longer to cook than indicated for sure. Almost 1.5 hours total. Overall it was good. I added jalapeño havarti cheese that added a bit of a kick. The family loved it!

This is a great recipe. Tastes like something my grandma would make. Using the cream of mushroom and broccoli makes it so simple to do. I tend to like it extra creamy, so I use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. I also use one large can of cream of mushroom and one small can of cream of broccoli. I also use russet potatoes. I have made this about 10-15 times and every time people love it and its great for leftovers.  Great for holidays parties, friends over - even in the summer as a nice side dish.

Very easy to prepare!!  I did go with Low Fat cream soups & cheese to save calories, which didn't sacrifice taste. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this for the first time a couple years ago when I had to bring Potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner with the extended family. INSTANT hit! I got so many compliments on this dish. I've had to make it for every family gathering since then. Definitely a keeper! Thank you for the great recipe!

Hi have to say, my husband and I were not impressed with this dish...  The recipe had quite a bit of sauce (we like sauce) just kinda tasted like it came from a can...and the cook time needed an additional 10-15 min, our potatoes were under cooked in the middle and still had the starchy texture.

This recipe was ok but not one I'll try again.  Did follow the recipe other than just halving it since there are only two of us.  Also, cooked potatoes an additional 20 minutes per other reviewers' suggestions (actually should have added at least 30-45 additional minutes as potatoes were slightly undercooked even with the additional time).  Way too rich for our tastes.  Thanks for posting though - love trying new recipes.

Okay, so I didn't follow the recipe precisely. I used red potatoes plus Yukon gold (what I had). More importantly, I subed the condensed cream soups with chicken noodle (also what I had). I used powdered milk as well. (We're not milk drinkers)

It came out great! Maybe a little less creamy than otherwise due to the substitution, but both hubby and I loved it. For those whose potatoes didn't get cooked...I don't know what to say. But you can't blame the recipe for your bad potatoes! Next time I will make a run to the store for the cream soups. But in the meantime, thanks for the great recipe! It's obviously very forgiving...

Oh, yeah. Re the cooking time: I did brown the top for an extra 10 minutes.

Good flavor but those soups have a high sodium content.   Also, I cut the slices fairly thin and it still took about 20 min longer than stated (about 1 1/2 hrs, including browning time)

This was a winner!  Differences: cream of mushroom instead of celery, because my store only had 97%fat free cream of celery and that was not going to cut it. One of the reviews suggested cream of mushroom, and so I did that instead.  Used a cuisinart with the thinnest cut for the potatoes. Used 4 large russet and 4 small red potatoes. Next time I will peel the skins off, taters turned grey during cooking. Didn't taste any different, but it looked funny. Used 1 package of shredded cheddar and 1 package of shredded Italian cheese blend, wanted a deeper cheese flavor. Used a ton of garlic, prediced.  Who doesn't love garlic. Also used heavy cream, why not, it's the holidays. Anyway, first time I had ever made scalloped potatoes and people were already asking for the recipe.  Will keep this in my repertoire. Thanks!

Made it following the recipe with the exception of using 4 large russet potatoes. Delicious!   Cooked it for 2 hours since our guests arrived late, but it was still good. next time though, I think i will hold off on adding the cheddar on top, it ended up creating pools of grease i had to sop up with paper towels. I will also skip the additional salt, as it was pretty salty. I microwaved some for breakfast and their still pretty tasty!

This is a great recipe but if you are using propaine to bake with you need to increase the baking temp to 360 degrees and the bake time to an hour and fifteen min. I also added some turkey polska kielbasa.

We did a smaller batch, just used one can of soup and about 3/4 cup milk...making the sauce on the stovetop is what makes this recipe so special! Cooking the potatoes in the rich creamy sauce for the full hour gave the perfect texture! Excellent comfort food! On the top of our list!!!

This recipe is great! My daughter who hates boxed scalloped potatoes absolutely loved these. My husband who always says everything is okay, said they were very good. The only thing I did different was use cheddar broccoli soup instead of cream of broccoli.

This was sooo good! 
I changed the recipe a little, due to time constraints and availability of ingredients. 
Added diced Bell pepper, and used only 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, baked in a 9x9 glass dish. 
I also gave the potatoes a head start by steaming them in the microwave for about 4 minutes prior to placing them in the casserole dish. 
Total cook time was about 35 minutes. These were so easy and delicious, would definitely make again!!

I just made these potatoes.  I did tweak the recipe a little.  I used Cheddar cheese, not American - I don't know if I can get shredded American cheese around here.  I used minced garlic, not garlic powder (and a much smaller amount).  And I added the bacon to the top with the parmesan cheese.  They tasted a little too greasy, almost like there was too much butter in with them (NO butter was used).  I greased the pan with shortening, now that could have caused my problem (maybe I should have used a spray shortening).  Did anyone else have this problem?  Does anyone have a suggestion has to what caused this?  Any suggestion how I can switch it up to have this not happen the next time.  We really liked the tasted and they were easy to make.  Could it have been the Cheddar cheese?   I would like to be able to make these to take them to dinners and pot-luck parties.  Thanks.

I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom and or cream of chicken, both tasted great. Plus both times I used motzerella instead of cheddar also added parsley on top to pretty it up. :)

I made this exactly as it was written and I will be removing it from my recipe box.  The potatoes were cruncy after 45 minutes, so I bumped up the temp to 400 and cooked  an additional 30 minutes. They were still hard.

In order to get a consistent thickness, you really need a mandolin slicer.  With the thinnest I could reasonably slice them without one it took closer to 75-90min to cook.  More time to cook potatoes but not so long that they get soggy.  Also, try cream of chicken soup instead of broccoli or celery.  Great flavor!

the potatoes were hard after cooking for one hour at the listed temp.  Not edible.  Nice flavor and had the potatoes not been hard it would have been good.  Not likely to make again.

Followed the ingredients for this recipe exactly and the scalloped potatoes turned out great. My family raved over them. I added bacon to the top when it was time to melt the cheese. Potatoes needed 90 minutes to cook properly though.

After trying several recipes on here, this one is my favorite.  My husband said it was "dangerously good".  I went back for seconds, which I don't normally do myself, AND my toddler ate it, which is a miracle these days.  I did add probably two cups of diced ham to it, which made it a meal.  I would say that I probably didn't need to add any additional salt because of all the salt in the soups.  That is the only thing I might change next time.  This one is a keeper.  This meal is one of my husband's favorites and he said this is "the one".

Very tasty. Russets instead, and creamy cheddar cheese soup and cream of celery.  I used up a mish mash of cheeses I had around (cheddar, parmesan, mozzarella).  I baked a little longer (10 mins) to ensure the potatoes were softened fully.

Yummy!  Used cream of celery and cream of mushroom (it's what I had on hand).  Very easy to make and was a huge hit with my family.

This is a great recipe for scalloped potatoes. I did follow some of the other directions to leave it in the oven longer.  I also used cream of cheddar soup along with cream of chicken soup.  Turned out fantastic!!! I will be making this recipe again!

This was very good and easy.  I skipped the last 2 cups of cheese on top, it did not need it.  I used cream of celery and cream of chicken.  Very good, I was surprised how it did have a similar taste to those boxed potato mixes but better!

This is a great dish, but you must cook it longer.  Or cook your potatoes before you bake it.  Otherwise the potatoes are not cooked.

Really really good.  I've made scalloped potatoes for years and this simplified the process without sacrificing any flavor whatsoever.

I used a can of cream of onion and one can of cheddar cheese sauce, left out the onions as we don't like onions but enjoy the onion flavor. Our household likes potatoes with the skin, so I left it on. I also added a half a soup can of milk to the soup and heated it up on the stove before pouring it over the potatoes. The full cup seemed to be too much and made it a bit on the runny side.

took about twice as long to cook as the recipe said, and I cut the potatoes as thinly as I could by hand, but very very good

This didn't really do it for my family.  I cooked it exactly as the original recipe stated and it was VERY fatty and greasy.  The potatoes tasted very nice, but I was turned off by the layer of grease on the top.
