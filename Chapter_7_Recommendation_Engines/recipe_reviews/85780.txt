This is fantastic!!  I added fresh garlic and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It is SO much like the balsamic chicken that I buy at my local Italian specialty shop.  I am so glad that I tried this recipe.

this recipe gets 5 stars for being super easy and super tasty.   everything was in the house already.  i marinated for ten minutes per side and next time will do overnight for even more intensity of this delicious taste.  i used 2t italian herbs, 1/2 each of oregano, basil, thyme and parsley.  i used 2T splenda instead of sugar, and 6 cloves of garlic instead of just 1.  1?!  come on.  next time i will increase the marinade and serve as sauce on angel hair pasta, which i imagine would be divine.  italian hubby loved this bird, thank you.  very yums.

Definatly one of my favorite dishes EVER.  I've made it a few times, using both fresh and frozen chicken, and it turned out amazingly flavorful.  I cook the chicken a good deal longer than the recipe suggests, boiling down the marinade a bit and pouring it over rice.  It's great.

This turned out a little sweet, next time I will follow other's suggestion and cut the sugar in half.  Other than that, I thought it was teriffic.  I did cut the breasts in half and marinated for 4 hours to get some additional flavor.  This gets 5 stars for being so simple and still being quite tasty.

This recipe was easy and very tasty.  I used olive oil instead of Enova and I used fresh garlic.  Even my 2 year old loved it!  The marinade is awesome; it would probably be really good poured over a side dish of angel hair pasta.

Great recipe, very easy to prepare. I cut the chicken into strips and marinated them for a few hours prior to cooking for added flavor.

Excellent! My husband devoured this and decided it was a restaurant quality meal.
I changed the servings to fit 2 people - love that option on this site, but made more sauce as it was cooking - we like lots of sauce.
Will be makinkg this again and again - husband already asked me when we can have it again.

This was a great dish! I wouldn't go as far as to say that it's one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had or that it's restaurant quality, but it was really good, and incredibly easy! I will definitely make this again. I used olive oil and I also used Splenda instead of sugar and increased the Italian seasoning to about 2 tsp.

All I have to say is WOW! I didn't change a thing except to throw in a little sage and parsley with the other seasonings and to cut back on the oil to 1 Tbsp. It comes out a rich brown and the taste is incredible.

My husband enjoyed this dish, but I wasn't as impressed.  I used 2 1/2 teaspoons of minced garlic and marinated it for approximately four hours, and found it still kind of bland.  Maybe I did something wrong?  I may try it again...

Amazing!  Sliced the chicken before marinating.  Flavourful and moist.  Even my fussy daughter wants it again.

I love balsamic vinegar so I found this delicious.  The only thing I changed was I used beef broth because I was out of chicken broth but it still came out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

this was very easy to make.  it smelled so delicious but i was somewhat disappointed with the taste, it seemed sort of bland.  maybe marinating it longer would help and adding more garlic.  my kids loved it so i will definitely be making it again with a couple revisions.

Not the best, but good enough to make again. I doubled the sauce, and the herbs, and added like 4 dashes of salt, haha.. Kind of sweet though, so instead of 4 TBS of sugar (4 because of the doubled sauce), Next time I might just but 3..?

This was the most moist chicken I have ever made, however, I must agree with many of the other viewers that the flavor was not the best and it was a bit bland.  I think with all of those Italian herbs and the onions it tasted like spaghetti/ marinara sauce, but without the richness of the added tomatoes and sauce, so it was just really lacking.  I even added some wine and shallots into the marinade which is something that halfway salvaged it.

We used chicken tender strips and put them on a salad with a balsamic vinegar/olive oil dressing and little goat cheese.  We marinated the chicken for several hours so it really had a nice flavor.

I wasn't very impressed by this recipe.  I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours, but it still wasn't very flavorful.  My husband loved it, but then again, he smothered his in bbq sauce.  I love Balsamic vinegar, so maybe the recipe just needs some tweaking.
