My husband grew up eating Sweet Potato Casserole and when we got married he asked for it at Thanksgiving and I have never heard of it. So, I went looking and I found and tried several recipes and this recipe was the one that our family loved.

I found this casserole extremely sweet.  I doubled the recipe like it was suggested and hardly any was eaten at all.  I would cut the sugar in half and skip the sweetened condensed milk altogether if I was to make it again although I probably wouldn't make it again.

This recipe is  so good with this topping.  I make mine with 1/2 t. vanilla and 1/2t. cinnamon.  I skip the condensed milk- just use regular milk.  Good sweet potatoes don't need that much sweetening. Use part brown sugar and part white sugar to gain the sweetness you like.  The topping is different and that is what makes the casserole.  I probably add more brown sugar on top with the cruch corn flakes and melted butter and pecans.

I made this last year for my first thanksgiving. This year everyone has demanded it again! I did not mash the potatoes however. I cubed them and left out the egg. I also added the topping right from the beginning and baked a little longer til the topping was well browned. Even all the kids loved it! Thankyou for a new Thanksgiving tradition!

I have used this recipe now 4 times in the last year. It's fantastic and you can still taste the sweet potatoes. Everyone loves the crunchy topping. I use ANY type of flake cereal.

The 2nd ingredient is 2 eggs...I just assume they are added with first 4 ingredients but the eggs are not listed in step 2.....I substituted rice chex cereal for the cornflakes, omitted the pecans and added little marshmallows at the end - It was a hit!!!!

This was a very easy recipe to make.  Something that even a beginner cook could do well.  I used 2 lbs of sweet potatoes, per the directions and found that I had too much mash.  Next time I'll use 1 1/2 lbs.  I also reduced the sugar to a cup...the mixture was already sweet enough.  As for the corn flake topping, I liked it, but I'm not sure I like it on sweet potatoes.

My husband isn't a big fan of sweet potatoes and will only eat it from Ruth Chris' restaurant. So when I saw this recipe I decided to try it because it seems very similar to the one at the restaurant.  My husband was extremely pleased.  It is very sweet but it comes out great. My grandmother suggested I boil the sweet potatoes first which cooked them and allowed the skin to peel off really easy.  Then I sliced them up into the mixer, no mashing required.

My mother ask me to make this for Thanksgiving dinner. I had never made it nor eaten it, so I got on here and found this recipe. It was a big hit! I never even tried it because I thought it would be terribly sweet, but now I am going to have to make it again just so I can eat some, because as I said it was a huge success.

I made this for Thanksgiving. Very easy to make. Huge crowd pleaser. Two people even asked for the recipe. I omitted the nuts due to allergies and used Special K instead of corn flakes. (I actually thought Special K was cornflakes until my daughter pointed out that they it's rice...lol). It still turned out great. This is a keeper.

Only 3 stars bc it is really too sweet as written. But the topping is so delicious I'm keeping this recipe in my favorites box. When I make again I will use about a half cup less sugar and 2% milk instead of sweetened condensed. Also added a tablespoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of nutmeg for spice.

My suggestion would be to serve this at any meal other than thanksgiving. I was majorly let down when this showed up instead of the traditional sweet potato casserole. It wasn't bad, but it didn't compare.

My family went crazy over this!!!  The only problem that we have is the calories for a serving! When ever we have sweet potato it has to  be  made this way  LOVE IT
