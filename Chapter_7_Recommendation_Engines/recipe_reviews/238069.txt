Wow, wow, wow! This reminds me of the strawberries and cream frap my daughter sometimes orders at the coffee shop, only creamier and more smooth. This tasted more like a delicious treat than a fruit smoothie! I followed the recipe as written but used some organic mango chunks I had in the freezer. Since there is no ice in this recipe, it may be helpful to use some frozen fruit. I will be making this again and again!

Nice, sweet, and light. I did find that the peach yogurt  kinda overpowered it a bit. Still very refreshing though.
