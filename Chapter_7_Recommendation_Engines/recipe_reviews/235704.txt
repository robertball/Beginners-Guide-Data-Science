This was "Autumn" in a bowl. The white wine added the unique flavor tying the whole dish together. With that said, I didn't care for the nutmeg in it having tried it both ways. I did add a spiral of sour cream that was wonderful and enhancing. I also toasted the butternut seeds and added a touch of them on top of the bacon.

This recipe is fabulous!  We have finally found a great butternut squash recipe. We followed the recipe as written except that we used an immersion blender and added a dash of cinnamon at the end. Unless we missed it the recipe did not mention when to add the garlic, we did after the onion was translucent. 15 minutes of prep is a little misleading; it took my husband and I at least 30 minutes (but we are not master chefs).  Thanks for the recipe Donald.

Delicious! I used milk instead of half and half.  Other than that I followed the recipe and everyone loved it!

This was great! I used maple bacon, tossed squash in maple sugar and smoky sea salt before roasting. I cooked the bacon in the Dutch oven to save on another pan to wash and poured off all but about a tablespoon of the bacon fat. Immersion blender when done and a combo of heavy cream, half&half and water to use up a bunch of leftovers.

So good. I will definitely make it again. In only had turkey bacon so I used that instead. As a result, it required 1 tsp of olive oil to brown properly.

I didn't have any wine, so I omitted it and added a tablespoon each of butter and balsamic vinegar to compensate. I also only had heavy whipping cream on hand, so I mixed 3/4 c of heavy whipping cream with 3/4 c of water and added it to the soup at the end. 

I also used an immersion stick blender instead of a standard blender, it was silky smooth and way less messy. 

My husband isn't a fan of nutmeg so I served it with a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper and the turkey bacon. We LOVED it and will definitely make it again.

Next time, I may add in a tart apple just for funsies because I think it could use the tartness (although the wine I didn't have may have added that acid).

I will and i did.
Didn't add the wine, added more heavy cream and used a little milk, extra butter and cinnamon. I didn't use the blender, i used a mixer instead.

The concept of the soup was fantastic but I did have to make a couple of tweaks. One no nutmeg instead I use cinnamon like everyone else suggested. two I didn't use the bacon. ultimately  taste better without the bacon because it's too salty for something that comes out decently sweet. Also I roasted the sweet potatoes after tossing it in brown sugar,  coarse salt a little paprika and olive oil. I tossed the squash in paprika and coarse salt and olive oil instead of just pepper  which got rid of that bland taste. Less milk (1cup) less stock (5 cups) makes it a little better so it's a nice solid bisque.

Definitly not a cook, like not at all, and I did it! It was labor intensive but so worth it. I substituted cinnamon for nutmeg and it was still delicious. Definitly recommend!

It was delicious!  I used an unoaked chardonnay for the white wine - it was surprisingly perfect.  I added garlic and used less nutmeg - more of a savory than sweet soup.  Thanks!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it was the blandest soup I've eaten in a while. If I try it again I will have to do some major tweaks!  Sorry!

A local restaurant makes a sweet potato soup that I love.  I gave this recipe a try and it is as good as, if not better than, the restaurant's version. It is one of the best soups I have ever made - rich, creamy, sweet, and colorful!

This was DELICIOUS. I used maple smoked turkey bacon as that's what I had. It was so yummy. Complex enough for adult palettes but also "yummy for my tummy" as quoted by the picky eater in my house house.

Very savory in a sweet way.  I loved it!!  Add a little salt at the end to compliment the sweet more.  This will be a fall favorite.
