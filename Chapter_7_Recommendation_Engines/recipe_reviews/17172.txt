Only difference was out of necessity: I used half and half for the pudding mix as I was out of milk.  So very rich and creamy!    My husband said this was the best dessert I have ever made....  rave reviews by all who sampled!

I did a few alternation, and it was Awesome!
First: Use the Regular Graham Crackers-NOT Chocolate!  Second: Use FRENCH Vanilla Pudding. 
Third: Use Betty Crocker's DARK CHOCOLATE Icing (30 seconds in Microwave) and pour over the last layer of Graham Crackers. Refrigerate overnite...EXCELLENT!!

This recipe is extraordinary because it uses very ordinary ingredients that result in the sophisticated taste of eclairs.  

A few hints:  MAKE THE SAUCE FIRST!  It will be nearly cool and ready to spread by the time the other ingredients are assembled.  If you want a more "true" eclair taste, use honey graham crackers instead of chocolate.

You do not need to butter the pan first, and you do not need a full package of graham crackers.  I counted about 20 in my 13x9 pan.  

Take the time to make the chocolate sauce.  It tastes much better than canned, and doesn't have all that heart-clogging palm oil in it.  Also, the sauce needs only 1/2 t. vanilla in my opinion.

This is a Fabulous and Quick Recipe.  My kids LOVED this, the only thing I did differently was I added a can of Eagle Brand Condensed Milk to the filling (this gave it the same pudding taste as our favority no cook banana pudding)  Wow, it was great and even better the next day!  This is definitely a keeper at our house!

As a whole, the cake is VERY good.  However, next time I will use store-bought chocolate frosting rather than making the toping.  The topping gets hard and it is a little bitter.

Loved this recipe!  Everyone was very impressed and it was so simple!!!  I did attempt the chocolate topping but was not impressed wit the taste, so I found a review from MEME from a similar recipe and used that chocolate topping!  It was perfect! Just mix 3T Butter, 3T. Hot water, 3T Cocoa powder and about 1 and 1/2 cup powdered sugar (to desired thickness) and pour over the top.  Will definitely be making again and again!

Wow!  Easier than rice krispie treats (which I made at the same time) and everyone LOVED it.  I took the advice to use a can of frosting nuked for 45 sec. for the topping.  AWESOME recipe-- everyone wanted it!

This recipe is definitely a "keeper". My husband, who usually doesn't eat many sweets, couldn't get enough of this cake!  He kept going back for more! The kids also loved it, and they are picky eaters.  I also used the canned frosting with great results. The other reviews were right on-this tastes better the next day, so plan ahead when taking to a potluck...but be careful, there may not be any left to take with you!  :)

Hmmmm...I was pretty disappointed with this one.  It's really nothing special, I guess maybe because it has that "boxed" taste with the instant pudding and the Cool Whip.  My husband loves any dessert and he thought this one was "just ok".  My children didn't care for it at all.

Simple to put together and absolutely delicious. A little messy though, so I wouldn't recommend this if you are looking for something that "looks" good. Excellent chocolate frosting.  Definitely needs 24 hours in the fridge before serving.

This is one of the easiest, best desserts ever.  I have been making this for years with success every time.  It's really hard to screw up something so easy!  Try to make it the day before you want to serve it, if possible.  The graham crackers soften overnight, making it more like a cake.  And my preference is regular graham crackers rather than chocolate.  I also use 4 tablespoons of butter in the topping which makes it really creamy, not hard, as some reviews state.  You should get a thin crisp layer on the top of the icing, like glaze, and it should be creamy underneath.  Please don't ever use canned frosting on this.  I have seen that on many versions of this recipe (and a review of this one), but that is such a disservice to this yummy cake.  The icing is quick and easy enough to make, and it tastes so much better than canned.  I usually make 1.5 times what the recipe calls for!

Really good recipe.  The frosting was my favorite part of it.  I took this to a family get together yesterday and everyone really enjoyed it.  It is very rich, so a little goes a long way with this one.  I'm thinking of making another today, it's that good.  Angela

Excellent !   I have been making this for years.   I also make one layer of chocolate pudding & the other with vanilla.  I use 1 1/2 cups of milk to each box of instant pudding mix.  I also use honey graham crackers instead of the chocolate ones.  This topping is awsome !!!   I have always used the canned frosting before reading this recipe and the homemade makes it taste so much better!   Like others have suggested, make the topping first & then proceed with the puddings.     Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Family friendly fast & easy dessert made with ingredients on hand. Only change made, Instead of frozen whipped topping, I use 8 ounces real whipping cream added after the milk, prior to mixing with a beater - still comes out like a mousse.

This is one of my favorite desserts -- I make it even quicker and easier by using canned chocolate frosting.  microwave the can about 20 seconds or until it is very soft.   Pour it over the cake and spread with a spatula.  It will harden up some when chilled.

I really have enjoyed making this cake quite a few times since I first read it.  I think it's delicious and very easy to make and everyone that has had it loves it.  I've tried a few variations of it such as adding cream cheese but prefer the original best.  I have mixed both chocolate and honey graham crackers, alternating almost in a checker board effect and I do like it like that.  I recommend that if you choose to make the icing instead of buying like some reviewers have suggested, make sure the sugar is completely dissolved.  When you think it's dissolved enough, stir again and again.  The first two times I made it I thought the sugar had completely dissolved and both times I was able to feel the grittiness under my teeth.  I find the icing delicious and I like how it glazes the cake.  Try it you won't be disappointed.

i was a little skeptical when i read how easy this recipe was to make but it came out delicious.  you'll definitely want to keep it in the fridge overnight before eating it and make one and a half times the frosting, like everyone else suggested.  this cake is soooo yummy!!!

My wife and I enjoyed this very much.  I was surprised how easy it was to make.  Could one vary this recipe by using lemon pudding and regular graham crackers ?  Would the Cool Whip lessen the lemon flavor ?

This is one of my family's favorite desserts! It is so easy to put together, is very light and refreshing. I always make the homemade frosting...it is SO much better than that awful canned stuff. Thanks for sharing the recipe...this is a real winner! My family wants to have it often!

Great Recipe!! Here's a way to save some time...
In place of the topping use one can of chocolate
frosting (with foil removed) microwaved on high for 30 seconds. Just pour it on top & refridgerate.

I made this as written at home first and it turned out great.  I made it again for a meal at our church with a few changes to simplify.  I didn't use the chocolate graham crackers the second time because I thought they made it too rich.  I also used canned frosting that I had microwaved and poured over top.  It was quicker and just as good, in my opinion.  I like it set overnight because everything melds together well that way.

Update: My review is late coming, but wanted to let others know that subbing Bailey's for even a small amount of milk DID NOT WORK AT ALL!!!!  I wanted to make a "tiramisu" falvored eclair cake to go with Christmas Eve dinner, but dissapointingly, my dish did not turn out.  I don't know why either.  What an excellent recipe!!!!   A co-worker mentioned something similar to me, and when I saw this, I knew I had to give it a try.  I took this dish to a friends Bar-B-Q / cookout.  They absolutely loved it!  I didn't care for the glaze, though.  Mine turned out a bit grainy, and, due to being kept in the fridge (I refrigerated for several hours before serving - definitely a must b/c it softens the graham crackers and makes the dish taste more like a true eclair that way), it hardened on top.  I think I might incorporate other's suggestions next time in order to make the glaze more palatable (i.e. use less sugar or confectioner's sugar instead of granulated sugar, etc.).  I think 1.5 times the amount of glaze IS necessary (per other reviews) - the recipe as is does not yeild enough to evenly spread over the top graham cracker layer.  I used plain ("honey") graham crackers and  prefer them over the cinnamon variety.  I am thinking of trying this with a can of chocolate frosing and with a little Bailey's in lieu of the milk for a "tiramisu" style dessert as another reviewer mentioned.  YUM, YUM!

I have made this recipe dozens of times.....everyone has loved it and always asked for the recipe.  I usually double the chocolate topping recipe.....don't always need it all, but I find the original recipe not to give me enough coverage.

This is the most fabulous dessert ever!!! I only make this for special occasions like reunions. Because there is so much you want to share it with everyone. My family (hubby & 2 teenage boys) love this dessert! Everytime I make it everyone wants the recipe. This dessert usually out does every other dessert at the event!!! I use French Vanilla Pudding instead. Also making the choclate from scatch (just like the recipe) is way better then the frosting in a can, and does not take but 2 minutes. The crackers dont fit exactly into the bottom of the pan, but I cut a few up when I get to the ends and fit them in there perfectly. Oh and this dessert is not a "cake", it is more like a pie. Tastes exactly like an eclair!!! One other thing...I let this set in the frig for at least 24 hours, even 48 hours is ok. The flavors meld together. Yummy!

When I was growing up, one of my aunts always made this. It *is* indeed addictive. One thing I do that is a bit easier than this recipe is to use storebought chocolate icing. If you nuke it in the microwave on medium power for 30 seconds, it pours right over the graham crackers and looks just fantastic. (Don't try to spread it with a knife; it'll make a mess on ya.)

I have made this A LOT of times.  I usually substitute Bailey's Irish Cream for part of the milk, and people are so impressed.  They can't tell what it is.  Ridiculously simple, but great.

WOW!!!   I found this recipe when I did a search for "Award Winning."  We had a fall festival at church today with a Chili Cook Off for the men and a Dessert Cook Off for the ladies.  My husband used a recipe for chili here and he got 2nd- lost by 1 vote.  This recipe is great- very easy and everyone loved it.  I beat a strawberry cake that has won the Best Dessert for several years-  the room fell silent when they announced that this particular person got 2nd!  It is a great recipe and a huge hit!!!  One note-  I did a 9X13 pan and my graham crackers didn't fit exactly so when I did the glaze- some adhered to the pudding.  I ended up making another batch of glaze to completely cover it.  I would increase the glaze to 1 1/2 for a 9X13.  Thanks so much- I have a cool trophy!!

I suggrest making 1.5x the chocolate sauce so you have enough. Reduce the sugar in the sauce by 1/3 and cut the amount of butter in half. 

Use plain graham crackers, French vanilla pudding and real whipped cream.

You must use INSTANT PUDDING. Cook and Serve Pudding  will not turn out right.
Also I made a kind of glaze by microwaving 3 T butter with 3 T Milk- not to boiling.
Then stir in 3 T cocoa and 1/2 Cup or more depending on taste powdered sugar. Be sure to either sift cocoa and sugar or be prepared to whisk till cocoa and sugar are not lumpy. My family loves this recipe.

This is old-timey, my mom simply called it icebox cake and used regular grahams, not chocolate, and used chocolate pudding sometimes, sometimes a layer of vanilla and a layer of chocolate pudding.  It was really a staple dessert at our house and everyone loved it.  She did not always top it with cream of any kind, simply crumbled grahams over the top.  I still make it the very same way ... it's a snap and always a pleaser.

So easy and always a hit!!!! You can't go wrong. We like this best with Jello Instant French Vanilla pudding. To make it even easier, I skip the chocolate glaze part and top it with a can of prepared frosting (Duncan Hines Chocolate Fudge is best). Make sure to let it set several hours or even overnight before serving. This one gets better the longer it sets. YUMMMM!

This is sooo good! I use regular reduced-fat graham crackers, and instant sugar-free, fat-free pudding.  And either sugar-free or fat-free cool whip - depends on who I making it for. The homemade chocolate sauce is a must!!  It's so much better than can frosting.  However, I have tried making my frosting with Splenda - and I do NOT recommend that! It was bitter and artificial tasting. (did this for my diabetic husband!)  Maybe next time I'll only frost half!  Great dessert, and makes a large dish - great for potlucks and family gatherings.

i had some friends over for dinner last night and made this. i substituted a 7 oz can of light whipped cream for the cool whip, because that stuff is gross. i also used french vanilla pudding, and a can of chocolate icing. everybody loved it, especially my two year old...he literally licked his bowl clean! i had some today and i gotta say, this gets better the longer it sits in the fridge. i would definitely make it 24 hours before you plan on serving it.

I followed the recipe exactly (except I did use honey graham crackers rather than chocolate)and when I make this again I will do it the same way. I did take another user's advice to make the topping first. That worked out perfectly. This was a huge hit with my group.

This has been a family staple for many years! It's what we call a triple threat: easy, delicious, and family friendly. Use canned chocolate icing, nuke if briefly, and spread a thin layer on top. Made from ingredients most of us have on hand already. It's one of VERY FEW desserts I've ever made that both kids & adults love!!

This was such an easy recipe to make and a smooth, lucious taste!  I made it for our monthly company birthday party & everyone asked for the recipe.  Then they couldn't believe show simple it was to make.  I will make this again.  Might tast good in cupcake liners too if you crush the graham crackers - ???

I am embarressed about how easy this recipe and its ingredients are to make.  None the less, people LOVE it!  And you can easily make it low fat with light or non-fat whipped topping and sugar-free non-fat pudding.  It is a winner on taste, although my husband and I like it better with the honey graham crackers.

This dessert is one of the best I have found that is so quick and easy!  I used fat free pudding, skim milk and lite whipped topping and it was still rich and delicious.  I made it the night before as suggested and served it cold right out of the refridgerator. I doubled the glaze recipe which was a little too much so next time I will make 1 and 1/2 the recipe as others suggested.

I made this for a potluck at work to rave reviews, and it was so easy!  Its best after sitting, so make it the day before.  As stated in previous reviews, I would also make 1 and 1/2 times the topping just to reduce the frustration with spreading out the icing.  Definitely a recipe I will be keeping. Thanks Linda!

WARNING - Be sure to use ALL of the graham crackers, because they absorb alot of the milk - if you don't you'll end up with chocolate eclair soup like I did. But it was so darn good I had to eat it anyway! Be careful taking the can of frosting out of the microwave! Yes, it was a bad day! But a great recipe! I'm making another one this weekend!

My whole family has fallen in love with this cake!  The kids enjoy making it with me and it is always a big hit at potlucks.  I recommend doubling the glaze and keeping the graham crackers pretty coarse for better texture.

This is a great recipe, but even better with a few changes. I used low-sugar pudding mix to make it a little less sweet, and I would definitely use regular instead of chocolate graham crackers. The glaze also turns out better if you use less sugar -- makes it less like thick frosting and more like a real eclair glaze. The recipe says to let the glaze cool before you pour it onto the cake... It actually hardens too much if you let it sit for too long, making it impossible to spread evenly. I make a double batch of the sauce and only let it cool for a few minutes before I pour it on. Really delicious! My picky little nephews gobbled it up. Let it sit overnight for the best result.

My husband made this around noon and we had some for dessert that night and I thought it was "pretty good".  Well then we had some the next day and it was "absolutely delicious!"  I would recommend making this dessert the day before because it really does taste better after it sits for awhile.  I would also recommend putting more frosting on top.  Thanks for the delicious and very easy recipe.

This turned out great! I will definitely make it again soon. It keeps well in the refrigerator, so it is a good dessert for making a day in advance.

Great Recipe!! Even though I made alterations to fit my personal taste and what I had on hand, I am sure this would be just as great following the recipe.  I used regular graham crackers, (1)sugar free white chocolate pudding (1) Sugar free vanilla pudding and french vanilla cool whip.  As others suggested I also doubled the topping recipe.  ******The topping is a must, the recipe just says to bring it too a boil, but if you bring it to a rolling boil and time it for (2) minutes before removing it from the heat it sets on the desert much better, and tastes just like the icing on an eclair, YUMMM.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

My mother has been making this for 20 + years.  I know this is not a "low sugar/fat" site but since I've been trying to maintain weight and am now pre-dibetic I made some very simple changes that do not effect taste hardly at all.  Use sugar free pudding, skim milk and in the frosting use Splenda or comparable substitute.  I also found low fat graham crackers.  Cuts calories and fat WAY down and does not sacrifice taste.

I only gave it three stars because, for whatever reason, the frosting would NOT set properly.  I have made this recipe before (not from this poster) and I have never had a problem. Twice I attempted to make it tonight and both times it was fine until it cooled off, then it basically turned into brownie mix, a gritty, grainy nightmare. Definately will follow others users advice and grab the canned frosting instead.

UPDATE: Figured out the problem.  Not white sugar as in granulated sugar, but 10x instead. Now it looks as I remember!

I chose this recipe because it didn't call for the canned frosting.  Unfortunately, that was the only part that wasn't great about this dessert.  The frosting turned out grainy with a hard top on it.  The flavor was still great, and it was the perfect spreading consistency.  Everyone still ate the dessert, and I will make again.  Thanks!

Fantastic!  Super easy, although I let the chocolate sauce cool a little too much before spreading it.  Next time, I'll have it a bit warmer to make spreading it on top easier.  I made it exactly as written for a birthday party and everyone loved it.  I've particularly enjoyed eating the leftovers, as well.

This was a delicious surprise which tasted very much like an eclair.  I followed the recipe, but used sugar free pudding, skim milk, 1/2 splenda and 1/2 powdered sugar and low fat graham crackers.  The homemade sauce is delicious and should be made first, so it can cool while preparing the cake.  It cut beautifully after only a couple of hours in the refrigerator.  Can't wait to serve it to company.

Very good and a hit at the party even though it looked like chocolate covered melted ice cream.  I needed 3 adjustments:   1) The sauce (which should be doubled) should be made 1st - to give it time to cool enough before pouring over surface.  2) I'd give it an overnight stay in the frige - 3 hours just wasn't enough. While still hard enough - cut into serving squares or else it will look very sloppy.   3) And the sugar should be confectioners only.  I remade it with confectioners - huge difference - way better!

This is a great and really simple recipe. It's not the most elegant, but I suppose it depends on how you serve it. I used sugar free pudding, and it balanced well with the sweetness of the chocolate syrup. Next time I'm going to try using Splenda in the chocolate. It's a light and sweet dessert, but not overwhelmingly so, if you use the sugar free pudding and light cool whip. I froze half the concoction and put half in the fridge, at the recommendation of other reviewers. Personally, I prefer the refrigerated recipe only because it's soft like a real eclair.

This is a favorite with my family. I usually freeze it and serve it frozen or semi-frozen. I recently served it at a Super Bowl party. 1 guest commented that she had never eaten it frozen but thought it was much better that way. I have made it with as many  light or sugar-free ingredients as possible and still think it is great.

This is a wonderful recipe! It truly tastes just like an eclair! I also used more graham crackers than recommended, and suggest leaving in refrigerator at least 12 hours to allow graham crackers to soften.  This was more popular on Thanksgiving than mother's tried-and-true cheesecake! A new family favorite! Thanks!!!

This was so easy and very good! I halved the recipe and I didn't have whipped topping so I added 1/2 of a 1/2 pint of whipping cream to the milk mixture and whipped it until the right consistency.  Also, instead of putting a top layer of cracker ... I finished it off with one crumbled cracker.  This will be made again!

Very good.  A hit with the kids.  Next time I'm going to make homemade vanilla pudding so that I can use less sugar in it, just my taste.  I did the topping 1 and a half times the recipe and was glad I did.  Love chocolate!

A friend of mine's grandmother gave me this recipe and I love it.  Just an interesting note, I think the chocolate sauce is easier to prepare on a gas stove than an electric one--you have more control of the heat, less tendency to scorch.

This is the best tasting recipe, and it was a hit with our Homeowners Assoc.  In fact they all asked for the recipe.

This is absolutely one of the best and easiest recipes to take to barbecues....church socials...or just to have at home. This cake is so good that my daughter has decided she didn't want a traditional birthday cake...but this instead. I have served this at grillouts....and everyone wants the recipe.

Made a half recipe.  I could only find "low grade" chocolate graham crackers and wish they were better quality.  I'll use less chocolate grahams if that is all I can find, or try regular graham.  Simple, no-cook recipe, great for a summer treat!

I made this for a church dinner for 30 people.  It was so quick and easy! It easy to cut and served beautifully. Everyone raved and at least 5 people asked me for the recipe.  I used French Vanilla flavor pudding and regular graham crackers. I will absolutely make this again.  Thanks for an easy and delicious dessert recipe.

This is da bomb!  I first made this back in 1980 and I used arrowroot cookies. You can use almost any plain cookie that isn't chocolate covered - the kind you can dunk in milk or coffee and it gets soft quickly. Biscotti might even work but I haven't gone that far!

I needed a quick dessert to make for the Super Bowl so I chose this.I thought it was really good and I'm usually not a fan of pudding desserts.Everyone that tried it said it was really good.The only thing I changed was I used honey graham crackers and I halved the recipe and put it in a smaller dish.I only had time to refrigerate it for an hour but I'm sure it gets better the longer it sits.

This was absolutely wonderful!  I made it for my entire family and everyone raved over it.  My mother has a similar recipe that calls for Karo syrup with the chocolate sauce but I found that this simple chocolate sauce was much better and not as sweet.  Thanks for sharing this very easy and delicious recipe.

Wow, this is such a great recipe! I would recommend doubling the chocolate sauce that goes on top for a thicker layer. I also took advice from one of the other reviews and made the chocolate sauce first. I made it with regular graham crackers and refrigerated it overnight.

Yummy, super easy dessert.  Always well received at potlucks. I've never used the choc crackers, though. MAKE THE SAUCE!!  It's so much better and better for you than canned frosting, and since the rest is so fast and easy, it's worth it to spend 5-7 minutes on the delicious, glossy dark chocolate glaze.

Delicious.  This has to demolished within a day or two, any more than that the cracker gets too mushy but a winner at all the HBO Sunday parties I brought it to!  I sprinkled mini chocolate chips for a lil more chocolateness.

I am giving this dessert 3 starts because it is good and quick, but if you are looking for an amazingly home made tasting dessert, this is NOT it. I almost never buy anything boxed, and had mixed feelings about this cake. If I was to make it again, I would double the crackers in the layers (instead of a one-cracker layer, I would do a two-cracker layer) I dipped the crackers in milk for a couple of seconds before putting them in the cake, I made it about an hour ago and it is ready to eat. No need to refrigerate overnight. Also, I used Betty Cocker ready frosting.

I have one word for this cake..WONDERMOUS !!  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I did differently is that I doubled the topping. I read several reviews that the recipe as written made a very thin layer.  Other than that, it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this for years, and the key is the chocolate sauce that goes on top.  Try to avoid the temptation of using can frosting to cut down on time, the little bit of extra time is sooooo worth it.  So yummy, and always a hit at any function.

The "cake" portion was good the first day and very good the second day.  However, the topping was just too sweet and too much like un-set fudge.  It broke down and bled on the second day, leaving a very messy looking desert.  I'd try the pudding graham cracker layers again, but there's got to be a more stable, less sugary topping out there.

This cake is awesome! I made it for dessert and decided to scale it down to 6 servings instead of 12 and it came out fantastic I used an 8x8 pan. I took the advise of a couple other reviewers, and used french vanilla pudding, and also honey graham crackers instead of the chocolate. I made the frosting like stated in this recipe and thought it was way better than any canned frosting. I will definitely be making this again.

i made this receipe, but i made whipped cream from scratch, to make a tiny bit healthier.  also i made the chocolate topping a little healthier by melting dark chocolate chips with a little milk.  and...use different crackers (petit beure).  the cake came out good!

The only changes I made were to use regular graham crackers and substitute 8 0z of sweet condensed milk for one of the cups of regular milk. The rest of the recipe was exactly as written. Quick and easy. I Took this to a potluck and brought home an empty pan. Thanks.

I also altered the recipe a bit. I used a can of sweetened condensed milk and a cup of milk instead of 3 cups of milk. For the topping I melted 4 -1 oz squares of semi-sweet chocolate,2 tablespoons of butter,3 tablespoons of milk, and 1 cup confectioner's sugar in a small boiler over low heat just until melted. Will be making this more often and taking it to church and family functions.

I love this recipe. I made a couple changes. I use 2 boxes of 'french vanilla pudding',1 box of regular grahm crackers, and 3 1\2 c. of milk. For the frosting I use 1 1\2 c. of confectioners sugar, 1\2c of cocoa, 3TBSP. of butter melted,1\3c. of milk, 2 tsp. of corn syrup, and 2 tsp. of vanilla extract. Should be chilled for at least 24 hrs.  It turns out perfect.

I made this recipe for my family's Christmas party last night.  I have never been asked for a recipe when I've brought food before!  Everyone wants this one!!  My aunt has already reminded me 4 times to send it to her!  I did use the honey graham crackers and the french vanilla pudding and it came out perfect!  Everyone thought that the cake was a dead on for real eclairs (especially since we had them on hand to taste test!).  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Thought that this was very good considering how easy it was to make.  My husband ate it really quickly so I know he REALLY liked it.  In the future, I will use pre-made chocolate frosting (will put in microwave for 45 seconds first) on the cake.  I didn't think that the chocolate sauce was that impressive.
I will be making this again in the future!

This cake was delicious!  I used regular honey graham crackers instead of chocolate graham crackers, and it was still very good.  I did use store-bought chocolate frosting for the topping, and I think I'll try making the frosting myself next time.

There are several versions of this "cake" floating around, but this one is the best because of the easy-to-make homemade chocolate glaze/frosting. It tastes a lot better than store-bought, which is what other recipes use. It's so good that I actually use this glaze on top of chocolate cakes.

Increased the chocolate topping by one and a half and it still was not enough. I used confectioners' sugar and it still turned out grainy due to the cocoa powder. I would advise others to look up a different recipe for the topping. Otherwise it was delicious and very easy to make.

In my opinion, this is one of the most asked for, and "party-friendly", desserts of all time.  The,  "make the night before" instruction (an absolute MUST to soften the graham crackers) allows you to make it and then move on to other party preparations.....or go to bed as I usually end up doing!
I love the chocolate glaze and believe it finishes off this classy dessert and gives it the look of a true chocolate eclair.....dark and shiny.
As far as the prep for that, I have had to remake the glaze several times before due to ending up with a 'grainy" sugar mess.  I have now changed the prep for that to cutting down the white sugar to 3/4 cup instead of a full cup and allowing the sugar to dissolve in the milk (off heat) for about 5 minutes, stirring often.  Then, I add the cocoa powder, stir well, and slowly bring it all up to a SOFT boil, stirring constantly for 1 minute.  Remove from heat and add the rest of the ingredients as instructed.  Cool for just a little while, stirring gently, and then pour onto the top of the refrigerated cake.  The warmth of the glaze will allow It to spread itself out over the entire cake (with perhaps just a little help to reach the edges).  If you wait until the glaze is too cool, you will have trouble covering the entire surface.....since the coolness of the cake will quickly cool the glaze and turn it into more of a frosting...and there won't be enough to cover the cake!
This glaze recipe makes exactly the right amount...no doubling necessary!

I am sorry to say that I did not enjoy this dessert and neither did my 2 small children.  I did not find that the flavors melded well and found it overly sweet for me.  I am not used to useing packaged foods though and generally make things from scratch so that may be why I found it too sweet.

Absolutely delicious!  Take the time to make the topping.  I needed to cook on the stove longer than the recipe called for to be sure it was thick enough.  Great recipe!

This recipe is great, simply because of the glaze. I feel that canned frosting definatly takes away from the taste of the "eclair", as it is SO obviously store bought. I had no problem with graininess, as I assumed the glaze would by nature be a tiny bit "sugary". I bet this would be delectable with cheesecake style pudding. If you want the full on effect at this summer's picnics and potlucks, don't hesitate to take the extra time to make the glaze and let the cake sit overnite!

Very good and easy.  I just used regular graham crackers as well.  I let it chill in the fridge for about 12 hours before serving and I think it helped meld the flavors and textures together.

My hubby's aunt used to make this for him when he was little. It was one of those few recipes he never forgot. I was so excited to find it here! It was THE EASIEST recipe I've ever made, and yes, it tasted just like Aunt Jane's.:-) I used regular honey graham crackers rather than chocolate, and a container of chocolate frosting just like some of the other reviewers did. Mmm!! Can't get easier (or yummier) than this! Ally

I make this all the time! Instead of making the topping from scratch, just take the lid and foil off of a tub of Betty Crocker Milk Chocolate frosting and put it in the microwave for one minute. Remove and stir with spoon until smooth. Pour slowly over top of top of graham cracker layer. Refrigerate overnight or longer.

Very yummy. The chocolate sauce was a little thin, I wish it had been a little thicker. Next time, I will maybe use unsweetened chocolate squares instead of cocoa.

It is wonderful.  I made this dessert up to make sure it is one I wanted to serve at a 4th of July celebration at my daughter-in-laws parents home in Chs, South Carolina.  It was a hit!  The one I made and left in the refrigerator at home was also a hit with our house sitters.  There was some discussion as to who finished the last piece!
I have made it several times since and I will be making and serving another for our Labor Day BBQ.
The other reviewers are correct - you do not need to worry about leftovers - it is the first dessert to go!  Thank you for such an easy to prepare and wonderful to serve dessert.

My family thought this was terrific.  I made it about 8 hours before we ate it and kept it in the fridge.  This made the graham crackers turn more cake-like.  Will definately make this again.

I used French vanilla pudding and thought was good. I will try with regular vanilla next time like it says to see if there is a difference. I liked the chocolate topping I thought was good but will know next time not to stir it w but at the beginning while it is cooking because it made it a little grainy, but was still good, Granddaughter wanted to just eating the topping. I want to try with regular graham crackers also to see how it will taste.  Made for my daughter in law that not is a sweet eater for her birthday she is 30 and says I can fix it for her next year again, she liked it.

I have made this several times. Once I sent it to my husband's office Christmas party.  He assures me it was a hit, people were coming back for more and the whole thing was eaten up!!

I have requested this cake MANY times over the years as my birthday cake instead of a layer cake. Yum yum yum! Canned chocolate frosting works as well for an even faster yummy dessert!

This is a great recipe. I've made it with chocolate grahams and regular. I've also made it with just a bottom and top layer. I increase the glaze to 1 1/2 to cover better. Great recipe for the kids to help with, also! Thanks!

This really tasted like an eclair!! Amazing! I made it with my 7-yr. old and she actually did most of the work. It was incredibly easy. I used regular graham crackers for one of the layers and it added a nice taste. We'll be using this recipe a lot!

I brought 5 desserts to Thanksgiving dinner. This one was gone when I went back to get my son seconds.It kinda seemed unfair since this was the easiest to make. I will be making this recipe again and again. Thank you.

I love this dessert with the home made deep chocolate sugary icing. This is the only recipe I have found with a good icing. I like honey grahams in mine, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It's as good as the cafeteria style.
Note about icing- This icing tastes more like "dark" chocolate, has a granulated texture, and hardens to a perfect topping. It will be a little bitter for milk chocolate lovers, but I think it balances the sweetness of the pudding perfectly.

Great summertime recipe because you don't have to turn on the oven. I prefer the original graham crackers, my husband and son prefer the chocolate, so I compromise and make 1/2 of each. Everybody loves it.

I make this all the time. My family love's it, but for the topping I use choc. fudge ice cream topping melted in the microwave.  Then just pour it over the top.  SOO much easier.       Nonnie

Frosting difficult to work with. I followed the directions for the frosting, and let it cool. Then it was hard and dry and unspreadable. How are we supposed to cool it, without it hardening? Had to make another batch of frosting to cover up the first.

For the ultimate version that everyone will rave about...use regular honey graham crackers w/ French Vanilla instant pudding.  (Chocolate graham crackers are fine w/ reg. Vanilla instant pudding.) Make the frosting on the stove w/ the cocoa... the frosting from the can just doesn't cut it.  It is quick, easy, and everyone thinks you spent hours making the dessert.

This is a great recipe and so easy to make. Every time I make it for potlucks someone asks me to share the recipe.  The only thing I do different is add extra melted butter to the frosting.  Only using 2 tablespoons make a harder frosting that tends to crack.  If you use 4 to 6 tablespoons you will get a softer glaze like you would find on an eclair.  I think it tastes better with regular honey grahams crackers over the chocolate ones, but it is good either way.  I find that the chocolate graham crackers are sweeter since they are coated with sugar and they tend to get a little mushier than the honey grahams, so the texture is a bit different.  Also, let it sit in the refrigerator at least 8 hours for best results.  I cannot imagine ever substiting this frosting with the store-bought kind.  You must try it!

Delicious recipe and very easy preparation makes for the perfect combination. I make it for gatherings at friends/family and also for work...everyone always asks me for the recipe.  I typically use the chocolate graham crackers, but you can mix it up and use regular ones too.

Don't make this unless you want to become very, very fat! It's like heroin. I'm telling no lies. It's really wonderful,especially the chocolate topping. I used Ghirardelli cocoa powder and that's the only way to go. It only takes a few minutes to make the topping, so please don't use store bought frosting. The topping is the best part. I also omitted the cool whip and made fresh whipped cream with heavy cream. This helped to cut the sugar and all the other junk in cool whip. However, it made the cake a little too soft this way. In my opinion, if you serve it for company, use the cool whip so that it holds together better. But if it's for home, then make it with the real stuff. I need to wait at least another month before making another one unless I want to buy new jeans! Everyone else, enjoy!

I love the ease of this recipe.  Tastes wonderful.  Only change I make is omitting the frosting and adding more cool whip on top with chocolate shavings on top of that.  Frosting is too sweet for me.

I've been making this recipe for at least 20 years.  My original recipe calls for three boxes of French Vanilla Pudding it has a richer flavor than the regular vanilla.  I always use regular cheap graham crackers - don't bother with the cinnamon or chocolate varieties.  Also since the pudding mixture is soooooo rich I stopped using frosting and just crumble up some Oreo cookies on top.  This is a desert you MUST make the day ahead - the crackers really need to soften in the pudding for it to taste right.

Amazing. All 4 kids are already calling it their new birthday cake, lol. It has high potential to be used with real cake as well as the graham crackers. I'd also suggest a new chocolate sauce, one that isn't so runny even after chilling it for 24hrs in the fridge as another user suggested. Overall, great & inexpensive to make. Thank you!

Oh my gosh, this cake is out of this world crazy awesome! Its better than a regular eclair! And so unique and easy! Literally it took me 15 min to make, including the frosting! I am not sure why the "READY IN" time says 2 hours and 25 min! I would say at most 20 min. I would recommend this dessert to anyone who needs a easy dessert that will wow their guests! Just a tip, make sure you only use two 3 ounce packages of cream cheese, most pudding packets have 2.3 ounces, that throws off the recipe completely. Enjoy!

I only gave this 4 stars, because the chocolate layer on top was to soft.  I may have did something wrong. However, the flavors were amazing.  I used tradional honey graham crackers too rather than the chocolate one.

Sooo Good! So easy, made with the kids and everyone loved it! Going by other reviews I used french vanilla pudding, honey crackers and I did buy the frosting. Actually I bought two and put an extra layer of frosting in the middle! Made the day before and when I cut into it I thought it would be a mess, but it came out PERFECT!!!

Just made this recipe for the first time this afternoon to take to a BBQ tonight and everyone LOVED it!!!  My husband, who isn't usually a fan of desserts (Yes, he's CRAZY, ha!), absolutely loved it and I know he'll be requesting I make this again.
I took some advice from fellow reviewers who suggested using honey graham crackers rather than the chcolate, I used french vanilla pudding rather than plain vanilla, and I used only 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Other than those 3 minor adjustments I followed this recipe as it was written and it was not only super easy to make, but it tasted even better.

Wow, ths cake is amazing. Super simple ingredients come together to make something greater than the sum of its parts. I cannot trust myself around this cake so I'm only making it when I have others to help me eat it... Potlucks and dinner parties only!

This was yummy and very easy! It's a great recipe to make when you're tight on time, and want to feed a large crowd. I've made it twice, and it's been a hit both times. I gave the recipe 4 stars, because it doesn't look particularly fancy when it's just sitting in the pan untouched. It looks very much like a kid or very amateur cook prepared it. So it may not be pretty, but it tastes great.

Just like everyone said it was the favorite at the Easter table! I made 5 desserts and this was everyone's favorite. I was lazy and went with the canned frosting like many suggested and it was good, but next time I will definitely make a fresh ganash. I went with the classic french vanilla pudding and cinnamon grahams. will also like to try making it with other flavors also. Great recipe!!

This came out better than expected! After reading the reviews, I was a little worried it would be a dressed up pudding but it was fabulous! Made double the chocolate glaze. Would definitelty make again!

I have made this cake many times.  Each time everyone asks for the recipe...it's THAT good!!!  The only things I do differently from the recipe are: 1) I double the chocolate topping, 2) I use regular honey graham crackers only because the store I shop at never has the chocolate ones, and 3) I use French Vanilla pudding.  This is just so easy and a true hit with everyone who I've served it to.

I make Eclair cake all the time. But we use plain Grahams and store bought frosting. Heat it up until easily spreadable and pour over the top layer. We have also used French Vanilla Pudding for a richer taste.

This turned out really well. People were really impressed and they compared it to tiramisu. I was a bit skeptical of how it would hold when it was dished out but it came out pretty easily.  

I can't imagine using canned frosting though, with the pudding mix and frozen whipping cream already being so processed.

I made this in a 10x10 pan and divided the filling into thirds. I also placed it into the freezer for about an hour to chill it faster. For the chocolate topping, I used chocolate chips thinned with heavy cream. It was delicious and looked very nice when plated too.

I used cookies 'n cream pudding mix because that is what I had and regular honey graham crackers. I also added about 3 oz of cream cheese in with the pudding because I wanted to use it up.   Topped with some leftover chocolate sauce made for a cake, tasty but a little hard to cut into. Think I will just use chocolate frosting next time.   Delicious - even for breakfast.

So easy to make!  And it tastes great.  Every time I make it, I get asked for the recipe and people end up surprised that it is so simple.  Definitely does *not* have a "boxed" taste as one reviewer suggested.    One change I made for the holidays was that I replaced 1/4 cup of the milk in the pudding mixture with eggnog.  It gave it just a hint of that eggnog flavor and came out really great.  It made it a little more rich, but we still had no problem finishing it off!

This is an incredibly easy dessert to make and people are always impressed with it.  I alter the recipes as follows:   Use real whipped cream instead of frozen whipped topping - this gives it a more authentic flavour.   I also use 100% cocoa bars as I find this tastes better than the powdered cocoa.    I recommend you make your own icing, its much tastier than the store bought kind and also not quite as sweet.    Also tastes nice with coconut or banana pudding for a change.

A big hit!! Grahams go soft when left overnight in the fridge---which makes it wonderful!! I would multiply frosting ingredients by 1.5. Doubling is too think, but single is too thin.

I made this pretty much exactly as written, except followed some of the reviewer's advice and used cinnamon graham crackers and french vanilla pudding.  Everyone loved it and I would definitely make it again.  I did refrigerate 24 hours before serving and the chocolate topping set very nicely.  It wasn't messy at all, didn't run so maybe the key is to refrigerate 24 hours or so before serving.  Thanks for a great addition to my dessert menu!

I'd give this 4.5. It was VERY good. I kept licking the bowl. I'd recommend sticking with the recipe for the chocolate sauce. Sure, a can of chocolate frosting would be easier, but it's rather less like an eclair, which is kinda the goal. I made 2 changes. I made my own whipped cream before mixing in the pudding and milk. I also split the cream mixture in half and mixed 2 T of cocoa into one part. I was glad I did that. More chocolatey and more visual interest. I will make this again!

This stuff is way too good!! I agree with others that it is addicting. I used regular graham crackers and french vanilla pudding like others has suggested. It came out nice and holds together to get it on the plate better than I expected (I refrigerated it overnight.)

I used to work at a deli about 15 years ago, and this was one of their signature desserts,  Like other reviews, we used to nuke a canned chocolate frosting and poured it over the top.  Once set overnight, this really did taste like a big chocolate eclair!  Thanks for bringing this easy and delicious recipe back to me!!!

This TASTED GREAT, but it was really ugly.  (used french vanilla pudding)  Someone even came by and said it looked like a pile of graham crackers with pudding and hershey's syrup...and that's pretty much what it was, except I made the chocolate sauce on the recipe and it was too runny and didn't cover the cake.  Wish it was as pretty as the cover photo, but it didn't turn out like that AT ALL.

After reading through many of the reviews I did the following: 1) used honey graham crackers, 2) used French Vanilla pudding, 3) used the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" for the chocolate sauce and doubled it. Took the cake to a dinner party and everyone loved it, however I am my own worst critic. I think the chocolate sauce turned out a bit grainy and turned too thick. After keeping the cake out of the fridge for a little while the sauce thinned out a bit and was a little better. Great treat for all...just need to perfect the topping sauce.

Amazingly tastes exactly like an eclair donut- especially the next day!! Super easy when you use melted store-bought frosting.

This cake is wonderful and so easy to make!  After reading several reviews from this recipe and similar ones I made the following changes and it turned out perfect!  I used normal honey graham crackers and used Cheesecake flavored pudding instead of vanilla for more of a rich flavor.  I let it sit overnight and the layering turned out perfect.  It wasn't messy at all when serving and truly tasted like a chocolate eclair!  Will definitely make again and again.

Wow, this was great! I used regular graham crackers and made the satiny chocolate glaze from this site - it was SO SO good! Such a good birthday cake!

I made this for my daughter's 4th birthday.  She wanted a Halloween birthday so we decorated it with a scary decorations and she loved it.  I used honey graham crackers as someone had recommended and used light cool whip.  My almost 4 and 5 year old had a really fun time putting the graham crackers in and licking the bowl and spoon.      We let the cake refrigerate overnight also as recommended.  After tasting the pudding cool whip mixture the night before I was not hopeful that this would be very good, but it was delicious and it did tast just like an eclair. My 3 kids and husband devoured it!     My only complaint was the chocolate frosting.  It had a good flavor to it, but mine turned out very grainy--maybe I heated it too quickly--I am no chef.  If I made it again I would definitely find a new recipe for the topping--one that is more foolproof.     Other than the frosting this was excellent and I will definitely make this again.

this dessert is a traditional dessert in my family at least 25 years, but there is one proble with it when you make the chocolate topping you need to use one stick of butter than 2 tablespoons then you need two double the whole chocolate topping recipe so its like  fudge. take my word for it and try it

Had to bring 2 desserts to a gathering so since this looked so quick and easy I gave it a try.  Although it seemed to go over pretty well at the party, I didn't care for the taste of it.  It basically tastes like pudding and graham crackers.  I don't think I'd make it again.  OK I'm here updating my review because since I wrote it, my 14 yr. old son told me that he absolutely loved this dessert and heard many others at the party talking about it.  He wants me to make it again.  Well, what do you know??? :)

Great recipe. I did not think the glaze was enough so I doubled the glaze the second time I made it, but I did not double the sugar. Super easy and sweet!

Made the following changes:  Used one layer of chocolate graham crackers on the bottom, used sugar free, fat free white chocolate instant pudding, skim milk, low fat graham crackers and cool whip lite.  We had leftover chocolate icing that I added cool whip to and melted in the microwave.  Poured over the finished cake and refrigerated overnight.  I have made this many times and this definitely was the best! I will use this combination every time!

This is a favorite in our house.  (If I take it anywhere else, I have to promise to make another batch for my husband!).  My mother in law has asked that I bring it to every family function.  And I definitely recommend that you make it a day ahead, there is no comparison.  Other than that, I haven't changed anything.  Also, I do use the sauce and haven't had any problems.  It was grainy a couple of times, but I think that I just didn't boil it quite enough.  DELICIOUS!!

I have been making this recipe for years and everyone who has ever tasted it, loves it!  You can make a "diet" version by simply using skim or 2%, low fat graham crackers and Cool Whip lite.  Personally I like this version better as it isn't as rich. The only other thing I do to change this basic recipe is, as others have done, use dark chocolate icing in a can (the cheap brands work just fine), increase the amount of vanilla extract (I just guess at this)and sprinkle chopped pecans over the icing.  You will definately be remembered for this dessert!

A keeper!  It's so easy and I always get compliments. It's best if you can make it the day ahead.  The longer it sets the better.  For the frosting I take a can of chocolate frosting and heat it in the microwave.  Then just pour it on.  Once it cools it's like the frosting on a boston creme doughnut.  Yum!

Such a breeze to make.  I went with regular graham crackers, so it ended up tasting vaguely like a s'more.  For the pudding, I used soy milk, which doesn't set up unless you cut it in half.  I followed another reviewer's advice (from another recipe) for the frosting: 3 TB cocoa powder, 3 TB butter, 3 TB hot water, and 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar. Not grainy at all.  Thanks a bunch!

My mom made this for our family when I was just a kid.  Well, I'm not a kid anymore but this is still a great recipe--especially for a big crowd.  I would highly recommend using the recipe from the back of the Hershey Cocoa can for the frosting though.

This is wonderful!  My grandmother used to make this cake for my brother when we were little.  All 3 of my kids (ages 8, 6 and 4) loved it! So did the rest of my family.  My dad ate about 1/4 of it alone!  I agree w/other writers though; do your self a favor and make the frosting.  Also, I used vanilla & Fr. Van. pudding.  I made the frosting first and while it was cooling down I made the rest of the cake.  I put it in our fridge that we have downstairs (yes, I am blessed to have 2! :-) which I believe is set a little cooler than my other one so it stayed together beautifully when served!  YUMMMMMMMYYY!!!

This is really good.  I made it for my mom's birthday in July as she is a fan of eclairs with real pudding in the center and she loves this.  I thought it presented well as I used a glass 9 X13 and I guess you could use a fancy glass bowl as well.  A really nice polished looking top!  Thanks for sharing.

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner and my husband's family loved it.  I used honey graham crackers instead of the chocolate graham crackers though.  The only small "fault" I found was that the glaze tasted a tiny bit grainy.  If I were to make it again, I would probably try using confectioners sugar instead of granulated sugar.  The pudding filling was wonderful!

For such simple ingredients, this is a great dessert.  My husband wanted to make dessert for my birthday and I found this recipe.  It was simple for him to put together & it tasted great.  He took the left overs to work because I was sure I would devour the entire thing the next day.  I'm looking up the recipe again today because I want to make it for work tomorrow.  Simply delicious!!!

I've made this a few times and it's always a huge hit!  Do yourself a favor and take the extra two minutes to make the chocolate sauce rather than using pre-made.  I use sugar-free/fat-free pudding, light whipped topping and honey graham crackers.  With the sugar and butter in the chocolate sauce, it all balances out without being too sweet or too rich.  Easy, quick prep and consistently delicious.  I can't ask for more from a dessert.

What a great recipe!!  I made mine with one box of vanilla and one box of banana cream pie pudding (all I had in the house!) and it was FANTASTIC!!  We ate an hour or so after making, so it was still crunchy, but the next day, it was GREAT!  My 3 year old went into the fridge, took off the plastic wrap and continued to eat out of the dish from the refrigerator!!  He has NEVER done that with anything else before!!  LOL  Couldn't miss the spoon laying in the dish and the pudding all over his face!  Thanks for a great recipe (and a great laugh!!) and will definitely make this again:)

This was really close to my mother in law's recipe. She uses plain graham crackers and I think they are better with it. Very delicious!

This is one of the most delicious and easiest recipes I've tried from this site. I melt (in the microwave at 30 second intervals) just over a half of a tub of frosting in place of the glaze to make it even easier. You only need a really thin layer of frosting to cover the top layer of graham crackers for this rich dessert. I like it with chocolate fudge frosting and my husband likes it with vanilla frosting.

I must have done something wrong.  First of all, not thinking it would make a difference, but because one package of crackers wasn't working in a 9x13 pan, I used an 8 x 8 dish.  The "cake" turned out more like a pudding.  I just served it in wine glasses, but no one was impressed.

This is an absolutely awesome dessert that is fast and easy to make for potluck dinners or large gatherings and always a hit. I modified it just a little, I used 10x powdered sugar for the glaze and it definitely made it much smoother and eliminated the lumpiness that some people described. Made the mistake of making this for our monthly church dinner and now they won't let me in the door unless I have this dessert with me!

I have made this several times using several variations--We did not like the chocolate graham crackers--too rich..we used plain instead..we also tried French Vanilla pudding and Dark chocolate frosting in a can..not near as good as plain vanilla and plain chocolate...the canned frosting idea that another reviewer gave earlier is an excellent and wonderful time saver!!  Excellent recipe, easy to half, and everyone asks for recipe...Thanks!

Ohmigosh, is this the best or what?  Took it to my company luncheon & as soon as word got around, it was GONE!  Everyone wants the recipe.  The only change I made was to make 1 1/2 recipes of the icing so it would cover better.  And I also could not find chocolate graham crackers so used chocolate graham cookies.  I think it would be just about as good with regular graham crackers though.

I doubled the chocolate... this is the best dessert EVER!  My daughter wanted this for her birthday cake and it's honestly best after sitting in the fridge over night.  The graham crackers absorb moisture from the pudding and it just melts in your mouth.  If you like eclairs you will LOVE this.  OMG.  It's on our dessert hit list!

I have made this many times, however, not once has it turned out looking like this picture. You simply cannot cut it in squares...but, I find it to be tremendous if you use French Vanilla pudding, scale the milk back by a quarter of a cup and only use half of the Cool Whip. If you do that, I believe it is 5 star worthy and truly taste like an éclair. To serve, scoop it out into a Margarita glass with a dollop of the left over Cool Whip and Bam!  Otherwise, it is just a blob of pudding with chocolate laying on your plate.

My Choco topping was gritty and I should know better.  Be sure the sugar is completely dissolved in the boil.  May take more than one minute.  Be careful not to burn it though as choco burns quickly.

The whole family loved it. I made only a few changes that I read from other reviewers. I used French vanilla pudding and I added 4tbsp instead of 2. Jim I froze it overnight. Next time I might make more of the chocolate topping but it was gone within 20 minutes at the family BBQ

Absolutely the BEST!!! I made this with original graham crackers. The chocolate syrup was perfect and went on easily as a thin layer of delicious dark chocolate. We determined we would love to each eat an entire 9x13 dish of this Chocolate Eclair Cake! Very refreshing!

Made this yesterday to take to a friends house for lunch today.  Yum!  Will definitely be making this again.  I ended up making two batches of the topping as one did not cover it enough so next time I will just double the topping recipe to begin with.  I did use french vanilla pudding mix and extra creamy cool whip. This reminded me of an ice cream sandwich.

Delicious! The frosting was worrisome because the sugar did not melt, but it was nice with the little crunch.  If you don’t want the crunch, use Karl syrup for sweetener.

Delicious and easy! This is a great crowd-pleaser. I made only a few minor changes to this delightful recipe. First and foremost, make the sauce first! This way, by the time you're done with the pudding and arranging your crackers, the sauce will be nice and cool. I doubled the sauce because the first time I did this recipe I felt it needed more chocolate glaze. I also increased the butter amount. I used 5 tbl to ensure that the glaze would be creamy. I bought regular graham crackers,  and I used French Vanilla pudding. Use a whisk to mix the pudding, a spoon does not mix the milk and powder very well. Then fold in the cool whip. Also, the chocolate topping was a bit grainy because of the granulated sugar. You really need to take your time with the sauce. Stirring constantly and on low. Next time, I will try powdered sugar. Waiting over night makes all the difference. We ate it the following day and was well received by all!

I substituted canned Chocolate Fudge frosting for the cocoa etc. Microwaved it for 1 minute at 70% power and it pours on very smoothly. 
Always a hit at family gatherings.

This was really great  - I did use white chocolate pudding and also used a canned frosting slighty melted for the topping.  Also made the same dessert with regular graham crackers, lemon pudding and cream cheese frosting to top it off.

I had trouble with the frosting in this recipe, I think it needs to be powdered sugar instead, regular sugar too granular.  Eating it today at our block party later.  We'll see what the response is.

Just used the icing on regular eclairs.  It hardened but liquid (condensation?) oozed underneath the eclairs.  Would icing sugar be better?

Not sure how to rate this. I have made it in the past and it has been excellent. However this time when I made it the pudding mixture seemed extra running and I couldn’t get the chocolate topping to spread. I loved this when it turned out right. Any suggestions on what I did wrong this time.

excellent... I did melted semi sweet chocolate chips with condensed milk for the topping. turned out well and lpved by adults but milk chocolate chips would have been better and less bitter for kids.  I also used plain graham crackers.

Super delicious and super easy. The topping made it for me. I've made eclair dessert before just using heated up canned chocolate icing, and it wasn't nearly as delicious as this. This topping sort poured over and hardened into a rich chocolate crust... SO good! I got rave reviews on it and a flurry of recipe requests. The only different thing I did from the recipe was used French Vanilla pudding instead of regular vanilla--it made it richer. Delicious!

I used unsalted Saltine crackers in place of the graham crackers and after setting overnight the crackers are similar to an eclair shell.  I used 1.5 cups of light cream + 1.5 cups of milk which made the instant vanilla pudding mixed with the defrosted cool whip so very creamy.  And I used a can of fudge chocolate, microwaved and melted, on top of  the last layer of crackers.  Cover with aluminum foil.  Don't forget to let it set 24-48 hrs in refrigerator prior to serving.  Always a hit!!  So yummy!!

I needed a quick dessert for an impromptu dinner. I did not have (2) 3 oz. pkackages of vanilla pudding so I used most of (2) 5.1 oz. packages and I used real whipped cream with a teaspoon of powdered sugar added instead of cool whip. Also, I added sliced bananas and flaked coconut to the custard layer. I only had cinnamon grahams so I used them and it ws delicious. Sprinkled top of chocolate with coconut. This dessert was a huge hit. Looked and tasted like it came from a bakery.

I followed the directions as written except that I only had the larger packages of pudding on hand so I used 2 of those and the dessert turned out wonderful.  I also used regular graham crackers because I had them already.  Made it twice now and it was a hit.

Loved this!  I made it with the French Vanilla as suggested, second round I made extra filling and it was great.  I made the chocolate sauce tasted great looked not so great, I am not patient enough to do this.  Next time I will cheat and use the canned frosting method.

This is excellent!  I use a can Chocolate frosting (your choice of brand) and put in microwave for 30 sec. to soften and pour over the top.  Nix the choc coco and sugar/milk.

Used unsweetened coconut milk because some can't have dairy. Even people who are not coconut fans (you really couldn't detect the coconut milk) loved this!  My brother had to move away from it because he couldn't stop eating it!  The frosting was perfect for this recipe.  We preferred the honey graham crackers - more like eclairs or Boston cream pie.

This is so good! However I made a few tweaks, I like more pudding in mine so I did 3 packs of pudding and only 1/2 tub of extra creamy cool whip. Instead of making the chocolate topping with cocoa powder, I made a ganache using 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup heavy cream (just put the chips in a bowl, bring the cream to a boil and pour over the chips, stir and let it melt them, stir again to make smooth and pour over top of the cake. So delicious!

This could not be easier! The longer you let it sit, the better. But I served it after 3hours, and it disappeared from the potluck table so fast!

It's so easy to make and it tastes great.  For the chocolate topping, I made chocolate ganache using bittersweet chocolate instead.  It turned out good because it's not as sweet.

My husband is a diabetic. I used sugar free pudding & cool whip, reduced sugar graham crackers (not chocolate), and decreased the sugar in the topping to 3/4 cup. Very quick and cool on a hot day!

This recipe was AMAZING!  It tasted just like Éclairs.  The few things I changed was to use honey graham crackers and the pre-made icing.  I brought it into work for my 20 Male co-workers and it was gone in minutes.

It was okay if you like the taste of pudding a lot. This cake doesn't really taste like an éclair, it just tastes like pudding. Also, it doesn't keep well, so you will need to eat it in the first 3 days that you make it. This is a good recipe if you love pudding.

I followed the recipe exactly but something somewhere still went wrong. My pudding mixture was complete liquid, and I thought it was supposed to be more like mousse. My husband suggested refrigerating it overnight anyway. Didn't help, next morning it was just complete mush. I had to throw the whole thing away and run to Walmart to get him a birthday cake. I was really excited about this cake because my husband LOVES eclairs, and it just ended in disappointment :(

Delicious! This is one of the easiest desserts i've ever made and very yummy. I split the recipe in 1/2 and assembled it in a 9x6 loaf pan. The only problem was that it fell apart when i was taking it out of the pan, which is my own fault, not the recipes. I will definitely make it again. Thanks Linda!

Tasted great but the chocolate syrup wasn't good and very runny and had to make extra bc it didn't even cover the top of the cake. Suggest using chocolate frosting instead or fudge topping instead. Also used regular graham crackers instead of chocolate.

I loved it and my 12yr neighbor comes back everyday for more.  The best compliment was "If we had this at our bake sale we would have made a $1000.00."  She now wants me to make this for her birthday!Did not change a thing other than used honey graham crackers..even better the next day!

Loved it!  But used regular, not chocolate crackers.  Also for topping we used:  6 tbsp butter,
Two 1 oz squares semi-sweet chocolate, 3 T. milk &
1 ¾ cup confectioner's sugar.  Tastes best after sitting in fridge overnight.  Will make again!!

I made this twice now, the first time exactly as stated, the second with some of the suggestions. Both were excellent and loved by my kids.  I used honey grahams the second time as I am not a big fan of the chocolate ones. Also added a tbsp on vanilla extract to the pudding and substituted a can of condensed milk for some of the regular milk. These two additions help make the pudding taste more home made I think. Would love a holiday version- peppermint filling would go lovely with the chocolate grahams.

Great and simple chocolate exlair cake recipe that I have been using for over 4 years. The kids and I love it and it always gets rave reviews at family or church gatherings. Don't be tempted to use ready made icing...the recipe's chocolate icing  really makes it special like a real exlair taste.

This was so delicious and my family loved it! It was easy to make as well. I used normal graham crackers instead of chocolate and it was still amazing. It is light, creamy, and satisfies that chocolate craving too! We were all fighting for the last piece.

Definately 5 stars...at least!  This is SOOO good!  I did follow the advice given by a few before me and used french vanilla pudding with 3 cups of half and half instead of milk and it turned out so rich and creamy!  I also used canned frosting instead of the suggested sauce and regular flavor graham crackers instead of the chocolate ones.  It tasted just like a chocolate eclair!  This is my brother's favorite dessert and I made it for him when he came to visit and he said it was the best dessert he's ever had!

The pudding and cool whip made this glob that wasn't spreadable.  I followed the recipe to the "T" and it did not work for me.

AWESOME!  I used honey graham crackers, replaced one cup of milk for one cup of heavy whipping cream, and replaced one of the boxes of french vanilla pudding for banana cream.  YUM!!  Was a huge hit.  Will be making again and again!

This was wonderful!! I only made one change.  Instead of using unsweetened cocoa powder I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa.  I let it sit for 24 hrs before we ate it and it was perfect.  It was easy and delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Great recipe.  However I ended up doing things differently because I didn't have the proper ingredients.  I used 1 pkg vanilla pudding 1 pkg chocolate instead of 2 vanilla. Used regular honey graham crackers. Instead of making the frosting (discovered I was out of cocoa) I reserved enough of the pudding mixture to put on top.  And it still turned out yummy!  Does definitely turn out best if it sits for 24 hours in the fridge for crackers to soften up.  Can't wait to have all ingredients on hand to try the recipe to the letter!

Fantastic! Made enough for over a 100 people and it went over so well. I ended up splashing some evaporated milk over the graham crackers so they'd be ready in a few hours. Pretty forgiving dessert, I didn't measure milk or anything, just threw it all together hah.

Excellent recipe! I made this to take to a cook-out and the reviews were fantastic. I made it the night before, but thought it tasted even better after sitting one more night in the fridge, so the next time I make it I will make it 2 days in advance for ultimate flavor!

This is my son's favorite. I made it with regular Graham Crackers the first time and the second time with chocolate GC. Chocolate was definitely better. I also micro icing for 15 -20 seconds, stir it and pour over the entire dessert...yum Thanks for a yummy easy dessert =)

This has a pretty good flavor. It was nice and cool during the hot summer weather. I was hoping for something more exciting but it simply tastes like pudding to me. Also, the graham crackers got soggy overnight.

Amazingly tasty and sooo good!! I forfeited having ice cream at my favorite place, just so I could have one more piece of this deleciously sweet goodness. I took the advice of others since I was in a hurry to make the cake. I used the canned, Betty Crocker Classic Chocolate icing and I also added 1 can of condensed milk and cold milk to the filling. ( equaling 3 cups, together). My guests loved it and clearly I did too, since I went back for more the next day!

I used reg graham crackers in place of the chocolate, but otherwise didn't change anything. If I tried it again I would probably try the french vanilla pudding suggested and either cut the frosting recipe in half or use canned. It was just way too sweet for us, and the frosting made it even more so.

Huge hit with the kids.  They couldn't wait unil the next day so the first night we had a crunchy version as the graham crackers had not softened yet.  I personally liked it best the next day as it melted in your mouth and tasted like heaven!!

My family loved my "light" version of this recipe. I followed other's suggestions and just microwaved a can of icing in the microwave and poured it on top. I also used regular graham crackers not chocolate.

This is a GREAT, easy and quick recipe!!  I used sugar free pudding, and regular honey graham crackers.  You would never have know I was skimping on sugar.  I will use this alot.  But be sure to make the choc topping first, and making the whole thing the night before is best.

Everyone loved it! I was in a hurry so I did the melted container of frosting for the topping in lieu of making it. Next time I would treat the very bottom layer like a graham cracker crust and mix with some butter and a little sugar abd press, bake and cool; then I would preceed as normal. The bottom unbaked, as-is fell apart for me but was still very tasty.

I gave this three stars because I did not think it tasted at all like a chocolate eclair.. it was still good, just didn't taste anything like an eclair! I followed some other user reviews, and used honey graham crackers and betty crocker chocolate frosting for the topping. This is a nice, light dessert.

Easy dessert that looks fancy.  I made this for a potluck using cinnamon graham crackers and french vanilla pudding.  The chocolate glaze is the best part--I don't recommend using store-bought icing!

I make this with duncan hines chocolate icing and regular graham crackers just like many of the other do.  The one trick that I use is, I make sure that I use just a little more milk than the recipe calls for so the crackers will soften faster.  My mom made this for me as a child and my family begs me to make this.  So Easy!!!

This recipe turned out fantastic exactly as written.  The only thing I did differently was use regular grahams instead of chocolate and I too prefer the French Vanilla pudding.  I MUCH prefer making my own chocolate topping and the more vanilla, the better!  My husband loves choc eclair cake, but the other recipes I've tried leaves the filling too runny and doesn't set up well.  This was just perfect.

I would give this 3 stars, but it all got eaten at my work's Thanksgiving potluck. It sat for about 1 1/2 days before serving. I used French Vanilla pudding. I thought it still had that "fake" taste from the Cool Whip. Next time I will try it with real whipped cream to see if that fixes it. Also, the icing was difficult to get smooth. I threw out the first batch. Turns out you have to heat it verrry slowly. The sugar has to completely dissolve before it comes to a boil, otherwise you will have grainy frosting. I had to add a little extra milk to get it smooth. The graham crackers end up kind of blending in and holding the cake together-they aren't as noticeable as I thought they would be. This was a crowd pleaser, I just wasn't entirely comfortable with it.

I didn't care for the chocolate topping too much, i thought it was too gritty. If I made this again I would just probably try replacing the sugar with powdered sugar. Also used plain graham crackers because that's all I could fine but they were great.

I think this will become a regular standby dessert. It held up very well and sliced lovely. I recommend using the frosting in the recipe for the top, it was just the right sweetness, and quick to make. Have had lots of requests.

Good for a crowd.  I made one low sugar version (sugar free pudding and low sugar fudge sauce, bottled) and one regular.  For the glaze, I used powdered sugar in place of granulated and it was much smoother.  I also used regular graham crackers, not chocolate.

Ok, so easy and so fabulous!  I made it the day before serving and used low fat honey graham crackers and light cool whip to cut back on fat and calories a hair...I was also lazy and just did chocolate frosting for the topping.  My guests could not stop eating it, everyone, young and old, ate and ate and ate until the entire cake was gone.  I have never once served a 9x13 size cake and had it completely disappear, I will make this one again and again, thank you!

Wow!  Who knew something so simple could be so good.  I LOVE this stuff!  I couldn't find the chocolate graham crackers, so I went with the regular ones.  And, I initially doubled the chocolate sauce just in case it wasn't enough ( I LOVE chocolate ).  But, I found that the regular amount worked well.  We will definitely be making this one again!

We didn't have whipped topping in the house, and just used plain graham crackers. It was still amazing! I think the homemade frosting is definitely worth the trouble and next time I might double it in order to get more even coverage.

Yummy!! I made this for Thanksgiving and it was really tasty and so easy! I listened to the other reviewers and used french vanilla pudding and the honey  crackers. I also used the Betty Crocker dark chocolate frosting and it was a big hit with everyone.

I originally received this recipe from my husband's cousin, who is an amazing baker.   It is so good.  KIds, of course, love it.  But, every time I make it the adults always want the recipe after going back for seconds.  Unbelievably easy to make, but it is tough to wait hours to eat it.   It is almost as good to eat right away, though.

Wow! This was incredible! I used honey grahams, diet versions of pudding mix and cool whip, I added a tsp. of vanilla extract to the filling mixture, and topped with just half a can of melted chocolate frosting. 

I made this yesterday morning for a family get together and served it after dinner. It was scarfed down rapidly by everyone who all thought it was fabulous! This recipe deserves five stars for being super easy and super delicious, if possible I would give extra stars because the ingredients can be subbed with diet versions. 

PS ~ For variations I think if I used vanilla frosting it might be similar to a Napoleon pastry. Or maybe eliminate the frosting top and just use some shaved chocolate on top.

I had lost my original recipe for this so I thought I'd try this one.I added another layer of graham crackers (dividing the pudding mixture into thirds). The frosting was really bad tasting and barely covered the top. I'd try another frosting recipe next time.

This dessert truly is delightful.  It's impressive and pleases all ages.  I made it for a group of friends last night--they all loved it.  I even made it with lite whipped topping, low fat graham crackers, and sugar free pudding.  The icing I did make from scratch and made a one and half recipe of the frosting.  It is key to make this ahead of time so the graham crackers soften up, making a nice moist crust.  I'll make this for several up-coming events!

Took this to a Mother's Day picnic. Everyone raved about this! In fact, by the time I went to get a piece, the whole entire thing was gone! I guess I'll take that as a sign that it was delicious and very worth all 5 stars.

The recipe I have is very close to this one. only difference is you use confectioners sugar and don't cook the topping. I made it in 2 smaller pans so I can bring one to a friends house and have one for home. worked good.

Sinfully Rich!!! Everyone in my family LOVES this recipe. I make it up the night before i plan to serve it, so the grahmn crackers soften a bit! I've also used the chocolate grahmn cracker sticks, it makes it easier to serve up! Perfect for a chocolate fix, you'll be surprised how quickly it dissapears.

This is awesome and easy.  To make it even simpler, I recommend using chocolate frosting instead of making it from scratch for the topping.

It sure was quick and easy, but it was not to my taste - nor to anyone in my family.

I have made this with the chocolate topping, and it is very good. However, this time I put cherry pie filling on the top, and that is very good, too!

SUPER easy recipe. After winning first place in the dessert category for a Potluck Cook-Off at my work, I was almost embarrassed to give out the recipe! I made it even simpler and used canned chocolate frosting.

Great.  Many requests for this one.  I used regular graham crackers instead of the chocolate.

Excellent dessert! However, I was a bit skeptical when making it. I wasn't sure how it would taste like an eclair. To my surprise, it turned out fabulous! Everyone loved it, including the kids who aren't big dessert eaters. My brother in law loved it so much, he requested it for Thanksgiving dinner. This is definitely a keeper!

I've already made this twice! The first batch I used sugar free vanilla pudding and the second time I used sugar free banana. Banana was everyone's favorite. I also used honey graham crackers. I didn't have much luck with the frosting, so I heated a can of milk chocolate frosting for the topping. The longer it sets, the better the crust gets. Yum!

Who knew something so simple could be so yummy!  I much prefer the homemade topping to frosting from a can.  Very rich, very good desert.

This recipe is a hit with my family, especially my husband who loves eclairs!  It's so easy that my 9 year-old can prepare it.
