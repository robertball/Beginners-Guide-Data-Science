This is a very acceptable moist chocolate cake.   There have been complaints about it being dry so may I offer a few hints:   you should use butter and whole milk and when you beat the egg whites make sure they are not dry - just rounded peaks.   I think this will make a difference.   I realize how frustrating it is to have a cake come out dry, but this one really is not

Very disappointing.  I was expecting a custard like cake.  This cake was dry and very much like a boxed cake mix.  I felt like crying after the taste test.  What a waste of my time and ingredients. Chocolate frosting helped a bit but would never consider making this cake again.

It was a waste of time and ingredients and it was very dry! Not what I was expecting at all.

I have to say I was very disappointed. The cake was dry. It was not over cooked, the custard need better instructions.
