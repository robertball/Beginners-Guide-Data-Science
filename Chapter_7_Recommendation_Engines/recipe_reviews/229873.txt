This recipe was super simple and had great flavor.  I served with french bread as suggested and it was great with the cream cheese.  I used cream cheese with 1/3 less fat and I couldn't even tell it wasn't regular cream cheese.  I also used only about 6 oz of cheese in each bird as that is all that would fit.  I highly suggest this recipe!

This recipe turned out great. The only thing I did different was that I was able to split an 8oz package of cream cheese between 3 game hens because I couldn't fit anymore than that inside of them. Husband said it was delicious and my kids didn't complain. My toddler even loved it.

Out of this world indeed! I marinaded the cornish hens with garlic,rosemary,salt,white wine and Kansas steak seasoning for 4 hours before cooking. Mouthwatering taste. Highly recommended.

This was a delicious recipe! I did however only use one package of cream cheese. I also added some McCormick Montreal chicken seasoning to my cream  cheese!

This was easy and turned out fine. The meat was moist and juicy. I did have to turn on the broiler for the last couple of minutes to get it brown.

OUTSTANDING!!  I've tried several game hen recipes, but all fell into the "blah" category until I found this one.  It's amazing!  I did find that one brick of cream cheese is plenty for two hens, and leaving it in the bird keeps it warm for spreading on the french bread.  Wonderful!

Congrats on an excellent recipe. As a Chef I have done this for years except adding fresh minced garlic, chives & parley to the cream cheese mixture. It is great baked or use a very cheap aluminum foil & wrap them tightly & throw on the grill on high heat turning every 15 minutes for 1 hour. KUDOS!

I halved the amount of cream cheese to be stuffed inside the hens, cook times as well as oven temp were spot on. I recommend, if you can monitor the bake, using melted butter to continuously  baste the hens, making the skin crispy and moistening the hen further.

Excellent!  I put it in the oven, left the house and came back within 45 minutes to  a great aroma throughout.  I cooked it as instructed.  It was beautiful and delicious.  And, I DID serve it with French bread, my husband loved it.

One of our absolute favorite ways to have Cornish Hens.  We don't change a thing and serve it with  asparagus small salad and fresh baked bread. So fancy and to die for! :)

Wonderfully easy recipe and delicious! The first time I made it I stuck to the recipe, but the second time I decide to fry up some bacon and mix it with the cream cheese. I also used the bacon drippings and dribbled it on top of the birds before baking, along with the butter and seasoning. I served it with roasted asparagus. It paired very well with the cream cheese. Thank you for sharing.

Yum. I added some already cooked bacon in the cream cheese mixture and on top. I also used the vegetables I had on hand under the hen just adding salt and pepper.

I made this one night and it is awesome,  half a 8oz cube of cream cheese per bird was perfect though,  but I changed it up just a little, I added bacon jelly to the cream cheese and garlic,  if you love BACON then you'll love this.. then I topped each bird with the mix and sprinkled dried onions on top...this is something that I would make again and again

Great recipe! Amount of cream cheese recipe calls for was the right size for my cornish hens, although I found it a little thick and strong for my liking. Next time I may try baking as directed, and afterwards adding the excess cream cheese to a french roll for small garlic bites and broiling a couple of minutes.

I doubled this recipe to make 4 hens but otherwise followed the directions to the letter... the chicken came out fantastic but I do feel that the cream cheese sauce didnt do this dish justice... I will be tweeking this idea next time by maybe substituting the cream cheese with cream of mushroom soup or something of that nature and using it as a sauce to go over the top and stuffing the chicken with stuffing to soak up some of the liquid of the sauce so the bottom of the chicken doesnt get so soaked and slimy... my family is really hit or miss with cream cheese so this may just be our preference so dont let us turn you away from this recioe as it definitely has flavor and potential. Thanks for the idea!
