A great big WOW... these are absolutely fantastic! It's one of those recipes that is so original and delicious that it really deserves more than 5 stars. I did made one change and that was to omit the broccoli slaw and cabbage and just use a bag of regular cole slaw mix. If you use already prepared hummus and pre-cooked chicken from the grocery store this healthy and filling meal would be ready in just minutes. Thanks so much for this great recipe!

This was a really good, quick meal.  I couldn't find broccoli coleslaw mix, but I used a tri-color mix and some fresh broccoli and it turned out great.

This is an interesting recipe, in a way, a variation of fajitas.  I cut the chicken into small strips.  It took me a while to get the garbanzo mixture creamy in the blender so I added a little lemon juice for extra liquid.  I think you could just substitute hummus (even flavored) for the blended creation as a shortcut.  Also I think it would be interesting to substitute some uncooked broccolini or broccoli slaw (it comes shredded in a bag in the veggie dept., if you're having problems finding it) on top of the hummus & chicken for a nice texture.

Wow!! I wasn't sure I'd like this at all but I wanted to try something new. It was fantastic.  I cut up turkey cutlets instead of chicken. I also used store bought hummus with roasted garlic. I will eat this tonight for dinner too.

Good dish. Not the best hummus I've tasted, but it's comparable to anything you can buy at a regular supermarket. Still, I'm glad that I now know how to make it.

This was a great wrap recipe.  I love hummus, so I was looking for a recipe with hummus in it.  My husband and oldest son really liked it.  I cut back on the amount of garlic and left out the onions.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  It made enough hummus that I kept extra in the refrig for future use.

After all the typical 4th of July foods (burgers, brats, coleslaw, potato salad) my boyfriend and I both wanted a unique but easy lunch. This satisfied our craving for both requirements! The hardest part is the blender (and even that's not too hard). I had some packaged coleslaw mix from the day before so I used that BUT I didn't have broccoli coleslaw (I don't even know what that is). So I took the former reviewer's advice - used chopped red and green bell peppers. I also used more chicken and added some diced celery as well. Finally, I too added dashes of onion/garlic powders to the chicken saute. I did have to add a little more S&P to the "spread" but no biggie. We LOVED THIS RECIPE! Taste like it came from a deli when really it was outta my kitchen! If we could give it 10 stars - we would! Thanks for the AWESOME recipe!!

Finally, I didn't have garbazo beans so I used a can of northen beans. Still - VERY GOOD! My daughter and I loved these!!  GREAT LUNCH and I will make this quick and tasty dish again!!

These were SO good.  I was surprised at how tasty they turned out to be.  As others have said, I had lots of extra of the hummus style sauce.  I will be making these again!

I loved this! My husband said it was OK, but I did add too much cumin and forgot the salt and pepper.   I followed the recipe otherwise. I will make it again!

This is a great recipes- except for the hummus mix.  I really do not like this recipe for hummus.  Instead, we buy our hummus premade that is delicious.. and combined with this recipe it is out of this world!  Thanks for sharing!

Easy to do, does tend to have a little too much garlic in the sauce, I used only cabbage and it was great - don't overcook cabbage.

Very tasty, healthy quick balanced meal. A little too much garlic in the bean spread.  I also added some cider vinegar to the cabbage/chicken mix for acid.  Very good!

Fantastic! This is so good! I used left over grilled chicken. I left out the brocolli slaw because I did not have it  - and I used store bought Hummus. Next time I will make the sauce that is written in the recipe. This is my "go-to"  recipe for leftover chicken! So good and filling!

Fabulous and just as good on the next day.  The only complaint I have is the strong garlic taste in the sauce, so I'll just leave the garlic out next time.

Love this recipe. Even tastes good as leftovers warmed or cold for sack lunch. Almost vegetarian with just a little chicken to leave your stomach happy and satisfied but light. Regular repeater item in our house! Gluten free too as long as you get gf tortilla wrap.

I had to give this a five-star rating because even my husband who doesn't even like coleslaw ate three tacos while humming "mmmmmm" and I had absolutely no leftovers!  This is a keeper in my family.  I blended the hummus together for about 2 to 4 minutes because I found the better I blended the more creamier the hummus became.  Absolutely delicious, thank you!

Easy, quick and very nutritious recipe! Drained the beans just a little to make the sauce a little thicker - the hummus recipe is great on its own with veges, crackers, etc.  Great recipe for a picnic lunch.

This was a wonderful lunch. I cooked the chicken up with the onions and garlic instead of using leftovers and left out the oil completely I used some bagged coleslaw mix instead of plain cabbage as that was what I had on hand. The garbanzo bean mixture was very tasty, but it made two cups and I really only needed about 1/4 cup per serving. It was plenty. Next time, if I am bringing this to work again, I think I'll cut back on the garlic in the sauce. Tastes good but I need to find a tooth brush. :)

I was very surprised how good these were!  I was seeking a recipe using what I had on hand and this fit the bill, although I never would have thought of combining cole slaw mix, hummus and tortillas!  Keeping this recipe.  My variations:  store bought hummus, no broccoli slaw, but did use onion, cole slaw mix and chopped red pepper.  Very quick and easy weeknight meal.  Everyone liked it.

This was a really, really good recipe. I made it exactly as it was written and the only change I will make next time is to reduce the Cumin by 1/2. It's a personal preference and other than that we all loved it!

My husband and I didn't like this recipe at all. I didn't follow it exactly - I used our favorite store-bought hummus.  Not sure if the recipe would be better with the recipe's hummus.  I thought it looked kind of bland but it got such great reviews so I decided to try it.  I really wanted to like it but it just didn't have much flavor.  My husband said it was boring and was trying to find things to dip it in.  Sorry!

This was excellent!  I used a 16 oz bag of coleslaw mix instead of the broccoli slaw and cabbage.  It turned out wonderful!

I really liked it.  I took the advice of using a pre-cooked chicken and some hummus from the grocery store.  However, my kids did not like it at all.  Too much vegetables in it!

What a great recipe!  It's healthy, easy to make, and the whole family loved it.   I used chicken and doubled it...  It was fantastic!

I had made a whole chicken that I didn't like, so I was looking for a way to use the chicken, but make it tastier.  My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I already had store bought hummus so I used that and I used a frozen veg mix that was broccoli, green bean, mushroom and onion.  Thanks for the idea, would have never thought of making these wraps on my own.

Thank you for this recipe!  I had to change some things since I have a severe heartburn problem and can no longer eat garlic or onions (amongst other things).  I used to make a world class hummus with lemon juice (a no-no now) and tahini and I had just been wondering how to make a yummy hummus without the lemon when I saw this.  I drained off about half the bean water and added the mayo, mustard, cumin, and salt and it was awesome.  Of course my chicken only had chicken and slaw and salt.  I added tomatoes to the wrap and hubby and I are now addicted!  Thanks again!
