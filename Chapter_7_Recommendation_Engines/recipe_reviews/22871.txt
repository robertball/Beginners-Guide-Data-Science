Very bland. You need some broth and spices. It is very dry

This is a great dressing recipe-almost like my mom's.  I do pour chicken broth on it, it adds a little more flavor.

This is very close to the recipe handed down to me by my German mother.  I buy packaged stuffing mix and add turkey broth.  Add parsley, a little salt and pepper as well.  Great stuffing.

This is almost the same as my mother used to make. I did add more seasonings, such as sage, thyme and garlic, along with salt and pepper. We also did not use eggs, only the butter. Also, we used chicken broth and not the liver.
