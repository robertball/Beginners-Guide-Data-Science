Excellent recipe! Like others, I of course had to try the tomato soup. I was a little iffy when I started mixing the soup and egg mixture together, but do not fear! It turns out great.  I added 1/4 cup of butter in with my mashed potatoes and used a graham cracker crust instead of a traditional pie crust, as I prefer graham cracker. Great for a non-crust lover.  For those of you wondering how much mashed sweet potato you need, it's 1 1/2 cups per pie. 3 large potatoes is very vague and I ended up having to double my recipe and make three pies out of it.  1 hour is a perfect cook time for my oven.  5 stars! Will definitely be trying this again.

I tried this just because of the tomato soup.  It turned out well, with that darker "crust" or film on top and the custard ligher on the inside just like my grandma's pies at Thanksgiving.  I've never been able to get any sweet potato or pumpkin pie to do that before.  Like most custard pies of this type, it takes about 1/2 hour longer to cook than what the recipe states, but I expected that.  The tomato soup slightly tempers the sweetness of this pie (though don't get me wrong, it's still very sweet!) and nobody would ever guess that tomato soup is the secret ingredient.  This is my second favorite sweet potato pie recipe.  It has good flavor and the texture is perfect.

This sweet potato pie is absolutely delicious.  Curiosity made me try it because I would never have imagined baking a sweet potato pie with tomato soup in it.  I plan to make it again and again.  My family and invited guest loved it also.  It was fun having  them try to pick out the "unlikely" ingredient also.  Again, this is a great sweet potato pie with wonderful texture and the right amount of sweetness that I think most people will enjoy.

When I noticed what was in this recipe, I had to try it. My family was hesitant as well, but this has been the best sweet potato pie I've had yet. Curiosity has paid off! :) enjoy

Did not tell my guests what the secret ingredient was. They did not seem to enjoy it either. Not a pleasing flavor. Will return to my traditional recipe.

Giving this recipe 4 stars because it was good but not great.  The tomato soup does give this pie a different taste, not bad, just different.

Sorry to say I didn't like the taste. There was a heavy aftertaste tha obscured the sweet potato flavor. Not a success
