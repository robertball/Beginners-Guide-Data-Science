I made this recipe exactly as the the video shows, except for my substitution of vanilla bean paste for vanilla extract. It was divine!!! The flavors are subtle and delicate. The custard is moist and perfectly sweetened.  Just as Chef John states the fresh berries really shine, which is what I hoped for most. To make it ooze decadence I would top it with vanilla sauce.

I used a gluten free flour mix, almond milk and coconut sugar to make this gluten free, dairy free and low glycemic. It's was delicious!

Made this last week for our anniversary breakfast on the deck, perfect weather, mimosas and the start to a beautiful day.  Anyway, went by Chef John's recipe exactly except used a 9 inch baking dish, and it was perfect.  Easy, quick and delicious.  Not "eggy", but custardy.  Do NOT overcook this.  Mine had a tiny bit of dryness on the very bottom of the casserole dish, but that was ok.  We are having company tomorrow for brunch and this is going to be the star of the morning for sure!!!!

I found this recipe because I ended up with an 18oz box of blueberries this summer and wanted to try something new.  I increased the recipe proportionally, and it was slightly deeper; I also refrigerated it.  I used 1% milk and whey low sugar alternative.  This sliced up into a lovely low-calorie 'dessert' but I actually find I love it for a cold breakfast in summer.  I love custard and pudding so this was right up my alley.  I tried the same recipe with bing cherries and strawberries, which were more trouble and not really as good as the blueberries.   Incredibly easy and delicious.  When I make it with blueberries, I use a little lemon zest and nutmeg with the vanilla and the fragrance while it bakes is intoxicating.

I love Chef John's recipes. I was hoping I could comment on the video. I'm making this for the first time on Thanksgiving for my family. I LOVE custard desserts, so I trust that will will be just what I want. Chef John, I've been a fan of your cooking and your humorous videos for a long time. I would love to say thank you and send you a package of some handcrafted items I make.  You truly would never be able to know how you have given back to your viewers

I've made many variations of this and like it best with a blueberry-cherry-raspberry mix. Like it least with strawberries (cooked strawberries, noooo!). Also, I use less sugar because the fruits add enough sweetness.  Made this a few times with gluten-free all-purpose flour and it turns out fine too.

I've been making this recipe off and on for a number of years.  First hear of it on Iron Chef by Cat Cora.  Used Cherries.  I have since over the years used all kinds of fruits and mixtures, depending on what I have on hand.  Lemon or orange zest kicks it up a notch as well.

Very easy and very good! I used frozen blueberries, and I do think that was a mistake. It took much longer to cook and didn't puff up like it said it would. Still tasted great, and I will definitely try again with fresh blueberries. I will cut the sugar to 1/2 cup next time.

Not the best dessert I've ever made, kind of bland except for the blueberries.  And it took almost twice as long to cook as indicated in the recipe. I usually recommend  John recipes, but Skip this one if you're looking for a special dessert.

I made this for breakfast instead of a dutch baby. It was a cinch to make. Did not have blueberries, so I used mixed fruit that I had in the freezer.  I took out the fruit the night before and let it defrost in the fridge and drained off the extra juice so my dish would't be soggy. I will make this again!

Just made this for the first time. I used frozen blueberries but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was super easy and fast to make and turned out perfectly. It is a little on the sweet side but I like my desserts sweet. Next time i will try using splenda.

Loved this.  I may have added a bit more vanilla than called for because I didn't measure but it was wonderful.  The berries uncooked had too many seeds but cooked were wonderful.  The batter turned into a great custardy pie.  I'm going to try with more fruits.

I had to cook this for almost double the time (might have been my oven). Great way to get in fruit that has to be used!! I used blackberries and blueberries and almond milk. The custard-like texture is really yummy

Have to ask Chef Jean if he really means 1 tablespoon of vanilla. Way too dominating for my taste. Loved the dish. Will make it next time with a TEASPOON of vanilla

This is amazing! It finally cooled enough to try it and it was soooo good I woke my husband up from a sound sleep to feed him! It’s super easy, not overly sweet so the blueberry shines through.  The only 2 changes I made is 1) I used 1/2 T Mexican vanilla because that’s all I had on hand. Will definitely use it again, too. 2) I substituted 1/3 of milk for heavy cream because I only have 2% milk in my fridge. 
It isn’t too sweet as it is written.  It’s perfect! 
This will be gone by noon tomorrow so I’m going to make it again...tomorrow!

I made this recipe yesterday when wanting a different treat to use my organic frozen blueberries in.   I thawed and drained excess juices from the blueberries first though as frozen blueberries would likely interfere with the proper temperature of the batter as well as the  rising of the clafoutis while baking.  It is such an easy recipe and the blueberries were the perfect fruit to put into it, in my opinion.  I used a 9.5 inch by 3 inch pie plate and it was beautiful and delicious!  Great recipe, Chef John!  I've never been disappointed when using your recipes!

This was excellent! I have 4 large blueberry bushes and I'm always baking something, I liked the flan like moist texture, I liked it in the morning also. Its a CLAFOUTIS a French dessert.  This is a winner!

You never let me down. I've made custard before on the stove top, but was hating how long it had to be stirred. This was perfect. The only adjustment I made was 1 cp milk, 1/2 whipping cream.
I like a bit of Valencia orange peel with blueberries. It was like a blueberry flan. Delicious!!! Easiest recipe I've ever made.

I am a Chef John fan and make a lot of his recipes. I like this one and made it using the ingredients and instructions specified, but, somehow, it didn't quite turn out right. I baked it for 25 minutes and, when the middle was still shaking, I put it in the oven for 5 more...but, when I took it out a second time, it hadn't solidified much more. I just let it cool at that point because I didn't want to overcook it, but I probably should have baked it a little more. There was liquid under the baked layer. My guess is that's not how it's supposed to turn out. We did eat the baked part and it was delicious. As everyone has said, the amount of sweetness was perfect to accompany baked fresh blueberries and there is just the right amount of vanilla. I am going to try this recipe again and, hopefully, when I add the extra baking time, it will turn out perfect. We love blueberries, but this would be great with other fruits. I'd like to try this with fresh peaches before they're out of season! I also like the fact that this dish is so quickly and simply made. Great dish for the summer!

I followed the directions and this came out exactly as its supposed to. It was also exceptionally simple and fast to throw together. This is not a really sweet dessert, and has subtle flavors.  The group I made this for wasn't too keen on it, but I thought it would be good as a light, refined dessert, possibly with vanilla ice cream a la mode.

I have made this several times with fresh wild blackberries.  It is divine.  The custard is sweet and the berries are tart.  Cannot wait to make it with blueberries.  Great easy and impressive recipe.

The flavor is very mild, but in all honesty I only used 1/2 TBSP vanilla, because 1TBSP sounded like too much.  This is a super quick recipe and would be great for unexpected company.  The next time I may try adding some cinnamon or lemon zest to the blender mix. This would also be good by subbing raspberries for the blueberries and almond extract for the vanilla extract.

I made this for a dinner party dessert.  I took other peoples suggestions and added some lemon zest and a dash of cinnamon.   Everyone loved it.  There was none left

Quick and easy dish with a surprisingly gooey texture. The blueberries really shine, as the pastry has a rather mild flavor, which is just the way I like it. My only deviation was whisking the mixture instead of using a blender, but the results were still wonderful. I can't wait to try this with other berries.

I will make this again. I intend to double the recipe next time. My family loved it. I used a mix of blueberries, raspberries and strawberries. Thanks for the recipe.

The blueberries are definitely showcased well in this recipe. I made the recipe as written. I did not care for the texture of the base .... none of my family did. Would probably make a pie instead.

SUPER easy, even without a blender.  Highly customizable for other fruits (fresh or frozen), and easy to double or halve, as needed. I typically add an extra egg to make the batter a bit richer and fluffier; I use natural brown sugar instead of white sugar. I sometime add a dash of booze (i.e., Amaretto, St. Germain Elderflower, rum, brandy, eau de vie, etc.) if you like.

Alight and very tasty dessert that lets the fruit shine as the star.    We loved the custardy under layer also.  This will be made again.  Can't wait to try it with other fruits.  So easy and quick to put together.  We had guests over for dinner and I was able to whip this up quickly and put it into the oven while we ate, then it was just the right temperature after dinner, a bit warm and wonderful.  My guest loved it and ate 2 servings!

I made this in the toaster oven because my cook stove oven is broken. I did have to cover it with foil after 20 minutes. 
It was delicious even from the toaster oven! Stuck to the pan slightly so next time I'll butter it heavier. Seems like there could be so many variations with other fruits too. Since I bought too many blueberries I'll make a double batch tomorrow and give one to my neighbor.

Once again Chef John nails it. I used less sugar (diet restrictions) but it was still incredible. Wondering if cinnamon or nutmeg would be nice addition. Not one to monkey with recipes so those might be horrible suggestions

The kids loved it .  One of my kids is allergic to uncooked fruits so this easy recipe is a great way to serve her fruit with no problems. I've made it with various other fruits now, like strawberries and blackberries and all turned out well. Hoping to try it with peaches with added cinnamon.

I made this "Chef John's Blueberry Clafoutis" last night exactly as the recipe reads.  I wasn't able to find a 2 1/2 quart pan, so I used a square 2 quart glass pan.  I also used fresh blueberries.  During baking, It puffed up like a souffle' and pushed up the sides of the pan quite a bit (about 2 inches above the rim), but it didn't run over.  (I'm sure this is why the 2 1/2 quart pan is recommended.)  Although it looked juicy in the center when I removed it from the oven, it was set .  Also, as it deflated, it evened out.  I served it sprinkled with confectioner's sugar which made it look very pretty!  My husband loved it and practically finished off the entire pan minus the 1 1/2 pieces which I had.  I had a piece warm, as suggested.  Later on, I had a piece cold and I thought this dessert was better cold.  From what I've read, I think Chef John's recipe is on target for this French style dessert, however, I really didn't care for it myself.  Once the dessert sets, the bottom texture is more jellish and similar to flan. Unfortunately, I don't care for flan or the texture of it.  I'm more of a cobbler fan.  I rated this dessert 3 Stars "It was ok"... I'm sure my husband would have given it a "Good"... I guess it's a matter of personal preference. If I were to make it again (for him!), I think I might add a little cinnamon to the blueberries... of course this would be a twist away from the  "French version" of the recipe.  If you enjoy flan or

This recipe was OK! I usually make Chef Johns recipes and they turn out very good. This one not so much. It lacked flavor. I am hoping that the flavor will develop after it cools off completely. I followed the recipe to a T. Even my blueberries were sweet enough to make up for the sugar the recipe calls for. It was still bland. Also, it seemed like 1 pint was too much for the custard as my French husband pointed out. To him it was so so.

Great recipe for baking with kids and seasonal fruit. I followed the video exactly and it was a hit. The consistency is quite custardy. Use a spoon or hard cake server to serve. My husband asked for it to go in the regular rotation.

Made this for taking to the office on Monday.  My big mistake was taking a bite and giving my husband a bite,  now it is half  gone.  Followed the instructions  except for reducing the sugar which I do in every single recipe I do.  Will make another to take to office keeping this one for ourselves.

I made the recipe exactly as instructed. The center looked way too underdone so I had to cook it longer. I did not care for it. The blueberries don't  work well with the custard type base (for me) and then the color if you refrigerate leftovers just becomes unpleasantly mingled. Just my opinion though; you should try for yourself if you like the looks of it.

At this point, if I search an ingredient and a Chef John recipe pops up, I don't even look at anything else.  As a French teacher, I cringed a little at his pronunciation of "clafoutis" (which does NOT rhyme with "patootie"!).  But as a home cook, I rely on his recipes for raves from family and friends.  The only difference between this and his other recipes I've tried is that it's so ridiculously easy I have to putter about in the kitchen for a bit to make it seem more complicated to impress the family.  I had my doubts when it came out of the oven with a rising cone in the middle looking like a volcano about to erupt.  But by the time it cooled and deflated and we were ready for dessert, it looked like a magazine photo.  Thanks again for another winner, mon chef Jean!

I made it following the exact recipe and was pretty happy with the outcome. I baked it for approximately 27 minutes; lightly browned on top. I had expected the consistency to be a little more like the clafoutis I’m used to from French bakeries, but this was more custard in texture (though not eggy in taste) and a lot less cakey.

I've followed the recipe exactly..every time. And i can't even count how many times I've made it. Everyone loves it! When i first started making it about two years ago, it was expected at every early sunday football game... no changes needed.

To make this a little less carb friendly; I used Spelt Flour and Non Sugar sweetener and lt cream instead of milk.  This is a very good dessert instead of a blueberry pie, or a plain custard.  Only had a 2 qrt dish - took a little longer to bake - lowered the temp a bit and came out fine.

Grated a tablespoon of fresh Parmesan into this the first time. Did not the second time. Loved by all both times but I personally much preferred no Parmesan (killed the sweetness a little). Also added a pinch of fresh ground nutmeg just because. Delicious and easy dessert. Did take longer to cook than expected but my dish was round rather than oval and I think it ended up a little thicker. Longer time makes sense.

I did cook this in a frozen cast iron skillet as some other sites have suggested.  The result is a fluffier clafoutis.  I love ChefJohn other than when he talks...talks...talks.  I just want the meat of the recipe.  Period.

LOVED this Super easy. Whip it up and pour in and cook, cool and eat. Simple, elegant for company, tasty for breakfast. Cold or warm it's really good. I poured a tiny bit of maple syrup on top while still warm from the oven. If you like custard, you will love this!

This is delicious!   A very tasty warm and light dessert.  Came together in just a few minutes too, just long enough for my oven to preheat.  Expect a custard consistency.  I halved the recipe (using 2 eggs), used 1/2 pint blackberries, added some cinnamon and when it was done dusted the top with powdered sugar for looks.

Unfortunately, the dish was removed a couple minutes too soon so the first night we ate the dessert  it was so-so. I put it back in the oven the 2nd night and everyone loved it.  I will definitely make it again. It was almost too easy to make that I felt as if I was cheating.

I only tried this because it was from Chef John and super easy. Never heard of such a thing but it was good. Not overly sweet but still dessert. Mixed reviews from kids because of the texture but I will make it again with other fruit.

I see lots of reviews calling this a dessert, but I made this for breakfast in bed and it was a hit!  Only slightly sweet (nothing like a cobbler, which I was kind of expecting and I'm glad it wasn't!), a small serving was great with coffee, juice and a small dish of yogurt on the side.  Super easy to make, ready just 15 minutes? after the coffee was ready, making it the perfect "l love you" for starting the day.  I'm keeping this recipe in my brunch folder, for sure!  Thanks, Chef John!

I would give it 2 stars, my husband really enjoyed it and gave it 4 stars so I rate it a 3.  The blueberries were great (of course) but other than that, I didn't care for this.  I didn't really know what to expect because I didn't even know what a "clafoutis" was.  Now I know.  It was difficult to judge in the oven for doneness.  Not sure how to explain this correctly, but I almost felt like I was eating a blueberry omelet.  Just not my cup of tea.

Made the exact recipe, except I used turbinado sugar and almond/coconut milk. Came out perfect density and custard flavor so that the fresh blueberries I picked were the star of the dish.

This was my first time making a clafouti and wasn't even sure what it was supposed to taste like. The ingredients were things I had on hand anyway.  I heard that the batter should rest refrigerated for some time to let it settle so after I put it in the blender, I refrigerated it to let it rest.  I made it just as instructed, except I added some lemon zest on top of the blueberries before pouring the batter on.  This was really good. It smelled like a blueberry waffle while cooking, but it's creamier and more of a custard.  I will try again with different fruits. Super easy to make and a nice summer treat.

This is a great dish and really simple.  I used my NutriBullet to mix it.  The only change I made was that I cut the sugar in half and it was plenty sweet (my blueberries were pretty sweet already). I might even cut the sugar to a 1/4 cup next time (which will be soon because it's so good).   I would also oil the bottom of the dish the next time as it stuck to the bottom.

I was looking for a comfort food dessert. This was super quick to make and so delicious. I used frozen boysenberries and substituted 1/2 the flour for almond meal. I cooked it an extra 10 minutes maybe because of the frozen berries. I will definitely be making this again. Yum

I LOVE Clafoutis!  The only thing I changed in this recipe is I substituted Fiori di Scilia for the Vanilla extract for more flavor.  I have also made this using mixed berries - blueberries, blackberries and raspberries.  The possibilities are endless.  Thanks Chef John!

Very easy and delicious.  I will be making this for the holidays.  Thank you for another great recipe.  I only had frozen berries but it turned out great with a little extra time in the oven.

Have had this twice with wild blueberries we picked while hiking.  Used a 9" square pan.  Great brunch item.  Custardy and not too sweet.  Leftovers can be reheated in microwave.

I asked my husband to make this for my birthday breakfast and was glad I did.  He was afraid it wasn't going to set up but it did.  We both agreed it was more dessert than breakfast and needed a scoop of ice cream to make it perfect. We'll save this recipe for a dessert next time and buy some vanilla ice cream. It is very good without but why not indulge when you can.

Very delicious! Making it for a second time right now. Decreased the sugar to half a cup. It was good with 2/3 but I'm sure it'll be as good with 1/2 cup.

Only change I make is to add about 2tbs melted butter...makes it a bit richer. Other than that, it is truly a simple and very delicious recipe and works with almost any fruit.

The taste is fabulous! Mine was runny though:( I baked for the full 30 min. It was starting to burn a bit so was afraid to over cook..The outside of it is delic! Just wish I could have eaten all of it! Lol Will try again for sure! So easy and can tell the full potential! Maybe the rack needs adjusted?? Any suggestions?

Made it twice in one day that is how good it was. My second batch turned out even better i added two tablespoons of cornstarch in the blueberries. I also added a little lemon zest it turned out delicious. I will definitely make it again.

I made the recipe using some cherries and an apple that needed to go. I added a little almond extract in addition to the vanilla. Oh. My. Gosh!! This was so good! Even my 4 year old loved it. I will absolutely make this again.

This is my go to dessert.  Divine with fresh fruit and good with frozen fruit too.  I just made two; fresh blueberry and nectarine.  I laid the unpeeled nectarine slices in a spiral pattern and the result was beautiful.

I used one half cup sugar but otherwise followed recipe exactly. It was great warm, but lovely cold the next day. A really light, fruity custard; can't wait to try recipe with cherries!

It takes me about 2.5 times longer for the mixture to cook, howEVER,  I am doubling the quantities in the recipe, and using a much larger quantity of blueberries, so I know I have to adjust accordingly.  I also replace some of the milk with heavy whipping cream to add some richness to the flavour.  This is a deLICIOUS dessert, breakfast, snack, whatEVER time of day you crave some delicious blueberries in custard.  (I have made it twice with blueberries).  YUUM.  I will likely make many different types of clafoutis going forward.

I didn't make any changes to this recipe.  My husband loved it.  It was not the type of dessert that I typically make, but it was well liked by my kids as well.  If you are looking for something different this recipe may be worth a try.

This was unbelievably simple and really delicious. Used fresh blueberries, gluten free flour, and added 1/2 tps of almond extract along with the vanilla.  Hubby loves this! This is a 'go to' dessert recipe from now on. Thanks Chef John!

Best Blueberry Clafoutis ever. Followed directions with no changes. Even beats Julia Child's clafoutis recipe IMHO. So easy and tasty. Whipped cream topping was delicious, and I can envision  Vanilla Ice Cream or Frozen Yogurt on the side. Yumm

Like nearly all of Chef John's recipes, this was another hit.  I doubled it, which took a little longer-about 15 minutes.  This was a great use for blueberries.  Different than a cake or cobbler and delicious room temp or cold.  Cold with coffee for breakfast or dessert is wonderful.

This is my favorite breakfast recipe.  Quick, easy, and absolutely delicious!   The only changes I make are using ground oatmeal in place of the flour and cutting back the sugar to 1/4 cup.  
I've used both fresh and frozen blueberries.  Though the frozen ones I put in the refrigerator the night before. 
This is a regular dish at my place.

I made it exactly as suggested. We all liked it. I'd maybe lower the temperature a smidge next time and make sure to keep the oven closed while cooking. My concern is the method doesn't let the rise stay. It comes out beautiful and shrinks due to the temperature differential.

Tastes like a custard. I replaced half the milk with heavy cream since another cookbook I have suggested that. I also sprinkled powdered sugar on top prior to serving. Everyone loved it!

This was so easy to make and the results were excellent! The only subsitutions I made was using frozen blueberries (all I had on hand) and heavy cream instead of milk (because I had a lot left over from Christmas baking.) Thank you Chef John!

I wasn't even sure what this was supposed to be, but I thought it looked good so I made it :) I used honey and maple syrup instead of sugar, it was like a very moist dense cake, kind of. But so delicious that it's almost gone in one day!

Simple to make. I added just a touch of nutmeg. This is kind of a cross between a cake and custard.  This will be on the dessert rotation list for sure.

This was absolutely delicious. The texture is hard to describe, but the flavor of the fresh blueberries mixed with the custard-like filling, or crust, or whatever it is, is wonderful - and to be honest, I'm not a big blueberry fan! I used Splenda in place of the sugar and 1 cup of skim milk and 1/4 cup heavy cream (what I had on hand). Turned out perfectly!

Berries in custard, not too sweet.  Probably best served warm,  I haven't had any leftovers to try when chilled.  Consider adding sprinkling of powdered sugar when out of the oven.

This was a perfect summer fruit dessert. Made it with blackberries and served it on whipped cream. So good. Thanks again, Chef John.

My first time making and tasting a clafoutis. It's super easy and simple and my husband loves it. Easy way to use fruit that you may have sitting around. I thought it tasted similar to a crepe (the recipe is pretty much the same). Thank you chef John!

OMG!  Sooooo good. Reminds me of Byrds custard from England with a very lite sponge crust. Perfect for blueberries.

Great easy peasy recipe. I live on a blueberry farm and right now they are rockin fresh out of the field. I rarely change recipes from Chef John as he is my hero. I made this the first time, staying true to the recipe. I don't eat a great deal of sugar, but the 2/3 cup sugar in this recipe blew my doors off! Next time, I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup plus 1 Tablespoon and it was right for me. Left the rest of the recipe the same.

Wow! This is awesome. It's like custard and a blueberry muffin had a baby! I followed the recipe exactly except not quite a full tablespoon of vanilla becaue that seemed to be a very generous amount.

Delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.  Here's a point of culinary trivia: Clafoutis is ONLY made with black cherries.  If you use any other fruit, including red cherries, it is a "flaugnarde".  Loved the prominent vanilla flavor along with the blueberry.  So easy to make, even after coming home from work, to have for dinner that night.

Made this, and served with ice cream for 3 kids. They all had seconds, and ate 3/4 of the pan themselves! This reminds me of an impossible pie but with blueberries. So if you like the "egginess" of impossible pie, as I do, this will not be too eggy. I will be sure to make this every year during blueberry season!

PERFECT !! DELISH...easy to prepare, many possible variations. I also made this using 1/2 c sugar, egg beaters and sprayed the pan w/canola oil...baked 5 min. longer. Did this for personal health reasons...and....it is still DELISH !!!!!!
9/3/14 Have only had this recipe for a short time & have already made it 4 times. With blueberries, peaches, pineapple & raisins. Next will try pineapple w/a sprinkle of coconut and one with precooked rice/raisin & a pinch of nutmeg. When using the pineapple I use 2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp rum extract. SHOUT OUT; CHEF JOHN.....How long would I bake a double or triple batch ???  THIS IS THE BEST DESSERT EVER, thank u Chef John!!

Super nice! very light and so easy to make. I can't stop eating from it. The only change I made is using raspberries instead of blackberries.

Not very flavorful.  It is super simple to make, though, so I will try again, maybe adding some cinnamon and cooking a little longer to get more "crust" on top.
