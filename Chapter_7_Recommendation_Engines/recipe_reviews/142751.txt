My wife (German) and I eat this style potato salad very often. She makes it with fresh green onions chopped very fine  and a vinegar and oil dressing. No Mayo. My favorite.

The recipe is fine albeit a bit bland.  My problem with it is the misleading title.  There is really nothing German about this potato salad except the potatoes.  Traditional German potato salad has bacon, celery seed and vinegar.  Definitely no mayo or cukes.  Still, it was good.   Just needed a little something extra.  I do like the concept of the cucumbers.

This just didn't have enough flavor for me.  I made this early in the day, put in the fridge, and when served with dinner, the cukes had released so much water that the dressing was soupy...we didn't eat it.  Sorry for the bad review, but I think I'll stick with mayonnaise potato salad and the vinegar/bacon version for German potato salad.

1 made german style potatoes salad quite often i read the recipe and all the comments. About the recipe i could say that it is much more efficient to peel and slice the potatoes before boiling then that after. 

if you do it before, you can slice them as thin as you want. if you do it after, you will have to make large slices because they will break if you try to make thin ones

however, be careful not to over cook them so that they wont take too much water inside. If you missed that, you can dry them a bit inside an oven.

i dont think that ising a cucumber will bring up the acidity that this recipe needs. Better use pickles (the sweet and sour recipe).

the chopped green onions vinagrette inside would give a great taste. This is also what i would use to spice a rollmops and potatoes salad, but it is not what usually flavours the "kartoffeln salat" you indeed need something that is between a mayonnaise and a salad cream. the mayonnaise is too hard and the salad cream is too liquid. This definately drives you to make your own dressing on a mayonnaise style (a yellow of egg, a tiny drip of mustard, a tiny drop of salt and pepper, a tiny drop of vinegat or lemon juice a tiny drop of sugar ; you mix all this and then you add progressively the neutral oil until you get the consistance and taste that you want.- beware about the tiny drops : its more easy to add a drop that to remove it - beware also that this home made dressing sauce must be kept cole and eaten very quick)

Not the best, I use potatoes, mayo, salt, pepper, sweet salad cubes, boiled eggs and celery, green onions. Now that's potatoe salad
