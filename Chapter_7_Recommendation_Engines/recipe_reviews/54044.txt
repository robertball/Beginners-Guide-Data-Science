I just made this recipe yesterday for my roommate and myself and it was delicious!  At first taste I could really taste the wine but then throughout the meal the wine flavor faded into the entire flavor of the soup.  My roommate and I both came to the conclusion that this would make a nice dessert or would have to be placed with a well planned meal that would compliment the sweet flavor of the soup itself.  I mentioned that I would like to peal the peaches next time but my roommate disagreed, he liked having something to chew.  My advice is, if you like chewing your soup leave the peal, if not definitely peal the peaches.  I am really looking forward to making this recipe again!

This is definitely peach season in New Jersey and couldn't pass them up in the Farmer's Market - peaches are my guys downfall!!!  Tried this and it was delicious - the schnapps and wine definitely kicked it up a notch.  I think we got a slight buzz off the soup!  For newbie cooks - you definitely have to peel the peaches.  Very simple - boil a large pot of water - drop in the peaches for a minute or two.  Immediately put them in ice water for a few minutes.  The skin comes RIGHT off.  It is quick.  Thanks submitter - I brought this soup to the office for lunch-I know it is going to make me smile!!!

I made this soup for a dinner party of 8 people, and it was absolutely wonderful. I used it as a DESSERT soup. I baked an Amaretto Peach Cheesecake and served with it. I noticed some of my guest were dipping a bite of cheesecake into the soup, then everyone started doing the same. It is fantastic!!! Thank you JDVMD. You must be a great cook.

Super yummy.  The Schnapps adds just the right peachy sweetness and the spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, and mint) made it taste like a peach cobbler soup.  Thanks!

Very good for a summer night.  May need another fruit to round it out.  Maybe mango.

Amazing cold soup. My husband loves cold soups in the summer, so I tried this.  I hate it when people start substituting, but I used what I had on hand.  My half' half had soured, so I had to use milk.  Was out of the spices, so I used cardamom.  I added a couple of Tbsp of plain Greek yogurt just for  a little body.  This was phenomenal!  I'll make it again next week for my birthday club, and I might just use milk because it was very rich, and it's always good to save some calories.  garnished  with a dollop of plain Greek yogurt  and  mint leaf.  Definitely a keeper, thanks for sharing!

It always amazes me the number of folks you have "Never  thought of fruit soup."  Surprise and awe them.
