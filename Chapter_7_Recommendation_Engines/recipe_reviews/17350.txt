Awesome! I wanted to eat all of them.  I baked the poppers for 15 minutes at 350 to decrease the fat.  I also used breadcrumbs instead of cereal for the outer coating.  Way easier then I thought they would be.

Great recipe! I had an abundance of banana peppers from a friend's garden and used the same recipe for them! Turned out great. Also, I baked them at 375 degrees for 15-20 minutes instead of frying them to cut the fat.

Maybe it's just me, but I could NOT get the crushed cornflakes to work with this.  Instead, I used store bought bread crumbs and they turned out very good.  Be warned, this is time consuming and messy.  Also, be sure to chill the poppers long enough that the cheese is nice and firm.

I love this popper recipe better than any other poppers I have had before.  I used fresh jalapenos from the garden.  I love the use of cream cheese and cheddar cheese.
