This is wonderful served w/ mashed potatos, I used boneless beef ribs which worked great and were much leaner than short ribs.

This was great!  I used vege buillion on hand so I used that instead of beef buillion.  After cooking I threw them on the BBQ for a few minutes.  They were a hit!

This was very good.  I served it with Texas toast, buttered noodles and a green salad.

I'm use to short ribs in a brown gravy  not BBQ. Although, anything is great in the crock pot! As others stated, the gravy over mashed potatoes is really good.  Will make again.

I had a very hectic day planned wtih 2 bday parties as well as hubby pulling his back out so i wanted something i could throw inthe crock pot and go, what a treat this was, my sons age 4 and 5 LOVED this they even asked for 2nd ( that is a rareity in this house....lol) the only thing i changed was i did not brown them first and i added just a little of molassas, since i did not have enough bbq sauce, i did put a chicken breat in with this and it was awesome, they even asked for this for leftovers tomorrow night (thank you thank you ) hubby even liked it and raved about it 
definalty will make  again and will pass the recipe around to others who like quick good meals
