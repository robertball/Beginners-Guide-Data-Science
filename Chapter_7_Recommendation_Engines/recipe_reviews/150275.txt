Very delicious! I tried this, didn't have any chillies so I used hot pepper, I also kicked up the yogurt to 2 tbsps instead of 1 as well as the ginger garlic paste. I seasoned my chicken "twice". Basically I seasoned it turmeric, chilli powder, salt and about 3 tablespoons of ginger-garlic paste and allowed it to sit overnight; then on the day I was gonna prepare it, I made the marinade as per the instructions with the exceptions noted above and let it soak for about 4 hours. I added some cumin seeds before the onions, then basically followed the instructions.

This was delicious. Even my father, who highly prefers traditional Punjabi cuisine, enjoyed this chicken and had seconds. Note: I had to add a few tablespoons of water towards the end, as the chicken was not fully cooked and was beginning to stick to the pan. Also added a pinch more salt and cilantro for extra flavor. Marinating over night helped too. So easy! A definite keeper :) Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe is quite easy and has great flavor.  I would recommend marinating the chicken overnight for a fuller flavor.  Tasted great with potato/peas/onion side dish with cumin and garlic.  Will make this one again.

I used boneless chicken thigh, marinated 24 hours, we loved the taste! I did have a difficult time preparing the marinade in a blender, it was too dry for the ingredients to become a paste w/o adding more yogurt. Next time I'll try using a food processor instead.

Fantastic recipe - a definite keeper! I used red bell pepper (with the seeds) instead of a green chile pepper (only because red were on special!) and the taste was quite good. I also ended up adding a bit more salt to the chicken whilst cooking. My Indian friend gave it an 8/10! Will definitely be making this again!

I made this with skinless bone-in thighs. I didn't bother pureeing the marinade/sauce - just diced it up really finely, and added a little more yogurt. This turned out very tender and flavorful. A super quick, easy and inexpensive meal. Thanks!

It is spicy and good.  Everything came out just as it should.  I just do not think I would make for my toddler and manly man again.  It just did not suit our taste.  He did not say he did not like it, but he did not say he did either......  He is just grateful to have a wife to make dinner for him and did not want to sound ungrateful..

Very delicious recipe.  I fried the onions light golden brown.  Will add it to my family recipe book collection.  Thanks

We really liked it.  I followed the recipe - only I was in a hurry and only marinated it for an hour.  Since it cooks in the marinate, I don't think this made that much of a difference.  My finished chicken was a beautiful jalapeno green color.  Wonderful taste and not as spicy as I expected it to be.

I've made this recipe over 50 times in the last two years. Instead of drumsticks, I use chicken thighs chopped into chunks.

The heat and flavor of this dish is absolutely perfect for a cold day. Be warned, it is a bit spicy, so if you're not acclimated appropriately, you might experience the 'ring of fire' the next day ;)

Personally, I make this with a side of garlic naan and also cinnamon/bay leaf jasmine rice. I keep a small side bowl of yogurt to cool down the mouth when needed.

I actually created an account explicitly to review this recipe. Yes, it is that good!

Thank you so much for sharing! This was amazing.  I followed everything but used boneless chicken thighs and it was perfect.  
There is a restaurant not so near that we travel for this dish monthly and now we don't need to go.

I really loved this. I added more salt when it was almost done cooking. I also added some lemon juice. It was delicious!
