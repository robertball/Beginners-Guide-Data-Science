This was dinner tonight. I used organic black beans instady of chili beans and I added one batch of homemade taco seasoning to my taco meat. I did not add the extra salt. I used chili-cheese Fritos. I mixed a half cup each of reduced fat sour cream and a half cup of homemade salsa to make a quick "dressing" for the top of the salad.  I've got mine in Tupperware to take to work but the boys are going to town on theirs.

Not sure why others rated this only four stars.  It is a quick age old Taco salad recipe.  It contains all of the necessary ingredients and is perfect for the shopping list.  To make it more kids friendly, drop the onion and pepper.  To spice it up, throw in a envelope of taco seasoning.  I really enjoyed this and so did my children!  Thanks for taking the time to share it.

If you want to serve it "fancy", toast/bake a couple of tortilla shells over tortilla molds OR shape them over a small coffee can or bowl.  Then, of course, skip the corn chips.  I prefer green olives so I skip the ripe ones.  When I don't have tomato and/or green pepper on hand, I'll put a dab of salsa on the cheese.  This is good with dabbing sour cream on top of the beef mixture.  As a Senior living alone, I do this when I want to share with a neighbor, or having a guest for lunch/dinner.  Actually, sometimes I do it just for me, too.  LOL

Sometimes I substitute Hormel chili with meat for the hamburger mixed with chili beans.  That's for the times I've forgotten to take the hamburger out of the freezer!  LOL  Use amounts of corn chips, lettuce, and cheese to your liking, (or what you have on hand).

I've been making this recipe for years, with a few changes though. I add a can of pinto beans instead of chili beans and I add about a half of a pkg of taco seasoning, about 2/3 of a bottle of WISHBONE RUSSIAN dressing and a few drops of tobasco sauce (to taste)Then I use crushed Doritos (try the sweet chili flavored - really good flavor!) sharp cheddar cheese, shredded lettuce and diced tomato.  I don't like olives so i leave those out. Also good to add some taco sauce and a dallop of sour cream on top! My family LOVES this recipe!

Delicious! This is perfect for a quick and easy weeknight meal! I used a pound of gound beef seasoned with "Taco Seasoning" by Taste of Home Test Kitchen from this site and sauteed it with the green pepper and onion.  I drained the chili beans and added them to the salad cold.  I also used tortilla chips instead of corn chips and added some avocado slices and a dolllup of sour cream. I did feel this needed a dressing, so I used "Smoked Paprika Vinaigrette" from this site.  Overall, very tasty!

Loved it. We actually had leftover taco meat mixture, a little spanish rice too. So I used those as the base. Great, easy recipe

This was desperate for some seasoning in the meat. I thought I would try it this way first but as I suspected it was just a wee bit bland. Easily corrected by adding in some taco seasoning to the meat, which I did tonight. It was yummy.

We thought this recipe was great and super easy!  We were bored with our traditional tacos and burritos and found this recipe to be a step up!  Light and delicious and easy on time!

Excellent recipe as is, but I did change some to give it a more taco-like flavor.   I added a dash or two of cayenne pepper and a couple shakes of black pepper.   I also added in about an 1/8 of a teaspoon of cumin.   Lacking chips, I opted for a soft shell taco and this was excellent.   I will definitely make again.  ***Update***   My better half was not here when I made this, but she had it as leftovers the next day.   She is a bit of a taco salad fan, perhaps even fanatic.  She said that this was the best she has ever had, and we've had zillions.   We served this over Nacho Cheese Doritos chips on day 2.   One side note:   I feel this recipe serves more than 2.   More like 3 or 4.   Thanks!

Holy Frijoles!  This was AWESOME!!!!  We made this last night (had to make it in 2 batches because my husband doesn't like onions, peppers, or olives - my batch had everything), but instead of the salt, we used Penzeys Spices Original Taco Seasoning.  Oh, and my husband was a little over-zealous with his cheese grating, so we ended up with a little over a cup of cheese for each batch, but it just made it that much better.  This is going to become a family favorite!
