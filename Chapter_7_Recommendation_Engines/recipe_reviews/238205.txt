This was good! NOTE: Try not to make this too far in advance b/c it does get super watery. Great flavor combo, and I agree that this would be awesome served on top of fish tacos. I plan to try this that way next time, as I just served this a a side to chicken sandwiches tonight. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I sort of created my own on this recipe using done and adding others; added white onion instead of green, added a little sour cream, added fresh squeezed lime! Very good!

This was really good.  I didn't have a mango, but I did have some mango juice.  I added about a Tbls of the juice and it came out delicious!

Really good. I switched out mango with crushed pineapple and added crushed red pepper. Was great for a party and fish taco bar.

I made this salad for a family party; everyone loved it. As a previous reviewer mentioned, this salad is very watery. You start off with a large bowl of cabbage and over time, moisture is emitted from the cabbage as it ferments. So the size of the salad reduces quite bit. I did not have mangos, so I added mandarin oranges. Although I added the fruit at the very end, this probably added to the moisture also. All in all this is a very tasty salad and I will definitely make it again.

My friend made this recipe twice and I loved it. I just marinated the shredded cabbage in the dressing, for an hour and then tossed in the other ingredients. I love the fresh cilantro zing.

Love this -  I used rice wine vinegar instead of white vinegar, 2T of greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise, and chopped red onion instead of green. For the oil I used 1T MCT and 1T avocado. I also used 1T of Coconut Aminos instead of honey. It marinated well - and not at all runny.

This is amazing! I can’t wait to make it this summer. Very light and refreshing. I made the dressing just as the record for. I did add sliced red peppers and I substituted chunked pineapple because I didn’t have a mango.

This is great! I've made it several times. I think I like using cider vinegar better than white wine, but either way it's a great side that takes just a few minutes to prepare. 

Try it with Jerk Chicken.

I made this with the mayo, celery seed, celery salt, cilantro, onions, pepper, cabbage and because this is what I had, I used a can of diced mango in syrup and I put some of the sweet syrup into the mix and it was delicious.  We even had some the next day, just scoop it out of the liquid and it's still good and crunchy.

So good with with pan fried cod and homemade pico wrapped in a flour tortilla. I used two kinds of cabbage instead of the pre-packaged type and omitted the celery, poppy, and green onion.

Love this!  The dressing is a nice combination of mayo and vinegar and the mango, cilantro and green onion taste perfect with it!  Definitely don't let it sit for too long as it does get watery.  I served it with pulled BBQ chicken sandwiches and it was delicious!

Great pairing with fried fish.  Was a bit too tart for my taste, so will try replacing 1 Tbsp vinegar with mayo next time

Delicious!  Made exactly as called for and it was perfect.  Paired with Chef John's crab cakes and it was a huge hit.

great stuff, have used it on fish tacos and pulled pork sandwiches.  I always sub a couple of drained mango fruit cups since I can't ever find fresh.
