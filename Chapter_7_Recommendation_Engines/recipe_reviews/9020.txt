I make this all the time!  I do however use bottled italian dressing in place of the vinegar, oil and dry dressing mix.  And I've learned to make sure it's drained well before cooking.  I also marinate mine overnight soemtimes, and it tastes even better!

I REALLY LOVED THESE BUT I DIDNT QUITE FOLLOW THE RECIPE...INSTEAD OF USING OIL AND VINEGAR I USED FAT FREE ITALIAN DRESSING AND ADDED A THING OF ITALIAN DRESSING DRY MIX TO IT. PLUS I DIDNT MEASURE THE LIME JUICE..I JUST SQUEEZED ONE LIME IN AND ADDED A LITTLE BIT OF SUGAR. THE TANG WAS YUMMY. THIS WILL BE MY FAJITA RECIPE FROM NOW ON, BUT SWITHCED A BIT TO MAKE IT LOWER IN FAT.

This was a great recipe.  I made it for my daughter's birthday party-25 people!!  It was a big hit.  I was even asked for the recipe.  I served salsa, shredded cheese, tomatoes, sour cream and Spanish Rice.  Everyone fixed them however they wanted.  Because I did make it for more than the recipe called for(number of servings), it had a lot of liquid.  If I make it for a big crowd again, I will not add so much liquid.  You should try this one- it is a keeper!!

I made this for a fajita cook-off that I did. And it won! Also I grilled them instead of cooking them. I will be making these again!

The flavor is very different from the normal fajita taste, but it's very good.  If you like lime and italian dressing go for it.  It doesn't take very long to make.  We forgot to marinate the chicken before hand but it still turned out good.  Make some guac to go with it!

This was ok...it was definitely easy and quick, but the vinegar overpowered the dish.  Would make again, but maybe with less vinegar.

This is spectacular!  Use 6 inch tortillas instead of 10 inch or the whole thing falls apart.  I passed this one on to others.

Yummy!  However, it's probably not for people who are looking for a spicier traditional Mexican fajita... this is more of a summery grill dish.  I served with refried beans, mexican rice, cheese, sour cream, and tortillas.  Delicious!

Fantastic!  I did make a couple of changes.  Halved the recipe and used one chicken breast for just hubby and me.  I juiced and zested one lime for the marinade and added some red pepper flakes.  Used red, yellow and orange mini-peppers (what I usually have on hand-yum! I don't care much for green), doubled the onion, added some thinly sliced garlic.  I reserved a bit of the marinade before adding the rest to very thinly sliced chicken.  Marinated (just the chicken) an hour and a half. Sauteed veggied, set aside then sauteed drained chicken. Deglazed with a splash of Jose Cuervo. Added veggies back in and added reserved marinade.  cooked a few more minutes.  served with sour cream, salsa, cheese, and avocado slices.  DELISH!!!  Will make this one again, no doubt about it!  thanks for the tasty recipe!

Delicious fajitas that are much different from regular fajitas served in restaurants.  Definitely make sure you drain the marinade as you transfer the chicken and veg mix out of the bowl.  I followed the recipe as stated and didn't have any problems with the flavor.  Very simple!

These were good.  I did choose to use the bottled dressing instead and they did turn out good and very simple, just needed a little something I couldn't put my finger on (maybe a hot pepper, or pepper flakes?), but I topped them with a lettuce/fresh cilantro mix, a bit of sour cream and it made them even better.  I used this for steak, pork and chicken.

I thought this was really good- the vegetables were really tangy, which I liked. My husband liked it too, though he wasn't quite as enthusiastic! I would definitely make again.

This was SO good!! I didn't have the dry dressing mix, so I just used bottled Italian dressing and added the vinegar and lime to it. The lime adds so much to it, this is a new favorite at our house!

This is a yummy recipe. Got it out of my new Allrecipes cookbook! I will make these again, but next time add a red bell pepper and use a tad less italian dressing. We thought the italian flavor was a little too overpowering.

Awesome!  Fresh, tangy, delicious!  I cooked it a hot wok.  Instead of marinating a yellow onion, I used freshly sliced green onion as garnish.  Sour cream seasoned with chopped basil was a lovely dressing, as was the fresh mozzarella I served on the side.  There's lots of room for creativity here.  Maybe a little feta and kalamata olives in a spinach wrap?  mmmmmmmm :-)

Doesn't taste like the restaurant fajitas, but the family ate it all - much more sweet and tangy than spicy.

Excellent fajitas!  I left out the bell pepper because I don't care for them, but otherwise followed the recipe.  My husband loved these and they were simple to prepare.  Needless to say, I'll be making these again!

We love the flavor of these fajitas.  Tangy is the right description.  Because the chicken, onions, and bell peppers are so flavorful, they don't need to be served with many fajita toppings.  We usually just make a guacamole and serve with flour or corn tortillas.

I was really worried about the way this tasted when I tasted a piece of chicken from the pan, but after it cooked a little longer it turned out delicious! It did taste too much like vinegar in the beginning, but I cooked it for about 20 minutes so that vinegar taste went away and the chicken was lovely. Served it in tortillas with rice, tomatoes and beans.

I love this fajita recipe! It is so quick and easy. I do make several adjustments to it though.  I think 3 chicken breasts is not nearly enough for the amount of marinade.  I put a whole family pack of chicken breasts in and then I marinate them all day, or even overnight, the longer the better.  After they are done marinating, I put the chicken with all the marinade into a skillet (or two) and cook it until the liquid is gone and the chicken is cooked through.  If you don't want to do a whole family pack of chicken, do at least 5-6 breasts and drain off some of the liquid before cooking it.  We serve this on whole wheat tortillas with brown rice, black beans, sour cream, salsa, and sometimes cheese. Fantastic recipe!

The only thing I changed was adding less vinegar.  I'm not sure if this affected the taste in this way, but it was a bit "limey."  So, when I make again, I'll use a bit less lime.  Otherwise, great taste and recipe.  I made these and put them in warmed tortilla with cheese, sour cream and home made guacamole. I halved the recipe but I wish I hadn't.  We all wanted more after the two we ate!

Loved the simplicity of this fajita recipe.  I did not have the ingredients for my much more complex fav. recipe, so I looked for something on allrecipes. Really liked the tangy flavor.  Will definitely keep this recipe around.

I have made this twice now and both times it was a hit.  Great if you have company who don't like anything spicey also.

This tastes great!  I made it for our tailgate party and everyone liked it.  The chicken was nice and juicy, with lots of flavor.  I added a 1/4 tsp of cumin and a tablespoon of minced onions, cilantro, and jalapeno.  Don't know if that added to the flavor, since it was such a small amount.  But it turned out really good!

Excellent flavor.  Grilled the chicken outdoors after marinading.  Added a dash of McCormick's Santa Fe spice blend to give it some heat.  VERY GOOD!

Oh wow! were these excellent fajitas.  My mouth waters just thinking about them.  Easy to prepare (took a bit to cut up the chicken, but otherwise effortless), the meat smelled so delicious when cooking, and the fajitas were heavenly.  The lime juice and Italian dressing mix really made them tangy, but not in an overwhelming way.  I plan on making this often in the future!

I really liked this. I like the different flavor from the normal fajita flavor. The leftovers on top of salad made for a nice light lunch. It was perfect on a hot day.

Love love love this recipe!  Have been making it for a couple years just as written.  It is always delicious.  The only thing I do different is I cook the mixture in the marinade and use bottled lime juice if I don't have fresh.  I usually marinate the stuff as it says but have also just cooked it in the marinade if I was looking for a quick dinner!  I always serve it with guacamole and chips!  Yummy!!!!!

These were absolutely delicious, not too vinegary as I thought it might be.  With sour cream and homemade salsa, it was just heavenly.  Now I just need to find a recipe for what goes in a packet of Italian dressing mix and this would be even cheaper and something I could easily make with what I have in the kitchen!

I have tried to make Fajitas many times and this is by far the best. My time management was a little off and the marinate only sat for almost an hour. I did forget to marinate the pepper and onion with the chicken but it all turned out well. Everyone in the house enjoyed these fajitas. They were served on a tortilla with only cheddar cheese and green Tabasco. Fresh Strawberry Margarettas (virgins for the kiddos) were a great addition to the tang.

Interesting twist to fajitas, I have to admit I didn't follow the exact recipe: I replaced the dressing mix, oil and vinegar with Italian dressing (Newman's Own low-fat).  Used extra lime, let marinate for about 8 hours.  Definitely very tangy (and tasty)!

This was awesome with the Spanish Rice II recipe.  We chopped up the chicken and put the spanish rice with it on a burrito with some other toppings (lettuce, tomato, sour cream, taco sauce).  My kids aboslutely loved it, and my husband commented that it was like Chipotle at home.

These are incredibly easy, and absolutely delicious!!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, using a little less vinegar per some reviewers' requests.  I removed everything from the marinade to cook, and about half way through the cooking process, I drained the excess liquid and then finished cooking.  This will be my new chicken fajita recipe for sure.  Thanks!

Yummy!  Like others suggested, I used Italian salad dressing in place of the olive oil and vinegar.  We grilled our chicken and it tasted just like something you would get from a restaurant.

This was the first time I ever made Fajitas that didn't come from a box and they turned out better than I could have imagined.  I used bottled Italian dressing and juice from one lemon (I didn't have a lime) and grilled the chicken instead of cooking in the pan.  The grilled flavor and tangyness were excellent.  I will definitely be making these again.

There used to be a Mexican restaurant called Chi-Chi's - I used to love their fajitas - nobody made fajitas like they did - until now.  These are the best fajitas I've had in a long time.  I make them inn a cast-iron grill pan. Yum.

Totally addictive. Love the tangy flavor. Also tried it with ground beef
and turned out to be very salty but mixed with rice, it turned out good as
well.  I couldn't put my spoon down.. kept reaching for the tangy chicken/beef.

Pretty good and fairly easy, although I marinated the chicken for 24 hours...my mistake, instead of 3-6, and it came out too tangy!

I thought this recipe was good, but I prefer traditional chicken fajitas. I might use this again just as a marinade for whole boneless, skinless breasts to grill.

This is my family's favorite recipe.  It is so good we would eat it every day if we could.  It's great with sour cream.

I love these fajitas not only for their awesome flavour, but also for their ease and convenience.  I make this quite often (something I don't usually do with recipes as I love trying new things) but it's just so convenient to prep the ingredients, let them marinate overnight, and cook the next day.  I will eat them for dinner for about 3 days in a row (I'm very busy and don't have time to cook every day) and still don't get tired of them! I pretty much double the peppers and onions and add fresh mushrooms.  I usually add refried beans and sliced avocado to the fajitas.  I once started eating these in a room full of people and they asked "where did you get those?" thinking they were leftover from a restaurant because they smelled so good!  I think it's a good idea to cook the veggies for a few minutes before adding the chicken since veggies take longer to cook and I tend to overcook the chicken when I add everything to the pan together, waiting for the peppers to cook.  Anyway, these are amazing and very importantly, HEALTHY!!!  I love the vinegary-ness of it (vinegar is a great way to add flavour without adding salt or sugar), despite another viewer's comments.  Please enjoy!! :)  Thanks for sharing!

when you put the chicken in the pan to fry it, make sure its dry, otherwise there is too much liquid and it doesnt fry, it boils.

I love the take of vinegar and lime and the combination together is awesome! The smell is over powering when cooking but the taste is great.  Instead of using the seasoning they recommended, I just used Goya Chicken and it came out wonderful.  I made this twice and it was a hit both times!

These were fairly good.  Unlike other reviewers, I made them exactly as the recipe called (I didn't use just Italian dressing).  They turned out good, just not what you expect when you have fajitas.  I would make them again though.

So delicious! Did use bottled Italian dressing and it worked out great.  My husband put hot sauce on his since he likes extra zing and he couldn't get enough.

I'm so glad to have a new family favorite!  I made the following changes: I used red bell peppers instead of green. After marinating, I drained the chicken, onions and peppers on paper towels, then stir-fried it in one tablespoon vegetable oil. I removed the chicken and fried the onions and peppers. I added the chicken back into the pan, and then I sprinkled on about 1/3 packet of fajita seasoning and added 1/4 cup water. I served it on flour tortillas with sour cream and avocado slices.  It was wonderful! My husband asked me if I had grilled the meat, which was a silly question, since we don't have a grill!! With the extra chicken and tortillas, I made chicken quesadillas the next night by lightly shredding the chicken in a food processor.

Excellent and easy recipe! I dusted the chicken with cumin and garlic salt, cut into strips and added them to the vegies. I let it marinate for six hours and cooked it on a cast iron grill pad on the grill. Very good... thanks.

I really loved this recipe. I did make a few changes though. I seasoned the meat directly with about 1 tsp. of cumman and 1 tsp. of garlic salt. Instead of using the oil, vinagar, and dry seasoning, I just used Italian salad dressing. The lime was a great touch.  I then cooked it on my George Forman grill. It only took about 5 mins to grill. This is going to be one of our regulars!

Easy and quick marinade!  The only thing I did was reduce the lime juice to 1/4 cup so it wasn't too overpowering and added a red bell pepper along with the green one.  

I poked holes in the chicken breasts to allow the marinade to soak in better and then threw the chicken and cut up veggies into a ziplock bag.

When we were ready to go, I emptied everything into a strainer - took out the chicken and my husband grilled it on the BBQ while I sauteed the veggies.  

Served with:  avocado & sour cream on the side -- SO DANG GOOD!  We also had a bean/corn salsa which I hope to add to this site.  I'll call it Brooke's Bean & Corn Salsa.

This has become a favorite at our house.  I make it with 2 red and 2 green bell peppers, and I've been using sushi vinegar.  I usually cook up however much we need in batches over a few days.  We serve it with whole wheat tortillas, sour cream, and shredded cheese.  If I have it, we also sprinkle cilantro.  Even my 18 month old daughter likes this recipe!

This was absolutely delicious! I do, however, reccomend bringing down the lime to 1/2 or 3/4 of it's original quantity otherwise lime is all you taste.

Well it was tangy. It kind of tasted like the Hint of Lime chips that you can get. That was what the flavor was like. I subbed apple cider vinagar and used the italian dressing recipe on this site for the packets. It was ok but it was extremely tangy for me!

I love Fajitas, and this recipe was good. It's just not worth the two packs of italian seasoning. I marinated it for 3 hours and it had a tangy flavor, but just wasn't 5 stars.

I really loved this marinade. I used Flank steak and it was sooo good! I read other reviews and decided to reduce the amount of vinegar and use Seasoned vinegar instead (sushi vinegar) It has a great flavor, a little on the sweeter side than the distilled. I would definetly use this again! I recommend Flank steak highly and dont forget to slice against the grain.Thats So important.

The chicken had great flavor but didn't taste much different than any other fajita seasoning I've used. I thought it was tasty but nothing special.

This was really good.  I made it while on a camping trip.  I did not really drain the marinade like I should have and it ended up in a sort of soupy mix at the bottom of a big pot on a camp stove...in other words I almost boiled it in the marinade that I did not drain completely.  It actually turned out great that way - believe it or not!  We all all the trimmings and the fajitas were great!  I used all the vinegar called for and I liked the spicy tangy flavor.

These are the best chicken fajitas I have ever had, even better than my favorite mexican restaurant's.  I left out both the oil and vinegar and added some mushrooms the last few minutes of cooking.

I wanted to like it..really I did. But the vinegar overpowered; pungent rather than spicy. I would not make this again. I continue my search for the ultimate chicken fajitas.

This was excellent! I had had a food day in my spanish class, and had made this. The kids who had it said it was outstanding. They even asked for the recipe! I mad it the night before and put it in a slow cooker along with the maranide to keep it moise. I brought it in that morning, and by the time we had class, it was perfect! I also made it for my family and we greatly enjoyed it! Thanks for sharing this recipe with us!

These fajitas are amazing.  I made them last week for my mom and she couldn't stop talking about them so I am making them for her again tonight.  I added a little light done right Italian dressing along with the packaged seasoning and I used some lemon juice instead of lime because I didn't have lime.  Thanks for posting this recipe; it is delicious!!

Pretty tasty fajitas.  I marinated this one night to serve the next (don't have time to marinate something for 6 hours once I get home from work) and it turned out delicious. Served with some Spanish rice, salsa, and sour cream.  Quick, easy, and delicious dinner.

Good fajita recipe, but not my favorite.  I won't use this again because have others that my family prefers.  This is a good recipe however and would make it only if didn't have ingredients for other fajita recipes.  Was very easy and quick however!

Excellent but I made it with the Italian dressing like many people suggested!  I used regular yellow onions, red and yellow peppers.  I used a rotisserie chicken for the meat.  Thank you for this recipe!  I will make it again!

This was delicious!  I served over the black bean quinoa recipe from this site and I ate mine like a burrito bowl.  I cheated and used frozen chopped onion and frozen chop green pepper and then marinated it all over night.  My 10 year old asked me to please tell him I would be making this again!  So it's  keeper!

This is incredible! I had a rotisserie chicken already cooked so I just heated strips in a pan with Italian dressing and lime then used sour cream and cheese on the tortilla. Fabulous.

Delicious and very easy! I will never buy fajita seasoning again. I used 1 cup of Italian dressing in place of the oil, vinegar, and dry dressing mix, and let everything marinate overnight. My chicken cooked faster than my peppers and onions (I should have anticipated this), so next time I will start cooking the peppers and onions before adding the chicken to the pan.

Outstanding!  I made it as the recipe was written with only one change.  I added the juice of one fresh lime, instead of lime juice.  My family gobbled it down.  There were no left-overs!  Thanks for sharing!

This doesn't taste like your typical fajitas.  The marinade tastes more like a pasta salad dressing.  I was a little hesitant about making it when I tasted the marinade but it didn't come out too bad.  I followed the exact recipe but when I tasted it in the pan, I felt like it was missing something so I added a dash of cayenne, salt & cumin. Then I rolled up the chicken in corn tortillas and added cheddar & sour cream.  It was pretty good and it took less than half an hour to make.  I also didn't marinate the chicken.

I used Italian dressing (I didn't realize the recipe called for dry packets until too late) and I used pork (chicken was expensive this week) and still got the WHAT IS THAT AWESOME SMELL?!?! from my 6th grader.  So I'll be making this again with chicken and dry packets for sure.  Thanks very much!

Surprisingly good!  After I cooked the mixture, I tasted it and thought it was going to be just sort of so-so.  When put together with a warm flour tortilla, some cheddar cheese, sour cream and salsa, the flavors popped.  Definitely will make again!  I had a few minor changes, but otherwise made it the exactly the same:  (1.) Cut olive oil to 1/3 cup, (2.) cut vinegar to 1/4 cup and (3.) added some mushrooms.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the meat and veggies needed to be drained several times when cooking.  We all loved these -- even our 3 1/2 year old!  This one will be a new favorite around here.

I used this recipe as a guide but changed it based on others’ suggestions!  Instead of using the oil/vinegar/lime/dressing mixture, I used a bottle of fat-free Italian dressing, juiced two limes and added about ¼ package of dry fajita seasoning.  I also added a dash of paprika, chili powder, seasoning salt and hot sauce to my marinate mixture.  I let it marinate about two and a half hours.  I drained the meat and veggies well and the separated them.  I cooked the veggies in one pan and the chicken in another, both in a little Smart Balance cooking oil.  I sprinkled a little dry fajita seasoning on the chicken while it cooked.  I also had to drain the meat several times while cooking to remove excess juice.  These were amazing!!  I served with red rice, corn niblets, shredded cheese blend, lettuce, tomato and sour cream.  Will definitely have these again!!

These were pretty good. The vinegar was a little overpowering, so next time I will cut that in half. My husband said they reminded him of some of the best fajitas he has ever had back in '95. Thanks for a good recipe!

Wow! These were awesome! I will keep this recipe in the mix for sure! I used zesty  italian dressing mix for a little extra kick and it was great! I only had a few hours to marinate but you wouldn't know it! So flavorful!

This turned out very well - it was so good that I should have made more of it!  Didn't use the vinegar though.  Made it with "Mexican Rice III" for a side dish.

VERY disappointing!  Made this tonight and would say that it's edible...  however the tanginess and vinegar are out of control and far too overpowering.  I suppose if you like to put pickles on everything you eat then you would be very happy with this dish.

Great flavor!! DON'T FORGET TO MARINATE.  I obviously forgot to marinate and it still tasted great.  I still put in the chicken and veggies in the liquid mixture and then put used tongs to transfer chicken/veggies into the skillet.  Due to the liquid, the chicken had great flavor and was very moist.  Now I can't wait to try again and marinate it first!

Best Fajitas I've EVER had- but do not use vinegar!  Subsitute with Italian dressing-this with the dry seasoning and lime juice gives it SO much flavor--if you do not have time to marinade for hours, even 30 mins will do and add juice in the pan.

These were very good!!!  A nice twist to our usual fajitas.  I did however add 1 jalepeno for spice, we couldn't taste it so next time I'll add more.  I did think there were a bit too many veggies to put in the fajita but the amount gave it a good flavor while cooking the meat.  We didn't end up making them the first night that I marinated them so they did marinate overnight, they were strong and good.  My man liked them a lot and so did the picky kids!!!

I marinated the chicken overnight and put a little lime juice on the onions before I sautéed them. The chicken came out very juicy and had a great flavor.

OMG! Two words...YUM-EEE!!! I did do what some of the other reviewers suggested and substituted bottled fat free Itallian dressing for the vinegar and dry mix, etc., but other than that, followed the recipe. My only suggestion is to make way more onion and pepper and you really don't need that much oil to saute' with. The only other thing was that I ended up marinating it for 2 days, due to work. I think it actually helped the flavor soak into the chicken. I made enough for leftovers and have tried it by itself and with sour cream and guac. Either way was great! This is tops on my list of new favorites. Will definitely make again and again. Thanks for a super recipe!

This was almost "pickly".  The vinegar, lime, AND italian dressing was way too acidic.  It needed more balance...

These were good but not phenomenal. I often marinate my chicken in bottled Italian dressing. Not sure this is any better, but I did enjoy the fresh lime juice. Next time I might add a little fresh chopped cilantro to the marinade. I served these with Best Black Beans from this site, Guacamole (from Bob Cody) on this site, sour cream and shredded Cheddar.

I used the bottled Italian dressing as others recommended. I also used a package of frozen stirfry peppers and onions. After everything marinated, I cooked the chicken and veggies on the stovetop in a pan. I served it with salsa, sour cream and shredded cheese (no tortillas since my husband and I limit our carbs). It was FABULOUS! Good enough to serve to company.

Fantastic. Makes me feel like a real chef when I make these :) Make sure you drain them very well b4 cooking and make sure your pan/griddle is VERY HOT when you put them on so that the liquid that is still in it evaporates. You will need to watch it very closely and flip them soon so they don't burn. Turn the heat down soon after you flip them and leave on till done. Definitely go with Best Spanish rice on this site.

This was good not great but good. I need to make it with whole b/s ch. brst. next time on the grill and then slice. I did marinate overnight it seems chicken needs that to grab the test better.

I made this for a family dinner last night. Very good. The only thing I did different was grill the chicken, cut into strips after we took it off the grill,I also grilled the veggies. I used a red and yellow bell pepper. Very good recipe.

I don't know exactly what my spouse did to this recipe but she hit it out of the ballpark. The package of spices was different (it will be fun to experiment here). We didn't use any sour cream. The salsa was delicious ... black beans and corn. We added a tsp of Oriental chili sauce and the "heat" was just right. Without it, it might have been "Bland Chicken Fajitas". I had 3 helpings ... and I'm supposed to be on a diet. We'll see the results tomorrow when I step on the scale. Bottom line ... Delicious !!

I really enjoyed them...a nice change from the typical fajita!  I would probably try adding a bit of spice next time...I enjoyed them a lot but I can not decide whether I like regular style fajitas better than these so by adding a bit of spice I could blend the two, which would probably be pretty awesome!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, marinated everything for 3 hours, and found these to be quite good. They do hold alot of liquid, though, so rather than saute they more or less simmer in their own juices. Still a very good meal with a nice tangy flavor.

This recipe was just ok. The lime chicken soft tacos is much better and you can add onions and bell peppers to it if you want fajitas.

Interesting change from traditional fajitas. My family loved it. Best of all it is EASY to throw together. I only marinated mine for 1 hour and they were still tangy. Next time I will cut the Italian seasoning down like someone else mentioned or use bottled dressing.

This was my first time making fajitas, and this recipie is easy easy!  I love vinegary, tangy strong flavors, so this was perfect for me.  I only used one package of the italian dressing, but I added minced garlic, cracked black pepper, and tons of chili powder since I like it spicy.  I also added chili powder and garlic powder when I sauteed it.  It's a very strong flavor, so you'll definetly want to eat them with the fixin's, sour cream, spanish rice, tortillas, lettuce etc.... but very delicious!

these fajitas were very flavourful and the peppers and onions tasted great in the marinade as well.  i found them a little too tangy for my taste but all in all they were good.l

These were good...even though they tasted more like chicken spiedies than fajitas. We added pineapple chunks to ours.

This is absolutely amazing. I marinated the veggies and chicken all day.  The flavor was great, chicken was moist and tender. I served it with flour tortillas, shredded cheese, salsa, sour cream and guacamole. Definitely a keeper!

These were AWESOME! We added some red peppers and had homemade guacamole to spread inside the fajitas. The guacamole was a little spicy, so the combination of flavours was delicious! I would definitely recommend this fast and easy recipe.

Great fajitas!  I did add a few extras to the marinade: minced garlic, jalapeno, soy sauce and some onion salt.  We grilled the chicken after marinating for a couple of hours.  Stir-fried the veggies until still just crisp.  Served with homemade pico de gallo, sour cream and grated colby-jack cheese.  YUM!

This was WONDERFUL!  My husband and I love traditional fajitas, but this was a great change!  We'll definitely make this again.

These were tangy, zesty and bursting with flavor. Served them with sour cream, salsa, and cheese. Forgot about the onions. It was only 350 degrees outside next to the grill and they just slipped my mind. Just hate Texas summers. I'll make sure not to forget the onions next time.
