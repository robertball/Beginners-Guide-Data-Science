First, I have something to say, and this isn’t even my own recipe.  One reviewer literally changed just about everything in this recipe but, PLEASE, do yourself a favor and tweak after you give this a try at least once, as written.  IMO it’s that good, and I wouldn’t change anything.  That particular reviewer gave it 5 stars, but seriously, she wasn’t reviewing this recipe, only her custom version.  The selection of beans is interesting, eye appealing, and just tasty!  I was a little concerned that the sauce might be too sweet for our taste, but it was the perfect blend.  I love baked beans, have cooked them many different ways (including slow cooked), and I honestly can say that I don’t think I’ve had better!

We served these beans to a crowd of 300 during a western themed theater dinner.  The group was mostly senior citizens.  We received oodles of compliments on the beans (the rest of the meal, too).  We served these with baked ham, sweet potatoes, roasted vegetables, corn bread and biscuits.  Great dinner-great beans.  The staff enjoyed the left overs, too!!

Aren't butter beans and lima beans the same thing, just different names? 
I omitted the pork & beans and added great northern beans with a little paprika and onion powder, added 1/2lb beef, used turbinado sugar instead of brown, no garlic (didn't have any), used bbq sauce instead of ketchup, and dijon mustard instead of dry. Turned out great! I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!
I assembled a day ahead, and cooked the next day on high in the slow cooker for a large gathering. Made dinner a breeze, and was asked for the recipe by many people. great recipe!

Excellent bean casserole.   I added about 1/4 cup of Jim Beam.   I would probably cut back on the vinegar a little next time I make it.   Definitely will make again.

Yes, I have made this. Yes, it was awesome. Like craving it awesome. The comments I got for it were the fact that there were different beans in it and it was so thick and flavorful. 

Really good chow.

Very good.  Reminds me of a recipe I used to make called Calico Beans.  No, butter beans and lima beans are not the same thing. I don't know...maybe one is more 'ripe' than the other.  But they don't look the same.  I did not drain the pork and beans (because they are in sauce, not just beany liquid) but did drain and rinse well the other beans; used frozen for the limas; did not use bacon (only because I need to watch the cholesterol).  Like others, I would cut back on the sugar next time but that is just personal preference.

This recipe is very similar to the recipe that my sister in law's sister gave me over 20 years ago.  Mine/hers is called Crockpot All Day Beans.  Uses 1 can Mexican Red sauce (if you can't find this just use red enchilada sauce) and 1/4 cup Worchester sauce instead of the Ketchup, vinegar and molasses.  Cook in Crockpot on low for 6 to 8 hours.  So much easier and it has a bit of a kick from the red sauce.

I suspect this may be a cultural thing but I found it way too sweet - I find that a lot of American has way more sugar than I would normally eat. (I'm Australian) I would use half or less of the brown sugar and more bacon.

Oh, these were goooood! I used a can of pink beans, black beans and canned baked beans.  I left the remaining ingredient quantities the same.  They were definitely better the next day. Will be making these all summer long!  Thanks scubaLQ.

I have used a similar recipe for years but prefer some bottled BBQ Sauce (such as Kraft) but my family likes the addition of black beans, pinto -- just use a wide variety and people rave for it. cooking grams

My family and I did not really care for this recipe.  It wasn't a horrible dish, it just felt as though something was lacking.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Sorry, I won't be using this one again.

I made the recipe exactly as written and everyone loved it.  We found it a perfect balance of sweet/savory.  I have made many baked bean recipes and this is by far the very best and is one I will make again.

My husband and I really liked this.  I have a recipe for baked beans, and it is awesome, but there are about 25 ingredients, which is just a bit much for me when I just want beans as a side for a simple dinner and not a special occasion.  These fit the bill.  They are made from scratch, except the ketchup (and who makes their own ketchup these days), simple, and very good.  I just used what beans I had, I think kidneys and great northern, and I didn't have pork and beans, but these turned out great anyway.

I followed the recipe, , I have been cooking for 43 years , I am not a picky eater at all, but I really did not like these beans.  If I had used only northern or navy beans, I think they would have been pretty good. Didn't like the lima and butterbeans and I normally love both. Way too much trouble and expense for the end result.

Wow!  This is so delicious!  One of the best baked beans recipes I have ever tried.  The only change I made was to omit the bacon.  I am a vegetarian.   My meat loving husband loved these beans and never even missed the bacon.  This recipe goes into my make again file!

My whole family loves these beans! Depending on what's in my cupboard, the beans may change, but it's always good! We always change out the lima beans though. They are definitely not a family favorite.

I eat this all the time now that I've found the recipe. I am a big fan of molasses, so I add about three times what the recipe calls for, but that's the only difference.

Maybe I did something wrong, but the beans were still pretty hard.  I used pinto, white, and navy beans.  The flavor was great, but I'll have to simmer the beans a little longer to get the tenderness even close to that of a can of baked beans.  Will make again, but try in a crockpot.

I made this as written.  The beans were very good.  They had a little sweet and a little tang.  I eat them hot or cold--just as good either way.

Really liked the taste!  I will definitely make these again.  My only negative was that they were rather dry by the end of the cooking.  Maybe I'll add some more ketchup? or maybe just some water? or maybe cook it less time, like 50 or 60 minutes? or all of the above?  I will definitely be trying something because the flavor is definitely there!

I’ve made this bean recipe many times. The only change I’ve made is swapping out the lima beans for black beans. It’s always a winner. Highly recommend it.

This was great.  I made it for a neighborhood gathering, and two people asked for the recipe.

I did not use the lima beans, though; I used pinto beans instead, and I would recommend that change (or any other kind of bean besides limas).

I've been making a similar recipe for years, a Five Bean Bake.  Mine has a can of cut green beans and a can of cut wax beans instead of the Lima beans.  It's a favorite.  Switch out whatever beans your family loves for one they don't.  Healthy and delicious.

Didn't have four bean mix but used multi bean mix I had and it was very good. Liked the sweet-sour taste it has. I will made again this winter.

I changed kidney beans to pinto beans , used red wine vinegar and blueberry syrup instead of molasses cause that's what I had.  Easy recipe and everybody loved it!

I have tried many baked beans and this one tops everyone. My dish was devoured at the party! I let the beans simmer for around 4 hours until I was ready to put it in my bean pot to take to family dinner.

Perfect just as is. This is really delicious and popular with everyone that tries it. The bean lovers can't get enough and those that think they don't like beans say, "Well, except for that 4 bean thing you make..." Thanks

I browned everything and simmered the sauce with the bacon the day before.  Stirring it into the beans the next day was quick and easy and no frying pan to clean the day I needed the completed  dish.

It went to a pot luck.  Not a bean left!  Delicious!
