I just made the chicken without the potatoe, it was very nice! Instead of cooking it in a fry pan I baked it in the oven and it turned out so nice and crispy.

Wow, this was delicious!  At the end, we pulled the chicken out of the skillet and browned it skin-side-down in olive oil and reduced the sauce a bit. We threw in some red pepper flakes, too. We've tried this with two Spanish red wines: a Rioja and a Ribera del Duero. Sarah and I agree that the Ribera del Duero (ours was 100% tempranillo) was far and away the better match.  Looking forward to pairing the Rioja with the Beef Tenderloin Asturia recipe (from this site) tomorrow!

Great flavor!-easy to prepare-bland in color-the dish was kind of biege. Maybe roasting the poatoes would some more color and adding some veggies! I'd recommend this dish-husband liked it-11 year old son asked me to throw the recipe away-

tasty it is.  Too much liquid in my opinion, it turned into a stew.  I grew up in Spain, not like I remembered it to be.  I will need to make some adjustments to the method of cooking, it was looking so much like the dish I remember until all that liquid went in. 2 cups total? I agree with the sherry and the port, sherry alone is fine, in the South the dish is served with the potatoes don't remove that from the recipe,  the skin of the chicken and the potatoes caramelized the sugar in the sherry and the oil amount was just right.  Eat it with crusty rustic bread.

It was excellent recipe. I cut the oil in half, and instead of using all potatoes, I mixed potatoes with onions, carrots, broccoli and celery. Not a huge fan of sherry so instead I used a Spanish Tempranillo wine with the port. It was delicious!

I tried making this, but unfortunately it did not live up to catalonian memories. Did not like the potatoes soaked in port/sherry. Thanks for the recipe, but I think I'll look for another one next time.
