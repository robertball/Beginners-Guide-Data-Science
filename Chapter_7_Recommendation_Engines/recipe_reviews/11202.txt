These were delicious, and a nice change from the standard oatmeal cookie.  Changes I made:  used regular butter instead of shortening, used cherry flavored craisins instead of dried cherries, and baked them only 10 minutes to keep them chewy.  They were a big hit at a superbowl party!  I got 3-1/2 dozen large cookies out of it.

Read a lot of the reviews and noticed the trend of using dried cranberries instead of the tart cherries. I really think the whole thing that makes this cookie so yummy is the TART CHERRY so definitely stick with that- otherwise it's really a whole new recipe, not just a tweak. They really are delicious and the tartness of the dried cherry is nice departure from the usual sweet raisins in oatmeal cookies. If you want to make it special try dipping half in melted semisweet CHOCOLATE and letting cool on parchment paper, adding mini choc chips to the batter, or drizzling with chocolate(milk, white or dark)- all pretty simple if you melt it in the microwave. Those are things I do when I am making as gifts but I enjoy them as is myself.
Also for the people with flat cookies who used BUTTER- just wondering if anyone tried COOLING the dough in the fridge for a bit before scooping and baking- that tends to prevent that sort of thing. I guess then you might want to shape them a bit since they won't spread quite as much themselves when baking.

These were fabulous oatmeal cookies, however next time I would leave out the cherries, as they tasted like expensive raisins to me. I think they would be perfect with just the walnuts. I substituted margarine for the shortening and they were perfectly chewy.  Definitely a keeper!

I made these cookies a few days ago. These were the best! I made them with dried cranberries instead of the cherries. I have made a lot of oatmeal cookies, I must say this is  the best recipie I have found for oatmeal cookies. If you don't overcook them, they are moist and delious. The whole batch was gone in a day!!!

I have to agree with previous "Razen Kane"'s review on this one.  Not a spectacular cookie.  Ok flavor and the cherries were too tart and too big for a cookie.  Gave the cookies a slight sour taste.  Might try chopped marachino cherries and maybe some nutmeg next time- if there is a next time. Sorry, not a keeper for me.

I made these all winter and my family loved them! I only made two small changes, I used marashcino cherries and added a tiny bit of vanilla.  The cherries turned the dough a slight pinkish color but they were barely able to cool before they were gone!

Very good!  Unless you want your cookies to be round like a meatball you should press them down before baking!

A great alternative to traditional chocolate chip cookies.  Although very easy to make and very enjoyable, they were not the most memorable cookies I have tasted.  I think this is because the ingriedients are not overpowering.  This is a safe cookie.

The taste of these cookies were good, but mine fell apart, something I've never really had happen before. In all fairness I did use butter instead of shortening and I put them too close together when I baked them, they spread alot.

Awesome recipe! I also used butter instead of the butter flavored shortening (what is that stuff, really?). Can someone who uses organic products comment on making the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar creamy? It did not work for me. My organic mixture never became creamy and I ended up having to add an additional 1/4c flour to make the cookies hold their shape. Thanks!!

I'll give it 5 stars even though I did sub some things along with a few mods. Didn't use baking powder - wanted a flat/chewy cookie. I did up the soda to 1.5 tsp. I REFUSE to use shortening  so subbed with butter. Used only 1/2 C of each sugar (personal pref). Upped the vanilla and added 1/2 scant tsp of pure almond extract. I only had rolled oats so my adj was 1.5 C flour & 2.5 C of oats that got chopped a bit finer in a food processor. I find if you plump up the dried cherries in some hot water and then rough chop them, they incorporate in the dough better. I mixed this in the evening and left dough in fridge all night. I do bring back to room temp b4 baking. My small round scooper holds 2 T of dough which worked perfect for me. Used a large non-stick sheet pan but lightly sprayed it with non-stick anyway. I also made sure to space them well as I knew mine would spread. Baked on an upper rack in the oven. I had no problems getting cookies off the pan after they sat there for a few minutes. Wow, I got exactly what I wanted - a flat, chewy, moist & delicious cookie. Careful not to overbake, my cookies got darker color while waiting to take them off the baking sheet. Note: I find inexpensive dried cherries at Walmart (the Great Value brand) alongside the Craisins.  Thanks Chef Doogie for the recipe even if I did alter it a bit!

Wonderful recipe!  I made this exactly on the first try.  Turned out great.  Next batch I used butter instead of shortening, cherry flavored cranberries, and macadamia nuts.  Also very tasty.  Terrific base recipe for an oatmeal cookie.

These were not at all what I expected.  They had OK flavor (a little bland), but they baked up thin and crispy.  I was looking for a full, chewy cookie.

Very good cookies-stay nice and soft and chewy-I used candied cherries because I could not find dried, and that made them a little too sweet. I will continue the search for dried cherries-and definitly add them to my Christmas cookie list!

This is very like my own recipe for cinnamon walnut oatmeal cookies. The addition of the dried sour cherries gave the cookies a new depth of flavor. My test cookie spread out too quickly and cooked unevenly. An additional 1/4 C of AP flour resulted in a nicely even, chewy cookie.  Delicious!  Makes a great breakfast cookie with coffee.

Good basic recipe. Didn’t have cherries or raisins, cut the sugar down (don’t like real sweet), doubled vanilla and cinnamon. (Hate when people make a bunch of changes, don’t you?). Dough did not spread when baking, I flattened before going in the oven. Cookies are soft, a little dry, but taste great!!!

These cookies are just Ok.  Had to cook 5 minutes longer.  Need to smash down before cooking as they did  not cook evenly without smashing down.  Stuck to the cookie sheet altering waiting 5 minutes to cool.  Would not make this recipe again.  There are better ones out there.

Good cookie!  I didn't bake quite as long because I like chewy cookies. Everything else as written. I love the tart cherries!

I followed this recipe exactly EXCEPT I used butter instead of shortening.  These turned out flat, I don't think they could have got any flatter! My cookie sheet became one giant cookie!  Good thing for me I lined the cookie sheet with parchment paper or I don't think I would have got them off the pan.  They became ugly cookie peices in a variety of sizes.   My guess is it's too much sugar & too much butter.  I was thinking maybe halving the butter & replacing the other half with applesauce.  I gave this recipe 3 stars because they tasted good....probably all that fat!  I'm sure there are WAY better oatmeal cookie recipies out there.

Tasty and soft cookies; however, cookies spread way too much and were impossible to get off the "ungreased" cookie sheet. I was afraid to grease the cookie sheet as I didn't need the cookies to spread any more!!  I managed to get about a dozen cookies out of this batch (the rest were crumbs that were eaten by me or thrown away).  Will try again but will add more flour to the mixture and will play it smart and make half the recipe.

Very good.  I like the chewy texture.
