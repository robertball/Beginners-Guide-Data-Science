OMG! these brownies are over the top good.   For a peanut butter loving family these made everyone smile.  The ingredients make it look more difficult than it really is.  It was a breeze to make and this will become a staple recipe from now on.  YUM!

The peanut butter portion of this is way too salty and not sweet at all.  I like my brownies sweet!  I might try it again, but next time leave out the salt.  I found the texture to be very cake-like even without adding baking powder.

I usually don't change things around at all , but I was looking for something quick. I used boxed brownie mix and added I box of banana cream pudding and for the peanut butter part, I used 1/2 cup melted in the micro and added 3 tablespoon powdered suger, than swirled the end result was amazing. Thank you sharing

These were decadent, thick and pretty.  At first I thought I had made a mistake because the batter was quite heavy but had faith and they turned out great.  I made them for a group and they loved them. Only had vanilla pudding on hand - can't wait to make them with banana.

Peanut butter and banana are a favorite flavor combo of mine so of course I had to try this recipe.  The brownies were thin, but moist and rich.  I could taste the banana and the peanut swirl on top but for some reason it just didn't all come together for  me.

Nice texture but not particularly sweet or intense flavors...just not worth the effort to make or eat.
