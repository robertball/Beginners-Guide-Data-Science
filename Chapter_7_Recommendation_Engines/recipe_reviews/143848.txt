This showy side salad delites the young and the old alike.

I added a bit of powdered cinnomen to the cranberry juice.  A vegtable peeler made the peeling process go quickly and a thin slice off the bottom made it so they all could stand proudly and uniquely.

Afterwards I added a apple juice to the warm cranberry juice and served the flavorful leftovers chilled...

Very good!  This was used as a dessert.  Very tasty.  I cooked down the leftover liquid and drizzled it over each pear just before serving.  Presentation looked lovely and taste was terrific.

Easy to make and most delicious. I was concerned that the hard pears may not cook up well, but I was pleasantly surprised. I served these pears on a pedastal platter and the presentation was quite delightful. Thanks for the cranberry pear combo.

I serve these as a light refreshing dessert after a heavier meal.  Always a hit, and so easy.  I have cooked them in a small crockpot for a few hours also.  Just make sure it's only a few hours and not overcook.

I served this for dessert and it was a hit. I left the peel on the pears and let the juice cook down into a syrup. (I used unsweetened cranberry juice and maple syrup instead of cranberry cocktail - then let it cook down until it was thick.) I then cut the cooked pears in half, scooped out the seed part and filled this with the 'cranberry syrup' and dribbled more across the top. Very pretty and delicious.

Color wasn't as noticable as I would like for it to have been. Would add a drop of red food coloring to liquid. Tried apples...taste good, but reduce cook time by 1/2.

Made my apartment smell wonderful! Unfortunately, the cranberry didn't quite take to the pears and so the pear tasted, well, like a pear. The color was beautiful and would definitely make a lovely side to an ice cream dessert!

Delicious, and made the whole house smell wonderful!  Next time I might cook the pears longer to help them soak up even more of the sauce.

This is a delicious recipe that looks very fancy but is SUPER easy, definately one to make if you're wanting to impress. Its light with just the right amount of sweetness. My only recommendation is to add a bit more cranberry juice for the pear to soak in. The leftover sauce is also fantastic if you refrigerate overnight and then pour over vanilla icecream.

The pears are amazing!  I left them to stew in the juice for about 35 min. instead of the suggested 20 because I used firm pears.  The pears came out great!  Next time I think I'll try adding some rum or something similar to give them a bit of a kick.

GREAT-- wanted to try something new and healthy for my family, and everyone loved it and thought it looked like it was out of a magazine! You will impress your guests for sure! I did 2 1/2 cups cranberry, 2 cups orange juice, and then used ground cinnamon (about 1 teaspoon), and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. It all came out great. I was tempted to use a little ginger ale, for some sparkle and zing, but held off for another time. Served with one scoop of vanilla. Be sure if your pear stems aren't long enough to serve with a spoon and a fork or knife so your guests can hold that pear still!  One thing: I also did not get the "blush" effect. I will reduce the liquid after (maybe a drop of food coloring?). But, for a cute trick, have a small server of the liquid at the table (room temp) to pour a little on the pear, and that looks like a blush ;)  GREAT GREAT and will do again, thank you very much!

Absolutely delicious.  I served them warm as a dessert.  Everyone including the kids liked them (except the husband who doesn't like pears).  I had 2 left over that we ate cold, that were also very good.  I can't decide if I like them better warm or cold.  Will definitely make this again.

Try serving these pears with Mascapone Cheese, It is so decadent. My Husband serves a very similar dessert, the only difference is that he uses red wine in place of the Cranberry Juice, everyone adores them and the wine cooks out so even the kids have a taste.

Really lovely recipe.  I love the flavor the cinnamon stick gives to it.  And it smells really good.  After it cooled the juice left the pretty "blush" on the pears.  I was really impressed.  When I make it for dinner guests, I might try to thicken the sauce to serve it as a garnish to the pears and follow the advice of others by cutting the bottom so it can stand up making a pretty display. But today there were no frills and we all enjoyed it.

I made this and followed the recipe exactly.  While the aroma was wonderful, the pears did not take on the flavor as I had hoped.  The just tasted like soft, broiled, pears.  I will not make this again.

VERY simple recipe! I would agree with a few other reviews. Add a touch of ground cinnamon as well as a drop of red food coloring (for presentation only). I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar. Overall, love the taste of the pear!

I added 1/4 cup or so of rum to the liquid.  After the pears were cooked I simmered the liquid more in order to thicken it as another reviewer had suggested.  To serve, I poured the hot liquid over the pear and topped it with blueberry ice cream.  So good!

Yummy! Used CranRaspberry juice since I had it. Didn't need sugar with the sweetened juice. Great for gluten or dairy intolerant or low-sugar.  Served with vanilla ice cream.

I liked this - I am not one to follow recipes but I really enjoyed your idea.  I used an Asian Pear so it could withstand a little more cooking without getting mushy.  I peeled, cored and simmered in Cranberry with a little sugar until the pear started to swell. It took on a good strong flavor but still had good texture.  What a nice dessert, thank you.

I heard about these from a friend who used Cranberry flavored Canada Dry Ginger Ale.  So I used that in place of Cranberry Cocktail and they came out amazingly. (Was a cool effect when I added the sugar)  I reduced the sauce as some said and really liked that.  I had to quarter the pears as I was bringing it to a pot luck so the pears had to sit in the sauce for a bit and they absorbed much more color than they had just after cooking.

I made this for dessert last night.. It was delicious! I had to make some edits because I didn't have everything the recipe called for. I used bosc pears, raspberry juice, powdered cinnamon, vanilla, sugar and agave nectar.. After cooking them for about a half hour I let them sit in the juice until I served them a couple of hours later.. They became a beautiful pink colour and were delicious!
