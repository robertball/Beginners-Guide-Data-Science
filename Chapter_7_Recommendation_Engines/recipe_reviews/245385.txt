This had potential, but, it definitely needs more seasoning.    I am not a chorizo fan, so, I made an 8 x 8 pan using chorizo and an 8 x 8 pan using hot breakfast sausage instead.   It did seem that the casserole could use some extra filling, so, I added a little extra sausage, onion, & peppers.   I also added some salt & pepper to the mix.    I might make this again, but, I would add some garlic powder & cayenne to the potato, onion, pepper mixture when I sauteed it to add some more flavor.

This is very good!  It’s just me and my husband so I did an 8x8 glass pan.  Used the same amount of chorizo1/2 the eggs.  I did season the potatoes with season all.  It doesn’t say when to add the chorizo so I added to the potatoes and just cooked for a few more minutes. I covered the top with cheese and cooked as directed.

My family loves this recipe...lasts in the fridge for later perfectly.  Will make this over and over.  Salt and Pepper to taste, even have added chopped green chilis and paprika on top for an extra flair.
