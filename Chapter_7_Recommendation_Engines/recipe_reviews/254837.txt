What a sneaky way of getting a healthy veggie in the mac and cheese! I love this! I sure wish I could have found fontina cheese, but I couldn't. I googled for a substitution and saw that provolone was suggested. However, it made the sauce stringy and not "pretty" and smooth as in the 2 photos before mine. Still tasted good though.

This was really good! My market didn't carry the Barilla pasta sauce so I just used some marinara and added some fresh basil to the puree. I had this done in 22 minutes (I timed it) and my 3 year old gobbled this up. He never eats sweet potatoes btw! I'm going to make a big batch to freeze for quick lunches for my son. Thanks for sharing!
