I loved this cake! All those nuts is what made this sooo good, but it did take a long time to chop them all up by hand, and a long time to bake. I added some spices to mine. My grand kids didn't think much of it, but what do they know??It is a great holiday cake, and keeps forever in the ice box.

Yummy! Very crunchy and chewy and dense and sticky, just like a good fruitcake. Beautiful sliced, like stained glass.

double the batter, so it sticks together better.  and if making in smaller sized loafs, reduce the bake time.  ffk

I think some ingredient is missing from this.  It came out way too dry.  I followed the directions exactly.  Not enough batter for the nuts and fruit.

I might've done something wrong (like use slightly smaller pans), because the fruit mixture was enough for a double recipe.  I saved half of the fruit to make later, and used the entire batter recipe, since my husband likes his a little cake-y.  Other than that, it was simple to make, and even better to eat :)

The baking time was too long.  The cake was too crunchy and hard to cut.  I poured some rum over the loaf and let it sit for a day.  Unfortunately the cake fell apart.  Now I serve it in a bowl.  Tastes great!
