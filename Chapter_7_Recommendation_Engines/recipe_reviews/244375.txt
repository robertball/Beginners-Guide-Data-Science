I have made this rub many times now. I made a few changes. I reduced cayenne pepper to 1 tsp as I don't like too much heat. I reduced salt to 1 tbsp because I also use a bbq sauce to finish at the end. I also added a bit of cumin just because. I marinate ribs overnight with the rub, applied freely. I fully cook the ribs slowly in the oven (I have a steam/convection combination). At the end, I remove ribs and brush on bbq sauce and put back in oven on high heat for just 10 minutes, or throw on grill. I have been told these are the best ribs someone has ever tasted, including restaurants.

Thank you for this recipe. I made it my own, but I started with this.

My family loves this rub on pork or chicken. It can get a bit spicy. Use only half of the cayenne pepper. Looks dry on the outside but seals the flavors and juices into the meat.  Excellent rub.

Used the rub on Beef Chuck Roast. The flavor was very good but a little more heat than my family likes. A little less chili powder to bring down the heat.

Have used it twice and the ribs come out tender and tasty. Finish them with a favorite barbecue sauce and 15 minutes under the broiler.

Great easy recipe used dried onion flakes instead of onion powder and reduced the cayenne pepper to cut the heat for the kids but overall very happy with recipe
