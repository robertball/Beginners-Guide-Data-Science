Yummy!  I found I can put all the dry ing. + raisins chocolate chips or whatever you want in your cookie, in a 1 qt. ziploc bag. and keep in refrigerator until needed then just pour into a mixing bowl and add "wet" ing. I keep 2 of them in the refrig. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and nutmeg, I use the whole nut and prob. grate about 1/4 tsp. I also added about 1/2 tsp. more vanilla.  I did make 8 BIG cookies.  Very filling w/coffee.

I substituted 1/2 c. canned pumpkin for the banana and used 3 egg whites instead of 2.  Turned out great!  I will definitely make them again.

I made them just like the recipe said first time and they were delicious. Second time I doubled the batch and reduced the chocolate chips in half and added chopped pecans instead. I took another reviewer's suggestion and used canned pumpkin instead of the bananas. Also added cinnamon and a little nutmeg. They were even better!

I used all whole wheat flour and half the sugar and chocolate chips as I'm watching our sugar intake. Used about 1/4 cup of dough per cookie, squashed down to about 1/2" thick. Cookies came out nice and cakey, sweet enough, but will definitely add some cinnamon next time. Overall, good adaptable recipe.

Great go-to recipe.  Don't bother with egg whites - just use the whole egg.  Kids want me to try it next time with dried blueberries and white choc chips.  Will try that next time.

I doubled this for breakfast this morning and had enough for two more mornings.  I used spelt flour instead of white and maple syrup instead of brown sugar.  I also added ground flax and walnuts.  This probably does not need any sugar, especially if chocolate chips are used.  I definitely will use this recipe again in our breakfast cookie rotation, especially when we have overripe bananas.

This is great. Thanks to contributor Amanda Leilani! I joined Weight Watchers in January, and this recipe is great. I followed the recipe exactly except that I substituted ground flax seed meal for the wheat germ because that's what I had. They're a bit dense, but I like that. Most of all, they are super filling and excellent with coffee.

It says 8 servings, but those would be he huge cookies. I found that it makes about 24 smaller cookies, or 12 servings, so I eat two. It's only 5 Points Plus points!

Even my 12-year old likes them.

I like how it is so versatile.  I made it following the recipe but next time I think I will try pineapple and orange zest with white choc chips.  I like the pumpkin idea too.

Oh man these are really good.  The only changes for me were flax seed instead of wheat germ, that us what I had on hand.  Coconut instead of chocolate chips.  I think I may have gone a bit over on banana and applesauce but the end product was heavenly.  I made four big cookies and that will give me four breakfast to work on.  Thanks for the recipe.  I am going to go pistachios and chocolate chips for my husband.

These turned out great! Iâ€™m always looking for ways to add more oatmeal to our chaotic mornings and these for the bill. I did substitute peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips, and omitted the cranberries but added walnuts. Really delicious and will def make again!

I'm trying to eat more healthy so I thought I'd try these. They may be great for healthy eaters, but I didn't think they had much taste.

Average at very very best. Incredibly dry as per recipe and even after I added additional apple sauce. Nothing special about the flavor. Won't make again.

I tweaked recipe a little bit. Only had half a cup of flour left so added extra oats and PB Fit (peanut butter powder).  Didn't have wheat germ so added chia seeds instead. Replaced cranberries with raisins and added walnuts and semi sweet chocolate chips.  They tasted pretty good. Not too sweet.... but for a breakfast cookie it's perfect.  Also fairly healthy.  Oh yea, used whole egg, I prefer more protein and didn't want to waste the yoke.

This is a fun recipe to play with. We change out ingredients each time we make them. The athletes in our house love them, as we add protein sources to some of the batches. Great recipe! Thanks!

These are great to keep in the refrigerator and grab as you go.  I didn't have banana so I used a total of 1 1/4 c. applesauce.  I reduced the chocolate chips by half and used Splenda brown sugar instead of the real brown sugar, and the 50% reduced sugar cranberries.  Next time I will use a little more salt, but other than that, they are great!

These are delicious and healthy. I didn't have applesauce so I used pumpkin instead. I added cinnamon, allspice, and ginger to compliment the pumpkin. I used 1 whole egg. The only thing I would change is to make them a touch sweeter.

We used the whole egg, replaced the wheat germ with flax meal, used Better Baking Blend by Madhava Sweeteners vs brown sugar, used raisins in place of cranberries, and added a dash of cinnamon. Soft and delicious. So very very delicious.

I have been making a version of these every two weeks for the last three months. I love how easily you can tweak it to be your own. I used homemade applesauce I canned earlier with little additional sugar. I also swapped the cranberries and chocolate chips for raisins. I omitted the flours for nut flour using almond and coconut. My husband takes these to work each day for breakfast. Healthy and delicious.

Very tasty!  We followed the recipe exactly except we used dark chocolate chips.  I had considering cutting back on the amount of dried cranberries, but I'm so glad I left the full amount in.

Not bad.  The chocolate is pretty dominant, in my opinion.  These don't flatten much and turn out like little muffin tops packed with fiber.  I had to add more applesauce; about 2 tbs; as it wasn't coming together otherwise.  12 minutes makes a soft, chewy cookie.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great! Tried it today, doubled the recipe and got exactly 32 cookies out of it. They are rather big and quite filling, not exactly what I was looking for but a pleasant surprise!I'll be keeping this recipe around for a while I think! Gave it four stars because I upped the wheat germ by about 3/4 teaspoons and used less salt, but overall great recipe! Thanks for the idea!

These were very simple to make.  Came out chewy and tasred like an oatmeal cookie...I used coconut instead of chocolate chips.
