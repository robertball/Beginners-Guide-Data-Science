These were wonderful cookies!  Very moist and chewy.  I halved the recipe, but used the same amount of cinnamon and they were very tasty.  I was concerned when I finished mixing the dough that it was too wet, and the cookies would flatten when cooked, but they stayed in a nice little mound.

This recipe is great, and I don't like Oatmeal Raisin Cookies.  I loved that you can taste the spices and that they turn out soft, not hard like every other Oatmeal cookie I've had before.

Very Good. Made it a little healthier by using Splenda Brown Sugar Blend and 1 cup applesuace in place of 1/2 the shortening. I also added 1 cup walnuts. I will make again!

The spices in this recipe were excellent, and the cookies had a great flavor; my only complaint is that the cookies are very dense and your mouth feels strangely sucked dry of all its moisture after each bite. Also, (this may be an altitude problem), I had to cook them a couple extra minutes, and I needed to flatten the cookies prior to cooking them or they cooked in near-perfect balls, haha. The first batch looked pretty funny.

This was the first time trying this recipie. It went together easily but looked a little wet when done but was ok. I had to bake about 15 minutes because I use thick baking sheets. They turned out nice, soft and very tasty. The spices where just in the right amount for someone to enjoy but not overpowering. Will keep this one in cookie recipie book.

Very good melt-in-your-mouth cookies. This made a huge batch. I left out the clove since hubby doesn't like it and ran out of vanilla, but these still were really good. Thanks!

The good: Unlike a lot of oatmeal raisin cookies I've tried on this site, these ones don't spread, or crumple when you try to take them off the sheet.  The bad:  The texture is gummy and doughy, and the flavor is weak.  I've never used a cookie recipe that called for milk, maybe that was the problem here.

Loved this recipe, I used butter flavored shorting, cause I like the butter flavor, and added walnuts.  I think this is such wonderful basic oatmean cookie recipe you could add whatever you wanted to it.  I think next time I might try coconut or chocolate chips, maybe pineapple.  It does make a big batch, but no problem, I left them in a container on the table and they were gone in 3 days, my family would grab a couple everytime they were here.  This is diffently a keeper.

Excellent cookies, most, soft and delicious. Would leave out cloves next time. Also, I added an extra 1/2 C of raisins, but it needed more (more like 4 C instead of 2).

These cookies are delicious!  I used 1 cup of butter flavored shortening and 1 cup of regular shortening.  I didn't have any allspice , so I just doubled the cinnamon and cloves and threw in a little ground ginger too. YUM!!  So much flavor.  I like the fact that it makes such a large batch because I like to have extra cookie dough in the freezer, so I can whip up cookies for the kiddos after school.  I baked half the dough and froze the other half...perfect.  This recipe is a keeper!!!!
Thank you for sharing it.

Unfortunately these turned out pretty bad for me. I ended up with extremely cake-like lumps that tasted good but were very very dry. Next time i will use a spinoff of my monster cookie recipe with cinnamon and cloves, some additional spices and just add raisins. It would definitely taste better. Disappointed.

I liked the spice of these cookies, but though they were soft, mine didn't come out moist!  It was dry, more like a bread consistency than the chewy cookie I was expecting - what did I do wrong??

I was looking for a soft oatmeal cookie recipe with raisins and found the perfect one here. I started with 1/2 recipe, used 1/2 margarine and 1/2 shortening and used chocolate-covered raisins-perfect!

Cookies came out like a dry cake rather than a cookie. Tasted like way too much flour in the recipe. I used this in place of my old tried and true recipe that my son loves due to being out of town. will wait until I get home and post my recipe for all who where looking for a soft moist chewy cookie with a little crunch around the edges!!

Easy to follow recipe. Makes plenty of cookies.  Very tasty-although I might reduce the ground cloves and allspice to 1/2 teaspoon measures for taste preference.

Made exactly as written in the recipe. These are perfect. I used a cookie scoop and they came out nice & round and didn’t flatten in the oven. They are delicious and they smell heavenly!

I love these so much! They are soft, flavorful, easy to tinker with, and overall simply amazing! Wonderful with raisins or dried blueberries, regular or butter-flavored shortening. I soak the dried berries in hot water for 10 minutes before adding. Definitely a keeper!

I used a measured scoop and made slightly larger cookies. I also added chocolate chips. They were too cake like for me, but the flavor was good.

I made these but they were a bit drier than I prefer. Not sure why some folks’ cookies were moist. However, the spices used were delicious!  I’d never used cloves in oatmeal raisin cookies before (I used it in ginger cookies) and the spice taste was fabulous.

This recipe gets mixed reviews in our house.....  My son absolutely loves them; I like the standard, chewy variety of Oatmeal Raisin Cookies better.  Before you decide whether or not to make this recipe, you should understand that it is NOT a flat, chewy cookie.....  This is a very moist CAKE cookie.  If you like cake cookies, then you're in the right spot!  With that said, since my son really likes this version of Oatmeal Raisin, I have now made this recipe twice and tweaked it a bit.  With the original recipe, I thought the cookies were bland....  When mixing in the spices, it smelled so good, that I had high expectations.  Somehow, the flavors dissipate when baking.  Also, I added another cup of raisins about 2 cookie sheets in..... not nearly enough raisin flavor when I sampled one.  The second time I DOUBLED all of the spices in the recipe, and added 4 cups of raisins (not just 2), and I like the flavor much better!

My husband is not a big fan of raisins, so I mixed raisins, dried cranberries and chocolate chips. No shortening in the house so butter was used. Turned out wonderful, even my spouse thought so! Will make again.

I have made these several times. My husband absolutely loves these, and I have thrown out any other oatmeal raisin recipes. These are the only oatmeal cookies I make, and actually the most  often made cookie for me!

I personally do not like oatmeal raisin cookies. The rest of my family does and they loved these cookies. So I say excellent and will be making these again. Thank you.

I made this recipe this morning exactly as the instructions say.  It created the perfect oatmeal raisin cookie.  Soft, moist, a little chewy, with plenty of raisins.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  My husband and 10 year old son give it rave reviews, too.  It's now in the permanent cookie recipe file.

I did like the flavor with all the spices but the cake - like texture was not expected and a little disappointing.

Great starter recipe. My granddaughter and I however made a number of adjustments. We added soft margarine instead of shortening. We substituted nutmeg for the allspice and omitted the cloves. We substituted vanilla yogurt for the milk. We educed the vanilla by half as we had used vanilla yogurt. For the raisins we did 1/2 raisins and 1/2 dried cranberries. We also added a 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips. We also used parchment paper which allowed us to eliminate the grease needed for the pan. So far the best oatmeal cookie recipe.
