Loved the flavor combo in this. I used red potatoes so I left the peels on. I do think  an hour and 15 minutes would have been too long of a cook time. I cooked them covered for 30 minutes then uncovered and cooked 20 minutes and they were plenty roasted. Overall good recipe and one I would make again.

I also added parsnips and beets. All veggies were fabulous!
