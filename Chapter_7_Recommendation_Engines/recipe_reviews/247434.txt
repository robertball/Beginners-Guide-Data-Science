Wow! I did use tilapia as the recipe submitter mentioned and this was excellent.  I am not fan of cream of soups but it was great in this. The combo of the soup, cream cheese, and sherry creates this rich buttery flavor that melts in your mouth. It did get a little thick on me but other than that I have no complaints. I added real bacon bits to my plate (as seen in the photo) but it sure didn't need it  and they will be left off next time. This is good enough to serve to company! Use real sherry though and not the cooking sherry.

I made this exactly as written. I found the sauce too strong and it hid the fish flavor. My husband enjoyed it.

I made this with Tilapia, used a medium dry sherry and was pleasantly surprised! It is very quick and easy, and is a great base to add other ingredients to. I did find the sauce to be too thick as written, so I added some heavy cream to thin it out. I also cut some grape tomatoes in half and added them to the sauce at the end along with some Cajun seasoning and black pepper. The finished sauce reminded me of a tomato/vodka sauce I have made before. Chicken stock could be used in place of cream to thin the sauce as well. A good base recipe that I will probably experiment with again!

We really enjoyed this basic recipe which I had to alter a bit because I did not have Cream of Shrimp soup on hand, and my husband loathes cream cheese. So I substituted Cream of Mushroom soup, added a few sauteed mushrooms to the final presentation and substituted a soft herbed cheese that I had on hand.  I followed the method exactly and the monkfish were so moist and flavorful -- perfectly cooked.  I served them with the sauteed mushrooms and the sauce over top.  The family raved about this meal.  That's a 5 star result in my book.

Update:  The second time I made this recipe, I did use Cream of Shrimp soup and continued as written.  (I even used a modest amount of cream cheese to thicken it, but it did alter the flavor to the point where my husband did not care for it. ) Everyone in my family much preferred the Mushroom sauce, but this is a wholly subjective point.
