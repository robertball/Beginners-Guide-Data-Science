There are certain foods that bring back wonderful childhood memories and these certainly do just that. My Austrian grandmother "Oma" made these for us every Christmas. I have continued with the tradition and can't imagine a Christmas without them. The only change I make is that once the cookies are out of the oven I dip them into granulated sugar as opposed to confectioners. Confectioners sugar tends to yellow and eventually disappears into the cookie. Try these they're wonderful. Thanks Deana!

cookies turned out delicious but not due to the recipe...dough was not the correct texture to roll so I had to form them into crecents in my hand also a few inconsistencies ie:margerine vs butter. I always use butter and they were yummy just not a recipe for a novice baker to use.

Very nice and very easy cookie to make. I had to add a little more water then mentioned. Next time I will make a double batch. This is the first time in my life that I baked and they turned out great. I used oil to make the dough easier to roll.

These turned out GREAT! I did substitute walnuts for pecans and I used 2 cups flour and 1 and a half cups nuts. I thought handling them would make them tough but they are crisp and light and delicious!

Like others I had hard time rolling them out so I just shaped them in my hands and instead of adding just one type of nuts I added almonds and walnuts as well with a pinch of salt. My husband brought these to his office and they were all asking for more. His parents made a special request to me tonight: they are having a guest over and they'd like me to bake me these cookies.

I too found it hard to roll these into shape so I just shaped them by hand. The kids had fun helping with this part. These are so delicious and will be making these at the holidays.

This recipe was great! They disappeared really quickly... The only change I made was adding a few tablespoons more white sugar but other than that this recipe is wonderful!

Very good. I made some with pecans and substituted pecans for walnuts in the rest and both were very good.

As eveyone mentions I remember these from being a kid. They are my all time favorite. really don't know why I don't make them more often. I tried the powdered sugar and granular as suggested they all turned out great. They don't last long.

My friend makes these cookies and I covet them each Christmas so this year I went in search of a recipe to duplicate. I came across this one and another on this site (Pecan Crescents). So many recipes come down to personal preference but I must say this Crescent Cookies recipes paled in comparison to the other. The most notable difference was 2.5 cups flour here vs 2 cups flour 1/2 cup powdered sugar blended in on the other recipe. Having the sugar IN the dough really makes a big difference in texture and sweetness and I much prefer the other version. This one had drier dough that was harder to keep together while rolling and nearly every cookie broke when I gently tossed in the powdered sugar. If you're a fan of these but this version also isn't quite right for your tastes try the "Pecan Crescents."

I never got it into a dough. Something is missing from the recipe.

I made these this morning and must say I was disappointed. They taste too floury and the dough is hard to handle. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can add? They were very dry.

Very good but difficult to roll out. I added some water and a little milk to make the dough come together. Also added a 1/3 cup white sugar to the dough-felt it needed some sweetness and not just from the powdered sugar. Good recipe though.

This recipe was very tasty. However when I was making it into dough I couldn't get it into dough form so I had to add water to the dough and even then I just used my hands to form the shape. Also in the recipe it says u need 3 tablespoons of white sugar but in the directions it doesn't tell you when to put the sugar in. So you have to add the sugar with the flour baking powder and chopped pecans. I also substituted pecans for walnuts but any nut will be fine. Over all they were tasty!

They crumbled after I baked them. The flavor was good but other than that they were pretty bad.
