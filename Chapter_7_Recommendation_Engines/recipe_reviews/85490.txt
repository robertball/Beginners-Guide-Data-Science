This dish has zip!  It's quite tasty and not intimidating as it looks to prepare.  i was able to find most of the ingredients at my local grocery store, although I didn have to hunt around for the curry leaf.  I did slightly reduce the quantity of mint leaves however because I thought half a bunch seemed like it might be a lot and as a matter of personal preference, I prefer a more subtle mint flavor anytime I use mint in cooking.

I thought this was really good.  The flavors are very complex.  I didnt think tis was a complicated recipe and the different steps are designed to bring out the full flavor of the spices.  I would make this again for sure.

I pretty much followed the recipe, except that I sauteed some diced chicken breast along with onion, I used way less cilantro and mint (half a bunch is A LOT!), and omitted the curry leaf (didn't have any). This was good and we enjoyed it, but I've made less labor-intensive curries that have been just as good. Also, take care to remove the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods and cloves before serving - biting into them unawares is not pleasant.

I LOVED this curry! Despite the long ingredient list, it's not that difficult to make as long as you've got a well stocked pantry and pre-roasted peanuts. I omitted the curry leaf as that was the one thing that I didn't have, and it still tasted amazing
