Not a huge fan it tasted ok but I think it would be better without the zucchini. Also didn't like the colour and texture felt like i was drinking a cold cup of relish.

Delicious and soooo refreshing! I went a step further, and instead of using regular water I used coconut water, which was perfect in this! The sweetness from the mango w/ the tart lemon and coconut flavor was a perfect combination. I will def be making this again~YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Subbed a cucumber for the zucchini and added fresh ginger and used Vitamix to prepare.   It was delicious and will definitely make again and add to favs.
