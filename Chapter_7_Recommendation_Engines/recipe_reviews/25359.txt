Wonderful!  Even my picky Italian husband loved this.  I used asparagus, carrots, corn, yellow pepper and spinach.  If you can't find the herb & garlic dry soup, vegetable works just fine.  I only used a little corn - don't listen to other reviews - some corn in vegetable lasagne tastes great.  I had enough left over to make a little 8x8 for the freezer.  Use the no boil lasagne noodles (Barilla) and you cut your preparation time in half!  Thanks for a great make again recipe!!

It was very tasty.  I would make it again.  However, it came out like veggie soup with noodles.  I would like some input how to not have it so soupy.

This is an awesome, high protein veggie meal. I made it for dinner guests and they loved it, and  my husband ate almost half of it in one sitting. I think it's almost better heated up the next day. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Adding corn does seem a little weird, but it is actually really good in this recipe. I've made this twice and the first time I made it I prepared it the night before so I could just pop it in the oven the next day, and it turned out perfect.

Okay, can I say that this recipe knocked my roommates socks off!!  They are picky eaters (you wouldn't think that about college students, huh? but they were) and they absolutely loved it.  Since they love cheese I used more and cut out corn all together...they thought it was creepy to put corn in lasagna.....but it was still a great hit!

This recipe was great, thank you.  I used fresh carrots and broccoli and cooked them up with a little garlic, onion, and fresh mushrooms... it was fabulous!  Goes great with a nice salad.  Thanks again.

This was an excellent recipe.  I served it for a family party, and my sister who hates a "saucy" lasagna absolutly loved it!  It was very tasty, and I loved the kick that the herb soup mix gave it. Did not find the ingredience were soupy at all, it was like a lagagna cheese mixture.  Previous reviewer, did you add water with the cream of mushroom soup?  That is the only thing that I can think you might have done, mine was fabulous! I will definatly be making this again.

Oh my, this was good. It kind of turned out like a cross between a pot pie or casserole and traditional lasagna. I've never tried a lasagna recipe that didn't include a tomato-based sauce, but this was awesome. I didn't have corn on hand and wasn't really wanting corn in it, so I substituted some sliced zucchini that I had. I also used plain nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream. I couldn't find the soup mix at the grocery store, so minced a garlic and added a sprinkling of herbs. Wow, it turned out wonderful. I think the only thing I'd do differently is maybe stirfry or preboil the carrots. Despite the cooking time, they came out a bit crunchy. One tip is to definitely completely thaw the broccoli and then drain it very well. I pressed it several times. If you don't, you'll probably end up with veggie lasagna soup like someone else did. This was terrific. A definite keeper!

Perfect alternative to traditional lasagna.  My husband does not care for red sauce, so this was a great recipe for him.  I didn't add the corn, but instead substituted a 10 oz. pkg. of spinach.  It just did'nt feel right to add corn and the spinach was a perfect match.

This lasagna was Awesome!! My DH and I ate this for three meals because we liked it so much and it made a lot! It was just as good if not better as leftovers. I actually used low fat soups (cream of mushroom & cream of chicken) and used mozarella cheese instead of the cheddar. I used all fresh vegetables in this as well (grated carrots, spinach, broccoli, mushrooms, onions and garlic) and sauteed them all together on the stovetop before adding to the lasagna. My DH suggested that next time we try adding chicken as well & I can't wait to try it that way!

Delicious! I used a thawed 10 oz box of frozen broccoli and two 10 oz packages of mixed veggies (green beans, corn, lima beans). I couldn't find garlic soup mix; so, i veggie dip mix. I substituted 7 oz fat free mozzarella cheese for the cheddar.I also used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup, fat free sour cream, and egg beaters instead of eggs to lighten the recipe  Tip: Put the cheese mix on the bottom, then needles, then veggies and repeat. End with noodles and smear just a bit of leftover cheese mix on top.

I've got to say it wasn't one of my favourites. If I'm going to spend time layering, I'd use a different recipe.

This recipe is VERY rich and heavy.  The sauce is similar in taste, texture and thickness to a rich alfredo sauce, which is tasty, but it was too much for my husband and I.  I wouldn't say it's all that similar to actual lasagna, more like a very cheesy vegetable casserole.  I personally wouldn't use it again as a main dish because it was so heavy, but I think it would make a nice side dish.  I replaced the corn with chopped spinach, which tasted great.  If I try it as a main dish again next time I will make half of the sauce and replace the other half with a light marinara base, so that it will be more of a cheesy marinara sauce and hopefully not so heavy.  And I will definitely add more vegetables like zucchini and even sliced tomatoes.  I think the combination of varying the sauce and adding more light veggies would take away some of the heaviness.

better than I thought it would be! I chopped the carrots and broc. in the blender while still frozen because my DH hates big pieces of broc. Subbed one can of broc and cheese soup for one of the mushroom soups as another reviewer suggested. yummy! I also used the no boil noodles like another reviewer suggested and that cut down on the prep time. (Just make sure you cover those noodles with sauce or they come out a little crunchy on the corners).

My husband was leary, but about every 10 minutes after we ate it he kept saying "that was REALLY good!" I sauteed yellow and green zucchini and I slightly cooked some fresh carrots and fresh broccoli and used those as my veggies and it was great!  This was also a great "make ahead" dish.  I made it Friday without cooking it and kept it in the fridge until we cooked it Sunday night and it was just fine.  So I made one for my friend who just had twins knowing she could cook it whenever she got around to it.

This lasagna was very favorful.  I really think it's the garlic/herb soup mix that makes the filling taste so awesome.  I did make a few minor changes.  Instead of two cans of cream of mushroom soup, I used one can mushroom and one can brocolli cheese soup since I'm not a big mushroom person.  I also had to omit the corn but did add a thin layer of spinach and one layer of thinly sliced tomatoes.  One friend I served this to remarked that she really liked the changes.

I have tried several veggie lasagna recipes but never one without tomato sauce. This intrigued me so I gave it a try. I served this at a catering event & they devoured it! I couldn't locate herb & garlic soup mix so I just added 1 T dried parsley & 1 tsp oregano. Left the corn out & added some blanced mushrooms. It was divine! Thanks so much Christine.

Loved this lasagna!!  The ONLY thing I might suggest is that...if you want your vegetables tender you may want to pre-cook them before putting them in the lasagna.  Yummy.

My whole family (including my 2-year-old!) loved this recipe. I used all ingredients as listed; however, I did rinse and drain off the ice from the frozen vegetables. I think that that may have been what contributed to another reviewer's soupy consistency. (And I didn't add water or milk to the mushroom soup.) Serve this up with a warm, crusty bread, and dinner's complete.

The cafeteria when I was in college served this delicious veggie lasagna that I have been trying to duplicate for years, and now I FINALLY a good facsimile!! Tasted just like I remembered it! I subbed spinach for the corn, added mushrooms to the cheese mixture, and used mozzarella instead of cheddar cheese. My picky Italian husband who believes lasagna should only be made with red sauce didn't care for it, but I ate three pieces! My two-year-old son enjoyed it also. Thank you, Thank you, THANK YOU!!!!

Delicious!  I made a few modifications--I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom and used a bag of mixed veggies that included broccoli, carrots and water chestnuts, which tasted marvelous.  I did keep the frozen corn in as well.  Based on other reviews, I steamed my veggies in the microwave and they were the perfect consistency after baking.

I thought this was really good. Although, I was not able to make it exactly as directed because I couldn't find the herb dry soup mix. I did however add Italian Herb and Cheese Philadelphia Cooking Cream to the mixture, and I thought that was very tasty!! I also used mozzarella cheese in the mixture. If I make it again, I will salt the veggies just a little I think. All in all, I think this one is a keeper!

Pretty good.  I used spinach instead of the veggies listed.  After the fact, I realized I left out the herb and garlic soup mix.  I used reduced fat sour cream and Barilla no-boil noodles.  Good recipe to use pantry staples.

A VERY cool dish, but I think I might wanna name it something different (casserole, maybe?) It's a great blend of flavors, and even my pickiest stepminion enjoyed it. Don't skimp on the cheese or seasoning though. Also, fresh carrots work just as well as frozen.

Fantastic! Was not expecting this to be as good as it was! I will bank this recipe for future use!! I used fresh broccoli, carrots, mushrooms and a little chopped onion. Also, kept the frozen corn. I sautéed the vegys. with a little garlic. I couldn't find the garlic soup mix so I used a vegy. one. Made for great leftovers!!

Delicious! We really enjoyed this variation to a traditional lasagna. We used broccoli and corn only because that’s what we had on hand. I went lighter on the sauce, didn’t use it all, and I thought it was enough. The sauce is cheesy and delicious. Good texture. This was not runny as other reviews mentioned. I could see how spinach or asparagus would be good in this recipe. Definitely tastes similar to a casserole dish.

So, so good. It feels a little unhealthy while you’re making it but use vegetable soup mix (I used both packets) and beef up the amount of frozen broccoli. I added baby Bella sliced mushrooms and boiled down a whole bag of spinach and added to the cheese mix. I also added tri color carrots (not seen) to give it a pop of color next to the broccoli. Pack in the veggies and it’s quite delicious ??

I had a love/hate experience with the recipe. I followed the directions exactly as written along with taking the advice of one user and I purchased oven ready lasagna noodles. I have never made regular lasagna (my husband does that) so I believe buying the oven ready noodles and following the directions to a T was my downfall. My noodles did NOT cook on the bottom or top. The noodles in the middle were cooked. If I had laid some mixture down in the pan first and than the noodles they probably would have cooked. But a prepared dish to me means olive oil so things don’t stick. The mixture tasted very good, but it was more like a casserole than lasagna. Very soupy. So in the future we’re going to make this mixture and use it as a sauce over noodles instead of layering it as a lasagna.

This tasted sooo yummy!! The herb and garlic soup mix made the recipe! I used mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese in my lasagna. I used the microwaveable steam fresh vegetables and it came out perfect! If people think their lasagna is too soupy, try adding cream cheese to the cheese mixture and that should stiffen it up??

Wow!  This was much better than I was expecting, and well worth the effort.  My husband is not typically a fan of "white" lasagnas, but he went back for seconds.  I used corn, spinach (well drained), and a blend of carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower.  I could not find garlic soup mix, so I used vegetable with no ill effects.  I had no problems with the lasagna being "soupy." I will say spring for the real parmesan!  The potent flavor of real parmesan really helped to make the dish -- it just wouldn't have been the same with the powdery stuff.

I Substituted cottage cheese for ricotta cheese.  I Used Greek yogurt, Fage 2%, instead of sour cream.  Instead of cheddar cheese, I used 2 cups of shredded Mexican blend cheese.  For vegetables, I used ROASTED Cauliflower, broccoli and corn. No soup mix, just a tablespoon of Herbamare (organic herb & vegetable sea salt).  I only had four oven ready lasagna noodles & Reduced the pan size to 8x8.  This turned out tasty!  Had seconds, will continue to use this recipe.

Very good! I've made it twice - first time I followed the recipe to a T and it was a hit at the family get-together I served it at. (the traditional lasagna went first but this was well received) I made it again yesterday. The main change I made was to use fresh broccoli, carrots, red bell pepper and crimini mushrooms which I sautéed with shallots and garlic in olive oil. These veggies had much better flavour compared to plain, thawed, frozen veggies. Secondly, I added a little extra shredded cheddar on top. Lastly, I realized that I was out of sour cream so I substituted plain greek yogurt which worked as well as the sour cream.  Again, it was very well received by my guests and I was very happy with it. My only tiny complain is that I taste a bit of a "pre-packaged" taste from the soup mix and canned soup even after it is baked. Still, all in all, it is a keeper! Thank you!

I skipped the sour cream and only lightly boiled the noodles, figuring the liquid from the veggies would soften them more during baking. Also, I baked 40 minutes and then let it rest in the cooling oven for 15 before serving. Excellent reviews--and I liked it too.

I used the recipe exactly as listed with the exception of the Garlic and Herb soup like a few others mentioned. I can only think of 3 reasons why it came out soupy for the people that had problems:  Noddles were NOT undercooked, broccoli was not thawed/drained enough, or the ingredients were inadvertantly not correct (no offense intended I've misread ingredients at times and then was too late to correct). All I can do is mention a few things for you to compare and see what you might change.  I use 4 layers of noodles in a 3L (12x8x2) Lasagne tray.  Sauce under the bottom of the 1st layer, more sauce, veggies, sauce and another layer of noodles, same for the 2nd layer, and then sauce over the 4th layer of noodles.  Remember noodles will continue to cook and absorb liquid and flavor if you don't rinse them with cold water.  I had a similar problem the 1st time I made spinach lasagne.  Hope this helps :-)

I really liked this!  I have acid reflux so I can't have red sauced lasagna.  I cut out the herb and garlic soup mix (couldn't find it) and I only used one can of the cream of mushroom.  It is still saucy so, like the other reviews said, I bet using two cans would have made it into lasagna soup.  
I also did one layer with some chicken and then two layers with broccoli, carrots and cauliflower.  I didn't include any corn since I there wasn't anything spicy in it to counter the sweetness of corn.
