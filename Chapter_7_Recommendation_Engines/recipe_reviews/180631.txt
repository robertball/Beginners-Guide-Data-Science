I made this for my husband and myself.  I used only 1+ pounds of skirt steak, so I reduced the marinade to 1/4th.  The marinade was great and the barbeque sauce added a sweetness to it which was delicious.  We like our steak medium to medium rare so we cooked it 5 minutes on each side.  Would make again for sure.

Great recipe Bubba! I did make a mistake, didn't read the directions and added the BBQ sauce to the marination, but I also basted the meat with BBQ sauce, it had lots of flavor. Everyone loved it!

I enjoyed the taste of this steak. I used the marinade but didn't have any bbq sauce so I made a sauce out of Hoisin sauce and pineapple juice. I slathered that on while it was on the grill. Hubby was not too fond of the wine in here. Not the recipes fault, personal preference. Thank you Bubba for the chance to make one of my favorite cuts a beef a bit more different:)

Excellent....my family and I loved this! My only change was to use white wine instead of red since it was what I had on hand. I also used 2 lbs. of skirt steak and so I halved the marinade. Marinated for 24 hours and grilled. Nice crust on the outside and very tender and juicy on the inside...extremely flavorful. Will make again and thanks!

wow. wasn't sure what to do with a skirt steak but boy do i now! the marinade really permeates the meat and compliments & brings out the barbecue flavor. i broiled it following the grilling cooking times & it was perfect. i marinated it overnight until dinner time in my vacuum marinating (foodsaver canister) - it didn't need that long with the vacuum but it didn't hurt either.will definitly make again.

This steak is GREAT!  I stumbled upon this recipe and gave it a shot.  I'm so glad I did, because this is probably my favorite steak to grill.  No changes needed, great flavor.

Excellent marinade. Many marinades for skirt steak do not tenderize enough so that one can cook the steak a little more well done. This one does and it is very, very delicious! I will use this every time I make skirt steak!

Did not know what to do with skirt steak; my husband isn't a big fan of Mexican food, so forget the fajitas. I followed this pretty much to the letter except for marinating a full 24 hours and omitting the BBQ sauce at the end, and we loved it. We had grilled onions, mushrooms and peppers with it, and served it all with rice. A perfectly delicious meal, which we'll be using often!

Everyone loved the marinade but even though I followed the directions the meat was very tough - perhaps it the cut of meat we had. I am saving the recipe to  try it with flank steak.

We loved this recipe. I am sure a big part is getting a great piece of steak. We served it with mashed potatoes mixed with red onion, sour cream, garlic and shredded cheddar cheese and a salad. Yummy.

OMG. We made this last night and it was so good! Our skirt steak was a little less than 2 pounds so I tweaked the measurements of the other ingredients. Followed the recipe, just about exactly and it came out awesome. Will definitely make this again!.

Made this for dinner last night and we all loved it. We have a blended family with 6 kids between us and pleasing all is quite rare but this marinade was a success. Served with some roasted potatoes (dipped into the sauce from the cooked meat) and we couldnt get enough.

It might of been our cut of skirt steak, but ours was still too tough to eat. And we cut the cooking time to half and it was still well done. The marinade was very tasty, and over all we liked it, but still too tough

Fantastic marinade! I reserved a bit before adding the steak so that I could use it for chicken soon also. The cooking times were spot on. I did leave the bbq sauce off of a couple of pieces in order to taste the marinade on its own too. It was great with and without bbq sauce. I will definitely be making this again.

Have made this on a couple of occasions and have found it to be both easy and tasty.  If you like red meat, this is for you.  My only change is that we eat our meat very rare and modified this to rare.
