My husband raved over this and said it was the best way I had ever cooked it.

Made this many times. Love it. Used the marinade for baked pork chops a few times too.  Just fabulous.

I know the picture does not make the lamb look good, but trust me I had to make it two nights in a row.  Made it for our anniversary.  Wife loved it, my uncle that doesn't like lamb had seconds.  A must try if you like lamb.
