This was a great recipe (as are all of Chef John's)! I made a few additions and took some tips from other reviewers. First, I wanted it to be a more traditional Shepherd's Pie, so I used ground Lamb instead of beef. I diced 1/4 cup onion and 1/2 cup mushrooms and cooked it in with the Lamb as I was browning it. After the meet was finished, I added in a pinch of Thyme, Paprika, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. I then continued with the original recipe. The last thing I did, after the dish was finished baking, I placed it under the broiler for a few minutes to make the cheese on top get nice and crispy.

I did not have any frozen vegetables in my freezer--I improvized. I threw in some chopped onion, chopped fresh zucchini, chopped fresh red pepper, and chopped fresh broccoli to take the place of the frozen vegetables. I also added a teaspoon each of dried oregano and dried basil to the meat/vegetable mixture and I cut back just a touch on the salt. I was able to use my cast iron skillet from beginning to end which I absolutely loved. My husband and two boys really liked this though my kids thought that it could use more cheese and my husband thought it could use more "gravy". Next time, I'll increase both the cheese amounts and "gravy" just a touch. This is absolutely comfort food defined.

Very easy to make, and tasted great. The potatoes were very creamy and flavorful, even with no butter added. The recipe didn't say when to add the salt and pepper, so I added it to the meat mixture. I also salted the water that I boiled the potatoes in. I wasn't sure what size casserole dish to use, but my 2-quart oval casserole worked perfectly. This is a great recipe for a quick, inexpensive meal. I'd like to try it using ground lamb also.

This shepherds pie turned out awsome, the only thing I changed was to add an extra half cup of beef broth as I like a little more gravy. I love that this recipe uses sour cream instead of cream cheese as this is much easier on my wasteline and my wallet and still very flavorful. Thanks for the great recipe :)

Its a keeper!  Its a perfect way of using up leftover mashed potatoes, so that makes it even easier to make.  I skip the sour cream since my leftover mashed potatoes already have butter and milk in them.  I've made this twice now, both times with frozen veggies which works great. I follow the Recipe except I sauteed chopped onion and garlic with the meat, and add about twice as much broth to make more "gravy".  I also add a few shakes of Worcestershire and maybe a little soy sauce to add a zip.  Everything fits into a 2 quart casserole dish perfectly.  Thanks Chef John!

First time making Shepherds Pie and it was a hit. I added about 6 cloves of garlic and 1/4 onion to the meat mixture and used veggie broth instead. I forgot the ketcup which made no difference. After smashig the potatoes I added garlic powder and pepper. The potatoes were so delightful that I make them as a side dish now. There are never any leftovers! 
Thanks John!!

This Shepherds pie was good but the meat was a bit bland.  I added a whole diced onion but next time I would add some garlic and a pinch of cloves to give it more flavour.

If you want a lovely shepherd's pie recipe this is it!  So fast to make, but if you want it even tastier, use Italian sausage in place of the ground beef!!!

This was not a disappointment!  For convenience I used a container of Bob Evans mashed potatoes. I browned the meat with 2 cloves of garlic and about 1/2 C diced onion.  I added 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 tablespoon of worchestershire and an extra tablespoon of ketchup with the beef broth.  Delicious on a cold winter night.

I used broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, celery and mushrooms left over from a veggie tray. Threw in some left over gravy too. So Yummy. Also a hit was green beans with mushrooms. Always a great recipe.

Well...we were really disappointed. The mashed potatoes were okay, but we found the meat mixture to be bland and really didn't like the the sweetness that the ketchup added. We've always loved Chef John's recipes, but this one surprised us in an unfortunate way.

I chose this recipe because it was easy and didn't have too many ingredients.  It was easy to make, for sure.  It could use some more flavor though, and next time I'd add some more spices and maybe some Worcestershire sauce.  Everyone at the table had seconds and even my picky niece that doesn't eat home cooked meals had seconds!  I'd make this again.

I use only 1/2 the amounts, since my purpose of this is to use up my left over mashed potatos, etc, and NOT to make more of them. My bottom layer often consists of bread stuffing,and the filling is 2 cups of chopped turkey and ham and 1 cup of thawed frozen vegetables. The topping is, either mashed white or sweet potato. My family likes the creative approach to making a "shepherds pie". I suggest that everyone become a fan of adjusting the recipe to suit your whim.

This was awesome! Hubby and I both ate until we were stuffed. Very filling meal and tons of leftovers for lunch the next few days. I made it as close to the directions as possible, the only thing I left out was the ketchup. Tasted amazing without it.

Hats off to Chef John once again! I added a bit of worcestershire sauce, some granulated garlic,  and some dried onion because after preparing and tasting the meat mixture, I thought it needed more flavor.   I also used instant potatoes to save some time.  I did not top with cheese, I stirred it  all into the potatoes because I did not like the look of  the cheese melted on top, just my preference.  Turned out to be delicious and would definitely make again.

Really good, but of course some changes...I topped with chipotle smashed potatoes and used a can of drained corn because that is what I had. My guy loved it.

Great recipe! But it lacks so many ingredients. I added Worcestershire sauce, dried parsley, and onions. Other than the seasonings adjustment; this need more moisture, and I feel that 3/4 cup beef broth isn't enough, and next I'll add 1 1/2 cups.

Loved it!! Only thing I didn't like was the potatoes tended to be a bit mushy but that might be because I used reds instead of the ones suggested in the recipe.  I usually prefer reds but next time I'll try the russets for this recipe. (I've never seen yukon gold at my grocery store). I did follow some suggestions and added onion and garlic to the meat while browning. This was awesome, even my potato hating husband liked it and I used the leftovers for two brown bag lunches for me during the week. Reheats very well. Now on my regular rotation, thanks for posting!

I'm not sure if I've reviewed this recipe or not, but if I did, it's so yummy, it deserves TWO 5 star ratings! My husband is of Irish descent and I love to make Irish food whenever I can. I stumbled upon this recipe when I was looking for a good Irish dish to make that we haven't tried yet. I have to say that this was so very drool worthy! I did add a few things to the mashed potatoes to make them creamier, like milk, but that's the only thing I changed. YUM!

Very good basic Shepherds Pie recipe.  I added some diced onion,celery, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, and kicked it up a notch by adding some horseradish which really spiced it up without changing the basic taste. (hubby doesn't like things bland)  I also used fresh veggies, except for the corn.  Really liked the sour cream in the potatoes.  Hubby said keep this one in the rotation.

It was okay.  We didn't like the ketchup sweetness of it and it needed more savory flavor.  The potatoes were good. (Not a deduction in stars but technically a "shepherd's pie" name indicates a lamb dish.  I believe it would be more indicative of the meat used if it were named "cottage pie".

My husband doesn't like sour cream so I used some milk instead.  I also used ground turkey instead of beef.  It was very good but...I would use just peas and corn next time and I would add more spices.  We enjoyed it and I will make it again.  Add a salad and it's a great winter "feel good" meal.

This is a standard shep pie. It's good but not extraordinary. We used frozen peas and fresh cut diced carrots for the frozen veg. Thanks Chef John

Used half turkey half beef.  Do just beef next time and add 1-2 T of Worchestershire sauce for some zip.

My kids said it was good but my Hubby and I did not care for it.  I did add in onion, garlic, some seasoning to meat per other suggestions.  It was a bit greasy and I did drain the meat which was 85% lean.

This shepherds pie was delicious. I added salt to the meat mixture and the mashed potatoes since the recipe did not say when to add the salt. This is completely different from the shepherds pie I grew up on but as equally delicious. Definitely a keeper in my recipe box.

Loved it! I added a chopped onion to the hamburger meat when I browned it. And I forgot to add garlic, so I just added some garlic salt instead. It was so good!

Very tasty....good base recipe. You can really use this as a guide and use what you've got on hand. I used sliced leeks, corn, green beans, carrots and celery for the veggies, which I sautéed in about a tablespoon of butter. Added about one tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and 2 t. Chopped fresh parsley with broth mixture. Also added white pepper and two tablespoons butter to potato topping and eliminated cheddar.  The whole family enjoyed this. Thanks so much!

This was great. I started by sauteing diced red onion and diced fresh carrot then added the ground beef. I followed the remained of the recipe adding chopped green chile at the end. We love green chile. I finished the dish under the broiler. This is an excellent recipe to get your vegi fix.

Tasty, tasty!  I made this with leftover pot roast the I diced.  I did add a pinch of celery salt, about 1 tbsp fresh rosemary finely diced, and a shake of oregano.  Since I had no drippings from the pot roast, I made a rue of beef broth and flour to thicken up the added beef broth.  Very tasty.  the boyfriend requested a repeat of this recipe!

This was a hit! After reading over some reviews I decided to add the worchester sauce to taste. I also omitted out the flour and added a package of dry brown gravy which added that perfect consistency of gravy and taste! Served with cheddar biscuits. Definitely a keeper for comfort food on a cold winter night.

Wonder Shepherds Pie!  It’s obviously a modified American version of an old fashioned favorite.  I added some onion & garlic, seasoned all layers with salt & pepper and will definitely make it again.

My family and I LOVE this recipe! The beef mixture just needs more flavor. I have tweaked this recipe for more flavor. Added 1/4 minced onion to the ground beef when frying. Drain grease! Used bag of frozen peas/carrots steamed in microwave. Meat mixture: 1 cup peas/carrots; Increased to 1/2  C of ketchup; added 2 dash’s Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 tsp salt. Sprinkled cheddar cheese on top of meat mixture. Used 1 container Bob Evans mashed potatoes prepared. Baked 20 minutes and then topped with cheddar cheese for 5 minutes or less
Will double this recipe from now on to last longer. It’s a delicious winter dish.

Great recipe to use as a base.  I added a few things.  First, a small pinch of Rosemary, a few shakes of worchestershire, cup of carrots, 1 stalk of cellery, a whole red onion diced, half cup of frozen corn, a can of diced tomatos, and a couple shakes of hot sauce.  Its not quite like John or mom meant it to be but its great :)

This is a good, easy, comfort food recipe.  I was doing a trial run before I made it in larger quantities for a crowd, and I'm glad I did, because the  ingredient list called for salt and pepper, but nowhere in the recipe were instructions when to add them.  I added them to the vegetable mixture, and I also added a couple teaspoons salt to the water when cooking the potatoes, which is what I usually do when boiling potatoes.  The seasoning seemed about right that way.  The potatoes  were good with the sour cream and cheese, but I thought there should have been more, maybe 2 pounds instead of 1.25 pounds of potatoes.  I could not completely cover the veggies.  I used a 32 oz. bag of frozen mixed vegetables, and that worked well, although my personal preference would have been just peas and carrots and no green beans.  I cooked this in a 9.5x13.5 casserole dish, and that was the right size for this.

It was delicious-good old comfort food, a real rib sticker. I’m not sure that the sour cream and cheese enhances the potatoes as we might have thought but nonetheless, it was a hit!

Loved this recipe with the changes I made. I sauteed 1 onion, 5 medium mushrooms and a can of corn instead of the frozen mixed veggies. I left out the ketchup but didn't add any other tomato product as I'm sensitive to the the acid.
I can see this as a great base to start with and making other vegetable substitutes.
My 4 star rating was because of the veggies and ketchup.

Instead of using meat drippings, I cooked up the beef with 4 slices of chopped bacon. I also substituted sour cream with light sour cream and added 2 tablespoons of almond milk to the potatoes. Substituted ketchup with an organic sugar free ketchup and think next time I'll add more. Lastly I used 50% cheese substitute with regular cheese so that it wasn't so much dairy and more variety. Great recipe! I think I found my parent's favorite dish to cook for them.

I kick it up a notch by adding a teaspoon or so of gravy master to the beef and vegetables mixture.  I also use more potatoes about double for a thicker topping.  I keep the original cheese and sour cream measurements though.   Delicious!

I made this tonight for dinner and it was excellent. The only changes I made was to add a chopped onion with the hamburger. Also I drained the fat from the hamburger and added an extra cup of beef broth.  Thought it was best to lower the fat content . The pie was so delicious. Seasoning perfect . I will definitely be making this again.

This is a great recipe - simple and tasty! My dad lives alone and doesn’t cook much, so I try to make him some dishes that he can easily take out of the freezer and heat up. This is one I do regularly.. I triple the recipe and get mini loaf foil pans to make individual servings. I just make the mashed potatoes as I normally would with some butter, milk, sour cream, and salt and pepper. I throw foil over the tins and put them in the freezer. Perfect!

I used fresh carrots, should have cooked them first.  Mixed chorizo and jalepenos with the beef for a little kick.

The concept is good, but the frozen veggies killed it for me. I WILL make it again, only using fresh veggies and probably less potatoes on top.

Made this in my cast iron dutch oven. It was the best one I’ve ever made. The only ingredient I didn’t use was the ketchup. I layered this starting with the mashed on the bottom, then cheese, the meat/veggie mixture. Repeated 3x’s. Make enough mashed potatoes if layering because I ran out for the top and had to whip up another batch ;)

This recipe was awesome already but we added was some A-1 thick and hearty steak sauce to give it a nice tangy taste.

I thought it was easy enough to make...but I agree that it was a bit bland and next time I make it, I’ll add some onion to the meat mixture. It would be good to also add a little ground sausage so their will be more gravy. My lean ground hamburger meat made very little.  T he directions should include size pan to use and when and where to use the salt and pepper. I put it in with the meat since the potatoes had the sour cream for taste and just added a little salt to them.

Sooo...I made the recipe as is...except doubled it and used half ground beef/half ground turkey but, then lost my mind and went rogue. Added in review suggestions of thyme and worchestershire; if I would have stopped right there everything would have been great.  Then I added skosh too much of smoked paprika and it overpowered everything. Will def make again but will leave out the paprika.

A total comfort food.  I made it with ground beef, and probably a bit short on the veggies as I only had a small bag in the freezer.  When I tasted the filling it seemed a bit bland so I added about 1/2 tsp. of Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder.  I didn't have garlic cloves so potato topping was minus the garlic.  Easy to make and one could easily use ready-made potatoes from the refrigerated case at the grocery store if you don't have or want to take the time to boil them and mash them yourself.

Yum! For those who found this bland, it may have been your stock. I find supermarket stock woefully inadequate and save bones in my freezer to make my own. But even though I started with good stock, I like lots of umami, so added 1 t each of soy sauce, Better than Bouillon, and Worcestershire sauce. *** My OH wanted cream corn, so I added 0.4 C cream and 1 C corn. (Alas, he would not let me add peas and carrots.) *** I left out the ketchup b/c I thought that would be weird with the cream. *** I also added perhaps 1/4 t Italian seasoning to both the stock and the potatoes. *** I wanted to prep this during my lunch break and have it ready for dinner, so instead of baking in the oven I cooked it in my slow cooker for 3 hours, leaving the lid somewhat ajar after the first hour to forestall soupiness. *** I've been making cottage pie for decades and with this recipe and my tweaks, it was the best ever!

Good comfort food for a rainy day! I did use Bob Evans refrigerated mashed potatoes with sour cream and chives to save time. And I added diced onion + garlic - it just seemed wrong to brown ground beef without them. Everything came together nicely,  the ground beef filling was nicely seasoned, and the cheese on top made a good crust.

Absolutely 5 STAR!  Chef John always has great recipes.  Very easy to prepare.  Didn’t have garlic cloves so added minced garlic to potatoes during the “smash”.  Used ground beef with onion & a couple cans of carrots & peas drained as vegetables.  Simple & delicious reminding me of being stationed in England!  Thank you Chef John!

This is a keeper. Used grass fed non GMO ground sirloin and it was so tasty.  Loved that it's a one dish mean. Used frozen organic green beans, carrots and peas from Costco. Only change I made was add more cheese on top which is our preference.

You need to spice this up a little bit, add about 3/4 of a cup of sangria from Spain n 1 quarter cup of Worcestershire sauce. Sprinkle the beef with cilantro n 1 teaspoon of brown sugar. Oh yeah don't forget a little bit of a Oregano.

I have made this several times thus far for my family, who all like it very much — especially as the evenings get colder. As far as the structure of meat, veggies and gravy, this is wonderful. I do cheat and use some garlic instant mashed potatoes for the topping due to both time and ease of spreading. The seasoning, though, is not adequate, and I’ve taken to adding either chopped or powdered onion, garlic, seasoned salt, salt and pepper, and Worcestershire sauce in various combinations. Red wine or sherry would probably taste good, too, though I’ve not tried these.  great supper dish that additional seasoning.

This was pretty simple to put together and was very delicious. Even though I doubled the recipe, there was not enough left the next day for lunches. The only change I made was due to not having a bag of frozen mixed vegetables;I used a 3/4 c chopped broccoli crowns and 1/2c canned (rinsed & drained) peas. 

Has already been requested to make again next week

I changed the potatoes to mashed cauliflower because we are on paleo. I used leftover homemade beef gravy instead of tomato paste because we like beef flavor over tomato.  Chef Johns recipes are excellent to work with. I just adapt to my family’s taste. This one is always a hit.

This recipe is awesome.  I did add more ketchup along with sugar.  I add sugar to a lot of recipes like sauces for lasagna and jambalaya.  You would not believe how sugar makes sauces with meat taste better.  The sugar in this recipe made it really good. I fried the ground beef with a large chopped onion which added a lot of flavor.  This recipe is a keeper and thank you Chef John.

This is a good base of a recipe. However, you have to season the ground beef with salt, pepper, onion, worcheshire sauce and beef seasoning. I also added a bit more cheese to the top and used mixed veggies instead of just peas. We didn’t have any leftovers.

I added 1/2 medium onion chopped small with the hamburger, seasoned with Morton nature’s seasoning and fresh ground pepper, to taste. When browned pour into casserole dish. heat up 1, 12 oz bag of frozen corn and 2 cans of no salt added creamed corn till bubbly spread on top of beef. Then top with potatoes mashed with butter and whole milk . Top with pats of butter and bake till browned on top. Serve with shredded cheese of your choice.

No changes, other than Nature’s Seasoning instead of salt and pepper.  Made for three kids but the adults enjoyed it just as much!

Thanks Chef John, it was an excellent and simple meal.  I used instant potatoes because my wife had a lot of them left over from another meal.  She had used beef bouillon instead of water when she made them.  I had a pound and a half of Pork Loin left over also, so I ground it up and used that instead of beef.  I used bouillon for the broth and  doubled it, then let it reduce to let all the flavors blend together and to cook the frozen veggies all the way through.  The flavor was just wonderful!

Quite good! I made it as directed except I added a small onion while cooking the ground turkey. I also used one add'l tablespoon of ketchup and 1 add'l cup of beef broth along with a shake of worcestershire sauce. I was able to use up quite a few things from the fridge and make a delicious dinner.

The meat vegetable base was tasty and thick, to my liking, but I might reduce the ketchup to two tablespoons next time. I prefer standard mashed potatoes rather than tangy, and two out of three grandchildren left the potatoes on their plate. I’d give it a five if we had liked the topping. Chef John left the seasonings out of the directions, so I used 1/4 tsp pepper in the base and the remainder in the potatoes. I used the tsp salt in the potato water, and a 1/4 tsp extra while whisking them.

I made this the other night for my kids and parents. Everyone loved it. I added a third tablespoon of ketchup because it was a little dry after I cooked the meat and vegetables. otherwise, best shepherd pie I've made and my mom said the same thing. I will be making this again.

This is now in my regular rotation, so good!! When the meat is partly cooked I add onion, garlic, mushrooms, carrots, herbs. Then frozen peas before baking. I also added crunchy topping on top of the potato layer: 1/2 cup breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup grated cheese, and 1/4 cup olive oil. It's a winner!

Like others, I made a few revisions, mostly to suit my own tastes. I added only 1 T. of catsup and salt and peppered the mashed potatoes. I chopped up a small onion and the garlic and added it to the hamburger. I also added some onion powder, salt, pepper, a couple shakes of Worcester sauce, and a shake of thyme to the meat mixture. Make sure to use LEAN beef! I saw a complaint by someone that it turned out greasy, and that’s because the meat wasn’t low fat. When I make it again, I think I’ll add more potatoes. All in all, it was delicious!

As I was making this, it seemed dry so I doubled the beef broth and the ketchup. It seemed pretty bland tasting, so I added a couple teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce, as well. My family loved it with the additions. Adding the extra liquid really made a difference in the leftovers. They were perfect, too!

This was delicious!   The only modifications I made to the recipe was that I browned the ground beef with an onion and I also used 2 lbs. of ground beef instead of only one to make it more substantial.

I usually do not change Chef John's recipes although I did slightly on this one even prior to reading reviews. I used 4 cloves of garlic, added 1/2 cup more of beef broth, used 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder in the meat and added a little milk to the potatoes. It was delicious! It brought back memories of me as a little girl getting into trouble at the dinner table for mixing my veges and meat with my mashed potatoes as it was perceived as playing with my food. Little did I know, I was a budding Shepard's Pie fan!  Thanks, Chef. You truly are the BEST!

Everyone loved it, and the kids went back for seconds. Filling and satisfying. This will make our regular meal rotation.

We used different veggies because I think peas were created by the devil and might use a another potato or two.

This was really good and easy to  make. 
I used ground turkey as that's what I had on hand.
I used 2 cups of frozen peas and about 1 cup of "Asian" veggies (frozen) that I had on hand.  
I did NOT use 4 cups of veggies as it seemed like it would be too much and and throw off the meat/veggie ratio.
I just used russet potatoes as I didn't have Yukon Golds on hand.
I didn't see in the instructions as to where to use the salt, so I just salted the meat a little as it was cooking in the frying pan, and salted the potatoes a little after mashing them.  Same with pepper -- put some on the meat.

It came out great!  I had a hungry man who came home to it  and he was mighty pleased.

Always a winner! I've made this at least 10 times and so far everyone who's tried it loved it. I add a little worcheshire when browning the meat.

I WILL make this again! I liked that Chef John made the gravy during the recipe instead of using a gravy mix. I added some spices  to the meat mixture such as fresh garlic, salt, and pepper. I also added fresh garlic to the potatoes while mashing them. Also once I finished the meat mixture it didn’t have enough gravy so I added beef broth and let it cook a bit more. It thinkened up just fine. I do wish I had added oregano, but all in all it was a success. Enjoy!

So bland. Tasted it before putting mashed potatoes on top and thought it was terrible.  Ketchup added a sweetness that I hated.  Added a little bit of Worcestershire to try to save it which helped a little but most of it went into the garbage.  Also,  vegetables came out under cooked with recommended cook times.

I will make this again. I didn’t make any changes to the ingredients, but I used leftover mashed potatoes so it didn’t take long to put together. It is just as good reheated the next day and two days later. Chef John recipes are always winners.

Great comfort food that binds the family together.   I used it as the starting point and then added spices, BBQ sauces, mushrooms, pepper jack cheese, etc. to give it a little more kick.   I liked learning the trick about adding flour to the ground beef to aid in the thickening of the beef sauce and have used that in other recipes.   Would recommend readers give it a shot knowing they can adapt it to their own dietary restrictions and preferences.    It doubles/triples nicely.   Allow more time to heat through - you may want to only make a thin layer of potatoes in the center so it heats through more quickly.

My family really likes this.  I replaced the ketchup with barbecue sauce for more kick, added onion to the beef and used corn instead of mixed veggies.  You may consider adding a little salt to the potato mash.

This is a childhood classic where I wasn’t sure if it would taste as good as my moms, it actually tasted better. It was so good. I made it for my mom and family and others were asking for the recipe.

I loved this recipe. My husband recently got full dentures and this was very easy to eat. I followed the directions but had to improvise with a package of buttery mashed potatoes. Still added the cheese and sour cream. It's great every time but the 15 minutes wait time is a must. Lots of liquid on the top once it's out of the oven.  I'll make this again for sure.

Great recipe.  Used instant mashed potatoes instead of the recipe listed one.  Other than slight spice additions, recipe is solid.  I will definitely be using this again.  Family loved it.

I doubled the recipe for our crew of 8 & had just a little bit left over! It was that good! My only adjustments were: I didn't add the ketchup, I used apple juice instead of beef broth (didn't have any on hand), I used organic full -fat sour cream. I will definitely make again & again!

Wow!! We have never had shepherds pie before and I have to admit my husband was very skeptical about it as he watched me make it. We had SO much leftover mashed potatoes from our thanksgiving dinner this weekend that I was looking for something to do with them. This was perfect!  I sautéed a diced onion after I browned the meat, I added the flour and garlic, then the broth, ketchup  & I used leftover corn. I had to rehydrate the potatoes using a little chicken broth then I added the cheese and topped the meat. My 1 daughter & husband had 4 helpings! We have a small spoon leftover, they loved it. Excellent recipe even using some leftovers!! Thank you again Chef John!!

We enjoyer this Shepherds pie recipe very much. The only change was we added about 1/2 cup of broccoli, because we were short of frozen mixed vegetables. My granddaughter Millie May assisted grandpa Jack with all ingredients. We had a great time fixing this comfort food dish on a snowy Veterans Day.

Oh my.  I had bad memories as a child with Shepherd's Pie.  Decided to finally make one, as my boyfriend loves it.  Found this recipe, and I must say, it was amazing!!  I added an onion into the ground beef, more garlic into the finished product.  I used seriously sharp cheese for the potatoes, and made the mashed potatoes with the normal butter and milk, still adding the sour cream.  Holy Moly!  What a keeper!!

Yep... awesome as always.  I would add quite a bit of salt to the mixture, because it can be a bit bland imo.  If salt is at the table though, nobody is going to complain.  Thanks chef John!

I browned the ground beef with chopped onions, chopped garlic, diced carrots, diced bell peppers and peas. Instead of ketchup I used worstershire sauce, in addition I made brown gravy and topped the layer of ground beef mixture with half of the gravy and then poured the rest over the mashed potatoes layer. Everyone loved it!

I've never been disappointed by a Chef John recipe before, but this shepherd's pie was surprisingly bland -- beef broth and ketchup alone really didn't give it any special flavor.  I also would have preferred fewer frozen veggies, but that's an easy fix for next time. Last, the recipe calls for 1 t. of salt, but the directions don't say where to add it.

On the plus  side, I thought the Yukon Gold potatoes worked really well for the topping. The sour cream and cheese made the potatoes firm enough to make a solid top crust, while leaving them soft enough to spread. 

The recipe fit in my 2-qt casserole dish, barely! :-)  I put the casserole on a cookie sheet in case it dribbled, which it did. 

I like the potato topping enough that I'll play with the beef mixture to improve the flavor.

I NEVER tweak a chef John recipe. There’s no need too. This is great, as all his recipes are. I trust his recipes, and never try to make it “better”. Anything I google a recipe for, I always write chef John after it, and see if he has one. If not, then I use others, and will tweak to my liking. I still have yet to make something of his that I didn’t like. His indoor bbq ribs are my favorite. Friends and family won’t even get ribs out Bc if they want them, they have me make them the way he does. Great job yet again chef John!!!

Very easy and quick. Liked it better the second time.  Added just a couple of shakes of Worcestershire.  Used Idaho golds instant potatoes, but added the cheese and sour cream.  Great comfort food during a chilly week.   Best of all, the hubs really liked it.  Thanks, Chef John.

I've made this a handful of times. First time I made it, I did just as the recipe called for. 
I loved it. The family loved it. My coworkers loved it. 

The second time I made it, I seasoned my meat while cooking before throwing in the veggies and broth. Added more garlic and threw some onion in there as well. 

I'd have it either way. It's really good.

Excellent - my only change was making twice as much gravy (used whole can of stock and twice the fat/butter).  Oh and used turkey burger.  Tasted great - even my picky father loved it!
Made it again but with venison. Doubled the recipe, used leftover gravy and mashed taters from a different meal. Just as good - fed 9 people, they all scarfed it down. Love this recipe - so filling and tasty.

I made this last night, we really enjoyed it.  As the instructions are written it was a bit bland.  I realized I hadn’t added the two teaspoons of salt, in the ingredients list.  I re-read the instructions and realized where things went wrong, there is no mention of where or when the salt is added.  If I had remembered the salt it wouldn’t have been a problem, adding some to the potatoes and some to the meat mixture would’ve worked fine.  I was just so focused on following the instructions closely I never even noticed I hadn’t added it.

I didn't have any cheddar and used some nacho cheese and put too much in it - once I got passed the cheese it was great - will have another go at it this week with some different cheese - should be great - rated it a 4 but the reason it's a 4 four has to do with operator error haha

I made it as close as possible to the recipe, with just a few substitutions due to ingredients on hand (tomato sauce for the ketchup, butter for part of the sour cream).  I put some salt in the beef mixture and some in the potatoes.  It took about an hour total.  Easy, delicious and satisfying.  And my child ate his vegetables for once.

This recipe was very tasty.  I loved the flavor and texture, it was very easy to make.  My husbands comment was that he would have liked more "gravy" in it.  I will adjust that the next time I make it.

Very good and easy to make! Delicious and comforting dish! No need for a separate baking dish if you have a deep cast iron skillet! Since I used lean ground turkey, there was very little grease to drain out. I did make alterations as I typically find the meat in Shepherd's Pie recipes (ground beef/ground turkey) need more seasoning. Sauteed 1 clove of garlic, minced and 1 small onion diced, added the ground turkey, and seasoned meat with salt n pepper, thyme, and usually add a little marjoram, but ended up using a little savory. Mashed potatoes: used stainless steel pot to boil potatoes, drain water, place potatoes back in the same pot and proceeded to make the mashers--just let them sit in the pot until ready to use. After meat+veggies were combined, I spread the mashed potatoes on top of the meat, grated cheese on top and into the oven the cast iron went. Perfect and less dishes to wash is always a bonus!

My picky eaters loved this dish. My changes just based on what I like...I added 1 small chopped onion and garlic powder with my chop meat cooking them together. I used 1 package of frozen succotash because that is what I had on hand which was 2 cups and that was plenty of veggie for this dish. I also used a 1.5lb package of premade homestyle mashed potato and just spread that on top of the meat and then sprinkled 1/2 cup of the cheese on top. I used a 9x13 and did bake it covered turned out amazing.

Very flavorful!  I didn't have frozen veggies so I just chopped up carrots, onion and celery.  Oh, and added a dash of Worcestershire, but not much, because we like food with s little kick. I love Chef John's recipes!  I wish I was Mrs. Chef John. Lol.

Delicious!  I did make this with ground turkey, 1 cup of chicken broth, a whole chopped onion, and an additional 2 cloves of minced garlic though.  Next time I'll probably make it without the sour cream though because I didn't really like the flavor of the mashed potatoes on their own (all mixed up was fine).  Even my picky 2 year old was loving it!

I added garlic powder, onion powder and chopped onions. I also left the skin on the potatoes. I then turned on the broiler until the cheese on top was lightly brown. It was fantastic.

Easy, tasty, and inexpensive.  Some of my favorite things in a meal.  I used instant cheese flavored mashed potatoes instead of mashing my own because I was in a hurry and I left out the garlic due to an allergy, but it was still very good.

Delicious!  I used fresh green beans and carrots and boiled them for about 10 minutes before adding them to the meat mixture.

I took this dish to an Irish meal for St. Patrick's day and I doubled it for the crowd. Unfortunately I thought the meat portion of this dish was quite bland. The next time I made it with HP sauce instead of ketchup and  it was still pretty bland. It's almost like it needs to be a bit more vinegar-y? Maybe next time I'll try half ketchup and half A-1 sauce? Or half ketchup, half BBQ sauce? Also, if you like it with a bit more gravy in the meat, add a bit more beef broth.

I always adjust seasonings according to my family's preferences, adding a bit of onion and sweet peppers with  the mixed veggies.  We all had second helpings and agree that this recipe is a keeper. Thanks, Chef John!

As usual, Chef John's recipe is a winner. Not so usual, I made adjustments without trying it "as is" first. I used 1/4 cup beef stock and 1/2 cup Guinness for the liquid. I used ground beef instead of lamb (don't care for lamb), and I have found that Guinness and beef are a marriage made in heaven. I also had a couple strips of bacon left over from breakfast and crumbled them on top of the potatoes along with the Dubliner cheese. Love shepherd's pie, and this will be my go to recipe from now on.

I didn't have frozen veggies, except southwestern styled, which are spicey & some onion & can peas.  It was good put shouldn't have used peas.  The main thing was ,it was still bland.  Also used Worcestershire  sauce. Will try again but add a lot of seasoning.

Turned out great. Minor adjustments- I used russet potatoes ( all I had on hand).  I also doubled the flour ketchup and broth for more gravy.

This is very good.  I made this the first time as Chef John instructed.  The second time I made the lamb using the Kofta Kebabs recipe (listed on Allrecipes), layered frozen mixed vegs, and added parmesan cheese to the freshly mashed potatoes. Delicious.

Because we had so many garden veggies from our CSA, we made a few changes to use more veggies.  Used fresh corn, carrots, garden celery,  frozen peas, and an onion.  With all the veggies, The meat mixture needed  more flavor, so I added about 2 tbsp of Worcestershire and 2 tbsp of Maggi seasoning.  Love chef john!!!

As with most all of Chef John's recipes, spot-on as is! The ONLY real deviation from the recipe was that I left the ground beef mixture in the cast iron skillet and topped with the potatoes and in the oven it went. Kids loved it and only were sad there wasn't "pie" for dessert, too!

A great and easy recipe. I added diced mushrooms and onions to the browning beef. Then added a few dashes of paprika, thyme, and worstershire as others suggested. Only addition I would make next time is a salt.

Perfect bland, nutritious meal post-surgery.  I added seasoning to my portions.  Had to leave the flour out for gluten-free.  I did add onions and garlic.  Used frozen veggies:  One cup of corn, one cup of string beans and two cups of peas.  Used refrigerated mashed potatoes nuked per directions.  Turned up the heat to 450 after following directions because it just wouldn't brown.  Turned out very good and delicious.

I have a large family so I usually use a pound and a half of beef and adjust accordingly plus add Worcestershire to the mix. When I'm in a hurry I use Idahoan instant potatoes as they come in many different flavours so it changes it up easily. A family dinner regular

I loved this dish!!  So easy to make!!  I used some frozen veggies and some canned.  I did not have any sour cream so had to leave that out.  I used instant potatoes and added some powdered garlic!  It was simple, and yummy!  Chef John I'm loving your dishes!  2nd dish this week from you and hubby and I are very pleased!!! Thank you!

I didn't put 4 cups of vegetables in. Way too much! I was very happy to find a Shepherd's Pie recipe that didn't have cream of anything soup in it. This didn't disappoint. I added some garlic to the ground beef. Will definitely make again.

My dh is 100% Irish, but he doesn't like lamb. So for Paddy's day, I made this using lean ground beef. I did not need to use the initial butter and olive oil to brown the meat and thicken the sauce. I did substitute beef broth for the water. I did not have fresh rosemary so used dried. I also doubled the mashed potatoes. Everyone loved this!

We liked this.

I did cheat by buying the mashed potatoes already made in the refrigerated section (not the powdered ones!).  They were almost exactly the same weight as the uncooked amount of Yukon golds that recipe called for, so it did save me a bit of time.  I simply warmed them in the microwave and added just a little milk to make them spread smoothly.  Easy, perfect substitution.

Other than the potatoes, I followed the recipe as written, which I almost always do the first time I make something.   Once we tasted it, just a very light sprinkling of salt was used at the dinner table.  I didn't add it while cooking since the it called for beef broth which can make things a little too salty. 

My only complaint?   We would have liked a thicker layer of the potatoes,  but that is a family preference as we love mashed potatoes.  We finished off the pan with no leftovers, so it must have been good.  

We will definitely adjust the salt and amount of potatoes to our taste, but this is a keeper!

I love all of Chef John's recipes, so when I wanted a Shepherd's Pie recipe, his was at the top of my list.  The only change that I made was I added chopped onion to the ground beef as I had a half an onion left over from something else I made that morning.  I think that the next time  I make it, I will also add mushrooms to the ground beef.
This is comfort food at its finest!

I was not impressed with this recipe.  The potatoes dissolved into the gravy and I didn't care for the consistency as I am used to a Shepard's pie with a more solid potato consistency. .

I made this because I happened to have all the ingredients and it seemed not too difficult. It was a delicious, quick casserole, and the recipe is very forgiving and adaptable. I made only minimal changes. I added dried onion and garlic powder to the meat mixture. I used small red potatoes, and just mashed them with the skins still on. I made more of the gravy mix, and lastly and I suggest this for everyone, I added Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. It is heavenly comfort food on a cold night!

Made this tonight!  It was yummy but it needs more spices and I added onions. Make sure you salt and pepper the meat mixture and the potatoes before compiling.

Great recipe! I made it as is except for adding a tablespoon of Worcestershire for a little extra flavor! Very simple recipe and will make again and again. I may try adding a few other seasonings next time just to see if I can give it a little more flavor but really it's absolutely fine as is.

Fantastic! I was never a fan of Shepherds pie as I found it to be dull but the men in my family requested it. I stuck to this recipe except for the following: I added chopped onion, used a tiny bit of "Better than Bouillon", and a tiny bit of curry powder in with the browning meat. It was so flavorful and delicious! The guys ate the entire thing and raved about it all weekend!

Fantastic recipe! I didn't add veggies to mine because of some picky eaters in my house, but even with just the meat and potatoes it was yummy! It's all about the gravy for this dish, in my opinion! I make it all the time! Thank you!

mmm ~ very good Chef!  Love it, will make again!  

Of course I added a bit of my own tweaks like cayenne pepper, onion salt, garlic salt, pepper, thyme, Worchestershire, & celery seed to bump up the meat mixture a bit, also used as much beef broth as I saw fit- I didn't measure. I used frozen vegies as recommended and a can of cream corn. Oh and lots of CHEESE!  
This was the best shepherds pie recipe I have ever found!

Thank You & keep these wonderful recipes coming!

This was a nice recipe that my husband liked too. I think next time we will try it with lamb. We used mixed fresh vegetables that we sauteed in butter. Our mixed vegetables were garlic, spoon-sized onions, baby carrots, chopped celery, and mushrooms. In the ground beef we used a dash of garlic powder and worcestershire sauce. Once the beef and vegetables were in the pan, I used a half can of cream of celery soup (and a little water) to spinkle over the beef and vegetables to keep the pie from being too dry. We used lebnah in the mashed potatoes as we were unable to find sour cream. We sprinkled sharp cheddar cheese on top and ate the meal with a hearty wheat bread and some fresh garden rocket. Will make this recipe again.

Great recipe, save the drippings and add the flour in the pan, the sour cream, great ideas, very nice.  The second time around, I cut the ketchup by a 1/3 and added 2 tablespoons of HP Sauce.  Worked for me.  Next time, instead, some crushed chilies for a little more heat.
