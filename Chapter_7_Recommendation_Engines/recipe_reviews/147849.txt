I wasn't a fan of this...it didn't clump together like granola should. Perhaps if more honey was added?

Well, it IS high fiber, I'll give it that! And it is kind of growing on me as I snack on it. I added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to the cereal before adding the honey mixture, which I think it really needed (it could probably stand even more) to give some flavor. I also used salted butter rather than vegetable oil. If you use oil, a dash of salt would help the flavor too. I followed the cooking times exactly and I think mine tastes like it was just on the edge of burning, so watch carefully.
