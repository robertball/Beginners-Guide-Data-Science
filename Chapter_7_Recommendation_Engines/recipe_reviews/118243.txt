I found this recipe & a bag of bread flour in my pantry 2 weeks ago & have made it every day since.  It is SOOOOOO easy, soft, chewy, puffs up fluffy & I don't even have a bread machine!  Here's how I do it...Preheat your oven to 150* then turn the heat OFF  (this is where your bread will rise, leave the oven light on)  Mix sugar & yeast in 105* water, let proof for 5 min. while I stir (by hand) the flour & salt together in my kitchen aid mixer bowl.  Then, using the dough hook on the lowest speed, pour water mixture into flour & let it knead for 8 minutes.  If the dough is dry & flakey after 1 min. of mixing, add a scant tbsp of water.  Dough should be smooth & elastic after 8 min.  Put in greased bowl, cover with a warm, damp towel & put in the slightly warm oven that is OFF.  Let rise until doubled, 30-60 min.  Now just follow the original recipe, returning the loaf to the OFF oven for it's second rise. :o)  Tossing a few ice cubes in once in a while works great for a crispy crust.  The more often you throw them in, the crispier the crust...your choice.  I always form just one large loaf & don't bother with the cornmeal, although it's good that way too.  Thank you for an amazing recipe!

you can add 1 tablespoon of olive oil
this will soften the dough and add a 
cuople of days of shelf life..that is if it ever lasts that long!

This is delicious!  The directions on this recipe are very good.  I needed to add the extra 2 Tbsp. of water to the bread machine so I'm so glad that was mentioned.  The only thing I would add is to spray the sides of the oven with water about 4 or 5 times right after you place the baking sheet in.  This will crisp up the crust nicely.  I'm going to make this again this week to use for french bread pizza.  Great recipe!

Followed someone else's advice and threw ice cubes in the bottom of the oven just after I put the bread in the oven.  It made the crust really crunchy with a nice chewy middle.  Very good.  I'm using it in a French toast casserole too.

I made this in my KA mixer.  This is an easy and "fast" (as yeast goes) French bread.    I proofed the yeast with the water 110 degrees and the sugar for 10 minutes.  Started adding the flour on low speed. Added the salt and 1 Tablespoon olive oil.  Kept adding more flour 1/2 cup at a time.  I used about 3 cups flour.  Kneaded on medium speed 6 - 8 minutes until dough pulled away from the side of the bowl and was smooth and silky.    Turned dough out and let rise in a greased bowl.  Took about an hour to double in size.  Turn dough out on to light floured board and let rest for 10 minutes.  Cut in half and I stretched the dough into 8 x 10 rectangle.  I roll one up starting with the long edge and it was more like a baggette.  The other I stretched and rolled from the short edge, tucking the ends in and it was more like a French Bread.    I covered and let rise a second time, until doubled.  Baked in a preheated oven on a baking stone for 25 minutes.   Internal temp should be about 180 - 200 degrees.  Cool on wire rack for at least 20 minutes.  Great Bread!  Thank you.

This is a really good bread, and very easy.  I didn't use a bread machine....just mixed the dough and let it rise for 40 minutes before shaping into loaves.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour with the white.  I loved the suggestions about the ice cubes in the oven.....worked great!  The bread was gobbled up by my family.  Thanks!

Fantastic!!  My husband and I were both impressed that I could make homemade French bread.  I was a little worried because it was hard to roll out but it turned out great.  It took a lot longer for the second rise, but it was a cold day.  This was everything French bread should be - crusty on the outside, and soft and chewy on the inside.  I did not use seasame seeds - didn't have them, and probably would not use them if I did have them.  I will never buy French bread again.  Thanks for the post.

I made this for dinner last night. They were a big hit. I made them into bread sticks and we dipped them into our potato soup. Soooo good. I made a double batch ( I have 5 kids ). With half the batch I put garlic powder and italian seasonings in the batter. Then on all of them after I put egg wash on them, I sprinkled garlic salt and parsley on top. Big hit with the family!!!! A keeper! Thank you for sharing.

This is the best bread recipe I've ever made. I made one large loaf and baked about 35 minutes. It did take longer to rise because of the change. I wanted larger slices for sandwiches, but I guess I'll have to make another loaf as it's disappearing quickly.

This recipe is exceptionally good, just fabulous. When I tried it, it was not rated yet so I was worried. Anyways this is my fianc√©s favorite type of bread and it really was magnificent. It was perfect in consistency and flavor. I used regular sesame seeds not toasted. I put ice in the bottom of the oven and half way through I threw some snow on the bottom of oven, which worked out great. I could not find a spray bottle that is why I used the snow. The next morning I sliced it thin to make French toast, it was wonderful. This will be on the top of my list for making bread from now on.

Easy recipe...dumped everything into bread maker as listed on recipe.  Very good.  I let the bread rise double the time and baked it, let it cool and sliced it and used the Garlic Butter from this site and put it in the freezer to freeze the butter and bagged all of it.  Now I can pull out a few pieces and cook them in the oven at 350 for 10 min anytime I need some bread.  Thank you for the wonderful and easy recipe!

This is just your basic french bread recipe.  very easy and very nice.  One thing, though:  I prefer to make cuts into the loaf prior to rising as it can deflate the dough after rising and doesn't look as nice.  Otherwise, great recipe.  Perfect timing and ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe.

My 2nd attempt at making bread and it came out great! My husband loved it. I cut the recipe and only made 2 loaves. We ate one of the loaves as dinner one night and used the other as french toast a few days later. I don't have a bread machine but followed the 2nd most helpful review by "Fat-Dog-Lane" and it was very easy.

This bread was very good!  My family ate both loaves with spaghetti.  I cooked the loves on parchment paper instead of the cornmeal and it came out perfect.  I also put a couple of ice cubes in the bottom of the oven.

VERY tasty bread.  However, if you own a Zojirushi bread machine that uses a preheat as part of the dough cycle, DO NOT use warm water; use cold water, otherwise the preheat in your dough cycle will overheat the water and end up killing the yeast.  The end result was a tasty flat-bread that did not rise whatsoever.  Lesson learned on my part using my new Zoji, but thought I would pass that along.

Added 1 tab. spoon  of olive oil to the batter, proofed the yeast first for about 10 minutes, (proof yeast with the sugar and water) then mixed the yeast water with the flour mixture in the blender for about 8 minutes...after rising twice brushed with olive oil and put crushed basil, oregano, rosemary, and toasted sesame seeds on top...also put ice cubes in pan at the bottom of oven when cooking bread....delish!!

Unbelievable perfect french bread. Used  my bread machine (Panasonic) on the dough cycle. Did not have to add any additional water of flour. The consiistency was perfect. Used a couple of reviewers suggestions-made by small slices on top before final rise and threw ice cubes in the bottom of the oven a couple of times during cooking. This was absolutely the best bread that has come out of my bread machine so far and I loved that there was no oil or butter in the recipe. I will never buy store bought french bread again!!!!

This is an excellent, seemingly foolproof bread. I put warm water in the bread machine with the yeast and sugar and waited until it was frothy (about 10 minutes) before putting in the rest of the ingredients. When the dough ws mixed and cut, I let it rise for closer to 40 minutes than 20, and sprinkled coarse sea salt on it rather than the toasted seseame seeds. Served with fresh farmers-market ricotta and honey. Delicious! 

I'm currently making a few more loafs to par-bake (I think 10 minutes unstead of 20), freeze, and be able to pull out on a whim.

Very good recipe!  I baked mine at 400, for about 20 - 25 minutes,  on a perforated pan coated with cornmeal.  Outside was a nice brown color and the inside was soft and moist.  Will make again!

Superb and fabulous...but ONLY if a pan of ice cubes are placed on the rack below the bread during baking.  This recipe will be a weekly repeat for the essentials...kudos!

Definitely a 5 star recipe and would rate it even higher if I could.  Easy and delicious.  Was a big hit with guests.  Won't be buying French bread again.  This is it.  You've just got to try this recipe.

Excellant recipe!  Followed recipe to a tee with two exceptions;  used all purpose flour (I never use bread flour), and added 1 TBSP of  olive as one reviewer suggested to prolong to freshness (which I don't believe will be a problem since it won't be around that long).  Great texture, crispy chewy crust, ....perfect. Thanks Janet for the fantastic recipe.

I don't have a bread machine so I mixed the warm/hot water, sugar & yeast & let it proof for 10 min., while I mixed the flour & salt in my kitchenaid mixer. Then I added the yeast mixture & kneaded it for 8 min. I preheated the oven to 170 degrees & then turned off & let the dough rise for about 30 min. Then I rolled out onto floured surface & rolled jelly-style. I placed the roll onto a jelly roll pan. I sliced horizontal cuts in the top of the dough. Then I mixed the water & egg & washed the top of the bread. I sprinkled a few toasted sesame seeds ontop & put back in the 170 degree preheated & then turned off oven to rise for another 10 min. Then I preheated the oven to 370 (my oven cooks hot), and baked it for 15 min. It smells delicious & looks wonderful! I didn't have bread flour so I used all purpose flour. I'm sure it will be even better next time when I can buy some bread flour! The bread was a little thicker than I'm sure it would have been had I used bread flour, but it was still delicious & we gobbled it right up!

Absolutely FANTASTIC bread! I will be making this over and over and over! It was crunchy on the outside and light n fluffy inside. I used regular flour since I did not have any bread flour and also added about a tablespoon of olive oil like suggested in a previous review. It was perfect. Thanks for the keeper of a recipe! :)

Got rave reviews! Easy to make and bakes up so wonderful and yummy. I followed the suggestion to add a tablespoon of olive oil and the bread was still so soft and moist the next day. I also followed the suggestion to toss ice-cubes in the oven when baking the bread (only I put the ice-cubes into a shallow pan on the bottom rack of my oven). This is going to be a regular in our household!
UPDATE: I make this every week! We stopped buying bread. I don't split the dough, I just bake it as one huge loaf. Makes great sandwich bread as well as french toast. I cannot get over this wonderful bread!

When I made this bread, I followed the recipe exactly, but was somewhat disappointed with the its bland flavor.  The second time around I made some changes to give the bread a more whole wheat taste.  Instead of the 3.5 cups of bread flour I did 1 cup whole wheat flour, 2.25 cups of bread flour, and .25 cups of ground flax.  I upped the salt to 1.5 teaspoons and omitted the glaze.  I'm really happy with the way it turned out!  Much more flavorful.  Overall this recipe is very versatile and a good place to start.

NO MACHINE NEEDED; So I am one of the ones without a bread machine but once you make bread it is pretty much the same technique .I made these for some Cheese steaks and WOW. When you get them out its "a little bit crunchy......little bit chew" (singing to the tune of that country song  A Little bit Country....-smiling-) The family LOVED these they are a NEW favorite. If you have a family of 4 like mine (I think teen age boys should make it 5) you should double the recipe for 4 small loaves or 2 BIG loaves for sandwiches. Hope every enjoys! WE DID! Gotta go make some NOW!

4 stars only becaust I felt it lacked more exact information like breadmaker model, settings, etc.

I have the Breadman Pro Model BK 1060S and used only the first 5 ingredients in the order listed. 

I used Gold Medal Better For Bread Flour and Fleishmann's BreadMachine Yeast.

I set the Menu at #5 for French Bread, Crust at medium, and Loaf Size at 1.5lb.

The crust was crispy and bread was light and soft. 

Just Perfect...

This is one of the easiest 5 star ratings I have ever given.  There is no debate on this one.  The recipe turned out perfectly.  My wife and I ate the first loaf in a matter of minutes, saving the second one only so our waist lines didn't expand too quickly.  Adding the TBSP of oil really helped preserve the bread and it was still great two day after it was made (Could have been for longer I am sure but it was all gone.  Would have been after one but we were not at home all day).

Excellent bread especially since I have never made French bread. Super Easy recipe..I did not use the bread maker...Used my KA mixer instead and it worked perfectly. I have my 2nd batch of the day in the oven now! I also used ice in the oven while baking! Highly recommend this recipe!

O.M.G. Best bread I've ever baked. Easy directions, perfectly portioned ingredients. To give it an extra flaky, crisp crust: before preheating oven, place a shallow pan on the bottom rack of the oven. When oven is preheated, fill pan with boiling water and bake bread as directed. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

This is an incredible recipe. This review is coming from someone whos obsessed with french bread. Dont be fooled by the simple list of ingredients. Before I was a bread-maker, i always assumed that the yummier recipies were more complicated... which isnt the case. This tastes just like french bread should, and is much better than any storebought brand ive bought. I dont use the cornmeal, and i throw a handful of ice in the oven twice for a medium crispy crust. AMAZING. the biggest key is to make sure it rises till at least double in size, twice. it makes the texture perfect.

EXCELLENT!  I only made one loaf because that's what would fit in my bread machine.  My only substitution was to use all-purpose flour and add vital wheat gluten.  (1 T per cup of flour)  This went perfect with tonight's soup.  Thank you Janet Vink for sharing such an EXCELLENT recipe!

This was great. I did make a few changes because I made this on a whim and didn't have bread flour. I replaced 4 T of the flour with vital wheat gluten to help with rising since I was using unbleached all purpose and wheat flours instead of bread flour. I was low on unbleached all purpose flour so I used one cup of whole wheat. I baked the bread on a preheated pizza stone and filled a broiler pan with water on the bottom rack to create steam. The bread needed less than 15 minutes in my oven.

This bread was quite flavorless. Not enough salt or yeast to be authentic. However, it does have a nice consistency but not one I would associate with a true french bread.

Have you ever been almost literally jumping for joy when a recipe turns out? Oh my gosh - I was just thrilled! I have been hunting and reading for months for a french bread recipe - seriously - and the whole rising, 2nd rising, cover with this, spray with that, find a warm place - was so daunting to me. I finally settled on this one because it seemed pretty straight forward. I'm telling you, I can't remember being so excited by a final result. They smelled FANTASTIC and looked wonderful and my family couldn't believe I made it at home - I make bread machine bread all the time but then in the oven with the wash and slices across the top... Thank you so much - I'm still smiling!

Amazing bread recipe! I got a little too excited and added the cornmeal with the first five ingredients and it still turned out delicious! I had to let my loaves rise for a couple of hours... maybe because I live in MN and it's the middle of the winter... otherwise I'm not sure why it took so long. I used a french loaf pan that cooks two loaves at a time. I put a pan of ice cubes under the loaves while they baked. The bread got crispy but I am hoping to figure out how to make  it crispier. My son and I made french bread pizza with one loaf and it was so yummy!

This was easy to make and everyone enjoyed it - and they were impressed which is even better!  However, this takes much longer than 40 minutes.  The prep time is 20 but there is at least 90 minutes of rising.  My bread machine takes an hour and 20 minutes for the dough setting. Then you role and allow to rise again before baking.  Give yourself 3 hours to get this done.

This was my first French bread and I must say, I am pleased. Mine is not pretty like everyone else's, but boy does it taste good! For reference: I did not use a bread machine & I used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour. Mine did rise a bit (it is a cold day) but it is still more dense, I think, than it would've been with bread flour--but all purpose is what I had and is probably what I'll use when I make this bread again!

Are you kidding, this is my favorite new recipe. I can`t tell you how many times I have messed up making bread but this recipe turns out awesome every time. Now every time I go somewhere I have to bring my french bread. I added some grated parmesean cheese and italian seasoning before I rolled the dough up and that also turned out great.

I looked to this recipe to figure out how long to bake French bread.  I use a recipe that's printed on the inside of my bread machine.  I love using the cornmeal; it gives it a nice crunch.  I also love the egg glaze; it gives it extra flavor.  Throwing a few ice cubes in really helps with the crust and keeping the bread moist.  I have been making this bread almost everyday (the recipe in my bread machine is almost exactly the same-just has an addition of butter or olive oil).

ETA: I accidentally left this in the oven for about 35-40 minutes last time, and it turned out even better.  I will be baking it longer from now on.

I make this all the time.  It works for one loaf too.  And I've added a teaspoon or two of olive oil and it tastes better if I happen to have leftovers.

I made this bread with my kitchenaid stand mixer. It was the first time i had issue with dough. I had to add a bit of oil and a dab of flour to get the dough ok.  Once that issue resolve everything went well.  Nice crispy crust and nice light inside.  I put a bowl of water under the bread in the oven.

SO GOOD! I didn't use a bread machine and followed the instructions on another review. I can't make this bread too much because it will get my waistline in trouble!

Fabulous.  The dough is a dream to work with.  The bread came out nice and crusty with soft and tender crumb.  I baked it at 375 for 22 minutes.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

This is a fool-proof recipe!  Gorgeous, delicious, crusty French bread.  I put the ingredients into the bread maker, turned on the dough cycle (which says it lasts for 1 hour 30 mins), but took the dough out after 30 minutes, it looked sufficiently kneaded to me.  Split it into two loaves, then let it rise for about 20-25 minutes.  Baked it for 25 mins and voila!  Gorgeous, fresh bread!  I served it with ham & potato soup - it was a real hit!  By the way, I didn't have cornmeal so I skipped that, and didn't choose to add sesame seed.  It's all fine without it...   Enjoy this delicious bread!  I've now made it three times - six loaves...  it's fantastic!

I made this bread today and it turned out pretty good.  I am not an experienced bread maker (this was only my second attempt at making any type of bread) and I did not have any trouble following the recipe.  I did have to change a few things though since I don't own a bread machine and didn't have anything but whole wheat flour.  This is where other reviewers' suggestions came in really handy.  I proofed the yeast seperately and just added it to my flour mixture.  Since I was using whole wheat  flour, I decided to add 3 tsp of vital wheat gluten (to the dry flour mix) to ensure some elasticity to the dough.  I used my hand mixer with the dough hook "beaters" to mix up the dough and I did have to add an extra 1/4 cup of water to it.  I pre-heated my oven on the lowest temp setting, turned it off and then let the dough rise in it covered w/a damp kitchen towel.  I also cut slits in the top before the 2nd rise instead of after it.  I baked it @ 375 for 45 min (just made one large loaf).  I also put an 8x8 pan of ice cubes on the rack below the bread.  The texture of the finished bread was perfect.  Crispy crust, tender, chewy inside.  The flavor however, was not so great.  Bland, and kind of fermented tasting.  Not sure if this is because I used whole wheat flour or perhaps the addition of the vital wheat gluten gave it the strange taste.  At any rate, I will be giving this recipe another try using different flour and adding some more salt or maybe rosemary and olive oil.

THIS IS AMAZING!!! I just made this by hand since we don't have a bread machine, and it's great! I added garlic powder to the recipe, and instead of sprinkling the sesame seeds on top, I mixed garlic powder and Italian seasonings together and sprinkled that. YUMMY! I will make this over and over! :)

This recipes is just so simple it's perfect. I left out the sesame seeds as I didn't have any. I made with my Kitchen Aid and took the advice of the ice cubes  in the oven. Great w/butter while hot! So many possibilities!

Made this today and it was excellent.  I just mixed the dough and kneaded it by hand before following the rest of the directions rather than using a bread machine.  The ice cubes in the oven really worked.  I was impressed.

I like to add shredded cheese garlic and salami before I roll up this bread, but it is amazing on its own! I always add some olive oil to the mix as it makes it last longer...

The best. Pretty easy to make, takes some time but not difficult with the bread machine. I will never buy french bread from the store again!! I sliced and topped with garlic butter (recipe on this site) and served with spaghetti.

Excellent recipe.  I tried it today and served it with the chili I made for supper.  I added the olive oil as suggested by another poster.  It was super easy to make and it turned out wonderfully.  I will be making a few of these at a time and par baking and freezing them.  Thank you for posting this recipe!  Cheers!

Great recipe! Followed the recipe exactly and it made a nice soft bread with an authentic French Bread Crisp Crust. I proofed the yeast first separately as I always find that I get a better rise that way, and put a few icecubes on the bottom of the oven. I made mine into one very large loaf and one smaller loaf for a hoagie-like sandwich. My breadmaker made this recipe SUPER easy. When you consider all ingredients and electricity used, it probably is about the same price as the $1.50 loaf at your local Wal-Mart's Deli,(probably only because I haven't started buying my yeast in bulk yet) BUT when you consider that there are NO preservatives(look at how LONG the list of ingredients is on that deli-bakery bag!), and you get a guaranteed even FRESHER bread at your own convenience, making this instead of buying it is way better. I will try making french toast with it in the morning. YUMMM!

This recipes makes an excellent, chewy bread. I made half into a loaf as described, and the other half into 6 rolls that I placed in a greased, corn-meal dusted round cake pan and baked along with the loaf. Delicious! The toasted sesame seeds are a great addition.

This was my first adventure into yeasted bread and I'm so glad I picked this recipe! I don't have a bread machine so I made it by hand and popped it into the oven. Even though I kind of popped them after the second rise the loaves still came out good. Next time I'll just be careful next time when I put the scores across the top.

Came out great! I think I ate a half of a loaf while it was still warm, yum. Light and soft in center with a nice golden brown thin hard crust. I personally would leave out the sesame seeds, but I will be making this bread often.

I don't have a bread machine or a K'aid so I used my processor. I was concerned about the lack of kneading time and the dough was sticky for me but it handled fine after the first rise and baked nicely. The problem I had was the bottom did not brown well but that was due to my learning how to bake with a convection oven.

Just fantastic.  It was perfect and I followed the recipe to the letter but I did follow what one person said and added some olive oil, and kept throwing ice on bottom of oven.  I could not believe such delicious results.  This is one I will do constantly!

Wow, this was super easy and very delicious. I used my Kitchenaid, raising the dough twice. So it took about 1.5 hours, but turned out perfectly. Just as good as the french bread I made for V day that took 7 hours!

Amazing.  The best bread I have ever made.  I made the dough in the bread maker, let it rise for about 30 minutes after the dough cycle and baked for a little less than 20.

This is an excellent recipe.  The flavor is great.  I added 2 tsp of olive oil to the bread mix and it turned out moist and chewy.  This will become a staple in my recipe box.

This was my first attempt at French Bread and it turned out amazing.  What a great and easy recipe.
Thanks for all the tips.  I did the egg wash on top and sprinkled with garlic salt.  My family loved it!!

This bread has been a huge hit at my house.  So glad it's for 2 loaves, because by the time I'm ready to put it on the table with dinner, a whole loaf has disappeared!  And whoever came up with the tip to add ice to the oven: brilliant.  It makes a great crunchy crust, with soft moist bread on the inside.  I don't use the sesame seeds (just don't have them) and I generally sub a half cup to a cup of whole wheat to enhance the flavor and make it a little heartier.  Really great recipe.

I LOVE this bread! I used King Arthur bread flour, which made it even smoother. I also added 2 tsp. of vital wheat gluten as the last ingredient. I did not bother with the corn meal or egg wash, and it is just amazing. The ice thing really works, and adds a nice contrast in texture. Love it!

Would have been great if I wouldn't have deflated it when I cut it.  Next time I'm going to try to cut it before I let it rise, like a reviewer suggested, to see if that helps.

This is my new favorite french bread recipe from this site.  The only thing I did different was to use parchment paper instead of cornmeal on the baking sheet.  I also used melted butter instead of egg brushed on the loaves prior to baking only because I was running low on eggs. I liked this bread so much that I did a couple of loaves stuffed with mozzarella cheese and pepperoni.  They turned out wonderful!  I will say that it is best right out of the oven but reheated isn't too bad either!  Definitely a keeper!

Followed directions, except for adding 2 tbsp grape seed oil to soften the dough, and I didn't use any sesame seeds. This is the best french bread recipe I have ever used. Bread machine or scratch. It was absolutely perfect, crusty outside and soft inside YUM!!!!. I already started the next one and we haven't finished the first batch. Thanks for sharing!!!!

I always thought  French Bread was really hard to make. This recipe just proved me wrong. True it is kind of cheating... but when it tastes great and is that easy who really cares and no one could tell the difference anyway. I didn't have bread flour so I used 3 cups all purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat and sprinkled in some wheat germ, it worked great. I will definately make this again if I need French Bread.

I have never really mastered the art of bread making but this came out perfectly. The recipe was quick and easy. My BF actually ate an entire loaf of this with my broccoli cheese soup. I took the recommendation of another reviewer and added 1 Tbsp. of oil. Try this it is amazing.

I use this recipe about once a week.  My husband tells me I can make it everyday and he wouldn't get tired of it.  I've tried a few other recipes, but I like this one because I can make the dough in the bread maker.  I use the recipe as written except I leave out the sesame seeds, and sometimes I don't even use the glaze.  It still turns out wonderful.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  It will be a staple in our family for years.

I've been searching for a good french bread recipe for a while, and this one is easy and tastes great. When it was time to make the baguettes, I pinched the baguettes into eight mini-baguettes. They were the perfect size for a sandwich. I also let them "over-raise." Instead of 20 minutes, they were left to raise for about 30-35 minutes--it gives the bread great texture.   When the oven was pre-heating, I added an ovenproof dish of water at the bottom of the oven, to give the bread a chewier crust. When the baguettes were set up and starting to get brown, I slid them off the baking sheet, and let them finish baking on the rack. The bottom gets a great, chewy crust, too. I also turned off the oven, and just opened the door a couple of inches. This helps keeps the baguettes crusty even after they cool.

Made as directed and came out with two beautiful looking baguette sized loaves.  But I understand what other reviewers noted:  there's surprisingly little flavor to this bread. Overall, bland and tasteless.  Should be fine toasted up for bruschetta, but probably won't make again.  Thanks for recipe tho - I'm glad I tried.

This bread is fantastic. I used one of the other poster's hint about wrapping the bread in foil and then a damp cloth for a softer crust. I also kneaded in 1 Tbs of butter before forming my loaf.  Hint for those of you who are new to baking bread:  I've recently discovered that allowing the dough to remain slightly sticky when forming your loaf yields a more tender bread than adding more flour for a stiff dough.

We loved this recipe!  I was extremely easy, I will definitely be making this frequently.  I did spray the oven with a few sprays of water before puting the bread in, it gave the crust a nice crunch.  I would love to try this for meatball subs, garlic bread, or cheese bread.  YUM!

I loved this recipe!  As a homeschooling parent, I look for easy recipes for my kids to make mostly on their own and this totally fit the bill.  My six year old had a great time and it turned out perfect!  We did put a pan of water at the bottom of the oven for added crispiness.  We will definitely be using this recipe again!

This is such a fantastic recipe! Both loaves were so beautiful and fluffy - and I barely did anything! After halving the dough and rolling both flat, I decided to put about 1-2 tablespoons of softened garlic butter (the recipe from this site) on one loaf, then roll it up with the butter inside it. I also left the sesame seeds off, due to an allergy in the family. They were so perfect, such an easy and versatile recipe for such fancy and yummy bread!

OMGGG! This was my first time making bread and it tastes so good! I took "*Fat~Dog~Lane*" from the reviews, advice since I didn't have a bread machine. Only thing I did different was heat my water to 120 degrees, only because that's what my yeast packet instructions directed. I'm hooked! Thank you so much for this recipe. Who knew I could be so happy about bread? But I am!

This recipe is simillar to the one I use.  But for those of you who don't have time to bake, let your mixer with a dough hook knead your bread for 10 minutes and then shape your dough. I like to make 2 oz. dough ball for rolls, let rise til double in size then bake at 450 for 20 to 25 minutes. Don't forget the ice cube method.  Great recipe.

I made this bread today without using a bread machine and my brother told me it looked like an artisan bread!  I brushed the top with egg, then added some beer can chicken seasoning.  Delicious!  Hit with my company tonight.

Loaves were wonderfully moist and fluffy! I didn't have to adjust the recipe at all!
In addition to one of the loaves, I added some egg and cinnamon sugar...mmm..mmm..MMM!

I don't own a bread machine, nor do I keep bread flour on hand (perhaps I should!) but using regular flour and following other reviewers instructions on doing it without a machine yielded excellent results! My fussy, bread-snob of a husband was quite impressed! I baked it 20 minutes, and the crust was not as crunchy I was hoping, so next time I'll make sure to bake it the recommended 25 and see if that crisps it up. However the insides were perfectly soft and tender! I'll probably try making it whole wheat sometime for myself and see how that works out.
Update: I replaced the flour with 100% whole wheat and was very pleased. Sometimes Whole wheat can be a bit dense or dry but it works well in this recipe!

Thank you, this bread is so good that I have made 3 loves in the past week and ate them myself.  The only thing I added was the olive oil that George suggested. The simplicity and taste of this bread is to live for.  It is truly Manna from heaven.

I messed up somewhere because my loaves were  a little larger than silver dollars. It was perfect for snacking though and didn't affect the flavor at all.

WOW! These were gorgeous, had such an amazing texture, and they tasted great. It is delicious with soups, pasta, or as sub sandwich bread. I can't wait to make more. ((I did add 2 tbsp. of olive oil as suggested to make it last longer, but this didn't help. The loaves do not last overnight!! I am going to try freezing them))

Most delicious French bread I have ever tasted! I added a tbsp of oil to the mix as recommended in another review, but followed the original recipe.  Another family favorite!

I prepared this recipe in my kitchenaid.  This recipe is perfect.  The best french bread recipe I have found.  I did use oil in the recipe, to soften the crust just a little.

This is fabulous French bread! And really easy to make, as well. The water/ice cube trick mentioned by others works to help crisp the crust as well, but it's also good soft. My family really enjoys this bread, and it's a huge hit around our house. This is definitely a keeper!

Fantastic!!!!! So simple and easy to make.  Husband couldn't believe I made it.  Thought it was from the bakery.  Ran out of Tostidos for Velveeta, Rotel dip and used the french bread. Really good.  Wanted to try it with french toast but didn't have any left.  Will have to make two batches for that.  Family loved it.  Will make this at least once a week by popular demand. I did add 1T olive oil and used 2 1/2 cups bread flour and 1 cup whole wheat, baked on parchment paper sprinked with cornmeal.  Sooo easy.  Thanks

This bread is perfect for anything! From Salmon Salad Sandwiches to a fancy Italian dinner to a side to even a smoothie, this bread somehow works for it all!!! It's so good that the day after first baking it, my family had me make six more loaves for a new tradition they wanted to call "BreadFest". Thank you for giving me this bread from heaven!

Wonderful recipe.  Only thing I changed was substituting all purpose unbleached flour and omitting the sesame seeds.  Divided the dough in half and made one loaf of bread and four sandwich rolls.  Yummy!

I was terrified to make this because I haven't made bread in forever and I haven't had the best of luck with yeast. We made bread sticks out of half the loaf. Now that I know how easy this recipe is we will definitely make it again!

My house smells great right now!  We're about to have this bread with asopao (a puertorrican chicken and rice soup).  I used all-purpose flour because I didn't have bread flour on hand.  I checked at the 5 min mark the bread machine and I didn't have to add any flour of water.  I baked in my stone and spritz the oven a couple times with water.  I didn't use the egg wash, and instead I brushed the loaves with water.  YUMM!!  I might make this again tomorrow!

This is one of the best and EASIEST bread recipes.  I too like others do not have a bread machine - used my kitchenaid and mixed ingredients for 9 minutes before first rising and the results were terrific.  Dough will not be sticky like most recipes.  I omitted the sesame seeds.  First loaf gone in 10 minutes...second one gone a few minutes later...GREAT RECIPES.  MUST TRY!!

Awesome!!  Incredible!! I made this today, as the first attempt to make French bread.  I only slightly modified the recipe, and added 2 Tbsp of olive oil and about 1/4 cup more bread flour into the kneading cycle, as the flour was very sticky.  The dough was very easy to work with, and the suggestion of using the ice cubes in the bottom of the oven was terrific.  I also baked mine for about 40-45 minutes for a more golden brown crust. We ended up with a crispy, crunchy crust and a moist, chewy center. Thank you for this recipe!

Very good and so easy!  I made this and couldn't believe how easy it was! I did use all-purpose flour and follwed the rest of the recipe.  I also, didn't use the cornmeal and  sesame seeds (didn't have any). I have an almost two year old son and anything that saves time when being homemade is a two thumbs up!  I made this to go with our spagetti and meatball dinner.  My son and I, almost ate a whole loaf by ourselves, before the dinner!  Also, glad that the ingredients were simple and staples in our home.
***UPDATE*** I made again and used 2 1/2 cups bread flour and 1 cup white wheat flour and didn't use the glaze.  Was very good!   I sprayed the two loaves with non-stick spray and baked in oven at 325 F with a pan of water for 20 minutes.  So good!

This recipe as is, is fantastic!!!  But I did try some changes just because I like to experiment.  I used 3 cups all trumps white flour(with a few Tablespoons of cornmeal added to my 3 cup measure) and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  I used molasses in place of sugar.  I mixed it in my KitchenAide mixer with dough hook and baked it in a stone bread pan.  I got a regular loaf rather than French bread type loaf.  It was excellent!  Made great toast and/or sandwiches when sliced.

This was fantastic- I will never try another french bread recipe.  This one is easy to modify if you want to add rosemary, dill, or garlic.  I just sprinkled some garlic salt on top and it went perfectly with our spaghetti night.  The sesame seeds added a nice flavor- I had debated putting them in and was glad I did.

Easy and amazingly delicious.  I did not want the crust crispy, so I did not spray the oven or add ice cubes and it came out warm and soft.  YUMMY!!

I'm new to bread making.  This recipe was very easy and came out perfectly!  I follow the directions exactly.  It's the middle of winter, so to get a nice warm place for the bread to rise.  I preheat the oven just before the dough is finished in the bread machine.  I place my sheet pan of the rolled/prepared loaves on top of my cooktop, on top of the oven (I have a standard oven/range combo).  Once the oven is preheated it lets the excess heat out of the vent right above the cook top and provides a perfect warm place for the loaves to rise, winter and all.

YUM!!!!!  My children (below 4) and us ate a whole loaf!!  Didn't really have a 'warm' place to put it but hey, it was 32C outside so chucked out there with a teatowel over it.  Didn't cook the first one long enough in the oven so a bit softer, changed it for the second and couldn't decide which was nicer!!  Absolutely loved it and perfect for the stew that we had.  Will make again most definately!!!  YUM YUM YUM!!! (Thank YOU).

Great! I didn't do the glaze, and it was fine (since I didn't care about having the typical hard crust). I also didn't use cornmeal...just greased the pan with butter and it was fine. The second time I only used cornmeal and didn't grease, and it was fine and actually preferable.

This was very good.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the crust didn't get quite as crusty as I was hoping even with the ice cubes trick.

I've made both this recipe and the highly rated french baguette from this site.  This was faster b/c it only had one rise after taking it out of the machine while the other had two.  This recipe seemed so much easier for that reason.  I didn't have enough bread flour to complete the recipe, so I used about 2 c bread flour, 1 c all purpose flour, and 1/2 c whole wheat flour.  It was delicious!  I like the fact that it was a bit versatile.

Easy and Tasty! Has more of an Italian bread consistency, but no complaints on taste and texture.  Made one loaf as directed. The second loaf I rolled flat, sprinkled with romano chees and garlic powder, rolled it up, and baked as directed. Holy Moly was that a tasty loaf!  Thanks for an easy, great recipe!

Loved it.  Added 1 Tbsp. olive oil, next time I will try without to see the difference.  I actually made it with my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook and "kneaded" it until it was smooth and elastic.  So easy, so good, such a hit... I will make this again for sure!

perfect!  I had to let rise a lot longer and eventually just put in low temp oven so it'd rise but that's because I live in a cold climate.. tasted great.  ate first one as garlic bread,made crutons with next batch and will make stuffing today.  This is a keeper!

This bread is perfect!  Everyone I make it for raves about it.      I always bake it with a pan of water in the oven on the lower shelf - this produces a much nicer crust.  Sometimes I use olive oil instead of water in the glaze.

I didn't use the cornmeal or the sesame seeds and I probably didn't let the dough rise long enough the first time and totally skipped letting it rise the second time after I rolled it out - HOWEVER!! This is AMAZING! My husband took one bite and said, "this isn't homemade" (needless to say my past attempts at homemade bread fell flat - no pun intended). This time, I was a rockstar and my family of bread-loving fanatics was completely amazed at my ability to create such a masterful loaf of bread! Ten stars! Thank you for this recipe!!

i make this all the time and it always turns out perfect. i do add a little olive oil, and dough enhancer or gluten. sometimes i'll add herbs, often not. the ice cube suggestion is good and it works.  i just dread store bought bread so this is a keeper.  making a batch now to go with leftover beef stew.

As is the recipe yielded 2 flat loaves of bread.  With the suggestions of other reviewers and the addition of garlic powder, the bread had a mild flavor.  Did not rise as expected after removal from the bread machine.  Will try a different recipe next time.  I made this again today and used very hot water and a tad more yeast - much better results, especially with letting rise in the hottest room of the house.  Definitely will make again with more yeast (about a healthy pinch more).

I love this recipe, it is the best bread I have ever made using my bread machine which my family and me have been doing for many, many years.  I actually cooked the bread loaves for 10 minutes, then applied the egg/water mixture along with a little bit of garlic and parsley seasoning on top before finishing the baking time.  I also used the ice cubes below (as another user suggested )which made the crust perfectly crisp and inside extremely moist.  I will most definitely be using this again!!

I made this in the stand mixer instead of a bread machine but it was still easy and yummy.  To make in a stand mixer if proofed my yeast according the the package directions with the water and sugar, then I added the salt and mixed in the flour a little at a time. The amount of flour needed depends on the weather at the time of making.  Some days I need a lot more then 3 cups other days 2-3 work fine.  I mixed until dough because a soft ball (not sticky) then continued on with the directions as described.

I just made this bread and we just tried it... WOW! This was my first time making bread (seasoned cook just never bothered with breads before). What a great recipe! The only thing I did differently was to add a little grated parmesan on top before baking it. The flavor is really outstanding. Dense, perfect for the gumbo I'm making, also from this site.  I recommend trying this recipe! Don't have a bread machine either so I just did it by hand. Came out beautifully! Thanks for sharing!

when it says "ready in" it does NOT take into consideration that the bread machine takes an hour and a half to mix dough alone...and I also feel that should be included in "prep time" considering that is part of the preparation included in making bread. I haven't eaten the bread yet, but I am very disappointed that I didn't pay more attention to this before starting supper.

I was very disappointed with this recipe! I let the dough rise (covered on top of my pre-heating oven like I always do) for 1.5 hours and it still had not doubled in size. The egg wash made the crust chewy and the loaf was bland and dry. I make bread all the time, and I will not be making this again!

OUTSTANDING! Crunchy Crust & Soft Inside.   What a great flavor and looks impressive too.  I used a KA with dough hook for about 8 minutes, producing a dry dough.  After portioning and rolling out the dough, the shaped loaves were allowed to rise in a warm oven with damp towels over them.  After about 45 minutes rising, I removed the loaves, preheated the Convection Oven at 315 degrees F and cooked all 4 for 25 minutes on two seperate oven shelves, rotating the pans and switching places in the oven after about 18 minutes.  I wouldn't allow anyone to put any butter on the bread.  It goes very well with a glass of wine.  I will continue to serve this for many years to come.

I love this recipe.  We wore out our bread maker because we made it so much.  I agree with some of the other reviewers about adding about a tablespoon of oil to help it stay fresh.

I use this recipe quite often. We use it for meatball subs, french bread pizza, french toast, rolls, and of course regular french bread. It is simple yet delicious. I love to make it when we have dinner guests. It tastes fabulous, looks just as wonderful and they think I spent hours slaving over it. Thanks for sharing.

This bread is wonderful!  I was looking for a quick recipe that I could make so that we would have some french bread to top our french onion soup.  I omitted the cornmeal and sesame seeds because I didn't have any, but the loaves still turned out delicious.  I had to add the extra 2 tablespoons of water after 5 minutes of mixing.  Thanks for the recipe!

I can't believe I never reviewed this bread.  This is my go to recipe.  I make the bread, I have made baguettes, I have made dinner rolls, sandwich rolls even hot dog rolls from this recipe, by simply adjusting the baking time.  I usually bake one loaf and freeze the other, but when I make rolls I bake them all at once and freeze the excess.  They are just as tasty when reheated.  Great versatile recipe -thanks!

I made this without the corn meal or seeds, but it still turned out great. I used the dough to make bread bowls instead of loaves and it was perfect. I didn't have to coat the inside of the cut out bread to prevent sogginess. I will use this recipe again. thanks

This bread is amazing.  It was so easy to make.  I did add the extra water and it came out perfect.  I forgot to throw the ice cubes in the oven so I will do the next time but it was REALLY good as it was.  I will definitely be making this again and again.....it would be great as sandwich rolls.

This is THE BEST French Bread recipe I have ever made. I have made lots of good ones but this was the most like store bought than any others. It is light and airy and the dough shaped beautifully. The pan of water placed in the oven while this cooked was a helpful tip. Love that you added is the rolling up jelly roll style an laying on seams.

Thank you so much for sharing! The whole family loved this recipe. I was going to use 1 loaf with dinner and freeze the other, but....the second one didn't make it that long! I used other reviewers suggestions about the ice cubes and they were right - make a nice crust on the outside while still preserving a nice soft inside. I will be making this many, many more times. This one will definitely be added to the "keepers" recipe box!

Awesome bread! I've made this twice now. Both times I didn't have cornmeal, but that doesn't make a difference. Also I've add three tablespoons of minced garlic (I like garlic!!)and two tbls of flax seed. I love this bread!

The ingredients for this recipe are so simple I wasn't expecting much, but this recipe was outstanding!!  Easily better than supermarket french bread!  I was looking for something to top my french onion soup, and this was perfect.  My family LOVED it so much I am making it again tonight -- only this time I am doubling it!

This recipe lives up to the reviews.  So easy and so good!  Just to save time, I did end up making 1 large rectangle, rolled it and then cut in the center to shape into the two loaves.  I also threw a bit of snow into the oven and it worked really well to get that wonderful crust. Will definitely make again...

I didn't use the sesame seeds, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  It came out perfect yesterday, and I'm making it again today!

Definitely keep an eye on this one after adding to your bread machine.  After a few minutes, I could smell the motor starting to heat up, and I could hear that the paddle could barely move.  Adding 2 T more water took care of it.  It's a good thing I was observant.  The bread smelled wonderful and was easy to work with, but I think it was a bit to heavy and dense for my liking.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to change it, but would gladly take any advice!

This recipe is awesome.  It was my first time using my breadmaker, and it came out PERFECT.   I didn't have any cornmeal on hand, so I just baked the rolls on a piece of tinfoil on top of a cookie sheet and greased underneath the rolls with olive oil.  They baked in a little under 20 minutes in my oven, so I would keep an eye.  

Awesome recipe.  Tastes like the best french bread I've ever had.

I used my favorite bread maker French Bread recipe (they are very similar), but followed your steps from #2 on. These loaves looked and smelled fabulous! It's a big game night tonight and making the bread from scratch today is SOOOOO worth the effort. I love letting the bread maker do most of the work for me. After dividing, rolling, & placing on the baking sheet, is when I make the cut marks (before the second rise). Baked these up early. We had meatball sandwiches. I scooped out some of the bread to have a well for our meatballs, saving the excess for another recipe. The whole egg/water wash gives the bread a lovely shine and the sesame seeds made this look top notch, I use my fingers and do so very gently. Yah baby, this one's great! What a keeper. Will try it in it's entirety very soon, as French Bread is the one bread that will always work for me. Thank goodness. And the taste is superb.

I have a favorite french bread recipe but was looking for something easier.  I think because I had something to compare it to, I was not impressed with this bread.  It lacked flavor.  I'm going to stick with my tried and true. Sorry!

So easy and relatively fast!  I am going to try some tricks to make the crust a bit crispier, but for those who like soft bread, this is wonderful!  I will be making this all the time.  Thanks!

I just made the full recipe in our bread machine and it turned out well, although I would like the crust to be a bit more tough and chewy, but it is a nice bread, very soft on the inside.  I brushed them with a yolk and water mixture and sprayed the oven with water several times.  Will make again though I may add a bit more salt and sugar, my husband loved it.

YUM!!  Yeast breads are not my friend.  I do not know what possessed me to try this recipe, but I sure am glad I did!  My husband and 4 kids just loved it.  No more store-bought french bread for us.

Super easy to make.(used Kitchen aid with dough hook)
Followed directions...decided after making one batch, I wanted bigger loafs and more, so I made another batch so they could cook together. Made 1 round loaf, and 1 long French style loaf.
Used the toasted seeds...very nice
crispy crust..soft center....
will be making French toast soon!

This bread is superb! I was looking for another recipe, the one I usually use, and came across this one so I tried it. It has a very smooth and soft bread with a chewy crust. Don‚Äôt mistake chewy for hard. The crust can be bent, torn or sliced easily without getting a lap full of crumbs. Since the dough is processed using a bread machine and baked in your oven you get the great smell of bread baking with very little work!

Well, here's another 5 star review.  This was absolutely the best bread I've made.  Honestly....and I've tried quite a few French bread recipes.  I didn't even have bread flour, and it turned out perfectly.  The dough was a dream to work with, and rose beautifully.  The inside of this bread is to die for if you like chewy French bread.  It was perfect.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

I can't even tell you how many times y family has made this bread!! So easy to whip up the dough in the breadmaker, then take the dough out, form it on a pan with some cornmeal on the bottom, 3 slices at the top, let rise for 20 minutes, brush with egg wash and bake.  It always comes out PERFECT!

Made this dozens of times,it's my family's favorite French bread recipe. I add 2 tbls of Olive oil which helps preserve the bread for several days when properly stored. Great for sandwiches, soups,with Nuttella. So soft & tasty.

This is a very good WHITE bread recipe, with a soft, tender texture,  French bread should have irregular cell structure, plenty of elasticity, and chewiness.  This has a nice taste, but it's tender, with small, even cell structure, and a flaky (rather than chewy) crust.

baked up great but could have used just a bit more flavour.  I am thinking of adding either powdered milk or 1/2 milk 1/2 water, and perhaps adding a bit of butter.

Perfect ,, simply perfect, this is the only recipe you would ever need for a basic loaf of French bread.
The only difference I made was the addition of 3 Tbsp. of olive oil.
This recipe is also perfect for the base when making foccachio bread.
I bought a bread machine on sale ( $ 59.99 ) it just works great for making dough, it's been eight months since we have bought a loaf of bread.

Great recipe!  I make this all the time and have made a few adjustments, I add about a tablespoon of melted butter and oil mix to soften the bread a bit.  I also add about one tablespoon of sour cream as it eliminates the strange bread taste you get with homemade breads so it tastes more like bakery bread.  In this recipe increase the water by two tablespoons and cut down flour by a 1/4 cup.  When rolling out use baking spray or just oil spray instead of adding flour since adding flour to roll will give a more dense bread, just spray work surface and loaf itself and roll.  For baking, boil a small pot of water while your oven preheats, then when oven is ready put in pot of water and bread, this will replace misting the oven and it is more effective since bread needs that moisture to rise at the beginning of baking but not at the end so the crust doesn't get soggy.  This is really a very good French bread recipe.

I've made this bread several times now, and the results are always wonderful! Sometimes I use more of the eggwash for a very golden top and ice cubes in the oven for that extra crunch. Other times I keep it soft and mostly white- depends on what I'm planning on serving it with. There's only two of us so I usually split the dough into four or five sections for smaller, sandwich-sized baguettes over the course of a couple days. Thanks for the recipe! I know I'll be using it for years to come.

Great recipe! I was looking for a quick bread to make one afternoon to go with a pasta dish for that night. I have made it 3 times in the past 2 weeks, my husband loves it. I use it to make sandwiches and french toast also. Next time I make a batch I plan on using the 2nd loaf for garlic bread, just cut andfill with a herb butter and freeze. I cook the french bread on bakign stones. This ones a keeper, ty janet!

It would be nice to note that the prep time/cook time estimates on this are deceiving... The DOUGH setting on my bread machine was an hour & 1/2 long, so it's not like the recipe takes a TOTAL of 40 minutes from start to finish. It'd be nice to be able to prepare for that. All in all though, this recipe was perfect & was no trouble at all to make.  I did use a previous bakers suggestion & added 1 tsp oil to the mix & it was delicious.

I have made this French bread everyday since i found this recipe a month ago. my husband absolutely loves this bread. I do add the extra tbs of water to my mixture and i also use 2 1/2 tsp of sugar instead of only 2, and just throw it all in the bread machine. i let it rise in the dishwasher, this actually works out good because it keeps it moist and it is nice and warm ( i put the dishwasher on heated dry and once the cycle is midway over i put inmy dough). then for the glaze i only use egg whites with water, that way it does not have an egg flavor

I've had a breadmachine for years, and this is by far the BEST French Bread Recipe that I've found.  I will admit to 1 small change.  I used 1/4 cup of Wheat Germ in place of 1/4 cup of the bread flour.  Other than that I followed the recipe to the T. My family is already requesting another batch.

This is such an excellent, simple recipe! I saved it last week and have probably made it a dozen times already...served to company twice (with a lot of compliments!)...and my family loves it. Have made it into large loaves for sandwiches, small loaves for garlic bread, and have two loaves raising right now with two more to go in the bread machine soon. So simple, yet so tasty!

I used this recipe in conjunction with my bread maker. Since my bread maker does all the kneading and rising of the dough (total time of 1 1/2 hrs.), I didn't follow the step about letting the dough rise for 20 min. None-the-less, the bread came out AMAZING. This is definitely a keeper, and I did not have to modify any of the ingredients!

Absolutely delicious.  I did add about a tablespoon of olive oil to the dough as suggested by another reviewer.  I also put a pan of ice cubes in the oven when I put the loaves in to bake.

We love this - we probably have it most times I make an Italian dinner.  Thanks for the great recipe. I usually just keep it in one bigger loaf instead of dividing it into two.  Today I mixed the butter and garlic powder and just slathered it over the uncut loaf a few times rather than having to butter each piece and everyone enjoyed it.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I just got done baking these bread. This was my first attempt at home-made bread and it turned out great. The bread was soft all over except for a crunchy bottom; this was fine with me. Will try baking with ice on bottom next time. I got 2 medium size loaves out of this recipe.

This was vary easy in the bread machine. Just add the wet ingredients then the dry ingredients set for dough, when done shape.  We used it for a appetizer cheese spread.  Worked great.  Thank you.

I got my first bread machine two weeks ago and I was shocked to see all the things I could make.  I was so excited to make french bread (a family favorite) and this recipe delivered!  I didn't have cornmeal, but followed all the other directions to the tee...including adding a pan of ice cubes to the bottom rack.  The crust came out crunchy and the center was so soft.  I also toasted raw sesame seeds in a pan, which I always do because they have a stronger flavor when just toasted.

Loved this bread! Made it twice now...the first time I added the olive oil but forgot it today.  Baked it with a bowl of ice cubes in the oven as suggested and it does make it crispy outside and soft inside.  My boyfriend says it's the best bread!

This recipe is outstanding! Better than store-bought according to my wife (especially when it's fresh out of the oven). I made it for the first time today. We left off the sesame seeds. We also didn't have any cornmeal so I used flour instead. The bread stuck to the pan, so I'd definitely recommend the cornmeal if you've got it! This is definitely a new favorite of mine.  Next time I'm going to try a smaller recipe and let the bread machine do the cooking as well - it's just so much more convenient that way.

I'm not sure how this bread turned out for those people who didn't use a bread machine - I for one don't have one.  The first time I made this bread I followed the recipe quantities exactly but found that I needed a lot more water than 1 1/4 cups.  I used the recommended amount of yeast. Aside from hand kneading the dough, I followed the directions but the dough ended up very dense - like a bagel.  The second time around, I put in 4 tsp yeast and the dough rose a lot more, but flattened out on itself upon doing so (perhaps it was too moist?).  I just made this bread for the third time - and this time, perfection! I used a loaf pan which helped a lot.  4tsps yeast, 2 tsp salt (1 tsp just isn't enough for my taste), 2 tbsp oil (I like the dough better this way) and 3 cups of flour with the recommended 1 1/4 cups water.  Best bread I've made yet!

Great recipe! The bread was perfect! Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. AND it was super easy in the breadmaker! Per other user suggestions I added 2 T olive oil and omitted the sesame seeds.

I used this recipe to make the Pepperoni bread from this site.  I made it into 1 loaf and baked according to the other recipe's directions.  Turned out wonderful. Very easy to make, will definitely be making again.

I think I need to work at this a little more; my loaves turned out tastey but they stuck to the sheet pan even with the cornmeal.  They were also a little skinny, didn't rise very much.  Overall I would recommend this recipe but I may have to tinker with it a bit.

This was good. I just made one big loaf. I did not use the egg wash, but next time I definitely would. I wasn't blow away by this, but my husband loved it. To me, it wasn't very "french breadish", it was just like regular white bread that comes out of the breadmaker.

Love this recipe.  The taste is great but I simply can't get it to raise properly.  Rather than raising and making a nicely rounded loaf like one sees in a bakery, I get a loaf that spreads out more than it raises.  Can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong???

I've made this recipe 3 times within the last week, once for home and once for a late Christmas celebration. Instead of making 2 loaves from each recipe, I made 1 large loaf. We cut it, spread it with garlic butter and toasted it on a griddle the first time and in the oven the second time (made 2 loaves for the celebration). Each time it was wonderful!

I can't keep this bread in the house because my boyfriend can scarf a whole loaf in a day!  I've been making it for both soup and sandwiches, and if I can ever keep a loaf for more than a day I'd like to try making croutons or french toast with it!

Very good! I added a little olive oil as recommended and I skipped the glaze. I made a quick garlic spread out of pre-minced garlic and Country Crock and I used this for garlic toast on one loaf. Very good! Thanks for sharing, Janet!

Disappointed. Couldn't give this the full 5 stars due to taste. Just your basic white bread except it had a hard outter crust. Didn't have the consistancy of French bread at all.  If you're looking for more of a sandwich bread, this is your recipe. I'll try another recipe and not make this one again.

This was sooo good.  I needed more liquid and added a TBSP of olive oil.  It's just the two of us so I halved the recipe.  Delicious.  Way better than store bought and easy too.  I ate it with butter and then served as an appetizer.  Cut into half inch slices, butter and grill each side.  Cover one side in strawberry jam and spread with warmed (microwave for about 40 seconds) brie cheese.

I followed the recipe as stated, and I don't think I should have. I should have taken other suggestions to put ice cubes in the bottom of the oven, and possibly add some olive oil. The texture seemed off to me although the flavor was ok. I think I'll keep looking for a recipe for french bread. I give this bread 3 stars for taste and texture and 5 stars for an easy recipe.

Yum!  I used all purpose flour which I think caused it to be a little more dense then I think it should have been but it was still delicious. Next time I will try it with bread flour.  I made garlic bread from one loaf and with the other loaf I made my husband a sandwich for lunch.

Made this most of the way in the kitchen aid as my breadmaker died from overuse a long time ago!  Just had to knead for about 8 minutes, then follow the normal rise procedures for bread and baking.  Really liked this, good flavor.  Did add 1 T. olive oil. Will use the rest for french toast tommorow am! Thanks!

Wow these loaves were awesome! I did use the suggestion of throwing ice in the bottom of the oven. While I was rolling the loaves I turned my oven on to 175  and rose the bread on a pizza stone (and cooked them on).

Best baguette recipe I've found. I bake this a few times a week it goes so fast.  I did have to add a few tbsp of water during the dough cycle since my machine sounds like it's working too hard.  I love using my bread machine to do the work and finishing the bread in my oven.  Wonderful recipe!

This is absolutely delicious french bread and it looks beautiful after baked! I've made it three times, each with success. The first time I made it, (I had made one large loaf as opposed to two and took the advice of another cook, throwing ice cubes into the bottom of the oven for a crisp crust) my husband said it was the best bread he'd seen and tasted since we'd been to Europe four years ago!

Quite yummy indeed.  I used a recent "vintage" find, my Pyrex Bake A Round, to make this loaf and it was great.  Looked like the loaves you buy at the bakery, but tasted better.  One reviewer recommended adding 1 T of olive oil, which I did, with great results. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Awesome! I followed recipe exactly and it was perfect. I put ice in the oven as suggested and did spray a bit of water too. This is the best French bread! Thanks for a great recipe.

I love this recipe!  I used the olive oil per a suggestion and hand baked it using a french bread pan, rather than a bread machine.  The bread came out so soft and tasty.  My husand and I were both thrilled.

This is an excellent bread machine recipe, I've made it twice now and it came out beautifully each time. I did follow another users advice on adding a tbsp of olive oil. I also have made this into one big roll instead of two smaller ones and it still came out perfect.

Loved it! Easy and simple. I added a bit of oil to keep it soft and omitted the glaze. Bread was soft and delicious, my family enjoyed it!

I did not get a good rise on this bread.  I was a little confused on the instructions about adding water or flour.  Not sure I know enough about bread making to make that call.  When would I do either/or?  It did taste good.  I will need to try again.

This was super easy and tasted great. I followed the recipe exactly except I did not put sesame seeds on the bread. Thanks, Janet Vink, for this recipe. I will be doing this one again. UPDATE: I have made this twice in one week and the kids gobble the bread up so fast, my husband and I have a hard time getting some for ourselves!

I have made this many times; it's become my favorite French bread recipe!  I don't use sesame seeds or brush it with eggs, and I usually halve the recipe to get one loaf.  I often throw in a little garlic powder and whatever dried herbs I have lying around as well.  This works great for garlic bread as well!
