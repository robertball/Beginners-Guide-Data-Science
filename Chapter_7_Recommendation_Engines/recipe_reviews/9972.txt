YOWZAAAAA! Fantastic recipe! These taste just like the rum balls my mom made during the holidays. When I told her about them, she said it sounds like the same recipe although she used crushed grahm crackers instead of the vanilla wafers - so there is a substitution if you don't have any Nilla wafers on hand! 
  I do have the following advice for making this candy though:
1. Use the "real" vanilla wafers - off brands with off tastes will affect the quality of your rum balls.The standard 12-ounce box makes your 2 1/2 cups of crushed cookie crumbs.
2. Crush the wafers in two batches in a food processor. This makes them powdery and very easy to mix into the mixture. 
3.DO REMOVE THE MELTED CHOCOLATE FROM THE HEAT AS SOON AS ALL THE CHIPS HAVE MELTED and before adding the sugar, alcohol, corn syrup, and cookie crumbs. Even on a gas stove, leaving it on the eye with the heat turned off will make your chocolate "seize" and it won't be teh correct texture you are looking for.
4. Melt the chocolate chips in a 3-quart saucepan on the smallest eye on your stove on Low heat, stirring almost constantly. Once the chips are melted, you can add the remaining ingredients to the saucepan and still have lots of room to stir without making a mess all over the counter.
5. I find the chocolate cools quick enough once you are through stirring to handle and make into balls. The first time I made these, I did refrigerate the mixture and it made it difficult to roll into nice balls - they were kind of

Rum Balls are tradition in Germany during the xmass Holidays. I usually buy them online at a German Store but decided to make them myself this year. Remembering how my grandmother used to make them I took this as a basic reciped using milk chocolate. One week before making the Rum Balls I took 1/2 cup of Raisins (a must in the original rum ball) chopped them up and soaked in the Rum for the week. If you do not like Rum you can also try using Amaretto. Then finished the recipe. The closest thing I found to the original thus far.

These really go faaaaasssst! These rum balls were way too easy to make and very tasty too. I made one batch to see how they came out...and now I am in the process of making about 4 more batches to give out as gifts this Christmas..and maybe even Diwali next year!

A few suggestions:
1) Roll the balls in cocoa powder or a mixture of cocoa and icing sugar. Only icing sugar or white sugar makes it too sweet. Rolling the balls in crushed nuts is great too!
2)Add the rum soaked raisins for a richer taste. 
3) If the mixture turns out too liquidy, just let it stay in the fridge a bit longer.
4)And yes, bit of alcohol goes a long way.

My first batch I used milk chocolate chips and captain morgans silver rum.  They were great and everyone loved them.
The next batch I used semi-sweet with some cheap rum and they were terrible.

I used white chocolate and Midori Melon flavored liquer, for "Melon Balls". They're a deliciously different take on rum and bourbon balls.

These are very good with bourbon (never tried the rum).

I ran out of vanilla wafers and wanted to make another batch, so I substituted crushed graham crackers, and they worked well, too.

I made these for Christmas this year.  They were very popular at my holiday party and I was asked for the recipe.  I see the logic of dissolving the sugar in the rum after making them - I'll do that next time.  They really do get better as the 7th day approaches.  Excellent recipe; thanks.

Loads of praise for these! We used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and it cut the liquor taste down a bit.  Also used only about 1/3 c. of bourbon and it was plenty. Everyone at our party went bonkers over them!

how easy and soooo good at bringing holiday spirit! i used pyrat reserve rum and rolled them in coconut flakes, chopped roasted almonds, cocoa powder, or powdered sugar. a little trick i found to help bigger things like nuts and coconut stick to the outside: roll them in a little water and then roll them in the desired coating.

If I eat a few more, I will happily give this recipe six or seven stars....ha ha!  These are great with white chocolate substituted for the semi sweet and egg nog coffee flavoring (I used about 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoon of strong flavoring) plus the usual rum for inebriated egg nog balls (:  If you'll be sharing them with kiddies or those who don't imbibe, jyst leave off the rum.  Or make the recipe as listed, substituting 1/2 cup very strong coffee or espresso for the rum and roll in a little cocoa and golden sugar.  Delish!

This was my first attempt at making rum balls, and OMG they came out amazing. I did tweak the recipe, as all I had were Dark and Milk Chocolate bars, Oreos and Digestives, I separated the Oreos and crushed the cookies then heated the rum as suggested and added 1/2 the sugar and the oreo filling.  When the mixture was cooled I used  a measuring tsp and rolled them into balls which were the perfect bite size,  I then rolled them in unsweetened cocoa powder as I found that the sugar made it too sweet.

This recipe yielded 70 tsp size balls.

I found them a little on the gritty side.  Maybe the sugar should be melted with the chocolate?  I enjoyed the ones with amaretto in them more then the rum.

made half Amaretto and half bourbon.  Have made these with chocolate truffle and half Kaluah as well.  Depending on flavor I dip in milk chocolate or white chocolate.

I don't do deserts at all because I always find a way to mess them up and I really don't have much of a sweet tooth, but these were easy to make and while a bit sweeter than I'd like, they were pretty d*** good!  I finally found something that I can't over/under cook, and that alone is worth 5 stars.

Excellent recipe! I have struggled with Rum Balls every year; these are the best by far that I have ever made. I melted the sugar in the rum for 1 minute in the microwave and added 3 cups of crumbs instead of 2 1/2. Also, I dampened them with my hand (I kept one hand a bit wet for this) before rolling them in the sprinkles. This made them stick better.

I took these to a Christmas gathering and they were the hit of the party!  I was concerned that they would be dry due to I used 3 cups of the vanilla crumbs (didn't read the recipe all the way through first!), but they ended up being fine! I used dark rum and didn't use walnuts (I had assumed that walnuts would be mixed into the dough - which is why I used extra crumbs).  My first time making anything like this!

Loved these. I was able to actually make these while camping out in the trailer, so were super easy to make. I also made with Amaretto and with crushed almonds. They were definitely a hit and I will be making again and again.

Excellent! They were the hit of the party. I exchanged the rum for egg nog and added 1 Tbsp. of rum extract which gave it the same taste but without the alcohol. Either way is excellent.

Great flavor! My guests ate them up quickly. Next time I need to double the batch. My only suggestion is watch how long the dough chills in the refrigerator. I left it for about four hours but it become rock solid and difficult to work with. The sprinkles I tried using wouldn't adhere to the surface. My recommendation is chill for only a short time. The confectioners sugar worked well even on the firm surface and tasted the best.

I used one 12 oz bag of chocolate chips, 4 tablespoons white corn syrup, 1 cup bourbon or rum, 1 box of vanilla wafers crushed fine (about 5 cups of cookies...which was the whole box), 2 cups of pecans or walnuts (measure before crushing fine), powdered sugar....used same directions as above to make and it's fabulous.  Just thought maybe some who found the sugar in the above recipe a little gritty would like this recipe better.  It's very smooth.  :)

OMG. I just made these rum balls with the intention of letting the flavor mellow for a week and serving on Christmas eve after dinner...but I don't think they are going to last that long. Even with the sharp tang of fresh rum (which, incidentally, I hate and don't drink), these doughy little balls of awesome are to die for. I haven't even sugared them yet. I had a bad moment when the chocolate seized and wouldn't combine with the rum and sugar, but I beat the heck out of it with a wire whisk and saved the day. Thank you, you've made my holiday!

the exact recipe i was looking for! what a hit they were with my friends! my only complaint is that the recipe claims to make 24 servings. i'm not sure what they're considering a serving, but each batch made ~45 bite-size pieces.

I made these for my husband in Afghanistan. They survived the journey very well, and the week they spent being shipped over made them taste even better when they got there - he loved them!

We make these every year for gifts and cookie exchanges - they are the most requested. Best recipe here for these and easiest. Hint though - let the balls sit in airtight container for at least a week before eating - makes them alot mellower and more delicious!

I was actually worried because what i thought was a whole box of vanilla wafers was only 1 cup worth of crumbs.  I added tea cookie crumbs and added 1 tsp of vanilla to the rum.  I also remember people saying that the balls were grainy so I divided the rum and melted the sugar into the rum in the micorwave.  This was really very easy although somewhat time consuming. I will definately make these again.  Great for gifts.

I have a question. I just made these and everything went well mixing and rolling them. I microwaved the chocolate just enough to melt. I warmed the rum a little to dissolve the sugar. The mixture came together nicely to roll the balls. HOWEVER, I decided to coat them in finely chopped walnuts and I cannot get the nuts to stick for the life of  me. It's not an even coating, most that have managed to stick are really just impressed into the dough. Which actually I like the look of, but can anyone tell me what I did wrong? This is taking forever to coat these.  Thank You!

I made these using leftover rum from the egg nog that I had made.  Although I did no try these, they were a huge hit at the dessert party and everyone commented that they were very good.

These were by far, the best rum balls I've ever had.  Not too super strong that you can't eat them, not too wimpy that you couldn't taste the rum.  Good recipe. Definitely.

Gluten Free Version - This year, I'm making a GF version using half GF animal crackers and half GF graham crackers instead of the vanilla wafers. They haven't "cured" for the five days yet, but the early taste tests went well. :)    I've made these now both with rum and bourbon. Although both are good, the bourbon is better, IMO.

SUPER EASY. Great as gifts that everyone will want again next year. I used this recipe as written and it was perfect. Used rum last year but this time I may used a coconut rum I have. Hard not to have a few test tasting balls for quality control. Worth making ahead five days for the full effect.

These are fabulous!  More like rum-flavored fudge than a cookie texture, they are rich and creamy and decadent.  Made one batch with rum and the second using Southern Comfort. Both turned out wonderfully.

I didn't give a full 5 star only because I changed a couple of things. I tried these twice. 

  Attempt 1: followed recipe except: no walnuts, used Bourbon and Bourban soaked raisins, dissolved sugar into Bourbon.
  Results: They were way to strong. I could barely eat one. 

  Attempt 2: used white chocolate, Malibu Rum, Rum soaked raisins and walnuts. 
  Results: Soooo yummy. The amount of rum was perfect the texture was cookiedough-like and the flavor was absolutely wonderful. I got several compliments and many recipe requests.

This is a great recipe! I substituted the Rum for Grand Marniere (orange liqueur) and the nuts for dried orange peel. The result has been outstanding. I also dipped the finished product in melted chocolate and then coated them in icing sugar. Definitely a recipe to impress!

These were great, very bourbon-y, which is how I like them.  I used chocolate cookies instead of vanilla wafers.  I also used pecans.  Excellent recipe.

OMG are these ever good!!! I decided to go with the Bourbon. I coulnd't find Vanilla Wafers anywhere, so I ended up using Aeroroot cookies, and I just crushed them up super fine in my food processor. (worked fine) I'd read a couple people say that they found them grainy, so I melted my chocolate and sugar together in a double boiler. Mine have only sat for 3 days so far, but we just tried them and they are FABULOUS!!!! I'd put quite a bit of finley chopped walnuts in the mixture, so instead of rolling them in nuts, I rolled them in icing sugar. So yummy!!! Thank you for this recipe, it will definetly become a Christmas Tradition now :)

Awesome.  I used spiced rum, ground walnuts fine in my coffee grinder and rolled the balls in granulated sugar, I think they're prettier that way.  Super good.  I had no trouble with a grainy taste.

I just made a batch of these up yesterday. I used bourbon whiskey, so I will definitely be keeping them away from my two-year old, even after reducing the amount to maybe 1/3 cup and adding some water. I used less walnuts (cracked some with shells leftover from the holidays) and mixed in some almonds, then tossed most of them in the blender with the wafers. Some were left in larger chunks which was nice. I used much more icing sugar to coat them, but I had a problem with a different recipe where the icing sugar absorbed the liquid after a little while. These do taste grainy but they ARE supposed to sit for a week, not just a day. I'm sure they'll be better in six days, if they last that long! Thanks for sharing, Elaine!

These were fantastic. I've made rum balls before using cocoa powder and thought they were delicious but these are MUCH better, creamy and the flavor is much better. The dough was much easier to work with and though I didn't roll them in powdered sugar (used different sprinkles and whatnot) I think it would adhere better than my other recipe that seemed to soak it up within an hour. This is my go to recipe now.

I made one batch with Barcardi and it went over well with the men in my family. The second batch I used vanilla rum to give it a bit of a change and they were gone within two days......I think next time I will try the coconut or pineapple flavored. :0)

Forget the corn syrup and sugar. I used mint chips instead of the semi-sweet chocolate chips and didn't need the additional surgar. They were a huge hit (and because of the mint...they're green to go with the holidays!).

Pretty good, just could use a little more rum. Chocolate also clumped when adding in liquids, seemed like there was probably a better way to go about that step. Grind cookies in processor so that they are very fine, otherwise chocolate will fall apart when rolling if you have clumps of cookie. I like this mixture better then others I have tried so far. Will try with bourbon next time.

This is the very same recipe I have used for years! My advice though, put the balls in an airtight container for a few days before serving or handing out for gifts to allow time for the bourbon to mellow. I like to use Jim Beam.

I made these exactly as instructed minus the nuts (co-worker is allergic to tree nuts).  They came out great!  I have, however, renamed them drunken balls. lol  Wow are these things strong!  I didn't give them a week to marinate as suggested. After tasting one the day after made, they were so strong they didn't need to sit for a week!  Some have suggested to cut back on the booze.  I guess it's personal taste because I liked them just fine with the amount in the recipe.  I made my 1st batch with bourbon (which I really like).  I'd like to try spiced rum next.  Great recipe!

These are veryyy good. I was worried they were going to be too strong with how much rum was in them, but they weren't at all. I made them for my family get together, which means kids too, so I made a portion of them without rum and just added a little vanilla. Those were good too. It did frustrate me rolling them though because they kept wanting to break apart on me. I found it helpful to warm them in my hands and then roll it out. I don't think I can wait a week for them!

So easy to make and very yummy. I used brandy and rolled in powdered sugar. Don't think they'll last a week before they are gone.I can't wait to try the recipe with different chocolate and liqour.

Ok I tried white chocolate and creme de menthe - too sweet so I think I'll stick to the brandy. I've made 4 batches so far!

I made these with brandy and chopped raisins soaked in brandy. The flavor was very good and they were popular at my holiday party. The next time i make them I will use a lesser amount of powdered sugar in place of the regular sugar as the texture remained gritty even after they rippened for a week.

these are one of the most requested Christmas cookie (or whatever you want to call them) that I make each year. This year, I have 4 boxes of vanilla wafers to make the rum balls out of so I'll have enough to go around!!!

These are great!  I used half rum, half egg nog.  Once I rolled them into balls I let them sit for a while then placed them into a storage container and drizzled a rum glaze over them.  I will have to make another batch or two of these, as my husband and I (already) can't stay out of them.  They are SOOO SOOO good!  I'm going to give some away to family for sure.  Yummy!

I've made this recipe for the past 4 years and I can't stress to you how POPULAR these rum balls are!  I use 151 Rum and usually have to make about 3 to 5 batches for my husband to bring to work.  Everyone has dubbed them "Kris' Famous Flaming Rum Balls!"  Thanks Elaine for submitting this!

I make a triple batch every year for NYE.  Nothing is ever left at the end of the night.  That says it all.  Super easy to make.  Best made a t least a few days before you want to eat them. I up the Bourbon a bit to the point just before it becomes to wet.  It sets up very firm after a few hours in the fridge and makes it easy to work with. A winner every year!

These are fabulous!  So easy!  I followed the directions exactly.  Used a 4-cup Corningware measuring cup to melt the chocolate in the microwave.  Ground one box of Nilla wafers in the food processor - the finer the grind, the finer the consistency of the finished rum ball product.  The other thing I found helpful was to use a fork to mix the ingredients in the order listed, then to blend the mixture with the crumbs.  I strongly doubt these will make it to the New Year, but I'll try hiding them.  I used Captain Morgan's spiced rum (don't judge, it's what I had on hand) and it's darn tasty with chocolate - who knew?

I've been making these for 2 years now. Everyone loves them and some people give me money to buy the ingredients to make them.  I've made balls with Captain Morgan Spiced rum and made a batch today with Bacardi 151 Cuban rum. Last Christmas I used Peach Ciroc instead of rum and made vodka balls. Sometimes I dust with powdered sugar or coat with sprinkles. Great recipe and I always double it because friends eat them up! They don't last long. Two thumbs up.

Made to specs in recipe- very good! Couple of recommendations 1.) Use the best quality rum you can afford (it pairs nicely with chocolate and gives vavoom) 2.) Let them sit & simmer at least a few days before serving (perfection takes time).

These were delicious! I added some chopped raisins in place of the walnuts and they really took them to the next level. I found them to be quite boozy - which we were happy about! Yummy.

I make these every Christmas and they are always a hit! I even made them for the dessert table at my wedding. Be sure to allow them to "rest" in the refrigerator for at least 5 days before serving. This will allow the ingredients to soften so it will not be gritty.

Terrific. Heat the rum and dissolve the sugar into it first to avoid the gritty texture. Then add chocolate and corn syrup. Went fast at the Christmas party!

My mom and I made these this past Christmas with rum first and then with bourbon. They were quite good, but apparently my dad had asked for bourbon and not rum, so we made some with bourbon, too. This recipe is so easy that we didn't even mind doing it twice. We dipped them in different combinations of powdered sugar and walnuts. Everyone loved them, and they kept for New Year's, too.

They are just okay - not the type rum ball recipe I was looking for.  I agree they are gritty.  I even warmed my rum & tried to dissolve all the sugar and it did not help.  I also think they are a little strong with the amount of rum called for.  I followed the recipe exactly.  While they are warm they are easy to work with but as they cool they do need to be worked harder and warmed in your hands to hold shape.  I will keep looking for a better recipe than this.

The dough was a bit crumbly towards the end so I pressed the dough into tiny ice cube trays with silicone bottoms.  I stuck the cubes in the fridge for about 10 min.  I came up with 80 perfectly formed Rum balls/bells.  Great technique.

EXCELLENT - Very easy to make, i used maple syrup instead of corn syrup and skipped the nuts. They look fantastic and taste delicious.

I've always thought of rum balls as extremely moist, but not these.  I opted for less rum (1/3 cup) after reading some reviews. What you have to remember is to make up the difference you shorted with water (an afterthought for me).  May be that affected the outcome.  I found them not very easy to form into balls and rather crumbly.  That's when I added the water.  I may try this recipe again as the nuts and flavour were OK and the texture was wmooth although a bit on the dry side. I took some advice from the reviews and dissolved the sugar in the rum to avoid crystal-like texture and it worked fine.  I'm not a big rum lover and after reducing the rum to 1/3cup realized I could've left the recipe as written (1/2 cup) and it probably would've been fine.

Great recipe, I was hoping they would be a hit, as my husbands family had never tried a rum ball and they have a more "adult" taste.  I saw people recommend less rum, but I went with the full 1/2 cup. For me personally I would have gone with a bit less rum, but people still loved them with the original recipe. They were eaten up quickly and my husband loved them!  Next time I think id add nuts, which I left out for allergies purposes. And roll them in sprinkles instead of powdered sugar, they were very rich, could have used a bit more sweet to balance it all better. Great recipe to mod though, thus gave five stars ;)

Everyone I shared these with thought they were delicious. I thought the texture was a little strange but I'm sure that was my doing. No one else complained and they disappeared quickly.

Very good.  Rolled some in powdered sugar and some in cocoa mixed with powdered sugar.  Couldn't wait a week to eat them.. they tasted a little stronger when you don't wait, but still very good.  My husband took them to a work Christmas party and they were gone fast.  My Dad loves rum balls and he really loved these.

These were excellent!  Gave them for Holiday gifts and everyone raved about them.  They were gritty the first 3 days but after sitting a few days, they were velvety smooth.

Very tasty, with a strong rum flavor. I rolled mine in cocoa powder which lends more of a bitter chocolate taste. They are definitely better with age--it's worth it to wait the week for them to dry and the flavor to meld.

First of all, I have never made rum balls before and made this recipe exactly as written. No one seemed to care for them, but with other suggestions listed, I believe I could put together something that tastes better. They have way too much rum for my taste and were gritty from the undisolved sugar. Cutting down on the rum and perhaps using Captain Morgans may help with that, and disolving the sugar in the rum will help the gritty taste. Also, adding rum soaked raisins is a great idea and will do that next time. But, IMO this recipe as written is not great.

I tried rolling these in confectioner's sugar and very finely ground nuts, and the result was rum balls rolled in confectioner's sugar, and a bowl of sugar coated nuts.  The nuts did not stick!  I only added nuts to half the dough, as my boyfriend does not like nuts.  The ones with nuts were coated with confectioner's sugar, and I rolled the ones with no nuts in chocolate sprinkles (I tried it once with cocoa powder and did not like it at all).  I have made these twice, and they were very good (though I will reduce the rum by a third and use water to make up the difference in the future -- they are very strong!).  My boyfriend made them once, and they were awful, totally his fault, though.  He did not grind the wafers finely enough, which resulted in a chunky, very tough cookie.

so far, so good. just finished them, so they haven't aged yet, but they taste darned good at this point! i made them lots smaller--used my #40 scoop to portion, then cut those balls in half--i ended up with almost 6 dozen. also added the raisins recommended by another reviewer, and rolled them in a mixture of 1/2 10X sugar and 1/2 cocoa powder.

These are DELICIOUS!! Wow, they really pack a rum-kick! The only thing I'll do differently is use powdered sugar next time. I didn't care for the gritty crunch of the white sugar. Rolled in cocoa powder, these were a hit at my last party. Definately a keeper!

Just made these with hubby's help. Was hard not to eat them as we rolled them. We used "Rich and Rare" Whiskey.  Had to seal the container and put far away so there would be some for Christmas!

These are delicious! I think next time I might try a little less vanilla wafers, but they tastes great as is.  You can really taste the flavor even in just one ball.  I rolled some in powdered sugar and others in cocoa powder and liked them both ways.  Looking forward to trying them again in a week!

These are wonderful and soooo easy to make.  I added a bit more rum to give the rum balls more of a kick and they were awesome.  I'll definitely make these a holiday must from now on.

these are super delish! i am not a rum fan but somehow, i was craving these. they were super easy, the most time consuming was rolling them into balls. i left out the nuts, as i did not have them and they still turned out great. i'm making another batch because i may not have enough for my holiday dinner - i can't stay away from them!

Delicious, excellent bourbon ball recipe. I highly recommend using bourbon, as its wonderful notes of vanilla, caramel and oak are perfect in sweets. Be sure you don't crush the nuts too finely or you won't be able to taste them. Also good with pecans. The alcohol is very strong in these, so consider using less, unless you really love your bourbon.

I got rave reviews on these and will make again!  I doubled the recipe, using the same measurements as below, except instead of 5 cups of vanilla wafers i used 1 whole box (finely ground in the blender, i think it equaled about 3.5 cups) and only 2/3cup of Makers Mark bourbon, and no nuts.  I served these after one day they were made, but def. thought the bourbon was stronger after setting/ soaking. A box of these would be a very nice gift.

Made as directed.... Tasted good but GRITTY.... I suggest you find a recipe using powdered sugar.  I used extra fine sugar and the texture was such a disappointment.

I put sugar in food processor to get it super fine as well as graham crackers - melted chocolate in microwave dumped rest of ingredients in and let my mixer beat it until smooth - no grit here! 
Added some rum soaked raisins and orange zest.  Right on! I'm buzzed already!

Turned out very good. Right amount of rum for the sweetness. I replaced corn syrup for 100% maple syrup and so glad I did!

It was gritty due to using the granulated sugar.  Needs to use powdered sugar instead.

I made these twice during the holiday season.  The first batch was rolled in either powdered sugar or crystal sprinkles.  The second batch was all powdered sugar.  The rum taste really comes through in a delectable way!  Be careful not to chill in the fridge too long before rolling as it makes it harder to roll into balls.

I made these with Rum and used graham crackers for Christmas.  I thought they were just OK and evidently so did others because they didn’t go as fast as they other treats I made.  Probably won’t make again.

They were a little drier than expected, but tasty. It seemed to take a while to incorporate the ingredients (maybe I had them in the wrong order?).  I tried a variety of rolled coatings (nuts, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and candy sprinkles); the overall "favorite" coating was the candy (the cocoa was particularly disappointing).  This was a great item to take to a holiday party.

Used Bourbon for the office ...always "Let's have liquid lunch" . They turned out very good. A tad over sweet.  Needless to say the office loved them! Rolled half of them in coca and the other half in powdered sugar to change up appearance.

Used bourbon as I preferred the less sweet taste that rum gives. Used graham cracker crumbs vs vanilla wafers- personal preference. Tip: heated bourbon/sugar  in microwave before mixing melted chips & syrup. (this was a tip from another viewer- good call!)

I make these every year and they are FANTASTIC. Everyone raves about them. The recipe as it's written is definitely 5 stars, but over the years I've done a few things to make them even better. (1) Pulverize the Nilla wafers. Completely. We're talking flour.(2) I followed the advice of another user and poured the sugar into the rum and microwaved it until it's completely dissolved. That way you don't get any grainy bits. (3) Throw in an extra splash of rum. Trust me. Worth it! (4) If you coat them in sprinkles, dip them in water first, and wipe them gently on a paper towel. It helps the sprinkles stick . (5) As the recipe states YOU MUST LET THESE AGE FOR AT LEAST ONE WEEK!!! No arguing. Don't even comment if you don't do that. The flavor and texture completely change. The develop into a rum flavored fudge. These are one of my favorite parts of Christmas!

Best  Ever!! They have become a problem... I am not allowed to any holiday event without them!  They HOLD UP GREAT FOR DIPPING!!! (not many recipes do) It is almost Valentine's day and I have rolled and dipped over 250 Amaretto White chocolate balls with Raspberry Drizzle. OK they are delicious and so beautiful....  Let your imagination "roll"-- this basic recipe is wonderful, try it with the graham cracker crumbs-- Have used Grand Mariner (AWESOME) and even Jack Daniels upon request wasn't crazy about them, but he did.

I’ve been using this recipe for 4 yrs now and it’s always a hit. However our first yr we realized Captain Morgan spiced rum doesn’t work well with this recipe, tad too strong. Bacardi Chocolate Sundae rum works and blends perfectly with the chocolate. You get the alcohol without the mast aftertaste.

Super impressed with this recipe. I usually do mine with bourbon and run my wafers through a food processor to make for a smoother mixture and to avoid the gritty texture someone else mentioned. I also heat the bourbon and then add the sugar so it will dissolve. Other than my few adjustments, this is a very good recipe, makes for amazing bourbon balls. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great tasting and easy recipe.  I didn't roll them in ground nuts, and I rolled the balls in powdered sugar more than just once.  I allowed them to mature in the refrigerator in a plastic zipper bag, left partially open so it could breathe.  After a couple of days the sugar was almost completely absorbed into the candy, so I rolled them in sugar a second time, and when it had almost absorbed again, I rolled them a third time.  The only other thing I did differently was that I used a good brandy instead of bourbon or rum (even though I had both).  I served them to some friends we invited over for dinner right before Christmas.  I am now sharing the recipe with those friends because the wife has overheard her husband several times telling his friends how good those brandy balls were. Quite a complement!  Thanks for the recipe!

Well, the flavour was excellent, but I foud the mixture a bit crumbly.  Not sure why this was so.  I am an experienced cook, and followed the recipe exactly.  I added more rum (about 1/4 cup) and another cup of melted chocolate chips.  I also found that the mixture was stiff enough that I did not have to chill it.

Great recipe-   tried Amaretto instead of Bourbon. They came out very good- exactly as you would imagine a traditional holiday ball would taste! I even used gluten free cookies so I could eat them (I have celiac). I just put it in the food processor to grind them up pretty fine.

My sister wanted KY Bourbon balls on her visit to see us in KY.  I made this recipe and another.  I'm not a fan of Bourbon, thus a 4 star rating.  It's a toss up which recipe is better (the other uses Oreo Cookies and powder sugar), BUT of the Bourbon balls that I've had in the past, both recipes are better than others we've tried.  Instead of Rum, I used Rum Chata in one, rolled in sugar.  The other, I used Town Branch Bourbon, rolled in finely ground pecans. I used 1/2 c of pecans in each.

Wow, these are great!  I used Nestle semi sweet chocolate chips and Tortuga coconut rum, from the Bahamas, and black walnuts.  i coated them in a mixture of confectioners sugar and cocoa powder. They were a bit gritty but wow they taste great! I just wish that I made more!

These are awesome.  I've been looking for a good rumball receipe for years, and finally found one.  Will be keeping this one on permanent file.  Only thing I didn't like and will NOT do again is refridgerate the dough.  It made it very difficult to roll the dough into balls.  I'm now letting my dough soften again on the counter to make rolling easier.

I just made these and they are terrific.  I doubled the recipe and while I had to add more vanilla wafers to make up for the bourbon, it was worth it.  Terrific and easy to make!  Try coating with coconut, absolutely fabulous!

I've made a few bourbon/rum ball receipes and this one is bar far the best!  My family can hardly wait to eat them after I've made them.  I have to hide them until they are ready!  I think it's the combination of chochoalte chips and walnuts.  They don't last long.

These are always a hit.  The only thing I like to do is... instead of rolling in chopped nuts, I prefer to place a peacan on top of the ball in a decorative cup just like they do in Kentucky

This sounds like a wonderful recipe and the reviews are all delightful.  I have tried other rum and bourban ball recipes; however, this year I'd like to try tequila and a bit of chili powder to the chocolate cookie mix.  Any thoughts or recommendations?

This recipe called for more rum or bourbon than most recipes. I used bourbon for these and did rum balls using another recipe, even those who usually prefer rum liked these better. Thanks for posting

As written, these were way too strong for me; they tasted like a straight shot of bourbon. Reduced to 1/3 cup bourbon and they were fine. They never really set either time I made them and were quite messy, but good.

Never made rum balls before.  Recipe was easy and they taste great even without waiting seven days.  I made gift bags with 6 each coated with nuts and confectioners sugar.

This is my second year with this recipe, and it's THE one!  I made them to add to cookie trays, last Christmas, with bourbon and the optional nuts.  They were the hit of the tray, and I got a lot of requests for the recipe!  Everyone seems to agree, this is the standard by which to measure all rum balls :).  This year, I made them with rum, and no nuts.  They're also delicious, and I'm packing them with various other homemade candies in tins.  I'm sure these will be a hit, as well.  Fantastic recipe, deserving of 5 full stars!!!

My husband is not a dessert eater but he loved these so much he wouldn't let me take a few to the neighbors. I made them with milk chocolate chips, bourbon, and some crushed pecans.  They were too strong for my taste, but I'm looking forward to trying them in a week.

The rum flavour was nice, but I found they had a gummy consistency, probably from using corn syrup.  Probably won't make again.

I like them but I'm not blown away.  They are pretty strong.  I think the problem may be me, not the recipe.  The wafers and nuts really weren't fine enough.  I will probably try them again. EDIT - I have to change my rating from a 4 star to a 5 star.  It must have been me.  These were all devoured and I was told how incredible they were and asked for the recipe!

This recipe was easy to follow, and they turned out very well - just like I remembered them!  The only thing I would say is that they are a little "rummy" and definitely have an alcohol flavor to them...otherwise they were very good and definitely worth making for the holidays!

I made these for work and they were extremely popular. I am now making these for the family. 

I believe I have found a recipe for the season.

As far as alcohol-laced balls go, this is tasty and very easy.  I was surprised that people cut the alcohol - it's not all that much per ball (I got more than 24), and I can't imagine any kids liking this (mine didn't).  It definitely is bourbon-y, but that's the point.  I did find that the grainy-ness lessened as they sat the full week.

These have a great flavor.  Next time I will use confectioners sugar so there is no sugar grit.

These were easy to make and I have never made rum balls before. Tasted great and a big hit. Overheated my blender trying to crush vanilla wafers, so be careful.

My Aunt and my cousin fought every year over bourbon balls that a friend of the family send over at Christmas.  Never have making these candies before I decided to give them each their very own container of them for Christmas.  They LOVED them, and they will be recieving them every year from here on after.
