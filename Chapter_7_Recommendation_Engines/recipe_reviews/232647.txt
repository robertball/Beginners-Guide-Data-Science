As is, this makes a good base recipe and would only get about 3 stars as it is quite bland. Roasted squash and onion with lots of garlic and chopped red pepper, then added 6 oz fresh baby spinach when combining all ingredients before putting back in the oven. I used Savory Garlic cooking creme and rotini because that's what I had on hand. Couldn't find the Touch of Philly cheese, so I used a store brand cheddar blend. Overall, I enjoyed this meal but feel that I should keep playing with it to make it a true 5 star recipe.

Great recipe. I had leftover squash and this was the perfect way to use it up.  Did not have three cheese so used regular cream cheese.

Made it tonight for supper, both myself and my boyfriend enjoyed it. The butternut squash was sweet and tender, but I thought it was too much of the same taste. It would be better as a side instead of an entree. We also enjoy spicy food so we served up with spicy chili sauce. I was thinking "potluck dish" when I was eating it.

Made it last night, had left over Butternut Squash. Was easy and fast to make, and it was a hit with my daughter and my husband. I will definitely make this again, maybe make some additions to change it up here and there, but it is not necessary for it to taste any better. Very good!

This came out well. I ended up making it two nights in a row. I made it slightly different because I had to substitute regular cream cheese + italian seasoning for the cooking creme.  I put the squash, onion, red pepper, and italian seasoning in the pan with oil, covered, in the oven 30 minutes. At that time, I took it out, added the cream cheese cut in cubes, returned it to the oven, and started the pasta cooking. When pasta was ready, I took it out, mixed it all up with 1/2 of the shredded cheese, then added the pasta, mixed it up, and topped with cheese. I then returned it to the oven about 15 minutes to melt the cheese. On the second try, the only thing I did differently, was I realized the squash ended up mashed, so I just ran it through the mandolin slicer. It seemed to cook faster being in smaller pieces.
