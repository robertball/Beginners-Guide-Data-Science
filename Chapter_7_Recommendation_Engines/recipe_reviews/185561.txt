1 oz. of salt and vinegar chips was not nearly enough to coat the fish for me so I added some salt and pepper kettle style chips that I had on hand. All and all a great recipe but plan on using more chips and less egg. This is one I will use with perch as well as catfish from our pond. Thanks!

What a tasty recipe for something so simple. My mother never tried smallmouth bass before and, in general, does not eat fish except for walleye.  When she tried this salt-and-vinegar-chip recipe, she enjoyed it so much that she now wants me to make it for our next all-fish Christmas Eve family dinner.  I think it will be a hit for everyone at Christmas time.  I didn't change/add a thing.  Perfection cannot be further perfected.  Great recipe!

YUM!  This is a really good recipe and I can't wait to use it for fried chicken! My boyfriend caught some Sea Bass in the San Francisco Bay so I wanted to get a good recipe and am so glad I found this one. I used Pringles S&V Potato Chips and vegetable oil because I didn't have peanut oil.  Topped it with Avacado Mango Salsa (also on this site) and it was so delicious with the perfect crunch - great idea with the potato Chips! Served it with a green salad and french bread - very nice meal!

I used a lot less oil to fry these, I only had a thin layer in my pan.  Instead of the cajun seasoning and lemon pepper, I just used salt and pepper.  Also used much less flour but way more chips.  I've never done a three part breading on fish before and I don't know if that was the reason or the salt and vinegar chips, but I just loved this!

Absolutely incredible!!! However, I think it could almost be called Bass Schnitzel! Never the less, we served the dish with rice (cooked in half chicken broth and half water) and sprinkled lemon on the rice. We also sliced the Bass into 2-3 inch slices, used 2 eggs, and combined all of the dry ingredients except for the cayenne pepper. We put the cayenne pepper on the fish while it was frying. Lastly, instead of using bread crumbs, we crushed high-end stuffing that added a lot more taste and texture. This was an EXCELLENT dish and I can't wait to thank my dad for catching the bass for me! :)

This was good and easy to make.  I used Striped Bass I caught the day before.  

I've never used salt and vinegar chips in a recipe before.  Inventive!

But it lacked a bit in the flavor department and you really only need 2 eggs.  I topped it with some Tapatio hot sauce to make it 5 star.

I was really excited about this recipe because it was very innovative.  It was not bad, but I was not very impressed.  I used tilapia because it is what I had, so maybe the bass would have tasted better.  I liked the crunchiness of the crust, but it really didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  I dipped it into cocktail sauce to give it some taste.

I used gluten free all purpose flour instead of regular flour and it came out great.  Also I used Old Bay seasoning and Lime/Pepper seasoning rather than Cajun and lemon pepper.

Quite good! I found this with a quick search when I decided to cook some Striped Bass that was caught this morning by a neighbor off the coast of Maine.
I didn't have any chips, but I did have Panko crumbs. They came out terrific. I imagine very much the same texture as chips.  I will have to try this again some time while camping.
Didn't get a photo.  Ate it all to fast!

I used a Large Mouth Bass that I caught and cleaned and made filets. One thing I did was soak the filets in milk for a day. The fish came out delicious, without any fishy taste. Thanks for the recipe.
