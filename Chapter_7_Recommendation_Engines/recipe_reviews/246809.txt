Made this for hubby: He said that he liked it! He also said that the onion flavor wasn't strong, but he could get a hint of it. It went really well with the shot of tequila. I did scale this back quite a bit , just for him to try and drizzled the pomegranate in before serving. He said he would drink this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
