I've been making this for years. I've read a lot of reviews where people complained the dough was soggy. The key is to put in a layer of cheese, then your toppings, a spoonful of sauce, then more cheese. The cheese melts and makes a barrier for the sauce. Also, be careful not to get the sauce near the edges or the dough won't seal!

This turned out very well.  However, I would note that (at least in my oven at 400) 30 minutes is too long.  20 minutes did it for ours.  I didn't like the crust but, of course, that is to be blamed on the brand of crust I chose (a generic store brand - you live and you learn) and not the recipe itself.  While eating it, I thought that instead of brushing the stomboli with butter, perhaps garlic butter might have given the crust more flavor.  Regardless, this is a great recipe.  The possibilities are endless and limited only by your imagination - adding whatever fillings you like.  It was a top notch recipe for a family favorite! Enjoy!

I decided to make my own dough, using my bread maker.  It was really easy.  To make the dough, use:

3/4 c. lukewarm water, 1 tbl. oil, 2 1/4 c. whole wheat flour, 1/2 tsp. sugar, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 2 tblsp. yeast.  Use the dough cycle and voila!  I also added 1/2 tsp. each of fresh oregano, basil, and rosemary to the dough to add a little extra kick.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  This is definitely a keeper!!

Excellent recipe.  You can use crescent dinner rolls....2 cans of 8....for the crust.  The filling is really versatile...can change it.  Great taste.

GREAT NEW RECIPE!! I used 1 lb of mild Italian sausage, a 1/2 cup more pizza sauce and some cheddar cheese in addition to the moz.  I had alot of extra meat/sauce mix and I'm pretty sure that if I would have had the pizza dough available, I could have made two.  I might try that next time...because we all agree this should be made again.  Thanks so much Jessica! It's a neat spin-off from your typical pizza!

I made stromboli from scratch only one other time and never did it again because it was too much trouble for a weeknight meal.  I love this recipie because it's so easy to do, and tastes great.  I made mine even easier to do by just lining the dough with pepperoni, green pepper, onions and topping it off with sauce and cheese.  The family loved it!  The veggies were fork tender but still had a little crispness to it.  Thanks Jessica for a great new recipie!

Great Recipe!  Whenever I use pepperoni in a recipe I line a plate with 2 papertowels, lay the pepperoni in a single layer, place another papertowel on top and microwave for 1 minute and 10 seconds, you will be happy with all the grease you are NOT eating!  Just wanted to share....

This recipe was delicious, quick and a simple way of getting veggies into your kids (& hubby for that matter! :)).  Instead of making one giant stromboli, I split the pizza dough into 4 pieces and made smaller versions.  I used 6 oz of fresh mushrooms but the same proportions of everything else and found that I had at least a cup of leftover filling that I used w/ pasta the next day.  Also I found that 1/4 c butter is a LOT.  I used 2 tbs and that was plenty to saturate & glaze the strombolis.  THey were just as yummy reheated in the oven the next day!

this was great. I used olive oil and mixed garlic powder and Italian seasoning. I brushed that on the inside and outside of the Stromboli.

Delicious and easy to make.  I bought a 13.8 oz pizza crust and used all the mixture.  When I browned the ground beef, I threw everything else in there for around 7 minutes to soften up the vegetables and let the flavors blend together.  This recipe only calls for half the pepperoni they suggest.

This was really yummy and fun to make. We bought a large ball of pizza dough from the bakery section of the grocery store, so we had plenty of room for all the sauce and extra cheese. We added pepperoni, black olives and ground sausage. I'm definitely going to make this again, but next time with ground beef instead of sausage (it was a bit too rich). Thanks for the great recipe!!

I just made this Stromboli tonight, and everybody (even the pickiest members of my house) LOVED it!! I did make a few changes to the original recipie:  1.) Instead of the pizza dough, I used Butter Garlic Crescent rolls by pressing the seams together.  2.)When my hamburger was almost done, I added my onions and green peppers to the mix and let them cook for a few minutes. 3.)I also added Italian seasoning and chili powder for extra flavor.   4.)I used sliced ham instead of cubed. 5.)I also added hard salami to the ham, burger, and pepperoni and it made it so much better!!   6.)I baked it for only 20 minutes and it was the perfect degree of done-ness. My family will certainly be making this recipe over and over again!!!

Well i am the one that submitted this. I am so gald that everyone enjoyed it. My husband is also from Scotland so it was for me to bring something from home to here. I live in a village called Broxburn where no one heard of alot of this stuff.  I am happy that everyone likes it and please if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask. Use what you want it in it. This is a good way to get kids to eat veggies. My mom used it and i love it.

Very tasty filling but did make a few changes to the ingredient amounts.  I used 2 pizza dough packages, 1 pound of ground beef (sweet italian sausage would be a good alternative), half of a red onion (they are usually pretty large) and 2 cups of mozzarella.  I spread the entire first package of dough on the largest cookie sheet I owned.  I simmered all the filling ingredients for a few extra minutes so the green pepper wouldn't be so crunchy.  I spread the entire package of pepperoni on the dough (leaving a 1 inch border)...spooned the entire ground beef concoction over the pepperoni...used every bit of cheese to cover....then placed the other package of dough over the entire mixture and pinched the edges together all the way around.  I brushed melted butter over the stromboli and then made 4 slits over the top. This makes 8 HEARTY servings.  I also suggest on using more sauce...just so you have something to dunk your stromboli in.  All in all, Jessica did an excellent job with taste.

This recipe was a hit with my husband, who is from Scotland and had never heard of stromboli.  It was delicious and very easy to prepare.  I used frozen pizza dough, so the only part that took time was waiting for the dough to thaw.  We'll definitely have this one again.

Gotta admit, I did not have really high hopes for this recipe.  I knew it wouldn't be bad, but I didn't think it would be as great as it was!  It tasted better than what you'd get in a restaurant.  It was gone!  I used refrigerated pizza dough in the tube, folded in half.  Then layered pepperoni (the big sandwich slices), Genoa salami, shredded cheese, and Italian sausage spaghetti sauce (what I had on hand), and one more layer of pepperoni. I rolled it up and then brushed with melted butter and sprinkled garlic powder and Italian seasoning. I also sprinkled cornmeal on the baking pan.  Baked at 400 for 20 minutes! SO GOOD!

First I used Colleen's Potato Crescent Roll recipe on this site for the crust. I used small pepperonis, and 1 mozzerella sausage. The pizza sauce was a garlic and herb spaghetti sauce, and I spread homemade garlic butter on top. (Garlic powerder, non hydrogenated margarine, and dried parsley.)
The crust was sweet and so was the pizza sauce. The meat had strong flavor that came through the sweetness and it was fantastic!

I have been making Stromboli for awhile.This is a nice change from the lunch meat versions. I also use garlic and oregano inside and out. I slice the leftovers, put them in baggies, then pop them in the freezer. My husband and I just grab one on the way to work.

This has become a weekly meal for our family.  I use the bread machine dough recipe included in these reviews.  However, I use 2 tsp instead of 2 Tbsp of yeast.  This is a very easy and quick meal that kids love.

This was amazing!  My first home-made Stromboli was a total success!  I followed the recipe execpt that I did sautee the onion and bell pepper (as my husband and I don't like them raw tasting)but that was the only change.  I think I may have added a little too much sauce, as it split a little in the middle, and I was worried that it might get a little soggy, but it was still perfect!  thanks for a great recipe!

Nice. I actually used bought a thin crust pizza dough because it was already in a square shape so it wasn't hard to prepare. I did what another reviewer suggested and put cheese first on the dough to create a barrier between the dough and sauce so the dough didn't come out soggy. It worked. I didn't put all of the same ingredients in; just some ham, turkey pepperoni, and onions. I also think that 30 minutes is too much time. I only baked my stromboli for half that and it came out with a golden crispy crust and was light and fluffy on the inside, which I prefer. Although, I have a convection bake oven so that might have an effect on the outcome. I forgot to brush butter on until halfway through cooking and when I did I also sprinkled some garlic powder on top. I think that really adds some flavor and makes it an extra special treat. All in all, I think stromboli is a quick, delicious and super flexible dish that you can adjust to your preferences. I will make it again.

This was a delicious meal!  I just used the toppings my family likes on pizza.  Canadian bacon, pineapple, mushrooms, onions, feta, mozzerella, pepperoni.  There weren't any leftovers!

Fantastic recipe!  Easy and can be revised to suit your taste.  I used fresh mushrooms vs. the canned, added roasted red pepper, sweet italian sausage vs. the ground beef, fresh garlic, turkey pepperoni along with onions and bell pepper ~ YUM!  Had no issues with the dough and my husband thought it was spectacular! Will continue to make this one!

Very good.  Next time I won't put the sauce in and will just leave it for dipping.

This turned out really good.  I used the Pillsbury Pizza dough in the tube and I did saute some peppers, onions & fresh mushrooms with the beef.  Then drained that really well before adding the chopped up ham bits and sauce.  Used turkey pepperoni and non-fat cheese.  I sprayed the folded over stromboli with Butter Pam and dusted with some corn meal.  YUMMM  Thank you for this recipe!

Our family loves to make these on Friday nights instead of ordering a pizza.  I didn't add mushrooms cause no one likes them.  I did add italian seasoning, and use sliced provolone instead of shredded cheese.  I have tried putting the red sauce in these before and think there are not as easy to roll up.  Instead I find it much easier to serve the sauce as a dipping sauce!

This is a super recipe, I have made this many times, the recipe makes a ton of filling (I usually make spagetti the next day to use the leftover filling)  I usually like to split the dough to make 4-6 individual stromboli's.  A little time consuming and messy, but well worth it, thanks for a super recipe!!

Everybody liked it.  Since reviewers had said there was lots of sauce left over I got two crusts and made two... doubled most everything except the pizza sauce and had a perfect amount.  30 minutes is definitely too long... ours was on the verge of being burnt.

Yummy, everyone asked for seconds! I made two of these using two pkgs of pizza dough. Mixed in 1 and a half jars of pizza sauce and the rest I heated and served as a dipping sauce at the table. I used 1lb beef, left out the ham, and used 2 cups cheese for each, left the other amounts alone. And, as others have pointed out....it is done at 20 minutes!! I will make this again but will look for a better tasting pizza sauce.

I thought it was ok but the family loved it. Maybe it was the choice of pizza crust I used so I will try another one next time. I will use chunk pepperoni and canadian bacon next time to spice it up a bit.

I've never made this before but my hubby LOVES them, well he LOVED this and said it was the best he's had in years! I too only had to cook it for 20 mins in my oven and took the notes from others and layered the cheese first to prevent a soggy bottom. I will be making this again for sure!

Good.  I overstuffed it so had to add another bread layer but this goes together easily.  The hardest part is rolling the dough over the filling.  I love tomato sauce so although it calls for it I still ended up dipping into sauce when serving it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great - I made this recipe (minus green bell pepper) and then a couple others that were more unique -one had steak and chicken, and another was roasted veggies.  But the original recipe was the BEST!  Everyone loved it, so tasty!

O.M.Gosh.  This was awesome!  Wasnt sure what to expect as mine was looking nothing like the picture.  All I had was a cake pan, which I think made it work out even better.  I was able to drape the dough over the sides so that helped to square it up, so it held ALL the filling, which there was LOTS, and then it pinched up together on top and on the ends very nicely.  As others mentioned, it did only take about 20 - 22 minutes.  The crust on the bottom was not soggy.  I used a can of thin crust in the long tube.  This was thick, it stayed together, it looked beautiful coming out of the oven and it tasted amazing!  Bravo!  Thank you for sharing.

This was very easy to make, but not a big hit in our house. BAJ complained the whole time about the beef, but he did eat his entire serving. I just didn't like it, but I'm not such a great test case these days.  I made a few substitutions... I used a cubanelle pepper instead of a bell. I omitted the pepperoni, and used spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce.  There's a picture on allrecipes, and their creation looks very different from mine... perhaps a slice of ham might have changed the texture/flavor instead of the diced ham I used. I also folded my dough in half, instead of creating a log like a typical stromboli... this made it VERY difficult to cut.  I also found that this got overcooked, and came very close to burning after 20 minutes at the recommended temperature.  Soo, maybe I'll make a stromboli this way again, but not with this particular filling.

I couldnt believe how easy this was to make. I made my own dough and sauce to save some money and it was still quick. I did cut the sauce and cheese amounts in half and I would do the same in the future. I not only pinched the ends closed but folded about 1/2 inch from the bottom over the top. It stayed secure that way. Let sit a few minutes for the cheese to set before cutting into it. Mine was done after 20 minutes.

I always thought Stromboli was hard to make. I'm now convinced otherwise. This recipe made it easy, healthy and was great tasting. Since my family loves it, Iv'e added it to my recipe box.
Used fresh mushrooms, and cut butter in half.  Couldn't fit 8 oz. of pepperoni on dough. Used about 5-6 oz.

As posted, this was only OK.  30 minutes is way too long to bake - I'll try 15-20 next time.  I also added other toppings and more cheese.  A good place to start, though!

Very quick and easy stromboli recipe!!  It is really good, too!!!  I used mild sausage in place of the hamburger.  I only put the peppers & onions on one half, since my son doesn't like them.  I also used 4 different cheeses.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will make it again!!

Delicious. Next time I'll try making my own dough. I did make my own pizza sauce, which included using green pepper, sliced mushrooms, and an onion, so I didn't follow this recipe exactly. For filling: used some extra sliced mushrooms, not canned, 1/2 lb. sausage, cut into small chunks, 1 cup ground turkey, only 3 oz pepperoni (gets too greasy), and some broccoli. When the sausage was almost browned, I threw in the sliced mushrooms and broccoli to soften them a bit. I also brushed olive oil on the top instead of butter.

This is amazing! I used canned pizza dough, layered mozzarella cheese 1st, then the mixture and then more cheese and baked at 400 for 20 minutes. Will make again

I made this recipe tonight for a trial run.  I am in charge of making 2 Strombolis for thanksgiving and have never made a Stromboli before. Let's just say my husband went for 2nds and now 3rds :-) so I guess I will be making this for thanksgiving day for Football watching enjoyment. They only thing I did differently was removed the ham.  I used 90% lean ground beef, mushrooms, red onion, pepperoni and green bell pepper. The thing I loved about this meal is that it was not greasy at all. Great meal!

I have found instead of using pizza sauce which makes stromboli a little gooey, use sun dried tomatoes.

This was a big hit with the family! Instead of store bought pizza sauce, I made a triple batch of the Easy Pizza Sauce II that is at this site. I didn't have ham, but I had everything else, and I had bulk pepperoni so I cut it in pieces instead of slices. I reserved some of the sauce for dipping/topping, and the rest went into the mixture, and I used two ready made pizza dough packages I got on sale. Plenty of filling to go around, and now all I have to do is make another batch of dipping sauce for the second stromboli that only needs to be reheated on another day! Time saving dinner!

Yum!  I put some cheese on the dough, overlapped the pepperoni, added the mixture, then topped with some more cheese.  Had no problems with soggy crust.

I just tried this recipe and it fantastic. I recently discovered the Winter Garden Pizza Company in Winter Garden, Florida. They make great stromboli. It is in beautiful, brink-paved, downtown Winter Garden. Unfortunately it is about 35 miles from my home. So going down there all the time is impractical. But this recipe comes close. I bought a prepared Italian pizza dough ball from the Publix bakery. I rolled it out, layered the bottom with sliced mozzarella cheese, then a layer of ham, then a layer of pepperoni, followed by a layer of capicola, and finally another layer of cheese. All of them purchased at the Publix deli. I folded the sides and ends over and sealed them with butter. Then I brushed the outside with butter and sprinkled on some granulated garlic. I put some steam holes in it and then I baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. I served the marinara sauce on the side. My wife and son raved over it. No leftovers tonight. Great stromboli.

I used MANDYEHALE'S pizza recipe (had all her ingredients on hand) and instead of pepperoni, not on hand, I used mild Italian sausage. The beef and sausage were pre-cooked til all pink was gone and then grease poured off. Heaven help us!  Best stromboli we've ever had.  This is on my Super Bowl menu and a great choice for a weekend lunch or dinner with a tossed salad.  Many thanks for sharing!!

These can be made with cheese and steak, eggs and fried peppers, ham and cheese, you name it. They can also be done rolled then cut into bun-like and cooks. Kind of a boli bun.. Or made this way as mini boli buns... as an appetizer.

I think I would've liked it more if I had been able to add all the extras, like the bell pepper and onion, to my stromboli!  My kids are very, very picky, and all I put in it was the sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.  My husband loved it, and requested that I make it again!!  Next time I will make a special one just for me!

This was really good. I have made this before and the top is always soggy the dough never cooks through so I decided to cut the already made rolled dough in half then roll each one out and fill each one... Very very good worked out great this way. I should have used a little extra pizza sauce than I did because it was a little dry, I would have used the extra pizza sauce to dip them in but I used the leftover meat mixture and pizza sauce to make pizza pasta from this site. They were both good.

This was a great fast meal.  I did change a few things, no bell pepper, fresh mushrooms, white onion, and added a can of diced green chiles. 1/4 c. of butter was WAY to much and cooked for 20 mins not 30.  I will make again and try it with italian sausage.  it's a keeper!

I just used this recipe for a base to go off of. I live in a small town and the small grocery store did't have refrigerated crust so I bought a Jiffy mix and it worked just fine.  I added sauce, ground beef, and the pizza toppings my husband likes, folded it over and had a great meal.  My husband loves calzones (more like what my "stromboli" ended up being, and he was quite impressed!

It was okay.  Not a fan of Pillsbury pizza dough though.  Too sweet.  If I make this again I will simmer the ingredients for 20-30 minutes before assembling.  The flavors did not mix until the next day.  I did have plenty of leftover sauce that I will try again with.  Thanks anyway.

This was a great hit!  My husband loved it!  I only used half a package of pepperoni and I upped the ground beef to 1 lb.  That gave me enough left over to have it again another night.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for supper tonight and it was a big hit. It looks more like a giant calzone to me rather than stromboli but it was good. I used a little more than a lb. of italian sausage and left out the ham and ground beef. I had a larger pizza crust and it still did not need a whole pk of pepperoni. I did not use the green pepper and added italian seasoning and garlic to the meat mixture. Watch it while its cooking. At 20 mins mine was ALMOST too brown, 30 mins would have burned it. We had it with a big mixed green salad!

Husband loves Stromboli but other recipes we have tried (made with cressant roll dough instead of pizza dough) came out very soggy, this is the closest we have come without making it from scratch the hard way.

This recipe was THE BEST stromboli I have ever had. Although, I haven't had many stromboli, this was the first one I have ever made and it was GREAT! I think the sauce mixture was what made it great. I left out the mushrooms because I HATE them, and it still turned out wonderfully. And yes, you will have left over sauce. And i even cut the sauce in 3/4. Cook time is wonderful because it doesn't take long at all. Thanks for sharing the recipe jessica!

This was VERY delicious but a couple of changes I made are:
 - A bit MORE sauce because who doesn't like a saucy pizza/stromboli? Plus, having extra JUST SAUCE on the side for dipping is a No-Brainer IMHO. 
 - Being a Guy (I suppose) I tend to work faster so my ingredients don't get moldy before I can even complete assembling, much less cooking.

OMG take that heat down!!!! 400 degrees is way too high for way too long. That is why I'm giving 2 stars, as the stromboli was burnt following directions as written. The filling, everything else was fine.
Next time I try, I'm going 350 for 30 minutes and seeing how that works.

I used 1 lbs hot sausage and sliced ham instead of chunked ham and hamburger. I also used a pizza dough recipe that I have for my bread machine. Our friends loved it. It was a very easy recipe.It made 3 strombolis 10 to 12 inches long.

We also used Pillsbury refrigerated pizza crust. After assembling, I brushed the dough with a thin layer of whipped egg, olive oil, basil, garlic powder and Parmesan. Next time, we need to add more cheese. Overall, they turned out great, but needed more cheese. We also dipped them in warm marinara.

Made exactly as described. IT was awesome and will become my new “go to” appetizer. Going to make it next without the burger and use ham, salami and sandwich pepperoni.

I love this recipe it was very easy to make my whole family love it. I was cooking and my son asked can he help we had a lot of fun making it. The only thing I didn't used store bought pizza dough I made my own from scratch. I also mince three cloves of garlic and added them to the ground beef while I was cooking it. 
Thanks for this recipe Jessica.

Nope. Even took the suggestion to put the cheese directly on the crust first. Look for a different recipe.

We only altered a few things.  We seasoned the beef with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and oregano. Sauteed the green pepper (cut into strips), yellow onion (half rings) and mushrooms (fresh not canned) until everything was softened.  We also added some diced fresh tomatoes.  After sealing it shut and coating in just enough butter to coat the top we shredded some Parmesan cheese on top and baked it until it was golden brown.  Was just as good as what we order from the pizza place.  Will definitely be making it again.

Was good and plan to make again. Will probably use less butter next time or different kind/brand of pizza dough since it came out tasting more like a biscuit.

This was ok. Kind of tasted like pizza and sloppy joes together. We made one giant Stromboli which was hard to cut into individual servings because the filling would fall out. I would suggest separating the dough into 4 pieces and make 4 individual servings that will be self contained.

Didn't care for the ground beef. If I make it again I will eliminate that. My picky eater didn't care for the Pillsbury dough so I'll have to find a different dough...or I'll just stick to pizza.

This was excellent! I didn't have all of the ingredients so I used two cans of croissant dough. 4 triangles makes 2 rectangles. Put ingredients on one rectangle, fill  and top with the other and seal the edges. I used  cooked prosciutto, salami and canadian ham for the meat and provolone and mozzarella for the cheese. Also 400 is too high for the croissant dough. Reduce to 350

Great recipe~!! I have made Stromboli several times. I put more ingredients on the inside; ham, pepperoni, sausage, ground chuck (both the sausage and ground chuck I pre-cook), marinara sauce, cheese, green bell pepper, onion, and if my family wants black olives, and mushrooms. Now I know not to "overstuff" them.

Great quick week night meal hubby & kids loved! I made two for our family of five, including two teenage boys. I had one pizza crust dough on hand and a crescent roll dough (not our favorite). I made one as recipe indicated and a Hawaiian with crescent roll dough. Next time I'm going to just make Hawaiian though for even quicker meal prep(Canadian bacon, pineapple tidbits & baby bella mushrooms) with pizza dough as is our family's favorite pizza toppings.

Made this using 1 lb ground chicken, instead of beef. Did not have pepperoni, so didn't put anything on the dough. 30 minutes made the bottom burn on the 2 stromboli's that I made. I think 350 degrees for 20 minutes would have one it. Used 1/2 of a large can of whole peeled tomatoes, some mushrooms and onion. Added garlic to the veggies and it was delicious. Hubby liked itand we have enough leftovers for 2 more lunches. Happened to have 2 pizze dough crusts in frig that needed to be used. Thanks for the recipe.

We used pre-made pizza dough from the Breadsmith which made this super good & easy.  We cooked it the full 30min as we like lots of meats, vegies & cheese.  Looks professional when done!

Very good, but add a little more sauce. Make sure you don't over stuff the dough.

I tweaked this recipe a bit & for fillings on one:  Deli Ham & Cheddar Cheese.  On the other:  Pizza sauce, pepperoni, olives & mozzarella.  You could do about anything with a stromboli!  My next one:  My homemade Pesto, chicken breast thinly sliced, mozzarella.... mmmmmmm....

Great recipe - this was really good!  Mine turned pretty dark on top - I think next time I will reduce the cooking time a little.  But the filling was great - I added oregano & garlic to mine.  thanks!

Instead of making one big one I cut the dough so as to feed four and added a few extra toppings. You can play with this one a lot.

This was ok. The ground beef was rather bland, and needed some seasoning, but there was WAY too much meat/veggie mixture for one package of pizza dough. Husband thought it was ok. I doubt I'd make it again. Thanks anyway.

This was very good. My picky son even liked it. My husband wasn't a huge fan because of the bell peppers. I'll probably just skip them next time. I made a couple of changes: I skipped the ham and mushrooms, used only 1/2 of the red onion and added a chopped jalapeno and some dried basil. Other reviewers were right about 8 oz of pepperoni being too much! I ended up using about 4 oz. Also-I used a Pillsbury pizza crust that was about 13 oz. and I didn't have any of the sauce mixture left over.

VERY good, family loved this one--tastes just like a stuffed pizza.  Used refrigerated, pre-packaged pizza dough and the crust came out almost pastry like (yum!).  Will definitely do this again and maybe experiment with our own preferences on toppings.

very good but for some reason my crust was too hard on the outside. I made it pretty thick but maybe too much flour.

I made this last night.  It was quick and easy.  There was definitely leftover sauce, which I froze.  I substituted jalepeno for bell pepper and used sausage instead of beef.  I also used the Betty Crocker dough mix because there was no pre-made dough at the sore.  It was so easy to make and turned out fantastic!
