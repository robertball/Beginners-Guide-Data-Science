I have tried several ladoo recipes and this one is the best by far.  It is so good that an Indian bride recently asked me to make the ladoo for her wedding reception!!

A coffee grinder works well to grind the coconut and almonds, but I have found that cardamom seeds grind best in a mortar and pestle.

Made this for a dinner party where no one had had ladoo before.  Most people thought it was "interesting," and finished their ball, but didn't ask for more.  This will be liked by those who do not like very sugary sweets.

The Ladoo's were great. But here is the few things I'd change. First, you have to roast the flour for 15-20 minutes, 10 minutes won't do good. 

To check whether the flour is ready do this, after the first five minutes smell the flour, and then keep doing that ever 5 minute interval. 

The smell should be nutty, kind of almondish. 


Finally, give this enough time to cool. Ghee cools down really well and you can get a good consistency, but it has to cool. Let it sit in the fridge for five to six minutes. 

once you see you have the right consistency (kind of like butter at room temp). You should be able to shape the batter in your hands. If you want to cool the batter outside fridge, give it about half an hour or so, to achieve the consistency. 



I've never made ladoos before and the timing thing was really bad and the reason that I gave the recipe for

Tried it last night, followed recipe only leaving out the coconut. The besan flour tasted raw after roasting for more than 20 mins, stayed powdery and not pasty. Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

I made this on Saturday night, I love ladoo! However the recipe said 3/4 Ghee, and 2 cups basen! I canâ€™t tell you how wrong that is. That is just too much ghee and not enough basen. I had to add at least another cup of basen. Also, it needed more sugar. I will try to make again this way I can be certain of the recipe. But thank you for sharing.

Wow.  Interesting.  Very "beany"!  Must be an acquired taste.
