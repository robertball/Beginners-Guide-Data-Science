This was a huge hit at a party we threw last week. we added 2 links of chorizo sausage (pre-cooked in a skillet, without the skins). we also added a quarter cup of milk to make it more creamy. folks spent half the party rotating around the crockpot. awesome.

I made this for my Superbowl party, and people kept walking in front of the TV to get more! Be aware that this recipe makes a lot.

This was a very good dip, and it makes a lot. It was too much for my dip crock pot. Next time I think I'll add more salsa.

Loved it - all the boys that came over couldn't keep their hands away from it.  Would like to add some kind of meat to it next time just to make it a little heartier, but it doesn't need anything extra.  I wasn't sure what type of salsa to use but I ended up getting a can of salsa from the mexi aisle, don't remember the brand, but it seems like an authentic brand - not el paso or ortega.  You could prob use rotel instead as well.

This was delicious! I have had all these ingredients together before, but it was never warm and that made such a difference. Thanks.

I thought this was pretty good, it tasted a little processed to me, but I think with all that Velveeta, that's bound to happen.  I didn't use all of the 2lbs for that very reason.  I took it to a game night at some friends' house and they all raved about it, calling it "wicked good"

It was good but by the reviews I expected it to be better.  The recipe doesn't sound like it makes very much, but it does.  I doubled it and I had lots left over.  It just seemed to be missing somthing.  I think I would have liked it better if I would have browned up ground beef and added it to it.  But I don't think I will make it for awhile because the smell of it is really bothering me.  Just needed somethng else.

This is great! My sister in law makes a similar dip that is very labor intensive, but this one is extremely easy, and just as good!!  Really easy to adjust the heat level on this too.  An all around great party recipe. Thank you for sharing!

I made this dip for a pot luck and was so thrilled at how good it turned out.  Everyone loved it.  And as someone else posted it does make more than you think.

Will definatly make this again.

So much better than the usual chili/green peppers/cheese version of this dip, with no more effort. I made fresh pico de gallo for the salsa, and used seeded jalape√±os for the peppers. I tossed in a little green onion I had left from another recipe. It was declared a hit, and none was left.  Thanks for this easy, tasty dip.

So good and so easy too! I wouldn't change it a thing. As written, this recipe is perfect. I may throw in some ground beef down the road--as another reviewer suggested--but that would just be for variety and to make  the recipe heartier, not because it is lacking in any way. 

I cut the block of Velveeta into small squares of equal size so that it would melt evenly.

Great stuff.

Used hot Hormel chili and medium salsa and taco sauce. Easy and went over well at football party. .
