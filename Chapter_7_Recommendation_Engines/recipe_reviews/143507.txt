I don't know what the other cooks here are doing wrong but this is a fabulous salsa!  I didn't add the mango and added a fine diced jalapeno and it's great with jerk chicken or on fish or even with cinnamon chips!
Fabulous side and very fresh!

This was the worst tasting salsa I have ever had. I was so disappointed, what a waste of a perfectly good pineapple and mango! The combination of flavors was terrible and it smelled awful.

I love pineapple and I love salsa. I took this recipe and added the fruit to my tomato salsa and it was off the hook fantastic!!!!  The fruit mixture added to the salsa flavor and makes for a great dish with chips and guacamole.

this is a great dish!  I used a vidalia onion instead of the kind listed, and I did not use the whole one.  If I did, I think the onion flavor would be WAY too strong.  I also just used canned pineapple and it was great!  I used this to accompany a spicy caribbean jerk chicken dish and it served as a delicious cooling agent, and the left overs were great with chips!

OMG Delicious   I left out the cilantro, because my whole family HATES it, and I added a finely chopped jalapeno pepper and a tablespoon of honey.  FANTASTIC  My new favorite thing.  Will serve it over white rice and with shrimp, fish, chicken and maybe even pork on the grill !  YUM

I made this salsa for a party and it was a big hit!  It paired wonderfully with Margarita shrimp.  Its bright flavors make for a nice balance with spicier dishes.  I did add a diced jalapeno to the double batch I made, and it added a nice kick.

Great blend of flavors--love it with the jalapeño.  It helps balance the sweetness of the mango and pineapple.  I will be serving this at our barbecue this weekend.

Delicious pairing with mahi mahi. I didn't have jalapeño, so I added some cayenne pepper and a tablespoon of honey. It turned out very well. I also had very fresh, ripe, and flavorful pineapple and mango, the juices of which made the flavors combine beautifully. A really great summer addition to any meal.

I didn't process the fruit.  I chopped it, added a little zest from the lime and served on a salad with grilled chicken! Very fresh and delicious!

Parsley instead of Cilantro. Love fruit salsa with all meats. Perfect summer twist.
