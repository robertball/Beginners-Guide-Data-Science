"Very healthy"?  Sorry -- no way.  Not with almost 2000g of salt in one serving (enough for one day).  Try using fewer canned ingredients and more fresh ones.

Awesome quick and easy soup.  Modifications I made were the following:
Used black beans instead of kidney beans (wife does not care for kidney beans)
Added a can of diced tomatoes and chilis
Seasoned with garlic, white pepper, and black pepper.
Topped with Mexican shredded cheese and fried tortilla strips.
SIMPLY AWESOME!!!
Leftovers I used basic tortilla chips with the shreeded cheese and it was just as good (if not better after letting the flavors meld overnight).

This turned out excellent, but only after I made a few changes. I added extra cumin, some garlic salt, a can of Rotel Mexican tomatoes with cilantro, peppers, lime and diced tomatoes and also added a small package of Velveeta cheese. Instead of plain cubed chicken breast meat, I bought a rotisserie chicken at Sam's and shredded that up. I LOVE Mexican and TexMex food, and with a little bit of shredded Monterey Jack on top and some crumbled tortilla chips, this made the perfect-tasting Mexican soup. I will definitely make this slightly varied version again!

Excellent and easy soup!! I added 3 1/2 cups of broth and a little more corn and it was a nice thick and colorful soup.  Sprinkled cheese over each bowl and this dinner was a HUGE hit!! Will be making this again!!  Thank you Bette!!

This was a good start to a really great soup. I added my usual garlic and onion powders, chili powder, black beans, pepperoncini for some spice and instead of the stewed tomatoes, I used a large jar of salsa. My leftover pork tenderloin from Sunday's dinner worked well with this. Family came back for seconds and I'm happy to say there's just enough left for lunch today. Thank you!

VERY GOOD!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  The second time we were out of stewed tomatoes so I just added rotel and it was just as good.  We always top it with sour cream and cheddar cheese and eat with scoops tortilla chips.  This recipe is definitely going into my book of regulars!

Delicious Soup! I'm basing my rating on the 2 changes I made...I didn't add the green pepper because I didn't have any, and I added a can of black beans. It was delcious and simple to make! Topped each serving with sour cream and some cheddar cheese. I served it with corn bread muffins..yummy dinner! 
Thanks for a great recipe!!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I served this with corn muffins and it was a very hearty meal. This is a great weeknight recipe as it is very easy to throw together and the ingredients are items usually found in your pantry. I will definitely make this soup again.

Thank you!  My husband came home from work with a cold, and I needed a soup, quickly!  I followed your recipe, except that I didn't have peppers or chiles on hand.  I used canned chicken, kidney and garbanzo beans, and 1/2 cup of salsa.  I had shredded mozzerella, so I put it on top with some sliced avocado, and tortilla chips on the side. It was perfect!  My husband loved it, and so did I!

Made some changes but the recipe really helped me make a delicious chicken tortilla soup.  I have been searching for such a recipe!  Used 18 oz of southwest style grilled chicken strips, shredded.  Used black beans instead of kidney, added a can of Rotel (use variety you like best) along with the stewed tomatoes, added 1/4 of fresh jalapeno, seeded and diced instead of canned green chile, added 15 oz can of corn instead of 1 cup, added 8 oz of Velveeta pepperjack cheese, used 3 cans of reduced sodium chicken broth, also added a bunch of fresh chopped cilantro while cooking.  It was SO good.  After it was ready, added a dollop of non-fat greek yogurt, more fresh cilantro, a spoonful of pico de gallo, about 1/3 avocado, cut into thin strips or diced, and tortilla strips, broken into large pieces-add as much as you like while eating soup.  My husband and I loved this soup and wished we had doubled it!

This was SOOO good and so easy!! I've tried several recipes for "tortilla soup", but they were all very bland. This one had so much flavor!! The only thing I added was lime juice and I didn't use onion or bell pepper....and it was still great even without them! My husband even went back for seconds and took leftovers for lunch....that NEVER happens!! We will be eating this again!

This was really good.  I used about half this much chicken and it ws more than enough.  The only thing I would change is chopping the chicken in smaller pieces instead of shredding.

IT WAS AWESOME...ON DAY 2.  My suggestion, let it sit overnight............... after following this exactly minus beans, it was a little flavorless until the flavors melded overnight...

Wow. I doubled it. Used kidney beans and chilli beans, used home made broth, added a habanero and one more can of corn, and about 2 Tbs of taco seasoning, and 1/2 Tbs of red pepper flakes. Very good and easy to make. I will make this again for sure.

This was great!  Such a hearty soup and so easy to make!  I asked my boyfriend whether he liked it and got a resounding, "Mhmmm..."  I added 250ml more chicken broth, because the 850ml didn't seem like enough (I am not really good at measuring out ingredients and just throw them in as I see fit).  I used canned goods this time, but will make it with fresh foods in the future to lower the sodium.

This was fantastic and insanely easy to make! I doubled the amount of kidney beans, green and red peppers and broth, but you can basically do this whole recipe to taste. Also, I added fresh chopped cilantro and avocado to the top as a garnish...yum!

This was the first time I have made soup and it turned out great! My husband said "super duper" and he is very picky and very honest. I did cook the chicken with taco seasoning which I think gave it more flavor. I topped the soup with diced avacados, sour cream and shredded mexican cheese! The avacados were really good in it! The leftovers were excellent as well! I will definately be making this again!

Wow, what a great dish! The only changes made were to increase the chicken stock to 3 cups (it cooks down very fast on a gas stove) and I can't get green chiles here, so I omited that. Was still spicy and flavorful. Thanks!

Very good soup! I had to do my usual substitue ingredients, I used what was on hand. I used refried beans, pinto beans, dehydrated bell peppers, fresh tomatoes and canned chicken; everything else was as called for.  The soup was very good and it filled my 7 kids and husband very well.

Very good soup and easy to make.  I didn't have and bell peppers, but didn't miss them.  For those concerned about the sodium content, there is low-sodium tomatoes, frozen corn and low-sodium chicken broth, which definitely brings it down considerably.  I did add 3 cloves of crushed garlic for additional flavor, and will be making this again.

This was sooo good! I doubled the recipe and added some rotel tomatoes with green chiles, a can of green chiles, a can of black beans (instead of two cans of kidney beans), a clove of garlic, and a jalapeño. Delicious! I paired it with some tacos and homemade churros for dessert. It was a wonderfully colorful meal. I would recommend it to anyone!

This is the best soup base ever.  By simply changing the spices, the soup can go from Mexican to Italian to Thai.  I have made it and added sausage for a Louisiana flair too.  Make the base and store in freezer for quick dinners!

This was very good! I added chic peas to mine and omited the green chile peppers (only because my toddler would be eating it). When it was cooking I was wondering how good it was really going to be. I served it with old cheddar cheese on top and it was fantastic! Also enjoyed dipping nacho chips into it. Thanks!

The whole family really enjoyed it. I only placed one green chili in the soup so to not make it too spicy. This was a hearty soup packed with flavor.

AWESOME recipe!!!  The only things I changed were replacing the tablespoon of cumin with a tablespoon of adobo, using black beans instead of kidney, and using 2 fresh jalapenos instead of canned chiles.  Even my spouse who doesn't really like Tex Mex LOVED this recipe, it was soooo flavorful!!!  You are a domestic goddess Bette :)

Very good and easy to make too! Like others I used diced tomatoes and bought a whole cooked chicken from the deli and added chicken from that. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Very great recipe! Due to preference, I used pinto beans instead of kidney beans, a can of diced tomatoes+green chiles instead of a can of just the green chilis, didn't use the bell peppers, and I cooked a cup of rice and added it about 15 min before the soup was ready.

I just tried this recipe the other day for a Mexican Fiesta day some friends were having.  I loved it and so did everyone who tried it.  I doubled the recipe but not all the ingredients because I wasn't sure how spicy to make it for a crowd.  It was a hit...and it was super easy to prepare too!

I doubled all the ingredients except for the chicken, canned, chopped green chile peppers and the Cumin.  I erred on the side of spicy caution and the soup was devoured.  Anyone who knows they like spicy can double these ingredients for sure.

Very fast, easy and delicious.  I did make a few changes. 1) I sautéed the onion and green peppers along with two large cloves of garlic in about a tablespoon of oil first 2) I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used a can of diced tomatoes 3) I didn't have a can of chili peppers so I used a can of mild chili beans instead.  The end result was a delicious and satisfying soup for a very cold Midwestern day.

Loved the soup, added some carrots, used Turkey (less of it) and homemade broth I had in the freezer.  Good low cal option.  I was looking for a way to use left over red and green peppers from a veg. tray.

I'm new to cooking and this was the first soup I've ever made by myself, so I just followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! I had a couple of sceptics in the room but they all shut up when they had a mouth full of this awsome soup!

This was just ok. Even after I added garlic, chili powder, onion powder, extra broth, cheese...it was just really bland, even though I love all the ingredients and usually love tortilla soup, this just didn't taste as good.

My family loves this soup. I used fresh ingredients when I have the time to shop and chop. When I’m in a hurry it’s perfect for a crowd (usually young adults converging at my house) - I have purchased frozen vegetables already chopped etc...and no one knows the difference. I always use a rotisserie chicken in the ready made section. As far as spices go I follow the recipe and have extra available for folks to doctor it as the wish.

I thought the same for the canned goods, but I used mostly fresh except the beans & rinsed them. Came out delicious.  On the side I crisped up tortilla's cut them in slices on the side alone with taco cheese!  It was a huge hit!

So good! I used lo salt tomatoes and beans, and gave the beans and corn a good rinse to help with salt from being canned. I made it with only one cup of lo sodium chicken broth, and served it over brown rice instead of as s soup. I have trouble getting good chiles, so I substituted 1 tsp chile powder--for more heat you could use 2. I'm definitely making this again soon!

I am making this soup for the second time. I loved it so much the first time around- what a great use for leftover chicken! The only things I did differently was to use normal green peppers instead of green chili peppers, and added about a teaspoon of crushed red chili peppers. 

This is definitely going to be a staple in our house now!

This was a nice surprise!  I was craving loaded baked potato soup, but stumbled randomly upon this recipe and decided in might be more in line with my new year's resolutions :)  My only criticism is that it didn't have enough spice for my taste.  To remedy this, I added a generous sprinkling of cayenne pepper and a little salt at the end.  That did the trick.  Easy to make and nice presentation too.
