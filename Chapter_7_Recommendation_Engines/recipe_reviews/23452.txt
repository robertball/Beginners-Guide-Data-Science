Great sauce! Instead of adding the whole peeled tomatoes, I used a 14.5 oz. can of petite diced toamtoes and since I like thing a little thicker I added a 6 oz. can of tomato paste. I also added a couple splashes of wine, 1 tsp. of oregano, and 1 Tbsp. of brown sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes vs. white sugar. Other than those additions this was perfect over angel hair pasta!

The only thing that I did different was to use Italian Seasoning in place of the basil.  This just might be the best marinara sauce that I have ever eaten.  It taste better than most restaurant sauces.  It's not as thick as it could be though.  Which was fine for me because I was using it as a dipping sauce anyway.  It would be great for spaghetti (which is what it was made for).  But I wouldn't try using it as a pizza sauce or anything like that unless I were to thicken it up first.

I liked this sauce a lot.  I used it for manicotti.  I didn't put my garlic in until after I had cooked the onion a bit because I like to cook my onion a bit more and don't like burning my garlic.  I also held back the liquid from the whole tomatoes after seeing some people say the sauce was a little runny and saved it to add in later to adjust the thickness of the sauce.  I ended up leaving it out and had a nice thick sauce.  I also used the italian seasoning mix, some parsley and a bit of crushed chiles.

It sounds too simple to be any good, but it turned out great.  You can vary the amounts of onion and garlic as well in order to fine tune it to your taste.

This was exactly what I was looking for.  Easy sauce that tastes great!  I used fresh basil because I had some, and I did add some more spices, but I always do...

nearly perfect base red sauce.
i skip the sugar, use a lttle extra onion, garlic, and sometimes add some red wine or hot peppers. this sauce is a world beater when served with some freshly grated parm reggiano over al dente linguine!

great simple sauce, even better with meatballs. (even for an italian that NEVER puts onions in the sauce!) No changes. The church youth group made it as part of the italian night dinner team building event. It was a hit!

Very good sauce, I did add more basil than called for as otherwise it is a bit bland.  I used all fresh ingredients - fresh diced tomatoes and fresh basil along with sauteeing some mushrooms as well as I can not eat a pasta sauce without them! ;)  Great base to work from and you can do so much with it - thanks for the recipe!

On it's own, it didn't do much for me, but it's a fantastic base recipe. I halved the recipe (making enough for about a pound of pasta), using 1 28-oz can of petite diced tomatoes. I also cooked the onions for a bit before adding the garlic. Then, I added to the halved recipe: scant 1/4 cup good pinot noir, 1.5 teaspoons oregano, and 1/2 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes. (Caution: spicy!)

You really have to screw up to ruin this sauce. Fresh, authentic. Try it with fresh garden or organic tomatoes and basil. Destroys any sauce in the jar. If you need a video, just watch Clemenza make it on the Godfather:  "Heh, come over here, kid, learn something. You never know, you might have to cook for 20 guys someday. You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it; ya make sure it doesn't stick. You get it to a boil; you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs; heh…? And a little bit o' wine. An' a little bit o' sugar, and that's my trick."

Use a finely ground carrot instead of sugar to counteract the tomato acid.  That's way too much basil and should only be a half teaspoon, plus a teaspoon of oregano.  All ground peeled tomatoes makes for a better texture as well.  Try it.  (I'm of Italian heritage)  I put garlic,onion & carrot in food processor, then cook in a little oil before adding tomatoes & seasonings.

the sweetness that the onion gives is more than needed     eliminate the sugar     unless of course your planning on turning this into a dessert

I can't believe something this simple is so good!  I didn't have crushed tomatoes on hand, so I used one can of tomato sauce but didn't change anything else.  We all loved this with meatballs and pasta.

Fantastic sauce!  I substituted diced tomatoes for the whole tomatoes and italian seasoning for the basil.  I completely drained both types of tomatoes and cooked a little longer than 20 minutes just to thicken a little more.  Served over cheese ravioli.

Very simple to make - instead of two cans of tomatoes, I used a can of petite diced and three small tomatoes. After sautéing the onion and garlic and mixing the ingredients in the pan, I felt that the sauce was very chunky, so I blended it in the Magic Bullet. It worked like a charm and the sauce is delicious.

Love this sauce, what a great, simple base recipe that can be tweaked to personal taste!!  have made it several times.  i found i prefer diced tomatoes to the whole peeled and adding fresh chopped basil after taking off the heat.  just watched an episode of America's Test Kitchen-their recipe is nearly identical to this.  Thank you for a great, quick sauce-easy for busy weeknights!!

Pretty good stuff! Added a small amount of white wine and also added oregano. I also pureed the finished sauce since my family does not like any chunks of tomato.

I loved this.  I used 2 cans of crushed tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes since my dh likes a smother sauce and I would have had to blend it up anyway.  

Anyone who thinks this is bland or lacks flavor is probably not looking for a marinara sauce but rather a spaghetti sauce.

Great simple recipe, much better than stuff from a jar. Made two small tweeks, added brown sugar rather than white and added a splash of worcestershire sauce 5 mins from end. Great to make in bulk and freeze.

I made this over the weekend to go with calzones and it was great!  I didn't have any whole peeled tomatoes, but it was just two of us so I skipped it.  Great flavor, great consistency. Definitely a keeper.

This is a great marinara sauce, I could almost eat it by itself!  I used Italian seasoning instead of just the basil, and diced tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes. I served it over cheese ravioli, delicious!

Wow! This was really fantastic! This one earned a place in the recipe box for sure...will absolutely be making this again and again.

I made minor changes: used 2 (28 oz) cans of petite diced tomatoes, added 1 small can of tomato paste, used Italian seasoning (was out of basil), and used canola oil (only because I didn't have any olive oil). I also let this reduce down a bit because we like our sauce a bit on the thicker side...next time, I might drain the tomatoes. We also don't care for big chunks of tomatoes so I threw it in the blender.

I was looking for a marinara sauce to dip my mozarella cheesesticks (from this website) in this evening.  I have to say...this was amazing!!!  The only thing I did differently was chop the potatoes in the ninja before adding to pan and added about tablespoon of brown sugar as per another reviewer.  It was so good!!! There is much left over, so I will use it in the lasagna my husband and I are making tomorrow (also from this website...Bob's Awesome Lasagna).  Thank you so much for recipe.  Don't think we will be buying the jar or can anymore.

This was such an easy way to make my own marinara.  I made it thinking I'd have enough leftover to use on another night, but my husband loved it so much he ate it with a spoon after his pasta was gone!  He has asked me daily when I'm going to make this recipe again.  This is a fun recipe to play around with as well...I added whatever veggies I had left over in the fridge to the sautee and it was delicious.

The only thing I changed was the amout of oil used. I cut it down to 2 tblsp. I followed it to a "T" and i found it to be a bit sour for my taste. I put a bit more sugar. I should have added white wine as other members mentioned. It was okay. I will try to do it again but with a few changes.

This was excellent and so easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  I made it with spaghetti and I made the zucchini patty recipe from this site.  It was great with both.  The best part was that I had everything on hand.  I will be making this again!

Good basic marinara- I used less than half of the oil.  I also used 1 28 oz. can whole, no salt added tomatoes (be careful when squeezing those babies- juice squirts everywhere!) and one 14 oz. can of no-salt-added tomato sauce, and one 14 oz. can of Italian stewed tomatoes.  I let it simmer a little longer than specified.  Used it on Three Cheese Manicotti II from this site and it was a great match.

Good recipe, though needs a bit more seasoning.  I used two cans crushed tomatoes, added extra onion & garlic and used brown sugar rather than white sugar.  I wish I had read others reviews and would have added even more flavor, like oregano or fennel.  Good & easy recipe, though. Thanks Andrea!

I loved this marinara sauce and it's definitely a new staple of mine to use for pastas and for dippings. I added crushed red pepper flakes to make it spicy and it was excellent. Also, instead of crushed tomatoes I used diced. The kitchen smelt great!!

I made this in a crockpot, ( some additional vege's., bell pepper, mushrooms) etc.. However, I never use crushed tomatoes. I experienced bad taste from cans of crushed tomato. I googled the term one time and it was sugested that the tomatoes used In Crushed, are the worst of the lot!! Since I stopped using crushed, my marinara tastes a bunch better.  I use Nina whole peeled tomatoes from Costco

Yum! I used canned whole peeled pear tomatoes with basil and added additional fresh basil. I also used 4 shallots in place if the onion and served over hot organic buckwheat noodles- sans meat and cheese. Cheers!

I oven slow roasted tomatoes I had on hand that needed something down with them. I put olive oil, chopped garlic and a sprinkle of sugar to help them caramelize a little bit. I also used fresh basil and oregano. So I can't rate the recipe on how it is written, only how it turned out.

This was a great sauce. I'm sure there are better ones out there, but it impressed me quite a bit. I've used canned/jarred sauces for a long time, and I'm not sure I'd ever actually prepared a marinara recipe before this. I made this exactly as written (the step about breaking apart the whole tomatoes by hand was a new thing to me), except that my skillet was pretty full, and when covered it bubbled over a couple of times, so I left it uncovered for about the latter half of the cooking time. Oh, I polished off the last 2 cloves of an ordinary head of garlic, so for the other 2 cloves, I used an heirloom garlic for the first time ever - not that I could tell the difference in the finished sauce. I was surprised to realize that this sauce didn't use oregano at all, but I didn't wind up missing it. This lasted me for 4 or 5 meals, and it was just fine when reheated. This is worth recommending.

I followed the recipe exactly but found it a "missing something." I added in 1 and 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder and it tasted incredible. The only two things I would possibly change to use it as a spaghetti sauce would be a) keeping the liquid from the whole tomatos out, as Nadine mentioned above, and 2) adding in some meat. Otherwise, it is amazing. Thanks for sharing!

This is the best sauce, I've ever made.  I did use chunky style ground peeled tomatoes in place of whole peeled tomatoes.  I also used one large sweet onion instead of just half.  Everything else I did the same. So good!

Made this tonight and it was great on baked eggplant parmesan!  Instead of crushed tomatoes I used tomato sauce and added extra garlic.  Good stuff!

Fantastic sauce!  I added 1 more garlic clove, some garlic salt, and green peppers.  After cooking, I pureed in a blender to make the sauce smooth, and then simmered with turkey meatballs for about 30 minutes.  My guests LOVED the sauce!

Well, I ended up adding close to 2 cups of flour which produced a cake like fritter.  I wish I had followed the recipe more completly, but instead I added another egg and some shredded carrots. Everyone assured me it came out okay but they could have just been being nice! Great recipe, just follow it exactly(:

This is a great template for making tomato sauce.  I was drawn to this one because I don't have a food processor.  I also added a can of tomato paste, half cup of white wine, fresh basil leaves, oregano, lots of red pepper flakes, and I omitted the sugar.  My taster (my boyfriend) loved it!  I put it on some fusilli pasta with broccoli tonight, and since there is a lot leftover, I'll be using it tomorrow to make a big batch of baked ziti for a potluck.  Next time I may add mushrooms or red bell pepper to the sautee.

This was good. My bf actually enjoyed it much more than I did (but I am battling a head cold - all taste buds are dull!). Per Bellydancer's suggestion, I subbed Italian seasoning blend for basil and 2 (14.5) oz. cans of petite diced tomatoes for the whole tomatoes called for. I thought the juice from the diced tomatoes would make my sauce too watery, so I dumped them into a strainer, gave them a good shake (i.e. didn't drain REALLY well - no pressing with paper towel, etc.) and then added to the skillet with the crushed tomaotoes and everything else. Served over cheese raviolli (which my bf doesn't like - I can't please him all the time... lol!). This would make a good meatless sauce for lasagna or baked spaghetti. My bf actually suggested that I sub the rest of this sauce for the jarred kind my baked spaghetti recipe calls for. I'm making that for company this weekend, so maybe I will (if I have enough left-overs to yield the amount the recipe calls for...). Thanks for sharing!

The taste is good, but this sauce is too thin. Marinara sauce is a thinner sauce, but recipe leaves a pool of tomato-water at the bottom of your pasta dish. Next time, I'll drain the liquid from the can of whole tomatoes before hand crushing them. I'll also add a few tablespoons of paste. That should fix the problem.

This was a great recipe. Instead of the basil I used italian seasoning because I didn't have the basil. I also used a 1/2 Cup of red wine. The sauce was a bit thin so I added just a little cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. I served this with Fast and Friendly Meatballs (from this site) and angel hair pasta. I will definately make this again.

Easy to prepare. A little on the sweet side, so if you don't care for that cut down on sugar.
Eveyone in my family liked it. Was better the next day
