My kids loved this recipe Sara! I decided to replace the tomatos with salsa and baked the casserole for about thirty minutes. I then put the dish under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp and brown the cheese. Delicious!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I didn't have any chili sauce on hand, so I used a spicy salsa.  My husband isn't a big fan of mashed potatoes, but he loved this!

very good twist on potatoes! I used salsa instead of chile sauce b/c I needed to use it up, and I didn't mash the potatoes (I just chopped them up and mixed the other ingredients with them and baked it up).  I like the idea of a potato side dish with a tex-mex meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used salsa instead of tomatoes, and finely diced chipotle peppers in adobo instead of chili paste. I baked it for about 25 minutes. It was very good. Next time I will stir in a dollop or two of sour cream before baking to make it more creamy.

My fiance and I thought that these potatoes were good.  I used canned tomatoes with green chilies (for an extra kick).  However, next time I think that I will take the advice of another reviewer and bake it once it's assembled.

Maybe I did something wrong with this recipe but we did not like it at all. I took one bite and my boyfriend took one look at my face and wouldn't even try it. I don't know what went wrong because it seems like everyone else liked it. We sure didn't. Thanks for the recipe though.

Excellent!!  These ingredients are equally as good atop a baked potato as well.  Thanks you Sara!!
