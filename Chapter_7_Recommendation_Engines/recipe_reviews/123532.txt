I've made this recipe several times now & just love it. It's easy to improvise by adding different vegetables,rices, & salad dressings. It's especially good the next day for lunches.And it's oh so easy!!

This was VERY easy and VERY tasty! I am always a little leary of making something that has hardly any reviews! I came across this recipe while looking for recipes to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey, I threw in some dried cranberries for some different texture and the rice I used was a brown/red/wild mix that was leftover from dinner the other night - fabulous recipe for something thrown together and using the fat-free dressing makes it really friendly for the waist line! Thanks for submitting the recipe Ginny!

This is a versatile recipe which I really enjoyed. I used chicken, a mix of brown and wild rice, mushroom, tomato, pimento, a little dressing and a whole lot of spinach.   Thanks for sharing!

it was alright. A good way to use leftovers. I guess it depends what kind of rice you use. Mine became too mushy... I didnt really like it, I would give it 3 stars, but it could be my cooking...lol

Lovers of wild rice will probably rate this one a five. It was very tasty, and to save prep time, we got thick slices of turkey from the deli and diced it. Quick and easy!

LOVE this recipe! I couldn't tell (maybe I missed it somewhere) if this salad was supposed to be served hot or cold, so I improvised: Hot wild and brown rice, poured over cold smoked turkey, chunked baby portabellas, and a fresh red pepper, diced. Mixed all that with about 4 oz room-temp Newman's Own Olive Oil salad dressing. I then served it on a bed of baby spinach (completely forgot about tomatoes, don't like onions). My husband and I were both talking about it again the next day, it was so good! Definitely making again, and I would consider adding other veggies such as blanched asparagus.
