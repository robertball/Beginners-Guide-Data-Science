When I submitted this recipe step 6 was not included. I use only my dehydrater for drying and not the oven, this is why the time may be shorter.

I made this two weeks ago and it was ridiculously awesome! I added more pepper/spice because I like it hot and the results did not dissappoint. MY dehydrator, at 155 degrees only took 5 hours to dry them fully which seemed odd, but I haven't died yet. I am currently working on a second batch :)

We made this for Christmas as gifts for our diabetic relatives...and the rest of us jerky lover's too.  It was fabulous.  The leaner the beef the shorter the dehydrator time and the safer the finished product.  We used round steak, but found it still too fatty.  We will use top round or some other type of leaner beef next time.  However, the flavor was perfect..and no nitrites like store-bought jerky.  Much cheaper too!  We did not change anything in this recipe. Thanks Mike.

Very good but a bit too sweet for my taste. Will make again but alter the sugar quantity and really lay on the pepper next time.

This was my first time making jerky in my new dehydrator.  I chose this recipe over doc's with the video because so far you rated all 5 stars, so,  good place to start.  I used a4.5 lb London broil cut at 1/8 inch.  Only changed out of necessity,  used smoked paprika instead of liquid smoke b/c I was out,  and no coriander.

It only took 4 hours in my dehydrator.  Spice was perfect.  Hubby and boys were amazed.  I need to experiment some more but I will come back to this recipe for sure!   Thanks Mike.

Definitely a keeper recipe!  I didn't use the coriander as I didn't have any.  I'm not sure if that would have changed anything about the taste much.  We will be making this recipe often!  Thanks for sharing!

The dehydrator and the oven made the beef extremely dry. Plus, I over used the black pepper.  I have now seen Mikes addition about only using dehydrator for drying. Another than my mistakes for dehydrating and over use of black pepper, the recipe smelled awesome marinating. I won't make the same mistake next time.

no changes, will not do this one again just because it was too peppery for my liking.  Could try it with less pepper.

Hey Mike - I have used this recipe several times AS IS and we love it!  Some variations we have tried is adding more pepper and even a tablespoon of hot chili sauce for added kick.  Thanks for sharing.  I have some venison left from last fall that I want to cook to make room in the freezer and will be using it again shortly.  Thanks again.

Even if you like cilantro, beware of the coriander because you may get that soap taste. I was shocked and ruined my entire batch because it tastes like Dawn dish soap.

Great recipe.  I added a heck of a lot of cracked red pepper to spice it up.  We didn't have the Liquid Smoke.  Also, we didn't precook it in the oven - just placed it in our dehydrator at 155 degrees for about 7 hours.  Turned out amazing!

This is my go to jerky recipe. I've made it a dozen times or more, and it's great every time. The only change I made was to only use 2 pounds of beef, to get more of the flavor. I like a strong flavored jerky. Thanks for the recipe!
