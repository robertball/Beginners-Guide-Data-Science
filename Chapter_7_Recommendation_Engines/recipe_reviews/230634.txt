I didn't have the Sauté starter stuff but had chicken tenderloins, red potatoes and green beans. So I made it according to this recipe but I used about a 1/2 cup butter divided, and lots of fresh garlic minced, lemon pepper seasoning, poultry seasoning, thyme & salt. Also added a little chicken broth when cooking the potatoes and beans. Came out good.

Extremely good. The recipe  was quick and easy. Adding potato and beans to sauce was really delicious. Husband raved over the dinner. Will definitely make again.

I used chicken tenderloins in place of breasts. Roast the potatoes in two cubes of sautee starter and season and steam the beans separately.

We loved this i thought  it was delicious .I only changed a couple of things . I actually cooked this in my ninja 3 in 1 cooker .I used the med stove top setting to melt 2 and 1/2  saute express cubes  then i used thin sliced skinless boneless breasts  which i seasoned with garlic pepper then cooked them in my ninja .I did everything according to the recipe but i used 1 and 1/2 saute cubes for the rest of the cooking . I did slice the chicken then put it back in the ninja to just reheat it a little  and the chicken turned out very moist and tasty . I WOULD MAKE THIS AGAIN.

Loved it!  Using several garlic cloves, browned chicken first in cloves then added more cloves to potatoes with olive oil, parsley & 2 tsp of butter.  

Baked at 400, uncovered for about 30 minutes.

Fantastic. My daughter said it was the best chicken I have ever made. I followed the recipe except I used frozen string beans. I just ran them under cold water and then dried them on paper towels prior to putting them into the frying pan. I also seasoned with salt and pepper. I will be making this often!!

This was very good and easy to make. I did change a few things; I used regular russet potatoes instead of red potatoes (I havent went grocery shopping yet so this was an all veggies on deck type of dish lol) I also added green peppers, mushrooms and onions. I roasted the garlic by itself first and then added it once i added the potatoes. I also used a can of green beans (please don't judge, remember...all veggies on deck) Oh yea and I sliced the chicken breasts so the meat wouldnt take too long to brown. ANywho its so good and I cant wait for my hubby to come home and taste it :) #happycookin
