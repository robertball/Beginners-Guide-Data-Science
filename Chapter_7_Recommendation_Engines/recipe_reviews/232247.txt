Not outstanding, not extraordinary, but good and satisfying.  Flavor is good – I used fresh thyme (the equivalent in fresh is three times that of dried) and added some celery just because I generally do. I didn’t bother cooking the vegetables first just because I generally don’t.  There is minimal filler and I appreciated that.  I like the brown, crusty exterior on meatloaf so I shaped this as one loaf on a cookie sheet and baked it for 1-1/2 hours.  I did not use the brown sugar glaze as the sugar did not appeal to me so I served this with a simple brown mushroom gravy.  As this recipe’s first reviewer I’m happy to report that while there is much wiggle-room with this recipe to make it “your own,” this basic, old-fashioned meatloaf is good  just as it stands.

The brown sugar glaze is what takes this recipe from good and satisfying to outstanding and extraordinary! Please give it a try next time naples34102. Thank you for your review.

As a veteran meatloaf chef, this is a terrific recipe. I actually added more brown sugar to the sauce and added winch (Worcestershire) sauce plus sweet chili sauce. I never use loaf pans when I make meatloaf. Instead, I shape the meatloaf recipe on top of a foil lined jelly roll sheet. A 3 pound meatloaf with recipe ingredients approximates: 2" high x 5" wide x 10" long. Pour the sauce/glaze on top of this Bigfoot meatloaf, roll up the sides of the foil a bit to hold in the sauce and pop it into your oven. Thank you for this great recipe, Leigh Ann. We thoroughly enjoyed it here in Texas!!

I don't care what anyone says, this is an outstanding meatloaf!! The only things I did different was I used an equal amount of panko bread crumbs in place of the oatmeal and made a brown gravy instead of the ketchup based glaze. I'm just not a fan of ketchup. This was simply the best meatloaf I've ever made. I can finally stop looking for a recipe for this, I'm sticking with this. Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe! !!

I saw a recipe from Tennessee so I knew I had to try it. My Dad took our family to Tennessee and Kentucky from Wisconsin to visit relatives one summer and I remember the food there was amazing! Anyway, I was not disappointed and I do believe this is the best meatloaf I've ever had- even better than my mother's, which I love. I agree with Leigh Ann- not putting the top coating on is like painting the Mona Lisa without a smile. Thanks Leigh Ann- my wife and I are extremely impressed and I'm already making another batch. :)

i cut this recipe in half as i only had a little over 1# of ground beef.  this was very good.  different from what i would normally make.  i forgot to add the milk  (oops).  nice firm texture.  i really minced the heck out of the yellow bell pepper i had on hand so that my DS would not see it....i also roasted my vidalia onion a bit and also cut that up pretty finely. thanks for the post  Leigh Ann  :-)

I made this pretty much exactly how the recipe says, except I chose to sauté the onion and green pepper as opposed to microwaving them. My husband raved it was the best meatloaf he had ever had, so I will definitely be adding this recipe to the "keepers". Also, as many other people have mentioned, the glaze really seals it on this recipe. SO good.

I have tried many different meatloaf recipes and have kept only a couple but this one is a keeper. I had all the ingredients on hand so I had to try this. Very good, very flavorful and made quite a bit. I did shape it into a loaf on a cookie sheet and baked it which cut down the roasting time. It makes great sandwiches too. I usually don't care for oatmeal in my meatloaf but didn't notice it in this recipe. Very good. Thanks for an excellent recipe.

I usually throw together my mom's simple (read: boring) meatloaf but decided to search for something tasty. This recipe is just that! I used half ground chuck and half ground pork, and I came out perfect! Awesomeness!

I had to alter the recipe to ingredients on hand.  I had 1 1/2 lbs. of meat.  I ran out of milk and used 1/2 of the amount using coconut milk.  I used frozen onion and pepper and simmered then together before adding to the recipe.  It was a little more pepper and a little less onions.  I used a little more brown sugar in the glaze.  Cooking time was the same as in the recipe using Rachel Ray's meatloaf pan.  I was happy with how it turned out.

Awesome  meatloaf! The glaze is a must! I  added 1oz Jim Beam to the glaze, as a previous review recommended, and wow! Gonna use it for pork & chicken! I did add 1 envelope of beef onion soup to the meat mixture and used lamb because I had no veal and didn't want to go to the store. Also made a separate brown gravy but it really didn't need gravy! My family LOVED IT! They're eating leftovers as I'm typing this.

Very tasty.  Almost has an Asian flavor.  Made exactly as recipe directed.  I would double glaze, however. Just my personal preference.

Excellent flavor and texture. Do not forgo the glaze. It really makes the dish come alive and is not too sweet or high in sugar as some would assume. Had no peppers and only used ground beef and ground pork and still delish. Did not use a loaf pan as I’ve learned the benefits of simply forming a loaf with my hands on a foil lined cookie sheet-less messy and no dishes to soak. A good go-to for meatloaf.

This was a pretty good meatloaf, but I thought the taste was even better the next day.  I liked using rolled oats for the filler.   I had regular oats on hand, not quick cook, and those worked just fine.  I also thought that sweating the chopped onion and peppers in the microwave before incorporating them into the meat mixture was a great idea.   This seemed to mellow the taste of the veggies and contribute to a moister finished product overall.  This may not always be my first choice for meatloaf, but I' believe I'll use this method of precooking any veggie filler from now on.

11.12.16 ~ A very good tasting meatloaf.  I happened to have burger, pork and veal all in the freezer, and this was a great way to incorporate all three meats in to one dish.  We enjoyed the ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar mixture on the top of the meatloaf.  Served this with a baked potato and apple salad.  Definitely a dinner worth repeating.

This meatloaf was perfect. The only thing wrong was the cook time. It took about 20 minutes longer to cook. I will make it again & again, as meatloaf is one of my husband's favorite comfort foods.

Loved this meatloaf! Wonderful flavour. Used additional breadcrumbs in place of oatmeal (as another reviewer suggested). A new favourite in our house. 10/10 and thanks for a fantastic recipe.

Delicious.  I just used ground beef and it was great.   
I sautéed the peppers and onions instead of cooking them in the microwave. I recommend that because it adds more flavor.

Best Meatloaf I have ever made. Only two changes, used BBQ sauce instead of the glaze, and only beef and pork. First time using oats instead of bread crumbs. I think that helped a lot. Will be making this again.

I'm still new to cooking but this is the best meatloaf I have ever eaten.  I make maybe once a month for myself and it lasts almost a week.  The only thing I changed from the recepie is that I add a little more meat, otherwise I don't change a thing.

Wonderful - I just found my go to meatloaf recipe!  Followed it pretty darn close but read several reviews before trying it myself.  I am personally  not a fan of ketchup or bell peppers, so my substitution was half the amount of ketchup replaced with sweet chilli sauce and zucchini for the peppers.  I sautéed the onions and garlic until carmellized and threw in some sundried tomatoes, fresh thyme and parsley.  I followed the suggestion of a 9 x 13" pan and wouldn't you know it -  my husband had three huge helpings!  Thank you for this!

Tennessee Meatloaf Haiku: "Dang, this was so good. I've made alot of meatloafs, or is it 'meatloaves?'" I made this as direction, but didn't have the veal, so I slightly increased the ground beef. The texture and taste were spot-on, and while the glaze was pretty darn sweet, I ended up liking it only b/c oftentimes I drag my meatloaf bites thru a blob of ketchup on my plate anyways. Superdeedooper!

Did make one change; instead of using beef, pork and veal, I used ground turkey and ground pork. Moist and delish! I plan to definitely make it again.

I think this was very good! I'm sure the different meats add to the unique flavor, but I chose beef only. I also added some breadcrumbs, because I like a stiffer loaf. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe and think this turned out nicely. I do favor a barbeque style sauce on my meatloaf and definitely feel that omitting the sauce would be a mistake.

Made this 01/17/19 and loved it.  Followed the recipe fairly closely except used 1# ground beef & 1/2# pork sausage because that’s what was in the fridge.  After microwaving the onions, peppers & garlic, I added some diced mushrooms.  For the topping I used 1/4 cup yellow mustard in place of the vinegar.  Whatever meatloaf recipe I use I’ll use that topping.  It was very good.  The recipe, as amended, made enough for four 3 X 5” mini loaf pans.  That works out well since there are only two of us.  We had one for dinner and put three in the freezer for future dinners.

I finally talked my husband into trying my new found recipe from Allrecipes.  This is the very best meatloaf my husband and I have ever eaten.  He absolutely loved it, as well as I did.  The glaze gives it that extras sweet/sour type of taste, which really enhances the meatloaf.  It makes great meatloaf sandwiches for lunches as well.  Thank you for sharing the treasured family recipe.  This will be one of my favorite recipes to make in years to come.

Pretty simple and yes, the brown sugar glaze makes it a 5. I don’t like meatloaf recipes that try to be too fancy or include exotic ingredients. This was terrific.

Really liked the flavor and texture.  Loved that it made two loaves, cause the first one went fast!  Will make again today.  Easy and quick meals and sandwiches before the Holiday rush of turkey, pies, stuffing, and yam dishes.  Thanks!

My hubby and i both enjoyed this meatloaf, but we felt that the thyme was too much for us. It's a great basic recipe.. It's easy to make adjustments according to your tastes. And the glaze is what made it so special. Thanks for sharing such a delicious recipe.

I liked it a lot.  Good ingredients, and not loaded with filler.  I always put ketchup on top of a meatloaf, so this was a nice change for me, but still in the style I like.  I'm not a fan of mushrooms, so I was glad to see they were absent here.  You can always add one or two of your favorite ingredients here, if you want to customize.  A good recipe if you are compiling a book for newlyweds.  Not difficult, and good instructions, with a great result.  Thank you Leigh Ann.

Very tasty.  I made as written subbing more pork for veal (cuz I don't go there).  I omitted the glaze and made a mushroom gravy from the AR site.  The meatloaf was even better the next day in a sandwich.

This meatloaf recipe is a keeper. My husband and I thought this was the best loaf by far.   There is no need to look any  further.
When we want meat loaf for dinner this is the one we will make.
I did use  regular bread crumbs instead of oats ( the  measurements being the same) also being I had no Bourbon I used a small amount of Black Jack Daniels in the glaze and that turned out to be very tasty.

I certainly will make this again! I used a half pound more meat than called for so next time I will use the proper amount and I'm sure the blend of spices and ingredients will produce a perfect meatloaf!

Wonderful flavor.  Not too much spice but enough to give it a very savory taste.

My family enjoyed this very much! I will probably not add as many veggies because I put too many in, and my kids don’t like them so much. At the same time, it lasted three meals, including one meal of grilled meatloaf sandwiches- the glaze was a perfect touch. Thank you for sharing it!

I only made half the recipe quite easily and it turned out great! We like this meatloaf  because you didn't get a taste of a lot of "filler" like other meat loaves that use a lot of breadcrumbs or oats in them. Since I only made half the meatloaf I only made half the sauce, that should have stayed the same as we really enjoyed that nice touch. Leftovers were good too. I am keeping this recipe on hand.

This was a tasty version of meatloaf.  I used 1 pound of pork rather than 1/2 pork and 1/2 veal. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!  I would make it again.

My husband said it was better than the  meatloaf I usually make.  The only things I did different is I used 1.5 lbs ground beef and .5 lbs ground pork. I added a small bag of frozen mixed vegetables because I grew up with my mom adding it to her meatloaf.  And I don't feel like I need to make an extra side that way. Instead of chopping up peppers and adding them to the mix, I cut 4 green peppers in half and stuffed them with the meat mixture.  We love extra sauce, so I doubled the sauce and my husband said next time to triple it. I'll make it again.

This was good.  Would make it again. I didn't have any veal so used more pork.  Maybe this is why it was almost too moist (better than a dry brick!!)   Fell apart very easily.

Delicious and simple meatloaf.  Made it twice. Once in loaf pans and once in 13x9.  Prefer it in loaf pans actually.  Sauce really adds the flavor. Paired it with home made red bliss mashers and sautéed green beans. Thanks!

A perfect, and far, far cheaper alternative is to replace it with ground turkey. There is absolutely no taste difference in this recipe or similar mixed meat entrees...This is a pretty good meatloaf served with a baked sweet potato and corn...

Made as written and just thought it was ok.  I made one large loaf and it look nearly two hours to cook (not the 70 minutes stated), so I had a grumpy hungry toddler to deal with.

I made this recipe but changed up the glaze a little I added a little mustard and barbecue sauce, grape jelly and the spritz of lime and omitted the cider vinegar because I didn't have any. Was very tasty, I did not add the glaze initially but instead 30 minutes in added half of glaze to  coat and then again about 50 minutes in carefully drain the grease and athe other half of the  glazee other half of the glaze. Wonderful!

Turned out good, baked on cookie sheet so fat could escape, served with oven roasted tiny potatoes and Brussels sprouts.   Put the ketchup in the sauce on top and grated the white onion into it uncooked.

I don't know . I made it.  It came out very nice, but to me it was just missing something. It lacked flavor and just didn't live up to my expectations. Perhaps I was expecting a more southern type meal. I just found it bland and boring. I don't think I will making this again. I much preferred the Italian meatloaf I have made in the past.  The best part of this meal was seeing the left overs finished up and knowing I wouldn't have to eat it again. ..

This is exactly how I've been making my meatloaf for years  Never had a recipe -  came up with it on my own through trial and error!.  Sometimes, I add a package of dry vegetable soup mix.  It adds  a  little extra flavor and a few veggies!  I only use ketchup on the top and sides of the meatloaf.  My family loves it this way so I won't add the brown sugar and cider vinegar.

Try using your favorite Salsa to avoid adding a lot of the liquid ingredients. Plus it already has onions, peppers and much more.

Great recipe. I used it as inspiration for what my family likes. 
My adjustments:
Sauté onion and green pepper with garlic in small amount of butter. Cool before adding to mixture. We prefer our vegetables softer in meatballs, meatloaf, etc.
 
No oatmeal, subbed 1 cup plain panko bread crumbs. I would have used oatmeal but the cupboard was bare!

For the meat - 1.5 lbs 80/20 ground beef, .5 lbs ground pork

Fresh thyme leaves from the garden
Couple tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

I baked in two smaller loaves on a flat sheet pan (with edge!) covered with foil, lightly sprayed with Pam.
Brushed with the glaze before baking and then again ten minutes before done.

I used hamburger and ground pork, as that was what I had on hand. I also used a small processor for the onions , added fresh mushrooms, celery & carrots  &  yellow pepper. It was absolutely   wonderful! Very moist, too.  We especially liked the ketchup glaze. I think it was the cidar vinegar that made it soo good. Will be using this recipe for a long time!

I made some changes. Surely everyone messes a bit with meatloaf recipes if they've been making meatloaf for a few years. I used Panko crumbs and baked the meatloaf on a rack over some sliced potatoes, carrots and peas I'd dotted with a tsp of olive oil before placing the meatloaf in the over.

I followed the recipe but found the thyme to be a little strong.   Next time I make it I’ll cut the back significantly.  Other than that the texture and ingredients were great.

I loved it. The guys were so pleased with the flavor I will probably use this recipe from now on. I did use red onions because I had a very large one my son cut up for me for a pasta salad and it only needed about half.  I also used some red bell pepper.  Great recipe.

Made this meatloaf for my family yesterday for dinner and they ALL raved! It was AMAZING! The glaze was to die for! I have never been a big meatloaf person, but I am now HOOKED! At least on this one! I followed the recipe to a ‘T’ except I used Buffalo and Ground Sirloin instead of what the recipe called for. One pound each! Thank you!

Liked it, will make it again. I wrote my shopping list wrong and got Lamb instead of Veal. I used the green Cholula sauce instead of the red tabasco but it turned out fine. Wife loved it. Might be a good variation to use a BBQ sauce in place of ketchup, I've done that with other meatloaf recipes.

average meatloaf and glaze was too sweet for me. I like a more savory "gravy" on top. My meatloaf did not look anything like the picture as my glaze was more ketchup looking.

Made it as directed.  It's an average meatloaf with above average labor.
