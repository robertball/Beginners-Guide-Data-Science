Omg.  This is a scrumptious dessert.  It presents beautifully. It's lick the bowl crazy good. I have a peach tree with almost ripe peaches. I won't be dieting till they are all gone sometime in August.

This is now one of my favorite desserts to make! It's easy to make, very beautiful, and delicious. I've even cut up the peaches and put them on cheesecakes with the raspberry sauce on top - works well with a lot of things!

Absolutely delicious! Had plenty of syrup to add another peach to the pot.
