Loved this potato salad!! I did make a few adjustments. I used 3 lbs. of red skins cooked and cut into small chunks. Salted and peppered them. In another bowl....I made the dressing...1 c. no fat sour cream, 1 c. mayo, 3 scallions chopped, small handful fresh parsley-chopped,fresh chopped dill and the dijon mustard. Mixed and tossed with the potatoes. Chilled and served the next night with BBQ brisket. Family inhaled this! This was the first time I made potato salad without the traditional carrots, celery, etc. Will make again very soon!

Excellent potato salad! I made this for a BBQ and everyone loved it.  I used 3 lbs. of red skinned potatoes and because I wanted a little crunch I added 1/2 cup of finely chopped celery and 4 choppped green onions.  For the dressing I used 1 & 1/4 cups each of lite sour cream and lite mayo, 1 Tbsp. of dill weed, kept the rest of the ingredients the same and added a couple dashes of white wine vinegar.  I let it set overnight and the flavors blended together very nicely.  It was a great change from your regular potato/egg salads.

Absolutely easy and wonderful recipe.  I did not peel potatoes and it made the salad have a nice pop of color.  Rave reviews from all who tried it and I am going to make it one of my regular dishes.

My fiance and I really enjoyed this recipe, with a few alterations. I used ~10 small-med red potatoes, boiled w/skin and cubed while warm. Using tips from other reviewers, I made the dressing using  ~1/2 cup reduced fat mayo, a little more than 1/2 cup light sour cream, ~2-3 tbs red wine vinegar, 1.5 tsp dried dill, 1 tsp dried parsley, ~1/2 tsp sugar, 1 stick celery-minced, several dashes of cayenne, several dashes of garlic powder, salt & pepper to taste. It was a little dill heavy, but in a good way, as my fiance is very fond of dill. Also, the amounts I used are more like guidelines. I added a little more of this or that until I thought it tasted "right." And to make sure I had the right amount of dressing to potatoes, I added the dressing to ~3/4 of the potatoes I prepared and added more until the ratio looked about right. Mashed the rest, as to not waste. I would have added bacon bits, but we have a vegetarian in the house, so we added some to our individual servings. I will certainly be making this potato salad again.

I just made this, and am rating it while still warm. I gave it 4 stars for the recipe as written, but I would give it 5 with these changes. This was really good with 2 TBS of FRESH parsley. (I kept adding more). I think this made it, for I had to use dry dill (fresh would have been better). I substituted a couple TBS. of mayo. This does need an acidic ingredient, which I added in the form of citric acid in the homemade dill dip mix I added. Lemon juice could substitute, with some instant minced onion and dry garlic. HINT: Make the dressing taste like a good salty dill dip that you like, THEN mix in! You shouldn't be disappointed.

This is an excellent recipe!  My husband and I do not usually eat potato salad but we will now.  I used 1/2 reduced fat sour cream and added crumbled bacon and it turned out great.  I can't wait to get rave reviews at our family get togethers!

This was diffrent, but not too bad.  It got better the longer it sat in the fridge.  Good for a change, but I think I'll stick to another recipie.  It would go with fish really good because of all the dill.

This is good but needs a little something extra.  Maybe some grated romano and a little extra fresh ground pepper and salt just before serving.

I am so pleased to find a recipe that doesn't use mayo! This is excellent. I added a green onion and used fresh parsley. Also, I didn't peel the potatoes -- much of their nutrients are in, or just below, their skin. Thanks for a great potato salad.

I really like this potato salad and I never eat potato salad. I have never even made it before.  It had simple ingredients and that's why I thought, "I can do this!"  The only thing I did differently is, use Baby Dutch yellow potatoes and I did not peel them.  Yum, I love it and maybe I'll be the one to bring this side to the next family get together instead of Mom.  :o)

I took into account everyones elses feedback and played with the recipe a bit! It is pretty tastey and very easy. What I did was added 3/4 to 1 cup each of sour cream and mayo, 3 tsp of dill and 1 tsp of chopped green onion! Put your "sauce" in a seperate bowl and mix it to make sure it tastes the way you want and then add it to the potatoes

I was happy with how this turned out. Like everyone else in this thread, I fudged on some of the amounts, and added a bit extra salt and pepper. Since they don't sell fresh dill in small quantities (2 tsp.) I added probably twice that because I wanted to get my money's worth. I had these potatoes with some devilishly spicy ribs, and it was an excellent and soothing contrast.

The taste is ok, nothing to exciting, but healthy if you use fat-free sour cream.

Delicious! I didn't have any mustard so I just dressed it in sour cream. I am not really a potato salad fan but I wanted to try this recipe. I am now a fan of this particular potato salad.

I used majonaise instead of sour cream and used a lot more dill. It was good, but simple and not particularly flavorful. Next time I will add pickle relish and more dijon.

This recipe is quick, easy, and delicious!  The original recipe is extremley good, but it is also easy to add to.  I've added half of a package of ranch dip mix and bacon bits to it before and both came out great.

Thanks for such a great recipe!

this recipe was good, but not outstanding.  i used fat free sour cream, fresh parsley (along with a little dried) and chives.  i also added 1 3 oz bag of real bacon bits.  to spice it up, i added cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and lots of fresh ground pepper.  this was good, but nothing outstanding.  i am glad i got to use my fresh dill!

I really like this potato salad and make it for lots of summer cookouts.  The only thing I change is that I do 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 Hellman's Canola mayo.  This mayo has a tangy taste that I love and adds some zip without the greasy taste of regular mayo.  Another time i added some chopped sweet yellow onion and it was tasty.

Good stuff-added a little more dill and since we like a creamier tater salad, added in more sour cream.  Also sprinkled in some garlic salt.

This is an excellent recipe though I’ve varied the ingredients slightly.  I added one large sweet potato for a little extra colour and taste.  I also reduced the amount of sour cream and replaced with mayonnaise as well as added slightly more dill weed then suggested.
It’s a tasty dish!

I thought this recipe was ok.  There was no real zip to it...kinda bland like it needed more salt or onions added to the mix rather than just on top.  Will try again, but with a few additions.  I liked the fact that there was no mayo, just sour cream, which I used the light version.

this is a good starter recipe but I added some ingredients to inhanse the flavor or else it would have been very bland. i read the reviews for this recipe and made these changes: i used 9 cups of new potatoes. added 1/2 cup light mayo. about a 1/4 cup red wine vinegar. 1/2 of a medium sized red onion minced. 3 or 4 green onions chopped. some garlic salt a dash or two. 5 hard boiled eggs chopped. and some fresh parsley chopped about a lg palm full. i let it chill overnight and the next evening it was absolutely wonderful. if you like dill this is great although i did use a lil less dill than it called for. i would most definitely make this again and many times after that i'm sure. my new fav version i think.

This was so good! My husband and I are not big potato salad fans, but we both really enjoyed this! I used whole milk yogurt instead of sour cream and added a few tablespoons of real bacon bits. Wow, I don't know how people thought this was bland. Next time I will try a lower carb version with cauliflower instead of potato. Yum!

I would recommend this for those who do not like traditional potato salad. My kids love it. I will be making a larger batch so they can have it as a heartier snack.

Used fresh dill AND fresh parsley--best potato salad ever! Haven't tried low-fat sour cream (or yogurt), but I'm betting it would be good, too.

LOVED it! Like others, I made it pretty much as written, except with more dill, a little more mustard and some vinegar to pump up the flavor. YUM!

I used fat free sour cream to reduce calories and fat.  I liked this better than reg. potato salad with mayo.  It's a good sub. if you have vegetarians or folks who can't have eggs.  Use tofu sour cream to make it vegan.

This was delicious! I added a little more dijon as well as lemon juice and fresh green onions. I also like the flavor of dill A LOT, so I used a good portion of my homegrown dill, and will now have to wait until more grows back. lol.  Tasty and easy for a quick side dish!

This is a great recipe but to keep it from tasting bland I toss my warm drained potatoes with Italian Dressing and let it chill and marinate overnite and add the other ingredients and dressing before serving.  Instead of straight sour cream I use 1/2 cup of mayo mixed with 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Also I top mine with bottled real bacon bits and shredded cheddar cheese

I made this to go with my Neat Sloppy Joes...the only thing I did differently was add some finely chopped celery for the crunch, & just the fact that we are big celery fans. I also used sliced green onions (tops, too). It was really good with left-overs for more summer meals.

I don't know if I didn't add enough of the dijon mustard, but it wasn't tangy enough for my liking. Perhaps add some onion and celery and chopped up dill pickles to give it an added kick.

This was okay... we decided it would have been better with a little mayo mixed in, but we were out (how a southern girl runs out of mayo, I don't know!). 

I usually make a mayo based salad, which is much better, but we are trying to make more healthful choices. I used lowfat sour cream, and I did add a small handful of mozz cheese. We'll try it again with a spoonful of mayo added in.

This was super easy to make and delicious.  I followed what another reviewer said and used 1 c. mayo and 1 c. sour cream.  And also added some chopped scallions and celery.  Using unpeeled red potatoes made it perfect.

I am having a party and my neice is allergic to eggs so I was looking for a good potato salad recipe without mayo.  This is quite good.  I used fresh parsley instead of dried because it's in my garden!  I also added a tablespoon of white sugar which I think gave it the sweetness it was missing without mayo.  Quite tasty even though I'm a real mayo fan.

I love sour cream and dill, so I loved this potato salad, but did find it a little lacking in flavor.  I added some Hidden Valley Ranch dip mix to it and that really helped.Any extra seasonings add flavor to it.  I have also tried itialian seasonings and Mrs. Dash. It's a keeper- just experiment a little.  Thanks.

This recipe was not for us.  I served it over Mother's Day weekend, and no one really loved it.  My Step-Father added mayonaise to "choke it down".  Heh.  Majorly lacked flavor!

The dill was a nice though, maybe I will try omitting the sour cream, and subing in Mayo.

I used exotic-looking but normal-tasting blue potatoes for this. I thought it was good, but FAR too mustardy. I fixed that by adding a little sugar (maybe 1/2 teaspoon) to it.  I didn't have fresh dill, so I used 1 teaspoon of dried instead. This could easily be dressed up by adding eggs, celery, etc. that you find in more other recipes.

This is a very bland potatoe salad.  We had to doctor it quite a bit with some vinegar, sugar, celery, onion and eggs.  I would not recommend this.

This is by far the best potato salad I've made!  I also forgot the dijon, but it was great.  The dill compliments the red potatoes perfectly.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I forgot to add the mustard!  It was great without it, though, and I'm sure would only have been better with it.
