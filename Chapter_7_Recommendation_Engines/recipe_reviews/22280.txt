WOW!  This recipe is to die for!  I used canned whole tomatoes, and wild mushrooms instead of zucchini (cause we dont like zucchini).  The cinnamon gave it a really well rounded flavor.  I simply served with homemade wheat dinner rolls.  Will definately make again!

The 1st time I made it, I made it exactly as written.  Didn't like the addition of cinnamin.  The 2nd time I made it, I cut out the cinnamin and cut back the salt and it came out much better.

I made this for the family last night.  We sort of got into the rut of having to BBQ all pork chops...just didn't like it any other way.  And letting it cook in mushroom soup was to my husband simply out of the question.  I stumbled upon this recipe and thought I'd give it a whirl.
The flavor of the pork with the rub was excellent.  I used dried rosemary instead of fresh and added a bit of oil to make a paste.
The only thing I would change is to try to figure out a way to cook the veggies so that they didn't overcook.  I found that the last step of letting them simmer for 20 minutes really killed the texture of the veggies.  Perhaps if the wine and the spices were added when the veggies were and they were cooked until fork tender..it would be better.  Just a suggestion.  I will definitely try this again and see.

YUM!  My family loved this meal.  I subbed in a cup of white wine for the vegetable stock, which added a nice depth of flavor with the veggies and pork.

We had this for dinner tonight, and it was fabulous.  I browned the chops, sauteed the veggies and then put it all in the crock pot on high for 4 hours and it turned our really nicely. I added worcestershire sauce and more salt and pepper to spice it up a bit. Served it with pasta. Thanks for a recipe I'll use over and over.

This recipe was great!  Was making it on a chilly night and thought, at first, that it would be too light and summery.  But I used 1 1/2 lbs. of pork tenderloin cutlets in place of chops, and the vegetable stock, reserving 3 T.  Added a splash of white wine for some zing, and thickened the sauce with leftover stock and flour.  All served over rice.  What a great taste, and hearty meal.  Thanks!

I didn't care for the cinnamon/allspice combination of taste with the pork.

Okay, I changed this a bit, but it turned out to be delicious!  The only veggies I used were leeks, celery, carrots and tomatoes. I browned the pork chops first, then removed them and used the same skillet to begin cooking my veggies (except the tomatoes). After the veggies were about halfway done, I deglazed the pan (with the veggies in it) with some chicken broth and a bit of cider vinegar. Then I put the pork chops back in and added the tomatoes. I had to remove the pork chops again for a bit, just so I could reduce the liquid in the pan without overcooking the chops. The veggies + sauce thickened nicely. I can see that if you used zucchini you would want to add it towards the end; and i only used enough olive oil to brown the chops and saute the veggies. The rest wasn't necessary. I added a pinch of cinnamon and allspice, plus celery salt and dried savory. Turned out great!

I love this dish. It makes me look forward to eating vegetables, which is unusual for me. I had eggplant in the fridge so I cubed it and sauteed it with the other veggies. I didn't have cinnamon stick but I'm not sure I would like that in it anyway.

This recipe was ALMOST great.  The simmering killed the fresh vegetables, and I didn't like the addition of cinnamon.  I'll have to change the amount of liquid too-- too much.

Very good.  A nice change from the more traditional pork chop recipes.  I especially liked the fresh flavors, the cinammon and allspice added a nice accent but were not overwhelming.  I used yellow squash instead of zucchini because I had it on hand...very adaptable and simple but delicious recipe.  Worth trying!

This is an absolutely stunning recipe to serve for dinner guests on a summer evening on the veranda.  All my guests asked for seconds.

Like several other reviewers, I would have preferred this without the cinnamon and allspice. The cinnamon stick I used was very fresh, and the flavor was way too over-powering. The only change I made was to use canned diced tomatoes, and I used some of the juice for extra liquid. This was very easy and quick, but I would change a few things if I were to make it again.

This was such an unbelievably easy and filling meal.  My husband LOVED this recipe, and he normally doesn't touch zucchini with a 10-ft pole!  I just loved how healthy it was, and all the colors, and the pork chops were DELICIOUS!!!  However, next time I will omit the cinnamon and allspice, and add something different - the combination didn't work for me on the vegetables.  I read other reviews before trying it, and purposefully watched my vegetables in the skillet, not letting them blacken TOO much, so they were cooked perfectly after being simmered and not too mushy!  I served it with wild rice and french bread...ummmm good!

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  My husband liked it more than me.  I didn't like the combination of spices.

This recipe was really delicious and easy to make.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable and it tasted just fine.  However, next time, I'll probably use less olive oil because we thought it tasted too oily.

Great flavor!  I did end up subbing the wine & vinegar for the stock, and it turned out just fine.  Used onion (no leeks) and canned tomatoes, too, but I don't think that made a fundamental difference in taste.  The cinnamon and allspice really give the chops a that extra "something".  I prefer herbed rice and a nice green salad with this dish.  A loaf of breadmaker bread rounded out our meal nicely.  Even my preschool aged kids enjoyed this pork chop dish.  Good job!

Excellent TJEAN!  Family raved about it!  I used your ingredients almost to the T, adding fresh ground black pepper to the dry rub.  I used a large electric fry pan and browned the meat & removed, sauteed the veggies lightly & removed, deglazed with the vegetable stock (next time I'll use white wine) & stirred in one can of diced tomatoes.   Return the meat, pour the veggies on top, cover and simmer 20 minutes, while white rice was cooking.  Perfect one pan dinner!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Awesome! I love this recipe and have made it a couple of times now. I love that you can use so many vegetables. The pork chops come out so moist and flavorful, even reheating the next day!

This dish was not only easy to make but taste delicious!  We will be making it on a regular basis from now on.  I also like the fact that it is so versatile so you can use whatever veggies you happen to have on hand.

My family loved this.  I had pork chips that I was looking to prepare a different way than I usually do, and a zucchini from the garden so I searched for recipes with these ingredients and this one came up.  I omitted the leeks and allspice because I didn't have them.  I used chicken broth because I didn't have vegetable broth and dried herbs since I didn't have fresh.  I also omitted the cinnamon stick because I don't really like cinnamon in savory dishes.  Even with all the changes, it turned out fantastic.  My husband gave it a thumbs up and my kids inhaled it.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!
