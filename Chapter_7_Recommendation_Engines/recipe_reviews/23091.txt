My family loved these. We love pineapple so I used a 20 oz. can (drained) and it didn't overpower the sandwich. My family prefers mozzarella over provolone so that is what I used. I served these with french fries and a variety of sauces like mayo, bbq sauce, sweet hot mustard and horseradish. Chips and salads would be great with these also. The croissant really enhances the appearance of the sandwich and I would serve this to company without hesitation. Thank you for sharing this easy and tasty recipe.

Very good!  I added just a touch of spicy mustard to the sandwiches instead of mayo, and felt that the contrast of the spicy with the sweet of the pineapple was a perfect balance.  Simple yet different sandwich.

These were so good!...This is a great treat for asking mom over for brunch. I made them up like sandwiches, with lettuce & tomato.  The pineapple gave them that little extra taste. I served these with a creamy ranch pasta salad. It was a light & yummy little meal.

I have loved this yummy little recipe. I also like adding some honey mustard to dip them in, or to spread on the sandwiches. That may just be me, though. I love honey mustard sauce - but I thought it was an extra yummy add on to an already awesome little sandwich.

Didn't think I would like this because I don't normally like anything sweet with meat but these were excellent.  I used Philly style Hoagi Rolls instead of croissants and added deli mustard.  I sauted the pineapple and ham over medium heat until most of the pineapple juice had cooked off and then placed the pineapple and ham on the rolls.  Topped them with the provolone cheese and stuck them in the broiler until cheese melted.  Husband loved them!

I have a group of girls over for cross stitch on a Tuesday morning.  I am always looking for quick,appetizing food. This recipe went down a treat.One of the girls does not like eggs so this was an added advantage.  Thanks Kylie.

This was good and easy.  Added a little mustard and brown sugar to the ham and pineapple and served on whole wheat club rolls.  Will make again.

My family really liked this easy to make sandwich. I served the ham/pineapple on crescent roll squares, spread with mayo, and topped with provolone.  It tasted very good and will make again.

I thought it tasted even better after popping one in the toaster oven the next day.  My husband said it was a keeper.

Yummy, Easy, & quick. Made this last night and it was great. Reminded me of something my grandma would have made (everything had to be "doctored up")!
