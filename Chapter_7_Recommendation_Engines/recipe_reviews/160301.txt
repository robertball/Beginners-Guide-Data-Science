This recipe is amazing! We are HUGE venison fans, so needless to say, we have tried them all! This is by far the best venison I have ever eaten! My husband took it for lunch the next day and his coworkers devoured it! Follow thr recipe exactly and it's perfection!

i'm living in amsterdam (.nl), and the only venison i can get my hands on easily is either steak, or pre-diced stewing steak.  i used the latter.  i sliced the thicker pieces into thinner slices, but still needed a bit more than 90 mins before it was tender enough to eat. 'grill seasoning' also isn't something common here, so i made mine using 1 tbs fresh coarse ground black pepper, 1 tsp kosher salt, onion power, garlic power and ground coriander each, and 1/3 tsp crushed red pepper flakes. but!  it was absolutely delicious.  i served it with roasted potatoes, carrots, parsnips & shallots, and it went down a treat. the only reason i'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because i suspect that the reason the meat wasn't more tender is because i used meat from the freezer.  also, we're not big eaters, but there's no way 1 pound of venison would divide between 4 people.  3 at a push maybe. nice one, i'll be making it again. :)

I have made this recipe many times, and each time it is as good as the first time i made it. My husband is a big deer hunter so we always have fresh venison in the winter time, and we always have way too much than we can eat! The first time i made this, he couldn't get enough, he wanted me to make it everyday that week!!!

This turned out amazing considering I was given venison roast and had NO idea how to cook it. I've heard many say it can be tough so I was leery about cooking it. I followed recipe, with exception of making my own grill seasoning. Rave reviews from all who ate it. They were impressed this city girl did not ruin their venison. Many thanks for amazing recipe. It was soo good my friend who gave me the venison said I'm on his list of who get the meat anytime he goes hunting ;-)

Wow, we've been cooking venison for a few years.  This is a great recipe!!  I don't know what grill seasoning is, so i used salt and pepper with chilli.  I had no garlic powder either.  Otherwise I followed instructions as some of the reviews, I cooked it at a low temp in my wood stove for over two hours it was very tender and the gravy was delicious.

Yum!  Made it as written.  Used a Montreal steak seasoning mix.  Stirred in the chili powder then the minced garlic.  Put some on the bottom of a 9X9 pan, layered thin slices of venison and seasoning then poured on the broth.  The gravy was very thick, added some water.

O.K. let me just say I dont like venison, but we get it given to us. I have tried it many ways but this works! I made it in the crock pot, left it whole, and smothered it with sliced onion along with the rest of the ingredients listed. I checked it every hour with a meat thermometer, because I didnt know how long to cook it and it took it out at 130. It was fabulous! Please give it a try!

This was very good.  My picky husband had seconds and said that I should really save this recipe.  It was a bit dry but that might have been my fault.  I didn't slice it as thin as I should have.

I am giving this only two stars because it was very tough- and my husband just shot this deer so the meat is very fresh and hasn't been in the freezer longer than a couple weeks.  If I had put this in the oven for 4 hours at 150 degrees I believe it would have turned out really tender.  I had made this recipe exactly as stated.  The flavor is really really good.  Bake this in a dish with a lid on it or dutch oven for a much longer period of time and this could very well be a 5 star recipe.

We love venison, so my husband gets a little upset when I mess it up. This recipe was soooooo good! The gravy was different, but went great with the roast and potatoes. I'm definitly adding this to my recipe book. Thank you!

This was great! I'd only eaten venison in chili and hamburgers so I was looking for a good first recipe to try for a roast we were given, and this was perfect. It makes a wonderful, thick  gravy that also was delicious on the roasted potatoes I made as a side dish. I made the grill seasoning using the suggestion in rua's review, and it was great. I will be making this recipe again and also using it for beef. Thanks!

It was very easy and my family loved it. I would never have thought about this combination of seasonings. I was not keen on venison until tonight. 
This will be on the menu again!

Yum!  I did my own thing to make the gravy and cooked it a bit longer just because I had the time. I like the idea of slicing it first...it cooks faster and the outside doesn't get overdone. Thank you!

This is hands down the BEST pot roast and gravy I have ever put in my mouth. I pretty much have always cooked my roast this way but needed to improve on my gravy. Well, this is it! I will never make gravy and pot roast any other way. So good I came straight to allrecipes after dinner to rate it. Everyone in my family is stuffed; we couldn't get enough of it!

Just a repeat of what others have said that the gravy is very good. I did reduce the grill seasoning because I didn't have any that were specifically for steaks etc. Instead of baking, I put in the crock pot. I wasn't sure how long or on what setting to use so made a note for next time to do longer. I'm anxious to try the burger recipe I found now that I was given venison burger also.

Everyone enjoyed and had seconds. I did layer onions and garlic at the bottom, stacked thinly sliced venison and then added more onions, stacked venison again and poured the beef broth. It was tender.  Made my own grill seasoning and used smoked butter(yes you read right) in the roux. 

So good! 

Only one bad thing - No leftovers.

I used a 3 lb deer roast in the crock pot for 8 hours. Browned the roast in olive oil, McCormick's Montreal Steak seasoning, chili powder, garlic and one chopped onion. I didn't have beef broth so I just added 1 cup water. Threw in potatoes, carrots and celery. Topped with the gravy. This was delicious!!!

I used venison tenderloin and followed the recipe except for substituting olive oil for the butter.  The flavour was excellent; the meat was tender in 50 minutes and the gravy was perfect.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks, Ron!

Wow, very simple and lots of flavor. I used beef better than bullion for the broth and sliced some onion and placed on top before baking as another reviewer suggested. That is the only alteration... other than the meat. We have friends that hunt and usually give us a meal or two from the hunt. What I didn't know is that what I thawed wasn't deer, it was bear. The meat didn't have a label on it. It was small, it looked like venison. Had I known that, I wouldn't have tried it, it doesn't sound appealing. Anyway, I used this recipe and both my hubby and I really liked it. The meat was tender and cooked perfect. Since he knew what he had put in the freezer, he knew it wasn't deer and to my surprise, this recipe made the bear quite delicious. This recipe would be great with any red meat.

I used three garlic cloves and would use one or two next time.  Slicing the roast made it so yummy!  I will make this again!  My family loved it!  The gravy was delicious!

I was out of roasts, but used two venison round steaks for this recipe.  I cooked it in the crock pot on low all day while gone to work.  I then removed the steak and placed on a platter in the oven to keep warm while I made the gravy.  Now....this was our last piece of venison, and I was preparing the gravy while my husband was in the deer stand.  When he came out of the cold and plowed into this he had nothing to say until it was over.  I just had a few pieces of toasted bread to chase the gravy, but we thought this was the bomb.  I thought it was really good, and I am a venison vegan lol.  I am pretty much vegetarian except for venison.  I will make this again, but I will need to cut the grill seasoning back for us as it is way too much salt for our diet.  I might look for a Mrs. Dash version instead. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe turned out great! We used a "mix" of Cream of Mushroom soup and beef broth. I believe the primary reason this turned out so good was the venison was covered in a casserole dish, by the wet ingredients, covered with a lid, and cooked at a relatively low temp for a long while... This gave the venison time to cook slow and get tender. The flavor was outstanding. We'll be fixing this again soon!

This is a nice and simple recipe without going through too much effort to "hide" the gamey flavor.  It's always nice to treat people who claim they don't like venison to a moist, flavorful and healthy piece of "not-so-wild" tasting game.  I made no changes and felt that it was a good combination without too much effort.  
 As with any venison recipe, the prep starts in the field with proper processing. I never bring my deer to a locker plant and always age in refrigerator for a couple of days (in sealed container on waxed paper with paper towels under it to absorb the blood), then soak in a little salt water for at least 1/2 a day before starting any venison recipe.

My friend always gives me a bunch of venison from his harvest, and I had no clue what to do with this roast. I usually get tenderloin but I followed this recipe EXACTLY and it was so so so so so delicious. I impressed my non-venison-eating friends and they devoured the entire roast. Made with mashed potatoes and broccoli and it was perfect. Such an easy recipe and it turned out amazing- the gravy from the broth was delicious too!! Highly recommend to anyone, especially those hesitant to cook a roast. Thank you!

Serve over rice, pasta or potatoes! I threw fresh green beans out of the garden in the crock during the last 20 minutes of cooking. Amazing! Thanks for sharing!!

This is outstanding!  I am not the best cook, and my crock pot venison dishes don't seem to turn out well.  So I tried this and my family gobbled it down with rave reviews.  I made mashed potatoes on the side and poured the gravy over those too.  I will make it many times in the future.

I didn't have beef stock so I used veggie stock and added a little soy and worcestershire  sauce, other than that it was amazing as is. Even the kids ate it up.

This might have been tender if it was cooked at a much lower temp for a longer period of time, but the venison (butchered and frozen for one month) was tough. Unfortunately I timed the balance of the meal to finish when the meat should have been done. There was too much gravy. It was tasty, but much too thick, but that was easily adjusted with more of the cooking broth. (Basically, for a gravy/sauce a roux of 1 Tbls. fat of choice and 1 Tbls. flour will thicken nicely @1 cup of liquid...just multiply all ingredients by the number of cups of gravy/sauce desired. Adjust the amount of liquid to your desired thickness.)

Made it according to the directions. It was nice and tender and slicing the venison thin before cooking made it easy to serve. My kids all loved it! It's a keeper.

This was surprisingly delicious for how simple it is. It's excellent just as is, and can be improved upon with the addition of some hearty vegetables and or/beans. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

My first time making venison. I used a shoulder bone in roast. Had to cook longer but turned out GREAT!!!!! My son never had venison and he loved it, a picky eater ate every piece. Roast was big enough for 2 meals for just the two of us. Didn't put meat in gravy, but put gravy over mashed potatoes. Added green beans. All I could say is WOW!!! Brought in New Year right with something new. Fresh kill, soaked meat in salt water and vinegar for about an hour first. No gamey taste at all. Meat should still be med rare to rare when cut. A little blood is good. thanks for recipe. Definitely an instant favorite.

We eat a lot of wild game, venison included.  Always looking for new and interesting ways to prepare.  Many recipes are often too bland.  This recipe has a rich full flavor that my family labeled, "definitely a keeper".

If I could rate it higher I would. This was EXCELLENT! My husband had seconds, no wait thirds. I used an Apple wood rub which already had chili powder in it, I also cut up some potatoes and added them to the casserole . Hubby kept saying how good it was, He is very picky on who and how his venison is done, and decided I can cook the venison any time. He also told me to say it was plate licking good. Thanks so much for the recipe

Very good. Cooked in the form of a 1/2-2lb roast, med rare, pulled it out of oven when meat thermometer reached 140 degrees. Perfect with the gravy!
