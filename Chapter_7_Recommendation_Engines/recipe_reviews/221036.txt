I followed the recipe exact, only using reduced fat Hellman's mayonnaise as we don't use Miracle Whip. I also didn't have Tabasco, I used a good dash of Frank's Hot Sauce. We ate up every little bit of this. Honestly, this reminds me of my childhood. My Grandma used to make me bologna/ham spread regularly--it's total comfort food for me and now it is for my husband and kids. I served garlic dills on the side but next time, I think I'll throw them into the food processor with the ham and onion.

OK - so bear with me; as a child, I LOVED the Underwood Deviled Ham that came in a can.  When I found a bit of ham in the freezer today that I needed to use, I searched for a deviled ham recipe.  This is the one I used - didn't change a thing.  THIS IS A KEEPER! As tasty, to my adult palate, as the canned deviled ham was to me when I was a girl.

I am going to take liberty with my stars. I forgot the Worcestershire sauce, used a dejon  mustard in loo of yellow-dry, and took Sarah Jo's suggestion and ground the pickles with the ham  n onions. Ssooo yummy!! I did add green onion for some color. I accidentally ground it up a bit too much. The hot sauce will be added to the top! Thank you BL! Keeper and Perfect for the up coming entertainment season. A pretty bowl, great crackers and you've got a start to a Rockin party!!

Nice! I've always been on the fence about deviled ham; not exactly a fan, but not like I hate it either. This recipe may have converted me to "fan" status. I kept to the recipe, other than using low-fat mayo instead of Miracle Whip. The Worcestershire and mustard are a great combination with the ham. Not sure the paprika did much, perhaps I'll try using smoked paprika next time. I think a tad less honey would be more to my taste. When I made the sandwich I added a bit more hot sauce and topped with dill pickle and I loved the pickle with this.  This is a nice spread I'll be making anytime I have leftover ham.

Made exactly as directed.  Will definitely double the recipe next time, as this disappeared too quickly.

--I've made this several times now. It's a little different each time, depending on what's in the fridge, but It's a winner every time!

I made this today for lunch and it was delicious! I only changed it a little by adding a couple more Tbsp of regular mayo and adding a small amount of pickle relish.

This ham salad is delicious.  I made it exactly as written and will always make it when I'm making ham salad.  The ingredients give it some zip and my whole family loved it.

I just finished making this so  I'll add another comment later this week.  I love the canned deviled ham you buy at the store but always hated the layer of fat that was on the top when you opened the can. Used Hellman's mayonnaise  since we do not use Miracle Whip.  Omitted the honey because I baked my ham with cloves,  brown sugar with crushed pineapple so it was plenty sweet.  Other than that, I followed all the other ingredients.  Soo good.  Will never buy canned deviled ham again!  Thanks so much BL!  Next time I will add dill relish-yum!

I haven't had the canned ham spread, but this one is great. You can add ingredients to your taste. I even added Bleu cheese. It's a great snack on crackers.

I added a little more mayo, but otherwise loved it.  It packs a little heat, which I'm okay with.  Taking it to my next party.

First time I've ever had anything like this. Sometimes I want to ask my mom "Why didn't you ever make this for dinner when I was a kid?" Anyways, this stuff is delicious! I love it! Now I was very hungry and really wanting a ham sandwich so that may have something to do with it but for sure from now on, this is something I will do with a portion of the leftover ham. I used a half of a vidalia onion and next time I will only use a quarter. The raw onion flavor is very prominent. Also I added a big pickle. That just sounded too good! And it is!!! I can't wait to have these sandwiches for lunch tomorrow too!!!

Once again, the fantastic chefs and cooks on AR have literally saved MY bacon.
Guests were here for Christmas. VERY welcomed. Extended their stay through this weekend. UNplanned, but also very welcomed. We are in rural Texas. Nearest store is twenty minutes away. BL - thank you, this recipe let me use leftovers without a trip to the store. Everyone at the table looked so happy. NO ham slices of left overs.
They didnt even realize the sandwiches were leftover nor the soup heated from frozen. Just dont want to even think of not having the resources offered by AR. Thanks for making me look good and making the stay calm and happy for my wonderful relatives. We are off to the store now....

The only thing I changed was using a bit of smoked paprika and as another reviewer suggested, was using Dijon mustard instead of yellow and dry.
Super good, this is a keeper!

Update, 11/21/19: Hi folks, BL here. I was looking for a holiday recipe & ran across this & paused to read new reviews. I always get a thrill reading your comments; thank you to all who tried it & took the time to leave a review. You made my day! 
PLEASE NOTE: I found that my ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù submitted recipe is still in my saved box & noticed that the ‚Äúpublished‚Äú version omitted my note that *1/4 onion* was about *2 Tablespoons*!!!! Obviously 1/4 of a large onion would be MUCH MORE so I suggest using 2 T chopped onion, or to taste. If I could update the published version I would! Also ham can vary a great deal between salty & sweet, so please consider the type of ham if you try this & adjust the salt/honey/spice accordingly. I created this with a slightly sweet leftover spiral holiday ham (Sam‚Äôs) & it needed a pinch of salt. For a salty ham add an extra 1/2-1 tsp honey & omit the salt. 

I really was *trying* to copycat a certain ‚Äúdeviled honey ham spread‚Äù we used to take on camping trips & it seemed pretty close (actually I think it‚Äôs better). Texans tens to like like a bit of spice & zip so this recipe has both. Leave out the Tabasco and/or dry mustard for a milder version. We have only ever eaten this on sandwich bread with a thin coat of mayo & a thick layer of bread & butter pickles; that is one amazing sandwich! If I were making it for crackers I would definitely add pickles or even relish; pickles are a MUST imo. It works well with deli turkey or ham too, but leftover holid

Changed a few things- added 2 tablespoons of pickle relish. Would put a dill pickle spear in with the ham and onion next time. Also used 1/2 a small onion and added more hot sauce. Used mayo as that's what I had on hand. Very tasty.

This is the first time i have made a ham spread. I used brown mustard, green onions, black pepper and  cyanne pepper because It was what I had. I don't even like ham that much and this recipe was so great I ate two sandwiches with tomato and swiss cheese. I had to keep myself from eating it all. The cyanne really gave it a kick! I also used  Naturally Fresh Classic Ceaser Salad dressing and I think it  really added a nice flavor.

I followed the recipe as written, other than using Best Foods Mayonnaise as I hate Miracle Whip. If I make it again, I would reduce the onion by half (at least) as it simply reeked and tasted of raw onion. And adding salt to a ham spread is insane. I did it, as that's what the recipe said to do, but it turns out way too salty.

Just the right amount of spices and I used Dijon mustard and Hellman's mayo. Next time, I'll try it with greek yogurt instead of the mayo. Thank you

Made it as written, except used Kraft Mayo instead of salad dressing and added about a tsp sweet pickle relish and a tsp chopped dill pickle slices. The picture inspired me to use red onion instead of white onion, and I think it gave it a great flavor. My rather picky boys loved it, especially on crackers!  GREAT way to use baked ham that is too thickly sliced for sandwiches and those leftover pieces!

Very nice. Great way to use up leftover ham. I followed the recipe exactly except, I can't take heat too well, so I omitted the hot sauce. I served this on onion rolls. Family loved it. Next time, I will add a touch of dill pickles or sweet relish. This is a keeper. Thank you BL

I just made this today. We had leftover spiral ham, so I needed a way to use it up. This recipe fit the bill perfectly. I prepared it as written except used scallions instead of onions, full fat mayo instead of salad dressing, black instead of white pepper, and no mustard powder or salt as the ham was plenty salty. I added extra mayo and some sweet pickle juice as the mixture came out much too dry as written. The taste reminds me of the Underwood spread I ate when I couldn't get Grandma's homemade deviled ham spread. It is nowhere near as good as Grandma's, but then nothing could be that good. I am sure you know what I mean.

This is a very good starter recipe. I added extra salad dressing, worcestshire, prepared mustard and hot sauce to meet my families taste.

Great recipe BL. So yummy. I followed your recipe except substituted Hellmann Mayo for miracle whip, and I cut honey to one teaspoon as I prefer less sweetness. Great for leftover ham.

I was never a big fan of deviled ham but rather than throw away some ham that needed used, I ran across this recipe and gave it a try.  Followed it exactly and have to say it's delicious!  I liked it so much, I used the ingredients with some chicken I wanted to use up also.   It was just as good with the addition of a little more Miracle Whip.  Took me back to my childhood! Will definitely make both again.

This recipe turned out great. I actually didn't really follow the recipe. I added ingredients that I had at the time and it was very good. very easy to make. It is now on my must make recipe box when I have extra ham.

I made this to help use up leftover ham. The family liked this recipe. I went by the recipe as best I could except I didn't add any hot sauce and I had to use a substitute for the honey. I do think I will not add any salt the next time I make it as it is on the salty side but not enough for me to scrap. I tried this on triscuits first and didn't seem to like it, but when I tried on ritz crackers I liked it better. The next day I made a sandwich and liked it even more, so if you aren't sure about it at first try it on or in something else. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe is ok but there really are too many ingredients. The second time I made it, I added celery, deleted the honey and the mustard and would add a star to the rating with those changes.
