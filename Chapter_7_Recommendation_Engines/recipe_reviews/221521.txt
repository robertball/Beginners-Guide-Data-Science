This is one of my favorite ways to prepare potatoes. Serve them along side bulgogi marinated sirloin for a Korean steak and potato night.

Made as written and even though this did not turn out how I had envisioned, it was good. In my mind I thought these would be a big potato hunk with a thick browned crust about them. Not so much but they had good flavor!
