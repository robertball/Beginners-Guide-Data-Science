Something tells me I'm going to have trouble resisting making a piggy of myself on this one! Other than thinking the peanut butter filling could be a tad sweeter, this is dessert perfection on a plate, particularly if you're a  peanut butter/chocolate fan.  I used a Turtle Brownie mix and baked it in a 9" springform pan and  I liked the texture contrast from the nuts in this particular mix. The filling is beautiful - creamy, fluffy and delicious, but if I make this again I'll try increasing the powdered sugar by a quarter cup, to 3/4 cup, tho' I have no complaints about this just as is!  Rather than garnishing with the recommended chocolate shavings, I topped it with chopped peanut butter cups, then with a drizzle of the caramel that came included with the mix, and a drizzle of  hot fudge sauce.  What a great recipe - foolproof to prepare,  decadently delicious, and makes  a beautiful and impressive presentation.

This dessert ROCKS!!!  Peanut butter and chocolate heaven!  Not really a brownie, more like a decadent, impressive dessert.  I followed the recipe, using a 9-in. springform pan,  but instead of the chocolate shavings I used Naples34102 idea for the topping: chopped up peanut butter cups, and a drizzle of caramel and hot fudge sauces. If you want a dessert that's really easy and a real showstopper don't hesitate with this recipe!

This is heaven on a plate!  I used Jif's natural (creamy) peanut butter instead of the extra crunchy.  I also made my own crust using chocolate graham crackers instead of the brownie since I didn't have a mix on hand.  It was a hit!  So rich and decadent!  Thanks Jif!

I would give this 4.5 stars if I could! Very easy to make and very delicious. I recommend buying two 8oz containers of Cool Whip instead of one 12oz as I barely had enough for the specified usage. I used a 9 inch springform pan and thought the brownie bottom was a bit too thick in comparison to the peanut butter cream cheese layer. Next time I will not use all of the brownie mix. You can't go wrong with this recipe! Very addicting dessert!

Wow...this was divine!  A chocolate and peanut butter lover's dream!!  I used a chocolate chunk brownie mix as that's what I had on hand, used light Cool Whip, light cream cheese and used all natural crunchy peanut butter.  As I don't find natural peanut butter as sweet as the other, I did increase my sugar by a bit, maybe closer to 3/4 cup.  Drizzled the top with some caramel sauce and garnished with some mini semi-sweet chocolate chips!  So decadent and yummy, it was a huge hit and I will certainly make this one again!

My husband loved this! He didn't even care that there was cream cheese in it. Definitely a keeper! Only changes I made were I used an 8 oz. tub of Cool Whip since that's all I had and even though I kept out about 3/4 cup for decorating the top it was still plenty of 'fluff' in the peanut butter layer. Also, I used a 10 inch springform pan instead of 9. It turned out perfect, just the right thickness.

This was amazing.  My husband made it under my supervision for a party we were having and it was incredible.  Just a heads-up, the term brownie in the title denotes a square cut, but it's really round.  It may sound silly but when you're having a party and thinking, "finger foods for dessert, good brownies,  so i don't have to serve", just realize that you have to serve it in slices.  Or just weird shaped portions. Regardless, AMAZING.  so simple and such simple ingredients.  Too easy. If Kevin can make it flaw free, then anyone can.

I made this to take to our Easter gathering and it was a hit!  I used a 9 1/2” springform pan.  I used creamy peanut butter and increased the powdered sugar to 3/4 cup.  I made this a day ahead of time and refrigerated it.  I was able to get nice clean cuts by heating my chef’s knife under hot water and wiping it dry before each cut.  I didn’t spread the whipped topping on as the top layer, but instead added some on top of each piece after drizzling it with chocolate syrup and caramel.  Decadent, delicious and rich!

Next time (and it'll be very soon) I'll try a scratch brownie recipe; spray the springform GOOD; use a little more of the Extra Crunchy Peanut Butter, and only use the EXTRA creamy topping.  I used the regular Cool Whip, which was good, but the extra would had been better. I did drizzle fudge & carmel sauces along with chopped Reeces...my family loved it, thank you all for your suggestions, DELICIOUS!  Thank you!!

After letting it sit for a few hours it was okay, I was only going to give it four stars. Then I let it sit overnight, and yummy! Everyone in my house went absolutely crazy over it. I didn't have a springform pan at my dad's house, so I had to use a petite Corningware casserole dish, which worked out just fine. I also used creamy peanut butter, which I will do next time, as well (I will also double the whipped topping). Make sure to crush up some Reese's on top for a tasty addition! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Wow!  Delicious and rich!  I made this to take to a neighbor for dessert and it was well received by all the adults there!  Rich, fudgy, peanut buttery!  I was worried at first that the topping would be overpowering, because there is so much, but it was perfect.  It seemed like a creamy peanut butter pie with a brownie crust (though thicker than a crust!)  If you are a peanut butter and chocolte lover, this recipe is for you!

Made this sweet treat for my brownie loving b/f and it was a BIG hit.  The first time I made it I did not have the spring form pan, but the 9" regular round pan worked well I just pulled the brownie out and then carefully layered the top with the cream cheese mixture.  I was so proud of myself I took a picture.  It was easy to make and everyone will love it! Especially your brownie fans ;-)

Absolutely delicious!  Simple to make.  Only thing I did have to invest in was the springform pan, since I didn't have one.  Topped mine with mini chocolate chips.  Yum Yum Yum!

This didn't turn out well for us, the peanut butter layer just didn't taste all that good, I think it may have been the cream cheese.

A great, easy recipe. We loved this and I could hardly keep my husband out of the bowl while I was making it. I used creamy Jif as opposed to the crunchy and I topped it with mini chocolate chips. This is definitely a keeper in our house!

This recipe turned out amazing!!! I followed the recipe but used 18 ozs of whipped topping. I did top the pie with chopped up reeses. My boyfriends family loved it. Maybe next time I will double the peanut butter layer.... It was the best! Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for a family Christmas party and it was a hit.  I used Ghiradeli brownie mix- yum!  Be sure your cream cheese is at room temp before beating.  I added chopped reeses cups on top and drizzzled with hot fudge and caramel- beautiful.  I have a 10 in springform pan so I had to reduce cooking temp considerably- be sure not to overcook the brownies- they really make the dessert!

Yum, yum and yum!  I have no other words to desecribe how great this was!  It was so easy to make, but looked like you had taken forever.  I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy.  And, I only had an 8 oz container of whipped topping so I mixed it all into the cream cheese/peanut butter layer.  I topped it with some chocolate syrup and every piece was devoured!  Thanks!

Easy and a real crowd-pleaser!  I used a 9-inch cake pan, greased very well, and just ran a knife around the edges of the pan before inverting onto a serving plate - worked great!  Didn't have chocolate shavings or peanut butter cups for a garnish, so I just drizzled with some Hershey's chocolate syrup.  I ran a butter knife around the edges to keep them crisp.  Yum!

This truly is a peanut butter/chocolate lover's dream come true! I used creamy peanut butter, and for the topping i tried the new Cool Whip Dips in chocolate flavor....AMAZING!! I chopped frozen Reese's peanut butter cups on top too:) My husband and 4 year old son couldnt get enough of this delicious dessert!

I made it with homemade brownie and it was great together. Ppl gave me nice compliments ... lol 
I didn't add any whipped cream on the top, as thought it was not necessary to add more calories.

This was a great recipe. I took it to a Father's Day gathering at the Pool this weekend.  It went quickly which is great because otherwise it would have been a mess melting in the heat. Kids and Adults a like loved this.  Some said it was a little too rich but I thought it was great.

This is a 5 star recipe as written, but like most people I see a recipe as a start.  I used 10" springform, about 2/3 of the brownie batter added chopped dry roasted peanuts and choc chips. as soon as the brownie layer comes out of the oven, I top with chopped snickers. Made the peanut butter layer as is but left off the add'l layer of cool whip, drizzled with caramel and chocolate. everyone says it is the best dessert they have ever tasted! Thanks!!

My niece and I refer to this dessert "Paw-Paw Pie."  She is only 3 and was very delighted that she got to help make this for her grandfather.  I added additional sugar and peanut butter to the middle layer.  Also, I recommend that you use a large tub of whipped topping otherwise there will be very little left for the topping.

This dessert is DELISH!  It's also a snap to make! One bite and my whole family, in-laws included, were moaning in delight.  It is a very rich dessert, so have a big glass of ice water or cup of coffee handy.  This one is going in my personal favorites!

I did use two smaller tubs of whip topping and used chocolate shavings on top.  Yum!

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe.  It sounds super good and that's why I tried it, but I think it needs less cream cheese in the topping and more peanut butter.  It just wasn't the flavor I was looking for.

This was pretty darn good, pretty darn rich and pretty darn easy, so 5 stars for me!  I made this in a regular 8 in square cake pan and following baking times on box and had no issues with it fitting in the pan.

So rich and delicious. I made Mmm...brownies from Allrecipes as the brownie part, added an extra 1/4 cup powdered sugar to the peanut butter, used creamy peanut butter and then topped with homemade whipped cream rather than Cool Whip. I also added chopped Reese cups and drizzled caramel and hot fudge over the top of the cake. What an awesome dessert!

These were edible, but not that enjoyable. My husband wouldn't eat more than one piece, and he will eat anything! My kids thought they were good. The cream cheese gives it a sour taste rather than a cheesecake taste.

Sounds good but the multiple layer dessert ended up not quite hitting the mark for us.  Felt like the peanut butter layer was not sweet enough and cool whip kind of fell all over the place.

I added a graham cracker crust and a chocolate/vanilla pudding layer with whipped cream on top.
