I am the origional submitter of the recipe and yes 3 tablespoons of Old Bay is alot...but being from Maryland ..we love Old Bay and it's never enough for us! Of course it probably would be a little much for most people..so just adjust the amount to suit your taste. This is still the best cream of crab I have tasted. Enjoy!!

We are picky about our cream of crab and this recipe is a definite keeper. It's the first one that turned out great. I think the hollandaise and sherry are just the right amounts and give it a great flavor. This would have been 5 stars without changes, but I did add a bit of extra sherry and crabmeat. Those two changes are just personal preference. On top of being a terrific recipe, it was also quite easy to make. Not too many ingredients or steps to follow. I'd make this for dinner party.

Great idea - great soup. I tripled this recipe and supplemented about 1/3 of the lump crab with shrimp meat. I also added sauteed onions and celery, a little more sherry, and chopped parsley. There are a lot of great additions you could do with this soup - the base is awesome. The  half & half can easily be replaced with milk for a few less fat cals - it's still rich and creamy. The ONLY reason I'm not giving this recipe 5 stars is because of the out-of-control Old Bay called for. I used half and had more than enough. Great recipe anyway, thanks Karyn!

I've been cooking recipes from AllRecipes.com for years, however this is my first review because I felt soup this exceptional deserves to be praised.  I make a similar crab soup, but it always seemed to be lacking in flavor.  So the addition of the envelope of hollandaise sauce was brilliant.  I only made some minor adjustments - at the suggestion of other reviewers, I used a tad bit less Old Bay Seasoning.  I also doubled the amount of cooking sherry only because I really enjoy the flavor of sherry in seafood cream-based soups.  Since I was only cooking this for myself, I had some left over, and it was just as wonderful warmed in the microwave the following day, however, I added a small amount of milk to cut down on the thickness from being refrigerated.  Thank you for sharing such a delicious soup!

This soup is awesome! I made it for the first time on Christmas day. It's so rich and creamy. However, I do think that 3 tablespoons of old bay is way too much-very spicy! I am making it again tonight and am not adding any but will add it to my own bowl to suit my taste.

This was delicious and very easy to prepare.  I was going to give it 4 stars because 3 tablespoons of Old Bay is way to much.  Luckly I used only 2 Tablespoons and still I could have done with 1 and a half.  Perhaps there was a typo and it was supposed to be 3 teaspoons instead.  Also since it was already alot of salt, I used a splash of Merlot in place of the cooking sherry.  My kidz devoured it!  Being from Maryland we are always in search of the best Cream of Crab soup.  Now I know wear to find it--In my kitchen!

UPDATE:  I have made this tons of times since my earlier rating and found that you MUST you a GOOD Brand of Hollandaise Sauce Mix - KNORR's.   I have used other brands and it completel changed the taste and I did not like it as much.  --  Original Rating:  This is so WONDERFUL!! and THE BEST Crab Soup ever!!!  I used everything that it called for, including all the Old Bay; but I too am from Maryland and like spicy.  I froze some to see how it would turn out and it was just as good when I heated in the microwave.  I use to buy a really good famous resturant brand of frozen Cream of Crab Soup, now I will make this over and over; and freeze it and take to work on cold days.  Thanks, Karyn.  Its the best!!!

Awesome!!  We made this for my birthday and only put in half the Old Bay and it was so good that my husband and I decided that it would a birthday tradition.  I'm from Baltimore as well but felt that 3 T of Old Bay would've been too much.  This rates up there with Gibby's Cream of  (Baltimore restaurant that had the best Cream of Crab that I ever tasted)

My husband made this tonight and all I can say is WOW. I didn't want to stop eating it and I cant wait to finish it off at lunch tomorrow. He used half of the old bay and chopped up some shrimp to add in which made it even yummier. I will be making this again in the future and I will try adding some bay scallops as well as salad shrimp. If I could rate this 50 stars I would. Definitely a recipe to write home about!

Oh, Shucks! Well, I'll admit: I actually said the S-word (about 15 times) with every spoonful of a small cup of this delectable soup! I tweaked it by adding a mixture of dry and cream sherries. Try a cheap port as well. If you have a good, woody-sweet sipping wine, it'll work. I doubled the amount called in the recipe. My crab meat was four leftover Chesapeake Bay crabs from Annapolis, steamed with Old Bay. The original Old Bay seasoning is so salty and savory that you should *really* try low-sodium. Old Bay is so robust; this didn't need a pinch more of salt, there was a creamy-spicy-sherry goodness that friggin makes me happy that I have some more left. WOW. From a Marylander, With Pride.

Just made this and had to review it- it is unbelievably easy and delicious! I was looking for a chowder with potatoes and corn, and when I read the ingredients in this recipe, I was intriqued by the  use of  hollandaise sauce mix so I tried it. Used 2 tbsp of Old Bay after reading other reviews, and added 1 cup white sweet corn and 2 cups diced Yukon Gold potatoes. Didn't have any sherry- but next time I make this I will definitely use it! My picky BF loved it and so did I!! Thanks for the great recipe Karyn!

WOW!  This was a nice treat for this seafood loving single Mom who has no time to cook!  It is absolutely delicious!  I did change things up a little though:  I melted the butter, then added 2 minced shallots and a clove of minced garlic and cooked until soft.  After that, I added the hollondaise/flour to make a roux, before adding the half & half.  Other than that, I pretty much made it according to directions, other than only using 2 TBSP of Old Bay (GOOD CALL - 3 would have been too much, IMHO).  Plus, I added a little fresh chopped parsley and a little extra sherry.  YUMMY  YUMMY YUMMY!  I'll make this again and again!

THANK YOU!!  I am a fourth generation Marylander, who's grandfather was a waterman on the Chesapeake Bay.  I am hard to please when it comes to this type of food.  MY DINNER GUESTS WERE BLOWN AWAY BY HOW DELISH THIS SOUP WAS.  And I didn't change a thing.  It was served with individual warm crusty french rolls, and a large salad with my family's  home made ceasar/green godess type of dressing and WOW!.  This is my all time top of the list recipe from Allrecipes   very  very easy.

This was a great crab soup. It was very rich and super filling. I only used 1.5 tbs of old bay and it was plenty! Everyone in my house loved it, and it is a Christmas eve staple in our house.

Great recipe!  I love how easy it is.  I had been planning to make it for dinner last night but was running late at work, so my husband made it for us instead while I drove home. Even he thought it was easy. We did cut back the Old Bay to 1 TBSP based on the suggestions of other reviewers; however, I think more than that is needed.  We each sprinkled a little extra into our bowl.  We also added a dash of cayenne which we love!  We used one 7.5 oz can of crab instead of fresh crab since we live in Mississippi and we are on a budget.  I had leftovers for lunch the next day and it was even better!  Update:  I now add some worcesteshire sauce to give the soup a little more depth.  I think it helps!

Karyn, Karyn, Karyn...  First of all I had to remind myself that I DO NOT cuss, but I will say this was some very, Very, VERY good crab soup! I only used 2T of Old Bay.  I had the dry ingerdients in my pantry, the $16 crabmeat in my freezer & the whipping cream left over from a cake I baked over the weekend. The quart of half & half, sherry, hollandaise, & butter cost me $11.  DH & I just paid $12 per 10 oz bowl at Snyders in Catonsville last week.  This was better- I like spicy.  2nd, you ruined my  cream of crab experience for the rest of my life- who knew I was ordering bowls of cream mixed with half & half all these years. You could have just let me think it was a cup of cream & stock mixed with thickening. . 3rd, I had to take a look at your profile pic when I tasted this, how on God's green earth do you maintain your weight with cooking like this?!! 
Though you ruined me, thanks for this great dinner party recipe, Hon..

The rating is a compromise - DH gave it a 4 1/2 stars and I gave it a 3 1/2 so it gets 4.  We enjoyed it but I think I added a bit too much sherry.  That said, I started out with 1 1/2 T. of Old Bay and ended adding about another 1 T.  Will definitely make this again.  Love the hollandaise sauce addition - I think that really made a big difference.
Thanks Karyn - this was very good!

I made this twice in two weeks. I made it once with potatoes instead of crab. Forget chocolate, and ice cream, and cheesecake. This is my newest addiction.

This was excellent!  I only added a 1/2 TBSP of Old Bay and that was plenty.  Next time we are going to try it to make a creamy onion soup...omitting the crab and old bay!!

So delicious, surprisingly quick and easy, and a big hit with the family. Substituted 1c. skim for one of the cups of half n half and 1/2 cup skim for 1/2 cup of whipping cream. Followed suggestion to halve Old Bay and added more sherry. Had only 8oz of backfin crab and it was all still delicious! Next time we'll spring for the whole pound of crab if we can. Thank you, Karyn, can't wait to try some of your other recipes-I see they're well loved!

Pretty good but over the top rich. The 3 tablespoons Old Bay Seasoning made this excessively salty for our tastes, and half that amount or a bit less would have been more suitable . . . Karyn made me chuckle when cheering us on in the description to use more Old Bay. This just didn’t wow us for something so rich and high in calories. If we were to make this again, sautéed onion and celery or frozen white corn would be added even though this is not traditional by Maryland standards. Karyn821, thank you for sharing.

Wow...expected this to be good but it was wonderful!  It took some other reviewers advice and added some celery and onion, also used 3 cups half and half and 2 cups milk for calorie's sake. It was still very rich. Don't go to all this trouble and skimp on canned crab. Get the fresh crab in the tubs in the seafood department.

This soup is better than restaurant recipes!!! I live in Baltimore, MD, and this is a great recipe. I put 2 tablespoons of Old Bay seasoning, but we add more per serving to our taste. Yummy!!! I am not a great cook, and this came out lovely.

I've made crab soup for years, because its so time consuming it was a special occassion staple. Well not anymore thanks to Karyn. This recipe takes an hour off my old recipe and taste the exact same, DELICIOUS!!! I've shared this recipe with all my friends. I agree to reduce the amount of old bay by half, but otherwise this is a great recipe.

I used half the old bay seasoning and added some shrimp and it turned out wonderfully.  Serve with some crusty bread for dipping.

OMG! Sooo Yummy & Comforting & Easy! I wanted to try something new and this soup was not a let down, you will not be disappointed! 3 out of my 4 kids gave this a thumbs up. I replaced the half-n-half with 2% milk and it was still super rich & creamy. I also cut back on the Old Bay (1tbs) and added 3/4 cup baby shrimp. Great with slices of toasted, buttered, tuscan bread.  I think the addition of sauted onions in the "melting butter" step would be nice. Thank you Karyn!!!

Way too much Old Bay!  The soup may have been good otherwise but the salt from the Old Bay overpowered the taste of the soup. I may try this again but with only a fraction of the Old Bay.

I tripled this for an office Christmas party today. If I didn't know any better, I would've thought Paul Revere rode through the office  proclaiming its arrival! The entire pot was gone in about 8 minutes flat. I received the following feedback: OMG!, I'm in heaven, restaurant quality, best cream of crab I have ever had, life changing, epic, etc. This recipe couldn't have been easier. I followed the recipe to a 'T' with two small changes. I used real sherry (a lil extra) and I sauteed a small onion, 2 celery stalks and a clove of garlic that had been finely minced in the food processor in the butter before adding the slurry.  Being a Baltimore native,  I thought the amount of  Old Bay was perfect! This soup is a crowd pleaser! Everyone will think you slaved over the stove and fussed over ingredients to make this delicious pot of soup!

I have made Karyns cream of crab for a couple of years now!  I make it at Christmas time and am having it today for a Christmas party.  Like Karyn, I too am from Md. and we love our Old Bay!!  However, this is the most fabulous cream of crab that I have ever had, so much so that I do not enjoy cream of crab from any restaurant because it cannot match this!  Best recipe ever and that secret ingredient is the hollandaise sauce!  take your time with it, simmer long and slow and that old bay will blend right in!  Thanks Karyn!

I am from Maryland originally and this is how we do it!  Dont be intimidated by the Old Bay the flavor gets mellowed out in all the cream. If you are worried about salt, Old Bay now comes in a "less" salt option as well. Thanks for this little taste of home.

This recipe made me look like a superstar with my family, friends and my boss. 2 people told me they licked the bowl clean. 3 people told me it was better than any restaraunt they had been to. They were all people with mature and refined palates. People who all reside in MD. And you know how picky Maryland people are about their crab. They kept on coming up to me talking about how good it was and how they wish I could have given them more. THIS IS A WINNER. I did add more sherry and the listed spices and only one tbs of old bay and added just regular table salt. So good and rich!!! This recipe is heaven sent and so easy. A keeper in deed.

My office devoured my leftovers!  A smidge too salty for me so I would probably add Old Bay to taste instead of 3 full tbs.

YUM!  So rich, though - can't have this too often!  I added corn, and cut way back on the Old Bay, using less than 2 tbsp.  My youngest still thought it was "too spicy", while my oldest thought I could've upped the Old Bay... can't please everyone!  I also added more sherry.  Wonderful, and VERY filling, with just crusty bread to dip.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  I had never made cream of crab before and found this recipe.  It was so easy and so delicious - an instant hit with everyone who tasted it!! Being from prime blue crab area in MD, we are very tough customers.  A TIP for those using already seasoned crabs from a crabfeast - You MAY NOT need all the old bay that is called for in the recipe.  Remember that some of the spices from cooking are already in the meat!  My first batch was extremely spicey - but still good since we like it that way!  ENJOY!!

I have never left a review before this one! I loved this recipe. I read the other reviews first and didn't add all of the Old Bay at first, I slowly added more. I ended up using all 3 T it called for and I even added more to my bowl! It tastes great the next day too! Thank you soo much for this recipe Karyn!!!

I followed the directions except for only using half the amount of Old Bay and tripling the sherry. Even using half the amount of Old Bay was still just a tad too much (and this is coming from a born and bred Marylander x 30+ years). Otherwise, we really enjoyed this! Very very easy and quick. Thanks for a fabulous recipe Karyn!

This recipe is excellent.  I have made it two times now.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  The second time I decided to experiment and added diced onions, potatoes, corn & red bell pepper.  I also added a dash of nutmeg and additional sherry.  The second batch was also great.  You can add anything you like as long as you stick with the awesome base.

Let me start by saying that I am not a soup person at all and I loved this! It was rich and creamy and it was ready in no time! The only changes I made were because of personal preference. I sauteed onion, I included some claw meat for additional flavor and used jumbo lump which I spooned on top instead of adding it to the soup for fear of breaking up the lumps and I used half of the old bay that the recipe stated. I will make this again!

this was excellent; Karyn this recipe is wonderful, I absolutely love Cream of Crab and eat it out at restaurants but have never come across a recipe that even sounded like what I would like until this one. My family loves it also. Only change I made(its a secret :)) added a dash of nutmeg, delicious) Thanks for the many years of good eating :) this recipe is the bomb, as my son would say :) thanks for sharing!!

Brilliant!  I've been searching for this recipe for years.  Absolutely perfect as is.  (and please, if you're sensitive to spices, you should know better than to add all that Old Bay.  if I told you a bottle of tabasco or a cup of salt were necessary, would you add that to a recipe?  Taste people, taste!)

Very good soup. Be advised! Old Bay is almost a codeword for salt in this recipe. No disrespect. Unles you`re from Maryland you might want to cut it back signifigantly. Otherwise very tasty.

I loved the recipe.  Very easy.  The hollaindaise sauce mix gives it a nice creamy texture.  I am from Baltimore and we do love our Old Bay, but I cut back and only used 1 tablespoon.  I also added fresh parsley.
Perfect!!!!

Have made this soup many times as it has become a family favorite. Full of flavor and filling. Very easy to make. I actually use more Old Bay than the recipe calls for as we enjoy spicy foods.

Absolutely perfect recipe ! Ive personally made it numerous times exactly as written and we just adore it ! With that being said My families roots are Cajun and Creole.  My husband is from Maryland so he loves crab soup . I've made it just as indicated numerous times we all adore it One night I Had decided to Creole or Cajun it up a little bit ,so I tweaked it slightly , First , I doubled the entire recipe then I added 1 lb of crawfish tails along with 1.5 lb of fresh jumbo lump crab (Save the other 1/2 lb for garnish) Also I caramelized 1 Sweet yellow onion in 4 tablespoons real unsalted butter which equals  out to about 1 cup of caramelized onions and added those , as well as sauteed 1 cup of  celery and 1 bell pepper green or yellow make sure to dice very small Also added 3 cloves of minced garlic sauteed with celery and bell pepper and onion( I just love the color it adds) until soft to the touch not mushy tho very easy to overcook so watch carefully and added those I also added 1 cup of real bacon crumbles and 2 tablespoons of liquid smoke , I also added 1 tablespoon of smoked paprika, and also only use the low sodium old bay and 1 teaspoon of Cayenne pepper and a dash of nutmeg and I doubled the Sherry try to use a good Sherry as well as place the Sherry on the table so guest may add more .I served it this way for a large private dinner and it was an enormous hit ! Don't forget to add the reserved jumbo lump crab meat place on top of soup in bowls in the middle makes a

I'm from MD and only use fresh Maryland jumbo lump crab meat when making crab cakes or crab soup.  Since this was my first time trying this recipe, I decided to use a less expensive crab meat so that if I didn't like the recipe, I wouldn't have wasted a lot of money.  Even with canned, pasteurized crab meat, this recipe was great.  I didn't have any dry mustard or celery seed on hand so I didn't add it.  I only added the Old Bay to taste, definitely less than 3 tablespoons but probably close to 2.  I was really nervous about the hollandaise sauce mix, but followed the advice of another reviewer and used Knorr's and it gave it a really nice depth of flavor.  Can't wait to try this again using good quality crab meat!  Thanks for this great recipe.

AMAZING!!! I was born and raised in southern Maryland and this is the best cream of crab soup I’ve ever had. My husband is obsessed (kids are still too young)!  The only thing I changed was the amount of Old Bay after reading reviews. I used less than half the called for amount. Sooo impressed!!

Excellent, all of my guests absolutely loved it and 2 asked for the recipe.  I have made this twice and I think the following changes are the best (this is for a DOUBLED recipe):
1. Minced 2 small shallots and 2 ribs of celery and gently sautéd them in the butter until they were soft.  2. Left out the flour and it was plenty thick.  3. Lowered Old Bay to 4 TBS.  4. Upped sherry to 1/4 c.  5. Added fresh ground pepper at the end.

I live in Maryland and grew up in Baltimore so maybe I feel like I have a pretty decent idea of what a good cup of cream of crab should taste like. it may be crazy to believe that it's hard to find good crab soup...even here in MD. This recipe however is close to the best soup I've ever had and after analyzing it for some time, I believe the game changer is the hollandaise sauce. I've tried my hand at it many times and it always tastes like dense, hot cream. Karyn, this recipe is allstar! Thank you so much for sharing with the rest of us!

Husband loved this! Only 2 things changed. Used 1 TB old bay (he is from Annapolis and loves old bay and still thought this was plenty) and 2. He added a 12 oz package of craw dads and some fish he caught. It was still very soupy. Oh, and The envelope sauce mix comes in .9 oz not 1.25. It is very rich and he said it was a nice side as a small cup of soup. Too rich for a main course of soup.

This is the best crabsoup except that there must be a mistake in the amount of Old Bay if you use what the recipe calls for you can't eat it. Start with 1 Teaspoon and add more as needed for your taste.

THIS RECIPE is a true recipe to how Cream of Crab soup is to be. It matches most restaurants and the creaminess is divine.  I made some additions (finely chopped celery and carrot and a little cayenne pepper), one switch (I use LOW SODIUM Old Bay), and sherry is definitely to taste. I don't see a reasoning for changing the fat content unless for health reasons, but if the sodium content is an issue, the low sodium Old Bay works like a dream or make your own seafood or creole seasoning without salt and add salt separately.

This is one of my absolute favorite recipes!  I use 2 Tbsp Old bay, 1 1/2 Tbsp cooking sherry, and only a pinch of celery seed.  Lump crabmeat is a must.  I made this for a party at work and everyone loved it!

Amazing soup recipe! Easy to make and completely delicious. I added 1 cup of low fat milk to thin it down a bit and think next time I may use more milk and less half and half to cut some calories/fat, but it is delicious just the way it is. I also used a little bit of red wine instead of cooking sherry since I had no sherry. I also followed the advice of other reviewers and added only half the Old Bay that the recipe called for and it was DEFINITELY spicy enough.  This will be a regular winter weather favorite for us! Thanks Karyn!

Cream of crab soup is one thing I miss about being in Maryland.  This soup tastes just like the soup from my favorite restaurant, the Sunset in Glen Burnie, MD. My Maryland native husband loves it and is asking for me to make it again. I used the low salt Old Bay and 3 Tbs was perfect.  Thank you!

I added a little more dry mustard, a little more sherry and a tad of salt. I had to reduce the Old Bay because some people didn't like things too spicy, but we added more at the table. This was a hit for Christmas and we will be having it for New Year's Eve. Thank you!

AMAZING!!!  Being from Maryland, I've tried many other cream of crab soups, and this is the best!  I like my soup a little spicier, so I increase the amount of Old Bay added, but otherwise I follow Karyn's recipe exactly.  Thanks so much for sharing, Karyn!

Delicious, very rich.  I reheated the following day with quite a bit of extra milk.  I love the old bay seasoning and sherry, but the old bay does make it a bit salty.  A keeper for when I can't make it to MD.

Very delicious soup!  I had a bunch of extra crab legs left over from a dinner and decided to use the crab for soup.  Awesome!  I did scale back the old bay a tad and it was wonderful!  Will def do it again and maybe even add some potatoes to it.

this recipe is fantastic ! I have made it no less than 10 times so I decided to join the site and give it a review. I've tweaked a few things from time to time just to see what would happen. I always double the recipe,, I have used only milk -- still great,, I have used a combination of hollandaise and bernaise sauces -- Very good idea,, and I've used a combination of Lump crab with the shredded fake crab -- great,, and a combination Real crab leg meat and Lump crab -- the Best !! So to sum up this review ----> Thank you Karyn, this recipe AS You Wrote It -- is PERFECT.

We had this soup on christmas eve and it was wonderful!  We only did 1.5 tbs of Old Bay and with no sherry around, it still tasted wonderful! Definitely a hit!  Reccomend only adding the fress crab when you serve it so its fresh everytime.  Store crab and soup separetly for left overs! ENJOY Thank you Karen :)

I tried this soup today and boy was it good! I changed a few things...while the butter was melting I threw in some minced shallots, I omitted the celerly seed. I thought I had dry mustard but it turns out that I didn't so I put in one tablespoon of dijon mustard and that worked quite well!! I also stirred in some chopped flat leaf parsley right before serving! This was the best at home version that i've ever had!  Oh and being a true Maryland girl I thought the 3 Tbs of Old Bay was perfect...I even added more in my own bowl...I love this recipe it's one of my favs!! Thanks

I had this soup at a friends house the other day and it was AWESOME. We are also from Maryland and you are right about the Old Bay....that's just how we like it! I suppose it can be modified to suit personal taste. My friend added celery and onions which I liked as well. I've been thinking about this soup so much I am going to make it for my husband tonight. Thanks!

This was amazing.....everyone loved it! Made exactly as recipe called for, only doubled it. This will be my only recipe for crab soup from now on. Would love to TRY using lower fat dairy in it, but kinda scared to......it's very decadent as is. A good friend who is a chef told me to buy the crab meat that was mostly backfin with a little claw in it....said claws add the sweetness. THanks, Karyn :)!

Loved it! Delicious! Yummy! Due to other reviews I only used 2 tbs of Old Bay. Is there anyway to make it a little less thick?

UNBELIEVABLY amazing.  I added sauted shallots, onions and mushrooms.  I also used a combination of fat free half and half and regular half and half, and it did not detract from the taste whatsoever.  LIke everyone else, I used half the Old Bay that the recipe called for.  Will definately be making this again and again.

Excellent!!! The only change I made was 2 T of Old Bay Seasoning instead of 3 T only because I was afraid it would be too much of a kick for me and I was right. Except y husband could of totally handled 3T.  My suggestion, go for 2 and then self season.

Excellent and loved how easily and fast it came together.  I used half the Old Bay and no celery seed just b/c that's the number one ingredient in Old Bay so I didn't feel like it needed more.  I also used 2 1/2 cups fat free half and half and 1 1/2 cups skim milk just b/c that's what I had and it worked just fine.  Served with homemade crusty bread (from the book artisan bread in 5 minutes a day - so easy!) and salad and it was a great, filling meal!

GREAT RECIPE!  This soup turned out wonderful.  I cut down on the Old Bay as did others and I do agree that 3T would be a bit much for my taste.  However, this is a recipe that will be used again and again.  Thanks Karyn!

I'm from Maryland and love trying Cream of Crab soup.  After picking the leftover crabs from Labor Day I went with this recipe.  It was the Hollandaise sauce that caught my attention.  It was excellent and I followed it faithfully.  For me and my family too salty due to the old bay so like other posts add it to your desire.  Making it again, this time I bought the crab already picked.  Thanks Karyn.

I lived in DC for a while and fell in love with Legal's cream of crab soup (so good). This is not the same but still good.   Very thick but almost too heavy.  Lose one star because the constancy was not even.     Way, way, way too much old bay. Lose one star because I had to make it twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and could not eat it because of the over powering old bay.

Exceptional! We are Baltimore people and my daughter and I try cream of crab at restaurants all over the place. Our favorite WAS from a place called Legal Spirits in Easton - we liked this one better! I made it exactly per recipe and it was perfection. Don't be cheap - buy the lump! It's so worth it. Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

A lot of people think the amount of old bay is too much, but I actually used more when I made it. I'm from Maryland so I love old bay.. thank you for submitting this recipe! Its delicious and I'll be making it more often.. for those that think the old bay is too much just make sure you never get any kind of crab soup in Maryland.

Easy and rich! I made a couple of changes; I only added 2 T of Old Bay and will even use less next time. I also doubled the sherry and added some Worcestershire sauce which really made the taste pop. I used 2 cans of fancy lump crab and one can of fancy white crab which was a bit more budget friendly. The only reason I gave this four stars is I think the Old Bay was excessive. Otherwise we loved it.

Exactly the recipe I was looking for!  Made a couple changes for personal preference.  Added sauteed celery and onions, upped sherry to 1/4 cup, decreased Old Bay by half.  Used low fat milk and half & half for the dairy.  Added some salt and tarragon to taste at the end.  I'm sure this is a 5 star recipe as is. My modifications were made to match a local restaurant offering and it turned out even better than the restaurants, plus lower fat to boot!  This one was easy and definitely a keeper!

I made this tonight and it was wonderful.  Made as written but used 1 T of Old Bay, and since I didn't have dry mustard I used 1 t of yellow mustard....it worked.  I bought fresh crab in a package...think put out by starkiss.  I found it in the fresh fish section of our Walmart.  I used 2 packages.  We can't always get fresh where I live, so have to go another route sometimes.

OMG!!!!!! This is, by far, the best soup I have ever had! Better than any restaurant even. I did use less Old Bay (1 1/2 tblsp) because of the kids, but that was plenty for us. I will be making this again and again! Already on the menu for Christmas eve. YUMMO!!!

This is a excellent recipe. I made it for the first time last night and I have to tell you it was some of the best soup I have had. I am a Delawarian so I love Old Bay(we eat it on everything even chips) and actually added a extra tablespoon of it. This is my main recipe from now on!

I tried this recipe on 9/15/09 for the first time, IT WAS GREAT!  A little on the spicy side for me, so next time I'm going to cut back on the old bay.  This is the first time I ever made my own cream of crab soup, and as far as I'm concerned I will never need another recipe.  THANK-YOU!

really good, i am going to continue to play with it a bit though. i used 1.5tbls of old bay, next time i will use 2tbls. i used 2tbls of sherry, next time i will use 2.5. i added a pinch of nutmeg as well and it complimented it very very well i highly suggest it. and next time i will also add 1tbls of freshly squeezed lemon. i believe these minor adjustments will make it that much better. but compliments to the poster this is a very good recipe.

Fantastic!  I needed something for some leftover crab meat, and this is by far the best crab soup I have ever made at home.  I used 1% milk instead of half-and-half but kept the whipping cream and it was still thick and creamy.  I also recommend 2 TBSP of Old Bay, or 1 if you are sensitive to spice or salt.  THANKS KARYN!

This  Cream of Crab Soup is the best ever!! preferred over restaurants. I reduce the 3T of Old Bay down to half or less if my daughter is here, (she can't handle the spice & extra salt.) I also use only 2 C. of the half & half or cream and the rest is with milk. Today I used skim milk. and it always comes out great!!!  I don't miss the heavy cream either.

Oh my goodness.... very yummy.  I only used one tablespoon of old bay... I figured I'd add more to taste.  One tablespoon was perfect for me (and I love old bay).  This soup base would be great with mushrooms or a firm fish or asparagus, it's a fantastic " cream of " base.  My two year old is going nuts over it!  Thank you so much for posting a great recipe!

Very yummy, wish I had a bread bowl. I also used 1 1/2 tbls old bay, and skim milk instead of half and half. Also used 8oz im. crab. Hubby loved it!

Probably would double recipe (except for crab) next time and only use 3TB old bay for entire batch instead of 6TB. Seriously good.

I made this recipe AS-IS and it was amazing!  Very creamy and sooo good!  Then I added some sauteed onions and it was even better!  This recipe is definitely going to be a staple in my house.

This recipe is awesome!! A little tweaking though. Definitely add celery and onions in the beginning. Saute then add to soup. Make a roux of the flour and hollandaise. i think it makes a difference. Add a couple dashes of worcheshire sauce(sp). As far as the sherry, I just added some good red wine. My husband and I love this recipe and I am a Maryland girl through and through. Great recipe Karyn!

Cream of Crab soup is my absolute favorite and finally...I no longer have to go to a restaurant to order a bowl, I can now make a nice big pot all for me! This recipe was very yummy. I did modify the seasonings to my liking but not too much. The first time I made this soup it was a little thinner than I preferred so the 2nd time I added another tblspn of flour, an additional pkg of hollandaise and blended with a hand mixer in the pot until very thick and creamy then continued to add the remaining half & half and whipping cream which resulted in a thicker consistency. I also added a tblspn of tarragon and 2 tsp dry mustard. This was a big hit with my fiance and he's not much of a soup guy so I'll definitely be making this again and again and again! Thanks for the post Karyn...

This is a good a you can get in a Maryland restaurant!!  I did cut the old bay in half and used milk instead of the half and half to cut down the fat the 2nd time I made it.  I may try evaporated milk instead of the heavy whipping cream next time to cut down on the fat even more.  My boyfriend LOVES this and is always asking when I will make again!

This Cream of Crab recipe is fantastic! Nothing needs to be changed. The quantity of Old Bay is perfect. I've lived in Maryland most of my life and this exceeds my expectations. Thanks for sharing it with the world.

This is an incredible soup.  I used 2 TBLS of Old Bay and it was borderline too much for me, perfectly acceptable for my husband.  Next time, I may add a touch more sherry.  Great recipe, thanks!

Delicious recipe!  I'm from Baltimore and I am very picky about my cream of crab soup.  It needs to have a LOT of crabmeat and a LOT of old bay.  This has both.  I used a little less of the old bay than the recipe called for while cooking and then just put the old bay on the table  for people to add according to their own taste.  I used 1 1/2 T of cooking sherry because I thought it needed a little more.  You should definitely use backfin or lump crabmeat for a great soup.  Karyn great job...recipe is wonderful!  I'm making it again this weekend for a tailgate:)

Very good.  Definitely rich and creamy.  The only caution that I would give is be careful with the old bay.  I would not add the whole amount right off the bat because mine turned out a little too salty.  Add Old Bay a little at a time to taste.

Awesome recipe!  I cut back on the Old Bay, but provide a shaker of Old Bay for those who like.  I add Dill to the recipe, yum!  just served this soup at a Play-Off party, it was the BOMB!  We had some left (made 6x the recipe) froze the remainder, will thaw for SuperBowl XLI, check back, I'll let you know if it worked.

This was good. Not quite what I was used to eating out.  It seemed a little off some how.  I did cut back on the Old Bay some. It still seemed a little too much and I love Old Bay.  We even put it in our fried chicken.

This dish is great and very easy to make. I took the advice of others and added less Old Bay seasoning. Next time I will add more Old Bay seasoning than the recipe calls for. I like to taste the seasoning in my dishes. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful! Everyone that tried it loved it and wanted the recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Like another reviewer, I rarely give reviews, but this soup is soooooo delicious that I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to review. I’m a picky eater and cream of crab soup is a hit or miss for me, but this recipe hit it out of the park for me. It’s truly a high end restaurant style soup to me. I’m from Maryland, but reading the other reviews gave me pause about the 3 tablespoons of old bay, so I cut it in half. I also used a half spoon more of the Sherry than the recipe called for. The soup was perfect and super easy to make. Thanks for sharing Karlyn!

I agree with the quantity of old bay. I added it in increments and the recipe amount would have been inedible. It’s okay just wouldn’t make it again.

Excellent soup but I added 2 tsp more Old Bay seasoning. Served it with French bread and a green salad. Everyone in the dinner club really enjoyed it. Living on the West coast of Washington it is easy to find fresh caught crab most of the time.

Best Cream of Crab soup recipe I have ever followed. Like others I didn't use as much old bay as was called for but I did use at least 1 1/2 Tbsp. This soup taste better than 90% of the restaurants here in Maryland.

I will admit I went light on the old Bay based on reviews- added only 2 tbsp and allowed those eating to add as they preferred. Being from Maryland and growing up with it, I piled mine on! Delicious. Will absolutely be making again :-)))))

HANDS DOWN THE BEST CREAM OF CRAB EVER... BEINGS MY PARENTS OWNED A RESTAURANT ON THE EASTERN SHORE MARYLAND..WE ALWAYS ADDED A LIL SUGAR TO ALL SOUPS.I SUGGEST ADDING 1/4 CUP TO THE RECIPE.  IT MAKES IT JUST RIGHT. NEVER SOUGHT WIES BRAND CRAB CLAW MEAT. ITS BETTER THAN LUMP FRESH. HAS A SWEETNESS TO IT AND MAKES IT VERY AFFORDABLE. NO INE WILL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE . THANKS KARYN ..

I will definitely make again!  I started with onions, garlic, and olive oil and caramelized them.  Then I added all the recipe ingredients.  I added fresh corn kernels and a little cayenne for more substance and about double the crab.

It was perfect!

Great recipe. I don't use the Hollandaise packet. I use 4 egg yolks, add lemon juice from one lemon and 1 stick of butter. Works better than the packet and I always have these items on hand. Just add where it says to add Hollandaise. The soup is made even richer because of the butter. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.

The best cream of crab recipe I have found. The only change I made was cutting the old bay in half (I leave a can out in case my guest want a little more)  This is now a staple at all my parties & is always a huge hit. I made many C of C soups in my past but was never able to get the consistency right either too thick or too thin. This comes out perfect every time. I cannot thank you enough for sharing this recipe with us.

Thank you for the recipe! This has become our Go-To for cream of crab. Turns out perfect every time. Being from Maryland and Virginia the Old Bay is in perfect portion and is a must! It wouldn’t be cream of crab without it!

This as delishious! Very rich and full of flavor. I made a roux with the butter and flour. I  substituted milk instead of the 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2. And I only added 1T of Old Bay. Any more would have way over powered the dish, and  it’s an easy thing to add at the table. I could only find .9 oz of hollandaise sauce, so I added 2. Next time I’ll try 1 1/2.

Great recipe! Made as is, except I did cut the Old Bay to 1 TBSP to suite my family. My mom has no tolerance for spicy and she loved it that way. I did add more Old Bay to my own bowl - also from MD :). Very, very rich soup and I loved it. It was definitely worth buying real crab meat.  This was a hit and we will be making it again.

I’ve made this soup multiple times. I am from Maryland and a big fan of a good rich cream of crab soup. I’ve slightly tweaked it each time based on what I have. I do always start by cooking some sweet onions in butter, letting them caramelizar a bit and then I start adding all the rest. I just love sweet onions in soup. Sometimes I’ve added some corn, sometimes I’ve gone without. As for there Hollandaise packet I’ve only found it once when making it so the other times I substituted spices for it. It turned out delicious both ways. If blue crab is in season and on sale, I use that instead of jumbo lump crab meat. But that doesn’t happen often! For the Old Bay I cook it with a lot less than it calls for. Closer to 1 TBS, but I leave the Old Bay on the table so each person can add more based on their preference.

Excellent!  I only used 2 Tablespoons Old Bay,.. well you know why,  from the other reviews.  I also topped my serving off with a bit more sherry.   I can see how it would lend itself to other sea foods and some potatoes and corn, but it's awfully good untouched,  other than reducing Old Bay.

Update: I found it got too thick after sitting. I added a lot of milk to the soup which helped. I will make it again but replace the heavy cream with either vegetable broth or regular milk. 

Original post: Great tasting soup. I really had to adjust to my own preference but I can now stop looking for my old recipe. My personal touches are as follows: added a tablespoon of Worcester sauce and added tablespoon of minced onion to the butter when melting. I added tablespoon of dry Sherry & tablespoon of cream sherry. I used unsalted butter & cut way back on old bay (1 tablespoon). I was born in Baltimore & still live here. I am very picky about my cream of crab. This is awesome, just adjust to your own liking.

This crab soup has GREAT flavor!  I cut the Old Bay in half, because even though I enjoy it, I knew 3 tablespoons would be too much for the wife and kids.  It was still good and flavorful.  My only issue is that it is SOOOOO RICH...go figure with all that half & half and cream.  I enjoyed it in small servings, but cannot take a lot.  And it ultimately was too rich for my wife and kids.  I may try again in the future and substitute low-fat milk or water for some of the half and half to try and thin the richness out some.

I love old bay seasoning, but 3 tablespoons was about twice what you needed.  No one liked it and it had $20 worth of crab meat in it.

Did not have enough 1/2&1/2 so used 1 1/2 cup of whole milk. Saved some of the sauce to use later for shrimp bisque. This was the BEST cream of crab ever and I eat at high end restaurants !!!!! Can't wait to use the sauce for shrimp!!!! Love this!!!!!!!!!!

This is a good soup, but there IS too much Old Bay. I'm born and raised in MD and the standard is 1 TEASPOON per pound of crab meat, more or less, to taste. This is a matter of personal taste, so use as much or as little as suits your taste.

The hollandaise is a GREAT addition, adding a lot of flavor; however, I have two suggestions. First, use real sherry, not cooking sherry and use jumbo lump crab meat. Here in MD we use blue crab, but if you can't get that, dungeness or king crab will work.  Actually, any crab you like will work.

This is delicious and so easy to make. I followed other reviews and only put in 1.5 TBS Old Bay instead of the 3TBS the recipe calls for. That’s the only change I made and it was delicious!!! I used Sebastian’s lump crab meat.

Really great recipe'. Have made it as directed.  Just a caution to watch the Old Bay.  Taste before you put in the whole amount directed.  I have also tweaked it to make it less caloric, still great!

Just as good as the ratings would predict!  I doubled the sherry and used 2/3 the Old Bay as recommended by some previous reviewers and thought it was perfect!  This may be the simplest cream soup ever (if it weren’t for shelling the crab).  Flavors are complex - I can’t believe this didn’t take all day.

Best ever! I made this just as described and it was a hit for the family! We are from Maryland so Old Bay is a must and we have had many different versions of cream of crab. This one is now our absolute favorite! I wasn't sure about the hollandaise but I used it and it was way better than the version I've made before. Thank you so much for sharing!

I’ve made this twice now and honestly, the first time I wasn’t crazy about it. But I realized that the hollandaise I had used the first time totally killed the overall flavor! This time I used a packet of Knorr and it turned out great! My husband said it was just a bit too much old bay for him but I actually thought it was perfect with the full 3 tablespoons. I did add about a cup of frozen sweet corn and next time I’ll add some potatoes, but seriously, it was great without ANY tweaking!

Absolutely delicious, as good as the best crab soup in the best restaurants.  And I live in Ocean City Maryland where crabs are plentiful and good crab soup can be had but so can    a mediocre variety.  I now know how to impress my guests.  Only changes, 2 Tbs Old Bay and at least 3 Tbs. cooking sherry.  Next time I will buy regular sherry because cooking sherry has salt in in and that is why I cut back on Old Bay.  If I use the regular sherry, I might increase the Old Bay a little.  I'm sure I'll be making  this often enough to justify keeping a regular bottle of sherry on hand.

My family Loved this recipe!  I am so glad we can make restaurant quality cream of crab soup at home now.  Thank you!!!  I did make a couple small changes after reading through the reviews- 1/2 tablespoon extra of sherry 
& 2 tbsp (instead of  3 tbsp) of old bay seasoning.

Flavor was great!  It was still a little spicy with 2tbsp old bay so I may scale it down a tiny bit next time but man was it good!  Thanks again =)

I liked this. I put 1&1/2 tablespoon of old bay. 1/8 teaspoon fish sauce and 1/8 teaspoon soy sauce. This added a depth to the soup. I also added twice the amount of sherry. This way the old bay doesn't over power the soup. Now I am in love with this soup and was grateful for the recipe. Thank you. Yummy.

I have made 100+ recipes from Allrecipes and this is my first review.  This recipe is perfect.  Everyone of those 100+ recipes, I have either followed and made changes the second time or adjusted recipes because of reviews or preferences, but I would recommend no changes to this recipe.  When I made it, I reduced the Old Bay to two tbsp. and wish I hadn't, but I am also from Maryland.  This is the best cream of crab soup ever.

It was super good. It came out a little lumpy (I used a crock pot). I added shrimp corn and imitation crab meat. Which was fine. I followed the instructions to the T. Can't wait to make it again.

AHHHHHH ! This is for sure a keeper. LOVED IT ! Yummy for my tummy ! I don't care for celery seeds, so I used McCormick's celery flakes. I used the Old Bay a little at a time to get it to my liking.

This was a great soup. I used low fat half and half to be slightly healthier.  About half of the Old  Bay was sufficient.  Adding sherry took it to five stars .  Will definitely make again. One pound of crab is plenty.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner -it was wonderful-not a spoonful of leftover to be had. We had 8 guests for dinner and it was just enough for 8 (this was an appetizer soup-so the servings weren't large)-I highly recommend this recipe. Better than most restaurant soups I've had in the past-

This cream of crab soup was awesome. I had never made crab soup before and I used this recipe . The only change I made was to reduce the Old Bay by half.

This is one of the very best cream of crab soups that I have ever eaten or made ! So creamy and flavorful and EASY to make ! Definitely a keeper and a staple in my house! 
  I changed absolutely nothing but I did add some peas to my own bowl  which made me happy.  So very VERY good. Can't say enough good things about it.

So very simple and awesome. Let me tell you, I am a Marylander and love cream of crab soup. If it's on a menu at a restaurant I try it, that means I've tried a lot. This recipe will stand up to the finest most expensive seafood restaurants in Maryland and the surrounding areas. It's my number one. ?? (P.s. I don't have cooking Sherry on hand, never made the recipe with it, still loved it)

This was a good recipe but WAY too much old bay seasoning. I first tried this soup at a restaurant so my taste buds weren't ready for the amount of saltiness. So next time I will out less of the seasoning and it should be perfect.

Chose this recipe from a lot of Cream of Crab soup recipes I found online to try in preparation for a family meal at Christmas.  Made a single recipe, used claw meat and backed off the Old Bay to one tablespoon so we could add to accommodate individual taste.  I also transferred to crockpot (3 1/2 qt) immediately after adding crab meat and left set on low for 3-4 hours since that is the way I will prepare for the Christmas meal.  It was great!  The crab meat flavor dominated so I added Old Bay to the soup  until it complimented the crab flavor to my taste (my taste buds are from Maryland)!  I suggest this approach for those who might want to tilt the flavor more toward the crab meat.  I plan on doing this recipe    *3 for Christmas and will probably use 1 1/2-2 tablespoons of Old Bay per recipe for our taste.  It will be great!

I thought this was very good crab soup, and I am a life long Marylander. I followed some of the suggestions and only used 2tbs of old bay. It was spicy and a little salty. My daughter thought it was too spicy. Next time I will use 1.5 tbs of old bay. I also used 2 cups of whole milk and 2 cups of half and half. My husband likes a thicker crab soup, so I added a little cornstarch at the end the thicken it up. I would make it again.

My 13 year old daughter made this. The only two small substitutes we made was adding a squeeze of regular mustard for the powdered because I did not have powdered and decreased the Old Bay a bit. It was very good! Even got rave reviews from my husband who loves cream of crab suit and is very critical when he tries new recipes. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Also from MD, I actually added more than 3T of Old Bay. I did add extra skim milk b/c it was really thick. I also used Light cream instead of Half & Half and whipping cream.  I used some Jumbo and some claw meat.  I also added a small sauteed onion because that's what my grandmother did.  Was really super easy and delicious. Thanks.  I've never used the hollandaise before. Great idea.

The absolutely best cream of crab soup we both have ever eaten. I have had cream of crab at many tops restaurants and this beats them all hands down. Rich and creamy and very flavorful.  Perfect combination of seasonings. 

 I did look at previous reviews and only used 1 tbsp of old bay and I had to use 1 1/2 cups of regular whole milk as I only had 2 1/2 cups of  half/half . That was the only changes to the recipe I made.

Thanks so much Karyn for sharing this awesome recipe.  It's a keeper for us!!

Love this soup!  I always always double or triple this.  When I double it, I add more than double the sherry - and I use regular sherry instead of the cooking sherry.  I also add a few tablespoons of sugar and I don't double the Old Bay.  In fact, for a doubled recipe I only use 2 Tablespoons of it.

It was REALLY good! It was a TAD too salty for me so when I make it again (that's right - WHEN), I might decrease the old bay to maybe 2 tablespoons. But other than that, SOUPer! :)

The amount of old bay was perfect, if you don't like old bay, just add one tbsp at a time until your liking, its not that hard.  I had been looking for a recipe that was close to some soup I had in Savannah, and this one is pretty close. Only changes I made were: used one whole stick of butter, 2 tablespoons of Sherry (I would even add more next time), added celery and onions, substituted flour for 1 tablespoon coconut flour, added pepper....Not too rich, and not bland...delicious.

I rarely  leave reviews, but I had to with this one.  I make a Seafood Bisque Soup that my family and friends LOVE, but I think this recipe may beat this one if only by a hair!  This is absolutely delicious.  I made exactly as in the recipe, but only added 1 tablespoon Old Bay to start and that was plenty.  It was perfect.  I have requests to make this again already.

Thank you so much for this recipe!

I made this for a special Birthday/Valentine dinner for my husband.  We live in Annapolis, MD and it had the perfect ingredient - Old Bay.  I made a few modifications.  Decreased Old Bay to 1 1/2 Tbs for our taste, used all half and half, increased Sherry to 2 Tbs and added 1 cup of corn for some crunch.  Everyone loved it!!  Will definitely make again for special occassions.  Paired it with corn bread, veggies and Beef fondue.

I made this for V Day and it turned out great. Since I'm a seafood addict, I added shrimp, scallops, and lobster meat along with the crab.... Turned out great.... :)

I made this for my husband for Super Bowl 50. He absolutely loved it. I'm not a fan of Cream soups. I will be making it again. I followed the recipe to the letter. I've used other recipes but what made this one different was the hollandaise sauce mix. Each time I warmed it up I just added a little milk and it was smooth and creamy as day one.

Outstanding! My family loved it! I'm a native Marylander too and we all thought 3T Old Bay was just right, though it might be a little much for non-Marylanders. can't wait to make it again!

I've made this several times and it is always gone quickly!  I also improvise.  I use crab, crawfish tails, and salad shrimp and add a can of white & gold corn.  Will try it with the sauteed onion, celery and garlic tonight!

I love this recipe and I did not mind the Old Bay, I am a fan of Old Bay and I use it for just about everything. I would not change a thing, this creamy goodness is perfect for those cold winter months. :)

This soup is delicious!  This was my first time making a bisque and this is easy to follow. I doubled the recipe for a large party however I only added 4 tablespoons of old bay and omitted the sherry. It was amazing!  My family is from the Chesapeake Bay Area and said it was just as good as anything they would have down there. Will definitely make again!  Thanks!!

This recipe is spot on. I'm a Maryland eastern shore transplant in NC and made this for my family. I doubled the recipe but only used about 4-5 teaspoons of old bay. I also sauteed half of an onion and two ribs of celery in the butter before adding the hollandaise mixture. This recipe will definitely stay in my rotation. Thank you!!

Super recipe!  Loved it and as a fellow Marylander, I think it could probably handle the full 3 Tb of Old Bay ( I used 2 per reviews).  Right now, it's missing a little something so I think I'm going to go back and add it in. :). I'm also thinking that when I make it again (and I will!) I will sub out at least part of the dairy in favor of some seafood or lobster stock to take it up another level.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this for the first time tonight as a special dinner before decorating the Christmas tree.  I didn't have the recipe with me, so I had to make a few minor changes: I subbed 2% milk for the half-and-half, and half-and-half for the heavy cream.  I also used just 3 tsp of Old Bay instead of 3 Tbsp.  PERFECT!!  I will definitely make this again.

Only got a 9 oz. packet of hollandaise mix, so just added a squirter of lemon juice.  Also doubled the cooking sherry.  Outstanding!

Cut all the ingredients in half (except for the crabmeat!) and it was the best homemade soup I've had. Served 3. Will make again.

Added green onions, garlic and minced celery to the butter and made a roux with flour and hollendais before adding fat free half and half. No need for the full cream, plenty rich and thick. 2 TBS Old Bay and topped with chives. Really good!

I don't usually leave reviews but felt I had to with this. It's honestly amazing! This is the second best cream of crab soup I have had and it's so easy to make! I did leave out the celery seed and Old Bay ( other than a dash) because my husband is allergic, but it still came out amazing. I did double the sherry and add some salt but that's just a personal preference.  There is one downside, however  :(  If I keep making this, my jeans will no longer fit lol

Made exactly as stated and it was PHENOMENAL. I started with half the Old Bay as indicated by other raters, and it was missing some great flavor, so, I added the additional half and it took the soup over the top. Wasn't a drop left and already have requests to make more and requests from others to be invited over while I make it. My boyfriend said he felt this was even better than what was our favorite cream of crab available at a local restaurant!!

Wow. This was the best cream of crab soup that I have ever made. The hollindaise sauce really makes this soup. I was not sure about it at first but will never make it without again.  I am from Maryland and did also use less old bay. That was the only thing I changed.

This was absolutely delicious and was incredibly simple to make.  I live on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and this was as good as our best local restaurant's version.  I used the amount of Old Bay called for, which seemed like the correct amount to me.  But then again, Old Bay is on the table every meal.  Thanks for the recipe.  YUM.

We just got back to our northern home town from a visit to Grandma in coastal Virginia. My daughter had she crab soup every time we went out, so we searched the internet for recipes when we got home so that we could occasionally have this at home. This was the version we chose to try first, and we were very glad we did, because it will be our "go-to" for the future. The resulting soup was comparable to the best of the restaurant versions in both favor and consistency, and we did not really change much at all. I added a half a cup of water with a fish bouillon cube dissolved in it just to give the flour mixture a bit of seafood flavor and used two tablespoons of Old Bay in stead of three. We all liked it that way, but would have liked it the original way as well. The Hollandaise Mix is the stroke of genius that separates this recipe from others.

I made this for the first time for my In-Laws 50th wedding anniversary.  I 4x the recipe and made a huge pot.  People were lined up out the door enjoying it.  The best by far and i'm from Maryland.  This is a must try.  Thanks Karyn for submitting something so amazing.

Excellent recipe! I doubled the sherry and halved the Old Bay and the wife loved this! It is good enough that a second batch is being made tonight!

After living in Deep Southern Maryland for 32 years, I don't consider myself a "native" but I've definitely eaten a LOT of bowls of Cream of Crab soup. Over the years I've probably tried a dozen different recipes and only one or two ever compared to the good "native" (lived in MD for at least 3 generations) bowls served in locally owned family restaurants... Until now. My husband said, "Now THAT is something special!!". Normally I wouldn't dare change a recipe the first time I prepared it. I know it's a "St Mary's County thang" to begin by sautéing in butter one medium onion and two stalks of celery finely chopped, so I stuck to the Mother County roots. Then using a whisk I added the flour and Hollandaise mix to the butter and veggies and continued sautéing for a couple of minutes (made a roux- didn't want to taste raw flour). Then I added the half n half and continued following original directions. She's right- REAL MD Cream of Crab has tons of Old Bay. If you can't handle it, use less. Fantastic recipe!! Thank you!! (In summer, I'll prob add some fresh sweet white corn but that's the NC in me)

I am always looking for a recipe that really stands out from others..........this soup is to die for!!!!! I followed the recipe but also added some chopped celery and green onion. I needed to get my veggies in! I used about 2 tablespoons of old bay and the soup was just spicy enough for me. I will serve this at many dinner parties in the future. Many Thanks Karyn!!!!

Besides cutting the Old Bay in half, I made this recipe as written. It's the BOMB!!! I made it for my family to try before Thanksgiving Dinner. Rave reviews by all. I can't wait to make it again for just my wife and I so we have more to enjoy. Excellent recipe, thanks!!

I'm from Maryland and our wedding theme was "Love, Honor and Old Bay," so I love the stuff -- but even I had to say this is WAY too much! But other than that, this is awesome Cream of Crab, better than most restaurant versions (and we've had it everywhere). Will make this again and again!

This is, no kidding, the best overall soup I have ever had! I liked it so much I had my wife's boss (Chef at a popular Steakhouse) try it and he said it was amazing. I will be making this soup until I die. :)

Baltimore born & raised so I thought the 3 T of Old Bay was yummy (I even added a sprinkle more.) I prefer my cream of crab thicker so I mixed corn starch with cold milk until dissolved then added to the pot. I repeated that until I reached my desired consistency. The flavor was amazing. Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you for sharing your recipe! I made this for the first time and after reading the reviews and tips. Added the small salad shrimp and about double the sherry. I also cooked some diced onion in butter prior to adding the rest of ingredients. Cutting the Old Bay in half did not give it enough spice so I used about 2 1/2 TBS in mine. We love cream of crab soup and this one is just as good or better than any of our favorite restaurants.

Delicious! I made two changes only because I did not have the other ingredients. I used Bearnaise Sauce and Marsala cooking wine to replace the Hollandaise Sauce and Sherry.

Delicious!  I made this for my family of 5 and we devoured it.  Very rich, very creamy and the instructions are perfect.  I used 4 cans crab meat and half the old bay.  I will make this again.

Fantastic!  Served at a covered dish supper and had many raves. Cream of Crab soup should be rich and this recipe had the Midas touch. The hollandaise sauce gave it the extra rich notes.  Should have used all of the Old Bay seasonings called for, I used a scant quarter cup when I tripled recipe, but then I am from Maryland and am used to it.  And very easy!

So amazingly delicious!  The hollaindaise did add a nice flavor and creamy texture.  I did change a few minor things to suit our needs and taste.  I had increased the recipe by 1/2 as we had almost 3 lbs of crab meat from our left over colassal crab legs we had for Valentine's Day.  With this I used 1 1/2 tbls of the Old Bay, used milk instead of half and half, and ended up having to mix up a bit more butter/flour towards the end to thicken up again.  

My husband loved it too and he can be picky.  I think it even tasted a bit better the next day after the flavors continued to mix.  I highly recommend!

Love everything about this recipe. Being from Maryland myself it's hard to find a recipe that lives up to a Marylander's standards and this recipe by far surpasses all expectations. I don't use all the old bay due to the kids not liking much spice but it's just as good with half the amount. Great recipe

The recipe itself is amazing! The whole family loved it! But the lump crab I used had a lot of shells.  Also, I love old bay but I only used 2tbl and it was perfect for us.  Next time I might try it with shrimp! Thanks Karyn!!

Add 1-2 tsp of dried tarragon and it is beyond perfect. Trust me. I grew up eating the best Maryland cream of crab. This recipe is perfect with the tarragon. Perfect.

Oh my - this is ambrosia! I only used half a pound of actual crab and supplemented with another half-pound or so of faux crab, and I did cut back on the Old Bay to taste as I am a wimp when it comes to "spicy," but other than that I followed the recipe as written and this was delicious!

I make this every year (for the last 5 years)for my husbands holiday parties at work. What a hit. Everyone loves it, and at least 5 people always want the recipe. I add 1 tablespoon old bay, and that is just about right. I use low fat half and half, and when I make it just for my husband and I, I will not use the whipping cream, still awesome!

Every time I make this it gets rave reviews. Two changes; I make the hollandaise from scratch, which makes only a small difference in flavor  (it's  great with the packaged hollandaise as well) and I cut the Old Bay to 3 teaspoons and continue to season to taste from there. Awesome recipe! Definitely one of my favorites.

My first time trying any crab soup recipe and this one did not disappoint! It is so rich and creamy! I too cut down on the Old Bay to only 1 tbsp, and used Nature's Seasoning to make up for other. Wonderful recipe! This will be a keeper for years to come! Thank you for sharing!

It was wonderful!!!!!  Tryed to. Get the calerie/ fat count down also price,sigh.  Used sea legs, double strength skim milk, butter buds,  didn't have sherry used a cup of Chablis ,two tablespoons old bay ( will use less next time) 1/4 cup dried onion flakes, and of course the hollandasesauce mix.  Even with all the swaps it was fantastic, can't imagine that the original could be better but when I get to goal I. Sure am going to try it as written!

Unbelievable!!!! I made this as is and both my husband and I loved it!!! It tastes exactly like the cream of crab we order at our favorite MD seafood restaurant!!!!! I consider myself a connoisseur of cream of crab soup because we live in MD and I order it at every restaurant we go to pretty much. My husband couldn't believe I made it from scratch!!! Thank you Karyn for an amazing recipe and for making me look good in the kitchen tonight!! I can't wait to make this again!

Fabulous!  My man is more of a meat and potato person so along with the soup I made white rice w/butter and Tony Chachere's.  I doubled the recipe to last us a few days.  And, I also added crawfish tails and shrimp.

This recipe is fantastic, incredible and so tasty.. I did alter it a little. I used 2 cups of half and half and 2 cups of heavy whipping cream. I did this because of the containers I purchased not to alter the taste. Also instead of the hollandaise sauce mix and flour I used Sysco's cream base. Thanks for sharing.

This is by far the best cream of crab soup ever!  I am also from Maryland, so the crab seasoning is a must...although we use JO Spice, a brand that is produced locally.  In fact, lots of restaurants use JO around here.  I made one small addition...just a dash of Worcestershire.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We love this soup. It is so creamy. Yum. I needed to have the soup and we were in Ohio and I couldn't find a package of Knorr Hollandaise Mix. I had made something before using the Bear Creek potato soup mix and figured what the heck. It wasn't quite the same but it was delish!

This is the absolute best crab soup I have ever tasted. There is a place here in PA that has a great recipe and you can only get it at the summer fairs, but this is recipes is SO MUCH BETTER!! No, it is not calorie friendly, but it sure does not lack in taste. It's like anything that you eat...moderation is the key.

We just slurped this up like no tomorrow! I did follow some of the other reviewers' advice, and I subbed fat-free 1/2 & 1/2 for the regular. It was obviously a bit thinner in consistency, but had outstanding flavor nevertheless! Maybe if I lose my Holiday weight, I'll treat myself to the full-fat version, then go out for a REALLY long walk! I'll definitely be making this again, though, you can count on that! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent!  I've always liked cream of crab soup but never tried to make it before.  I tried it earlier this week because my grocery store had lumb crab on sale.  All I need to say is I'm headed to the kitchen now to make it again!  My hubby and boys (11 & 7yrs old) loved it.  Warm french bread and my now famous cream of crab soup is what's for dinner tonight!  Thanks for sharing and making me look good!!  Oh, and I added shrimp (diced)in it too...superb!

Fantastic! I love cream of crab soup and have only found it good in two restaurants. I made it tonight and it was wonderful! We had leftover steamed crabs that my husband picked for the soup. I followed recipe precisely but since I had the steamed crab meat I didn't use all the Old Bay. I added to taste. I think I will allow to simmer longer to get it thick enough but what I served was quite good. My daughter has already asked for the recipe. Will definitely make this again and for company!  We live in Maryland and are serious about out steamed crabs! Thanks Karyn!

Perfection.  I followed the directions exactly-- except, like the others, I used about half the Old Bay.  It really adds to the flavor without screaming Old Bay, but if you decide to omit, it will definitely need salt.  I also used Knorrs Hollandaise, as one reviewer suggested.  It was packaged .9 oz instead of 1.25, but I couldn't detect any issues with flavor or consistency.  Absolutely loved this and SO easy!  Thanks, Karyn!!!

I hate to give a lower rating to a recipe, but I didn't love this. My guests liked it & were thrilled when I sent home leftovers. My only change was less Old Bay & I still found it too salty. But that said this is a super easy recipe & very, very creamy. If I make it again I will add shredded onion & celery with additional seasonings. That said, I was entertaining "picky" eaters & they really enjoyed it.

My husband is from Maryland and loves Cream of Crab soup. I had my work cut out for me in trying to make it for him. I tried this recipe and it turned out great!! I didn't put as much Old Bay as it called for because I'm not crazy about it, but he added it to his bowl and loved it. He also prefers his soup just a tad thicker than this consistancy ended up, so I added just a little cornstarch. Perfection! Thanks for sharing :)

This is a great basic recipe, but I adjusted it to make it absolutely delectable!  First, I sauteed some veggies I like (red pepper, onion, garlic, celery) for about 30 minutes in olive oil, being careful not to burn.  This creates a super-rich base that is great for any soup or sauce.  At the end of this cooking time, you should have a brown mush with bits that stick to the bottom of the pan.  Then I added all the other ingredients -- except the crab -- pureed it all, then added crab and some corn that I cut off the cob earlier.  This makes for a nice texture.  I made my own hollandaise from this site, skipped the butter and used whole milk instead, which made no difference in the richness because of the vegetable base.  Try it, you'll love it!

This is by far the best soup ever! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly with the exception of leaving out the sherry and dry mustard (didn't have it so I didn't add it). I also added a little more old bay because I love it so much. It was so rich and creamy. It is definitely a new family favorite! Thanks Karyn for sharing!

Oh my goodness! This was delicious! My husband asked if I was trying to kill him as he watched the half-and-half and cream go in the pot...but he (and my 8 and 1 year olds) loved the "broth". I used shrimp this time, as another user suggested, but will try the crab and maybe some additional seafood bits next time. My family also decided that this might taste good over rice or pasta, due to its creamy texture. Totally a keeper recipe! Thank you!

This recepe was awesome! It tasted almost like the Crab Soup we had in DE! My wife loved it and that is a tall order! The only changes I made were I only added 1 1/2 tbls Old Bay and I added 1 1/2 #'s crabmeat (which was almost too much). The flavor in this recipe was GREAT!!!! Thank you and will make this many times again!

This stuff is nectar of the gods.  I used jumbo lump crabmeat, and so the soup has to be completely smooth.  I made it in a double boiler so it can't burn.  I added the liquid that comes with the crab, and let the soup sit hot for some time before serving, so that the crab flavor can go out through the soup.  I used a lot less Old Bay, but had salt, pepper, and Old Bay at the table.  It's terrible to think about, but there are some people who actually like bland food.  Man, this soup is good.

Awesome recipe!  Followed other viewers' suggestions and cut back on the Old Bay but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I noticed this recipe is dated 2006.  How did I miss it for the past 5 years?!

A nice creamy soup! Husband (bless his heart) shelled the crab legs/claws and needless to say there was a ton of small pieces of shells in the soup. Had to throw it out. Be sure you clean the crab meat well if using fresh crab. I will make again and hopefully can eat it this time. :)

Delicious!!  I left out the celery seed because I didn't have any, added a sauteed finely chopped onion, and threw in an extra tablespoon of sherry.  I found the three tablespoons of Old Bay to give the soup terrific flavor.  So easy to make and so very yummy!

The only modification I made on this recipe was I added a teeny bit of salt and one half tablespoon less Old Bay and I must say it is the most raved about dish I have ever made!!  I have family from the islands, both Caribbean and Long Island and everyone wants to know the secret.  No secret, just a GREAT recipe!

I ADORE you for this recipe! I am a huge fan of seafood and had crab bisque at a restaruant a few months ago and have been obsessed with it since! I happened across your recipe and it's almost a duplicate (I think they had a tad more flour to make their's more like a bisque) but other than the difference in consistency, this recipe matches theirs to perfection! and I use just as much Old Bay as you do and I love it. I think it's too strong for most because its a bit on the spicy side and its a strong flavor, both of which I am a HUGE fan of! Thank you soooo very much for this!

I liked this recipe bc it is easy but I noticed that It wasn't very thick like a chowder typically is so i added quick-disolve flour and I added too much and it tasted funny. But before that the flavor was amazing! I'm definitley trying this again.

Excellent!  I have been searching for a cream of crab soup for the longest time.  I believe I have found it!  Made this yesterday.  It was too salty for our taste, so next time I will definitely cut way back on the Old Bay.  Other than that, it was very good.

I followed the recipe but I did reduce the Old Bay as suggested by many others. By the time I added the cup of whipping cream I knew I would not like richness. When it was done I added 1 pt of whole milk that I had on hand. It would have been better to make crab bisque from another recipe on Allrecipes.com. I lived in the Baltimore/Glen Burnie area for years and this recipe just doesn't cut it!

I made this the other night and used 2% milk in place of the half-n-half and the whipping cream only because I didn't have any and it was the best! It came out so rich and creamy and the best flavor. I also added shrimp to it. This is the only one I will make from now on. Thanks so much!

I wasn't thrilled with this soup recipe. I especially wasn't thrilled that I spent $16 on crab meat and didn't like the recipe.  I followed it exactly as this was my first time cooking cream of crab. Maybe my taste buds are just a little different than others. I think it may have been all the old bay and hollondaise sauce...not sure. But thanks for sharing it.

This soup is FANTASTIC!  The Old Bay was a little much but still excellent.  Just put in as little or as much as you like.  I actually put all the ingredients into a crockpot, added 2-3 extra tbsp of flour and let it warm itself and I stirred it occasionly.

I live in Maryland and order cream of crab at every restaurant I come across.  This soup recipe is incredible and was a hit at a recent dinner party.  I added a tad of crushed red pepper for preference.  Well done!

Awesome! At first I cut back on the old bay.. tried 1 tbsp.. needed more.. tried 2, still needed more. Put in all 3.. tiny bit too much. Next time I will do 2.5 tbsp. Very rich and creamy! Will make again!

AMAZING!  What a great base for a soup, other reviewers were right when they said you could add a lot of different things and make a great soup as long as you keep the base.  I added onion and parsley as well as cutting back from 3T of Old Bay to 1.5T, which tasted beautifully.  I also added shrimp as my husband lives under the philosophy that more meat is better (there were all suggested left in other reviews).  The amount of fat in the cream and half and half was a little daunting, so I used fat free half and half and skim milk instead of whipping cream...it had great flavor and was plenty creamy.   One last change.  I live in Wisconsin, and sadly could not find any fresh crab.  I bought a can of pasterized crab, and it was GREAT.  I was worried that it would be fishy.  So, have faith midwesterns!  You too can make this soup (you just might have to run around to find the canned crab meat). Thank you Karyn821

I can't even begin to tell you how great this recipe is!!! The best cream of crab soup I ever tasted, as well as many others whom I have cooked this for.  This is my husband favorite all time dish!! I made this for a party and everyone couldn't belive how good it was. The hostess who cooked most of the food was extremely jealous that everyone was raving about the dish I cooked and not any of hers, lol. The only change I made was that I used low-fat half and half and I aslo used half the amount of celery seed it called for because I can't handle spice well.

I have just discovered crab soup after moving to Williamsburg, VA and love it. However, going out to eat everytime gets expensive. So thought I would try this and it tastes just like the resturant version. Thanks so much!

I really enjoyed this cream of crab soup. I've had and made many different versions of this soup but thus far this has been my favorite. I live in MD as well and am no stranger to Old Bay. I usually use the full 3 tablespoons because I have grown an immunity to the salt content but my mother doesn't feel the same so when I'm making it for my family I reduce the Old Bay content to 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons.  I know this is a cream of crab soup but I like to turn it into somewhat of a chowder.  During the melting of the butter I like to add about a 1/2 c of diced onions until they become transparent. In another saucepan I boil about 1 c of potatoes and I add the cooked potatoes to the soup after adding the sherry and the crabmeat.

I registered myself to allrecipes just so that I can add my review.  This soup is awesome and exactly what I crave for when I order Cream of Crab soup.  Now I can make it at home cheaper and not risk being disappointed.  Made it exactly as directed except my daughter added more Old Bay to her portion.  This will be something I will make often!  Thanks for sharing!

The best cream of crab soup I have ever had.  Super easy and delicious.  My guests couldn't stop talking about how good it was and it tasted better than any restaurant they had been to.  A keeper.

Wonderful soup!  Decided to make this soup as a last minute addition to the menu for a dinner party.  EVERYONE raved about it!  Very simple to make (I am not an experienced cook), great flavor.  After reading other reviews, I cut the amount of Old Bay to 1 1/2 tbsp.  Also had a bag of frozen, de-veined, shell-off shrimp, instead of crab.  Quickly defrosted and then cooked the shrimp in boiling water for 3 minutes (per directions on package).  Will definitely make it again!

This soup was good but VERY RICH - it would be good as a starter to a meal but a bit much as a meal.  I used 1/2 of the Old Bay and am wondering if it would be good with some added vegetables.

I love this recipe!  I did make some minor changes though--I used two envelopes of the hollandaise sauce (one Knorr's and one McCormick which totaled 2 oz.).  I thought it needed to be a bit thicker, so I did mix a small amount of corn starch (mixed with 1/2 and 1/2).  Finally, I added just a touch of parsley.  It was wonderful and my son, who doesn't eat soup loved it.

I took other user's suggestions and used 1tbsp instead of 3 of Old Bay Seasoning and this soup was amazing- my husband who put up a fuss about what I was serving him raved with every bite and said I BETTER keep this recipe!  Great great find and soooo easy to make!

Like many of the other reviewers, I was looking to replicate a delicious crab soup I had at a restaurant.  This is VERY close!  A little thick and creamy to have to eat up all the leftovers though, but I think it would be SUPER impressive for a dinner party!

Fabulous crab soup and very easy to make.  We did half crab and half bay scallops.  We did reduce the Old Bay by half based on recommendations.  My boyfriend thought there was a bit too much celery seed but I thought it was fine.  Will definitely be making this one again!

I agree, this recipe is delicious. Restaurant quality! I might reduce the Old Bay just a little bit next time. I love things spicy but the Old Bay also makes it salty. Will definately make this again for a special occasion.

I just wasted $30 making this. Ended up taking the crab out, and rinsing it off to try and salvage.  Will never ever make again. I tried the 1 1/2 T Old Bay and even my husband who will eat anything wouldn't eat it. TERRIBLE!

Delicious. I made this for my mom's birthday with my family. They loved it. I did cut the old bay down to 1.5 TBSP and it was perfect, not too salty, not too spicy. Great recipe!

Thank you so much! We have been looking for an awesome cream of crab recipe and this one's IT!  My husband is from Maryland and was very pleased with the Old Bay flavoring.  After all...in MD there is no such thing as "too much" Old Bay!  We make this recipe everytime we have leftover hardshells.  It's the best!

Wonderful!  Sublime!  As good as the cream of crab soup at any restaurant!  The only change I made was to halve the Old Bay and use 1.3 lbs of crab meat instead of 1 lb.  Turned out incredible!

Karyn this soup was the best.  I'm from Norfolk VA and I love my Old Bay and I put the amount that you suggested and my family LOVED it.  I will never buy it again because I think my version is better than any resturant.  Thanks for sharing.

This soup was delicious.  I made soup, salad, served with bread.  My husband actually came over and said this was one of the best meals I ever made.  I started out with the basic recipe and then added more half&half and the whole pint of heavy cream - just to make sure i had enough for 8 people.  I halfed the old bay. Even with adding more cream it was great.  OH - I also cubed some canned new potatoes and add did 1/2 lb crab meat and a pound of shrimp.  It was hearty and delicious.  I'm leary of all of the old bay - but otherwise this IS THE ONLY crab soup I will be serving on Christmas Eve (typically I drive an hour to my fave crab soup store)

Sorry but this just wasn't as good as the reviews on here.  I followed the recipe and I think it has too much old bay, but even with reducing that I don't see this one rating much higher than 3 stars.  Ho hum.

Good soup, but I followed the directions and added all 3 tbsp of Old Bay.  Way too much and ruined it for me.  Next time, I will add maybe 1 tbsp and it will be good.

This was a great soup, although I will add half the crab next time.  The taste of the sauce before I added the crab was UNBELIEVABLE! Unfortunately, it was completely overpowered by the crab once I added it.  Oh, and the old bay amount was perhaps a little much, just add to taste!  A fabulous recipe Karyn!!! Don't mean to take anything from it, we just all have our own taste buds, right?

This was an Awesome crab soup. My husband and I frequent a local restuarant for their She-crab soup; so it's been my mission to make something close to it as possible. And let me just say, Karyn's cream of crab soup is almost exact, except for just one thing it doesn't have as much old bay seasoning as Karyn's Crab Soup. None the less this was still out of this world. And, the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I felt there was to much Old Bay. Next, time I'll just add 1 1/2 -
2 tablespoons of Old Bay. Thanks Karyn for this AWESOME RECIPE.

YUMMY!
I am a Baltimore girl myself and very serious about my seafood.  I used only lump crabmeat and followed the recipe.  The amount of Old Bay was perfect for me -but then again, I was born eating it.

I found that this came out a little bit too thick and I thinned it down with some milk.  The flavor is great with the cream, though.  I used lump crab meat and it all sank to the bottom, so next time, I will chop the bits of crab even smaller so that they don't sink to the bottom as much

This soup is FABULOUS.  I used much less (only about a tablespoon) of Old Bay, and I think I will reduce it even more next time.  I got absolute rave reviews of this from my family and friends.  It's as good or better than any restaurant version I've ever had.

A local restaurant makes Crab Bisque every Friday and I absolutely love it and have tried several times to recreate.  I have a version that comes close and will tide me over until I'm able to get back to the restauran.  However, this version was absolutely AMAZING.  I read the reviews and cut the Old Bay down to one Tblsp.  I also added carrots, celery and potatoes because my husband likes "chunks".  I live in the midwest and fresh seafood is difficult to come by so I used imitation (gasp).  It was still fantastic.  This is my new favorite dish for certain.

Wow!!  This is AWESOME! Quick!  Easy! Delicious!!  The first time I made it by the recipe.  The next time I added small diced carrot, onion, celery and potato as well as shrimp and bay scallops.  And leftovers are even better after the flavors have blended.

This is the easiest and the best cream of crab soup. My husband is raving about it. Going to use this at our crab feast I know it will be a hit! I actually used a little more old bay than was suggested and I loved it>

All of our seafood eaters loved this! Little embarassed (as Marylanders) that we only added 1 tbsp of Old Bay, but we family members withe heartburn issues, so letting everyone add their own spiciness was a good idea. Becks restuarant in Sykesville is our gold standard, but no one here was thinking about it as we were enjoying this! Really good! Thank you!

I used only 1/2 of the Old Bay and found this to be suitable.  Overall just way too heavy for me, but husband loved it! I'd like to experiment by adding traditional clam chowder ingredients.  I found it to be just what it is titled and not much more.  Loved the idea of the hollandaise though!

Good recipe, but 3 tablespoons of Old Bay is definitely overkill.  I feel like I ruined what could have been really good crab soup.  Next time, I will most likely only use half that amount.

This soup is ABSOLUTELY delicious. I followed others' advice and used only 2 tablespoons of Old Bay, and I added another 1/2 tablespoon of sherry (1.5 total). I will definitely make this over and over again. Thanks!!!

This is by far the best and easiest cream of crab recipe around.  I'm originally from the east coast now living in the mid west and you just can't find good crab soup in Indiana.  My step dad sends my Maryland crab from home and I make this on a whim.  I've used all different types of crab...usually whatever's on sale and it's always great!  I even had cravings for this soup in the middle of summer while pregnant...easy enough to whip together over a lunch hour.

Excellent!!! added extra crab and sherry added a tsp of worcestershire sauce and a tsp of Cayenne pepper. I like my crab soup bolder & spicy and the two latter ingredients did just that. Again, excellent, never thought I could make it better than the restaurants. Thanks Karyn!
