Very good and tasty. Didn't care too much for the special sauce so just used a little. Great pairing of the Salmon and Mango. Will make again.

I know you aren't supposed to change up ingredients in your rating but this was too good not to.  I used left over grilled halibut and flour tortillas and made the salsa as written and basically made soft tacos.  I thought the special sauce was amazing..  Since I was making for two people I reduced the amount of salsa and sauce.  Will definitely make again!
