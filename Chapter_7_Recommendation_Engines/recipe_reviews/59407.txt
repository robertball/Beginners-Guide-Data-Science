I used this marinade for fried fish.  I eliminated the sesame oil, but added a bit of grated lime peel and lemon grass.  I used half to marinade the fish and half to spoon over the fish after it was cooked.  Before serving the sauce, I added a few sliced green onions, hot peppers and grated carrots.  Everyone loved it!  Thank you.

Used this to marinate chicken breast. It was pretty good. This is definitely a marinade and not a dipping sauce. I reserved a lil bit for dipping and it was waaaay to salty used for dipping. I recommend using a dark brown sugar instead of the white. The brown sugar makes it looks more like "barbeque" sauce. I will use this again.

I tried this on my pork chops today when I found out that I ran out of soy sauce for marinade.  I didn't think the fish sauce and honey would work well together but it did! It was perfect! The boyfriend even asked for seconds.  The only extra I added was a dash of red pepper flakes. This worked well with pork but I think it'll be even better with chicken.. Thanks!

I used this to marinade 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts for about 18 hours.  I grilled them and they were very very moist and tender.  If you make this don't expect it to look like the picture unless you use dark brown sugar.  I followed the recipe and it produces an oil colored marinade.  I was just a tad disappointed with this because it lacks something and I think it's heat of some kind.  I wished I would of added some red pepper flakes or hot chile paste to it. I was gonna use mirin for the rice wine but was advised against that and purchased my first bottle of sake at the grocery store for around $8.00.  I think we personally prefer the soy based marinades of this type much better and will stick with those.  Thanks for something new and different to try.

I made this "Thai Barbeque Marinade" without the sugar and it was still more than sweet enough for my taste with just the honey. I was surprised when the "marinade" thickened in the pan. It is not clear to me which ingredient would have thickened it.

This is the best marinade ever!!  We've used it on pork, shrimp, chicken and haven't been disappointed yet.  What a wonderful flavour. We add a little olive oil to the marinade so the meat doesn't stick to the grill. Yum yum!!

I followed this exactly and marinaded boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I grilled them and they were great. Will definitely use this for a summer barbecue! Thanks for the great recipe.

this was very easy to prepare and my family liked it.  i cooked the chicken but then i added peppers, onions, and zuch and made a stir fry using the marinade.  the only thing i would do differently is i would add a little spice to it.

Sweet, complex, subtle, grill to get that nice char and caramelization.  Set some aside for basting.

I subbed trivia brown sugar for white sugar - diabetic. Had no rice wine so used basic white I had on hand. Added sambal  oelek. 1 TLB. It did not come out too sweet or hot. Delish

I didn't have the 6 hours to marinate the pork , but even with the fewer hours the taste was phenomenal. I will do this again and have it marinate overnight to get an even better flavour.

The recipe doesn't state how much meat can be marinated with the given measurements.  I used a pound of beef and it worked out perfectly.  The sauce is very sweet, but if that is what you want, it's really delicious.

Whoa! I thought at first this was not going to be great.. all the sugar scared me. This was AMAZING! We loved it. We will be making it again for sure! Easy, simple marinade.

I added about 1/3 c cilantro to the mix which I may cut back on next time to 1/4c and used 2tbs of honey, but no sugar since I'm not a big fan of sweet marinades. I also added about 1/2 tsp red chili pepper flakes which I think is a must. Used this on chicken tenders and marinaded it for 20 hours (the night before). Cooked up amazing and served with lettuce on the side. Everything was perfect.

I thought this was a very good sauce. I marinated mackerel (next time I will marinate it overnight for even more flavor)and grilled it in foil. I didn't have the rice wine, but read on the Net that apple juice could be substituted. I used the leftover marinade and made a sauce by thickening with a little corn starch. The sauce was very popular drizzled over the fish!
