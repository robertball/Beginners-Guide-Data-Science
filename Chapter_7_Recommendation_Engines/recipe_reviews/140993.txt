I hope they meant 40 pounds of live Crawfish.  If you are feeding people from Louisiana plan on 8 pds of Crawfish per person, elsewhere plan on 6 pds of Crawfish per person.  Not a bad recipe ingredients wise, but the cooking times are way off.  The recipe is best if you combine liquid and powdered Crab/Shrimp Boil as the seasoning for the water.  (To that size pot add one cup of liquid Crab/Shrimp boil not a tbsp).  The vegetables added are ok, there are numerous variations of what vegetables you can add as long as you stick with the main ingredients- onions, garlic, and lemon.  You should add your liquid and dry seasoning combination along with the onions, garlic and lemon and let bring to a boil for 10 min.  Add potatoes and corn (normal size corn on the cob cut in half or use frozen corn on the cob, remember to defrost before cooking) and cook for 10 min at a low boil not a simmer. Add your other vegetables and cook for 5 min then return the water to a full boil and add the Crawfish and cook per the following directions:  Once you add the Crawfish to the boiling water, return the water to a boil, cook for 7 to 8 min.  Immediately complete this next step, it is the difference between good Crawfish and GREAT Crawfish!!  Once you turn the fire off after the 7 to 8 min boil time, place a 2 to 3 inch layer of ice in the pot.  Yes, I said ice! (the pot size will determine how much ice you will need).  Cover the pot and let the Crawfish soak for 15 min.  If you have a strainer i

Being from New Orleans, I know that every family has their own special way of boiling crawfish and this recipe is close to my family recipe. We are all about the 'craw-dads' and sausage and could do w/o the other items in the pot, but we do add corn and potatoes. We've never added mushrooms, artichoke or other veggies. We do add celery stalks to the pot and a heaping bit of cayenne pepper. From time to time we also add turkey necks. No matter how you mix and match this up, keep with the base ingredients: lemon, onions, garlic, crab boil and you will be pleased with the result.

Allrecipies e-mailed this receipe to me a couple days before we went to a our lake house and we decided we wanted to try it there with our friends & neighbors.  WHAT A HIT!!!  We modified it only slightly - we used a large turkey fryer to cook in.  We didn't add the artichokes, we only cut onions in half vertically (didn't slice them), we used 8 large ears of sweet corn (each broken in half) and we used 6 pounds of raw shrimp instead of the crawfish.  After working through the recipe and cooking everything but the sausage & scrimp, we dumped the first ingredients into a large tin pan (about 15" x 24"), then cooked the sausage and shrimp in the same liquid.  Wehn they were done we dumped the sausage and shrimp on top of the veggies.  What a great looking meal and everyone raved about how good it was, and how much fun it was to eat.  We put out 3 pan for everyone to dump the peels and cobs in and ate off of paper plates.  We'll definately do it again.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Boiling crawfish is really idiot proof. It is hard to do a bad job if you keep your essentials the same every time. Always include garlic, onions, lemon, and crawfish boil seasoning. We always include a stick of butter per batch as this helps with the peeling process. Those tails come right out!! Mushrooms, potatoes, corn on the cob, sausage, weiners (for the kids) are always a part of our family boils. This is a very yummy meal with some crawfish dip, ice cold beer, and a wonderful group of people, it can't be beat!!

This was a great variation on mine.  I have never used mushrooms or artichokes.  Corn on the cob can be used instead of baby corn.  Great crowd pleaser.  We used it for our daughter's Christening.  People are still talking.

I think this recipe should read "40 lbs of crawfish" not "4 lbs".  I have not cooked this recipe, but I have cooked lots of crayfish and this recipe seems like a good one.

OMG this was the best tasting crawfish boil i ever ate.  I tried HEB"s market crawfish boil and it was great until I made this recipe then it was excellent.  The oranges and lemon gave it a better taste.  Keep up the great work folks.

This recipe has become a family camping tradition we started a few years ago, this year we ended up with an extra 4 teenagers who couldn't wait to try crayfish.  We make right it on the campfire in a big pot.  I do throw in a couple pounds of raw shrimp and use frozen Cajun crayfish the local store sells.  A huge hit with everyone, thanks for a fun and fool-proof recipe!

This is an AWESOME recipe.  I started with a pile of live crayfish that I was not sure what to do with--never cooked 'em before.  Found this recipe, threw it all in a pot as described with just a coupla changes (thanks reviewers for some helpful hints) and it was AMAZING!My guests who have been to Louisiana for the real deal said mine was BETTER! Dang I'm good...

What’s with the oranges?  That’s not at all traditional.  You were so close, then you added green beans and oranges.

I mostly followed the recipe. The times with my propane burner and pot were spot on. I used shrimp instead of crawfish, so I guess I cheated there a bit... onion, potato, and corn turned out great. I didn’t spice mine up too much because I have picky grandkids, and I can add heat later. Good recipe as a foundation or I imagine if you use as-is.  Dumped it all into a styrofoam cooler for serving. Didn’t have the fancy paper to put on the table. :)

First time making it, wife says that it could be more spicier. She wants it to stain your hands red when you eat it but she still loved it though.
I liked the way the sauce came out, haven't drained it yet.

I have made this twice.  The second time I used shrimp. I saved much of the stock when I drained the vegetables.  Then once the stock returned to a boil, I dropped then in for 60 seconds and then quickly drained them and put them under some ice and cold water to stop the cooking process.

If you put that much seasoning in with 50 crawfish you won't be able to eat it. You would have blisters in your mouth and on your lips!! Way too spicy!!
