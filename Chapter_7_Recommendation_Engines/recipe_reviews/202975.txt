Awesome, AWESOME recipe! I changed mine a bit, and greatly reduced the quantity (made 4 servings instead of 12... but I still had a bag full of extra filling after making 10 stickers for me and my roommate!). I actually used sausage instead of shrimp and beef, but next time I think I'll use half sausage and half ground chicken (the flavor was VERY strong, which we liked very much, but others may not). I did not add any sesame oil, and added a bit of honey insead of the sugar. Also, I cooked the meat/cabbage mixture in a pan until nearly done, and then stuffed the wrappers. I baked the potstickers at 425 degrees for 7 minutes, turned them over and baked for another 3 minutes. Came out perfectly crispy outside with the piping hot filling juicy on the inside. Delicious!! **also, I added minced garlic, of course!

Great recipe. I did mine without the shrimp (didn't have any) and added orange zest for an incredible flavor. I used my bamboo steamers and skipped the frying stage to save time and calories. If you put the pot stickers on lettuce leaves in the steamer, they won't stick. Serve them with a dipping sauce of soy sauce, rice wine vinegar and white suger.

I handed out this recipe to all of my colleagues.  amazing flavor and texture but, for a dumpling novice like myself,  the prep of stuffing the wontons took FOREVER.  I cut the recipe to 1/3 : 1/3 lb shrimp and 1.3 pound ground beef was enough for an entire packet of gyoza wonton skins.... we ate them for days!  after trying to pan fry all these little dumplings and spattering the kitchen with hot oil because my dumplings were kinda wet, I gave up on the frying method.  Instead, baked the filled wontons and then steamed them.  Bake at 275 for 10-15 minutes until slightly dry then steam for 10 minutes. As an experiment, we also steamed then baked... that worked pretty well too.  I would be willing to do it all again!

It's great to see a non-pork recipe for pot stickers! These were ok but I probably won't make them again because the middle became a hard ball regardless of whether we steamed the pot stickers (if steaming lay down a bed of napa cabbage leaves so that they don't stick to the basket) or cooked them in a pan as instructed. We used lean beef and think that may have been the problem. We did love the smell, however, as we were grinding all of the ingredients in the food processor. It smelled exactly like our favorite Chinese restaurant. A few tips: when sealing the mixture in the gyoza wrapper make sure you squeeze as much air out as possible before sealing. The times we didn't remove all of the air our pot stickers puffed up while cooking. This recipe makes a lot of pot stickers (4 pounds of beef worth) so watch out for that. We ended up using three entire packages of gyoza wrappers and each package was around two inches high. Also, when freezing these pot stickers you'll need to freeze each dumpling separately before putting all of the dumplings together in a freezer safe bag. This might be common sense to some, but we just threw all of them in a bag together to freeze and they were a pain to thaw, separate, and refreeze when we wanted to eat them. I'm not sure which sauce is supposed to accompany these pot stickers but we made a very simple sauce from lime juice, orange juice, and soy sauce (a tad bit more orange than lime but enough soy sauce to make it taste good).

GREAT RECIPE! I used ground pork instead of the shrimp/ground beef. They tasted just like restaurant made.

Yummy!  I cut the recipe in half and had plenty of leftovers to freeze for later use.  A few minor modifications I made for a healthier version: baked at 425F for 10 minutes instead of frying; substituted ground turkey for the ground beef.  I will definitely make these again!

These were OK, but still prefer the pork & ginger version...and before I made these I cut WAY back on the shrimp and beef!  I make my own dipping sauce: 1/3 C soy sauce, 1/3 cup rice wine vinegar, (or Mirin if you like a sweeter sauce) 1 teaspoon sesame oil, 1/3 C sliced green onions, & 1 Tbls of Sambal. (An Asian condiment found in Asian or some grocery stores.)

These pot stickers are wonderfully tasty. I did use ground turkey instead of the beef, but they still turned out fantastic. You can do up a batch and freeze them for nights you have guests over, they're a wonderful hor d'oeuvre too. I use my beef to make my samosas, so there will be a variety. Thank you for sharing Ayeen!

This is a great starting recipe. I use thin wonton wrappers (square) maybe a touch smaller.  I also steam them in a bamboo steamer set in a wok, spray bamboo with non stick spray and steam for 6 to 8 depending on amount or stacked levels of bamboo.

This recipe was awesome!  I only made a 1/2 of  a batch!  I used ultralean ground beef, added a little more cabbage, and one tablespoon of fish sauce!  They were awesome!  Even my kids who are picky eaters when it comes to non-traditional food LOVED them!  My skinny little guy ate 10!  They are definetly worth the work and a nice alternative to pork!

This recipe turned out fantastic! It has an amazing, authentic flavour. I just have a few things I'd like to point to novices like me: 1) Blenders do NOT make a suitable replacement for a food processor. I thought it would work, but it just turned my shrimp into this disgusting liquid. (Next time I plan on mincing the shrimp by hand.) 2) I couldn't find round gyoza wrappers, so I bought wonton wrappers instead- this made a good substitute. 3) When freezing, remember to freeze the pot stickers partially first on a baking sheet without toughing. Then you can place in a freezer bag. 4) This recipe as is makes A LOT of filling. I had almost enough to fill two packs of wonton wrappers (~56 in each). Take that into consideration when doing it yourself. 5) When frying the pot stickers, do not use too much oil. Since there was no measurement of how much to use, we used quite a bit of oil, and it made them a bit too oily for our liking.

It's interesting that this recipe is called Chinese Dumplings, but uses Japanese Gyoza wrappers. It makes for an entirely different texture, but in my opinion, a better one. For those who aren't sure, the typical dipping sauce for Gyoza is a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, and if you like (which I won't go without) La-Yu, which is just chili spiced sesame oil. You can mix to a ratio which you like best, but a little of each ingredient goes a long way!

I tried it with the ground beef and did not care for them. Use ground pork for traditional flavor. Also, I don't process the shrimp. I leave them whole and put 1/2 shrimp in each dumpling.

Superb recipe!  Loved using beef and shrimp together and the method of cooking the beef first is what really adds the flavor.  Added tons of chives, mung bean noodles and left out the sugar.  Thanks Ayeen!

These are delicious! The sauce is incredible as well. Labor intensive, but I froze most of them prior to cooking and they tasted just as good as the freshly made ones. I made them with shrimp and pork sausage instead of ground beef which added a little more spice. YUM!
I did not have any trouble with the oil followed by water as long as I put the lid on immediately and they came out perfectly browned.

Pretty good and fast if you use a food processor.  I used 3/4 lb of shrimp and 1/2lb of beef and it was enough.

These turned out great! I used kale instead of cabbage (that's all I had) and only used 1 lb of shrimp (skipped the beef). These came out better than I expected. As good as anything I've had in any restaurant, but I'll use cabbage next time. Be warned that this makes a lot of potstickers. I only used 1lb of shrimp and still had enough filling for an entire package of wrappers (about 50). I used the recipe for "Gyoza sauce" from this website. I ended up freezing most of them.

omg. Thats all I will say. I too added some minced garlic. I used olive oil instead of sesame oil. I also used regular cabbage, some fresh sage and omitted the ground beef and used ground pork instead. I will not however be making these again unless it's for a Holiday. I started at 2 and didn't get to put one in my mouth until 5:30 (no food processor). lol. All in all a fantastic recipe.

These are so delicious and not too difficult or time consuming.  I used light olive oil to make them a little healthier, and my local grocery didn't have shallots so I left that out.  Other than that, I followed this recipe exactly and was very pleased. :)

I used one pound of cooked chicken and reduced the serving to three. These are really tasty an even with reducing the serving size to three the recipe made more than 75 pot stickers. I baked some and steamed and fried some. They were all good, but my favortie were the the steamed and fried. My husband liked them all. I made a dipping sauce of rice vinegar, soy sauce, green onions. Just look on Allrecipes recipe. I will make again, but need to fiqure out an easier steaming, frying method.

These pot stickers were good, but the amount of time that took to make them was entirely ridiculous for me.  Also, I didn't want that many so I decided to only do 5 servings instead of 50 which I thought meant that I would only have 10 to do.  I ended up using all 50 of my wrappers with extra filling left over that I couldn't really do anything with.  It was very frustrating and time consuming and I don't think that I will be making them again

This recipe is really good. I followed others recommendations and halved the recipe...glad I did because it still made a ton! I used 1 lb beef and 1 lb ground pork in mine. Seem said it was a hard meatball so I upped my cabbage and green onion portion and that helped, and I used the full amount of sesame oil and soy sauce instead of halving it.  They were time consuming to make and I could only find square wrappers but they turned out nice. I think I had the oil too hot so they got a little crispier than I prefer but that's my fault. Overall, will totally make again! :)

Instead of the 4 lbs. of ground beef, I used 1-1/2 lbs of ground pork. I also used about 3/4  cup of green cabbage instead of napa cabbage. For the cabbage I put it in a separate bowl with sea salt and masticated it - squeezing out excess water. 
I had two package of won tons (which I cut the corner off and basically rounded the corners). 
This turned out making 100 of the best pot stickers I've ever had! I would have given this recipe 5 stars except I think the amount of ground beef was way off track. One pound of ground shrimp and 1-1/2 pounds of ground pork with the other ingredients was, in my opinion, right on.

I substituted beef for chicken and they still came out absolutely delicious! I found it was a bit too salty with regular soy sauce so you might want to get low sodium.

Delicious! I used wonton wrappers and made them into triangles. 15 shrimp mixture, 15 with a mix of pork, beef and veal, and 15 with shrimp and meat mixture. I did not cook veggies and doubled the amount using napa cabbage, shallots, scallions and carrot and but in blender to chop up fine. As good as our favorite Japanese restaurant! I just need to perfect the dipping sauce (recipe from this site).

Really easy. I used ground pork.  I added garlic and since I didn't have Napa cabbage, I shredded some romaine lettuce.  I tried oven baking at 425 degrees as well as frying some as the recipe stated. My family liked the fried better. I froze a batch for the Super bowl!

I used 1/2 the beef and subbed the other 1/2 with ground pork. Other than that the only change I made was to add a little minced garlic. They turned out really, and freeze perfectly too.

This is a great recipe, but I've found that the essential flavors, for me, come from the mixing of ground pork with shrimp.  From there, add whatever you like that has the flavor you are looking for and you will not be disappointed.

This was recipie made a pretty good dumpling. The issue is the portion is absolutely crazy. I made 33 dumplings with less than a 1/4 lb worth of filling. At this rate i can make almost 600 more dumplings. If you make this recipie do 1/10 of what it calls for or you will be making dumplings for hours and hours. Also after following this recipie to its exactness the dumplings had little seasoning. Id strongly suggest make a test batch of dumplings then season the meat more if you need to.

Love the Napa Lettuce, unexpectedly tasty!  

This recipe looked so good when I found it, but I decided to change it up slightly based on all the reviews saying there was so much mix left after making all the dumplings.  Here's how I made this recipe into meatballs that I could bake and then freeze.  Follow step one completely, then add 1/4 cup of oyster crackers crumbs (I used a coffee grinder) and 1 egg for each pound of meat (I had 4 lbs. of meat = 1 cup of oyster crackers and 4 eggs). Use a melon scoop to get the meatballs, bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, turn the meatballs, bake another 10 minutes. You can make about 100+. AMAZING!  After freezing, I use about 6-10 in Ramon noodles (throw away that nasty season packet) with 2 cups low sodium beef broth or about 12-15 when I cook the rice for fried rice.  Then just add the dip (soy sauce with rice vinegar).  They do better if you can boil them (done when preparing the noodles or rice) to make sure they are completely heated and not dried out from freezing and thawing.

I am a single person who is tired of eating out, so I look for good recipes that I can freeze and eat later, which is tough when most recipes are meant for a family of four and don't always keep/freeze well.  Keep in mind, you don't want to keep them in the freezer longer than the normal 3 months, but that gives you plenty of time to mix it up and still get good flavor in your dishes.  I highly recommend this recipe!!!!

I cut the recipe in half. I made these for a party because two of my friends don't eat pork, at first I was hesitant but they came out delicious! I've had everyone asking me to make them again or give them the recipe. So happy with the results.

I made these for the first time. I used ground turkey and since I don't care for shrimp, I crumbled firm tofu into the meat filling mix. I'm still working out getting the frying part down as my dumplings browned too quickly, but other than that, they were delicious! Oh and I actually reduced the ground meat to 1 pound, added 1/3 package of firm tofu and cut the other ingredients in half.

I loved these dumplings! I had a taste for dumplings while at work, found this recipe, and hit the grocery store as soon as I got off! Unfortunately, I live in a food desert with one grocery store with super limited supply. The store isn't hip to things like napa cabbage or gyoza/potsticker wrappers so I used regular cabbage and also made my own wrappers using flour, a bit of salt, and hot and cold water. I also subbed In turkey in lieu of beef. They came out EXACTLY the way that I wanted them to.  I will definitely make again!

I have a quick question for these.  You don't cook the ground beef and shrimp first? Grind them in the food processor raw?  I am ok with that, just wasn't sure if I missed something or not?  Thanks in advance!

I have made these many times.  My whole family loves them, especially my kids. It does make a TON of filling, so I usually half the recipe.  They freeze marvelously, and go straight from freezer to skillet. 2 meals in 1! I use ground turkey and chicken instead of beef and shrimp.

I made it with ground pork (no beef or shrimp) and everyone liked them. I also took out the meat altogether and made a vegan batch and those went faster than the pork ones. For those, I increased the veggies (especially the cabbage), added a splash more sesame oil (for the moisture), a couple extra splashes of soy sauce (for flavor), and a little bit extra ginger. I steamed them for about 5 minutes, then fried the bottoms to give them a better texture. 

I am sure the shrimp and beef would have added some flavor to the meat ones. I will probably try them again exactly as written.

Like others, I used pork instead.  I have a family member that has an allergy to shrimp so I skipped that as well.  Though time consuming, these are so worth the work! I serve them over a bed of rice with sauce and it makes a meal.  My kids will pull frozen ones out of the freezer and make them for a late night snack.  They steam in the microwave.  For myself, I will add the water and oil together in the pan in the beginning of the process. Let the water steam away and finish up frying them.
