I can't help write my review right now as I sit here and eat these AMAZING waffles.  They are crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and oh-so-yummy; especially if you love gingerbread!  I didn't have any whipped cream to put on top but I have chopped up bananas and powdered sugar on top.  I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe and would definatly make it again!

Delightfully delicious!! My husband said, "these are great! Where did you get the recipe?" - a true triumph. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used ww pastry flour and subbed canola oil for butter.  I dusted the waffles with powdered sugar. This recipe made 3 large waffles... I overcooked the first because it was spongy (previous reviewers noted the crispyness) - it burnt before it got crispy, but when it cooled -voila- perfect crispyness. You'll just have to guesstimate when they are done, since they are so dark, you can't tell if they are golden - probably judge by smell or steam, or trust the machine's indicator. Update:  I made these again, but forgot to add brown sugar and raisins - I missed the raisins but the waffles were perfect sweetness w/out the sugar. Also, I used Pam for Grilling spray on the waffle iron, and it worked better than regular Pam.

These were delicious even though I was missing some ingredients.  First, I substituted pure maple syrup for the molasses.  Then I had to make my own allspice - equal parts cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves & ground black pepper.  Finally, I didn't have buttermilk, so I put 1 Tbsp lemon juice in a measuring cup and added skim milk up to the 1 cup mark and waited 5 minutes and then added 3/4 c to recipe.  I also added 2 Tbsp flax and 2 Tbsp wheat germ.  Despite all of my substitutions, they were wonderful!

My family (kids age 6 and 3) adored this recipe.  It was very sweet - we didn't have the whipped cream and used syrup.  My husband had a better idea for the waffles.  We took the warm waffles, added vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup on top.  What an unforgettable dessert!  Great taste combination!  Double the recipe - this will be loved...

These were super yummy.  I would have given 5 stars but my ginger was old so it wasn't too gingery but I bet with normal ginger it would be even more delish.  I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did because it didn't yield too many waffles (probably like 3 belgian waffles with the single recipe).  I didn't double the molasses though b/c I think molasses is so strong (I don't have a lot of molasses exp. here) but maybe it is b/c I have "cooking molasses".  Our family ate it with applesauce and whipped cream on top.  Such a great combo of flavors.  Next time I'll try substituting a bit of wheat flour or wheat germ in to make a bit more nutritious for a dinner.

The taste is great, but there's too much labor and not enough crisp.

These are the best waffles ever.  It is a little bit labor intensive for first thing in the morning so I make this as a Saturday late breakfast.  I served it with cinnamon syrup (found on this web site) and saugage.  What a treat. Very filling.

Ive been making this recipe for a couple of years now and I love them!  They taste a lot like regular gingerbread which has always been a favorite of mine.  When I make them I cook extra waffles to put in the freezer for future use.  (They even taste good frozen!)  But I do reheat them in the toaster for a quick morning fix.

wow. thank you...my 3 year old doesn't like to eat breakfast. She 'snacks' on an apple or a gogurt, but it drives me nuts because she won't eat something substantial! So, I thought I would make and freeze waffles and see if she was interested. Looked and looked for a recipe I thought she would enjoy and SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVES THESE!!! So I used wheat flour and 1/2 honey 1/2 molasses (ran out of molasses) and did add the raisins. She is currently on her 6th quarter...no butter or syrup, just the waffle. Thank you! I would much rather her eat these than blue raspberry gogurts!

I didn't add the raisins because they are one of the only four foods that my husband will not eat.  I halved the molasses at the recommendation of most other reviewers.  I also used half ww flour half white (since our family can't tell the difference).  They are a really hearty waffle and can stand up to the bulk so next time I will use all ww and add some flax and wheat germ.  We had no problems with them crisping up, so the reduction of molasses probably helped.  Even my skeptical husband thought they were great.  After the first batch I asked my three year old what he thought and he said that they needed pecans.  We added some and I thought they made a great addition instead of the raisins that I would have loved to have used:).

I made these as hangover food for a house full of guests over Halloween weekend. Everyone ate and enjoyed them, but no one seemed wowed. But, that might have been the hangovers. I loved them WITH the whipped cream and bananas. I think they were necessary additions. I'll definitely make these again closer to Christmas.

Followed the recipe to a T except we left out the raisins (husband does not like them. These waffles are wonderful. However they do not crisp until they coll a bit. The first one I had I over did because I kept waiting to it to crisp in the waffle iron. I cooked the others until the steam went away took them out let them cool for a min and they crisped perfectly!!!  Our new Christmas tradition thank you

I just made these for me and my husband. I haven't even had a bite yet but my hubby just ran down the stairs after eating his (he ate the whole thing!) and proclaimed, "This is the best waffle in the history of the universe!" and he doesn't even LIKE waffles! I added the sliced bananas and real whipped cream. Be sure not to overcook them. Take them out when the steam is almost gone. I like ginger things SUPER gingerie - so next time I'll probably add more ground ginger. YUM!

These are absolutely wonderful on a Fall morning.  I love the flavor even though they are a little soft.  I would make these every time if they didn't take just a little bit longer to make than most waffles.

Loved these. Lt crisp, fluffy, not overpowering flavor.  Made exactly 4 belgian waffles. No Buttermilk? In a one cup measuring cup pour 1 TB vinegar then fill to top with milk, let sit 5 minutes. Thanks Ann!

Absolutely amazing. I served these at a brunch along side Cinnamon Belgian Waffles (also delicious!), and these blew all competition away. I served them with sliced ripe bananas and real whipped cream (as shown in the photo), but they are also outstanding with applesauce on top. My son (5 years old), devoured several without any topping.   They taste like gingerbread that you would have for dessert. Very satisfying and just wonderful.  I followed the recipe, but omitted the dry mustard and raisins. Neither were missed.

These were delicious.  The batter tastes exactly like gingerbread!  I reduced the sugar and the molasses to 3 tbsp each, because I like to have syrup on my waffles, and these would have been too sweet with syrup has I not reduced the sugar.  You could probably eliminate the sugar all together and just use the molasses, because they were still very sweet even with the reduction.

The taste was good but it was very soft.  I had a hard time just transferring each out of the waffle iron onto a plate.  Not sure if it is the recipe or the waffle iron but I do know that I've had others come out crispy on the outside before.  I wish I knew...

I got 8 waffles out of this recipe using a quarter-cup (size 12) ice cream scooper. In my house that's called 4 servings, but DH routinely eats 2-3 servings anyway :D I thought these would benefit from more molasses but otherwise I have no complaints. I do wish I'd made a proper lemon sauce for them instead of just drizzling with lemon juice and confectioner's sugar, though they were certainly tasty that way with berries. Thanks for sharing!

My family loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly (other than a small mishap with the cream of tartar) and it turned out beautifully.  We ate ours with maple syrup and blackberry syrup.  I doubled the batch, good thing too because between the 6 of us they were devoured!

I said to my husband, "These better be good for as much work as they are to make."  These far exceeded any expectation I had.  It felt like my tastebuds were dancing in my mouth. The family loved them.  The flavor was so incredible they didn't even need toppings.  Keypoint: Take into consideration the recipe is for 3 servings.

Taste is excellent. I didn't have mustard so left it out. It was not the easiest recipe in the world which is why it's getting 3 instead of 4 stars. It also used a lot of bowls and utensils which is not as fun for a morning endeavor. Also the ginger outweighed the buttermilk flavor which made it a little pointless.

Super Amazing Delicious! Our new Christmas morning tradition. I substituted crystallized ginger for raisins. Only drawback to these is that it is hard to tell when they are done due to the color of the batter. Still totally worth it.

fan-freaking-tastic! I was a little worried about the mustard, but I didn't notice it...I didn't do the fold the egg whites bit because I'm a rebel like that
We will be making these again soon, thanks for sharing!

This was okay.  Pretty heavy.  Tasted good, but I probably wouldn't make it again, unless maybe at Christmas time.

I was considering making gingerbread when I ran across this recipe. Yes, it was labor intensive, but I thought it was worth it. My Jamaican husband did not understand why anyone would want bananas with gingerbread!?? Anyway, the next time I make this recipe, I'll either cut the brown sugar down to one or two T. or eliminate it because we like syrup w/waffles for breakfast. I don't usually care for raisins that much, but these were a great addition. Also, our waffles never got crisp.

Whoa, one waffle is definitely enough for breakfast! Made this for my partner and self - our waffle maker made two with this recipe.  So soft, yet with a little crunch - tasty!

These were a nice change of pace but I wouldn't make them frequently, they are rather labor intensive for what you get.  The recipe made just the right amount for our family with no batter left over.  We did omit the raisins, as I had two children who really couldn't wait any longer to eat so I didn't want to take the time to chop them and knew the boys would not eat them whole - I'm sure they are a tasty addition when chopped though.  We sprinkled a little powdered sugar on top and found that syrup was unnecessary.  thanks for the recipe!

So, it's a bit strange rating this recipe, since we doctored it significantly to account for missing ingredients, as we are in Australia where there is no molasses, we didn't have allspice, and we made pancakes instead of waffles.  So, we used a generous half a cup of brown sugar instead 1/3 cup to make up for the molasses flavour, used 1/8 tsp each of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and a pinch of black pepper to substitute for the allspice, added about 1/2 cup of extra flour, and added extra milk until the consistency was right for pancakes.  They were super-yummy!  Nice and gingery, light, tasted great with some real Canadian maple syrup, strawberries and cream.  I'll use this recipe again!

These were the worst waffle disaster of my life. They were soft and cakey and stuck to my waffle iron even when I liberally oiled the 'non-stick' surface. I thought they sounded lovely, so I doubled the recipe for my family of 5. I don't know if that would be the same for a single batch, but if you double it, *do not* double the molasses.  The taste of the fragments I managed to scrape off my waffle iron was nice, but even if they'd come out whole, it was far too much work and mess for too little gain. Maybe it would work better as cake or muffins.

These were very good. I tweaked the recipe a little because we were using them for dessert. We did a triple batch cause we had a party so It made a lot. I was trying to use up the last of some older spices so I doubled them and added a little more brown sugar since we were not putting syrup or anything on them. Also did half molasses and half sorghum syrup cause I was desperate to try the sorghum that we just got at a craft fair. Topped them with whip cream or vanilla ice cream and the kids thought they were great. Thanks

These are nothing short of splendid!  I love the flavor and texture of the softer waffle.  I didn't have cream of tarter, nor did I split up the egg yolk and egg white, but they were perfect.  Thanks!

These waffles were very soft.  They had pretty good gingerbread flavor.  I only added 1 large tablespoon of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of molasses, other wise they would have been way too sweet for my families taste.  I also added ground nutmeg.  I did not use raisins, instead, I used sliced bananas.  I put the bananan on top of the waffle before cooking, while the waffle cooked the bananas carmalized on top and gave it such a wonderful flavor. I don't know if I would make them again, but they were worth trying at least once.

These are delicious. I've had them a few times already. Always plain as they're so good they don't need anything else. Had them both the way written and with some changes. I'll keep making them with my changes though. I've only made two and they are 1) I used sifted whole wheat flour instead of white and 2) omitted the butter entirely. I didn't find the butter to be necessary at all. It is hard to tell when they're done since they're so dark. So it might be best to time it and write it down somewhere (which I still have to do). And as some others have said, they will become a bit crispy as they cool down. Will definitely be making these again and again.

They were good, but the gingerbread taste was too mild for me.  I really like the taste of the Williams Sonoma Gingerbread pancake recipe, which has 1/8t of Cloves, which probably gives it that spicy gingerbread taste I'm looking for, so I'll add that next time.

These waffles were delicious! I gave them to the kids and they got scarfed up. The flavor is really good and I didn't need to add anything to this recipe. We will definatly be making it as a regular! What a great fall recipe!

My family considers themselves waffle connoiseurs...and these are now their favorite waffles (and mine too :-) ).  I used a belgian waffle maker and doubled the recipe (6 servings) and got exactly 6 waffles--1 each and 3 for the freezer.  The recipe was rather complicated compared to a box mix but the end result was definitely worth the extra effort!  I changed nothing and they turned out perfectly!

This was very tasty! We followed the recipe exactly and topped it off with whipped cream. Be prepared to see DARK waffles. My husband thought I burned them at first. They do come out soft and crisp up perfectly. For our family of 3 little ones and 2 adults (so like 4 adults) tripling the batter was about right. My kids ate two pieces (3 and 5), which is good for them.

Very, very yummy.  I made them as written, only leaving out the raisins, and they are great with just a little whipped cream or a little butter.  As everyone else says, they aren't crispy (because of the molasses, I guess)?  They do get a little crispier when you let them sit for a bit.

Wonderful recipe for something different than your traditional breakfast!  I listened to a few of the reviews and used slightly less molasses so it was not too overwhelming.  Topped it with powdered sugar as others suggested as well.

My family enjoyed these waffles.  We love the taste of gingerbread and this recipe did not disappoint.   The smell coming out of the waffle maker was mouth watering.  I served with bananas and whip cream.  I'll be making these again.  Thanks for the recipe :)

omg!sooooo good! I even goofed it up and it still came out great! I didn't have molasses. substituted honey instead. used powdered buttermilk. and didn't cream yoke with brown sugar. it was fabulous,with nothing on it. the first batch stuck to the waffle iron. came out in half so for my son i but cream cheese in the center and dusted with powder sugar. was a hit! thanks so much!

I was looking for a way to use up some extra molasses, and I'm SO GLAD I tried this recipe.  My whole family ate them up.  They are really yummy!  I left out the dry mustard; I didn't have any.

The best gingerbread waffle recipe I've tried so far.  Just enough molasses to make it great, but not overpowering.
We put bananas and whipped cream on top!
note: great with or without the raisins!
