I learned to make Pitiviers in a professional cooking course. I had to make the puff pastry from scratch. It was well worth the effort. However, Pepperidge Farm frozen puff pastry makes the whole job a lot easier and just as good. The important thing is that this is well worth any effort it takes to make it. It's a classic dessert that doesn't get as much attention as it should. I applaud Campbell's/Pepperidge Farm for offering this recipe to give it a wider following. You won't be sorry you tried it. Hint: one version I made included canned apricot halves that had sat in some Amaretto for a few minutes. It was well received by all who tried it. This is a good recipe for experimenting if you feel like it.

This was excellent!  I didn't trim into a circle but left as a rectangle and then cut into triangles.  It was really easy but looked like it wasn't!

I made this in culinary school today (almost exact same as a Jaques Torres recipe) - since I had puff pastry I made from scratch, I needed to find a use for it! I used almond meal/flour, so I got to skip the food processing part. I also skipped the orange zest since it wasn't in the recipe I used. Otherwise, this was the same, so I thought I'd hop on allrecipes.com and review and post a photo! It's really a fun dessert that is delish - I served it with vanilla creme anglaise and a pear that I cooked down in a simple syrup. Sounds fancy but it's really quite simple. :)
