This worked great on chicken and no doubt it will work as well on burgers, tacos, as a dip or on cream cheese with tortilla chips. The gentle amount of heat from the costeno amarillo chile peppers made for a smooth salsa.

Amazingly good. I used this on fajitas and enchiladas. I have no doubt it would be good on just about anything. Add a squeeze of lime for a refreshing kick. Thank you for the recipe.
