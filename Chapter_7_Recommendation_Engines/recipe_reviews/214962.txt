I made this recently for a Christmas Eve potluck and it was delish! I forgot my grocery list at home, so I improvised a bit. I also don't like vermouth, so I used a dry white wine (a cheap sauvignon blanc). I followed the directions up to using the phyllo dough. I used a sheet of puff pastry instead, and used toothpicks to hold the pastry together on top. After that, I used a quick spray of Pam on the top and sprinkled rosemary on it. Next time I make this, I will defnitely used the phyllo dough, as the puff pastry did not brown enough/get flaky enough for me. It's delicious! Give it a try! All of the ladies at the potluck asked for the recipe.

Hints: Puff pastry sheets cut the prep time dramatically!  You can sub the vermouth for wine or whatever floats your boat.

I keep meaning to take pictures so this recipe gets more popular.  It really is delicious.  If anybody takes a pic, please upload!

This was good! I could not get a shallot to save my life @ the grocery store, so I subbed green onion, which I thought worked out nicely. I am a lover of garlic, but I think if I make this again, I would cut back, as I thought it was a little too much. I wrapped mine in some crescent dough that needed to be used, perfect! I also had an issue cutting the top off while trying to leave a lip around the edge. Is there a trick to that, lol? I was able to make it work in the end, though. Thanks for sharing. :)

I modified this, but wanted to rate the combination of the savory ingredients with the Brie, which was excellent.  The shallot, garlic, white pepper, and sauvignon blanc (no vermouth) sauteed together and baked over the Brie was wonderful.  I used miniature phyllo pastry shells (baked on parchment paper unfilled for 5 minutes at 350), then put a small cube of Brie in each shell and topped the Brie cubes with small amounts of the sauteed shallot/garlic mixture, then baked at 300 for 4 minutes until the Brie melted.  These little tartlets were great!

Really good- I added a handful of chopped mushrooms and sauteed them with the shallot and garlic in a little olive oil before adding the vermouth and putting it on top of the brie.

Better and easier with puff pastry and walnut-studded mango chutney on top of the brie.  Wrap pastry up over top of brie and make a decoration on top with the folded up pastry.

Amazing. Everyone raved about this and asked for the recipe!  I used white wine instead of vermouth and puff pastry, not phyllo. Will definitely make this again!

The only tip I took from this recipe was....I did take the rind off the top prior to wrapping the brie. This makes an AMAZING difference!  The brie melts soooo much better. I made it w the traditional raspberry jam, but next time I will try this recipe to a tee. Thanks so much for the tip!

Aside from the phyllo being difficult to work with this is an easy recipe and a big hit. I used shallot and vermouth but I could see substituting a green onion and/or white wine. I cooked this on a flat stone so it was easy to slide onto a serving plate. Easily served a dozen guests.

Delicious and smelled intoxicating while it baked.  My husband and I loved it.  We went the phyllo sheet + brushing layers with butter route, so assembly did take a bit of work but the result was a very flaky shell.  We served it with granny smith apple slices.

So, after reading all the reviews.... I used puff pasrty and white wine. Since I was also making stuffed mushrooms, I added choped shroom stems. Absolutely delicious! Definetly a keeper! Also, I served it with a combo plate of crackers, apples and crostini.

I used puff pastry and it took about 45 minutes to puff up and brown. Very tasty recipe. Thanks
