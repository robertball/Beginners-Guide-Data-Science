A good recipe that I will use again. I only slightly modified the recipe to add ½ tsp of allspice instead of 1 tsp - I feel this added just the right amount but is not overpowering. I’ll be holding on to this recipe.

I made these yesterday for family and friends and they all loved them, especially the carrot cake lovers. I did alter the recipe to reduce the use of refined sugar. I replaced both the white and brown sugars  with 2 cups coconut palm sugar and 1 tablespoon molasses. No one guessed that I made these without using normal sugars. I will definitely make these again.

Used 1/2 the allspice amount as I used whole Jamaican allspice that I hand ground.  Also did not put the cinnamon in the frosting.  Delightful results :)
