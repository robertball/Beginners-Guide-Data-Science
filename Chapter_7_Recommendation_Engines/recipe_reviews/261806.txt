I followed this recipe EXACTLY, and the measurements are way off. There is not enough liquid in this recipe as written to even form a dough. I had to add a lot more molasses and some applesauce just to form a dough. The flavor is good, but be prepared to add more liquid into this recipe.

I love this recipe! I have used it the past 2 years to make gingerbread house cut outs for our holiday gingerbread house decorating tradition. I use tapioca flour instead of arrowroot, coconut sugar instead of brown sugar, and end up adding a touch of water to get the dough to come together better. I roll out the dough between parchment paper instead of flour. The flavor and texture are great. You can bake them on the short end for chewy cookies, or a bit longer for crunchy ones; both are delicious. The recipe doubles (triples, quadruples...) nicely. Glad I came across this one!!
