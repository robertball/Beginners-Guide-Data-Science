I had a couple hamburger buns and a small amount of chicken nuggets left in the bag that I wanted to use. This recipe was great because I got rid of both and my kids were happy. I used real cheese and added some italian seasoning to the sauce. I did do three nuggets on each bun, six just wouldn't fit on one bun. You kind of have to mush the sandwich together to get the nuggets to stick into the bread with the sauce, so it dosen't all goosh out the sides. (I had two kids to feed, anyhow.) My kids were overjoyed with this lunch. According to my oldest, I rock. And the little one made devil horns at me. Thanks for the idea, recipe submitter.

It's pretty good, actually. Also, if you don't have a hamburger bun, regular bread works as well. I'll eat it again. :)

I loved this idea, however, I changed things a bit to accommodate what I had on hand, and personal preference. I used a mini-sub roll, which allowed three nuggets to fit comfortably. While waiting for the nuggets to cook, I arranged a slice of deli cut provolone cheese on one half of the sub roll. I then placed the cooked nuggets on the cheese, topped with about 2 tablespoons of pasta sauce, topped with shredded mozzarella cheese and Italian seasoning. I then nuked everything for about 30 seconds, until the mozzarella had melted. It was the perfect snack/light dinner. Thanks for the inspiration.

Pretty good! I made these on slider buns. My only change next time would be to use mozzarella or provolone cheese instead of American. Thanks for sharing. :)

I used chicken patties instead of nuggets along with mozzarella slices. I had a can of sauce on hand. They were delicious!! Great concept. My kids loved them.

I had four leftover, skinless, boneless baked chicken breast pieces to use. So I put them in a small baking dish covered in some Ragu sauce. I then re-baked them at 400 for twenty minutes. I had a couple hoagy buns, put the soaked pieces in the buns and sprinkled with motz. Worked for me!

This was easy, cheap, and yummy.  My kids and husband all ate it and they said it was not bad which from my picky eaters is high praise! I used spaghetti sauce because that's what I had and it was terrific for an easy dinner/lunch.
