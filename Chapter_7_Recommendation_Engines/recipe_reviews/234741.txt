My go-to cornbread recipe. I cut the number of servings to 9 and use my 9 inch square cast iron pan, which I leave in the oven while it's pre-heating. When it's good and hot I drop in a couple of tablespoons of butter, swirl it around until it's all melted, and pour the batter in while it's still sizzling. Then it all goes back in the oven to bake. Gives a nice crispy buttery crust to the cornbread.

In my little 2-person house, we can't make such a large amount without waste, so I cut the recipe down to 1/3 (super easy!). Added some green chilis and baked it in my toaster oven. Hunny gave it rave reviews! ??

This cornbread was excellent. I made the cornbread in a large cast iron skillet and I loved the texture. I did add some red pepper for color.

YUM!!  Best cornbread recipe I've used in quite awhile.  I only made a smaller amount because there's only two of us.  It was very easy to reduce.  I did add just a bit more cornmeal and a tad less flour.  It was so moist!  Will definitely use this recipe again!

Top notch. I made 1/3 the recipe in a 6x8 pan and it was perfect. I did reduce the sugar to 3 tbs and added a large pinch of salt, just because I don't like my cornbread too sweet -- personal taste.  Next time I'll try making muffins out of it.

I would give this 3.5 stars so I'll round up because that's the polite thing to do. Texture was light, but a bit on the crumbly side. I was in the mood for a strong 'corn' flavor and this was too mild for me. Maybe it was the cornmeal? I'll give it another try with a different brand and update to see if that helps in the future.

Love this recipe!! I reduce the sugar slightly (by a 1/2 cup for the standard recipe), and throw in a couple of pinches of paprika and just under a cup of thawed frozen corn. Perfection.

I'm not a good cook (at all) and this is fool proof. I used my ground cornmeal from the corn mill at Cade's Cove in  Gatlinburg, Tn so I don't know if that made it taste better, but it was amazing!  I did leave out 1/4 cup oil and added 1/4 cup honey for a slightly sweeter cornbread. I also made a thinner batch in my cast iron pan and a thicker one (which came out more cake-like) in a dark pan.Both were great. It does make a lot, but it'll last a few days and I would rather have too much of this deliciousness than not enough.

cut it in half, which was more than enough, other than that no changes. I loved it, my new go to cornbread recipe. It held together, and tasted great.
