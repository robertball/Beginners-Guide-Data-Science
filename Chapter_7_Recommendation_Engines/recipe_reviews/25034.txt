This was an easy recipe. Because of it's richness I was able to stretch it further than the suggested serving. I did double the ingredients for the crust as I didn't feel it was enough to cover the bottom of a 9x13 baker. You will need to bake it a little longer though.

Pretty tasty! I used an 8"x8" pan and used the full amount called for the base. I used a pastry blender instead of a mixer to make the base crumbly. I didn't measure the chocolate chips, just sprinkled a liberal layer over the base just before the base was done cooking and then I put the pan back in the oven for a couple more minutes. The chocolate melted really quickly and was easy to spread. I did a half-batch for the topping, but I just used what I had of the noodles (about 1Â½ cups) and that was enough. If I'd used the full amount called for, 2 cups, it would have been even more difficult to mix them in. Make sure the topping is hot when you mix in the noodles or it gets REALLY hard to mix and spread over the chocolate. Also, these are a little tough to cut, so do what I did: Line your pan with foil, grease the foil, and then when they've cooled lift the bars out, peel the foil off, and cut them. It's much easier than trying to chop them up in the pan. Thanks, Sonya, for a different treat!

Ok, these taste not too bad, but the pb/noodle filling is less than desirable.  The marshmallow, peanut butter, brown sugar turned into a big blob so I had to add about 1/4 cup butter to smooth it out.  Adding the chow mein to this turned it into a complete mess.  I must have over cooked it cause now its rock hard and not very pleasant to eat.  The crust w/chocolate on the other hand turned out great.    Will never be making this again :(

I have followed the recipe, it came out bad. It wont spread out evenly. I will not use this recipe again. I am not very happy about it.

Followed the directions exactly as written.  Did not have a problem getting them out of the pan.  Easy to make, but not one of my favorites.  Everyone that tried them said they were wonderful.  But they just did not rate a 5 star with me.

I made 2 batches... the  first one was a mixed review like some of the criticisms already expressed , the second batch turned out great.   
The difference between the 2 batches was that the second time I made it, I melted the sugar and cream together until and all were dissolved and hot before adding the PB, mixed it in until melty and then added the- marshmallows last folding in until all melty again and then quickly added  chow mien noodles until there was enough to take up the slack and spread before it cooled. 
This worked  a lot better. 
  I think sometimes we take if for granted that others know all the baking methods and when one says do something altogether they do not realize that young bakers do not know what they are looking at and panic at the results they immediately see. 
I think the recipe is worth a go if you like really rich sweet stuff like kids do .  Personally I found that a tiny taste was all I could handle but the grandkids probably would eat the whole dish.   It is better eaten the first day or so. Used up my leftover noodles in any case.
