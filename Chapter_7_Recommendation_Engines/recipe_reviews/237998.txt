I just made this with a few changes to the recipe and it is really very good and easy to make.  I used the same amount of fresh figs and skipped soaking them, just cut them up, then added the sugar.  In place of the sour cream I used plain Greek yogurt (just to use up what I had).  I also added a few chopped up walnuts.  Very good!

We all love this ice cream! I followed the recipe mostly...I used the same amount of fresh figs and left it in the fridge overnight. Will make more for our 4th of July BBQ! Thank you!

This ice cream is a quite a treat! Not something you'd find outside of a gourmet ice cream parlor. I made some changes to this recipe. Instead of 2 cups dried figs I used 1 cup of dried figs and 1 cup of fig compote, which I just happened to pick up on a whim. When cooking them I omitted the sugar and lemon juice and substituted honey and 1tbs orange flower water. I only used 1 egg yolk for the custard, and like a previous reviewer suggested I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I also added 1/4 cup chopped pistachios. The only downside to this ice cream is the seeds if you're not used to eating figs.
