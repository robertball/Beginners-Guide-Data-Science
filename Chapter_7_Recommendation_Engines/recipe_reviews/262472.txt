The texture was good and overall good recipe.  These came out pretty good but I definitely recommend adding a little bit more sugar. I also added some chocolate chips at the end of mixing up the batter.

Taste good. I replaced the coconut sugar with granulated sugar and the cashew milk with almond milk. The only other change I would make is to make it a little sweeter.

These were fantastic.  I did use some substitutions, but followed the basic recipe.  I used almond milk instead of cashew and I used white sugar instead of coconut.  My picky kids loved them as a vehicle for some mini chocolate chips.
