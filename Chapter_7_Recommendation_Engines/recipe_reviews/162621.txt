The combination is good for Irish soda bread (molasses always gives it a kick) but 1 tbls. cream of tartar - no way.  Cream of tartar is drying and bread will be very crumbly.   Suggest 1 tsp. of baking powder be substituted.   I was weaned on Irish Soda bread both with and without molasses.    Hope someone trys this method.

Great taste!  Baking time needs to be increased to 30-35 mins!  I used both golden and seedless Thompson raisins. Because of the moisture, the amount of cream of tartar is correct, this was not crumbly.  The density and consistency were good!

This bread was amazing! It had a perfect sweetness and texture that I'm sure is characteristic of traditional soda bread. The crust reminded me of a pretzel. I made it with 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp. cream of tarter, ommitted the wheat bran and raisens because I was out, and made my own buttermilk with lowfat milk and vinegar. Everyone loved it, this will be a new St. Patrick's Day tradition in our family!

Easy Wonderful.  Have made it as per recipe and have added glazed fruit for a breakfast coffee cake. The banshee howled and clapped her hands.

Very easy and tasty. Out of necessity, I had to alter a few things. I was running low on whole wheat flour and molasses, so I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 2 cups all-purpose flour, and only two tablespoons of molasses. I decided not to add the raisins because I wanted a more savory bread, and for this reason I also added 3/4 tsp salt, as most soda bread recipes I've used before call for some salt. I'm not sure how much of a difference these changes made. I followed the recipe on everything else, including the tartar, using reconstituted powdered buttermilk instead of fresh, as this is what I keep in my fridge. What I loved about this bread was the texture and the almost nutty flavor that the bran lends it. It bakes into two small brown loaves that are crusty on the outside and just the right density inside. It feels much heartier and healthier than white Irish soda bread. I served it with butter alongside stewed lentils and a mixed green salad. Everyone loved it. It served three people with a little less than half a loaf left over. Highly recommended for when you want a hearty home cooked bread on short notice!
