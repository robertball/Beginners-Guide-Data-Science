Excellent. I will use it frequently. Fresh, tangy and perfect with food or in a sandwich.

I made this recipe, but substituted the apple cider vinegar with ice wine vinegar.  Delicious!  Tasted better the second day!

Very tasty but  I agree with other about the sugar.  Super easy to make with a bag of pre-cut slaw.  I halved the entire recipe but used about 1/4 the amount of sugar and added an extra splash of vinegar.

A bit tangy, from the cider vinegar the first time, second time less vinegar and more ranch! Great quick recipe!

A little too sweet for my taste, I'll add less sugar next time. Otherwise, simple and delicious.

I didn't notice the second column of ingredients,but didn't need them.  LOVED, LOVED, LOVED  mayo, ranch dressing , apple cider vinegarc and used 3 packs of Splenda instead of sugar.  Delicious on broccoli slaw.
