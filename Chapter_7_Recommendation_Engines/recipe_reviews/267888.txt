I have made it twice now.. first time it was pretty soggy but delicious. Second time I was much more vigilant in getting the tomatoes dry and took the suggestion of adding a little flour.  Wonderful and I highly recommend it!

As a classically trained Chef (retired) the only change was I made my own crust. I must say though the premade store crusts are quite good. Everything was spot on and my guests really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone. Very elegant. Less is more!

We were running out of mayonnaise, so I substituted with a spreadable cream cheese. I also used mostly fresh mozzarella, which may have added too much moisture.  Still tasted pretty good!

I made this tonight since I had an abundance of fresh garden tomatoes and it is so good! I didn't really measure anything...kind of "eyeballed" it...but it came out absolutely delicious! And I even used dried herbs instead of fresh! You could customize it to your taste (adding meat, spinach, onions or whatever) but it great "as is."
