Great base recipe - This wasn't my first brine so I went off the reservation and was rewarded with a great tasting turkey. I used fresh savory and sage in addition to thyme and rosemary (use what ever FRESH spices sound good), I omitted the all spice but maybe next time will try, added some fresh squeezed orange peal and all.  I marinated for 5 hours - have gone as much at 48 hours if you start with a frozen bird - 48 hours is great and you will be rewarded.  Remember, the brine has to be kept cold 34-38 degrees, so add ice if need be to maintain temp.

I boiled 1.5 cups coarse salt with about 8 bay leaves, 1 tablespoon each pepper corns, tyme and rosemary in only 1 quart  water (or 4 cups). Once salt dissolved I added another quart icy cold water and waited for water to cool before adding 15 lb turkey for 12 hours. Before putting in oven i stuffed 1 medium onion, 1 apple and 1 orange to turkey cavity and cooked breast side down. After only 4 hours the turkey fell apart before I could turn it breast side up -- next time  I will turn it over 2 hrs earlier instead -- was DELISH -- loved not having to use broth or cider in brine.

All of my guests enjoyed this recipe. Although simple, it works well. I used this brine for my thanksgiving turkey and smoked my bird for 3 hours at 200 degrees F, then covered it with foil and cooked for 3 more hours. I caught all the drippings in a pan on a rack under the bird and used them to baste the bird while cooking and for gravy after.

This is the first time using a brine. I can't believe how it turned out. The turkey was juicy and delicious. We didn't have any leftovers, none.  That has never happened before. I used pieces instead of a whole turkey. Thank you for the recipe.

I've never brined a turkey before but I think that I will use this brine recipe to brine my Christmas turkey this year just to see what the difference is between a non-brined and brined bird.
