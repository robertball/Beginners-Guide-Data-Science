Absolute, flat out perfection. My only criticism would be that using dried herbs would only detract from the sheer beauty and fresh flavor of this, so if at all possible, use fresh parsley, basil and oregano.  I made individual appetizer plates which couldn't have been prettier or tastier. Exquisite.

I took this to a party and they quickly disappeared. I cubed the cheese to fit on toothpicks and just treaded all the ingredients starting with the caper,then half of a cherry tomato, red pepper then cheese and spooned the pesto over it all. I did this hours in advance. Very pretty.

I made individual stacks instead of a platter, I used fresh basil leaves (left them whole & layered them in the stacks but next time I'll chop it) & I'm out of roasted red pepper so I used sliced banana pepper (loved the flavor & will make the sub again next time!).  I used Columela EVOO (the best, according to Cook's Illustrated) & I added just a bit of white balsamic vinegar. I garnished the stacks w/ chopped red onion, a whole banana pepper & huge caper berries. This is the best caprese salad I've ever had...thanks for the recipe, Gail!

I threw this together for a Christmas party I had and it was SO good.  It only took about 3 minutes to make and EVERYBODY thought it tasted delicious.  I will definately make this again- even for a light meal in the summer time. I had bought a jar of roasted red peppers but forgot to put them in and it STILL tasted excellent.  Great recipe!

Ok, so I changed this - I cut thin slices of a baguette and put the tomato on, then the mozerella and baked it in the oven at 350 until the cheese melted and then drizzled the ingredients over the top - I left out the red pepper - Everyone went wild over them!  They are delish!

Pretty to look at and easy to prepare. I did use fresh mozzarella and basil but dried parsley. Also fresh ground pepper is a must. This is something that would be best served during summer when fresh tomatoes are at their peak.

i think the mold monster got to my tomatoes prior to making this dish, but i couldn't swear to that because i was on some pretty jammin' pain killers.  i also did not use fresh herbs because i was not about to stumble into the backyard and chop up a bunch of plants.  even without the tomatoes, the cheese drizzled with the dried and bottled spices/olive oil concoction was divine.  i'm pretty sure anyway.  i ate it all and plan on making it again during a more lucid moment.  it paired beautifully with "belgian squirrel" (also from this site) and a dozen or so glasses of 1959 chianti wine.  thanx man for a groovy recipe.

I make this appy all the time, however, to make eating easier, I use mozarella balls instead of the slices. I normally just sprinkle the cheese and the peppers with Italian seasonings and drizzle evoo. I loved all of your additions; especially the capers (yum) and the fact the herbs were mixed with the oil. This made my "usual" absolutely incredible!! Thanks a heap Gail!

Amazingly good!  The herbed-oil mixture is what sets this apart from every other tomato/mozz appy out there.  I brought this to a BBQ with my in-laws yesterday and I've already been told not to show up for Thanksgiving without it.  LOL   

I layered all the ingredients on thin slices of bread.  I worried that the bread would get stale or soggy but it actually was great.  It not only gave you something to pick it by to eat it, but it soaked up the tasty oil and vinegar and was like you'd dipped bread in infused oil.  

I  doubled the oil recipe because I was making two trays.  I used fresh parsley and basil (I agree with everyone else that fresh herbs are a MUST for this) and followed another reviewers suggestion of subbing a little salt for the capers.  With 4 large cloves of garlic, it was a little garlic-y for my liking but everyone else at the party said they loved the strong garlic taste.  I would probably use 3 cloves next time.  I also omitted the red pepper (just forgot about it honestly but we never missed it) and drizzled balsalmic vinegar over everything after drizzing the oil.  

Very impressive presentation and excellent results.  A real keeper - thanks MOLSON7!!!

I wasn't a big fan of this, but I DID use all dry herbs instead of fresh, so that could have made a big difference. There just wasn't a lot of taste. I also left out the capers and served this with rosemary sourdough bread. All that being said, I brought this to a party and several people there commented on how much they liked it. Again, I think fresh herbs are key.

I love this recipe! I use all fresh herbs except oregano which I prefer in dried form. Next time I will drizzle with a little balsamic vinegar which I think will really add something.

This was great! As other reviewers, I used fresh ingredients to make it taste superior. I skipped on the red pepper and capers since I didn't have any on hand, and it was still fantastic! We eaten this type of appetizer when we go out and my husband thought it tasted the same. Easy to make and you can easily tweak it to your preferences!

I made this for a party and everyone loved it. This recipe is a nice variation on the classic caprese salad. the dressing was especially good. I also sprinkles some pine nuts and extra fresh parsley and basil over the top before serving.

Basic and good. I wanted to present this in a bowl, so I seeded the tomatoes before quartering them.  Came out great, and the peppers are a nice touch.  

I've added sliced cucumber (seed them first) and tarted it up with a squeeze of lemon.  That was good too.

This recipe was ridiculously good!!  I substituted fresh basil and oregano, and added a bit of salt to the herb mixture in lieu of the capers.  I also added a bit more salt on the tomatoes prior to placing the mozzarella, and garnished with chopped red onion as well.  It was fantastic!!

This went over REALLY well. Brought it to the MSU vs UofM game (Go State!) and one quote I received was "This is what they serve in heaven." I layered two slices of tomato in between two slices of mozzerella. I skipped the roasted red peppers as I didn't like the bitter taste of the jarred ones I bought. I also put a leave of fresh basil on top of the tomato before layering the second slice of mozzerella on top. Phenomenal.

Delicious!  I used yellow pear and cherry tomatoes from the garden with fresh herbs and I cubed the mozzerella.  I didn't have the jar of roasted red peppers but did add a touch of salt.  The way I put it together was more like a salad. Super good!

WE LOVED the flavors of this dish. We substituted cilantro for parsley, and we also added sun-dried tomatoes for a Mediterranean feel. After making this enjoyable dish, we realized salmon would be a great substitution for mozzarella.

It's amazing how delicious these taste for such little work.  I omitted the red pepper, used fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden, and added a combo of vinegars to the dressing with great results.  These taste good the day you make them but they taste heavenly the next day.

This makes a delicious salad or served on skewers.  The dressing really makes a difference.

My family loved this! I substituted sliced peperoncini peppers for the red bell peppers, and added a small amount of that vinegar to the dressing for some extra kick. Great presentation, and nice change from traditional mozzarella and tomato caprese.

Great idea! Added green olives and used fresh basil instead of dried, and half a red pepper instead of a jar of roasted reds. Everyone loved this! Thanks for sharing!

Amazing appetizer! I followed the recipe as written with the exception of doubling the oil mixture quantity and I stacked the cheese, tomatoes and red pepper on a baguette and drizzled with balsamic glaze and still sprinkled with the red pepper flakes. Everyone loved it and wanted more. This is definitely a keeper.

These were very good, but like some of the other reviewers, I also found that using fresh parsley, oregano, and basil worked best. I also didn't use the capers since I'm not a fan. I sprinkled a little kosher salt on each one and that really brought out the flavors. I stacked the ingredients on a crostini and served them at a recent family gathering. They were a big hit!

This was excellent.  I used fresh basil and didn't have any roasted red peppers.  It was devoured and had many compliments on how delicious it was.  I loved it too!!
