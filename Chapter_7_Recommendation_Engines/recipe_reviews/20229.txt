YUM! Like most people, I added a few things to this recipe. I added a can of corn and a can of diced tomatoes w/ green chiles to the meat. Seasoned the meat with cumin, garlic powder, and chili powder along with adding the taco seasoning. Also added 2 layers of enchilada sauce and 1 layer of sour cream. Added black olives to the top layer. Reduced the beans to one can, but might try 2 next time. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

Here is what I did- and its a keeper!  I sauteed onion with the ground beef.  Then added the taco mix, refried beans, one can rotel, and one can mexicorn.  Layered tortillas with meat mixture and cheese, and then baked.  Topped with onions, tomatoes, black olives, and avocado.  Served with sour cream and salsa on the side!  My family loved it!

Seems I'm no better than the rest. I aslo changed this one to meet my family's taste. I left out the beans. I added peperjack cheese to give it a little more spice. I baked it in a pie pan because the tortillas fit perfectly in it. I served it in wedges with lettuce, tomatoe, onions, and sour cream on top. The end result my family loved it. Thanks for a good idea.

I'm no different than most of everybody else who rated this, I changed up mine quite a bit.  I actually used a lot of your reviews to come up with my own version.  I browned my meat with some onion and about 5 cloves of chopped garlic (that was using restraint too!)added taco seasoning, small can of corn, 3/4 can of chopped tomatoes with green chilis would have added a can of green chilis alone but my 8 yr old wont do it. put tortillas on bottom of pan, added enchilada sauce on top, put a layer of meat mixture on then sliced mozzerella and shredded sharp cheddar and repeated with a final layer of cheese on top. It was really yummy and husband and child thought so too. 8yro had 3rds! Forgot to serve with sour cream and when we were done eating my hubby said it sure would have been good with some s.c. !! It isn't worthy of a 5 star rating though those are for exceptionally great dishes.

Ok I know you shouldn't make new dishes for guests, but I had to make this. It turned out so GOOD!!!! My husband and I can not wait to eat the leftovers.  I followed the recipe, but I added more ingredients:  I added slasa, black olives, canned diced tomatoes (instead of fresh), onions (instead of green onions), and mozerella cheese in addition to the cheddar.  I will be making this again :)

Good base recipe.  I decreased the beans to one can.  I also added a 1/4 cup layer of sour cream and 1/2 cup layer of picante sauce in the middle.  It quickly disappeared at a teacher luncheon.  Many came back for seconds.

This was easy and we enjoyed it.  I did make a few changes, didn't use refried beans at all, instead used a can of undrained black beans, a can of drained Rotel tomatoes, and about 5 roasted/chopped green chilis.  Also used 1/2 sharp cheddar and 1/2 pepper jack.

This was pretty good.  I did jazz it up a bit.  I added half of a chopped onion and about 3 cloves chopped garlic to my ground beef, then added the taco seasoning.  I also made a package of lipton's spanish rice and mixed it with the fresh tomatoes, then spread it over my ground beef/bean layers.  This was not spicy AT ALL.  I am not complaining, as I am cooking for a 20-month old, but I wanted to give people a heads up!

Excellent recipe, but a few suggestions to spice it up a little.  Choose the spicy taco seasoning mix along with a little Tabasco sauce, cumin, chili powder and oregano.

My company raved about this dish!!!

yummy! I love how the tortillas become noodle-like when baked (hence "lasagna"). This recipe's pretty versatile; I like to add jalapenos. Also, reheats well in the microwave.

Okay, but if you follow the recipe as is...too dry for us...could use more hamburger and if you add more stuff like others did, I'm sure it would be better...

Made just as is and LOVED it!  Great flavors!!  The one thing I did different was cooked in a round pie plate where tortillas fit perfectly.  Used 2 tortillas stacked on top of each other for each layer.

This was ok--nothing spectacular. I think there is a too-many-refried-beans ratio to the hamburger, and it makes it bland, no matter how many additional spices you add. I added a small can of chopped green chiles, oregano, chili powder, 1 cup of Pace picante sauce, and it was still a little mealy. If I try this again, I will add only one can of refried beans and try a can of Mexican-style tomatoes.

So, so easy and delicious. Like everyone else, I improvised with what I had on hand. I only had 1 can of beans so that was what I used, plus I added a few cloves of chopped garlic to the seasoned beef and bean mixture for flavour. I topped each beef layer with salsa and the resulting dish was both tasty and fun to prepare. I'll definitely make this again!

This is very easy to make, and delicious.  I've made it several times, and it's great exactly as is, or with custom modifications to spice it up.  Also excellet with corn and/or black beans added.  Overall, a very versatile dish!

We liked this a lot.  I cooked the meat with some diced onion and mixed it with the taco seasoning and beans and threw that in the fridge a couple days ahead of time to make prep easier on a work night.  Yummy!

Made this for dinner tonight to use up some leftover flour tortillas.  Hubby says its a keeper, and I agree.  I made it exactly as written, using "Taco Seasoning I" from this site, rather than packaged seasoning.  I also served some shredded iceberg lettuce mixed with fresh cilantro and some sour cream on the side.  One thing my husband suggested is that it might be better with corn tortillas..... so I might substitute those next time.

I added a package of cream cheese to the refried beans, used a can of Rotel instead of tomatoes, and I added a can of corn and diced jalapenos. This is now my boyfriend's favorite meal! He asks for it weekly. Thank you so much for the great recipe!

This is a great idea but I changed it quite a bit as per other reviews and my own taste. I added cream cheese to the ground beef/taco seasoning mixture which also had pan-fried garlic and onions in it (cream cheese idea is from the taco pasta shells recipe on this site) and I added corn and black beans - not refried beans. I layered a mixture of sour cream and salsa on tortillas and then my beef mixture and then shredded cheese - then tortillas, repeat 2x. Baked at 375 - 20 mins covered and 10 minutes uncovered. I add sour cream, green onions and minced jalapeno on top. Delicious and so filling!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because it came out DELISH but I did change it up a bit.  I browned my ground beef with a chopped onion & several cloves of garlic, added taco seasoning (I actually used Taco Seasoning I from this site that is awesome), 1/2 can petite diced tomoatoes, 1 can (drained) diced green chilis, 1/2 can refried beans, and 1/2 bag frozen mexican corn.  I browned my tortillas in a frying pan and then layered:  tortillas, beef/bean mixture, taco sauce & cheese....and then did one more layer of this.  Served it with diced fresh tomotoes, green onions, sour cream and shredded lettuce with a sideof yellow rice.  Adding this to my recipe box as it was seriously FABULOUS!!!

Use tomato paste instead of tomatoes. Also added black olives, salsa & onions. Seasoned ground beef with garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne & black pepper. I usually eat it with sour cream. Made this three or four times since I found the recipe. :) Amazingly perfect recipe. :) Thanks!

Such a quick and easy recipe.  I also followed some of the others ideas and added diced tomato and enchillada sauce.  I prepared this meal one day before I left for work with a note on how long to cook it for my boyfriend and son for dinner! So simple and great taste, Thank you!!

This was a great base recipe.  I made a few changes for our taste preferences.  I added and 8oz can of tomatoe sauce and 3/4 cup cooked rice to the beef mixture.  Also added some extra cheese.  Used salsa instead of the tomatoes and onions.  It was delicious!

I'd be interested in trying this again with other reviewer's changes and additions. As the recipe is written we found this a bit dry and mushy. The flavour was good though. Thanks for letting me try.

This was a great recipe! I had leftovers for a couple days and even guests that had the leftovers loved it. My boyfriend who's a picky eater totally loved it.

This recipe hits all the right areas. Tasty, filling, easy, quick and cheap. Family really enjoyed this dish and I was able to make it when I got home from work. Most likely will be requested in my house again =)

Very good and very easy to make.  I also cooked the beef with half a chopped onion and 5 cloves of garlic.  I reduced the beans to one can and added a can of diced tomatoes (undrained). For the cheese i used half pepperjack and half 3-cheese mexican blend because that is what i had.  This is surprisingly good for how simple it is! Will make again for sure!

Hubby gave this a 5, but I made some changes to the original recipe. I browned the beef with diced onions and garlic, and then mixed in the refried beans, salsa, and sliced black olives. This was great with sour cream on top.

This an easy and great recipe! I am far from a gourmet chef and my entire family loved this. I was getting compliments the entire evening. I added a little more taco seasoning to give it a kick myself. Also, I would suggest putting the last layer of cheese on 10-15 minutes before it's done, instead of the entire cooking time. Otherwise, a delicious alternative for dinner!

I loved this recipe, but I added some additional ingredients.  I added rotel tomatoes to the beef.  Then, I mixed the beans with some cream cheese (sour cream would be good as well).  It was so good!  I made 2 pans for a party and there was none left.

This was awesome!  I agree to add more beef to the bean/beef mixture... Hubby and I pick recipes to try out every Monday... this was my suggestion.  IT WAS SO GOOD, WE HAD TO MAKE IT AGAIN THIS WEEKEND FOR FAMILY!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!  PS: we also added some green chilis, black olives and a few Jalapeno to make it spicy!

This recipe was awesome!  My husband has been bugging me to make a tex-mex lasagna that I made him years ago.  I conveniently lost the recipe because it was so heavy and difficult to make.  This recipe was so easy and delicous I think he'll stop bugging me now!

I made this recipe for some friends and they really enjoyed it! I followed the recipe as is, but I also added onion. I think I would personally like it more with less refried beans and more cheese, but my friends said they wouldn't change a thing.

Tasty, even if the dish offends the Italians and the Mexicans simultaneously! Relies a little too heavily on taco seasoning, I recommend some sour cream on top.

Great recipe that appeals to the taste buds of the whole family.  I layered in enchilada sauce and a can of corn.  Next time I'm going to top with some tortilla chips to give it a crunch!  Happy eating.

A little dry, but with enough sour cream and salsa on top you couldn't tell. I browned some chopped onion and green pepper with my meat. I used my own seasonings and toped with salsa and sour cream. Used a 8x8 pan. Quick easy and failry cheap.

I made a version of this without even knowing! It turned out absolutely fabulous. I did sub the tortilla's with some leftover hard taco shells and tortilla chips.  I also used 3/4 of a jalapeno, chopped very fine and some Sriacha sauce for heat.  Everyone had seconds, it was so good!

This is a very cheap, easy recipe that is pretty tastey. I did make a few additions, though. I added salsa to the bean/beef mixture which added a lot of flavor and seemed to lighten up the filling. Also, two layers of tortilla was definitely not enough. There needs to be at least three or four layers.

This is a go to recipe for me.  It is really easy to make and tasty to boot.  My husband loves it too which is why I make it over and over again now.    I use a bit more than 1 pound of beef, I found that wasnt enough for us, I also add some Old El Paso enchilada sauce or chunky salsa if I do not have enough tomatoes.

This was soo good! With the refried beans I omitted the green onions and tomatoes and just added some salsa and sauteed onions/garlic. For a little spice I put in a dash or 2 of Tabasco, but the salsa really added enough spice. I used a 3 cheese mexican blend cheese, as well as adding some mozzarella just because I wanted more cheese! This was great reheated in the microwave for a few day after as well! LOVE the texture of the tortillas after cooking!

Extremely simple but soooo yummy. I only had mozzarella cheese, and I had to add some fresh cilantro on top when all was said and done! Served it up with lime wedges, lettuce and salsa verde.

Awesome, BASIC recipe....Add black olives, jalapenos to the layers and guacamole to the top after baking....Be creative and this recipe is a hit.  This recipe reminds me a a rue to a good soup...it is the base, build from it.

Only giving it four stars b/c I had to make a few modifications.  I seasoned the meat before frying it and tossed in some garlic and onions (white not green).  Then added 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning to the meat with only one can of refried beans and two cans of diced tomatoes with chiles.  I drained the juice from one can of diced tomatos but used the juice from the second can to loosen up the refried beans.  Side note: this meat mixture is absolutely delicious!  I almost ate this in a tortilla without bothering to finish the lasagna!  To layer my lasagna I did the following in 9x13 lasagna pan: 1. Tortilla, 2. Meat mix, 3. Enchilada sauce, 4. Cheese (mexican blend), 5. Tortilla, 6. Meat mix, 7. Enhilada sauce, 8. Cheese  Because of the juice from the tomatoes I could have skipped the enchilada sauce but it still added a good flavor.  Made the lasagna a little wet though.  Also, I ended up using 4 cups of cheese instead of the recommended 3.  Overall, WONDERFUL recipe.  Boyfriend said he could smell it cooking from the parking lot of our apartment complex and couldn't wait to come in and eat.  We have very different tastes in food but both of us give this recipe a thumbs up.

Okay, so yeah, I've become one of those people on this site that make major changes to a recipe and then make a review based on those changes even though it's much different than the original.  So be warned: not the original.    I don't like refried beans, never got into them.  Instead I used canned black beans (2 14oz), drained, rished and then mashed.  I mixed in about 1/3 cup of sour cream and set aside.  I didn't have any ground beef on hand so used ground turkey.  Instead of taco seasoning which is loaded with sodium, I just seasoned the meat myself with cumin, garlic, onion and coriander.  I also added one chopped sweet onion and 3 strips of cooked, crumbled bacon to the mix.  I used half a jar of salsa and then layered that with beans and tortillas and of course, added lots of Mexican blend cheese.  The result was fabulous!  I will definitely make this again and actually, except for all the cheese (2 cups), it turned out to be a very healthy dish.  Next time, I will follow the recipe when it comes to adding tomatoes, which I regret not doing because the salsa alone wasn't tomatoey enough for me.

I only had one tin of refried beans and tried to balance it out with a tin of chopped tomatoes. The tomatoes added a lovely flavour but if you're going to do this I recommend halving the taco seasoning mix or it will be far too salty without both tins of beans. Altogether a nice simple recipe, nothing special.

I was a little weery of this recipe as I thought it was going to be too basic, but I tried it as it seemed quick and easy....and it was GREAT! I did not add the green onions or tomatoes on top (personal preference) but I did add some minced onions to the ground beef while it was cooking. This recipe can be altered easily to individuals tastes and it won't cost $100 to go buy all the ingriedents!

I thought it was pretty good although the recipe calls for way to much refried beans. I reduced the amount to one and 1/2 cans but if I made again would only use 1 can. I also added sour cream, olives, taco sauce and lettuce on the sides. also I added some tortilla chips on the side it was good with all the changes.

I thought this was a great base recipe. I only use 1 can of beans and add black olives, green chilies and salsa in between the layers. Very tasty and easy to adjust to your own taste. Thanks for an easy family dinner!

Very good and hearty.  I used some leftover homemade chili con carne and added some black beans.  Also used some low fat cottage cheese in a middle layer.  Leftovers are already gone at lunchtime!

I made this one for a quick dinner and it was awesome.  So easy and a real crowd pleaser.  My one variation was to add two layers of tortilla chips for that chewy cheesey crunchy melty effect.

This is really yummy!  I Substituted Morningstar Farms burger crumbles for the ground beef (we're vegetarian).  I decreased the beans to one can. Used 1/2 red onion instead of green, 1/2 can diced tomato instead of fresh, some black olives, and 1/2 can green chilies.  Reduced amount of cheese (didn’t have enough on hand).  Turned out really tasty, although a little dry so I'll probably add sour cream or salsa as well next time.

This recipe is awesome but there are sometimes that I think it is kind of dry so we would use sour cream to help with that.  My husband and I decided to put a can on enchilada sause (your preference, hot or mild) It was SLAMMIN'! This recipe is supper easy, quick and very , very good and filling!!

As is, I had to rate this recipe 3 stars, but it could easily become 5!  As other reviewers stated, 2 cans of beans are entirely too much.  I decreased to only one.  Added some salsa, pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar, and deep fried the tortillas a little first to make them crisp.  Also put a layer of tortillas on the bottom for a crust.  Tasted more like a Mexican Pizza this way than a lasagna, but hey, it was darn good!

This dish is great.  My husband loves it and he is not a big fan of refried beans.  An option that i found to be a great plus was to use refried beans with sausage.

Easy to make and easy clean-up too, great concept, but not a fan of how it turned out strictly by recipe.  It was very dry, and with too much refried beans and tortillas. I will make this again, but will cut refried beans to one can, and layer separately from beef.  I will also add corn, layering the casserole as two full layers of beef, bean, corn, tortillas (two 6-inch for each layer) one of the three tomato bases above, and lastly cheese layer.  I also would add fresh cut yellow or white onion to top and cilantro for taste and garnish.

This was even better as leftovers.  I left out beans altogether, used corn tortillas (I personally think they have more flavor and prefer the texture over flour when they take up the moisture in the dish), added a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes to the beef as it cooked, more spices, added corn as some others did, and used a can of medium enchilada sauce in beef mixture and as I layered (first layer was sauce alone).

I made a mini in a 6 inch cake pan, thinking I needed the support, but after it was done, I could see all the layers stayed in place really well, so next time I will just assemble and bake and serve on something flat like an ovenable plate. I used 4 six inch tortillas which made 3 layers with 12 ounces of ground beef and chopped onion and garlic. No taco seasoning, so I used chili powder, cumin, red chili flakes, salt, pepper, and some water and tomato powder to make meat moist. I layered the meat with sliced tomato and queso cheese, topping with sliced tomato and cheese. It was delicious, and made 4 servings. Nice layering when cut, and you can cut it with a fork. Will most definetly make again!

I agree, good base recipe. I make this quite often, family favorite. When I make this I use 1 1/2 cups of salsa added to the meat along with the taco seasoning; add 3 tsps of Adobo as well.  I use the refried beans on one layer only, usually the middle one topped with pepper jack cheese, for this size I use 6 flour tortillas-medium size.  Black olives & sour cream are good topper along with slices of fresh avacados!

I have to say this is really good! Only thing I did different was I left out the green onion and I added a can of drained diced tomatoes to the bean mixture. And it was even better the next day!!!!

Made this for a family gathering this past weekend. I added a few spices per reviews and rotel tomatoes, along with cutting down the refried beans to one can. Although the flavor was good, the top layer with the cheese on it made it difficult to cut. I think it needs a little  of the meat mixture on top, or maybe some enchilada sauce underneath the top cheese layer so it's not to dry. With all the good reviews I was just a little disappointed in how it turnout. Not sure if I would make it again.

Great dish. I added some other touches as others recommended. I sautéed 1 small onion, 3 cloves of minced garlic, salt & pepper. As the meat was browning, I added onion powder, Goya All-Purpose Seasoning w/out pepper, cumin, 2 cilantro bullion cubes. I followed the directions on the taco seasoning package (mix 3/4 cup of water & taco seasoning). Instead of water, I used beef stock and 1 can of beans. I then added the chopped tomatoes and let it all simmer for about 5 min. I used bow tie pasta only because I didn't have any tortillas on hand. I layered the dish with the meat sauce on the pan, pasta, meat sauce, cheese. I repeated the layer 1 more time. I found there wasn't enough meat to cover it all. I would probably use 1 1/2 lb beef next time. It was delish!

We really did love this!  Here's how I made it:  I used a deep dish pizza pan instead of 9x13 and only used 3 whole wheat low carb tortilla shells and stacked them in layers.  To make the delicious inside, I sauteed the beef with an onion, drained it, then added only 1 can of refried beans, taco seasoning, 1 tsp cumin and 2 tsp garlic powder, a diced jalapeno pepper, 1 can corn, and about 6-8 ounces of the enchilada sauce (otherwise it was SO thick).  I spread a small layer of enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan after spraying it to coat the pan like you do with regular lasagna.  I toasted 3 10" tortilla shells.  Put one at the bottom (on top of the enchilada sauce), then spread 1/2 of the meat mixture, 1/2 of the cheese, then another tortilla shell with meat and remaining cheese and topped it off with the last tortilla shell.  I added another 1/2 cup of cheese then baked it for 40 minutes.  When I pulled it out, I added another 1/2 cup of cheese (we like cheese!) and then placed the chopped plum tomatoes and a small can of sliced olives on top.  Served it with sour cream and a few Fritos to dip up the gooeyness that oozed out the sides.  OH YUM!!!

This is very easy, quick and tasty.  Browned beef and drained and rinsed the fat from it while sautéing a diced onion and chopped garlic in olive oil.  Added the beef back in along with the taco seasoning, 1 can of refried beans and an undrained can of diced tomatoes.  Only had smaller tortillas, so tore them into large pieces to fit the 9x9 pan I was using for this.  Layered as I do regular lasagna, using with pepper jack and sharp cheddar cheeses for this.  Served with taco sauce, shredded lettuce, Greek yogurt (in place of sour cream), crushed Dorito chips, and hot sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

Most of the reviews here substaintially change this recipe by adding and changing almost everything. That must be the only way it get so many stars, because I made it exactly as the recipe specified and it was (at best) sort of like a microwave burrito cassarole.

This was awesome.  We wanted something new to eat instead of the same ol thing and boy o boy this was it.  I did however change one thing, I didn't have tortillas so, I use lasagna noodles.  Wonderful recipe.

overall pretty good. i used turkey meat instead and only one can of refried beans. i don't like flour tortillas when they are reheated because they get mushy so i used corn tortillas, which made the recipe. it was a pretty dry so next time i might add something to make it more wet. also added a can of corn to the mix along with 4 oz of cream cheese.

Whole family went back for seconds- tweaked by  cooking ground beef with onions and a pepper. Also added salsa between layers as someone mentioned recipe was a bit dry. Had leftover black beans in the fridge, so used those instead of refried. A keeper!

This recipe is great! I did some minor alterations based on some of the other reviews. I sauteed onion with my ground beef. I only used one can of refried beans (just because I couldn't possibly fit another can in), and added a drained can of corn.  I also used enchalada sauce as one of the layers per another reviewer. It turned out fantastic! We had some unexpected dinner guests- I was nervous making this for them since I've never tried it before but it was a hit! Everyone had seconds- some even took some tortilla chips & scooped this up with the chips. I added hot sauce to mine because it wasn't spicy enough for me, but I was cooking for two children under 3, so I was very happy it was so mild. Very good recipe!!

This is a great recipe!  Makes for a quick easy meal...prefect for a potluck too :) Based on the previous reviews I made a couple of changes:  1.  I used canned tomatoes with peppers instead of fresh roma tomatoes  2.  I added a can of mexicorn.

I tweaked this for preferences and to fit what I had on hand: used ground turkey instead of beef, only one can of beans. Added a can of diced tomatoes to the bean/meat mixture, and didn't use the onions or tomatoes on top.  Everyone in our family enjoyed this...which never happens!

I started out making a different recipe for mexican lasagna but after reading this recipe I realized I mmade this one...hey it's good still. Only exception is I added a layer of enchilada sauce on the bottom then added totillas then to the top before adding cheese. This was outa this world good and I am not even a huge fan of mexican or mexi style foods.

This recipe was delicious & very simple! I made it a little bit differently though. I substituted the roma tomatoes with a can of diced tomatoes & green chiles. I simmered the ground beef with Enchilada Sauce and used half the can of refried beans to spread it on the tortillas. I topped it off with sour cream like someone suggested and poured the Enchilada sauce (that I simmered the meat with)over the dish. My boyfriend & I absolutely loved it! =]

I started with this recipe as a base then ventured forth using reviews from this and other Mexican Lasagna recipes on this site.  Tortilla, refried beans, corn, taco meat, mexican blend cheese, enchilada sauce (unfortunately not the Tex-Mex enchilada sauce from here that's sooooo good), then repeat.  I made mine in a round pan, and would've added layers, breaking up the "stack" of filling but I ran out of depth really quickly.  Next time will use deeper pan and break down the layers.  This definitely needs some kicking up with green chilies or jalapenos.  It was a great base recipe and will keep this on my rotation.  

For plating, I laid down chopped lettuce, lasagna, sour cream, diced tomatoes, diced jalapenos.  See picture.

I made this last night and the kids begged me to add it to our monthly menu and make it again! This is a fantastic base recipe, and as most of the others I added a couple of extra ingredients to personalize it for our family. My kids made the suggestions to top it with crunched up tortilla chips next time..I think I'll try it..it's definately a crowd pleaser!

i do not understand how so many people can make so many changes to the basic recipe and still give it 5 stars!  it needed onion, garlic, cumin, green chilis amd chili powder, as others have stated, to make it taste, well...GOOD. so i give the basic recipe only 2 stars.

not bad at all. i browned my beef with the chopped onion (i only used half a spanish onion) and 3 cloves of minced garlic. it only took about 30 minutes to bake (the cheese was golden brown) and had a pretty good flavor. i forgot about the sour cream until my husband said it would be good with some! we used it and the flavor was much better. i will make it again on those days i dont want to make a gourmet meal.

Fantastic. I altered the recipe a bit per other peoples suggestions. Along with the beef I sauteed garlic and one whole yellow onion. I used one can of refried beans, used HOT taco seasoning, added a can of sliced black olives, a can of diced chiles, and some salsa to the layers. I used a Mexican cheese blend, and used two tortillas as the base layer of the casserole. The end result is delicious with some sour cream on top. I didn't even use the diced tomatoes because the salsa was enough. I highly reccommend this dish with the alterations!

This was good. I used salsa instead of tomatoes and onions (my kinds don't like them). I think it was good this way (I didn't think the 2 cans of beans were too much), but next time I would add sour cream when it comes out of the oven (or as people like it) and maybe some olives baked on top. Then some salsa. I think it really needs the sour cream, though.

This recipe was pretty good!  I only used one can of beans(with salsa), used corn tortillas and added a layer of diced canned tomatoes over the beef layer and my husband and I liked it very much.  You could easily spice it up with Rotel style tomatoes.

This was good and one that I will make again. However, I will add more beef and less beans along with some salsa.

I've changed this recipe a little. I use canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and I mix them with the meat and taco seasoning. I left out the onion. I added whole kernel corn to the mix.  I layer the mix, tortillas and cheese 3-4 times.  We don't do the sour cream or salsa.  Goes well with a box of Rice-a-Roni Spanish Rice!  We eat it with tortilla chips.

I thought it was ok. Since mostly everybody said there was not enough spice I added another taco seasoning packet. I added some hot sauce and I cooked the tortillas in oil before I put it in.

I used 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef, one can of "zesty salsa" refried beans and a can of Mexican style diced tomatoes. A huge hit with everyone, including my 2 and 3 year olds! Next time we'll try a 2nd can of "green chile" beans and some sour cream.

I took suggestions from each one and it came out delicious! I made enough for my firehouse which fed close to 16 people. in the meat sauce I added 2 cans of tomatoes with Chilies, chopped onion, cilantro and 2 cans of refried. layers I smeared a layer of sour cream and used Mexican cheese blend. Topped with olives, green onions, chopped tomato and cilantro. Very good and we had very little left!

I used ground turkey instead of beef and fat free refried beans.  We both loved it.  My husband wants to know when we can have it again.  Super easy to make.

Great base recipe.  I added a layer of enchilada/sauce mixed with sour cream, and a layer of Rotel tomatoes mixed with corn.  I also added green chiles to the ground beef/refried beans mix.  I only used one can of refried beans.  I think the ratio of one can refried beans to 16 ounces of beef was good.  My dish could have used more, though I think doubling the beans and beef would be a bit much.  Next time I will use less corn or omit it entirely.   And I'll look for ways to make it spicier.

The recipe as is isn't good. Like most people who reviewed this they added and changed things and Gave their version a good rating essentially. This version though calls for too much refried beans and too little beef for a 9 x 13 pan. You will get a very thin 2nd layer or 2 very thin layers in general. I love Mexican food and There are much better Mexican lasagna recipes on the site.

I know it's super-annoying when someone posts their review of a recipe but says they've modified it, so it's really not that recipe, but I swear, the only thing I changed was that I used small round tortilla CHIPS in place of the soft tortillas. I just didn't have any soft tortillas in the house, and I was too lazy to go get some. It was delicious. I'm sure it's delicious with the soft tortillas, too. My whole family loved it. It's a keeper, perfect for football-watching days.

Very good.  I simplified this by using canned diced tomatoes.  I added green chile and black olives.  I simply cooked the entire dish in the skillet tearing up the tortillas.  I used 1 can of refries.  I saw no reason to bake this and it came out tasty.

This dish made me so happy!  It was so good and completely satisfied my craving for some really good Mexican food (which is practically a constant with me).  I browned the flour tortillas in a hot, dry pan, and only used one can of re-fried beans like so many raters suggested.  I increased the ground beef to 1.5 pounds, and assembled the casserole in a deep dish (roughly the same circumference as a pie plate).  Oh, and I added a couple of layers of sour cream.  I topped the individual portions with chopped tomatoes and green onions, and I honestly had to talk myself out of getting a third helping - it was that good!  There are leftovers in the fridge right now and you can bet it's going down again tonight with a crisp green salad on the side.

I put it in the oven for 35 minutes and the cheese was browner than I'd hoped.  Next time I'll start with 15 minutes.

Delicious! Made the tweaks suggested by other reviewers: added green chiles and corn to the ground beef, and drizzled enchilada sauce over the meat and bean mixture.  Loved it!!!

I followed  CookinBug's suggestions and added a can of diced tomatoes w/ green chilies to the meat, along with the one can of refried beans (I actually only had one can of hand) and some corn (I only had frozen).  Also made GimmeSomeOven.com's Red Enchilada Sauce and added that to the layers too before putting the cheese on.  SOOOO delicious!  Husband and kids loved it.

This was a really good start! I added a can of corn and a can of tomatoes with chile peppers to the meat. I broiled it at the end to make the top bubbly.

I love this. This is the first time i tried it and i am absolutely going to do this again! It tastes great with sour cream and salsa! Taco sauce and avacados may make it better also! But definitely a great recipe!

I used the recipe as a guide, and I seasoned the beef with cumin, garlic powder, seasoned salt, pepper, chili powder, and picante sauce corn and black beans. This was absolutely delicious. My husband ate three helpings.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. I used to make enchilada's all the time for my family but when I found this recipe I was hooked. No more rolling tortilla's. I might make enchilada's again some day and I might not..Thanks for this recipe

This was easy and good! I made some changes like other people. Added corn, sauted onion with the meat, added cumin and garlic powder too. I used 1 can of beans. I also added some rotel to the meat mixture. My family enjoyed it. We served it with sour cream, guacamole and salsa.

I changed a couple things and that made it a little too spicy for the kids.  I used the left over taco meat that I had made for tacos the night before.  Was probably a little less than a pound.  Used 1 can of refried beans.  I added 1 can of black beans and 2 cups of corn, thawed.  Instead of fresh tomaotes I added Rotel- "tomatoes with lime and cilantro."  That was what made it spicy.  My husband and I liked it.  I didn't add the green onions.  As others recommended I used a different layering method.  First I put down 2-3 tortillas in the 9 x 13 pan.  Then a put a very small layer of sour cream on top (could still see the tortillas (it was very small amount).  Then I added the meat mix (meat, beans, corn, tomotoes) and then the cheese. Then started over- tortillas, sour cream, meat mix,and then cheese.  I added olives on the top.  Very good recipe, but I would use fresh tomatoes next time.

LOVED it!! I only had one can of refried beans, so I used regular beans too. I wasn't sure how the tortillas would taste in this (if they would be mushy and gross), but they were delicious.

Delicious!  I made a few changes though which I think really improved the dish.  First, we made our own taco seasoning to give the dish more flavor - my husband throws it together ;)  Second, I added a can of corn (which I highly recommend).  Third, I used spicy refried beans to give it a little kick.  Finally I topped with sour cream while eating.  Definitely a keeper!

Only used one can of beans and put a layer of tortillas on the bottom of the pan. Topped each slice with lettuce, salsa, pico, sour cream and jalapanenos. It was really really good. A new staple

This was such a hit with the 2 boys (30-something men really) that I live with that I just had to write a review!  I added half a large onion sliced pretty thin, garlic and cumin to the beef while browning.  I also added spicy chunky salsa as a layer and used corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas.  It didn't hold up very well but the top tortilla layer under the cheese was sooo good, a bit crunchy.  Also, I skipped the tomatoes on top and used a shredded cheddar/colby cheese mix.  I also added grated mozzarella on top.  The whole thing wasn't spicy but had great flavors.  My husband doused it with some Texas Pete for a bigger kick.

I thought the taste was really good, it came out a little dry, but overall it was a really good meal. We had it with sour cream and guacamole. My picky daughter and husband both liked it. I did add some easy to make spanish rice into the beans and beef and i thought that was really good.

Other than the "traditional" Italian lasagna, this is arguably the best non-traditional Italian lasagna recipe! My vegetarian roommate even said the smell made her want to eat it!

This was pretty good but I had to make some substitutions since I was missing some ingredients. I cooked the meat with chopped onion & garlic for extra flavor before adding taco seasoning and 1 can of refried black beans. I also used corn tortillas which add more flavor and don't get soggy like flour tortillas, along with a sparse layer of corn. Since I was out of salsa I added taco seasoning to a can of tomato sauce and poured it over the meat/bean layers which were a bit dry. I also used tasteless reduced fat cheese which I WON'T do again- ugh! After baking I "frosted" the top of each serving with lowfat sour cream, avocado slices, black olives, chopped tomato and green onion. I will make this again using REAL CHEESE, spicy beans and salsa over the layers for more flavor and moisture.

yummy!  I made it exactly as the recipe was written, except I didn't have any Roma tomatoes, so I used canned petite diced tomatoes.  I found that you only need to bake it for about 15-20 minutes.  Very good taste and very kid friendly.

I gave this a four because I changed it up quite a bit.  I cooked my hamurger meat with the taco seasoning, garlic, onion, and jalapeno.  I layered tortillas on the bottom, then 1 can refried beans, hamburger meat, tomatoes, black beans, chesse, then more tortillas.  I baked it covered for 30 minutes then added cheese on top and baked uncovered for 10.  I then added tomato and green onion.  It was pretty good, but more "liquidy" than I hoped for.  It worked great with mexican rice and chips though!

I gave it four stars as is but after our changes it was a 5 star recipe. We used three kids of beans, refried, black and pinto and also added olives. We tripled it and froze two pans of it. It reheated well after being frozen for a month.

This tastes pretty good. I only used 1 can of beans and I also added a small can of green chilies. I used the Taco Seasoning I from this site for the taco season mix and it has a ton of flavor. My only complaint is that the top needs some sort of sauce because the cheese on top of tortilla created a really hard crust which was really hard to get through. I didn't think of it at the time but I should have. Although the top did taste like a yummy cheese crisp.

This is a wonderful, easy mexican dish!  I like to try recipes "as written" when I make them for the first time, unfortunately I didn't have any tomatoes for topping, so I had to use the only thing I had - diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I added this to the meat mixture instead of pouring on the top.  This was the only change I made.  My family loved this recipe and it will become one of our regulars.

This was great. I made it for my family, my husband and son and they loved it. Next time I will add something else into it so it will give it more substance. I will make it again!

Very good base recipe. After reading many of the other reviews, I added about 1/2 cup of salsa and one can of diced tomatoes to the beef mixture, as well as about a cup of frozen corn. Then I was afraid it would be too juicy, so I simmered for about 20 minutes to reduce the moisture. Stirred in one can of refried beans. This is a great idea, the beans just dissolve into the mixture and thicken it up. A good way to sneak beans into the diet of my picky kids.

Great basic recipe! It's really tasty but I think next time I will add something more to it.

Great!  The kids even love it.  I use FF refried beans, 2% cheese, and whole wheat tortillas to make it a bit healthier.  Ground turkey also works but does look as appealing.  Add some light sour cream on top and it's really good!

Great base recipe!  I used only one can of (spicy) refried beans, diced onions, and petite diced tomatoes, because that's what I had on hand.  Used all the spices we normally use for tacos, rather than a seasoning mix. Also added some minced garlic, a can of corn, a layer of sour cream, and another layer of tortillas on the bottom of the dish.  Will definitely make again!

I added garlic powder and pepper to the hamburger as well, reduced the beans to one can, added in tomatoes, onions, green chili's, and a little tobasco to the meat. Only ended up baking it till the cheese melted, about 10-15 minutes so it wouldn't be too dry. 

Also the meat mixture itself makes for very tasty burritos.

I made a vegetarian version of this for a potluck lunch, and five people asked for the recipe!  I chopped onions and bell peppers and sauteed them, and used that in place of the ground beef.  I sprayed the (glass) pan with non-stick spray, just in case, and that worked out well because I had to microwave it one quarter at a time, because the pan wouldn't fit!  I also didn't realize the onions and tomatoes should have gone on AFTER cooking, so I cooked it with them on top.  Wasn't as pretty, maybe, but it was still tasty.  I made sure to get vegetarian refried beans and tortillas with no lard.  Making it at home, I would have to add more spices because I like a kick, but everyone at work loved it!

This was a very simple but tasty recipe.  I followed the directions as written except I only used one can of beans and we thought that was plenty.  We also added some diced jalapenos in with the cheese layers.  Yum!  Per the suggestion in another review - I put a layer of the tortillas down first on the bottom of the pan which I think probably made for easier scooping out and clean up afterwards.

The flavor here was very good, but it seemed to be missing some substance.  Maybe an extra layer of tortilla shells, or even some rice would of made it more filling. I will try again with some alterations, or at least with a side dish next time.

This recipe is really simple and tastes great! I change up the recipe when I make it, though. I use salsa instead of diced tomatoes and I put an extra layer of tortillas on the bottom to help it come out of the pan easier. I've also made this recipe with chicken; it's still good, but beef is still my favorite!

This is a great basic recipe, very quick and easy for when you don't feel like putting a lot of effort into dinner. I did brown the meat with 1/2 and onion and some garlic, only used 1 can of beans, and mixed the tomatoes in with the beans/meat to give a little more moisture. Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good! I used the Taco Seasoning I from this site, salsa instead of tomatoes and onions, cut the beans down, and used 1 1/2 lbs. of ground beef.  Served with the Sweet Corn Tomalito from this site.  YUM!  Thanks for the recipe :)

This is so easy & delicious.  I added my own ingredient of Owen's "HOT" Sausage.  It gave it an extra kick & I recieved raves from everyone who ate it.
