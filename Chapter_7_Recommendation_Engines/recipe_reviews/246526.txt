Who would have guessed  something so simple would taste so good?!   I worried a little about the all of the onion and peppers, but all cooked down so nicely.  Served over rice, and that absorbed the broth nicely.  I also added an Anaheim pepper I needed to use.  So pleasantly surprised with the outcome!
