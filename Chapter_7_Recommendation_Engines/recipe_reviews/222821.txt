I used tuna steaks for this and it turned out great!  I made extra sauce (3Tbsp teriyaki & 3/4tsp ginger for 2 steaks).  I didn't have the frozen stir fry veggies, so I julienned broccoli stems, carrots and yellow pepper, and steamed them for several minutes before assembling foil packets.  We had company over and everyone raved over these! Serve with some rice, what an easy and delicious meal.  I will definitely make these again!

Great foil dinner while camping!  Used the Swordfish steaks, frozen mixed vegetables, pineapple and teriyaki sauce.  Never thought to use fish in a foil dinner but it worked.

Maybe it was that I used frozen tuna (fresh is difficult to find in Nebraska), but it was very dry and extremely tough. Didn't care for the marinade on the vegetables, either.

I thought this was a great concept.  I make something similar, but with a Mediterranean flavor (flounder or tilapia baked in packets with kalamata olives, olive oil, sliced tomatoes, sliced lemons, herbs, feta,  etc.) and it always comes out tender and flavorful.  The tuna packets were not as successful.  I omitted the pineapple chunks, as my family simply don't care for baked pineapple) and I used fresh veggies (carrot matchsticks, sliced sugar snaps, mushrooms).  The teriyaki marinade made everything taste good, but the texture of the tuna (baked/steamed) was not to our liking.  It emerged tougher and drier on the inside than we like -- in fact, it was rubbery. I used beautiful, fresh tuna steaks, so I'm thinking tuna is not a fish that lends itself to this mode of cooking.  Perhaps, as with my Plaki recipe, a thiner, more delicate fish would work better.  And of course, in that case, reduce the baking time and use a slightly cooler oven.

easy to make and didn't dry out but wasn't flavorful enough for my family even though I doubled the teriyaki/ginger sauce.

I followed this recipe to the letter EXCEPT for the frozen veggies (I used fresh, julienned veggies). I'm a pretty good cook, so I know my seasonings were right...but, this came out so bland! I was very disappointed. 

I might try it again only because I love the concept and I love seafood of any kind, but I will certainly jazz it up to get more flavor.

Very tasty.  Be careful not to overdo the tuna.
