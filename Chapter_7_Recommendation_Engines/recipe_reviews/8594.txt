I cooked this recipe tonight and wanted to post right away before I forgot something. I cannot imagine cooking this the way it is BUT I will say that it is a very good base recipe to "create your own" casserole. To cut back on time I took some chicken that was already cooked and cooked it in butter with some chopped garlic, onion, pimentos (would have used red bell pepper but did not have it) and mushrooms. I set that aside and mixed 2 cans of cream of chicken with 1 cup of sour cream and about half a cup of milk to thin it up some. I mixed a ton of seasonings in this (garlic salt, onion powder, Ms. Dash, thyme, pepper). I then mixed a large can of mixed vegetables, a can of peas, a can of green beans, and a can of corn into the chicken mixture. Then I combined the soup mixture into the vegetable mixture and added some sharp cheddar cheese. I did as others suggested and mixed melted butter into the crackers before spreading them on top.With all of the additions this is a lot like a quick chicken pot pie without the crust. Fun to jazz up and a good way to get the kids to eat veggies.

I have made this recipe many times and my family loves it.  The only thing I suggest is that you melt a stick of margarine and mix with crushed Ritz crackers before spreading them on top.  Delicious served with rice.

I took everyone's suggestions and added half a can of milk to the soup, sauteed the onion and red pepper (added for color and flavor), sprinkled cheddar on top of the ritz crackers (which I also mixed with melted margerine as suggested). Sprinkled top with black pepper and garlic powder too. Served over Orzo and HUGE HIT here.

YUMMY!  one of my husband's favorites - my mom's been making this for years.  

We boil chicken breasts in water with sliced onions and 2 chicken bullion cubes.  

**Use chicken with skin-on and bone in then cool the chicken, remove skin, and debone in bite-sized pieces.  take 1/4 cup of the broth made by boiling the chicken and add to the sour cream/soup mixture.

this adds prep time, but the taste is noticeably better!

Man this was great!  Instead of boiling the chicken, I simply pan-fried the cubes until they were no longer pink.  Just a preference I guess.  Based on a suggestion, I served over noodles for added texture and included peas to the mix as well.  The smell of the cracker topping baking in the oven gave the kitchen a buttery smell.  My wife and I could not wait to dig in and we were not disappointed when we did!

This casserole is a family favorite.  I do not use onion or mushrooms, and I mix the cracker crumbs with a stick of butter. Also, I sprinkle poppy seeds liberally on top.  I have tried this with low fat cream of chicken soup without a change in taste, but using fat free sour cream made it noticeably bland.  I usually use about 12 oz. of either regular or reduced fat sour cream. My picky toddler loves this!

Between the 4 of us, this got 8 thumbs up!! This sauce is so, so, so good. I used chicken tenderloins, 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and fat free sour cream. I sauted the onions before adding just to soften them up. We do not use buttery crackers due to the hydrogenated oils, so I used crushed multi-grain crackers and sprayed them with fat free butter spray. We ALL wanted the extra sauce. There was NOTHING left. Thanks for this very simple recipe. I know I'll be making this a lot.

I am in a college house of four girls.  All of my roomates really liked this recipe with the added garlic salt and 1/4cup of milk.  I will definately fix it again.  I think that in order to fill a 9x13 (and feed 4 people)  everything needs to be scaled up.  I will probably fix a double and hope for leftovers.

This was really quick and really easy.  I added mixed veggies to give it some color.  My kids aren't big on onions, so I omitted those.  It was really really bland though, and pretty dry.  If I made it again, I would definately spice it up, and either use double portions of the soup and sour cream, or add milk.

This was such a good recipe, but I did take the advice of others and added my own touch. Since I was adding a bunch of extra things, I used 2 cans of the cream of chicken soup instead of 1. First, I cut the chicken up into pieces, then cooked it in a pan with butter, Mixed-Up Salt, and Hungarian Paprika.  When the chicken was pretty much done, I threw in an entire container of sliced up mushrooms (probably a cup or so) and covered it so that the mushrooms cooked faster. At the same time the chicken/mushrooms were cooking, I made a half pound of medium sized pasta.  Once I strained the pasta, I stirred it in with the chicken and mushrooms. I dumped this into the bottom of the pan.  In a separate bowl, I mixed together the 2 cans of creamed soup, half cup sour cream, splash of milk, and 1 bag of frozen mixed vegetables (that I had cooked according to the bag before mixing in).  After mixing together, I spread this over the chicken mixture already in the pan. I then topped with 1 cup Cheddar cheese and crushed crackers (that I added the melted butter to). I then sprinkled Mixed-Up Salt and Hungarian Paprika over the top before covering to bake. I had made this just for me to try a casserole and it made a LOT, so I asked a bunch of people to take some... 7 of us ended up eating it (with a little leftover) and everyone RAVED about it!!  Definitely easy and worth making!

I tried it just like you recommended perfect. Big hit with the family. 
Who are these narcissists that need to try to improve on everything? Let it go people. If you are skilled in the kitchen, you can figure it out.  No reason to insult the original  recipe submitter.with your "accidental" discoveries on how to make it better.ill bet if I put a recipe for peanut butter and crackers that Simeone would post a " better" way to achieve culinary excellence.   Thank you, Lynn

I've made this recipe for a long time but I add 1 cup uncooked instant rice and use about 1 cup of broth from where I boiled my chicken. Plus, I drizzle melted butter over the crackers.

This was a good base for a wonderful meal. I added pasta. I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom soup.  I added 1 tsp. garlic salt, mushrooms, 1/3 cup milk, the onion and the soups with the cooked pasta...tossed it all together and then topped with the crackers mixed with melted butter.  Took it out after 15 minutes of baking, topped it with lots of cheddar cheese and finished baking for another 15 minutes.  GREAT

my 8 yr. old didn't care for this one. My husband and I enjoyed it however. I used sour cream with chives to spice it up. It almost tasted like a chicken alfredo dishl. My husband usually thinks my cooking is bland, but he LOVED this one. When I make it again, I'll serve with noodles for a little more texture!

This is an awesome recipe. I did a little bit of changing. Instead of crackers I used French Fried Onions on the top and put in a little garlic. Also, after it was done. I put it on top of some egg noodles. It was great.

This is a good base for a chicken casserole but try this-add 2 more boneless chicken breast, one more can of cream of chicken(or mushroom) soup, 2 small or one large container of sour cream.  After topping with crumbled crackers, shake on a generous plenty of poppy seeds and dot liberally with butter. This is my standard give-away casserole when one is needed and I am always asked for the recipe.

This was a hit with my family - because I baked it with pasta and spiced it up! Which is why I didn't give it 5 stars - very bland as written.
I modified it with several suggestions from others:
In a little bit of oil, I sauteed the chicken pieces with chopped peppers (seeds and membranes removed = not real hot) and onions. While that is cooking, I boiled pasta and in the last 5 minutes added fresh broccoli to the pasta. Saved 1/2 cup of water and drained remaining pasta broccoli. Pour pasta broccoli in casserole.
Chop another 3/4 cups onions, mixed in with soup, pasta water and sour cream, toss in sauteed chicken with all the goodies from the pan, mix, then pour over pasta broccoli.
I topped with crumbled Whole Wheat Garlic Herb crackers and Romano-Parmesian cheese. Bake as directed.  Served with Spinach Apple Salad in Raspberry Vinagrette.... YUMMMMM!!!!!

I really liked this recipe and, even though I made some changes, I think this recipe will be good the way it is written.  I didn't have canned mushroom soup, so I sauteed onion and 2 cans mushrooms, which I chopped finely, in a tbsp canola oil.  Then I added 5Tbsp. butter and 5Tbsp. flour to make a roux.  After cooking it for a minute, I slowly added 2 cups whole milk, while stirring slowly.  
Meanwhile, I sauteed five chicken breasts (bonelees skinless) which I had seasoned with salt, pepper, poultry seasoning and onion powder.  I chopped them into chunks after they were fully cooked.  I then added this to the milk mushroom mixture and took it off the heat.  I added 1 cup sour cream and a couple handfuls of frozed peas.  I stirred them in and let sit for a minute before serving.  
It was very good on brown rice and on whole wheat sourdough toast! Yum!  (Because of time restraints, I didn't heat it through in the oven, which would have been good with the crackers....)  :)

This was a good basic recipe, but lacked flavor. I sauteed onion, celery and carrots, then added it to the mixture along with a can of mushrooms (no fresh on hand). Skipped the cracker topping, since I didn't have those on hand either, so maybe flavor could be enhanced there. Served over rice. Will have to play around with boosting flavor if I make this again.

Loved this, and just changed a little - had 1/2 jar Alfredo sauce in the fridge which I added, and a little more spice - garlic powder, and Mrs. Dash; then I went by the picture - instead of just baking this as a chicken dish, I cooked some pasta, mixed the two together, mixed the crackers & butter with some grated 5-mix cheese as a topping, and baked.  Yummy!!!!!

This was good and tasty. I'm not too excited to review it. It was good but not great. Something about it just needed something extra...something more. It just was not very exciting.

I made this pretty much according to the recipe.  The only difference I made was adding extra onion to this and seasoning the chicken with cayenne, onion powder, salt and pepper.  I also sprinkled some shredded cheddar over the top.  This was a hit at my house, even my pickiest eater enjoyed this! :D Thanx for the quick and easiest recipe.

My husband loves this dish. I make it atleast once a week. It's delicious. I use two cans of cream of chicken, one cup of sour cream and I soak the crackers in butter before putting over the top. I also started buying the Perdue chicken that is already cooked and cut up (Perdue smart cuts I think its called?).. cuts cooking time in half! Love this recipe!

This recipe was great with several additions. I cooked 4 chicken breasts in the oven for 40 min (frozen) with olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. With the chicken baking I boiled 16 oz of spiral noodles, rinsed in cool water and set aside. I cooked up a bag of frozen mixed veggies with butter and salt, and added a container of fresh, sliced mushrooms. Once veggies were cooked, I drained and added to spiral pasta. I also mixed 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 2 16 oz containers of sour cream. I cut up the chicken pieces,then mixed everything together in a large bowl. I poured it in a huge oven friendly fry pan and topped with one sleeve of butter/garlic crackers-crushed with melted butter (approx 1 stick) and baked at 350 for 30 min. The resulting meal was delicious and it lasted for several days-great for taking to work for lunch.

Adding mixed veggies to this recipe is a good way to change it up a little. I also like to change the topping. I take 1 can of chicken broth and mix that with a box of stuffing mix, before covering the dish. Also, in addition to the cream of chicken soup and sour cream, I add cream of mushroom soup.

I have made this recipe many times, and it is a family favorite!  We call it Ritzy chicken.  The original recipe that I got from a different source called for a stick of melted butter to be added to the round crackers.  Half a stick works just as well, but it really adds to the yumminess of the crackers on top. Also, for a healthier variation, you can substitute Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and then use light soup.  I have done this and don't taste a difference.  Happy baking! :)

A friend recommended this recipe to me but I never made it because it sounded bland.  After seeing it here and reading the reviews, I gave it a try.  It was OK, but as bland as I thought it would be.  However, when reheating some leftovers, I added some salsa.  That was exactly what was missing!  I made this casserole again.  This time I left out the onion and mushrooms and I added 2 cups of Picante Sauce.  I will make this again.  Easy and Yummy.

Anyone who is trying to eat healthy be sure to check the nutritional facts before deciding if you want to make this recipe a staple. This is high in fat, sodium, and cholesterol.  It might be considered tasty, quick, and easy but the price is too high when it comes to the health of your family.

Absolutely delish! I was in a hurry and Googled "easy chicken breast recipes." I spent awhile thumbing through them, then found this. I didn't even bother reading the reviews (I read them just now before writing this) because of the time limit and I'm glad about that because I would've added milk and sautéed the onions, which wasn't necessary after all! I didn't have the cream of chicken soup, so I improvised and used cream of mushroom. I used a little more chicken, because I have a big family, so once I mixed it all up I realized that it needed another can of soup. I also used a little bit more sour cream, just because but I think that wasn't really necessary either. I use garlic in just about everything I cook - for both taste and health benefits - so I threw in some minced garlic too. When the cooking time was done, I did feel that the crackers were too lightly colored and not crispy enough so I sprayed some butter flavored cooking spray on it and left it uncovered in the oven for an additional five minutes, or so. Mixing it with butter beforehand is both too time consuming and not as healthy. In any case that was perfect because it came out golden brown and crunchy. Man that thing was yummy! I did find however that there was a reason for it to be less creamy and all the advice given in the reviews about adding milk or whatever, really isn't necessary. It would make it too creamy and the consistency would then make it require something else like noodles, or as one reviewer

This is an excellent base recipe that you can add just about anything to. I cooked the chicken in some olive oil with green onions and garlic. I pretty much copied what MISTYDTHOMAS did in her rating and it was delicious! I added broccoli and mushrooms to mine. I added some garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and some pepper to the soup and sour cream mixture. This is a fabulous and easy recipe that I intend on making again! Plus you can always change it up and add new things!

This recipe was a hit for us. I followed others and made a few tweaks by adding a can of mixed vegetable with potato as well as 1 cup farfalle pasta which I pre-cooked in the chicken stock. I also sauteed 1 chopped, medium onion, and a small can of mushrooms. I added the chicken while sauteeing to finish cooking it.

The photo with the recipe definitely has more than what the recipe calls for, but it got my creative streak tweaked.

I have an EXTREMELY picky husband, and he liked this!! He suggested that next time, I grill the chicken breasts instead of boiling them, and use less sour cream.  Other than that he liked it.

I thought this was great!! All three of my picky boys LOVED it.  I did not have cream of chicken so I used cream of mushroom. I sauted onion and canned mushrooms together, then put in the chicken and cooked until done, and with the sour cream and soup I also mixed in about 1 and a 1/2 cups of shredded cheese, I spooned it over the chicken and spread it around a little bit, put on the ritz crackers and yum,yum. And the best part, EASY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Awesome!! I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 16 oz package of both peas/carrots and corn, and 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup. I will definitely make it again. A great base casserole to play with.

The key to this recipe is garlic salt. Add several pinches and mix--repeat until you can actually taste it in the mixture before baking. It makes a huge difference--I can see why people would say this was bland without the seasoning.

I sauted the onion in a little margarine before I added it.  I also added about 1/2 cup milk to the soup mixture to make it a little thinner.  Overall, this recipe was quick and easy and my family enjoyed it.

I needed something fast and easy tonight for dinner and this fit the bill!  The only thing I did was add some broccoli to it for color so I didn't have to have any sides.  We ate every last bite and I'm pretty sure this will be asked for again!

I have used this recipe many times, with the following additions: 1 tablespoon of poppy seeds added to the cracker crumbs, a can of cream of celery soup to make more sauce, and  thyme and garlic power to the chicken for additional flavor.  My family loves it served over brown rice.

I try not to change a recipe and then review it, but as nearly everyone else has suggested, this is a good start but needs some revisions. With the revisions, I would give it a 5 for an easy, quick casserole.  Like several others, I sauteed sliced mushrooms to which I added flour and milk to turn what would have been a basic roux into a mushroom sauce. I also added cheddar cheese to make it a cheesy mushroom sauce.  I prefer that to canned soups to: 1. avoid the BPA in cans; 3. avoid the high sodium level in canned soups, 2. use fresh ingredients for flavor, and 3. save nearly the entire cost of the canned soup. Even if I factor in the value of my few minutes that it takes to make a white sauce, the result is nearly free.  I also replaced the Ritz crackers with bread crumbs mixed with a little butter and Parmesan cheese.  I sauteed the chicken rather than boiling it, which I strongly prefer with white meat, and I added frozen peas. I also added a bit of sherry and paprika to jazz up the flavor that some had referred to as "bland" without some changes.  All of these changes took only a few extra minutes, yet the result was a fantastic yet easy recipe with interesting, somewhat complex flavors.  Thanks to the other reviewers for the changes that I stole from you!

I added garlic powder,could have used garlic salt as well. we doctored it after it was made with it and its was a lot better. I thought it was ok, my husband and daughter liked it... I might make again and adjust it some more...I also added milk and chicken broth and broccoli.

This is a great recipe.  Very tasty and I made it just the way it said except I cooked the chicken in a skillet with a little butter, salt, pepper, garlic and the onion called for in the recipe.  Served over pasta it was wonderful!  I think it will re heat well too.

This was a very good (and so easy) recipe to make!  I did change a couple things.  I used Cream of Chicken soup instead of Cream of Mushroom, added frozen mixed vegetables, along with french-fried onions (for flavor and crunch!).  Also used the french-fried onions on top (instead of crackers).

My family thought this was very tasty.  I really only changed one thing, instead of boiling the chicken, I cut it up raw and cooked it in a skillet.  Not a big change.  Very easy.  I served it over white rice.

This was okay.  Kind of runny though, no matter how long I cooked it.  Just a basic casserole.

Used cream of chicken, Wife said it is one of the best yet. Definitely a keeper. This is second time in short period. This time followed the recipe faithfully. Just about as good, would recommend the additional butter, but other than that great as described.

I added peas, red bell pepper, and cayenne pepper to the mix and it turned out so delicious!  Oh I mixed the crumbs with melted butter too as suggested by someone earlier.

This recipe was simple and very good.  I would change or add a few things though.  More chicken soup (maybe a can and a half) makes it more creamy.  Also, lots of mushrooms and a little spice - be it salt or pepper.  Finally, we added peas too and that made it almost like a chicken a la king.  YUMMY!

I made this dish for my family although I didn't receive much praise or input from my (sometimes) picky children my husband and I sure enjoyed it.  I did take the advice from previous raters and went ahead and added some of the ingredients they suggested and it sure made all the difference in taste. We found it very filling and I made the mistake of serving a side salad.  Now I know next time to leave it out.   I plan to keep this one handy.  Bon Appetite

My wife and I both liked this.  However the onions didn't get soft at all so I would probably brown them and then add them.  It was good over rice, but was pretty boring in colour.  A bit of red pepper would jazz it up.

This was pretty good.  Some said the flavor was a little bland, I thought the presentation was really bland.  When we heated up the leftovers, we added some frozen mixed veggies.  That helped give it a little color.  It is ok for a quick meal, but probably won't be making again.

Made it without the onions.  To be honest, it was kind of bland.  If I make it again, I'll have to spice it up.  My fiancee only ate one serving which is unheard of!  It really didn't go over very well!

Anyone can see that this recipe by itself is very dull. Even as I mixed the soup and sour cream so, I cubed and pan fried my chicken in olive oil with salt, pepper, minced garlic, basil, and oregano. I double the sauce and added a cup of milk and broccoli florets and added some crackers into the mixture. Mixed the other crushed crackers with some melted butter before placing on top. Served over buttered egg noodles and it was wonderful!!!! So, as the recipe stands I would give it 2 stars, which is what we are supposed to do.

I didn't have sour cream or cream of chicken soup so I used nonfat cottage cheese & 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup. I had 6 breasts left so I used them all in recipe. I used 3 cans of soup, 1 can of water, 1 1/4 c cottage cheese with a dash of Sriracha. I also liberally used cayenne pepper, seasoned pepper, salt & paprika. I sautéed 1 large onion, 2 red peppers & mushrooms. To add a bit of heat, I also added a diced jalapeño. I sprayed the cracker topping with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray & in the last 5 minutes I added some shredded cheddar cheese & uncovered. Next time, I will mix the cheese into the casserole though because it created a shell-type layer on top.  I served it over brown rice which was very filling. Surprisingly, my picky teenager enjoyed it as much as I did. Absolutely a great base as others have said!

Tucked one into the freezer for us and took one to a neighbor on the mend from recent surgery.  Used a rotisserie chicken and added milk to the soup and used canned mushrooms, drained, and a small can of mixed veggies. Neighbor has asked for the recipe.  It does remind you of chicken pot pie.  Very comforting on a cold, rainy day, easy and fast to put together and super yummy.

This is really good! I include the onion and mushroom, and also throw in a can of mixed veggies. I have nicknamed this "Chicken pot pie without the crust" and get great feedback when it's tasted!

We loved this as a base and did some improvisation - as some others suggested, we added 1/4 c sherry to the soup/sour cream sauce.  We used cream of mushroom soup and added 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/4 teaspoon thyme for flavor.  Instead of chopped mushrooms (none on hand) we tossed in chopped broccoli and bell peppers. Served over orzo pasta. Delicious!

We tried this recipe tonight. It was really good. I did add a cup of milk and cheddar cheese to melt on top.  I used the crackers with melted butter, but I also think French Fried onions would be a good topping also.  Really easy and not too expensive!

This was good.. but changes were needed to suit my tastes, otherwise I was afraid it would be too bland. I cooked the chicken with garlic, 1/3 cup onion, 1/3 cup muchrooms.. when it was finished I cut it up and mixed it in with the cream of chicken soup and the sour cream. I put the mixture in an 8x8 dish and placed the crushed crackers (mixed with a stick of butter) on top. Good starter recipe.

This was good.  I used 4 c. cooked chicken pieces.  Next time I will cut the sour cream back to 1/2 c. & 1/2 c. milk.  I did not add any veggies this time.

Easy and delish - I indeed added the milk as recommended, but added a can of mushrooms and a generous shake of cayenne pepper and cracked black pepper to the sauce.  Although, I sauteed the chicken cubes in butter, Lawry's and minced garlic, which added a lot.  I used Club cracker crumbs with melted butter and cheddar on top, and served it over orzo as recommended (with a side of peas) and my hubby raved!  Thanks for the tips!

This recipe was good but I changed it a little...i used the onion but added a little of the green bell pepper I had in my refrigerator...instead of using the crackers i topped it with mexican mix shredded cheese...i covered the casserole dish with foil baked it for 20 minutes removed the foil then added the cheese and baked it for the additional 10 minutes...it was delicious!

I had to give this a 5. It was so easy to make, tastes awesome, and you can add other things to it. The first time I made this it was getting very late so I used canned chicken. I literally opened a couple cans and voila dinner was ready. The second time I made this, I forgot to add milk and I didn't have any crackers, so I put it over rice. Both times were easy and delicious. Thank you Lynn.

This is one of the easiest things you can make,  and it turns out pretty good.  It is a bit on the bland side though so I add a little garlic powder to it.  Very tasty!

This recipe was a big hit at our house, a warm, comforting and delicious mixture of chicken, vegies and sauce. I added 2 cups of frozen mixed vegies to the sauteed red pepper, garlic and an onion mix and  tossed in a jar of mushrooms. Sour cream and 2 cans of soup plus a little milk made the sauce heavenly. Spiced it up with S&P, garlic powder, dried chives and celery salt. This recipe was easy to adapt to what's on hand, but needs the addition of colorful vegies. Kids will like it since it's similar to a pot pie. My husband and I both had seconds!

Don't know if it was just me but the chicken just tasted god awful. No flavor to it. The sauce barely helped at all. Time to heat up some freezer food.

This was so simple to make and my kids and husband loved it.  I have made it with rice and noodles.  The kids like it with wide noodles the best.  I agree with adding the milk to the recipe.  I have made it both ways and it is so much creamier when the milk is added.

Perhaps I made this wrong- However, that being said- even if I did make it wrong, the end result was a success.  I also cubed up the chicken and sauteed it with the onion and mushroom (normally- I prefer raw onion).. made the cream sauce as directed- mixed the chicken and sauce into a casserole dish..  Because it was later than expected- I covered it with tin foil and put it in the fridge over night (Maybe this is where I went pleasantly wrong).. the next evening, put it in the oven, baked it as instructed and YUM!!!   I thought it was a little "saucier" than it should have been (and I didn't add any milk- we put this over rice and it became a hit.. the chicken was so moist and tender- I was impressed- and because I made a double batch- there was plenty of extra sauce for everybody (Family of 5: myself, husband, two teens and a 6 yo)

The 5 stars is for my version of this recipe.  I haven't actually made this one.  I add a can of chopped green chilies, cooked noodles and an extra can of soup.  I also melt a stick of butter into a sleeve of crushed ritz crackers for the topping.  I have made this recipe several years.

This was absoultely delicious!! I sauted the onion and mushrooms while the chicken was boiling. I doubled the cream of chicken soup and soup cream ratio to make it more creammy!  Once the chicken was cooked and cut I sprinkled a little garlic salt and pepper on the chicken.  I sprinkled Monterary Jack Cheese over the chicken before I poured the creamy topping, and I took the advice of another reviewer and melted the butter and crushed the Ritz crackers into the melted butter on the stove top.  You may need to cook it a little longer if you pre-make it and cook it later,which it is what I did.  I made it in the morning, and cooked it for dinne.  The whole family, and one of my daughters friends who was eating over loved it and went back for seconds.

I added some veggies and a bit of milk to this to thin it out a bit.  I also added salt and pepper and a little Adobo seasoning to it.  This is a great way to get rid of left over chicken and is quick and easy.  Try mixing a little shredded cheddar in it also but don't over do it, it adds a nice change.

I suggest using cream of mushroom soup. Leaving out mushrooms and add some peas for a vegetable . Then you made it a little easier . You can also replace the crackers with stuffing croutons or miix. Still very good

Little bland. We like the base ingredients in the recipe. I think I will try it again and add some spices and possibly serve over rice or noodles.

This is so simple and delicious - real comfort food.  I used lowfat soup & sour cream, doesnt alter the taste.  To spruce it up I added a pkg of frozen chopped (drained) spinach, a 1/2 cup of shredded Swiss (cheddar is good too), and a few shakes of Paula's house seasoning (salt, pepper & garlic powder).  You really do need to mix the crackers with some melted butter. Ive made it twice now this way and we absolutely love it. Served with rice pilaf. Leftovers are great!  Thanks for sharing :)

Delicious recipe. Although instead of using buttery crackers I used stovetop stuffing and added a couple dashes of thyme. Thanks for the recipe! :)

We loved this recipe!  Thanks for sharing.  I had to modify as I did not have sourcream or mushrooms.  So I used a can of cream of mushroom soup instead.  I also added some milk to thin out sauce.  To save time, I added some sliced carrots so I did not have to cook separately.  Served over noodles.  Everyone loved it!  Definitely a keeper.  Great on a chilly autumn night!

I made this last night, and while it was easy and quick, it came out too runny.  It could use rice or noodles to absorb some of the moisture.  Also, without the onions and mushrooms, which the recipe says is optional, it would have been very bland. The taste with the mushrooms and onions was quite good, though.

My husband and I just got done eating this and we both said it was delicious.  I took other reviewers tips and mixed butter with the crackers.  I also mixed veggies into the soup mixture and some milk.  It makes a lot but will enjoy as left overs.  I served it over egg noodles.  Like I said,  this was delicious.  I will be making this when all my kids are home.

Great recipe, delicious and quick to put together. One time-saving tip is to use the breast meat from an already cooked rotisserie chicken that most grocery stores are now offering. Then I drizzle a stick of melted butter over the crackers and sprinkle on a couple of tablespoons of poppy seeds on the very top. Gives a delightful, delicate flavor.

I like this recipe because it was very quick and easy and I always have this stuff on hand. I have made it twice now and second time I added a can of corn. I may add other veggies next time. As other people commented, Ritz crackers are the best on top. Reminds me of a pot pie. Good base recipe that you can play with to your tastes.

This was really good. I confess I made a couple of changes. I cubed the chicken and cooked it with some onions and garlic, then put it in the baking dish. I added some red pepper and chopped water chestnuts to the sauce. I also put some Colby Jack cheese on the top before the cracker crumbs. I did as others suggested and added melted butter to the crumbs. Thanks for the recipe!

While I was boiling the chicken, I added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables to the pot(peas, carrots, corn, green beans). I found that this casserole was much better with the addition of the veggies. I also added a can of sliced water chestnuts to the sour cream/soup mixture. Ritz crackers have the best flavor for the topping, but make sure you finish it off with several tablespoons of melted unsalted butter. Or you could just mix the butter in with the bread crumbs. A great, all-in-one, easy & filling meal!

Thank you, Lynn, for this recipe.  I made two adjustments due to what I had on hand at the time.  1)Used two cans of canned chicken.  Mixed it in with the sauce along with onions and mushrooms.  2) Baked it in a 9 x 9 glass dish.  Served it with brown rice cooked in chicken boullion broth and onion powder.  Delish!!  You gave us a great combination.

What is so great about this recipe is that it is a good basis for creating your own recipe. You can cook the chicken any way you want to and add any seasoning, spices, or vegetables and I think this would still be amazing. I don't know that it would really be good by itself like a normal casserole would be. I served it over rice because it comes out like a sauce with the chicken, also would be good over pasta I think.

My husband and I love this recipe. I have changed it around a bit. I use the Cream of Chicken Soup with Herbs. Instead of boiling the chicken I brown it in a skillet with garlic, basil and a little cayenne pepper before adding it to the soup mixture. I omit the crackers. We serve this with white jasmin rice.

We ate it, but it certainly wasn't great.  The onions stayed crunchy and I had to coax (bribe) my 3 year old to eat it.  Not my favorite casserole...probably won't make again.

This was delicious!  I used Cream of Broccoli Soup since it's all I had and Frenchfried Onions instead of crackers (as suggested before), and it turned out awesome.  Extremely easy & even the picky kids liked it.

I didn't have the exact ingredients - I substituted cream cheese for sour cream and White Cheddar Cheez Its for crackers, but I thought it still came out pretty good.  I served it over farfalle (bow tie) pasta.  Also, I just grilled the chicken with some onion and minced garlic and then chopped it into bite sized pieces instead of boiling.

It was easy to prepare but we thought it was too bland. My husband said it was "missing something". I sauted the mushrooms and onions - don't know if this made a change to the original recipe.

Excellent.  I sauteed the onions and mushrooms in butter before adding them to the soup mixture.  My two twelve year olds begged me to make this again.

This was a really good easy recipe. More importantlly my children loved it.  It was creamy and tasty. I added cooked pasta and peas to the mixture before I put it in the oven.  I also cooked the onion in butter before adding to mixture.  A little salt and pepper and it was great.

Yum, yum! It was very easy to make and it tasted great! Might try a combo of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup the next time. And serving over noodles is a good idea. Might try some Chinese noodles for an extra crunch.

I think this would be better with 'Stove Top Stuffing' on top instead of the crackers, that would give it more flavor.

I am not a really good cook so trying different things.  I didn't get the right broccoli so the stalk of the broccoli was very hard.  I will just buy tops next time.  Also I took the can of soup and added milk to it but that made it too watery.  I will use half next time.  The dish was good and I think will be much better when I fix my little errors.   I will say it was very easy to make.  I will be trying this one again.

I made this recipe exactly as it said.  I think in the future I will add a little more cream of chicken soup or sour cream (or both).  I served in on top of linguini noodles. It was a little too dry but tasted awesome. Will definitely be making this again.

Used “Better Then Bouillon” chicken base when boiling the chicken (about two pounds) which is better than regular bouillon.  Use two cans of soup and a half can of milk.  Added tons of seasoning including dried minced onions, instead of cutting up an onion.  Added small can of peas, some white corn, sharp cheddar cheese, and included the mushrooms too.  Melted one stick of butter and one sleeve of Ritz crackers and out on top.  Cooked in a 9x13 pan covered. Yummy

The main ingredient to make this a casserole is the sauce, which I made according to the original recipe with the soup & sour cream (& same proportions as instructed).  To make it easier on a weeknight, I used a grocery-store rotisserie chicken (the whole thing, chopped up) , and added frozen peas, corn, carrots, string beans, and 1 package of refrigerated spinach/cheese tortellini.   Came out great, and I would definitely make it again.

Did 1 can condensed cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom, some sour cream and some milk (1ish cups each), used dry minced onions, can of mushrooms, can of corn, and melted butter on the cracker crumbs.  Surprised at how much we liked it! No added salt, pepper, or garlic even! Will definitely keep in the usual mix, especially for leftover chicken.  Even better the next day.

Added 2 cups mixed frozen (thawed and rinsed) vegetables, full pint of mushrooms, 1 whole onion, 2 minced garlic cloves and a chopped red pepper. Sauteed all prior to baking (chopped chicken and did not boil). I think I'll try it again baking uncovered so that the crackers are crunchier. As another reviewer posted, thanks for a good starter casserole recipe.

One of our favorite comfort foods... which is also perfect for church potlucks. If I use 6 large chicken breasts, I often double the rest of the recipe. However - especially when I double it - I keep the crackers off. I bake for 30 - 40 minutes... and then add the cracker crumbs (sometimes mixed with a bit of melted better) and tamp them down a bit to adhere to the mixture to bake for another 10 - 15 minutes. Comes out perfectly!

I made this yesterday but made several  additions.  It looked very bland to me so I added a 4.5 oz can of green chilies, garlic salt,  onion salt, and several dashes of Frank's Hot Sauce.  I covered it with bread crumbs and then sprinkled on grated Parmesan cheese. That all helped a lot.  It was very flavorful and had a little kick to it.

It was simple to prepare but not much flavor. Added pepper, salt, to taste, maybe use seasoned crackers or breadcrumbs instead?

This chicken casserole was fantastic and super easy to make! I did just make some small changes to add flavor. I added ms. dash's chicken seasoning to the chicken before pouring the mixture over it, and then used cheez-its for the topping instead of just regular crackers!

So simple yet somehow bursting with flavor! I think the cream of chicken soup really makes it seem sumptuous without feeling too heavy. Great for picky eaters; I made the version without onions but I bet it would taste just as great with!

I made this casserole with the exception of some additions taken from some of the reviews. It was god, but seemed as though it could use something else. I have yet to pinpoint exactly what that is. I am leaning on adding vegetables and making into a potpie.

I have made this for years (sans onions) and LOVE it.  We found it in a church cookbook and it was called ‘Chicken Lynn’.  I don’t know who Lynn was but she was a  good cook.  Thanks for posting one of my favorite comfort foods.

This was really good! my husband was skeptical, as the ingredients sounded different, but he loved it and so did my kids. I had to double the recipe to feed my family of 5, and I served it over rice. I also added melted butter to the crackers, and a frozen vegetable mix to the soup and sour cream. I will definitely make this again!

My tablet had little battery left, so after reading, I had to go by memory.  I boiled two breasts, cubed them and mixed soup, sour cream, browned onion and peas from the garden.  (I forgot to layer the chicken.)  Then I put the crushed crackers on top.  We had it over baked biscuits and salt and peppered to taste.  Yum.

When I made this I loaded it up with veggies so I did broccoli, onion, mushrooms, spinach, and some red pepper. I also combined sharp cheddar cheese with the ritz crackers to give it a little kick!

The grands are spending the night tonight, and this is one of their favorite meals (minus the onions and mushrooms). So of course, it's what Granna is fixing for them!

It was great! We added sweet corn as well. Also cooked the onions and mushrooms with the chicken in a frying pan instead of boiling.

I used the French's fried onions as a topping.  Instead of boiling the chicken I baked it in the oven before adding the other ingredients.

Very good.  I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom soups (lowfat) and also low-fat sour cream and mixed in some garlic powder.  I didn’t have any onion so I used onion powder instead.  I also sprinkled the chicken with some Mike’s All Purpose seasoning before pouring the soup mixture on top.  I used panko bread crumbs with melted butter on top.  Baked Uncovered for an extra 10 minutes or so in order to brown the top.  Delicious!

I would add another 1/2 can of soup to make it more moist...
at the end I mixed all ingredients and layered a can of crescent 
rolls and baked for an additional 9 minutes until golden brown..
The crescent rolls made it more like a pot pie texture...otherwise it was great recipe!!

Yes the recipe didn't tell u to make the cream of chicken soup as directed on the can so I used 1 can of milk however if I make again I will use 1/2 cup milk and use 1/2 cup of the broth from where I boiled my chicken, I also used Club crakers and used Ritz crackers also used a little too much though it was still good, I also made chicken stove top stuffing and put the casserole over top of it. I am going to freeze the left overs, thinking after it sets it will be even better. thank you

I like to make a new recipe as close as possible to the original recipe, however, I did make this with the following changes:  omitted the mushrooms, added in a  frozen bag of mixed vegetables and only used half the stated sour cream (because its all I had).  It came out good but definitely needed more flavor.  Sooooo, next time I will saute some onion and garlic and mix that in with the soup and sour cream. Hopefully that will give it more flavor!

I am giving this 4 stars because it was an awesome base to build on.  I changed it pretty drastically though  for full disclosure. I  started from the beginning.  I cooked some onion, red pepper, and garlic in a a little butter and olive oil until just done.  I moved it to a bowl and cooked the chicken (cut into bite sized pieces) in a little garlic salt and pepper.  I then mixed the can of cream of chicken, with sour cream and a dash of milk and mixed it with the pepper onion mix, chicken and some diced broccoli.   I poured it in my casserole dish and then crushed two sleeves of ritz crackers that I mixed with about a quarter cup of melted butter and sprinkled that on top.  Baked for 30 minutes at 350 and served with steamed green beans and rice.  Everyone like it except my son, but he is the worlds pickiest child and so I counted it a success anyway.

I boiled the chicken until almost done, and then sauteed it with the onions and mushrooms (which i added a cup of) + seasoned the chicken with tons of fresh cracked and garlic salt. I then boiled 2 cups of shell pasta al dente and added it to the casserole as well.  I used the water from the chicken earlier. Then instead of cream of chicken soup i used cream of mushroom soup because that's what I had in my pantry. I watered it down with 1/4 cup of chicken broth. After I put the crushed rits, I put a bunch of tiny little pats of butter. Very very gluttonous.  I made this for my boyfriend and his surprised guest! They both raved about it and got seconds!

I used 2 very large chicken breasts, cubed and sautéed with onion, ground black pepper, dash of smoked paprika and garlic.  Then mixed in one cream of chicken soup, one cream of mushroom soup, one cup sour cream and 1/2 cup chicken broth; about 4 oz canned mushrooms.  Baked for 20 minutes in 8x12 dish, then added the buttery  bread crumbs and baked for 10 minutes.  Served over rice;   it made lots of sauce for the rice.  My husband really liked it;  I give it 5 stars because he is very picky.  I thought is was great too.  Very versatile recipe...use what you have on hand.

Needed something quick and easy to do for dinner that used precooked chicken and I chose this!  Quite good but added a few things I had on hand......sauteed the onion, some red and green peppers and added some frozen peas for a few more veggies.  Seasoned salt and pepper are always in my meals, so added that too.  OK....yes, I changed it up a bit, but it was good, easy and simple and you can add whatever you like.

I used 6 chicken breasts, 2 cans of Campbell's Cream of Chicken with Herbs, 1 cup of sour cream, 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of chicken broth, one-half of a large sweet onion, 1 can of mushrooms, a half of a cup of shredded cheddar cheese, one package of frozen broccoli, one can of Del Monte Fire Roasted corn, 2 sleeves of Club crackers, and one stick of butter.

I cooked the chicken first, then I put the broccoli and chopped onion in the chicken broth and let that cook about half-way. During this time I mixed the cream of chicken, sour cream, milk, mushrooms, cheddar cheese, chicken broth, and chicken together. I ladled out the broccoli and onions into a large baking dish and then poured the mixture on top. I layered on the crushed crackers and then put pieces of butter on the top. I baked at 375 until bubbly.

It was a hit! My husband loved it. He said there were so many flavors that seemed to explode in his mouth. This will definitely be a favorite.

I took the advice of some others and used the recipe as a base, but added corn, peas, cheese and extra butter.  I fried up the onions with garlic in butter, as well.  Needed more flavour, so I added some paprika and pepper.  Over all (and I'm not much of a cook) this is good and something I would make again.

It was super easy to make! Tasted like chicken soup but more solid. Yummy but needs something else to it.

I made this last night and it was really good. follwed directions for the most part except i browned my chicken (seasoned with salt and pepper) in some butter instead of boiling the chicken, did about 3/4 cups of the onions and mushrooms, and sprinkled some garlic powder over the top of the crackers for some extra flavor. also, since i browned my chicken instead of boiling, i cooked for 25 minutes covered, then uncovered for 5 minutes to make sure it was done! turned out great and will make this again as it was easy and delicious!!!

I made this recipe mostly  how it said to. My family all complained it was way too soupy. The taste was good and I will make this again, without so much soup and sour cream. I did add more crackers and butter as there was not enough to cover dish. I added spices and cheese also.

I made the recipe as originally specified and added 1 cup of frozen mixed peas and carrots.  I did dice up the mushrooms so the kids didn't notice.  I also crumbled up about 1/2 cup of potato chips and sprinkled on top with the crackers.  Kids loved it.

I cheated: fried a cup of chopped mushrooms and cup onions and cup of hash-browns with garlic. Diced the chicken and added 1 cup each corn kernels and peas. Added seasoning. Topped the mix with 1/2 cup Parmesan and 1/2 cup bread crumbs

I was super skeptical of this recipe so I made a few changes. I sauteed the mushrooms and left out the onion (only because I didn't have any but I may leave them out in the future too). I crushed the crackers in butter as others suggested, I added a can of ro-tel, and I baked it for 40minutes. While it baked I made a pot of egg noodles and then mixed it in to the casserole after the casserole was finished. I thought it was delicious, my toddlers thought it was delicious, and my husband hated it.

It turned out real good, I made about a third more than the recipe. I did fry the chicken and onions together and I added that 1/2 cup milk and shredded cheddar cheese before the cracker crumbs. Served it on noodles. Yummy.

This was so delish! I made it tonight and we just got done eating it, I wanted to comment right away.  I'm not the best cook but my husband was super impressed and loved this!  I added noodles and a little cheese and put butter in the crackers for the topping.  It was a huge hit and this will be a staple in our dinner rotation!!

The casserole was OK.  The onions seemed to overpower the rest of the flavor.  And, perhaps it could use cheese.

I did take the tips from another user. Added a small change. I too added garlic salt.. And threw in a few more seasonings. I did not add the onion as my hubby doesn't like onion.. (I love it) I also thinned it with the milk.. For me a little more a half cup. Added peas.  Shredded cheddar, mixed it all together in a bowl before putting in a buttered casserole dish..topped with the buttered crackers... Upon serving.. A little fresh parm cheese.

Used cream of mushroom and cream of chicken with one chicken flavor boost.  Don't use mushrooms, saute chicken and onions, chop into pieces.

This recipe is a good base. I made a few changes, based in personal taste and what I had on hand. Firstly, I pre-cooked some rotini pasta. I then sautéed the onion, then added the chicken, some salt and pepper and added 2 cloves of minced garlic with the mushrooms in the sautéed pan. I then added the soup (cream of chicken with herbs), sour cream and the pasta noodles to the chicken after removing it from the heat. Lastly, I poured the mixture into a greased casserole dish and topped with stuffing mix because I had that on hand instead of the crackers, and baked according to the recipe. Next time I make this I will add a dash of milk to make the sauce a little creamier, some peas for color and texture, and either a stalk of celery or some almonds or peanuts to add a little crunch.

I also changed some things and it was a hit. I don't mix dairy and chicken so I substituted tofu. Cut it in chunks and sautéed a few minutes after seasoning with a chicken seasoning mix. Added  in some milk to the soup/sour cream mixture and mixed the whole thing together with al dente pasta. Put it all in the casserole and baked. The kids loved it!

This was pretty good! I added some seasonings to the chicken, and some frozen peas to try and sneak in a veggie. I also doubled the sour cream and used 2 cans of the soup because I wanted enough sauce to serve over rice. Only used 12 crushed crackers. Any more seemed like it would be overkill. Next time, I will try with broccoli. Very good base recipe. Thanks!

I've made this for years but a little different and everyone always loves it.  I put crackers on the bottom, layer of chicken, layer of sliced water chestnuts, and then the soup, sour cream and 1/2 can of chicken broth mixture (no onions or mushrooms) and then a full pack of Ritz crackers on top with about 2 tablespoons of melted butter mixed with it.  It is so delicious!

Excellent!  I got some good tips from other people's reviews.  I added milk to the soup mixture to make it a little more liquidy.  Also added a little garlic powder.  I served it over orzo which was a great idea suggested by another reviewer.

I definitely think it gets a 3-4 as it's written but it's a great base. It needs a little loving! I made it again and to my family it's officially a 5. Ammmmazing. I know I'm supposed to review the recipe as is ... And I did. But here are some tips. 

I used the recipe ingredients and added a bit of milk. Just about 10 oz. I put garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and pepper, and a hint of cayenne to give it a small kick. 

I'm not a huge fan of boiled chicken so I diced raw chicken breast and rolled the chicken in corn flake crumbles. I fried it up in some butter with some onion and seasoned that with salt and pepper and a little garlic. I poured the soup mixture into a baking dish and poured the chicken over the top. I cooked the chicken to done over the stovetop. Mixed in chicken and soup mixture and put Parmesan and cheddar cheese over the top and more corn flake crumbles over that. Popped it in the oven for 15 minutes and then broiled it for 5 minutes. 
We had a flavorful, cheesy, crunchy, amazingness in our mouths and all super fast! We served it over jasmine rice. 

Holy moly it was gone in ten seconds after it came out of the oven!

An Easy to follow and very tasty meal.  Like one reviewer suggested I Pan fry the chicken first this always works best for me along with the Onions and I added Green Peppers just because I could.

It tasted mostly like Cream of Chicken. Next time I might try Cream of Mushroom or adding some extra seasonings.

this was okay.   My family thought it was bland.  It started out okay... but got boring.  I'm not sure how to spice it up.. I will keep trying.  I did NOT use the onions or mushrooms.   I did serve over brown rice.   Needs peppers?

I live by myself consequently the recipe lasted all week, which was good. The only change I made was to use one half can of the chicken broth from boiling the chicken and introduce it into the recipe. Great taste.

Totally yummy!  My husband and son inhale this stuff.  We also like it with the French's Fried Onions on the top.  Perfect weeknight comfort food meal.  :)

I really liked this one.  I used the onions, no mushrooms (didn't have them on hand.)  Has a really good home-cooked meal flavor, and not too many ingredients! I like that!

I pretty much made it the way it said. I made my own cream of chicken soup and then followed the recipe. I usually don't like american food, too bland, but my husband does. So I made this for him and liked.

This was great and VERY easy! I added some garlic powder which gave it some flavor, and put a little bit of Parmesan cheese and shredded Cheddar on top. Will make again.

I chose this recipe for the easy of it however I changed it up a bit.  I browned the chicken with season salt, garlic, salt & pepper.  I add an extra cup of rice, additional can of Crème of Mushroom soup &  3/4 c. sour cream.  I stirred in a bag of frozen veggie mix (cauliflower, broccoli, carrots) and can of mushrooms.  I place the browned chicken on top of the rice mixture and then topped with Colby Jack cheese, the cracker crumbs and drizzled with melted butter.  Cover and baked 1 hr, uncovered for 20 min.  It had great flavor, boyfriend and I both loved it.

Awsome recipe.  You can also substitute cream of mushroom, or cream of celery soup. It changes the taste a bit, but still delicious.  I've found that ritz crackers work the best.

This was really good - I made some adjustments:  Used fat free cream of mushroom and fat free sour cream.  I sauteed the onions and mushrooms prior to baking and topped with Lipton onion mix (half of the envelope since it's very salty), bread crumbs, and low fat parmesan cheese.

This is so delicious. I follow the recipe for the most part, but I add cooked mixed veggies instead of the suggested vegetables. The flavor is wonderful! I like to saute the chicken in butter beforehand. 5 star recipe, thanks so much! :]

Very good basic recipe.  I used leftover chicken and low fat sour cream and cream of chicken soup.  I left out the onions but did use fresh mushrooms.  Very good!
