This recipe was so simple and yet it tasted like a lot of work had gone into it.  The butter makes it extremely rich - but I followed the recipe exactly and it was a hit!  I served it with 'garlic knots' (recipe from this site) and steamed broccoli, and it rounded the meal out nicely.

This was really quick and easy.  I added a clove of minced garlic to the butter, and it was fantastic!

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  Be sure to use only real butter because margerine leaves an unpleasant greasiness in the flavor.  Not only was this good but it takes so little time, which is always a plus.  I will definitely be making this again!

WONDERFUL!! I listened to one of the other reviews and sautéed my shrimp separately with onions, olive oil, and lemon pepper seasoning. Did not use the Terryaki sauce but did the milk substitute (as suggested). Also, when I put everything together I added mozzarella and parmesan. Will make again!!!

I am a college student, and I like to eat home cooked meals that are quick to prepare and delicious. I followed the recipe to the word with the  exception of creole seasoning (couldn't find it at the grocery store:)) This dish is easy and quick to make, very rich to the taste, and I only had one deep pan and two dishes to wash. I'll Certainly attempt again adding my own personal touch. Strongly recommended!

This recipe is the easiest to make and the most delicious. The recipe calls for 1 cup of butter, at first i was a little hesitant but oh well, once in a while is not going to hurt,especially when it is this good! The creole seasoning and the teriyaki add lots of flavor.  Thanks for the recipe, it is a keeper!!

You bet, a good one here for sure. My kids loved it as well...even my 7 yr old after balking at first. Has a very rich taste, works very well with some mushrooms and asparagus tips. Excellent.

Excellent, very flavorful.  I had used bowtie pasta in place of spaghetti and was great.  It is a keeper for sure!

This was pretty good, however, I did make few changes.  I was kind of hesitant adding the teriyaki sauce, because I wasn't sure how the outcome of the taste would be, so I subistuted it for milk, and added some cayenne pepper to the sauce as well. I didn't add the shrimp to the sauce, instead I seasoned it with spices, and then grilled it, and tossed the whole thing together with the spagetti, sauce and shrimp. Finished it off with chopped green onions, excellent! Next time will probably try the teriyaki and see how that turns out.

Changes: Used 1/4 C. butter, doubled creole seasoning and teriyaki sauce, and used angel hair pasta. Also, instead of putting the sauce onto the pasta, I put the pasta in the skillet with the shrimp and sauce mixture. It coated the pasta and It was delicious! It was so fast and easy. The flavor of the creole seasoning was pefect. Not too spicy or salty for my tastes. I will be making it again and again!

Very simple and tasty. I was looking for a way to cook fresh shrimp other than bbq... I used a bay seasoning instead of the creole seasoning, but my husband and daughter loved it and they are pretty picky. I am thinking next time I might add some fresh mushrooms to the shrimp and butter mixture..

OMG!!!!!!!!!! this is probably the best shrimp dish I have ever tasted. Followed directions and ingredients exactly. Used Konriko creole seasoning(made in New Iberia. LA.USA)  and of course the best pasta DeCecco......... I wouldn't change a thing. This will be served to friends and family for years to come! Thanks so

This was really really tasty :) I did make a few changes though: I halved the butter then added a little olive oil. I didn't have teriyaki sauce so I put in a little soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, ginger powder, and sugar. After the spaghetti was done, I put it in the skillet with the shrimp to coat it. I forgot about the cheese and it was still good.

I made this exactly as written using the Creole seasoning recipe from this site. I was afraid the butter would be way too much but I didn't want to alter the recipe the very first time. It was delicious and soooo easy to make. If you want to impress your friends, serve this dish with a nice salad and warm bread/rolls of your choice. Yum!

Oh my goodness!  I just finished eating this and just had to rate it right away!!  this is absolutely delicious!!!  I could eat this all day everyday!  granted I would get really fat really quickly but it would almost be worth!  I made my own teriyaki sauce and made the 'creole seasoning blend' on this site.  simply amazing!  loved it!  Oh, i also followed the recipe exactly.   Perfect as is.

this was pretty darn good and extremely easy!! i didnt have any creole season so i made some from a recipe from AR. i actually had to add more salt, which alot of reviews said it was too salt. I also think that my teriyaki sauce was past ex so it wasnt as flavorful. But overall it was good! will make again

I made this tonight and everyone raved!  Even the picky eater said it was a keeper!  It was awesome!  I made it exact to the recipe.  Although we really enjoyed it as is, we did find we could use it a little less salty so next time I will use either unsalted butter or light olive oil. Fabulous... thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent. The spaghetti is a must with this recipe. I am going to use scallops next time, just to change, in this delicious sauce. A definite keeper in our house.  Nothing was left! Thank you so much.

This is surprisingly tasty for how easy it is, but the amount of butter is excessive.  We love butter and use it a lot, but one half cup is plenty here!  Also very good without the parmesan.

Yummy!!  I made this with bow tie pasta and I added edamame to the boiling water in the last 4 minutes.  My only suggestion would be to cut the butter by 1/3,  it was a bit too much.  My husband and I both enjoyed this very much.  Thanks Winn for a quick, easy and delicious recipe.

Enjoyed this recipe.  We also added Bay Scallops in addition to the shrimp.  Used a bit less butter.  combined black and white pepper but would use a bit less because it did make it a bit spicy.  Thought adding aspargus would be a good touch for next time.

The adults, the 9 year old, and 2 year old all loved it! To add a little color and save a step, 3 minutes before the pasta was done, I threw in 2 cups of frozen shelled edamame and the shrimp. Drained it all, dumped it back into the pasta pot, poured the sauce over it, and served. Will happily add this to my regular rotation!

Update: Wanted this but had no spaghetti so I used korean jap che (glass) noodles instead. Also running low on butter so used only 3/4 cup. Omitted the parmesan, added a splash of tamari, white wine to make up for the missing butter, garlic, and ginger paste. Amazingly enough, it's even better this way!

I cut 3 pieces of bacon into small pieces and fried it.   I took out the crispy bacon and sauted some chopped onion and garlic in the grease.   Then I decreased the butter by half and followed the rest of the recipe.  It was yummy.  I can't wait to add fresh herbs to it this summer.

Based on others' reviews, I added 1 lb fresh sliced mushrooms, some chopped green onion and 3 cloves of minced garlic.  I also doubled the amount of teriyaki sauce.  Thanks, Win, for a very tasty shrimp recipe!

This was ok. I followed suggestions of another reviewer and substituted olive oil for some of the butter; the idea of so much butter sort of turned me off. Even using unsalted butter, it was far too salty a dish. The teriyaki flavor was just a bit too strong, too. After putting it all together and tasting, I sauteed some mushrooms on the side w/a little green onion, and added them to the pot. That helped a little bit, if only to cut the teriyaki flavor a litte. I really couldn't taste the creole seasoning, but was reluctant to add more due to the already considerable saltiness.

We LOVED this recipe!  I cut back on the butter (1/2 c instead of 1c), added extra teriyaki and added some steamed broccoli and it was just delicious!  Next time I will try using olive oil as I saw suggested in another review.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I followed the recipe with one exception: I used 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil and 1/4 cup "Smart Balance" butter.  My husband made comments such as "Give this one 5 stars!", and "This tastes like a restaurant meal!".  Easy to make.

We absolutely loved the flavor! The only thing I would do differently would be use unsalted butter as the dish was very salty. Otherwise will definitely be making this again!

My husband loved this. He said that we can't eat it all the time because of the amount of butter in it but he definitely says it is a keeper. I did not change anything about the recipe and I used Tony Chachere's creole seasoning. It was very easy and quick to make.

This dish is outstanding.  I used Capellini instead of spaghetti (all I had on hand).  Forgot to use the parmesan cheese and didn't miss it.  I may spice it up a little more next time.
Thanks for a delicious recipe!

It doesn't get much easier than this!  Very simple and very delicious.  I only used 1/2 cup butter and that was plenty for my taste.  I might use even less next time.

This recipe was awful.  I managed to save it by adding flour and milk to the butter sauce, until the consistency was just right.  I also added one can of condensed tomato soup for flavor.  After all those changes it did taste really good.  Would not make again.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now, and I rarely hear complaints.  I usually use farfalle pasta, however, but that is just personal preference.  On some occasions it has been too salty, for some reason.  To prevent this, I usually use half unsalted and half salted butter.  I have also tried simmering the shrimp in some butter and lemon pepper prior to putting it into the sauce and have cooked it directly into the sauce, and I like it both ways.  This past time I used cajun instead of creole seasoning (that was all they had at the store), and I have to admit that I think I like it with the creole seasoning better. It adds a little more kick.  The recipe is fairly forgiving as I sometimes add a little extra seasoning or a little extra teriyaki just to try it out.  All in all it is a great recipe that is almost always a hit!

I was concerned about the teriyaki overpowering put decided to go for it.  I made as directed but did reduce butter by 3T and did not miss it a bit.  The butter sauce has a very slight bite to it from the seasonings hardly even resembling teriyaki. Very good dish!  served with broccoli and garlic bread.  yum!

I loved this and couldn't wait to eat leftovers.  Although I thought it sounded strange I think the little bit of teriyaki gives it that extra something.

This just didn't do it for me. The seasoning in the sauce didn't taste very good to me...although without it or with something different this would be very good as I love shrimp and pasta. I also added broccoli which turned out very well. Not sure I'll make it again.

Love it!  I did use some of the advice adding - 1/4 cup of cream, 3 tbs teriyaki sauce,  1/2 cup of butter 1/2 cup olive oil (instead of just butter), Cajun seasoning (what I already have in cabinet) and bow tie pasta.  I also serve steamed broccoli on the side.

I will be making this a regular for dinner. I did use the 1/4 butter & 1/4 EV Oil suggestion. Glad I did. I also used Cajun seasoning (didn't have creole). I normally don't care for spicy food, but I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. Also, it is so easy and quick to make.

This was wonderful.  The sauce was not too heavy and had a nice little zip to it.  I added green onion and mushrooms when I sauted the shrimp.  I don't think it changed the flavor very much, but it added some color.

I made this tonight and it was fantastic! I made it exactly as the recipe called for and my family all loved it and said "Make it again!".  I do think next time I may add some broccoli to it.

Yum! Have made twice. Once with butter, this time with olive oil. This time I cut the oil in half and it was still fantastic! Also added more creole and more teriyaki. Next time, I will probably do 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup unsalted butter. Any way you slice it, it's a hit!

Excellent - very easy meal to make!  The first time I made it tasted to peppery (could be the type of Creole seasoning I use) which overpowered the dish, so the second time I omitted the pepper and was very pleased with the results.

My family loves this  pasta.  
I don’t use the 1 cup of butter. I use just over a 1/4 cup of butter.  I also add some garlic olive oil and a little bit of white wine. I like that this recipe is fast and easy.

I made it exactly as written. Very yummy for something so easy.  Obviously very buttery, so you need to expect that, but tastes a lot like a scampi without the garlic.  I would definitely make again, although I don't know if I'd fix it for company ;)

Very salty, but otherwise a great recipe! The shrimp was perfectly cooked. Next time we'll use half the amount of butter (and make sure it's unsalted).

Awesome!!!!  I cut the butter down to 1 stick, and can probably cut it more and used whole-grain pasta. This is one of the best recipes I've tried!!

I cut back on the butter, upped the amount of creole seasoning, and also added some fresh minced garlic. It was absolutely superb! This is so quick and easy to make yet it looks and tastes like you've spent all day on it. Thanks so much!

I'm going with the middle ground on this one because my family liked it but I did not.  Hubby didn't really say much other than "It's OK."  My 7YO INHALED it (so did my 2YO, but it's noodles, right?).  I dunno...it had a sweet-ish taste to me.  Definitely "off" somehow...I'm just not sure how...lol.  I don't know if it was the teriyaki sauce I used (but I like it for everything else!) or the creole seasoning...I'm not sure.  I don't think I'll be making it again, but THANKS!

Made this for my husband, as I do not eat shrimp. He loved it! I made as is, but cut the recipe in half to serve for only 1. Very simple. Will make again.

This was so easy and so good! I would have never thought to mix teriyaki sauce and Creole seasoning together but the tastes combined really well. I will fix this again.

This recipe is so easy and really tasty. I made it exactly as the recipe indicated and my family loved it. Honestly, this reminded me of a shrimp and pasta dish you'd have at a nice restaurant. I think the sauce would be a great marinade for shishkabobs too.
