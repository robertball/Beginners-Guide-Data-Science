I modified it by pre-cooking the bacon, heating the hot dog and cheese in the microwave, then the cooked bacon and cheesy hot dog were put in the bun to eat. We thought they were great!  No added condiments; there was plenty of flavor.

Jackie Marie and recipe readers...
While working at our small snack bar, we were looking for something QUIK-N-TASTY we could make with the plain old hawt dawgs we already had.  Of course we came across your recipe and forever changed our snack bar lives.  HINT-- the snack bar only has swiss american cheese, so we invented a NEW SPICY-N-DICY hawg-n-dog variation... Dice jalapeno peppers and put them in between two slices of cheese within the hawt dawgs.  MMMMMM.... GOOD-N-SPICY!  Also, we thought it would be cute as a button if the name were HAWG-N-DAWGS, with the "d-a-w-g."

So good, but soooo bad for you! I thought it was very tasty, though. The only thing I added were a few jalapeno slices, for an added kick. It was fun to try something new, thanks!

This recipe sounded soooo good.  Unfortunately too many flavors come slamming together.  Sorry, I won't try this one again.

This was really good, a great improvement to hot dogs!  We made ours in the deep fryer.  We also liked bacon crubled over the cheese dog.  They really don't need any condiments but I liked it with bbq sauce.  We are going to make these for our next party.

I've not tried this yet, but came to browse corn dogs for The Big Game on Sunday.  I'll bet these will make fantastic corndogs when dipped in cornmeal batter and deep fried. You'd probably have to cook the bacon a little before wrapping it to lose some of the grease, but it's worth a try!

These were good, but I didn't make them the way the recipe said to. I had already cooked bacon and already cooked hot dogs so I just put the ingedients together and warmed them up... I served with tomato and some green onion with mayo, kinda like a blt hot dog.

I never tried pepperjack cheese before. Boy was I missing something,it is so good. The cheese went really well with the hotdogs. This was really good. This is the only hotdog I don't need onions on. I ate it with some mustard. I don't think I will make again because of the high fat content. But it was worth trying once.

Made it the first time i saw it as everyone in my house LOVES bacon (in any form lol) and wanted to surprise everyone.  Used the Jumbo sized hot dogs and wrapped them with 3 slices.  Only one person in the house used the pepperjack (LOVED IT) and the rest used cheddar (OMG! Fantastic!)  This is now made 2x a week and is a hit with our friends too.

My husband and my son really liked this, but I think I would rather have my bacon on the side. I think it was too much work for some hot dogs, but it was pretty tasty.

I changed bacon to turkey bacon with great results. Great little twist to the famous DOG! Easy, quick, tasty meal with pork and beans.

This was awesome but I told my husband this was a one time thing for obvious health reason! Quick and easy if you have a fryer onhand. Really good with bbq sauce.
