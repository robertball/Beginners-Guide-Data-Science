This was ok, but I didn't like the tarragon flavor with it, and think it might be better with something else other than beef broth, kind of a strange combo of ingredients, didn't hate it and didn't love it.  I don't think I will make this again.

Found this recipe to get rid of some evap milk, then ended up using half and half instead. Oh well. Liked the soup after some modifications--No mushrooms. Used tops of green onions, too. Sub out Tarragon and instead used cayenne pepper and celery seed. Stir in 1/2 cup mozzarella in final step. Top with shredded asiago cheese.

Interesting ingredients! I'm thinking you can add any veggies and this would be good. I had to add a cup of chicken broth to this to thin it out a bit. I used red Quinoa because that's what was on sale. Will make again!
