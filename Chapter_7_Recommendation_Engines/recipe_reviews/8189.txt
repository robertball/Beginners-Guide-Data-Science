For the experienced baker, this recipe is pretty straight forward and not a lot of work. The result is a dense chocolate cake with a lot of flavor. Use good chocolate, I recommend just using 14 ounces of a 85% chocolate  - 10 melted in the batter, and 4 in the glaze. The glaze is thin, and is probably meant to be.

Very rich.  This is not for those who don't find dark chocolate appealing.  SPECIAL NOTE:  This turns out much more like a torte in appearance and texture than a cake.  Expect minimial rising and a very heavy, but moist outcome.  Also, if guests don't like a heavy alcohol taste...back off on the port in the glaze.

While this cake tasted great, I found that it was quite difficult to make. For one, even though I followed the directions to the letter, the cake didn't rise as much as I expected it should've. Secondly, the glaze turned out much too thin, so I added more chocolate and corn syrup to thicken it up enough for it to actually glaze the cake, instead of being soaked up by the cake. All in all, it tasted delicious, but be prepared to monkey a bit with the recipe.

I have been wanting to make this for some time. In one word -- disappointment. I made this for my husband's birthday. The flavor was good but it was nothing what I expected because of the work put into it. Very, very labor intenstive. Lots of expensive ingredients. Husband loved it but I think I could have gotten the same results by adding port to a chocolate cake mix. Save your self the time, expense and mess, pass on this one.

Absolutely sinful!  I had some old port that I needed to use, and it turned out to be the most raved-about item on my menu!

Have been looking for a cake with Port for some time and this hits the spot.  Also I like heavy dark cakes, but I put on my own chocolate glaze minus the Port. Thanks again.   Contrary to other comments I didn't find this difficult to make - just a few more steps.   A cake mix would definitely not taste the same.

Disappointed in this recipe. I make a chocolate rasp port and thought this would be a great recipe. I used good chocolate but it did not help. It was dry and fell apart as it cooled. I still served it but everyone said there were much better desserts. I would not waste time making this.

I LOVE this cake. Yes, it's takes some work but it's well worth it. I will not even consider a recipe that uses boxed cake mix. If you follow the directions it will come out great. It is necessary to keep your mixer on the full 5 minutes just as the directions say. I don't understand reviewers who don't follow directions and then end deducting stars. I ended up making mini bundt cakes and gave them out as gifts. Mine turned out moist and the only thing I did different was use bittersweet chocolate for the glaze rather than unsweetend. Delish and I will certaily be making this again.

If you have the ingredients to make this recipe, I'd recommend making something else with them.  This was okay.  It was VERY dry.  There are SO many better chocolate dessert recipes out there.

Decadent and delicious! This cake was NOT difficult to make. The comments of other reviewers puzzled me, especially the complaints that the cake did not rise. The recipe contains no leavening agents - it is not MEANT to rise. All of its volume comes from the air in the beaten eggs, which is why is it important to beat them thoroughly. This cake is absolutely delicious warm from the oven or cooled the next day. In the refrigerator, the glaze firms up nicely but remains soft enough to slice.

Excellent recipe.  I didn't have a bundt pan, so made it in a 9-inch springform pan.  I should have cut the cooking time, and actually took it out at about 35 minutes. The top was cracked, but that settled a bit after cooling. I think cutting the time for a springform pan to about 25-30 minutes would have kept it more moist. A great recipe, nonetheless. Dense & rich.

This cake is simply delicious! Rich, moist and sophisticated taste.
I followed the exact baking time and temperature. The toothpick came out wet but the cake was firm, silky and perfect when we cut it the next day.
I reduced the portions of the wine and butter for the glaze. After completely cool it was creamy and thick.

Made this cake yesterday morning, served it about 5 hours later to 9 people.  All but one liked it. It has a totally different texture than most cakes. It was a little dry.   I took it out about 5 minutes early, it tested done. Next time I will check it earlier. Also will put some glaze on it, but will drizzle most of it on as I serve it.  Glaze is fairly thin. Will also make it a day ahead, as today it seemed moister and smells heavenly.

I had a lot of fun making this cake!  Although it was incredibly sweet, I loved it.  All my friends enjoyed it as well.
