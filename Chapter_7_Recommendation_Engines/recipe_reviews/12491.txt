I have made a change with this recipe that will change the texture slightly.  I don't separate the egg whites from the yolks, and just mix in the rest of the ingredients.  Also I have found that different types of ricotta will give you different textures.  I have made hundreds of pies from this recipe without a complaint from one person.

Nice light and fluffy filling, but I have to cut down on the eggs.  I've tried this a number of times and my best results were using 4 egg whites and two yokes.  6 egg yokes is too strong an egg flavor in the cheese.  Folding in the egg whites separately is great idea.

As I Irish girl I took this to my husband's Italian family (all great cooks) and it was the biggest hit of the Easter Dinner.  They love Ricotta pie but said this was the best because it was light and had all the great flavor.

This was a really terrific recipe.  The light lemon flavor was just perfect.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!  I cut a corner and used a premade pie shell.  Next time I look forward to making the crust as well!

by adding a small container of mascapone cheese(its the italian version of cream cheese) to the recipe and you will get the texture of the orginal ricotta pie that you would get up north in boston. I have made it like this now for years and it is the same as what I buy when I go up to Boston and go to the bakerys. If you are making this you also need a hardy crust that holds up to the ricotta pie. I use eggs, flour, shortening  and the other basic ingredients for a pie crust. Linda fl

I was expecting a creamy pie, but ended up with a sweet quiche; although, the flavor was great.

Having never made a ricotta pie before i was excited to try this recipe.  It might have turned out just as it should, but I thought the results left a lot to be desired.  Oh well.

When you go to a 4th of July family reunion with a bunch of Italians you want to bring something they'll enjoy. My Aunt Teresa (one of the matriarchs of our family) couldn't believe her eyes when she saw Ricotta Pie on the table. She just HAD to have a slice. She absolutely LOVED it and asked for the recipe. I was the talk of the reunion because they just couldn't believe I knew how to make Ricotta Pie (they hadn't had Ricotta Pie since the elders in our family passed away).  THANKS for making me so proud of where I come from and for making my family so proud of me.

This turned out wonderful.  I made it for a Mother's Day brunch.  Everyone loved it.  I cheated and used a ready made pie crust and it still turned out great!

VERY good!  It does require a rather large pie plate because there was some left over.  Next time I'll try not separating the eggs so it's not quite so fluffy.  Great recipe!

Loved this pie! It was light and fluffy and had just a hint of lemon flavor. I used 5 jumbo eggs instead of the 6 that the recipe called for. I also doubled the sugar because I could tell from tasting the uncooked filling that it would not be sweet enough for me. The crust was perfect. I usually dislike pie crust, but this crust was just the right texture and the sugar and lemon zest gave it a really nice flavor. I only used 1 teaspoon of zest in the crust because it was too much work to get the zest from the small lemon I had. And this pie filling does rise quite a bit, so make sure you don't overfill. I had a good amount of filling left over, so I put it in the fridge and ate it later as a pudding.

This is delicious! I will definately keep on making this one. The only advice I give is to make sure the pie is COMPLETELY cooled in the fridge or you will have some whey in the bottom. Thank you for sharing this.

After reading the other reviews, I decided to cut down on the number of eggs that were whipped, as I was looking for a denser pie.  I used 4 egg whites (vs. 6) and this pie was VERY eggy, with almost no flavor of the ricotta cheese.

I thought the flavor was lovely, but the texture wasn't what I was looking for.  I was looking for the dense, cheesecake-like ricotta pies; this was very fluffy and eggy, like a quiche.  Maybe I did something wrong; or maybe it's just a regional variation.

i really enjoyed this, but it was somewhat grainy and not a favorite of the gang.  i will try it again, though! (i made a crust of almond flour, butter, and raw coconut, which was delicious.)

I made this for a small family get together.  Everyone loved it except me.  I thought the texture was a little grainy and not like other ricotta pies I've had in the past.  I think that maybe the egg substitute I had to use for dietary reasons could have been the cause.  Other than the "grainy" texture, the pie tasted good.

I followed the recipe, but the ricotta filling seemed too loose so I added a little more ricotta.  Unfortunately, I didn't add more sugar so it lacked a little.

I was very careful adding the ricotta to the pie shell because I didn't want it to overflow, but I think I could have put more in.

I brushed the top pie crust with eggs so it was shiny/had nice color.  I also dusted with powdered sugar.

I would make this again and tweak it just a little bit.

Following the advice from many of the reviews, I cut down the eggs to 4 egg whites and 3 egg yolks. This created exactly the texture I was looking for. But it wasn't zippy enough for me, so I tripled the lemon juice for the second batch -- PERFECT!

Reminds me of my Nana's recipe, but creamier. Similar to other reviewers, I also don't separate the eggs since I like a denser pie. I've also made with orange zest and chocolate pieces for something a little different. This recipe is  keeper!

As two other reviewers, I added a small container (8oz) of mascarpone cheese (Italian cream cheese) and didn't separate the eggs. Just beat cheeses then beat in eggs and add rest of ingredients. This time I cheated, used ready made pie crust (9 inch). Made two pies. If you've ever had ricotta pie you will love this recipe. Very close to the pies I bought at a Pittsburgh bakery.

Very similar to my Grandmother's recipe. I change this a little and added pineapple. SUPER!! Got many compliments.
