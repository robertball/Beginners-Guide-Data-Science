These were delicious.  To those who had trouble getting the sauce to stick to the ribs, try this: put the plain ribs (meat side up, seasoned with salt & pepper) on a rack in a roasting pan.  Cover them super tight with foil, and bake an hour and fifteen minutes at 350.  This will get them nice and tender.  Then, remove them from the pan, drain the fat out of the bottom of the pan, and put the ribs back in the pan (with no rack this time).  Cover them with the cooked sauce, and bake them again, uncovered, for 35 minutes.  The meat will fall off the bone, and the sauce will be thick and yummy.  I do this with pretty much every sauce I try on my ribs, and it really works.  Yum yum yum.  These were so loving, thanks for the recipe!!

I thought this was a really good recipe. I cooked the spareribs in the oven on 350 for about 45 mins, then I put them in the crockpot with sauce on low for 5 hours. Maybe a little less vinegar or a little more brown sugar but otherwise great.

Everybody loved these ribs and wanted the recipe.  The sauce was a bit thick, so I thinned it with some fruit juice I had in the fridge.  You could use any fruit juice for this.  Definitely a keeper!

These ribs are awesome!  I cook them in the crock pot though - on low for about 8 hours (layer, layer, layer), and then serve over rice.... delicious!  I quadrupled recipe for a luau party last year, and fed about 25 people with plenty of leftovers! Everyone asked for the recipe! Also, there's a recipe on this site for "Hawaiian Coleslaw", which is a great complimentary side dish.

I thought this was a 4, but my wife said definately a 5. Changed a couple of things; used 1/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup of my favorite barbecue sauce and upped the brown sugar to 4 Tbs. I let the sauce cool, then let meat set in the sauce about 3 hours before baking.  Very tender and tangy and easy to make.

If you like sweet and sour with a Hawaiian flair, this is definitely for you. The meat is so tender it just falls off the bone...my mom used to make this when I was little but had lost the recipe. Thank you so much for sharing this and bringing back so many memories for me!!!

I made these for a luau-themed Christmas party and loved them!  I had never done ribs at all before and yet found this recipe to be super-easy.  I did follow the instructions for cooking ribs in general left in one comment (cooking the meat, covered, by itself for an hour and a half before adding the sauce).  Even my husband who claims to dislike all things barbecue or "sweet meat" really liked these - he's asking me to make them again already!

Just made it for a luau surprise party and everyone loved it!!!! Will make it again. We ended making this recipe x'5 and they were almost all gone. People took copies of the recipe home. We put them in a roaster and cooked them for 4 hrs and they were falling off the bone. Would recommend to everyone!

These were a hit at my Luau Party!  I followed the advice of another rating that said to bake the ribs for the first 1.5 hours on a rack in the roaster and they were indeed "fall off the bone" good!  the sauce was FANTASTIC!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

So good!  The only change I made was substituting  low sodium teriyaki for the soy sauce and cutting down just a bit on the vinegar.  The sauce was so rich and thick, almost like a jam.  The aroma was incredible.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

WOW!! These Spareribs are incredible!!! I absolutely love Pineapple so I knew I would love this recipe. I was right!! It was easy and absolutely decadent!! My only complaint was that I let it cook a little too long and ruined my roaster because of the sauce. I won't complain too loudly because it was my own fault. The ribs are awesome!!

I took the advice of some of the reviewers and tweeked the recipe some.  I added 1 T more ginger, 1T more soy sauce 2T basalmic vinegar, 2T brown sugar (my can of crushed pineapple was 14.5oz) and 1T Sriracha hot chili sauce.  It got the recipe a sweet, salty, spicy thing going on.  I left the ribs on the bone and cooked it just like the recipe said.  Although I was able to serve the ribs like steaks, the meat fell off t he bones, the flavor was incredible!  Sweet, Salty, Spicy! Yum!

My family and I enjoyed this recipe as an alternative to the typical barbque sauce.  I made the sauce as written with the addition of a little honey.  I cut my ribs into portions, sprinkled with salt and pepper and browned in vegetable oil on both sides.  I put the browned ribs in my slow cooker, covered with sauce and cooked on low 6 hours.  I transferred the ribs to a foil lined baking sheet and thickened the sauce on the stove top using a little Wondra, basted the ribs with the thickened sauce and broiled them briefly.  The ribs were fall off the bone tender.  I'd make ribs again using this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I took the others advice by putting it in the slow cooker for 8 hours.  I didn't add the corn starch until the very end and according to my husband it was delicious.  This recipe is a keeper.

My boyfriend is Hawaiian and loves ribs. So when I saw the title here, I went for it. I used country style spareribs, cut into chunks and maybe used a little more brown sugar and ginger, but they were SO good! Thank you!

Very tasty and tender.  Next time I will bake them on a broiling pan for the first hour or so to get rid of much of the fat, then add the sauce for the remainder of the cooking time.

I only really used the sauce. I sauteed some porkchops and then started with the vinegar to deglaze the pan and then added in the other ingredients. I did not need the cornstarch because of the leftover flour in the pan from the porkchops and I let it reduce down a little by simmering it was great.  I highly recommend the ginger it helps the overall flavor

As written, this recipe is pretty good; however I only used 1/4 cup Ketchup (a 1/2 cup seemed like it would be too much for my tastes). Next time I make it (and I will make it again), I will cut out the ketchup and use tomato paste (2 tbsp) instead. Also I will add about 1/2 cup pineapple juice in addition to the crushed pineapple (I really wanted a bit of a stronger pineapple flavor). All in all this is a great recipe that can be tweaked to a person's liking. I used pork country style ribs (I dislike dealing with rib bones).

They were not very flavorful which was surprising since the smelled so good.  They were also hard to eat; a lot of work to get off the bone.  We won't be making these again.  Very disappointed.

This was a nice change to regular bbq.  The sweet and sour taste was perfect for my luau.  I only had country style ribs, so once the meat fell off the bone I made sandwiches using Hawaiian bread.  Yummy!  I did make some other changes.  First, I made this in a crockpot (too hot to turn on my oven) and cooked on low for 8 hours.  Then, I used 2 cans of pineapple, bbq sauce in place of ketchup, couple dashed of cayenne, and added a little more cornstarch in the middle of cooking to thicken.  I will make this again.  Thank you!  This is great with any slow cooked pork!

I'm a beef ribs person so I stepped out of my norm on this one. All in all it will be made again in my house, it went over well. I did however think it had too much of a cornstarch taste to it and will add alittle less next time but to counteract that the first time I made it I added bottled bbq sauce and pineapple juice to the sauce which cooked MUCH faster than stated. I also baked my ribs in applejuice,  I served this with a rice veggie blend an it was very good.

These ribs were diffrent but good & it was a nice change from the usuall bbq ribs. I used another reviewer's advise to get the sauce to stick & cooked the ribs alone for an hour or so then added the sauce & cooked it for another 35 min. They were really good! Next time though I think I will try these in the crock pot. I think the sauce will soak into the meat a little better that way!

Good ribs, I enjoyed the sauce, but I do agree with another reviewer who said it was a little lacking in depth.  I decreased the vinegar a bit and added a little chili sauce and cayenne to give it a kick, and I did use the fresh ginger too, but it tasted like it was missing something.  Next time I'll add some barbecue sauce to replace some of the ketchup, increase the soy sauce and brown sugar, and add a bit more spice.  Definitely very tasty, and worth making (with a few tweaks) again.  I'd like to try them on the grill.

This recipe is so similar to the one my dad picked up in Hawaii while stationed there. This is definitely one of the best rib recipes around. I plan on making it alot.

Yummy ribs, sweet yet tangy, easy to make. If you want something other than bbq ribs this is wonderful. My husband really liked the ribs.

Super easy, super success with my family we loved it, I did use Espresso balsamic vinegar(this was the only change I made to the original recipe) which I felt would be a great addition and it was.  This dish was great served with mashed potatoes and Tropical Salad with Pineapple Vinaigrette.

This was good. I put the ribs in my pressure cooker with the sauce from this recipe plus 1/4 cup of water for 15 minutes.  It was good.  Next time, I might only do 12 minutes in the pressure cooker!! :)

Maybe I was expecting more flavor?  I ended up putting the cooked ribs in with my crockpot ham and that marinade made these taste GREAT.

I thought these were really great ribs. The meat literally slides right off the bone. The sauce was a different taste for us, but we enjoyed it. I may try this method of baking the ribs with our favorite BBQ sauce next time.

I spiced it up with some Stubb's Mesquite Smokey BBQ sauce, some more soy sauce and brown sugar. Turned out delicious and everybody raved about them. They disappeared off the table FAST. Great dish.

This recipe was so easy to make and the spareribs were so yummy! I marinated the spareribs overnight and my boyfriend cooked them on the grill instead of in the oven.  They turned out to be perfection!

I had high hopes for this dish, but I was somewhat disappointed.  When the ribs were done, the sauce did not stick to the ribs and everything appeared quite liquidy.  I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong.  Will try this again to see if I can work this recipe out.

The sauce was excellent!  Due to the fat content in the ribs, I would render off the fat first as suggested by Button Love.  Thanks for sharing, this is a nice alternative to the same old bbq ribs.

I didn't really care for these but my family and guests did. I was expecting more of a barbecue-y taste but it was more like a sweet and sour sauce. Also the crushed pineapple made it visually unappealing. I think I will just try it with the juice if I make them again.

Used the instant pot to reduce cooking time and pots to clean. 10 min on manual cook after first making the sauce. Didn’t adjust amounts at all. Then browned in the oven with half the sauce. It’s finger licking good. Used 3# baby back pork ribs.

It turned out pretty good.
I used boneless country style ribs instead of the spare ribs.
I might try marinating the ribs in the liquid and then add the pineapple to the sauce before putting them in the oven.

I made a few adjustments that other users recommended and I loved it! Also, I cut the recipes in half and there was a ton of sauce left over, still. It seems thick, but as it bakes it thins out. I used bbq sauce instead of ketchup, added balsamic vinegar (1 tbsp for half recipe, double for full), extra brown sugar (2 tbsp for half recipe, 4 for full), 1 minced clove of garlic, red wine vinegar instead of regular vinegar, and definitely use the fresh ginger (it makes it amazing). Also, make sure to let it marinate in the sauce for a bit and cut slices into your meat to help the sauce infuse into it. Super loved this! Thank you!

Made these ribs on the grill, adding the sauce to the ribs during the last 40 minutes. Used 1/4C bbq sauce and 1/4C catsup. Good stuff, but would like more pineapple flavor.

A great receipe and very easy to do. Can't wait to make this again. I suggest using a pyrex dish as the ribs can almost stew in sauce.

Good but not great.  It was very bland, next time I would season the meat and maybe not leave the foil on the whole time, but let it brown a little so it isn't so lacking in texture.  I would also add a little cayenne and not layer the ribs to make sure the bottom ribs were as flavorful as the top row. I would make again, just revamp it.

I was disappointed. There was no depth of flavor. I used chili sauce (kicked up ketchup)instead of plain ketchup and fresh ginger but had to add garlic, steak sauce, more soy sauce which did seem to help but it really just tasted like the plain ol' polynesian sauce my dad used in the 70's. It was boring.

I was looking for a recipe to please my 3 kids.  They loved it.  I took some advice and cooked the meat, drained it and then added the sauce.  The ginger completes the sauce, I would have never thought of adding it.  My kids wanted me to make it again the next night.  Finger licking good!
