Good with a few changes. Use a full cup apricots, and slivered blanched almonds. Increase turmeric  to 1 teaspoon and the cinnamon to a heaping teaspoon. The heaping teaspoon of cinnamon gives a nice warmth to the salad, last but not least make sure to serve a room temp right after making. Flavors get more mellow after chilling or aging.

This just didnt have a lot of flavor.  I like all the ingredients so I may make it again adding more spices to increase the flavor.

I loved this one.  I doubled the spices and substituted cranberries for the apricots.  I'm making a big batch for my daughter's wedding!

I love barley and apricots and almonds and yogourt, but found this salad bland. I followed the recipe exactly, apart from slightly decreasing the lemon juice and doubling the cinnamon and turmeric, as other reviewers suggested. I was expecting to love it, but found the result disappointing.

This dish tasted fine, but wasn't anything too special.  I suggest you halve the recipe when you first try it, because it makes quite a lot, and you may end up getting tired of it even if you're not the only one in the house interested in eating it (as I was).

This salad was good, but I think I will try dicing the onions also, or just leave them out.  I was out of nutmeg, so I added some allspice, which was very good.  I might also try using vanilla yogurt instead of plain mixed with honey and lemon.

This was very bland. I  added some salt and spices and that did not help. Tasted a bit like oatmeal with fruit. It might be good as a sweet dish adding more honey and no onions but there are other recipes that are better.

Very good salad.  Next time, I'll dice the onions rather than slice and double the spices.  It's a keeper.

A great healthy, hearty flavorful salad. I made the barley in my rice cooker (1 cup barley, 2 cups water, normal rice cooker setting) which saved me a lot of time and labor making this super easy. I reduced the other ingredients by about 1/3 as well. Because it's barley based, it is much more filling than I expected so one person won't need much! Definitely a keeper recipe!

A very tasty dish!  Though the lemon was a little strong, so maybe doubling the spices would be could, as the other reviews suggested, or just cutting down on the juice a little.  My lemon was quite large though, maybe that was it.  All in all it was very good!  More parsley would definitely be good.

I doubled the recipe and did not have enough dried apricots.  So, I used dried cranberries AND dried apricots.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I was making this for my company's fundraiser, and had refrigerated the main mix, without the yogurt and spice mixture.  When I was preparing it the next day, I realized my husband, who usually leaves my "projects" alone in the fridge, had helped himself to a generous serving.  This, apparently,  is delicious with, or without the yogurt and spices!

Really enjoyed this salad as a change of pace.  Used dried cranberries instead of apricots and omitted the parsley.  Nice combination of flavors.  I was a little skeptical about combining sweet and savory i.e. cinnamon and onions, but it's a great combination.

This was a big hit at dinner, and it was even better as left-overs once all the flavors melded together.  The only thing I did differently was cook the barley in vegetable stock instead of water.  The vegetable stock add just a little extra dimension to the barley

It was okay.  I used an entire lemon and should have used 2 Tbsp of lemon juice.  It was rather bland and a bit runny.  I would not make this again but it's okay to eat once.

Interesting flavour - it was bland at first but I doubled the spices and it got better. I might make again but it doesn't really hold a candle to a good pilaf. Made a TON, but it makes great leftovers so that's alright!

Nice flavor!  I took the advice of the other reviewers and doubled the spices - I'm glad I did!  It was a nice change of pace from the usual meal, but I don't think it's something I'll make frequently.

I like that this recipe is different than the types of foods I typically make, but I don't think it's delicious.  It was good and a nice alternative, but I'm pretty sure I won't make it again.

I LOVE this recipe.  So tasty.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I added some dried parsley and chives for color.  I also doubled the spices for extra kick.  This is a new staple for me.  Great for taking to work for a yummy and very healthy lunch.

I would make it again but with a few adjustments. First of all, boil the barley with the salt. Secondly, leave out the cinnamon and nutmeg. These two spices are not appropriate for this dish. I would add a little cayenne or black pepper to give it a little kick and that would pair nicely with the turmeric.  I juiced half of the lemon.

Not bland at all, just don't know why the turmeric didn't really make it yellow. I left out nutmeg because I forgot it, but can't imagine it being any better than it was. There were quite a few things I didn't have on hand, but now I've made it once, next time will be smoother.
