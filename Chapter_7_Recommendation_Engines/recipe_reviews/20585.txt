I was very disappointed in this recipe. Ipayed 24 dollors for a pound of crab meat and we really couldn't eat it because it was way to salty...I think the bay seasoning was the culpret....anyways the crab ball didn't get eaten on christmas eve....I followed the directions verbatum

The amount of seasoning has been changed! It has been decreased to 1/2 teaspoon. Increase the amount to taste. Happy Cooking!

This was the best appetizer.  It made two good size balls.  The crab was not hidden by a lot of filler like most crab appetizers I had.  I made it for a family gathering and they were falling all over themselves to have some.  Another great recipe that will show up again at my family gatherings.

I found this recipe to be a very mellow blend of flavors, but seemed to lack something. I added two tablespoons of sweet pickle relish which gave the crab taste a little more zing.I served with Italian panetini.

YOu could use half shrimp with this recipe.  After I had mixed it, I increased the horseradish a little and added the juice of half a lemon.  Very, very nice.

This is so tasty, I made up extras and gave them as Xmas gifts on a pretty plate wrapped in plastic wrap!  1 pound of crab meat will make 2 huge balls.   I added a bit more horse raddish, more Old Bay and a dash or two of hot sauce to spice it up a bit.  It's better if it has been in the fridge overnight to let the onions and seasonings seep in to the crab mix.  Yummy!

Very good and easy recipe. I like it a little heavier on the old bay seasoning. Went very well at a party.

I forgot Old Bay so used California Bay seasoning and it tasted great. Used 3 green onions and it was perfect. Really delicious and everyone loved it!

I cut the recipe in half and made only one ball. This was easy to make and tasted amazing served on crackers. Great party appetizer.

A little bland as is. We used 1/2# of crab n added about 1/4 tsp of the garlic salt and it was perfect!

As written, this recipe isn't very good.  I had to keep tasting and adding more seasoning to it.  We also added fresh parsley into the mix as well as garnishing the top (just put in a dish instead of making balls) and it was good.  Will make again with modifications but not as is.

Love this recipe... we had so much crab meat left over from crab cakes the other night, I really didn't want to waste it - Although, I did make my own changes which ended up being a huge hit... I stuck with the basic recipe but I also added cayenne pepper and parsley to the crab itself- for the topping after they were cooled instead of the Old Bay, I toasted some sliced almonds and topped it with 4 cheese Italian cheese and some garlic... then rolled them up!  Added some black pepper and olive oil Triscuits and viola! Quick, easy and tasty dinner!
