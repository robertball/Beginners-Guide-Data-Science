Fabulous and decadent.  The flavors were quite sweet, so you'll want to consider that in selected side dishes that will compliment and balance it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the rcipe pretty closely and it all turned out super deliscious!  I did leave some of the filets in the oven a bit longer because the wife and a couple of the kids "cant have any pink meat"-lol.  The strawberry sauce was not overpowering but did add a very nice compliment to the steaks. (which could have stood on their own)

Good - interesting!  I went back to get more strawberries after everyone had started eating, and those bites were better.  So, maybe I should have let the sauce sit a minute.  I think this would be really tasty over white fish.

I wasn't sure I'd like this, but it's superb - made it for Valentine Day and again the next day because it was so good. The only thing I changed the second time was using canola oil rather than olive oil in the skillet when it went into the oven.  I found that the first time I made it, the olive oil had a tendency to burn at 400 degrees. The second time I made it I used canola oil and it didn't burn. I'm only making 1/2 the recipe because I'm feeding 2 so perhaps that was the difference.

This was a delicious alternative to our usual steak. We grilled the steak w some steak seasoning. I did not add any juices to the strawberries but reduced strawberries w vinegar/sugar and drizzled over the steaks with  some feta on top. Delicious.

Sorry, my review sent before i could finish it. As i said before, the whole family found this recipe to be decadent and delicious. However, I meant to also add to my review that we had a small problem getting enough left over filet juices to constitute a sauce, so in addition to the filet juices we retained some of the balsamic juice that the strawberries were marinated in, and reduced that down to complete the sauce. It was a bit on the sweet side, but as I said before, I'm a lover of sweet sauces when paired with a tender filet.

Made this recipe for my wife for Valentine's Day. I didn't strain the strawberries either so I have a lot of leftover sauce, which went PERFECTLY with the steak. I will definitely make this again on a special occasion!

I added red wine to the meat & marinated it in wine, & roasted garlic olive oil sat & pepper.  I only added 1/4 cup of red wine & should have looked harder for a really high end cut of tender steak!  We used Bison Fillet (tough & chewy) despite being grass fed!! . I also used high end Balsamic & the delicate flavors were scrumptious!!!

This was just okay to my husband & I.  We love a good steak and trying new toppings.  This wasn't terrible but also not something we would have again.

We cooked the steak on a charcoal grill with a broiler tray. It didn't provide any juice, but the strawberry/steak combo were great without it. Easy and great!
