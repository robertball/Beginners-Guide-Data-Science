This year we had a new addition to our Christmas dinner table - my daughter's boyfriend, a Norwegian.   She passed along to me  that for Norwegians, Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without Norwegian meatballs and lefse, and tho' I wanted to make his first Christmas away from home special, I knew nothing about either. After much research looking at a zillion different recipes, I finally arrived at "special order" lefse and this recipe for Norwegian meatballs. This was a challenge for me with our Italian traditions - this was not my idea of a meatball and I was apprehensive they'd never compare to his mom's and grandma's. And the fact that this was a profound part of their Christmas tradition was not lost on me.  I was nervous.  We kept the meatballs and lefse a secret until we were all seated and I'm telling you, I will never forget his reaction when he learned he would not be without them - darn near brought tears to my eyes, the truth be told.  Even more profound was the genuine look of pure pleasure and delight as he was eating them.  But for those of you simply interested in knowing how these meatballs tasted - he pronounced them delicious and exactly what he was used to!  High praise indeed from a Norwegian that this recipe, these meatballs, are the real deal.

I absolutely love this recipe!  The only change I made was to extend the cook time about 5 minutes.  My husband raves about these meatballs, and that's coming from someone who's mother is Norwegian and grew up on them.  This recipes makes a lot of meatballs.  I froze a bunch with a little bit of the gravy in small freezer-safe containers...they thaw perfectly.  This dish is normally served with boiled/baked potatoes.

Thank You, Jeane!  This is a 30+* recipe if I ever tasted one!  My dyslexia kicked in so I put 1 pound of beef and 2 pounds of pork.  However, my Beloved Personal Food Critic (a.k.a Hubby) took a very tentative bite out of these and said "YUM!" (and promptly finished 30 of the little suckers in one sitting!)  High praise, indeed!  And, I could swear I heard my Norwegian grandmother clap and cheer from her Final Resting Place because I am finally starting to master her recipes (or ones similar to them) (but it could have been the cats smacking each other and Merping in surprise whenever they got wallopped).  Either way, it's an awesome, and simple (although rolling over 160 little balls took forever) recipe!  Next time I might just half the recipe (Now I need to think of how to freeze them ... Thanks again! :D

These were so wonderful!I only used beef and they still turned out so delicious! Even my two year old neice who hates meat loved them and keeps asking for more "cow". I will definately be making them again.

Very tasty. I used more roux, cream and a bit more spices though. I like lots of sauce :) I also used onion powder in place of actual onions (was being lazy) tasted good!

This recipe was totally awesome!  I adjusted it a bit due to certain things I had on-hand vs what was called for in the recipe... I had no fresh onions so I used onion powder and I used italian bread crumbs.  Also, I baked the meatballs in a 375 oven on two separate baking sheets.  I used half & half instead of cream and it turned out wonderfully.  I had no all-spice so I used ground cloves.    My kids and husband loved it.  We served it on top of 3/4" pieces of boiled potato.  I pan-seared some fresh asparagus with garlic powder and coarse ground salt and served it alongside and put a couple tablespoons of lingonberry preserves on the plate.  Mmmmmmm good.    This will be a staple recipe for the colder months of the season.  Everyone raved about it.  Thanks!

Delicious! I used two pounds of ground beef - not two pounds plus one pound of ground pork - forgot the sugar (Oops) -  but these are wonderful, wonderful! Made plenty - we may have meatballs in Pita pckets tomorrow. Yummy!

I'm not Norwegian and I've never been to Norway, but these are ah-mah-zing!  I used just pork because that's what I had.  So delicious!  I could have used a little more of the spices and will next time, but we prefer bold flavors in our house.  The gravy is delicious, I use it for other things. (Try it with minced mushroom thrown in with the onion)

I only had 1/2 & 1/2 so I used that in place of the heavy cream.  I added a pince of each spice to the sauce as well and it was excellent!  Thank you!

I made this last night.  My family loved it -- said it was "something different" -- which is a good thing.  I didn't have heavy cream though, so I used a little half'n'half and some cream cheese -sounds weird, but it's good.

This is very good, we like our meatballs a little more well done, so I started the sauce once the meatballs cooked for 20 minutes and that seemed to be perfect, I think it was probably about 30 minutes cooking time.  The reason this is a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because my 2 year old grand daughter who loves meatballs didn't like these, she loved the gravy and noodles, but didn't care for the meat.

This sounds delicious but I must admit that I am Norwegian and I have never heard of anyone ever eating this on the 17th of may! We eat hot-dogs and candy-floss, the most traditional 17th of may meal must be cured meats with a porridge made from sour cream. Meatballs are a lot more popular in Sweden, we like them bigger and call them 'Kjøttkaker' - directly translated : meatcakes! :)

This is good - serious comfort food. I enjoyed the meatballs much more than the gravy, which was a little bland (but I think its supposed to be). I found myself wanting to add herbs to it, and probably would do more of that next time. As it was, I threw chopped parsley all over everything and enjoyed it very much. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I made these for a cast party for a play about a Norwegian family.  I didn't have any allspice, but added cloves.  It still gave them that unique flavor.  I also added part sour cream, part heavy cream instead of all heavy cream.  Everyone loved them!

These were very, very yummy!  I only had 2lbs ground beef, so I scaled everything.  I didn't use allspice or ginger either.  I added nutmeg, increased the flour to 4 tbsp and used evaporated milk for the sauce.  It was very yummy on shell noodles!

The sauce was a little rich....next time I will use EVO instead of butter and maybe sour cream in place of heavy cream.  But all in all a great meal.

Taste like a good version of the Swedish meatballs you get at Ikea. For best flavor use a good homemade broth, feel free to add some herbs to the broth if you are using a store bought one.

Worked out great even though I used only beef for the meatballs and evaporated milk instead of cream for the sauce.

We had these with lefse.  I used cloves in lieu of nutmeg and allspice.  We all (age 4 to 60) liked the meatballs.

These are very good! I have made them a few times. The only thing is that each time I have made them, the sauce has turned out quite thin so I had to add some more roux to thicken it up. I followed the recipe as written aside from omitting the sugar. Thanks so much for posting this!

Need a quick meal fo rdinner tonight and this fit the bill. I cheated and used frozen sweedish meatballs. but followed the gravy recipe. the only change I made there was to add a dash of frank's red hot instead of cayanne. but I don't think that changed the recipe. My kids all loved it and ate 2nds and 3rds. will be making again. using frozen meatballs, I had dinner on the table in less than 20 min. I bet the meatballs on the  recipe makes this even better.As a mom of 4 adn everyone busy with school and sports this was a lifesaver for me today! Thank you

these were really good. I'm used to the tang of meatballs with red spaghetti sauce, so this was different but delicious and rich.

Holy  this is awesome. I made this for my myself and my wife. and served it over rice. She and I were both blown away by how good this was. She is from Noway, and she says this is better than the meatballs her mother makes. I made this recipe pretty much as it's written. I fudged a little bit to use the spices I had on hand, and I just dumped everything in the pot at once to make the gravy, and I used hot Italian pork rather than regular, but it  ruled.

This recipe is now one of our favorite meals. So simple to make and even the picky eaters love it. This is now our traditional Christmas Eve meal. Thank you so much for sharing!
