This was wonderful!  I tried the double boiler and it took forever so I just cooked it over the stove with a whisk and it thickened very quickly.  Delicious.

This is a wonderful filling!  It tastes just like pudding and is very easy to make!  The only thing that I changed was that I only mixed the milk with the other mixture about halfway and then poured the whole thing into the sauce pan I was already using.  I used a whisk and mixed it well, continuing to do so on a very low heat until properly thickened.  I then finished the recipe as stated.  I used this in empanadas and it was awesome!  I'll definitely use it again!

This was very good.  I made it a second time with 1/2 cup of Heavy Cream and 1/2 cups of Whole Milk.  Much richer...very, very good.  Great filling for Boston Cream Pie.

Quel délice!!! Je cherchais depuis longtemps une recette de crème qui se marie bien avec des fruits. Facile à faire et rapide, j'ai du faire 2 tartes dans la même semaine... mon père l'a adoré ainsi que toute la famille... avec des fruits frais, c'est parfait!    Great!!! I was searching for a cream recipe that is good, easy and quick to combine with fruits. I had to make this recipe twice in the same week because of my father... he likes it and all the family... With fresh fruits, it's perfect !

We made this for the first time last night and multiplied the recipie X 4 for 2 strawberry pies. I used a little less sugar than called for and the sweetness was very good. I also added a little lemon extract in addition to the vanillia to bring out the flavor of the berries. I must not have cooked it quite long enough since the custard came out a bit runny for a pie. I will try it again and cook until a bit more solid.
Thanks.

it was an easy recipe, but it was a bit too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll try with 1/3 cup of sugar. I also didn't use the double boiler, but just put the contents back in the sauce pan and heated it on low heat instead.

Good recipe, except it was wayyyy to sweet for me. I gave it a second try with half the sugar and it was much better.

I made this as just a custard to eat. It was a little thick for that but it was just what we had been wanting in flavor. It was wonderful

My first batch took forever in the double boiler and wasn't going to be big enough to fill my pie shell. The second time around I doubled the recipe, added 2 tsp cornstarch to the flour and cooked it in the saucepan, without the double boiler. It thickened very very fast and turned out great! I used a whisk while stirring to keep it from clumping.

Fantastic! Creamy and sweet. I balked at 1 tbsp vanilla, but it's fantastic. I bet you could use heavy cream in place of milk or some combination of the two. Mmmm. I made this a second time because I had tons of leftover egg yolks from the Heavenly Angel Food Cake recipe on this site so I made double this recipe and tried different flavors. 1 tsp cocoa powder per cup of custard was the best flavor combination I found; banana and almond extract added in was just okay. I don't care much for how long it takes to thicken - 30 min for me and a lot of stirring - but anyways thanks for a great recipe!

Extremely sweet!  Would definitely cut sugar in half the next time.  I also used half-n-half in place of the milk.  

I found the cooking the combined mixture over the boiling water unnecessary and time consuming.  After about a minute I emptied the contents of the bowl back into the small saucepan and cooked the mixture on low heat - whisking constantly.  It was cooked and thickened in an instant - and smooth as silk.  I also added about a tablespoon of Gran Marnier to the cream for a bit more fun.

I used the cream between baked puff pastry squares and then proceeded with sweetened strawberries, real whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce for a fabulous dessert!

Maybe it was the brand of vanilla I used but after I added it, the cream lost it soft yellow color and I could taste the vanilla a little to much for my taste. Other than that, it was very good, fast, and easy.

YUM!  This was perfect!  I doubled the recipe to use as a filling to Heavenly White Cake (also on AR) and put fresh sliced strawberries on top of the custard in between the cake layers.  I did use cornstarch instead of flour and I didn't use the double boiler.  I just tempered the egg yolks with the hot milk mixture then added back to the pot and whisked and kept whisking and not a lump was found.  There was a bit left over and I ate the next day with the left over fresh strawberries.  So fantastic, thank you for sharing!

I used half the amount of sugar listed and half the vanilla. (seemed like a lot to me...) I think the flour gave this pudding a slightly starchy taste, so I'm going to try using half the amount of cornstarch next time.

Loved it, reduced the sugar like sugessted, lowered the vanilla to 1 teaspoon and cooked it over direct fire so that it would thicken quicker, really nice, will add bananas or other types of fruits next them

I used less sugar as per comments and used a bit less vanilla, and subbed cornstarch for the flour (what I had).  I also used a different technique.  I mixed my starch and sugar and added the milk, brought it to a boil to thicken it, mixed in a bit with the yolks and added all back to pan and cooked for another minute, adding the butter and vanilla after removing from heat.  I'm using it as a filling for Boston Cream Pie.

I followed the recipe exactly, and even cooked the mixture longer than 2 minutes after "thickening" because it still had an uncooked flour smell. It didn't work; the cream has a heavy flour-y taste. I immediately tried again, cooking for the specified time and ended with an even heavier flour taste. In addition to reducing the amount of sugar you should reduce the amount of vanilla extract as well! A full tablespoon with only 1 cup of milk and 3 egg yolks darkened my cream noticably. The second try I used 1 teaspoon of vanilla and that helped, but it was still too flour-y to be edible. I will be trying a different recipe next time, with a higher milk/egg yolk-to-flour ratio.

I was looking for an easy recipe to use as a custard for chocolate tarts. This was incredibly easy and delicious. I did not use a double boiler, just heated it on the stove at a medium temperature. I added about a teaspoon of lemon juice to add a little dimension to the flavor. Perfect!
