I wish I could concur with other reviewers but I can't on this one. I followed the waffle recipe exactly. What I liked about this recipe was the use of WW pastry flour and pumpkin, and the spice seemed like a nice touch. In reality, I found them to be bland, very little pumpkin or spice flavor. They tasted very "eggy" to me. I needed more flour because the first few waffles were golden on the outside but not cooked in the middle. The cranberry relish is a unique touch, but couldn't make up for the waffles. I don't think I'll make this again as nice as idea as it is.

This is a review of the waffles only, as I did not make the relish.  Fabulous!  Wonderful flavor, easy to make, very good texture.  I made these for company, and they were very well received.  What a nice breakfast for autumn!  Next time I will serve with some saut√©ed apples.

The apple-cranberry relish was my favorite part! It was so good, we just ate it with a spoon after the waffles/pancakes were gone! I tried to make waffles but they kept falling apart when I would take them out of my waffle maker.  It's a new waffle maker, so maybe it's the cook and not the recipe.  When eating the waffles alone I thought they were not going to be sweet enough, but they were the perfect flavor when mixed with the relish. I ended up making pancakes instead.  This is going to be our Christmas morning breakfast for sure! All in all, a delicious recipe to add to my basket of tricks. Thanks for sharing Amie!

Excellent!  I used just the Apple-Cranberry Relish at Thanksgiving and it was such a hit!  I didn't alter the recipe at all except that I let the fruit sit until it soaked up the sauce.  Everyone loved it!

This waffle recipe was delicious! I skipped the fruit topping, but the waffles themselves were fantastic. Our grocery was out of pumpkin puree, so I had to use pie filling and just reduced the sugar and spice measurements to half. I also didn't have pastry flour, so I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 bread flour. Next time, I plan to reduce the oil to 1/3 C and increase the pumpkin puree to 2/3 C to reduce calories. Also, the servings on this are not accurate. I made 7 large waffles.

I made breakfast for dinner using this recipe and we loved all the components individually.  I am not 100% sure they belong together because the pumpkin flavor is overshadowed by the relish.  Both parts are outstanding on their own and I will make both again, just not necessarily together.  Thanks Amie!!

Good idea, but needs more spice.  I only made the waffles, so can't rate the relish.  Used brown sugar instead of white and used mixture of all-purpose and white whole wheat flour.  The main thing is that I doubled the spices (actually, quadrupled for a double recipe) and added Hershey's Cinnamon Chips.  As written, I think the waffles would be very bland.  Maybe that's why the relish is listed with it.?.  I would defintely recommend at least doubling the spices.  Made extra and froze them.  We just pop them in the toaster on busy mornings.  Kids love them.  Thanks for the idea!

The waffles and relish were very good.  The pumpkin flavor was too mellow for us, but they held together fine.  The relish was tasty, but a little more time-consuming than we'd usually do on a weekend.  Very pretty though and festive.  Grand Marnier and fresh cranberries were substituted for the OJ and dried cranberries.  Turned out good.  Thanks Amie!

I only made the waffles, not the relish. They stuck a little to the waffle iron, so let them cook a little longer after the light goes out.
