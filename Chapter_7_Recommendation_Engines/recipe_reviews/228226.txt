This was just OK.  It needed more salsa for flavor, and I ended up adding some taco seasoning and salt & pepper too.  Could've used more tomatoes as well.  I suppose I would make this again to use up leftover taco meat, but it needs some tweaks.

Very easy meal.  Subbed Johnsonville mild Italian sausage for the beef, Doubled up on the canned tomatoes and used tomatoes with mild green chilis and subbed mild enchilada sauce for the picante(didn't have any).  Also added some onions with the sausage as it browned. The men in the house enjoyed this!

It is Taco Tuesday so I  made this meal tonight for my family. It came out beautifully and very tasty. I read the other reviews and tweaked a little. I added a yellow union diced, taco seasoning, and a little taco sauce....
