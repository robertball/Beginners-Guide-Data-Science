First I believe there is a typo that should be noted. Naruto is a fish "cake" formed  as a log either in a plastic warp as a round tube shape or on a wooden stick but not as a "paste".
Thank you for your share I finally got it right! I didn't realize sake was used, and that makes the flavor so much better. My mom isn't around to make this any more, but now I finally can make it at home for myself. Now I never have to miss this soup ever again.
