Made this to the recipe. I did reduce the servings in the recipe. Loved the idea of the ingredients in the sauce . Could be from the reduced size but I tasted too much vinegar in the sauce and the ratio of flour to chile powder, I would reduce. This sauce was enought to cover the fish.  I may reduce the vineger, chile powder and add some pine nuts to the sauce.

Probably ok, but bland for my tastes.

My family and I thought this dish was flavorful and delicious. This dish was easy to make and I didn't put the spices into the flour. I prepared the fish with the spices and then put the fish into the flour, shook the excess flour, and pan fried as directed. It was so good and the sauce is great. I could think of other dishes I could add this sauce to. Yum!

This tomatillo sauce is incredible.  My wife and kids thought it was a little sweet but what do they know?

I choose this recipe as our introduction to cooking with tomatillos.  We liked it better on the fish than we did plain.  I added a bit more honey and the fresh parsely is a must.  Definatly worth a try
