It was okay not one of my favorites although I did not have any chia seed.  I had to add honey for sweetness.

I love avocado, but I haven't liked it in smoothies so far. If that's your thing, you may really like this. I had to add another banana and a big spoonful of honey so that I could drink it. I used frozen blueberries, and it looked really good in my cup.

I used three ice cubes because I used frozen blueberries & bananas. Also added additional almond milk because it was too thick & honey to taste.

I followed the recipe  except I used coconut almond milk and frozen blueberries.   Full of flavor  and great treat after a hike.
