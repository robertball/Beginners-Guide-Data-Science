I'm sure this is tasty, but a real b-52 is a layered shot that includes grand marnier to the other two ingredients.

Hubby's working late so I'm at home alone, doing shots & cooking. Life is good! I really liked this one...I shook it w/ some ice & poured into a mini-wine glass.

Very yummy. I mixed it in a cocktail shaker with ice and served it in a martini glass. I think next time I might try it the same way but add some banana liqueur and garnish with chocolate shavings.

I think I'd include the Grand Marnier as suggested in one of the other reviews.
