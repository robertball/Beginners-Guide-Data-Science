This is one of the better recipes I've tried for stuffed green peppers. The bacon adds a nice flavor to the dish.

Wow! I have been looking up recipes on this site for many years... this is my first review. My husband and I very much enjoy a traditional stuffed pepper.  This is something completely different... and completely amazing!!!!!! If you are a fan of BBQ flavors and lots of delicious veggie love, you will not go wrong here.
