6.2.18  Had this for lunch today and really enjoyed it.  That fresh basil and the peppery arugula is an excellent combo for a salad, the zucchini gives it a little crunch, the fresh mozzarella lends some creaminess, and the balsamic gives it some tang.  Would recommend not skipping the fresh basil and do use a good vinaigrette (I made Our Favorite Balsamic Vinaigrette from this site), both of which are important to the success of this salad.  Jeannette, thanks for sharing this new fresh salad recipe, itâ€™s a good one

Loved this fresh salad.  I used carrots, zucchini and a lettuce mix I had on hand.  It was so good.

A delicious, easy to prepare, beautiful salad.  The flavor fully depends on good balsamic and fresh basil.  I used a touch of balsamic dressing and then kicked it up with a drizzle of balsamic glaze (a reduction of balsamic).  I also used already spiralized zucchini from the grocery store, which saved tons of time.  Lastly, I didn't even follow the proportions; just eyeballed the ingredients as I threw them on a serving platter.  May lightly sprinkle some salt on the tomatoes next time to further boost the flavor. Beautiful!
