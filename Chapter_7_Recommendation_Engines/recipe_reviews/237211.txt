Put oatmeal and flax seed in blender since I planned to use it as an instant cereal.  Left out dried fruit. .Added dried fruit or banana with each serving. Used 1/2 cup of mixture with about 7/8 cup milk in microwave for 90 seconds.  Very thick.  Texture similar to malt o meal. Tastes great with stevia added.  Needs more cinnamon.
