Delicious! And that's coming from a hardcore carnivore! I've been looking for new ways to prepare tofu, since it's not something I make very often. I made sure to get all the ingredients today so I could make this for dinner. The only tofu packages I could find were 14oz. A perfect balance of flavors and the right amount of heat. I will definitely make this again. No changes needed! It comes together quickly and is perfect for a weeknight meal.

This was absolutely delicious! If you're new to cooking with tofu (like me), one thing the recipe does not mention is that you should press the tofu beforehand to remove the water. I made two changes to the recipe:  I used 2 tablespoons of peanut oil, instead of olive oil.  Instead of squash, I used Chinese eggplant along with the zucchini.  Served it with quinoa. Loved the recipe!

Yes, I will make this again!  I am trying to keep an eye on my added sugar intake, so used only 1/2 the brown sugar and loaded up the skillet with more veggies - zucchini, red bell pepper & onion.  This is an easy & quick recipe that produces really tasty tofu!

I recently bought an air fryer, so wanted to try it out.  I soaked the tofu in the sauce, then air fried it for 20 minutes at 370 with a touch of corn starch.  As it cooked, I made the veggies in a non stick pan with some extra mushrooms.  I added some ginger and some chili garlic to the left over sauce that the tofu had soaked in, and added that to the veggies when they were done.  My wife raved, and said it was up there with my best stir fries.  I can't believe we loved a vegetarian meal this much.  I will make this every 2 weeks!

A very nice combination of ingredients.  Not too hot, not too sweet, not too soy-saucy.  Mastering the art of cooking tofu has been tough, but even with half of it stuck to the bottom of the pan, the meal was delicious.

I made this twice already! The first time I made it as is. Delicious! The second time I reduced the total yellow squash and zucchini by half and added diced eggplant and sliced baby portabella mushrooms. Doubly delicious! Even my 15-year old son (who says he HATES tofu) devoured this. This is my new quick and easy go to meal!

It was really good, just a little too spicy for my taste. Either will lessen or omit the sriracha next time.

Really enjoyed this. I put half the amount of brown sugar, and think maybe next time I'll put a quarter because it was still a little too sweet. Also used a 16oz tofu package because that's all I could find, and added half an onion. Will use the base of this recipe again with other veggie combinations and tofu in the future!

So easy and tasty. The 30 min prep time was spot on . This may be our favorite recipe so far. The Sriracha sauce was a nice kick and I decided to just go with it rather that ask “K” knowing she would say to leave it out .... great meal

Delicious base recipe, we mixed up the veggies (ie. pepper, mushroom, broccoli and squash/pumpkin). 
Changes: added a splash of rice vinegar and extra splash of soy sauce.

This is an extremely good recipe as written and so easy to add to as you see fit. The soy sauce, brown sugar and sriracha mix is awesome. I like making this with more texture, so I add bean spouts and cashews to the stir fry at the end of the cooking process. Super good, one of my favorite recipes.

Very easy and simple dish.  Did not have sriracha  sauce and used a little bit of chili paste instead.  Delicious!  Will definitely make again and again. Thank you.

Made this exactly as written although I was not totally sure what 'yellow squash' was.  I chose butternut which worked fine.  I did cube the tofu and then cover with 2 layers paper towel and a weighted plate to release excess moisture.  I think that is pretty standard process if using tofu in stir fry.
For another time I will add some additional veggies like onion, red pepper or maybe jalapenos.  I thought the sauce amount was fine but doubling could work too.
This made up quickly after the veggies cut up and was a great filling vegetarian dinner.

This was excellent.  I used about five squash instead of two, doubled the sauce recipe and whisked a little cornstarch into it, and added some gnocchi.  So good!

Very good as is but I made a few simple additions... I added a red pepper for some color and thought the sauce needed a little acid so i added 1 T rice vinegar.  When it was done I found the sauce to be a little loose (possibly from the extra vinegar ;-) so I added about 2 t cornstarch mixed with a little cold water and it thickened up nicely.  Delicious!

This was a hit  all around.   Substantial enough for  the carnivores in the family too.   Sriracha sauce is too spicy for us but  a sprinkle of cayenne pepper did the trick.  A few stir fried sweet onions topped it off.   
This is so easy and straight forward.  I'll be making this again.

Very simple to make and very tasty! I squirted a tiny amount of sriracha sauce because I was worried it would come out too spicy. I would highly recommend making this - easy/quick for dinner!

Very tasty! I made it to the T the first time and it was very good.  The second time I sautéed onions first and added broccoli because I didn't have enough zucchini, and it was still great! This is a keeper! It not only is healthier but it helps save money by not having to buy meat for this meal.

Excellent recipe. I used honey in place of the sugar because I have to limit sugar. Even with the honey (use less because it is sweeter) it comes together great. I added some soba noodles and onion.

I love this recipe but was looking for something without sugar. So I added some local honey instead and it's delicious! I also opted for low sodium soy.

So yummy that I didn't want to stop eating it. I used two small zucchini and some broccoli that had to go as well as a few kale leaves from the garden. Will make again!

I know this is a vegetarian dish, but I made this with chicken breast cut into bit size pieces instead. This was just as delicious and I also added 1 full onion, carmelized. Flavors are great and can also work well over rice.
