Twas delish!  No peppers, didn't have any.  Not sure I would have wanted them in ours anyways.  Did not deviate from the recipe. Well, other than slight cooking time adjustments, but that's sort of a no brainer.  Different stoves/ovens/pans...duh. :)   Was especially nice cuz we happened to have all sorts of rogue cheese in our fridge.  Asiago and provolone were two of them.  And everything else was under roof,  or in the garden.  Happy dance!!!

This was good - made for dinner though and Grumpy felt it should be for breakfast.  ;)  I think he doesn't know you can eat an "eggy" meal anytime of the day!  I used the ground italian sausage instead of the links and added mushrooms and spinach to the mix!

Such a delicious recipe! I needed to keep it in the oven for a few minutes longer and at a greater temperature (I broiled it towards the end), but otherwise the fritatta was delish!

Delicious.....I again used leftovers for this... grilled Italian sausage, peppers and onions. I used provolone, part skim mozz, and pecorino romano. I also decreased the eggs to 8 and added about 1/2c of fat free half and half. Thanks!

This made a delicious addition to our Sunday brunch!  After browning the sausage, I did cut the "coins" into quarters, as I knew I'd prefer a smaller bite.  I also added some milk to the egg mixture to give it some fluff.  Broiled it for about 2 minutes in the end, just to give the top a nice crust.  My Italian hubby said it's a "do again" recipe!

This was pretty good. I halved the recipe, but otherwise followed the recipe except for using lower fat Johnsonville Pork & Chicken Italian sausage.  I did find the frittata to be sightly tough/rubbery, so next time I think I'll add in some cream or half and half with the egg mixture to make it creamier.  It definitely took longer than 6-10 mins in the oven to finish cooking. I ended up finishing it under the broiler to get the middle to set, since the edges were getting too dark.  I also diced the asiago into smaller pieces than stated, since asiago lends a stronger flavor.

I only had 5 eggs so I halved the recipe and it was still good, just not as thick.  The different cheese add to flavor.

This was my first time making a frittata.  I love how I can make a big batch of it once and then have breakfast for the week.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, making minor substitutions based on what I had in the house.  The oven time definitely seems a bit off in the instructions.  I had it in the oven for 18 minutes and it probably could have gone another 2.  Overall, a quick and tasty meal.

I made this with a number of changes.  I thought 4 links of sausage was a bit much, so I used two, which I thought was plenty.  Instead of cutting them into coins, I removed the casings and crumbled them into a skillet to cook.  I believe the quantities of green onion and red bell pepper in this recipe are reversed.  I think it should be 1/4 cup green onions and 1 cup of red bell peppers, so that’s what I did.  I used a mix of red, yellow and orange peppers for more color.  Instead of asiago cheese, I used parmesan, and I used part shredded mozzarella/provolone blend, along with some sharp cheddar.  I baked this in a 11x7” baking dish which worked well and cut it into 6 largish servings.  I froze it in individual servings so Hubs can grab one for breakfast and pop it in the microwave.  Good and flavorful, although a little rubbery.  I might add some liquid next time or cut back on the cheese.

I've made this recipe so many times now.  It's fun to add different veggies and sausages for variety.  We are fans of Kiolbassa jalapeño sausage, but when the refrig is light, a throw-down staple item like Jimmy Deans works just as well as the Italian sausage.** Make sure you don't overcook or leave it in the pan.  I noticed that many thought it was tough or rubbery and that's probably because it was overcooked.

Delicious! I had to do mine a little different b/c I do not have a pan that can be used in the oven...I cooked the sausage (I used a mix of mild anf hot, which I removed from the casing), peppers, onions and garlic, and then set that aside. I then mixed the eggs and a nice splash of milk (habit, lol), in the blender to make sure it was thoroughly mixed. I poured the egg mixture into a bowl and added all of the other ingredients, except for the thyme b/c we do not care for it. I sprayed a casserole dish, poured in the egg mixture and baked @ 375 degrees for about 30 minutes, or so...Perfect, fluffy and flavorful! This is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was an excellent dish. Made this for a housewarming get together and it was a hit. I used spicy italian sausage to spice it up a bit. I will experiment with this recipe, definitely a keeper.
