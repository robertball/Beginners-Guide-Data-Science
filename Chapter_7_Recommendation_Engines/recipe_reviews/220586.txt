I love gnocchi and cheese but this recipe was just ok.  The cheese sauce needed something else to liven it up.  Surprisingly my husband liked it more than me but I don't think either of us will be in a hurry to make again.

For the most part I followed the recipe.  I took the Italian sausage out of the casings and made small meatballs.  I was out of milk so I used half and half too.  This was a nice fast dinner once I paired it with a spinach salad. My fourteen year old liked the 1st helping but then didn't know if she liked the gnocchi. Flavor was great so I will serve this again and again until she likes gnocchi.  I would put yellow and red pepper in next time to make the flavor pop a bit and give it some visual appeal.  Don't forget to to use a bit of freshly ground pepper to the finished product.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is rich and delicious! I roasted some thick sliced mushrooms w/ the shallots (I used 2 nice sized) and sausages. Also, I doubled the milk portion so there was extra sauce and that was perfect for us. After removing the gnocchi from the water, I tossed then w/ the sauce to get them coated, plated them and topped w/ the sausage, more sauce and the cheese and basil (I forgot to get fresh, so I used a sprinkling of dried). I think this would also be great w/ tortellini. Will def make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

i altered it pretty significantly. i used chicken sausage, made it in a skillet, added vegetables, and had to add considerably more milk to extend the sauce. it was still needing more flavor, just a lil something more. it was a great base to start from though.  thanks

I used bratwurst instead of sweet Italian sausage as I hate sweet meats. I cooked the sausages and shallots in a covered large frying pan instead of in the oven over medium-low heat, turning every 5 minutes for 20 minutes and finished them off uncovered. I read someone felt the sauce was under-flavored so I added Pinot Grigio wine to keep the onions moist while cooking. Also, once removing the sausages from the shallots and adding the butter, I added enough flour to absorb all the grease and make an oniony roue before adding the milk to create a proper cheese sauce. Will make again.

I knew when I cooked it it was going to be delicious! We had to stop ourselves from eating it all, as in that Thanksgiving gross feeling of overstuffedness!

So I did something wrong. The cheese sauce never melted down right and we ended up with a giant log of cheese basically haha! The plus side is it tasted good and my 10mo old loved eating the chunks of cheese ??

Easy and delicious! Changes I made: Two slices of provolone in cheese sauce, regular butter rather than unsalted, and whipping cream rather than milk in sauce.
