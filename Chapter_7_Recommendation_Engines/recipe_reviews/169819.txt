This soy cream is great!  It was my first time making ice cream at home.  I had to make some recipe modifications due to what I had on hand. I used Frangelico hazelnut liqueur and some agave as hazelnut syrup... I later read in my user manual that alcohol should be added towards the end of the ice cream cycle or it might not set up right... didn't seem to be an issue, but since this is my first time, how would I know? I didn't have chocolate chips, so I manufactured my own melted chocolate: coconut oil, cocoa powder, and confectioner's sugar. The ice cream tasted like mocha, hazelnut flavor not noticeable. The base is great and will be a lot of fun to work with. Thanks, Tori, I made a double batch!

This is good. I love tofu but, for me, the tofu taste does over power the other flavors a bit...

This is the best "ice cream" I have ever had... it is amazing. It tastes alot like a mocha frappuccino. It's really easy to make, and it freezes well. THANK YOU for this recipe... now I will use it as a base and make other flavors too!!
