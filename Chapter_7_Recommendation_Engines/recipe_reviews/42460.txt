My husband and I love this pancake!  I've made it many times since finding the recipe a year ago.  This is not like a regular pancake and is very eggy, but tastes great with assorted toppings and I can have it on the table in about 15 minutes from start to finish.  I use half the butter to prevent it from being completely butter drenched and just stick the butter in the baking pan, then into the oven to melt while I make the batter.  Mine also always take less than 10 minutes to bake.  We've had it with shredded cheddar on top and it's good, but it's great with assorted sweet toppings instead, like: maple syrup, fruit syrup, jam or jelly, honey, peanut butter, mini chocolate chips, fresh or thawed frozen fruit, cinnamon applesauce, sauteed apples, lemon snow (a recipe from this site), whipped cream, or cinnamon sugar.  We're normally maple syrup people, but our favorite topping is homemade jam and whipped cream.  Definitely give this a try and set out lots of toppings for people to add as they please!  I cut back 1 star because the recipe has way too much butter and I don't even want to think what you'd end up with if you actually baked it for 35 minutes since mine always takes 8 minutes.

Really good as a brunch dish without the cheese.  Added vanilla to the batter.  Served with syrup and whip cream.
Update 2012: Added 2 1/2 tsp of white sugar to the batter plus the vanilla.  The kids eat this up and everyone can eat at the same time.  Love it!!

I love this, so simple yet really satisfying, I added vanilla and cinnamon to it....for the butter, I took the 1/2 cup and put it in the pan I would use, and placed it in the oven while it was preheating. Was so so wonderful. Hubby wants to try it with cheese for an entree one night, would probably add some green onion and garlic to it then.

this was ok, but way too much butter. I will make again as the kids thought it was neat and they loved the name, but next time i will use half the amount of butter called for. I also obmitted the cheese as suggested in headline, and toped with powdered sugar, then syrup and whipped cream.

We just had these for breakfast and loved them. I did as others suggested omitted cheese and added 1 tsp vanilla to the pancake mix. Out of the over i sprinkled with cinnamon and powdered sugar. I also topped with and apple topping I often use for french toast. 2tbsp butter, 1/2c brown sugar,1 tsp cinnamon melted in fry pan, add 3 sliced apples with 1/3 c water, simmer for 8-10 minute. Delicious!!!   This base pancake will lend itself for all kinds of wonderful toppings. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Oh my gosh my kids flipped over this!  Like other reviewers I didn't add the cheese.  In my oven 25 minutes was plenty -- I think I'll even cut it by a couple of minutes next time. But no matter, it was eaten right up with requests for MORE!

Definately a different recipe.  It was a lot of fun to see baking in the oven, it bubbles and twists in a great way.  I ommitted the cheese as well.  Served with powdered sugar and syrup.  Tasted just like french toast.

Just excellent!  I cut it down to serve 2, using ingredients as listed though I put the cheese on the batter before placing the dish in the oven. Served with maple syrup. Bacon, toast and coffee rounded out the meal - mmm mmm good! It's a good way to make eggs go further

My mom has made these for years without the cheese. For some reason we've always called them "Big Dutch Babies". I LOVE them! They are a family favorite :)

Fantastic!  I cut the butter down to 5 Tb, added 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  Served with maple syrup, light whip cream and fresh sliced strawberries.  Family said they were the best ever! Oh and 25 minutes is all my oven needed.

Very much like a Yorkshire pudding however the 1/2 c butter was WAY TOO MUCH! Not sure how much you could cut it down but all I could taste was the butter. Ours didn't stay in the pan but ended up looking like a boat (edges way up and out of the pan and the inside bottom stayed low) I won't be making this again

This recipe was a nice change to the breakfast menu.  It is fast to throw together and easy to make.  After reading the reviews I did make changes right off the bat, but will still give it 5 starts because it was awesome! 

Here are my changes....
**only used 5 eggs (some people said it was "eggy" and had used less eggs...you could even 4 eggs if you wanted to)
**reduced the amount of butter to a little over 1/4 cup....basically you do not want it to stick to the pan, next time I will see about greasing the bottom of the pan.
**added 2 tsp of vanilla, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I wanted mine to be like a french toast.

Then after I dusted it with powdered sugar.  It was so good.  Served it with syrup.  Later on my 2 yr old daughter ate it as a snack, just ripped a hunk off and munched on it.  You could even add blueberries other fruit or other flavorings to the batter while it bakes.  Plus it puffs up so much and looks so cool when it comes out, it is just a neat item to make.

Pancake? No. Omelette? Yes. Puffed up nicely in the oven, and then as soon as the cheese went on it sank back down to a third of the height of my pan. Tasted fine, but extremely thick and eggy like an omelette, and I only used 5 eggs! I don't know how anyone could eat this with whipped cream or anything like that...do you normally eat omelettes with cream/sugar? I don't!

Delicious! Kids loved it! Tastes like french toast! Added cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and omitted the cheese like others suggested. I am thinking of trying it with cheese next time and maybe serving it as a an entree.

I followed the advice to put the butter in during preheat and to use less of it. I would do a little less salt next time. We had ours with powdered sugar on top and my toddlers DEVOURED it. Will make again.

Next time will only use 1/4 cup of butter and sprinkle some cooked bacon on the top along with the cheese as well as some chopped green onions and a dab of sour cream at serving time.

My family have been making this for years and years for every single Holiday brunch- but my Dad calls them Dutch Babies! Something to do with the originbal recipe having them bake in a Dutch oven, I think... no matter what you call them, they're delicious!

Very tasty and EASY! I love this recipe because it is one of very few breakfast options that is really quick and doesn't require standing over a frying pan. Also, it's all hot at the same time!:) I omitted the cheese and we ate it with sweet toppings (syrup, jam, cinnamon sugar, etc.). I think I'll try it again with half the butter. Used user tip of melting butter in casserole dish while the oven preheated. Good time saver! Also might try this in a muffin tin to make individual ones.

A definite keeper!  We have made this several times, several different ways.  I love the way it is so versatile!  We even used it as a base for pizza (adding pizza seasonings and pepperonis and topped it with spaghetti sauce). I'm making it this morning (omitting the cheese and adding home made syrup) for a book club meeting!

When I read the reviews and the recipe I was very excited to try it. So I followed the recipe to the T the first time and my kids (who LOVE pancakes) weren't too pleased. So I changed the recipe up a bit. I used 5 eggs instead of 6. I used a tsp of baking powder to add some fluff, and it was better but still not really good like everybody seems to rave about. I will try to make it again but next time I will use 1.4 cups of flour, 5 eggs and a tsp of baking powder and 1 cup of milk. Maybe it will get better each time I try it. I'm not usually so critical. Sorry.

Well I have to say that this is AWESOME! My kids bug me to make this dish and I add a fresh fruit combo with some icing sugar and syrup. It's so easy to make! The only thing I changed was adding the cheese. I am making this this morning and I'm sure more mornings to come. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I halved the recipe, but only used about 3 Tblsp of butter.  Like many other reviews, I omitted the cheddar cheese, and added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  I also added about 2 Tblsp of Ricotta cheese.  Baked in an 8 x 8 glass baking dish for 25 minutes.  There were puddles of butter in the corners so next time I'll reduce the amount even more.  This was fun to try.  It's more like french toast than pancakes.  I served mine with maple syrup and a little bit of mascarpone cheese mixed in.  Very tasty.

This certainly was interesting to watch cook!   I omitted the cheese and served with corn syrup or maple syrup.  I think next time I will sprinkle with sugar and a bit of cinnamon to serve.  Beware, this is quite eggy but I liked this about it.  Eat right away as it goes flat fast!  I wonder what this would be like baked in muffin cups?  You could then "fill" them with sausage, ham or whatever when they come out of the oven!  Nice for a buffet!

I am not a fan of pancakes but the rest of my family is so I decided to make this for them and I absolutely loved it.  I omitted the cheese and added vanilla and cinnamon sugar.

I loved the middle of the panacke, but the edges were a bit crunchy and hard to chew. It could have been the glass pan I used!?

This was really good and easy to make...added only 5T. of butter and added a little baking powder and vanilla extract to the batter - great with bacon and syrup and powdered sugar...:)

This is our kids' favorite Saturday breakfast!  We love how it rises usually 4-6" above the pan.  We love how buttery it tastes and instead of putting cheese in it, I add crumbled, fried bacon. We pour syrup when we're eating it.

This turned out great. Simple recipe too. I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan, cut time to 25 min, and held off on the cheese. Powdered sugar (lightly dusted) and maple syrup. Next try will be for a dinner and will try the onion and garlic maybe add a little sausage... can't hurt to try. :)  Word of warning is using a smaller oven this thing grows and I had to "trim" a couple corners as they touched the top elements in our little oven.

I followed other reviewers and added vanilla I also added cinnamon, leaving out the cheese. It was a lot of fun watching it bake. I will make again.

I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour to make it a little healthier. Three of my kids loved it and two wouldn't touch it. I thought it was fantastic and tasted like french toast. Thank you for the recipe!

I made the recipe for 3 people. I used 2 eggs, omitted the cheese and used fresh strawberries and blueberries instead.  I also added vanilla and cinnamon to the recipe. I used pam cooking spray instead of the butter.(coat the pan well or it will stick).  I cooked it for 22 minutes at 350 in a convection oven. My husband loved it, will make again and will more of it.

I make these more for fun, a traditional pancake is more to my taste. But these are still tasty, and a fun presentation, make sure to serve immediately.

About to sing a song about this pancake. Ditch the cheese. Otherwise, it's perfection!!
