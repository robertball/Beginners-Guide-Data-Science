This was very yummy! I halved the recipe since it was just for me and my husband, sauteed a small minced onion with the cabbage, and tossed in two crushed chicken bouillon cubes while the cabbage cooked down. It added great flavor. After I tossed everything together, I mixed in a beaten egg, put it all in a casserole pan, and baked it for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees, putting cheese all over the top for the last 10 minutes. Yum! Can't wait to make it again. Oh yeah, I used light mayo instead of regular, and boiled the potatoes with 3 crushed garlic cloves which I forgot to take our when I whipped up the taters. They came out delicous!

I used a slightly different approach to this recipe using all the same ingredients.  I had a good sized bowl of leftover mashed potatoes and a wedge of cabbage leftover from making coleslaw.  I added a half of an diced onion with 1 Tablespoon of butter to a skillet  & sauteed the onion for a couple of minutes - added the cubed ham and the cabbage with 1/4 cup of water.  Covered and let the cabbage steam.  Meanwhile I heated the mashed potatoes in the microwave - stirred them and added a Tablespoon of mayonnaise.  When the cabbage was almost done - take the lid off and let the juices reduce.  Stir in the potatoes.  Done - all in less than 15 minutes.  One skillet to clean up and a filling meal to boot.   Thanks!  This is comfort food.

I made the version suggested by Sarah.  It came together easily as a casserole, quicker since I left the potatos whole and unpeeled.  It had a lot of flavor.  Next time I might try making  impressions with the back of a spoon, and placing several sunny side up eggs to bake on top before adding the cheese.

This was fine, but nothing special for us.  Sarah's  most helpful review of adding an onion, garlic & an egg & casserole-ing it could change that.  ;)  I think we'd like it more with the potatoes chunky as in Bubble n Squeak; Skillet Ham, Cabbage & Potatoes or one similar.  I haven't tried those.  I can see getting kids to eat cabbage this way though!  Good one!  :D  I followed the recipe except for halving it & adding a quarter t paprika & one carrot (cooked with the potatoes the last ten minutes).  Thanks for posting  Oh, one more comment:  Even with halving this, it filled a four quart pot.  Yow.  :D  We're eating leftovers - okay, I am; but I am the one that counts the most, right?!?  :)

I added a beaten egg and made this in the oven as someone suggested. Then proceeded to eat it for every meal for three days and miss it when it was finished. THIS WAS AWESOME!

Simple but good. I reduced the prep time by boiling the potato with the cabbage.
