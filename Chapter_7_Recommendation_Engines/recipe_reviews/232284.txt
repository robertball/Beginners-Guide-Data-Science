One note about this recipe, I would advise creaming the butter and brown sugar together then adding the applesauce, vanilla and eggs.  I followed the directions and just dumped it all in the mixing bowl and tried to beat it until smooth as directed and that just wasn't going to happen.  The butter did not want to be incorporated and just clumped up.  I tried using the whisk attachment and that just made the butter stick to the whisk.  I scraped it off the whisk and returned to the paddle attachment.  Finally I just added the dry ingredients.  The dough looked rather loose and I thought they would run all over the cookie sheet but they didn't spread at all.  I baked for 12 minutes.  These are soft tender cookies.  Next time I would add some nuts.  Overall these were very well received. UPDATE - These cookies are better after they sit a little bit.  At first I thought they needed a bit more salt but after having completely cooled and stored I realized they don't need more salt at all.

These are SO good! I added chopped walnuts, a few more white chocolate chips and a little extra cinnamon, but the recipe would have been great even if I'd followed it exactly. Very good, can't wait to make them again!
