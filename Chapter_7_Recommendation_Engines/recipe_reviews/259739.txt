I cut the recipe in half, and my husband and I liked it.  This was the maiden voyage with the Instant Pot, so appreciated how well it went from start to finish.

This method is too simple, just brilliant. I used a traditional pressure cooker, 7-quart.  I used homemade beans adding some chili style black beans as well as pintos. I used the amount of liquid as written though to keep it from getting too soupy. The flavor is exceptional and with all the garnishes this turned into a meal-in-one for the whole family. Thank you for the recipe.

I was not able to complete this recipe either with my Instant Pot that I just bought.  3 times I got the burn alert before it could get to pressure cook.  

there was no notation in recipe to add 1 1/2 cups water for a 6Qt . On the  3rd try after cleaning inner pot  and texting instant pot support,  I added 1 1/2 cups water put my chili back in pot and same thing.   before pressure I got the Burn. 

Needless to say, I put everything in my slow cooker to finish cooking.   
Evidently only a few of us weren't able to complete in IP.

Fantastic! Couldn't find either chili beans or green chilis at my grocer so I used kidney beans, pinto beans, two Anaheim peppers, and a can of peppers in adobo sauce. I threw a little extra cumin and didn't put in the Sriracha. It was so good.

Cut recipe in 1/2. I also got the BURN warning on the Instant Pot. Never got it before I liked the chili. Easy to make. Came out good. The celery not cooked enough because the BURN warning stopped the process. But it was a great change along with the vinegar cider. I'll make it again. The BURN notice appears if there is not enough liquid in the pot to create steam and the bottom parts burn Will definitely try again!

I've made this a couple of times; it is a great base recipe for a lot of chiles.  I haven't had all of the ingredients either time, no garlic chili sauce, so I've upped some of the other spices, added a jalapeno one time, added some extra cumin, and it works very well.

Added chipotle peppers in adobo sauce as well as vanilla yogurt and a touch of cinnamon. Very good dish and easy to make in instant pot.

It's the best chili I've ever made! The Instant Pot made it super fast and easy.
