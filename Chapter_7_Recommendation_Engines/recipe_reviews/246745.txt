This dish was DELICIOUS!!!  I have never made osso buco before...this recipe made the meat tender, the sauce was wonderful over basmati rice.  I am not crazy about the cut of meat - too fatty.  I will be making this again with another cut of beef roast.

Dinner tonight for the family, and this meal hit the spot. So savory and tasty over pasta and for my gluten-free daughter-in-law, over rice. Either way it worked.  I added a few more vegetables then what's called for in the recipe such as roasted garlic cauliflower and baby broccoli stems because I had them on hand, but I think these only added to the flavor and texture.
