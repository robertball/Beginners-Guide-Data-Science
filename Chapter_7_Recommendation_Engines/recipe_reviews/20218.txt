I usually don't put that much vermouth in mine, but this was really excellent.

Definitely the best martini I've ever made at home. I added just a splash of olive juice. I will use this recipe again.

Very good with both vermouths. I thought it would have been "odd" with the addition of sweet vermouth but it wasn't. I did not shake the gin though as I was taught not to shake gin because shaking "bruises" it.

This is nearly the ideal recipe for a Perfect Martini, which uses a 50/50 blend of sweet & dry vermouth.  A 4:1 gin/vermouth ratio is more traditional, but the recipe gets dryer as time passes.  I think originally, martinis were a 50/50 gin & vermouth blend.

Just mixed the gin and both vermouths into pitcher.  Poured over oversized ice cube.  In my opinion, no olives necessary!   Awesome recipe!

Excellent Martini.  I even made this for a friend who used to be a bartender and he commented in how good it was.

Yum-my! I'm more of a beer girl but when I have a martini its always a dirty gin martini and this recipe is really good! I like it dirty so I added a olive juice and olives to taste and it came out perfect. I'll definitely recommend this recipe and use it from now on! Dry and Sweet?! It works!
