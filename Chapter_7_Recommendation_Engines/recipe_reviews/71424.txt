This is very good, quick, and there's not much to clean up; however, I really felt the beer was out of place.  The second time I replaced the beer with Ginger Ale.  I also added a teaspoon or so of balsamic vinegar for zing, teaspoon or so of soy sauce (recipe needs salt), and a teaspoon or so of Tobasco (maybe too spicy for some, but just right for us).  To the dry ingredients I added a teaspoon of sugar.  The result was addictive.  There wasn't a trace left.  I'm also going to try with lemon juice.

I have never rated a recipe before, mostly because I didn't want to take the time, but also because individual preparation can make such a difference.  But - I needed to create an account and rate this recipe!  I don't know that I woud call it New Orleans Barbeque Shrimp, but more like a spicy shrip scampi.  It wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but I am glad that I ran into it.  This shrimp is great.  The spices and different flavors that you experience while eating this dish are phenominal, and somewhat rare for many home made dishes, but more what you would find in restaurant prepared meals.  This is definitely worth making.  Only change - I used one stick of butter instead of two, and I still had plenty of sauce.  I imagine cutting the butter in half strengthened the flavor of the spices as well!  Great recipe!

This is almost identical to the divine barbecue shrimp served at Pascal's Manale on Napoleon Avenue in the Garden District of New Orleans!!  Wonderful wonderful!  If I can't be there to indulge, this fantastic recipe is the next best thing.

Except for cutting back on the cayenne in consideration of Hubs' sensitive innards, I made this exactly as written without changing, omitting or adding anything, and it was excellent.  My only criticism is that in my mind all this butter is unnecessary and just goes to waste, whether you serve this over pasta, sop it up with bread, or not.  Other than that, the seasonings all cooperate with each other into a nice flavor all its own - in other words,  the beer isn't obvious, nor is the Worcestershire or any of the herbs or spices.  I served this over a tossed green salad with a Lemon Dijon Vinaigrette. It was a light but satisfying, full-flavored summer meal.

Being from south Louisiana, I can affirm a previous reviewers statement,   this is almost identical to the barbecue shrimp served at Pascal's Manale in New Orleans.  Serve it with hot french bread for dipping and no doubt about it...you'll be back for seconds!   It's devine!

After a trip to New Orleans, I didn't think I'd ever have barbeque shrimp again, as I had no idea what flavors were used for this.  I came across this recipe and decided I'm going to make it for Mother's Day.  I gave it a trial run for my bf & I, making 2 separate batches - one with real butter and one with "move over butter" spread.  I omitted beer from both and used water.  This mimics what I had in the restaurant and was SO tasty!  We both preferred the "move over butter" version rather than real butter which also cuts half the calories!  Can't wait to make this again!

Truly amazing! I love BBQ shrimp. My husband made me a seafood dinner last night for Mother's Day, so I had about 1/2 a lb. of leftover shrimp to make something with. I cut the recipe in half & I made about 3 changes to the recipe: didn't have beer, subbed cooking sherry, did 1/2 butter & 1/2 EVOO, and I had to use fresh basil instead of dried (added the fresh basil to the sauteeing garlic and butter). Served with crushy French bread and I was in heaven! This is a great recipe, delish!!!!!

Instead of beer I used white wine.  Also added two Roma tomatoes chopped up.  Served it over thin spaghetti with fresh bread.  Wonderful and froze really well.  I just ate a frozen batch tonight.

Excellent - deemed the best dinner in awhile by the family. Took another reviewers suggestion and added some sugar, soy sauce and since I was out of balsamic vinegar, added about 1/2 -3/4 a teaspoon of balsamic vinaigrette - outstanding!

Actually, my neighbor is a chef in New Orleans and he gave me some tips about BBQ shrimp. First, the unsalted butter goes LAST not first because you do not want the butter to break down, you want it to stay nice and creamy for dipping your bread. You can use wine instead of beer. Also, add half a lemon, squeeze juices and then throw lemon  into pan. You simmer the shrimp (with heads on for extra flavor) in the liquids and spices (You can purchase Creole seasoning, we use Tony Chacheres and omit all the separate spices and salt) and let the liquid cook down and the shrimp turn nice and pink, Once the shrimp are pink and liquid cook down some, add the butter and stir just until melted then remove from heat. If the butter breaks, you can add some whipping cream. You can see this recipe demonstrated on YouTube. Just make sure you use UNSALTED butter or the dish will be too salty.

I've never had New Orleans BBQ Shrimp, so I can't compare it to the original. However these shrimp are excellent. One caution the recipe calls for the medium shrimp to be cooked for over 5 minutes. That's far too long, two or three minutes is more like it. There is nothing worse then overcooked rubbery shrimp. I used a pound and a half of large shrimp, and cooked them only about 3 minutes. I will make this again.

This is a good base recipe.  I changed it up a bit by scaling it down to four servings and sauteing one half of a medium size onion, one half green and one half red bell pepper, six minced cloves of garlic in salted butter.  I then added the mixed dried seasonings.   After a few minutes, I added one half cup each of white wine and water, then I added thawed frozen jumbo shrimps.  After cooking the shrimps for a minute or two, I thickened the sauce by mixing one tablespoon of arrow root with 1/4 cup of water.  I allowed it to simmer for an additional minute or two before serving it over a bed of pasta.  It was delish with the changes made, and I will definitely make this again.

Delicious. I did make some changes - no beer, so I used red wine. Also had no onion powder, so I used green onions. I cute the butter to 1/3 cup, based on other people's comments.

I never write reviews, but I had to for this one. This recipe is absolutely fantastic. I just started cooking recently for my wife, and this dish met all of my definining criteria. It was quick, cheap, and tasted great. I had everything besides the shrimp already on hand. Make sure to follow the recommendations of serving this with bread, because dunking it in the sauce may be the best part.

This was awesome! I LOVED how quickly it came together and how delicious it was! I appreciated each flavor - a tad spicy, but that can easily be toned down next time. I won't lie: I did not use anywhere near the amount of butter called for, if only for the sake of my thighs. We enjoyed this over jasmine rice, a side salad, and fresh fruit. This recipe is a keeper.

The flavors in this are awesome! I was being lazy so I just melted the butter and mixed together all of the rest of the ingredients, threw it in a baking dish and baked it at 375 for 20 minutes. Turned out great!

I never have all of the spices on hand, so I make do with whatever I have.  Usually some cajun spice.  Tonight I added some olive oil, okra, green peppers, and zucchini to it.  I also doubled the spices and the wet ingredients.  It was phenomenal!  I served it over rice with butter and my family was going back for more.  I substituted ginger ale for beer, added 1 tsp balsalmic, tapatio, and soy sauce.

Very good recipe. I used white wine, as I didn't have any beer, but will try beer next time.  I also may omit the rosemary (sub oregano?) and add more cayenne for more spice.  Also, I will put the spices and herbs in the butter first to meld the flavors more and lessen the cooking time for the shrimp. Overall, a great shrimp recipe. I served it with white rice. Yum!

Fixed as written. It was just OK. Not BBQ shrimp like you get in the Big Easy, so if that is what you are looking for, this is not the recipe. It wasn't bad, but there are so many good shrimp recipes out there, I think this one will just go by the wayside. It is work at try if you think it sounds good.

Very good.  A nice spicy bite, not overpowering at all.   I cut the butter down to about 1/4 (1 oz), substituted imitation crab for the shrimp, and went with ginger ale instead of beer.

This was very good. I cut the amount of cayenne in half and used margarine instead of butter. Served it with french bread and a green salad.

I thought this was fantastic.  For Hubby, not so much, but he doesn't even care for garlic so I wasn't too surprised.  I served this over lingiuni, with some crusty french rolls.  This was easy enough to throw together that I won't mind cooking this for myself, and something different for Hubby.  Very yummy!

This was very good, but I think I was expecting more from the previous reviews.  I didn't think it was superb, just good.  I would recomment it.

I used not quite a stick of butter and it was plenty. The shrimp had a little kick. We enjoyed them and would make again.

I served this recipe each week for a year as a charter chef on a sailing vacation.  It was the grand finally dinner served over a rice spinach mixture with crusty French bread for soaking up the flavorful butter.  The shrimp shells were left on for a big messy peel and eat, family style dinner.  Finger bowls and a lot of napkins accompanied this wonderful, fun meal.

This dish was delicious, authentic and easy. If you enjoyed BBQ shrimp in New Orleans or in Louisiana, you will be pleased with this recipe. We substituted one clove of elephant garlic for the four cloves of garlic and it added just a small hint of sweetness. Very yummy!!

I was born and raised in New Orleans.  Recently went home and had barbeque shrimp out at one of the local restaurants.  This recipe equals anything you would get in a New Orleans restaurant.  I did not use the rosemary and probably next time would increase cayenne for a little more heat.  Served over angel hair with crusty bread.  Excellent

We ALL loved this!  I upped some of the spices a bit because I prepared 1.5 pounds of shrimp instead of just 1 pound.  Kept the fats at a total of 1/2 Cup but used 1/4 Cup each of butter and olive oil.  Also, I didn't have beer so I used chicken stock instead.  Served over jasmine rice.

Very good, like alot of reviewers have already said, reduce butter, double seasonings add some old bay or tony chachere's (both if you have) some celery, parsley, parmesan fresh lemon juice, and maybe some sundried tomatoes, toss cooked pasta in right before serving, with a side of garlic bread maybe perfect!!!! (I know it's sinful but twice a year won't kill you)

First time making this and it was delicious. Next time I will add a little more diced garlic. I used frozen shrimp (mistake) and I think the water actually watered it down a lot, but I doubled the seasonings and it was perfect. Next time I will used thawed shrimp....maybe add some roma tomatoes. I served this over angel hair pasta with broccoli. Great meal.

I can't give it 5 stars because I didn't stick to the original recipe. I combined several ideas from other recipes from New Orleans with this so I'll use what I had on hand and it'll have more of a New Orleans flavor. Here are the changes:  Make a shrimp stock and replace it with the beer. If you add too much of the stock, just combine a tbs of cornstarch to 1 tps of warm water and mix. Add it into the dish in portions until you have the desired thickness.   To make shrimp stock, just peel off the shrimp heads (omit eyes) and shells. Throw it in a pot with 2c of water, bring it to boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer. Make this FIRST while you prep everything else. Simmer for about 30-40 mins.  Omit the rosemary, used 1/2 tps of cayenne pepper, 1/4c butter, add chopped onions (half of an onion-I don't really measure).   Kept everything else the same. It was delicious!

Now I'm certainly no gourmet chef (college student who just got his own place) but man, did I come out of this recipe feeling like a pro.  I used considerably less butter, making up the difference with Worcestershire and soy sauce.  Based on the smell, I felt the beer wasn't really appropriate and skipped it all together.  I'd say slack off on the onion and garlic powder (the latter is redundant with the minced already in there) and be a bit more generous with the thyme and rosemary. Put it on top of some penne, and it's a real treat!

Bland!  Served leftovers over pasta the next day and was much better that way... the flavors seemed to have blended more overnight.  HOWEVER, if you are looking for New Orleans BBQ shrimp, there are better recipes out there.

We added extra beer and Worcestershire sauce for a little extra juice and served it over grits with chopped green onions over the top. No need to add butter to the grits because the sauce is perfect. French bread if you have it, but BBQ Shrimp and Grits is a great New Orleans tradition.

We love this Recipe.  I have to double everything because the kids can't get enough.  This recipe changed the response to my cooking from "eh, dad's cooking again" to "We want dad to cook tonight!!!".  It's best with fresh shrimp.  We went to the beach, bought some shrimp right off the boat, and cooked it up for us and my wife's parents.  Now they demand that we go to the beach with them each year just for this dish.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I added a lot more cayenne pepper - much like the "Norleans BBQ Shrimp from the American Grill in Scottsdale circa 1990. You can also cut back on the butter without missing it.

This was decent, and we enjoyed it. Though we felt it could have used more seasoning, but we normally adjust anyway. I am not familiar with New Orleans BBQ shrimp, maybe this is the authentic flavor?

My husband has made this twice - we love it.  We cut the butter in half and it was still plenty of sauce to soak up with focaccia.  Delicious!

This is a very yummy and versatile dish! I was broke and all I had was a half pound off tail off shrimp and some old spaghetti noodles. I found this and figured I'd give it a shot. First since I only had half bag of shrimp I cut the recipe in half. I didn't have garlic powder so I used Adobo, didn't have rosemary, (I just did without), followed the rest of the seasonings. Added the beer (I was out of Worcestershire so I put in soy sauce) and I added 1/4 cup of spicy v8 to make it saucy so I could put it over some noodles.

More like a spicier shrimp scampi than true New Orleans BBQ shrimp.  Not bad but I wouldn't make it again.

Awesome!  Cooked it for my parents and they told me I could make that any time I want.  I used Coors Light beer and added 4 more tablespoons of butter.  I also added Linguine Pasta!  SO GOOD!

This was good. It tasted like my shrimp scampi which is odd to me since I use wine not beer. I used 2lbs of shrimp. I did double the seasonings but I didnt use it all in the end. I didnt double the sauce stuff. There was plenty. It is a nice and quick. Always a plus in this house. I served it over rice.

This recipe is absolutely spot on - just like Pascal’s!! I made it with 4lbs of shrimp and quadrupled all ingredients and since I live in New Orleans, of course I left shells and heads on. I also added a stick of butter to get more sauce. We had it with oven-warmed fresh Garlic Pull bread from Rouse’s deli - sooo good!!!

Made as written.  Was hoping for more of a "barbecue" flavor, this one had more of a spicy/herbal flavor.  I'll keep looking for a recipe that suits our tastes better.  Tried Old Charleston recipe too, and that was not it either.

Was good. A bit spicy for us but will make again and cut back on the cayenne pepper. The shrimp came out great. Served over bow tie pasta with a side or roasted broccoli.

The spice combination is fantastic! I did not have any beer in the house so I used white wine. the sauce that was made was not very thick so I added some cornstarch and water to it and the result was a nice thick sauce which I served over fettuccini  alfredo. Yum!

My family and I enjoyed this recipe so much that I made it twice in one week! I used fresh white jumbo shrimp and then followed the recipe exactly. I served it with a coarse jalapeno bread and we dipped it into the juices. It was amazing. 

I know I will make this again in the future!

We loved it, it was a really good change from what we had been doing with shrimp.  I also cook everything to taste. I can never go by a recipe 100%, maybe my taste is just different to everyone else. But we loved it, I will fix it again!

this turned out really good after i made some slight modifications.. i used 1/16 tsp ground thyme for the regular dried.. 2 T unsalted butter for the 1/2 cup.. added 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 tsp mexican oregano.. used natural light for the beer and salted to taste..i cooked the garlic first and then added the dry and liquid seasonings.. once it came together i threw in the shrimp and cooked until done.. so delicious.. bf watches Smokey Ribs on youtube and he has a similar recipe.. hence my search and eventually finding this.. ty for submitting

I Loved it!!!
Only change was white wine instead of beer because all the beer was ice cold ;)
I will be making this again, as requested by the whole family (even my picky eater). 
Thanks for sharing!

I really like this recipe. I tried the suggestions  listed below to substitute for not having beer I use a quarter cup of ginger ale and 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and it worked out quite well. The only thing that needed to be changed was the amount of butter or use the full half cup of butter which would make sense for four people not for two so if you're making it for less I would use a quarter cup of butter instead of the half and use the same amount of shrimp. Other than that it was a delicious dinner I used  potatoes as a side with sliced zucchini. Potatoes did not work as well as I hoped the zucchini was very good next time I will try it with rice or pasta. Enjoy

This is NOT like traditional barbecue. BUT it is just as delicious! I always add a little extra paprika and cayenne pepper for spiciness. Be careful on which type of beer you use as it strongly affects the flavor. I always go with something basic like budweiser or coors. If you don't want as much sauce, use about half the amount of butter and beer.

amazing flavour! I followed the recipie as is. It had just the right amount of heat. I served it over a bed of rice boiled in chicken stock.  This was just the recipie I was looking for! Something different, delishous, and light! Just incredible!

This is very simple yet exquisite recipe. I added sliced red peppers and since I didn't have any beer, used the same amount of water. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of sugar as suggested by another reviewer. It was amazing! My husband and kids loved it too.  Will definitely make it again, next time with beer.

This was pretty good, but it was very oily and it gave me a stomach ache.  We had it with french bread to sop up the sauce.  My husband thought it was too sweet (of all things) and I did see that L&H worchestershire sauce has corn syrup.

This recipe is really good.  I made it for my husband who originally had this dish at a famous restaurant in New Orleans.  He loved it!  The one thing I did differently is that I combined the spices with butter to create a compound butter.

Followed it almost exactly.  I agree, a Spicy Shrimp Scampi is just about the best description.  Great with bread, and I recommend a green salad to go with it.  Mmmm!

Well, I was excited about this recipe since I'm from New Orleans and this is one of my favorite dishes.  I haven't eaten it as Pascale Manales, so I cannot compare this to that version like some other reviewers did.  This is very good, but still not as good as my mom's recipe for the same.  So, not the best barbequed shrimp I've ever had when comparing them all, but regardless it is a very good meal.  My favorite thing about it, which will get me to make it again many times, is the fact that it's FAST!  I think I'll add more worcestershire next time, as that is one of my favorite flavors in this, and I could barely taste it in this recipe.  My husband doesn't like shrimp though and he loved it!  We had a good dinner.

In spite of the fact that I didn't add any salt, this tasted very salty to me.  The Worcestershire sauce?  It was okay, and I liked dipping some good bread into the sauce, but I don't think I'd make it again.

I omitted the rosemary as I don't like it much, and used fresh basil. If I were to make this again, I wouldn't bother with the beer - I made a trip to the store especially to get it, and it didn't make much of a difference to the flavor. Good stuff though. Thanks!

Never rated a recipe before, but my husband says this is a GREAT recipe and that should go into our favorite recipes' book.  He says is even better than his mom's favorite recipe for shrimp.
The only change: I didn't have cayenne so for 2 lb bag of shrimp I used 1 1/2 tsp chipotle powder (we like spicy food).
Thanks for a great recipe Rachel.

OMG this is the best shrimp I have made on this site. I would so recommend making this. I did not have any beer and it was still awesome. I made whole wheat penne pasta with it and I almost ate it all from my husband.

This was very, very good.  My taster was off a bit and I added too much salt, but it was my fault not the recipes.  I served with homemade french bread from this site.  Very rich and I think I would use as a starter next time and not as a meal.  It was quick, easy and tastey and probably a 5 star if I hadn't added so much salt!  DARN!!

This was pretty good, but I had to add more Worcestershire sauce to give it enough flavor.  I substituted some of the butter with olive oil, but if I make it again I would reduce the total by at least half.

Many years ago I had Barbeque Shrimp in New Orleans and I have never forgotten that dish but never seem to find a recipe that sounded close and so when I found this recipe I thought it would be worth trying. I have to say It Pretty Darn Tasty!  Not too spicy and full of flavor.  I served it with buttered fettuccine on the side and garlic bread. Just as good as the recipe I tried all those years ago.

This recipe was amazing. My mom used to make something very similar when I was younger and I was craving it. This turned out exactly like I wanted it to! I served it over brown rice with french bread. Thank you!!!!

Boy, I hate to be the first to give this less than five stars!  It's a very good recipe, but I'm giving it only four.  I made it as directed except for adding a bit more cayenne pepper to suit our tastes, and served over pasta.  There was a hint of a flavor (maybe the thyme?) that kept it from being five stars.  But still a great recipe!
