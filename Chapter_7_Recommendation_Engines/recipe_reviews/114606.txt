I made this today for the first time using the suggestions of using coffee instead of water and upping the cocoa to 6 tbsps.  I really liked the way it came out dense, rich and really moist.  I made a quick frosting to drizzle over it.  Basically it's about 1 1/2 cup to 2 cups powdered sugar mixed with 2 heaping tbsps. cocoa powder.  Add a little milk and some vanilla and whisk it smooth.  Drizzle it over warm cake.  Really good and easy.  I think the next time I make this I'll try adding a little cinnamon to the batter for an almost Texas sheet cake kind of taste.  Love this recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

This cake looks beautiful, but tastes aweful.  The worst part is the after taste that lingers in your mouth, FOREVER! Do not waste your time on this cake! Unfortunately I had to give it 1 star in order to post this comment!

The only reason I give this three stars instead of four or five is that I made it with the suggestions of another reviewer - use coffee instead of water, and add six tablespoons of cocoa. I also threw in a bag of chocolate chips as well. And then I topped it with the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from this site. It was extremely good that way, and made that way I will definitely do so again. However, since that's not the original recipe, I can't honestly give it five stars. But I would suggest trying it that way!

I was looking for a bundt cake recipe and found this.  It's my standard chocolate cake recipe with two exceptions.  Use one cup coffee instead of water and Six tablespoons cocoa instead of two.  This should help with the bland taste reported by first reviewer.  Good Luck.

i agree that it was a little bland, but the coffee instead of water and 6tbs cocoa did the trick.

Added white chocolate chips to the recipe which increased the flavor and gave it a pretty presentation on a cut piece. Then I drizzled melted vanilla frosting on top and topped it with marchino cherries.

This cake is moist but sort of bland. I ended up heating up some chocolate sauce and drizzling it over it -- making it MUCH better. Powdered sugar isn't enough. I did like how easy it was to make though and it came right out of the pan without any extra work.
