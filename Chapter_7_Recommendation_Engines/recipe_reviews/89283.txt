I am actually rating my version of this recipe.  I bought thin cut chicken breasts, rolled them up with FRESH spinach, proscuitto, provalone and 1 basil leaf (under the spinach so it soaks into the chicken).  I rolled them in breadcrumbs, secured them with toothpicks and browned the outside in olive oil and garlic.  Then I put them into a baking dish, poured in the garlicky olive oil from the pan added about a tablespoon of butter, tore up a couple of sage leaves, poured in some white wine, covered the pan and baked them for about 20 minutes and then uncovered for 10.  Awesome, awesome.  It was one of the best things I have ever made.  The sage made it.

I served this at our backyard party. Everyone LOVED it. I layered the ingredients instead of making rolls. I baked it in the oven. It was wonderful! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I used this recipe as a gude and made the following modifications.

Flattened chicken breast as suggested,  placed proscitto on top, placed some fresh baby spinach leaves on top and then mozzarrella cheese.  I then rolled them up, spayed some oil on top, then squeezed a little lemon juice on top and sprinked parmasen cheese on top.  I didnt have wine or provolone.  Still tasted great.  Will also add some cooked capsicum slices next time. 

I baked them in the oven at 180 C for 40 minutes.  I didn't

This was incredible. So far it is the best thing I have made from this site. I made 4 breasts and suffed them with the amounts I like of each ingredient, like extra spinach.  I used extra wine in the skillet so that I could make a wine sauce after I took the chicken out. It was great toghether.

After reading several reviews I made a few alterations to this recipe, but have to give credit to Crystal for providing the basis of a delicious recipe! I layered prosciutto, provolone and fresh spinach leaves on the pounded chicken breasts and add some chopped sage leaves; rolled them up and secured with toothpicks. I then browned them in 2 tbs. olive oil.  Added a little salt and fresh ground pepper. When they were evenly browned on all sides I took them out of the pan and put them in a baking dish. I added a cup of white wine to the pan and let it reduce for about 10 minutes. I then added the wine to the baking dish and put it in a 350 oven for about 25 minutes. Everyone raved at this dish! Restaurant quality! I can't wait to make it again --so delicious!!

This dish came out great, I took some suggestions from other readers-I used fresh spianch and  sauteed the spinach with some mushrooms and garlic.  I lightly breaded the chicken with italian seasoning, browned it a bit in the wine and then baked it in the oven.  I added some chickenn broth, garlic and mushrooms to the left over wine to make a nice sauce!

This was a great dish....but only because I altered it.  First, I used fresh spinach instead of frozen...it was a great taste, I could not imagine using limp frozen spinach.  Also, I folded the breasts in half and closed with toothpicks instead of rolling it.  Then, I cooked the chicken in the pan for only a minute or two on each side.  Then I moved it to a baking dish, poured in the wine and let it bake in the oven....I think I was about 400 degrees for 35 minutes or so.  I used a baster a few times to baste the wine over the chicken.  I served it with Garlic Parmezan Orzo...(also found on here) and Asaparagus.  It was a dinner that my guests complimented me on all night!

Excellent recipe, but i also made a few changes. Used chicken cutlets and pounded them even thinner. Sprinkled each with kosher salt and garlic powder before laying ingredients  I did use frozen chopped spinach ( its all I had on hand)  Used toothpicks to hold closed then I sprinkled with italian breadcrumbs and browned them lightly in  olive oil and garlic. then I set them aside in a corningware and made an awesome sauce with the pan drippings and chicken broth and MORE garlic ( we LOVE garlic) .  added a drop of lemon juice and a little bit of white wine and some fresh chopped parsley.  Added the sauce to the Corningware and sprinked with fresh grated cheese. cooked in the oven for 30 min.  Basted a couple of times. Some of the cheese melted out, but it made the sauce even tastier!  Not dry at all and my husband was raving.  I froze 4 of them and some of the sauce to eat again next week. Definitely a keeper.  Thanks Crystal!

Very good! I took the advice of past reviews and after browning the chicken in olive oil and fresh garlic, put it in a baking dish, added some wine and baked at 375 for about 20 minutes. Served with rice.  Next time i'll use more spinach and possibly add tomato from the garden. Very delicious though!

very fancy pants but surprisingly easy.  read some reviews and incorporated many of the suggestions.  Biggest difference from recipe as stated was to pan fry for just a few minutes until slightly browned, with olive oil and garlic and then bake (adding garlic oil, 1 tablespoon butter, white wine & thyme). Used plenty of toothpicks to secure that sucker. I was unsure about the temps so cooked covered in foil for 375 degrees for 20 minutes, uncovered and baked at 400 degrees for 10-15 minutes.  Chicken turned out very moist.  Also used fresh spinach.  After rinsing spinach and shaking off excess water, put in pan with lid for about 3-4 minutes to wilt the spinach -- for easier rolling.  Added a few basil leaves as the first layer and i also put a dusting of breadcrumbs on it after it was all rolled up.  Next time, I will use a tad less salt and possible consider putting some marinara sauce on top .  Basically, the recipe suggestions I followed for the most part were in the review by SarahLovesBroccoli.  I used thyme instead of sage because I had some fresh already on hand.  The white wine sauce was wonderful and I poured some over the top after I served.  Thanks Crystal.

I used fresh spinach and added sage leaves between the chicken and prosciutto since that's how I had it in Cambridge.  Rolled in breadcrumbs and fried in butter, then sauteed more sage, deglazed the pan with wine, poured over the chicken and baked.  Possibly the best thing I've ever made.

I gave it a five star rating, but I did incorporate a few changes of my own and some suggested by other reviwers.  I used fresh basil leaves  (only a few per roll) - omitted the spinach - finished it off in the broiler for 2 minutes - and seasoned the breasts with fresh garlic and onion powder before assembling and rolling.

I feel that this recipe has a lot of potential but should be baked instead.  I loved the combination of ingredients but the chicken got dried out very easily as I was waiting for all of the wine to evaporate.  I will try baking it as others suggested the next time I try this recipe.  I served with Pesto Pasta and a Blue Cheese Salad.

Excellent dish! I did exactly how the recipe directed except instead of cooking for 20 minutes, I cooked for 10-12 minutes and that was sufficient since the chicken is very thin. I served this dish with asparagus with hollandaise sauce, and garlic & herb red potatoes. AWESOME!

So delicious! I made this for my husband and his buddy, and it was a HUGE success! I substituted fresh mozzerella instead of the provolone and it was just as good :)  I can't wait to make it again!

This is so, so, SO good!!  I took a queue from another recipe and added a couple of cloves of crushed garlic to my olive oil.  I added half of the garlic / olive oil to the spinach, and used the other half for brushing over the chicken.  We used a dry sauvignon blanc.  The only reason this gets a 4 instead of a 5 is because the chicken WAS a little dry.  It still tasted awesome, but I would have preferred a moister chicken.  I will either cover the pan or bake in the oven next time to see if it helps with the dryness.  We served this alongside Grilled Garlic Artichoke and Roasted Garlic Cauliflower (both from this site).  Amazingly enough, we didn't feel that we had too much garlic, but it was DEFINITELY too much oil.  All three dishes relied on olive oil and it was a bit much.  Other than the over abundance of oil, the three dishes went really well together.

I took the suggestions of others and sauted the fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms. Baked at 400 degrees covered and then uncovered the last 10 minutes. My husband  and I enjoyed this meal very much. I'm not big on chicken, but this was a delightful meal and simple to prepare.

Recipe did not specify to pound chicken breasts so that they are thin. If this isn't done, it is difficult to roll and chicken takes much longer to cook. I liked  the spinach in with the rest of the flavors.

A good meal but needs some improvement. I followed the recipe to a T and wish I had read the other reviews first. I had my deli cut the prosciutto too thin so its taste was lost. I served it with an easy orzo, sauted red pepper, tomato and garlic dish- yum.

I used fresh spinach that I steamed in the microwave. After reading the reviews I decided to roll the chicken in panko and parmesan cheese and then brown in a pan. I then moved the chicken to the oven for 20 minutes.  I deglazed the pan with 1/2 wine and 1/2 chicken broth which I then poured over the chicken when baking. Delicious.

This recipe was excellent. Just a word of advice, after you roll the chicken and you are securing with toothpicks -do whatever you need to in order to keep the ends together. Don't worry if the toothpicks are going everywhere and it doesn't look so pretty while cooking, it will hold together perfectly once you take them out. I also changed a couple of things. I did decide to just cook the chicken for a couple of minutes on each side in the skillet with some garlic and olive oil. Then I placed the chicken into a greased baking dish and just poured sauvignon blanc all over it, and I do mean allllll over it. I baked it at 350 degrees for probably 25 minutes. It was delicious!!

I made this by the recipe with one exception. I used 2 slices of provolone for each breast because Saltimbocca ca be a little dry. The only thing I'll do different next time is use 2 bags of frozen spinach. Everyone loved it. I served it with Chef John"s creamy pasta with mushrooms and a tossed salad.  The whole meal was a big hit.

I couldn't figure how I was supposed to fry this dish with toothpicks running through the chicken rolls.  So I baked it. for 45 minutes on 375 degrees.  The dish came out  good but the Prusciutto over powered the dish.   I think mozzarella would have been a better choice over provolone. My only modifications  to the dish was to coat the chicken with a light layer of breadcrumbs before adding the ingredients and rolling up, a few pats of butter and a small can of mushrooms (drained) to the deep dish along with covering it with foil before putting it in the oven.

I believe this was the best banana bread I have made (I have made a lot). I followed the directions with two minor changes. I really like tasting bananas in my bread so I used 5 bananas instead of 3. I really believe that was the key to having such a moist bread. Instead of 1/3 cup of chocolate chips, I used 1/4. It made more than enough and my son has not stopped eating it since it came out of the oven. Thank you for the recipe.
