Holy Mother this is just awesomely delicious! Made it to take over to girlfriends house with family in town and they couldn't stop talking about it!!! I made a few minor adjustments - 2 cans of corn (drained/rinsed) and used 2 jalepenos diced up nicely and dumped the entire bottle of Zesty Italian in and it worked fantastically and made a huge amount more than anticipated!

The recipe lacks any tang.  It's fresh ingredients are healthy but need some seasoning beyond salad dressing.  It takes a lot more than 20 minutes to put the recipe together!

Love it.  My 21-yr-old daughter and I made this together, which made it fun.  We used four roma tomatoes.  We mixed all the ingredients, except the cilantro and the Italian dressing.  We added half of the cilantro and dressing, and then added a little bit at a time as we tasted it.  We ended up adding just over 1/3 cup cilantro and  only about 3/4 cup of the dressing.

This is great, a refreshing healthy salad. It is crucial you use a dressing you really like. But if all your ingredients taste good then it doesn't really need it. I used fresh cooked sweet corn and added some cumin. Great for summer!
