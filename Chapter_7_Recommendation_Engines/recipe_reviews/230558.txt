Wow!  Amazing!  Dessert can be delicious without the gluten!  I subbed 1/2 the peanut butter with almond butter for the cookie and cooked it 13 minutes instead of 8.   I also used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  Because several others had mentioned it was sticky, I spread butter in the bottom of my stoneware jelly pan and no problems.   This was my first try at gluten free and it was a success!  I made these for a friend who is gluten free, but my son ended up eating half of them!  Thank you, Jewel!  I will make these again!

Yummy!! I brought this (with a couple of changes) to a dinner party and everyone enjoyed it! Since another reviewer mentioned excessive sweetness and strong peanut butter flavor, I decided to try using half sunbutter (sunflower seed spread) and half peanut butter--was not too exact on measuring. I also used about 1 1/2 cups total sugar--half brown sugar, half white. I would definitely make this again!! This is delicious whether you need to eat gluten-free or not. Also, I imagine you could use all sunbutter (instead of peanut butter) for those with peanut allergies. Thanks for the idea!

I absolutely appreciate that someone took the time to find a gluten-free alternative crust to these bars. Thank you for offering an idea I would never have thought of on my own!

After having made them, I believe that the peanut butter cookie base makes the squares far far too sweet and rich, and the peanut taste totally overpowers the rest of the nuts in the bars. At least for my tastes, anyway. My husband and his dad liked them, but they could only eat one square at a sitting.

My oven sucks, so I only realized later that the cookie base didn't cook/set as much as I would have liked. I would recommend longer than 8 minutes, and at a higher temp to at least set the PB.

**It was easy to make and prep.** If you don't normally have these ingredients in your cupboard, you can save money by only buying the amount you need in the bulk section of your grocery store.

I am going to try to find a gluten-free crust that is more like the original base I knew and loved when I ate gluten. Something less overpowering than the peanut butter.

All in all, nice to be able to make something to take to holiday parties that was gluten-free, but not many people ate them, and no one took a second.

I make these for My Brother in Law who is Gluten Free. You can "tweak" the recipe and add tons of different kinds of nuts and chocolate candies and carmel on top. I switch it up all the time. Works best with parchment paper in the bottom of the pan. Enjoy!

This is very good made with half almond butter also. As I am sensitive to chemicals I used 2 T raw honey instead of bleached white sugar ( brown sugar is molasses and white sugar) and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and a layer of almond meal. I like the honey better and the vanilla adds another delicious taste depth to this very delectable dish. One can indeed tweak this recipe and it still is very good.

Oh my goodness...these are delicious!  I had some all natural almond butter that I needed to use up, so I used 1 cup almond butter and 1 cup creamy peanut butter.  The rest I did exactly what the recipe said.  They are very rich and yummy!

Love love love this!!!! After reviewing comments about it being too sweet, I only added a cup and a half of sugar and the crust was fabulous! My company loved it and had second and third helpings! I only added chocolate chips and pecans just keeping it simple. But I could see adding even butterscotch chips for a nice blend with the peanut butter crust. Thanks for this recipe because the magic bars are one of my all-time favorite desserts and haven't had them since I went gluten-free

These were indeed rich tasting but a big hit at the party tonight. My niece is gluten free and was so glad she had a safe dessert to snack. The rest of the family thought the bars were "delicious" and ate them as well.
I needed to bake them an additional 6 minutes though. And the bars came out perfect. I didn't have any parchment paper, so I used a cooking spray  specifically for baking. I sliced the bars after approximately 40 minutes of cooling. Then I let them cool thoroughly before serving. The cookie bars came out easily and with little effort. Thank you for a great recipe. I will be making these often for a special niece.

I followed recipe exactly and my daughter loved it so much she NEVER wants me to make it again! She couldn't stay out of it!! I am so glad to have found a gf dessert she enjoyed so much! The parchment paper covered the bottom and sides and there was no food stuck in pan. It was firm enough to cut into bars!Thank you Jewels!

I made these for a friend with celiac disease and those with no gluten problems also loved these very rich cookies. The only change I made was using heaping 3/4 cups of brown and white sugar  I sent them to my husband's weekly staff meeting. They were an instant hit and  high on the request list after 2 years. Don't bake without parchment paper or foil coming up the sides of the pan. The batter is very sticky  and the pan is very hard to clean.

This was amazing! I didn't have cashews and pecans on hand so I did a thin layer of chopped up peanuts and then did a layer of mixed chocolate and butterscotch chips, a layer of raisins, a layer of rolled oats, and then the coconut and sweetened condensed milk. It was to die for.

These are really great bars!  I have changed out the peanut butter with almond and cashew and all work great, but natural peanut butter is still my favourite. I load mine up with nutritious hazelnuts, walnuts and pecans, then sub out the refined sugar with unrefined sucanat (works great) this helps counter the sweetened condensed milk :). Chopped dark chocolate is how I like to top-off this tasty treat...yum!

Reduced sugar to 1 cup only. My husband loved it and a friend that is a professional trainer ate 4 at one time.
It is a keeper!!

It didn't cook all the way and was really soupy.  Good taste but was not firm enough.

Oh my goodness, these are heavenly!  I cut the recipe in half since  I was low on peanut butter, and, since I am also dairy free, used coconut sweetened condensed milk in place of the regular, and dairy free chocolate chips, and they turned out perfect!  Next time I will make the whole batch and freeze them.

I made this for a church ladies dinner I attended.  One of our ladies follows a gluten-free diet, so I made it with her in mind.  The ladies all loved it and many took left-overs home with them.  I would do it again when I need to prepare something for those needing to stay away from gluten.  They are very rich, so small portions are perfect.

It turned out pretty good and was approved by DH.  It was a good way for me to use up the last of the chocolate PB and almond butter I had in my pantry.  The cookie base was very pleasantly sweet enough to complement the dark chocolates and nuts without added sugar. I used grated fresh coconut from my tree. This is a much healthier version of an old favorite. This recipe will be saved for future baking.

This dessert is fantastic, fabulous, and downright awesome.  I made it this evening and will definitely be making it again.  I did decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.

Sticky, but delicious. I think a lot of gluten free stuff is good for being gluten free, but not by "normal" standards. But this is yummy by all standards :)

I didn’t get passed the peanut butter part. It was in the oven for 20 minutes and never firmed up. I used natural, unsweetened peanut butter, so maybe that was the problem. I also tasted a bit of the base, and it was crunch with sugar crystals. Just didn’t work.

These are extremely sweet and peanut butter seemed to cover every other flavour.  I found the peanut butter base wasn't cooked after 8 minutes and I gave it three more minutes.  I believe I could have cooked it for another 10 minutes. The sugar was still crunchy when I finished the dessert.  I won't make this again.

I added crushed up mini pretzels for a salty twist. Yummmmy sweet (very) stuff and a little goes a long way.  I suggest cutting small pieces to budget your limits, unless you just want to indulge in this goodies, GO FOR IT!

Made exactly as written for a dinner with my mom who can’t have gluten. Everyone gave it rave reviews. The peanut butter cookie crust is a cool twist on the traditional magic cookie bar- the peanut butter flavor does tend to overshadow the chocolate but that was ok with us!

I tried this but I prefer to use just a Graham Cracker base using crushed Grahams and butter.

I needed a few GF bars to make for my daughter's baby shower so thought I'd try this.  I was a little skeptical on the cookie base (I've made those cookies a lot) but it was a clever base and really took these over the top.  I'm so glad I tried them.  Highly recommend, even if you aren't gluten free.  This is much better than the graham cracker crust in original recipe.

As written we all thought these bars, although delicious, were much to sweet.  Because the chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk add a ton of sweetness,  I was able to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.   They were plenty sweet!  I would encourage you to try mix and matching your sprinkle on ingredients, using different flavored chips (check for GF ingredients in the chips), different nuts and maybe add dried tart cherries or cranberries as well.  Lastly, when you pour on the sweetened condensed milk, spread it around so it covers the top.

Chocolate, peanut butter, coconut dream.  Make sure you have enough milk because this dessert is very sweet and rich.  The only thing I will change the next time is add half the sugar to the peanut butter base. I'll add a cup of peanut butter and a cup of crushed GF graham crackers next time for a crunch.  I'll also only add a total cup of chocolate chips.

Epic fail! The only fail I ever had from All Recipes.  I should have read reviews before I made this.  These turned into hard rock candy...nearly impossible to cut...and way too sweet, a total waste of good ingredients.  The recipe on the back of the Kraft Peanut Butter jar calls for half the amount of sugar.  If anyone makes this, DEFINITELY use half the amount of sugar...and I'd even cut that back to get the right consistency for the cookie base.

After reading the other reviews I decided to cut the sugar by 1/2 cup.  Since I only had semi-sweet chocolate chips and natural crunchy peanut butter, that's what I used plus all the other ingredients.  This recipe is a keeper, easy to make and oh so good.

Wow, these are amazing! I followed other suggestions. I used 1/2 peanut butter and 1/2 almond butter. I also used 1-2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. Outstandingly delicious!

Delicious! Use some butterscotch morsels along with semi sweet! Also cut sugar back a half of cup, but decided to add brown sugar to make cookie mixture alittle thicker. Cooked cookie part 12 min. Let cool before cutting. Yum
