Good recipe for a chili base. Really easy to add spices and other ingredients to heighten the flavor. If you are starting out cooking this is a good recipe to use to experiment with. I used ground turkey instead of hamburger but still was delicious.

My usual chili is pretty time consuming so I was excited to try this canned version. As written this is an easy and decent chili but not quite flavorful enough for my liking. Next time I make it I will use my own chili seasoning and double the amount. The garlic could double (or triple) as well. And I think if I sweat the allium before adding the beef it might pull out more of their flavor. I may also add a can of corn - I just really like a little corn in my chili. If you want heat you could add some canned chiles as well. There is no heat to speak of as written. Thanks for a good base to work from!

I've made this recipe 4 times now with Yves veggie ground and it has never failed to amaze me. I add some extra spices to it to make it a bit more flavorful but other than that this is a great recipe!

It was ok, nothing special. Its needs a lot of doctoring, very blah.
