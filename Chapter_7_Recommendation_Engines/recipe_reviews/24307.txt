The combination of ingredients is quite tasty! I make traditional peanut clusters every Christmas so I was skepical about using white chocolate. This recipe will now become a staple for me to make during Christmases to come! (I melted everything in the microwave and it worked great!)

Fantastic, had no issues with the recipe at all, I doubled the batch so I could use the entire bag of toffee bits, it made quite a few. My hubby likes it as much, if not more than the traditional chocolate kind. Thank you for sharing this recipe. Oh, yeah, I never do the double boiler thing with almond bark, I microwave! Less stuff to wash up!

Be careful, these are dangerously habit forming. Yum! Thanks for sharing, Carol. By the way, to reduce "fussing time" I put the candy coating and chips into a pyrex bowl and microwaved on medium for 3 minutes to melt.

Love this recipe--make sure you make the drops fairly small.  The nurses at the hospital and my study group are now in love with these too...excellent recipe!

I'm a beginner cook, and I wanted to try to make some treats for chrsitmas this year. These were a big hit! However I had to change a few things around: Like Maggie said I cut the fuss time in half by using the microwaveable bowl. And instead of droping by rounded spoonfuls I just lined the baking sheet with waxed paper and poured it out into one big piece, then broke it all apart later after it had cooled into randomly shaped pieces haha. Overall, I love this recipe and so did my family! I will make again.

I have been looking for this recipe.  I melted choclate bits (I don't like white choclate) in the micro and added 1 whole can of spanish peanuts.  Spanish nuts the best .  Dropped 1 heaping tablespoon on waxed paper till cooled.  I did not have toffe but think this would be even better

I made this according to the recipe using my pampered chef microcooker. I used the microwave and it took me all of 10 minutes. It turned out great and it's an excellent addition to my dark ones.

This is addictive stuff!  I added a sprinkling of
almond toffee bits for extra crunch.  Pretzels would be a nice addition and for Christmas, I think dried cranberries would be good in this.

This is same recipe that my grandpa has used for years to make candy at Christmas, only instead of toffee bits he uses marshmallows. So yummy!

These are alright... My family and I made them this holiday season... but I don't think we need to make them again next year.  They had a funky taste to me. :/

I just made these for the first time and they're even better than I expected!! Mine turned a tannish color because of the Heath toffee bits - not sure if that's normal, since the picture looks really white. Either way, these are awesome and will definitely make again! Thanks for the great recipe!

i have just tried this recipe. it shows it is ready in 20 minutes.  i was done making these at 10am.  its now 12:30pm and they still are not hard.  if this does not harden, try putting them back in a bowl and melting 2 bar of paraffin wax and mixing it in with them.

Loved this recipe.  Easy and very good.  I used both white almond bark and chocolate, and prefer the chocolate.

I made this at Christmas to add with my cookies to hand out as gifts; A nice added treat. Four people asked for the recipe. Just a note: I didn't know what confectioners coating was. Turns out it's White Almond Bark.

YUMMY!!!  and soooo easy to make. It truly is a big hit and have copies of the recipe handy, they will be asking for it.  I used Heath's Toffee bits, couldn't find the Bits of Brickle, and it was very good.  I will have to look for the brickle, that would be awesome.
