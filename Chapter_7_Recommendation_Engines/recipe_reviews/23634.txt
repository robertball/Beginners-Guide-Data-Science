This recipe is REALLY lacking on liquid to cook rice.  I doubled the milk in the beginning and still was not enough.  I had to spend an extra 20 minutes adding water and more milk and microwaving (without chicken) to cook the rice.  The flavor in the end was really good but this recipe needs revision by author.

When making this dish, I could tell on sight before I even began that there would not be enough liquid.  I added 2 cups of water, and could have easily added some more.  The flavor was great, and had the liquid ratio been accurate in the original I would have given it 5 stars.  As it stands, though (as another reviewer has noted) the recipe need to be revised.  I will be making this again, though adding 3 cups of water along with the milk.

Just pondering this - but what I would do when making this is divide the one and a quarter cups of milk up evenly between the packages of Rice-A-Roni and use water for the rest. Then you would get the nice creamy flavor but not the stickiness.

This has potential.  agree with others - needs a lot more liquid.  Maybe prepare rice as directed before assembling recipe?!? Also it doesn't mention veggies or the amount to add.  I added sliced yellow squash, zucchini, diced onion (saute before).  I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs.  Once I compensated with water, it was better! I'll try again preparing rice ahead.

I did this a little different. I split everything in the recipe in half (because its only for 2 people) except for the cream of chicken soup and the milk (used what the recipe calls for) and then I used just 2 pork chops instead of chicken and baked it 5-10 minutes longer than recipe calls for w/ the pork chops cut into slices and it was AWESOME! I've also done it w/ chicken but same thing w/ cutting everything in half except for soup and milk because it's too dry if you do it exactly by the recipe in my opinion.

I used chicken drumsticks and removed the skin after cooking for about five minutes. I added one can of water after the cream of chicken soup and one can of chicken broth to the mixture. I also used one cup of regular rice and one box of rice a roni. I added one cup of frozen corn and one of frozen broccoli. I thought this was fine, not amazing, and will probably not make it again. But my husband loved it, he loves all concoctions of rice and veggies with chicken,  so thus it gets three stars.

I made this recipe because my family likes chicken rice-a-roni. Following the advice of others, I added 2 cups of water and that worked for the rice, but this recipe was just too salty and had an overpowering pepper taste(and I only used 1 tsp pepper!).  Just curious about the "veggies" in the title.  Definitely some ingredients were left out of this recipe.

I made this tonight and we thought that it tasted very good.  It was a simple and easy recipe.  I did take advice from some of the reviewers and added some water to it.  I added about a can and a half using my soup can.  I do think that there is entirely too much pepper.  Hubby and I can usually handle spices very well but this was overkill.  I think that if you use half of the pepper then it will be perfect.

Did not come out right at all! I followed all the directions and the rice came out hard and chewy.

I like the way the chicken is broiled then placed on top the rice. we did not care for the end result of the rice.

As noted in other reviews, the recipe needs much more liquid than it states.  I actually followed the directions on the Rice-A-Roni box for the liquid amount.  It should also be noted that the recipe calls for 2 10.75 oz boxes.  I could only find 6.5 oz boxes. This must be a very old recipe when boxes were bigger, yet the price was the same :).  You have to play around with the milk to water ratio.  I eliminated adding any additional salt since there is plenty of salt in the seasoning packets.  The other change I made was to cook for at least 45 minutes to absorb more of the liquid and cook the rice through.  At 30 mins, the rice is still way too underdone.  If you are a Rice-A-Roni fan, you will love this dish!  I would definitely make again.  This is one of those recipes that you can change up a bit(add vegetables, etc.). I love the broiling idea, especially if using thighs.  It gives it a grilled flavor as well as crisps the skin.  If you heed the warning about the liquid amount, you will enjoy this quick and easy dish!

Leave out the salt, the rice a roni is salty enough. 
For sure a keeper!
