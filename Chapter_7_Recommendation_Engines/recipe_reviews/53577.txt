This recipe as stated does not deserve 4 stars. The idea is good, but the recipe should be stated for ONE serving and leave it up to the cook to multiply.
Secondly, thick slices of eggplant, first microwaved then fried, do not work. The eggplant turns out too mushy. In each sanwich I would prefer to use 2 or 3 thinner slices that have been "oven fried" so there is a crispness to them. Avoid the use of too much mustard! Try using PepperJack cheese to give it some zing, and toast the rolls.

I did two batches of this recipe, one like the reviewers suggested with a shorter cooking time, and it tasted wonderful. The second batch i cooked the as long as the author suggested, and it tasted much much better. Having made too much, i ended up with leftovers. So, today, i came back home too tired to heat the food, so i ate it cold , in a pita with a tiny bit of hummos, and leftover slices of tomato. It was amazing. 

This is a wonderful recipe. It just gets better and better.

I was looking for a lower fat option when the rest of the family wanted grilled hamburgers.  I cut these the same size as the hamburger patties, sprayed a little cooking spray on them, seasoned just like the patties and put them on the grill for about 5 minutes.  I may never eat another hamburger!  Amazing!

Very good. Ate them on pita with garlic mayo, tomatoes, and mozz cheese. Would recommend micro-ing only 1-2 minutes to keep slices firm. Thanks

Good burgers. I coated them in flour/wheat germ/ cajun spice seasoning and fried them. Only microwaved them for 2min. I made a garlic and herb mayo for them and omitted ketchup and mustard. Ate with tomato, lettuce, relish and fried onions on toasted whole wheat buns.

I was skeptical about how flavorful these burgers could be, but I decided to try them after reading all the positive comments. I was pleasantly surprised (and am still mystified) by the amount of flavor, even without adding any seasonings. This is not to say it has a beefy flavor like a regular hamburger, but for what it is, it is very good. Cheap and simple to make, although I can't figure out how to keep the eggplant slices from soaking up the oil/butter. I will use this recipe in the future for most of my burger cravings - it is cheaper, easier, and healthier! One warning: the eggplant burgers are not as good the next day, even if you warm them up and put toppings on them.

After my boyfriend got through ranting "where's the MEAT???!!!" He told me he really liked these.  I thought they were quite delicious as well.  I took one of the reviewer's suggestions and used pepper jack, with that & the bite of raw onions they were quite tasty.  My honey did say the meal was a bit light for him & should have fries or tots as a side.  I would suggest 2 minutes instead of 5 in the microwave.

I made this yesterday for my 4 y/o and I, and we both gobbled them up! Very easy to prepare, but I skipped the microwaving as it made them too mushy. 
Wonderful idea, and a great choice for our first eggplant experience :)

My fiance and I have never had eggplant before, and were a little skeptical that it could make good burgers.  WE BOTH LOVED THEM!!!  We each had 2 burgers, and I will make this alot from now on!!

We just tried this for lunch - and we will certainly make it again! We stuck to the directions, except that we sauteed mushrooms and onions to go on top. The mushrooms and onions made the burgers! I think it would have really been missing something without them (thus, only 4 stars for as-is recipe). Next time, we might try grilling them or using some kind of sauce (blue cheese dressing sounds good). Thanks for a new veggie burger recipe!

YUM! So good. Admittedly, I did cook the eggplant a little differently because it's a mushy vegetable as it is and I didn't want it to get soggy. I sweated the eggplant slices for a half hour or so, rinsed and patted dry, dipped in egg whites and then Panko bread crumbs and baked at 350 for 10 minutes per side. The Panko gave it a nice crunchy exterior and sweating and then baking it kept the eggplant from getting soggy - cooking it in margarine will just cause the eggplant to soak that all up. Great concept - I'd never heard of eggplant burgers before. I'll make them again. Thanks :)

Great recipe. I didn't have burger buns, tomatoes or monterey jack but needed to use up a big eggplant so I substituted focaccia, mozzarella and omitted the tomato.  Delicious, although I don't think the mozzarella would be my 1st choice for cheese.  I look forward to trying this recipe exactly as written next time.

I was skeptical at first that this would be good but I like trying new and healthy things.  The tast of the eggplant is subtal and when combined with the flavors of the tomatoe, lettuce and condiments, it blends for a nice flavor.  My 4 yr. old did'nt like the look of the it but when she tasted it she said  "emmm, these are good mom". Thanks for a great recipe.

Why are these great? I don't really know, but they are. Definitely add the red onion and garlic mayo--it is fantastic with eggplant. The only thing is that they weren't very filling. I would make them double burgers and put two eggplant slices on each bun. Also, the three minutes in the microwave was a bit much in mine, so try half of that to start. You don't want dried-out eggplant.

This was INCREDIBLE and so simple I could make in on a week night with no problem. I added my own garlic mayo and red onion which really brought out the taste of the eggplant. You can also use mozzarella and a little tomato sauce for a quickie version of eggplant parm.

I didn't follow the recipe per se, but going with the idea, I peeled & sliced eggplants about 3/4" thick, salted & peppered, then lightly coated in olive oil. I then cooked them in my George Foreman grill. I didn't time them, just checked every few minutes until they were tender, but they really didn't take long at all.

I buttered and toasted the inside of hamburger buns on a skillet on the stove (only because my toaster oven recently bit the dust). I sprinkled finely shredded mozzarella cheese on the inside of each bun half (merely because that is what I had on hand). I placed the eggplant slices on the buns, then sprinkled a hot sauce (like tabasco) on them, spread a little honey mustard on them,  added sliced red onion and lettuce (no tomatoes on hand, or they'd have been on there, too).

I insisted my husband be brutally honest and tell me if he liked them, assuring him I'd fix him something different if he didn't. He said they were "fine", but he did eat two!  I thought they were DELICIOUS! From start to finish, the meal was on the table in under a half hour.

I was really hopeful with all the great reviews, but I did not care for the texture of this.  The only reason it came close to burger-like was all the toppings are burger toppings...it would have been better without the eggplant at all.  Nobody I served it to could finish it and we all wanted real burgers after.

Good idea - I brushed the eggplant with olive oil, sprinkled w/Cavender's Greek seasoning, and baked in 450degree oven instead of microwaving and frying. Better taste and texture. Then dressed buns with lite mayo and added thin red onion slices and kosher dill pickles. Yummy!

I don't know why these are good. I read the recipe and thought it would be flavorless..it's not. This is a really good burger, and it's soooo easy. The second time I made them, I added a little Worcestershire sauce to the eggplant after they came out of the microwave and I really enjoyed that flavor.

I peeled and sliced the eggplant and then left to rest (maybe for 15 mins) on a plate in the fridge after I sprinkled both sides of the eggplant with salt.  This drew out all the water and bitter taste an eggplant can have (I do this regardless of how I cook eggplant).  I then squeeze dried the eggplant between paper towels, brushed with a little EVOO and put under the broiler of my toaster oven.  Cooked until tender and crispy looking around the edges (did not flip to expose other side, it cooked fine). No butter, no frying. Served with tomatoes, roasted red peppers, thin slices of a sweet onion, fresh spinach, and mayo on a toasted sourdough sub roll.  Delicious!!  No cheese for me---cheese does not like me!!  It was so good I had the leftover eggplant the same way that night for supper, just reheated the eggplant in the toaster oven. Thanks for the great recipe idea.  Will make again and again.  Word of caution, take it easy if you add roasted red pepper, you can easily lose the taste of the eggplant to the pepper.

VERY GOOD. Great idea. Changed recipe a tiny bit though.. I coated the slices with egg and bread crumbs and placed in oven on greased cookie sheet. Frying them in oil makes them very greasy.    I will make these again and again. THANK YOU.

This was actually pretty good.  I found it only needed one minute in the microwave.  Better than the 'hamburger' idea...it was great to learn a low/non fat way of preparing eggplant.  I live in the Mid-East where eggplants are very abundant...but they are almost always fried when used in local cuisine and they soak up a LOT of oil.  Up until now, I have always avoided eggplant for that reason.  Thanks for the great tip.

This was a huge letdown. I followed the directions and microwaved the slices. They were very mushy. My eggplant loving vegetarian friend even thought this was a very poor recipe. I won't make this again.

Four stars with Modification. After microwaving, I breaded the "patties". I used plain bread crumbs and seasoned with paprika, garlic powder, Cajun seasoning and Morton's nature seasons seasoning blend. After breading I pan fried them. for pan frying I did not use butter but PAM cooking spray.

I used havarti cheese with black pepper on it and they were awesome. I really loved these burgers and would make them for family and friends!

So yummy! I even forgot the cheese and the were delicious. I toasted the buns and topped them with romaine, tomatoes, ketchup, and spicy mustard. Delicious! I think muenster cheese next time will make them to die for! Be prepared though...the eggplant takes longer to fry than one would think. I used olive oil to fry them as well. Thanks!

I have never really liked eggplants as an adult.  However, this recipe is awesome, and has saved me from making yet another pasta or stir-fry dinner for my newly-converted vegetarian husband. Thanks!

I love the idea for these burgers and I was super excited to make them. You just have to watch out how you cook the eggplant -- it's a very watery vegetable and becomes mushy VERY easily in the microwave. If I make these again, I will put the eggplant directly on the stove after cutting and peeling it.

YUM! you won't want another hamburger again!It's fast,budget friendly, and absolutely delicious. I top them off with pepper-jack cheese and a mayonnaise, garlic,& dill weed dressing. They're a favorite of my husband, who is a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy!

I love these burgers! Tasty and healthy! I was skeptical at first, but I am glad I gave this a try.
I will definitely make again for myself, but will have to make a "real hamburger" for my boyfriend even though he said he liked these.

My kids and husband were not too thrilled with the recipe, but they are big meat eaters.  I loved it.  I did some with butter and some with out.  They liked the butter better.  I also did not use the mayonnaise because the family hates mayo.  Still great.

Excellent!  I made mine on the grill because I was afraid it would get too soggy.  I also used low fat cheese.

The microwaving made it a bit soggy, so next time I won't do that. Tasted pretty good for my first time cooking with eggplant. Had it with tomatoes and ketchup and a teensy bit of mayo. When I have the leftovers, I'll put it in a pita with more veggies.

Pretty good...I breaded my slices with panko breadcrumbs and baked in the oven.  Topped with swiss cheese and sauteed onions and mushrooms, mayo, relish and ketchup.  I enjoyed it as did my friend but my hubby didn't care too much for a meatless burger...typical guy!

I give this recipe 4 stars but I took the advice of another reviewer and instead of frying them I put them on the BBQ grill.  I did not microwave them first.  I did brush them with a little olive oil and added salt and pepper before putting them on the grill. I also grilled the buns just a bit. The "burgers" were delicious.

Great idea.  I had an eggplant and decided to try this.  I think next time I'll try more seasoning with it.  Great for variety.  Thanks!

I've never cooked with eggplants before.  Most eggplant recipes take too long to prepare and cook.  What I really like about this recipe is that it's incredibly fast to make.  I'm not sure if I enjoyed it so much because of the condiments I put on it, regardless I'd made it again.

This was surprisingly good and probably the easiest & quickest eggplant meal I've ever prepared! I followed the recipe per the instructions with just a few minor substitutions: microwaved 6-7 mins instead of 5 to get the centers soft (my slices may have been closer to 1" thick rather than 3/4"), used 2 tbsp butter instead of 1 tbsp margarine for frying/toasting, seasoned with onion powder, skipped the sliced onion topping, and didn't use any ketchup topping cuz it really didn't need it. The texture was a little soft for a "burger" but the flavor was right on - definitely better than a traditional veggie-burger. I'll likely be making this one again cuz it was such a healthy meal & so delicious!

I made this when we had nothing left in the house except hamburger fixings and an egplant. And it was great! My husband ate three. We are vegitarians and we loved them. I willl definatly make them agian. I only cooked the eggplant for a little less than 2 mins to make sure the eggplant wasnt to soft.

I made these because of all the great reviews. Even only microwaving for 2 mins makes eggplant mushy. If I make them again I will bread n fry or bake for crispness but I'm not in a rush to make these again. No one in my family liked them. :(

AMAZING! I let them sweat, then seasoned them like I would a hamburger with a lil' EVOO and then grilled them. I used 3/4 inch but next time I will use about 1/2 inch and layer. I did not even try the microwave. Topped with swiss cheese and sauteed mushrooms. Husband used blue cheese dressing on them, I stuck with ketchup and mustard. YUMMY 5 STARS!

Fabulous idea and great taste!  Being a mom of a 2 year old I don't have much time to be in the kitchen.  Followed the cooking directions and it came out perfect.  Maybe people are having issues because of the different wattages of microwaves out there.  Mine is a small 700 watt and takes sometimes double the amount of suggested cooking time.  I cooked it for 5 minutes and it came out perfect.  No sogginess or falling apart.  Maybe because I cut thick slices too.  I didn't have any sliced cheese but they didn't need it.  My husband would have liked sliced onions on top and maybe lettuce and tomato but he liked it fine just with the bun and condiments.  You can dress these up however each family member likes.

No, they're not beef burgers, but you also don't get that heavy feeling in your stomach like you do after eating a regular burger, so I'd have to say they're pretty darn good! Also, you can't beat how easy they are to make! The only thing I'd do differently next time is make the eggplant slices thinner - maybe put 2 thin slices on each bun instead of 1 thick slice - or else cook the thicker slices a bit longer. My first attempt's slices were cooked well enough, but could have been browned a little more before serving. Definitely worth making again though!

wow..super good.  My husband made these tonight and they were very tasty.  We have eggplant in our garden and have been trying to come up with new ways to use them.  This recipe was definitely a hit.  I was a little unsure when he said he was making eggplant burgers but they were very good and healthy!  We topped them with fried onion, garlic mayo, heirloom tomato, lettuce, and poblano peppers.  Based on the other reviews he microwaved them for less time than the recipe stated.

I am so glad I tried this recipe I have made these burgers 3 times now. The first time I made them in a skillet. I thought they were good. The other two times I made them on the BBQ, by BBQing the eggplant. Also I added cheddar cheese and sprouts. Since my husband is vegan, I used vegan cheese and mayo on his and he thought they were terrific!

We were a little hesitant at first about this, but as soon as we started eating them that changed! Like others said, it was a little mushy, but so healthy. Definately do not make these if you are looking for a burger substitute, but if you want to put more veggies in your diet, like we do, this is great. We put the eggplant slices on bagels to add more texture/flavor, and used horseradish mustard. Even my 2-year old ate some!

What a great idea.  You have to really love your veggies to like this recipe.  And we LOVE our veggies in this house.  I'm not a big fan of eggplant parmesan, so I was intrigued when I came across this idea.  I am also not a big fan of the microwave so I throw them in the oven for a few minutes at 450.  Then I fry them up in a pan with extra virgin olive oil.  I know that is not the recipe, but I think this was more of an idea than a recipe.  Still give it 5 stars!!!!!!!!  And we dress our burgers with whatever we like.

We loved these burgers... but I did them a bit differently.  I sliced them thinner than what the recipe says, and baked them in the oven on 450 (took them out when they were crispy on the outside, but still tender on the inside), and topped mine with chipotle cheddar cheese.  Delicious & easy!

I didn't have burger buns so I used french bread and also only had american cheese and that worked fine. I dont like crunchy onions so I sauteed them in the margarine with the eggplant. Yum! For this non-beef eater, this is my new "cheeseburger".

Very very good.  Everyone who has tried these loved them.  HINT: I also fry the insides of the burger buns!

These aren't going to fool anyone about its being a burger.  It has the meatiness like portabello mushrooms do.  As good as the spices or toppings you choose.  'Doubt I'll make 'em again.  'Didn't microwave, just panned 'em.  And I think the 20 ounce bottle of ketchup may be too much.  ;D

These burgers are wonderful! I didn't use hamburger buns because I don't like them so I put it on whole grain wheat toast and they were still excellent. My mother who rarely likes anything I cooked even loved them. I will make them again definitely. Thanks for the recipe.

Holy COW these were delicious!!  We used our George Foreman grill and these took less than 5 min to cook!  Took another reviewer's advice and used pepper jack cheese to top - my husband loved, but I thought it was too spicy.  We are DEFINITELY adding this to our regular dinner rotation!!

Would have been better if I had read to peel them.  Definitely PEEL them.  And I sprinkled with pepper and baked.  Ate with hummus, avocado, and lettuce.

I loved this idea! My son and I are gluten free so buying special veg burgers gets so expensive. The first night we ate these as the recipe sugg-- with ketchup and garlic mayo, etc. The next day we had them on rolls with italian cheeses and pasta sauce-- a mock eggplant parm; it was awesome!

I didn't like this.  My husband and I are both vegetarians.  He thought it was ok.  Maybe I didn't cook the eggplant slices right.  I don't know.  But I'd rather have a veggie patty over this.  The texture wasn't good and the slices shrink when heated up.  If you like meat way too much then this isn't for you.  I won't make this again and would rather have a portebello or veggie patty over this.  I followed the directions to a T and it just didn't come out well at all.

I didn't really enjoy these.  I followed the instructions closely, but they were still quite soggy and flavourless, and I was not a fan of the texture.

This was great! It was super quick (I omitted the microwave cooking time to prevent soggy eggplant), it was filling. My carnivorous husband went back for seconds. We'll definitely make this again.

These burgers were very delicious. We used a small eggplant and small sandwich rolls for buns, and put lettuce, fried onion rings, ketchup and mustard on top. Absolutely scrumptious!

These were really great. Even my husband who doesn't normally like eggplant wants me to make again. I did cut my slices a bit smaller, and used two or three on the burgers. For my husband's I used a bun. For mine, because I'm diabetic, I used a low carb tortilla. Very good. Next time, I'm not going to bother cooking in microwave first.

Very good. I took the advice of one reviewer and didn't microwave but breaded and fryed in the frying pan. Also to save on cals, omit the bum and use romaine lettuce to hold it all together.

This is a really wonderful idea, but I had to change up the recipe so much to make it to my tastes that I only give the recipe as is three stars.  I definitely recommend breading these and cooking them in the oven.  It leaves them with a wonderful texture.

Very good! I nuked them for a minute, then used onion salt, seasoning salt and a garlic pepper grinder while they were cooking.  (Turned out a bit salty, so next time I'll just salt one side).  Also, I added pesto with the  mayo, and omitted the ketchup and mustard.  Very yummy!

Loved it!  Grill the eggplant on the BBQ along with onions and red bel peppers.  Brush them with olive oil and season with garlic salt first.  Use a little chunky blue cheese dressing as spread.  Tasty, mmmm!

It was pretty good but I don't know how anyone would not realize this wasn't meat :) I microwaved  the eggplants for about 4 minutes and they came out quite mushy. The melted cheese on the eggplants were fantastic though. Would make this again, but will try to lessen the microwave cooking time to make eggplant pieces more solid.

This recipe was okay. I tried it regular with ketchup and mustard, tomato and lettuce. It was very plain. I saw the reviews and decided to try to jazz it up a little with terriyaki sauce. It was a bit better that way, though I didn't fry it in the terriyaki sauce since I had already fried them before realizing that they needed something else. Don't know if I'll make again or not.

I gave this a 5, my husband and son gave it a 3 - so we averaged a 4! This was easy to make. Like the other reviewers, we skipped the microwaving - they didn't need it. We just fried the slices and followed the directions, using all the fixings. I don't usually like pickles on my burgers, but liked the tastes together. Thanks Irv!

This is such a good idea.  I am always looking for small dinner dishes during the week, and this was perfect.  One eggplant will last me all week.  And it tastes so good.  I definitely recommend this!

This was delicious, even though I didn't cut my eggplant thick enough (I thought I did), so when I cooked it, it was soggy. I skipped microwaving it so I am not sure if that affected the consistency. I skipped the butter, onions and ketchup, and I used my George Forman grill. I used shredded skim mozzarella cheese as well. I added peppered bacon, because...bacon. (I am not a vegetarian.) Even with that, it was delicious and I will definitely make it again! So glad I found this idea online.

Made this out of curiosity, and definitely glad I followed the advise of some of the other reviewers. Only microwaved the eggplant for 1-2 minutes, and seasoned them with salt/pepper/cumin before browning them. I used pepper jack cheese, which gave them a nice extra spice. When you put them on a bun with all the usual burger trimmings, you can't really tell the difference! I'd definitely make them again.

My husband and I loved these burgers. I tried it both thinly sliced and as suggested in the recipe and loved the thicker recipe version more. Because we love spicy food, pepper jack and pimento peppers were the only alternatives made. My husband was sceptical about these but changed his mind after the first bite!!

Delicious and easy! My boyfriend and I loved them. Like other reviewers, I only cooked in the microwave for 2 minutes. I'll be sure to cut the slices a little thicker next time, too. Yum!

rather mushy,  i felt it was rather flavorless.  i think next time ill just layer smaller pieces of eggplant and season it up a little. maybe with hambuger seasonings like season all or something.  decent recipe in theory though kudos on the idea.

Excellent. A very good way to get the kids to eat their vegetables.

This was a pretty good recipe, although I would have probably microwaved them less next time. Surprisingly good flavor for what it is.

Awesome variation to a normal veggie burgers. Cheap too! My kids were a little nervous about them but I'll make them again anyway.
Thanks!

not bad..have made them a couple of times for myself, but doesn't replace a veggie burger, good, but different. and you have to keep checking them in the microwave and make sure you cut them thick enough otherwise they get mushy and fall apart.

Very nice! 2 mins in the microwave ensures that it comes out firm. Anything more than that seems to make it soggy.

These were amazingly good.  I've made them several times.  Not really burger-ish, but a fantastic sandwich.

Very fast and a nice way to eat eggplant.  Will try microwaving less next time, 5 minutes was way too long and they got a bit mushy.  One eggplant was just enough for me and my husband (3 slices per bun)--maybe we bought a small one.

What a great idea! Easy and delicious! My teenage daughter will actually make them for herself. Easy enough that I often make them for myself for lunch. As a vegetarian always on the lookout for easy, nutritious meals, thank you!

I have never really eaten too many eggplants, but when I saw how quick and easy this was to make... I gave it a try.  My wife and I loved them!  We are both vegaterians and this really was a great substitute for a hamburger without having to pay for a "veggie-burger".  Cheap, easy and tasty.

After reading all the great reviews I was excited to give these burgers a try. Wow I was sadly disappointed with the taste. These were awful! They were tastless. I will never make these again.

This is a delicious way to have a quick vegetarian meal.  My husband hates eggplant but he just loved this recipe. Thank you Irv.
