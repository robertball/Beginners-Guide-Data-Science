Oustanding! Perfect texture and flavor - not overly sweet, full-on blueberry-ful. I increased the filling by 1/2 (using 1/2 of a beaten egg) to fill a deep-dish pie pan, so mine needed about 15 minutes longer baking time. This sets and slices beautifully when chilled (I didn't serve any until I chilled it, so I'm not sure how it does warm). Thanks for the recipe!

This was big on flavor but short on looks in my view, particularly the topping.  Hubs really enjoyed it, however, describing it as full of blueberry flavor and pleasantly sweet, and in my book that's what counts.

This was incredibly simple to make and very delicious.  The center wasn't set at all when I pulled it out after 25 minutes to add the topping, so I baked for an additional 10 minutes before adding the topping.  Also, one of my dinner guests is allergic to tree nuts, so I substituted brown sugar for the pecans, and it was still very flavorful and crunchy.

Absolutely the best dessert! I'll be making this again and again. I used frozen blueberries, frozen pie crusts, omitted the pecans, and upped the flour/sugar to make up for the missing nuts. Amazing! I didn't even dirty my mixer, just mixed by hand. Can I say more? My new favorite!  UPDATE: I used a crust made of 6 oz cream cheese, 1 c. butter and 2 cups flour. Chill at least an hour or up to a week. Roll dough fairly thick and place in pan. Trim edge leaving an inch or so around. Fold under and flute edge so it stands up a bit to hold more filling. I doubled the filling and most of it fit. I baked the rest in a custard cup, lined with trimmed pie crust. The pie took quite a long time to bake - I'm guessing over an hour. Bake until the center is set, then top with crumble. The crumble seemed like it had too much butter, so I added about 2 T. more each of flour, sugar and pecans.  Bake until browned - using the broiler if needed.  The crust baked up nice and crisp.

I just made this the other day and OMG it is delicious!. I wasn't going to use the pecans because I didn't have any but decided to wait a day and get a tiny bag in the baking section of the store. The crunch it gives to the topping is perfect. Wonderful with a little ice cream on top as well as plain. Definitely plan to make this again.

Fabulous and easy! I substituted vanilla yogurt for the sour cream (since I had none of that on hand), and the results were scrumptious! The taste and pop of the fresh berries comes through wonderfully...not overcooked, not mushy. The "custard" is light and smooth, not overly eggy (maybe that's what the other reviewer expected). Great warm, but keeps nicely in the fridge. You can zap pieces in the micro to warm if desired. Put this together in a snap, all by hand. No need for the mixer.

From the reviews, it looks like you all love this pie as much as I do.  When I posted this recipe, I forgot to mention that I add 2 teaspoons of Chinese Five Spice or Cake Spice to the topping.  It gives it that extra zing!  Thank you all for reviewing so warmly!  Nonnie Z

I made this exactly as written, and it was perfect. I brought it to a birthday party, and people raved and said that it was the best blueberry pie they've ever had! Please use fresh blueberries! Also, I only had whole pecans, so I ground them in the food processor, and the pieces ended up smaller than regular chopped pecans. Next time I will use half chopped pecans and half smaller pecans ground in the food processor--I think that will make a really crunchy topping! Thank you for a great recipe, it's a keeper.

This was an awesome pie. It's a lot quicker to get in the oven than a traditional blueberry pie and only dirties a mixing bowl, so I doubt I'll even go the boil-with-cornstarch route anymore. It's so creamy and refreshing with the dairy, and the fresh blueberry taste comes through perfectly. I'll probably try with other fruit too. For my preference I'll use brown sugar in the topping but that's all I would change, thank you so much for sharing.

This pie was delicious!  It was very simple to make.  I made it in a stoneware pie pan, so it took about 10 minutes longer to cook (after the topping was addend) than the recipe called for.  I will definitely make this again!

Great Pie!  I am on my 3rd version this summer. I have added more blueberries, used splenda and whole wheat pastry flour and lite sour cream...just delicious!  None of my guests have ever suspected that I made it a bit healthier.  I make Martha Stewarts "Easy Pie Crust", just because I prefer a butter crust versus oil/shortening.   TRY THIS RECIPE---EASY AND DELICIOUS FOR LESS SKILLED BAKERS!  Thank you!

I am not usually a huge fan of blueberry pie. My husband is though, so I made this one. We all loved this. It is beyond good and not too sweet.

I have my own blueberry bushes so I needed to use up what I had in the freezer before my new crop comes in this year. I made this last night and it was great. I had to cook about 10-15 minutes longer only because my berries were frozen. My husband loved it. This is definitely a keeper. The topping compliments the berries.

I made this as one of my mom's b-day pies.  This has been getting a lot of attention on the RE and I'd been looking forward to trying it out.  Our 6 year old niece deemed it her favorite of the 3 and everyone else seemed to enjoy it, too.  I followed the recipe, though I did have to sub frozen blueberries for fresh due to seasonality.  I also subbed almonds for pecans per personal preference.  I have to rate it "4" because the baking time was substantially off for me.  I baked per the recipe and when I went to pack the pie realized it was SUPER un-set, so I actually placed it back in the oven (for about 20 min) to set up.  If I make this again, I will prob make 1.5X the amount of topping, too.

I loved this pie! I added a layer of rolled out almond paste to the raw pie dough before I filled it. This was the ticket to a yummier pie! I did have to bake it longer then it stated as well. I added crushed toasted almonds instead of the pecans and it was delish!! A scoop of vanilla and this is a real winner! MMM Fabulous:) Thank You Nonnie

This is so simple to make and has huge flavor.  The custard with all the blueberries is a little bit of heaven and the streusel just elevates this even more.  Will make again for sure.  Thanks Nonnie!

A SUPER easy, awesome dessert!  Here are the things I  did differently . . . 1. I used about 1 1/2 cups of fresh blueberries and about 1 cup of fresh blackberries.  The store didn't have enough blueberries :)  I cut the larger blackberries in half as well.  I think that any combination of berry would have been great with this pie (as long as you don't mind the seeds from the blackberries, etc).  2. Used a frozen (but thawed) 9 inch deep dish pie crust.  I thought about increasing the filling but didn't have enough sour cream so I just used the original amount.  It worked out just fine!  3. Used lite sour cream.  4.  I did use pecans for the topping but you really wouldn't have to.  I don't know if I would add them again.  5. Covered the crust of my pie with tin foil so it wouldn't burn after I add the crumble topping.  Baked until the crumble topping was a golden brown and the center looked set -- this took longer than the 15 minutes.  6. The pie was pretty good warm but AWESOME the next day cold.

Very good and so easy to make.  The fact that it calls itself a "custard" pie is misleading I think.  There is only one egg and altho delish, it doesn't have the typical custard consistency.  I used almonds instead of pecans because that was all I had....I agree you need the nuts for the crunch on top.  It was so lovely from the oven I took a picture of it!!

Very good pie! I doubled the amount of topping for a 26 cm pie (10 inches and 1/2). For the crust I used the recipe "Pie Crust IV" on this website, also doubled. It is great with vanilla ice cream! Yummy!

11 24 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/186935/true-blue-custard-crunch-pie/ ... My original review disappeared.  The crunchy topping wasn't crunchy for me, only added more sugar; unnecessary.  Cheesecake-ish, if I remember correctly.  Note:  1c sour cream.  2 1/2c blue. Pie crust.
Similar to this ... https://thesouthernladycooks.com/2011/06/16/sour-cream-blueberry-pie/ ... This looks good, too.  Nanny.  :)

This is delicious! I had to use plain low-fat yogurt instead of sour cream, and frozen blueberries-but had no problems with the pie setting up, though it had to bake 45 minutes total. I didn't have pecans, so I processed brown and white sugars with the other ingredients plus a graham cracker. The result was very tasty, and visually pleasing. I didn't have to add all of the topping since I wanted some of the filling to be visible. The topping browned very quickly- and I had to cover the edges with foil for the last 15 or so minutes or the crust would have burned. This is very easy and well worth the effort! I will definitely make this again. Thank you, Baker Beth!

I have trouble rating this pie. For the first time I baked this pie with blueberries and it was a little bland, lack of blueberry flavor. Then I tried to make this pie with apples and it turned out fantastic. I used brown sugar with apples. Half of my pie was eaten less in 30 min. All I can say, thank you for my new applepie recipe.a

I took this to a dinner party last night.  Everyone loved it.  The streusel on top was fantastic and really added to the over-all yumminess.  I did make more streusel than called for, and toasted the pecans first.  I cut the sugar in the pie down by a third.  I'm not a sweet sweet lover and found this to be perfect.  I served it with vanilla ice cream.  I'll definitely make it again.

I doubled the recipe and made 2 pies.  The pie is delicious. Followed the directions exactly. I did bake it longer than stated, 60 minutes and I had to put aluminum foil around the edge of the pie crust to prevent it from burning. When I put a knife in the middle to test it, the knife kept coming out with a soupy liquid on it, but Keri suggested it may set when it cools and she was right. This is a great recipe and will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe as is. Have also played around: 1. used the crunch topping on other similar pies; 2. subbed meringue for crunch topping; 3. added a healthy size TBLS of lemon zest to cream filling (Lemon/blueberry combo is personal favorite). All great. Obviously, I've made this several times. The first time, it was gone in less than 24 hours. Made great breakfast! (It has fruit & eggs so it counts.)

This was so quick and easy to make, as well as delicious.  I didn't slice it until it was chilled over night, and it sliced very well, but I imagine it wouldn't do that when still warm.  I used half blueberries, and half cherries because we like that fruit combination.  Will make this again.

OH MY! This was heaven on a plate! I used a frozen pie crust and I changed the topping a little. I didn't add pecans, but I did add 1 T. flour, 1 T. white sugar, 2 T. brown sugar and 2 T. oats...it made the perfect streusal topping. I had to bake the filling for 33 minutes and then 15 for the topping. I can't wait to try other fruits with this!

How wonderful! I have a love hate relationship with blueberry pie, in that I love it, but it's so sweet that I can rarely eat more than a few bites. Not this pie. I loved it, and am looking forward to eating it all week.

This is very tasty.  I followed the recipe as written except that I didn't have the full amount of sour cream on hand so I used half sour cream and half cream cheese.  We served it cold and at room temperature and it was great either way.  We will make this again.

This is really good. Just the right amount of sweetness and loads of blueberry flavor. And it was super easy to put together. I did use frozen berries since that is what I had on hand. Also the crumb topping that I made just kind of sunk down into the pie when I put it on top. Don't think  its the recipe, I have never been able to make a good crumb topping. :( But it was good anyway :)

This is a very good pie! I made it with frozen blueberries (fresh are out of season here, and super expensive) and it turned out just fine. I really liked it, as did some of my siblings. My dad, however, preferred my usual blueberry pie recipe, so I suppose  that this isn't for everyone. Other than using the frozen berries, I made this exactly as written. If I make it again, I will probably use less vanilla and add some cinnamon to both the filling and topping. I felt that the combination of flavors and textures were awesome in this pie...the topping really made it special. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

This was amazing and easy to make. The only thing I would change next time would be to leave out the pecans in the topping (just a personal preference). Will be making again.

I had to use frozen blueberries, but the pie still turned out just fine. I used walnuts because I didn't have pecans. This is incredibly easy to make, and the "custard" holds the pie together when you slice it which is a big plus in my book!

I made this exactly as written except I used a pie shield for the entire baking time.   I cooled it at room temperature and then refrigerated it overnight before serving with a little RediWip.   I got five big thumbs-up from my guests.   I'll definitely make this pie again soon.   Thanks for sharing this recipe, Baker Betty.

This dessert tasted pretty good, but is not really a custard pie. I followed the recipe and got a floppy mess when sliced and served. I would recommend cutting back on the sour cream and adding actual custard that will set.

I followed this recipe to the letter and after 25 minutes it came out of the oven burned! I baked it on upper 3rd rack? Just hoping it tastes alright. As it has to go in for another 15 min with crumble topping, I turned oven down to 300 and keeping my fingers crossed!

I made this for my brother's birthday because he loves blueberry pie.  He thought this was great and everyone else did too.  I made the recipe as directed, except I realized too late that I didn't have any walnuts, so I followed the advice of another reviewer and subbed in brown sugar instead.  It was amazing!

Yum!  I had to bake it for about 15 minutes longer than it said, but it turned out perfectly! I love regular blueberry pie, but I like this better!

Quite yummy and not quite like any other pie I've made before. It disappeared quickly and I will be making it again sometime soon. Five star recipe.

I made this for my FIL, who LOVES blueberries. He gave it 5 stars & then some! I baked an additional 10 minutes(added 5 min before the topping & ended up having to add 5 more min after adding the topping), covering the crust w/foil so it wouldn't burn after the first bake.

Wonderful.  I made the pie exactly as the recipe called for and it was perfect.  I am not a big fan of blueberry pie but this was not too sweet and with the crunch of the pecans it had nice contrasts in flavor and texture.

This pie was fantastic! It was the perfect balance of sweet and tart, easy to make, and my family loved it. I used plain yogurt in place of the sour cream and added a little cinnamon to the filling.

I made it exactly as instructed.  By far the best blueberry pie ever.  Had two friends over and they loved it and wanted the recipe. My friend made it for her friend who is a professional chef and it blew her socks off.  I’ve used the custard and doubled the sugar for rhubarb pie and loved it as well.

What a treat this was ! Husband and kids wouldn't even wait for it to cool down completely ! Not only, this pie was super delicious, it was easy and quick to make ! 
I followed the recipe closely, except by using walnuts for pecans ( what I had available ). You might need to use a pie crust shield, the last 15 minutes of baking.

So easy and delicious.  Don't neglect the 2 tsp. Chinese Five Spice powder in the streusel that is mentioned in the video but not the recipe.  It adds a lot of interesting flavor.

I made this for Christmas. I used fresh blueberries but didn’t have enough, so I used a little bit of frozen black cherries.
My husband liked it a lot. I liked it because it wasn’t too sweet.
I had to cook it longer than it said. I was in the middle of making all my Christmas sides so I probably should have cooked it longer.

EXCELLENT  So easy to put together . I had a pre-rolled  pastry shell and filling is easy to put together. I had frozen berries.
Thaw in sugar for a bit then add sour cream mixture  and 
place in shell. Needs pecans I think. That’s what gives it a bit of a twist. Very good, and fine looking , but true, not real pretty.
Will not stop me from making again though.

I loved the pie, it came out pretty good, everyone loved it...but I did botch it a bit. I used frozen blueberries and when they thawed I didn't bother to strain the juices out, so it was a bit liquidy. I also over mixed the berries into the custard so I didn't get that nice white custard peeking through, it was all blue...but still delicious...

This was really tasty and easy to make. Followed the recipe exactly and it's perfect. You definitely need to let the pie cool before serving, even refrigerating it works well. Will definitely make again.

This pie is decicious!  I didn't want to pay $6.00+ per cup of fresh blueberries so I used frozen.  I thawed them before baking and, of course, the color bled into the custard.  I had a beautiful purple pie that tasted wonderful!  I will definitely make this again!

this pie exceeded my expectations. It was so easy and quick.  I made one, and it turned out so great that I made another the same morning.  I actually had to line the edges with fresh blueberries to make it look nicer, as for some reason the pie puffed up and then fell, which left an empty border where the crumb crust went missing. will definitely make again.

I've made this twice now and it's unbelievably good. I think I might start making this without the topping as a breakfast pie as it kind of reminds me of my favorite yogurt.

This pie is really good cold.  A refreshing summer dessert.  However, I would strongly advise against the idea of Chinese 5 Spice in the topping, as the video suggests.  It really took away from the pie in my opinion.

Really good last night while still warm...pieces did not come out of the pan attractively (as reviewers stated), but may look better today. I followed the recipe except for using brown sugar in lieu of white sugar in the topping. Will reduce the salt by half the next time I make this.

Great fresh blueberry recipe!  I used fat free greek yogurt instead of sour cream and brown sugar instead of white for the topping.  I forgot the salt and it seemed fine without.  I followed the directions and it set up with no problem.  I let it sit about 5 minutes before cutting- no mess!  It tasted great and it wasn't too sweet.

My husband...who is fussy about pies...loved it! The sour cream is prefect in this pie. Followed directions exactly as indicated and it turned out great. Crumble topping adds a nice crunch. A definite keeper!

I was a bit leary of this recipe since neither hubby or I like custards, but since the ingredients didn't sound like a custard to me, I took a chance and fortunately I was right, this is NOT a custard in the true sense of the word.
Made exactly as written, except for grating the cold butter into crumb mixture.  Had really good taste and appearance. Will definitely make again.

I have to admit that I'm not a fan of pie, but made this from my father who loves blueberry pie.  He was not a fan of having custard in his blueberry pie.  I didn't like the consistency very much, so I won't be making this again.

This is a VERY nice blueberry pie!  I wasn't so sure, but gave it a try and will definitely make this again.  I did use less sugar in the filling, and only 2 T butter in the topping (and it was still too much, I think), so because adjustments were necessary I dropped it from 5 stars to 4.

This pie is absolutely fantastic, and so easy to make. I did not use pecans in the topping because some of my family doesn't like nuts. Instead, I added another tablespoon of flour and another tablespoon of sugar. I also used 1/4 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice in the topping. We ate the pie cold, but I'm sure it is great warm too. I will be making this again, and I may try apples, cherries, or raspberries another time too.  Thanks for a quick, easy recipe.

Delicious.  I used 2 cups of sliced fresh strawberries and 1 cup of frozen blueberries.  Otherwise, I followed the above directions.  This made an eye appealing colorful pie.  Plus, it was yummy.

Wonderful recipe!  My family loved it and it was so easy to make.  My only problem was I didn't have "real" butter so the streusel topping wasn't as good as it should've been.  This will be my "go to" blueberry pie from now on.

I took this to a 4th of July party and people raved about it.  I followed the directions exactly except for the baking - mine took probably 15 min longer (10 longer for the first bake and then 5 longer for the topping).  The only thing I'd do differently next time is make 2 pies!

A little different and very good.  My son-in-law does not care for nuts in desserts so I substituted toffee bits for the pecans which made it a little sweeter but very nice flavor.  Next time I'll cut the sugar in the topping to balance it.  I also baked it a bit longer to make the topping nice and crunchy and it was even after being refrigerated.  Thanks for this recipe!

This pie is outstanding!  I made as written using a homemade pie crust and it turned out wonderful.  The creamy, custardy filling contrasts nicely with the bluberries and the cooking time was right on.  Everyone loved it!

Amazing and easy pie! i added a cup of raspberries and doubled the crumb topping and it turned out great! However, i had to double the cooking time because it wouldn't set, but that was my only obstacle.

So yummy with or without the pecans.  Not all my family loves nuts so I have to make it without sometimes.   Number 1 recipe on my list for this summer.

Very nice. My first fresh blueberry dessert, made at my daughters request. I served it warm with vanilla bean ice cream and homemade whipped cream. Delicious. Increased topping.

I didn't have enough sour cream so we used banilla yogurt for the other half.  It was very sweet but absolutely delicious!

This is a great pie recipe.  I made it for my parents and husband and all loved it!  My husband said this is one of the best pies he has had and he doesn't even like blueberry pies usually. He loved the consistency and that when you sliced into the pie, a whole piece came out and you didn't lose any of the filling.  I did add a bit of cinnamon to the filling and more to the topping.  I just couldn't see the topping without a little cinnamon.  It worked well!  Great recipe!

Nice way to use up a bounty of blueberries.  You can't ask for an easier recipe, especially if you use a refrigerated pie crust.  I baked it as directed and as others stated it didn't test done, but I took it out anyway and it solidified on standing.  I thought it was tasty--my husband loved it!

I don't know, maybe it's me.  I thought it was just okay.  It was easy to assemble but I don't think I'll make it again.

I really liked the blueberries and topping, but the custard part really didn't add anything special for me.  It wasn't bad, it just really wasn't like I expected.
