I have a family with very adventurous taste buds who eat a wide variety of foods, but this got a big thumbs down at the table.

I've been looking for ways to use canned salmon besides patties... This was quick easy and very, VERY good.  A good way to add another fish dish to your menu. Have it in place of regular spaghetti for a swith-up.  Again, it was simply delicious.  Oh yeah, almost forgot... I used half the bacon and none of the cream.  Ate it without the pasta to kick the extra carbs and calories too.

Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum.  I'm always looking for quick can recipes!  I loved this one, I made the salad that it suggested to make with it, and it was an awesome combo.  Next time I make this, I'll serve on Texas toast instead of the pasta.

I made this recipe with high hopes, but it just wasn't for us.  Reread the instructions, but was done correctly.  Think that the acid of the tomatoes didn't mesh well with the salmon.

My husband and I thought this was great!  I used some leftover salmon I had baked instead of the canned.  I also cooked the bacon in the microwave, and didn't use the bacon grease.  I didn't think it was at all watery, but I did cook it down, probably more than 4 minutes.  I might have used a little more red pepper, too, which gave it a nice kick.  When I added the cream, I added enough 1% milk to give it the consistency I wanted.  It's a great use of leftover meat--we thought shrimp or chicken or sausage would be good, too.

Made this for my visiting parents along with the spinach and pear salad as recommended.  They couldn't stop raving about both!  This makes quite a bit of pasta, and it reheats very well.

Too much salmon.  Put a few spoonsfull at a time, to taste.  An entire can is overwhelming.  And I'm from Oregon, where salmon is almost taken for granted.  The lovely sauce was overwhelmed.

The taste is very flavorful but it was too watery.  I would drain the tomatoes well and use only one can.

This was WONDERFUL.  Had to use milk in place of cream and added a bit more parmesan.  We loved it.  Excellent way to make salmon!

An interesting way to prepare canned salmon which I'm not a big fan of.    Only used 1 can of tomatoes, milk instead of heavy cream and added extra garlic.  Flavor was good! Thanks for a quick easy recipe.

I tried this recipe and it was not very good at all. I thought this sounded really good and I read many favorable reviews, but this was really bad. Canned salmon dissolves when put into the sauce and it was more of a fish stew. My family gave me dirty looks when I put this on the table. Ended up throwing it away and ordering a pizza for dinner.
