11.7.17  Followed this recipe to the letter and wouldn't change a thing, it's awesome!  I felt it did need a pretty healthy dose of both salt and pepper, was cooked at 14 minutes, so you may want to watch your time, and I may even add in a bit of shredded carrot next time for a little pop of color.  And don't skip the pine nuts, they're important to this recipe.  Very nice recipe, thanks for sharing.
