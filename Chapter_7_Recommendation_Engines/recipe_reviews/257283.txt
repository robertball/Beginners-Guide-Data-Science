If you like blue cheese, this is delish!  Be sure to use a quality blue cheese dressing.  Would be even better with blue cheese crumbles!  So high in fat, though, that I only ate a spoonful : (

I enjoyed this very much but then again I love anything with blue cheese in it. I didn't measure anything I just threw everything together and added a few blue cheese crumbles. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Good alternative for people who don't like mustard or mayo based salads (an huge issue for my step father).  I initially found the recipe slightly bland for my taste but then added some freshly crumbled blue cheese to the final recipe and found it quite nice.
