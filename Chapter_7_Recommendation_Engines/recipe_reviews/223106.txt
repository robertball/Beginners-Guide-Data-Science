I changed the recipe quite a bit but four stars for the idea of making a chicken rhubarb curry. I added onion and fresh garlic and fried with the chicken pieces. Added curry powder rhubarb and a carrot - simmered it all until the chicken was cooked. Added a bit of splenda brown sugar blend and regular splenda until it was a flavour that we liked - not too much though. Next time I'll add more carrot and any other vegetables that I have on hand. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was amazing! My husband doesn't like curry and he finished his plate and was looking for more. I did decrease the amount of sugar a little. It will definitely become a regular meal in my house.

We were looking for a way to use up an abundance of rhubarb and stumbled across this.  It's a very nice recipe, though a bit sweet for our tastes and we'd like more of a stronger orange flavor. Next time I will reduce the sugar and add in a couple of tablespoons of oj concentrate to adjust for that. We used thighs, our preference, and they turned out beautifully.  Served with rice noodles and an Asian salad and it made for a really lovely meal.

This was surprisingly delicious! I love rhubarb in anything although I normally pair it with sweets. This was a nice change of pace and a recipe I'll likely make again. Only 4 stars instead of 5 because I think 2 cups of sugar would be WAY too much. I used a little less than half what was called for and it was the perfect amount and still quite sweet; I can't imagine what the full amount would taste like. Also 45 minutes is a bit excessive. Rather go by internal temperature using a thermometer since chicken breasts vary so much in size. I used smaller ones (5-6 ounces) and they were done to 165F internal temp after 25 minutes. I also had a thought that next time I might try saving a couple steps and time by blending the rhubarb and orange with the sugar curry and salt but NO water then pouring directly on the chicken and letting it all cook in the oven - hence saving the step of simmering on the stove for 45 minutes.

It takes a while but it was SO good! I only had 1 cup of rhubarb and 1/4 of the marmelade was a perfect amount.

Very good! A bit sweet for me so next time I wil try adding some garlic cloves and perhaps rosemary to kick up the savory. I may have used too mild a curry powder as well. Will make again and play with the flavors a bit to suit myself.

I'd been looking for something to do with rhubarb that wasn't a desert. This was fantastic! It was a big hit with the family. However I do suggest cutting the sugar in half; it's much too sweet.

A little less sugar and I used frozen peach slices instead of orange. I also added a little dried jalape√±o for a pack of punch.

A perfect example of ideas other than adding lots of sugar to rhubarb making high sugar food. The chicken with the rhubarb on top was wonderful. Will definitely make it again.

I followed advice of other reviews and cut back to one-third sugar. I doubled water, added onion, garlic, and blended to make the sauce with the ingredients suggested. I also doubled the curry. Then I put in slow cooker for six hours after browning chicken breast.. The bonus was adding chunked up acorn squash. Wow. What a great flavor this rhubarb curry has! Thanks for the great idea. A great way for me to use up the remaining rhubarb at end of season.

2 cups of sugar was just too much for me to fathom so I halved the sugar and it was not missed at all. Used frozen rhubarb from last summer and an orange that was on its last legs. Excellent flavor in final product after cooking chicken in it!
