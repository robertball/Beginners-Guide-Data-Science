this was okay...i left out the cream because it would have been just too much fat.  The cream of coconut was creamy enough and it turned out fine.

I didn't have any cream/half & half so I used all coconut milk. I also used lowfat because I think the full fat leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth. The drink was super tasty on a hot Texas afternoon!

I did not like this at all.  It was way to strong and did not taste good.

Didn't try this although it sounds like an interesting variety. I'm curious why someone would make a pina colada in the first place if they'll "stick with wine."  I'll try this at some point, but it does sound like it might need some modifications with the half and half. Thanks for the idea!

I think it's the 1/2 and 1/2; although had fun doctoring the pitcher to make it work!

I wasn't a big fan of this. I'm not sure what, but it seemed to be lacking something. I was hoping that it would taste better than the frozen Bacardi mixers but it didn't. I will be using the frozen mixes next time.

We thought this was pretty good. We did agree that it does seem to be missing something...maybe a little sugar or sugar syrup would do the trick? Thanks for sharing. :)
