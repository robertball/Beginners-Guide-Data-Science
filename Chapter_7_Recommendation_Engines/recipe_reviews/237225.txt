I made this recipe last night. I made a few changes because it's what I had at hand. I used all chorizo, which made it a little spicer, added a plobano pepper from my garden, and microwaved a few potatoes and grated them for hash browns. I didn't change anything else. This was an awesome dish. My husband loved it. I will definitely make this again.

I hate to rate this when I really just used it as a base recipe and made my own modifications to it but I would imagine the actual recipe is pretty good. I'm really just reviewing this for my own notes because I'd like to make it again. Microwaved some potatoes and diced them small - mixed those with diced tomatoes, 1 can of diced chilis, can of black beans, Fiesta chicken sausage, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder. Covered that with a cream cheese and yogurt mixture and then topped with cheese. We really liked this but some of the potatoes didn't cook through - either cover it next time or cook the potatoes further in the microwave.

Didn't use chorizo, only ground beef. My biggest question was whether the hash browns were added thawed or frozen? I did frozen and it worked out but perhaps cooked a little longer to accommodate.

I was blown away at how flavorful this dish turned out to be.  I only had chorizo so I used a pound instead of half beef and half chorizo.  The only other change I made was to add a clove of garlic when cooking the onion and chorizo.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Super yummy!! I used just chorizo (about 3/4 lb), and I used 1tsp chili instead of 1 tbsp. I peeled and microwaved about 1.5lbs of potatoes and shreded them (next time I will put the shredded potatoes in cold water, drain and dry in paper towels to avoid browning). We ate it with lettuce and avocado. My husband and I loved it!

Yes, please!!  I didn't have chorizo, so I used a pound of ground beef instead.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  It doesn't look like much once you mix it around on your plate, but I assure you it tastes delicious!  My picky nine year old even likes it.  I used southern style hash browns that are little cubes, and grated a block of cheese (melts better than bagged pre shredded cheese).  The cream cheese added a nice flavor.  SO GOOD.

I made this recipe couple times. Family enjoys it. I used fresh potatoes. Also I used 2 cans diced tomatoes. Also I cooked the casserole longer. Another change I made was I used chorizo and Italian sausage. Another time used chorizo and chicken. I am sure beef would be fine, but we don't eat a lot of beef.
AI also added tablespoon garlic
The casserole has some flavor, but yet not to hot for family.
I gave this 5 stars. Everyone enjoyed the meal and we have a lot of garden potatoes so I am always looking for ways to cook potatoes and mix it up abit.

I baked potatoes 2 days prior and then just sliced them on top of meat. I added 3 color bell peppers and garlic. It looked like Shepard's pie  with scalloped potatoes. My family loved it!

Great flavor but takes more like 45 minutes to make and required a larger baking pan

My family and friends have really enjoyed this recipe.  I actually use 1 lb lean ground beef and maybe a little extra corn for a bigger gathering. Seasoning as listed in the recipe is great!

Made with jalapeno elk sausage, fresh fried potatoes and added a poblano chili to the meat - fantastic. Will make again!
