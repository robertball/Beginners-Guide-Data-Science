A pleasant minty cocktail that’s so refreshing for a hot summer’s day.  I didn’t have lemon-flavored rum, so I substituted lemon seltzer water for the soda water.  I also used extra mint leaves as a personal preference.

I've recently discovered I like mojitos, and this is no exception. I used bottled lime juice and regular white rum, per what I had on hand.  I also prefer Diet 7up to club soda.  CHEERS, Alycia!

Was very good, I used strawberry rum and a little less sugar.

Yummy! Followed the recipe but I didn't have club soda so I used tonic water and squeezed half a lime in each glass with lots of crushed fresh lime from my garden. So so good!

I added a tiny bit more sugar since my lime was extra big. Otherwise I stayed true to the recipe. Very nice flavor on this warm day!

We use dark rum and fresh mint from the garden. Good and strong. Also find that making each glass to order is thee only way. Using a shaker or to attempt a pitcherful...NO!

This was really good, and I don't generally like alcohol! Couldn't find lemon rum so I made it with lemon liqueur and I enjoyed it.

I made this about 5 times amount in a large jug for friends. Was a big hit. Also hits you hard after a few of them.

Yum! I only used sugar to rim my glass as I dont care for sweet drinks.  Used regular white rum as that is what I have on have and a lemon flavored water. Love mint & lime.. This was my first EVER mojito :)

All I had in the house was spiced rum, and this recipe was still great.

Absolutely awesome!  So fresh and delicious!  Reduced the sugar and the alcohol on the 2nd round.  :)))
