We loved this. I used a raspberry flavored tea, as that's what I had on hand. So refreshing. Thanks!

I needed a quick and easy punch recipe for an impromptu baby shower, and this was PERFECT!  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used instant peach tea mix, and I added red grapes in addition to the lemons and oranges.  It was a HUGE hit!  I'll surely make this one again!

It was a huge hit at a family party!  I added strawberries & frozen green grapes and I cut the citrus in wedges, they were so good to eat.  I made three batches (all I had) and that was perfect for 12 people.  I added less fruit to each additional batch as there was some left over each time.

Very delicious! Loved seeing folks go back for more. I used instant raspberry tea mix and Sierra Mist. Serve and keep cold (floating ice adds to the look) for best taste.

I made this for my Easter brunch and it got rave reviews!  I used Peach Tea and sliced up oranges, lemons, kiwi and strawberries.  It looked absolutely beautiful in my pitcher!  We went through 3 batches Easter afternoon.  A few guests added wine to theirs and loved that, too!  I will definitely make this again and again!

We made this recipe at a basic intro. to cooking class. What an easy recipe! It was very tasty! We had some dietary restrictions such as very low caffeine and no sugar. I used what others suggested and went with a raspberry instant tea powder mix (Used Lipton Diet Raspberry Iced Tea Mix). We used Diet Sprite Zero as well. It was delicious! Cheers!

Our division hosted a Cinco de Mayo luncheon for its employees this year. We made this punch to go along with the catered food and it was a HUGE hit. I had many requests for the recipe (I'm sending out the recipe with our next employee newsletter!). The best part is that it is so simple to make! I'll definately be using this punch recipe in the future. Thanks so much!

I used this for a bridal shower and it was awesome...I actually doubled the recipe and it was still barely enough. Everyone loved it. I used a sliced lemon, lime, orange and 2 kiwis. I also took the advice of a couple of other feedbacks and used the peach flavored tea mix. Totally awesome!!! Will use this recipe again.

This was delicious!  I doubled the recipe for a 1 Gal pitcher, used raspberry tea mix and added cut up pineapple in addition to the lemons and oranges and served it at an office fiesta!  Delicious!

This is very good but the way I made it, it was a little to sweet. I used Rasberry ice tea powder and added two pomegranate tea bags also.Let sit for about 4 hours then I removed the pomegranate tea bags. I think I will try Crystal Light next time and see how that tastes.
