Being Polish, and born in Poland, I have had many pierogi's in my day. After many disappointing pierogi meals, I came across this recipe...and all I can say is YUM! My kids (who do not care for dad's food preferences) inhaled these and asked for more. Great recipe -Dziekujemy! All this talk about Pierogi's is making me hungry.

My Grandma made the best Pierogi's ever. She took her secrets w/ her to the grave. I never thought that I would ever taste another Pierogi that could rival my Grandmothers, until this recipe! My family loved them and it was worth the time taken to make them.  I think this will be one recipe that will be my family's "secret"

I have had many pierogi's but none better than these. This recipe ensures that the Peirogi's are moist and definitely is the traditional Polish pierogi!

Tasted amazing! I wanted to post a review to add a few tips for the few people that this recipe did not work for. It would be a shame to set it in the toss pile and never attempt it again.  1) The dough is delicate, I used my kitchen aid dough hook, but when the dough got a bit sticky I added about 1/2 cup of flour 2) When you are rolling out on the counter, be liberal with the flour on the counter and on the dough surface  3) When you cut your rounds, make the dough a little thicker (when you add the filling, you will stretch out the dough a little more) 4) flour your rounds on both sides and stack them on a plate, if you refrigerate your rounds for a few hours they will be easy to work with.  5) Make sure your filling has no juice! If you use the sauerkraut recipe add a bit of mashed potato to pull it together and drain and fry the sauerkraut for a few mins to boil away all of the leftover juice.  6) When making the mashed potatoes it helps to almost over whip them so they start to become a bit "gummy", not too much, but enough so you can make balls out of the mixture 7) If the pierogi "looks" sealed but you didn't fold it over or use a fork to bind it, it will probably come apart in the boiling water.  8) drop the pierogi's 1 at a time into the boiling water so they cook for a few seconds before the next is dropped in, this stops them from sticking together, I found that 2 mins of boiling was sufficient, and I fried them after.  These turned out perfect!!

Gave this 5 stars for the dough.  Used my own filling. This dough was exactly what I was looking for. Let the dough sit for 10 to 15 minutes before rolling. I use my pasta machine to roll out the dough. I use a wide rim glass or mug to cut out pierogi. SOOOOOO GOOD.

Over 2 hours of work and all I ended up eating was my left over mashed potatoes. I followed this recipe to the letter, and the finished product was gooey and tasteless and slimy. At least half of them broke in the water and leaked filling. I would be willing to try this recipe again if there were another cooking method. Can you bake these? Boiling produced such a mess; not sure where I went wrong on this one.

I have been trying to duplicate the ones made by a friends grandmother and these are by far the best!
You have made my husband very happy!
I make a big batch, freeze some on a baking sheet and then bag them up for later use. Boil them from frozen state and perfect!!

These are very good.  When my husband was alive he made a "old counry" version with a mixture of seasoned hamburger, onion, beaten egg mixed will and placed inside the dough.  He boiled them and then we would lightly brown the dough in a greased cast iron skillet after they had cooled from the boiling procedure.  Serve them up with sour cream if desired.  Not low on calories but a delicious version of the Pierogi with

Time consuming but well worth it. I've never made these from scratch before, but found it to be quite easy and the end product was delicious. Just make sure you seal the dough with water and a fork or else you will have a mess when you go to boil them. Finish them off by frying them in a little butter to make them crispy and serve with onions. Thanks for the recipe!

OMG! This is a must have dish when my friends and I go to Poland to buy Polish pottery. We actually were in Poland in 2 weeks ago. We always stop and have Pierogis at least once. This time we actually had the hotel where we stayed at make us some fresh pierogis to take home.  We each brought back a batch that was stuffed with cheese and potatos and another batch was stuffed with pork. Yum-Yum! Family loved them.  This recipe is great! Very easy if you have a pampered chef cut and seal. It does it all in one step. I prefer the small cut and seal for pierogis. Once they are all made I boil them first, then drain very well... then pan fry in a little butter. I cook onions on the side for those who want to add them. However in Poland I have never had them pan fried. My order has never come fried. I do like pan fried pierogis a little better. My favorite stuffing I think is still the potato and cheese. BUT !!!! This one is also very good. Definitely worth trying. The stuffing option is endless....  The thought of pierogis makes me want to plan another shopping trip soon. YIKES! Thanks! for a great recipe

Amazing dough! Just like my Grandma makes.let the dough rest for 30 minutes before rolling out.  Also, pierogi can be made in advance and taste the same.  prepare a pan well with melted butter.  Then, as the pierogi are done boiling, drain and place in your prepared pan. Put extra melted butter on top of the pierogi,  this will prevent any sticking and seal in the flavor.  When placing in pan, it's best to place them neatly in one layer.  A baking sheet will work fine.  Then, freeze them in the baking sheet covered tightly with foil.  Take them out of Freezer and transfer to Fridge to defrost 24 hours in advance.  Then bake 275 degree oven for 30 minutes.  I do this for Easter every year and Christmas.  works every time.

My mom recently passed away and took her pierogi recipe with her. I tried this recipe - and it was hers! She usually used farmer cheese in her potato and cheese recipe. I also experimented with fruit filled pierogi (my mom never made these, my grandmother always did) and I used canned prune filling for some and apple pie filling (fairly well drained)for another batch, and they tasted just like my grandmother made. Then I went one step further, and sauteed the fruit pierogi in unsalted butter and brown sugar, and served them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. WHEW! What a dessert!

I thought the receipe was good but not great. I thought the dough was a bit dry and the filling a bit loose compared to the filling my grandmother, mother and my friend's mother use. My grandmother and mother used Farmer's cheese in the potato filling but I can't get it where I live so I substitute cottage cheese and find that I like the addition of the cheese better than the Potato filling listed. As far as the dough was concerned, I don't use sour cream, I use 1/3 c water for my liquid, 2 eggs, salt, no baking powder and find it makes a good medium-soft dough. I put it in a plastic bag so it won’t dry out, if I'm not going to use it right away, after I've kneeded it. When ready to assemble I divide dough in half. On a floured board (surface) roll out each half to about 1/8” roll and cut in ¾ in pieces and flatten with my hand, insert the potato/cheese filling and crimp it around the edges. My grandmother used to roll out the dough and use a glass to cut circles to ensure a more uniform size.  For the potato mix, I peel and cook 5 potatoes. Mash and add ¼ stick of margarine and ½ large onion that has been sautéed in butter and 4 oz of small curd cottage cheese and cooled in the refrigerator until it is a bit stiff. I am always looking for a bettr one though so enjoy trying all submissions.

The dough is certainly more of a dumpling. The size looks like a normal pierogi until they boil. They are the largest pierogis I've ever seen.   Be sure to stuff enough filling inside, wetting and sealing the edges as you go.  I would add more salt to this recipe, and when you fry them, add some fresh bacon bits. The flavour will set into the dough. Yum!!  Also, since pierogis are always such an undertaking, I would double the recipe. You can freeze some for later.

These were a lot of work!  My only experience with pierogi are the frozen Mrs. T's brand.  Which I've always loved.  The tasty dough from this recipe was my husband's favorite part!  I had a bit of trouble rolling out the dough, it kept sticking regardless of adding more and more flour to the table during rolling.  I'm sure this is more a user error thing, I've never been good at rolling out dough.  I used the Traditional Mashed Potato recipe from this site and just added the sauteed onions to it.  Rolling the dough and closing each dumpling was harder than I expected.  I wasn't able to roll it thin enough, it kept sticking.   I almost threw the batch away instead of pan frying them (and wasting more time and butter).  I'm glad I didn't.  The dough was surprisingly delicious and the filling was a perfect compliment.  The next time, I will try to roll the dough between floured wax paper.

This recipe is great. I did add some cheddar cheese to the potato filling because that is how I've been taught to make it. I was happy with the way everything turned out. If you have never made pierogi before, know this: 
The recipe doesn't mention that you need to add lots of flour as you knead the dough and as you pinch the pierogi together. I mean add a lottt. Otherwise the dough will be difficult to work with. As most reviewers said, to be fully appreciated pierogi are best pan fried, and served with some carmelized onions on the side. So, once you are done boiling them as directed heat some butter in a pan and brown them on both sides.

these we great! but....... skip on the baking powder. My mom used to work in Polish resturant in Santa Monica. The dough (as I recall it) did not puff up as these did. The taste we so great. I had to make them for my husband he had never had these tasty little things. He loved them! I will most def make them again. But find a different dough method.

I've seen other recipes like this one, and they only called for 1 egg and 1/4 c of sour cream, but I figured "how can 165 people be wrong" so I gave it a go...

I don't know how the other 165 people managed to make pierogies out of this, but after following the recipe to a tee, I was left with a goopy mess. 

I started adding 1 tbsp of flour at a time, until, 2 extra cups of flour later, I gave up. I *still* wasn't able to get it smooth enough to roll out. I'm now scraping the gooey remains off my countertop and looking for a recipe with less liquid.

So easy! I used my kitchenaid for the dough and instant mashed for the filling so the only time consuming part was filling the dough. I'm going to experiment with different fillings like bacon and cheese, mushroom, maybe even raspberry ricotta or something for dessert.

I tried this recipe and it was very sticky, the dough was tough to work with but adding extra flour in the rolling/resting process helped. Once cooked, I noticed the dough had more of a bite (tougher). I will NOT use this recipe again.  I also made a different batch (different recipe) of dough that does not use sour cream and calls for only one egg which came out much better and was easier to work with. Once cooked, this dough was smoother and perfect. Direct from my Polish niece.

Pierogi were always a snack prepared for us by my Lithuanian great-grandmother when I was a child.  My mother gave me a recipe from her head when I had a hankering to make them last year.  I felt like making them again today but could not find her recipe for the dough...  The dough in the recipe posted here was perfect.  My family's dough used egg, flour, and milk; I found the sour cream to add some more elasticity.  They turned out great!
I did however use my own potato filling recipe; not sure if it's a Lithuanian thing or just my family, but we do a cheese and potato filling.  I drain cottage cheese in cheesecloth (or a nylon stocking) until there is no liquid left in it, then form the filling with equal parts mashed potato and the cheese (and of course the onions.)
My favorite way to eat these is fried in butter until crispy and golden brown on outside.  I'm yet to try this, but my mother said that my great-grandmother used to also serve the pierogi with a simple sauce made of heavy cream and sliced bacon.  
Thank you!

This was SUCH a nice dough to work with!  And tasted great too!  Do yourself a favor and get a buddy (or 4) and make a ton of perogies and freeze them!  I made 3 double batches & got 300+.  We're loving them!  Be sure to brown them after you boil them.

I really like this recipe.  Though I do have a tip for some people.  Don't cook the perogies right away.  Seal them up and then freeze them for two days.  It lets them bind and are less likely to open up when cooking.

My grandmother always used to make these for special occasions. We always fry in a little bacon grease after boiling, and serve with crispy bacon. oh, so good! I added cheddar cheese and garlic in the mashed potatoes. For those whose leaked into the water, the dough needs to be the right consistancy. When sealing, wet just the inside edges that you are pressing together to make it stick. if more of the dough than that gets wet, it may get too stretchy and break open. I had a hard time with the sauerkraut filling till I mixed a little mashed potatoes with it b/f stuffing. Then all was well.

Made these over the holidays. The dough was very easy to work with. The only thing I changed was instead of the sauerkraut filling, I used a sweet potato, apple and bacon filling. Talk about delicious!!

This review is based on the dough only. I found it to be almost perfect, however i had to add quite a bit more flour to the dough when i was kneeding it to make sure it was not sticking to my hands or to the floured counter.  Also, I would suggest rolling it out a little thicker than 1/8 inch, and probabilly use a larger circle cut out to make filling easier and fit more in. other then that it was exactally what i was looking for, i have tried other doughs before and they always turn out more like a pasta. this was awesome, with my mashed potato stuffing (herb and garlic cream cheese, sour cream, copped bacon, butter, a little milk, shredded cheese and pepper ) they turned out perfect with a 4 minute boiling time and then i fried them in a pan to brown and crisp up eaach side. I will definatley be making this again.

I only used the dough portion from this recipe.  Been making these for many years and have many, many recipes from famliy from Poland and all over.  This dough was so easy to work with, not sticky. Rolled out, cooked and froze well.  Just remember to roll the dough to your preferred thickness. It expands when you cook them - like pasta. Also pop it in the fridge to let it chill and stiffen up a bit.  I've made it the day before.  I'm still using the traditional farmer cheese/potato filling. A trick I have found to make a "fluffier" middle is to DRAIN the potatos well then put them thr. a ricer. Then mix minimially.   I will be using this recipe next time! Cheers!

I am only rating the dough because I made my own sauerkraut filling.  This recipe is pretty good but nothing spectacular.  Although I don't know what more I should be expecting because all pierogi dough seems to be bland and masked by the taste of the filling. 

I agree with the other reviewers.... the dough is very sticky and there is no way you can knead it without adding more flour.  I probably added 1-1/2 cups of additional flour as well as more for rolling out.  Once I did this, it actually came together very well and was very easy to roll out.  I used a 3.5" glass to cut out circles and it yielded way more than the 12 pierogis the recipe states.  I got about 36 good size pierogis. 

I'll probably keep trying different recipes to see if there are any better ones.

great, easy dough.  After boiling the pierogies, we put them all on a plate, and they stuck together in one big mass.  Tasted great, but looked horrible.  Fried it up in one big mass and cut it like a pie.  Need to keep them separate as they cool after boiling.

My first time making pierogi from scratch!  I remember eating these when I was a kid.  Made them for my family and they loved them!  I think I rolled the dough a little thick-- I will fix that next time.  Otherwise they were great!  Instead of a Sauerkraut filling (my family doesn't like) I made a potato and cabbage combo-  Delish!!

The dough tasted like I remember my Polish grandmother used to make, however the potato stuffing wasn't quite the way I remembered it though it was quite good.  My daughter even said they tasted better than the store bought ones.  Very time consuming.  My grandmother used to make large ones, so after rolling out and cutting several 3 inch circles I decided to pull individual balls of dough and roll them out separately...this worked great.  All in all it's a good recipe...it just needs some tweaking based on individual tastes.

The recipe printed in columns and I missed that there are two different fillings.  I made one big batch of combined filling (wondered for a moment at the onions on there twice...  evidently not long enough).  It was fantastic!  The combination of potato AND sauerkraut turned out so tasty!  The dough was wonderful to work with (I ran it through my Kitchenaid pasta roller) and had a perfect texture.  This recipe is going in my permanent file!

You need to add flour until the dough no longer sticks to your fingers.

Do NOT roll to 1/8" thick, the finished Pierogis will be 1/4" thick!!  Roll as thin as possible.

Only used the dough and did our own thing for the filling, but the dough was great. Excellent texture, easy to roll out nice and thin, and then perfect and delicate when eating. Way better than that mooshy potato dough of commercial perogies

I found this to be a very good base recipe for pierogi - I especially like the sour cream in the dough.  I had previously used my pasta recipe that I use for ravioli but this one seems more tender.  One note - I had to add an extra cup or so of flour to get this dough through my pasta roller.  I used the potato filling with the following changes: I used 2 shallots instead of onion and added 1c of shredded cheddar cheese.  It was an accomplishment not to eat this straight out of the bowl.  Things I do differently with the assembly: I use a small cookie scoop to scoop the filling, then shape it with my fingers.  I wet the edge of the dough with my finger, then press to seal.  Once I've done this with a batch (about 12), I crimp all the edges with a fork then put in salted boiling water.  Once they're all in, I stir once, boil for 1min, remove with a spider skimmer and place on a plate.  Once they cool a little, I brush with butter and place in a tupperware to freeze or cook immediately.  When I'm ready to eat them, I run it in the microwave to melt the butter and then pull out the ones I want.  I then pan fry til golden brown.  If I've just made them, I just pan fry.  Thanks for the recipe!

My beau asked me to add a little grated sharp cheddar cheese to the potato filling mixture and it was delicious. Worth the effort if you are in the mood to make some from scratch - great project for some together time and it yields a scruptious meal.

Awesome recipe! These turned out totally delicious!! We ended up with too much filling though. So we only did the potato filling, and served the sauerkraut on the side.    Instead of boil cooking we boiled each for about two minutes (until the floated) then froze half of them, and pan fried the rest in a little bit of butter.

I followed this recipe and cant understand what went wrong. The potato mixture needed cheese or something. It was really bland. Then the dough was really sticky. I had to use a ton of flour to keep it manageable.  Maybe I will try this again lots of work for it not to come out right.

I used this recipe for the dough only, I filled mine with mashed potatoes mixed with butter, milk, cottage cheese, cheddar cheese and salt.   After boiling I pan fried them and served with fried onions and sour cream. This made an enormous batch and I have enough left over to freeze for at least 2 other meals for my family of 5.  The only problem I had was that after I boiled them, I put them into a bowl until I could fry them and they really stuck together. I won't make that mistake again the next time - and there will be a next time. When I make them again I will be sure to lay them out flat on a cookie sheet while waiting to fry in butter.  Amazing recipe. Absolutely delicious.

This was a great recipe. A couple of things--i did find that more flour was needed, and this made more like 50 pierogi rather than 12.

I finally found the recipe for pierogi dough, and this is it!!!  I used blueberries for filling, and they turned out fantastic.  I froze most of the pierogi as sugggested by previous reviews.  I will definitely make these again, and I'm sending the recipe to my mom.

I made this recipe for a Superbowl party.  Being the only Steelers fan I felt the need to bring something Pittsburgh-style.  I made them ahead of time, sauteed in butter/onions, and poured it all into a crock pot with a little extra butter.  The were pretty much gone by the end of the first quarter.  Nothing but compliments!

Tried this recipe last night. Everyone loved it. The only thing I changed was that I added chopped crispy bacon to the potato filling. Why? Because everything is better with bacon ;). I'll definitely be making these again.

Loved this recipe! This is delicious and would be great with so many different variations of fillings. I used the potato filling with a Mushroom Goulash. Awesome.  The only thing that I am not a fan of is how long this recipe takes.  The prep time is much longer with the making of the dough, cutting, filling, wetting, folding, crimping. I know this is just the way it is with this kind of recipe! But...it does make a delicious dish!

These were exactly how our Polish friends make them. Soooo good, and a lot easier for a first-timer than I thought.

Awesome! After boiling I pan fry in butter and onions then dollop sour cream on top (it melts in and creates a "sauce"). They freeze well too (before boiling laid out on a cookie sheet then tossed in a freezer bag. ( I use suarkraut/suarkraut potato mix  filling add cheese sometimes... whatever leftovers I have but always with some saurkraut for a sour note) when I don't feel like making too many (lazy) I make HUGE ones using a small bowl as a "cookie cutter" and it works too very versatile recipe.

I was disappointed with this recipe and surprised by all of its 4- and 5-star reviews.  First, the dough was extremely sticky. Although I am skeptical of recipe testers who alter recipes then review them, I absolutely had to add more flour than the recipe called for in order for the dough to be workable. I ended up adding a whole extra cup of flour and still needed more to flour my surface and rolling pin. (The humidity level here is 59% today in the VI where I work with windows open, that may have had an effect?).  I made both the dough and the potato mixture in advance and let them refrigerate for a few hours before rolling the dough and assembling.  After boiling my first batch for about five minutes, the edges were still uncooked. I do not agree with the recipe's suggestion to roll the dough to 1/2"-1/8". A half inch is WAY too thick. I would suggest rolling to 1/8" or less so that the dumpling cooks evenly. I did taste at this point and the pierogi did taste good (except for the edge), but for more flavor, I decided to saute them in a bit of butter with sliced onions.  The fillings were very good. Next time I will try a different dough recipe and make it in the bread machine, then make sure to roll the dough thinner.

I am giving it 4 stars because my daughter and husband loved these. I didn't care for them (2 stars). They are time consuming to make, but not difficult.  The only suggestion I would make is to cut down on the salt in the potato filling. I get the idea that if you like Pierogi, you will love this recipe. I guess I don't, but my family really did love this.

The dough recipe for these pierogi's is my go to recipe. I make them every new years as a tradition and my family and friends love them; especially my Polish boyfriend. It is very time consuming but completely worth it. Be ready to commit a whole day to preparing them. After boiling I saute them in a pan with butter and sweet yellow onion. Try topping them with sour cream alone or mixed with horseradish. YUMMY!

Results were delicious, but the time needed to make this was way off, or I did something drastically wrong. It took me more than 3 hours to complete this recipe.  Recipe yielded 45 chinese-dumpling sized pierogi dumplings.   Here is my approximate time breakdown: 30 minutes for the mashed potato filling (including boiling the water and cooking the potatoes), 5-6 minutes for the sauerkraut filling, 2 hrs for the dough, 30 minutes for rolling, cutting and assembly, and finally, 15-20 minutes for boiling.  Suggestions - make when you have left over mashed potatoes on hand, and modify the dough recipe. Use either 1/4-1/2c more flour, or only 2 eggs. Dough was way too wet and took forever (almost 2 hours) to knead into a stretchy dough-like texture.

At first I wondered why some members said this was a time consuming recipe, but by the time I was finished I understood what they were talking about!  But so much worth the effort!!  When I first boiled the pierogi before I fried them in butter I wasn't too impressed with the dough texture (like overcooked/mushy pasta) but after I fried them they were wonderful!  Even better when I fried ones that I had rubbed with butter and froze first.  I can never go back to the frozen store bought brand again!!  I used a potato, cheddar cheese and vidalia onion filling, and made additional ones with strawberries and fresh peaches that I sauted in butter and added a little corn starch and water to thicken the filling.  I served these with whipped cream on top and couldn't believe that my picky nieces loved them.  Tasted very much like crepes but with a thicker dough.

I thought these were very easy to make...although very time consuming. I followed the recipe exactly but found it to be a little bit bland. I would rather save the time and buy the frozen ones. I am not sure what this recipe needs but the I think that the dough needs more flavor.

These were pretty good. My only criticizim would be that the dough was a little too bread-like. I made the potato filling and added a bit of minced garlic and some cheddar cheese. I enjoyed them overall and will probably try to play with the dough recipe to get a better consistancy.

These came out wonderful! Used quite a bit more flour when kneading. Also I only had bread flour available which worked perfect. Had no sour cream so I used Greek yogurt. Had quite a bit of filling left over, I wanted my husband to try because he never eats pierogi so I added a little bacon and cheese with the potato. He really liked them.

This was my first time making or eating Pierogis and I was hesitant because I'm not a huge fan of sour cream but these were delicious. I ended up making them a bit large and they were a bit filling.

Pierogies are one of my very favorite foods. A year ago I could not have anything dairy so I decided to make my own version of these. I changed to butter to vegan margarine and used a dairy free sour cream (tofu product)instead of real sour cream. You could not tell it was not real dairy and they were delish! Very easy recipe to follow and the dough is very soft. Will be making these again and again. They are also the preferred choice of filling for my previous cheese loving children.

This was the most labor intensive food item I've ever attempted to make and it was also an epic failure. I followed the directions for making the dough to the letter. It was the stickiest dough I have ever made. At that point I should have realized that I needed to use at least twice as much flour as the recipe called for, but instead of trusting my insticts on this I wrapped up this mass of stickyness in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge overnight. The next day I took it out to make the dumplings. I couldn't even get it off of the plastic wrap. It was stickier than taffy. At this point I did add more flour, but there was no saving it. I rolled it out and cut some rounds. Most of the rounds were still too sticky to pry up from the rest of the dough. I ended up making 10 extremely gooey horrible looking dumplings. I didn't even attempt to boil them. Most of them had huge gaping holes due to the evilness of this dough. I decided to treat them like potstickers and attempted to pan fry and then steam them. I ended up with one raw dough side and one burnt side. They went in the trash and I just ate the fillings instead.

Love these.  They remind me of holidays with my Polish relatives and I've started my own tradition by making them for Easter the last two years.  Both fillings are delicious.  We boil and then fry them for some extra yummy flavor and crunch.  I used a pint-sized drinking class to cut out the dough - it was just about 3" across.

Thank you, this is a great recipe.  It brings back good memories.  The only 2 things I did differently were to use a whole milk organic plain yogurt in place of sour cream, and at the end I let them drip dry on a baking rack followed by a shallow pan fry in a cast iron pan to golden brown.  When I boiled them, I did not let it boil too vigorously.  I think a chunk of feta in the center of the potato filling would be a nice addition.  I served them with freshly cracked black pepper, a dollop of the yogurt, and a warm lemon butter sauce.  I am also curious to try a smaller version with an apricot filling and vanilla gelato on the side.

This is more a 3.5, but didn't want to give it the lower 3 stars.  THis was my first attempt at making pierogies.. the only difficulty I had was rolling out the dough.  As for the filling, I like sauerkraut, but I did not like this filling at all.  I ended up tossing it out and using the potato filling.  And there was plenty of filling left.  I used a piroshky/dumpling crimper to seal.  Will make this again.

This recipe has a perfect dough and a good potato filling. I made my own fillings with different fruits for desert pierogi and a different potato recipe, but the fillings here look good too. My only suggestion is that you flip over the pierogi as they cook in the water, it lets the dough become tougher and seal to itself better. Some reviewers complained that their pierogi leaked or popped open, and having a good seal with proper boiling treatment will help to keep them from breaking open. 

Like many reviewers, I also pan fry mine for a few moments to brown them after they boil. I will try deep frying them to see how the dough reacts (like many Philadelphia pierogi are made).

Too much pepper and the potatoes should be whipped, mashed isn't the right texture.  Allow 3 hours!  :)

Rating for dough: Great recipe, dough turned out well, nice and tender. I used a different filling, so can't rate.

Btw, they turn out surprisingly well when baked too, slightly bready--though fill well seasoned/sauced meat may be best if you bake them.

I filled these with the usual cheese/potato filling. So yummy! Theres only 2 of us, but I went ahead and made the full 12 servings and instead of cooking all of them I froze them. Worked wonderfully! I'm definetly going to bring them to my grandparents to try. :)

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe to a T. I was looking for a slippery, pasta-y texture... basically, a homemade version of Mrs. T's pierogies (I have zero Polish/Ukrainian heritage). These came out with a more biscuity, buttery, fluffy/flaky texture for some reason. The taste wasn't bad, and it was very easy to work with, but it was just the complete opposite of what I wanted.

First time to ever make pierogi.  These were a little time consuming but very good and would follow the recipe again-hopefully to get quicker at making them.  I find these better than any from the church sales we usually get them from.

My review is only for the dough, since I used a different filling for the pierogies.  The dough was much too sticky, and I needed almost another cup of flour before it was of a consistency that could be handled.   After boiling the pierogies, I browned them in butter and olive oil, which gave them a nice crispy texture where they touched the pan, but kept a softer texture on the rest of them.  I topped the pierogies with some onion sauteed in butter, and a little crumbled crisp bacon.  They were delicious!

These were good. The dough cooked up to be puffy and I found the dough stuck together, no problems with them falling apart. I also fried them a bit to give them a crispy outside. The flavour was bland, so I might follow some suggestions of stuff to add to filling. The only problem I had was I think I over kneaded the dough and it became too hard to roll out and so I wasted about half the dough; however, I still got 16 pieces.

These are amazing!  I did not use the sauerkraut as hubby is the only one who likes it.  Instead I sauteed bacon and minced onions to add to the potatoes.  Best pierogi's that I have ever had.  I will never buy frozen ones from the store again.  So simple to make.  I put wax paper on a cookie sheet and froze the ones that I did not cook.  Then I put them into freezer bags so they did not lose their shape.  Boiled the frozen ones for 5 minutes then did a quick pan fry.  I will be making these every time I have left over mashed potatoes to stick in the freezer.  Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!

These were very time consuming to prepare, but worth it in the end!  I used pre-made Bob Evans refrigerated potatoes and added some cheddar cheese and finely diced sauted onion.  These are great just boiled ("healthy" version), and even better fried in a little butter and onion.  I served with sour cream and salsa on the side.

I have made it with both fillings and they are great. The sauerkraut filling takes less time than the potato filling. I make them and freeze them in on a baking sheet, then pop them off and put them in a labeled freezer bag to take out and cook later. They do fantastic in the freezer.

This dough is the best!  It's so tender.  I find I have to add more flour because it's too sticky.  I cheat and make mine in a bread machine on the dough cycle.

These were okay but nothing like the ones I would buy from the Polish women at the Church. The filling was good but the dough was too fluffy and bread like. The ones I used to eat were more like a thick pasta. I don't know much about making any kind of dough but if anyone can recommend a way to make it more pasta like, I'd appreciate it :-)

These are awesome. The first time I made them they turned out really well. The second time I created a gooey mess and wasn't sure what I did wrong. The third time they were great again and I realized - make sure the filling cools down to room temp (or colder) before putting it in the dough. Hot filling made the dough wet, gooey and messy. I also found that I needed to liberally flour the rolling pin and the surface I was rolling it out on. Thanks for the recipe!!

I had not tried a pierogi before, so I am not sure what I expected, but for the time I invested, I expected a lot more. I found the dough tough and the fillings rather bland. Disappointing for me, but husband and kids did enjoy.

This recipe is by far the best one I have tried for Pierogi.  A couple of helpful tips as working with the dough can be a challenge. I use the recipe measurements exactly and then let the dough sit for about 20 minutes. After that if it is still very wet and sticky I will add a little more flour and knead it in to make it to where its still sticky but not clinging to everything. Roll it out thick and cut circles using a pint glass and then roll those circles out a little more (Don't make them too thin!) After adding the filling you absolutely need to wet the inside edge of the dough all the way around, this will help seal them. After wetting the dough fold them over and press down on BOTH sides with the tines of a fork. 

Hope this helps!!!

Five stars for the dough although I used my Polish Grandmother's traditional filling recipes for potato and cheese, cabbage and prune which are quite different than this one. The dough is awesome and very easy to work with!

Great!  Easy to follow and turned out as expected.  I recently retired and am trying things I never had time for, like making pierogi.  I've had them all my life but depended on Polish aunties and restaurants as my mother was from the South and she did not venture into Polish cuisine.  I was concerned with the comments about "gooey messes" but tried this recipe anyway.  Since mine came off without a hitch, my guess is they put in too much sour cream which I almost did.  I had a 16 oz container of sour cream and almost put the whole of that in (the recipe calls for "1 (8 ounce) container sour cream") but I've learned to read and reread instructions because of my dyslexia.

After frying them up, try drizzling honey over top, sprinkle some salt and dip in sour cream (that is the potato filled ones, not the kraut ones) Its the best way to eat these wonderful little dumplings, in my opinion!! Great recipe! Thanks!

I love the pierogi dough recipe.  This now replaces my dough recipe that I have made for years.  It is abit wet at the start but once you roll it out with flour it handles beautifully.  I fried some bacon (5 pieces with the onions when I made the sauerkraut perogies.  I also added sharp cheddar (4 oz) and 1/4 cup sour cream to the potato filling.  All in all an excellent recipe.

Really good.  I made the dough whole wheat and would like to figure out a way to make it taste a little more savory, as whole wheat made for a thicker "crust."  All in all, we all enjoyed these.  I added cheese to the potato filling (I like plain, but in a family of cheese-aholics, I knew that'd be the way to go).  Toasted them in a little butter after boiling, and served with sautéed apple/chicken sausage and bell peppers.  Yum!

Very good... a little time consuming to make... My dad also commented on how peppery the potato ones were... next time I might cut back a bit on that.... over all everyone seemed to like the sauerkraut Pierogis... over all not a bad recipe if you have the time to make them.... since it did make more than one meals worth I froze the extras for a quick meal in the future... I would also like to try pan frying them in some butter and onions after they are boiled.... but great recipe thanks for submitting...

What a bust.  The dough was super sticky based on the recipe's recommendations.  Then added more flour and more flour until it was finally manageable.  However, when I boiled the perogies the dough was tough.  Definitely not what I expected.  Apparently eggs make the dough hard.  I recall my mother-in-law saying she used milk instead of sour cream but unfortunately she took the recipe with her to the grave.  Will need to keep searching.

This is a great recipe. After boiling, we fried them in butter and added chopped onions and garlic - was great. We kept the lid on when we were frying them so they also got steamed, which worked well. The only think I would do differently, which was my own fault, is to make homemade sour cream mashed potatoes from scratch. I used the boxed mashed potatoes to save time, which was not bad, but when you are putting this much work into something you should just go ahead and make everything from scratch!

I ended up adding a good bit more flour to be able to roll this dough out. It was sticky. Once I got it the way I wanted it, they did turn out good but huge. I think next time I will skip the baking powder as the other recipes I know to be good don't have it.

I had a hard time with the dough and ended up adding an extra cup of flour so I could roll it with out it sticking to everything. At first I thought I might have made a mistake when measuring the flour but I made a second batch to us up all my leftover mashed potatoes and had to add a lot of flour to that batch too... That being said the pierogis came out great!!

Love this dough! It's easy & rolls beautifully. I just made 3 batches in a row and not one problem. The other dough recipe I used to use was very unpredictable.

Between making the fillings, letting the mashed potatoes cool, making the dough, and letting it rest in the fridge and plus this was my first time making them, it took me about three hours. They were good, especially the potato one, but I think it takes too long. (:

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

These were delish! Haven't had homemade pierogi since my Dzia-dzia passed several years ago and although I didn't have him standing next to me during the prep, they turened out fantastic!

This recipe gives me a new appreciation for Polish grandmas.  I'm not Polish but I LOVE pierogies and I wanted to try to make them myself.  I give this recipe 5 stars because it is an excellent recipes but pierogies are way too time consuming for me, so I will see if my boyfriend's grandma will make this recipe for me the next time. lol

I've always avoided making homemade pierogi because I was afraid to work with the dough.  These rolled out very nicely!  I made a potato, cheddar & onion filling.  Delicious.  Thank you!

I thought these were okay.  The dough was very sticky, a little to hard to work with so I had to add a lot more flour to be able to handle it.  The final taste was pretty bland.  We don't like sourkraut so I just used the potato.  The kids had a ton of fun making these but wouldn't eat them.  If I make again, I will add something a little more flavorful.

It came out fantastic, but I changed just a few things. Since I was born and raised in Poland, and saw how the Sauerkraut filling was made, I tried to reproduce that original flavor. You NEED to cook the sauerkraut in water (just enough water to cover it )for at least 1/2 hour before doing anything else!!! Otherwise it would be too hard. I also added dried mushrooms to the sauerkraut while boiling it. I 1st soaked them in water overnight, and then boiled them (50 dried mushrroms/ soak in 2 cups of water & boil them in the same water). 
After boiling the Pierogis, you can fry them with Onion until golden brown. Yum!

This recipe was spot on for the dough. Once cooked, it had the perfect texture for pierogies. The potato filling was okay for me, I think I would have preferred a different potato mixture. It is important to roll out your dough very thin, or the pierogies won't cook properly (this happened to a few of mine). I had these both fresh and frozen, and were delicious on both occasions.

I have been looking for a successful pierogi recipe for ages - and this it!  it's very forgiving too, so if you add too much of the wet, a little more flour will make it perfect. I used my favorite filling - potatoes boiled with onion and mashed with a touch of milk and butter with sharp cheddar.   Few things: 1. Be sure to cool the filling well or it'll melt the dough and I don't care for boiled pierogi - so I boil then immediately saute it in butter.  2. They freeze wonderfully too - just boil and drain, then lay out on a tray to freeze.  Once frozen - store in Ziploc!!

I tried making these yesterday but used my own fillings.The dough worked perfectly.They were so good.If I have a complaint it would be that we almost ate them all in one sitting.I saw a kind of negative review.You can eat pierogies just blanched like that.They're going to be kind of gooey like that.To me they're not done at that point.My grandmother always sauteed hers in butter until they were nice and golden brown on the outside.

Yummy....sooo much better than store bought...but definately more time consuming. I made the dough as is, probably added 3Tbsp of flour while kneeding, which took maybe 20 minutes. Didn't make the sauerkraut cause hubby was having tummy problems and that irratates it (tmi, i know). As far as the potato filling, I used a bag of instant mashed potatoes (four cheese), added some cheddar/jack cheese, sauteed onions, some garlic, and a little bit of cooked bacon. Made approx 33 dumplings, froze on a wax paper lined cookie sheet for about 1hr. Boiled half in salted water for about 5 minutes (put away other half for later date), then of course you MUST saute with butter an onions. Top with sour cream...yum, Yum, YUMMY!

My daughter said these were the second best pierogi she ever had...the first were made by a friend's grandmother who was visiting from Poland, so I'll take second best.  The dough was hard to work with though...I think I had kneaded in an additional cup of flour, at least, before it was un-sticky enough to roll out.  Could the recipe have been for a different flour than typical American all-purpose?  I did use "light" sour cream, maybe that affected the dough's consistency.  At any rate, instead of using the sauerkraut filling I used a second pototo mixture with shredded white cheddar and carmelized onions...very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe...I didn't have a pierogi recipe in ANY of my cookbooks!

These were awesome. It makes a whole lot more than 12 as the recipe suggest. Cheap and easy to make, but a little time consuming. I added sausage(sliced and chopped very small) and they tasted just like this meal I make for myself. My hubby says he doesn't like saurkraut because its cabbage but I'm gonna trick him into trying one and see if he likes it =) Thanks for such a great recipe

These are fabulous--lots of work but well worth it. Reminds me of the pierogis my elderly Polish neighbor used to bring to us---YUMMY.  Lots of work--take others' advice and make the filings the night before.

My husband devoured this.  Big hit.  I used the sourcraut as a topping, rather than a filling since I had no extra sour cream.  Wish I would have added bacon.  I boiled them for 3 minutes and then fried them in butter.  Yum.

not bad! I only made the potato filling, but that was enough to ensure i'll make this recipe again. Be careful when you add white pepper, as even a little is quite strong!

You couldn't have done a better job than my great grandmother, who was Polish, and we grew up on these with other verieties of cheese, sometimes mixed with potatoes and you are the first I've found to make them as good. On a scale of 1-10, I rate it 100!!!

For the people that gave this bad reviews...shame on you! You work enough flour into the dough and knead! When you can roll it out and its not "sticky" It is ready. Don't overwork either. If it is not staying sealed for you....use egg wash instead...google it!  
Experienced with pierogi dough.

The dough recipe is excellent!! For best results knead the dough with a dough hook for 5 minutes.
 If you like cheese  in with the potato filling use Cooper Sharp. I buy a chunk and grate it with a box grater. The Cooper Sharp really makes them outstanding

I'm in the process of making these and having a terrible time with the dough being too sticky.  I've even added another cup of flour & frozen half the dough.  The fillings, however, are so yummy that I'm forging ahead (using Chef John's Perfect Mashed potatoes from Allrecipes for the potatoes w/the addition of onions with this recipe).  I will take another reviewers tip next time and use wonton wrappers.

Wow, I remember my Polish nana making pierogis in her little kitchen.  It would take hours!!  For that reason, I never attempted to make them myself, and I never got her recipe. Now she's gone and I thought I'd never have her potato-cabbage pierogis again.  This recipe is very accessible and is very close to her dish.  I make these every few months to remind my children to be proud of their Polish heritage.

I used this recipe for the dough only and followed directions exactly.  I was very pleased with dough texture while making dough, rolling it out, and stuffing pierogis (individually, by hand).  Very tender and easy to work with.  Upon boiling, many pierogis took on water, which was disappointing to say the least and the first time I've had this particular problem.  Next time I will try a press and see if I get better results, as the cooked dough was excellent, and exactly what I was looking for taste and texture wise.

This recipe looked really good but the dough was very sticky. (I had to add lots & lots of flour) And the potato filling (only one I made) needed more seasoning. Everything tasted fine but, I really wanted some Pierogi's that were FABULOUS. I'll keep searching.

I served these to my husband and his friends and they LOVED them!

Both fillings were a huge hit and I think next time I'll try some of my own fillings, such as cheddar or maybe cottage cheese. 

The only thing I didn't like was that they at least doubled in size after boiling, which made them HUGE. I think maybe I didn't stretch the dough enough... Not sure.

I didn't actually find them as time consuming, compared to what I was expecting. But they took a good hour to make and cook (after pre-making the filling).

This time I doubled, next time I will at least quadruple the recipe because we have a stand up freezer and can do stuff like that :D

Enjoy everyone!

Update: I figured out my problem with my dough, it seemed to be sometimes perfect, sometimes way to stretchy or "glutinized". I let my dough rest for 30 minutes before handling it. This helped calm the gluten.

Very easy and slightly time consuming however worth the time.My first few peirogi were inconsistently thick. After thinking for a second I realize the similarity of the dough to a pasta dough so I whipped out the pasta roller. Simply brilliant! rolled the dough to a 4 setting then cut it. EASY and consistent. I also just sauteed some diced cabbage and carrots for our filling as the sauerkraut is not accepted in my house. The sauteing after boiling adds the perfect texture. We make more after use the frozen left overs.

The best recipe ever. I`m Polish and had pierogi million times in my life and this is by far the best dough recipe. I made my own stuffing of sauerkraut and dried shiitake mushrooms (I couldn`t find dried porcini mushrooms which my mom used to use). I`ll definitely make them again. Thank you :-)

I made this recipe tonight and it was very enjoyable but very time consuming as the recipe states.  A few things threw me as a new pierogi maker.  First, the dough is very, very sticky.  I added extra flour to it to try to get it to be more like a bread dough which I think was the WRONG thing to do.  The trick is to work on a well floured surface and keep flouring as you go.  I found that since my dough was already sticky, I didn't need to water the edges when I pressed them with a fork (actually I used a pampered chef tool that came with my roller which worked better than the fork I started with).  I agree that these were rather larger than what I was expecting but they were still very good.  Also, my pierogi's started floating as soon as I put them in the boiling water (30 seconds or less) so I just boiled for 5 minutes, seemed to come out okay.  Now that I've done it once, I think I would do better a second time and it would go faster.

I am only rating this for the dough and cooking instructions.  I didn't even read the ingredients from the filling recipes, because I read the Potato, Cheese & Onion Filling recipe on this page:  pittsburgh.about.com/od/recipes/r/pierogies.htm.  I'm from Pittsburgh, and this sounded like how I remember mom making them when I was a kid.  

These are better!  Wow.  

A real trip down memory lane, and fantastic.  Chewy, crisp, buttery dough.  Perfect.  The filling I used is 5 medium white potatoes, diced and boiled, mixed with a large onion roughly diced and  lightly sauteed with a little less than 1/2 stick of butter.  Mix in about 1/2 pound of cheddar (or other) shredded cheese.  Easier to work with if you let it chill for an hour or so.  Not a problem if you make the filling first, since you'll take at least an hour to get to where the dough's ready to be filled anyway.  

Be generous when you wet the rim of the open pierogi before closing it.  If your dough is dry (or too floured from rolling or crancking through a pasta machine) a little extra water will turn this extra flour into glue.  Really.  Without it, the flour will keep the thing from staying shut.  Get them damp enough to remain shiny for a minute or so and you'll never have one pop open when you boil it.

Don't be stingy with the butter when you're frying these things after you boil them.  It will ensure even cooking and a more crisp outside. If the dough was too sticky, you didn't add enough flour while kneading.

I am Polish (I grew up in Poland) and had many great pierogi. I myself am still learning to make them and I try to practice whenever I can.  I like this recipe but the dough was too sticky and it needed more flour so I added it as I went.  I made the sauerkraut filling and in Poland we added finely chopped mushrooms to it so that's what I did. We ate them boiled with fried onion on top and tonight as leftovers I will fry the pierogi themselves.  I brushed them with oil before storing them in the fridge so they wouldn't stick together once they got cold.

This turned out EXCELLENT!  I had TON's of left over mashed potatoes after Thanksgiving and didn't want them to go to waist.  Dough came out perfect....added a little sugar to the dry mixture to sweeten it up a little bit (only about 2 tblsp).  For the filling I sauteed two sweet onions in a stick of butter, added about 3 cups of left over potatoes, added 1/2 cup of bacon bits.  Did a double batch and it made about 70 pierogi's (plus a couple of gigantic ones just for me!  :)  After stuffing and folding/crimping them, only boiled about six at a time.  Once they started floating I pulled them out and set them on a drying rack. (the ones I didn't just eat).  Gonna freeze most of them and then pull them out and saute them in butter before serving them up for the family at Christmas.

My Polish Grand Mother made these all the time, and she even added prunes that were soaked in hot water first before putting them into a Pierogi, talk about YUM...lol...
Tab did up a great recipe here, just follow her directions...and for those maybe having a little trouble making them, try freezing them over night before you put them in the boiling water...sometimes they seal a bit better :)

These are the best!! Years ago I used to buy them from a church that made them every Saturday to raise money. Since I moved I've been looking for a recipe that had the same "Old World" taste. My search is over!! Make extras and freeze them for later.

My husband did not know what a Pierogi was, and was a little bit hesitant to try these.  Once he ate them, he loved them.  He is german, and this reminded him of a german dish his grandmother used to make.  We definately make again.

I did my best, honest. I made the fillings which tasted delicious. My trouble came when dealing with the dough-- I am a novice and this is practically my first time flying solo on the dough plane. I had extreme difficulty in rolling it out to an acceptable length, and I think my biscuit cutter was too small, then the filling kept breaking open the dough when I was trying to press it together. Overall a disaster! After a couple hours I tossed in the towel-- tossed the dough in the trash, took all my filling and put it into a casserole dish with cheddar cheese on it. That was tasty. There were a few pierogi that made it out fine, and they tasted good. This recipe is probably good, I just have an inexperience-- I will get a pasta machine or something that will roll out pasta sheets for me then I'll hit this one up again.

I used to have a recipe from a Ukrainian grandmother of my friend, but I lost it. I've been struggling ever since to find a recipe like it. This is it! A fabulous recipe for anyone who LOVES perogies. I make mine with a potato/bacon/onion/ricotta cheese filling

Excellent and Easy dough.  I've made these my whole life starting young, This dough is the easiest yet...The saerkraut filling I simmered with chopped onion and fresh mushrooms and added some garlic, for about 30-45 minutes to tender it up.  The potato filling I added a container of cream cheese and a little milk and more butter to make thes extra tasty.  I froze these after boiling and then took out on Christmas day, browned with butter and they were EXCELLENT!!

I'm no pierogi connosiuer, but these were good.  I made mine too big, so they were too dough-y, but they were still good.  makes a lot of them!  I froze the leftovers for a quick snack to stir fry with onions and bacon and whatever veggies I have in the fridge.

Awesome recipe!  The dough was very easy to make and the pierogis were simple to assemble.  I had no issues with them falling apart in the water.  After I made them, I placed them in the refrigerator for the length of time it took for about 1 hour.  This recipe makes plenty!  Enough for quite a few meals if you use them as a side dish.  I froze 40 of them for another day.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Thank you, Theresa!
Dough was exceptional. Flavourful and relatively easy to work with. Filling: I added slow cooked onions and bacon and chives to the mashed potatoes -- much to the delight of everyone. Fried pierogies in butter, and taste was delightful. The one surprise was that my 2 1/2 inch pierogies became 3 1/3 inch pierogies once boiled, but I'm not complaining! Delightful fare served with spinach salad (no sour cream necessary!). My teenaged son actually asked for the recipe! I suspect that he'll make them for a birthday treat for me soon....

This review is just for the dough for the perogies. This was my first time making perogies, and the dough turned out great. I had to add a bit more flour, but other than that I didn't change a thing. I found when rolling out the dough, you should roll it a bit thinner, it's springy. I let the dough rest while I made the potato filling. When filling the rounds, I first wet the edges, then stretched it a bit as I folded it over. Make sure no filling is between the edges when you seal them. I found adding a bit of flour as I sealed them worked well. I placed the finished perogies on a floured silicone mat and let them set before cooking them. They had a great texture. I will definitely be making these again.

This was my first time making homemade pierogis on my own (family members usually make them). I made my own filling, but followed this for the dough. I followed the suggestion of one reviewer and rolled out the dough, cut the circles, well flowered them, then let them rest in the fridge for 15-30 minutes. This worked well! I was able to boil a few stuffed pierogi as I was stuffing others to not make the process as long. I boiled them for 2-3 minutes (another suggestion by the same reviewer), then let them cool on a plate with butter so they wouldn't stick together. They kept great in the refrigerator till I was ready to fry them up with lots of onions and butter the next day! All of my friends loved them! You could definitely boil them for 2 minutes, then freeze them to have homemade pierogis anytime!

Overall good! A little chewy. Froze Well. Took me over 2 hours. Served them topped with sour cream and green onion with a side of sauteed kielbasa, onions, and green pepper. Delicious. 

I would definitely pan fry them after boiling them. Helps make them a little less chewy . I froze the majority of them (after assembly on a sheet, spaced apart until frozen-then piled them in a tupperware); there was no noticeable difference from when they were fresh. It took me a little over two hours to do all the prep work- so prepare yourself for a long haul. I got 46 pierogi out of my batch.
Side note: I made the whole batch potato and have not tried the sauerkraut part of the recipe.

Unlike many other reviewers, my grandmother's pierogies came from the freezer section at the grocery store, so I don't have anything to compare this to.  We really enjoyed these, although they are a lot of work. I needed a nap after making them. I fried them with bacon and onions after boiling them. The person who suggested freezing them first to prevent them from splitting open was 100% right!  None of mine opened. Boil them 6-10 min if you are freezing them first. I agree with others that 1/4 tsp salt for the dough isn't enough. I don't like salty food, but this was way too bland.  I would use 1/2 tsp next time.

They are fantastic! I combined some of the sauerkraut with mashed potatoes and that was real good. Next time I will add some shredded cheddar cheese with the potatoes. The dough is perfect. Tasted like grandma made them. Definitely a keeper!!

I used this one on allrecipes, but I added more garlic and onion for flavor. Plus I added cooked sausage into the mix. And rather than do 1/2 with kraut and the other half with potato/sausage, I mixed it all together for the filling. They were delicious! Plus, I froze half of them made up so they can be boiled then fried on the fly.

Easy to do, but time-consuming. My husband and I spent 1-1/2 to 2 hours assembling the 48 pierogis. Well worth it! Hubby added some sugar to the kraut as he like sweet sauerkraut.

Though I didn't use the recipe for the filling, this dough is soft yet firm, easy to work with, and crisps up perfectly when frying these in butter. Easy to make and worth the time invested. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is only the 2nd perogi recipe I’ve made (first was from King Arthur flour and was delicious, but the dough was flakier than I thought it should be). However, this recipe and this seemed odd to me. The baking powder was a strange addition in my opinion. I’ve never eaten perogies that fluff up when cooking. I typically like to sauté or fry perogies rather than boiling, so perhaps they don’t get so fluffy when you boil them? Either way, I’d suggest leaving out the baking powder, or at very least, reducing it by more than half.

We did a double batch and than proceeded to do another double batch. With the second batch I ran out of our normal sour cream. And ended up using an organic one that was more cream in color than white. This batch of dough was very hard to work with. Kept tearing as we rolled it out.

Delicious!! My family jacked every last bite of this goodness. I highly recommend this with some local smoked kilbasa and sour cream.  Make sure you don’t boil the pierogi longer than when it floats to the top. Also, dusted parchment paper really helped it from being too sticky.

I Started making this recipe and had to stop after I added the white pepper. It overpowered everything and made the potato filling inedible. From the reviews I've read so far, No one has said anything about this, so perhaps it is just my son and me who found it unappetizing. If you are not partial to white pepper or are unfamiliar with it, I recommend using it sparingly or not at all.

I have never even heard of pierogi but I thought it sounded good and decided to try it. They turned out perfect, no problems at all. Once I boiled them, I transferred them to a sheet of waxed paper and I had no problem with them sticking together like some reviewers mentioned. Even though I don't know what they are supposed to tasted like I say these are great!!!

Having only ever made the freezer brand pierogies, I had some leftover mashed potatoes and wanted to try this recipe.  They are pretty much a traditional Polish potato dumpling if that is what you're looking for. The reviewer who suggested finishing them off by sauteing them in butter really sealed the deal!

(A note on proportions: I am not sure how many pierogies this recipe is intended to make. It just states "12 servings". It is quite possible didn't roll out the dough quite thin enough, but half of my dough yielded 14 pierogies, or 28 for the full batch (3 1/2 inch diameter). Having said that, I had about twice the amount of potato filling I needed for half of the recipe, so I think the filling options are intended to be either or, but not both. )

I made the recipe exactly they way it is written.  If you like a puffy dough this is the one to use.  My mom is 100% polish and I grew up with her making Pierogi and knew what the ingredients she used were but not the amounts.  I made the dough again and left out the baking powder and got the exact result I was looking for.  More of a noodle consistency.  Very happy to have found this recipe (less the baking powder)

I make a rosemary chicken, potato, spinach and 3 cheese filling.  The dough comes out spot on!  I used the advice of another reviewer and I freeze mine - make sure they don't touch each other while freezing!  Then place in a zip lock for use at any time!  There are only two of us, and this recipe makes a lot so we are able to have them over several meals/weeks!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a pretty good dough and the yield is pretty good.

What surprised me was the sauerkraut filling.  Never had it before (usually only the meat filling or potato filling.  It was awesome and easy to make.   

I've had store bought pierogies and I swear this potato filling is better than them all.  

Unfortunately, these little buggers take a bit to learn how to do - but it's worth it in the end.   Furthermore, I found that if I make a batch and place them in the freezer for around 2 hours they're easier to handle and/or easier to freeze so that they don't get stuck to each other.

I had leftover mashed potatoes and sauerkraut and was going to make a Pierogi Casserole.  First I had to Google to find out what they were. LOL!.  Then I combined the potato and Sauerkraut in one dumpling.  I didn't cook them in the water I used them in the casserole and they were wonderful.

I have really enjoyed making this recipe and sharing with my family. This dough was easy to make and a fun thing for the kids to work with to. I made sauerkraut, potato and cheese, potato and onion and potato and bacon fillings. These all worked well with this dough. I didn't use normal flour either. We use high protein flour for healthier foods. This turned out really well. I also made gluten free dough as well but used water instead of sour cream.  Still turned out really well. When cooking both batches of pirogies I found if you didn't pinch both sides with the fork it opened in the water. I froze the majority of the batches I made. They still taste really yummy and cooked well. Perfect recipe to work with and make a day out of it. Good task to do to have family time with to.

I have tried many pierogi recipes and this one, by far, is the best! I only made the potato ones until I tried out the recipe, cant wait to make the saurkraut and I'm even hoing to try cottage cheese, church by me used to make them but stopped. This is now my go to recipe for pierogi.

I made the dough as instructed and my own filling with mashed potatoes, bacon and cheddar...it made do many and i had dough and filling left, but was too tired to use it all up.... OMG the perogies were gone in a flash and had i finished all the dough and filling they'd probably gone too...

Yum! Followed the recipe almost to the letter and wound up with some seriously delicious pierogi and enough leftovers for another meal or two. It's uncanny how much these taste like what my Polish grandparents used to make. I did find the dough was quite sticky so I allowed it to rest in the fridge for about fifteen minutes and generously floured anything it touched - hands, rolling pin, counter, cup rim (I don't have a biscuit cutter), etc. I had some minor issues with the circles shrinking up once cut so I rolled-cut-and rolled again to stretch it back out before filling and folding. Keep in mind these expand by about 25% when boiled so I'd size up a pot to avoid spillover. Finally, I recommend getting experimental with filling! I like to add a little lightly seasoned (cooked) ground pork to the sauerkraut ones, farmer's cheese to the potato pierogi if I'm feeling traditional, and I can't wait to try and make my Babcia's "Thanksgiving Pierogi." She used to take all the leftovers and make a few fillings - yam and turkey, potato and pea, etc. There are so many good recommendations in the reviews I'm excited to get started!

Just like my baba used to make. These perogies have the taste of the deliciousness of old world tradition passed down through generations. I will never buy perogies again.

Wondeful, traditional- the dough was pretty sticky and needed more flour and also didn't make enough for all the potato and saurkraut, but it did make plenty and we ate the saurkraut filling with the periogies. Rinse the saurkraut if you want it less strong. Fry with butter after boiling. Tastes like my polish grandma's!

These were  a bit of work, but well worth the extra effort. We had a bit of trouble with the dough. At first it was too sticky,  we added extra flour and then let it rest for 15 minutes.It was better but we still had trouble stretching and keeping it stretched, so they were a bit 'doughy'. We will definitely try these again.

Just made these for my third time to be honest all I use this recipe for is the dough I make my own cheesy mash potatoes for them and they turn out perfect every time as long as you know your way around a kitchen and how to make things from scratch disregard these bad reviews cause apparently they just don't know how to cook and it drives me insane people giving it a bad review cause they don't know what they are doing

Great, easy recipe. Tastes yummy. Can't keep the dough refrigerated for long though; goes bad (yes, wrapped in plastic in fridge) in less than 24 hrs. But if you make the dough and use it up--terrific!

The dough is spot on. Took me back to my childhood, helping mom. I added mushrooms to my kraut filling. Boiled then pan seared the first time. Getting ready to deep fry my frozens, after boiling.

1) The dough is delicate, I used my kitchen aid dough hook, but when the dough got a bit sticky I added about 1/2 cup of flour 2) When you are rolling out on the counter, be liberal with the flour on the counter and on the dough surface 3) When you cut your rounds, make the dough a little thicker (when you add the filling, you will stretch out the dough a little more) 4) flour your rounds on both sides and stack them on a plate, if you refrigerate your rounds for a few hours they will be easy to work with. 5) Make sure your filling has no juice! If you use the sauerkraut recipe add a bit of mashed potato to pull it together and drain and fry the sauerkraut for a few mins to boil away all of the leftover juice. 6) When making the mashed potatoes it helps to almost over whip them so they start to become a bit "gummy", not too much, but enough so you can make balls out of the mixture 7) If the pierogi "looks" sealed but you didn't fold it over or use a fork to bind it, it will probably come apart in the boiling water. 8) drop the pierogi's 1 at a time into the boiling water so they cook for a few seconds before the next is dropped in, this stops them from sticking together, I found that 2 mins of boiling was sufficient, and I fried them after.

I just added another notch to my culinary belt with this one!  My husband said they were the best pierogi he has ever had. Now for the details: I used this recipe for the dough only, making my own fillings of mashed potato and Monterey Jack, and another of mashed sweet potato. I followed the dough recipe as described, but found it VERY sticky. Make sure you have at least a cup or 2 extra of flour to add and keep the surface covered. I rolled out portions of dough and cut with a ravioli cutter, laying on a cookie sheet coated with flour (lots of flour to keep from sticking). I put my potato mix in ziplock bags and cut the corner, piping a small blob on each dough circle, brushed the edges with water and sealed with a fork. I transferred to another sheet with flour, finishing all. Made about 2 dozen with a 3" cutter. I put the pan of pierogi into the freezer for a few hours. To serve, Boiled for a 5 minutes or so in a large pan of water then plopped into a pan of sautéed onions and butter to fry up a bit. I served with a big scoop of butter and onion and a dollop of sour cream. Perfection!

Everyone has to make these to know why you will never buy  them from the store ever again.  Make sure you season your potatoes well to your taste, I put colby jack cheese garlic and onion powder butter milk and sour cream and salt and pepper .  The dough was just excellent as described. No fake cheese or anything, then I fried them in butter and served with sour cream. Excellent !!!

loved the taste of the pierogi.  The directions did not share the stickiness of the dough.  It took a bit more flour to get it right. 
I will definitely make again.

This recipe is better than any restaurant served pierogi dish I have ever had! My 70 year old mother said they taste like her mother's (who came from Poland). I make my own sauerkraut filling, so the fillings part I didn't try. Of note, this dough can be rerolled twice but after that it because stiff and quite difficult to work with. I try and get as many cuts from a roll out as I can. And they can be frozen, but it's work and I used wax paper, plastic wrap, and a freezer bag to ensure they stay nice. They do not last in the refrigerator; one or two days MAX. They can be fried in a fryer - they puff up a little but the flavor is there! I followed the recipe exactly. Thank you for adding this recipe to the site; you have made my family very happy!!

I use this recipe for the dough portion only and make my own potato cheddar filling.  I like this dough because it doesn't fall apart in the boiling water like some other recipes do. I don't know if there is a typo in the recipe but I certainly don't add a full TABLESPOON of baking powder. A teaspoon is sufficient.

I'm Polish and we adapted our dough recipe using this recipe by adding sour cream to our dough. It makes it more pliable. 
For the sauerkraut filling, we always rinse our sauerkraut, otherwise it's way too sour. We chop the sauerkraut but you could also put it in a food processor to get rid of the long strings of cabbage. We sauté chopped onions in butter then add the sauerkraut, salt and pepper. It really only needs to be warmed. 
Once the pierogi are boiled in water, we drain them and add them to a pan with browned saltine cracker crumbs in butter. That's how our family makes them. We've never made them using any other filling. We freeze them to heat up throughout the year. My mom and I make these together once a year and share with family during the holidays.

A lot of work for "ok" taste.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was use whole wheat flour, I don't suggest it.  I also recommend rolling the dough as thin as you can so you don't get an overwhelming taste of dough with each bite.  I would also suggest adding more flavor to the fillings as they are pretty plain.

I used spelt flour, low fat sour cream and low fat cheese. They turned out amazingly however because low fat sour cream is much more runny than the full fat version i had to add one extra cup of flour.
I can't eat onions so for the filling i used mashed potato, pork & veal mince, low fat cheese and jalapeños. I added salt, pepper and paprika too.
I fried them after boiling them and i'm currently eating them now! Yum!!
I bought a dumpling press from a $2 shop today and that made life a lot easier when it came to filling the pastry. Highly recommended grabbing yourself one.

I found this dough nearly impossible to work with.  It was both very sticky and very elastic, which made it impossible to roll out to 1/8".  I ended up adding about 1/4c extra flour, and it still was very frustrating.  Pierogi are hard enough to make, this dough did not make me want to do it ever again.

This takes some times, but it's worth it.  I like both types in this recipe, but the sauerkraut ones were certainly more popular with my family, so I may just skip the potato ones next time.

This was an excellent recipe. After I made them, my friends came over and ate ALL of them while saying how good they were. Can't wait to make them again!

I'm part polish and decided to make these for Christmas Eve dinner to surprise my family instead of buying the store bought ones. They were awful, I was mortified. I'll keep looking

The dough was easy to work with and had a great flavor. I made my own filling. The only issue I had was freezing them-even though I coated them with butter first they still stuck together. Next time I will use my foodsaver to keep them from touching when I freeze them. Overall a very good recipe and easy enough for a first-timer.

This was alright.  We rolled the dough out to according to the directions and it was really gooey still after being boiled for over five minutes.

I am from a Polish family, but my grandmother was the last one to make them from scratch.  I have never attempted making them before, but they turned out wonderful.  I just used some leftover mashed potatoes with some pan fried onions added. I pan fried the pierogi in butter after boiling them until they floated.  Perfection!

A couple of things I did not realize...the dough needs a lot of flour added to it and the board to work with it.  Also, the pierogi grow when you boil them...a nice surprise!  I have read other reviews and I think next time I will let the dough sit for 10-15 minutes before trying to use it, and I will pinch off dough rounds instead of trying to roll out a large portion of the dough which was difficult for me as a beginner.  Great recipe that allowed me to get back to my roots!

Best pierogi recipe I've made so far! A few years ago two dear Polish sisters made pierogi for some friends and it was delicious! I've tried a couple of recipes but have never been able to replicate exactly what they made that day. This is the closest yet! Delicious served with sour cream. I substituted the flour for half plain flour and half wholemeal flour and also added some grated cheese to the potato filling. I am off to boil up the second batch right now! :D

This is almost identical to my Lithuanian father-in-law's; just missing the last step. Fry them in a little butter after you boil them. It gives it just a little crunch, and the flavor is amazing!!
We also omit the sauerkraut and opt for only mashed potatoes with a little cheese.

Yummy!  Made these last night and they were fabulous! The dough was nice and easy to work with. I let the dough rest for about 30 minutes and I used my kitchen aid mixer with the dough attachment instead of kneading by hand. Worked wonderfully!  Thanks for the recipe!

5 stars for sure!!! Used my own mashed potatoes WITH CHEESE, fired in butter and onions, and thought I was on the steps of Heaven!! We always put Cooper Sharp, Velveeta, or Cheddar in the potato mix. I'll be using this recipe to also make pierogi lasagna! Thanks so much!!!!!!

This recipe was tasty.  I added garlic powder and a pinch a cajun seasoning to the filling.

However, I must admit that I did have a problem with the dough.  It was much too sticky and I had to keep adding flour.

The recipe says to cut it into 3" circles.  I made the circles larger because even putting a small amount of the potato mixture into the 3" circle filled it to overcapacity when folding over.

I had no problems with the pierogi bursting open.  It's just that they weren't exactly the prettiest specimens I ever made (guess because the dough was so sticky).

I'll keep trying because these dumplings were tasty and tender. I just need more practice.

The filling was great but the dough was not  what I was looking for.  It turned out like bread after it was boiled.  I was looking for something more along the lines of ravioli dough.

I made these after trying several different recipes.  This Pierogi recipe was by far the best I have tried.  My polish mother-in-law was very impressed when I made these for Christmas.  I had my own filling with potato and chesse that I borrowed from another recipe, but this dough recipe is the best I have tried and the easiest.

Growing up, My Momma would make these with a burger & mashed potato mixture... She always made them best. Since my family loves Sauerkraut, I made it with Sauerkraut, They were very yummy... However, for some reason some of the dumplings busted open & I had Sauerkraut all over in my water.

This is a great recipe. I grew up with pierogi served on Christmas Eve prepared by my grandmother and great aunts. The last of them passed away this year so I decided to try and keep the tradition going. I am hoping that everyone else is as pleased as my husband and I were with the batch we made. I did not have the family recipe but this one certainly tasted similar.

Okay, so I never knew what Pierogis were until I was 16 and had the frozen kind at a friend's house.  I liked them then so decided to try them from scratch when I saw this recipe.  Yum, yum, yum! I LOVE PIEROGIS! Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making it again.
