I give this a 5* but not for the reasons you might think! Please read on.
The salad turned out nice. 
Since my diet really limited the content it wasnt much more than a basic pasta salad with green onions, cilantro and I added some cubed cheddar. I made the dressing with reduced sodium soy and held the pepper flakes and mayo, however, after tasting it I decided to add the mayo, thankfully, it made a great difference for me and I enjoyed it a lot. 
 
So here's the kicker and I cant believe the results: 
I used the basic dressing sans mayo and increased to Â½ C reduced sodium soya (I even took a walk on the wild side and used the pepper flakes!) as a marinade for the pork! Fabulous! 

I loved it, I loved it, I loved it! 

I will try this again with chicken in the salad or as a marinade! Thanks

We absolutely loved this dish. As with everything in life, you make changes to suit your own personal tastes, but this one is a basic 5 star recipe. To the dressing, I added an extra clove of garlic, a bit of Orange Zest, Sesame Seeds and dried Celery Flakes. I also used 1/2 tsp. cayenne, as opposed to the 3/4 tsp. chili pepper flakes and omitted the mayo.
For the salad, I used 8 oz. pasta with more of the veggies, 1/2 lb. roast beef and  all of the dressing. I thought it was perfect that way, and actually  would have been lacking in the dressing dept. otherwise. It was delicious at dinnertime, and it was even better at 2am, when I pulled a refrigerator raid. I think next time I make this, I will actually mix it up ahead of time, and give the flavors a chance to blend. Delicious dressing... a keeper in my book! Oh, we also used a blend of Honey Roasted Peanuts and Cashews, which was kind of nice. Thank you, Pam Anderson!

I have to agree with Tuni.  I thought that this was a great change from usual pasta salad.  I added extra vinegar to the dressing, used honey instead of sugar, I didn't have crushed red pepper flake so I added some Asian Essence. I put the dressing in a shaker to mix it.  For the salad I used rotini and probably only half a box.  I didn't have peanuts so I used some sunflower seeds, and I cooked the broccoli a bit with the pasta, and added some fresh peas that I had in the fridge.  Next time I will take Tuni's suggestion and use some Oj in the dressing and maybe even add some mandarins to the salad.  Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch!

While I agree with the other reviewers on the fact that it is a very good salad, it still needs a few adjustments to make it to my 5* book. First of all, I used rice noodles. I hate it when an Asian-inspired recipe calls for Italian pasta! I reduced the pasta to 1/2 lb but I kept the same amount of everything else. Next time I'll probably omit the peanuts because i couldn't taste them anyway. I'll skip the carrots too, just because I don't care for them. All in all, however, it made a very enjoyable dinner. Thanks for posting, Pam!

I halved this recipe and it still made quite alot.  This is a really great salad.  Next time I'll omit the deli beef because the flavor got lost anyway in the process and just use this as a side dish.  I love sesame oil but although it was not too overpowering, next time will decrease it by 1/2 tsp.  Added toasted sesame seeds, blanched the broccoli, used flat fettucine noodles so it appeared more 'Asian', and added a bit of wasabi mustard and orange juice/zest to the dressing.  Emulsified dressing in the food processor.  I loved the textures in here.  Next time will cut down on the carbs, and up the bean sprouts.  Beautiful colors and textures, as well as great asian flavors make this a great salad to serve along side a grilled steak.  This is a meal in itself and a nice summer meal at that.  I am a garlic lover so upped the garlic.  Will also use more green onion next time, just out of personal preference.  Very nice recipe and a nice change of pace from the regular pasta salad.

Delicious dressing without the mayo! The only change I made: I chopped some chicken breast and marinated it in some soy sauce, sesame oil and some garlic and then sauteed it. I used this instead of the beef. I also used ramen noodles- way more delicious than just penne pasta! Delicious recipe- thank you!

My husband and I LOVED this one.  The spices are the perfect mix.  The dressing is what makes it - you can really throw in any vegetables and make it work.

This salad is nice if you're looking for a different taste from the usual.  I followed the recipe except used medium sized rice noodles from the international aisle of the grocery store and blanched the broccoli in the boiling water at the last minute (both as recommended below).  YUM!

Yummy and more healthy with a few changes:

*whole wheat pasta 
**instead of roast beef I loved using beef bacon from Trader Joes - chopped into bits**
*skip mayo and vegetable oil
*blanch carrot chunks too
*use real ginger - more than 1 tsp
*no need to chop peanuts
*more cilantro than what was called for
*whole bag pre cut broccoli and about half a bag of baby carrots chopped

I added additional garlic, used rice noodles & only used 8 oz., used fresh ginger & I added a couple of pea-sized dollops of wasabi paste. I had some leftover honey & garlic pork tenderloin so I sliced it very thin & then cut it into bite sized pieces ...I subbed that for the roast beef. I also added a couple of tbps. of mirin but I'm not so sure that was a good move...I think the OJ would be a much better compliment. I served this w/ a side of Ginger-Spiced Cucumbers (from allrecipes) & we followed the meal w/ Vietnamese Iced Coffee...was a refreshing dinner for a hot summer night...thanks again Pam!

Delicious! Great combination of flavours. I make this for potlucks, or just keep a bowl of it in the fridge for lunches. It is great in a wrap! I found a nice way to make this vegetarian though, so instead of the beef I used some extra firm tofu, cut into cubes, marinated in tamari, garlic, and sesame oil. I pan fried the tofu until in was browned, and let it cool. Very good, and a nice addition of protein for you veggies out there! Also, it seemed wrong to use Italian style pasta for this, so instead I use either udon noodles or rice glass noodles.

Awful.  Did not like this at all. The dressing is not good.  I even tried some more with just oil and vinegar and that tasted a little  bit better.  Would not recommend this.

I made this for dinner one night as a stir fry (my husband isn't a big fan of raw veggies or salads) and served it hot. It was SO good! I highly recommend trying it this way as well.

This dish was amazing! I followed it exactly (which is not what I normally do with recipes) and we are taking it on a road trip. I think this dish would be great to entertain with and looks beautiful. Thanks for sharing this dish!

This was really yummy.    I used regular rice vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar.  I substituted 2 t. fresh chopped ginger for the ground ginger.  For the penne pasta I used Thai rice noodles instead.  I put all of this on chopped Napa cabbage.  Delicious.

The dressing is awesome!!!!  I didn't have rice wine vinegar and used regular and it was still great.  I loved the crunch.  I used wheat penne noodles, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, red pepper and bean sprouts.  Just throw in what you have in your fridge.  I would love cubed, chunked chicken in it for a meal.

This was really good. I followed the recipe exactly but had to add a little more sugar, and a lot more mayonnaise. The dressing definitely improved during the course of the day. I think this recipe would work well with chicken too. Thanks!

This was awesome. The dressing is so good. I used ramen instead of pasta and I left out the mayonnaise and meat. The  only only issue i had was I hadn't realized it was a cold salad so I had to figure out how to chill the ramen. Also, I think the broccoli might have been better lightly steamed. But overall mmmmm.

I am breaking the cardinal rule, and rating a recipe that I made changes to. That being said, the dressing is what makes this salad killer and I made just as is so it's justified in my mind! This dressing is sooo good I served mine over napa cabbage, left out the red pepper,(we like it, but have it in just about every other salad I make), added celery and water chestnuts, used sesame and sunflower seeds and left out the peanuts.  Left out the beef and had grilled pork chops on the side, and possibly the biggy, I soaked rice noodles as per package instructions (in hot water for a couple of minutes) then fried until somewhat crispy and used instead of pasta.  My husband looked at me between mouthfuls and said "I could eat this every day".

WOW! This came out great! I was a little skeptical at first when I tasted the sauce, but the next day when I put it all together- it was awsome! Ithink the trick is letting the sauce sit overnight for the flavors to develop.

i love the flavors in this recipe.  i omitted the beef, used soba noodles instead of traditional pasta, and have made it with many different vegetables--all to great results!

The ginger sauce is wonderful.  I made my own modifications (I used aspargus, carrots and winter onions)and served it hot on thin pasta... no regrets.  My kids loved it but found the sauce a little 'hot' for them, next time I'll use a little less than 1/2 tsp red peppper flakes.  I plan on making it again.

Very pretty side dish! I did not add the beef and reduced the soy sauce to 4T and doubled the rice wine vinegar and added 2 T of pimentos and 6 oz of sliced waterchestnuts. I blanched baby carrots for 1 min in a steamer basket then removed and added the broccoli for 1 min and then removed and added the sprouts for 1 min. Combined all in glass bowl and I let the dressing marinate the salad all day long. Topped with raisins and peanuts. Wonderful! Thank you for the recipe.

We loved the sauce for this recipe, I actually added more sesame oil and less crushed red pepper.  I've made this recipe 3 times now and I haven't used the cold cuts or bean sprouts.  I've made this with match stick carrots, red pepper, brocolli and either linguini or fresh asian noodles.  The most recent time I've made this salad I blanched chicken breast and bok choy and shredded them, added cilantro and chopped peanuts.  My Ava loved it and asked to bring it to school for lunch!

I'm eating this right now. It's so good! I used whole wheat spaghetti noodles instead of penne because I think it mimics asian noodles more. I didn't have rice wine vinegar on hand so I used red wine vinegar and I can't notice the difference. I topped my salad off with a squirt of sriracha sauce - Yum!

Pretty tasty! I hate vinegar, so I omitted that and added orange juice. I used a frozen package of stir fry vegetables and a box of macaroni n cheese without the cheese ;) I'm the picky one in the family, and even I liked it!

Delicious and unique pasta salad.that was a hit with my husband and kids.  I really liked the dressing and all the veggies.  Instead of using deli roast beef, I used a few tablespoons of the dressing (before adding mayo and oil) and a little extra soy sauce to marinade some top round steak for 2 hours, then sliced it thin and sauteed it in the marinade.  It tasted great tossed in the salad. Also, I forgot to add the cilantro and we still really liked it.  I will definitely make this again and share it with other.  Would be a good potluck dish too.

I had some bean sprouts to use up and found this recipe after an ingredient search.  I really liked this except I found the dressing to be way too watery.  I will admit, I was making this to be served immediately and therefore had to rinse the pasta in cold water.  I'm assuming if I followed the cookie sheet directions it would retain it's sticky starch and help the dressing stay on.  Still, I'll probably use peanut butter as a thickener next time.  I got my deli girl to give me two thicker slices of black angus which I julienned at home.  It worked great, so I'd keep the beef in.  Followed the rest to a T.  Flavor was great, just needed a sauce that would stick.

I actually used teriyaki marinated steak, thinly sliced, in place of the roast beef. It was delicious. My husband was actually not very keen on the idea, but he loved it! Excellent leftovers- and there were a lot!

This is a relatively simple recipe that you can definitely modify to fit your tastes. 

A few things:
- The recipe calls for roast beef, which is definitely easy but kinda gives the salad a deli feeling. If I make this again, I might use shaved beef. 
- Like a few other reviewers mentioned, I never actually put the dressing on the salad, which has helped to keep it fresh for a few days. I have found that the other flavors have really begun to mix sitting together. 
- I also used rice noodles (udon), and just 8oz at that- which to me almost felt like too much.

I almost never make recipes as written - Iâm usually looking for something to make with items I have on hand. This was no exception. I had a bunch of leftover cooked plain angel hair pasta and various other things needed for this recipe. Instead of the roast beef, I used the Hormel brand Beef Roast Au Jus (I poured out the au jus, lightly shredding the beef once it was warmed, and adding some sesame oil & soy sauce to make the flavors âmatchâ better. Honestly, I use this product for lots of different cooking cheats! Iâm surprised thereâs not a website dedicated to their versatility!). I then added a small 5oz bag of frozen shelled soy beans that Iâd purchased once by mistake (we eat a lot of the in-shell variety and I wasnât paying attention, apparently!). I boiled a pot of water and tossed in some thinly sliced red & orange bell peppers, and the last of some bags of shredded carrots & a shredded broccoli âslawâ mix Iâd used for something else - then dropped the cooked pasta in to heat it back up. I eyeballed most of it but tried to stay relatively close to the proportions for the dressing... but (Iâm a pro at cheat cooking!) used the pre-minced garlic and sesame stored in olive oil, and used the âRooster

I give this four stars.  I it very good, but it was just too much pasta for dressing.  I had to double the soy-ginger dressing because the pasta kept absorbing all of the dressing.

Very nice flavors in this! It might be even tastier with just a little bit more ginger in the dressing, but the flavor was excellent even so. I didn't have green onion, so I used about a third of a yellow onion. Whole wheat elbow pasta worked fine (as would pretty much any pasta). All the veggies were a nice touch and added some nice color. The leftovers were good, but not nearly as good as the freshly made salad with the crunch of the fresh veggies. Be sure to serve it as fresh as possible!

I served this for a church potluck, and everybody loved it. I got lots of compliments. I didn't use deli roast beef, though. Instead, I just cooked a pot roast in the crock pot the day before, and then shredded it for the salad. Remember, this was for a crowd. It was very good, a great mix of flavors, and very colorful.

The whole family enjoyed this cold dish and asked for the leftovers the next day. I cooked a beef roast in the crockpot the day before instead of using deli roast beef. I didn't have the sesame oil and fresh cilantro, but I added a bit of fresh frozen cilantro to the dressing. The crunch of the bean sprouts peanuts, bell pepper and blanched broccoli combined with the smooth pasta all covered in the the tangy dressing is great!

I've repurposed this versatile sauce on not just pasta, but also hot stir fries. When attending a vegetarian/gluten free/lactose free potluck, I make the this soy-ginger sauce for my rice noodles, soybean, bean sprout, and cabbage stir fry. For meat eaters I add the beef from the original recipe back in. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I prefer rice noodles over penne for health reasons.

We choose to skip the pasta and serve the meat and veggies over a bed of lettuce with dressing over top.  Only changes we made were using chicken instead of beef and plain greek yogurt instead of the vegetable oil in the dressing.  This was an instant hit as a dinner salad.  We loved the spicy, creamy asian flavors with sweet pops and crunch from the veggies.

I had my doubts on this one because there were a lot of ingredients to buy and things to chop, and at one point my kitchen looked like a cyclone hit it, but at the end when I tasted it, it was heavenly.  The flavors were all there -- like something you'd taste at a restaurant with a chef who knew what he was doing.  I'll try it out on the family tomorrow and see what they think.  I added sugar snap peas and toasted sesame seeds.  I was tempted to add a little peanut butter to the dressing but I didn't want to mess with it this time - I'll try that next time.  I used red bell pepper to add color and I did the carrots in the food processor until they were pretty fine - that saved the work of grating them.  I'll make this one again.

Hmm.  I didn't like this that much--thought it was bland, but I also didn't have cilantro, which might have made it more palatable to me.  Bf liked it though.  I dind't have pepper or roast beef so served without.  It's not bad, just not my favorite.  Bf thought it needed a bit more soy sauce, so we put a little more on and it was ok.  I'll try with cilantro next time and see if that's my issue.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I loved this recipe. We used venison instead of beef but it was still excellent. Also, I just threw the broccoli in raw. We will definitely be making this again!

We really enjoyed this.  I used tri-colored spirals and served it on a bed of baby spinach.  My crisper and garden are overflowing so I added a few more veggies.  1/2 yellow squash and zucchini, some slivered green beans (blanched with the broccoli), some red and yellow bells for color and I had an ear of corn with no agenda so I cut the kernals off and tossed it in. I bought pre-julienned carrots and rough chopped them and lightly cooked them with the corn kernals. Will use this a lot for school lunches.

I loved this!  Very easy to make, even with the long list of ingredients. Makes alot, so I usually don't dress all of it, so leftovers will keep longer.
