This recipe was so easy.  I used canned raspberries but frozen would have kept there shape better.  I also used blackberry jam for a mixed berry taste and it turned out perfectly.  Did take awhile to thicken, but worth the wait.  I used this with Chantal's New York Cheesecake also on allrecipes, and served it on the side.
