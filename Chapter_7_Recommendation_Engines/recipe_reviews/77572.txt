Quite delicious!!! I cooked the rice separately and used 1 can crushed tomatoes, 1 can tomato sauce, and used large fresh shrimp. Some extra seasonings, garlic powder and a little sugar to cut bitterness of tomatoes (maybe 1/2 tsp). Finally I added in about a cup of frozen okra 5 min before it was done. Served over buttered white rice w/ crusty french bread. My hunny could eat this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!

Bubba, I love you.  This recipe was AWESOME!  My husband kept nudging me and telling me how good it was.  I added more celery, onion, and bell pepper than I should have, but it was all the merrier.  I didn't think it was going to be very good....until it all started to marry in the pot.  YUUUUMMMMM.  I even left out the bacon and shrimp, and it rocked!!!!!  I used minute rice, boil in the bag, so I cooked the rice first, but not too much, and then poured it in the brew.  That worked out really well.  I'm always leary of cookin rice, I can screw that up fast!  Uncle Ben's Boil in Bag is awesome.

I liked this version better than the one I had in New Orleans.  I had kielbasa on hand and was looking for a way to use it, so I thought that putting it in a jambalaya sounded good.  I used Smart Balance to saute the veggies instead of bacon... the bacon sounded too heavy, plus in the south, everything is cooked in butter, right?

I used extra creole seasoning, an extra teaspoon or maybe a little more and served it with Crystal hot sauce.  Excellent!  My eight year old agrees.

I've never made Jambalaya before, and this recipe was a huge hit with everyone in the family. My mom has had Jambalaya in Louisiana and said mine was the best she's ever had! I did make adjustments. I used 1.5 onions, and 2 bell peppers (one red, one green). I used 14oz of kielbasa because I wanted to use up the whole package. I used 2 chicken breasts instead of 1. I may have put a little more than 2 cups of jasmine rice into the mix, and in addition to the crushed tomatoes, I used a 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes with their juice. I used fresh medium-sized shrimp. I used a 32oz box of beef broth and a 14.5oz can of chicken broth. I used both fresh and dried thyme because I had fresh on hand. I added 3 cloves of chopped fresh garlic in with the onions and peppers during the last minute, and powdered onion and garlic powder to taste. I also added crushed red pepper flakes to taste. All in all, I think it was perfect; my rice cooked up perfectly in about 20 minutes and the consistency was nice and thick. MAKE SURE YOU STIR THOROUGHLY EVERY 5 MINUTES WHILE THE RICE IS COOKING SO IT DOESN'T STICK OR CLUMP IN THE POT!

OK, here's how to solve the rice issue. When the vegetables are almost done, stir in the rice so it gets coated with the bacon grease. Then add all of the other ingredients except shrimp and cooked bacon. This way, the grains stay separated and they soak up all the deliciousness of the tomatoes and stocks. There's no need to cook rice separately - this is jambalaya, not gumbo.

I made this last night and it was a hit!! Thanks for submitting such a great recipe. The only thing I changed was that I added more Cajun seasoning, a little crushed red pepper, 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper, and andouille sausage instead of smoked. I simmered everything except the shrimp, rice, and bacon for about 4 hours (so the house smelled really yummy) and added the last ingredients prior to serving. We gobbled it up!! Thanks again!

I have been making Bubba's jambalaya recipe for years, from scratch, and it's a request for every get-together. I hate it when commenters TOTALLY chsnge a recipe here, but I've made this more than 20 times now, so I thought I'd share my secret pre-step:

*Make your own stock from the chicken; I throw about 6 drumsticks in water with seasonings (celery leaves, parsley, onion, salt), so there's no need for beef broth or chicken stock--I have enough from scratch.

When the broth is done I de-bone the drums for the chicken in the recipe. Enjoy all, this one is the best!

This is very, very good.  I added the ingredients (minus the rice) and let it simmer for a couple of hours.  I also added some flour and water to thicken it up a little bit.  I seasoned it a bit more with some cayenne and pepper.  Will make it again!

I didnt read the comments that others made. I followed the directions and cooked the rice together instead of making it seperately, and my Jambalaya came out like mush. The flavor was good, but the texture was horrible. I will try this recipe again but I will make the rice seperately.

This is so delicious I made it 3 times in 1 week!
  I used turkey sausage, deli ham and leftover chicken and it came out wonderful!  Be sure to measure the Cajun Seasoning as directed or it will be "woo-wee" HOT!

I'm a firefighter and made this dish for 12 other firefighters on shift tonight at the firehouse.  The original recipe makes 12 servings, so naturally, I doubled it.  There were no leftovers.  As one guy put it, "That was either darn good jambalaya, or you didn't make enough!"  The only change I made was to substitute minute rice instead of regular long-cook rice simply for the sake of time.  I paired it up with garlic bread and a fruit salad, and everyone left the table stuffed and happy.  Great recipe!

This was a very good recipe.  My kids loved it.  The bacon was a nice touch.  Another item to add might be fish, I'll try that next time.  Simmer time was more like 45 minutes, but that might have been because I used store brand rice.  Next time I'll try Uncle Ben's and see what happens.

I am from South Louisiana and I have seen and eaten many different presentations on Jambalaya. I would say that this one rates right up there with some of the better ones. To the recipe I did add the following:
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp red pepper flakes
1 tsp black pepper
2 tsp salt
1 tsp Tabasco sauce
1 Tbl Worcestershire sauce
2 tsp file powder

This was an excellent dish. The whole family loved it, and so did the cafe. When using this recipe, I used it mostly as a base. Jambalaya, it should be known, is really a "Kitchen Sink" recipe used in New Orleans, traditionally made with the odds and ends and random measurements of whatever was left over. The recipe is great, but it is certainly not limited to the ingredients entailed here. To be fair, I made this recipe exactly as stated, and I rate that as 5 stars. But the next time, I used less rice, more liquid, andouille sausage (traditional in this kind of dish), larger shrimp and whatever else I had left over in my fridge and my freezer. I like my jambalaya soupier rather than ricier (dry). If you like it more of a casserole texture, use more rice. If you like to have a bit of slup-action going on, use less rice. It's a simple yet delicious recipe in the end.

My daughter usually picks through her meals, but she ate every bit of this dish. The only meat I used was turkey bacon, smoked chicken thighs and some frozen salad shrimp. I also used brown rice instead of white and pureed fresh tomatoes instead of using canned. Since nobody in my family likes a big bell pepper flavor, I roasted a red bell pepper and chopped it up and put it in with the meat. I only added the called for amount of Cajun seasoning, but it could definately use more (according to my taste). My husband and I just added LA hotsauce. This is a great recipe!

This recipe is delicious. I only made a couple very minor changes.   I diced up two jalapenos and added them to the onion mixture and added fresh ground pepper. I used brown rice and large shrimp because that's what I  had. And I garnished with some fresh flat leaf  parsley.    **one more thing, the chicken was a bit dry. I think next time, I'd poach it in some chicken stock and throw it in at the end.  Make sureyou taste before you add any salt. All the pork products, especially the bacon make it plenty salty...and I love salt. ;)

This was just okay.  I did not use the beef broth....Just doesn't sound good for a shrimp/pork/chicken dish.  Needs diced tomato and crushed tomato. Just wish rice wouldn't go to mush so quickly.  Basmati is usually a good choice...but even in this it went to mush.  And I didn't stir it a lot either.

Rice will be just right if you use the RIGHT kind of rice!  Long grain is perfect, can't use quick cooking or minute rice.  Basmati also will not work as well.

Made this recipe minus the tomatoes and celery (my Cajun husband approved these changes).  Used Tony Chachere's (there is no other...) seasoning and this came out delicious!  Added a little paprika (at the hovering Cajun's insistence) to kick up the flavor and color.  So worth the expense.

This recipe is a great starting place for jambalaya. It's basic and works well - I make this a few times a year when I have people over, and it's always well received (e.g. people destroy the pot and there are no leftovers).

However, I definitely tweak the recipe for my liking:
(1) I leave out the bacon (just use some vegetable oil instead). Too much of a pain, and you can't taste the bacon anyway.
(2) Get rid of the 1/2 lb ham, 1/2 lb chicken, 1/2 lb smoked sausage, 1/2 lb shrimp. I use 2 lbs of andouille sausage instead (you MUST use andouille. It doesn't taste right without it). Some people like shrimp in their jambalaya, I don't. I find it too bright.
(3) Technically, you're supposed to use long grain rice (e.g. Uncle Ben's), but I find it doesn't really matter. It tastes just fine with Jasmine rice.
(4) "20 minutes" is BS. It's more like 45 minutes. After about 30 minutes, check it and stir every now and then. You'll know it's ready once there's no more water at the bottom (it's all been absorbed/evaporated).
(5) "2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning" is also BS, unless you like flavorless food. I just put a lot in. You really need to use Tony Chachere's or Zatarains - the off-brand creole seasonings don't taste right to me. Generally, I'll start with something like 4 tablespoons in and a little bit of black pepper and Tabasco. The seasoning is really up to you.

We decided to make this to bring to a Super Bowl party in honor of the Saints making their first appearance.  We never made jambalaya before so we did a trial run the week before.  Great recipe!!   Super easy and delicious!  I made my own cajun seasoning blend from this site and used that.  I doubled the chicken, used 4 andouille sausage links and did not use any bacon.  I cooked the rice separately and added it to avoid the problems with sticking that some reviewers mentioned.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!  Thanks!!

Good recipe. Left out the shrimp and used Andouille sausage. Makes a lot.

delicous!!---I  served this with homemade biscuits --  it makes a lot, even though I made 1/2  a batch.  I still have enough for another meal. I used long grain brown rice and added a little more. about 1/4 cup. I  used large uncooked shelled shrimp  and added   those  in the last 10 min on top  and they cooked fine.... spices were  enough - I did add 3 fresh garlic when I cooked the vegetables-- thanks for sharing  your recipe - I now  have a new meal to serve.

My husband loved this dish. However the rice got too soft. Next time I try making the rice separate and pour the jambalaya over it.

Love it!  Definitely gets my top approval rating of YUM!  Of course I changed a couple things... I cooked the rice separate and just ladeled the soup onto the rice.  Instead of salad shrimp I used tiger prawns which I blackened and served on top of the soup.  My hubby went bananas for this stuff!   YUM!

Fantastic recipe! Very easy and delicious. I like that it has lots of flavor without a lot of heat, but that it can be easily adjusted for those that prefer more heat in their dishes.  I used turkey bacon in mine and since the turkey bacon doesn't produce drippings like regular bacon I sauteed the veggies in melted butter.  This recipe is a definite keeper and one I will make more often.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! My picky eaters devoured it. This recipe can feed an army so I shared the rest with neighbours. All with rave reviews. I used farmer sausage because of availability. My girls don't like too much heat so I did cut back 1/4tsp on the seasoning. Here is a tip for the rice issues mentioned in some posts. Soak the rice for 5 minutes and rinse it well before adding it to the pot (something I learned from our exchange students). This removes some starches and speeds up cook time.

I can give this recipe 5 stars because I used the Cajun Spice Mix recipe from this website and adjusted the heat to suit my family's taste.  I tried it with store bought cajun seasoning and it was way too hot for us.  My husband and daughter asked me to cook the rice separately so they could control the final mix to suit them and this worked nicely for us.  Without the rice to absorb some of the liquid, I was concerned that it would be too soupy and debated reducing the amount of broth, however, I used the amount of broth specified and it was great served over the rice.

NOTE:  If you want to have Perfect ( not mushy ) rice in your Jambalaya;  You Must MEASURE ALL of the Liquid ingredients ( the Tomatoes Count as Liquid!! ) and be Sure that your Measure of Rice is at least half the Measure of liquid!  ALSO; remember how your Mama Drilled into your head "not to open the pot after you added the rice because it would ruin the rice"?  FORGET IT!!!  This  IS NOT JUST "RICE" , this is Jambalaya!!!  You Have Got To Stir The Pot!!!

This was really really good. I didn't have any chicken on hand so I just left it out and used turkey bacon. I'm impaired when it comes to cooking rice but it turned out perfectly and we had leftovers for lunch today which is a def plus =)

Fixed this for a New Year's eve party and to a person everyone loved it.  Followed the recipe as closely as possible.  Made my own chicken broth by deboning and boiling down the large breast bone/skin.  I did add about 1/2 package of frozen cut okra about 4 minutes before adding my cut up shrimp (16-20count) and saved 8 of the shrimp to garnish the top.  I chose to sprinkle the bacon on top rather than mix it up in the dish as called for.  I think I was true enough to the recipe that this is a "true" five stars.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

This was a great recipe. I used Andouille sausage in place of smoked and added 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper and another tsp of Cajun seasoning. I also added 1/4 tsp of creole seasoning and tempered a bit of the hot liquid with 1 Tbs flour and added that to the mixture to thicken. I added cooked rice and prawns to the simmered ingredients 15 minutes before serving. My husband loved this and wants me to make it again soon. Thanks for a great recipe.

I am usually not critical but feel this is missing something.I would  add 2 bay leaves and 2 teaspoons of dried oregano.
"Jambalaya is differentiated from gumbo and étouffée by the way in which the rice is included. In these dishes, the rice is cooked separately and is served as a bed on which the main dish is served. In the usual method of preparing jambalaya, a rich stock is created from vegetables, meat, and seafood; raw rice is then added to the broth and the flavor is absorbed by the grains as the rice cooks."

I have made this twice and my family absolutely loves it. Next time I will do as some other people suggested and make the rice ahead. Also my this has really great flavor but isn't very spicy so for my heat lovers I added 1 TBSP of Original Tabasco.

This was absolutely delicious, but with one problem...I used regular long grain white rice and cooked as directed, but after 20 minutes of simmering the rice was still crunchy. Probably had to cook for as twice as long as indicated. But we loved it!!! Still not sure where I went wrong on the rice.

This is the jambalaya recipe I've always wanted. It's better than the supposed Food Network champion jambalaya. I've made this twice in two weeks. My wife and 3-year-old son also approve. As others have said, "Thank you, Bubba."  For what it's worth, my favorite variation so far includes: 1 pound shrimp meat thrown in with the chicken (1/4 pound) and sausage (12 oz. package of chicken garlic sausage). No cooked ham. The bacon is enough.

Amazing!  Sometimes I'll use turkey sausage to lower the fat and quinoa instead white rice to give more fiber and amino acids, but this is a delightful recipe. So darn good!

Excellent! I made this with limited ingredients - so I still don't know it's full potential. But with just kielbasa it's so good. My husband said this was his favorite jambalaya so far. The seasonings are scaled at the perfect amount and it's just spicy enough without completing being overpowering. Thanks so much!

Very good. To speed things up I used canned tomatoes with onions and peppers already in it. I've even used pheasant instead of chicken for a game dinner, it was a big hit. Thanks.

I've been using this recipe for years as a guide for my Jambalaya and it turns out fabulous every time.  Don't be afraid to experiment with meat ratios... I like a little extra sausage and use full size shrimp.

I made this for a large group and they all LOVED it.  I thought I would make it as written until I wrote the recipe for a friend.  1)  I cooked the rice separately with the broth and spices due to my pot being to small for the entire recipe and 2) I left out the crushed tomatoes.  Just forgot them.  I have picky eaters and even my young boys loved the leftovers.  Great recipe!  Thank you FordMan88!

Great recipe... Only changes I made were I omitted the bacon and sauteed the veggies with "I can't believe its not butter"and I didn't have any Cajun seasoning on hand so I used salt and it was GREAT!! Adding to my favorites right now THANKS :-)

Friggin Delicious! Only thing I'll do different is leave out the bacon.  Using the drippings was great, but I didn't care for the bacon itself mixed in with everything.

Dagum good! Everyone (6 of us-2 teenagers, 2 young adults and 2 real adults) loved it, even the extremely picky 16 yr old...high praise indeed. Cooked rice separately in the broths and added it in app. 10 minutes before serving and it soaked up all the rest of the lovely juices. Used andouille sausage and no shrimp since I didn't have any on hand. Everyone said they didn't miss it, but I know that it would add to an already incredible dish. I more or less doubled everything, didn't measure, just threw it in. Oh, and added some garlic, but I add that to almost everything but ice cream. Absolutely delicious.

My family REALLY enjoyed this recipe.  I cooked the rice separately & didn't add shrimp but other than that, I made it as written.  The flavor is wonderful (Spicy enough for the husband yet mild enough for my kids.). Thanks for sharing, FORDMAN88!

I've made boxed Jambalaya before so wanted to try making homemade.  This is very good and easy! I only had celery so I sauteed that in the bacon grease.  I used only beef broth and used minute brown rice.  Really tasty!  I love all the different kinds of meat in this recipe. Will make it again!

I didn't mind this recipe...I followed it to a "T"...but I thought the crushed tomatoes to be too powerful...it ended up tasting extremely tangy...I think next time I'll do less crushed tomatoes, or maybe use diced tomatoes...

My hubby says this is the best Jambalaya he has ever tasted.... wants to be sure I don't lose this recipe.  I added 1 tsp. FILE seasoning, and 1 tsp. Emeril's Bayou seasoning, and exchanged the cooked ham for "hot ham/cappicola"... it was fabulous

Pretty darned good.  Added some cayenne and Tabasco because we like it hot.  Used andouille sausage.  Simmered for 20 min. before adding rice, and as others reported, took longer than 20 min. for it to finish after that.  Took it off the stove when it got to "jambalaya consistency."  Not quite sticky, but almost.  Very nice dish.

All I can say is YUMMMMM!!  This recipe is great - and easy! Jambalaya, for some reason, was an intimidating recipe to me but this one is super easy.  I did make a few small changes...I did not have ham on hand so I omitted that and added the entire package of smoked sausage (beef) - 14 oz?  My chicken was not cooked so I chopped it into small pieces and added it a few minutes after the green peppers, onions, and celery.  I also used 1 lb. of fresh shrimp - I cooked it in a saute pan with creole seasoning, a liberal amount of cayenne pepper (we like spicy), and a little lemon juice.  After allowing 20 minutes for the rice to cook, I had to add more water and add some additional cooking time for the rice to be tender.  Next time, I will be prepared to add more broth up front - however, even the plain water did not dilute the dishes taste at all.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again!!

I absolutely adore this recipe.  It makes a ton of food which is great for me because I get two dinners instead of one out of it!  I used a rotisserie chicken from my grocery store and pulled the meat off of it for the chicken.

This was really good.  My boyfriend loves jambalaya and he always makes Zatarains, but we tried this for a change.  We used polska kielbasa, chicken and shrimp but left out the cubed ham.  He loved it and gave it five stars!

Enjoyed this one.  It is a good base recipe.  I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand so I ended up substituting.  I used a couple of TBSP of butter to saute the veggies at the start.  Also used 2 14oz cans of chicken broth (no beef broth).  As far as meat used, I doubled the sausage and shrimp.  I also added 1/2lb of small scallops 5 minutes before adding the shrimp.  As far as seasoning, I used 1 can of tomatoes with chiles and added some pepper.

Fabulous!  I did take other's advice to cook the rice separately.  I did have to tweak it a little bit based on the ingredients I had on hand, but not much, and it didn't affect the flavor.

We absolutely love this recipe! I've made it a few times and prefer andouille as the sausage and larger shrimp (31-35 ct.). As some others have suggested, I like to let it simmer for a couple of hours before adding the rice, which I do not cook ahead. Once the rice is in, you've got to give it a stir and scrape the bottom every 3-4 minutes to keep it from sticking. The consistency is perfect every time. Thank you Bubba for sharing this fantastic recipe!

Followed the recipe and had no problems with the rice! It cooked to perfection! My husband LOVED it!!! The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because it was not as flavorful as I thought it would be taste so added some black pepper which helped a little. It is still a GREAT recipe!

Loved it!  Cooked brown rice separately in 4 cups beef broth plus one cup chicken broth and also sautéed 1lb medium raw shrimp separately then added with the bacon at the end.  Also used a 14 oz package of Andouille sausage  instead of 8oz. The chicken was leftover from a rotisserie and was great in this dish.  Used a little chicken broth at the end to make it a little less thick. 
We ate half and froze the other half.  I can't wait to eat it again.

Easy to make. I did not cook the rice separately and it came out perfect. I did not add celery. Added two bay leaves , 5 cloves of garlic, 3 Serrano peppers and 3 scallions to the recipe. I also used lard instead of the bacon.

Made this last night. Perfect recipe. This is the first time I ever made my own jambalaya.  I did cook rice separately as suggested and added a small amount of flour to thicken sauce.   I used a cajun flavored sausage.  I will make it again with a different sausage. Didn't taste bad but had more if a kick than I was expecting (because of the sausage) and I love spicy.  Thank you for the recipe!!!

Good recipe, changed it up a little to suit my tastes. I used twice the sausage, (recommend andouille if you can find it), twice the ham, no chicken or shrimp, a whole green pepper, red pepper, green onions and four toes of garlic. Used another 1/4 cup of each broth and an extra 1/4 of rice. To season, some tony chacheres, cavenders greek seasoning, thyme, fresh ground pepper, and lime juice. I also brown the sausage and ham in the bacon grease before doing the vegetables. 

Comes out delicious.

I never made jambalaya before but this was great.  I served it with cornbread (made from scratch using a recipe I found on this site) and fried okra.  The recipe says to boil the uncooked rice in the pot.  Many of the comments say to cook the rice separately and then add to the pot, which is what I did.  It came out great, but I think it would have been better to just cook the rice in the jambalaya because then it would have soaked up the broth.  Also, adding the frozen okra to the pot 5 minutes before serving was an excellent touch.

This jambalaya recipe is great. I've made it twice now. The first time I cooked the rice separately based on the other reviews but I forgot to adjust the liquid in the recipe so it was soupy. The second time I cooked the rice with it and it was perfect! If you're going to cook the rice separately make sure you adjust the liquid in the recipe in order to get the right consistency.

Excellent and very tasty. 2 cups of rice is too much making the dish too thick. I will make with 1 1/2 cups of rice next time.

This was so good and so easy to make.
I didn't have any ham, but used canadian bacon.
I had some andouille sausage which made it perfect.

Amazing!  I used red and yellow peppers instead of green, and only chicken stock, but otherwise followed the recipe and it turned out wonderful.

Bubba, this is the only kind of jambalaya I will ever make.  It is spicy, full of flavours and I have never changed a thing.  I would give this a million stars if I could.   I have even given the recipe to friends...... An awesome dinner awaits anyone who makes this; and that is me tonight!  Thanks so much for this one!

This was absolutley amazing! I'd always been scared to try Jumbalaya, I thought too many ingredients, too many steps, and too long to make. I was wrong!! I did everything to a tee and it came out great.  The only thing I did different was use Smoked Turkey Sausage, and instant brown rice instead (I'm horrible at rice!!) Everything came out so good, I simmered it for about 2 hours, but honestly the flavors were so good it'd be good at 20 minutes as the recipe said (if you are short on time) 
Also, I had to keep some extra stock / tomato sauce ready because that instant rice just sucked up all the liquid. No biggie, just a word of warning if someone else wants to use brown rice.

This is delicious - and very filling. I did not have any bacon, so I used canola oil to fry up my veggies with in the beginning and added a little liquid smoke to the dish for the smoky flavor. I also left out the chicken and only used kielbasa and shrimp. Served with cornbread. So good!

Unlike many of the reviews I read, I cooked the rice in the pot as directed and it turned out great.  The medium grain rice I used didn't stick to the bottom (I stirred it every few minutes) and cooked up nice and plump in about 20 minutes. How are people cooking it separately and still getting the jambalaya thick enough since the rice absorbs most of the liquid? The only change I made was that I subbed 1 tsp celery seed for the celery since I didn't have it on hand.  Follow the directions and you'll end up with a great supper.

Delicious. As I was cooking I was afraid there weren't enough spices  so I added minced garlic to the veggies when  cooking those. I added a dash of chili pepper and tumeric. It might not have needed it so i didnt put much so as not to ruin the recipe, but it was devine. Very flavorful and nice and spicey. I also did the andjoui (sp) and my market had a cajaun sausage so I figured that would go well too. i deskinned them and made little balls.  I also cooked the rice seperate in my rice cooker and did a little less water so it was slighlty undercooked. Cause i still wanted the rice to soak up all those flavors. Then I added it to the simmering pot (let some of the liquid cook down since rice was almost done) simmered that for 10 mins then added my raw shrimp simmered 5 and the bacon on top.  This recipe is so good, i could barely wait for it to cool off to eat !!! Hubby loves it!!.  (Also it took me more like almost 2hrs because i chopped everything fresh and cooked all my meats first.)

This was very delicious and easy to make.  I made a big double batch and gave 1/2 away to another family, they loved it!  Im used to my dads recipe which is a bit sweeter and not so savory.  I will probably alternate between this one and my dads, depending on what I have on hand.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a great and flavorful recipe.  I didn't follow exact.  I made my own Creole Spice, I used Kielbassa, Italian Sausage, & Shrimp cause that is all I had on hand.  Next time I will use the Bacon, Smoked Sausage and Chicken with the Shrimp.  I let the Sauce simmer for almost 6hrs.  I started it at 12 and finished with the rice & shrimp @ 6pm.  I tasted the sauce before adding the rice and it needed just a smidge more salt.  Everyone loved it and I will definitely make it again.

It's alright, you'll get a decent jambalaya from this recipe.  I thought the rice to meat/veg ratio rather high, might make it with less rice.  Even after adding garlic and seasonings, it seems to be missing something.  Husband likes it (he's Australian and not from the south..) and he stirred through a few handfuls of steamed shrimp.

My husband and I absolutely love jambalaya.  We used to buy the boxed mix, and I've recently been obsessed with making these things myself instead to control the ingredients.  I admit, I had doubts on how this would turn out.  I shouldn't have, because it is FANTASTIC.  I did make a few changes, I omitted the celery and replaced the green bell pepper with a red.  I also did not add ham or shrimp.  My husband and I both were just so in love with how this turned out, it's a regular staple in our home!

Great recipie. I didn't follow it to the letter but it was a great jump off for me.  I added a red pepper,  garlic and  jalpeno to my veggie mixture. I cooked it with the broths and the tomotates (ALTHOUGH I DESPISE THEM) I let that simmer really low for 3 hours so the flavors would truly come through. I used Tony chachere's seasoning sparingly since the flavor was truly already there. I used chicken shrimp and andoullie sausages for my meats. I cooked my rice seprate though. IT WAS A HIT!! it had a good spicyness that wasn't a killer those that got to taste it loved. Only complaints: It didnt' have corn or okra in it. I can take that as the only critique. Thanks Bubba

This was my first attempt at making jambalaya.  I was nervous to try one that seemed "simplified", but the list of ingredients wasn't overwhelming, so I gave it a try----and boy am I glad I did!  It makes a huge batch, so my husband and I had TONS of leftovers, but my husband ate them all!!!  (which says a lot for this recipe, because he doesn't like leftovers!)  I think I would add a bit more cajun seasoning...only because we like things pretty spicy, and this was a bit bland for us.  Also--I think next time I'll leave out the shrimp to make it more cost efficient.

This was came out great.  I did use brown rice cooked right in the mixture, grabbed a small can of canned chicken to save a little time, used a large can of diced tomatoes, and cooked on low in a 6 qt kettle for a couple of hours.  I then took it to a potluck right in my kettle.  I was impressed with the flavor and will make it again.  Thanks so much!

This might be my new favorite recipe!  It just so happened that I had needed to use up some shrimp and some kielbasa so this was perfect.  I followed the recipe pretty closely which is unusual for me.  The only changes I made were 1.  I left out the celery because I dont like cooked celery.  2.  I left out the ham because I didnt have any.  3.  I added a few shakes of Franks Red Hot before serving.  The dish was very tasty without it, but I was craving the heat.  I was most surprised how thick and creamy it was!  I dumped generic long grain white rice right into the pot, boiled it for 10 minutes and then shut off the stove and in 30 minutes it was like creole risotto!  YUM!

This was great!  I made a few changes for us.  To make it healtier I used brown rice and turkey sausage; I used stewed tomatoes and pureed half of them; I simmered a chicken breast in chicken broth and the added that broth to the cooking pot.  It all came together beautifully and the rice was perfect (there was no sticking to the bottom of the pan).  I will make this again, maybe even for company.  Thank you Fordman88 for a tasty tasty dish!

My family enjoyed it. Very flavorful. I just returned from New Orleans and had some there...and mine tasted pretty close. I kept the chicken and shrimp (regular or jumbo instead of salad shrimp) but used turkey bacon , turkey ham and chicken andouille instead of the pork. Used all chicken stock/broth. Added 2 tsps of worcestershire sauce and fresh garlic.  The seasonings were fine (I added a tinge more cajun seasoning).

In my original review in 2010, I rated this 4 stars and stated "This was tasty, but had more of a tomato base than I was expecting."  I've made this dozens of times since then, changing the crushed tomatoes to diced tomatoes and it made all the difference.  This is  always a big hit now and definitely worth 5 stars.  Love that it is so easy to throw together!

Just made this Jambalaya.  In fact my empty bowl is still beside me!  I am not sure why more people didn't give it a five.  I followed the recipe almost as is.  The only change I made was omitting the ham, since we don't eat it.  I just used a little extra sausage.  Otherwise I made it just as Bubba advised.  I was a little skeptical about if the uncooked amount of rice not being enough to fill up stew.  But the ratio of rice to stew is perfect.  Just like 'Nawlins!  I used Aidell's cajun andouille sausage (grocery store), turkey bacon, and large gulf shrimp instead of salad shrimp.  I suggest you McCormicks cajun seasoning with brown top, small bottle (Zatarain's is too salty for me) and use good rice like Uncle Ben's. I served with Haiwaiin sweet rolls to offset the spicy nature of jambalaya.  Lastly,  use extra shrimp b/c they are always the first to go!

My husband is a jambalaya lover and doesn't give compliments out unless the food is over the top.  He said he has never had a better jambalaya!  I gave it four stars because I did need to "kick it up"  by using 2 1/2 times the amount of spices listed and even still it wasn't too spicy.  (I don't like my food very hot and it was perfect for me.) I also used Andoulle sausage, but precooked it and drained it well so the fat content was reduced.  I used lean ham, chicken breasts and as lean of bacon as possible to be a bit more heart-healthy.  I also used larger shrimp as they have better taste than the tiny salad shrimp.

This was awesome! I read the reviews and made some changes. I didn't have ham. I used regular smoked sausage. Instead of Cajun spices, I used 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper, 1/4 tsp hot salt, 1 Tbs Thyme, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp minced garlic, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp seasoned salt, and 1/8 tsp cumin. I fried bacon and removed it from pan, in the bacon drippings I sauteed a full diced onion. In medium size pot I boiled 4 cups of water and dropped in 2 beef bullion cubes, and 2 chicken cubes to boil together. Once broth was boiling, I added a large can of crushed tomatoes, the sauteed onions, some fresh sliced mushrooms, the diced bacon and seasoning. I sauteed the diced chicken and added it to the mix. Then I diced and added the sausage, the diced shrimp, and then some wide egg noodles instead of rice. This was so good I can't wait to make it for family and friends. Thanks for the keeper!

We have made this over 10 times now. We used to use the store bought box, but we had an abundance of rice we were trying to use up the first time we tried this. Obviously, since we have made it many more times we enjoyed it! We make it exactly as listed (but omit the bacon). I find that it is an extra step and I don't always have bacon on hand. It is just as good without it, and I kind of think bacon seems odd in Jambalaya anyway. Tonight when I made it I realized my celery was bad so I didn't have any. I substituted approx. 1 tsp. of celery seed instead since that is all I had. When I got a taste of the celery seed it was pretty good, but it definitely seemed lacking to me without the celery so don't skip that! Will continue to make as my husband from Louisiana loves it...his comfort food!

This was my first time making Jambalaya. It so so good ! I had only chicken broth to use, and I substituted crab meat for shrimp ( we prefer crab ) which I garnished each bowl along with the crumbled bacon right before serving. I think this made a beautiful presentation. Crabmeat stayed in tacked and bacon stayed crispy. I didn't use rice like traditional Jambalaya, instead I used Orzo because thay was what wanted to use up in my pantry. Actually, worked well because orzo stays in shape amongst all that stirring.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. I did make a few changes but as a whole this recipe had a lot of flavor and we really enjoyed it. I sprinkled some boneless chicken breasts with creole seasoning browned them then cubed them.  I cooked the rice separately and mixed it all together at the end to keep the rice from getting too starchy and added raw shrimp during the last ten minutes. The Andouille sausage and the bacon give this jambalaya such a good flavor!  Thanks for the recipe.

I skipped the bacon and sauteed the meats first, drained some fat, then added the veges and some fresh garlic to that and cooked a few minutes, then added cajun stewed tomatoes, the broth & rice.  Used the creole seasoning recipe from this site in lieu of the "cajun seasoning" and thyme called for here; added some hot sauce and 2 bay leaves; threw in some frozen shrimp at the end & let it sit for 10 min's or so before serving.  Awesome.

Last Christmas we got some of those sausage and cheese gift sets that people buy when they don't know what to get you for Christmas.  :-|  We find the sausage in those to be downright nasty --- so fatty and yucky.  My daughter had the idea that maybe I could make jambalaya with it.  I found this recipe and made jambalaya for the first time ever.

It was fabulous and everyone here just raved about it.  It did take a long time to make but I am admittedly a slow cook.  I cut up that Christmas-gift sausage and browned it in a pan first before adding it to the recipe.  I also used turkey bacon.  Other than that I think I followed the recipe exactly.  

Great taste, plenty of leftovers and a very happy family!  Oh and I know I can truly be happy if I see one of those Christmas-gift sausages again this year.  :)

Oh my goodness, so incredibly good! This recipe makes a ton, so make sure you're feeding a group. It was just hubby and I, so we're gonna be eating leftovers for a few days. Not that we mind too much however. I did omit the shrimp since hubby hates it. I made it early in the afternoon and let it simmer for about five hours, before I added the rice. I did have to add four more cups of broth before adding the rice.  I may actually go and sneak some leftovers right now.

This was better & simpler than I expected! I added a touch of brown sugar while tasting to remove some of the tanginess from the tomatoes at the end. I used a spicy, smoked Portuguese sausage which gave the right amount of spiciness since we eat more spicy in our house. I will try to add less liquid next time, since I prefer it to be a little thicker sauce. I didn't cook the rice in the sauce to control the flavoring & texture of the sauce.

This recipe is excellent and very easy to prepare. I would advise against using frozen shrimp as it added a "fishy" backround to the taste. Overall it is a very hearty meal and the leftovers are great.

Really good but it came out so thick.  I'm told this is how jambalaya is supposed to be.  Don't make the mistake I did - I attempted to make it in the slow cooker to save time later in the day.  The rice did not want to soften so I ended up putting it on the stove top.  I had to stir it A LOT because it kept sticking to the bottom of the pan.  I then put it back in the slow cooker on low to keep warm.  It tasted fine but the rice turned out a bit gummy.  Next time, I'll stick right to the recipe.  I would maybe cut back on the rice just a little.

This recipe has quickly become one of my favorites, not only because my family loves it, but because it is fun and pretty easy to make.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful, but I am one of those that likes to experiment a little, so I tried a few adjustments.  The only changes I like better than what is written are:  in step 2 omit the cajun seasoning and thyme and add 1 tsp basil, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1 bay leaf and hot sauce (like tobasco) to taste - my family likes about a 1/4 to a 1/2 tsp in the recipe.  (I also put the bottle on the table when serving.)  I also prefer this with larger pieces of meat so I cut everything big and buy the larger sized cooked shrimp. (I also don't worry too much about adding the ham if I don't have it on hand, because the bacon and smoked sausage/kielbasa type meat are so similar in flavor.) I also have to admit the way I am accustomed to eating Jambalaya is to put a slice of cornbread in the bowl first and then spoon the Jambalaya over the top.  So good! Would highly recommend this recipe either way you choose to make it.

This was really good. I made a few changes though. I didnt have pre-cooked chicken so i cooked some chicken with the bacon. Also, I didn't use ham or shrimp, just the chicken, bacon and 1 lb of kielbasa. And I used 1 28 oz can diced tomatoes instead of the 2 cans crushed. It made alot and it was a good meal.

We are definitely making this for the party and on other days too.     I love and appreciate the recipe conversion.
Thanks....

I made this with the only exception is making the rice separate. It was OMG delicious. I’m going out of town and my husband asked me to freeze some so he can have it while I’m gone. One of my favorite All Recipes recipes!

Excellent!  I altered  to use what I had on hand. I sauteed peppers/onion in bacon grease.  Per other reviews I added one jalapeno for more kick. I used 2 chicken thighs, half a smoked sausage and only 1 can of diced tomatoes, splash of worcestershire sauce and a few shakes of Tabasco. I think using the one can of diced tomatoes prevented the rice from getting mushy. Will definitely make again!

Like everyone else, I changed the original recipe slightly. Everyone has a different cooking method and favorite go-to seasonings. Being an experienced cook makes substitutions much easier when you don't have the money, time, or care to buy every single ingredient. That being said, if you follow the recipe to a T, it is still amazing! I will offer some slight advice since most reviews that I've seen have made changes to the rice mostly because, let's be honest, rice can be intimidating. My advice is, one, use a very nice nonstick pot that you know you won't have issues with sticking if you leave it alone. Second, I've found that the more you stir your rice the more likely you will have a mushy mess. Simply add your rice, stir just enough to separate/coat, cover, cook for 10min, fluff rice just enough to separate/coat, cover and cook 10 more minutes! Voila! My favorite rice is mahatma jasmine.

My family loved this recipe!  Fortunately, I didn't have the problem with the rice that others reviewing this recipe had (I was nervous about it since I was preparing it for the 1st time for guests).  The only changes i made:  I omitted the ham & I drained the vegies of the excess bacon drippings (& there was alot!) after cooking.  And, I used frozen cooked jumbo shrimp cut in pieces & defrosted prior to adding it to the pot.  
Delicious!  Will definitely serve this again!

I added a lot more Cajun seasoning we like it spicy, threw some garlic in there salt and peppered the veggies and used uncooked bigger shrimp. I put the shrimp in at the end cooks very fast... I made the rice separately in my rice cooker and it was great spooned over the rice! It was my first time making this and it was very simple and easy took about an hour! The house smells amazing! Thanks for such a easy yummy recipe

This is a great recipe. It's easy to make, tastes fantastic and you can tweak it 100 different ways if you like. We really enjoy the current recipe, so we don't mess with it other than to adjust the quantities to be appropriate for the mouths we plan to feed.

Solid recipe. People with rice problems need to wash there rice and try lower starch varietals. I also leave out the ham, but that's just me.

This is a great base recipe to take advantage of what you have on hand or in the freezer. I used Johnsonville Polish sausage, carrots instead of green pepper, left out the ham, added minced garlic and used diced canned tomatoes with juice, and all chicken broth. I also used chili powder as I didn't have cajun spice. My husband, who doesn't usually like rice, declared it delicious and asked me to make it again!

try without bacon grease & use coconut oil instead. Left ham out. Only used 1 can beef broth. Served rice separately. Used 1 jar of granny's canned tomatoes. Used a 2 lb bag of jumbo shrimp from SAMs with tails removed and thawed.

Everything worked out really well...the only problem I had was there wasn't enough liquid. The rice wasn't cooked after the timer went off and most of the liquid was already absorbed. I added 1.5 cups of water and let it simmer an additional 15 minutes.

I thought this was really tasty, and more importantly, my picky 6 year old did as well! I used kielbasa and chicken, and since I didn't have any crushed tomatoes on hand, I used 1 can of diced, and 1 can of sauce. It was creamy and delicious! I did take a reviewers advice of stirring the rice, and I'm glad I did. I think it would have been glued to the bottom of the pan if I had not. Will definitely be adding this to the dinner rotation. Side note: the recipe as is, is not spicy at all. If I were making this only for adults, I'd definitely add a little more heat.

This recipe is fantastic! Great flavor!  I cooked the rice just as the recipe directed and it was fine, I stirred it after 20 minutes and it needed a few extra minutes and the texture was perfect.  It wasn't mushy or clumpy as some other reviewers have described.  Maybe they used minute rice.  Overall a very tasty and satisfying meal. Thanks!

Took a while due to all the chopping needed. You should probably chop up at least the vegetables if not the meat as well before you start the bacon, since the veggies cook fast. For me I cut out the shrimp and doubled the sausage instead and it was still  tasty

Delicious! Made lots and can be kicked up a notch by adding more Cajun seasoning but I don't like spicy so I kept to the amount called for and had no problem. The only thing I did use different was diced tomatoes instead of crushed.

Bubba, you Creole genius!  This is, hands down, the best jambalaya I've ever had.  I deviated only in the number of portions, and now I wish I had made 12 instead of 6.  This will be a regular in my house.

Scaled the recipe to 6 servings, cooked the rice before adding it to the recipe, used 2 cups of each of the ham, sausage, chicken and shrimp. Will absolutely make again, this was delicious!

Great and easy!  Didn't have fresh peppers so used a frozen bag of sliced peppers and onions. Sautéed them with garlic and extra Cajun seasoning before adding to mix. Followed other recommendations and did not add the rice but cooked it separately, made it with half water and half chicken stock to add a little extra flavor. As I am allergic to shellfish, I used bulk pork sausage (whole pound) and chicken with the bacon. It was delicious!  My husband said it was better than the jambalaya so we had in New Orleans!  Of course the Cajun seasoning was one I bought when we were there !

This turned out great. Complement getter. I didn't change a thing except for tasting and adjusting my preference for seasonings. Oh, ya, I decreased the amount of bacon grease by half and replaced it with olive oil for health reasons. My first review, it had to be this one cause it was easy and so good

My first ever attempt at jambalaya and it was awesome! I skipped the chicken and diced some fresh tomato instead of canned tomato. I used bouillon cubes for the broth and slap ya mama Cajun seasoning. I added a bit of shredded cheese to my personal serving and next time will simply add some corn bread. My girlfriend and I absolutely loved this dish. Thank you!

We don't eat pork so I changed the meats a bit. Used beef sausage, 1 lb. of chicken breasts, 1 lb. of medium shrimp and some lump crab. Used extra creole seasoning and an extra half cup of rice to avoid sogginess. Very good template. Friends loved it. Will make again and experiment more with the meats and seasoning.

This was fantastic.  I like a little thicker jambalaya so I used 4 cans of broth, 2 beef, 2 chicken, and 3 cups of rice.  Also added 1teaspoon cayanne pepper.

Thank you Bubba!  My husband and I loved it. Had it for dinner tonight.   Used 1/2 tsp garlic powder; 1 tsp pepper;  1/2 tsp paprika; and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper for the spices.   Even added large raw shrimp with the rice at the end.

Great recipe. I used brown sugar ham and spiced the chicken prior to adding it to the mix. I also used turkey hot Italian sausage because I'm a dork. I also added crashed red pepper and hot paprika.

I tried this recipe for the first time last night, and my husband and I both declared it a keeper from the first bite!  Changes I made: turkey bacon, no ham, 1 lb chicken, turkey sausage, petite diced tomatoes, 4 c chicken broth, no beef broth, no shrimp and added some minced garlic.  I was concerned about adding the rice at the end due to other reviews, but it worked out great!  The stirring seems to be the key, especially within the first few minutes.  The Cajun spice I use is made by Weber, and 2 t was just enough.  My husband usually puts extra hot sauce on stuff, but didn't with this recipe.  We agreed that it's just enough spice for us, but would probably be too much for most kids or those who don't love spicy foods, so you might want to cut back on the spice in the beginning and add more later if desired.  Thanks for sharing Bubba's recipe, FORDMAN88!  We love it!

you have no idea how good this stuff is. My wife and I were eating this for days and I still want more of it. The only unfortunate part is that I have to add shrimp separately because my little lady doesn't like it, but I make this in my cast iron dutch oven over a wood fire, and I'll likely not ever use a different recipe.

Excellent and easy! Followed recipe exactly, except used wild rice and cooked it separately until the last 20 minutes. Then I added the rice to the soup and finished cooking. Next time, I will decrease the rice by 1/3 while increasing the meat and shrimp by 1/3-1/2 ... I guess I would rather have more meat and shrimp than rice ...But the recipe is great without any changes!

This is a great recipe and super easy! With all the liquid it's more of a gumbo/soup type thing than jambalaya, though. I kept the rice separate and scooped up some meat with just a little sauce to eat it as more of a jambalaya. You could also just ladle some up and eat it as a soup! Yummy either way!

Never had homemade Jambalaya before and I thought this was very good, just enough spice and not too much heat. Plan to make to make this often.

Wow, this was great!!  I've never made Jambalaya before and I also rarely give a recipe a 5 star rating but this was completely deserving.  I made it pretty much as directed but used no ham, added 1 tsp oregano, 1 bay leaf, added a pinch of red pepper flakes and probably quite a bit more cajun seasoning (discovered Tony Cashere's creole seasoning... WOW, so much better than the generic cajun seasoning I've been using.) After reading some of the reviews, I cooked the rice separately.  Use all of the crushed tomatoe...so good. Thank you for the post!

Bubba, you rock!! I was catering a party for about 60 people, and needed a recipe to feed the masses. I came across yours and gave it a try. Bless you, Bubba, my guests RAVED!!

Made a few changes with the ingredients I had-- I substituted kielbasa for andouille, skipped the bacon and ham and doubled the chicken and shrimp. Also used red and yellow peppers along with the green and used my own Cajun seasoning made from scratch. 

Best compliment of the night-- "I'm from East Texas, and this jambalaya is as good as anything I've had in those parts." I blushed and giggled-- not bad for a girl from Milwaukee, WI, lol.

I liked this dish, but my son & husband did not although they said it was okay with magi or soy sauce. I instinctively reduced the amount of rice by half and recommend this if you like a little "sauce" to dip French bread in. The juice is very good to me.

Loved it.  I also cooked rice seperately.  Everything turned out amazing.  Next time I'll leave out the ham as I feel it's pretty unneeded. I also added some cayenne pepper to the whole dish to kick it up and then added some naja jolokia sauce to my own bowl.  Served with buttered corn bread.

Excellent! I used Kiebasa, raw shrimp and chicken, not having any ham around. I put the vegies in with bacon about half way through cooking and left the bacon in throughout. Worked great and will do so again. Preferred cajun seasoning is now the Louisiana Crab & Shrimp Boil! Wow! A couple tablespoons really snapped it up. No need for Andoulli sausage then. Will definitely make this again!

I loved it! I made a few modifications. I added 2 jalapeno peppers to the recipe. I doubled up on the spice as well as added 2 pinches of chili powder. I also marinated the chicken in olive oil and Cajun seasoning for 20 minutes before frying up. I used mild Italian sausage as well. It was so delicious I had no left overs.

So here I've been rating recipes and writing a novel as future reference for myself and they haven't been saving!!!  Anyway my boyfriend rated this a 10.5 so he absolutely loved it. I made it late last night and didn't have some of the ingredients so I simply left them out, such as celery, sausage, And couldn't believe it But I ALWAYS have cajun seasoning, Last night I couldn't find it anywhere!!! Thank God this site had a wonderful recipe, "Simple Cajun Seasoning"

I have made this recipe several times.  LOVE it!  My family always gives rave reviews!  I always double the amount of crushed tomatoes.  Like other users, I make the rice seperatly and mix the wet ingrediants with the rice then serve it.

Awesome recipe. I used lots of shrimp and sausage and omitted the beef broth though. It turned out fabulous and the family just wiped it out. I am making it again at the ardent requests of my children.

Very tasty.  Very easy to make:  no skill required.  This is a large recipe and you will be eating this all week if you did not invite a lot of friends to share it.  Better eaten immediately because leftovers will turn solid after a while.

We received this from a friend right after we had our son, and loved it so much we got the recipe! It's on the monthly calendar now and always comes out great. We usually omit the ham and add a splash of liquid smoke, but otherwise keep it the same.

Really like this a lot. Made it exactly to the recipe except I didn't have beef broth so used double chicken broth. Family loved it but felt like it just needed something small in the finish like cilantro? Need to figure it out but it was otherwise awesome!

This recipe was AWESOME!!! Such a hit with everyone that I made it for and it is even easy to not add the shrimp (just in case someone doesn't eat seafood)!!! I used "Tony's Creole Seasoning" and just added it until it tasted right! Would 100% recommend this recipe to ANYONE!!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!! 
I used eight strips of bacon instead of six (because I had eight left and didn't want to leave teo in the refrig).
I added 5 cloves of garlic to the vegetables. 
I used all chicken stock (because I like chicken flavor best).
I used no ham but extra of all the other meats.  Too delicious!! Will be making this agin this weekend!  
Thanks FORDMAN88

This was a hit with our family.  The only modifications I made were that I did not have any bacon so I left out that step and just cooked the veggies in olive oil and I also did not have ham, so I just let that out.  But the end result was fantastic and everyone really enjoyed it!

De-lish!  My kids who are 7 and 3 even ate it and my hubby lived it as well!  I made just a couple changes as I didnt have all the ingredients.  I used turkey kielbasa, cubed cooked ham and salad shrimp that I added after I threw in the celery and red pepper.  I doubled the chicken broth since I didn't have beef and added a little bit of tomato soup.  Once that came to a boil I added zararans rice...man, what great flavor!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for the 2012 championship LSU - Alabama Game for 40 people.  It was great with Cajun sausage, shrimp and chicken thighs and a little rice. I used Cajun spice - it came out perfect, not too hot but with just a little heat.

yum!  I had made Jambalaya from a prepackaged mix before but wanted to try it from scratch.  This recipe was wonderful!  easy to make and it I made it using frozen leftovers from Christmas (turkey & ham).  I also had some bacon and italian sausage on hand.  Didn't top with shrimp (as much as I'd have liked to) since we have a shellfish allergy in the family.  I can see this becoming a good New Year's Eve dinner, as well as a good one when friends are over.

Also - I halved the recipe (so 6 servings) for our family of 4, and it did 4 dinners (3 teen/adult size and 1 child size) and 2 smallish lunches....  Just something to be aware of as I wouldn't say halving the recipe is 6 servings unless it's also served with a side and/or veggies.

After holiday recipe which takes leftovers and turns it into a dish that's nothing like traditional holiday fare. My entire extended family loved it!  The sausage had come in gift boxes. Bacon leftover from breakfasts. Ham and turkey were of course on hand and I make my own broths from daily cooking so this was a snap and economical too.  I pulled wild caught shrimp from the freezer and boom done!  So good!

This was fantastic!  Added garlic with the onions,added a handful of frozen okra with the chicken, and added fresh crab with the shrimp.  I let the sauce simmer for a few hours before adding the rice and seafood.  Daaaaang!  Nobody could have just one serving!

This was very good. I did cook the rice separately in the 2 cups of broth. I used olive oil instead of bacon & drippings. I didn't have celery or pepper and left out the ham. Still excellent as is. I used medium sized shrimp.

Today is Fat Tuesday so decided to make Jambalaya for the first time.  Compared a few other recipes to this one, including one of Emeril's.  Have to say, this recipe was awesome.  Easy to prepare and everyone loved it.  I cut the portion of bacon in half as well as the tomatoes and rice (adjusted the broth for the amount of rice).  I used whole large shrimp.  Easily served four hearty appetites for dinner with leftovers for lunch.  Wish I had tried this before....definitely a keeper.

Came out yummy! For the cooked chicken, I tore up a rotisserie chicken and used that. No ham, shrimp or thyme on hand, so those ingredients were omitted. I also used 2 cans of Rotel diced tomatoes instead of the crushed tomatoes. I like it spicy, so I used one original Rotel and the other one Hot. The 2 cups of uncooked rice seemed to be too much, next time I will use maybe a cup and half. A great recipe, thanks for sharing!

It tastes as good as it does in New Orleans.  I did not use bacon.  Instead, I browned 1 lb of chicken and 1 lb of kielbasa.  Sat that aside and sauteed my vegies in the same pot.  I also used diced tomotoes with chipotle.  It kicks the recipe up a  little bit.  My husband hates green bell peppers.  So I used a red pepper.  It was even better the next day.

I have never made Jambalaya before and this turned out great.  I used a yellow bell pepper instead of green and left out chicken (none on hand).  I also did a little less Cajun seasoning (I'm a lightweight when it comes to spice).  I probably did about 1 1/2 tsp.  It still had a little kick to it.  My husband also really liked it and scraped his plate!!!!  Freezing the leftovers to have again next week!  So delicious!

Really good recipe. I added a lot of meat, chicken, shrimp and sausage probably double the recipe and it turned out awesome. Thanks!

Excellent, easy, and very tasty!!!  Very easy to suite to anyone's tastes.  Add whatever you like, take out what you do not.  Make it as spicy as you like.  I didn't change a thing which I think is very important if you plan to rate and review a recipe.

I prepared this meal for the first time 10/23/2010.  We wanted something different and with the weather changing I thought this would be a great recipe to try.  WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!!  I was truly amazed that something with so much broth in it would taste NOTHING LIKE BROTH.  It was great.  I followed the recipe to the letter (except for the bacon) but added a few things of my own.  I used keilbasa (i spelled it incorrectly) sausage and I added some crabe meat and a can of Rotel for a little kick. I used more than the required cajun seasoning and I added some Old Bay as well.  I also (as others have done) cooked my rice prior to cooking the Jambalaya.  It was absoulutely wonderful.  I believe I will delete the chicken next time, add okra and make some of my great chicken flavored brown rice for some extra flavor.  A great recipe and very easy to follow.  I will DEFINITELY be making this one again.

I actually give this about a three and a half. There is definitely WAY too much tomato. I would consider cutting the tomato amount in half actually. I also had to add a alot of seasoning and hot sauce. However, I did not use bacon or ham since we do not eat that. So maybe it is better with those two things. I will probobly try this again, but I will cut back on the tomato.

excellent recipe!  I used turkey bacon instead of regular, so I had to add a little olive oil to the pan to cook the bacon.  Substituted a red pepper for the green pepper, and used kielbasa instead of the sausage.  It came out delicious!  Served it with cheese bread.

This was great! I just made it about 15 minutes ago, and I don't know if its gonna make it until my husband gets home. YUM! I used andouille sausage Zatarain's creole seasoning, and left out the ham, but otherwise followed the recipe. SUPERB!

All I can say is WOW!!!!  I omitted the ham because my girlfriend isn't a lover of ham so I increased the sausage and shrimp.  I also put in only one can of tomatoes.  I used a little more broth to make it not so dry.  I used minute rice and took it off the heat when I added it.  I let it sit for about 10 minutes and it was ready.  Make sure you have plenty of liquid if you mix in the rice or it will come out very thick.  This dish has so much flavor it's unreal.  It was super easy as well.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is my first time making Jambalaya and I must not be a fan because everyone else liked this except me.  I am wondering if it is the cajun seasoning I used (Emeril's Bayou Blast).  Thank you for sharing your recipe Fordman!

Thank you I made this for Father's Day at a Assisted Living Village I work at and they loved it.  Made it for 36 and it turned out perfect.  Followed the directions to a tee except for the thyme which I omitted and could not have asked for anything better.  All the men said it was the best they had ever had.  Again thank you for making this day such a big hit.  This is a for sure keeper and will make it at home and for more gatherings.

Excellent flavour, dead easy.  Made it pretty much as written except without the bacon or shrimp (I had neither).  Perfect for my husband's palate, who doesn't like overly spicy food.  I added hot sauce to mine!  Great recipe, customizable in a hundred different ways, depending on what's in your fridge.  A keeper!

awesome recipe. I used a low sodium chicken broth and left out the ham.  I also used brown basmati rice which made the simmering time a little longer but well worth it.  Everything turned out so well that I couldn't stop eating it. This is definately the recipe I will use for our offices' cajun theme luncheon in May.  I will update then but I know they will love it as much as I do. Thanks for sharing Bubba. Definately a keeper.

This was my first time making jambalaya and thanks to this great recipe I will make it again and again. While very tasty it could have used a bit more "ting" to it. I will be sure to add a bit of cayanne pepper next time.

I had to replace the seasoning with krazysalt + paprika+ cayenne+garlic powder, but it still worked! Cajun and old bay is impossible to find in Tokyo. I omitted the ham since I didn't have any. Awesome dish!!

We really enjoyed this...great comfort food.  I cooked the bacon in a cast iron skillet.  Then I drained the excess grease and used the pan to saute the onions and peppers.  I added back about a 1/2 - 1 tsp of bacon grease.  Then I put the vegs into a large pot and added the ingredients as directed.  I did not have any celery so I used a 1/2 tsp of celery seed.  I omitted the ham and doubled the sausage. I  used the smoked andouille chicken sausage from Trader Joe's.  Instead of salad shrimp I used raw jumbo shrimp that I cut in half.  Unless you want more of a stew, I don't know why you would cook the rice separately as some reviewers recommend.  The liquid to rice ratio was perfect.  This recipe will become a staple.  It was really easy to make.

I liked this recipe but I had to make some changes to it because of my families distaste for seafood.  I left out the shrimp and I forgot to pick up ham and crushed tomato so I used 1 lb of andouille sausage and a little over a pound of chicken and 2 cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes.  I also had run out of beef broth so I used 4 cups of chicken stock instead.  We also used penne instead of rice and reduced the simmer time accordingly.  Overall, it had great flavor and it's an easy recipe to make changes to according to personal tastes.  It tastes even better the next day.

This is really good, but I did change a few things. First I only used 1 can of diced tomatoes, left out the shrimp, and ham.  Also since I didn't have any beef broth I used 4 cups of chicken broth.  The next time I make it I think I will make the rice separate and add  at the end.

This dish only takes 45 minutes!   It filled up my large cast iron cooking pot which I later transferred to my crock pot to take into an office potluck.  The only cooking I really did was the rice and bacon (other meats outsourced from the fine Boars Head brand in the supermarket deli).  Be sure to buy "Andouille" sausage.  In my case I can recommend Bruce Aidells brand cajun style smoked pork sausage.  The entire pot was emptied and all my co-workers have the easy to follow recipe for their kitchens now too!

LOVED this recipe.  Have never made jambalaya before.  This was easy and very tasty.  I read a view of the reviews that said it was a bit bland, so I added a few of my own touches.  For the sausage, I used andouille, so it was very flavorful and spicy.  Also, I used cut up chicken breast seasoned with the cajun seasoning.  I dusted it with the seasoning before I pan sauteed it.  Once both of these were added to the mix, a lot of extra flavor went with them.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and was very happy with the results.

Made this New Year's Eve and it was a big hit with the family.  I didn't have chicken so I just added more ham, sausage, and shrimp. I doubled the recipe for the party and had a big bowl of rice and hot sauce on the side so that people could customize their servings.

Deeeeeeeeeeeeelish!!  Made this last night and it was beyond fantastic.  I used some leftover frozen crawfish tails and some left over turkey instead of shrimp and chicken.  Really tasty.  My 4 year old gobbled it right up and asked for seconds :)

Just found and made this recipe today.  I used a Honey Baked ham bone to get the ham, used the boil water from the ham bone instead of beef broth, and skipped the bacon.  Turned out delicious.

I used 1lb of shimp instead of chicken and ham and 1lb of hot Italian sausage. This came out a bit spicy but we liked it quite a bit!  I also let the sauce simmer a lot longer since my homemade shrimp stock was frozen.   We love seafood; oh and I didn't forget the bacon!   Thanks for the delicious recipe. :)

I didn't care for this dish, not enough flavor, tasted like tomato sauce and rice.

I think this is a fine dish for a weeknight, but if you're looking for an authentic, slow-cooked flavor then this isn't for you.  I don't think I'd make it again.

This was a wonderful recipe! Both my husband and I loved it! We did change a couple of things: I added about 5 cloves chopped garlic, 1/2 more tsps of cajun seasoning, 1 tsp cayanne and then my husband wanted to try it with Orzo instead of rice like one of our fav. restaurants, so we did. It turned out really good. I cooked everything except the orzo, and shrimp for about 45 minutes and then tossed the box of orzo in. It was perfect! If you don't like rice, this is a great alternative.   Will make again and again!

I like this recipe.  I didn't make it to the letter as I didn't want to add bacon, shrimp or ham.  Everything else I followed.  Just spicy enough, really good!

My family loved this dish. I added another tsp of Old Bay seasoning on top of the 2 tsp of cajun seasoning I'd already put in. I also put in a few shakes of cayenne pepper sauce. I used smoked sausage but next time I'll use Andouille instead for a more authentic dish. I had to add quite a bit more chicken broth as the rice was still crunchy and the dish was too dry. I let this simmer for about an hour before I added the rice. Thanks, my family was pleased with this dinner.

OMG, yum! This was delish, all three of my kids, who can't agree on anything, loved it! I modified it only a bit, cutting the cajun seasoning to 1 1/4 tea, as we're a bunch of wussys, and it had just enough bite to it. Bear in mind that if you have to cook your meats, it does increase the time to about 2 hours, by the time you're done cooking and chopping. I found that this made enough for 3 whole meals for us, a family of 5 (with 3 boys, 2 of whom are teens). The only thing I'll change next time is to add more liquid. There wasn't quite enough to fully cook all of the rice, so next time I'll add another can of crushed tomatoes.

Pretty much made as written.  Added 2 C. homemade brown chicken stock to get more liquid as per other suggestions.  Next time I would add more rice, as I used 2 C. uncooked instant brown rice. This is a great recipe and a definite keeper

This recipe was tasty, but definitely needed more liquids for the rice. When it was "done", the rice was still crunchy, and there was not much liquid left in the pot. I increased the amount of veggies by about a cup. I will make this recipe again, and will use about 1 1/2 cups more stock.

Just got finished eating a big bowl of this, and it was very good! I omitted the ham (seemed like too much meat to me) and the thyme (didn't have any), and I used butter to cook the veggies instead of bacon. Used Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning, instant rice, canned chicken breast (to save time), Jimmy Dean smoked sausage, stewed tomatoes with green chiles, and frozen salad shrimp. Easy and extremely filling!

This turned out exceptionally well. A great dish to use up odds and ends from my frig., freezer and pantry. For the smoked sausage I used a smoked Polish sausage. Amazingly enough I had a little bit of everything else the recipe called for except the Cajun seasoning and bell pepper. For the seasoning I used a bit of cayenne and black pepper instead. For the bell pepper I chopped up some jarred roasted red peppers which I would use again. What I discovered is a recipe that is well suited for the way I cook and the pantry I keep. I served it with a quarter of lemon to squeeze over for a little acidic pop. Great...full of flavor.

5 Stars from my picky family!  Brown rice and turkey sausage helps to keep it a little healthier - but a great recipe!  I didn't have cajun seasoning, so I used the one from allrecipes.com.

This is an awesome recipe. I didn't have any ham and I only had real bacon pieces which I used. I sauteed the veggies and chicken breast together and went on with the recipe. I used smoked sausage but I should have tried to find Andouille (hard to find in IL) but it was great. Not too spicy for my kids but a lot of flavor and low carb since I cooked the rice seperately.
Next time I will double my cajun seasoning and use Andouille if I can find it. But even as written it is delicious. I did add some garlic which we love. 
I will definitely make this again. It's easy too.
Thanks for sharing.

Freaking delicious! The only thing I changed was the type of sausage, I didn't bother to add ham, and I put more spices in it. I was cutting calories and cost and increasing the bite.
It was easy and came out like a dream! My roommate couldn't stop eating it. Really good--better than my dad makes. Good work Bubba.

I was a hit at my house last night! My husband and kids raved over this dish.  The only change I made was added about 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 teaspoons of minced garlic.  Wow! it was great, if I do say so myself. Thanks Bubba!

This was a very tasty recipe. Using a variety of meats or spice mixes will also help it to taste different each time you make it, (never boring,) or to adapt the level of spice to suit the group you're cooking for. It's a great way to use up any leftovers from your fridge or freezer. I thought it sounded like it called for too much liquid, but the proportion of liquid to rice was perfect. And it went together in a flash. It also freezes nicely. Thanks for posting this great recipe!

This recipe was great!  The flavor was excellent.  The rice cooked unevenly and took longer than it said, so next time I would cook it separately and add it 10 minutes prior.  It will make better leftovers that way as well.  My husband loved it and so did I.

this turned out great...it was easier than i expected, and definitely better the next day, like mentioned by others.  i followed the recipe as is, but i will probably cut back on the rice next time, since i do like it more soupy.  but overall, it's a good recipe and was definitely enjoyed.

This recipe was great, and was even better the next day as leftovers after everything had a chance to marry. Only change was we used medium sized pre-cooked shrimp instead of salad shrimp.

this was the first time i ever made jambalaya, and it was excellent and super easy to make. slightly too thyme-y for me, so i'll use less of that next time, but other than that, delicious. i'll definitely be adding this to my recipe book.

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday.  I skipped the bacon, but had plenty of ham to make up for it, and I used cooked turkey frozen from Christmas instead of chicken.  Hot pepper lovers will want to serve it with a bottle of Tabasco on the table, but the heat was just fine for me.

I made this for dinner last night and it was a hit with my picky husband. The only change I made was to add a bit more of the cajun seasoning. We both enjoyed it very much. Next time I will add something for a bit of heat. Maybe some hot sauce and/or some red pepper flakes. Great recipe. Definitely a keeper.

This was really easy and good!  I omitted the bacon and sauteed the chicken, then sausage, in a little oil, then removed.  I added more peppers (2) than called for then added back the chicken & sausage and rest of ingredients.  (Didn't have shrimp but will next time for sure).  It was a big hit.  
Thanks Bubba!

This is a very good recipe, easy to make and taste quite good. I will however add more spices because as is, it is quite bland. I used kielbasa, but next time I will use a different sausage. I'm also not a big thyme fan so I only used half of what the recipe called for. I made the rice separately and used only 2 cans of stock, 1 beef and 1 vegetable because that's what I had. I also add a half of chicken buillon cube for extra flavor. next time I will use a whole one. This is a recipe that you can play around with, so all in all this is a keeper.

This recipe was so good.  I made some changes, though.  I didn't have any bacon, so I used olive oil to fry the veggies. I didn't miss the bacon flavor at all (with the ham and the turkey sausage and the chicken and the shrimp I found more than enough flavor and less fat!). I substituted the chicken and beef stock with a recipe for Basic Vegetable Stock from this site that I had previously frozen.  I added crushed red peppers, ground cayenne pepper and hot sauce for some bite.  Switched oregano for the thyme.  Seriously a great recipe.

Excellent!  I prepared the rice and soup separately and only used 2 cans of broth in the soup, since that's what I had.  I also used one can of Rotel and one can of crushed tomatoes - added a little zip that my family loves!

Awesome recipe! My first time making jambalaya and it came out great, picky boyfriend loved it. He likes spicy dishes so I added some crushed red pepper flakes, cayenne, and some Tabasco. I only used chicken and sausage and the taste was wonderful. Great dish for a potluck, very easy.

I halfed recipe and my husband said it was better than Zataran's.  Only meat I used was Kilbasa sausage but used the whole package and left out celery. Added some red bell that we had already chopped. Also use long grain brown rice.  I cook the rice separately in the chken/beef stock till mostly done, then add in with the veggies and meat.  Let simmer until rice is done. One of my favorites!!

This was excellent. I left out the bacon and sauted the celery, onion and bell pepper in oil & butter. Could have used more Cajun seasoning. Prep time was more like 45 minutes. Will make again.

This was ok.  Not something I'll make again, though.  I did not like the taste of the bacon grease in the jambalaya, though.  I'll give it 3 stars only because it was better then the last jambalaya I tried.

Loved this!  I did leave out the celery and shrimp because of a picky husband and children but other than that made it to specifications.  It was excellent, filling, flavorful and just a touch spicy.  Will definitely make it again!

Very tasty!  Be careful with the broth though as this recipe can become too salty.  I had to add a potato to absorb the salt.

This recipe didn't come out the way I wanted to because I couldn't read instructions properly, but otherwise ot came out pretty well. I took out the sausage and ham and added the other ingredients to taste (no measurements). To get the right texture for the rice, I boiled it halfway before adding it to the broth/tomato paste mix. I also used half of a 6 oz can of tomato paste and a 12 oz can of tomato sauce instead of crushed tomato.

great recipe,  I have made some before that were too tomato based,  this was just right. Also, I used my homemade sausages that I made with ghost peppers and added a few habaneros to top up the heat.  Obviously I like it a little spicy, and this recipe had no heat in it.

This was delicious.  I deleted the ham(because I forgot to buy it)  and used Bratwurst (because it was what I had)instead of the smoked sausage and it was amazing. I made the recipe for the simple cajun seasoning instead of buying it pre-made. I'm making it again tonight. It's my hubby's new favorite!

We love jambalaya and I mix things up all the time.  This recipe was as good as any I've ever made.  I did make some adjustments though because of what I had on hand.  I did not have ham or shrimp so I only used chicken and smoked sausage.  I also used diced tomatoes, my own homemade chicken broth (no beef on hand) and brown Minute Rice.  From other recipes I've made, I didn't feel 2 tsp was enough cajun seasoning (for our taste) so I used 2 TBSP made from a recipe here on Allrecipes.  For some reason, maybe because I used Minute Rice (which only took 10 minutes to cook instead of the 20), it was REALLY soupy so I added in 2 more cups of Minute Rice and cooked another 10 minutes.  It was the perfect consistency then.  I added generous splashes of Tabasco sauce.  Love that we have leftovers as this is sure to get even better tomorrow.

This was a wonderful and easy one pot dish. Used cut-up/trimmed ham steaks, poached chicken thighs, Cajun pre-cooked sausage and fresh shrimp. Definitely will make again but probably will halve recipe (although leftovers were even better flavors!)!

this is the first time ive ever cooked jambalay! with all the available ingredients i have, it still good! i used turkey sausage, canned chicken, frozen large shrimp, bacon, roasted crushed tomatoes in can, & i dont have any ham. i also used chicken bouillon instead. i added paprika in addition to the cajun but i thought it was too much so i put some water to neutralize the flavor. i should stick with just the cajun seasoning next time. brought some at work coz i cooked alot and they liked it too.

I didn't change the ingredients.  After browning the bacon. I browned the smoked sausage in the bacon grease, then the chicken, then the veges.  Added tomatoes, broth and simmered for 1 1/2 hours in a dutch oven.  Removed 2 cups of the broth to cook the basmati rice separately until almost done.  Refrigerated overnight.  Next day I heated the meat mixture, added the rice and brought to a boil.  Added shrimp, covered the pot and turned off the stove.  Once the rice absorbed the liquid, added bacon and packed it up and took it to church with some cornbread.  Big, big hit.

I made it as the recipe describes and it was fantastic.  I stirred the rice in the jambalaya twice in the first 8 minutes.  I then added raw 31-40 shrimp after 15 minutes of simmering and stirred them in, then returned the lid on the pot and let it simmer for 10 more minutes.  When it was done cooking I let it rest for 15 minutes so that the rice would absorb more liquid and allowed some of the water to evaporate.  This was delicious.

It's good. It makes A LOT. My only issue is it needs salt. Not a lot, but definitely some. It might also could use a bit more liquid. I know the leftovers will need something to help them come back to life, because it is SUPER thick now. I didn't have any issues with the rice. This is one of the few rice dishes you MUST stir and scrape the bottom every few minutes while cooking to keep from clumping and sticking. Overall, great recipe.

This dish is delicious. I didn't use bacon. I also mixed smoked sausage and andoulle sausage. I added crab and okra at the end. This was a big hit and I will make it again and again and again. Thanks Bubba

I did as others suggested and made the rice separately.  To the rice I added a beef and a chicken bouillon cube, as I did not have any broth.  While the rice was cooking I prepped the rest in a large skillet, then allowed diners to mix the rice with the meat and veggies as they liked.  I went light on the tomatoes as some in my family really don't like them, and added thinly sliced cabbage.  Everyone enjoyed this meal!

I made the Colorado version and it was delish.  I substituted turkey for chicken as I'm an AB blood type, all natural turkey sausage and bacon for the regular as I'm looking to cut cholesterol, no shrimp, veggie stock for beef as its the law in Western Colorado,  haha.   And cooked brown rice separately as I'm at 9000 feet, for 40 minutes.   Spectacular??   Reminds me of my Louisiana road trip y'all.

love this recipe. personally I add the shrimp with the rest of the meats because I feel that the shrimp absorbs more of the flavors that way. 
second time I made it I added 2 tsp cayenne pepper. it adds a nice little bite, not overpowering. love it.
once cooked, I like putting it in a 5 quart crock pot to keep warm especially if I am cooking for a big dinner like Thanksgiving or Christmas. this is a great addition to any meal it by itself

Excellent recipe! I pretty much stuck to the recipe except I did what another reviewer said and I sautéed the rice in the bacon grease once the veggies were soft BEFORE I added the liquid. I also added some file powder to thicken it up. I don’t eat pork so I omitted the ham and substituted beef bacon and chicken andouille. I also doubled the chicken breast which I cooked by seasoning with cajun seasoning and sautéing. I added cooked shrimp from the store but next time I’ll cook it myself after seasoning with cajun seasoning. I had no trouble with mushy rice, but I did need to increase the heat once the rice was tender to cook out some of the liquid. Thank you for this recipe!

Very good, not overly spicy so the hubby is good with it. I did make some changes, I used left over 2 different types of left over smoked chicken sausages in place of the chicken, used cheddarwurst in place of the smoked sausage as well as 1 bratwurst. I know its a fairly large change to still rate the recipe but everything else is the same and technically I used chicken and smoked sausage. I did completely omit the shrimp though, but seriously really good and not overly spicy it just kind sits on your tongue. Thank you FORDMAN88 for a great recipe that everyone in the house really enjoyed.

I made this recipe, but added shredded carrots and mushrooms.  I put all the veggies into my processor and zipped them up.  I also used some stewed tomatoes and the end result was creamy and delicious.  Excellent recipe - thank you!

I've made this 4 times now and I don't think I'll even attempt to look for another recipe! Used Eckrich smoked Turkey Sausage (the entire package), an ENTIRE package of bacon, 3/4 a pound of chicken, and 1/4 a pound of ham. I also nearly doubled the vegetables but cut them much smaller - made it super hearty! I also added 1/2 of teaspoon of garlic powder towards the end of the deglazing process right before the veggies are tender. Cooked the rice separately. Came out incredible!

I appreciated that this used up some ingredients that had been in my freezer for awhile, but every time I make a dish that has me add uncooked rice, the rice never cooks completely. I ended up simmering it for double the time and still had crunchy pieces of rice. Very annoying. Now we have a big batch of leftovers that no one wants to eat. I would suggest cooking the rice separately.

My son who is vegan loved it. To make it vegan I used meatless sausage only, vegetable broth, tri color sweet peppers, onion, celery,  organic tomatoes and all the spices.

Great recipe and the hardest part is all the chopping. I made it minus the shrimp because I don’t really care for seafood and it was wonderful. Don’t know how other people’s tastes are but to me thyme is a very over powering seasoning so I cut the quantity  of that down to a quarter of what the recipe calls for.

Turned out terrific.  I subbed a couple things that I was out of.  I also used leftover cooked rice, instead of cooking it together.  I look forward to cooking it together next time!

This recipe is a hit! Very easy to prepare with lots of flavor. I omitted the chicken and used ground breakfast sausage instead along with the other meats. Everyone loved it. You won't go wrong with this one.

I made this and followed exactly except I had to use all chicken broth, since I had no beef broth.
I found that I need to add more rice, due to it. being "soup" like. 
The flavor was good, but did have to add some sea salt to taste.
I will use this recipe again, maybe tweaking it a bit.

I wanted to try a new jambalaya recipe.   I made this one exactly as the directions stated.  It's too bland for my taste, which means it's way too bland for my husband, who loves authentic southern / cajun food.  This recipe would be great for young children or people who have a hard time tolerating spices.  For those of us who like authentic, spicy, southern food, you'll need to spice this up 3-5x more than the recipe states.

My only complaint was the rice. I wanted to cook it in with the rest to soak up all the flavor. But I should have listened to all the reviews. Rice was slightly underdone. Next time I will cook rice separately. Otherwise it was yummy! I added more onion and peppers. And 1 small hot pepper for heat. Took it to a reunion. Brought the pot back empty!

I hate recipes that pretend to be "authentic Cajun" recipes when they are not.  This is one of them.  What Cajun would put ham, chicken and sausage into the same dish?  NONE!  The essence of Cajun cuisine is that it evolved to take advantage of whatever products that were available at the time.  Too many people take a recipe that may or may not be delicious and plunk down the label "Cajun" when it is not even close to being "Cajun".  Shame on you!

This by far is the best Jambalaya I ever had. I made only half of the recipe since only three people in the house. I used can of diced tomatoes because that is all I got on hand. I also used creole seasoning instead of Cajun seasoning (that’s what I have on hand also). I did added large raw shrimps and frozen cut okra at the end. My husband didn’t care much for anything with shrimps ate this and asked for second!! I will definitely make it again and again. Thank you!!!

Used what we had on hand – already cooked chicken breasts, grilled with mesquite flavoring – had some cubed ham (a cup more than needed for a ham cheese and potato casserole earlier this week) Italian hot sausage – and my shrimp loving husband – I try to always have a shrimp option in the freezer! I did not have beef broth handy– but canned French onion soup – it’s primarily beef bouillon with a lot of onions. This makes a great meal.  I did not have bacon one hand – so used olive oil to sauté the celery and onions – really soften the intensity of the Cajon seasoning. Thanks Bubba!!

I made this yesterday, and really liked the taste.  I used 2 green peppers, 4 onions,  and andouille sausage,  1 pound 12-18 shrimp and added the spices Justin suggested, in his review.  I followed the recipe after that.  This is the best  Jambalaya I have ever tasted.

Great recipe! I used the Creole seasoning instructions for the Cajun spicing and followed the recipes to a T. I did NOT add bacon; instead I added it to a green bean side dish.  Used brown rice instead.  Amazing recipe.

We absolutely loved it, but of course, like everybody else, I made a few changes. I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and didn’t and use the ham. I increased the Cajun spice to 3 teaspoons divided and added a dash of cayenne   pepper. I added  large raw peeled and deveined shrimp which I seasoned with the Cajun seasoning five minutes before it was finished cooking and it was truly amazing. This is a great dish for fat Tuesday. Happy Mardi Gras everybody!

This recipe is a keeper!  We made the recipe EXACTLY as called for and it couldn’t possibly have been better. Used andouille for the sausage and Tony Cacheres creole seasoning.  Cooked it in a Dutch oven on our gas range. Perfect!

Try substituting crawfish tail meat for the shrimp and doubling the amount and allow it to cook for 5 to 7 minutes.  Do not overcook or, like overcooked shrimp, it will become rubbery.  It truly gives the dish a gourmet quality taste that your friends will rave about.

Hooray! My boyfriend really loved this dish!!! I pretty much followed the instructions to a T. I didn’t have ham on hand (nor do I care much for it), so I omitted it. I followed another user’s advice to add the uncooked rice early on (when the veggies were nearly done cooking so that the grains could be coated in the bacon grease). The end result was a well-cooked mixture of rice & various meats. Thank you for this recipe and the rice advice!

I agree, make the rice separate , used baked brown rice, (thank you Alton Brown ).  Bacon is not  necessary,  use olive oil for the Veg.   Because the rice is separate,  use 2 cups of stock,  homemade chicken is best. Add a bay leaf while simmering.  Optional: thicken with flour and water mixture as desired,  1/2 cup water,  1/4 cup  flour

Hi Bubba!  Loved your Jambalaya recipe.  Its a dish that we love, so I like to try everyone else's recipes for it, too.  Yours was terrific.  It earned its 5 stars!  Just like the Jambalaya that my Mother used to make...and that is saying a lot; since she was a terrific cook!

Way to git ‘er done Bubba! Outstanding! Will definitely be making this again. My wife doesn’t like onions, so I substituted with garlic. Also added frozen okra about 10 minutes before finished. Awesome!

Delicious! I used hot links, substituted one can of Rotelo for one of the cans of tomatoes, used krab (shellfish allergy), and tossed in a bag of frozen ngombo at the end. Huge hit!

It turned out perfect.  I used Philip Shore's recommendation for the addition of a few ingredients, used veggie broth, and subbed quick cook brown rice for the regular rice, I checked it every 10 minutes to ensure it didn't get mushy or overcooked.

I really like this recipe and I've been making it for a few years now. I do leave out the shrimp usually because they are pricey and don't reheat as well. I usually add instant rice during the last 5 minutes (brown or white). I also made creole seasoning myself and halved the amount of cayenne to better suit my family's tastes. I also cook the chicken (I use thighs) in the bacon fat after cooking the bacon. I pull out the chicken and toss in the veggies and follow the recipe from there. Very yummy!

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit.  Everyone asked for the recipe!  I followed the recipe with only a couple of adjustments - a red pepper instead of green, omitted the thyme, used about 1 1/2 Tablespoons of the Cajun seasoning - added 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and a few shakes of hot pepper sauce.  I used a cup and a half of each of the meats and a 12 ounce bag of shrimp.  It was great for a dinner party since everything could be prepped ahead and thrown together.  Also, it was pleasantly spicy but not overwhelming and suited a variety of palates.  A green salad and some jalapeno cornbread rounded out the meal.  This is definitely worth your time!

I made this for dinner and it was excellent.  The only thing I did differently was exclude the ham was added a clove of garlic and made my own Cajun seasoning.  Definitely we will have this again very soon.

This was so good, didn't really make any changes other than used medium sized shrimp instead of salad size and added just a bit more heat since my husband loves extra spicy. It was so good, my husband raved about it for days.

Being from New Orleans I had to have a lil kick to it! I added a few dashes of Tabasco and crushed red pepper flakes. I also modified the meats since I'm allergic to shellfish I only used smoke sausage (didn't have any ham on hand and was putting wings on the grill so I omitted that as well). Came out pretty tasty.

Very very good meal. Added some cayenne pepper seasoning to spice it up a little bit as I made it for others.  Would love to chop up a bunch of habanero peppers but not everyone loves that much heat.  I used green and red peppers.  Will definitely make again. Easy to make.

You are the man Bubba! I followed this recipe to a T for the most part, I used wild turkey breasts and fire cracker sausage, added red, yellow and orange peppers as well as bell peppers. Since I doubled the recipe, I had to make the rice separately in a rice cooker, using bacon grease and the two types of broth to make it.  It got scarfed down so quickly, and I got so many compliments at the party I made it for, I felt I owed it to Bubba to post it.  Incidentally, I made it again Low Carb style by substituting rice for cauliflower rice. All I suggest changing for the recipe to using 1/2 cup each of the broths, otherwise, it would be soupy. Yum yum yum...  thanks Bubba!!!

I did not have ham or thyme on hand. Other than missing those items I made the recipe as instructed. This was so easy and delicious.  I don't understand  why anyone would cook the rice separately as I read in some comments. The rice needs to cook in the juices.  Thank you for this recipe it will be a staple in my house.

I would use a spicier sausage. The smoked kinds seems too sweet for this. Recipe makes a ton! I cut it in half and had plenty for four people.

i made this recently with my mom for my nephew,  its a classic here in my home, we love it, we added a little more cajun seasoning this time, for more flavor.  Its not very hard to make this dish, and its quite tasty.  I might add some pepperoni slices next time for more bite!

Followed recipe like it was written,  although the taste was good, the rice was mushy, like others stated.  If I make it again I'll cook the rice separate. This recipe does make ALOT!!!

This was wonderful and I normally would not rate as I didn't follow recipe exactly. I used andouille sausage instead of bacon, brought the broth to a boil in microwave then added it with the rice. Then the last five minutes added raw gulf shrimp and the cooked chicken. I did increase the heat for our taste.

I thought this was fantastic.& easy.  Only change I made is to do rice separately since I have one child who doesn't care for rice. (Uses most of broth in cooking rice, less in making the main dish). Will certainly make again.

Delicious!  I added garlic and a little sugar.  Might cut back on the Cajun seasoning next time.

Although it's not easy/quick enough for a week-night dinner, it's a great Sunday afternoon dinner - especially during Mardi Gras!! I made it pretty much exactly as written but may have used a little extra onion and peppers. I also added chopped garlic after the veggies. Other than that, it was the same. Great recipe. Note: Cajun seasoning varies with spiciness. I used Chef Paul's chicken seasoning and it was perfect. My husband added a little Tabasco... Will make again!!

My guests and I loved it. The only thing I did differently is cooked the rice separately, before adding it to the crock pot. If you like it spicy, add more Cajun seasoning. It's really easy to make.

I made this recipe as submitted. It was fantastic and I'm giving it 5 stars.  I used long-grain jasmine rice, and once it was added I did limit the cooking time to 20 minutes as stated. The rice was cooked but not mush. I will definitely make this again.

This Jambalaya is so good!! Thanks Bubba. I didn't have any ham so I left it out and just added extra chicken, sausage and shrimp and a little more Cajun seasoning because we like things spicy. It is so quick to make and taste like you have been cooking all day. I will be making this often.

Double your flavor!!!  Use one or two smoked ham shanks.  Simmer the shanks in  the broth for several hours adding extra to account for evaporation.  Reserve the meat in place of the ham. You won't be disappointed. Also Brown rice stays a bit firmer or make the rice separately.  Mushy rice is a bummer.

I used the precut celery/onions (1 c ea) plus 2 extra celery stalks. I sweated together w the bell pepper and 1 tbsp butter and 1 tsp minced garlic.  I tried once with shredded chicken and it got lost in the rice so this time I used 1.5 lbs 1" cubed chicken (dipped in seasoning and pan fried), 1 lb jimmy dean mild sausage cooked in a fine crumble, and 1 lb beef sausage.  Followed the recipe but added 1 can diced tomatoes, 2 tbsp Worcestershire, 1.5 tsp chachere's, 1/2 tsp thyme as recommended, 1/2 tsp garlic powder. To prevent rice mushiness I steamed it for 20 minutes in the broth liquids then added to the pot after (about half cooked).

This a fantastic recipe that I've made several times. The most recent version used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. I substituted Andouille sausage for the ham. It was delicious!

I didn't have celery so I used celery salt.  I didn't have a green bell pepper so I used 1/2 a can of green chilies.  I stir fried some carrots, yellow bell pepper, mushrooms, chicken, italian sausage, shrimp separately and added it to the 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  Actually I made a bunch of changes but I think the recipe untouch would be good also.

Loved this! The key here is to trust your taste buds and add other seasons as you see fit. I added som parsley, a bit of garlic spread seasoning and of course the ultimate add on is a dollop of sour cream after serving. This makes it an amazing creamy jambalaya! Enjoy it!

I used pancetta instead of bacon, and feta sausage instead of the smoked ( did not want to go to the grocery store!) and it was still very good!  Will make again.

I used Slap yo Momma cajun seasoning and added some tabasco sauce as well. Also seasoned the chicken with cajun seasoning when pre-cooking. Oh, and added strong Russian garlic along with the onion. I didn't read the suggestion of cooking the rice separately and mine didn't turn mushy but I like the idea of serving over cooked rice.  Was loved by all and sought after for lunches for several days afterwards.

It's a very good recipe and we will make it again, though not a competitor for "better than most restaurant versions in Louisiana" at least in my experience.  I made it as written and the rice took for-ever to cook.  Next time will cook separately and add in at the end as many suggested. It's also a lot infer time investment than an 1:05, I don't understand why recipes on this site chronically understate total time required.

I didn't have  fresh chicken on had so used canned chicken breast.  I also used instant brown rice instead of white rice.  I also cooked the rice "in" the pan with everything else and it came out delicious.  I cooked it for about 30 minutes on very low simmer after adding the rice to soak up all the juice without the rice going to mush.  Could do the rice separate but you won't get the melding of the flavors you do cooking it in the dish as recommended.  To each his own on that part I suppose.  Came out delicious!  Could have been spicier for me but stuck with the recipe as written because my wife prefers less.  Great recipe.

It was awesome! A big hit with the adults. I added more meat than the recipe called for only because I would've had an awkward amount of meat leftovers. I added the rice as the directions stated and it came out perfect! I will absolutely make this dish again.

This dish was not my favorite it, the rice turned out to me too mushy for my family liking.  However, that is how the Jambalaya should be.  The recipe was good, it had good seasoning. For me it was just the rice I did not like the texture, next time I will add more rice and less cups of broth.

this recipe by Bubba is probably the best tasting jambalaya I have ever had. I use a chicken and smoked sausage other than that I followed the recipe directly and was extremely pleased with the results. for the Cajun spice I use the Tony Chechere cajun spice and that might have been the thing that made the big difference this is an excellent recipe.

This was a really good recipe. I did add tsp of sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes, used ro-tel style diced tomatoes and green chillies, and upped the Cajun seasoning to 3 teaspoons (if it's not burning their taste buds off, it's not hot enough for my boys!)

Simple yet delicious!!  I have made this a few times.  This time the only meats I used was bacon, shrimp and sausage to cut down on cost.  I added two cans of corn and I make the rice in a separate pot.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was delicious! I served it with cheddar biscuits and a tomato and cucumber salad. For the jambalaya, I used pretty much what the recipe called for minus the ham, okra, (As I didn't have any of those) and shrimp.  My wife isn't really into seafood. I didn't have any crushed tomatoes on hand so I used a can of tomato sauce instead. I would totally make this again.

This was delicious! I made a giant pot of it for guests. Everyone loved it and had multiple bowls. The recipe was easy, so I was skeptical about how good it would be. But it was fantastic. The only change I made was that I used a bit more Cajun spice than indicated. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.

Made this for the 2nd time with these changes and it was perfect, I used green onions, 3 cups of celery, 1 lb of bacon, garlic was added when cooking the vegetables, 3 tsp of cajun,  1 lb of shrimp, and 3 cups of minute rice!! Fabulous, and even better the next day

This was my first time making jambalaya and it was awesome! It will not be my last! I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the ham. For anyone having problems with the rice, just use long-grain white rice. I didn't have any problems. Thank you Bubba for this delicious recipe.

Oh my gosh this is Wonderful!  I made it for a family visiting from Switzerland.  I wanted something from the USA and since he also had French in his history, I thought Cajan would be just the thing. I made the whole recipe pretty much as given other than adding a little more Cajun seasoning and an entire pound of 21-25 shrimp. I sautéed them with a little butter, some paprika and Cajan seasoning. I added a cup+ of frozen okra, heated it up to take the cold off the okra, dumped on the shrimp...and 4 adults, a 2 year old and a 4 year old ate every bit of the 12 servings. They loved it. I served it with honey corn bread and they cleaned that up too. Those babies ate nearly as much as the rest of us.  Thank you so much for a recipe that I will make for every special occasion!

This recipe was very easy to make. I've been making jambalaya for years using Zatarans pre-mixed seasoning and rice. No more of that. This was way better. I personally don't care for thyme so I left that out. and to give it more of a kick I used crushed red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce. For those who like souther food I definitely recommend this recipe. It was DEEEE-LISH. Can't recommend it enough. yum ?? yum.

Love all the meats in this, use bigger shrimp than salad size. Add more spice than in the recipe, it's pretty mild as is. One of those meals that gets tastier as it sits, leftovers are marvelous.

Bubba's recipe is the best jambalaya I've made! I made just a couple of small changes - used chorizo sausage and didn't add chicken and the spice was about perfect. The recipe makes a lot so we'll be having it for leftovers!

What a great winter warm-up! I didn't have any ham so I bumped up the chicken, sausage and shrimp. I also didn't have white rice so I used basmati, which I don't recommend for this dish, but it still came out delicious! It will definitely be on my rotation, THANKS FOR SHARING!!!

I made this just like the recipe called for and we really liked.  The second time I did make some changes because I had no celery so I put okra in and no chicken so I used walleye. (Live by Lake Erie and fish all summer long!) I also used long grain rice and two cups of chicken broth.

Good recipe. I had some leftover rice from the day before and came across this dish. Since I already had the rice done, I just needed to prep the other ingredients. I used andouille sausage , cubed ham and chicken cut into bite size pieces and cooked each separately. 
I cooked the celery, bell pepper and onion according to directions and added the cooked proteins, rice and tomatoes. I added the chicken broth and Creole seasoning. Since the sausage and ham provided enough salt, and the Creole seasoning had nearly enough heat, I didn't need to add anything but some black pepper. Simmered it all for about 20 minutes and it was good to go! I omitted the shrimp and bacon, due to taste preferences of the group I was making this for, but I can see how they would add to this dish in terms of taste and texture.  All in all a very solid recipe.

I made it for a party and it was a hit!!! I changed the thyme and Cajun spice from teaspoon to table spoon, switched out 1/2 lb ham and shrimp for more chicken and more smoked chicken sausage. I used turkey bacon, too, so some extra oil had to be used to keep from sticking. And, switched out white rice and quinoa. The recipe is amazing; I just tried to cut corners for more health.

This was excellent.  Just like I remember eating in Louisiana the 9yrs I lived there.  If not better.  I followed the recipe exactly other than using three garlic cloves and two bay leaves.  There is no reason to cook the rice separately.  In fact, it isn't jambalaya  if you cook the rice separately.  The rice is meant to soak up all the flavor  that is in the pot.  Not taste like white rice.  Boil the mix, add the rice, stir, cover, turn heat to low and let cook 20 minutes.  Don't open the pot until done.  It will be perfect.  5 stars!

Hit the spot for the WHOLE family - some of whom are a little pickier about what they eat! 
Followed the directions as specified and the dish turned out great.  Next time, I'll experiment and add some okra and Tabasco sauce.
By the way, this dish was complemented very nicely with a chilled bottle of Gewürztraminer!

Delicious! Basically, I followed the recipe, but used 3 tsp Cajun seasoning, 1 1/2 lbs. jumbo shrimp, Andouille sausage (instead of smoked) & added 14 oz. gumbo veggies.    This is now a staple for our fall/winter meals.

This was easy to make, and I actually had all the ingredients on hand. I made it as is, without changes. I did not find the rice to get sticky and gluey as some people said. The one thing I would change is to add more spice. It was very bland. I think I would start off with two tablespoons (probably three) of Cajun seasoning and go from there and add some garlic.  I would make this again with some changes to the seasoning. If you don't like spicy food, I'd make this as is.

Delicious! I like to make large batches of a good meal and put the remainder in the freezer - I usually have about a month's worth of dinners in there. So the only changes I made were that I doubled the recipe, used pre-fried crumbled Costco bacon because I had no sliced bacon on hand, and made my own Cajun spice from a recipe right here on the site. My son, who is an outstanding cook (far better than me) pronounced it DELICIOUS - and I put THREE batches away for the winter!

While a tad time consuming to chop, assemble and cook, even with pre-cooked meats, it is quite a delicious recipe which will be made again.  Halved it, used jarred roasted red peppers, Old Bay seasoning, and more salad shrimp than suggested.  Added uncooked rice during the last twenty minutes, tested at fifteen, then added the bacon for a few more minutes.  Very tasty indeed; thank you!

Made this for hubby tonight  and he LOVED it! 
I tweaked it a little since hubby loves meat. Instead of a pound of chicken I used over 2 lbs (4 big breasts) And used an entire pack of sausage (4 big links). Cut the bacon out all together (honestly just didn't sound good to me) and instead used the sausage grease to sautée the vegetables.  Used the entire bag of frozen shrimp. Used 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of crushed (I like the diced tomato consistency) Also used 2 bell peppers instead of one and 4 celery stalks. Followed others advice and cooked the rice separately and just mixed it as it was served. Would have loved to add okra but went to 3 stores and no one carries it (wth!?) but can't wait to throw it in next time!  Hubby has already requested this be made at least every other week, if not every week.

I liked this just fine, but my husband was put off by all the different textures of  meats.  He's a funny (picky) guy, but I love him anyway.  Probably won't make this again.

This was actually pretty yummy. I omitted the ham & used Cajun chicken breast. I cooked my rice seperate because I didn't want it to be mushy or not done. I actually used the 10 min boil n bag rice because I forgot about using rice (lol). I made my own Cajun seasonings because I wanted that Cruzan flavoring (my home)to be present.  I also added just a teaspoon of flour to make the broth a little thicker. I didn't want it too soupy. I cut up my shrimp in smaller pieces to hide it from my son since he swears he hates seafood. He didn't even taste it or know it was in there. All n all after tweaking here & there yet staying true to the recipe, this was a hit/success. Also it made more than enough that I won't have to cook for a few days. Thanks Bubba

Excellent!  Made it according to the recipe with the exception of the shrimp.  I had none on hand & didn't want to go to the grocery store in the rain.  Added a little more sausage & chicken.  I used Uncle Ben's Original Long-Grain rice.  The cooking time of 20 minutes once the rice was added was just perfect.

This jambalaya recipe is hard to beat for taste and ease of making! If you make it just as is, you will definitely have a wonderful meal. But this is another one of those recipe's that begs to be tweaked to you and your family's liking. I choose to add a clove or two of minced garlic and I  leave out the ham and I use Old Bay seasoning in place of the Cajun seasoning and the Thyme. I use larger shrimp (I remove the tails prior to cooking for easier eating), I cook my rice separately and switch up whether I use brown or  white rice, depending on my mood that day. :) Give this one a try and don't be shy about tweaking it a little to suit your tastes.

My family loved this recipe! I made just a few slight changes. I cooked raw chicken breast pieces with the bacon in the beginning. Then removed and continued directions. I also added garlic, salt, and cracked pepper, along with one can of kidney beans drained.

I used an "extra hot Cajun spice" mix that we got at a local spice dealer, and then I threw in a whole diced jalapeno pepper along with the onions and celery. I thought I was going a little overboard with the heat and might regret it later. As it turned out, the jambalaya was not really hot at all. I think the spice proportions used in this recipe make for a more mild jambalaya, with the focus being on that crushed tomato flavoring. It all tastes GREAT and has a good thick consistency (I recommend stirring every couple of minutes after putting the rice in, to keep it from settling at the bottom which a lot of people seem to have had trouble with). But next time I will increase the amount of Cajun spice to 3 tsp and throw in a habanero pepper along with the jalapeno, simply because I want the heat to be more noticeable. 

Oh, also, throwing in a cup of frozen sliced okra about 10 minutes into the cooking process worked out GREAT.

I made this without beef stock since I only had chicken, and used more sausage as I didn't have ham, but otherwise followed the recipe.  The rice took about 30 minutes to cook but that was the only change.  Yum!  Thanks!

Great recipe, but I did not see any warnings about the following. When I added the rice, it sucked all the liquid up. Next time I'm thinking of putting some rice in each person's bowl and then ladling the liquid into each bowl. Did anyone else have an answer for this problem. Other problem, which is my fault, was I used a larger  shrimp with tails because I did not have salad shrimp. The tails came off and some mouthfuls had these broken off tails in them. Not good. These are not the fault of the recipe, but I thought I would warn others about my problems. Thanks Bubba.

Cooking for a family of 8, I am always grateful to find a recipe everyone likes. I make this recipe almost weekly and my husband down to my 2 year old rave about how much they enjoy it! Since we are on a strict budget, I often substitute pinto beans for the meat in this dish and somehow it always turns out very flavorful and satisfying after boiling the beans with the veggies and broth. When meat is plentiful, this dish is great as well. Love it!

Great recipe. I used Toni chachere's creole seasoning instead of Cajun seasoning and I omitted the bacon . 
I did add some garlic powder,crush red pepper, and salt. I also cooked the rice separate and I'll add an extra green pepper next time too. I'd also like to try it with andouille sausage.

Yuuuummmmyyyyy! Cooked it exactly as stated. Lots of flavor!! Next time I may only put 1/3 of the rice in the pot, then cook the rest of the rice separately.

Awesome recipe! Made it tonight and also tossed in some okra. I have leftovers for the week, but my family loves it, so that's ok by me. I also made my brown rice in the rice cooker because I always screw up rice. lol

I used this recipe to make Jambalaya for the first time and it was a huge hit with my boyfriend and room mates! the only things I changed was putting in an extra green pepper and adding linguine pasta instead of rice.

This was fabulous. I didn't have a lot of time, so I took a couple short-cuts. I threw a couple tablespoons of bacon fat in a pan and I used a couple bags of Birds Eye Seasoning Blend frozen chopped onions, celery and peppers. I let that cook up for a bit, maybe 5 minutes or so. I threw in some garlic salt with that, too. For step #2, I sliced up some smoked turkey sausage and used that. I also had a large can of chicken breast, so I dumped that in. Instead of plain rice, I used a box of Zataran's jambalaya mix. I followed Bubba's instructions and let it all simmer until we couldn't wait any longer. Step #3, I threw in a a couple cups of frozen okra, a bag of tiny frozen shrimp and a bag of Hormel chopped bacon. Served it with lots of hot sauce. This turned out great!

I followed the recipe as is (although I added some garlic) and it was great. I used a parboiled rice that is firmer and has more substance than normal white rice and it had a great consistency. I'll definitely make this again.

delicious. made three times now, and the last time i used leftover raw shrimp that was in the fridge. i'm not much of a seafood person so i will cook without in the future. it seemed on the salty side but not overwhelming. this makes enough for 12 people as stated so i ended up freezing the extra for an easy reheated recipe at a later date.

worked great with leftover turkey instead of chicken, or ham from holiday meals. i also added the rice toward the end like the other reviews suggested.

A Firehouse favorite!   I tripled the recipe for 9 firefighters.  Used 3 lbs of each of the meats.  We had plenty of leftovers that were gone by lunch the next shift!

I made this recipe for a football game party we had and everybody loved it!  It was pretty easy to make but did take some time, but it was worth the wait!  I accidentally bought lemon pepper flavored chicken which turned out to be a good idea.  I also used Old Bay seasoning instead of cajun and didn't have any thyme, so I skipped it. I added flavored cans of tomatoes instead of plain.  I made a double batch, so I used three cans of garlic and onion flavored and one can with green chiles in it.  When I make it again, I will probably skip the shrimp, because it didn't seem to add that much flavor, but I highly recommend using venison sausage if you have it available! I did, and that made this dish awesome!!!

This is a great recipe, make it for my Gulf Coast relatives and they love it too. I've been making it for a few years now. I only made 2 changes, no beef broth (extra chicken) and about a cup of beer. I've made it with microbrews (from IPA to Brown Ales...no darker though) and Bud...both good. This recipe will stay in my family forever now :) Thanks!

First timer on making jambalaya and this was the way to go!! I used Hormel precooked bacon bits (cuz i had em) with a lil olive oil then added my red pepper (allergic to green)and onions right to the bacon. I used the measurements listed here for tomatoes, broth and rice but eyeballed everything else. I left out the ham and also used chicken thigh with breast meat for more flavor. i seasoned the chicken with my cajun spice and shrimp with seafood seasoning before adding. it turned out amazing!!! I served with fresh Florida avocado which was delicious and helped clear and cool the pallet! Thanks bubba!!

1/2 recipe is more than enough for our family

Wow! This recipe turned out spot-on for my family and received rave reviews all around (well, unless you count my oldest daughter who is against all things seafood on principle -- but I did see her get seconds so I think that she was complaining just to complain). The flavors came together spectacularly and the seasoning was just right for the family (I'm the only one that likes things with more kick).

I ended up making the rice separately as I had some leftover from the night before that I wanted to use up in this dish. I also tossed in some shredded carrots along with the other veggies since I wanted to use them up. This made a great dinner meal and I'm looking forward even more to leftovers for lunch today now that the flavors have had more chance to blend. Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!  We add a little garlic, salt, pepper, and granulated onion. We also left out the shrimp and substituted Andouille sausage for smoke sausage.  I am excited we made a gigantic double batch because it will be even better tomorrow!!!

I made a half-batch of this recipe, subbing a few meats around due to dietary restrictions and what I have on hand.  Made with homemade beef sausage, and turkey bacon, no ham, and catfish in place of the shrimp.  It's absolutely delicious, and I will certainly make it again!

Made this tonight.  I really liked it.  I used my own broth (chicken only), forgot the bacon by accident and threw everything except the rice in the crock pot for the day (shrimp last 20 minutes).  I made rice on the side.  It was excellent!!!!!!!  Now.....I can freeze the leftovers w/o rice and not worry about the icky textured rice when defrosting!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I love this recipe.  The first time I made it I added all ingredients as directed.  Because there are just 2 adults and 2 children, I had leftovers (which is a good thing).  The ONLY reason I gave it a 4 star is the shrimp became very tough when I warmed it up, which is to be expected.  So I am making it again this evening but leaving out the shrimp ;'( and increasing the other meat amounts.  I love it leftover so I don't want to decrease the recipe, with shrimp, to fit just the four of us!!

This was very easy and delicious. I did cut it down to 6 servings but I think next time I will make the full recipe. Every one loved it except my 6 year old grand daughter who is a picky eater. Bubba, thanks so much for this recipe.

This is so AWESOME!!. Never had Jambalaya before. Iy turned out fabulous and OH SO YUMMY....even had some leftovers. I gathered up and then prepared the ingredients. Then followed the video, which helped me alot. OMG! It was delcious. I certainly will try this again....and again. I left out the shrimp, Just a note: I left out the shrimp, asI can't eat shrimp, but it still tuned out yummy. Give this one a try....and enjoy your efforts. :)

I cooked this recipe "as is" and it turned out great! I know some expressed concern over the rice sticking to the pot. I have cooked jambalaya quite a few times. I always stir it from the bottom a few minutes after adding the rice. It never really presents a problem unless the heat is too high.  Highly recommend this recipe!

Good Recipe, but I would leave out the bacon next time - wayyyy to smokey /earthy of a flavor - added lemon juice to compensate

My husband loves this! My only change is adding a can of black or navy beans. I see some people do the rice separately. I'll add the rice if there is enough room in the pot but cook it separate if not. I like it both ways.

Really really good jambalaya - I followed the recipe exactly (mushy texture doesn't bother us) and used a cajun seasoning from this site.

This was very good.  I added the rice cooked at the end like others suggested.  I think because of this there was too much juice.  Added jalapenos.  Flavor was GREAT.  My kids loved it.

Was Declicious.. I was going back and forth between cooking the rice separately or as instructed.. I just  ended up going as instructed and turned out great!

The rice sucks in all the flavor..

this was wonderful!!!
I omitted the bacon, used brown rice (cooked into the dish, not separately), homemade cajun seasoning and added peas. Everyone came back for more. Definitely a keeper!

This is still my favourite jambalaya recipe!!  I follow it almost exactly (we're meat lovers so we just about double those), and it turns out perfect every time :)  Also addicted to garlic so added plenty of minced fresh to the vegetable step.  Awesome recipe, thanks!! :D

This was amazing!  I wanted to cook my rice sepereate so I used half the amount of broth and let it simmer uncovered for 20 minutes.  My boyfriend loved it he had 2 servings and kept the leftovers all too himself!

Loved this recipe! Did apply some of the suggestions from others. I used a crock pot. I increased the meat a little. Cooked all the meats in some of the sauce before adding to the crock pot. Left the rice, shrimp, and bacon until the end. Turned out great! This will be added to our rotation at home.

This was THE. BEST. JAMBALAYA. I've ever had. Hands down. Period. I tweaked it a bit and left out the chicken and ham (too much meat) and used 2 lbs. of local sausage (Conecuh...YUM) and 1 lb. of frozen baby shrimp instead. It was absolutely perfect. It fed all my friends for the national championship game...and there wasn't a grain of rice left! Perfect dish for any social event! Thanks, Bubba!!

I love this recipe. I make it all the time. I use one pound of smoked sausage and leave out the ham because it's just easier. I add a jalapeno or two and more spices. Sometimes I use only one type of broth depending on what I have available in my pantry. I cook the rice separately but I don't adjust the liquids in the soup/stew and it's perfect. For some reason, my rice always get sticky and soft in the leftovers and I don't care for that.

I followed the recipe pretty much exactly the first time I made it and it was very good.......good enough you really don't need to make any changes.

I just made it again and this time I used Andouille sausage and smoked the sausage and chicken breast in the grill with some hickory wood. It really added a great touch having the extra smoked flavor!!
Oh...I almost forgot....I used medium sized cocktail shrimp this time also....much better then the little salad shrimp.

My first time making Jambabalya!! This is great - I eliminated the bacon at the end because my butcher gave me one that was way too salty but I did use cook it and use the fat from it.  This is for dinner tonight but looks like we're eating it for lunch too - we just can't wait!

The whole family(including a picky 9 yr old)loved it.  Check the tenderness of the rice at 15 mins because real close to overcooked.

What a great recipe!  I did end up substituting the shrimp and ham (not a big fan) with more chicken and sausage.  It still came out fantastic...so flavorful!  It has now become my go-to jambalaya recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious! I made a lot of substitutions, I had no bell pepper so I skipped it, I used bouillon cubes instead of broth, I used boil in a bag brown rice and had no cajun seasoning so I used 1/2 tsp each of cayenne, oregano, black pepper and paprika and some kosher salt. My kids devoured it!

My daughter and I really enjoyed this meal - YUM!!  Like many of you, I cooked the rice separately.  We like it spicy, so I added red pepper flake and a little paprika.  I even tossed in 2 snow crab clusters toward the end for added seafood depth. Another reviewer stuffed bell pepper with the leftovers. Very smart...I'll be using my remaining 1/2 orange and red peppers for tomorrows dinner.  Thanks Bubba!

Very tasty, I only used 3 slices of bacon because 6 just seemed like overkill with all the other meats that are used. This is also good put inside a flour tortilla.

I've made this several times and found it enjoyable every time. A few suggestions for those who think there's too many tomatoes: Add one can diced tomatoes, and one can Rotel, it cuts down on the tangy-ness and adds an extra "kick".

Although we forgot the shrimp the meal wasn't completely ruined. We decided to add the bacon as a crunchy tasteful topping. Also, instead of the 2 teaspoons of the Cajun spice 4 teaspoons was added for an extra kick. Thank you Bubba for your Jambablaya!

My family loves this recipe. I made a few changes though. Instead of crushed tomatoes I used Rotel, I added a 12oz. can of tomato sauce and I also added a Bay Leaf. I didn't add the rice either. One of my son's likes a lot of rice, while my other son prefers his almost like a  soup, so he adds just a little rice.

I can't believe I've been making this and haven't stopped to review it yet. I make it EXACTLY as written and it is AWESOME!  The bacon and smoked sausage (I even use lite and it's fine) really adds to the flavor of this dish and we have zero complaints.  I literally don't think I could improve upon this if I wanted to. Now...to convert this recipe for brown rice, that's the only thing (and that wouldn't make it tastier, just a healthy-household thing)!  Also will not add salt next time and add it to taste at the end.

I made this lastnight and it was great. I thought it was going to be too spicy for my 5 year old but he ate it up and even asked for me. Next time I might add more tomatoe for the coloring or either try it in a crockpot, the smell filled the house.. yummy!!!

This was SO SO GOOD! I made it a healthy version and used lean turkey ham, Jennie o lean smoked turkey sausage and used brown rice opposed to white. It was AMAZING! I kept the bacon as i thought  the drippings were important to cook the vegetables.  Will definitely serve this again

This was a huge hit in our family. Very tasty with just enough kick for our taste. Next time I will prepare the ingredients the night before to expedite things.

This recipe was amazing! It was easy and delicious. I did improvise a few ingredients because I did not have some of them. For green bell peppers I used yellow, I did omit the ham as I had none, I used turkey bacon instead of pork, and I used "Better than Bouillon" Beef base for the beef broth. I have to say I was VERY PLEASED with the outcome. My family loved it and this will become one of our normal dishes. It's also very clean eating. Thank you for sharing!  Marie

My boyfriend and I loved this.  I had to substitute a few items because I didn't have all the ingredients.  Omitted the celery and the peppers, added a finely chopped carrot or two, used stewed tomatoes instead of crushed, all chicken broth no beef, and used imitation crab instead of shrimp.  also used an extra half teaspoon of cajun seasoning and added a pinch of red pepper flakes.  It turned out delish!

Delicious! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly as it was, with one time-saving difference. I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green peppers and celery instead of adding these ingredients separately. My husband raved about the result, and he's usually pretty picky!

This recipe was super easy and tasty! Didn't have bacon but I did save some bacon grease from breakfast over the weekend which added a great smoky flavor to the vegetables. Used smoked turkey sausage, chicken and shrimp - all seasoned with cajun seasoning before browning in the pan. Since it was just the two of us, I kept all of the meat and vegetable amounts the same but only used 3/4 C of uncooked rice and 1 1/2 C water (with two chicken bouillon cubes). This gave it a great consistency, not gummy like other reviewers mentioned. Also made it a little more spicy by adding hot sauce at the end. Served with a lemon wedge and fresh parsley. I definitely recommend the lemon. Thanks for the great recipe!

I didn't have any ham, so I doubled the chicken, used 3/4 lb. sausage and medium shrimp.  Also went heavy on the cajun seasoning and added hot pepper sauce for some extra kick.  This was a hit with the family.  Excellent recipe!

I did not have bacon or ham. I use andouille sausage and left over cooked chicken. I added a couple of shakes of tabasco. It did take the rice a bit longer to cook. My hubbie loved it, I thought it was good and even my kids liked it.

This recipe was great.  The only change I made was leaving out the dried thyme.  I used Tony Checeries (or however it's spelled) for the Cajun Seasoning.  I will cook it again.

Outstanding recipe.  I used brown rice instead of white which increased the cooking time a bit.  I also added a bit of cayenne for an extra kick.  It was delicious!

Most excellent Christmas Eve dish that the whole family made together.  We followed the recipe but added a total of 1 pound of shrimp and tossed in a half pound of bay scallops too.  Very delicious and quick to put together after a late afternoon Christmas vigil Mass.  Lovely!

YUM!  I am not a 'cook' and so rarely switch things in recipes - however, it sometimes arises out of availability - not taking creative licence on a recipe...  for example, I didn't have any chicken or shrimp so I skipped it.  And I used green, red and orange peppers (not just green).  But other than that, I made the recipe as written and it is a big hit.  We were a little worried as there seems to be a lot of meat even skipping the others, and hubby prefers less rather than more meat - but he loved it and this recipe will now be rotated in to our regular menu!

Really flavourful!  For ease and to save time, we used real bacon bits instead of frying bacon, omitted the ham, used turkey sausage, 2 cups of cooked brown rice (left over from the night before), 2 cups of tomato sauce and 1 cup of chicken broth and added everything to the slow cooker.  Cooked it on low for 6 hours and added uncooked shrimp the last 5 to 10 minutes.  It was sooooo tasty.  The rice was a bit over done so next time I'll try using uncooked rice and all the liquid like the recipe says but still in the crockpot.  Thanks Fordman!!

This was an extremely good meal!  I put in extra chicken and sausages and every bite had something different to it.  The rice was a little soggy for me, but it may be because I used calrose rice (which was all I had in stock).  I am looking for an opportunity to make this again!

This was excellent! My husband spent a few years of his life in the south and said that it was just what he was looking for. The balance of taste was just perfect, and I could adapt the recipe to suit what ingredients I did and did not have on hand as needed.

Was awesome! Needed something to help me kick a cold. Cut recipe in half. Subbed out bacon grease for 1tbsp margarine, added some bacon bits to keep flavor. Used turkey smoked sausage. Flavor was excellent! I feel almost 100%!

Great recipe! I tripled it and served it to a crowd. It was a huge hit. It fiilled an All Clad 12 Qt Casserole. Used brown rice so I added a bit more liquid. As the brown cooks for about 40 minutes, I added the meats after 20. Will make again and again.

Really tasty!  I agree that it makes a ton, even halved.  My stomach churned at the thought of that much meat, so I just used sausage and shrimp (pre-cooked, added at the end), and it turned out great.

This was great! Easy to make, but it makes a ton.  I halved the recipes and it was still way too much. I cooked the vegetables in butter and I had tomato sauce left over and threw that in.  I didn't let the shrimp cook long enough in the jambalaya, but I think next time I'll saute them first

Great meal for everyone, I added 4 cloves of crushed garlic just because I love the stuff and needed to add water to help the rice cook properly but otherwise followed it to the letter and it turned out great.

I used pre-diced veggies and ham from the market (OK...I'm lazy) and followed this verbatim.  Delicious!  I made as a side dish with grilled flank steak, but the steak went virtually untouched.  If you have the ingredients prepped ahead of timeyo u could make this a weekday staple, but the prep takes a good 30 mins, so best reserved for a weekend quick dish.  Great for a fall football game.  Forget pizza.  Us guys are doing Bubba's Jambalaya and Notre Dame football this fall!!!  Great job, Fordman88!!!!!!

Delicious!  You can make it with good old Spam, too (believe it or not) instead of ham.

Really really good! Never will buy boxed again. I usually buy the rice and then add everything to it anyway to make it my own. Much less work to just do it from scratch. I did leave out the ham and chicken and added more shrimp. Also added a bit more spice cuz the family likes spicy food. Great recipe though. I cooked it as it and did not have a prob with the rice and I even simmer it longer cuz hubby was late from work. so good though you wont be dissapointed.

I halved the recipe and thought it turned out really great!  I use more tomato and 1/2 cup more rice.  I also kept the lid on tight for 25 minutes.  The rice came out perfect.  I will probably use more seasoning next time, but it was still VERY tasty!  Thanks, Bubba!

i didnt add chicken, so i added a little extra of the ham and sausage.  the recipe didnt completely cook down - it was still kinda soupy.  i did halve the recipe, so maybe that contributed to the reason.  the dish was good, but nothing outstanding.  i wont make it again  cos my family just didnt care for it.  i would add a little more seasoning to it though - like old bay or something.  seemed like it just needed a little more.  a recipe worth a try though. thanks!

I never made jambalaya before and was little nervous about making it, but my hubby loves it so I gave it a try. I couldn't believe how simple of a recipe it was. I used Bobak's hot and spicy sausage and just used bit of bacon fat and bit of butter. No bacon. The house smelled heavenly. We loved it! My husband kept making yummy noises throughout the whole meal :) This is a keeper!

Perfect!! Exactly what I was looking for. I put extra seasoning in it and next time will put about 2/3 the rice because I like a little less.

I give this recipe 5 stars HOWEVER I try to eat healthy so I made some big changes to cut fat/calories... still GREAT! First, I cut out the bacon and ham (not needed). Simply cooked the veggies in olive oil and a crushed clove of garlic.  Next, I used a mixture of Cajun flavored chicken sausage and turkey kielbasa instead of regular sausage.  Finally, I doubled the amount of thyme and cajun seasoning (I like flavor) and also added some garlic salt, salt and old bay. Good luck!!!!

This is one of the best Jambalaya recipies I have tried.  I made it for the crew of my tugboat and it was a big hit.  I did 'heat' it up though by adding 2 teaspoons of cayenne and 2 Tbs of Frank's red hot.  Plenty to go around too.

I followed the recipe EXCEPT, I didn't add onion. I added a little bit of cayenne pepper also. I put everything in the slow cooker(except bacon, rice and shrimp) for a few hours and then added the rest the last hour. I don't know how anyone is saying this recipe is bland. It is QUITE spicy.

This recipe was the best.  My husband does not care for too spicy foods but he loved this dish.  I left out the ham for my own personal preference and actually added more of the cajun seasoning and a little bit of the tabasco per another reviewer.  It was wonderful!!!

This is absolutely wonderful and not too spicy.  I did use mid hot pablano peppers and it was still not too hot.  I only had the choice of one type of spanish sausage and next time, I will take the outside skin off of it as it doesn't cook up.  But otherwise it is a wonderful recipe.  I do hope lots of you will try it.  Beverly

Never made jambalaya before so I followed the recipe as written except... I put everything except the rice, shrimp and bacon in a slow cooker for 4 hours.  Then added the rest for another hour.  Turned out great!  Next time I think I'll do it on the stove to save time.

Very good.  Mom's of boys, you must try this recipe, I was pleasantly surprised by their (pre and teen) desire to have this dish again.

This was great even without the ham, bacon, and shrimp. It was a little bland for our taste but we also love spicy foods. The beef broth gave a nice rich flavor. This is a keeper!!

I made a low fat version of this recipe with chicken breasts, hot turkey sausage, turkey bacon, and shrimp.  It was delicious!  I had to add olive oil to sautee the vegetables since the turkey bacon didn't render any fat.  I also used brown rice and had to cook it an hour longer than the recipe called for.  I wish that I had had okra to add to it to add a little more of the vegetable element.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was very good.  Besides all the chopping, it was very easy to make.  I left out the bacon and just used vegetable oil to saute the veggies.  I also made the rice separately, then added towards the end, and it turned out great.  The leftovers are great too.

Good. I used brown rice and it took forever to cook. It took about an hour and half.  I used turkey bacon and I think the bacon flavor didn't really come through. Used red pepper instead of green since we aren't green pepper fans.

I didn't use any meat on this dish, only shrimp. I also added fresh rosemary and Texmati brown rice. Even with all these changes it turned out delicious.

This was great. Had guests for dinner. They were impressed. My teenage son was still talking about it this morning. I added anaheim pepper, 1 small jalapeno pepper seeded and chopped and a yellow pepper. I used uncooked shrimp and put that in with the rice to add flavor. I also made my own cajun seasoning and included a bay leaf. At the end I added okra. Just amazing flavors. Thanks for the post. Can't wait for leftovers.

Really good jambalaya!! I like spicy foods and my kids don't... the kids loved it (could have been a little hotter). I also had to add a 1/2 cup more rice. I didn't like the idea of the uncooked rice but it worked!!

This was great.  Very easy to make and very versatile.  My husband thought it needed some spice (hence the four stars).  I will add some chopped jalapenos next time for a kick.

Fantastic!  I modified it just a little.  After cooking the bacon, I added cut up chicken & sausage and cooked that, removed it from the pan and added my vegetables and then proceeded with the recipe.  I also used only about 1 1/4 cups rice and ended up adding about 2 1/2 cups of water as we prefer our jambalaya a little more on the soupy side (and it was still thick).

Thanks Bubba! Out of this world....better than I've had at even the best cajun places. I have a ton of ham to use up from Easter, and am looking for some different ways to use it up. I have to admit, I did omit the bacon because I didn't have any, and used olive oil to sautee the veggies. My hubby never goes back for seconds (tiny appetite!) but he's stuffed himself full of this. We are self proclaimed chili heads, so I added a few drops of my X rated hot sauce. This is superb!!

Very good recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, expect for the fact that I adjusted the recipe to four servings. My husband and I loved it! We have plenty of leftovers.  It is rather time consuming to cook the chicken, bacon and sausage, but well worth it. Also, I added a tiny bit more of Cajun spice b/c I like things spicy. Thanks for sharing!

I found this recipe bland. I simmered it for 2 1/2 hours and it still was not very flavorful. If I used this recipe again, I would double the cajun seasoning and use a lot more spices.

We love this recipe, especially on cold days!  It makes a great hearty one pot meal and it's easy.  I use an apple chicken sausage because we like the balance of the sweet with the spicy. This one is going in the favorites box!!

This is a great basic recipe.  I didn't change much.  The only thing was I used turkey keilbasa instead of the traditional andouille in order to cut down on the fat (trying to keep my husband healthy).  Boyohboy did I miss that andouille.  But husband didn't miss it at all.  He thought it was fantastic.  Thanks for sharing.

This was really good - used okra instead of celery and used andouille sausage and brown rice but left out the shrimp (I missed it...).  I think next time I'll use the shrimp and leave out the ham (doesn't really add much).  Also added a dash more cajun seasoning.  Not the best jambalaya recipe ever, but really good flavor for being so quicky and easy!

This dish was pretty good. I left out the bacon and used whole peeled tomatoes I cut into peices (I thought I didn't have any crushed tomatoes). I simmered for 2 hours before adding the rice. The taste was really good, although next time I will use fresh shrimp. I will season and steam them first because simmering for 5 minutes at the end isn't long enough for the spices to kick in.
