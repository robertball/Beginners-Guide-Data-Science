I have made this a couple of times now and think it is wonderful. I do have quickie version that developed from this recipe. I hope this will help someone in a bind or in a hurry. First I shred chicken from a rotisserie chicken. Then for the filling I take salsa and strain out all the liquid and add the “dry salsa” to the chicken> I probably strain a cup to a cup and half. I also chop half of an onion and add that in. Then for the sauce I prefer just mixing the sour cream and jalapeno salsa. Spoon the chicken mixture into flour tortillas. Pour a little sauce into the pan then your enchiladas and the rest of the sauce on top and lots of Mexican blend cheese. This is my quick and easy version of this recipe! It tastes so, so good. I garnish with shredded lettuce, fresh tomatoes, and guacamole. Yum! Yum!

The green salsa I used was HOT, but my boyfriend who is of Mexican decent said he thought the dish was better than his grandmother's enchilladas made with red salsa. "5 STARS!!! and this is the food of my people, so I should know!" (His grandmother is from Mexico and makes corn tortillas by hand, so I used corn tortillas rather than flour, to try to get closer to a true flavor of his childhood comfort food.) 

...One *recommendation*: if you have two fat-trimmed chicken breasts (on bone or deboned, whichever) you can put them in a sauce pot with 2 cups chicken broth, a crushed clove of garlic, 1/4 of an onion and 2 tsp salt. Bring to boil, then simmer 20-35 mins (longer for large bone-in). Discard onion and garlic, reserve flavorful broth for something else, set chicken aside to cool. When cool enough, the chicken will pull apart easily and it's a great way of quickly preparing flavorful, very moist chicken that doesn't dry out.

... ASLO, WARNING - before you dump a jar of salsa in with your sour cream and cilantro, give it a taste. Salsa can be "off", as in sour/bad - even if it's been in an air-tight jar (this has happened to me), or the brand/heat level may not be to your liking. The flavor of the salsa will determine whether you like this recipe or not.

Want to know how to make the tortillas not get "mushy"?  Fry them for about 1 minute in oil~corn or canola. It adds a little fat but it stops the mushy problem. I used to make all enchiladas as this recipe states (no frying tortillas) and couldn't figure out why they were always mushy.  Even corn tortillas have a better texture when fried for a minute ;)

I love this recipe! I have made it so many ways, depending on what I have on hand (or can find at my small, rural grocery store). I through the entire bunch of cilantro into the blender for the best flavor (stems and all), and have used green enchilada sauce, green salsa, and jalapeno salsa for all 28 ounces of the salsa. I have found that the flavor is a bit different, but always good no matter what I use. I have also used mozarella cheese, monteray jack, or cheddar, and it tastes good with each! To SHRED THE CHICKEN, boil a few breasts in water with some salt, pepper, and garlic powder (or plain is fine too) for about 20 minutes if thawed, longer if frozen, and use either 2 forks or fingers to shred it up. You can just cut up a chicken and use chunks, too. We love this recipe, and the kids like it too, as long as I keep my green salsa mild. Have fun! You can do lots with this recipe and it still tastes good!!!

This is a fantastic recipe for enchiladas, and I would definitely make it again. The only change I made was to use Herdez brand salsa Mexicana in place of the jalapeno salsa, and it still provided plenty of heat. The sauce is definitely what makes this dish, I even kept a little aside to use as a dip with tortilla chips. My (and husband's) only complaint is that the onion in the filling was still crunchy after baking, so I'd leave that out or maybe use green onions.

We ate these three meals in a row and I don't even like leftovers!  We used whole wheat tortillas and low fat sour cream to health 'em up a little.  Skipped the jalepeno salsa since the salsa verde we used was already spicy.  Also used 1/2 the amount of cheese and they were still great.

I rarely give anything a five star but overall this was fabulous. It was so hearty and delicious. I let my boyfriend have some and he loved it and asked to take some left overs with him. (which he rarely does) This one is a keeper. I love cilantro so the cilantro cream sauce was awesome. I will make this again. For a complete meal goes excellent with Spanish Flan for dessert on this Web site.

Wow! This was really super. The whole family just loved it. It really had so much flavor. I did cook the chicken with garlic in chicken stock with the onions so they were soft. Already added it to my recipe box.

This has become my go-to recipe--with some changes.  I used fat free sour cream and Ortega green sauce instead of jalepeno salsa.  I added 1/2 packet taco seasoning to give it a little more flavor.  Next I added 2 small cans green chilis instead of green chili salsa as well as a few roasted red peppers and blended everything together (cilantro included).  I stuck the blender in the fridge and let the flavors mix overnight.  The next day, for the filling I sauteed the onion with one small can green chilis.  I added one can drained and rinsed black beans and one can refried beans, as well as the remaining 1/2 packet of taco seasoning to the onions/chili mix.  I microwaved a few vegetarian 'chicken' patties and chopped them up and added them to the filling mixture, then filled up each enchilada, smothered them in sauce, and baked (covered--so important!).  I've made this recipe for a dinner party of 14 and everyone loved it.  Plus I make it for my fiance and myself weekly.  Its nice to have the sauce made the night before because the flavors meld and it makes cooking this after work so much easier!  Thanks for the great idea :)

The tortillas got very soggy and gummy.  I thing these would likely be better with corn tortillas.   Also, I couldn't find "jalapeno salsa" and I live in Texas.  I may try these again w/ corn torts, and come back to change the number of stars.  Also, I think Jack cheese would be far better.

I was born and raised in Texas and consider myself a bit of a mexican food snob.  Enchiladas should be made with corn tortillas not flour. These were so full of favor!  I used green chile enchilada sauce as I could not find the green chili salsa.  After reading the other reviews, I did not add all the cilantro called for and it was perfect. I also sauted my onions a little as I don't like to bite into raw onions when eating enchiladas.  I will for sure make these again but will add some fresh garlic.

these are great! i've been making pretty much the same enchilada recipe for years... the only difference is that i add @ least 5 garlic cloves to the green chile mixture. the garlic brings out the onion & jalapeno. i also tried w/o garlic & still came out delicious!

We had a big family get together tonight and made these enchiladas for the first time. It was amazing! I did cut back on the jalapeno salsa though because we had younger children eating them. I used 1 can of the jalapeno salsa with 3 cans of the salsa verde. They still had some kick to them but were great for our kids. I doubled the recipe and it all came out perfect. This is definitely our go to recipe for chicken enchildas!

I made these for dinner last night and they were AMAZING! Both me and my husband are Mexican and we agreed that these tasted as authentic as any our garndmothers ever made. I planned to bring the leftovers to work this morning but there weren't any, everyone went back for seconds and thirds. Truly a delicious and authentic tasting recipe, and super easy to make. Thanks so much for sharing.

This was a great, super easy recipe. I don't own a food processor so I chopped the cilantro and mixed it by hand with green salsa. I omitted the jalapeno salsa all together. I broiled this for the last couple of minutes to make the top slightly crispy and served with a side of re-fried beans. Great dish!!

** UPDATE **

I have made this recipe sooo many times that I had to up my rating to 5 stars. It's filling, cheap and re-heats well for a delicious lunch the next day!

DELISH!!! I used fat free sour cream, corn tortillas, added corn and chopped garlic to the chicken mixture and extra green chillies. I also had some extra baby spinach that I needed to use so I added it to the sauce to thicken it up.... YUMMY!!! I can't wait to make it again!

I have made these enchiladas a couple of times now and I must say that I really love them as does my family. I just had to tweak them a bit to suit our taste. I only use 1 can of the jalapeno sauce, otherwise it would be too spicy for my family and I use corn tortillas instead of flour. After reading a few reviews that the sour cream mixture did not look too appetizing poured over the enchiladas, I decided to marinate the chicken in this mixture instead of pouring it on top and the result was great. The chicken gets a great flavor from this mixture and stays very moist, then I just pour the rest of the green sauce on top of the enchiladas and they taste great and look beautiful! I serve these with spanish rice and top them with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes and one last dollop of sour cream and we are in heaven!! Thanks for the recipe!!

We live in New Mexico and like our enchiladas hot.  I added 1/2 can green enchilada sauce to both the bottom of casserole & on the top of rolled enchilada. To ingredients I added 1 whole seeded & chopped jalapeno pepper; 4oz chopped green chili; 1T jar minced garlic; and 2tsp cumin seed powder. After baking 30 min I uncovered the casserole and added 2 cups total of shredded jalapeno flavored & colby/jack cheeses and returned dish to oven 5 minutes more until melted.   Serve with sour cream, diced tomatoes & shred lettuce,  and slices of ripe avocado.  Note: leftovers tend to be spicier the next day.

These were really good enchiladas.  I did use corn tortillas as suggested by others.  I could not find green chile salsa so I just used regular in addition to the jalpeno salsa.  I did not use anywhere the amount of jalapeno salsa stated in the recipe and they were spicy enough for my family.  I used about 3/4 of one 7 oz. can.  I also added sour cream to the chickem mixture before I rolled the tortillas.  The sauce is excellent, it does start out pretty thin but I think it was too thick after baking.  I suggest reserving some of the sauce to pour on top after the enchiladas have baked.  Additionally, I think two cups of cheese is way too much, next time I will probably use only half that amount.  All in all, this was a wonderful and easy recipe.  I will definately make this again.

I modified this recipe quite a bit and it was good both times.  I used half the amount of jalapenos and green chilis.  I used rotel in the chicken mixture, and substituted low fat sour cream.  i reccomend taking the foil off at least 5 minutes before the end so the cheese can get firm.  I will surely make this again and again!

I made this tonight, I did do some tweeking as I did not have chilies or the type of salsa you are talking about.  I put chicken in pot shreaded, added chopped cilantro, 3 garlic cloves minced, 1 tsp chilli powder, 1 tsp. cumin, plus the onion, I probably had about 1/4 cup chicken stock, let that simmer on low all day so the flavors would mix.  I used lowfat sourcream and then I added what salsa I had here and the cilantro, I also chopped a 1/4 green pepper, banana pepper and another mild pepper (I had them in freezer from the garden).   I then filled the wheat tortillas with chicken mixture, added some cheese and some of the sour cream mixture.  I then folded seam side down and top with the sourcream mixture and the cheddar cheese. My son loved it, said it was better than the restaurant.  To the poster below, use what spices your family likes, mine did not have much heat to it at all but did have flavor.

These were pretty good.  I did add one can of black beans to increase fiber and I love them.  Other than that, everything was the same.  I would make again, but would also try more recipes to see if I liked them a little more.

These were pretty good. I might make them again, they are easy, but a bit spicy for my young kids. I have developed a recipe for enchiladas suiza that I think is much better than this, but it is also MUCH more time consuming and this tasted relatively close and was easier and quicker...(I make my own home-made roasted tomatillo salsa (with roasted poblanos, jalapenos and garlic), Monterey Jack cheese sauce and slow cook the chicken)But, like I said, these were pretty good and I will probably experiment with the sour cream sauce.

The reviews for this dish were so great, I didn't even bother to look at the reviews with a low rating....what a mistake! These were HORRIBLE! Definitely scale WAY back on the cilantro. And just like the reviewers before me stated, I love cilantro.

I adore this recipe, but I make a few changes: 1.5 times the sour cream (fat free), shredded chicken I make from slow cooked skinless boneless breasts and thighs, and replace jalapeno salsa  (which I've never found) with 1 can mild green chiles, and some extra verde salsa.  I also add some extra veggies to the chicken when I have them on hand (bell peppers, shredded carrots, etc.) This recipe gets raves from friends and family.

This was a great base for us, I wanted to share our variations-as I didn't have all the ingrediants it called for on hand. I substituted just a few things, and my husband had three helpings! I used 1 16oz can of red Enchilada sauce for the jalapeno salsa, and 1 16oz can of green chili's, not green salsa. We prefer corn tortilla's and I used jalapeno jack cheese alongside the cheddar, to round out the 2 cups. To the sour cream mixture I added 3 quick cooked fresh jalepeno's and pureed them in my food processor. I used the leftover Beer Can Chicken we had from the night before, and I ended up with 20 total, 2 lg. pans. Definitely fun in your mouth!!

Corn tortillas are much better(authentic) We don't like the sauce quite so hot so I use less jalapeno salsa and add 2-3 cans of chopped green chiles and several cloves of minced garlic. Jack cheese or a combination of Jack and Colby melts and tastes better than Cheddar.  This is a good recipe to adjust to your own taste.

Very yummy recipe!  I love cilantro, so these were really good.  They are quick, easy, and a nice change from the usual enchiladas.  I do use corn tortillas, though, because flour tortillas tend to get too gummy for my taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fantastic dish!  (i am eating it now for lunch again...mmmm!)
Here's another idea:
I made this as a "lasagne" instead of rolling each enchilada, and used small corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas.  Try it - it's great!  Place some of the sour cream mixture in the bottom of the baking dish, layer 6 corn tortillas on top of that, place half the chicken mixture in next, pour some more sour cream mixture over the chicken, then repeat. 
Thanks, Brenda, for submitting this one - my family and I will enjoy this at LEAST once a month!    ;0)     ~chanelle

Great recipe! I couldn't find the jalapeno 
salsa or green chile salsa, but was able 
to substitute bottled green chile sauce 
and jalapeno pepper slices. 
Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe!

I used leftover Carne Adovada in this recipe instead of plain shredded chicken. This was a nice way to reuse leftover meat combined with pantry ingredients I already had on hand. With mexican rice and homemade refried beans, this was very economical and filling for the whole family.

I thought this recipe was very good. I followed the recipe exactly. It has a very strong onion flavor, so if onions aren't your thing, I'd recommend not adding it. My husband hates onions, therefore he asked me never to make this again. My coworker loves onions and devoured the leftovers.

This recipe was my first attempt at enchiladas. It was alright. I feel like the filling in the enchiladas needed more, but I'm not sure what. I'll keep searching for another recipe.

I'm so excited to have this recipe, thank you! It's unbelievably authentic which is hard to find! I only changed the recipe because I couldn't find some of the ingredients :o( I bought green salsa which has jalapenos and tomatillos instead of green chiles so I added a can of diced green chiles to the mix. The only way this seemed to affect the recipe was to make it very hot since I had jalapenos in both kinds of salsa I used!! I will make this again without a doubt but will continue my search for green chile salsa :o) Note: I sauteed the onion and used three chicken breasts to make eight large flour enchiladas instead of 12 small ones, Yum!

These were so good! Very easy to make. I made mine earlier in the day and put them in the fridge.  Would be easy to make them the night before as well. Just add 10 minutes or so to the cooking time to adjust for the fridge.

I did make some modifications to the recipe so it was not as spicy for the kids inclusing adding 1 cup each of sour cream and cheese to the filling and reducing the hot salsa that I added.  But the combination of flavors was a hit.  One of my boys does not like Mexican food and even he liked it.  The kids ate the left overs the next day on Ritz crackers.

This was okay.  If you want to make some good enchiladas try "Four Seasons Enchiladas" or "Chicken Enchiladas V" from this site.  Both of these recipes are MUCH better than this one.

I prefer to spice up the chicken with cumin, chili powder, and garlic, then bake smothered in the White Cheese Sauce from this site.  You do have to only use half of the butter in the White Cheese Sauce.

It was really good, but a little too spicy for my or my family's taste.  So instead of the jalepeno salsa, I use a mild salsa.

Would be better with much less cilantro and 1 bunch of chopped green onions.  Enchiladas are made with corn tortillas, burritos are made with flour!  These are burritos...and it has nothing to do with your preference. You don't grill a chicken breast, slap it on a bun and call it a hamburger...these are burritos, use corn tortillas if you want to make 'enchiladas'!.  You will need to fry the tortillas in hot oil for a few seconds so they will not break when filling and rolling.  Flour tortillas will just turn to mush in this recipe as noted by other comments, go figure.  AND, will you all please learn how to use the words 'to' and 'too'

Too much pepper flavor hid the other flavors.  If I make it again, I will likely not mix much pepper salsa in the sour cream, or use some tomato based salsa too.

This was not for me. Tortillas were mushy and I was not liking the sour cream sauce. It was very heavy and recipe makes an overwhelming amount. The traditional red sauce is more my speed. However, my son and hubby loved it. Had lots of heat from the jalapeño salsa. Also 8oz of cheese is plenty.

Wholy Moley that was delicious. A++ to the person who wrote that one. The only change I made was to saute the onions in a little bit of light olive oil just because it makes the flavor come out.

Really good!! I didn't use a blender or food processor, just stirred them and it turned out great. I sauteed the onions and added put them in the tortillas and put more on top-I like extra onions.

I made this last night for a birthday party and everyone LOVED it! I got so many compliments and requests for the recipe. I followed a couple of other users' suggestions and boiled the chicken breasts in chicken broth, garlic and onion, which made for easy shredding. I also noticed that several people commented that the onions in the finished product tend to be too crunchy, so I sauteed them in a small amount of olive oil prior to adding them to the chicken mixture. The jalapeno salsa was very hot, but the more mild green salsa helped to balance it out for the perfect level of spiciness. The end product was absolutely delicious!! I will definitely be making this again!

We loved this!  Even my brother-in-law, who is not excitable, exclaimed that it was GREAT!  I didn't use all of the salsa and that was a mistake though, it wasn't spicy enough for us.  I also used Land o Lakes White American cheese b/c thats what our favorite mexican resturant uses and it's wonderful!  We also tried it with hamburger and you need to add a little more spice!  Keeper!!!!

these were very good ... I used corn tortillas because they are healthier. 
I didn't change anything else. And i love it.  The cilantro was alittle overwhelming but it was still very good. I wanted it to be more cheesy but to keep it healthy I didn't do it.

These were GREAT. The only thing I would do differently is sautee the onions before mixing them in with the chicken. Other than that, I thought they were fabulous. Can't wait to make them again.

I thought this recipe was good. A little too strong of a cilantro taste to me and I even added extra sour cream and salsa. I would make this again with some variations, but it's an easy go-to recipe. I would definitely recommend using corn tortillas as opposed to flour tortillas though. The flour tortillas get very gummy with all the sauce.

Was pretty good. I've always liked chicken enchiladas. The sour cream sounded intriguing. The only thing I'd change is the flour tortillas. Corn tortillas might have been better. After a while, the flour tortillas tend to get soggy. I also added some pico de gallo to it.

I love this recipe.  I made my own salsas and believe me the fresher the better and they are so easy to make if you have a blender. One consideration though...be careful of the type of cheddar you use. Extra sharp cheddar is not a good cheddar to use.  Other than that this recipe is simple and tasty.

very good! i nixed the cilantro (as my fiance doesn't care for it) and i chopped up pickled jalapenos to use instead of the jalapeno salsa (bc that's all i had on hand!) and it was still delicious! i have to say that boiling the chicken breasts in chicken broth for about 20-30 minutes made for incredibly moist chicken that was easy to pull apart.

Wow! This dish was full of flavor! I was a little skeptical because I couldn't find the 7 oz cans of jalepeno salsa or cans of green chili salsa. I ended up using a jar of salsa verda and another jar of salsa verde with jalepenos!  The flavor was amazing! It had just the right amount of spice for my taste. Perfect! It was really easy to make also. Of course, you can make it even quicker if you buy a rotissire chicken. This one is a keeper!

I increased the salsa by about 4 oz. The resulting quantity of sauce was far more than 4 oz. overdone; in the future I will only make half the cream sauce. I cooked my chicken halves in my slow cooker with a little adobo seasoning; in the future I will cook the diced onion in there too, because I found the crunchy onion to be a little odd. The flavor, however, was great! For those concerned the cream sauce will be unappealing looking...that's only true if you don't puree the cilantro. The cilantro is such a vivid shade of green that it tints the whole sauce a lovely minty green, no matter how revolting a shade of green your salsa verde is. I use an immersion blender to make the sauce; so easy, and nothing but a bowl and the blender blade to clean! It IS a little high on the cilantro flavor and I used just the top half of the bunch (the leafy bits, I discard the stems as a rule). When I make this again I'll bulk up the chicken mixture with some brown rice and black beans. 5 stars from us, thanks for the recipe!

These were a little mushy and a little too hot but they weren't bad.  I always like to make a recipe as written the first time around so that I can rate it honestly.  The flavor has great intentions.  I will make these again using corn tortillas to avoid the mushiness and use 1/2 the jalapeno salsa to cut the spice.

These are the best enchiladas ever. You can easily substitute ingredients with whatever you have on hand. Got some canned mushrooms? sure! toss them with the cooked chicken. Only have red salsa? That's yummy as well.

Not bad...but not great. I guess we're not big fans of cilantro and that's pretty much all you can taste. Edible but I won't be making it again.

I rarely write a review but these were VERY delicious.  I live in a small rural community and couldn't find the exact ingredients so I subsititued 2 cans of mild rotel tomatoes for the jalapeno salsa and green chili verde for the other.  I love hot stuff but was afraid my son and husband might stick their noses in the air.  I chopped my onion in a food processor after reading reviews of being too chunky.  My 16 year old son said they were REALLY good about 4 times.  He went back for seconds and devoured what was left!  Always makes me happy when he likes it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Good recipe.  I made this last night and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  The only addition I made was that I sauteed some green onion and white onions and added them to the chicken mixture.  I am adding this to my keep box.

Very good. Then only thing I plan on changing for next time is using a bit less cilantro.  I also improvised on the jalapeno slasa due to the fact that I couldn't find any.

This recipe is much better if you make it in layers instead of rolled up.  After starting with the sauce to cover the bottom, I then used 3 layers of tortillas, chicken mixture (added olives -- very nice addition), roasted Hatch green chiles (another add-on that is a good idea if you like heat), the sour crem mixture and cheese.

This dish was very good, with the adjustments suggested by others. I did, however, not love the texture of the baked sour cream. It came out a little "curdy."

I thought this was great, but I changed a few things to make it easier (which I often do). I used up boiled chicken (I shredded it) from making chicken stock. I didn't puree the sour cream/ cilantro/ salsa mixture, I just stirred it up.  Also I just used regular salsa (medium)  and added some jalepenos and fresh tomatoes. I basically mixed cilantro, salsa, and sour cream, then mixed shredded chicken, onion, tomato, and jalepenos in a separate bowl. I bought healthier tortillas and didn't do anything to them before filling them with the chicken mixture, rolling them, placing them seam side down in a casserole dish over a little of the sour cream mixture, then topped them with the rest of the sour cream mixture and 2 % Mexican cheese mix. It came out spicy and good!  I served with Guacamole and Spicy refried beans. Yum!

I gave it a 4 since I changed a lot. Couldn't find some of the ingredients, so I used: 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chili's, half a can of additional diced green chili's, half a can of enchilada sauce, some green Ortega sauce in addition to the cilantro. I used "half" a bunch of cilantro and it was still way too overpowering for me, but my husband liked it. Boiled the chicken breasts with  onion and garlic using another reviewers suggestion, and seasoned with a little taco seasoning since I had a half packet to use.  Cheddar cheese over the top and served with sour cream.  Husband reported this was better the second day leftover in his lunch, the flavors mixed together really well overnight and he liked it even better that way.  The sour cream mixture is good on tortilla chips too :)

This easy & delish recipe has become a staple here. I make 'em at least twice a month.  Each time, I play with them - adding this, omitting that.  These are awesome - you can't screw 'em up!  Red salsa, Salsa Verde with chopped jalapeno's tossed in, Diced tomatoes, green onions, Etc.  Use and add in whatever you have on hand. Thus far, nothing has been a icky mix!!

Yum! Adding this one to the permanent recipe folder, for sure. It was excellent - the whole family enjoyed it...kiddies and all. Cheesy, creamy and flavorful. I love how soft the tortillas came out - they almost melt in your mouth. The strong presence of the cilantro really made this dish special. Thanks for sharing!

Really good.  My husband really enjoyed these.  I didn't have fresh cilantro, so I used flakes.  It probably would be awesome with fresh.

These enchiladas are sssssssssso good. They are creamy and delicious. I follow the recipe to the "T" except that in stead of just heating up the tortillas, I put them in a pan with a little vegetable oil until the edges are nice and crisp. I like the crunchy edges. Serve these enchiladas with rice and enjoy.

I thought this recipe was great.  It has a nice kick to it.  I added chiles to regular salsa and I found a jalepeno relish at the store.  I made it like a casserole by placing the tortillas on the bottom, then the chicken, a little sauce, cheese, and another layer of tortillas.  I then added more sauce to the top and I put another layer of cheese.  I used monteray jack with jalepenos.

I really loved the flavor of this recipe abd it was really easy to make but I would use corn tortillas instead of flour since they were really soggy.  Not quite like enchiladas in traditional mexican cooking.

Used whatever I had on hand such as corn tortilla, green chile enchilada (1 cup only in chicken mix), & no cilantro.  With the onions, I had sautéed until soft.  To have the most optimal flavor, my chicken was seasoned well.

I used light sour cream, 2% cheese and corn tortillas and this was WONDERFUL. I Cooked the tortillas in a nonstick pan with Pam for about a minute per side.  This keeps the tortillas for getting soggy.  I will be making this over and over

Amazing! I just did not add the jalapeno salsa because I don't like things very hot. I put in fresh mild salsa instead. I also did not use onion.  It turned out great!!!

Nice way to use chicken leftovers. I also added chipolte pepper and cumin. Next time I think I will make a cheese sauce to go over the top.

This was my first time ever making chicken enchiladas. Although they tasted great, the sauce turned green, due to the cilantro. I followed the directions, and the pics that i've viewed weren't green.

This is the best green enchiladas I have had anywhere. I mixed 1 teaspooon each of cumin, garlic, smoke chipotle pepper, salt, blackpepper. Rub on chicken thigh and pop in the oven at 350 for 2 hour then shreded it. Follow recipe and  prep it 2 hour before dinner and put in the fridge and increase time to 40 min.in the oven. No oily aftertaste. Just great

These were excellent!  I tried to follow the recipe exactly, but in Canada its a bit harder to find salsa variations that aren't standard tomato-based Old El Paso (which isn't authentic!).  Most grocery stores only carry that type of salsa and Mexican/Latin grocery stores are few and far in between.  I was able to find a grocery store that carried Herdes brand salsa.  I bought a 16 oz jar of green chili salsa, a small can of jalapenos and a small can of red salsa.  I couldn't find jalapeno salsa anywhere.  I mixed half a jar of the green salsa with the sour cream and the bunch of cilantro.  I slowly added the red salsa and jalapeno's to taste because they were a lot hotter then what I'm used to.  I have to say that sour cream mixture on its own is AMAZING!  I'm definitely going to make it again, because it's a wonderful creamy salsa that would be  great with pretty much anything, especially nachos.  The sour cream really cools down the chili.  Oh, and I tried baking my tortillas before stuffing them to prevent sogginess, but they ended up getting too hard and they were breaking.  Once I baked them they turned out great.  The only thing I would change is that for me the cheddar didn't seem to go the the sour cream sauce.  Next time I would try monterey jack or try and hunt down some queso fresco.  My boyfriend says it was one of the best dishes I've ever made and he would buy it in a restaurant!

I have made these enchiladas numerous times and always get rave reviews!  First time reviewing them, but you can't miss -- especially if you like spicy!  To save time, I sometimes use the Purdue southwestern chicken strips.

TO....DIE.....FOR !!!!!!!
I made these on Mother's Day and they were a huge success. I omitted the jalapeno salsa because we had kids coming. I used corn torts instead of flour after reading all the comments. I also fried the torts in a little oil, drained them on paper towels prior to assembling. The torts were not mushy at all. I used 2 jars of LaVictoria chili verde sauce/salsa. I also combined both shredded cheddar and shredded Mexican cheese. When I assembled the enchiladas I added a tablespoon of cheese and a tablespoon of sauce to the chicken before rolling. Everyone loved them, including the kids. Will make again and again. Thanks Brenda.

The best enchiladas I have ever eaten. They were a bit too hot and spicy for my family. I then used only 1 can of jalapeno salsa and replaced the 2nd one with medium hot red salsa. Absolutley delicious. Make sue to top with lettuce, additional sour cream,guacamole, chopped tomatoes/and or salsa.

I made these last night for my fiancé and myself... They were absolutely delicious!  I used flour tortillas but I think that I am going to try corn tortillas next time because even though I fried them before I stuffed.. They still were kinda soggy.  The sauce is so good.. I love this recipe!

These are amazingly good!  I don't have a food processor, so I just minced the cilantro and mixed it in with the sour cream and salsas.  I used a small handful of cilantro because I was worried about using the whole bunch (it seemed like it would be too much); I'm going to use some more cilantro next time.  I set the bag of fresh cilantro on the table and we just pulled pieces off to mix in with the enchiladas as we were eating...yum!  I also seasoned the shredded cooked chicken with Paula Deen's house seasoning (1 part black pepper, 1 part garlic powder, 4 parts salt), and pan-fried the it in some olive oil.

Amazing!  I used medium tomato salsa instead of jalapeno salsa, and canned chicken instead of cooking chicken breast halves.  My boyfriend was amazed I cooked something so good.  So easy and such a great flavor!

Followed recipe exactly and with great success. This dish was a major hit. The heat level was just right using Herdez green and red sauces. Thumbs up from the taste buds in this house!

Wow, I use All Recipes alot, but have never rated a recipe.  This recipe was absolutely amazing!!!  It is just like my favorite dish at a local mexican restaurant in Houston.  I think it is even better leftover!  No changes made to this at all.

Amazing!!! I did a few changes because I couldnt find some ingrediants. I used regular salsa, meduim, for the jalapeno salsa and rotel for the green chili salsa. It turned out perfect!!! I think you could use anything really along those lines and it will turn out. I used my Magic Bullet to make the sauce and smooth out the salsa prior to adding it to the chicken. I also used cheddar jack cheese..... MMMmmmmMMmMMMm I cant wait to make these again!!!

Ive done this a number of times my wife loves this. I do add a couple of extras and shortcuts. I follow the recipe to the T but i do half chicken and half roasted pork (PERNIL) I get both the rotisseirie chicken and pernil at the store saves me so much time. So good I also Add some chilly powder to the meat mixture to give it an extra smoky chilly flavor. and i top it off with chihuahua cheese or quesadilla cheese. Im making a batch as i write this review lol

I didnt have cilantro, or jalapeno salsa, or any green salsa as a matter of fact!  I used a can of diced green chilis.  I used more sour cream, and half & half, and put some canned chicken broth in too.  mixed the green chilis in, some cumin and chili powder, salt and pepper.  followed the directions with filling the pan.  used green onions instead.  filled each tortilla with the chicken/green onion mix, and filled each with some shredded cheese.  then I put shredded cheese on top as well. Oh, forgot, I had a couple tomatoes, so I diced them, put some on the bottom of pan before placing the tortillas in pan.  wow, this was good, even my picky eater liked it.  I just used what I had on hand.
ALSO***  I made this again, with different tortillas which soaked up the sauce which left them dry!  I used a less doughy flour tortilla the first time, and next time I make these I'm making more sauce!

PS - I NOW DOUBLE THE SAUCE, OTHERWISE THEY ARE TOO DRY.  and I use the less doughy tortillas because they soak up the sauce too much.  These are amazing with more sauce.  They are literally sitting in the pan with sauce up to the top of each enchilada.  when they bake some of the sauce disappears which is why doubling the sauce it great, and I never use all of the salsa, its too hot for my family

It involve a lot of prep, but as far as ingredients, this recipe could not be simpler when it comes to grocery list time. And WOW! The cilantro/sour cream combination is just perfect. Definitely feel free to experiment with various brands/types of salsa, as I feel as though they are what makes the recipe, or could potentially break it. As I've made this a few times now, experimentation may be on the horizon... **Also, boiling the chicken is probably best, as it's easiest to shred. And a well-functioning food processor is essential for the proper consistency of the sour cream sauce.

As-is, I'd say this is probably a four star recipe. With modifications, though, it's definitely five stars. First off, to make the dish more authentic, I used Chihuahua cheese instead of cheddar and corn tortillas instead of flour (tip: pan fry tortillas in a bit of oil before rolling them - it makes a big difference). Some other modifications: I bought a rotisserie chicken and shredded it (much easier!), used one jar of tomatillo salsa instead of jalapeno salsa + green chile salsa, and I added some Chihuahua cheese with the chicken mixture. With those modifications, it was perfect!

There are loaded with flavor, and the jalapeno salsa gives them a great kick. Next time I will use a smaller onion (I used a medium-sized one) and will briefly saute it to take out some of the crunch. I was short on time so we just ate these as is, but next time I'll add a side of refried beans and spanish rice, as well as some sliced avocado.

Eh, this wasn't that great. I don't know where people are finding the types of salsa described in the recipe, I could only find Green Enchilada SAUCE (not salsa) so I used that. I felt the onions were weird (and too chunky- even though I sauteed prior to using) and the sauce wasn't that great either. And they were soggy to boot. I'll check around to see if I can find another recipe from this site.

Loved this recipe !   A little too hot for us but GOOD none the less.  I loaded up my tortillas - so I needed MORE sour cream mixture. I have found various ways to change up this recipe to our family's likings.

These are truly divine!  I would give them more stars if I could.  They are spicy, creamy and easy to make.  They have HUGE cilantro flavor, which we love.  I made the recipe as written but I did add Mexican Chihuahua Cheese to the filling and then used a mix of cheddar and Chihuahua cheese on the top.  Hubby said these are THE best chicken enchiladas he has ever eaten.  My eight year old loved them and even though they were spicy, my four year old and 2 year old ate some.  We will definitely be making these again.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

These enchiladas are phenominal! I bought 2 7oz cans of El Pato jalapeno salsa and 2 10oz cans of LaVictoria green chile enchilada sauce. I used one whole can of the LaVictoria in with the chicken mixture, along with a little handful of cheese.  I used about 1/2 of the remaining can of LaVictoria in the sour cream  mixture. The remaining 1/2 of the can we used as extra sauce for our dinner and mexican rice. I baked them uncovered because that is the way I have always baked enchiladas. They could have been a little saucier, so next time I think I will cover it for only 10 minutes and then remove the foil.  If yours came out soupy, it is because it was covered the whole time. Anyway, when I took leftovers to work the next day, I was the envy of the lunchroom!

These are simply fantastic! Very easy to prepare - I used shredded cooked chicken I had leftover. I couldn't find jalapeno salsa, so I used green chile enchilada sauce (Carlita's) and the green chile salsa (Ortega). They looked great on the plate (like restaurant food) and tasted fabulous! We both ate way too much! Thanks for a great have-again.

This is a great recipe to work with,  but I did leave out the fresh cilantro and the onion.  I also didn't add sour cream to the mixture because I wanted to freeze half for future enchiladas. I  added a can of diced tomatos with cilantro and lime.  I used chicken tenderloins, probably a good 25% more than the recipe calls for (I wanted to have extra for another meal) I coated the bottom of my dish with enchilada sauce, added the cheddar cheese to the mixture, topped with a little more enchilada sauce and a heavy layer of shredded pepper jack cheese.  My husband and I ate so much we couldn't hold up to our usual evening of live music...I had to drive, he was so sleepy, ha!

A very time consuming recipe to make, but well worth the flavor.  I couldn't bring myself to use flour tortillas, so I fried some corn tortillas in hot vegetable oil, as I do for my cheese enchiladas.  Sour cream sauce does solidify quite a bit during the baking process, and does not do good for left overs.  Will keep tweaking until I figure out a better way to make the sauce.

Pretty tasty. I used much less cilantro, added black beans, and used salsa verde instead of jalapeno salsa. Pretty spicy for younger kids. I also put some cheese on the inside and sauteed the onions first. Will make again.

My family loved this recipe.  I have never heard them say that they wanted to lick their plates but they did when I made this.  It is very delicious and will be something that I will make very often.  I had enough stuffing mixture to make four additional enchiladas.  I took some for lunch the next day.  I served it with wholegrain brown rice.  Yummy!

I was worried about making something from online, however these were easy and very good. My family raved about them for days. Only problem that I had was the left overs the next day were soggy soggy. I fried the tortillas like suggested and that helped but letting them sit over night...no so much. LOL! I will be working on this to see and if I find something helpful, I will re-post.

One of my New Years resolutions is to try a new recipe each week. This was my recipe for week #1 and it was amazing! I was a little worried about all the cilantro, but it turned out great. My changes: I made, but didnt end up using all the sauce the recipe called for; I also used only Trader Joe's Chile Verde Salsa instead of the other sauces suggested. Our guests thoroughly enjoyed this dish.

Really good! I only used 10 cilantro stems and added chunky salsa instead of jalapeno, I added shredded cheese, sazon and a half cup light sour cream to the chicken.

I needed to use up some sour cream & luckily I also had some left-over rotisserie chicken, so I decided to make this- I had a 7 oz. can of green chilies & tequila Lime Salsa,so that's what I added-I used a 4 cheese Mexican shred, but could only fit 8 flour tortillas in my pan (9x13) they were 8" tortillas.  My husband absolutely loved this & I would have loved to have "seconds", but that will be tomorrow. It was well worth the effort to prepare & I'm sure I'll be making it again. I think a sprinkle of olives would be tasty & pretty too.

This is a delicious recipe.  It's become one of my favorites.  I've been making it in two 8-inch square pans and freezing one (since I only cook for two).

What a great tasting and easy making recipe! I did read other reviews and I sauteed the onions first. My husband came home and said it smelled like our favorite Mexican restaurant and after eating, it tasted better too!

these are great. I took aother reviewer's advice and added only 10 or so sprigs of cilantro. the sour cream sauce was fantastic- you can adjust the heat buy using less jalapeno salsa, and more mild chile salsa. I didnt even mess with the onion and stuff, I just poured a can of mild enchilada sauce on the shredded chicken and filled the tortillas. excellent!!

Wow, fabulous!  These were so good!  I used green onion instead of regular.  I would try frying the tortillas in oil for a minute as another reviewer suggested, because my DH doesn't care for the mushy tortilla factor.  Doesn't bother me at all though!  Yum!

Pretty darn good, except you won't like these if you don't like cilantro. I always make this half and half (with and without the cilantro.) On my half with cilantro, I also use low fat sour cream and cheese, and they turn out delicious. I've made this with both flour tortillas, and corn tortillas, and surprisingly enough I prefer the flour. I like how they turn out chewy, the corn tortillas just fell apart. Make as directed or omit the cilantro!

Often when I'm reading reviews for a recipe that's highly rated and I come across someone who gives it a low rating, I think to myself, "That person must've done something wrong.  How can everyone else love it & just this ONE person not?"  Well, now I see how.  I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be way too rich.  Too many strong flavors trying to compete.  I wasn't going to let on because there were A LOT of left overs & I wanted them eaten but the next day my family refused to 'pretend' twice!  Sorry.  Not for us.

We substituted black beans for the chicken. I used about 1.5 cups dry and had about a half a cup left over after I used them in the recipe. My boyfriend and I really liked it. Also, we used soy cheese and had to cook it about 15 minutes longer to ensure that the cheese melted, and it still came out just fine. I was planning on giving it four stars rather than five because the sauce is really unappetizing to look at... pink with green specks of cilantro. But... We reheated some of the leftovers in the morning and added some scrambled eggs on top and it was an awesome breakfast too! So I gave it 5 stars.

My family and I, who are all Texans, were not crazy about this recipe. The color of the sour cream sauce was unappetizing and the flavor just didn't do it for us.  I made no changes to the recipe and will continue to look for a good enchilada recipe.

I prepared this recipe exactly as it read. I found it to be too hot with jalapeno for my taste. My husband liked it. I prepared the sauce and chicken mixture the day before then assembled when I got home from work, baked and had yellow rice with it. If you like spicy hot food you will like this..large servings.

We made these enchiladas on Saturday night and finished them off watching the Oscars.  They are the best, the flavour is wonderful. They were just as good the second day too.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. It tasted authentically mexican.

I altered the recipe just a bit: I used closer to 12 oz. sour cream, or 1.5 cups, and used 1 large can (17 oz)mild green enchilada sauce in lieu of the 2 cans of green chile salsa. Also, one onion is too much; I'd say one half of an onion would suffice.

One of my sons loved it so much that he requested it for his birthday dinner (it's in November!). All of the leftovers were eaten. Not one burrito remained in the fridge past two days.

We really liked this recipe! I made a few modifications thought. I boiled my chicken breast with an onion and garlic clove, as suggested by another cook. I also sauted my onions before adding them to the chicken. Then I used what I had on hand for salsa which was Herdez green salsa verde and Herdez red salsa. I didn't have fresh cilantro and didn't go to store to get it b/c of snow so used dry instead. I also followed another cook's suggestion and fried my corn tortilla in oil for a minute to crisp them up. My husband and I loved it. Ours wasn't super spicy (which neither one likes hot hot things) nor was it overly cilantro (due to the dry?) Anyway, I'll definitely make this again and perhaps add sauted green peppers and black beans to the enchiladas.

Very Easy to make and delicious.   They were a little too spicy for our taste but we will probably just reduce the jalapeno salsa and add more verde sauce the next time.   Adding it to our favorites!

I love cilantro. I used some from my garden and used less than what a typical store "bunch" would be. The cilantro flavor was so strong, you almost couldn't taste anything else. I didn't have an green salsa on hand so I added some fresh jalapenos from my garden and used all red salsa. I think next time I'll try using half the amount of cilantro.

Heavenly! My husband wolfed this down. Blending the salsa, cilantro and sour cream together was a unique and delicious idea. I used red salsa instead of green. The amount of spice was just right. Will definitely put this on my rotation of recipes!

I have made this five times now very easy and I get compliments and requests to make it every time. I tried make it with corn tortillas but really do prefer the flour which was not what I expected. Highly recommended!~

Excellent, though I agree that it was a tad too cilantro-y.  Easy and healthy if you substitute low-fat cheese and sour cream. Note: though I felt stupid when it turned out terrible, I froze these and cooked them at a later date the 2nd time I had them.  NOT a good idea- they were a soggy mess.  D'oh...

I give this recipe 5/5 stars because the enchiladas were fabulous.  I used the advice of one of the other ratings and used corn tortillias.  My only only other suggestion would be to specify the type of cheese (mozzarrella is your best bet).

My husband grimaces at the mention of Tex-Mex and is not a fan of Mexican cuisine--go figure! He's still raving about how good these were, just about turned his life around!  I couldn't find green chile salsa so just added chopped green chiles to some regular.  Also used Monterey Jack/cheddar on top.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and this will be a regular in our house.

This dish was wonderful! Although I used a bit less cilantro (as so not to overpower the sauce) and also used corn tortillas, I withheld from altering anything else in the recipe. My husband, although a little spicy for his taste, loved it, and is actually eating left-overs now for a late-night snack!

This recipe has potential.  I really like cilantro, and I only used half a bunch, but it was still too much.  Maybe a quarter of a bunch would be okay.  It would even be fine without it.  The sour cream mixture is too much for the recipe.  It could be cut in half and save some money without hurting the taste.  Also, I don't recommend using flour tortillas, as they became very doughy in all that sauce.  But on the bright side, the heat from the salsas was perfect, and the flavor could be great with the cilantro changes.  You can leave off the cheese and save some calories and fat too.

Very easy, but way too spicy. I think with a little modification (maybe just using green enchilada sauce) this could be very good.

Not spicy enough. And I was dissapointed that the sour cream is just put on top. I was hoping for a sour cream sauce. Overall the taste was ok, I'm still searching for a sauce, maybe I'll just experiment myself.

This is a great recipe, my husband said it was the best recipe I have found yet.  I substituted Schwan's fajita chicken and used half the amount of onions, cooking them with garlic powder before adding to the meat mixture.  Thanks! I will make them again!

After reading other reviews, decided to use many suggestions - cut down on the cilantro, used one can of chili salsa, one can of jalepeno salsa, and one jar of Pace thick salsa (mild) so my nose wouldn't run.  Also used corn tortillas.  Recipe was a big hit!  Would definately make again.

wow, that is a LOT of cilantro in one dish!  I have made this a couple of times and each time I cut the cilantro down by 50%!  I probably only use half of one bunch now.  We could barely eat it with all the cilantro that the recipe calls for!

Outstanding! However, I did substitute Chi Chi's medium salsa for the jalapeno salsa and the green chili salsa (I couldn't find those exact ingredients at my grocery store). And I put in a dash of green hot sauce. I served this to company, and they raved about it. The sauce is unbelievable--we never had anything this delicious at a Mexican restaurant.

Very Tasty!
The sauce is easy to make with tomatillo cooking sauce and enchilada sauce, etc. to fill the 28 ounces.  Very creamy.  But I feel that the recipe needs more chicken filling.  The enchiladas are slender. Next time I'll increase the filling ingredients by half (3 chicken half breasts and more onion). I used scallions for the onions - worked well with the sour cream sauce.

Delicious!  Not a bite left over at this family dinner.  I do not eat jalapeños so used green chili's instead.  worked fine for us.  Loved the cilantro/Sr cream sauce (I even used it as dressing on my salad).

I've made this recipe twice, the first time was for a church function and the second time for my family.  The flavor is great, will work for all levels of heat, easy to alternate the recipes from mild to HOT.  I do find the chicken cheese enchilada are soggy, need to use less sauce so tortilla are crunchy and not a soft casserole.  Recommend 1/2 the sauce, fill as directed by 1/2 of the sauce on top with the cheese.

I made this dish last night with a few minor tweaks and it came out great!
First of all imo a flour tortilla is for tacos/burritos NOT enchiladas so I used 12 corn tortillas instead. I very lightly fried these in canola oil on both sides and then set aside so they could cool while I worked on the sauce and chicken. For the sauce I used light sour cream, a 16 oz bottle of green salsa (with tomatillos and jalapenos), 1/2 of an onion, and since I couldn't find green chile salsa I picked up a can of diced green chiles and put 2 tsp in the blender. I also don't use cilantro regularly enough to get fresh cilantro so I subbed in 1/2 tsp dried cilantro.  
After blending the sauce I tasted the mixture and it had a nice kick. I'd add the green chiles to taste, if I had added anymore I would have had to mellow it out.
The chicken I seasoned simply with cumino, garlic powder and salt and pepper. I sauted the breasts and shredded them afterwards. I'm not a fan of onions and I felt the sauce had enough of a kick on its own so I didn't add either to the chicken. I did add a bit of cheese as I rolled them up. 
The rest I followed as written. I will make these again!

We don't keep the spicy stuff around, so just used medium Pace salsa.  Had extra sour cream and cilantro from a different recipe that had to be used up. So I found this.  Used up what I had left of an onion.  Only had Costco Panco chicken breasts.  So I had to make lots of substitutions.  But they turned out great!  He loved them!! :))  Just goes to show a recipe like this can be used in a variety of ways.  I was grateful for it.

This was amazing!  I had to use green enchilada sauce instead of the salsas because that's what I had on hand.   I mixed a bit of taco seasoning in with the chicken.  I think this recipe is very forgiving for such adjustments.  It was so good, I was disappointed when I got full!  The cilantro and sour cream in the sauce make it special.

This is a winner!I used chicken thighs, instead of breasts, as I think thighs are moister(that fat content) and don't dry out when baking. I fried the thighs in olive oil with cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper and set to cool before shredding. (I used the pan drippings to fry the rice for my Mexican Rice.) The jalapeno salsa I got turned out to be a red sauce, so think I will make my own next time. It is a bit on the spicy side, but nobody felt it was too spicy - might be for kids, though. The flour tortillas were kind of glue-like, but everyone thought it was OK. I think maybe heating the pan and bottom liquid in the dish before placing the enchiladas might mitigate that, though. Will try next time. This was a huge hit with my dinner guests and one I will use again and again.

the flavor is too tangy (tastes like a mixture of sour cream, green salsa, and cilantro, baked), the flavor lacks any complexity; the texture is gooey - the tortillas come out mushy; and my tortillas stuck to the glass baking dish so when I tried to get one out, it was just a soupy mess on my plate.

I haven't tried these yet but they are on my list to make this week. I just wanted to let some who have rated this and said they couldn't find jalapeno salsa. Taco Bell is now selling there verde salsa in a big jar. it has jalapenos and green chili in it so you can kill 2 birds with one stone:)

I've made this twice now, very good!  Instead of Cheddar, I use Jalapeno Monterey Jack and add half of it to the chicken mixture then sprinkle the remaining half on top.  My husbands loves this meal!

Family enjoyed this enchilada meal.  I used 1 can of jalapeno salsa and 7 oz. of homemade traditional red salsa.  Make sure you enjoy the taste of cilantro, as there is a bunch in this recipe.  I served this with 'Black Beans, Corn & Yellow Rice' from this site.  This will be a repeat meal in our house.

Loved the flavors of this.  I added a can of drained black beans to the chicken.  I used corn tortillas and unfortunately, they were absolute mush.  I will definitely try this again with flour tortillas or will try frying them like others have suggested.

These enchiladas are one of the best things I have made!  Loved them and will be making them again often.  The sauce is delicious and makes this dish.  I accidentally bought a green chili salsa that was hot and it really spiced up the dish.  Definitely a winner!

This dish was filled with flavor. I did not use any jalapeno peppers. The only downfall was that the green salsa was a little bit too hot. SO next time I will try to find a salsa that is on the mild side. The flour was deep fried in oil in order to help prevent mushiness, which it did. I also served this with a side of, "Mexican Rice II," also from this website. ONOlicious!

Made these tonight for the first time and they were AWESOME!  Used Salsa Verde (medium heat) and some green taco sauce (mild) and it was perfect.  Added some shredded Monterey Jack to the filling.  DELICIOUS!

These enchiladas were great!  I lightly fried the corn tortillas for a few seconds on each side.  A trick I have always used to keep them from getting mushy.  I also used canned Green enchilada sauce and added green chilis to the mix.  One other ingredient that I added to the chicken mixture was some cream cheese!

Easy to make and tasted great! I had a hard time finding the write salas but end up with good stuff.  Didn't change the recipe at all.  
It was my first time making enchiladas and first time for my husband to try them. We both loved it!

So yummy and easy.   I didn't use any jalapeno or green chile salsa, though - just took one large anaheim chile, grilled it for a couple of minutes, and then added half to the chicken mixture (diced) and half to the pureed mixture.

Excellent recipe except what is up with flour tortillas in enchiladas?  Corn is the authentic way to go and better for you.  Substituting crema mexicana for the sour cream is a nice touch.

This was quite good.  I used corn instead of flour tortillas and leftover grilled boneless chicken breast because thats what I had.  I also used low fat sour cream.  I think I will cut back on the jalapeno salsa next time, as it was a bit too spicy for my taste.

This was really good. I used a good quality salsa verde and red salsa. (forgive me if I'm wrong but isn't normal salsa jalapeno salsa since jalapenos are in it?) Anyways, I eyeballed the cilantro, and salsas, and tasted while blending. I didn't use a whole bunch, but about half was good. I also used Light sour cream, and to give the chicken more flavor I used taco seasoning on it. I poured the sour cream mixture, and even more salsa verde and red salsa over top along with the cheese. I didn't want it to look too pale. I'll definitely make this again!! It was good.

I just found I am wheat-intolerant and have found little comfort in withdrawing from my favorite foods (think no pasta, french toast, gravy.... etc etc unless using substitutes - yick!) I have been eating this recipe at a local restaurant non-stop bc they use corn tortillas and I've been exhausted (allergic to Soy possibly too) what with the drastic diet change - I was previous a non-meat eater...not a veggie or a vegan but it's been hard. I'm excited to find a recipe that is so quick and easy.... I will use a Mexican white cheese just a few sprinkles on top at the end, post-bake due to the sour cream sauce. I love cilantro and salsa so I'm excited to make my own version of this. Gluten-free of course. (FML)

Very tasty! Suggestion: Double the chicken and tortillas.  Plenty of sauce left over, you can make two 9x13 dishes by just doubling the chicken and tortillas. Use Herdez green salsa for the "prepared green chile salsa"

So good!  I love the spicy cilantro flavor of this dish.  I'm not sure if I got the correct sauces, I got green enchilada sauce and green salsa and it worked out great!  My husband said he LOVED it (which he usually doesn't like Mexican food), he couldn't stop eating it!  Very good.

Oh so wonderful!  Exactly like my favorite restaurant makes.  I live in Texas so I have tasted a lot of sour cream chicken enchiladas, and these are superb.  Most sour cream enchiladas have a very heavy creamy sauce. I love this recipe because the sour cream is not overwhelming (although you could easily adjust that to your taste).  The green salsa adds a great tang.  I used the Salsa de Tomatillo recipe on this site instead of jarred green chile salsa--and I highly recommend it (it's so easy).   I also used corn tortillas because I prefer them.  Otherwise I followed this recipe to a tee and they were great.

I have tried this recipe once.  The sauce was ok, but it is more like a coating than a sauce.  Be careful with the amount of jalapenos you add.  I loved one of the other reviewers suggestions for how to cook the chicken.  The chicken was moist per her recipe.  I additionally sauteed the onions with the green chiles to cook the onions so they were not raw.  It was very tasty but dry.

Loved the sauce. It was something new to me with all of the cilantro. But we liked it so must the extra sauce we used for a dip

This was so delicious!!  The jalapeno salsa added to much heat for my husband, his dad and myself (we were all sweating!) so I'd cut back on that but otherwise... Mmmm!

Had high hopes for this recipe but ended up disappointed.  My DH was looking for a chicken enchilada recipe that used a green sauce and this one sounded perfect.  Loved all the ingredients and followed the recipe with only a few minor changes.  But the sauce was clotted coming out of the oven and the taste was just not very good.  No one complained but no one finished their serving either. Will try to find another recipe.

The jalepeno Salsa just made it way to hot. If I would make this again I would omit this sauce so it won't burn my daughters mouth!

This recipe is wonderful. I sauteed my onions beforehand so they would be soft. I also slow-cooked my chicken for 7 hrs in a cup of chicken broth with a bit of seasonings. My husband liked this recipe better than Chicken Enchiladas II on this site, which is also very good.  This recipe is definitely closer to authentic Mexican cuisine. It has a good, rich cilantro flavor. If you don't like cilantro, you might not like this one. Thanks for a great recipe!

YUM! made this with a few alterations to fit my familys taste. Sauteed onions and garlic,then added to shredded chicken. Added 3/4can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles and 4oz can of diced green chilies to chicken and added the green chile salsa(with serrano peppers instead of jalepeno peppers) and green chili enchilda sauce and mixed. Put into fridge to let flavors meld. I did slightly fry the tortillas to crisp them up. Followed the rest of the directions cooked for 1 hour at 350 covered. LOVED this recipe. This would be good as a green chili stew that would be spooned into warm tortillas, too. My husband misses authentic Mexican dishes since moving from Az to MN but this was a winner in his book!  A bit spicy with the cilantro (only used 3/4 of the bunch) but excellent flavor.  This is a terrific recipe and will be made again and again in my kitchen. Thanks Brenda for the recipe.

The Sour Cream Mixture is the best part! We were dipping tortilla chips in it. Will make again and again! I filled them with chopped grilled chicken breasts and onions with green/red peppers. To serve I put 2 on a plate top with the sour cream sauce, then top with a bunch of shredded lettuce and fresh pico de gallo.

I used my own home-made salsa for this recipe.  This is the best tasting enchilada that I have ever had.  My 6 year old who doesn't like vegies even ate 2!!  She thought they were delicious.

Very good!!!  I couldn't find the green chile salsa so I used green chile enchilada sauce instead.  It came out great.  I also added a little more cheese inside the enchiladas since we  are cheese lovers!!  My BF isn't a big fan of green sauce but he enjoyed eating this. Thank you!

I used a "bunch" of cilantro, and it just OVERWELMED the dish!!  Way too much!  Otherwise it would have been an excellent dish!  Next time I'll skip the cilantro and the sauce has enough flavor to stand on it's own!!  Excellent except for the cilantro!

Fab! Very spicy though, so next time I might use just half the amount of salsa and more cream cheese.

I really like hot and spicy food, but this was just too much for me.  It seems like it would've tasted really good if we didn't have to chug half a glass of milk after every bite.  If I made this again I wouldn't use the onion at all- it was way too much!  I'd also downgrade to milder salsas, but that's just my taste.

To ensure that my kids would eat these, I used one large jar of canned green enchilada (28 oz) sauce in place of the salsas for a milder taste.  I was skeptical about sticking a bunch of cilantro in the blender, but it worked like a charm.  The dish was delicious and very little work.

LOVE this recipe! I throw a whole bunch of cilantro (most stems removed) a tub of sour cream, a jar of green chiles and a jar of salsa verde in the blender and you can even pick up a cooked chicken from the market on your way home to use in lieu of taking the time to cook it yourself. Fast, flavourful and satisfying. A staple for rushed nights.

I wish I could give these more stars. They were amazing! I did make some changes to them based on personal preference and I am only noting them here so that I can refer to them later. I'm sure the original recipe is just as good. The only things I did differently was used corn tortillas and instead of the salsas, I used Hatch green enchilada sauce because I couldn't find jalapeno salsa. Turned out delicious. My husband raved about them all evening and said that they were restaurant quality!

I made these tonight. Wow, outstanding taste.  The only thing I would change about it, next time is to saute the onions before adding to chicken, cause they were kind of crunchy. Thank you for the recipe.

We liked it.  Halved the recipe which made it seem like too much of the sour cream sauce.  Also, I erred on the side of too much cilantro (because I love it), but my exaggeration made the meal a little too cliantro-y.  All in all, it was okay.

This was just ok.  Not bad, just not the best I've had.  I added sliced olives and a can of Cream of Chicken Soup because it didn't seem moist enough.  And it still could have had more, so next time, I will add a large can of Green Enchilada Sauce.  The Cilantro was a good addition.

The sauce is amazing! The spiciness and the cilantro mixed with sour cream is interesting and delicious. I think the recipe calls for too much onion though and I was not happy at all with the slimy mushy consistency of the tortillas after being baked in all of that sauce. It's a shame because I LOVE enchiladas. Not the best recipe on here. Try the Authentic Enchiladas Verdes. Much better in every way.

I didn't have any green salsa on hand so I used red instead and I did season my chicken with white and black pepper and some garlic just to add some extra flavor. This recipe is fantastic can't wait to try it with green salsa!  I did find my tortillas got a little too soggy for my liking so I will ease up on the amount of sour cream sauce I pour on top in the future.  But thank you so much for this recipe, I'm African but now my boyfriend swears I must be have beem Mexican in a past life!!!  Thank you!!!

Super delicious!!!  I used corn tortillas instead, and even though they were a bit mushy, they were still fabulous! For the sour cream sause I used my own home grown jalapenos, a can of green chile enchilada sauce (old el paso brand), a can of green salsa which included tomatillos and jalapenos, and of course the sour cream and cilantro.  It was great!  

I made some cheese filled enchiladas and some with chicken that I boiled and shredded.  I served it to my husband with sliced avocados and a dollop of sour cream on top.  He loved it and we ate it again the next day!

This is an excellent recipe.  I only gave it 4 stars because it had way too much cilantro for my taste.  Next time I'll only use a couple tablespoons of cilantro.  I also wish that I would have read more reviews before I made this dish.  I should have tasted the sour cream sauce as I was adding the jalapeno salsa because it was a little too hot for my son.  That's okay...lesson learned.  Lastly, I used a rotisserie chicken for added convenience.  Over all, I'll probably be making this dish for years to come.

This recipe was sooooo good.  I made beef enchiladas and these chicken.  The beef were good, but the chicken were gone.  I don't really like spicy food, so I didn't add any cilantro. It was seasoned well with the other sauces. Thanks for the great recipe I am fixing these again for dinner tonight.

VERY GOOD! MY GROCERY DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF SALSA SO I USED VERDE SAUCE THAT THEY DID HAVE.  I ALSO ADDED SOUR CREAM TO THE FILLING AND MY HUSBAND LOVE IT.

Excellent!  My husband asked how I learned to make such authentic Mexican food.  I will be making these a few times each month.  The recipe was perfect as is, I didn't chnage a thing.  Thank you.

I loved these! My husband is not a fan of sour cream by any means and he loved them too.  I made them as directed and they came out perfectly. Actually I modified one thing, I had really fresh tortillas so I crispied them up on the stove over an open flame. If you dont crisp them up you may end up with soggy enchiladas :0(

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.  This was sooooooo good!  I even took some to work for some friends, and a co-worker who is hispanic told me that it was very authentic and I couldn't believe it (especially since I am of Irish/German descent). The request has been made to make it again.  Anyway, thank you for sharing this, it is fabulous and I will continue making it!

I used regular red Mexican style salsa and I added crumbled queso fresco to the chicken.  Also I layered corn tortillas with the filling instead of making individual enchiladas.  I wanted to speed up getting dinner on the table.  It's just faster that way and all the flavors are the same.

Of course I couldn't find green chile salsa or jalepeno salsa in the store!  So, I used regular salsa and added a can of green chiles.  I also used reduced fat cheese, fat free sour cream, and wheat tortillas.  It came out really good and if I didn't tell you, you wouldn't know I used reduced fat ingredients!  I will definatly make this again!

This recipe was not that great. When I went to the store we couldn't find "jalapeno salsa." We had to improvise with regular salsa & jalapenos and it wasn't that great.

I'm very new to cooking and this was an easy recipe to follow.  I could not find the salsa as well and used green enchilda sauce.  Also, I used half the cilantro.  I do not have a food processor so I just chopped the cilantro.  Next time I will cook the onions a little bit to soften them up.  Loved it!  Made half with corn tortillas and the other half flour.

Here are the changes I made since I couldn't find the salsas called for.  I pureed one 16 oz. jar of Ortega Salsa Verde, half a bunch of cilantro and the sour cream.  I mixed one small can of chopped green chiles in with the shredded chicken and omitted the onion.  It had a zing to it, but not too spicy.  It would be perfect for St. Patrick's Day because of it's green-like color.  It is definitely something I'd make again.

This is a very nice dish.  I made a few changes as I did not have all the ingredients. I put 1 cup no fat sour cream, 1/4 cup cilantro, 1/2 cup chopped chilies and 1 cup salsa verde in the processor. I shredded the chicken mixed in chopped onion and 1 cup salsa verde and chopped pickled jalapeno rings. I divided chicken mix into 6 and topped with jalapenos.  Roll up placed in dish topped with cheddar cheese and NO tin foil.  When it was finished cooking it was broiled for 5 minutes to golden brown.. This recipe was awesome and not soggy at all. We will definately enjoy this again and again.

Wow! These should have been called jalapeno cilantro enchiladas NOT sour cream enchiladas!
Too spicy for us even after reducing the amount of Jalapeno salsa BUT I woudl definitely try again with modifications because the cilantro is a great idea.

The sauce made the flour tortillas sort of slimy, soggy.  I may try frying the tortillas first if I make this recipe again. I cut the cilantro in half and wouldn't recommend using any more than that.

Yum! I used corn tortillas (lightly fried), but otherwise followed the rest of the recipe. Just the right amount of spicy & lots of cilantro flavor - just as the intro states...if you don't like cilantro or spicy, adjust to your taste!

Good. But I think I like cream cheese enchiladas better myself. This has a creamy texture and good flavor. It's not your typical enchilada so it's nice for a change. Lots of cilantro, so you better like that. Everyone I made it for liked it and I did too.

Excellent.  A little too spicy for me so I cut the amount of both salsas down.  I also left out the onion and added more chicken.

I used onion powder instead of onion and corn tortillas instead of flour.  My husband loved this recipe and said that it was definetly a keeper. Personally, I need more heat so next time I make it I will have to add something to it to give it a little more bite.  Would not serve to guests however because it didn't look very appetizing (this might be because I used the corn instead of the flour tortillas).  I plan to make this again, thank you.

5 stars when corn tortillas are used instead of flour.  Like other reviewers have said, flour tortillas come out gummy.

These were pretty good! I used jack cheese instead of cheddar. Wanted to take the advice of other reviewers and use corn tortillas, but couldn't find any at my store today. The flour tortillas got a little soggy. Hubby thought this was too spicy, will try again with milder salsa. All in all a good recipe!!! Thanks!

These were great. I used shrimp the second time I made the recipe and they turned out great. The pressure was on too since I made them for my Mexican pals who thought they were awesome!

This recipe was excellent!!!  So authentic with a delicious blend of flavors - and very easy to make as well!!!  I made it the day before and it seemed to really let the flavors blend...I can't say enough how happy I am to have found this recipe and will definitely make again!!!!  Also, I made it exactly as listed...

This was very good! I used boneless chicken thighs (I like dark meat) and shredded with two forks. My guests loved it.

I absolutely love cilantro, jalapenos, sour cream and cheddar.  However, this recipe just didn't do it for me.  I didn't have any salsa in the jar, so I actually went to the extent of making my own pico de gallo for this.  You would think that having fresh ingredients would improve the recipe, but I was still a little disappointed.  The sour cream mixture took on a funny texture (almost curdled) after baking in the oven....maybe the substitutions were the problem.

I used many of the same ingredients, but put it all together differenly.  Mix the sour cream, onions, cilantro, cheese, a little salsa, and chicken all together.  Pour a thin layer of salsa on the bottom of the pan. Dip the tortillas in salsa to wet them, and fill them with the sour cream mix.  Cover with more salsa and bake.  They are sooo yummy!

Fantastic! The only thing I'll change next time is mix some of the sauce in with the chicken; the chicken in the tortilla alone was too dry. 

Other reviewers who rated this lower because they don't like cilantro...well, they should've figured not to use cilantro.

This was great. Thanks a lot!

I really loved this recipe.  I used 1 14 oz. jar of mild taco sauce and 2 cans of salsa verde.  I also used the roasted chicken from the store which some have suggested. This is a great, quick dinner recipe.  My only hesitation in recommending this recipe is the strong flavor of cilantro.  I love cilantro so it was great for me but people who don't care for it would be very overpowered.  I might even call these Cilantro Lovers Enchiladas!

These rock!  I did everything low fat that I possibly could and they still were great!  Use the amount cilantro  to your taste.  I used about half a bunch.

This is it! I have wanted to find an enchilada recipe that is similar to restaurants and this is it. This will stay in my rotation of menus. I did make a few changes. The green chili salsa is impossible to find in this small midwestern town so I substituted my own fresh salsa and it worked great. That way I control the level of heat. I used a little less sour cream for my family's taste. Other than that I made it just as it says. It is wonderful. I did not find it spicy at all and all of my kids ate it. I think it is possible that the green chile salsa may have added the spicyness. Try this one, you won't be disappointed if you like the restaurant version.

Really great taste, and it's at hot as the salsa you use - hot for me.  I hate cilantro, so I left it out entirely.  I forgot the onions (sauteed them, but I used them all in the beef enchiladas) but it was okay.   Served them last night at a dinner party and got rave reviews.

Yummy!  I modified the recipe by using corn tortillas, using green enchilada sauce and green chile salsa (had young children to serve).  I would definitely use this recipe again - never had used corn tortillas for enchiladas before - delicious!  I am not a big fan of cilantro but I used the full amount recommended and I did not think it over powered the dish at all.

I highly recommend this easy and tasty recipe.  For a flavorful and easy prep twist, use a roasted chicken which adds a great smokey flavor to the dish.  One change I've made was to use corn tortillas instead of flour to eliminate a somewhat unpleasant soggy texture from cooking the flour tortillas in a sauce.

This is great--like others, we're adding it to our "Must have once a month" list. The sauce would be excellent as a dip or as a sauce over burritos, on tacos, etc.--it was the best part of the dish!

It may just be my oven, but they needed to cook a lot longer than the recipe specified - when I took them out the onions inside were still almost raw. Next time I think I will sautee the onions first. Very tasty though.

I modified this recipie quite a bit and it still turned out great!  I used a medium salsa along with the green chile salsa and put it in a oblong glass dish.  I layered the enchiladas and poured the sauch over the top.  Still had quite a kick and was very good.

My husband loves these enchiladas! He asked me to make them once a month. Some other reviewers found the sauce to be too thin; I found it to be a bit too thick after cooking... I think it just depends on how much water is in your salsas. I used pepper jack cheese and white corn tortillas. The best!

EXCELLENT!! Both my husband and his friend raved about how good it was at least 3 times during dinner.  My husband told me "keep that recipe in a safe spot!"  I did add garlic to the chicken mixture since we are garlic fiends.  The tortillas did become soggy but bearable.  Would love to find 12" corn tortillas and give that a try.

This was awsome.  I substituted Pace picante sauce (medium) and a can of green chilies for the salsas in the recipe.  This turned out really nice for the kids (not too spicy). I also used corn tortillas-good choice.  I might try this with pepper jack cheese next time.

I thought this was wonderful...We love spicy foods and cilantro is one of our favorites.  We will definately be making this again!

I didn't have the salsas specifyed but used regular salsa and added a few jalapano slices and part of a green chile. Worked great!

We loved these enchiladas!  Very easy to make, especially when I subsituted a can of shredded chicken.  Very spicy, and even better the next day.

This is an awesome recipe. Instead of flour tortillas i use white corn tortillas. This keeps the tortillas from absorbing all the sour cream sauce. I also double the sour cream sauce to pour extra sauce on enchiladas at serving.

This was an easy and tasty recipe.  I used tomatillo salsa since I didn't have Jalapeno salsa on hand and added a can of diced green chilies to give it some spice.  My husband loved the recipe.

Very tasty yummy.  Recipe simply written but totally confusing.  Cilantro?  How much?  Do you drain the salsas?  How many cups of chicken?  How big of an onion?  I do so much better with exacts.  But it came out well despite the fact that I had to make my own jalepeno salsa.  No such thing in my Walmart.  So used a recipe that was online. In spite of all my complaining it was very good!  My tribe loved it!  Thank you.  PS. All I was looking for a way to use up excess sour cream but I love the freshness and no goopy soups..

The chicken filling was delicious.  I would try again in a different type of casserole.  The tortillas didn't cook well.

Easy to put together w/rotisserie ck. I could not find jalapeno  salsa therefore I felt that the recipe was missing a little something, next time I'll add a jalapeno.

My husband LOVED this recipe. I have been a wife for a little over a month now, and it has been AWESOME to find gems like these as I explore the NEW realm of cooking.  This recipe will be a bi-weekly one for sure. It is also just SO easy. 

I made a few alterations to the recipe, and it turned out LOVELY!

-Instead of boiling the chicken breasts I grilled them on a skillet on the stove and shredded them after. 
-I grilled the onions in the same skillet at the same time as I cooked the chicken. 
-I used 1/2 a bunch of cilantro because I realized that 1 bunch was a bit much, and I also am not a huge fan of cilantro. This was before I read the reviews. I am glad I only used 1/2 the amount because many of the other reviews said that the cilantro was overpowering. 
-I did not have jalapeno salsa, so I chopped up fresh jalapenos and just added it to the mixture. 
-I used light sour cream
-I used corn tortillas instead of flour

I believe those were the only changes I made to it. I used the pre-made green enchilada sauce as well. 

The good thing about this recipe is that my husband and I only ate 1/5 of the pan for dinner, so we have leftovers galore! 

5 Stars!

These were amazing. I omitted cilantro, because I don't like it, and used corn tortillas.  I also used rotisserie chicken and Mexican cheese.

My boyfriend went gaga over these enchiladas. He likes flour tortillas only for enchiladas so this was a perfect recipe. I played around with some different salsa using jalapeño, salsa verde, and I also tossed in some chopped green chilies into the sour cream mixture. Use less jalapeño salsa if you don't like too much heat. This will be our new chicken enchilada recipe ??

We didn't have cilantro, so I omitted it. I could not find green chili salsa so I used enchilada sauce. I found a hot jalapeño salsa that gave it plenty of spice & we love spicy. I also mixed some Mexican blend cheese in with the cheddar.  I made both flour & white corn tortillas, will not make the flour ones next time. We loved this & will make it again.

Cooked the chicken breast the day before in a slow cooker with the green enchilada sauce. Everything else, I followed the recipe as written.  BIG hit especially with the men in my family.

I love this recipe, and I have made it a lot.  It is so easy compared to the other chicken enchilada casserole (from Cooking Light Cookbook), and I love it just as much, although my husband likes that one a little better (but it is time-consuming).  The sauce is to die for.  I can eat it plain but have to save some for my family.  It has been too spicy for our children, so I just put a few enchiladas without the bottom and top sauce on one side of the pan (and that leaves more sauce for me and my husband).  It's really delicious and easy.

I made it with a bit of variance by using green chili enchilada sauce, sour cream, Mexican shredded  cheese,  shredded cicken, shredded cheddar, garlic, garnished with green onions and more cheese on top as I forgot to get cilantro at store. Very good as I use skillet pan , add chicken, sour cream, butter, Mexican and cheddar cheeses, crushed galic,  and green chili enchilada sauce, chili powder and heat together.  Then I add mixture to large flour tortilla in deep dish pan, adding more sauce and  next top with cheeses and green onions or cilantro.  Bake as recipe.  Top with guacamole, Pico De mallo salsa, sour cream or whatever you like! We even serve with warm tortilla chips  as very cheesy and saucey! Well lovedone for church functions and freezes well ahead of time.

Made these for a large crowd. Didn't really make any changes in recipe.   Super easy to put together and I also liked the fact that I didn't have to use Cream of Soup mixture!  It isn't my favorite enchilada recipe, but, it was great for a crowd.  I actually made ahead in 9x13 pans and froze, unbaked.  Everyone raved about how good they where!

This is a great recipe. I always get many compliments when I make it (which has been MANY times). I feel that 1 onion, even small, is a bit much. I usually only do half. Luckily for me, everyone I serve this too has been an onion lover so they don't mind. These ARE spicy, but delicious! You can vary the spice by adding less of the jalapeno salsa to the sour cream mixture, and more of the green chiles. You can also use a green tomatillo salsa instead of the jalapeno salsa. They still turn out amazingly good. Waiting until the enchiladas are bubbling in the oven is key. Even for about 10 minutes or so (of bubbling time). This ensures that the onions are cooked completely. I have taken it out upon immediately bubbling, and onions weren't quite cooked all the way. Even then, still delicious. Beyond delicious recipe!

I liked this recipe a lot.  I may have gotten a little heavy-handed on the cilantro in the sauce so may not use that much again; but overall, the dish was delicious.  I used corn tortillas and used another reviewers suggestion and fried them before I rolled them up.  I will make these again.

I only gave this recipe four stars because it is SO spicy. The flavors are really good though. Nice and creamy. Next time I will use half of the onion and replace some if the jalapeño salsa with more sour cream to hopefully cut some of the heat. I recommend following other reviewers suggestions to put the tortillas in some oil in a pan to warm them and help them remain crispier. I also removed the foil with 5 minutes left in the cooking time and then turned on the broiler for the last minute or two to get a bit of browning on the cheese. Yum!

I made 3 pans of this.  One pan without cheese.  I had 25 enchiladas total.  I fed 6 people, three teenagers and three adults.  Everyone raved about it!  Even my somewhat picky teens.  After everyone was finished and I put 2 enchiladas away for my daughter's school lunch there were 2 enchiladas left!  So much for thinking there would be leftovers.  The only things I changed about this recipe was I used corn tortillas, I added a can of black beans to the chicken mixture and I pureed a few jalepenos in the sour cream mixture.  It was a total hit.  I will be making this one again (and again!)

Use corn tortillas.  I made this recipe with both corn and flour tortillas.  Even with being heated before being filled, the flour tortillas turned out mushy.

Delicious! My husband, daughter and I loved it, while my teenager wouldn't eat it- but this is a child who is not adventurous when it comes to food. After reviewing others comments, I did make some changes. In order to ensure my daughter would eat it, I had to remove the heat-instead of jalapeno and green chille salsas, I used a corn & black bean salsa and a can of green chille sauce (which I also added chopped green chilles 
to), respectively. Like many others, I also sauteed my onions with a drop of olive oil and fresh garlic. After reading so many comments on the over abundance of cilantro, and due to the fact I was using fresh cilantro from my garden, I looked online to find exactly what a bunch is considered to be- loose leaves should equal 1 1/2 cups, so I scaled back to 1 cup. Also when I made the chicken mixture,I used 3 chicken breasts, added 1 drained can of black beans, about a cup of salsa and about 1/2 can of chopped tomatoes. Many people complained that flour tortillas were too gummy and fell apart, but I was unable to find corn tortillas - instead I used 7 burrito size tortillas and waited about 15 min before serving....no gummy mess, no falling apart. Leftovers for lunch were also a hit. Will defiantly make this again!

This was a pretty good recipe. I felt it called for a little too much canned jalapeno. Made it pretty hot. I used green onions instead of regular onion. Overall I'd say it's a keeper.

 I really loved the use of the blender. Will make these again.

These are great! I don't use the jalapeno salsa because we don't like it that spicy, but I just sub in a little more green chili salsa.  I also sauteed the onion first to soften it.  The thing I did that really made a difference was I added half a can of creamed corn to the chicken and cheese mixture and a small can of green chilis! I love this recipe and will make it again and again!

I could not find the 7 oz. cans of salsa indicated in the recipe. I used Mrs. Renfro's Jalapeño Green Salsa and Salsa Lisa Tomatillo Green Chile. I also used ground turkey instead of chicken. It was delicious and very hot!

I've made this recipe several times and several ways. So simple and so very delicious! One woman commented she's gotten marriage proposals from this dish... heck I want to marry myself when I make these. I pretty much refuse to eat sour cream enchilada's anymore when these are the best I've ever had. My favorite way was with fresh cooked chicken that I boiled with chopped garlic salt & pepper & shredded. Then I cooked white onion in a bit of oil and warmed up roasted red pepper, tomato, black beans, & corn. Threw all of that inside the tortilla with sauce & some cheese & topped more sauce with a good amt of cheese. I've made them with just the veggies tonight and I'm probably going to try beef ones soon. The first helping tonight ended up falling apart but after letting it set for a bit (when I went for a 2nd helping) they stayed together and were great as usual.

Prepared it for a group of friends. Wasn’t the hit I thought it would be but it was still pretty good. I followed a few of the recommended hints posted in the comments by Peachy and stephanie (labeled as most helpful positive review & most helpful critical review). I will most likely try this recipe again. Next time around I’ll try adding a different brand of green sauce and more cheese.

AMAZING!  With just a few slight modifications, this will be the best enchilada dish you've ever had!  Definitely substitute corn tortillas for the flour tortillas in the recipe.  I also suggest using a blend of cheeses--not just the cheddar.  I paired it with a winter sangria and it was spectacular.  Will be adding this to my authentic mexican repetoire!

I made two huge casseroles of this; one for my family and one for our neighbor who just had surgery. It was so easy and such a hit. My kids loved it, as did me and my hubby. My neighbor had never had sour cream enchiladas before and both her and husband loved it too. It was quick and easy to make. A keeper.

I have made the same chicken enchilada recipe for years and decided to try something new.  This recipe was fantastic!  I stack mine in layers instead of rolling them individually to save time.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

I tried this recipe today and it turned out very well, considering I didn't have any green salsa.  I had a medium salsa and a mild one that had lots of onions in it, so I combined those and the whole thing was delicious.  Ditto on the cilantro comments - a little cilantro goes a long way, so use it sparingly.  I halved the recipe as I was cooking for just me.  I only used a small handful of cilantro and it was plenty.  I took another reviewer's advice and removed the foil ten minutes into cooking, and that kept everything crisp.  Great recipe, I will definitely add this to my regular rotation!!

GREAT!!! Made a few minor changes: substituted Monterey Jack cheese for cheddar (family preference). Also, only put in as much cilantro as seemed appropriate for our taste (about 1/3 bunch). Did not use quite all the sauce and did not cover while baking.

If my boyfriend didn't already profess to love me he would after this. I worked with what I had on hand and had the help of a man, which meant the addition of a few gadgets, but the sourcream base gets all the credit. I didn't use cilantro and I made my sauce using half a can of green enchilada sauce, about 1/4 medium sized jalapeno, a handful of chopped onion and garlic, about 1/2 cup of sourcream, salt, pepper, cayenne, chilli powder and 1/4 teaspon cinnamon. The chicken was injected with a habanero/onion/jalapeno sauce (the man's contribution) and prepped w/ salt pepper etc. Garlic/onion/Jalapeno in olive oil heated in pan, chicken seared on both sides in pan, add chicken broth, slices of onion and bellpepper, cover and simmer like 20 min/so flipping every so often. Cool and shred--mix carmelized onions and bellpeppers w/chicken (chop first) and add any remaining chicken broth mixture from pan. Heated other half of green enchilada sauce and dipped tortillas in that, added chicken mixture and pepper jack cheese, rolled and put in dish with half of the sourcream sauce. Sprinkled cayenne over top of rolled tortillas, covered in cheese and remaining sauce. Baked 30 min, broiled on high for 5...amazing.

This works best if you boil your chicken... Shreds much easier.

Wonderful flavor!!! I would use this sauce for many different recipes with pork or chicken.  To saute or not to saute the onions first is definitely a personal choice.  I would add more chicken next time and less tortillas.  Lastly, I think taking the foil off for about 10 minutes at a slightly higher heat makes for a better enchilada.

Easy and delicious!  I doubled the chicken and it turned out well, would have been a bit thin without it.  Also used reduced fat sour cream and only one can of jalapeño salsa to reduce spiciness.   Yum, yum, yum!  Will definitely include this in my regular rotation.

Loved this recipe.  I've made it many times now and it's a hit around the house.  I usually add shredded cheese to the filling though.  Just made a vegetarian version last night using crumbled extra firm tofu instead of chicken and it was awesome!

This is a GREAT enchilada recipe.... I really liked the flavor of the jalapeno salsa and salsa verde!! The only thing I did differently was not using the blender, I just stirred the cilantro, jalapeno salsa and salsa verde into the sour cream ( I used Kroger brand sour cream with chives ). The filing was a little runny with the salsa verde in it, so I think next time I will only put half a can or use green chilis instead. I used 6 flour tortillas and 4 corn tortillas fried in a little canola oil first, the corn tortillas were a little soggy but I liked them the best. I thought the jalapeno salsa would be green but it was red! This was very good and I will def. make again! Thank you...

I used low fat sour cream and lower fat cheese as this was for someone recuperating from heart surgery. It was very well received. Also, easy to freeze and reheat so a good thing to take to someone sick.

My son rated this six stars.  He likes it so much he ate one for breakfast, lunch and dinner today!  I followed the recipe with the exception of putting the cheese inside the enchiladas and using green onions instead of regular. The sauce on top didn't look very pretty, but it was DELICIOUS!

Made it following the recipes except I sauteed the onion first so it wasn't so crunchy. Everyone in my family loved it and didn't think it was too hot.

This recipe was great! Since I didn't have half of the ingredients, I had to use what I had. I used 1 TBSP of parsley, and 1/2 cup sour cream and I used about 3/4 cup of picante' sauce. Then I used a can of green chilies, and had only 1 chicken breast and used 1/2 an onion.Then sprinkled enough cheese on top until it was all covered. All in all this was a great recipe, and still had plenty of spice. My fiancce' loved it.

This was fantastic!  We added half a packet of cream cheese just for kicks, and used regular salsa since we didn't have jalapeno salsa on hand.  Could use just a touch of a spicy kick (but not necessary at all), so we'll try it next time that way.  LOVED this recipe!!

OH my gosh this is SOOOOOO good.  You will not be disappointed with this!  I didn't have jalapenos, though, so I used diced green chiles and it was fabulous!  Even my VERY VERY VERY picky husband & 7yo thought it was delish!

Yummm...I made this for my sister, mom, and fiance and they all absolutely loved it. I used ground turkey instead of chicken and they were still fabulous! These are even great the next day! Very very good enchilada's. I also like how much this recipe makes for so little ingredients required. Thanks!

This was delicious!  I've tried several recipes from here before, but this was the best of all.  I love cilantro so I thought the flavor was wonderful.  I halved the recipe because I was only cooking for myself and froze the leftovers.  I did tweak it slightly because I didn't have any jalapeno sauce.  I blended the sour cream with green enchilada sauce, some diced green chiles, a whole fresh jalapeno, seasoned with garlic salt, and reduced the cilantro as other reviewers suggested (I used a small handful).  I also tossed the chicken with some of the green enchilada sauce, diced chiles, and cheese.  I omitted the onion because I don't like them.  Instead of baking the chicken, I boiled it in chicken broth seasoned with garlic salt and dried onions.  I used corn tortillas because I don't like flour for enchiladas, and charred them on the stove before filling.  This helps to keep them from getting soggy.  I placed the rolled enchiladas in an 8x8 pan with some sour cream sauce on bottom as instructed, then poured a little of the canned enchilada sauce I had before using the remaining sour cream sauce.  Topped with cheese and black olives.  Baked covered for 20 minutes then uncovered for 10.  Came out perfectly!  I'll definitely make these again.

These turned out great, and have a nice kick to them!  I added more sharp cheddar cheese and sour cream to the chicken mixture, which kept them softer inside. I also mixed three different salsas I already had on hand, and the substitution worked just as well. Will make these again!

This is a great recipe!  I made it last night and my VERY picky husband LOVED it!  It was quite spicy, but thats the way we like things!  I used a rotissery chicken and I think that probably made it alot better to have the moist flavorful chicken on the inside.   Will be adding this to our line-up for sure!

This was really good. I didn't have the jalepeno sauce so I just blended up a couple of sliced  j. peppers. Only other ingredient I added was about 1 T of fresh lime juice. I served this with cilantro-lime rice. They are both good on their own but together they are a great combination. The sauce in this recipe would be good in a lot of different recipes I think.

This are wonderful! Everyone that I have made these a few times and everyone loves them. I make a double batch and there still are no leftovers! I add some shredded cheese to the chicken mixture.

If you love cilantro you will love the sauce in this recipe. It's amazing the flavor it has with only 3 ingredients. This did make a lot of sauce though so I'll probably adjust the recipe next time and add an additional chicken breast as I would like to be able to have more filling for each enchilada. Enjoy!

Great flavor!!! I love cilantro, so the top sauce was great to me. I couldn't find jalapeno salsa at the grocery store, we are very limited here in Florida with mexican ingredients, so I used green salsa instead and added some fresh jalapenos as well. We loved it and will make it again.

These were great!!  I put about 1/3-1/2 cup of cheese inside the enchiladas with the chicken mixture.  I sauteed the onions as many posters recommended.  It was almost too soupy for me, probably won't use as much sauce on top next time.  Ended up topping with about 1/2-2/3 cup of cheese.  These weren't spicy at all--just right for a family with kids.  Thank you!

These were okay. They are spicy as some reviewers noted, but not overboard. I decided to try something new but my husband said he liked my enchilada recipe much better, so guess I will stick to that! Thanks tho!

These were the best enchiladas I have ever made. This recipe may be a tad bit hot/spicy for some. If that is a concern you want to watch that cilantro and salsa! But very good enchilada recipe. Can't wait to make this again.

My husband loves Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas, so thought I would try this recipe with a few changes.  Did not use cilantro or jalapeno salsa (did not have any).  Used extra sour cream and green chilies, onion and minced garlic for the sauce.  Added mushrooms to the chicken mixture, and used both cheddar and mozzarella cheese.  I cut recipe in half.  After it was done & on our plates we added Texas Pete Hot Sauce, so they tasted plenty hot.  Very Good.  Will make these again!

Made this tonight. Really enjoyed it, but WOW what a kick.  And I only had one can of jalapeno salsa on hand.  For my family i may go totally green salsa, cut cilantro in half, and just put jalapeno salsa on the side for my husband and myself.  Great recipe. Enjoyed the change!

This was really quite easy and REALLY REALLY GOOD!  I didn't change a thing--didn't quite use a whole bunch of cilantro, but could have!  Cut up your cilantro before putting it in the blender or it will just wrap around the blade and clog it.  This was excellent!!  Bravo!!

So good! I don't care for chunky chunky salsa so next time i make this i will use a finer salsa in the chicken mixture. Very good flavor - hands down better than anything store bought.

These were OK.  I found that the tortillas got a little too mushy (even though I fried them before filling and rolling them) and seasoning over all was a little bland (probably the salsas that I used).

I love enchiladas. I think the flour tortillas does well with this recipes better than corn. The cilantro was good but I thought a whole bunch was alittle much; just a little much. I used about half. Very good recipe thanks!!

These were great. I took advise from others and didn't use as much cilantro. Also used verde sauce as my market didn't have jalapeno salsa. Family loved it, will make again.

Ive tried several enchildada recipes and my boyfriend hasnt liked any of them, until this one. I actually forgot to add the cilantro because I was reading too fast, but they still turned out great. The salsa I got was a little too hot, but I still managed to shovel two of them in my mouth. :) The boyfriend says I should make this again, and he is hard to please as he is so picky, but this passed the test.

Nice easy dinner. Couldn't find the cans of jalapeno salsa so I used regular salsa for the chicken mixture and green chile salsa for the sour cream mixture.  Also didn't use cilantro because didn't have it on hand but they still were very good.  Would make again.

These enchiladas are so easy, and a wonderful way to use leftover cooked chicken.  I've used both white and dark meat and it's delicious either way.  A few things I do differently though:  I skip the jalepeno salsa, since my 3-yr old daughter doesn't like things too hot, and I usually add extra green chilis to take its place.  Also, I add about a 1/4 to 1/3 cup of cream cheese spread and a little onion with the food processor ingredients. Then on top, I sprinkle sliced jalepenos (deli ones from jar) for my hubby, and on top of mine & my daughter's I sprinkle sliced black olives.  Such a versitle recipe sure to please the whole family, and easy to make!!!

Really Really Good. I didn't give a 5 because it was a little too hot...and I enjoy something spicy. This made my stomach hurt a bit. Next time I will not include any salsa that says "hot". I just used 2 types of salsa that I enjoy. If you don't like crunchy onions then sautee them before putting them in. Also I just used about 5-10 sprigs of cilantro. I really enjoy cilantro too!This was a great dish! It was eaten by my husband and me within a day (I had some for breakfast :). I will make again with the adjustments above.

These were soo soo soo good. I was asked to give the recipe to both my husband's aunt and mother, a great change of pace for enchiladas! I didn't see jalapeno salsa at the grocery store so i used a can of green chilies mixed with jalapenos and some more of the green salsa. Also, make sure to warm up the corn tortillas before rolling them up... Very tasty!

This was really good. I couldnt find cans of salsa, so I just improvised. I used 1/2 of a jar of salsa and then half of a jar of white cheese dip. I also used pepper-jack cheese on top instead of the Cheddar. The prep time is a little off because it doesn't include the time it takes to cook and shred the chicken (it is simply listed in the ingredients, instead of the instructions). Will make again. Thanks.

These are so good, and pretty easy to make also. They remind me of the enchiladas that my sister-in-law makes. I use a rotisserie chicken, and also mix some extra cheese in with the chicken filling. I'll definitely be making these again.

Very tasty, and I'm extremely grateful for this recipe, since it got me rave reviews from my husband, and even my father-in-law, who is not quick with the comments. Thank-you! I did fry the tortillas on a griddle with Pam spray, and they were still a little soggy, but I was told that is what enchiladas are supposed to be like.

5 stars with modifications... first of all I used thighs instead of breasts and couldn't find the salsa's so used regular salsa and green taco sauce. Great for people who have kids and don't want it to be too spicy as some others have said. I didn't cover with foil and the sour cream mixture looked brownish like tuna. Didn't look very appetizing but tasted delicious. Next time I will cover it!

This was excellent! I loved the sauce with all that cilantro. I had thin-sliced turkey on hand, and put it in a food processor with the onion to get a nice chop. Next time I might cook the onion to soften it a bit. Thanks--this one is a keeper!

I changed a few things, it was a good start though.  I used a whole tub of sour cream and I mixed in green onions and 3 adobo chiles.  I used 2 chicken breasts that I seasoned with seasoning salt and garlic powder.  Then I added the canned green chiles, 2 cans of diced tomatoes,  cumin, and 2 cans of black beans.  I let that simmer for 20 minutes.  I also replaced the flour tortillas with corn.  It turned out delicious!

This recipe was tasty but I think I might change it up a bit. I fried my tortillas before rolling them as another reviewer suggested but to me they still tasted saugy.I think next time I might put the cheese inside, cook them for half the time and then add the sauce (after heating it) to the pan and cook for a little longer. Maybe that will help. They might be more like burritos but as long as they are tasty...

This was soooo yummy and easy!  Spicy but not too spicy.  You can add extra sour cream on top as you serve the enchiladas if you want to tone it down if need be, but we LOVED it!!

IMy husband thought it was really good though and like the sauce on it.  I thought the inside was pretty good but I wasn’t a huge fan of the sauce.  I will make this again though for my husband since he likes it.

This was amazing! The cilantro really gave it a zesty fresh garden taste.  The entire family loves this meal.  Super easy too!

Takes awhile to make, but worth it.  It's different from the traditional enchilada, very very good.

I've made this recipe quit a few times but I took some advise from some of the other reviews and made some modifications. I don't use the whole bunch of cilantro (too much can be over powering), 1 can of salsa (not jalapeno) and I prefer corn tortillas. And sometimes top it with black olives. My husband and I really enjoy these and I've also made it for friends and received lots of compliments. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I used white corn tortillas (we just prefer them, and think they are more authentic.) I added some of the sour cream mixture to the chicken mixture- yummy. I think the amount of heat is dtermined by the type of salsa you choose. I will definitely do this one again. We have leftovers for days, and they heat up well.

These are great!  To make for faster preparation, I used only Pace salsa and bought a cooked chicken from the grocers and it turned out wonderful.  Each time I make this recipe, I always get compliments. I highly recommend this recipe.

This is a really great recipe, although I must say VERY hot if you add all of the jalapeno salsa that is called for.
I have made it three times and have figured out just the right amount of salsa to add to make it the way my family likes it best!
Brava Brenda!

Recipe was a favorite for guests!  I prefer without cilantro.  Also, could not find green chile or jalapeno salsa so substituted with a jalapeno based salsa called green salsa and used 7 oz can of green chiles mixed with regular salsa and was excellent. For those that do not like chicken you can substitute with cheese and onions! Very Good!

I made this for friends and it turned out really good. I love the creamy sauce, but it might be a little thin. I will probably drain the tomatoes a little more next time. I made Spanish Rice as a side dish, and it was well received.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. I think next time i might use less cilantro and more sour cream. My husband wasn't to thrilled about it, but he said I should try it with some steak which I will probably do next time.

Today is my husbands Birthday and this is what he wants for dinner, he loves this dish, as dose the rest of our family. I always double the recipe, extra spicy in one dish and not so spicy for the kids in another. I use chi chi's salsa, (I cant find the one asked for) and it works great! This is a WONDERFUL recipe!!

This recipe is great!  I served to my in-laws and they absolutly loved it!  Next time I will use less jalapeno salsa and more green so that it isn't as spicy.  It was very easy to make and to double the recipe.  It has become a new family favorite.

These enchiladas were great.  Instead of cheddar I used Jack cheese and they turned out beautifully.
