This was really good! We love spinach/artichoke dip so I was happy to find this. I nuked 2 large chicken breasts in some of the broth while sauteing chopped onion and garlic in some olive oil, then when chicken was cooked, chopped and added it with the broth. I also added some chopped green chilies because I'm from New Mexico and I was craving some heat. I wanted the soup a little thicker, so I added some instant potato flakes and a little cornstarch and water. It was the bomb! My daughter sprinkled hers with grated parmesan and crushed tortilla chips and it really was like eating dip. Thanks for the great recipe!

this soup was very good. I made as written, used a rotisserie chicken which made this a very simple recipe to make. Next time I think I might skip the chicken and double the artichokes. Thank you for a great recipe.

I made this recipe but I didnâ€™t have artichokes in a can, instead I had marinated artichokes in a jar so I used those n the soup with the juice and my husband and I loved it so I am making it again.  Delicious.
