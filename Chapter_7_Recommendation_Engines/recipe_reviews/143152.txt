First, save your breath. I'm aware that I'm rating a recipe even though I changed it. Thanks.

I started making these before I realized I didn't have any tomatoes in the house. I also had put the last of the ginger in the house in with the swordfish I was baking, so I didn't use that either. Curry leaves? Who has curry leaves just laying about?

That being said, what I got as a result was pretty tasty. I'm definitely going to make sure I buy some curry leaves when I go out for tomatoes and ginger! Thanks for a great idea for a side dish. 

Oh, and I used an Anaheim chile. I'll likely use something with a little more heat next time.

This was an interesting dish.  I agree with Mister Umpire, who has curry leaves?  I'm not even sure I know what they are, but I did have the rest of the ingredients.  Very fresh and interesting way to have potatoes.  I used a can of green chilies and fresh ginger. Thanks for sharing.

This is a warm and tasty meal. It could be as a snack in sandwiches, or you may  represent it with white rice.
