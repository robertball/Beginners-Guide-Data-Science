I made this recipe yesterday and I think it is wonderful! I did do a few tiny changes but I think that if I had made none at all it still would be great....first and formost, I think that this recipe should be made during the day the first time. Slow cookers vary so much that it is a good idea to be able to keep an eye on it. I know that my old slow cooker would have probably burned this recipe, as it was my new one worked out perfectly as directed. The only changes I made was to use 3 apples (instead of 2) I added 1/2 cup of raisins, and lastly I grated in the rind of 1 lemon. I ate this cold for breakfast and I felt like I was eating a wonderful, delicious dessert.

I scaled it down for my 1 quart slow cooker. I used 1 cup steel cut oats 2 cups water, 20 oz applesauce, 3 small apples, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp brown sugar. I also added  a handful of dried cranberries. Cooked it on low for 8 hours and it turned out perfectly. Very hardy breakfast. Husband loved it too.

I would have given it a 4.5 but I didn't have that option. This was tastey. I did change it a bit to use what I had on hand. I used homemade apple butter, I had previously canned, and omitted the extra sugar. I also only had one granny smith apple so I used it and one gala. It has a nice apple tartness to it. When eating it, my husband and I added a bit of splenda while 3 children choose agave and 1 choose white sugar. I like my oatmeal a little thinker so next time (and their will be a next time) I will use a little less water. Otherwise, yummy start to a Friday fall morning.

Based on one review, I did reduce the water to 7 cups, and it cooked up beautifully.  Little too heavy on the cinnamon for our taste, so I will cut that back a little in the future.  By reducing the amount of water, it did cook a little faster than indicated, so mine was done in about 4 hours.  Garnished with freshly-sliced apples and a sprinkle of brown sugar.  Packaged and in the freezer for quick weekday breakfasts.

What a perfect breakfast to have on a weekday morning in the winter! It is warm and filling and comforting and so nice to have it ready in the morning. I added dried, mixed and chopped fruit instead of the apples. I thought it needed some salt to counter the sweet so I added 1/2 a teaspoon. I also added two tablespoons of olive oil to round out the texture and add MUFAs (monounsaturated fatty acids)to the meal. With these two additions, it was absolutely five stars! I used the steel cut oats and sprayed the pot and it did not stick. I will so be making this again and again. Thanks for posting it Debbie!

Made this last night....Did have to substitute apple juice for the apple sauce as i didn't have any. Added another apple and threw in a banana that was ripe and needed to be used up. Didn't have sweetener so I just used a tbsp of brown sugar.Cooked on low for about 5 hours,then popped the whole thing in the fridge overnight. Warmed up bowl this morning and it was awesome!! BIG cinnamon taste, so the only thing I would say is use less if you're not sure, I love cinnamon so I thought it was great! And I cut the recipe in half and still have enuff for 5 breakfasts, divided it up and put in the freezer-soo easy to take to work!! Thanks for sharing this!!

I guess I'm the lone person who didn't like this recipe.  I think it's because I'm so used to the sugary instant oatmeal that I needed more sugar.  I used brown sugar instead of the sweetener but will add more next time.  I will also use some almond milk to substitute for some of the water to make it more creamy.  But I'll definitely give it one more shot.  But for now, it didn't float my boat.

Really good. I added 1 more apple and some yellow raisins and omitted the sweetener. Did 3 cups apple sauce and 3.5 cups water and it cooked for 7 hours. Came out great!

For one was thought she didn't like oatmeal, this recipe has become my favorite breakfast meal.  I make a batch and eat it all during the week.  it's so tasty I forget that its even oatmeal.  To give it a little kick I add walnuts right before serving.

Its a wonderful recipe.  Very quick and easy, with staples usually on hand.  Although, my husband and I felt it did NOT need ant sweetener.  I did use 1/4 cup splenda, and I am sorry I did.  I will make this again but without any sweetener.
Also, when I first took the cover off, it was definitely soupy, but as it stood and cooled off a bit, it thickened up just fine!
A nice healthy addition would be some toasted walnut pieces.

This is a very convenient make-ahead oatmeal recipe. I'll admit I made a mistake right off the bat though. I misread the ingredients and thought that it called for apple juice instead of apple sauce. I didn't realize what I'd done until I had everything in the crock pot already. I did reduce the water to 7 cups, and I used two BIG Honey Crisp apples. I also tossed in a cup of fresh cranberries, and about 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. I cut the cinnamon back to 2 Tbsp and I used real sugar. This only took 4 1/2 hours to cook. I stored it in a Tupperware bowl in the fridge for quick breakfasts this week. The oatmeal eaters in my house all approve. Next time, I'll make it with the apple sauce and see if it makes a difference.

I did not have luck with this recipe. I made it as is with the exception of using less water based on other reviews. I used only 6 cups of water, and it still came out VERY runny and thin.  The taste was ok. Nothing special.

I liked this recipe a lot and next time I might add a couple more fresh apples as I'm an apple addict.  Based on other reviews I reduced the amount of water to just under 7 cups and it came out just right. Cooked overnight on low (6 hours) and then let it rest on warm until I was awake and ready for breakfast.  The oatmeal closest to the sides of the crockpot was a bit overdone, but that was minor and I didn't stir this at all while it was cooking, so what else would I expect.  Will make this again for sure.  Great winter breakfast!

This was my first try at slow cooker oats. I read lots of reviews & then took the plunge. It turned out great. I cut the water down to 7 cups based on reviews, only had 20 oz of applesauce, put in 3 apples, 1 T of cinnamon. Used a crock pot liner for easy clean up! I wanted it in the morning so I put it on low for 8 hours (since didn't have the 6 hour option on mine) & set my alarm to switch it to warm after 6 hours (for 2 1/2 more hours). It was the perfect consistency. It did collect in the edges which wouldn't have happened if I'd stirred it while it was cooking, but I loved having it ready when I got up! I didn't add any sugar or sweetener until it was done. Then added brown sugar to taste. I also didn't peel the apples. Too much trouble & they tasted great. 
My kids don't like oatmeal so I made theirs sweeter & one even asked for seconds!

Love this recipe!  Tweeked it a bit, using 3 apples, 7 cups of water instead of 8 cups, and used 1 tbsp of Splenda brown sugar. Added a few bananas and a ton of raisins. Husband never liked oatmeal but he tried it and wants to know when I'm going to make again!  Freezes beautifully too. It will be a regular. Brought to work and everyone wanted the recipe,

While I love cinnamon, it is clear just looking at the recipe that 1/4 cup is waayyy too much! I scaled it back to 1 tablespoon and put the cinnamon shaker on the table when I served the oatmeal so my family could add more to their bowl if they chose to. Beyond that, the water seemed like too much as well, so I scaled that back to 7 cups. I don't use artificial sweeteners, so I added some brown sugar, I just added a bit to the recipe to get it started, then had honey, white sugar and brown sugar on the table for my family to add to their own bowls as they chose, allowing them to adjust it to their own personal level of sweetness. I often add raisins or cranberries to this meal as well. With these few changes, this is definitely a 5 star breakfast and it is soooo wonderful to wake up the heavenly smell of this oatmeal in the mornings! I should also add, I only make this when I am feeding a bunch of people. If it's just me, the microwave is my go to appliance - it works beautifully too! :-)

My first attempt at slow cooked oatmeal, and this came out pretty well but a bit on the bland side initially. I took another reviewers advice and grated some lemon zest into it (towards the end) because that was my final taste test to fix it and it did the trick. It gave it a bit of dimension, which is just what it needed.  Oh and I used brown sugar in place of the splenda.

It is a soup. I used exactly half of all ingredients...(double and triple checked)...I have it on high now to evaporate some liquid.I believe it will be thicker when cool.

Made this today for the first time.  Based on reviews, I cut down the liquid a little.  I put 3 cups water and 3 cups milk in.  (Bear in mine, the apple sauce is also liquid.). I cooked it overnight.  Consistency-wise, it turned out great !  As for the cinnamon, I stubbornly put in the 1/4 cup as directed.  I'd probably cut that down to 1/8.  It didn't dissolve and it was like eating cinnamon. My finicky older boy wouldn't touch it.  My younger boy loved it!

It was ok.  I cut the cinnamon by half, added 1/4cup brown sugar  and a 1/2 t. Salt.  I will make again but cut recipe in half and add an additional apple or two.  BTW This freezes  and reheats  very well. I bag up two servings per bag  with my vacuum sealer.  Just add a little water and reheat in microwave.  Saves time during the week.

I followed one of the reviews to make the recipe smaller. The one for the 1 quart cooker. It was absolutely delicious! I don't like steel cut oats but will eat them now because of the recipe. I added a handful of raisins to the recipe. It was so good I ate a whole bowl. I also now have breakfast for the next 2-3 days.

I have hated oatmeal my entire life because of the mushy texture, but I loved this!  I didn't have apples on hand so I used some apple butter I made this past fall.  I cut back on the water so it would have a more hardy texture.  Awesome!  Thanks!

I had to doctor this recipe ALOT!  It was WAY TOO runny and tasteless.  I would use a lot less water or maybe substitute milk if you like a creamier oatmeal.

I use 4 apples instead of using applesauce, brown sugar and add a pinch of ground cloves.  My 103 year old Mom loves it.  She says it wakes her up in the morning smelling the aroma of it cooking. We have a bad reaction to artificial sweetners.
We like it with a little butter and maple syrup.

Fall weather is here and what better way to start the morning than with steel cut cinnamon apple oatmeal! I decreased water by 1/4 cup and probably would go a full cup less ( was too soupy) plus recommended decreasing at least half the cinnamon & sweetener too!

The only change I made to the recipe was to use cranberry sauce instead of applesauce and I used much less than the recipe called for.  I used exactly 8 cups of water/milk.  After cooking overnight for nearly 6 hours, it was soup.  It tasted good but it was not very appetizing.  I won't make this recipe again.

This is excellent. The only thing I would change would be to add less water. This is somewhat runny. Next time I will try 6 1/2 c of water.

I followed some of the suggestions given by other members and the oatmeal turned out great!  I used 7 cups of water instead of 8 and next time I will probably reduce the water a little more.  I also reduced the cinnamon in half and added 3 apples instead of 2.  It took the full 6 hours in the slow cooker on low to cook.

I woke up this morning to the wonderful smell of this cooking in the crockpot. What a treat! However, next time I will reduce the amount of water. I added a small amount ground flax seed to help reduce the watery texture for this batch.

I followed the instructions exactly. I thought it would be a nice surprise for my husband for breakfast but he didn’t like it at all.
He said it was too much apple and not very good. I tasted it and I found the same thing.

I’ve been making oatmeal like this for quite some time. It’s so easy  and convenient. Just set it up the night before going to bed and it’s all done in the morning.  I feel good about having a nutritious breakfast for my family to eat before starting their day. Very often they scoop up a bowl, add their favorite toppings and bring it with them. I have a set of those bowls with snap on lids that work perfectly. They can eat it on the go or wait till they get to where they’re going and reheat it.  I usually don’t add any sweetener as it’s cooking because everyone has  they’re own preference for sweetener and amount of sweetness. I always have options like real maple syrup, agave, honey, etc on hand so everyone can customize to their liking. I like mine with fresh blueberries, chopped fresh apple, dried cranberries and toasted almonds. Those are my favorites but anything that adds crunch is good. My husband likes his with just some additional fresh apple and maple syrup.  I usually keep a variety of toppings on hand, like fresh fruit, unsweetened coconut, chopped toasted almonds/pecans, dried cranberries, golden raisins,  etc.  
I only gave this particular recipe 4 stars because, I feel it has way too much cinnamon and I don’t like the use of Splenda. But, it’s very easy recipe to customize to your own likes.

I’ve been making this for years, and we love it. I usually use brown sugar or agave  in place of the  sugar alternatives. Also, Asian pears are good in lieu of or in addition to the apples. I’m old school and my cooker doesn’t have a timer, so I use an outlet timer, put it all together, and set the timer to turn on about 5 hours before I want breakfast ready.

Made this last night and me and hubby ate it this morning.  It was very good.   I halved the recipe and used around 3 1/2 cups of water (instead of 4).  The rest  I did as the recipe called for.  
Wasn't runny at all, as other people have said.  Very good consistency.  I think next time I will add more apples.  This will not disappoint.  The key is to NOT fill the crock pot.  It needs so space to circulate the air and heat!

Prepared to the recipe.  After 6 hours it's soup.   Flavor is ok but it's really soupy thin.  If you do this cut back from 8 cups of water to maybe 6.

I made this recipe as is and it was very good.  Then I made a few changes.  I used 7 cups of liquid, half water and half almond milk.  I used chunky applesauce and left out the diced apples (because I am lazy), and I used 1/8 cup cinnamon.  I used stevia for the sweetener.  I mixed it all together in a bowl and then poured it into the slow cooker.  I cooked on low, but it was ready after 4 hours.  Undercooking a little is good I think, so you can reheat it it with a little more liquid.  This will be my go to breakfast this winter!

I used the apple butter, two applesauce and about 1/4 cup brown sugar....everything else the same.  Waaaaay too much water. Once I strained most of the liquid out, it was very good.  Might try 4-5 cups of water next time.

This was so good and much better then those flavored instant oatmeal packets.  The one thing I wished I would have done is go over the reviews because my oatmeal was on the thin side. About half way thru cooking I  added more oats and another apple. Did not add the sugar substitute so we could  use  it if needed in our own individual bowls. Did not need 1/4 cup of the cinnamon and added some freshly grated nutmeg.  Kept nicely in the refrigerator for a couple days and no problems reheating it. Made and reviewed for the What's On The Menu tag game.

Changes: 
*less cinnamon than called for and add in a bit of cardamom as well
*used 8 cups of liquid but 4 whole milk and 4 water
*did not add any sugar
I had no problems cooking this on low for 7-8 hours and finding it perfect in the morning.  Easy to reheat if you add a little milk when warming up - usually reheat in micro which avoids drying out.

My daughter and I love this! I cut the recipe in half though, made too much the first time. I sub 1/4-ish cup of brown sugar or honey (whatever is closer) for the sweetener in the recipe. I would also recommend checking this hourly. I'm not sure how much slow cookers vary but I cooked on low and only needed 4 hours. Anyway, this had become a breakfast staple in my house! I make it on Sunday and reheat during the week. Thanks for posting!

I love oatmeal and was trying to convince my husband to try it. Was hoping this would be something he'd like and could heat and eat in the morning. I too cut back the water to 7 cups, but after checking on it at about the 4th hour of cooking, it was very watery. So I turned it up to High for the rest of the time. Now, after 6 hrs. of cooking, it's still oatmeal soup. It does smell good, but is kind of bland. I hate to throw it out; there's a lot. Maybe it will thicken as it cools or I'll just spoon it over toast or ice cream.

This is absolutely wonderful. I read previous reviews and my only modification was 7 cups water and added two the Granny Smiths and one Fuji for a little  added sweetness. Topped with raisins sometimes and walnuts or shaved almonds and topped off with heavy cream. Breakfast favorite for my daughter and wife.

I guess I come from a generation of cooks that follow a recipe exactly written the first time I make something. I did with this recipe and the results were fair. Too much liquid is in this version...make no doubt about it. I'm eating it now and it has no 'body' due to the water being the only liquid...it tastes hollow. As I read the other reviews now, I see that a few folks didn't like this soupy mess as well. Definitely cut back the water, substitute some kind of milk for a part of the water, definitely add some butter to give it that velvety texture (we did in each bowl after we ate half a bowl), and add some heavy cream to add some additional taste & texture. This dish begs for raisins & nuts if you like that sort of thing like we do.  Also, this make a ton of oatmeal...get the Tupperware ready.

Absolutely amazing!  This has everything I look for in a recipe- inexpensive, easy to make, appeals to a wide range of tastes and is, hopefully, healthy.  My family went crazy for this and have had it for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It makes a large amount when cooked and it tastes even better left over.  I think using a slightly stronger cinnamon would have been delicious but this recipe is A+, just as written.  Thank you!

I would give this recipe 5 stars, but I did not follow the recipe to a tee. I read several of the reviews, which were mixed, but what I took away was that the cooking time and liquid might need to be adjusted, depending on your preference for the consistency of your oats. I've NEVER had success with making steel cut oats at home, but love eating them out. I reduced the liquid, using just 2 cups of water and 4 cups of unsweetened almond milk. The other change I made was instead of 1/4 cup of cinnamon, I used 3 tbsp of Penzey's cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg, which added a really nice flavor. I did not add any sweetener and it was still a creamy, super yummy breakfast! I reduced my cooking time in my crockpot to 5 hours on low, and as someone else said, the first time you make this, make it during the day, or at least before you go to bed, so you can watch it and determine if you need to adjust cooking time and liquid content. I did give my oatmeal a few stirs during the cooking process.  I would use a crockpot liner next time for easier clean up, but all in all, it's a great healthy recipe with some adjustments.

Didn’t care for it. Not enough texture of the oats.  I didn’t add the sweetener because I use pure maple syrup on it.

this was wonderful goodness for breakfast on a cold winter  morn! I found it to be rather watery, even though I cut the water by 1 1/2 cups,, as some of the reviews stated. but I did not have steel cut oats, only regular Quaker oats. I will make this again when i get some steel cut oats. I also did not have any apples, so I subbed 1 cup frozen cherries. hubby said needs more sweet,  but he enjoyed it. thanks for the great breakfast idea!

I made this as written but scaled it using the Allrecipes recipe scaling tool to make 4 servings. I also waited until serving to add the sweetener and cinnamon to my taste. When I opened my slow cooker my initial impression was that the oats were too runny HOWEVER, once cooled to a edible temperature the mixture had thickened considerably and was  an acceptable thickness.  Other reviews said the recipe was too runny so make sure you are using  actual steel cut oats not quick oats, traditional oats or quick-cooking steel cut oats. This recipe results in an oatmeal that is very soft and the oats lose almost all their texture.  The apples cooked down to almost nothing but had a nice flavor. Also, since my small slow cooker does not have a delayed start or timer feature I used a household light timer to control the cooking time.  I will make this again

This oatmeal is wonderful!  I used less water, brown sugar instead of sweetener, and lots of raisins.  It smelled so good while cooking that I could hardly wait for it to be done.  I was a little hesitant about the 1/4 cup of cinnamon but it was just right!  I will definitely be making this again!  Thank you for sharing!

First, it's very good.  Secondly, decrease the water as all others suggested.  I went with 6 cups of water and 3 apples.  I threw 1/2-3/4 cup of craisins in also.  After a few hours it still looked soupy, so I sprinkled even more steel cut oats into the crockpot.  It honestly tastes like dessert!!!  I'm freezing 2 containers and keeping one in the refrigerator for breakfasts this week.  I'll probably throw some toasted pecans or pumpkin seeds on top of the oats for a hearty breakfast.

Good - my variations: Just 6 c water, just 2 TBL cinnamon, no sweetener. Added some Craisens too. Cooked on low for close to 8 hours. Next time will add salt and more Craisens. Maybe a banana. Maybe some vanilla. I sweetened my own serving with a little brown sugar. Super easy and it makes a ton. I now have breakfast for a week!

I followed the recipe exactly as shown! It looked just as pictured but the taste was a letdown! It needed to be sweetened, a lot! If I try it again, I'll defiantly use sweetened applesauce plus sweetener as needed...but it looked yummy!

Very yummy.  Will try with 7 cups of water because was liquid and I add two cups of cooked oatmeal from stovetop to help soak some of it up. Also 1/4 cup of cinnamon is a bit much.  Will add less next time. I did 2 Grannie's and 1 Red delicious, got several compliments.

Not sure what went wrong, but mine turned out like apple soup and I followed recipe exactly. I could have used 2 cups of water and maybe this would have better. I even cooked about 3 hours longer, to try and thicken up, and all that did was make the oatmeal stick to the sides. :-( hubby said, at least the house smells good...

It was good, but not amazing for me. I think this may be partly due to the sugar substitute. The oatmeal was sweet, but left a weird aftertaste. We actually sprinkled a little brown sugar on top before serving and that helped to balance it out. When I first started dishing it out it seemed very runny to me, but after it sat for a min it actually thickened up to a consistency we liked, but it if we had added milk like we usually like to do it would have been too runny again. My daughter really did not like how the apples turned out, they were total mush. Overall it was a good recipe but I probably wont make it again. I will stick to the flavor free varieties and let everyone add their own toppings/additions.

Tasty, easy recipe.  I added dried cranberries as suggested by another reviewer.  Husband added brown sugar to his as this version wasn't sweet enough for him.  I scaled the recipe down from the original 10 to 4 servings, and used a Honeycrisp apple.  Very good, overall!

Somehow it ended up tasting like wallpaper paste.  Like a gummy, watery substance with some tart apples floating around in it.  Not really a comfort food.  Maybe it was supposed to be a low calorie, diet oatmeal with all of the water & splenda??

It was okay.  I had to add more spices and sugar because my kids and I didn't really like it as is.  I'll look for other recipes before trying this one again.  It was easy to make though.  Oh, and I did use Gala apples instead of granny smith since that's what I had on hand.

Very runny and Tasted a little sour. Maybe next time wont use as much water and will try with different kind of apple.
