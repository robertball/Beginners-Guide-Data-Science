It was tasty, but just way too much butter. I'll probably cut that in half next time. I'd rather add more sour cream then all that butter. It was a great starting point, now I just have to tweak it a little

This recipe was just ok. The potatoes turned really mealy from the double cooking and for us that isn't a very nice texture. Added garlic and onion powders and made my own cream soup base. Also followed the recommendation of reducing the butter (only used about 1 tbsp).  We prefer ours with more 'solid' potatoes so I will continue to use my normal recipe.

We loved this recipe! I used cheese it crackers instead of cornflakes (Thats all I had on hand) and i added french fried Onins to the cheese it topping as well. I think I will keep the changes I made next time. I can't imagine this dish without the cheesey cracker addition!

This was perfect, but I agree with a little less butter. The flavors were just what I was looking for.  I added ham cubes to it and sent it home for my daughter and her family!

I made this for Christmas dinner.  Everyone loved it, even the picky eaters.  Was asked for the recipe.  Leftovers were also good. (There wasn't too much left.)
