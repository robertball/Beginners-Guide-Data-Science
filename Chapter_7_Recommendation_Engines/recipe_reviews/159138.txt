Awesome recipe for a great dressing.  This is the only dressing I use now and leave in the refrigerator in a mason jar.  Put this on 20 minutes or so prior to serving mixing often.  Yum, and thanks!!

Great recipe but don't ruin a healthy dressing with articial sweetener!  I used Truvia and it was great.  Real sugar is even better than articial!

Very good! I made my own "Bloody Mary" mix with Spicy V-8; otherwise made as directed (but reduced amount to 4 servings - this recipe makes a lot of dressing). Thanks for the recipe!

Store bought bloody mary mix is full of bad stuff.  I make my own with either Cambell's tomatoe Juice, the BEST tasting, or organic tomatoe juice.  I just add the typical spices and a touch of hot sauce, then followed the remaining directions except I added sugar rather than artificial sweetener.  Very nice!  Thanks for the idea; I apologize for changing your recipe; I usually hate when people do that then review; it's king of apples to oranges comparison, but your idea was new and different.  I love it!

Surprisingly good!  I added lemon juice and omitted sweetener.  Salt and pepper to taste. Never thought of Bloody Mary mix!!!

Very nice!  I added a bit more garlic, and only 1/2 as much sweetener.

Very tasty.  If you like a thick salad dressing, then this one is not for you.

A nice twist from a traditional salad dressing! I used half regular balsamic (since mine was the kind that is really aged and thick) and half golden balsamic. I also used Spicy V-8 since that is what I had on hand. I used about 2/3 Tbsp of real sugar since I didn't have any artificial. I think next time I will reduce the sugar amount a bit. But this is a refreshing change from typical oil/vinegar dressing. Will definitely keep in my repertoire of dressings!!!

Very good!  I eliminated the sweetener, by accident,actually, and we liked it even better.  I will continue to make it that way.  The best!

Good recipe but recommend slightly less balsamic. Great over the Yard House Chopped Salad.

Very tasty! My family is not a fan if creamy cole slaw so I use this as the dressing, everyone loved it! Would also be great slaw for fish tacos!

Very good made as is.  Maybe just a bit too sweet for me.  I will reduce sugar next time
