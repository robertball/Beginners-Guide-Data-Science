I love almonds so I wanted their flavor to take center stage. I used almond extract for vanilla and almond milk for almond coconut.  
the pancakes were quite different in texture. They were little dry. Also grainy, but that could've been my fault, I used Almond meal which is coarser than four. But I loved the almond flavor and didn't mind the low carb version of pancakes. Unfortunately, the children didn't like them. And FYI, this recipe only made 7 pancakes.

Use flaxseed meal for eggs and it didnâ€™t bind together. It break apart when cooking

Super useful pancake recipe! Along with the non stick skillet, use some coconut oil. Heat on my gas ranger was midway between med and lo, not so hot that the oil smoked. Make the cakes small, not one huge pancake in the skillet, wait for the little bubbles to form before flipping. I made a nice big stack for the week, they are sturdy enough to go into the toaster.  This recipe could be altered to be savory with spices and made a paleo bread side dish!

Yikes! I followed the recipe but it was a disaster. They stuck to the nonstick pan so I couldn't turn them. I dad the same problem with a nonstick that I sprayed.

Great recipe. Do not cook on medium low heat, though. What a mess. 

These pancakes are filling until lunchtime. Put this in your recipe arsenal for a great change from traditional pancakes. 

Will absolutely make these over and over. 

4 stars since they botched the cooking temperature.
