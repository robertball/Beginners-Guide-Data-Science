This recipe came out very tasty. For those wondering why there is not soup, it has no soup because it was created as a substitute for soup, as is clearly written in the description. It says 6 servings because there is a combined total of 24 ounces of chicken, and a serving of chicken is approximately 3-4 oz. Thanks for the recipe!

To the reviewer that is looking for the "soup,"  there is no soup.  It's just supposed to remind you of broccoli cheddar soup.  It's a broccoli cheddar stuffing, but no soup, people.  Read her  statement at the top.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't cube the cheese.  I used grated cheese cuz that's what I had and FINELY chopped broccoli .  Instead of rice I used frozen riced cauliflower .  Next time I will add some salt, pepper and any kind of garlic to the inside of the chicken breast.  It came out sooo moist.  This is a recipe you can play with and change to your tastes.

Very tasty and easy to make. I had to increase the amount because it wasn't enough for my family of 6 but they all loved it, even the ones who don't like broccoli.

The recipe is Very good..i was confused when I saw reviews that said they saw six chicken breast. The recipe calls for 4- 6 oz chicken breast . I added one more chicken breasts just because we are major Chicken Lovers. Very very good recipe. thank you. I only changed one thing and that was the cheese and we used a white sharp cheddar cheese

I made this as written just increased as there were 7 adults. I made it earlier in the day and refrigerated for several hours. It was really good and I was complemented on a great dinner. Tasty & moist. I made too much filling so I put it in a small ovenproof bowl, added a little chicken broth and put it in the oven the last 15 minutes, that was a hit too. I had added a bit of chicken broth to the chicken dish as I didn’t want it to dry out but it wasn’t needed. I used a turkey baster and  removed it before serving, saved it for another day. Thanks for a great recipe, I’ll make it again

I followed the recipe exactly but I thought it was a little bland. We love broccoli, cheese and chicken so I thought it would be a big hit.  Kids ate it but said they didn’t want it again.

Won’t make it again.  It would be better if there was a sauce to go over the stuffed chicken.

Really enjoyed this dish.  Iused one and a half cups of wild rice instead of the white rice. Give it a nice texture and unique flavor.  Also used extra sharp cheddar instead of regular cheddar.  Will definitely make it again.

I didn't make any changes and I felt it didn't have much flavour.  We didn't even eat it all.  I don't think I will make it again unless I decide to change it up quite a bit for more flavour and a different coating

This took a lot longer to cook than the recipe stated. I added a little milk for moisture since it seemed to be very dry. It was just okay. Will probably not make this again.

I liked that this was a complete meal inside the chicken.  I only added a salad on the side.  I think I would put mozzarella cheese for a creamier taste. I think I would add more spice next time.

Like others have said, some of the past poor reviews are comical. 
I thought it was excellent. I'm odd and like my veggies on the soft side when cooked  and was afraid they'd be crunchy... but the broccoli and cheese were perfectly cooked.  I'll certainly make this again!

No but next time will sautee veggies in butter with chopped mushrooms. Veggies were not cooked all the way and think mushrooms will give added flavour

What a great way to use broccoli stems I blanch, chop and freeze when we have fresh broccoli! I made a broccoli fritter mixture and had 1/2 chopped broccoli leftover and had some cooked rice. Instead of using thick breasts, I used Springer Mountain organic chicken breasts of average size (5 oz -6 oz), a chicken breast for each serving. I pounded each to nearly double the size inside a Ziploc bag. I then put the broccoli, cheese, rice mixture on top of the flattened breasts and rolled them. I baked them in an oval dish just large enough to hold the breasts. (Any filling falling out and the juices were caught in the dish. I covered the dish with a lid, not foil. I omitted salt from the stuffing and sprinkled Jalapeno All Purpose Seasoning on the breasts before rolling them. I used Colby Cheddar cubes and made a half recipe of filling for 2 breasts. Easy, quick, flavorful and economical. Since we eat fresh broccoli weekly, I have a lot of blanched and chopped stems in the freezer. I'll use them for this recipe again. A keeper. Hubby liked them.

No change to speak of. Some of you people need to carefully read the authors opening statement. There is NO soup involved !
