Love these!!!  The only problem I had with them was rolling in a ball.  So I put them in the freezer for awhile so the butter will harder up, and they were fabulous!!!!! I will make again and again.

I found that they are quite easy to make, but with just cinnamon and sugar they weren't that flavorful. So, I decided to add chopped almonds which made them quite delicious.  In the oven we used we found that 14 minutes was the perfect time setting. The dough was a little soft to make balls so just stick it in the freezer for a little and it makes it harder. If you don't like cakey cookies these are not for you.  Bon App!!

So, I've been craving a cookie for like.. a week and a half now, but couldn't decide what to make.  Since I don't bake often (or at all really) I don't have much in the house save for the very basics - so my idea of making chocolate chip cookies was out cause I didn't have any chocolate chips in the house!

BUT, to get back on track here, I did have the ingredients for this recipe, and better yet, I LOVE cimmamon.

I'm rating this recipe for five stars because it completely trashed my cravings, and was very yummy and easy to make.  Only hint I'd give readers is to make sure that you bake them long enough.. I could have let the first batch of 12 sit in the over for at least another 5 minutes to make sure they were cooked all the way through.

These were just ok. The texture turned out to be too cake-like for my taste. I also think they need more flavor; they would be really bland without the cinnamon-sugar mixture that you roll them in. These are ok for now, but I probably won't make them again. (also, I baked them at 325 for 10 minutes because I thought 300 sounded too low for a cookie.)

Too sticky, add at least one more cup flour or cut one egg.. Taste too plain, add vanilla or cinnamon. Won't make them again.

Very easy to make and quite a tasty cookie. I am notorious for not being able to make cookies for some odd reason, and this one is a great shape and has a pretty good texture. It's a little hard for My taste, but it is a nice cookie.

These are so good. If you bake them at 275*f and wait until the edges are just about golden on the bottom to pull it out. So then just let them cool on the pan. I would also recommend greasing the cookie sheet lightly to help prevent the sugar mixture from sticking to the pan.

These were super easy to make and relatively tasty. I added a bit of extra vanilla, but I think I might add some cinnamon to the batter as well. More spice is always nice!

I also agree with other viewers that this recipe was a little bland without the sugar-cinnamon topping.  Also, I found it difficult to roll without freezing first.

I've only made these one time, but really thought they were great.  Not too sweet, which I feel sugar cookies can sometimes be, and also nice and soft.

The only reason I give 4 stars is because I changed the cinnamon to sugar ratio for the outter coating.  My first batch was just too cinnamony for my taste, so I added another 2 tablespoons of sugar to the mix.

Great recipe!

Very easy to make! Very kid friendly!  Tasted ok, not the best. I def added more flour to batter & rubbed on hands many times! Also put them in the fridge before I was able to roll them into balls. Very sticky! Added extra cinnamon too. Smelled great cooking!  Prob will not make again.

We really enjoyed the recipe. We used extra cinnamon and sugar on top and the second time we made them, we also drizzled chocolate on top after baking. People asked for the recipe and devoured them both times I made them. These are great cookies for many reasons but my favorite reason is that we usually have all the ingredients already in the house! :)

I love this recipe. I make these cookies every year. A few tips for working with the very sticky dough: chill for a few hours in the refrigerator (this is something I do with most of my cookie batters, it keeps them from flattening out) and use gloves (I used powder-free vinyl gloves) to roll the dough.  The gloves keep you hands clean and dry. Low temperature and longer bake time make this cookie great! Great recipe!

I love that this recipe is simple and quick, and can be made with ingredients that are typically always in my pantry. I noticed that a lot of reviewers needed to refrigerate the dough before being able to roll it into balls. What I did instead was toss cold butter into the bowl of my KitchenAid Mixer along with the sugar, and that thing was able to cream it with little effort. In the end, the dough was firm enough that I didn't have to refrigerate it. 

I have to agree with the reviewers who said these are BLAND, though. I think something needs to be added to the batter: maybe nuts, currants, spices, chocolate chips--SOMETHING. But the taste isn't really that satisfying, and doesn't have that typical "sugar cookie" flavor. 

But the fact that these were so quick and easy makes me want to try them again with one or more of the aforementioned alterations.

I made these cookies this morning and they were absolutely a huge hit! The only thing I dod was set them in the fridge to let the dough harden a little,  it made it a little more manageable, I have saved this recipe and plan to make them again, also I added Hershey kisses (baking ones) on top, sooo good!! :)

I read reviews where they said the cookies were slightly bland, so I added an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of cinnamon to the dough. I also read reviews where they said the topping was too cinnamon-y, so instead of making the sugar:cinnamon ratio 2:1 as the recipe suggests, I did 3 tbsp:1 tbsp. My dad loves them and I also think they taste great this way. Best of luck!

I was craving something sweet with cinnamon and I found this recipe. Amazing! it was so easy to do and the cookies came out great. I re-calculated the serving size to half and it was fine. I ended up baking them about 20 mins though (I think my oven is off). I will definitely be making this again!!
