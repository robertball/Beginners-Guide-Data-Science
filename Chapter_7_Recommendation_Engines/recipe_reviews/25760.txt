This is a great soup, fantastic on cold nights. Since there are only two of us, I place our servings in a smaller pot and cook the noodles only for those portions... keeps the noodles from turning mushy in the leftovers.

This soup was delightful, with delicate flavors.  It was easy, and fairly quick to make (I cut up all the veggies ahead of time).  I added some wine (about 1/2 cup), 2 tbs of rice vinegar for a slight sour kick, and some chopped cilantro for added flavor.

Ok, after reading other reviews and analyzing the recipe, I made a few small changes, but the recipe would still be great without them (hence, the 5 stars!).  The changes that I made were to use ground ginger instead of minced (what I had on hand), 2 cans of cut baby corn instead of carrots, sauteed mushrooms instead of the celery, and used ramen noodles in place of vermicelli.  I also added a little sesame oil to my bowl and had everyone else at the table taste it...they ended up adding it to theirs also!  I think the only change that I will make next time is to cook the noodles separately and put them into each bowl and then ladle the soup over the top.  Just a personal preference!

Also added spinach, napa cabbage.  Used a full pound of shrimp.  Added a dash of sesame oil.  Used soaked rice noodles.  Soak in hot water 10 min then cook with the soup.  Would make again.

We really liked this at our house.  It was easy to make.  I didn't use celery becasue I don't like the taste, but I think water chestnuts would be good for some crunch.  I also would use different noodles next time.  The rice ones I got at my store were about 3 feet long in a big ball and very difficult to break or cut.  Any helpful hints?!  I'm using udon noddles the next time.  Overall very good.
Update: I make this all the time now and I use 2 packs of ramen noodles, just the noodles, not the seasoning packet.  So easy.  I also always use water chestnuts and no celery.

I cut the ingredients in half but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  It came out great.  I think the trick is not using low-sodium chicken broth.

We love this soup! Even my young daughter eats this. I use pre-cooked frozen shrimp because I always have it on hand.

Easy to throw together and doesn't need too many exotic ingredients.  I'm a grad student, and this was great to serve to a bunch of friends for not much money ;)  Great light soup.

This was such a good recipe! I love really flavourful foods, so I was worried that it would be bland because it was so simple. That wasn't the case at all, it was awesome! Definately a keeper for nights when there isn't much time left to cook. Thanks alot!!!

Awesome meal.  Super easy - it was finished in 40 minutes even with three young, tired kids in and out of the kitchen and every single person in the house liked it!  That doesn't happen often.

Very easy and very good followed the recipe exactly. I had to add extra noodles because I like them. WOuld also be good with scallops. I stored the extra noodles seperate, and the next day heater it all up together. I could not believe how good it tasted the 2nd.day. Next time I will make a double recipe of this wonderful soup. I would give this 10 stars if possible.next time I will add shittake mushrooms

Excellent!  I added diced chicken breast and mushrooms which I stir fryed with the vegetables, then added the seasonings and broth.  I substitued powdered ginger to taste.  I also cooked the noodles separately and added them to the soup just before serving.  This is great without the noodles for a healthier version.  I absolutley love this recipe.

Fast and delicious.  I normally use frozen shrimp and frozen peas and just let them cook a little longer before I add the noodles.  Also delicious with cellophane noodles in place of rice vermicelli.

Well, I couldn't fine rice vermicelli, so I used glass noodles, the problem was that you can't really break them.  They all entangled together making the soup hard to eat.  So you might not wanna do that, or you'll loose points in presentation.  But the taste was wonderful.  Thank you Lindsay.

Tonite I needed this soup! I think it was quite tasty. I did substitute the snow peas for edamame. I also used frozen shrimp instead of fresh, and instead of vermicilli I used thin whole wheat pasta (still broke it up into 2 inch pieces). I opted to eliminate the celery, not a big fan of it. This soup was perfect for this chilly winter evening.

This soup is so good, and is as good as you make it. You can develop the flavor as you go, so make sure your broth is excellent. Add shrimp at the end since they take no time to cook. Really good with Napa cabbage, snow peas, carrots, and bean sprouts added.

Great soup!  My entire family loved it.  I added two whisked eggs at the very end.  I have also made the soup with rice instead of noodles.  The family loved it both ways.  Thanks for sharing.  :)

I LOVED this soup, and my family thought it was good, but not jumping up and down kind of good. the tiny bit of red pepper really did give it more kick than I was expecting. I added a can of baby corn, green onions, and some broccoli that was left over from the previous nights dinner. Will use again!

As warned, this recipe turned out a bit bland for me. I tried to follow the recipe as much as possible, other than substituting green onions for celery (I don't really think it made a huge difference overall), sugar snap peas for snow peas (my grocery store didn't have snow peas - weird!), and using a thicker rice noodle (which I think was a good choice). Soaked the noodles for several minutes before adding to the soup. Used low-sodium broth, which was I'm sure the culprit. The mix of ingredients was good though - the ginger and onion were great (I used a sweet onion), and the other veggies and the shrimp gave a nice flavor. With the blandness of the broth, the red pepper really is what salvaged this dish - it was spicy, but not too spicy for my wimpy tongue. A happy mistake actually made this dish a thousand times better: I accidentally left the stove on low while I was eating, and when I went back for seconds, the soup had simmered down and the broth was significantly reduced. The noodles soaked up the broth, making them fluffy and flavorful, and the rest of the ingredients were more pronounced. The reduced dish was not as soupy, but everyone at the table (me, my boyfriend, and a friend) all agreed that it worked well. If you like salt and want more soup than noodles, I suggest going by the book on this recipe and using full-sodium broth. If you're trying to watch your sodium intake, use a smaller amount of the low-sodium broth and cook the soup on low for much longer.

Wonderful soup! Mine turned out fairly spicy (I guess I put in more than a pinch of the red pepper flakes), which is fine with us, since we love spicy food.  However, the soup was also crying out for some fish sauce after it was done, which I added, about a tablespoon and a half

This soup tastes great and the most its easiest and fastest to cook. I was not having celery but I added scallions and a quarter of green bell pepper cut into thin slices. 
My husband has become a fan of this and always ask me to make this whenever we have to rush and I don't have much time to cook.

I needed to use up extra shrimp from a party.  This soup turned out easy and fabulous!  Instead of cooking raw shrimp, I added my (leftover) pre-cooked shrimp at the last minute.  I don't like spicy, so I was nervous about the red pepper -- no problem.  Wonderful flavor.  Attractive appearance.

This is a seriously delish recipe that is fast, easy and a crowd pleaser. I use sesame oil instead of vegetable oil to sauté the onions etc. I double to triple the ginger. I also add a few tablespoons of seasoned rice vinegar for an extra kick. I didn't have rice vinegar on hand this time and something was missing. Still good but not great. I use whatever size shrimp I happen to have. Sometimes they're mini pre cooked that I throw in frozen.

Delicious! I used vegetable stock instead of chicken broth, cabbage instead of celery and omitted the snap peas because I had none. I also added a dash of vinegar white wine. At the end I topped with Green onions and cilantro. Perfect for a cold night.

A wonderful base chicken broth with a little bit of flair.  Extremely easy.  Tip: I made the broth with the onions, carrots and celery ahead and heated it up later for smaller portions. And I used ginger paste that I found in the salad section of my grocer. When ready to chow down - I re heated the broth with raw frozen shrimp (peeled and deveined) and afitting amount of dry noodles (3 mins in microwave) thrown in.  I topped with the snowpeas (sliced) and some extras veggies (spinach and green onions for example) as toppings for xtra content and a nice crunch.  This was good with or without shrimp (add chicken if you want).  It's a great soup!!!

Addicting!!!! Couldn't put my spoon down! didn't have all ingredients but used what was avail in my fridge: used sliced zucchinni for my veggie (instead of snow peas) used ginger root from the tube (not fresh but still was awesome) took a pkg of ramen and used the noodles (no vermacelli) and I had frozen dumplings from Costco in freezer so I used those instead of the shrimp - cooked noodles and the dumplings seperately. I also used sesame oil and a bit more than a pinch of red pepper. This was so good it tasted like I ordered out!!!! and was ready in20 min!!!!!!!

I had to use what I had on hand, so my ingredients do vary. Still, I needed the recipe for the relative amounts and techniques. I used some lemongrass from a pot on my patio, jarred minced ginger (no fresh,) asparagus (cut diagonally) and frozen uncooked, tail-on shrimp (which I gently heated in the 2 quarts of water that I eventually strained and added some chicken base to for a slightly fishy chick broth.) Everything else was basically the same. At the end, I added a dash of sesame oil. Just what I was craving tonight, and it was really quick:) Thanks for hitting the spot! I'm giving 'my' version 4 stars, because I didn't have enough fresh lime juice on hand, which would have bumped it up a notch. I'm betting that as written, it would be 5 stars. Looking forward to trying it again with fresh ginger and more limes. I kinda liked the asparagus though . . .

This was ok but I must have done something wrong because it burned my throat.  The spiciness of the red pepper and ginger were strong for me, maybe I made a mistake.  No one wanted to eat this in my house so hubby will be stuck taking it to work... He's the human garbage disposal.

Excellent soup! I followed the recipe for the most part but sauteed mushrooms with the garlic, used green onions that I put in at the end instead of regular onion, and added cilantro before serving. I used low-sodium chicken broth and only 1 tbs soy sauce and added about 1 tbs of lemon juice for personal taste. Also, I had to use powdered ginger because I didn't have fresh.

Delicate flavors, I took the advice of  another post and added cilantro and rice wine vinegar.  I think the recipe would have been bland without these additions.  Next time, I would add more shrimp.  I ended up cooking more shrimp with a cajun seasoning and adding it to the leftover soup.  Overall, very good and filling.

A little bland. I took the advice from another review and used low sodium soy sauce. I probably shouldn't have.

This was a great recipe, but I made the mistake of adding a little too much crushed red pepper, so it was way too hot!  Also, I think next time it would be better to cut down on the soy sauce just a little because It was just a little too salty for my taste.  Good healthy recipe, though.

We used homemade shrimp broth and a pound of shrimp.  Also used Kluski noodles instead of vermicelli and added snow peas about 3 minutes before serving (add to your taste).  Excellent, will most definitely make it again.

It was pretty good, altho there wasn't much flavor.  Or maybe cause I didn't really follow the recipe all that closely, but I liked the flavors all together.  Just added some salt to make it saltier.  Um, I also served it with pho noodles, and made it a noodle dish instead of just a soup dish.  Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used low sodium broth. It was good, but missing something. Worth making again, but next time I will use regular broth and try some of the other reviewers suggestions: e.g. fish oil, rice vinegar...

I made this and it turned out great. I made two modifications - minor. But I know without my mods it still would have tasted great exactly as is. I added two sliced and sautéed chicken breast (I had to use them) and one tablespoon of seasame oil. That's it, this recipe was fantastic.

Solid recipe, though I didn't follow it precisely. I used a bag of frozen mixed seafood from Trader Joe's and skipped the carrot and snow peas. My trick to make soups taste Asian is a few drops of toasted sesame oil. I also added turmeric and curry powder.

This was tasty and all family members liked it.  It is easy to customize, but I think sesame oil is mandatory here.  I've used shredded chicken, eggs, fish cake, leftover turkey, silken tofu just to name a few proteins that work.  Cabbage, bok choy, tatsoi, sharp tasting greens all work for the vegetables, but we like the standard carrot, shallot, celery base too.  Have fun with this -- the more your kids help in the kitchen, the more adventurous their eating will become.

This is one of the best soups ever! Very soothing, tasty, warming, and satisfying.  Very clean flavors and the burst of crushed red pepper gives it an extra pop. Perfect for gluten-intolerance - just need to make sure the chicken broth and soy sauce are GF.

This was a very tasty soup and easy to make! I couldn't find the rice vermecelli and did not add the soy sauce (I'm on a low salt diet); I added a dash of rice vinegar, 1 1/2cups of cooked rice, and used low-sodium chicken broth. the vegies were cooked to the perfect cruchiness, and the broth subtle and flavorful.  It was the best i've made to date - at least that's what my friends said! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I really liked this soup. It was relatively simple. I had to make a slight adjustment and use ground ginger in place of minced, and I didnt have any snow peas on hand. My one gripe was that the soup was just a tad bit bland for me. I added extra crushed red pepper but it still needed something more. I think next time I may add  from cilantro or green onions for additional flavor- otherwise it was great!

This is a great soup recipe.  My husband requested it again soon after we made it the first time.  I had never worked with fresh ginger before, but read online to peel it with a spoon and it worked great.  Very tasty combination!

This tasted really good! I did alter by using chicken instead of shrimp, adding fresh cilantro, rice wine vinegar, & Sriracha hot chili sauce too taste.

I did not care for this recipe. In my opinion, it had no flavour.

This was really good.  Did moderate it slightly to suit my taste, like omitting the celery, and using angel hair pasta rather than vermicelli, but still a really good soup, and something I will be making again.

I used this recipe because I had my husband's Ramen noodles left from his bachelor days.I did make a few changes and some additions (don't kill me) but I wanted to make this recipe more hardy. I used 1 tsp ginger spice instead of fresh, regular peas instead of snow peas, and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. The Ramen noodles replaced rice vermicelli. I do not use (or have) crushed red pepper. My additions were: fresh spinach, sliced mushrooms, chopped green onion and canned water chestnuts added to the broth. The following were added in the last 5 minutes: Ramen noodles,thawed peas, thawed shrimp, canned bean sprouts, and even one chopped scrambled egg. The result was a very flavorful, filling meal served with Jasmine rice and chinese noodles. I am pleased with the results; it seemed restaurant quality and am looking forward to tonight's leftovers.  **UPDATE** The next night I easily added another cup of water,  more carrots, celery, spinach, celery and noodles: it's like the never ending soup!

Made as written, this is pretty boring. I ended up adding sliced green onions, sesame oil, a shrimp-flavored bouillon cube, and a little fish sauce. This improved it alot. I also thickened it a bit with cornstarch/water. Not bad but I won't make it again.

I'm allergic to seafood but I made this dish for my parents. They absolutely loved it!  I was basically using this recipe to finish and clean up all the leftover veggies in our fridge.  I also added 1 cup of snap peas, used 6 cans of chicken broth, and used pre-cooked cocktail shrimp.  I omitted the soy sauce and substituted the vermicelli noodles for 2 packs of udon noodles.  It smelt great!
