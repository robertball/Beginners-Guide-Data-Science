Really good!  I used homemade enchilada sauce, and I threw in a tiny bit of cilantro and green onions for fun, but I think even without those additions they would've tasted great!

I really liked this..Minor things I'd change next time, but those are more personal preference than any issue with the recipe.  I'd add more salt and pepper to the veggies as by the time everything had baked, it needed more. Also. a little more heat.. perhaps I got a mild jalapeno? I used a Mexican cheese blend instead of two different cheese and it came out fine. I really liked this idea of using broccoli as the main component  of this dish. Did I miss the meat? Maybe a little.. Last thing.. this tasted better the next day so make a day in advance if you can.. flavors meld
