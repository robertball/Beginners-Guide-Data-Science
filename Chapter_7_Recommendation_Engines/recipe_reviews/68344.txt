I was intrigued by the use of cracker crumbs instead of flour so I had to try this recipe. It is so good. It has just the right mixture of sweet/salty.

I used to make this dessert years ago only I used Ritz crackers and either blueberry or cherry pie filling. It is delicious even if it sounds "funny" I am so glad to find an old favorite!

Terrible waste of ingredients. Baked as directed. It had a very hard crust (did NOT spring when touched) that cracked when touched. Terribly disappointed.
