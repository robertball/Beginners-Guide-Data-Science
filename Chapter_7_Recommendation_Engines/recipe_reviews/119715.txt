I added a huge diced zucchini and a 1/2 cup of diced celery with the first vegetable addition, then a can of rinsed canned black beans along with the tomatoes. I used 3 jalapenos instead of 1, should have put in at least 4 (I like a bite). With all those additional veggies it looked like I need more than 1 can of stock so I added another can, but that turned out to be a little too much. Still tasted great but a tad too goopy so next time I'll use 1 can and a half of stock to make more of a "stew" consistency.   As written very hardy but healthy. I love that combo!!! Feels good in the tummy.  This one's going in the regular rotation.   -- Edited to add that leftovers are great wrapped in tortillas!

Enjoyed this recipe.  Used low sodium, low fat broth and threw in a zucchini that was in fridge.  Used a dollop of sour cream at the table to enhance flavor.

I love this recipe; it's great every time!  It does have a kick, which I love, but I use a small jalape√±o and usually double everything else (so it's not too spicy for the kids).  I have also added a mix of sweet potato and white potato.
