This recipe is so amazing. It even tastes better the second day. I didn't have pears on hand so I used pear preserves instead. Also, I seared the tenderloin in the oil and onions first in a dutch oven. Then I added the other ingredients, stirred the juices together and basted them over the pork. Next I baked it covered in the oven. I used fresh rosemary and didn't actually measure anything. It still came out fabulous. We have also used this method to cook boneless pork chops. They weren't as tender but the flavor was still excellent. We served this with sweet potatoes and learned that the broth on top of the sweet potatoes is wonderful. We also want to try it with polenta or grits. This is our new favorite recipe and plan to make it often, especially for company.

Loved it.  Followed the reviews and seared it first in a dutch oven on the stovetop, added everything else and then put the whole thing in the oven.  I agree that this recipe does not need much olive oil.  I put in about 2 Tbsp and that was good.

I added a bit of extra pear to this dish (because I had a few pears to use up).  It turned out quite nice - a very mild taste (not overpowering).  Very easy to prepare.  I'd serve it for company or just for dinner with the family

This came nice and tender, but I thought there was way too much oil, so I would cut that back to maybe 1/2 cup.  I used two 1 and 1/4 lb tenderloins with two pears, the same amount of oil and spices, and double the onions.  I used a Chardonnay which balanced the sweetness of the pears nicely.

This recipe was so easy and turned out much better than I expected. I cut the olive oil to 1/4c and used 2 soft ripe pears, about 2 tbl sp of fresh chopped rosemary, 2-3 shallots instead of pearl onions.  I also seared the pork on the stove prior to baking and used a pino grigio with pear and fruit undertones, it was absolutely divine! The pork was really tender and the sauce was tasty, but not overpowering, actually it was really delicious, and I am not a big fan of pork . I can't wait to make this again and again!  It is now a family favorite!

very good!  All the kids and husband liked this.  Some changes I made were:  2 TB. of grated onion to the mix, reduced the olive oil to 1/3 c. and I added whole pearl onions instead of chopped.  Uncover for the last 10 min to reduce the sause a little for the table.

I cooked this on a bed of diced parsnip, sweet yellow onion, and turnips, and basted the pork with the wine/olive oil mixture as it cooked. Served on toasted Israeli couscous (large pearl couscous). Loved it!

Very good pork recipe. Have used on boneless pork chops. Marinate for at least an hour before cooking. Good to pound pork when mixing in marinade to tenderize meat.

Made this for my husband on Sunday evening and we loved it! I sauteed chopped onion in a dutch oven, then seared the tenderloin so it was browned before adding the remaining ingredients. I also reduced the amount of olive oil to perhaps 1/4 cup. I baked it partially covered and it was super tender and delicious.

Loved this recipe!!!!  Did use cannned pears because that's what I had on hand.  I used the pear juice instead of most of the olive oil.  I do think I will decrease the liquid next time........but, loved this recipe!!

It smelled awesome when it was cooking but we found the pork to taste very bland.

I marinated this overnight because we had a change of plans.  It smelled so good.  I followed the directions exactly, but I used two tenderloins.(1 package)  By the time we checked it at 40 minutes they were over cooked.  The flavor was excellent, but next time I will reduce the cooking time and remove the foil half way thru.  I also think marinating it overnight removed the pear flavor, so I won't marinate so long next time.

I was blown away by this recipe. Following reviews, I seared my pork tenderloin (4) pieces on a cast iron, then turned off the heat, dumped the pear mixture and some diced onions on top (didn't have pearl onions).  I used an inexpensive but good white bordeaux and baked covered for half an hour at 375. It came out perfect! Will definitely make this again.

Increased the garlic and decreased the olive oil a bit, but other than that, kept the recipe the same.  We did not marinate, but I definitely will next time.  This was even better the next day after sitting in its juices in the fridge.  I think if we marinade next time around, it'll be a 5 star recipe in our family.  I'm not very experienced in the kitchen and found this to be super simple, lovely, and one that I could feel good putting on the table for guests.

Very tasty. I used a peeled unribe pear, and it was perfect. Used white grape juice instead of wine.
