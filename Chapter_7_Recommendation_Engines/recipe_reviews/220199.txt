Am giving your tasty recipe a four star rating. Would have given it a five had you punched up the flavor by marinating the asparagus first.

To marinate: Place the asparagus in a shallow baking dish, triple the lemon juice and olive oil, drizzle over the asparagus and marinate at room temperature for one hour, turning about three or four times. Then drain off the marinade and toss with the parmesan to coat. Be sure to use fresh Parmesan instead of the jarred type that has added salt and chemicals to keep it from lumping during storage.

If your grill doesn't have a grill plate use two bamboo skewers instead of one to thread asparagus spears for easy turning and to help keep the asparagus from slipping through the bars. Heck, whether you have a grill plate or not use the skewers for easy turning ;-)

If you're a garlic and lemon flavor lover add one teaspoon of minced garlic to the lemon and oil marinade.

Nice easy - fast recipe.  We love grilled asparagus.  I like garlic but not everyone does.  I used a grill topper so the asparagus didn't fall through the grates .  This is a great spring treat.

This an excellent way to cook veggies. I do it in the oven on a sheet pan lined with foil under the broiler. It works with Asparagus, Cauliflower, Broccoli, Brussel sprouts, Potatoes, etc. This is a basic procedure in my kitchen. I use this for stews, soups and pasta sauces. It adds a wonderful flavor to any dish or just by itself as a side dish. Try it you'll like it!

I make asparagus on the grill often but I've never cooked it directly on the grate.  This was fun to make!  After coating them with the olive oil and lemon juice I seasoned them with fresh cracked pepper and smoked sea salt.  I turned them as they cooked and I liked the appealing charred look they took on, while still maintaining their crisp/tender texture.   I don't care for Parmesan on asparagus myself, so I didn't taste this - but judging by Mrs. Spunky's dinner plate this must have been pretty good.

This recipe is similar to how I always make my roasted asparagus.  I always wait to add the parmesan cheese at the end when they are done along with some more lemon juice drizzled over!  Also while roasting or grilling, add in some chopped garlic, yumm.

I had never made grilled asparagus. I made this recipe exactly as written.  Grilling asparagus gives it a different taste.  We enjoyed it very much, but I  felt that something was missing. Next time I  will put some garlic on it being careful not to burn it and making it bitter. Thanks for the recipe.

DE-LIC-I-OUS!  So simple and so tasty.  I used bottled lemon juice, but look forward to using fresh lemon juice next time.  I'm already planning next week's menu around having this as a side at LEAST once.  THANKS, for the recipe!

This is a really good asparagus recipe, and it didn't take too long to make, either.  It is very tangy and delicious.  I think we would definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I prepared this recipe for the first time this weekend...for a reception serving a light dinner (for 40-50 guests with sophisticated pallets) following a concert.  It was also the first time I had used the wonderfully helpful servings converter you provide. I followed the suggestion of a reviewer to marinate the asparagus before roasting. For almost 10# of asparagus, I divided the asparagus into four batches for marinating (an hour) and roasting (about 12 min.) Having roasted asparagus and other veggies previously in my oven, I had an idea about the time needed for achieving a crisp/tender outcome.  I salted generously, added generous amounts of garlic to the marinade and added the shredded parmesan after roasting. Along with the last batch of aspragus I roasted a thinly sliced lemon which I added on top on of the serving platter.  The dish was a hit...not a single stalk of asparagus was left to bring home!  Thank you, Allrecipes, for helping me look good!!-

Very quick and simple, yet delicious! I cannot wait to make this again. 

I love Parmesan cheese, so I grated extra and added it to the top a couple minutes before it was done. Amazing!!!

Quick and easy side dish.  No need to measure ingredients.  Just drizzle oil, squirt lemon, season with salt and pepper, grate cheese, toss and grill.  It is that easy.
