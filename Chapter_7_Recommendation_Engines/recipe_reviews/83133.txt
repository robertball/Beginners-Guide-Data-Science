I made this for company on Sunday.  I roasted a regular boneless loin of pork and just inserted slivers of garlic in it and seasoned it with Goya seasoning.  Then I made the (which was sooo easy - prepared it in advance and just reheated it).  I served the roast with a vegetable and both mashed potatoes and rice.  I made regular gravy from the roast.  So those who wanted the traditional roast pork with applesauce on the side and mashed potatoes and gravy were happy - and those that wanted to be adventuresome were happy.  And some had both!  It was a success.  The sauce was really tasty - I found it a bit too sugary so I added some more chinese chili garlic sauce - next time I will just cut back a little on the sugar.  Thank you submitter.

Quick and easy. I rubbed the tenderloin with black pepper first to give it a bit of extra spice and then pan fried it quickly on all sides to seal in the juices. The sauce is great, just gave it a bit more key lime juice to tang it up a little.

My family and friends LOVED this dish! The sauce was incredible, but not quite as thin as the picture displays. It was actually pretty thick. Delicious none the less!

We were not very impressed.  The color of the sauce was also off putting.
