I made this, using everything but the tarragon, because I didn't have any and, I baked it in the oven instead of grilling...it was fantastic and my hubby loved it!  I made a second time, except I dumped chops and marinade in the crock pot, let cook for 8 hours...the marinade made a yummy gravy which we served over rice, with green beans and cornbread muffins...outstanding!

I thought this was GREAT! I made a few small changes though.  I used 4 chops that were about 3/4 inch. I doubled the marinade and marinated overnight in a glass pan.  When ready to cook I removed the chops and dipped them in a flour/salt/pepper mix.  Then pan fried them in a little olive oil with a sliced up onion.  When the chops were brown I put them w/onions back in the glass pan with the marinade and baked covered @ 350 degrees for about 45 minutes.  Moist and Delicious!!!  I served with noodles, applesauce and red cabbage.

Very good, yet not fantastic.  I didn't have any onion powder so I left it out and marinated almost 2 hours.  Next time I will try for overnight for more flavor.

So easy!  I only marinated the chops (which were not thin) for 2 hours and they were delicious! This one's a keeper.

Tonight will be the second time I have used this recipe.  I used boneless country-style ribs, which are thicker, and excellent!  To the marinade I added more prepared mustard, liquid smoke, and Cholula brand Mexican hot sauce (flavorful, but not too hot).  Perfect!  I then used the marinade as a swab.  My daughter's whole family loved these ribs.

Very good marinade; a definite keeper.  I didn't measure exactly and I only let it sit for about 2 hours, but it was juicy and the scent of the chops on the Q was heavenly!

Great flavor!I let it marinate for 2 days! Also, I did not have any white wine open. I used a teaspoon of cranberry juice instead.

I had thin cut pork chops and baked them with the marinade after letting them sit for 1 1/2 hours.  The flavor was good--something my husband AND children liked.

Tastes like the seaoning on honey mustard and onion pretzels.  Marinade overnight and do not overcook chops!

I didn't have time to marinate the pork chops, so I just browned them well in a little oil and then poured the "marinade" mixture over and simmered on low. It made a wonderful sauce and the pork chops were delicious!  Family raved.

So many people are raving about this recipe, I guess my family must have very different tastes.  I did this recipe in the crock pot as one reviewer suggested. We did not care for it. I ended up rinsing the pork chops off real well, then chopping them and putting them into a Chop Suey dish so the meat was not wasted.  Will certainly not fix this again.

In my house, we like strong, flavorful dishes and this fit the bill! I have already made it twice...both times I did not have tarragon or onion powder (keep forgetting to buy them at the grocery store) so I used 1 tsp of garlic powder instead. I marinated the chops in a ziploc bag in the fridge for approximately 9 hours while I was at work. The edges of the chops got crispy on the grill but were still completely edible and actually ended up being the most tasty parts. ALL AROUND YUMMY! Definitely making it again but I think I will try the slow cooker (per another reviewer) since that would be good while I'm at work, with less to do when we get home!

These were pretty good. During the winter we put these in the crock pot on low for about 8hrs. They aren't our favorite, but are a nice change every one in a while. My husband isn't real big on sweet pork recipes so we don't have it often, but he does like this with boneless chops shredded into pasta.

Taste is great! I'd like to try this on chicken. I'd probably marinate overnight to get an even stronger flavor next time.

The whole family enjoyed these.  I didn't have time to marinade them at all.  I cooked them in a skillet on the stovetop and basted the chops with the marinade a few times, then let them carmelize.  It didn't matter, they still tasted great!  Next time may increase the honey to thicken it a little.

This was quick and easy and tasty for supper.  I would consider marinating for a day or longer next time though for just a bit more flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great full flavor recipe.  I also didn't have the proper time for marinating and used thick cut pork chops.  Took the advice from another and just basted over & over again until they were done.  Blacken them also tastes awsome.  My 6 yr old even couldn't get enough.

This recipe was great!  Instead of grilling, I baked them in the oven in a non-stick pan for 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.  Turned out nice and juicy, with the great flavor of the marinade throughout!  The truth is, I will probably double the recipe and put on the same amount of pork.  It was delicious!

I made this tonight because I had some pork chops and I wanted a good sauce. I made the marinade without the wine and instead of tarragon I used Rosemary. I marinated for 2 hours, and instead of discarding it, I reduced it to a thick sauce. It was amazing! Whole family loved it. Even my 3 year old. I will be making this again. By reducing the marinade it made this thick, sweet sauce and the Rosemary was so fragrant in it.

These pork chops had GREAT flavor.  They definately need to be thin cut though.  I used thick cut pork chops and the flavor did not seem to go all the way through.  The next time I will use thin cut, but otherwise...FANTASTIC

I made these tonight and enjoyed them.  I like an intense honey mustard flavor so I reduced the marinade down and used it for dipping.  I'd also marinate longer next time.  Good flavors working together.

Both my husband and I really liked this recipe--but we baked the chops like another reviewer did.  I made just a few changes.

1)  Salted/peppered/floured the chops, and browned them (along with 1/3 of a sliced yellow onion) in extra virgin olive oil.

2)  Put onions and browned chops in a greased casserole dish.

3)  Doubled the sauce recipe (deglazed the skillet with some of the sauce)then covered chops and onions with the mustard sauce

4)  Covered and baked at 350 for 1 hour (used thick chops)

This came out just great--chops were moist, tender, and sauce is really yummy.  Thanks for this recipe!

This was a very good recipe.  My husband didn't think it tasted very 'honey mustard.'  Next time, I'll marinate the chops longer - I only did it for 2 hours.

I marinated the chops for 6 hours, and they were tasty, but next time I'll marinate them longer to get more flavor.  I cooked them on an indoor grill and they burnt a bit because of the honey, so keep an eye on them.  But even with the edges blackened, they were still flavorful, so the recipe is a keeper.

Great recipe!   In place of fresh tarragon I used tarragon dijon, which worked fine.  Other than that, I doubled the wine and slow baked the chops (rather than grill).  A really nice combination of flavors.  SO delicious!

Delicious!  I marinated them for about 5 hours, and they were just right.  I skipped the taragon, because I didn't have any.  Still good!

I wasn't too fond of theses.  I marinated the chops overnight, and I thought they still didn't have that much flavor.  What little flavor they did have was good, though.  Thanks anyway.

Yum! Yum!! Yum!!!  I don't really care for pork chops, but I loved these!!  I will definately make these again very soon!
I reserved a little of the marinade to brush on the chops when I flipped them.

One of the best, most flavorful marinades we've had.  Marinated about 20 hours then grilled about five minutes on each side.  Turned out great!

We didn't have alot of time to marinade, so we baseted while grilling. I only had four chops, but used the entire sauce for 8! Was quick and delicious. Try with Terriyaki noodles and sweet corn!

There's a first time for everything.  This is first receipe I've used from this site that we didn't care for at all.  Only marinated for 1 1/2 hours instead of 2 but can't imagine that would make that much difference.  Definitely won't do again - but there's tons of others I've still yet to try.

The pork was nice and tender, but I was extremely disappointed with the lack of flavor. Sure, I omitted the tarragon, but I can't imagine it would have made much of a difference. I think I'll just stick with my very basic but very delicious Coleman's English mustard and brown sugar marinade. Thanks anyway.

This marinade gave a lovely flavour to the pork chops. I only had small chops so just marinated them for a couple of hours. Worked great on the BBQ.

I used a whole grain dijon mustard and I liked the texture and appearance. I let the chops marinade for about 10 hours. I'll let them go overnight next time. I made these on a cold and windy day, so I put them in the broiler, turned them once for a total cook time of about 15 minutes or until the meat was not pink. My family thought this one was a definite WOW!

Personally, I'd leave out the orange juice and add a little more mustard, but that's personal preference talking.  The meat was extremely tender and overall very tasty.  I'll definately make it again.

Very juicy and easy.  The flavor takes a very long time to develop in the marinade.  The honey does get deceptively browner than usual, so use a thermometer to get your meat done right.

I used this recipe to marinated thick boneless pork chops.  Add 2 tsp. of olive oil into marinade and sauted the chops in a preheated pan on the stovetop.  Excellent!  The leftover sauce was good on rice.

This was pretty good.  Marinated chops for about 2 hours then grilled them on the gas grill.  Lots of honey mustard flavor.  Not sure I still don't prefer chops grilled with just a little garlic powder but husband who likes honey mustard flavor better than I do really liked it.  Will make again but not often.

Dish was OK. The honey and mustard combined for an overly sweet taste. Wasn't great, wasn't terrible. It's worth a try if you like these ingredients.

These were a waste of good pork chops.  I marinated them all day and they were dry and tasteless.  Definitely not making these again.

This was an easy recipe and went over well at the dinner party I served them at.  It was a great change from beef or chicken.  It also helped that I could put them in the marinade in the morning and be done with the meat portion of the meal.

It's very hard to find really good pork chop recipes, this has to be one of the best I've ever had. It was so easy to make, I left them marinating all day and then put them on the grill when we were ready to eat.  We loved them.

YUMMY!  I changed a bit ... but the flavor of the pork chops was great. Plus husband grills when he gets home from work.  What a plan:)

Glaze is great with chicken as well.  Add some extra onion powder and/or Old Bay seasoning for a little kick.

I actually made this marinade with chicken leg quarters.  They had a great flavor, but burned easily on the grill because of the honey in the marinade.  I will made it again, but with a different cut of meat, either boneless breasts or the pork chops recommeded in the recipe -- but GREAT flavor.

This recipe was awesome.  It was fairly easy to make (although I had to get my sister to buy me the white wine because I'm only 20).  My sister and boyfriend loved it and even my dad who doesn't like new things thought it was good. They were definately the juiciest pork chops I've ever made.  Yummy!

Oh my delicious! I baked it instead as well. Instead of using the onion powder. I cut up half an onion and also used half a small fresh garlic and marinated it with the other ingredients. I baked the pork chop with the marinade. Once I uncovered the pan it dried out a little and browned nicely.
