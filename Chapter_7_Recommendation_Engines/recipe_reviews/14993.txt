Awesome pie! I love apple pies and this was no exception. I used 8 granny smith apples sliced thin, tossed in the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, a few splahes of lemon juice, left out the almonds and almond extract and opted for a couple tsp. of vanilla instead. I also left out the butter and tossed in 1/4 cup of cornstarch vs. flour to thicken up the juices. I used "Baker's Secret Pie Crust" from this site which is phenomenal! I baked this the night before (1 hour and 15 min.) to let the pie set before cutting into it - I must admit temptation almost got the better of me but I didn't want to ruin it.  When we did finally cut it open boy was it incredible - the apple slices were piled nice and high, it thicken up beautifully and it went perfect with vanilla ice cream and a dollup of whipped cream - hey you have to indulge once in a while!

I made this with a frozen pie crust..Mrs. Smith's deep dish frozen pie crust..They come as 2 frozen shells...you take one out of the pie pan and let it thaw for about 20 minutes, then use it as your top crust.  Then I cooked the pie in the other frozen shell and pie pan.  The crust is unbelievable!  Now, lets talk about this recipe.  I was interested in this particular recipe becasue it specifically called for macintosh apples and thats what I had on hand. Ive never made a pie with macs before. I usually use granny smith.  Anywho, Let me give you some advice.  Cook this pie the day before your going to slice into it.  I cooked it and sliced into it about 4 hours after I took it out of the oven and I was left with a soupy mess on my hands.  I blamed the macintosh apples thinking there was too much moisture in the apples.  I was very upset.  BUT......THE NEXT DAY!.......I went to go look at my soupy mess and it was completey "SET".....Now, Im not a big apple pie maker, but I thought beginners should know to let the pie completely cool and set before digging into it.  Thats why Im giving it 5 stars.  It was delish!  Sweeter than the granny smith I usually use. Great with icecream! I also didnt use the extract...I dont think I'd like it in an apple pie.

I learned from experience and from old timers that you don't use soft/sweet apples for pies. They make the pie very runny. Use firm/tart apples such as granny smiths and you won't have a runny pie.Slice it somewhat thin so it will cook thoroughly. Sometimes, I will add one semi-firm such as red delicious, ida red or any other semi-firm apple. Using granny smiths,you will find that is the reason for this amount of sugar in the recipe. Ever since I found this out, it has made me bake apple pies a whole lot more often.

As the recipe calls for, I would rate no more then a ***.  After letting the pie stand for about 3 hours, I sliced it, and had nothing but a soupy soupy soupy mess with not enough flavor for my taste.  I managed to salvage the pie by carefully lifting the top crust and adding about 1/3 cup of flour to the mixture, and then returning it to the oven to bake for another 25 minutes.  I also added more cinnamon and nutmeg.  This enhanced the overall taste and added more much needed flavor.  After letting this cool, the second time it turned out great.  I will make this recipe again, but next time I will definately add atleast 1/4 cup more flour and probably double the seasoning, just out of personal preference.

This pie was delicious.  I added 1/2 cup more flour to the apple mixture so that they wouldn't be too soggy.  This was a success that I will definitely make again.

Very good recipe.  I especially liked the macintosh apples because they are not too tart like granny smith apples.  I also added 1/2 cup of butter to the apple mixture.  I do agree with other reviewers where as the pie is somewhat runny initially. However, once it sits for a while, it is fine.

Very very runny. Also it was a tad too sweet for my tastes. I like the filling to be sweet, but slightly tart, and this filling was just plain sweet. So next time, I'd add more flour, minus some of the brown sugar and add a couple teaspoons of lemon juice.

I was in a hurry to make a homemade pie for a party and wanted a interesting yet classic recipe. This pie was full of flavor with just the right complement of spices and sweetness. I used crisp Fuji apples because that's all I had available and the consistency was great. I included almond extract but not the nuts.  Even my father - who is normally not a big fan of apple pie - asked for seconds. I used the Marie Calendar frozen shells for top and bottom, it was tasty, fast and easy... to my suprise even got compliments on the crust. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

By FAR, the best apple pie I've ever made/consumed. The deep dish ingredients are enough for two regular pie crusts. I used Fuji apples and they held up well and were very sweet. I also made a simple crust for my pies instead of store bought. The apple pies were devoured quickly and the two pumpkin pies that accompanied them were hardly touched! 'Nuf said!

I actually took this recipe and added it to another. I increased the granulated sugar to 1 cup and used granny smith apples instead (10 cups). I then added 4 tablespoons of corn starch along with the flour. I added much more cinnamon, more like 2 tbs. I increased the salt to 1/2 tsp. and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. The pie took longer to bake but it came out so nice and thick, not runny, and everyone said it was the best apple pie ever.

After several tries at apple pie making...this is the recipe I will stick with.  My husband was very happy!
I followed the recipe except I used Granny Smith apples. Not soupy at all.  It was set in about 5 mins. It really hit the spot.  Finally a pie I won't be throwing away!!

I made this pie for New Years Eve dessert and I never saw a pie get eaten so fast. My boyfriend & dad (who are both very picky)said this had to be the best apple pie I had ever made, and my boyfriend thought it was the best he ever tasted. 

The only thing I changed was the baking time, I only baked it at 375 for about 30-40min like the recipe said I baked it until it bubbles and was tender, it came out perfffffeeect

I wasn't wowed by this pie, and I didn't get any compliments from the people I made it for, so I'll try another recipe next time.  Too much almond flavor (I would omit the extract and only add the almonds, they add nice texture) and I like something a little richer.  Not bad, but just okay.

this is a very tasty apple pie recipe.  it was a little runny until it had time to set up but overall my family really liked the flavor.  pair this filling recipe with the french pastry pie crust and this pie will not stay around for very long.

Just wanted to note that our vermont apple pie always included vermont maple syrup thus the reason it was called vermont apple pie. I love macs, we used to use a mix of cortlands, macouns, grannys and macs.

I love the sweet/tanginess of the apples and the flavor of the almonds. This was delicious. I didn't slice the apples thin, I just used an apple cutter (to make wedges) and cut the pieces in half. I also halved the recipe to use in a regular-size pie tin (But not all the apples fit, seems like 3 apples would have been perfect for that tin). I also used Pie Crust IV from this site (w/ butter, not shortening). I'll definitely make this again.

The taste of this pie is fantastic, but I, too, had trouble with runniness(is that a word?) Perhaps more flour or tapioca, or less apples, I don't know. I would absolutely recommend trying it anyway.

Adding almonds and almond extract got good comments. Otherwise, this would be a pretty standard apple pie. Used a couple less apples than called for, but would be a tall pie otherwise.

My husband is very picky about his pies.  I misplaced the apple pie recipe that I usually use this past Thanksgiving and at the last minute looked up this one.  It was incredible!  He told me to get rid of the old recipe and keep this one forever.  I used Granny Smith apples because they are what I had on hand and I increased the almond extract to 1 teaspoon. (Almond extract reminds me of my grandmother's house so I usually increase the amount whenever possible!)

Thanks for the great recipe.

Now this is apple pie! Deliciously sticky and sweet, the filling was outstanding! I even forgot to put the butter on top (didn't realize my mistake until the crust was sealed), but it was fantastic. Served it to three friends for dessert one night, and we finished it all in one sitting. 
Thanks, Pame!

This was a great Apple Pie.  I reccomend tasting the apple before baking it.  If it is a tougher apple, the pie will need to cook longer.  I put butter on top, before the top crust went on to add more flavor.  This is the  best apple pie !!!!

I made this pie the day after Apple picking. I was concerned that I should've used Granny Smith apples, but the fresh, firm, Macintosh apples that we picked were absolutely delicious in this pie! I did add lemon juice to the Apple filling before baking, and I also used one beaten whole egg for an egg wash for the top of the pie. Other than those two changes, I followed the recipe entirely. I let the pie sit for four hours. There was some liquid in the bottom (maybe 1/8 cup) but I just drained it from the pie an hour before serving. This pie was phenomenal!! I will definitely be making this again!

This is the best!  The wife doesn't even like apple pie but she likes this one.  HOWEVER, after making this several times, I add a tablespoon or two of corn starch to the apples to help with the runniness.

This was a *fantastic* apple pie the way it came out. However, it ended up being very different from the recipe. I decided to do it because I had 5 large Granny Smith apples that I wanted to use ASAP. I suspected that 5 large apples were equivalent to the 8 the recipe calls for. I sliced them and mixed them with the rest of the ingredients, and after I put the filling into the deep dish crust I still had more than half of the filling! I ran to the store and got another double crust, assembled a 2nd pie and still had a little bit left. I wish the recipe had stated (in cups) the amt. of apples needed. The pie came out *amazing* and I believe that if I had only put enough apples for 1 pie it would have been way too sweet. All in all, the way it came out was probably the best apple pie I have ever had. The almonds were a great touch. For the 1st pie I used the "Best Ever Pie Crust" recipe from this site, which was really yummy. Thanks!!!!

I made this and my husband and mother-in-law said it was the best apple pie they have ever had! I am not a fan of apple pie but this is obviously a VERY good recipe.

Now that I've made this pie for family, everyone requests it. I've made it with the almond extract, and not the sliced almonds. Perhaps next time I'll add them, and see if this is really a 6 star recipe. Thank you for sharing it!

Of all the apple pie recipes I've tried, this one was not my favourite. I followed the recipe except for the addition of the optional almonds and made it a day ahead for dessert on Christmas Day. It was on the runny side and very sweet. At the time, I thought it sounded like a lot of butter in the filling, and at first I hesitated to put it on a baking sheet. I should have gone with my gut and put it right on the rack especially after taking into account the reviews about soupiness, because the bottom crust still looked pale after baking for 1 hour and 15 minutes. My family seemed to enjoy it and liked the spiciness. I also went with a butter pie crust instead of my usual shortening and I wasn't thrilled with the crust, so that may have dampened my opinion overall. I will try it again with less butter and sugar, no baking sheet, maybe a higher temperature for the first 15 minutes, and my tried and true pastry and see how it goes.

I made the mistake and used Macintosh which made it very runny.  Also would only use 7 apples based on the size and I will add another 1/4 cup of flour.  Otherwise it turned out great.

This pie is super easy to make and so yummy.  I didn't have Macintosh apples so I substituted 6 Granny Smith apples.  This was my first time baking a pie and it was delicious.  You can't fail with this recipe. Love it!  UPDATE: I've already made it 3 times and all 3 pies were delicious!

I switched the apple choice to Granny Smith, left out the nutmeg and increased the cinnamon, cooked in a coconut pie shell so I wouldn't have to protect the pie crust top from the heat - coconut oil has a higher flash point - turned out perfect. Then I only cooked it for 40 minutes.  Any longer and the apples will be mushy.  55 minutes for any apple is WAY too LONG! :) Enjoy!

I baked it for 55 minutes at 375 just like it said, I let it sit for several hours and i cut into it and it was an apple juice pie lol but I didn't care! I put it in the microwave since i wanted to eat it warm.... and the juice thickened.  So the light bulb went on.  I made a tinfoil TP and put the pie back in the oven even with the piece missing.  Baked it at 400 in 15 minute increments.  I ended up baking it for 45 more minutes.  My pan is the paula deen pan though.  it's 11.5 inches.  Then it set up very well.

I love this pie! The only things I changed were reducing the sugar by 1/4 cup and I mix granny smith and red apples.  I had no problems with it setting up and my family loves it too!

Maybe a little too sweet held together real well. Next time I try it I will use 9 or 10 apples.

I am not a apple pie fan, but this pie was extremely good.  My dinner party all said it was the best pie they had ever tasted.  The conversation died and they all quietly enjoyed the delicous mouthwatering pie.
