I was looking for a cream based stroganoff recipe for chicken and I stumbled upon this recipe. I wasn't too crazy about the tomato soup so I used cream of mushroom instead and I added a 16 oz. container of sour cream. I served it over egg noodles and it was a hit! The onion soup made it taste a bit like onion soup dip and it makes your guests wonder what that delicious secret ingredient is. This modified version is going into my rotation!

This is an excellent alternative to beef stroganoff if you don't eat beef. The tomatoe soup and the sour cream are a difficult mix to master even in the beef recipe. The mixture can't be too hot when you add the sour cream otherwise it causes the fat and the cream to seperate. If you take the pan off the burner and allow it to cool and then add the sour cream immediately before serving, it is well worth the trouble!!

This dish is fairly tasty and definetly easy to make but wasn't the best I've ever made. It was average. I might try it with some bacon next time.

I may have made it wrong but my sauce turned out a salmon pink color.   It would be great for someone who really likes tomato flavor but I think it had too much tomato in it.   It just wasn't for me.  My husband liked it though.

The tomato soup/sour cream mixture did not work well.

This recipe was not for me, it turned out bright pink just did not care for the sour cream and tomatoe mixture flavor. Think it might have been good if I would of used a can of cream of mushroom instead of tomatoe.

This was really good and was a hit with the family, only thing I changed was I used 2 10 oz cans of the tomato soup insted of the 26 oz can. Next time I make it Im going to put in more mushrooms.

Even my kids loved this.  I did follow the recommendations from other raters and added worcestershire sauce, more mushrooms and used 2 regular cans of tomato soup.  It was very tasty.

This recipe is very good as it is. I added more mushrooms because I like them a lot. Other than that, this is very good.

I thought this was a nice quick dish.  I substituted about half a can of chicken broth for the tomato soup just to thin out the sour cream a bit.  I also added about 1 tsp of Wortesire sauce and about 1 tsp of parsley to the sauce because pouring it on the chicken.  Really nice and tasted great!

I read reviews and made changes- substituted cream cheese for sour cream, fresh chopped garlic for powdered garlic, olive oil for vegetable oil.  I added 3T of Worcestershire sauce.  Very delicious-pure comfort food!

Scaled the recipe back to serve two.  My husband enjoyed this recipe very much.  I liked it rather well, too, but thought the tang of the tomato soup was a bit much.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and tossed in a few grape tomatoes, simply because I had them on hand.  I would make this again but will go lighter on the tomato soup.

I thought initially that the recipe was basic so I changed it a little bit. I added spinach to the chicken, (10 oz. frozen chopped spinach). I added Mexican cheese, (handful), and 1 cup spaghetti sauce into the soup mix so it didn't taste like fry sauce. I used basil and garlic penne from pappardelle's pasta and whole wheat penne instead of egg noodles. Of course I added much more pepper. This made all the difference. The recipe was definitely a good base. Thanks!
