I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, used 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract instead of vanilla, and tinted 1/2 the batter green and 1/2 pink. The batter was very grainy before I put them in the oven all night, but they were perfect when done. Good recipe!

These are like candy.  A little too sweet, but the consistency came out perfect.  Takes too much time to add the sugar by teaspoonful.  Recommend you have a helper to spoon teaspoons of sugar in as you are beating it.

These are great!  This is the best meringue kiss recipe I have ever used.  I changed it up a bit and instead of the vanilla I used mint extract and they came out great.  :o)

Taste exactly like the ones my Nana used to make when I was little. I couldn't beleive how easy this recipe was. And they came out perfect the next morning. Really hard not to peek at them though.

Mine didn't turn out the best. I felt like I had to mix them FOREVER, and then they completely flattened out. They taste pretty good, but are completely flat, crumbly, and grainy.

Even though they were pretty sugary, they were still so good (and didn't last long at all!).  I left out the chocolate chips and substituted peppermint extract for the vanilla, and they came out fine (no marshmellow middle).  This was the first meringue recipe I used that the cookies actually turned out right!

Rosemarie!  These are WONDERFUL!  Sooo light & airy!  Almost too sweet with the chocolate chips though.  They are great.  I've been searching for a very unique cookie to make for a church cookie exchange in two days.... I've found a winner with this one.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  .....Cristi White - Phoenix, AZ

I didn't have any chocolate chips on hand, they all went into cookie recipes, but I did have 2 cups of walnuts left, so I used this recipe but changed it a little and they turned out like confectionery heaven.  Instead of using white sugar I used brown, and only used a scant cup, and instead of all vanilla, I used 3/4 tsp of vanilla extract and about 1/2 tsp of Almond extract, and i folded in about 2 cups of walnuts chopped small.  I always used a gallon size plastic bag to pipe everything, and it worked great to make real "kisses".   I just cut the point end off of one side and load the thing and pipe away.  Excellent recipe, and easily adaptable to different varieties of flavors. I also used parchment paper on the cookie sheets and sprayed them with a little veg oil spray, then wiped all excess off with a paper town.  worked great.

I really liked these cookies.  I am going to make the for the church cookie sale.  Next time I make them I am going to try using mini chocolate chips.  Especially for the larger type cookies.

I don't know what I did wrong. My name came out as one big flat red thing (very thin) with clumps of chocolate chips where the cookies should be. I sprayed the pans and I can not get it off. I tasted the crumbs and they taste good. I did not open the door either.

Made them last night - a great addition to my Christmas cookies!  Next time I might tint half green, too.  Nice and light.

Love how easy this recipe is! Great for Easter as the food coloring gives a perfect pastel spring time color! I don't add the chocolate chips as I like the plain meringue kisses.

Absolutely brilliant! I made these with about 2 drops of Peppermint extract and 4 drops of green food colouring. Also, I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. Wonderful, crunchy, powdery goodness! :D

I found a recipe like this before Christmas 2012 and have made several batches since then, didn't think about food color, that would be pretty. I don't use that much sugar, I use 2 egg whites and 2/3(two thirds) cup of sugar, and about 3/4 cups pecans, yummyyy stuff! But I will have to use food color even tho it can't make them any better..:)

I've tried other meringue recipes besides this and found this one to be the most grainy.  While the taste was ok, the texture left a lot to be desired.  I wouldn't use this recipe again!
