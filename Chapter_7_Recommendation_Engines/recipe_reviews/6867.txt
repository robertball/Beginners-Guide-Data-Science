I follow recipes EXACTLY as written.  Unfortunately this one didn't say to oil the pans.  It also didn't say to let the dough rise a second time before placing in the oven, which I didn't. Mine came out over cooked (just about burned, and I cooked it at a lower temp and shorter time).  This brick-hard loaf will go to the dogs.  If the recipe was a little more detailed, it might be worth the effort.

Light and moist.  

Rises well.  Be careful not to spread too much of the egg whites in step 2.  (Crust became very hard)

Tried it w/o seed; substitute Walnuts and Anise Extract.

I ended up changing a lot about this recipe, and it still didn't taste that great.  I used 4 cups wheat and 2 cups white flour, and cut the amount of anise seed to 2 tablespoons from 1/4 cup, as it's an expensive and strong spice.  It still was too much anise and overpowers the taste of the wheat. Don't try this recipe, it's a waste of flour!

It just came out from the oven perfectly fine!!!!   Here are the changes that I've made:  ->I halve the recipe(which doesn't really matter), I left out the anise, AND I started off with proofing the yeast using the first 1/4cup water(lukewarm) together with 1/4teaspoon of the 1/4cup sugar for 5-10 minutes. Then added this yeast mixture into the remaining 1cup water. STIRRED WELL. Then added the flour mixture (flour, b.s, b.p, sugar, AND a pinch of salt) into the yeast mixture a little at a time, stirring, until just the right consistency for kneading (till the dough doesn't stick to your fingers). Kneaded for 15 minutes (using hand), and let it rise for 1st time about an hour (or doubled in size) and lightly punched down, reshaped a little, and rise 2nd time for 45-60 min (or doubled in size). It only took 30minutes to bake in a 400F oven.   By the way, I think the baking soda gives it a slight odd flavor.

In my searches for a simple, 100% whole wheat bread, this recipe fit the bill.  I left out the anise for a plain, hearty bread that makes great toast.  Do let it rise a second time before baking, though.

I didn't check the reviews before I made this and therefore did exactly what the recipe called for, until I realized that it did not say to let it raise a second time in the pan.  I quickly checked the reviews and said, oops, maybe I should have read these before I started.  It seems that the only way this bread is good is if you change the entire recipe.  There are a lot of low fat wheat bread recipes out there that you don't need to be a chef to figure out how to make it tast good. I will not be making this again.

Taking the other reviews into account, I allowed the bread to rise a second time and it only cooked 30 minutes on 375. The second loaf was done in a round pan and turned out better. I thought it would rise a little more but it tastes good and I can use it for sandwiches. I used oats instead of anise seed, and my 18 mos. old son likes it. Check out my picture I submitted. Thanks! Have a great day!

From now on I will read the reviews.  This recipie is almost worthless.  The dough is hard to work with,and I would change the recipe to halve the yeast and anise, and drop the cooking temp to 350 after 10 minutes, and take the loaves out after 30 minutes.  I'm not sure how the ratings given add up to the 4 stars I see displayed beside this recipe.

I read several reviews and knew to grease the pans and knead the bread and allow to rise at least twice.  I appreciate a whole wheat recipe that didn't use 50%-75% regular flour...100% whole wheat!!!  I cooked at 400 for 50min but all my other bread recipes use 350...so next time I'll stick with 350.  My bread came out too toasty...thick crust.  However, the bread inside was delicious!!!  I added an egg per loaf for the mix and skipped the addition of seeds or nuts.  After my next ettempt @350 degrees, I'll try adding nuts, seeds or raisins and have more fun with those.
