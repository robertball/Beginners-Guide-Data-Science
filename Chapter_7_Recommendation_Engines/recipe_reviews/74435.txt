Too much breadcrumb, or not enough tomato - I'm not sure which.  This recipe is good but it would be much better with about half the breadcrumb.  It is dry as is...

Great Recipe for a dip for parties and for using up all that basil I grew this summer! It is about the consistency of hummus so you might be able to add some chick peas in place of some of the bread crumbs.

This is very edible, but as I have many times made a "Rouille" (pronounced the same), I find that this version fades in comparison.

very good on crackers.  I didn't add the Jalepeno (didn't have one) and instead added crushed red pepper.  My husband loved it!

Excellent fresh flavor!  I pulsed the ingredients in the food processor and spread it on toasted french bread.

I used this as a topping to baguette slices, which I then broiled. As per other suggestions, I cut back on the bread crumbs. Next time, I will cut back on the garlic a bit too; it was a bit overpowering.

It should be spelled "rouille" - though it's still pronounced "roo-EE."

Love this recipe!  I use panko Japanese bread crumbs instead of regular - gives it a lighter texture.  I also use less crumbs than the recipe calls for.  I make extra and freeze several batches in small tupperware containers. Freezes pretty well.

As written this recipe is WAY off.  It calls for way too much bread crumbs.  The flavor was good but I ended up adding a lot more oil.  Even then it was not going to come together.  A little investigating and we found this recipe on several other international AR sites.  Indeed those recipes call for about half the amount of bread crumbs.  I couldn't serve this and will ultimately end up using it as a breading for pork or chicken.

I did half the bread crumbs as suggested but I also added a cup of cottage cheese .. I might do it next time with only cheese no bread crumbs. I also used instead of tomato, a ready can of petit dice tomato & green chili; of course omitted the jalape√±os at that point!
