I was pleasantly surprised by this pie. It turned out very well, much better than expected. I might add a little more cornstartch next time because it was a little runny but had a great flavor! I will be making this again.

Absolutely wonderful!  I didn't have orange liqueur so I used orange juice instead of water and then added rum instead of orange liqueur.  Just like a strawberry dacquari in pie form.  This will be made again and again.  Such a nice change from those pies that use gelatin for the glaze.

very nice!.  Whipped cream required (the real stuff, not the fake stuff in the freezer). I enjoyed it so much that later I reduced the amounts and substituted raspberries to make a filling for the Italian Wedding cake recipe on this site. It was fabulous!

I made this pie and did use the Grand Marnier....It was a little too much for me, I thought it took over the tatste of the pie.
