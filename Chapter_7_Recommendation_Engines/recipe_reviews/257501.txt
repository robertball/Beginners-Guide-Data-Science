Easy and very tasty.  I used vegetable buillon and forgot to cut the salt, so it was a little saltier than I would have liked.

Really enjoyed this lentils stew!  The lime add a very nice subtle flavour.  I followed someone's advice from another review and cut down the spices by almost half, so instead of 2 Tbsp, I used 1 heaping Tbsp, and instead of 2 tsp, I used 1 heaping tsp...you get the idea!

I made the dish as per the recipe. While making it I wondered if  what was called for would be too much. Spice/seasonings calls for tablespoons, which seemed alot. I like spice so made it as stated. While it was tasty the flavours were too 'intense' for me so next time I make it I will cut back spices by 1/3 and see how that works. I will play with it until I find what suits me. Lots of ways to serve it too.  It is an attractive dish.

I liked it. I was a little worried, as the smell of cinnamon was overpowering during cooking, but the taste is fine. A little salty, and a little bitter, but I blame it on my beef broth and my old spices. If your broth is salty, I would omit the kosher salt and add more towards the end, if necessary.

I have made this for my Persian husband several times, and he loves it! The one thing I do is cut the red pepper since we both have a hard time with any hot spice.
