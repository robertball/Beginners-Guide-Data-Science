Yummy! By far my favorite chard recipe. Followed the recipe but didn't feel the need to add salt or pepper. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious!  I've just discovered swiss chard and am looking for more recipes.  This one is tops!  Oh, I used feta rather than blue....it's just what I had in the house.

I was looking for recipes to help me get some potassium into my diet since I recently deduced that I am severely lacking in that macromineral; lo-and-behold I stumbled across this delicious recipe! 
So yummy and so nutritious! 
I love that it contains the top 2 most potassium-rich foods but I REALLY love how delicious it is! 

I made one change because of personal preference, substituting Gorgonzola for blue cheese because blue cheese gives me the heebie jeebies!

I did not used the blue cheese because I don't like it, but i used the plane old mushrooms that are white that you get from the store, and i used Italian salad dressing, and this turned out really good

I thought this was REALLY good (so did Laura), but David didn't care for it.

This recipe is great for the south beach diet.  I added spiced, toasted pecans and served warm.  The only disappointment I had was that the onions got a little lost.  Otherwise a great recipe.

OK, I made modifications, but it was definitely 5-star!  I used about 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar instead of the balsamic.  Balsamic can be intense and I just didn't want that flavor tonight.  Also, I'm not a bleu cheese fan, so I crumbled the same amount of the chipotle cheddar I had on hand.  It didn't have too much of a vinegar bite with white wine vinegar and the chipotle added some nice heat.  Yum-yum-'lish!

I almost didn't want to rate this, b/c I didn't have blue cheese and had to use parm.  Still, the recipe is solid and I think with blue cheese, it would have had that extra oomph.  Nuts would have been a nice addition, too.

I like the simplicity of this dish.  I also add any other vegetable that may need to be used up.  I've added cauliflower and red kidney beans and I turn it into a main with rice rather than a salad.

This is a good base recipe. My husband does not love warmed tomatoes and I did not have any blue cheese (or feta). I did however add in some bacon and fresh corn - it was fabulous!!

The recipe is very simple, quick and tasty.  I didn't have any blue cheese so substituted Feta and it was great.

OMG! This was so good. Made it with baked lemonTilapia. The lemon from the fish just added a little more flavor to it.        Made just as called no changes. Will make again for sure. Thanks!

we're just starting to try recipes with different types of greens and while my BF was very resistant to the idea he just raved about this from the first bite
