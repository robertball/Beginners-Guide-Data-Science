It is difficult to rate the recipe as it stands as after reading all of the reviews I didn't make these muffins as the recipe suggests. I did soak the raisins and I'm glad I did. I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour to sneak some fiber into the kids diet. To compensate for the nutty flavour of the whole wheat flour, I increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons.  A number of people stated that the muffins were too salty and too oily. Keeping this in mind I referred to my favourite banana muffin recipe which is also based on two cups of flour.  It used only 1/3 cup of fat so I reduced the oil to one third cup and added 2/3 cup of thick homemade (unsweetened) pear sauce. To fix the "too salty" I reduced the baking powder to 1 1/2 teaspoons and the baking soda to 1 teaspoon and the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  The muffins still were nice and high.  In place of 4 eggs I used 2 eggs plus 4 egg whites.  With these changes I made 36 mini muffins which I quite liked. They are a little shy on their own but as part of breakfast with fruit yogurt the sugar was not missed by the kids. Next time I'll sprinkle the tops with brown sugar and cinnamon before baking.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I thought I made a mistake. The second time I realized it was the recipe. Too much salt, oil and baking soda.

I made the recipie with 3/4C applesauce and 1/4C oil - texture was great, taste was great - no oiliness problem like the one gal said and calories went WAY DOWN. I can get"juice" carrots fairly cheaply and use them.

I hate to be soooo critical but this is the worst recipe I have ever tried. All you can taste is vegetable oil!! The oil taste way overpowers the 3 cups of carrots and what little spice is added. Very bland. We won't be making these again

My daughter and me made these yesterday and they are amazing.  Very moist and full of flavor.  We did change the amount of oil, by replacing 3/4 cups of apple sauce 1/4 cup oil and they turned out really well, while taking out a lot of that oil that was requested.  I also put in 2 table spoons of ground flax seeds for more nutrition.

I will be making these again and again

Loved these! So easy to make! Although, I did make a lot of subs (applesauce for oil, less baking soda/powder, whole wheat flour, NO salt) and added more carrots, grated in an apple for extra flavour and added some Benefibre for the extra fibre. Came out awesome and full of flavour. Will make these again and again!

I'm rating this recipe as is.  NOT GOOD.  Too greasy, too much egg.  I think the main reason people gave this a high rating is because of all the changes the reviewers made.  OK people, don't rate a recipe high if you're making so many changes, it throws off the reviews and doesn't give a true rating for the recipe given.

After reading the reviews I made a few changes. I lowered the oil to 2/3 a cup, since a few people felt they were greasy.  They were fine with that amount- still moist, but not greasy.  I also read that they were salty- so, I decreased the salt and baking soda a little bit. I didnt do an exact measure, just used about 1/3 less on both of them. I also added about 1/4 cup of white sugar, because of the reviews that said they werent sweet enough. I did not use frosting on them, as I didnt want cupcakes I wanted muffins!

I have made this recipe twice now, once with raisins and once without.  I also replaced about 3/4 of the oil with applesauce and did not frost them in anyway.  My toddler gobbles these up.  I agree with another reviewer that they are better the next day.  We put them in the freezer and defrost them one at a time for a healthy snack.  They are not the *best* muffins I have ever had - but considering how much my 2 1/2 year old loves them and how healthy they are, I will continue to make them.  Next time, I will try replacing 1/2 the flour with whole wheat flour.

My 5 yr old loves these.  She had one for breakfast this morning.  I used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup oil and also used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  I froze half of the batch for later consumption.

Overall, a good muffin.  I did take everyone's advice, and reduced the salt and baking powder.  I also substituted 1/2 the oil for milk.  I increased the cinnamon, and added nutmeg, but it could still use some more spice (imho).

I really liked the texture of these muffins, but they were too salty. I did not read the other reviews first, but I wish I had. I teach Culinary Arts and was trying to let my students use up some extra carrots and have a healthy snack, but this recipe missed the mark.

I didn't read the reviews before baking these, following the assumption that the overall rating was actually related to the original recipe. Like others, I first thought I'd made a mistake since the muffins tasted salty, oily and like baking soda. Then I read the reviews and see that everyone made some adjustments. I understand that the ratings most people give reflect the outcomes of the  adjustments they made, but this system confuses people like me! I will from now on never trust the overall rating and always read the comments first!

Great recipe!! I made a few moderations that I think gives these muffins a better kick! So instead of just raisins, I used half raisins & half currants. I used 1/2 white & 1/2 whole wheat flour. I know from experience using all whole wheat when baking anything makes it denser & heavier. I cut out the baking soda because it adds to the heaviness and dryness and I wanted a moist muffin, so only baking powder was used. Also to add that extra spice kick, along w/cinnamon i used fresh ground nutmeg AND anise! Fresh ground anise is an unbelievable sweet & perky spice w/ an incredible aroma. Also in the egg mixture, I put 1tsp vanilla essence & 1tsp almond essence. These essences combined create a coconut-like flavor. And instead of veg oil, I used softened (not melted) butter...sorry health buffs (lol). Flour mixture contained the baking powder, sugar, salt & fresh ground spices mixed evenly. The egg mixture has the vanilla & almond essence...NOT the sugar like in this original recipe. I take the soft butter and rub it thru the flour mixture w/ my finger tips until the mixture looks like fine breadcrumbs. Then I stir in the carrots & raisins/currants evenly. Last I add the egg mixture & stir thru slowly. For a little more moisture I added a couple tsps of Carnation milk. Bake as suggested. Serve with a hot cup of brewed Mexican Chiapas Coffee (a medium roast w/cocoa & hazelnut notes..YUM). The muffin tastes like it has Thanksgiving baked into it!! Good Luck!

With a few changes, these muffins are definitely earn 5 stars! I omitted the raisins, used whole wheat flour, used half unsweetened applesauce instead of all oil, left out the salt, doubled the cinnamon, added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon cloves, and added about 1 teaspoon of molasses. Very, very good. I will add this to my rotation for breakfast muffins! The recipe made 18 "regular" muffins and were definitely done in 20 minutes!

Did some alterations based on other suggestions: used 1 1/2 tsp baking soda and baking powder, used 1/2 cup oil, 2 tbsp plain yogurt, 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/4 c honey, 1 tbsp cinnamon, 3 eggs. Baked for 25 mins I think they turned out pretty good! The true test is if my DS likes them..

This recipe looked good once I made it, but it tasted funky because of the high amount of salt, oil, and baking soda.  I should have read the reviews beforehand.  It still has potential for being good--next time I will use the adjustments previous cooks have suggested.

I took the advice from previous comments. Used only 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce. I only used a dash of salt. cut the baking poder down to 1 1/2 tsp and the soda to 1 teaspoon. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. Next time I think I will add shredded apples also. I topped witih a sprinkle of brownsugar and cinnamon before baking also. Super good! My two year old ate them up and even my husband, who hates carrots, gobbled them down. :)

These are great muffins.  I did not alter anything except that I used all whole wheat flour.  (I do this all the time, so my kids are used to a heavier and healthier muffin.)  I think some of the reviews are pretty critical.  They didn't taste too salty or too oily to my family.

System flaw that allows a so-so (at best) recipe to be rated so highly. The high marks had to have been for the substantive changes the raters made to this recipe. Only wish I'd read the comments behind the high rating. Very little flavor. Needlessly oily. Good texture and moisture, but that doesn't count for much when the flavor's not there.

To be honest, I was a bit scared at first because I read the comments AFTER I put the muffins into the oven to bake.  But to be fair to this recipe, I followed it religiously except for one thing: I used 2 cups of shredded carrot instead of 3.  I don't normally bake, so I'm not at all sure how perfect muffins should be like.  I thought the batter was a bit thick, but the muffins turned out perfectly (for me and my 7-yr-old at least).  They rose nicely and filled the house with a really nice aroma.  The only thing I'll change next time is perhaps to leave out the raisins, and that's only because I'm really not a big fan of raisins.

This recipe is not one I would recommend! I don't like raisins so I left those out...but the recipe is very bland, there is no flavor to it what so ever.  Too much baking soda/powder and not enough spices.  Needs more cinnamon or nutmeg or all spice to give it extra flavor. Not a recipe I will be using again.

The changes that I made to this recipe tuned the rating to a five star!  The changes are as follows: 1. substitue whole wheat flour. 2. Leave out salt. 3. Add 1 tsp. nutmeg. 4. Add 1/4 tsp ground cloves. 5. use a good quality Canola oil(has no taste or odor). 6. 1 tsp vanilla. 7. 1 apple peeled and chopped. I did not ice them as, I felt that they had enough flovour on their own. I will make these again and again! Yummm;)

I just made these with the following changes: white whole wheat flour, 1 cup applesauce instead of oil, 1 tsp, cinnamon, 1/2 tsp each of allspice and nutmeg, only 2 eggs, frosted with cream cheese frosting.  SO GOOD, MOIST, perfect.

Really like this recipe. I used the solids from juicing the carrots and and used avocado oil instead. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.

Just made these, and all my kids liked them...even my ultra picky kid, who hasn't had a vegetable in years. I substituted the oil with applesauce (even exchange) and they are moist and delicious. Great Job!!

I am with those that find the recipe too salty with too much bicarb of soda and not sweet enough.  To be fair I did leave out the raisons and initiallly I thought this may have been the cause of the problem.  However, I see that others who followed the recipe closely also experienced the same problem.  However, unlike others, I quite liked the texture of the muffins (I didn't find them to oily) so, next time, I will probably just add more sugar, get rid of the salt and reduce the bicarb

So I was looking for a carrot muffin to use from my juicing recipe (carrots, apple, celery, kale, and ginger-mostly carrots and apples), and I found this one.  My adjustments were to lower the amount of salt and soda, plump up the raisins in Grand Marnier/water/sugar over heat, add nutmeg, plus a nice cream cheese/honey/vanilla topping when they come out of the oven.  Very nice!!!!

Difficult recipe to make but not because of the ingredients  - it is a question of the baking powder and baking soda amounts...because the rest is okay.

I adjusted this recipe to make it a little healthier and to also use what I had on hand as our budget's quite tight. To add more flavor and spice, I soaked the raisins in unsweetened chai tea. I used whole wheat white flour, cut the baking powder and baking soda back to a teaspoon each, cut the salt back to a 1/4 teaspoon and to cut back on the fat and because I'm low on eggs, I used only two eggs then added in 1/2 cup nonfat plain yogurt, 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 3/4 cup homemade organic applesauce (what I did was figure that an egg is about 1/4 cup of liquid so when I subtracted two eggs, there was a half cup of liquid I needed to re-add). The applesauce and raisins add plenty of sweetness on it's own so I was able to get away with 1/3 of a cup of sugar. I started with one cup of carrot that I diced fine in my mini processor and really, that was plenty. I'm really trying to stretch what I had so I didn't want to use all I had in one muffin recipe. The outcome was really great. Moist muffin that had enough flavor and sweetness and you really don't miss the extra eggs, sugar or fat. This will make a nice breakfast/snack for us tomorrow. NOTE: Next time, I'd cut this back. One full recipe gave me 12 regular sized muffins and 18 mini-muffins. We'll eat them all gladly--it's just quite a gamble when you haven't tried the recipe first.

I use freshly ground wheat and instead of sugar Aguave-Sirup, and just 1/2 cup of oil. After a day they are perfect. Everytime we are in for afternoon-snachk in preschool I make them.

I've made these atleast 10 times. I omit all oil and replace it with unsweetened applesauce. I buy matchstick carrots and blend them in a blender with the applesauce. I probably use 3/4c of applesauce and 3c carrots. I use 2c whole wheat flour, 1/2c brown sugar, 1/2c white sugar and 2 tbs cinnamon, I've added almond extract as well. I use the suggest amount of baking soda and powder and eggs and these turn out  great! A healthy snack for my 3yr and she loves them so I guess that's all that matters!

After making the changes as previously suggested (applesauce for oil etc..), these were very good muffins. I've already made them again. The kids love them.

This is indeed a great muffin recipe.  The only problem with it is that 1 whole tsp. is too much salt.  The last time I made this recipe, I cut the salt to 1/2 tsp., used whole wheat flour, and added about 1 tsp. of vanilla.  The texture remained perfect and the flavor was fabulous.

I liked these muffins. I changed it a little. Put only a dash of salt. Replaced half of the oil with "no sugar added blueberry applesauce". I like the idea of having these muffins on hand for my little ones for breakfast or snack. I can't get any of them to eat carrots that aren't hidden in something else.

We found this to be a very good recipe, and have not even tried it with the recomended frosting. We are on our second batch of them, they freeze well, and make a great breakfast when warmed.

These were really good. I didn't have any raisins so I left them out with no problem. Also, to cut back on fat and calories, I replaced some of the oil with applesauce (about 1/3 cup) and used 2 whole eggs and 2 egg whites. Turned out great. Stay nice a moist for a few days.

I also thought these were very salty and bland.  I revamped the recipe- 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour. 1/4 tsp salt. Egg beaters instead of eggs. 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil (like previous reviewer) and added 1 Tbsp splenda sugar.  After these changes everyone in the house liked them much better!

I followed this recipe exactly, and found the results to be extremely oily. The muffin liners were literally dripping with oil, and the muffins were very greasy.  I made them for a party at my daughter's day care, and had to discard them and make another recipe. The flavor was good though, even without frosting.

I wanted a recipe to "up-use" the pulp from my juicer and this fit the bill perfectly!  The only other change I made was instead of using one cup of oil, I substituted a 1/2 cup of oil and a 4 oz container of applesauce - muffins were still moist and delicious.

I should have read the other reviews - way too salty. And a bit too bland. Not a big hit with my muffin loving family. Next time I will stick to my fav zucchini muffin recipe and jst swap in carrots.

Too salty and too oily, for sure.

I used this as a base recipe for ginger mango muffins, using chopped candied ginger for the raisins and 2 cups of diced mango for the carrots.  Subbed 1/4 cup of Thai chili-infused sesame oil for 1/4 cup of the vegetable oil, added 1 teaspoon ground cayenne.

Next time I will probably cut down to a pinch of salt, reduce the oil majorly, and do a brown sugar crust.

It is funny, I never usually follow recipes...I just use them as a guide.  So...for this one, I put yogurt in substitue for most of the oil, I used less sugar, and I used whole wheat flour instead.  They turned out great and not too oily.  But, I would never have used all that oil!  yogurt or applesauce works as a great substitute.

Great place to start, but like many I made changes - still wasn't all that satisfied. Instead of the oil, I used applesauce (which I do with all my baking). The taste that was strongest to me was the baking soda so I'll have to decrease that next time. So the muffins weren't a waste, I just smeared some honey and almond cream cheese on top and YUM! I also substituted some carrots with shredded zucchini, added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of cloves.

I followed the recipe without reading the reviews first and that was a mistake, there's just too much salt in this recipe. Otherwise, I would give this recipe 4 stars for great muffin-y texture and good rise but the salt needs to be cut by at least half and maybe slightly less baking soda. My toddler wouldn't eat these and he usually goes for muffins of any flavor.

These were very good with the suggestions by all the reviewers that included: sub 1/2 cup applesauce for oil, and use half whole wheat flour and other half white flour.  All of my kids enjoyed this and I would have given the recipe 5 stars if it had been written with the above changes.  A keeper of a recipe!  You gotta love the reviewers who improve good recipes like this one!

Tasty and easy.  I used golden raisins and cut back the baking powder to 2 tsps instead of a tbsp.

These are amazing. Better than store bought, hands down! I hate cooked raisins so I left those out and I didn't frost them, but I didn't change anything else. They were super easy, and the texture is amazing.

I followed the advice of others here and substituted the oil with 1 C applesauce and 1/4 C oil, used 2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. nutmeg, 2 C of finely minced carrot, eliminated the baking powder and added 1 t. vanilla. They were good this way, but not exactly what I'd call "Awesome", but I didn't add frosting, just dusted with some powdered sugar.

Way... too much oil. I would have also liked to have more flavor. It was a little bland, but the raisins helped. I still had fun making it! Just have to make some changes for the future.

I also made these muffins and followed the 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil suggestion as well as the suggestions to decrease the salt and baking powder. I too added cinnamon and nutmeg. I also added one chopped apple and almond extract. The muffins were good and my family enjoyed them.

I teach Family and Consumer Science and tried this muffin for the vegetable unit we are on.  Usually I end up with five different results with just one recipe, but this one turned out the same in each kitchen!!  I did follow the other reviews by reducing the powder, soda and salt.  I also used the 3/4 c applesauce and 1/4 c oil.  Believe it or not, the high school kids that ate this really liked it!  Of course I left out the raisins(you know kids), but they were quite surprised at how good they tasted.  I will keep using this recipe in class, and at home. I will add the raisins, and walnuts I think!

These muffins were very bland. My four year old threw hers in the trash. No one would touch them. My suggestion is, if you do attempt these, slap as much icing on them as possible to try to give them a little sweetness. (and doesn't a sugary icing defeat the purpose of a healthy muffin?)

These are the best carrot muffins I have ever had! I used the advice of some and only added half the salt. I used 3/4 cup applesauce sweetened with splenda and 1/4 cup oil. I used egg replacer. I only had about 2 1/4 c. carrots grated so that is all I used. I would say that 3 cups of carrots would not be too many and next time I will make sure I use 3 cups of grated carrots. The raisins sweeten it enough that you do not need extra sugar or icing, in my opinion and I may even use less salt each time until I see if it actually needs the salt as I am not a salt user. This is a incredible recipe and very healthy if you make certain adjustments.

These muffins were very good but I took some advice and used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil instead of the 1 cup oil the recipe called for. They were nice and moist. Next time I will add some more sugar.

I thought these were good, but not especially healthy with 1 cup of oil and 4 whole eggs! I used applesauce in place of the oil and next time will use egg substitute. I also think that 3 cups of carrots is waaay! too much. I made these for my son's share day at pre-school and I saw an awful lot go uneaten. I proably wont make these again.

A big hit at my house! Both the 4 year old and the 40 year old boy loved them. Mine turned out moist, and the only difference I did from the recipe is to add a cup of walnut pieces.

Tried this recipe today to surprise my wife who was in dialysis this afternoon. The 2 teaspoons of baking  soda made the muffins bitter and could not eat them. ...very disappointed with all recipes as this is the 2nd recipe that failed and I am no stranger to baking. :-(

My first mistake was following the recipe, which apparently everyone who gave this recipe more than two stars did not do and my second mistake was eating one of the muffins I made. This "healthy" muffin, (which calls for a cup of oil?!?) ends up tasting more like a savoury muffin-shaped-thing with carrots in it, that has a baking powder aftertaste which lingers for hours, or until you brush your teeth. Now, I'm stuck with two dozen mini "muffins" that do not taste good but may have the density to be effective projectiles for an impromptu food fight.

The muffins came out too oily and salty. Mine were so bad that I couldn't even eat them. If you're going to try this recipe I suggest eliminating most of the baking soda/salt and greatly reducing the oil, or substituting it for applesauce like some others have suggested.

I made this recipe and doubled it as I wanted to drop some off to a friend that had been ill, and also some to my kids. I thought at first that doubling it was the mistake I made, and maybe I had done something wrong when I did the amounts. They were not good at all. Very bland, too oily, just no taste. My son said they were like sawdust and did not want to take any to his sister when he went to visit! I wasted a lot of ingredients. The only thing that saved a couple of them were that my partner put cream cheese icing on them so he could eat one or two. Will not make them again.

I did not care for these muffins. They may have been good, but the recipe uses too much soda. All I could taste was the baking soda!

These taste salty.  You can't tell there is any sugar in them at all.  I would recommend doubling (maybe even tripling) the sugar.  Also, I didn't have any oil so I used warm water.  They were light and fluffy.

awesome indeed. i subbed 3/4 applesauce for the oil like the other readers and didn't use raisins and these came out pretty good. next time i might run the batter through the hand blender to incorporate the shredded carrots better, but awesome as is. my 1-year-old liked a lot too.

These are not the best muffins if you follow the recipe. I substituted flax for eggs (4 eggs are a lot), used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose, reduced the oil to 1/2 cup (which is still more than I wanted) and used 1 cup of the water from the raisins. I didn't have applesauce on hand. I was also heavy handed with the cinnamon. Made a good muffin, but I will probably try a different recipe next time.

I followed all suggestions.  I reduced the soda and baking powder and salt by 1/2.  I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 cup white sugar.  They were just ok, not bad, just a little bland, and I still taste baking soda.  We are having them for breakfast, but I want to add a little glaze or honey or something to liven them up a bit.

These were very good. Not too sweet. I did add a sprinkle of nutmeg, and used white wheat flour, since that is all I had on hand. I also substituted half of the oil with applesauce. They were light, moist and very yummy. I served them with cream cheese and my family ate them up.

I have made these muffins over and over again. Best carrot muffins ever! I have made these as the recipe reads but I have also tried them as VEGAN muffins. I subtituted the 4 eggs for 4 TBSP of flax seed oil and 12 TBSP of water and voila! They taste amazing this way too. The flax gived them a nutty flavor. Super Yum!

These were good, but not great. After reading everyone else's reviews, I made a few changes and I cut the recipe in half so I didn't have a bunch of muffins nobody was going to eat, just in case they weren't good. I used 1/2 of baking soda called for, and I sub. all the oil for unsweetened applesauce. I also used golden raisins instead of regular (it was all i had on hand). The only issue I really had was half the muffin stuck to the muffin paper. Overall, I would probably make them again, tweaking the ingredients one more time. I give it a 3 b/c the taste was good, but I also tweaked the ingredients.

I cut this recipe in half so I could make 24 mini muffins. I'm not enjoying them as they taste too strongly of baking soda or baking powder.  I won't be making them again.

I, too, went by the overall rating and neglected to read what others had posted. This turned out too "eggy". They were also very bland. The amount of sugar was perfect but you cant taste the cinnamon. I even sprinkled in nutmeg. I did add 1/2 cup of wheat flour to sub. the white flour. Next time I will add only 3 eggs, substitute for 3/4 cup of apple sauce of the oil, and add more spices. But, it is a healthier alternative to those recipes with more sugar. But... I did not add the frosting, so, I am sure if you add the frosting it will add more flavor to the muffins. But for those who are omitting the frosting, you really need to spice these up.

OOPS... I had the ingredients for this all mixed up before I read the reviews.  PANIC!  So I tripled the cinnamon, added an extra 1/2 cup of flour to turn down the oil, and added about 1/2 cup of maple syrup to sweeten the baking soda.  (And I hadn't soaked the raisins, so I figured it could use the liquid).  After all that, they came out pretty well!

I LOVE this recipe, I make it all the time, it's quick and yummy - I add flax seed, a little oat bran, often some walnuts/pecans, and sometimes sub apple sauce for the oil - muffins always turn out awesome and are usually gone in 2 days!

Good starting recipe.  Some changes are a must though.  Sounds like reducing the oil and adding apple-sauce works well.  For my muffins, I reduced the oil to 3/4cup and added a little milk to replace the liquid.  I reduced the amount of eggs to 2, instead of 4.  I also added only 1 tsp of baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, and 3 tsp baking powder.  Don't forget to add vanilla extract (approx. 1-2tsp), this will add flavor and make your muffins appear to be sweeter than they actually are.  If you are a sweet tooth, definately add more sugar or more raisins.

This recipe is really good.  I also cut back on the oil and added applesauce instead.  I also halfed the sugar so that my 15 month old could enjoy as well.  This will be a recipie I will use for a long time to come.

These sounded good..they looked good in the pan..they smelled geat.  Only problem is that they have no taste.  Very, very bland and disappointing.  Gave 2 stars for the fact that my kids will eat them but even they (who are not picky) are not thrilled about them.

This is an awesome recipe! I added walnuts a little under a cup. I also used 3/4 vegetable oil and 1/4 apple sauce. I used the pulp from my juicer which also had orange pulp. It truly adds a perk. Fantastically YUMMY!!

Good base recipe. I omitted the raisins, added shredded apple, 1/2 cup of oatbran and substituted whole wheat flour for half the AP flour.  I also followed the advice of other reviews and reduced the baking powder to 2 teaspoons and baking soda to 1 teaspoon.  I also made a low carb version with splenda instead of brown sugar and added chopped walnuts.  Both recipes were well received.

I too decided to change this recipe as well.  I added 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cup white.  I added approx 1/3 cup wheat germ as well.  I also added vanilla to this recipe and a bit of water to compensate for the dry wheat germ that I added.  

I agree that next time it will be better to remove some oil and added apple sauce and reduce the salt.

These are exactly what they say, a great muffin with little sugar.  If you're used to boxed or packaged "muffins" with a lot of added sugar, try a cupcake recipe instead.

Not much flavor, too much salt, consistency ok but a little too crumbly.   Will find another recipe next time.

These were very yummy. I used a little nutmeg with the cinnamon. Next time I will try with a little less oil. Made these again with the following revisions: 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 3 tsps baking powder, 1/4 cup oil, 3/4 cup applesauce. I poured 1/4 cup oil into a measuring cup then added the applesauce until the mixture reached the 1 cup line, much easier than doing them separately. Also, I cooked the muffins for 20 minutes and they came out perfectly moist. These turned out great, I will absolutely make again with these changes. Thanks.

My muffins turned out terrible. I followed the recipe exactly except I put walnuts in them instead of raisins.  They were not at all sweet and very bland tasting.  I'll try again but maybe try the icing with them and see if that helps.

These were good, but not great.  I will probably not make again as I have a better carrot cake recipe that I can use instead.    There was nothing wrong with them, but nothing special either, sorry.

i used applesauce instead of the oil and they turned out very well. they could use a little more sweet...dusting the tops with a little powdered sugar helped. next time i will probably add a little more cinnamon and sugar and a little less salt and baking powder/soda.

These were very good, I did sub chunky applesauce for the oil, and that added some taste as well as making them healthier.  I also did not use a frosting, my kids loved them as breakfast muffins.

This are great!  I have celiac disease, so I made them with gluten-free flour, and added 1/2 tsp of xanthum gum.  Following others' suggestions, I cut the salt to 1/2 tsp and the oil to 3/4 cup.  I didn't bother frosting them, they DO NOT need it.

They still came out kinda oily, so next time I might try 1/2 c of oil.  By far the best GF carrot muffins I've tried!

While a reasonably good muffin with all the changes recommended, ie. less salt, less bp, less bs, reduce oil to 1/3 cup and add 2/3 cup applesauce, the kids did not eat these.  It might have helped if I had actually shredded instead of grated the carrots.  I also did not frost them. I'll try again with those changes.

Great way to get my kids and their friends to eat carrots! Soaking the raisins first definitely enhanced the juiciness of the muffins. Recipe calls for an awful lot of oil, though. Substituting apple sauce and/or orange juice makes these an even better nutritious snack. I don't recommend the icing from the other site, however. The consistency was runny, it tasted like a mouthful of cream cheese, and added nothing to the overall experience. These muffins are great just on their own!

I am very thrilled with this recipe.  My son is 17 months old and a pretty good eater except with vegetables.  I was so happy to find a way to get him to eat carrots (one of his not so well liked veggies). Not only did he devour the first muffin but kept on saying... "More, please, More, please."  That in his language is...two baby thumbs up. Thanks for helping this mom find a great vegetable variation.

Oh... when I went to the store I forgot to get raisins, then we were snowed in. So I had to use a bag of Craisins (dried cranberries) and they turned out wonderfully!!!

I also 1/2 my white flour with wheat flour. They did come out with a cakey consitency. I didn't change the amount of oil. My 2 yr old wasn't that happy with them but then I didn't put the icing on them. Mine also came out very greasy on bottom. I would suggest either adding more sugar/brown sugar to the recipe or definitely putting the icing on top.

We ate these without frosting. My kids enjoyed them fresh, but were disinterested in leftovers.  I thought they were too salty. Other than that a fair recipe. Next time I will omit the salt and substitute apple sauce for half of the oil.

I might be tempted to add a bit more brown sugar next time. Also, they only took about 15-20 minutes in the oven.

I made a few changes. Cut flour by 1/4 cup and cut oil in half. Added 1/2 c flax seed meal.  Also only use 1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar.  I sometimes skip the raisins or substitute chopped apples or nuts.  Usually bagged goods are best right it if the oven, actually, these muffins are better the next day!

This is the first bad recipe I ever tried on Allrecipes. I should have read the reviews. I saw the misleading title and simplicity of ingredients and wasted 1.5 hours and all the money on the ingredients. They look beautiful but taste tin-y. Terrible aftertaste which maybe is the baking soda or the oil. Admittedly I didn’t use raisins so maybe needed more sugar but based on all the changes others had to make, I don’t know why the recipe stands as is for others to have to throw out! I think you should update this with less oil and banking powder and soda. Maybe more sugar and and extra egg while. For sure change the name until it is true! Guests coming, no muffins for them...

I did it exactly as per the recipe. It turned out too oily and lack of flavor. May be better to lessen oil, add more sugar and carrots.

AMAZING!! Have been searching long and hard for the perfect carrot muffin recipe. Thankfully,  the search has ended with this one!  I'm a big reader of reviews and am always discouraged when all of the reviews are about how people tweaked recipes.  I knew that yours was the one to try when I read the first 20 reviews and none of them were tweaked yet perfect. I didn't use the clove and only added coconut and was beyond impressed with how most and delicious these muffins were! Definitely a keeper! Thank you!

Skipped the rasins (picky kids) but they were super super eggy and not sweet at all. It was almost like I was eating a carrot omelette . Next time I'll cut it down to 2 eggs and increase the cinnamon

Very nice! Totally moist and flavourful.

I replaced the 1 cup of vegetable oil with 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce (something I do regularly), and they came out beautifully

These were so over oily which made them taste quite gross. I looked online and found that most muffin recipes call for half the oil. I will try these again using 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c plain yogurt in place of 1 c oil. Hopefully that will make them awesome, and then I can change my review / feelings about these muffins.

I did not use a cup of raisins and I added coconut to half of the batter. They turned out great!  
Also to get the bigger muffins, I made sure the oven was set at 400 degrees and I filled the muffin cups to the tip top. My family loved them.

I consider myself a pretty good baker, but these muffins were the most disgusting things I’ve ever made or eaten in my life. No offence, but I’m never making these again. Too salty, too many eggs, not sweet enough, and just overall terrible .

I have 2 non-gluteners in my house,  so I’m always looking for recipes that suit  their needs. These muffins were well received! I didn’t have fresh apples, so I used 1/2 cup of applesauce instead and it worked just fine. When I make them again, I will probably add another 1/4 cup of sugar since they were not especially sweet. I’ll also use the fresh apple. Oh yes, I topped mine with chopped walnut and dried cranberries, Tasty!

Salty, I  was puzzled with the amount of salt as I have never used this much in a muffin recipe. Could have used more sugar, I did not use raisins so that may be the reason why. I may have to make frosting to mask the saltiness.  This was my only problem. I will use an alternate recipe next time.

I made these with a gluten free flour. Used a food processor to shred (almost purée) the carrots. Great recipe. My son, his friend, and my friend all enjoyed them. Very moist and the blend of carrots and raisins is delicious.

You know here I thought you could not get a worse carrot muffin recipe than the one in Betty Crocker' s red and white coffee table addition cook book but I was wrong my health fanatic fifteen year old daughter put it in her mouth let it roll off her tounge and ran to wash her mouth out. Thanks so much for the absolutely horrible recipe that I now have to eat. I wouldn't wish these on the poorest of people.

Based on reading couple of reviews, I reduced the salt, but these muffins are actually inedible. I'm pretty sure it's the amount of baking soda called for that destroyed these muffins. They tasted so terrible. What a waste of ingredients.

This was a very disappointing waste of my ingredients. Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before baking these. My daughter took one bite and said, "They're really greasy and salty."  Lesson learned: always read reviews.

Overall I liked it. Not greasy at all. I made the recipe exactly, no substitute at all. Salty yes, would definitely reduce the amount of salt or whatever is making that salty flavor. Not the best muffin I have ever tasted but definitely not the worst. Btw definitely the right amount of sugar for me:)

I followed the written recipe as closely as I could. We didn't have raisins, so I excluded that step. We wrung the juice out of the carrots, even though I didn't notice the directions for doing so. I figured it was like making a zucchini cake or fritter. And, we didn't frost them. My only complaint was the time and energy it took me to grate three cups of carrots, so I will probably make it with less xarrot next time.  We loved them. I am keeping this recipe to make again and again.

I made the recipe as written once. That was enough. So this rating is for the recipe as written.

I made all kind of adjustments the second time. I lowered the number of eggs, (I used 2 I think) and leavening (1 tsp of each), added a bit of bran for a nutty flavor.  Added more cinnamon than called for because I love it.   I kept the oil the same, and the bran I used soaked it up.

I made several changes and the muffins are delish! I used gluten free bread mix for the flour. I used 2 cups of carrots and 1 cup of zucchini. I used 2 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda. I did not use the raisens. I also used 2 tsp of cinnamon Also, I did not use any salt. Finally, I used 1/2 cup of mashed banana and 1/2 cup of oil. I think this is a great basic recipe to have fun playing with the ingredients.

We'll, the grown ups loved it, but to make it healthier would substitute some applesauce for some of the oil. Our fussy son though said "not my favorite - not as good as McDonalds".

I made it without raisins and used gluten free flour instead of all purpose. I didn't think they were sweet enough. I'll make them again but add more brown sugar. Otherwise, the carrot to muffin ratio and texture were great!

I really liked this recipe. I made three changes. I used 4 cups of carrots, golden rasins and I subbed the oil for a cup of Apple sauce. The muffins turnes out really well. My 2 year old approved!

I changed out the raisins for cranberries and iced half of them with Cream Cheese Frosting. They're amazing on their own and equally amazing when you're wanting a bit of sweet with the icing. Will most definitely become a staple for me!

I made the muffins exactly as recipe suggests but added nutmeg and ginger.
I was looking for a high calorie and fat muffin for my son is a picky eater and under weight. He hasn't tried them yet but hopefully it is a hit! Fingers crossed.

I'm giving a 2 because it's a good start.  But you must read the reviews.  I used only 1/3 the veggie oil and added applesauce, to make up for rest. Substituted 1/2 c whole wheat flour, a little extra cinnamon and some nutmeg. also used 3 cups freshly grated carrots And a very large fugi apple.  Made a dozen muffins and a small loaf. This BTW made very  light and flavorful goodies and pretty health.  Read some of the exacting reviews and you'll be happy.  BTW I'm not a baker and this was a first try for these.  Even was confident to share with our neighbor, who is a baker.  Patted myself on the back for this one!

Fantastic recipe!! These are absolutely delicious and very moist. My husband and kids ate a few before they even cooled off. Grating the carrots is the hardest part and looks like a lot in the batter but it works! I substituted 1/4 c of applesauce for 1/4 c of the vegetable oil & I did not soak the raisins prior to adding them into the batter, aside from that I followed the recipe exactly. I made these in a mini muffin pan which only took 13 minutes to bake and I received 54 muffins.  I'm freezing these to put into my daughters lunch so I'm hoping they keep their great flavor after being frozen. Definitely will be making these again. Thank you!!

Some people complain that these muffins are too oily, but I didn't find them any more oily than the store bought ones from the bakery. In terms of taste I love them and they were super moist. My only recommendation would be to add more cinnamon. At least 1/2 tsp more per recipe.

This recipe had so much baking soda that I couldn't eat the muffin. If you make this recipe I would suggest cutting back a lot with the baking soda.

I've made these dozens of times over the last few years and everyone loves them. I use canola oil typically and don't soak the raisins and love how they turn out. Moist, but not too moist. Sometimes I do half wheat and half white flour and add in a little extra cinammon. And sometimes I've done them without raisins. I find them a little dry without the raisins but my husband loves them both ways.

I should mention that I live in a higher elevation in Canada. So I consistently have to add more liquid to recipes. This is one of the few that I don't. The flour here is also rougher and more natural than the flour I have used in the states so it makes for a dough that is more dry when using white flour.

I made the recipe as is, with one exception of adding half teaspoon vanilla. The muffins cooked nicely but tasted too salty and a bit bland with not enough sweetness (you have to rely on the raisins for sweetness.) Next time, I will omit the salt, add the vanilla and maybe a bit more sugar and spice.

I did not care for this. Sadly I did not read the reviews prior to baking. It was the first recipe that appeared when I type in carrot muffins so I went with it. Agree with another user who indicated the high ratings are due to people making all kinds of substitutions. I followed the recipe to the letter and I am left with the most greasy, salty, egg laden mess. Not edible.

Couldn't even bring myself to bake it, I chucked it when the batter came out more like dough and tasted like baking soda. I'm just wondering why everyone who CHANGED THE RECIPE gave this good reviews, it's totally misleading and really just shows a complete lack of common sense.

So I read reviews after I made the recipe and before I baked as I was suspicious of the salt, baking soda & oil proportions. Batter was indeed salty. I had already substituted 1/2 cup white flour with whole wheat flour, so added another 1/2 cup whole wheat flower. I added 1/2 c more carrots. Doubled the cinnamon, then added 3 tbs agave syrup plus some nutmeg. Made 12 regular size muffins and 12 mini muffins. Muffins were delicous  with Kerrygold butter....so if you missed the reviews like I did, with a little tweaking the recipe can be saved.

Turned out great. The texture was perfect. 
*I would however double the cinimmon and cut back on the salt.

I knew right away something was wrong when I tasted the batter and it had a bitter taste to it. I thought maybe it was one of those batters that tasted better after it was baked than it did before hand so I put half the batch into pans and baked them. That didn't help at all. Hoping to address the issues of the recipe and try again later, certainly with less baking powder, baking soda, salt, and eggs.

There was way too much oil and not much spice. I will try these again with some nutmeg or allspice and try the suggestions of cutting back on the oil and replacing with applesauce.

We didn't have raisins.  I used a 1/2 cup of shredded coconut.
Instead of vegetable oil, I used 1/3 cup melted coconut oil, 1/4 cup cinnamon applesauce.  Much healthier and less calories!
2 shredded carrots was plenty!  I think it yielded a cup and a half.
For the glaze, I used a cup of confectioners sugar, a tbsp cinnamon, and 2 tbsp coconut milk.  Just whisk together and pour on the muffins when you pull them out of the oven.
I used dark brown sugar in mine which is probably why the muffins are so dark.  
When I mixed the wet and dry ingredients, the batter looked kind of dry, so I added coconut milk until it looked moist enough and I knew I wouldn't be pulling bricks out of the oven (made that mistake of baking too dry batter before!!).  If you've made muffins before, you know the consistency to go for.

Make this recipe every other week for my boys. They love them. The only change I made was replacing the baking soda with more baking powder. I personally don't like the taste of baking soda. Other then that the recipe is great.  I make them in a mini muffin pan so my one year old can hold them.

This is a good muffin.  I've made them twice now -- the first time exactly as the recipe read, the second time with modifications.  They were still good the first time, though a bit oily and not sweet enough for me. The second time I substituted half the oil with applesauce, added 2 TBSP of ground flax seeds, some vanilla and lemon flavorings, maybe a quarter cup more raisins, and a quarter cup more brown sugar. Quick and easy to make, great out the door muffin!

I normally would pass on any recipe using a whole cup of oil (we aren't exactly frying the muffins!), but I read a few reviews first and found that it could easily be reduced to 1/3 cup.  So I did that, and also pureed a pear with a tablespoon of milk to throw in as well.  I omitted the raisins, as I had none on hand, and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  Baked on the top rack, 350 for 30 minutes and they came out absolutely PERFECT.  Moist, soft, and really delicious.  My 5 year old and 2 year old just had one each for breakfast; I love yummy kid-friendly recipes!

I liked the suggestion of changing the quantity of oil to 1/4cup oil and 3/4cup applesauce.  Very helpful and yummy suggestion.  Great recipe, will make again !

Way too much baking powder!!! While it gave the muffins a very light texture - more like popovers than muffins, it also gave them the metallic/soapy taste and bitter aftertaste of eating straight baking powder. I won't bother even tweaking this, just look for another recipe.

I'm so sorry but these by far were the worst carrot muffins I have ever tasted. I followed the recipe accordingly and they turned out so dry and bland that I threw them out after baking them. They had no flavor, horrible texture and didn't even resemble a carrot muffin. I can't even say anything to improve them.

I wish I had read the reviews/really looked at the recipe first. SO MUCH OIL. I nearly gagged when I measured out one cup of oil. I just took them out of the oven. They taste OK, but are sitting on a paper towel..and leaving oil marks. Will be using an applesauce substitute next time!

I made several modifications and they came out FANTASTIC! I made these for my son's preschool class and was also trying to make a healthy muffin for my toddlers to eat for breakfast. 
I ommitted the raisins, used half white/half wheat flour, replaced 3/4 of the oil with applesauce, and reduced the baking soda, powder, and salt. I even threw in a shredded pear that I happened to have. Baked for 27 minutes.

I  made these muffins by leaving out the raisins and adding some oatmeal. 

While I found the amount of spice absolutely perfect, and that the muffins were very moist, I did not get that nice carrot flavour I so enjoy, nor did I feel that they were sweet enough for me.

By following the recommendations of other reviewers, these turn out great.  I reduced the baking soda, powder and salt, increased the cinnamon, and used mostly applesauce for the oil.  I also used half whole wheat flour.  My kids loved them.

I did not care for this recipe. The muffins smell too much of egg. Next time I'll make them I will exchange the eggs for milk and water. And exchange the oil for applesauce. I'll also add some crushed hazel nuts.

I should have read the other reviews before making these. Incredibly oily, all you can taste is vegetable oil. The recipe has potential though, I'm going to try again with applesauce. :)

Have a very small oven so halved the recipe. Added a bit of nutmeg. Used whole wheat flour, sunflower oil and dried cranberries as they were what was at hand. The batter worried me, the oil gave it an unfamiliar texture, but the end result was delicious. No frosting.  I'd prefer not to use so much oil so I will definitely try it with applesauce in place of some of the oil as suggested.

Really nice. Not sweet, but really satisfies that muffin/sweet craving anyway. A little honey on top doesn't hurt :) I like the low sugar/high carrot nutrition ratio. Hard to find out there in a sea of too many sugary baked goods. Thanks a lot!

These were pretty good. I made a few changes - some good and some bad. Used 50/50 flour, applesauce and no oil and added vanilla and walnuts and left out the raisins. Pretty dense but I blame the wheat flour. I will make these again with maybe a little white flour.

As others, I replaced some of the ingredients as follows: 1 cup oil became 1/3 cup oil and 2/3 cup apple sauce. 3 cups flour became 1 1/2 cups flour and 1/2 cup ground flaxseed. Everything else I followed and they came out great. Made 14 perfect muffins. I did not frost the top. They taste earthy with enough sweet taste that non health fanatics will enjoy them as well.

Good muffin. I too reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and substituted 3/4 cup of applesauce. I also used 4 jars of beechnut stage 2 carrot baby-food instead of the shredded carrots and I omitted the raisins!

These muffins are great!  The only reason I rated it four stars was because I substituted apple sauce for the oil, but the texture came out wonderful; it was very moist and light, and quite delicious!

I made two batches of these muffins.  The first, I put in the raisins and added a small shake of nutmeg.  The second, I didn't have any raisins, so I instead put in one cup of oats, along with the nutmeg.  Both were very good, and easy to make.  I didn't have any cream cheese to try the frosting.  Instead, while they were still warm, I sliced them in half and spread on butter or jam.  Very good!

This is a very good recipe for carrot muffins.  The only change I made was I substituted chopped walnuts for the raisins because I do not much care for raisins.

I've used the apple sauce, as someone suggested, and it was perfect! I watched the muffins dissapear, and everyone was complementing me. The taste is perfect - not too sweet, which I like. Next time I'll try adding more cinamon, just to turn it up a notch.

These are light, moist and really delicious!  I substituted 1 cup flour with whole wheat flour and they still taste like a treat.  I did not put raisins in them as my kids do not like them.  I will definately make them again

I make these muffins at work and have had nothing but comments on them and request for the recipe. I myself find them a tad bit dry with a hit of baking powder taste but other wise pretty good. it is quick, easy, and healthy and when need be cook it in a cake pan and layered it with icing for an effective carrot cake.

This is a good recipe to use if you need to use up carrots. Some changes I made though: I substituted oil for applesauce and I added more cinnamon and extra carrots, added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla essence and top it with icing sugar. In my opinion, they taste ok when you eat it on the first day (crunchy and a little hard) but tons better when you reheat it up in the mircowave the following day... it has the crumbly taste which I love in muffins. Not the best, but because of its simplicity and healthier ingredients, I'm going to rate this a 4! Thanks for the recipe!

I thought that I would make these "muffins" without the frosting. I wanted a muffin, not a cupcake.....  they have little taste.  Maybe they are better with the icing. Easy and quick but not worth it.   Sorry!

I liked these, and so did my son. They are a good treat that isn't too sweet. I didn't have applesauce on hand, but I'm going to change out some of the oil for that next time, and add more raisins.

these muffins really are great.  i made them without the icing.  it's great that they don't have too much sugar.  i wanted a low sugar snack for my toddler.  i made these for her and she eats them.  (this is great for anyone who has a picky toddler!)  i eat them too!

thanks for this recipe.  i will make them again!

They were good. I decreased the oil, and they turned out a bit dry but still with an oily taste. But all in all they were ok, and if you need to use up carrots, it's a good recipe.

This was a good way to use up some carrots, but I thought they needed some sort of frosting, which I didn't add.  I only had a mini muffin tin and it made a TON! If I make them again, I will add a frosting, but they were a pretty good little snack.

My 2 year old loves these, as do I.  Following recommendations, I reduced the oil to 1/3 cup and added 2/3 cup applesauce, used 2 eggs and 4 egg whites, and dropped the leavening to 2 t baking powder and 1 t soda.  I also did not add salt, and they are just right.    Fantastic!  :)

I really loved this, and so did my husband.  I didn't even ice them.  I just ate them all week!  Next time I would add a bit more carrot maybe, but they were very tasty and definitely pretty healthy as far as muffins/treats go.

The kids loved these!  I only got 12 muffins but I tend to make them on the largish side.  I ran out of raisins so I added dried cranberries.  Kids didn't even notice!  My youngest helped with the frosting and he too wanted to know if I'd make more when these are gone!  Lee

This recipe wasn't a great hit with the kids, they found it too bland and uninteresting, although my husband and I loved it!!! I found the cream cheese icing to need two more tbsp of brown sugar to give it the extra kick it needed.

These muffins are too salty.  They are only okay with the frosting...I hadn't intended on using it, but had to.  They definitely need half the salt and more sugar.

Good recipe! I've got a very anti-veggie toddler but she LOVES these muffins, and everyone else likes them too. I chose to substitute applesauce for half of the oil and instead of frosting them I simply sprinkled a little granulated sugar on top before baking. It added just the right amount of sweetness for our tastes.

I used 1/2 applesauce and these were moist.  My 1 year old ate them, but my 5 year old didn't care for them.  I thought they were pretty good, but not the best carrot muffin recipe I have tried.  These are very healthful, so it's a good recipe for young children, but I think older children may want something sweeter.

My kids aren't great fans of carrots, but they ate these up even without frosting!  I was going to substitute half the oil with applesauce as suggested, but found out I had none.  So I used oj instead.  They were very moist and delicious.  I had been looking for a good carrot muffin recipe and this is it!

These are just wonderful!  I left the raisins out and put small chopped haselnuts in instead, and I substituted half of the all purpose flour with whole wheat flour.  A wholesome treat that really doesn't stay around long...

I thought they were very bland and did not go over well in my house. My toddler didn't care for them either. I used the frosting as well and that made them a bit more tasty, but still not very good.
