Great simple recipe that will take normal cocktails to a new level. I used it to add sweetness to a watermelon, apple, lime and mango juice cocktail. It really pulled it together.

Made this today for a dinner party to serve with Lemon sorbet.  Big hit!  No changes the recipe. Will definitely make again.
