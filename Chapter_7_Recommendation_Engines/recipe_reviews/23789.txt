These waffles were wonderful! My whole family loved them. Just so you know, each serving is three waffles. I was surprised by how many waffles this recipe made.

Wonderful waffles! I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and liked them even more.

First, I scaled the recipe down to 2.  I got 7 square belgian-sized waffles (my machine is about 10 years old, so they may be smaller than those today).  I followed the recipe as stated except for adding a dash of cinnamon.  After cooking the first 2, I spotted oranges on the counter and thought that might be a nice addition.  Squeezed 1/2 orange juice and zested a small about and put in the rest of the batter.  This is a more time consuming recipe than many others.  I think I would use this only on the weekends when it wasn't so early in the morning getting the kids ready for school!  They smelled good and were somewhat dense.

This is a delicious waffle recipe - I followed the advice of some reviewers, and used 1 1/4 cup of flour and reduced the pecan amount to 1/3 cup  (that was plenty). I added 1 tbsp of maple syrup to the batter, and as other reviewers suggested stirred the pecans into the batter. I used only 
1/4 cup melted margarine (and omitted the oil altogether). Super flavoured waffles, which I'll make again.

In a rush when I made these, so didn't separate the eggs - just whisked them with the buttermilk. Also followed several reviewers suggestions and added the pecans to the batter.  These turned out fluffy and delicious - thanks for a great recipe!

I sliced up bananas and then had a variety ingredients to add including pecans, walnuts, chocolate chips and cinnimon chips and everyone could choose what they wanted and we all loved them! The only complaint was we should have had whipped cream too.

I replaced part of the flour with whole wheat flour and would do that again. I replaced all of the oil with applesauce and would do that again too. I did not have pecans (oops) so I made up the nuts section with a combination of sliced almonds and raw oats. We enjoyed these very much! I added a bit of extra sugar and also some vanilla. They still weren't quite sweet enough on their own but with toppings, they're delicious :) The step where I was supposed to whip the egg whites--I forgot to whip them and just folded them in at the end. I don't know how it would have affected them--mine were light & fluffy anyway.

I wish these were a little sweeter.  I will add more sugar next time.

This was nothing special, rather bland and doughy.  I feel like the pecans should go in the batter rather than on top.  Probably won't make again.

These waffles came out very good. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 2% and it still came out fine. I think the batter could use a little more sugar and a pinch of salt to make it perfect; I'll try that next time. I topped them with butter, sliced strawberries in sugar syrup and a tiny bit of whipped cream.

These waffles were easy and delicious.  I think next time I will add the nuts to the batter rather than sprinkling on top.  The nuts tended to stay in the middle and were not well distributed when done as directed.

Light and delicious!  Normally I wouldn't want the extra step of beating egg whites to stiff peaks, but it is totally worth it!  I substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour, and used 1/2 cup melted coconut oil in place of vegetable oil.  Made my own buttermilk by adding 2 tbsp. vinegar to the milk.  These turned out great and made about 10 round waffles.

I added vanilla and the nuts to the mix.  Came out great with a nice texture.  With syrup they were great.

I didn't bother to separate the eggs and added the pecans straight into the batter. Still delicious.

I made this without the pecans; I decided to add cranberries instead.  I also added pumpkin pie spice while I was at it and am pleased with how the waffles came out.  I'm realizing that I totally missed adding the butter in; I didn't even see it in the recipe.  However, it worked perfectly fine so I see no need to add it in.  I thought these were basic waffles that easily went well with my subs.  thanks for the recipe!

I had to add salt because the first one was plain tasting but after adding the salt into the batter it greatly improved the taste.

Such a yummy waffle recipe.  I, too, added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter.  I served it with the Buttermilk syrup recipe on this same site.  It's a keeper!
