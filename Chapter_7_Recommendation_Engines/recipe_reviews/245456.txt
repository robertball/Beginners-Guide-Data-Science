I added a finely chopped red bell pepper when sauteing the onions.  Otherwise made it as written, although adjusted the recipe for 4 rather than 8.  Yum yum and so much easier than standing over the stove stirring.  Will definitely do this whenever I want risotto.

I made it as directed. It seemed a little soupy when I checked after 30 minutes. I cooked it another 10 minutes. The rice was cooked perfectly. It was delicious!  My husband said it was better than my stove top version. I will be making this again as it was so much easier than doing it on the stove.
