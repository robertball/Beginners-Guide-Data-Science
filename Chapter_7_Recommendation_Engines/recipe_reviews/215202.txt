I love the name!  :)  I just called it "The Best Smoothie Ever!"  If you want this colder, freeze the banana before blending; or chill the smoothie--but who wants to wait to eat this after it's blended?  Like another reviewer, I prefer the "healthy" version with cocoa powder instead of chocolate syrup.  I also make it lower in fat by using water instead of milk.  But, if you don't care about calories, use frozen yogurt instead of milk--or cut the serving size in half!

i doubled the recipe and instead of using skim milk I used yogurt, and i used frozen bananas rather than room temperature. I didnt have any chocolate syrup so i used nutella as a replacement.  all in all, its a great recipe!!!

This will hit the spot! Delicious! I didn't want to wait for the banana to freeze so I added 2 ice cubes. I will add this to my recipe box for sure!

I feel as though I should say something else about the smoothie that I made. I made a horrible mistake by putting more peanut butter in then it said to and by using the Jiff Brand "Nutella" instead of chocolate syrup. My advise is to go with the recipe. Taste it then and if you wanna add something do it then. Not before hand just because you like peanut butter. Regardless, this recipe is a great idea and I'm glad the people liked it. Maybe I will learn from this mistake.

This is an awesome recipe!  I'm only 10 years old and I made it for my brother, my sister, and my mom.  The only problem was that it was too hot so we added 3 ice cubes to make it cooler.  It definitely made it better.  I will probably make this smoothie again!

I doubled this for both my kids, used frozen bananas, Trader Joe's organic peanut butter and a homemade with Splenda chocolate syrup. The kids thought this was great. I think I'll call this the Chunky Monkey!

This tasted okay. It was better than other similar drinks I have tried on here. I wouldn't really call it a smoothie, as it is about as thick as a Slimfast. I used lite chocolate syrup, Skippy natural peanut butter, and low fat milk. I was confused to why it called for skim milk when there was chocolate syrup and peanut butter in it though. When I blended it I used a hand emulsion blender to make it easy over getting out the blender. It tasted like a slighty thick or foamy chocolate milk with a hint of peanut butter. It worked fine today to use up a couple of bananas I needed to in the fridge. Thanks

It was really good! However, I added a tablespoon more chocolate sauce because the peanut butter flavor was really strong. The banana flavor was subtle, also, but if I tried hard enough I could taste it. I garnished it with a candy cane, a teaspoon chocolate sauce, and a Hershey's kiss, and this is honestly one of the best breakfast I've ever had. :)

I made this exactly as written & loved it!  I also made one w/vanilla yogurt instead of milk.  It was good but not as good as the original.  I am also going to try strawberry syrup next time instead of chocolate.  I'm sure the original will always be my favorite though.

Instead of syrup, I used 2 tbsp chocolate powder. To add the sweetness I added 2 tbsp of honey. Will try either frozen bananas or a couple of ice cubes to cool it down

I am absolutely addicted to this smoothie.  I substitute Vanilla Greek Yogurt for part of the milk just to give it a bit of a protein boost - it is AMAZING!

I've made this with vanilla yogurt instead of skim and banana flavored yogurt instead of skim and a banana.  Both ways are good.  I also toss in four ice cubes to stretch it more.  YUM.

Using skim milk and choc syrup somewhat cheapens the flavors in my opinion. I chose to use about two tablespoons of cocoa powder instead of chocolate syrup as other reviewers suggested, which helps cut out the added/processed sugars. I also used almond milk. Rather than sounding like I'm exaggerating, I'll just say it was so good that I used a spoon to scoop the tiny amount that still remained on the blades of the blender.

RATING IS FOR AS IT IS WRITTEN.  Read on...This became my go-to smoothie recipe AFTER I made some changes...1/2 vanilla yogurt, 1/2 milk, 1 spoonful peanut butter, 1 spoonful almond butter, whatever cocoa powder I have in the pantry, frozen bananas and crushed ice.  I make enough so I can have 2 glasses.  Turkey bacon rounds out breakfast.  Quite satisfying.

This is heaven in a glass! Tastes like a chocolate peanut butter banana milkshake. Indulgent! Nice change from the often too sweet berry/too much fruit smoothies. For me it was too thick using 1/2 c. milk so I up'd it to 1 full cup (I used almond milk) and used a frozen banana and 1/2 c. crushed ice because I like smoothies cold. It was still thick, creamy and is a wonderful combination of flavors. Great healthier alternative to traditional treats yet satisfies like one.

Sliced the banana and froze it to try and help keep it colder.  Used splenda sweetened chocolate syrup and added a 1/4 tsp of vanilla, then chilled it before drinking.  Filling and yummy, thanks!

I customized this to suit my needs but this was a great start! I used carob powder instead of choc syrup, frozen green bananas (great as a prebiotic) and added a tablespoon of flaxseed oil for an added boost of nutrition. I don't mind things that taste a little 'healthier' if you get my drift; I still found it quite delicious!

I make this with Dark Chocolate almond milk instead of milk & chocolate syrup. I add some organic ground flax or chia, a handful of fresh spinach, & even 1/2 scoop of chocolate protein powder to healthify it; and still tastes awesome.
Another smoothie tip if adding ice to your smoothies: freeze an ice tray with green tea cubes. The taste is unnoticeable and you get another nice health boost.

I make this all the time but I always use frozen bananas. It's much better that way. Frozen bananas make a nice ice cream kind of consistency. I also use cocoa powder rather than syrup. I like the taste just as much and there less sugar. It's best if you use bananas that are getting ripe--- yellow with some dark spots on it and then as I said before freeze them!

Too many calories. Instead use 1/2 Banana, 1 Tbs Almond Butter, and Whey protein. Use ice and water instead of milk. Delicious!,

My family thought this smoothie was awesome! I did use frozen bananas which I think made a big difference. It was thick like a milk shake and tasted like one, too. Thank you for this delicious treat!

Made this for myself after a 10-mile run this morning and it was fantastic. I replaced the chocolate syrup with chocolate protein powder and added a generous handful of ice cubes. Perfect recovery drink.

This recipe is awesome but we don't use choc syrup we used choc pwdr. After the first few times, we decided to change things up a bit. We now use 1 banana, 1/8 to 1/4 c creamy pb, 2 tbsp honey, 1 c of milk (coconut milk was awesome, next we'll try Almond milk with is healthier), 1 scoop of EAS choc fudge protein pwdr, 1 tbsp flax seed pwdr and some ice. Made it even more awesome. When I put some of mine in the freezer and accidently froze a bit of it, it kind of reminded me of a Wendy's shake, only healthy!

This was delicious! I ran and made it immediately after reading it after I realized we had every ingredient already. I imagine that this could be used as a meal replacement since it has ingredients I eat anyway in the morning (bananas and milk, for starters). You could always use reduced fat peanut butter and cut the amount of PB and chocolate.

Hm... This was... Interesting. I was stuck between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on 4 anyways. If I make this again, I think I'd reduce the peanut butter and add vanilla. Make sure you freeze the banana and milk beforehand for about an hour also, like the others suggested so you dont have a warm fizzy shake.

This came out pretty good to have after my yoga workouts at the gym. I made it on Sunday, let it chill in the fridge, and had some of it last night. I've used Peanut Butter and Company's Smooth Operator peanut butter. I would make it again with no alterations.

This is a five star recipe however I made it this way: 1 banana, 1 cup unsweetened almond milk, 2 tbsp smooth pb, 1 tbsp cocoa powder, 1 tsp stevia. Yields 2 servings. If you want to stretch it just add more almond milk. Amazing. Husband was asking for seconds immediately .... but sadly there were none ...! Lol!

I love this as is, but I also experimented, as others did. I added frozen strawberries --delicious. Added ice, yum. I even added spinach (and strawberries) - couldn't even taste it. I love how the peanut butter adds weight and substance. Filling and satisfying. This has become a frequent lunch in my house.

Delicious. I modified a bit. Substituted 2 T. cocoa powder for chocolate syrup, and whole milk for skim. Added 1/2 c. banana yogurt, 1 t. vanilla extract, 1 T. honey, 1 scoop chocolate protein powder and 5-6 ice cubes. It was yummy but quite sweet. Next time I would cut out the honey, and use half a banana if using banana yogurt, or a whole banana with plain yogurt.

I modified it and used 30 cal Almond milk I also added Chia  seeds.  I gave it a four because it is too sweet with 2 tablespoons of chocolate syrup.

If I make it again I will use more milk and less syrup.

Y-U-M-O!!  Followed the recipe as listed.  It was delicious.  No changes needed. Did not bother to slice the banana, just broke it into chunks and let the blender do the rest. Recipe did not specify smooth or chunk peanut butter.  Having both on hand, I opted for the chunky.  Don't think it would matter which type of peanut butter you used  For a colder smoothie, freeze the banana.  Will definitely be making this recipe again.  So easy, so quick, and so good.

I used.2% milk because that's all I had and chunk peanut butter because it's all I had on hand.  It's very tasty and not too rich.  Definitely recommend.

This was super yummy but not really a smoothie. It was more like a spiced up chocolate milk. We like our smoothies a bit icy so I added about a cup of crushed ice into the blender and THEN it was a true smoothie. I then had to add a little bit extra peanut butter and chocolate mix to compensate for the water that was added. YUM!

Pretty darn good. Been making smoothie's for my 7 year old daughter lately cause she got something in her mouth from dentist and can hardly eat anything with it in. This is the best she has liked. Probably cause of course their is chocolate in it! But still healthy for her. Only difference I did with it is double the recipe and add 2 ice cubes. Also snuck a small bit of carrot in it cause my daughter needs the right nutrition but can't even taste it anyways. Ha! I will be making this recipe often anyways from now on! I love it myself!

Very good but I felt a little guilty having a smoothie with chocolate syrup in it.  I added two ice cubes to make it cold but next time I'll freeze the banana before making it instead.

I adapted this recipe to the one on the back of Carnation Instant Breakfast packets.  3/4 C. lowfat milk, ice cubes, carnation instant breakfast mix and frozen banana.  Then I just add the peanut butter.  I love it.

I admit I haven't tried this specific recipe, but I make one very similar to it that I love. I am a runner, and it's an ideal post workout recovery drink. I use chocolate milk, PB, frozen banana, and a dollop of Greek yogurt for extra protein. Delicious!

This was pretty tasty.  I used almond milk, so I only used 1 tbsp of peanut butter because I was afraid it would be overly nutty.  Next time I will try some other reviewers' suggestions to use frozen bananas.  Its a nice way to indulge my chocolate cravings without going overboard.

The chocolate-peanut butter-banana flavors complement each other very well. I prefer ice cold smoothies, so I added 1/2 cup crushed ice. A frozen banana would work just as well.

What a better combo than Banana, PB, & Chocolate!  I like mine icy, so I added ice (~1 cup).  Instead of chocolate syrup, I used 1 Tbl. of Nutella + 1Tbl. cocoa powder.  YUMMY!

Absolutely delicious! I put them in freezer molds and the kids love them. Plus, its a great way to get them a little extra protein. Great as a post workout drink also. I used a gluten free, fat free, sugar free chocolate syrup. I know what you're thinking...gross! No, but really, it was very yummy. And no, splenda or sucrose were not used in the syrup.

Yummy! I substituted the milk with plain/nonfat yogurt. It was good, but very thick. Next time I'll try doing half yogurt/half milk.

Love these - made for the kiddos and I had a little taste.  Will make again and try yogurt as well.
