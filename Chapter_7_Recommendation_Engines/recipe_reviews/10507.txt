Not the recipe I was hoping for.  Soft and cakey, not chewy.  Easy enough to follow but not one to keep.

Very good. They are very close to a brownie. You don't think they're done after 7-9 minutes, but they are after they set. Very chewy. I'm know for my chocolate chip cookies and my husband said these might even be better than those!

really yummy & chocolatey! As per other review, do NOT increase oven temp & bake longer!!! You will burn cookies. I think her oven might be off. I found recipe to be exactly right.

Two stars for this cookie as I was very disappointed in how it baked into a typical flat pancake-like cookie. I have been baking for years and have not seen such a flat cookie recipe in about as many.
  They were hard to remove from my well greased sheet ,even after I let them sit on the sheet for a few minutes to cool off. They are crumbly and not a very solid cookie at all.
   On a positive note, they are a very tasty cookie. I won't be making these again. sorry, just not happy at all with these.

Absolutely heavenly. They are not only soft, but they have this melt-in-your-mouth texture. They were all gobbled up within a few hours of my making them - a huge hit with all my picky brothers and sisters! Tomorrow is my eldest brother's birthday (he's away attending college) and this is what I am sending him in the mail - I'm sure he'll love them as much as we al at home do!!

These are great brownie-cookies.  Followed recipe with one exception:  one cup of chocolate chips is enough for me.  To dress them up for a Christmas party, add a little pink peppermint frosting & crushed candy canes.

This is a very good cookie. Very much like a brownie. However, I had to increase the baking time to 11 minutes and increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees. I will probably make them again, as my family really liked them!

These are absolutely yum.  I used butter-flavored shortening (all I had on-hand) and I added Nestle's mint-and-chocolate swirled chips to them which made them pretty and Christmasy.  I did not add nuts because they're going to be gifts and you never know, with nuts.

Wanted to say that the photo on this recipe does not reflect the true brownie-ish color these cookies have.  The photo makes them look sort of golden but they're truly brown like brownies.

I agree with everyone saying "don't monkey with the temp or time in the oven."  They'll come out of the oven puffy like gingerbread cookies but let them rest and they flatten out and have a lovely final appearance.

My hubby and kids absolutely love these, but I didn't think they were chocolatey enough. It took almost twice the time for them to cook. Maybe it's my oven. They also didn't spread like most cookies do when they bake and came out very dense. Maybe I did something wrong. Will try again, but next time will melt some chips and add it to the mix. May also substitute butter for 1/2 of the shortening next time. Hubby and kids thank you, Rosina.

I think this is a GREAT chocolate cookie.  I made some adjustments -- used butter instead of shortening, increased to 1/2 tsp baking soda and added 1/2 tsp baking powder.  (A recommendation that had been made earlier).  I also used a mix of semisweet chocolate and peanut butter chips and did not add walnuts.    Definitely done in 7-9 minutes to keep them soft and chewy.    Brought them to the office and they were gone in a flash.  Would be great with a mint chocolate chip, or crushed peppermint as well.    I have a new cookie in my Christmas collection!

This recipe turned out great. DEFINITELY take the advice of others who used 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder in place of the 1/4 teaspoon baking soda. I even changed the recipe to 28 servings, so it said 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. I used 3/4 teaspoon baking soda and 3/4 teaspoon baking powder - PERFECT!  Also, make sure and put the dough in the fridge for about 5-10 minutes before baking. This is with all cookies. The colder the dough before placing them on the baking sheet, the better.

Excellent recipe; however, I found it strange that this called for so little baking soda and no baking powder when they are soft & chewy cookies - I used 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 baking soda instead of 1/4 and the texture was absolutely divine. Thanks Rosina!

These cookies turned out great!  The dough wasn't very pleasant tasting (for those who like to dip a finger or two in it to test), so the recipe is deceiving!  Delicious outcome!

I will use the recipe for sure.  Always worried about high altitude but it did just fine.  I will probably cut back on the brown sugar and maybe add some instant coffee to bump up the chocolate flavor but all in all this one is awesome.  So for all of you high altitude bakers, this one works without adjustments.

I bombed on another recipe and looked for a saving grace and this recipe was it. The cookies were more than what I expected and super easy especially since it was my second try at baking cookies.

This is an unbelievable recipe.  If you like chocolate...you won't be able to stop eating these.  Soft, pleasantly chocolately, and chewy is the name of the game for these great treats.

These are Absolutely Wonderful. Didn't have regular shortning, use butter flavored instead with no problem. Someone mentioned the batter not "lickable" & my son agrees but OH MY GOSH what a great little cookie!

I have to bake Gluten Free for my son and now I am trying to look for casein free too for my friends. When I found this recipe I was thrilled. I used a gluten free flour mix for the regular flour and added 1 teaspoon of xanthan. I also left out the chips and nuts. Voila, a GFCF chewy chocolate cookie that tastes great.

Great cookie! Only change I made was to do 1/2 tsp Baking Soda and 1/2 tsp Baking Powder as other reviews suggested and they turned out soft and chewy just as promised.

I loved these! Very tasty, but I would agree that you must bake them the full 9 minutes, although all ovens vary,and I tend to make larger cookies, but 7 minutes they were still doughy, and 9 they were perfect. They taste like brownies, and I added chopped roasted almonds. Delicious!

This recipe made some super tasty cookies! I didn't have the chocolate chips but they were kind of perfect that way. My partner was craving cookies and these hit the spot. I baked a batch at 9 mins and also at 10. I think the 10 min were perfect, still chewy and soft but held together better but I bet it depends on your oven, I think mine runs slightly cool/uneven.

Amazing cookies! They were so chocolaty, chewy, and yummy! To avoid having a 100% chocolate cookie, I substituted the chocolate chips with toffee bits and it was so good!! Would love to make these cookies again!! :)

My chocolate chips didn't melt at all, which made them weird and crunchy. And my cookies were very cakey. I am probably doing something wrong because even when using butterscotch morsels they do not melt. However everyone else seemed to like them.

My husband loves these! Made the recipe exactly as posted (minus the nuts) and they turned out great. Baked for 8 minutes and although they did not look like they were done, they were. Very soft and chewy. Definitely a keeper.

I love these cookies, they melt in your mouth. I found them a perfect combination of brownie and cookie. I used a half a cup of cane sugar because my brown sugar was a solid block and I had a hard time chipping away enough to make a cup and a half. I wil be making these again for sure.

This was definately not the type of cookie I wanted.  The taste was pretty good, but the texture was way off, I thought.  I chose this recipe because I wanted a chewy cookie, but instead I got cake-like cookie.  I would suggest re-naming this recipe to something other than Chewy Chocolate Cookies.  My search for a good chewy cookie continues!

I am watching my calories, so I made these cookies with a low cal margarine and they were still fantastic!  I was able to cut them back to 190 calories per serving.

If you are a chocolate lover, these have a rich chocolate flavor, and you will love them!  However, These cookies were too much chocolate for me.  My husband loved them.  If I make these again, I will only be adding 1 cup of chocolate chips,  or  just omit the chocolate chips.   As for baking - I had to bake these for the full 9 minutes.

This is the exact texture I have been looking for!! YUM. Very chocolatey, the way i like them.  A little hard to get off the baking sheet but after a little work with the spatula they came off all in one piece.  I used about half a cup of trail mix (peanuts, almonds, cashews and walnuts) in place of just walnuts, worked nicely. Only used 1 cup of the cho chips, will up the trail mix by another 1/2 cup next time.  Thanks for the recipe!! They will become a regular in my household.

These cookies were good.  The only problem I had with them is that after I put them away, they all crumbled!  So not very chewy, but soft and chocolately.
