I made it for mother's day breakfast and my mom was very impressed.  Dividing the dough into equal portions by using a scale really pays off.

Rating is based on my 1st attempt as the recipe stated. I decided to give it one more shot, using my experience to guide me, & was not disappointed. I made these using all WHITE whole wheat flour& 2T "vital wheat gluten". I have found from many years of baking w/ww flour that almost any yeast bread recipe that uses egg (i.e. challah, rolls etc.) will convert cup for cup from white to wheat & still be light/fluffy, others may need tweaking, or the addition of some white flour.  The dough was still quite wet so I added a more flour (1/4c). I used smart balance oil instead of butter in both parts of the recipe (butter was frozen, didn't feel it was worth the trouble for such a smll amt).  I didn't worry about this in the bread part, since I always use oil in lieu of butter in my yeast breads, but was concerned if it would affect taste for the dipping part, it didn't (only need 2-3T oil for dipping). I used 2T honey for the sugar in the bread part of the recipe (something else I always do, dealing w/whole wheat breads; the honey/oil combo keep my wheat breads nice and moist), but I still used (BRWN)sugar for dipping (doubled this amt to 6T; the 1st time I made this 3 wasn't enough). Made the pieces smaller this time (35-40 instead of 20) because w/my whole wheat monkey bread, I find  it this gives each bite flavor, or else some bites just taste like bread. I let it rise on the counter for 35min, then covered, put in fridge until am. Only took about 20-22 min,so watch your time.

Not worth making again! I ran into a few problems with the recipe. First, after it went through the dough cycle the dough was too wet to form into balls. It was such a MESS and has to be the stickiest dough I have ever worked with. I had no choice but to add a little flour to get it to hold ANY shape. I added some flour and worked it in just trying to salvage it. As another reviewer stated, there was too much butter and not enough sugar to roll the balls in. You probably need about half the amount of butter and twice the amount of sugar. And lastly, there was not enough orange juice listed for the glaze. After mixing the powdered sugar and the orange juice it was still powder-y. The presentation was very pretty. It had a litte hint of orange, but not enough sweetness. The texture was off but I'm sure that had something to do with me having to add flour after the dough cycle. I think the concept is a great one but this recipe needs a lot of tweaking! I was really hopeful, having orange trees and wanting ways to use the bounty.

This was delicous!  I have a group of SAHM who come over once a week for coffee and a pastry for breakfast.  This was an instant hit (note, I made these the night before, because they do take some time)  I store them in a empty coffee can, lined with tin foil (my grandmother's trick) and they were soft and fresh the next morning.  I plan to make up several of these, and freeze them for the coming holiday season.

Delicious!  My two year old and four year old had fun helping me roll up the little balls of dough.

I subbed out 1 cup of white flour for whole wheat and used a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon to roll the little balls of dough in.  I also added orange rind to the glaze.

I will make this again for sure.

I made this when I had friends round for coffee. I didn't use the glaze. I also used a brown sugar and cinnamon mix to dip the dough in instead of white sugar. My friends really enjoyed this. Many Thanks.

These were nice and light.  We're not big icing fans so we left it off, but there wasn't enough sugar in the dough for our taste.  I'll definately make them again and just add more sugar.  I was making this for breakfast, so I prepared it the night before and left it in the bundt pan to rise overnight in the fridge, covered in plastic wrap.

Even with orange rind, orange flavoring, and orange juice these were still not quite oragie flavored, I think ill add the glaze, and see what happens. Certainly good for breakfast, and awesome with some ground clove and ginger for a little extra something! Would make again for sure! Also works fine in a circular pan if you dont have a bundt.

There is wayyy too little flour in this recipe. After going through the dough cycle in my bread machine, the "dough" looked more like batter. I ended up adding about 1/2 c plus a few tablespoons of flour to get it to the proper consistency.   It still wasn't pliable enough to roll in the butter and sugar, so I skipped the butter, gently patted into sugar, then dropped the balls into a 9" square pan. I mixed the butter with a little bit of brown sugar and sprinkled on top.   After adding the extra flour, it came out pretty good. The orange flavor is really nice.   For the topping, I mixed about 1/2 c of powdered sugar with a little bit of milk and a bit of almond extract and drizzled it on top.   If you make this recipe, make sure you have extra flour because you will need it.  I'll make it again!!

Lovely bread using a flip-book method.  Replaced it with lemon and poppyseed, which I loved.  Only wished I'd had used brown sugar instead of white.

I wass looking for a different recipie and this one was on the opening page.  Since I love monkey bread, I wrote this one down and made it the same day.  I had to make it again the next day because it disapeared.  I followed the recipie as is exept for the zest.  I had orange juice only and it turned out amazing.  For something extra, I melted some chocolate and we dipped the pieces in it.  W O W!!!  Thanks for the recipie.  I will be making it again.

I am only taking off a star because of the recipe needing 1/4 more flour, but other than that I would give this recipe 10 stars. The flavor is amazing. I could have eaten the entire thing last night even after eater dinner. A total hit in my home. I only altered rolling it in brown sugar verses white, and I also used more brown sugar that the recipe states!!

Yummy!!!  Looked and smelled so good right out of the oven, we could hardly wait to eat them!  Very nice and light.  Next time I may divide the dough into smaller balls; also note that it took less butter and much more sugar for me to roll the balls in.

Great idea. However, I noticed dough was not balling up in the dough cycle. I kept adding flour until a nice ball was formed. It is easy to eyeball and fix, by adding flour to dough while mixing in bread machine. I also used more sugar and butter to dip the dough in, but that was personal taste.

I made a few adjustments. This is a new favourite. I don't have a bread machine, so I used a stand mixer to mix and knead the dough. I used the zest from one large orange and may use a bit more next time. I pureed the pulp and juice of the orange to add to the dough. I needed to add more flour than the recipe called for. I skipped the glaze but added a bit more butter and brown sugar to create a sauce in the tin. It came out soft, light and bursting with flavour!

Tasted wonderful!  I baked it in an empty cookie tin lined with parchment paper, and it looked great when it came out.  After storing them in the cookie tin overnight, they were still soft and fresh the next day.  I had very many compliments and I will definitely use this recipe again...

I was hunting for something that was fast and easy to take to a dinner party and found this recipe.  It was a big hit at the party.  It's sweet orange flavor was the topic of conversation as it complimented the fresh green salad made with dried cherries, walnuts, and mandarin oranges.
