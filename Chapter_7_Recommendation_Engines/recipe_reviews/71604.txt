I bought some of these in our grocery store bakery and wanted to make them myself.  I used smaller (approx 5 in. diameter by 1 in. thick) pieces of the dough cut into pie wedges for nice bite-sized pieces.  There was way too much baking powder in this recipe, making it taste 'salty' and not enough sugar or lemon flavor (and I followed the recipe exactly).  I will probably try this recipe again, but with more lemon zest and sugar; less baking powder.  Consistency was good and it was relatively easy to make and has some healthy ingredients too.

Delicious with a bit of apricot jam and cold class of milk! I followed other raters' suggestions and added more lemon zest (full lemon's worth) and less baking soda (3 teaspoons only) and it was just right.

Mmmm.  These were delicious! I put in a tad bit more lemon zest, and added about a third teaspoon of butter flavoring.  From now on I'll add about 1/2 T more lemon zest.

These were good....even though I changed it just a wee bit.
I didn't have oat flour, but had 1 1/2 cups Kamut flour to use up and added 1/2 cup of spelt flour to make 2 cups.
I also used soya and added vinegar to 'make' buttermilk. I then added 1/2 tsp. of lemon extract for more lemon flavour and more poppyseeds, just cus' I can never get ewnough!
Lastly I sprinkled a little raw sugar on top before going into the oven. I needed to cook these for closer to 17 minutes.

These are so good!  Easy to make and just about perfect and what a great basic recipe to play with for different flavors.  I added extract to this, only used 3 teaspoons of baking powder, used brown sugar instead of white and it needed a lot more buttermilk, like double.  I just used the buttermilk until slightly moist and still crumbly.  Mine also took twice the time.  Fantastic after those changes.
