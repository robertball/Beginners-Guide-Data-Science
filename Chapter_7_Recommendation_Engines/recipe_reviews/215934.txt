I wanted to make a pie on the fly and this seemed easy.  I didn't have any limes so used lemon instead.  It was delicious and went fast.  Next time I will change the layering but overall was very good.

This was only the second pie I ever made and turned out great. Fairly easy to make. My family thought it was delicious! I didn't change anything on the recipe. Definately use home-made pie crust it makes all the difference.

this was quite good, we are traditional about our blueberries pies and this one is a keeper, next tho, I would blend the almonds and the cream cheese together first, then spread it :)
