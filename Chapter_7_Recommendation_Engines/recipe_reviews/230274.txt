Made this recipe for Christmas dinner and the family was pleased. I did not cook the ingredients for the brine. Instead, I placed all ingredients in a pot of water covering the pork tenderloin. I also used fresh thyme instead of dry.  I brined it for 24 hours. After I discarded the brine water, I placed the pork tenderloin in a roasting pan. I then rubbed sage, pepper, and rosemary on it,  then followed the rest of the directions to cook the tenderloin.  The results were great.  The tenderloin was flavorful, the stuffing mixture complimented the flavors of the meat well, and it was an easy recipe to make. I highly recommend this recipe to everyone.

Followed the recipe to the letter and glad I did.  The brine brought both tenderness and flavor to the roast, and the stuffing complemented the pork very well.  My time got away from me, and the roast should have come out of the oven just a little sooner (typically, I take it out at 145, but it was 154 this time), but it still was fabulous.    Never thought about this until well into cooking, but in the future, I'll add a little water or white wine to the pan, so I'll be able to make a nice pan sauce while the roast is resting...just too late today.  Lovely dish with lovely presentation, nice enough to serve to company.

Wow, this was great! I added the 1 T goat cheese and about 2 T port wine cheese and 2 apples to the stuffing. I poured in about 1/4 c apple cider and 1/4 c sherry into the pan and basted the pork 2-3 times. Took it out at 142 and covered for 20 minutes - perfect!

My family loved this dish! The meat was tender, moist, and savory. I used a Lite salt substitute for the brine and thought it came out a little too salty for my tastes, but everybody else thought it was fine. Next time I will use half of the salt.

I substituted 1 tbs balsamic vinegar for all the salt in the brine.  I added fresh minced garlic to my shallots along with 1/2 cup dry sherry wine... I added green onions  and arugula to my stuffing. Next time i would let the apples
Cook down in the dry sherry until nearly soft before adding minced shallots/garlic ! This recipe was incredible and easy ! I also used feta crumbles and freshly grated parmesan cheeses instead of the goat cheese ! So so good

I followed the recipe. but brined for two days. too salty  perhaps if I had brined the recommended time,the brown sugar didn't do anything.

The brine is perfect!  I used a different stuffing, but the brine is the key to juicy, moist meat!

This was the first time I'd cooked a pork loin roast. I made this for my church's New Years Eve pot luck. I followed the directions and brined for 18 hours.  There was a lot of excess stuffing. I just put what did not fit in the roast on top of it and all went into the oven. 

The meat came out tender. the excess stuffing did not burn as I was afraid it might. The aromas and the flavor of both the meat and stuffing were divine. The presentation was also festive and impressive.  Everyone thought I was some kind of expert chef.  They will never know how easy this recipe actually is.

There are a lot of drippings on the bottom of the roasting pot. Someone here mentioned making a gravy with them. That would be my first choice, but I did not have time.  Instead I am going to use them in a bean soup tomorrow, new years day.  

This is a recipe I will be making again.

Made it just as the recipe called for - very easy - and it tasted great.  Will definitely make again.

Good! Left out cheese due to our needs, but this was tasty and will make again. I dry brined in the fridge. (Salted & Brown sugared the pork, wrap in plastic wrap, then foil overnight.)

I grilled it on the Weber BBQ. Unfortunately it dried out quite a bit. Perhaps I should have gone higher heat than 300 degrees. There was way too much filling for a 5 Lbs roast. The filling was like spinach dip.

I would have given it less stars but my family is not a fan of pork so I have to take their critique with a grain of salt. Although, I do like pork and still found this bland and tasteless.

This recipe is very delicious. I made it for the first time for New Year's and again for Easter. I used feta cheese instead of goat cheese, and since my family, except for my husband, likes feta, I used half of a container-about four ounces. Great!
