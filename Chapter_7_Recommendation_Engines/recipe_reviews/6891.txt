The 1st time I made this I, too, thought it was a bit dry so the 2nd time time I made it, I used 2C of apples. Also added 1/2TSP cloves and 1/2TSP cinnamon to give it some kick.  Don't know if it's just my oven, but had to bake for about 70mins with the extra apples.  Absolutely delicious with some butter and a cup of hot tea. Thanks, Carol for a great recipe!!

Excellent quick bread, but we did make some changes after reading the other reviews. We (my son and I made this for a math class on fractions) added 2 c. of shredded, unpeeled apples instead of 1 c., changed the butter to 1/2 c. of vegetable oil, and added 1 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. cloves. Ended up baking for 70 minutes. It was a great success in his class, as well as with the family (we sneaked a piece!) Very moist and delicious... I'll make this one again!

I made a few changes to this recipe.  1) It needs spice!  So I added 1/2 tsp. ground cloves.  I think cinnamon would work well, too.  2) The dry ingredients can be beaten together with the wet ingredients - it's not necessary to stir them (until moistened).  3) The apple peel can be left on.  I grated 4 apples with a cheese grater, and I left the peels on the apples.  This adds a little bit of extra fiber to the bread, and doesn't change the consistency.  4) When I tried to remove the bread from the pan after 10 minutes of cooling, part of the bottom fell apart.  I waited longer for the second loaf, and it didn't fall apart.  With these changes, I will use this recipe again and again!  It's fabulous!

Didn't have walnuts so I used almonds and it was pretty good.  Mine came out a little dry due to pan choice but hey it was good.
As of 9/27/17 I have still been making this recipe however instead of sugar I use unsweetened apple sauce in equal amounts. Makes it moist but not too moist. Also if you don't eat it all in one sitting like what usually happens at my house, cut and serve from the middle out and when you remove a piece push it back together. Keeping the butts of the bread on helps seal the moisture in a little longer.

It is way too dry. I should have used milk like someone suggested. I used half the sugar since I don't like bread too sweet and doubled apples. The sweetness was just right. I will use apple sauce instead of butter and milk to make it more moist.

I found this loaf to be pretty uninteresting. tasted kindof like banana bread with no bananas, perhaps the 1 cup of apples I used just wasn't enough. It didn't seem too dry, though it did brown much quicker than the recipe suggested (could just be my oven). If I make this again, I will definitely follow the suggestions of other reviewers and double the apples (maybe use granny smiths for a stronger flavor-- i used one big fuji), and add cinnamon and cloves to the batter. It's a nice basic recipe though, just needs some tweaking.

Much too dry - wouldn't make again.  Find breads made with oil or apple sauce are moister.

excellent loaf, I made a few changes though. Like other reviews I doubled the apples. I used 3/4cup of brown sugar instead of white, oil in place of butter and added 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 allspice. Once loaf was cooled it was very moist and a bit hit among friends.

This bread had very good flavor but was a little dry.  If I make it again I will use oil in place of butter.  You really don't need to add any extra spices if you want the pure taste of apples.

Excellent! I actually cut this recipe out from the packaging of a Baker's Secret loaf pan. I added 1/2 cup of milk as I found the batter was very dry, and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup (used brown sugar). Came out wonderfully light and tasty!

Man is this good. Do add the tspn of cinnamon. Do increase the amount of apple. I used something like 2 cups. The older the better as the juice adds moisture to the loaf (which it needs from what I see in the other reviews). A definite keeper.

I admit I was very nervous when I was finished with the dough. I was expecting a typical sweet bread dough which is usually very runny. So when this dough was finished and had the consistency of cookie dough, I had to re-read the recipe to make sure it was correct. I baked it anyways and found that it made a terrific sweet bread. I had to bake it for about 1 hour and 10 minutes, and let it cool completely before I took it out of the pan, but it turned out delicious. Don't be discouraged by it's dense, thick dough as it bakes down nicely. I used butter rather than margarine (don't like the plastic stuff!) and followed the directions to a T. The bread had a nice texture. The top crust was beautiful and bumpy; it wasn't a smooth crust on top like most, but added wonderful texture and beautiful presentation. I will definitely make this one again. By the way, one med-large apple yielded a cup of shredded apple. I used a Jonagold apple, but any crisp, tart apple would be excellent!

Not great. The flavor was very bland, but the bread was moist. Definitely needs some cinnamon. Looking for a different Apple Bread recipe.

I doubled this recipe and used chopped fresh apple rather than shredding it. The mix was quite dry so I just use some milk to bring it together. It made 3 good sized loaves and when sprinkled with a generous amount of raw sugar and cinnamon, they came out moist with a crunchy topping. And absolute hit at the picnic!

So I'm kind if cheating buy this is the recipe I decided to use and then last minute I saw the Dutch apple loaf recipe from this site which was the same except with the addition of 1/4 cup buttermilk a streusel topping  and 2 cups apple. I also used a tsp baking soda and powder. And added a little bit more apple than 2 cups and this was sooooo fantastic and extremely moist and soft. Thanks for the great base! Oo ps add cinnamon to the bread mixture and maybe even a fourth cup of chocolate chips, delicious:)

As written the batter comes out very thick like cookie dough.  I didn't change a thing but I did cook in an 8" square pan (same volume).  Flavor was good- we all thought it tasted like a dry banana bread.  I'd like to try again with changes.

I liked this bread. Mine turned out close to the picture. I shredded granny smiths and used near two cups instead of one. I also left the peels on...dough appeared little dry but came out nice and moist. I wouldn't change much, maybe add a little spice like cinnamon but the flavor by itself is good.

I should have just stuck to the original recipe!  I tried a little of the reviewer's hints and came out with a thicker not-so-sweet bread.  One good thing, I doubled the apples and the bread held together just fine.

This is a pretty good recipe.  One thing I tried is I put a bit of apple sauce in the mix and added a touch of cinnamon.  It came out much more apple-y.  To balance the moisture, I suggest adding one tablespoon more of flour for every 1/3 c of apple sauce.  Overall not a bad recipe though.

Great loaf!  I wanted a bread, not a cake, so I halved the sugar (I used brown instead of white) and it was plenty sweet.  The teaspoon of cinnamon I added was a bit too much for the apple flavor, so I'll use 1/2 tsp. next time.  I'll probably increase the amount of fruit or add applesauce like others suggested to make it a bit moister next time.

This is a great base-recipe to add your own touches too!  Mine came out really yummy, and great as a quick breakfast grab.   My modifications were: - Cut back sugar to 3/4 cup - Added 1 tbsp cinnamon, 1/t tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp cardamom - Added 1/4 cup minced kumquats (pits removed), and 1 tbsp water. (I have a kumquat tree and love them. But some orange zest would probably serve a similar flavor touch) - Substituted 1/2 cup of the white flour with Gram (chickpea) flour for body and nutrition - Left out the nuts (personal preference)  Thanks for the moisture tips of the other reviews... I think my added kumquats and water covered it.

I just made this and at first shot it turned out well.  Like others, I added a few things: cinnamon, and milk (because the batter was a little dry).  I also only used 1/2 the sugar.  Next time I will also add cloves for a more spiced taste.

Delish!  I made some changes as suggested by other reviews.  I used more apples, leaving the peels on to shred.  I used oil, added cinnamon too, and substituted pecans for walnuts because that was what I had on hand.  I also used 1 cup whole wheat flour with 1 cup white all purpose.   I really liked the flavor and the wholesome taste to it.  This is going to be a staple in our house.  Yum yum!

IT'S A MUST!!!!!!!Like always i add ingredients and left some. Exquisite with crystalized ginger, raisins(OMG),cloves,nutmeg,cinnamon. Add milk cause the texture was to dry for my taste about 3 table spoon. Ikept the pele on the apple, faster and healthier. You really need 2 cups of apple but dont cut them to small because you will lose the taste.

This is an excellent recipe.  I changed it slightly based on other reviews I made the following substitutions, 1/2C cinnamon applesauce instead of butter, 2 cups shredded apple and 2/3C brown sugar instead of 1C white sugar.  It was moist and flavorful and I'll definetely make it again.

Bland and rubbery, was exactly how I would describe this bread. Maybe it was the apples I used (golden delicious- shredded) maybe I over-stirred the batter but this was no good!!   If you want to make a great quick bread make Janet's rich banana bread from this site, it's soooooooo good. I might try that recipe with apples instead of bananas?

Excellent recipe!  Especially fond of it was my 11-year old who strongly dislikes apples!  The only doctoring I did was "a touch of cinnamon, a handful of raisans and substituted 1/2 cup of oatmeal for flour."  THANKS Carol!

Very good bread, but somewhat dry.  I did add some spices to it.  This recipe is a keeper, but I'll increase the amount of apples and spices next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I found this recipe and decided to try it. Some of the reviews said it was dry and needed cinnamon so I added 4 ozs. of applesauce, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. It was delicious.  Next time I may put a cinnamon streusel topping on it before I bake it. Great autumn bread. GAIL B

This recipe is delicious. I've been using it for a couple years for our family's annual Apple Fest, we bake the loaves in mini ceramic loaf pans I find at Michael's for $1 every fall. 

As suggested in other reviews, for 12 servings I add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp cloves. I also add a crumble to the top because the kids love making it--butter, a bit of flour, brown sugar, a bit of cinnamon.

12 servings makes 3 mini loaf pans. The mini loaves typically take about 30 minutes to bake in my oven.

Based on others' suggestions, I used 2 cups of apples, replaced the butter with equal part canola oil, and added 1 tsp of cinnamon as well as a dash of cloves.  If you decide to use MacIntosh apples, you can get away with using less oil because these apples break down easily when cooked and will provide enough moisture (especially if using 2 cups).  However, in that case, you might want to use a mix of apples; otherwise, you won't get the apple chunks that make the loaf so good.  I baked it for 70 minutes.  Amazing!

Very good and moist!  I did what other reviewers suggested, added 2C of apples, 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/2 ground cinnamon.  Baked for 60 minutes.  However, 1/2 tsp cloves is too strong for me, so next time I reduced it to 1/4 tsp. Thanks for the recipe!

delicious!  super moist! I followed others suggestions with adding cinnamon and nutmeg and more apples. I also used applesauce instead of butter.  It made enough for four mini loaves.  great way to use apples that are a bit past their prime.  a keeper recipe.

This was great, but I did make a few changes because of what others said and to make it lower fat. First I added a splash (maybe 1/4cup) of milk. Then I did 1/4 cup of butter and 1 cup of apple butter (I did not have any applesauce but I had a few homemade apple butters in the pantry). Left everything else the same. Tasted like apple pie in a bread!

I followed all the instructions, no more, except replacing walnuts with pecans. It turned out perfect and with a wonderfully crunchy crust.   It was perfectly moist. I did not find it dry at all, like some users are saying.

A fantastic recipe.  My whole family loved it!  I am the master chef because of this killer apple loaf.  I made some changes to the base recipe, however.

For one I didn't put any nuts in the loaf.  What a horrible way to muck something great up.  I did, however, put a layer of oats on the top of the mush in the bread pan before baking.  This gave the finished loaf a beautiful and tasty crunchy oat topping.  Also, I added nutmeg and cinnamon to the mixture.  Really, how can you make an apply anything with out them?  I wonder...

In conclusion you made me a hero.  Thank you for this godly recipe.  I will make it again, and again, and again, and again, and...

This loaf is so tasty - what a perfect fall treat! I took the suggestions of others and used 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves which tasted good, but very reminiscent of McDonald's apple pie filling.  The next time I used 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg instead of the cloves and loved it - a lot more subtle but still spiced enough.  I think it would be really bland without it!  I also left out the walnuts because I don't like nuts in my bread.  The apples were hard to shred with an cheese grater, because they were so juicy, I had to really press hard to get good shreds.  I left the apple peel on for fiber, but will try shredding with my Cuisinart next time (update - did this and it shredded in like 3 seconds!).  I also added about 1 teaspoon lemon juice to keep the apples from turning brown.  Be careful about including too much juice from the apples - my loaf crumbled when I cut it.  I also added 2 cups of granny smith apples (about 3 apples)and have tried this with Fuji apples with great results both times.  I did trim the sugar down to 1/2 a cup and I'm glad I did - it's still pretty sweet (I might even take it down to 1/4 cup when apples are in season).  And I love that this recipe doesn't have brown sugar, so substituting for my diabetic father will be a cinch.  So so good!

Yum! I added a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, and used 2 cups of apples, shredding one and chunking the other. These alterations required a longer baking time. This loaf is so-o-o good and I'll definitely be making it again.

Excellent! I also increased the apples (2 cups) and added a  1/2 cup of applesauce along with the butter, to increase moisture. I made 5 small loaf pans half with walnuts half without. Both were equally as good. I also sprinkled the tops with a cinnamon sugar mixture~ Yum-oh! I thought they were very moist and had alot of flavor! Oh yeah, I also added a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and maybe an 1/8 tsp. of cloves!

I used pecans instead of walnuts.  The loaf  was brown  and crunchy on top and moist inside.  My  boyfriend told
me this was a keeper and to make it again.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup maybe a slight bit more. I used 2 apples for a little more apple flavor.  It was still a 
delicate apple flavor. Thanks Carol.

This is a delicious bread with a subtle apple flavor. I tried other apple breads that turned out very blah, but my entire family enjoyed this one! The only change I made was to omit the walnuts. This one's a keeper!

I am a college student who likes to bake for friends.  I took out the nuts and one egg from this recipie, used brown sugar, cinammon, nutmeg, soy milk and some apricot juice, and my loaves have such a delicious taste.  I highly recommend add ins.   Oh, and I used wheat flour, which makes for a more robust flavor as well - and wheat germ - healthier!  Thanks for the recipie!

This is wonderful. I gave this in small loaves to co-workers for Christmas and everyone loved it. I did add a teaspoon of cinamon and increased the nuts though.

This was good the only reason for only four stars is because I did alter it a bit.  I used two cups of shredded apple, added cinnamon and used applesauce instead of butter.   It turned out amazing.  I also had to bake it for 70 minute as some of the other reviews stated.

I found this recipe to be pretty tasteless and dry. I suppose with a few tweaks, it could be a fairly decent recipe but, all in all, I'm really not that committed.

I didn't dare to follow the recipe since most of you said that the loaf was dry, so here are some changes I made:  I reduced baking soda to 1/4 instead of 1/2, I added 1/2 cup milk and baked the cake on 165 for 55 minutes.   I turned out really good.

This was a terrible cake--no flavor at all!!!  I read the reviews before I made it and added two cups of grated apples instead of the one.  Even without the reviews I would have known one cup of apples to two cups of flour was not sufficiant.  Two cups didn't help--also added 1-1/2 tsps. cinnamon, but this cake was still tasteless.  I shredded the recipe!!!!

These changes make the bread great!  Use 2 cups apple pulp, instead of shredded apples.  Add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp cloves.  Use 3/4 cup applesauce instead of butter.

The taste was very good on this bread.  I made several additions to the recipe including milk, spices and doubled the amount of apple (chopped).  It came out a wee bit dry even though the cooking time was spot on.  I will try adding a bit more milk next time.

I liked it, it was quick and easy!! The only thing is that you must add some spice, I added cloves and cinnamon. I also put raisins in. but over all it was good I'm sure it wold have been bland with no spices :)

Great bread! I added another cup of apples, 3/4 cup of raisins, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Instead of 1 cup of white sugar I changed it to 3/4 white and 1/4 brown. It was very good. I will be making this again!

I was craving apples one day (pregnant lady!) and bought a whole bunch of apples! Well, after about a week, I was tired of apples and had a couple left over I wanted to put to good use instead of waiting till they went bad and tossing them in the bin. After reading some of the reviews, I, too, made a couple additions. I added a little bit of milk, a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg and my apples after shredded were about 2 cups intead of 1. Also, after mixing everything together I realized my mother in law still had my loaf pans so I made muffins instead. We loved them! Not dry at all and they were a huge hit that morning at breakfast! My daughter, who is 7, loves to help in the kitchen and they were so easy and a great activity for us to do together! I will surely make this recipe again. It is a geat way to use up a couple apples and I also want to try using different types of apples too!(I used 1 fuji and 1 red delicious)Thank you for the great recipe!

Added 1 tsp of cinnamon and left the skin on the apples for more fiber as one reviewer suggested. This turned out good but slightly dry even with constant eye on the time/bread. But overall it is good. Would make again.

Disasterous. I don't know what I did wrong. Came it extremely dry and crumbly. I even baked it for less time than suggested. Didn't have any apple flavor either. Really screwed this one up.

This was amazing!  I've never had apple bread before, but this was great.  Since my fiance is allergic to banana bread (my OLD favorite), this will be made for Sunday breakfasts from now on.  Even my 16 month old toddler loved it!  (that's a HUGE compliment) I did add 1/2 tsp cloves, 3/4 tsp cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg, and used two cups of apples.  The cooking time was perfect, even with the extra apples.  Thanks a bunch for this delicious recipe!

With the following changes - this recipe received great reviews from family.  I added 2 1/2 cups of finely chopped apples, 1/2 tsp of cloves, and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  Another reviewer made the comment that it took 70 minutes to bake with these changes - I'm glad I was watching the oven because mine was perfect after being in the oven just under 50 minutes.

Delicious!  I've made this several times.  I use 2 cups apples (Granny Smith) and add dashes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom to my batter.  I also cut the sugar back to 1/2-3/4 cups depending on how sweet/tart the apples are.

This was very good.  I did make some changes that others suggested.  I changed some of the butter to applesauce, used 1/2 brown sugar and added cinnamon.  It doesn't have a strong apple flavor but it's good and even better the next day.

Not too bad.  My kids, ages 2 and 4, helped make this.  We added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp. ground cloves.  It seemed awfully dry when we were ready to "pour" it into our pans, but it worked.  We made 4 small loaves and baked them for about 35 minutes.  They devoured theirs and gave some to elderly friends.

I followed all the recomendations and so on and it was fine, but it didn't taste like apples at all.  The best part was the top with the light cin-sugar topping. I wouldn't make it again.

This is a great receipe, I was getting tried of apple crisp, and apple butter.  
I made mini muffins, baked them for 20 mins, I added 2 cups of apples instead of 1, and I added 2 tsp of cinnamon.  They tasted great.  I would make them again.

Nice recipe for apple bread - not too sweet, not too dense, just pleasant.  The kind of thing that goes great with coffee or tea.  I used Splenda instead of regular sugar, and it came out great.  I also made muffins from this recipe, which were moist, delightful, and held together well so you don't have to worry about lots of crumbs (cook time about 35 minutes for muffins).  The taste is not particularly apple-y, but overall a very nice recipe.

This wasn't too exciting.  The apples are very difficult to taste, and we thought it looked, smelled and kind of tasted like corn bread!

The loaf turned out well -- it's not overly sweet nor is it overly flavorful, but it's still good.  If I were to make it again, I'd probably add another 1/2 cup or so of the shredded apples.  Nevertheless, it's one of those good, wholesome breads that just about anyone would like!

I am a little late writing this review. I have been making this recipe for the past 2 years and have never changed a single thing. It's perfect the way it is. I have always used Granny Smith apples and that's probably what balances out the sugar called for. Thanks Carol. It's my husband's favorite weekend breakfast.

This cake was really moist and yummy.  However, I shouldn't have listened to other reviewers about adding extra spices, because in the end, the spices over-powered the apple flavor and it didn't taste like apples at all.  *sigh*

Added 2 cans of apples, and way to sweet for my taste. Also tasted more like a cobble than a cake. For something easy to make and share I would make this again.

I also added a diced apple, left out the nuts and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top.    Put them in muffins tins and had a delicious treat! Definitely more of a cake than bread, but that's what I prefer.

This was really good. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1 cup diced apples. I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, but it was still a bit too sweet for me. I might go down to 1/2 cup next time. I'll definitely be making this again! Also, I used pecans instead of walnuts.

I'm giving it 4 stars as written, but 5 with the many modifications that I made. First off, as everyone suggested, this needs about 1/4-1/2 C of either applesauce or milk (I added 1/3 C milk). It also needs spices--I added 1/2 teaspoon each cloves and cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg. I also followed previous suggestions and upped the apples--2 large apples (about 3 cups), diced but with the peel left on. The Gala apples I used worked just fine, but perhaps Granny Smith or Rome Beauty would have been better. I used sour cream instead of butter (to cut the fat intake, but still keep it it moist and rich), and 1/4 C of honey, 1/2 C of splenda granular instead of the 1 C of sugar (we have a diabetic in the family). We're low on walnuts, so I only used a little over 1/4 C, but that was enough. Someone suggested a streudal topping. I found it easier to combine 1 tablespoon white sugar with 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and sprinkle on top of the muffins just before baking--left a nice crusty top. Finally, I baked this in 6 texas-sized muffin tins for 30 minutes...delicious!

This was a great loaf!!  I did take some advice like doubling the amount of apple, adding a little bit of cinnamon, and cutting the butter in half and the only thing I found was that it was a little dry without the extra butter so I replaced that with 1/4 cup milk.  Turned out beautifully.  Will definitely make again.

Very good muffins.  Very moist and have a nice texture.  I cut the butter in half, used all whole wheat flour, added an extra cup of apple, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp cloves.  Baked in muffin tins for 20 minutes.

I wonder if I did something wrong myself since this was dry and had little apple taste. I even doubled the amount of apples and added the spices that the previous reviewers recommended. I would not make this again.

I made this recipe because of the high ratings, but was sorely disappointed.  It had no apple flavor whatsoever.  My family thought it was walnut bread.  Adding spices and more apple might make a difference.

This bread rose nicely and tasted fine, but it was nothing special.  I found that the middle was still a bit wet when the outside was brown and crusty.

Overall this has a good taste, however I found it to be a little dry.  Like some of the other reviews I also added cinnamon and if I made this again I would use more apples for more moisture.

What a treat! I followed the recipe, but I didn't have walnuts on hand. I found this recipe because I needed to use up 2 red apples before they went bad. Takes no time to prepare and no time to eat up. We absolutely love this recipe. Now part of the family menu. Thank you for sharing.

This was lovely thanks, and so easy to make.  Like some of the others I added a bit of mixed spice and maybe next time I would not add so much sugar, as I felt it was a bit too sweet.

I made this Apple Loaf and it was perfect. Following suggestions of previous reviewers I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ground cloves. Other changes: I  used two large apples peeled and cut into small pieces and I used oil instead of butter (due to allergy). Will definitely add to my recipe collection.

I read the other reviews before I made this recipe. I decided to use four apples.  I added half a teaspoon of nutmeg and one teaspoon of cinnamon and I substituted half a cup of oil for the half cup of butter. I also used brown sugar in place of the white sugar. The mixture seemed slightly dry at the end so I added a splash of milk as well. It turned out very good and I will be making it again.  :)

Like others suggested, I doubled the apples and added cinnamon and cloves.  I also substituted light olive oil for half the butter to lighten the saturated fat content.  We all enjoyed it and I'll make it again with the modifications.

I made it for the first time with suggested changes - oil instead of butter, 2 c shredded apple instead of 1 c, added 1tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp cloves.  
The cloves were a bit strong, next time I'll cut back to 1/4 tsp.  Loaf was moist and tasty, cooked in 60 mins.  I'll definitely make this one again.

Very good recipe. I use this recipe as a base for all of my loaves and just change the primary ingredient. I've used zucchini, pumpkin, carrot, bananas, pears, strawberries, and blueberries in place of the apples in the past and it always turns out great. You've just got to adjust the spices based on the new ingredient. I also tend to recommend doubling the amount of fruit when making this recipe. 

Another thing I sometimes do is to take chunks of apple or pear (when using those in the recipe) along with the shredded. It makes a nice texture change in the mouth feel of the loaf as you eat it, and gives you little pockets of sweetness in the loaf as well.

After reading the reviews, I modified the recipe by adding 2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp ground cloves.  I used gala apples because they're very juicy. The result was delicious.

Made this earlier today. I made a few adjustments though; replacing the butter w/applesauce, doubling the amount of apples,and adding a pinch of nutmeg and a tsp of cinnamon to the recipe. The family enjoyed it . Next time I might add raisins n nuts.For those who have tried this recipe but  it stuck to your pan, try lightly flouring your pan after greasing            it.. guaranteed your loaf will not stick!

This is really good. I did change a few things, used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup canola oil instead of butter so I could reduce the fat and added raisins instead of nuts. I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and added cinnamon and half the salt. Also added 2 cups apples. I will make this again soon!

I have made this recipe once before. I used 1 cup of apples as indicated. I added 2 tsp of cinnamon,and 1/4 tsp of ginger.Added a box of vanilla pudding mix and it was delicious. Am making it again at this very moment. Varied a bit also. Added 2 cups of shredded apples,lemon pudding mix, and we'll see how it tastes in 1 hour

Loved this recipe.  Wasn't dry at all for us, but we used almost two cups of shredded apples.  Otherwise we stayed with the recipe 100%. My family is already begging for more.  Going to try doubling it next time.

Great recipe! I made the following changes after reading the other reviews. I used 1/2c white sugar with 1/2c of brown sugar. I substituted Crisco oil for the butter.  I used 1.5 cups of Macintosh apple. Next time, I'll add a dash of cinnamon and I'll consider adding a bit of milk. All in all, a fantastic loaf!

This was a pretty good bread recipe.  I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves for some extra flavor as other had mention.  I think I over cooked it, because it was a little dry.  Next, time I would decrease the cooking time by about 10 minutes.

I enjoyed this recipe, however i too made some changes.I added 1 teaspoon of cinnomin,and 1/2 cup of dried cranberries, and substituded chopped almonds for the walnuts. The batter did look somewhat dry as i poured it into the loaf pan, however it was light and fluffy and not at all dry. It was a delicious recipe that was easy to make! Great for the children's lunch box!

Tasty, but not spectacular.  Like other reviewers, I love my baking spices so I added more cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger.  Just didn't have the emphasis on the apples that I was looking for.  This recipe doubled well.

I added 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp mace and 1/2 tsp ginger to spice this up a bit and it came out good.  The texture was not what I expected, but I used very tart and very hard granny smith apples, so I think next time I'll try some better apples.

With fall at hand and my apple tree full of apples that I couldn't possibly all eat (and tired of apple pies), I needed a recipe to put those apples in. Made this loaf, but with a few changes. Like most other reviews, used 2 cups of apples instead of the called for 1. Also added cinnamon (sorry no measuring, just sprinkled until I felt there was enough), raisins, and 1/2 cup of light vanilla soy milk (lactose intolerance) because the dough looked a little too dry. Baked for 75 min. Pretty good, I'd say. 

Addition: The second time I made this, I made it without the raisins and walnuts (I made the first loaf for my dad) and less soy milk. But I added a crumb top made from 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour and 3 TBSP. butter mixed/crumbled together. Delicious!

Very good! I used 4 apples which made about 2 cups of shredded apples and I added cinnamon because it goes so well with apples. The bread is very moist and has an excellent flavor. I would make this over banana bread. Yum!

This was very easy and very good.  I doubled the recipe, so I used 4 apples and a cup of applesauce with cinnamon instead of butter or adding extra cinnamon.  I also let it bake 60 minutes and cool completely.  It made two beautiful and delicious loaves.

Wonderful recipe.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon to spice it up a bit.  The smell welcomed my family when they came home and treated their tastebuds after dinner with a delicious dessert topped with a heaping dollop of Cool Whip.

Mm, yummy. Substituted Splenda for sugar, apple sauce for half the butter and margarine for the other half, and ommitted the nuts. It still turned out great and extremely moist. Thanks.

This was a delicous treat. I did double the amount of apples and used 2 cups... And I didnt have the 9x5 inch loaf pan, my loaf pan is 8x5, which worked out just as good. My family ate it for dessert with coffee one night after a barbeque and they ALL loved it. IT was gone within the night. THANKS!!

I use all kinds of different apples and cut them into chunks so there is a nice texture and medley of colors. Makes a great gift for holidays.

I made the Apple Loaf tonight and LOVED IT.  I followed other reviews and added 1 generous cup of chopped and shredded apples, along with 1/2 tsp of cloves and cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup. I did not add milk as others suggested - the apples that I had were juicy enough (Honeycrisp). The Apple Loaf was fantastic and you even get a exta bonus when you bake it - the house smells great! I will definitely make this again!

not quite a four, but just isn't a five.  I doubled the recipie.  It made 3 - 9x7 loaves.  I used 2 apples shredded and 2 apples chopped(minus a few pieces which my son kept swiping.)I also added cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.  I can't recall if that was in the original recipie or not, but I added 1 tsp. or cinnamon and cloves and 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg.  Delicious and very flavorful.

Moist & delicious.  I made it as stated except for adding an extra apple. Grating the apple is better than cubing...now I do this for all of my apple bread recipes. Will definitely make this again.

I have looked at the ratings and have decided that i must have done something wrong whilst cooking as everyone gives it such a high rating. It tasted pretty dry, no apple taste at all. I would call it a walnut loaf as thats all i could taste.
If this was named walnut oaf i would give it 4 stars. very disappointed!

This recipe turned out great. I loved the flavor. I used the same recipe and instead of making the loaf I made them into muffins. They were a big hit at my Brunch. Everyone wanted the recipe!

I made these into muffins for breakfast. They were small, but good to say the least.  They were especially easy, and lasted quite a while! I plan on making these for my family when I get home from college.

SO GOOD! More apples and less sugar/butter. The other reviews said it was a bit dry but I didn't think so at all. YUM!

Great bread, I was a bit hesitant at the texture of my dough when I put it in the oven to bake, but when it was done it was beautiful and gone before I knew it.   For an extra touch I spread butter on the top and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar when it first comes out of the oven.. yum--
