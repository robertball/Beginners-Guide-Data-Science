I doubled this recipe, an also decided to work with what I had, and from knowing how my mother cooked stews (we are Spanish)...so I subbed capers for green olives, added about 6 oz red wine, 1 cup beef broth , added about a teaspoon of cumin, about 4 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley, 1 tablespoon of paprika, 2 teaspoons of oregano, and a shot of olive oil. I sauteed a small chopped green bell pepper with the onion and garlic.  Also I did not use sofrito...basically the onions, green pepper, and garlic are already sofrito so that's kind of redundant. Anyway...Amazing!!

12.9.15   I'm not a huge fan of slow cooking, but beef stew is one meal that always works well in a slow cooker.  At 4 hours on low,  neither the meat nor the potatoes were tender, so I bumped up the temperature to high, and cooked for an additional 1-1/2 hours.  Followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of adding a good splash of red wine and using halved olives WITH  pimientos.   We enjoyed this stew with yellow rice and black beans.

I made this today, and absolutely loved it.  It is one of the tastiest stews I have ever cooked!  I did tweak it a bit..Upon suggestions from some of the critiques, I browned the meat in a packet of Sazon and a shake or two of Adobo.  When adding to the slow cooker, I added 12 oz. red wine and 6 oz. beef broth.  I also added a couple of spoonfuls of chicken boullion to enhance the flavor.  Served with white rice.  To die for!

I followed the suggestions of everyone else and did 4 hours on low and then 1 and a half on high. I actually doubled the recipe with no real issues that I could see. I did add some of the actual liquid from the jar of olives to it. I thought it made it even better. Reminded me of a slightly spicy picadillo. My husband and son very much enjoyed it.

Delicious! Only thing I did different was tossed the raw beef in adobo saffron spices before browning it. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. Definitely a new family favorite! Even my 2 year old loves it!

This Is a great dish. I had never heard of sofrito, and living in the wilds of rural Wales I was unable to buy a jar. So I did a bit of research and made my own: onions, garlic, bell peppers, olives, corridanda, oregano, bay leaves and salt and pepper.  The addition of olives really gave the stew a fantastic flavour.  (I understand that salt wouldn't have been used traditionally, but I like salt!). Thank you

I made this today but I did not use a crockpot, nor does this dish call for one, rather it uses the term slow cooker which can mean braising.  I did mine in a cast iron pan with a tight fitting lid, followed the recipe exactly.  I usually do the first time  I make a dish from Allrecipes.  Next time I will make a couple of minor changes to suit, but all in all, this was a very good recipe.
After browning my meat on the stove top I put the pan in the oven at 250 for about 3.5 hours, took it out and it was ready to serve, meat tender and potatoe's done.

I followed the recipe and some of the suggestions from others, like browning the meat with the sazon seasoning (i made it myself since my store didnt carry it) and I added red wine, worcestershire and beef broth to the mix and it STILL tasted like something was missing. I cooked it on high for 4 hours and the potatoes didn't soften, I had to take them all out and microwave them for 15 minutes.  Flavor was seriously lacking, super disappointed - the recipe sounded so delicious!

Wow I am so impressed! We have made a couple crock pot meals this past week and they were disappointing. But this one made up for them both! I followed the recipe to a T expect for adding about a cup extra or potatoes and extra garlic. I served it over white rice with fresh cilantro sprinkled on top. Can't wait to make it again! Another recipe for the books!

This is good, though I feel the Rotel overpowers the dish. It gives it a kick, but that can be done with other spices. Next time I'll just use a can of tomatoes so the Latin seasonings shine through.

I love this recipe!! I always double it because I have a husband and 6 children to feed. I add a Cup of Goya liquid spice called Mojo Criollo which gives it an  amazing kick! I make my own Sofrito. I added the recipe below. I add carrots sometimes and I always use Adobo seasoning rather than salt. I put a packet of sazon, Onion powder and Garlic powder directly on the meat before browning it in a little spanish olive oil. I also cook the potatoes and carrots in the drippings from the meat for about 6 minutes after I’ve removed the meat and onions from the skillet. I put it all in the crock pot on medium or low depending on how long I plan to let it cook. Tonight I put it on low and I won’t open it again til 5 am -right before I wake up my children for school. Oh I also skip the olives because my children and I are not fans but I put three tbsp of the juice from the olives in the crock pot. It really does make a difference!! If you want to see Sofrito made go to youtube and search “The Freakin Rican Restuarant” He has a video in English making Sofrito. I love his food!!!

Sofrito
Ingredients
1 green bell pepper chopped
1 tbs Ajies dulce, seeded
1 large onion, peeled and chopped
10 cloves of garlic peeled
1 bunch of cilantro

Wash everything and put it all in a blender or food processor. Should be slightly chunky not watery. If you need to add a little water you can but I never do. I put mine in ice cube trays but I also have some in a mason jar in the fridge too. I use it almo

when ever I make beef stew I always use a chuck roast and cut it myself. It is always tender with good flavor.

Tasty! Ditto on the comments on the time. Needed the 1 1/2 hrs on high to soften the potatoes. Will make again.

This was amazing!  I couldn't find sofrito so I substituted a jar of Chile Verde salsa. After seeing reviews about cooking time, I cooked it on high for 1 hour and then on low for 3.5 hours. We ate it over Mexican rice  - definitely making again! Super quick to throw together and delicious flavors!

This was delicious.  The only change I made was to add 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce. This is going into our regular rotation. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I've been making stew in basically the same manner for over 40 years. Pretty darned good stuff I'll admit, but when I saw this recipe I decided to give it a try.  I'm really glad that I did! Now, it annoys me when someone reviews "their" recipe (theirs because they changed so many ingredients  or cooking methods that it's unrecognizable) and gives the original marks off because it wasn't to their liking or worse, says it's a five. That being said, yes, I did change one or two minor things due to circumstances. I had no diced tomatoes so I used a 14.5oz can of stewed tomatoes that I had on hand. That might have given it a slightly sweeter taste but probably offset any acidity that the tomatoes may have had and I think complemented it very well.  I also used 2lbs. of beef rather than 1 because apparently I can't read. LOL! I coated the beef with my own adobo mix and browned it before putting it into the crock pot. Lastly, I added a healthy dose of chopped carrots because, well, it's stew. This ended up being perhaps the best damned stew that I have ever made. I just had the last cupful over a baked potato for lunch. To die for!
Oh, as others have said, 4 hours on low was not long enough. I cut the beef and vegetables into smaller than normal chunks, about an inch or so. It still took about 6 hours for the vegetables to get tender. Even so they were still firm and not mushy. This is by no way a criticism, just guidance for someone looking for a "quick" slow cooker recipe.

I would make it again.  I would be careful not to overcook.  I made my own Sofrito which was worth it but chopped too finely and it dissolved.  I did add carrots.  Do not put olives in until you're ready to serve because they dissolved too.

Spanish? Sazón? Since when do they use sazón in Spain?
This dish is far away from being Spanish or even close.  
I don't think proportions are accurate either.  Tried to make it but it lacked flavor and moisture.

The recipe overall is pretty good but needed more salt!  It's a bit bland.  The meat and potatoes come out very tender.  I did not fry the meat, I added it to crockpot and seasoned it with seasoned salt, black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  I also added 26 Ozs total of chopped Pomi tomatoes, 1.5 lbs stew meat and 4 cups chopped russet potatoes.  I cooked for 7 hours on low.  Be sure to cut potatoes into 1/2 inch or smaller cubes if cooking 7 hours or less or they may not come out tender enough.

I read other reviews, made my own sofrito from recipe on this site and Sazon seasoning as well. Tossed meat with 2t Sazon seasoning and browned beef.  Added beef  broth, red wine and chicken bullion as others suggested. Cooked on low for 71/2 hours and thickened sauce a bit. Got rave reviews.  Really good will make again.

Instead of sofrito (couldn't find it) I used Goya Recaito Culantro and pureed a tomato and added that to the mix. Put the stew on some saffron yellow rice and this recipe is tremendously flavorful. Can't wait to make it again already.

This is a fabulous stew and was perfect for serving during the Blizzard of 2016!  I doubled the recipe so I would have some left for another dinner. I made my own Sofrito, since I couldn't find it at the store...it was simple to make and is delicious. I did use the Ro-Tel and the stew turned out very spicy. I corrected that by adding some sugar to tame it down and also added about a cup of water. I also added carrots to give it more nutritional value...that made it perfection. My husband couldn't stop raving about how delicious this stew is and thought it was a great departure from ordinary stew. I would give it six stars if another one was available...it's just that good!

This recipe was a 'great idea' starter. I browned the beef, onion and garlic as recommend, added about 1/4 cup red wine, a can of drained and rinsed chick peas, 2 packets of Sazon, cooked for 6.5 hours overall, and served with buttered noodles. Great dinner - enjoy!

The only change I made was to use sliced green olives & pimentos, which i rinsed thoroughly. Like another reviewer, after 4 hours the beef and potatoes weren't tender. Another 1.5 hours on high did the trick.  I served it with black beans and braised brussels sprouts. Overall, I liked the stew. It was different and interesting, but my dislike of olives wasn't diminished by the other flavors. I think if I make it again, I'll try substituting something for the olives -- maybe jarred artichoke hearts.

EXCELLENT!  The list of ingredients and cooking instructions are right to the point.  We love a lot of meat, so I just added more beef.  Highly recommended.

In Spanish we call this dish "Carne Asada"  and it's a favorite among Latin cultures and there are slight differences but all lead to yummy yummy!! It's a great dish for large families and for left overs.....as it tastes even better the next day because the spices are absorbed into the potatoes. I can't wait to cook again. Enjoy!! PS it's a misgiven when we say "Spices" in Latin food that the food is hot....it's only hot if YOU add something hot to it like red pepper or cayenne or jalapeño etc

Love the deep flavors!  The sofrito is a must in my humble opinion, it adds a depth of flavors.  I made it twice and used various exotic olives in the stew.  I use a whole beef roast and then at the end I clean it and put big chunks back in the pot to keep the meat very tender.  I brown the roast in olive oil and  lots of fun seasonings, then put it in the slower cooker.  In the pan I browned the meat I add a little more EVOO and the onions and some garlic.  saute for a couple of minutes then deglaze the pan with red wine (about 1/2 cup).  Add the jar of sofrito to the pan and put about 1/2 cup water in sofrito jar, shake it up and add to the pan, the the can of tomatoes.  Stir everything up and pour over the roast.  Add carrot chunks, potatoes and cook on high for 2 hours then low for 5 more hours.  Very, very flavorful stew.  Kind of exotic tasting.

I  followed the directions and added nothing else to it. Smelt very good cooking but really had no flavor afterwards. Had to cook 5 hours  on low to get the potatoes done. Would really be a great dish if you had children to feed.

I did not like this recipe. I made it according to the directions.
I like spicy and hot but this was neither spicy or hot. It was very acidic with an overpowering flavor of overcooked tomato. It lacked balance.  I hate that I wasted all the ingredients to make this recipe.

I followed some tips from other reviewers, and it turned out great.  I sauteed a green bell pepper with the onion and garlic.  I used capers in place of olives, I added 1/2 cup of beef broth and 1/2 cup of red wine, and 1 teaspoon each of ground cumin, dried oregano, and smoked paprika.  
I used "high" for the first hour, then turned it down to "low" to make sure the potatoes cooked through.  6 hours was plenty of time.  Awesome.

I made this stew following some of the tips in the reviews and it was fantastic. I add a packet of Sazon Goya to the meat and also saute it in some red wine. My second time making it I tried adding some more root vegetables and some capers. Overall great recipe and very flexible.

Spanish Beef Stew is totally fabulous, only mod was adding 1 thin sliced jalapeno, added a bit of bite.  I left overs barely exist and taste a little better next day.  This recepeis is gold star,  sets a new high taste standard for beef stew.  Thanks ever so so much.

This stew is something I will plan to do again soon. I'm on a low carb diet so I substituted cauliflower for the potatoes and also modified the cooking method for my Instant Pot.  (I used Alex's Sofrito recipe.)

No major review or tips here, just a "meh" dish. I know it smelled terrific today while I was away, but I really felt like it lacked - something. I'm a well-seasoned cook, can improvise when it's called for, and should've seen that this needed more - something. But I often get frustrated reading reviews that cooks have tweaked endlessly; sometimes I like to give the original author a chance. But....it needs - something.

The pros: with a Crockpot liner, it's easy to clean up and minimal prep time.  The cons: despite the sofrito and olives, it was surprisingly bland.  No real flavor at all!  I took out of the Crockpot at four hours, and the potatoes were unevenly cooked--some hadn't cooked through yet.  Definitely leave in five hours (or longer) if you make this. I will not make it again.

Sofrito is hard to find so I made my own (used allrecipes for help)  the soup was a bit flavorless at first but by generously adding seasoning to my taste the stew became fragrant and delicious. (Sazon, pepper, chili) Really filling and perfect over rice. Will make this again. :)

This turned out good but not great : (  It seemed to lack flavor and needed more seasonings.  If I made it again, I would up the seasonings.

No changes to speak of. Used all ingredients that it called for plus the sazon seasoning. Used chuck roast instead of stew meat. Always have and always will.  This was really good just sorta lost on the Spanish thing.  Sofrito..Sazon...Olives...The works. Good flavor and depth of flavor. And great color. Guess l will have to eat at a Spanish place to compare.  Worth making again.

I loved this and so did my sister! I did add, and made a few changes. I added carrots, and instead of salt and pepper, I used Adobo w/pepper, and instead of the jar sofrito, I used the frozen Goya sofrito. It goes great over white rice! It was simple to make and very tasty, I'll definitely make it again, and very soon.

I made this for tonights dinner and have to say it was a real success. I used a chicken stock cube to flavour the meat along with a little black pepper whilst browning it. I also added some red wine and some dried pulses  meant for a soup mix and some dried thyme. I then just left it on the auto cook setting. I made it in the morning and left it cooking all day. It was delicious and I could recommend it

Delicious! I had to cook it on low for 8hours instead of 4 and added 1 Tbsp of paprika to give it a little more depth.

My first time cooking a Spanish dish. This was great! Cooked it like the recipe called for. On a cold, winters night, just before a major ice/snow storm hits, it sure warmed the soul. Cook it and enjoy it!

I added carrots, doubled the recipe, and added extra onions. I loved a new twist on an old recipe. It doesn't feel as heavy and caloric as old-fashioned beef stew, which is a plus to me! But I promise, it is still a stick-to-your-ribs kind of meal.

Amazing!  Subbed pork, subbed capers, subbed salsa for sofrito (cantina style), added carrots, added liquid then thickened with cornstarch.  Definitely needs the longer, adjusted cooking time.  Served with rolls. Will definitely make this more than once a year!

This was a very interesting dish, but probably not something I will do again. I did add the Sazon seasoning to the meat, red wine and broth that others suggested. The meat and veg were cooked properly, but still not super tasty.

The flavors were fine, but the timing is way off. I cooked it for hours longer, turned up to high for another hour, and still the potatoes were too hard and the meat was a little tough. I might try this again, but in the Instant Pot.

Really good stew recipe. After comparing other slow cooker beef recipes, I cooked this for about 10 hours on low. Added about 10 oz of beef stock before cooking, and thickened at the end with a little cornstarch slurry. Added a little liquid from the olives and chopped them separately to add at the end individually to allow for some picky kids. Also, instead of a jar of sofrito, used chopped pepper and onion and garlic. The fresh parsley really helps balance the slow cooked flavors, and the olive flavor is delicious. Definitely a keeper.

Apart from having to make my own Sofrito (unable to find in Latin markets in Washington) I made this exactly as written. It was very good, though needed just a little “oomph”.  It might have been my Sofrito recipe.  My husband thought it could have used more olives.  I think fire roasted tomatoes would help.  Great recipe though.  Unique stew that I will definitely make again.

We loved this and will definitely make it again.  However, first we will have leftovers as I made enough for 2 meals! I did make a few changes, based on recommendations here. I added some green pepper to the onion and garlic. The beef I doused with Sazon (1 T. per lb of meat) which I mixed, when I couldn't find it at the store. I then browned the seasoned meat in olive oil. I don't use a slo- cooker, so I simmered it all on the stove for about 3 hours. I added a bit of red wine and kept the green olives which are a perfect accent. Then I served it over yellow rice. Wonderful and very Spanish - much like the Cuban food we enjoy in southern Florida.

I used a sweet yellow onion, 2 cans of diced tomatoes and used an olive pesto instead of the green olives.  It turned out terrific with lots of great sauce and tender beef.

Makes a thick stew full of flavor.  I added a cup of sliced carrots.  My husband loved it.

I followed the recipe eliminating the salt and pepper and using the Sazon.  Turned out great!  I think the next time I will eliminate the potato’s and serve it over rice or noodles.

Delicious! I tripled + the recipe. I used 3.50 lbs of meat. I have 3 hungry guys, and we always like leftovers. The only thing I did different was to cook it on the stove in one large 8 quart pot. Also I seasoned the meat first with 2 pkgs.(envelopes) of the Goya sazon as other viewers suggested. Only used one jar of sofrito, because it has too many additives in the ingredients. Added 1/4 cup of merlot, a cup of cut carrots, 2 sweet green peppers cut up, 1 can of beef broth, 2 cans fire roasted diced tomatoes, 1 can petite diced, and some dried herbs(parsley,oregano, coriander, and extra black pepper. Cooked/simmered covered on the stove 2 hrs. Delish!!! Served over white rice. Whole family loved it! Definitely a keeper!

Love this recipe! Have made it a bunch of times including for Super Bowl last  year and again for  this year. Doubled recipe, used 2 pkgs sazon when browning beef. De-glaced pan w red wine. Don't like the texture of olives but I do toss in about a tablespoon of fresh olive juice (saving the olives for charcuterie). Put beef and veggies- including carrots in crockpot w sofrito, tomotoes and quick shot of evoo.  Cooked on low overnight- wow, house smelled great in the morning! Threw in a bag of frozen corn about an hour before serving. Served w crusty bread and salad but not w rice because of the potatoes. Always a big hit!!!

A little dry, I like a little more sauce, also needed more spice as it was a little bland. Just a little kick would have been great.

Didn't have time to do it in the crock pot. Dredged beef in cornstarch before browning. Needs just a bit more cilantro. I'll probably make my own sofrito next time. Delicious just off the stove, TREMENDOUS the next day. Green olives are a must, a little pepper sauce doesn't hurt. This is a great recipe for people who want to get creative, there is so much you can do with this. Not really a crockpot recipe, do it on the stove.

Was flavorful-but to bland for my liking-I also kicked up the cook time on the slow cooker to high for 3 hours . I would think some crushed red pepper or jalapeño would be a welcome addition. Pretty in a  the bowl. But eating it with gusto would be my preference.

This was pretty tasty and my whole family enjoyed. I seasoned the beef with sazon, adobo, doubled the recipe and threw in a few shakes of pinot grigio. I also cooked in the oven for about 2.5 hours instead of the crockpot. Very yummy.

Wonderful - I only added some Worcestershire Sauce.
Also as I cannot get sofrito in Australia I substituted this with a Hot Salsa Sauce.

Tastes so great the day later, especially with a bold red and a hearty bread and cheese.
Over quinoa - I'll try spanish rice next time..

Family loved it.
Couldn't find sofrito, used a spicy tomato sauce and added diced tomatoes and green chilies. I basically doubled the recipe adding more meat and potatoes,  carrots, and more onions.

Either way, it was a hit. Plus I got lunch the next day!

I cooked potatoes with onion & garlic for a few minutes.  I didn't have time to cook in a slow cooker, so I cooked it on the stove, on low, for about 1 1/2 hours.

I also made some changes to this recipe after reading some of the comments.  I was kinda looking in my pantry to see what I could add.  I doubled the recipe and did two pounds of meat and about 4 medium potatoes.  I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire, one packet of onion soup mix, one cup of water, 4 tablespoons of parsley, one teaspoon of cumin, swapped salt and pepper for two tablespoons of steak seasoning, teaspoon of paprika, about half can of black beans, doubled the diced tomatoes, about half cup of roasted yellow and red peppers and one small can of tomato paste.  I did use the sofrito but I only had half a jar leftover from previous.  I cooked mine for about 5-6 hours on high and the potatoes were fine.  Came out very tasty!

Doubled the ingredients. Made sofrito from scratch. The second day it was incredible. The flavors really came together.  I did add a bit of beef stock. About one cup. Next time i'll add red wine instead.  I got the slow cooker on high for about 45 minutes then 4 hours on low.

I loved this! Was a little skeptical about putting something with potatoes in it over rice, but it worked! I'm adding more olives next time along with some of the olive juice. Each bite with an olive in it was perfect. Other bites I felt like something was missing. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I really liked it.  My only problem?  I bought the wrong meat!  The package of stewing beef I bought didn't specify what type it was.  I followed recipe to the letter and even after several hours of cooking, the meat was not very tender.

This was definitely not the recipes fault.  everything else turned out amazing.

I made this at the firehouse.  They were a little skeptical. I couldn't find soffito at the store so I used italian tomato sauce. It was delicious. I doubled the recipe and 5 men almost finished the whole thing. I think there could be a little more spice to it, but it was perfect by everyone else's standards. A keeper for sure.

This was fantastic. I'm not someone who gives five stars easily but this deserves it. My family are not big beef stew eaters and my teenage boys hate anything made in the crock pot but everyone enjoyed this. I made very minor changes. I only sprinkled a little garlic powder instead of using the cloves. Pure laziness on my part. I didn't bother to sauté the onion first, I just put it in the pot. And I added about half a cup of red wine. I think the wine was important for the moisture. I also used about 1.5 lb of beef instead of 1 and I wouldn't go less than that. Great recipe that was soooo tasty.  Thank you. Edit: I just made this again with the minor changes that I made the first time except that I used fresh garlic and it came out just as good as the first time. Served with jasmine rice. Cooked on high about 3 hours and the meat was tender and potatoes cooked perfectly.

Have been a beef stew afficianado all my life (ninety years) and this was the best ever. The most difficult find was "sofrito" although you listed where it could be purchased they never heard of it. The recipe for sofrito is available on line and so i made out OK. If you like beef stew, this is a marvelous variant and I recommend it highly

This was really good!  I had to order sofrito from amazon because I couldn't find it at either of my two grocery stores.  I also seasoned the beef with sazon as others have recommended.  Very tender beef, very flavorful stew!  I will certainly make this again!

It's very yummy and different. I set the crockpot to 6 hrs and the meat melts in your mounth. The olives sure give it a saltier more vinegar taste. I served it with yellow rice.

I Made it with deer meat, added a jalapeño, could not find sofrito  locally so I used a pasta sauce that was only similar  ingredients low on seasonings. Yummmeroo.

I ate it but my husband did not like it.  It has an unusual flavor. Must be the sofito.  He also did not like the olives in the stew.  He doesn't feel they should be in there.  I won't be making this again.

I made this last night and it was excellent. I used 4 cups of cauliflower instead of potatoes, served over Basmati rice. I couldn't find sofrito at my store, so I ended up using a 28 oz can of Rotel for the diced tomatoes, plus 6 oz of red wine. I browned the meat in Sason as well. I know it sounds as if I really didn't follow the recipe, but that's the beauty of this dish...you can improvise and it'll still come out great. A keeper for sure.

I was really looking forward to eating this. Followed instructions precisely. I was underwhelmed. Too tomato-y for me. If I make it again I would omit the diced tomatoes and add corn or beans. LATER: I added frozen corn to the leftovers, which greatly improved the flavor. I would add another star.

Made this twice and it's now my favorite recipe. Quick to prep and totally delicious. The spicing is perfect but next time I'll add the saffron Althena recommended  to see how that turns out.

The recipe cooked exactly as promised.  The only issue most of us had with it was the spicing took away from the taste of the meat and potatoes.  I'm sure we could try variations on the recipe but there are others out there that would probably be more successful to our taste.

This wasn't bad for something different, but I think I prefer a more traditional beef stew. I'm glad I tried it --nothing ventured, nothing gained! I followed the recipe exactly, and my meat was tender after 5 hours on low.

Excellent stew! Even better the second day. The only thing I did differently was add carrots and about a 1/3 c of red wine. It had just a bit of heat and an amazing variety of flavors that all seemed to meld well. Definitely add the olives, you won't be disappointed.

This was a great stew! Only minor changes using olive oil to brown meat and onions and then deglazing pan with red wine. It took very little time to prepare. I cooked on low for 5 hours.

Nice change from the traditional beef style gravy! I added zucchini and green beans the last hour or so of the cooking time to beef up the nutrition.   I also added half a jalapeño pepper. Next time I'll add a whole one For more heat. I cooked it longer like many other reviewers. Delicious!  This might become a regular beef stew recipe.

I didn't find any real definitive flavor to this dish.  It was tasty and very savory, which I like, but I expected a little more bold flavor from the sofrito.  This was good, but far from my favorite beef stew recipe.

Very good recipe I just added two jalapeño peppers (extra hot) I don't recommend this addition if you don't like it hot.

I loved the taste of this recipe!  However, I found that there really should be more meat in it and maybe even a little rice as well.  Otherwise, you end up wasting the sauce or just eating it by itself.  I doubled it up because I like to prep meals for the week and it freezes and reheats well.

Was very easy to make. It's more italian than spanish, reminded me of cacciatore. Followed directions but added carrots for that real beef stew feel. It is delicious.  Thank you for posting this.

I can give to this recipe only 5 stars.  The reason is delicious taste, tender beef and potatoes. I will keep this recipe in my cookery book.  I made it low heat for 5 hours :)
Thanks a lot!

I have not made this in a slow cooker. I make mine in a pressure cooker. It's way faster and just as hardy. I add two bay leaves.

This was better then expected; I didn't have the diced tomatoes, but even just having the Sofrito flavored enough; didn't miss the tomatoes. The meat came out perfect; tender and tasty and it was a very simple dinner to make as well.  I wil surely make it again!
