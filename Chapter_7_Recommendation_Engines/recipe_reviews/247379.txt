I added more garlic and used a bit of milk no cream...tasted great, I did not take the charred bits of roasted veggies either it gave it a distinct roasted taste and was super!! The second time I made it I added red/green/yellow peppers....just as good as the first time around!

This soup is great! I love the flavor roasting adds, as well as the creaminess from the potatoes. I used a bit more garlic (8 cloves) and chicken broth, because that's what I had.

I have never had a carrot soup before.  This recipe caught my eye since we are trying to eat more health and I love roasted veggies. I didn't have veggie broth, so I used chicken broth instead. To help blend the soup, I used my large blender after the boil and that worked great. the roasted flavor definitely comes through. I made sure the carrots were starting to get brown before continuing the recipe. It took an extra 20 minutes at 425°, but well worth the extra time.

Next time I will back off on the salt, but this recipe is excellent. Roasting the vegetables makes all the difference.

I make a lot of soups but dont know why I never  made a soup with roasted carrots?  This was wonderful.. the roastiness of the carrots really enhanced the carrot soup.   This is my favorite carrot soup. My only change was to use greek yogurt instead of light cream.  I may have used more stock as well.. just added it to get the consistency I iked

I’m not supposed to comment on this because I changed this so much but it was just so good and I just wanted to send out a high five to the creator. My changes included swapping out the potato for half a head of cauliflower just because I had it and needed to use it for something. Then at the end I realized I was out of veggie or chicken stock so I had to use either beef or onion. I chose beef as those dry onion soup mixes are so salty and I had already added a fair amount of salt to the veggies. My body just can’t take the salt. Lastly, I used milk instead of cream because I didn’t have any cream. The final result was light and delicious. My husband even asked for a second bowl.

Amazing soup. I made it with one potato and one sweet potato as I only had one regular one. No cream needed. Once blended well it's so creamy!

I added a little more garlic and herbs de Provence and used whole milk instead of cream. It was an excellent substantial dinner entre for us.

So good! I made a half recipe, added more broth, and eliminated cream, for my own taste. It is a very filling lunch!

The garlic is crucial if you'd like a soup with some character.

I didn’t have any brown bits to scrape but I sprayed the pan. Nothing browned in the oven and was in for 50 min. with a stir at 25. I saved out some chunks of vegetables before puréeing it because my husband didn’t want to eat baby food. I also had to add cooked sage sausage which was good and would recommend to non vegetarians . Flavor with herbs de Provence was very good but I also added a bit more thyme.

I used coconut milk instead of cream. I put in more onion and potatoes. Yes, I would make it again!
