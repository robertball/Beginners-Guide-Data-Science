This was terrific. I had only red cooking wine, and it worked just fine. I also used spaghettini instead of angel hair pasta, added dried thyme to the veal coating, and added mushrooms to the sauce.

This recipe was really good, except it was missing a really important ingredient.  I added a teaspoon of sea salt, and that did the trick!

Very very good.  Meat was extremely tender, and it goes very well with penne pasta with olive oil and grated Parmesan.  Wonderful recipe.

We really liked the flavor of this recipe and it was very easy. Next time I would use more wine to have more sauce for the angel hair pasta.

I used some of the hints of previous reviewers (dried thyme in flour for dredging, and adding mushrooms); but I used turkey cutlets instead of veal.  No one at my house was any the wiser!! And it's much cheaper.

This recipe was very good.  I gave it 4 stars because I think it is missing some ingredients.  I had to make it three times before I felt it was as good as other reviews.  The first time I made it it was definately missing something, but I felt like it was a great recipe, so I played around with it.  It DEFINATELY needs some salt, even just 1 tsp will do, but is bland without it.  Also, rather than garnishing with thyme, I added it to the flour, it gave the veal a better flavor.  I still felt like it needed something, and ended up adding fresh basil when I added the other veggies.  That did the trick.  I will probably continue to work with it, it is a great basic recipe.

Super simple to make and boyfriend absolutely loved it.  Instead of angel hair pasta, we used the pasta that looks like a small bird's nest and this made the dish look very elegant. This dish is very tasty!  I too recommend adding thyme to the flour mixture.

This recipe is so easy and yet it's so tasty.  I used chicken broth instead of wine and got great results.  My whole family loves this meal!
