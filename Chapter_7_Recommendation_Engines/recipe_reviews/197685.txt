This recipe is AWESOME. I have lived in Dubai for two years where there is plenty of authentic Indian food, so I can testify that this Ras Malai is indeed very authentic and of great flavour. I used part skim ricotta cheese but it has not affected the result. This dessert is truly outstanding. One tip is to take the cheese balls out when they are warm since mine broke a little bit after they are cold.

This is a great alternative to the traditional way of making ras malai, I actually find this much yummier :) I use a 9x9 baking pan and cut the cheese into squares after baking and cooling. I find that this makes the cheese less likely to look brown-ish when in the syrup. For the syrup, I use 2 cans of evaporated milk and some whole milk. Just possible suggestions!

I absolutely love this dessert when I go out for Indian food and was so happy to find a recipe I could make at home.  Unfortunately, I didn't have the saffron or cardamom on me, as it was a spontaneous decision to make it.  The cardamom would have really made it better, but they were still delicious!  I made mine with rose water (it says optional, but I say mandatory!) and with Stevia instead of sugar (1 tsp Stevia = 1 cup sugar).  Yum!!

great dish.  i found the milk sauce to be a bit too sugary; 3/4 c sugar is more than enough to flavor the sauce. otherwise this recipe is perfect, and really does taste like authentic ras malai.  thanks so much for a great recipe!

This was just beautiful. The texture, aroma, taste  and presentation were stunning. I added an organic rose petal to each serving. Probably a bit too elegant for my simple dinner of "Kofta Kebabs" and "Naan" but I really didn't care!

I was so excited about making this due to the rave reviews.  However, it was really disappointing.  None of my guests liked it.  I have to say that the sauce was delicious! And you could for sure get away with making half the sauce recipe unless you plan on drinking it.  The cheese dumplings/cakes just weren't that good...kind of dry.  Perhaps overcooked them.  On goes my search for a good and easy dessert that incorporates rose water :(

Love it!  Ras Malai has always been one of my favorite desserts, and I was happy to find out that it's so easy to make!  I followed the recipe exactly (except I left out the saffron) and it came out wonderfully.  Definitely add the rosewater.

The texture is all wrong on the actual patties.  The malai (cream) bath is not far off but I do not recommend this recipe.

This is a great recipe. I followed as it is just left out the rose water. This recipe is perfect as it is to provide truly authentic Indian themed dessert. I took a suggestion from someone else and took the cheese balls out of the pan while they were still a little warm so they didn't break like their's did. Very tasty, I give it 5 stars for a job well done.

I just made this recipe and it's pretty good. I had some trouble getting the cheese balls out of the muffin tin. It also seemed like there was quite a bit of fluid left over, so I used it for rice pudding!
