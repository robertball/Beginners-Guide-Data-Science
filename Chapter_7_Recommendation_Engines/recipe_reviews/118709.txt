very good, I used yellow bell peppers in place of the yellow squash and I also used a pineapple salsa from Trader Joes.  We loved all the vegetables, and I liked how easy the meal came together!

This had a good flavor. I used scallops and halibut steaks. The scallops worked out much better since they stayed whole. I found that the fish flaked apart and became mushy in the wok. Other than that it was easy. If I make this again I will use scallops and shrimp instead of fish

Good for a quick weeknight meal. I used sole fillets, one each zucchini & summer squash, little less mushrooms, opted to use Italian seasoning instead the cumin, about a cup of salsa, half a fresh tomato, 4 cloves of garlic and fresh parsley for the cilantro. I seasoned the fish with lemon pepper and seafood/fish seasoning. Served it over orzo. Added Parmesan on top and turned it into an Italian inspired meal.

Very interesting blend. I prefer 1 1/2 pounds of fish to the recipe since whitefish is so insubstantial, but all in all a good dish.

I used talipia and served over orzo pasta.  This was really good and really easy.  Great summer dish!

This was most definitely a successful recipe.  My nature, however, prevents me from following any recipe exactly, so I made a few changes.  I added some more farmer's market veggies (onions, carrots, bell peppers) & some ginger to the stirfry.  I also marinated the halibut in a balsamic/honey/white miso marinade before stirfrying it with some garlic & ginger.  I used chunky peach salsa.  Both my boyfriend & myself were satisfied with the results.

Delicious!  This dish is perfect without the mushrooms (my boyfriend's allergic, we made it without).  Also, I added lime as the review below suggests, which added a great acidic kick.  With the right salsa, this dish is a winner - and super healthy!

This was great! Both my boyfriend and I loved it!  He went back for seconds and thirds.  I will definitely make this again.  The only change I made was to squeeze a half a lime over the fish before cooking and the other half over the veggies.

This is my new favorite way to eat fish.  It's super easy to make.  The yellow squash with zucchini combined with salsa make for an exquisite and healthy meal.  I served it with brown rice.

I enjoyed the flavors in this. I added a few more veggies than the recipe called for and used cod instead of hailbut. I served this over pasta which I think wasn't the right choice. It was mildly unsettling eating what my brain thought of as mexican fish spaghetti! I'll try this over some brown rice I think when I have the leftovers tomorrow.

Made it with swordfish (need a sturdy fish that doesn't flake easily) and Spike's salsa (the best salsa EVER!) The salsa makes this dish.

Great healthy way to prepare fish when you don't have a grill!  Served with a vegetable orzo dish and asparagus for a really great meal.

This meal was excellent.  You can make it according to the level of spicey you like with the salsa you choose.  We served over orzo pasta and with a green salad. No leftovers in this house!
