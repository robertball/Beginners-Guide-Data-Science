These were great. A huge hit with my family. I melted a 1lb. dark chocolate Hershey bar to dip the truffles in - a little time-consuming, but worth the effort. I also added about 1 Tbsp. whipping cream to the recipe to make the "inside" creamier and replaced the vanilla with raspberry extract. They turned out terrific!

These are delicious.  Instead of using a spoon, I put toothpicks in them and it works a lot better for dipping and eating.

These were so yummy! My three year old daughter and I made these for my husband for Father's Day. She loved rolling them in our toppings. I used flake coconut, cocoa, graham crackers, and crushed pecans. He loved them! The coconut and pecan truffles were his favorite. I will be making these again.

An excellent kid-friendly recipe.  Delicious and easy. Three kids ranging from 6-13 years enjoyed rolling and coating these truffles in cocoa or icing sugar.

This recipe was perfect. the cream cheese made it real fast to harden and added a little tang to the chocolate. for the toppings I used cocoa(of course), ground pecans, unsweetened coconut flakes and ground candied orange peel.

A little rich for my tastes, so I made some modifications. First, I doubled the cream cheese. It makes more and gives them a smoother truffle taste. I divided the batch (after adding chocolate, before vanilla) and put them in tupperware containers. Then let each person mix in a torani syrup of their choice (mint, raspberry, and irish cream for this batch). We mixed them up with a fork, added a little extra powdered sugar to the mint (the syrup was pretty weak) and then fridged them for an hour. Rolled them in hot cocoa powder, powdered sugar, etc. When I'm out of syrup, I roll them in flavored 'fancy' cocoas (for like .40 cents at winco). Tasty! Fun group baking project.

More like chocolate candy than chocolate.  Way to sweet for my taste.  At least the candies that it made held their shape, but IMHO it wasn't worth the work.

Rich and fun to make. We rolled the truffles in rainbow sprinkles, coconut, nuts, and mini chocolate chips. Time consuming to make...so plan on making a morning or afternoon of this recipe!

oh my goodness!!  these turned out perfect!  they are wonderful in taste and texture and appearance.  i gave them as a birthday gift to a friend and they looked so impressive in the tiny paper cups with all the varieties.  my husband & i liked the coconut the best but they were ALL good.  i was worried when i first started to roll them into balls, because the dough was kind of wet & sticky, but it didn't take them long to harden into tasty perfection.  can you tell i'm excited about these?!?  lol.

Excellent recipe and very easy.  I would suggest only refrigerating it for an hour.  I kept it in the fridge for 3 hours and it was very hard to work with and not pliable.  Other than that, it was a great recipe.  I did use Bakers chocolate bars, and used 8 semisweet and 4 bittersweet and everyone thought it was perfect.  Thanks for submitting.

I spread this between cake layers for a truffle cake, and also use white chocolate with 1 t real vanilla extract. Very easy to work with and it takes well to a variety of different flavorings.

Very good receipe! Instead of rolling them in cocoa powder, try Nestle Hot Cocoa mix!!! It coats great and gives a better flavor! If you like the look of dipped truffles, here's a tip I learned after years of making truffles...use a plastic fork and break out the middle two prongs. It makes dipping way easier and the truffles just slide off on top wax paper!!

I have to say, these are GOOD!!!!!! really easy and taste wonderful. I wanted to make something nice and yummy for my daughter's teacher for Xmas with the home made touch and these were the perfect gift. I covered them with cocoa, sugar, pecans, coconut and sprinkles by daughter request :) and just put them on a Xmas plate with colorful paper. Pretty sure she will love them.  thanks for the recipe. I added a teaspoon of rum flavoring plus the vanilla and they came out so good.

I have made these multiple times and they are always a hit.  I usually roll half in shredded coconut and half in cocoa powder (mixed with powdered sugar to cut the bitterness) and they instantly disappear.  You should note, however, that the texture of these is more like fudge than a smooth truffle.

I made these with my 6th and 7th grade students and it was a bit too sticky and wouldn't stay in a ball that well; but they loved making them for Valentine's Day.

I made these on a whim for a Christmas party because I had the ingredients and it looked easy.  It's not easy, but actually rather entertaining to make.  I personally did not care for them at all, but I was teh ONLY one.  Everyone RAVED about them and I have had requests every since.  They are very rich, but apparently that's what people like! :)

Texture is way too thick to be a truffle and are extremely rich! Too much work for a poor tasting truffle.
