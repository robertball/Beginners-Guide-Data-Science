With the exception of the cayenne pepper, this is the traditional pasta with garlic and olive oil I grew up with in my Italian family. If anything, we add a bit of crushed red pepper flakes to taste, but it is just as traditional and tasty without. This is the Italian version of buttered noodles--and it's darn good. Also delicious with a sprinkle of grated fresh Parmesan or Romano cheese.

Now THIS is the way to do Olio ;)

The only thing I changed is using whole cloves of garlic rather than chopped garlic - it is more "traditional" that way.

As for cooking the garlic for 10-15 minutes - you are normally supposed to discard the (whole clove of) garlic after you have cooked it in the oil.  The reason for doing this is that the oil becomes infused with the garlic flavour...

However, since this version uses chopped garlic instead of whole cloves - I would cook it for 3-5 minutes instead.

Not a good kid recipe because of the spicy red pepper flakes (but omit them and the kids will eat this up).  I've added quartered canned artichokes and black olives.  Also try shaped pasta, adds a little excitement to the meal.  Very delicious!!

This is a great side dish, but frankly I could eat it as a main dish all by itself because it's just that good.  I topped it with a bit of parmesan and it was perfect!

AMAZING recipe!! My husband and I enjoyed this dish. It was easy to cook with the time crunch I was in and the spices gave it the "kick" I like in sauces. DON'T change a thing!! It's very good and if you use the right pasta, it's healthy as well.

This was fantastic!  I however added a lot more garlic than the recipe called for.  I also added a handfull of whole garlic cloves.  It took about 7 minutes longer to cook with the whole garlic cloves.  Next time i make this i will also try to add some fresh steamed veggies to the mix!

I loved it!  I added extra garlic and sprinkled grated parmesan cheese on top.  Yum!  I served it with broccoli, which was very good with it.

I really liked this dish.  I will make it a lot when it is just me for dinner since it is so easy to adjust for just one person.  My husband didn't care for it, but he can't stand not having meat for dinner.
The taste is really very mild and subtle.

Delicious! I sauteed garlic italian sausage.. then added the rest of the ingredients, except for the butter (since the sausage created it's own fat). I used more garlic and added sea salt! After plated, I drizzled a smidge extra virgin olive oil over the top and some fresh grated parmesan! YUMMY!!!!!

I have seen many Italian cooks on tv make this dish and have always wanted to try it.  I modified the dish only slightly by adding some fresh basil in with the flat leaf parsley, and it was delicious....even though DH overcooked the garlic!  It wasn't burned, but it was defintely overcooked.  The recipe method says to cook the garlic for 10-15 minutes, this is FAR to long....5 minutes max is all that is needed.  Regardless of the overcooked (and thus crunchy) garlic, it was still great and I will make again this week being sure not to overcook the garlic!

We thought this was great. I ran with it, made it a complete meal with some black pepper, lemon juice, sun-dried tomatoes, and cold drained tuna. I used whole wheat pasta, served this with fresh black grapes on the side -- this is a super simple, super satisfying meal. The key thing here (and the thing that makes this recipe special) is to cook down the garlic -- it changes flavor as it browns and becomes something totally different from fresh raw garlic (which I *also* like on buttered noodles). Change it up as you like -- if you use unsalted butter, remember to add salt. Thanks for the recipe!

This made for a nice, light, summer pasta dinner. The flavor is really subtle, even though I halved the spaghetti (hubby's half had red sauce since he prefers that), but kept the sauce amount the same. So, I would probably double the sauce if using a whole box of spaghetti. I also added a pound of shrimp I had sauteed in garlic, olive oil, crushed red pepper, basil, and parsley. Good meal.

I am not giving this any stars because the recipe must be off.  I made the recipe as it is and it seemed strange that it was a pound of pasta with such small measurements for the other ingredients but I did it anyway.  Sure enough it came out like plain buttered noodles and dry at that.  I had to add a cup of feta I had in the fridge and  a cup of calamata olives with more olive oil to make it edible.  The picture looks like it would take a 1/4 pound of pasta with the those other measurements.  Oh well.

It was 4am and I had a hankering for something savory and substantial and since this was so easy and quick, I decided to try it.  It's delicious! The red pepper flakes add the perfect kick to it- I think the recipe might have been a little boring without it. I sorta incorporated the Onion Pasta recipe from this site into this recipe by adding some sliced onions and dried basil in with the oil, garlic, and red pepper flakes. I didn't toss the parsley in until the end, just because I was afraid it would lose some of the vibrant brightness had I sauteed the heck out of it.

This was really good. Tasty, light and quick. I tossed it with Whole Wheat Rotini and used it as a side dish for baked chicken. Unfortunately had to omit the red pepper flakes because of my little one, but still very good.

This recipe is a version of the classic Italian dish called "Aglio e Olio".  The authentic version does not call for parsley or butter, but just the one quarter cup of  olive oil.   Be VERY careful not to brown the garlic or it will turn the entire quarter cup of olive oil into a bitter unsavory oil and spoil the entire dish.  This dish was meant to be a simple yet delicious first course, not a main course.  As always, save some of the cooking liquid to moisten the dish if it is to dry.  It's easy to add your own personal touch to it by adding anchovies, parsley butter or meat.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

This reminds me of a recipe I make that I saw on the Rachel Ray show. It's Quick, Easy, and Pasta....who can ask for more! While I'm boiling my water for my lb. of pasta (I use wheat pasta) I use my food processor to combine 2 bunches of flat leaf parsley, 2 cloves of garlic, enough olive oil to make a paste and salt and pepper to taste.  Next I saute a couple of handful of pine nuts in olive oil....watch carefully so they do not burn.  When they begin to brown add 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs to brown.  Then add your parsley mixture and cook a few more minutes. Mix everything above with your cooked pasta, squeeze in the juice of one lemon and add fresh shredded parm cheese and garnish with a couple of chopped plum tomatoes.

I love the simplicity and ease of this recipe. I did omit the red pepper just because I have small kids and know they can not handle the spice. I would love to try it with that another time though. This recipe is a keeper and I will be making it often - especially those days when I don't have time to prepare a time consuming meal. I think this would also be good with some shrimp as well.

For something that seemed so simple, this was amazing! I served this as a side dish with Chicken Parmigiana and it was a really great balance. The combination of flavours was spot on and I really enjoyed it.

Yum - this is the easy and fast and delicious way to create a family meal.  I left out the red pepper flakes, since my son and I don't do hot stuff.  It's easy to let my husband add those at the table.  And of course, we love grated parmesan cheese.  I think next time, I might add some sliced roma tomatoes and fresh basil.

It was fine, but pretty bland. To add more flavor I added about 1 c. of shredded aged smoked gouda. With the cheese, the recipe deserves another star.

Very yummy.  Quick, easy, and flavorful.  Didn't have red pepper flakes so I added a dash of ground red pepper.

We enjoyed this a lot.  I used this as a side dish to some grilled Rosemary chicken--I had the low carb penne pasta on hand and it came out great.  The next night I put it back in the skillet with some chopped up red and yellow bell peppers as a light main dish.   Thank you.

Absolutely fantastic! I did make a few changes though. I didn't use any oil and did 1/4 c of butter plus an extra tablespoon. I also skipped the parsley, but added some dried chives after taking the noodles off the heat. A splash of lemon juice gave it a little extra zip, and everyone gobbled it up, especially me. Lol.

MARBALET, M-M-M-WAH!!! This is great stuff!  I'm on my second bowl since I made it this evening.  I chopped four large garlic buds and sauted them in the olive oil.  About half way through I added my red pepper flakes.  When that was done I added parsley, basil and the butter.  I stirred this until the butter was completly melted. I then poured this over the drained pasta, tossed it.  Topped off each helping with salt and parm cheese!  I just can't get enough.  Thanks so much, this will be a staple at my home.

I made this recipe exactly as stated but it seemed to be missing something.  It was very bland and dry.  I added more pasley and oregano leaves; the taste was better.  I won't be making this pasta again!

This was good, but a little bland for me. Maybe next time I will add more garlic and more cayenne. I sprinkled grated parmesan over this at the end and served this with parmesan chicken and a salad. This was a really nice side dish and went great with our meal. Thanks!

This recipe was really simple and tasty.  I didn't have the parsley and I'm sure I was missing some real flavor but even without it I'd recommend it.  I used a different shaped pasta and added about 1/2 cup of Parmesean Cheese to it.
Very tasty.  I may even add more cayenne next time.  Thanks for the recipe :)

This is a good recipe and so easy to "make it your own". My version is called "Maggie's Pasta". My daughters best friend in elementary school would literally raid the refridge the minute she entered our house! She  & my daughter would devour it! I delete the red pepper flakes and add a pinch or two of cayenne powder. I add 4-5 minced fresh garlic cloves (depending on the strength of the garlic). If I have the fresh parsley I used it, if not, I substituted dry. I add a couple of tablespoons of Italian Herb mix, & about a cap of Mrs Dash (yellow cap). I let that mixture slowly saute until the dried herbs are soft and incorporated. Add more butter and olive oil if needed. Add some grated fresh parmesan when tossing in the pasta  and you have.... Just YUMMY!  When I want to change it up, I do everything the same but add a few heaping tablespoons of prepared Pesto sauce from a jar. Let it all get warm and friendly together then....Ohhh my! I am going to have to make it tomorrow! Happy Cooking!

this is a great recipe...i jazz it up by putting the olive  oil and butter in together to brown the garlic.  When it is brown i take it out of the oil and cook shelled devained shrimp in the oil along with some italian seasoning.  To make it even fancier...i toss fresh spinich leaves in with the shrimp, oil and spices. Plate up and grate Parmesan Cheese on top while it is still hot.  This dish...Hot bread and a glass of wine put me in pasta heaven!!!

I love this - when I was growing up, every year my best friends grandfather hosted a huge Italian Christmas eve party - and this dish as well as one with nearly identical ingredients that included black olives, walnuts and anchovies.. was there  I now make these both for our Christmas eve feasts (some people, and I cant understand why, just dont like anchovies! :)) they're always a hit. Wonderful Marbalet :) wonderful :)UPDATE: Aug.2014 Stillloving it.  Just little suggestions, use a good quality olive oil. make sure to punch up your spices if you tend to go for a strong spice taste - DH has Passed before Christmas this past year, so we didn't enjoy it as we always did. but I have such warm memories of serving this at Christmas time.... Thank you for the recipe again Marbalet

Needed a simple recipe that complemented the "mother-in-law's tongue" birthday pasta my sister bought me. I didn't want a sauce that 'covered up' my pasta. Loved the simplicity and flavors! Whole family loved it. I ALWAYS add in meat so I put in a pound of Italian sausage. Yummy...not to mention a lot of fun with the pasta!

I made this for my sister, and she can't take any hint of spice so i took out the red pepper flakes and she still loved it! I may have added a bit too much oil/butter, so maybe it would be healthier and tastier if the amount of oil and butter was slightly reduced.

OMG! This is the easiest and tastiest recipe! It's evil, actually, because I couldn't stop eating and I'm on carb overload. The only thing this needs is some salt and pepper and then it would be a 5 star recipe.

Love this pasta.  I make this at least monthly at my house and the entire family loves it.  I add some additional spice for the hubby and I, but either way it's fantastic and SO easy.  Thanks!

couldn't have been quicker or easier.  I had everything on hand and even added cooked shrimp (bought frozen deveined, cooked, tails removed and thawed in water for a few minutes- I added it the last couple of minutes just to warm it through).  I will double the garlic.  10 minutes is too long- it will burn.  5 minutes probably.  I think it's too much pasta for the amount of sauce though.

Such a simple, yet classic recipe!  I used less butter, and added in some crushed red pepper flakes and topped with fresh grated parm-reggianno cheese, it was a great side dish to florentine stuffed chicken breasts!

I reduced the time I cooked the garlic to 5 minutes and used powdered red pepper flakes, also at the last minute added 3 finely chopped sun dried tomatoes to it, this recipe really popped with that!!! my kids really like this one!

while the spaghetti is cooking I put a colander with broccoli in it over the pot, and of course I double the garlic.  Be careful when cooking the garlic.  Don't let it get too brown or it will just get bitter. Good recipe.  Enjoy

Nice combination but I found it needed a bit more flavour. I added salt and paprika instead of chili peppers.

This was delicious!  The next time I made it i added shrimp and that was also delicious. I made some for my children and omitted the red pepper flakes but for the "adult" portion I put them in.  Throw some parmesan/romano cheese on top and this is a winner!

I made this exactly as written but already had left over spaghetti noodles in the fridge. I took enough for two servings and poured some of the sauce over those noodles, warmed the noodles up in the same skillet, and then sprinkled parmesan cheese over it. YUM! I put the rest of the sauce in a mason jar in the fridge. Can't wait to make more pasta and have it again for lunch tomorrow!  Did I already say, "Yum!"???

Awesome base! The heat in it is perfect. I would easily add in basil, grape tomatoes, shrimp and fresh asiago and Parmesan. Will be keeping this in my back pocket for sure.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE! I cooked it for dinner fir my family to help my family. And my mom told me that i should cook dinner more often. I didnt have parsley, so i substituted spinach and it still turned out great! Tasty! I also cooked chicken breasts with italian seasoning and oregano. And i put them all together and topped it off with grated parmasean cheese. AMAZING! Could not be happier with it

I really liked this pasta. I thought it super easy and a great dish to make when you're in a crunch, or as a side dish like I did. I made stuffed bell peppers and a little side of this spicy pasta (i added a bit more chili flakes to mine) was awesome.

My family has enjoyed this meal passed down for generations from Sicily.  We don't cook the parsley, but offer it as a topping.  We also cook sliced mushrooms w/the garlic and butter/oil.  The more garlic the better!!

The BEST pasta ever! It's not often that I make a recipe exactly as it's written and have it come out fabulous. This is a rare gem. Great with steak or chicken parm. Even my 5 yr old loved it and didn't even notice the slight kick the red pepper flakes gave it!

You can use just about any kind of string pasta for this recipe.  My family prefer it without the pepper flakes.  The original recipe was called Pasta al la Pavarotti.  Makes a great side dish for nearly everything.

I really liked this, and so did my picky eater hubby. I made it as the recipe said and yummy. next time to liven things up a bit, I will put in some chopped tomatoes, just as an option to change things around. but tomatoes are not necessary by any means.

My family LOVED this recipe.  I have very picky kids and they both asked for more.  I did cut back on the amount of oil and butter and added a little parmesan cheese when served.  We will be making this again in the future.  I recommend serving with the blistered cherry tomato recipe on this site.

Very good. I added a little of an Italian herb mix, but I think I'll try it as written next time.

If you are using unsalted butter as I did, you will need to add salt.  We added garlic salt at the table and it was edible.  Not so much before that.  The pasta was a little dry even though I used the recipe measurements for everything but half the pasta.

This was a good last minute recipe, but it's really just buttered garlic noodles. Good for kids, but husband wasn't a fan.

I have only recently understood how to make this dish - the low low heat while cooking the red pepper flakes, garlic and parsley is absolutely a MUST. Only then will you get the flavours infused into the oil. I used only olive oil instead and I'm sure that took away some of the flavours, but it is still a good flavourful pasta to serve.

This is very good and easy to make.  I used 1/2 a teaspoon of red pepper flakes instead of 1/4 a teaspoon because I like spicy food.

Great recipe... for picky toddlers. Just tasted like plain ol' buttered noodles...very disappointing after all the rave reviews.  I've made this twice now (I guess I'm hesitant to discard a recipe that has so many great reviews), but I won't make it again.  If you still want to make this, you'll need to add lots of salt & freshly grated parmesan & fresh ground pepper just to make it palatable.

This is such an awesome quick great lunch or dinner idea.  So quick and easy, I have made it several times.  I have added chopped fresh or diced canned tomatoes as well and the family really likes it that way.  Also topped with fresh grated parmessan cheese.

I enjoyed this very much!  I used angel hair pasta; YUM.  I think next time I will use a little more garlic, maybe a couple of cloves more.  I'm a garlic lover.  But this dish was really, really easy, quick, and delicious.

I left out the red pepper flakes for 2 who do not like spicy.  This was very good and a great way to separate pasta and keep it from getting mushy.  I plan to use this technique in the future.

5 stars according to my family this time.  I left in the red pepper flakes and it's a great way to use leftover spaghetti.  They said it was the best part of our meal.

Love this recipe just as it is written!  I understand people altering it for their own personal likes and children, etc.  But, the recipe is excellent!  I have made it several times and appreciate the suggestions from other members.  BUT, the recipe is 5 stars as it is!

i've tried this recipe with both fresh and dried parsley, and i prefer it with the latter. the flavour is stronger, but having said that, either was equally good. i've also sauteed chicken and mushrooms and added it to the dish and it tastes even better. one tip; do NOT omitt the chilli flakes, it gives an extra layer of flavour to the pasta. will definitely make this again.

Very good. I did need to add salt to bring out the flavor more. I think the addition of fresh tomatoes and black olives would really compliment this dish.  Will add those next time.

Made this for my two young grandsons (2 & 4) and they loved it.  Made a couple of minor changes for their tastes... I omitted the red pepper flakes, seasoned lightly with salt and added grated Parmesan cheese before serving.  The 4-yr old asked for seconds! Definitely a dish I will make again!

Last night my mom was sick, so I decided to cook something up. Not only was this simple and tasty but it was ingredients I always have on hand, When I mentioned this pasta dish she was excited, this is one of her favorites. My mother, who lived in Sicily, said this was perfect, just the right amount of everything.

Delicious and light. Well, it felt light but I saw the butter and olive oil that went into it. Every once in a while the bite would have a little kick at the end. I didn't mind even though while making it I was a little worried because I don't like really spicy food. But this was perfect. Then the next night we had the leftovers with our meal and put the sauce over it from our baked pork chops that I found on this site. Also, I used linguini instead of spaghetti but no big difference.

I used chopped cloves of garlic to flavor the oil and took them out before dumping the oil over the pasta. My fiance liked the kick from the crushed red pepper. Great as a side dish or a late dinner, in our case. :) Will definitely use it again.

This is not an exciting recipe, but it's not meant to be. It is a lovely food to pair with a strong taste. One of our favorites is the Spicy Oven Fried Chicken recipe from this site - serve that chicken over lots of this pasta an all will be right with the world.

Awesome! I skipped the cayenne. Instead I seasoned some shrimp with cajun seasoning and quick fried them and added them to the pasta. A great dinner. Thanks

This is my go-to recipe when I need a pasta side dish. I double everything except the pasta and sub a little more olive oil for the melted butter. Nice & light & flavorful...perfect with Angel Hair!

love this - added a little salt, cut the butter in half, and didn't saute the garlic for quite as long... but really tasty and light and spicy.  Very nice side dish with honey baked ham slices.

I know this sounds rather odd, but I am not sure what I thought of this.  I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either.  Would I make it again ... I am not sure!

This was a really good,simple pasta dish. I think that the taste is meant to be subtle (some called it 'bland'). I cut the recipe in half, and made 2 actual servings of whole wheat pasta (a 'real' serving is about 1 cup, cooked) and I found it to be just a tad greasy/oily (not too bad, though). I will cut the EVOO and the butter a bit next time I make it for two. I also added sundried tomatoes and fresh mushrooms to the EVOO and garlic, and fresh parm on top - skipped the cayenne due to personal preference. This will be my new 'go to' base recipe when I want a simple pasta and veggie dinner. I can't wait to try this with Roma tomatoes, asparagus, green and red peppers, artichoke hearts...ooh, and seafood too! Yum - this is going to be fun to play with!

I vary this recipe with 1/2 c olive oil heated in a saucepan, add 1 cup diced pepperoni, 2 tablespoons garlic and about 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Add a handful of chopped parsley. Make sure when you add the garlic you only let it get blond in color. The worst thing for this dish is burning the garlic. If this seems dry add about 1/2 to 1 cup of pasta water and it will be perfect. Just remember when draining the pasta to save some of the pasta water. This is a nice alternative to rice or potato for a side dish.

Made This for my fiancee and I and we ate a whole pound of pasta by ourselves and I have been wanting more all day. I made a few changes. I used a can of drained diced tomatoes, angel hair pasta, some fresh basil, and some fresh grated pamesean cheese along with the other ingredients. This would even be good without thwe extras, I just really wanted tomatoes in it. Out of this world. Thanks..

This was very good.  It was so simple but quite tasty.  The garlic turned golden in about 5 minutes, though, not 15.  I used very wide (about 1 1/2") flat pasta, and it was rather classy!

This was very good and simple to make.  My kids didn't like it too much, I used crushed red pepper instead of the pepper called for in the recipe, although I used it sparingly.  I plan on making this again, my husband and I enjoyed it.

I made two changes: when mixing the oil/butter sauce to the pasta, I added about 1/3 cup pasta water and a generous handful of fresh grated Parmesan.  These small revisions made for a delicious side dish. I generously salted the pasta water (1 1/2 - 2 tablespoons) prior to cooking the pasta. This dish is a keeper.

**EXCELLENT** Made it to accompany a very tasty but plain looking chicken breast for a group of 30 people & EVERYONE raved! Simple but so flavorful, just the right amount of kick from the red pepper flakes & I am not a fan of hot/spicy dishes & this is far from that so I would not alter this recipe at all for the 1st time you try it. I grated fresh Parmesan over the entire thing right off the heat then tong tossed it all together with just a bit of the pasta water...the pasta water & Parmesan give this dish the salt needed to take it from great tasting to outstanding! I will use this recipe over & over again, thank you so much for sharing!

We used fresh angel hair pasta and sprinkled it generously with fresh parmesan after plating it. I never knew something so quick and simple could be so delicious! We'll be making this often.

This is a great basic pasta side dish. I made it as is, but I can see adding more garlic next time and using it as a base for more involved dishes from time to time. Glad I found it. It's a nice alternative to plain old noodles and butter, which my daughters love but the rest of us find lacking.

I believe this is one of the family staples in Italy when we visited.  It's so lovely!  Another variation is to replace the parsley with fresh basil.

Everything perfect about this recipe. But if it could state salt measure it would be much much easier than guess work . Also adding little more garlic brings out the flavour. Thanks marbalet.

Been making this recipe for over 20 years, but have added to it.  I add a small can of sliced black olives and a small can of mushrooms to the oil.  Once in awhile I'll even add some broccoli.  My boys loved it growing up.

I put the butter in the the oil mixture at the end, why would I dirty another dish to melt the butter? Just melt it in the skillet and pour it in the pasta! This wasn't our favorite though. It has no salt and just had an off taste that no one preferred. Thanks anyway!

I liked this recipe and it was definitely easy! The only complaint I have is that it really didn't have that much flavor. I think adding a little more spice would make this amazing. The only thing i've added so far was some parmesan cheese but even that helped to boost the flavor. I'll let you know when I try some more. Thanks for sharing!

I make this occasionally for my Sicilian Dad, but not with red pepper flakes; he's 96!  I use thin spaghetti, even angel hair (his favorite) or cappelini. Toss with parmesan cheese and a side of garlic bread. YUM.

I make this quite often though I add more garlic and will throw shrimp in as well.  Add some bread to sop up the garlic oil on the plate and it is a meal

I had this once at a local Italian restaurant, figure it was easy enough to replicate but glad someone here already put up the blue print. Great dish that has the whole house smelling like we really slaved over the stove!

Yum! I made a mistake and over-sauteed the oil/garlic mixture, so the pasta had a smoky/burned taste to it. Despite that, they were delicious, everyone's plate was cleaned. A little parmasean cheese on top goes a long way as well!

This recipe is soooo simple, but is soooo good! I left out the red pepper flakes because of my kids taste buds, but was still so tasty. I served it as a side dish to Cube Steak Parmesan. My kids gobbled it up. It would be really good too with some broccoli and grilled chicken served on top for a one dish meal!

This was just okay- I give it credit for being EASY and using so few ingredients, but it was pretty bland. The crushed pepper flakes gave it a bit of kick, but other than that it was just oily pasta. Next time maybe I will add more seasoning, maybe basil/ oregano and italian seasoning.

Really pretty good and easy to make. If you have parm cheese, throw it in there. In my opinion that's what was missing.

This recipe was really good.  The only changes I made were adding 3 roma tomatoes and using half the amount of spaghetti.  I still used the same amount of "sauce".  It was great and I will be making it again!

So, I'm on the fence about this. I felt it needed more seasoning, s+p, garlic, italian seasonings. I thought it was a little on the bland side. But then again, I really enjoyed it as a side dish to "Barbeque Chicken" by Annelizabeth. The lemony italian spiced chicken was a perfect compliment to this dish. However, would I make this dish alone? No. But on a plus side, it is a fast dish that includes many ingredients most people have on hand!

This is such a delicious, classic pasta dish! We have this often, and I always add more garlic. Most of the time I omit the pepper flakes, just serve with the dish at the table.  For a different variation, saute some chopped broccoli with the oil mixture, we love it this way. Freshly chopped basil is also very good, use that instead of the parsley. Be sure to top with plenty of freshly grated parmesan cheese when served. :)

This is pasta in it's most simpliest form! Nothing fancy, but tastes great, either as a side dish or main dish. The great thing about this pasta (besides the taste), is that most of us always have these ingredients on hand. We LOVE this pasta! :)

This was a very simple and good recipe. I did add some parmesan cheese to the mix and used about double the amount of garlic the recipe asked for and next time I will probably add even more garlic. All in all this is a recipe I will try again and again.

Classic, delicious, and a snap!  I usually add extra garlic, and sometimes a little oregano.  A handful of sun dried tomatoes thrown in with the oil is a delicious twist once in a while.

I didn't find that it had any taste.  I had to salt and pepper it quite a bit.  Parmesan cheese helped a little.  Did I do something wrong or is this recipe suppose to be light on flavor?

I made this tonight and thought it was okay, but nothing special. I was pretty hungry so I ate all 4 servings myself. I did make it exactly as written. If anything, I'd say there was a bit too much butter and oil here. The other spices were kind of mild. I would've liked a much more savory, if not spicy dish. (I usually read all previous reviews before posting my own, but I'll skip all 125 previous reviews this time.)

This recipe was ok, a bit bland for me, might of been better with spinach and bell pepper. I prefer this recipe chilled with a bit of mozzarella cheese sprinkled throughout. It just wasnt my favorite

I make this often when it's just me for dinner. Stirring in some parmesan cheese right before serving adds the right amount of zing and salt.

I thought this was great and you can use what you have in the fridge/pantry. I added some sundried tomatoes and minced the garlic.

Pretty good and easy to make. I made this with whole grain pasta and served with pan seared chicken breasts and steamed broccoli.  When the oil/butter mix was done I tossed everything together.  This was quick easy and yummy.

I truly liked this recipe. I did change it:  I added a lb. of shrimp, and a cup of Romano cheese grated, and a lb of cooked mushrooms.  Roasted pine nuts would be good too.

My family and I loved Pasta Olio. We had it two nights in a row.  For those of you that has a husband that loves the red sauce, don't let it spoil your Olio...just get a jar of spaghetti sauce and let him have his sauce.

I had been fighting an ugly stomach virus and eating nothing when I found myself standing in the doorway of my pantry and wondering WHAT can I eat that will stay put? I found your recipe and was tickled when all the ingredients are staples in most kitchens. When put together it was fantastic. I did add a bit of red pepper flakes and held back a bit on the oil and only a touch of butter for the taste, but this just hit the right spot. I love pasta without all the bells and whistles and this is a definite keeper.  Thank you!

This was an excellent dish. Like another viewer I added some chopped tomatoes and fresh basil. That really added a lot of flavor. Hubby loved it and said it was better than Shrimp Scampi(which is a favorite of his) Definitely be making this one again. Thanks

This is simple yet tasty. However I found it a tad dry and would probably add more olive oil next time. You can easily add your favourite accompaniments by cooking small pieces of veg/meat/seafood in the sauce before tossing with pasta.

Not a pleaser for meat-lovers, but delicious and quick to prepare. I add about 1/4 cup of grated parmesan and 1 cup diced fresh tomatoes at the end just before tossing with the pasta.

Easy and tasty treat.  We didn't add parsley so that my 2.5 year old can take it; but we added brown button mushroom (sliced) and boy was it yummy.  The next time we cook this, I'd add a little parsley and just a teeny-weeny pinch of salt.

This was very tasty. The only thing I changed is I added about 2 tbsp. of parmesan cheese at the end. Otherwise, very good with just enough kick.

This came out very good, I added broccoli to it and it added a little more flavor as well as what is already coming from this.  Will make again.

This was actually better the following day. I served it w/Famous Butter Chicken(not a light meal!!)I also tossed the Pasta with Broccoli to give it some color. It was tasty, but not 5 stars.

This dish was easy to make and tasty too. But I recommend not to use as much oil as directed if you are not a big fan of olive oil!

So so so so good! I didn’t add cayenne pepper because I wanted my toddler to try it but regardless it was delicious. I cooked for my mom, sis, and hubby and they all said it was perfect. I paired it with a chicken piccata recipe from Allrecipes as well.

I followed it almost exactly, but since I didn’t have fresh parsley, I added dry parsley instead, about half of the recipe amount, added some dry basil, very little. My kids loved it! And they are very picky eaters!

This was excellent and easy! I only sauteed the garlic for a few min (personal preference). To me, it would be a bit bland without adding the crushed red pepper flakes. They really kick it up a notch! I also added a little of the water from the pasta, used dried parsley and topped with salt, pepper and Romano cheese. I had this with Chicken Milanese from this site. It could be a side dish or a main dish. Thanks for this great recipe!

Very good!  Tasted just like garlicy buttered noodles.  The only thing I did differently was to slice the garlic instead of mincing it, so that the garlic wouldn't burn and turn bitter.  Slowly toast the garlic over a low-med heat.  It turned out great and made a nice side dish.  Thank you for the recipe!

This is a great recipe and so easy to tweak to your own liking. I added chopped Sundried tomatos and quartered artichoke hearts at the end of cooking the garlic and served it at a dinner party. It was a hit and vegetarian friendly as an easy added entree. Thanks

We have a favorite Italian restraint we go to in northern Wi. We enjoy the oil ,butter and garlic noodles and have been trying to make them at home with not much luck. This one fits the bill for a fraction of the price.

As it was written not a fan, too oily and greasy and the garlic just wasn't right. I saw the potential in it though so the second time around I essentially simplified it, I added just a splash of olive oil to the noodles after cooking, melted the butter in a pan with the red pepper, garlic powder and a little dried parsley. Shut off the burner, tossed the noodles in the pan and mixed in a good amount of fresh parsley, salt and pepper, and a touch of lemon juice to brighten it up a bit. It was perfect, served with lemony steamed fish recipe.

Delicious! Took some others' suggestions and added basil to the oil and (used extra (4-5 cloves) garlic.  I had a tube of prechopped fresh basil leftover from another recipe, so used that (the whole tube).  I added half a stick of butter to the garlic mixture then dumped it onto the angel hair pasta.  Yumm. Will definitely make again.

I think any Italian growing up has had this meal 100's of times.  I usually mix different items in.  I saute Broccoli or Spinach in the Garlic and add it to the Pasta.
If you want to get more elaborate, saute green olives, pines nut and raisens in the Garlic.  The ingrediatents compliment each other.

Great recipe. I tweeked it a little by adding some ingredients that others added for a few additional. Added broccoli and fresh spinach to the pasta water and cooked along with the pasta. To the olive oil, red pepper flakes and garlic I added freshly chopped basil and parsley, two sliced baby bella's and chopped walnuts. Fantastic dish!

Easy on the red pepper flakes, if you do not like spicy food. 2 out of 5 stars as recipe is, 4 out of 5 stars if you add Parmesan cheese and sprinkle with some salt. Used brown rice spaghetti noodles and that turned out just fine.

This was exactly what I wanted for dinner tonight. It was simple, yet flavorful, and the perfect accompaniment for when you want the entree to be the star. If you want heat from the crushed red pepper, you will need to increase the amount.

This is a wonderful recipe, especially if your a vegetarian...or if you just  love pasta.  Simple easy to prepare, is definitely kid friendly...my grand kids just love, I have the opportunity to adding some gulf shrimp and it was devine. That's what makes this a versitile dish..good job.

So simple. My husband loved it. I added salt and extra oil. Will add more red pepper flakes next time. Topped with Romano cheese.

Very yummy, quick and easy to make, next time I think the only thing I will do different is a heaping 1/4c of parsley instead of an exact one! :D

I added some onions and put more garlic than called for on it because I knew these flavors would not be enough. I only added a few pepper flakes because I hate spicy foods.  The dish was horrible. It was very oily and bland. There was no taste what-so-ever. I added some garlic, which saved this dish and made me able to eat it. I will not make this again.

this was good..but it was oily!! i left out the crushed red peppers cause my hubby doesn't eat spicy food. after i drained the noodles, i didn't want it to stick together so i put in about 1 tsp. of butter (i only made 2 servings). it didn't take me 10-15 mins to brown the garlic..it only took me like a couple of minutes, probably because i grated the garlic in the oil. after i added the pasta, i didn't add any more butter cause i had already added it to the pasta after i drained it. it was good, but just too oily.

I've made this a few times as a side dish and it has a good balance and if you use fresh garlic and let it slow cook in the oil it is really good.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that heating the olive oil with the garlic & pepper gave the pasta sort of a nutty, mellow flavor.  I wanted to add a veggie to this dish, so wilted some fresh spinach with the pasta water and then added all into the skillet to saute together for a minute or so in the butter.

I found that there was too much parsley and didn't have tons of flavor. But its a nice alternative for a quick linguine/spaghetti pasta.

This was a nice variation from the usual vegetable sides we have.  I just felt I needed to add too much too this to rate it higher.  I added a lot more of everything but noodles, plus I generously sprinkled each serving with parmesan and romano before serving, and we all thought it could still use a little something.  I will keep this recipe to play around with though.

Reviewed on Thursday, July 16, 2009 by Rosie   Absolutely delicious!  The recipe is a permanent keeper.  I used more garlic as my husband and I are enthusiastic garlic lovers.  I thought the red pepper flakes added a nice, mild hot sensation.  The addition of grated parmigian sprinkled over individual servings was a final touch.

This was pretty decent stuff. Flavors were very mellow, even with the pepper flakes, but overall it was really nice and easy to do. I will definitely make this again.

Very good and easy to make on a busy work night.  Because I have a picky three-year-old, I ommitted the red pepper, but added fresh mushrooms and zucchini, as well as two sliced, leftover grilled chicken breasts from last night's dinner.  I sauteed all of the vegetables and chicken slices in the oil, parsley, and garlic, and blended it with the butter and pasta.  Served with grated parmesan cheese, it was great!

Great Recipe!  Easy to prepare.  Easy to make adjustments to.  We didn't have fresh parsley so I used a box of frozen spinach that I had thawed & drained.  We love garlic so I added extra and left out the pepper flakes.  It was excellent!

I love this.. I've altered it a bit though... I use way more garlic - and really stink people out - but the garlic is soooo good!!!  I leave out the butter - I use crushed red chili peppers instead of cayenne, and I put lots of freshly grated parmesan on top.. soooooooo delicious!!!!   hmmmm maybe it will be dinner tonight!!!!

Great recipe but I would change it slightly to be used as a side dish as well as a main course. Since 2 oz of pasta is one serving, cut the amount of pasta to 8 oz, and serve with a grilled chicken breast or salmon steak. The flavors of the pasta will compliment the grilled meat.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was fantastic. The spices all compliment each other and it tastes like something that took an hour to make instead of 15 min. Thank You!

I made this with the recipe Garlic Chicken Fried Chicken.  It was nicely complimentary with the chicken.  I grew up in an italian household, but this was never on our menu.  I'm not sure why not, because it was really good!  Subtly flavored, not overpowering.  You could probably add more spice if you are looking for stronger flavor and it would turn out fine, but I liked it just the way it is!  My kids loved it,too.

Mmmm... This was a favorite growing up.  Whenever we were nearing a shopping day my mom would make this.  Of course my Dad used to pretend to put the red pepper flakes on my plate.  But I still swore I tasted it.  Thanks for reminding me of an old favorite.

This was ok - I of course let the garlic cook a little too long and it was on the crunchy side. Not much flavor - my husband says it would've been "betta with feta". Maybe I'll try it again sometime with some changes.

Really good! I used this as a side dish to "Famous Butter Chicken" as another reviewer did, and the spiciness complimented well. I used a fresh cayenne pepper, but kept the recipe the same otherwise.

Good.  Kind of subtle taste as expected.  I'd definitely add some grated parmesean.
