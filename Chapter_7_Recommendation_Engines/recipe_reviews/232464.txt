This is the exact flavor I was looking for!  I was unsure about ketchup, but I followed everything to the letter and it turned out perfectly.  Quick and easy, and even the kids liked it!  I served it over rice noodles with diced chicken, bean sprouts, and sugar snap peas.

This is extremely spicy. I even cut the Sriracha down to 1 tablespoon and didn't put much chili flakes and smoke was coming out of my ears. I had to add a lot of peanut butter and water to make it tolerable. Next time I will omit the chili flakes and put 1tsp of Sriracha instead.

Fantastic! I replaced the chili sauce with a sweet chili sauce and omitted the sugar. It was quite thick to be a dipping sauce, but I used it in the Thai Chicken Brocolli from this site, which worked very well.

I made this sauce and served it over rice noodles with chicken and it was so delicious! Made it twice in one week and the second time I added a little more peanut butter... Tasted very similar to chicken pad Thai and I loved it

This stuff is unreal! I have always avoided asian sauces cause they are always sugary sweet, or unbelievably hot. This was a great balance of both. AND - Peanut Butter? How can you lose...unless of course you have a peanut allergy. This is truly worth a look. KUDOS to the chef!

This is my recipe and we've enjoyed it many times- I made it last night when my parents came for dinner and it even turned out well with the heat scaled back for my mom just by leaving out the majority of the red pepper flakes.  My favorite peanut sauce!

Made it according to the recipe and it was great!  Just a precaution; if you are spicy-intolerant, you may want to tone down the sriracha and chili pepper flakes.  I loved the spiciness though!

This was really delicious. I only modified by using the half of a red onion I had in the fridge and only 1 tbsp of sriracha/hot sauce was enough for our family. And no red pepper. Very yummy over rice noodles with grilled chicken and broccoli!

This recipe has exceptional flavor.  I don't think I cooked it long enough as it was really lumpy but the flavor made up for that!  It was not too spicy for our family but we love spice.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a great peanut sauce that doesn't need coconut milk. I used less oil and added minced ginger. I also used huy fong garlic chili sauce side note: this sauce is awesome with everything. Tasting at the end it seemed to lack some dimension so I added 2 tsp rice wine vinegar and that did it! I used this sauce to coat another AR recipe with fried tofu. So good! Thank you for the recipe!

Not a fan of spicy but had some chicken and plain noodles on hand so peanut sauce sounded appetizing. For the spice lightweights, I omitted the garlic sauce and pepper and the onion and garlic because I don't like chunks of onion in my peanut sauce. Used 3/4 water and 1/4 rice vinegar to give a more "asian" taste. Doubled the pb and added brown sugar.

I used this when I was making a recipe that called for peanut sauce and the store is 20+ miles away.  Turned out great and was easy.

This is just like our Thai restaurant, Tasty Thai.  I can't believe it's so good! We were hesitant about the ketchup,  but added it anyway and you wouldn't know it was in there.  It's creamy and delicious.  We used brown sugar instead of white and added fresh cilantro. Thank you!

This absolutely satiated my craving for a spicy Thai dish. Made this recipe exactly as written and we loved it. Served it over brown rice with baked chicken tenderloins that I cut up and tossed in the sauce as well as sugar snap pods, water chestnuts, bean sprouts, baby corn, matchstick carrots and shredded cabbage. It was a filling, delicious dinner and the peanut sauce was the star! I will most definitely make this again, probably very soon!

This was pretty good. Things I did different: used Cholula instead of siracha, added more peanut butter, and chopped peanuts. Will make again.

I didnt have any sriracha, so I substituted go-chu-jang and it turned out really good.  I love that the spiciness is there but goes away after a few minutes. I will definitely be making this for our stir fry again.

This was really good. Only thing I changed was I did 1 1/2 tbsp Sriracha,  and 1/2 tsp of the pepper flakes. I also added a bit more pb and water. I made chicken pieces with garlic and salt cooked in Sesame oil, sautéed onion slices and garlic, Jasmine rice, and broccoli. I topped the chicken and rice with the sauce. Was AMAZING!

I followed the recipe exactly and served it over green beans, shiitake mushrooms and soy chicken. I would use tempeh next time, but the sauce was delicious. I might put fewer flakes and/ or sub in some ginger paste to experiment with flavors. Very good recipe!

Very tasty sauce! My wife and kids are not fans of very spicy things so I toned it down a bit but still left some zing. 1 tbsp of sriracha and a sprinkle of crushed chilies. I also didn't have sesame oil but it turned out great! Definitely going to be making this a lot more in the future!

I was looking for a dish to use broccoli slaw and found this referenced in the Thai chicken Broccoli Slaw.  This is a great recipe and I will use this a lot.  I added more peanut butter once I added the chicken and vegies and I think it could use some ginger.  But this is my new Thai peanut sauce.  thanks for posting this.

Way too spicy and took way too long to smooth out the dip.
If you have an hour to kill, try this.
Look for an easier recipe.
