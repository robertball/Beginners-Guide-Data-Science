This what a hit at a family party we went to. I used 1 bag of baby spinach and 1 bag of a lettuce/baby spinach mix and used the feta cheese (put it on last) that came with the salad mix. I only had 3/4 cup of mayo so I added a 1/4 cup of sour cream. I used 1/2 Tbsp. of white vinegar and 1/2 Tbsp. of raspberry vinegar. Everything else was the same except I didn't use a full Tbsp. of poppy seeds (just personal preference). Our niece and BIL said that it tasted just like a salad they had in Hawaii. Everyone said it was great and we took home NO leftovers. Important: So that it wasn't soggy, I took everything to the party separate and put the salad together right before serving. Also, didn't use all the dressing. I think if I had it would have been too much. FYI - April 11, 2009 - This salad was requested for me to bring to the family Easter Dinner tomorrow! Thank you for the recipe!

Unbelievable!  I did add some reduced fat feta and some walnutes and substituted mayo for light mayo.  Loved everyhting about it and still felt it was light enough to be a healthy option!

This is a great recipe, even for a non-salad lover like myself.  I add mandarin oranges along with the strawberries, and it really adds a nice touch, too.  This is a house favorite!

Excellent Salad! I love the poppy seed dressing. We replaced the iceberg with romaine hearts and shallots for the red onion and everyone really enjoyed this salad and will be happy to have it again. Thanks for sharing!

This was amazing! I used a half baby spinach and half italian prepackaged salad greens mixture, added kraft mediterranean crumbles and chopped walnuts and instead of using the dressing mixture listed I used Brianne's Blush Wine vinagrette. I served this salad with tuna and black olives stuffed into pita halves and even my super picky boyfriend cleaned his plate. He is not very adventurous and guffawed at fruit in a salad, but he loved it. Thanks so much!

OH - MY - GOSH!!! I cannot BEGIN to describe the huge hit that this was at a dinner party I threw recently. I served it with salmon, asparagus with Parm. cheese and toasted almonds, cucumber salad, and corn-tomato salad, and everyone liked everything, but THIS WAS THE BOMB!!!! They could not stop raving about it! Even days afterwards! Make this for your fanciest or more casual entertaining - it fits both and will be sure to please. Very easy to make and deceptively simple. You cannot go wrong with this. Trust me!   I added goat cheese sprinkles; several people mentioned this was the finishing touch that made it spectacular in combination with the other ingredients.

I made a small batch of this for the two of us.  I did bump up the white vinegar just a bit and didn’t use all the sugar or all the poppy seeds.  I used hearts of romaine mixed with red leaf lettuce and green onion, because I didn’t have red.  I just drizzled my dressing over the salads, instead of tossing – I didn’t want it to weight down my greens.  And I added the feta as others suggested.  Very good!

BEST. SUMMER. SALAD. E-V-A-H. Wow. I did add feta but the dressing was SO good that it didn't need any modifications. And, we're not even salad people. Wow.

My dressing didn't "drizzle" so I added several tablespoons of coconut milk.  Not only did it help with the consistency of the dressing, I preferred the hint of flavor it added.  You may also want to reduce the sugar in the dressing.

This salad was a huge hit at Bunco.  I added Feta cheese crumbles after reading a few previous reviews and everyone LOVED this!  The unexpected romance between strawberries & red onions was fantastic!

Loved this! I made this 3 times to serve for guests, once with veggienaise(the grape seed one) and once with Dukes, and once with another brand of mayo that I can't remember. Veggienaise was best. Dukes was significantly better than the other standard mayo. All 3 times it was completely eaten so can't go wrong really.

Such a simple dressing really is extraordinary!  I will be making more of this luscious dressing!  I did add a little extra vinegar for tartness.  I just used a mixed green salad and added the red onion, strawberries and blueberries.   I think this will make a wonderful dinner salad with some sliced grilled chicken on top.

Had strawberries that needed to be eaten. Followed the recipe as written. Delicious! Husband loved it too.  My sister allergic to strawberries so put tangerine slices in hers and was equally good.

Everyone in our familyloves this salad, made no changes at all.  The one thing I will mention, it has to be eaten, no left overs because they get soggy, so don't make more than your family can eat!

I made the recipe as written, and my dressing turned out more like a paste.  It was so thick.  I used Kraft brand mayo.  Maybe the brand makes a difference.  I ended up adding quite a bit of milk and additional vinegar to make it "pourable".  After that, it needed a little more sugar.  With those changes, it was delicious.

Liked the combination of ingredients but since it was for Memorial Day, I added some blueberries,  toasted walnuts and feta cheese.   Thought the dressing was tasty but a little too thick for my taste.

This salad was super refreshing and light, but definitely satisfying!! Which is what I look for in a salad. I did cut the amount of poppy seeds in half, other than that...this is by far one of my favorite salads ever.

added grapes and nuts - only had macadamias but walnuts or pecans would be good too.

As others have said, you'll need to cut the dressing ingredients in half or you will half a sloppy goop.
Served it once and it was requested for a birthday dinner the next night. This is an easy and fun tasting salad. The poppy seeds put it over the top.

Excellent dressing.  The combo of the onions and strawberries was amazing.
