Instead of broiling, I used this as a marinade for thighs I was baking.  I added seasame oil, but other than that, didn't change any ingredients, and it was delicious!

These are wonderful!  A new party favorite.  I made 5 pounds of them for a Christmas party and had 5 or 6 wings left.  I can't see making them for a main dish, but they are perfect for a buffet or appetizer.

these were very good wings...a hit at a familt gathering (and i'm a cooking lightweight compared to my culinary inclined aunts). I didn't think that the sesame seeds added anything and could easily be omitted. As well the recipie asked to broil the wings on each side instead of baking then broiling I think this would have burnt them...what I did was to cut down on the preptime once my guest arrived I par-boiled the wings in advance and marinated them overnight then just browned them for a couple of minutes (very quick)

The sauce has a nice flavor.  I have already made this recipe twice.  Both times I was too lazy to brown the sesame seeds and it still was great.

Sounded great, but turned out to be pretty soggy and not as flavorful as you would think with all that honey, etc.

Very good! Fast to cook under a broiler. I broiled 5 minutes each side. I toasted my sesame seeds in a hot non stick omelet pan (stirring constantly until they started changing color) instead of baking. I did only marinate for an hour which was enough time.

These were good! My only complaint is that the sauce did not caramelize as much as I would have liked but other than that I have no complaints. If I were to make again I wouldn't  baste them throughout the broiling process. They had a nice crisp going on prior to that. Still good and a nice change from buffalo wings.

I would use less sesame seeds & add 1-2 Tbs. of sesame oil, to improve sesame flavor without so many seeds to deal with. Overall, a good recipe.
