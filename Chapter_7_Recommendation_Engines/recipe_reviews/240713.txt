This is easy and delicious!! I had it as a kid (and it was called "Mock Lasagna" by my mother) but instead of the sprinkled mozzarella, we had 8 pieces of American cheese along the top. Better taste! The cottage cheese really adds a good texture too.

Love this!!  I used Italian Sausage instead of ground beef though, just adds more flavor.  Much easier than assembling the traditional dish.  Also sauteed fresh mushrooms & a chopped green pepper with the onion & garlic, just my personal preference.
