When I make this casserole, I use shredded sharp cheddar instead of Velveeta and I use more butter to drizzle over the top to make the Ritz crackers even more crispy. Always disappears. NOTE: This is good with a broccoli stir fry mix, too.

This is almost the exact recipe I grew up with. Still to this day I crave mom mom's broccoli and cheese casserole. The difference that we do is add 2 eggs beaten, use cream of mushroom soup, 2 tablespoons of sour cream. Cook veggies in microwave for 5... strain.  Then mix it all together and bake for 35 min at 350. It is delicious!

It would have had more flavor with a cheddar cheese instead of processed.

Happy Thanksgiving y'all.... I was searching for a different recipe for this dish rather than the one I had made for years, just for something different. This was one of the dishes I was assigned to bring to our dinner today. After choosing this one I made a trial run of it for dinner last night. Everyone loved it!! Even my 2 yr old Granddaughter who as everyone knows 2yr olds don't like many veggies lol. The only things I changed was I used Chopped Broccoli (easier for my Granddaughter to eat) &  the topping. My family loves the Durky Dried Onions so I topped it with those instead and spritzed them with a little butter . Perfect!! Tysm for sharing this quick & simple recipe !!

This is an update, I have made this many times and it is always a hit. I use the Velveeta reduced fat block cheese and slice about a pound up into one can of Cream of mushroom and one can of Cream of chicken.  Microwave the soup cheese mix until the cheese is melted (about 2 minutes).  Mix well.  I microwave the broccoli florets and just mix them into the soup cheese mixture.  Place in a casserole dish top with Veggie flavored crushed rounds.  I use the butter to drizzle on top and bake for 15 to 20 minutes.  Perfect!!  Thanks for this recipe!

My kids, nor myself eat broccoli but my cousin brought this over and it was a hit.  Not one bite left.  I made it last night and once again, not one bite left.  To the reader asking about adding water, No I just melted the cheese, cream of chicken soup and butter together and then poured over the broccoli and threw it in the over. I used garlic flavored ritz style cracker because that is all I had.  This has to be the easiest dish next to green bean casserole. Good luck and enjoy

Easy and delicious!!! I made this for 2 different Thanksgiving dinners this year. I used 1/2 Velveeta and 1/2 shredded sharp cheddar. So good! Only critique is that it is SUPER cheesy, not that anyone minds, but you could probably add another bag of broccoli if you wanted.

This recipe is really good except I only used half of the cheese it suggested.  If I had used the suggested amount it would have been way too much.

I made this last night for Thanksgiving. It was good but not a keeper for me. I agree with some other reviews that some cheddar cheese might’ve made it better. It was just ok. It was a little too cheesy. I didn’t think that could be a thing! Ha!

This recipe was really easy and delicious. The only thing I will change the next time is I will use 3 bags of broccoli instead of 2. It makes a lot of cheese sauce, there's almost more sauce than broccoli.

It seemed simple and easy enough to try so I did. I didn't have any cream of chicken on hand so substituting cream of celery. Still in the over, will let you know how it turns out.

I made this recipe 3x this holiday season and it was a big hit!  The first time I made it exactly as the recipe stated, but my husband thought it was too cheesy and suggested I add more broccoli next time. The second and third time I did add more broccoli using the same size dish (9x11) but didn't measure what I added. I mixed it with family sized can of 98% fat free cream of mushroom instead (I bought the wrong soup!). I also used 1lb of Velveeta instead of 2 lbs and I did not add the cracker topping. It came out great each time I made it and everyone wanted the recipe. I will be making this over and over again..thank you for sharing :)

Way too much cheese for us. Would maybe like this if the cheese wasn't so thick and it was not Velveeta fake cheese taste.  Will not be making this again.
