Delicious!  Of course, mine looked nothing like the picture, but nevertheless it was so good I couldn't stop eating it.  The creaminess of the cream cheese and the tang of the sundried tomatoes went just perfectly together.  I sprinkled parsley on top and served it with our pasta dinner.  This will definitely be made again in our house, but I may just cut the slices and put the filling on top instead of trying to stuff the slices...much easier and faster!

I hate to say anything bad about a recipe, so I'll just say that I must've messed up somewhere. The cheese spread looked very unappealing.  It tasted good if you can get past that. I don't know what I did wrong. :(
