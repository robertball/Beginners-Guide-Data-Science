Awesome chicken wild rice soup, hubby loved it too. Made a few adjustments: sauteed onion,celery, and shredded carrots in a little evoo, added salt/pepper/dried thyme, added 2 qts of fat free/low sodium chix broth,2 pks. of low sodium chix bouillon, the parsley and garlic powder. I then added 3 chicken breasts cut into bite size and cooked them in the broth mixture, added 1/2c. white wine. Once the chicken was cooked I added 1c. fat free half and half, I thickened the soup with cornstarch and water instead of using the butter roux, I also eliminated the can of mushroom soup. When the soup was thick and creamy, I added a box of cooked wild rice(Uncle Bens). What a delicious soup.....very satisfying. I loved the look of the shredded carrots in the soup, and the chicken was very tender. Will be in my soup rotation for this winter! Thanks.

Make this soup today!  It is simply the best soup I have had in a long, long time.  I made it as per the directions...the only changes I made was: I was out of garlic powder, so I started to use 1/4 tsp garlic salt in place, but then thought that that would not give it quite enough garlic taste, so I added 1/4 tsp minced garlic as well.  And I used a whole bullion cube as I did not have the granulated type.  Also 1 6oz box of Uncle Ben's Wild Rice will give you amount of rice needed for this recipe.  The only changes I will make next time is maybe use more chicken and I will probably cook my chicken first and then cut/tear into smaller pieces (as opposed to cutting and then cooking)....I know this probably will sound crazy, but we prefer the stringier pieces of chicken in soups...just a personal preference.

I made a couple changes with this soup, regarding both cooking AND to make it a little healthier. I took my chicken breasts and cooked them in the crockpot with the (organic) chicken broth, chopped onion/garlic and salt/pepper until the meat was falling apart. When the meat was ready, I sauteed the mushrooms (I doubled the mushrooms), celery, carrots onion and fresh minced garlic in a mix of EVOO and butter before stirring it into the broth and chicken in the crockpot. I took the double concentrated chicken broth and then cooked my rice in the broth before adding it to the crockpot. I didn't need the flour or the bouillion. For the cream of mushroom soup, I used a cup of Imagine's Organic Creamy Mushroom soup. A quarter cup of white wine was just enough for me. After tasting it, I added more spices (garlic powder/onion power/thyme/parsley/turmeric). This soup sat overnight as I made this right before bed so it had a chance to sit overnight and have the flavors meld together. I ate a bowl of this today and right after I warmed it, I sprinkled the bowl of soup with fresh grated parmesan cheese. This was cheap, as it used all ingredients I had on hand, and quite filling. I love recipes like this that are easily bendable to my needs.

I made this soup last night for dinner. My friend was over and she just could not get enough. I paired it up with some crusty french bread, and they were fabulous together. Oh and it was so easy to make. I used a cup more of chicken. I also used fresh chopped garlic and fresh tyme. To cut time I used a package of shredded carrots. I also didn't chop the mushrooms. I kept them a bigger so that my friend who doesnt like mushrooms could avoid them easier.

This soup is absolutely delicious. I have made it four times now, three times exactly as stated, and once with leftover Christmas turkey instead of chicken. My husband and three children (all under the age of eight) love this soup, too. It is so good that I have added it to my menu for all major holidays. I wouldn't change a thing.

This is awesome just as written No need for any modifications. I used a rotisserie chicken from grocery store as the chicken.  One comment though....recipe shows prep time of 10 minutes...it took me a good 30/40 minutes with all the chopping and multiitude of ingredients.

I saute chicken breast, thin sliced, in extra olive oil, very small amt., set aside.  Then saute onions, freshrooms, celery, salt and pepper. I put all this together with a can of chicken broth, and let cook for about 10 min.  I soaked the wild rice as I started this, I add the rice to broth, and let cook on low until I add the half/half milk, just before serving.  I serve with a sprinkle of cheddar cheese on top, my family and friends love this dish.

I used a cup of fresh parsley rather than dried, 3 cloves of minced fresh garlic rather than powder, added some fresh ground pepper, an extra can of mushroom soup, an extra cup of rice, and used an entire roasted chicken. Everyone loved it, even the little kids! Thanks!!!!!!

The execution of this recipe as directed is unusual, boiling the vegetables, for instance, rather than sweating them and proceeding with the recipe, which is what I did.  The chicken bouillon granules wouldn't contribute much beyond salt, so I left it out.  Similarly, dried parsley wouldn't contribute much either, save for a little color.  I skipped that too, and used fresh Italian parsley.  Fresh garlic and  thyme filled in for the garlic powder and dried thyme called for.  For added flavor, as well the long grain rice it includes, I used a box of Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice.I did choose to add the white wine. This is not a spectacular soup as written, tho' it is much improved with some small changes.  It's a satisfying soup that should appeal to most tastes.

Excellent!  I had some leftover chicken from the Roast Sticky Chicken recipe on this site and some mushrooms that I needed to use (only 1/4 lb.), so I decided to give this a try.  I was very pleased with the result.  The only change I made was that I didn't add the additional 1/2 c. of wine or chicken broth at the end, because I prefer a thicker soup.  I will make this again.

Excellent soup!  I had to substitute plain white rice due to a friend with a restricted diet, but otherwise, this made a delicious soup.  The flavors & seasonings were perfect.

This was the best soup I have ever made (maybe even eaten).  It is getting rainy and colder now and was a great comfort food as well as something that really hit the spot.  I did use 1/2 of a can of Family Size Cream of Mushroom soup, added salt and pepper to taste, some Tony's, and little more chicken broth (about another 2 cups total.) I also added about 3 cloves of fresh garlic, chopped. I served it with a simple dinner salad and crackers and still have enough left over for our family of six.  Note: My picky 6 year old daughter liked it with and without the wild rice.  Hope you enjoy our new "Keeper".

LOVE LOVE LOVE this soup! I stayed pretty true to the recipes flavor although I do use fresh garlic in addition to the garlic powder and more of the herbs than called for, the flavor combination is right on but we prefer our foods a bit more heavily seasoned. Where I do deviate is with the condensed soup, I don't use it, I prefer not to cook with canned foods that are loaded with sodium and preservatives. What I do is make the roux of equal parts butter and flour (1/2 C. and 1/2 C.)and cook it whisking constantly for a few minuets to cook out the raw flour taste. After a few minuets I whisk in the white wine AND some of the chicken broth from already cooking pot and I bring to a strong simmer/low boil stirring until thickened. At this point I add it to the big pot along with the chicken and cook. I dish up any of the soup that will be going into the freezer and set aside. For the part of the soup that I will be serving this is when I replace the condensed soup with heavy cream or half and half or even just milk which add the creaminess the soup would have and heat until hot but without letting it come to a boil. It will be thick enough since the roux was made with more flour/butter than the original recipe calls for. When defrosting the soup that went into the freezer I add the dairy as it's re-heating. Works out perfectly!

Made this soup today and it's very good! I actually just threw everything in the crock pot (uncooked rice, cooked and shredded rotisserie chicken, then all the veggies and spices and broth and cream of mushroom soup) and let it cook on low all day. There was absolutely no need to thicken it with the roux (and I was happy to leave out that extra fat!) - the rice thickened it beautifully in the slow cooker. I actually ended up adding more broth near the end, as it was almost too thick! Nice flavor and hearty soup. Will make again.

I love this recipe. The first time I made it was from the Taste of Home cookbook, I was thrilled then and I'm still thrilled about this soup. The only thing different I do is add 10oz, of cream instead of a can of cream of mushroom soup.

Hearty and delicious! Through a shopping error we only had boneless thighs on hand. The extra flavor (gamey-ness) of the thighs really complimented the herbs and veggies even though we're strictly a chicken breast type family. I used leeks because we had them and omitted the creamy soup and it turned out fantastic. We'll make this again and again.

Great soup.  I used a rotisserie chicken which is a great short cut.  I also cooked the veggies in olive oil then added the flour and chicken broth and the soup thickened nicely.  I also added the rice uncooked and just added extra chicken broth this way it was a one pot soup.  Instead of the bouillon I used the flavor packet from the Uncle Ben's wild and long grain rice original.  It gave the soup a great flavor.

Very yummy.  Used Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice b/c I couldn't find wild rice alone.  I'd probably attempt to find the rice for the next time but I made this pretty much on the spur of the moment.  Forgot to add the Cream of Chicken but I doubt it really changed anything.  Very yummy.  Didn't take long to prepare but only b/c I used a Pampered Chef chopper for all of the veggies.

•	WOW!!!!! I doubled the recipe. I cooked the chicken in a yellow mild curry, added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, 2 Tbs of prepared minced garlic and ¼ tsp of Johnny’s Seasoning salt. At the time of serving add Chili Garlic Sauce (Tu’o’ng O’T To”I Viet-Nam) to taste. This is a fantastic soup that everyone loved. A must try!!!!

I modified this recipe a little.  I left out the flour, wine, and cream of mushroom soup (to reduce calories).  I didn't have enough wild rice, so I mixed wild rice with basmati.  I used fresh garlic and parsley instead of dried.  I sweated the vegetables in olive oil before adding to the soup.  I used chicken thighs which I roasted in the oven with salt and pepper.  The soup turned out excellent!  I wrote down the recipe and will be using it again!

Used what I had on hand, sauteed veggies first, and let the rice cook (prior to thickening) along with other ingredients while the soup simmered.  I used a mix of wild and brown rice - tried alone with just broth after rice cooked and not impressed.  Added a couple of Tablespoons of cream of mushroom soup as I was starving and what a difference.  Delicious!  I don't like using canned items and as I never got around to adding the roux, next time will try the roux in leu of the cream/mushroom soup.  The nuttiness of the rice is a lovely addition - thanks so much for recipe!

The only thing I did different was salute the veggies first and then followed the recipe! It is a really good soup.

Very good. I use a 6oz box of Uncle Bens wild rice. I also add chopped garlic, thyme, and a bit more chicken. Thanks.

I have made this soup several times, sometimes with the mushrooms, sometimes without (my son hates them) and when no mushrooms I used cream of celery soup. It is delicious and I think I may even like it better with cream of celery. 
I also have used just plain rice as well when I didn't have wild, and that was also good. 
This is my go to soup when I have left over chicken when we buy the whole chicken and I make my own broth from the bones. 
A must try recipe and works well with substitutions.

My expectations were high with this recipe after reading all the great reviews, it was good, but not quite a 5 star (although my husband seemed to like it more than I did).  I made it as directed using Uncle Ben's wild rice mix and shredding the chicken instead of leaving it in chunks.  It didn't  thicken up the way I expected (maybe I messed up the roux), I think next time I'll just leave that part out because all  it did was add more fat.  End result wasn't as creamy as I expected, but the flavor was good.  Served it with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and crackers.  Will probably make again, overall a nice change of pace from my standard chicken noodle soup.

It was like gravy! Definitely not a "soup" recipe. If you want a thick stew that is literally the consistency of a thick gravy, this is your dish.

The leftovers in the fridge the next day were repulsive. A thick layer of fat on the top. I should've known better with all that butter and the addition of flour.

Yummy soup.  Didn't change a thing.  Not as thick as I would like so I'll probably add a little more thickener next time.

Needed more spices so I almost doubled all the spices and added a few of my own. Other than that it was great.

Very tasty broth and good flavor.  I didn't add the cream of mushroom soup at all.  The only reason not getting 5 stars is it was too thick.  Next time I will omit the butter/flour.  Doesn't need it will all the rice.

I didn't have the same veggies on hand so I threw in a package of frozen onions/green and red peppers instead. And I had beef instead of chicken broth. But we still all loved it! If you like wild rice, I think you'll love this. We'll definitely be making it again!

While I did not think that this was 'to die for' recipe it was very good and I will make it often. I wish I could give this 4&1/2 stars (I reserve 5 stars for 'to die for' recipes) but this was better than a 4. For time saving reason I put all of the veggies I was going to cut up into the food processor at one time and chopped into largish chunks (1/2"), sauted them in a little olive oil until onions were transparent and added them to the pot with the other ingredients and cooked until veggies were done. Good comfort food.

My husband and I both enjoyed this soup very much.  I had a bag of brown rice on hand, so I decided to use that instead of buying wild rice.  It was still very good, but I want to try it with the wild next time.  Otherwise, I made the soup as the recipe was written.  As everyone has said, it takes a while to chop and prep the ingredients, but I enjoy that sort of thing.  It is very mushroomy, so I may leave out the mushroom soup or add cream of chicken instead when I make it again.  I needed to add extra broth as it was very thick.  The white wine is a delicious touch.

Very good soup.  Made it exactly as directed, created my own chicken broth by boiling chicken breasts and thighs with some onion, celery and spices.  The only thing I don't love is the gelatinous quality of the cream of mushroom soup.  I think next time I'll try to make it with milk or cream instead.

This soup wasn't amazing, but wasn't bad either. I made it exactly as the recipe specified, except I used cornstarch instead of flour to thicken. It wasn't super flavorful, but was a good base recipe. I think part of the reason I didn't think it was great was because the wild rice I used got a little mushy even before I added it to the soup. Next time, I'll make the wild rice with less water so it is a little crunchy before adding it to the soup, and then add some more spices to kick it up.

I loved this recipe.  I added a little zip to it by adding about 1/8 teaspoon or less of tarragon to it.  I also never use "cream of anything" cans of soup.  Instead, I tripled the butter and flour, cooked it until it lightly tanned (creamy looking to a light brown) and then added the chicken broth while it was still simmering stirring quickly while it thickened a little.

This is such a good fall soup!!!  I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, which made it super easy and delicious having breast & leg meat.  Also subbed a frozen Dorot garlic cube (TJs) for garlic powder... LOVE those things!  I realized as I was serving it up that I'd forgotten to add the can of soup!  HAD planned on using an organic cream of chicken soup... don't like condensed red-label kind... icky, and chock full of sodium and msg!  But it was PERFECT without it, so I don't even know if it's necessary.  I like very flavorful food, and was worried I would need to spice this up a bit when I read the simplicity of the ingredients in the recipe, but the combination of it all produces a wonderful, flavorful, hearty soup that is perfect as is!  Next time I think I'll cook the veg 20 mins instead of 30 though.  In fall/winter I make a vat of soup/stew/chili once a week and we eat it for 2-3 days... This one's gonna be a regular for sure!!!

Excellent flavor, excellent texture. I brought it for my church's potluck lunch, and many people asked for the recipe so I led them to this web site! I didn't have mushrooms, so I left them out. But followed the recipe to the "T," and my husband said, "you can definitely make this again!" Thanks!

This was a good recipe.  I made the soup using a different process.  I made my own broth with the chicken used to make this soup.  Next time I make this, I plan to make the chicken more flavorful before mixing with the soup.

The white wine added a lovely flavoring to the soup. I used brown rice instead - still turned out delicious. Also, used about a tablespoon of half and half per bowl when serving. Great recipe. Thanks.

Tried to make this soup and ended up being so thick that it started sticking to the bottom of pot. Even tried adding up to 4 cups more broth and the soup stuck so bad that it had a scorched taste.

This soup is wonderful!  I sometimes change the bird to pheasant and it still turns out great.  I do add more meat than it calls for.   This recipe will be with me for years to come.

Excellent recipe! The third time around I did make a few changes.  I redacted the mushrooms, used homemade chicken broth and added two cloves of garlic.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this tonight, it's a cool fall evening and it was wonderful. I added parsnips and I like to keep the vegis larger cut but other than that followed the recipe and it was wonderful. Oh, and I used leftover roasted rosemary chicken. Paired with the rosemary biscuits on this site which were also wonderful. Will make again but I have a ton of soup left. Keeper for sure!

Extremenly delicious! Changes: Chopped carrots instead of shredding. Could not find granules, so I used a cube. Left out thyme. Used broth intstead of wine. Used Uncle Ben's Wild Rice. I shredded the chicken. Personal preference. I salted to taste after all ingredients were married. I will definately make this soup again.

Fabulous soup! I had to use cream of chicken soup, because that was all I had, and I used lemon-flavored white cooking wine and a brown and wild rice blend.  I shredded a plain rotisserie chicken.  Next time I will use a lemon-pepper rotissserie chicken and use 2 cups rice and 3 cups chicken, just to see how it turns out.  Good job Virginia!

This was delicious! My husband complimented me on it all night. The only change I made was that I didn't use mushrooms (because my husband isn't a big fan of them). I substituted cream of chicken because it's all I had in the pantry. Delicious!

Amazing. Only thing I did differently was instead of making a roux, i added a little bit of half and half. I absolutely love this soup. Perfect for a snow day.

I was really disappointed.  I followed the recipe to the "T" and after all that work was really surprised at how bland it was.  There was a bunch left over because nobody was crazy about it.  By the next day the rice had absorbed most of the liquid.  I mixed in some chopped up some chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and topped it with a little mexican cheese.  It did wonders.

Excellent.   I rarely opt for low sodium choices; however, I will use a low sodium cream of chicken and and broth.  As written, it was a little over salted but excellent.  Only other change for our family was the omission of thyme - we aren't fans of that flavor.  Other than that - made as written and EXCELLENT!

Flavour is great, but because it is really greasy with this amount of roux for this amount of soup, I have to give it a 3.

Good soup.  Butter/flour roux mix not necessary - just sift the flour into the soup toward the end.  Shredded chicken much better texture-wise than cubed.  If you cook up 1 c of wild rice - you'll get anywhere between 3 to 4 cups worth.  Dump all the rice in the soup - this will only make it heartier!

This soup is DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfect! It made a LOT of soup, so my husband and I ate it for several days in a row (but it was so good, we didn't mind). :) Thank you for a delicious, easy-to-follow recipe.

3 stars from me, 4 from my famliy.  This was tasty, in fact my family liked it A LOT.  But if I'm going to slice & dice fresh vegis, roast a chicken & cook wild rice, I do not want to add a CAN of condensed soup  to it!

Very delicious, very nutricious!  I'm not sure I prepared the margarine, flour and cream of mushroom mixture exactly as directed, but the final product had great flavor.  I will definitely add this to the regular recipe rotation.

This was good.. however, after adding the cream of much soup, i felt it tasted more like that, than chicken.. so then i added a can of cream of chicken and more water to override the flavor. Next time i will just use cream of chicken!

I've never been able to make soup very well, but I followed this recipe pretty closely and it turned out pretty good!  I made a few minor tweaks:  sauteeing the vegetables ahead of time, and adding frozen corn and frozen string beans because I love vegetables, and using low-sodium chicken broth.  It turned out a little bland to me (maybe because of the low-sodium broth) so I added some garlic salt and Accent.    This is a very hearty yummy soup and I will definitely make it again.  A word of caution for planning purposes:  The cook time for this says 40 minutes and the prep time says 10 minutes, but I think that assumes you already have the rice prepared and the chicken cleaned, chopped, and cooked.

Made this a gluten free version.....no chicken bouillon granules, no cream of mushroom soup, and no flour.  Instead.  Used half chicken stock and half chicken broth for the soup base.  For the creamy texture added 2 cups of heavy whipping cream, and 3 tablespoons of cornstarch for the thickening agent.   Let the whole thing return to boil before adding in 4 cups of chicken and a mixture of jasmine and minnesota wild rice (1:1 ratio).   Family loved this mild but rewarding flavored soup.  Best of all, being a person suffering from Celiacs disease, I also was able to eat this with the family!

Restaurant quality! I made a lower sodium version and it turned out great.  Sauteed veggies in no salt butter before adding to low sodium broth.  I cooked the chicken breast and wild rice (separately of course) in the low sodium broth as well and eliminated the boulion.  The mushroom soup was also low-fat-low sodium.  We did not miss the salt at all in this soup!

Fantastic!  Instead of chopping up all those veggies, I used a bag of frozen "soup" veggies.  I through them and my raw chicken breasts into the pot with the stock and seasonings and cooked it until the chicken was shreddable.  I threw the rice in there too and cooked it until it was done.  I followed the rest of the recipe as is.  So creamy and rich!  We LOVED it!

I didn't alter the ingredients at all.  I did double the recipe, cooked the chicken & rice in the broth.  I used Chardonnay at the end of the recipe because I had it on hand.  I have to say...I've made alot of different soups and this is by far the best one yet! I can't wait for my husband to get home and have some!  He's gonna love it!!!

This made my one-year-old say "mmmmm!" after every bite! It is also one of my husband's favorite meals. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find wild rice since moving to California so I had to make this with white rice.

I made this recipe and followed every single step.  I didnt love it, there wasnt enough flavor for me.  Its "good" but it had no WOW factor or anything that made me want to make this recipe again. Its missing a key spice that would make it taste exceptional.

This is delicious!   I made it pretty much according to the recipe, except that I sauteed the vegetables in olive oil before adding the chicken broth.  Everybody loved it, I was counting on leftovers and had none.  Definitely a keeper.

Although I love fresh mushrooms, our four year old doesn't so I omitted them.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I did saute the onion & celery in butter. So I added a little less butter in the final step.  I also used a white & wild rice mixture (plain, not the kind with seasonings).This is comfort food at its best, very mild and pleasing.  Plan to serve it tomorrow for company (so I haven't added the rice to the entire batch yet.

This soup is delicious!! I cooked the chicken and rice (half wild half white rice) beforehand then combined all ingredients and simmered on the stove for 2-3 hours. I'm terrible at making soups so i was pleased this came out so good. I added extra of everything which resulted in a large batch, im happy my husband and I can enjoy this soup for a few days. Oh, i also added some bay leaves and savory spice

This is so good.  I changed it up a bit, using less chicken broth so it was thicker.  I also used closer to 4 cups chicken.  Then I switched the fresh mushrooms to just a small can of them...we're not huge mushroom fans here.  Everyone loved it, I made it for 5 adults and 2 kids (ages 7 and 2) and it was gone at the end of dinner!  So be aware it may not serve 14.  Also you can use half white rice if you want to and it still tastes great.  All in all a fantastic recipe I'll use again and again!

Excellent recipe for turkey and wild rice soup as well.  We use the leftover Thanksgiving turkey carcass to make the broth in place of the chicken, broth, and bouillon in this recipe.

We enjoyed this. I'd make it again. I sauteed the veggies in butter and then added the flour and broth, etc(Didn't want to wash another pan) I had cooked chicken from a previous meal so that was handy. My husband said it needed punched up a bit. But it was a good comfort food meal.

Excellent!!! Have made this MANY times. The soup is easy and delicious. I use a lot of extra chicken. I boil the chicken in the chicken broth and then shred it with two forks. I also add a little heavy cream at the end. It adds a nice touch to the taste and consistency.

OMG I made this soup for the first time and I will be saving this recipe. I made no changes and the smell and the taste was amazing. This is a soup that has lots of broth. Can't wait to make it again.

My family loves this!  I have 3, 6, and 10 yr old boys and they request it!  The first time I made it I followed the directions exactly except for sauteeing my vegetable in EVOO before boiling.  We really enjoyed it but hubby likes a brothier soup so the next time I omitted the flour butter thickner and opted for more broth to suit his taste and it was just as good.  No complaints!

This is really good.  I love a soup that has a lot of texture and this definitely has that.  I used 2 cans of cooked wild rice that I found at my grocery store so this saved time.  I also used a rotisserie chicken from the store - it had great flavor and didn't shred apart.  My family loved it!

This soup is absolutely amazing. My husband and I both love it (and he can be kinda picky)! The only thing that I do differently is that I usually cook the rice in the soup. I wouldn't recommend doing it that way as the rice sucks up most of the broth, so it loses the 'soupy' consistency, but hubby prefers it that way for some reason. Also, I omit the mushrooms (we really don't eat them) and use cream of celery soup in place of cream of mushroom. I frequently make chicken dishes with cream of celery and I think they go great together, so I wasn't disappointed using this in the soup. Anyways, this is by far one of my favorite recipes, but prep time can take a while, with all the vegetable chopping and what not.

this was great!  Very easy to fix....i did sautee the onions, garlic, carrots, and then mushrooms in oil/butter first.  Then added the chicken and stock along with seasonings.  My kids loved it too!

Made some changes cause I am not a big cream of mushroom soup person. I made my own chicken broth and added lots of fresh sage and thyme from my garden than strained and left it overnight in the frig. so the chicken fat can be scrapped off the top the next day.  Used fresh pressed garlic and cooked it a bit with the caramelized onions. Added three cups or more mushroom and lots more chicken. It was a lot better the next day with a little 1/2 and 1/2 cream.

I substituted Yellow Squash and Corn instead of Carrots and Celery - delicious!  Oh, and I forgot the bouillon, so I had the Uncle Ben's Wild Rice with Mushroom as my rice and it was not really needing the bouillon in the end.

This soup is fabulous.  I'm not a fan of chicken soup, but we had some sick house guests, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was a nice, thick consistency, and is full of flavor.  The wild rice adds a lot.  My husband and I are actually enjoying all the leftovers, rather than feeling obligated to eat them.   I did make some small changes based on other reviews and what I had on hand:  I cooked the chicken in a little EVOO after salting and peppering it, then removed and cooked the veggies (including 2 garlic cloves finely cut) in the EVOO for a bit before adding the broth.  I did not have 2 qts chicken broth; I used a mixture of low sodium chicken (16oz), veggie and beef broth (1 qt) to reach the 2qts.   I did not have cream of mushroom, so I used 98% fat free cream of chicken.  I also shredded the chicken before adding back into the soup.  Awesome recipe.

Phenomenal - I have made it three times and am making it again tomorrow!  The only change I made was substituting about 1/8 cup corn starch for the can of cream of mushroom the first and third times.  It was MUCH better with the corn starch.  With the cream of mushroom instead, it separated a lot more after storing the leftovers for a day or two.  I also shredded the chicken instead of cubing it.

This soup is DELISH. Wanting to avoid unnecessary fat in the soup I followed the directions exactly through the dried thyme, but then all I did was add a pinch of flour and baking soda to thicken it up a bit and added a 15 oz box of vegetable medley broth ( its just a little thicker than normal broth). NO cream of mushroom ( gross and fatty) and NO margarine necessary. I through two raw chicken breast into the soup, let them cook all the way through ( 30 min), cut them up and put them back in. I through the rice in after the vegetables were soft and chicken cooked through ( 40 min).   I also added corn to give it more color : ) I give this soup to people when they are ill. Its a hit!

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! Perfect warm up for winter! The ONLY thing I did differently was double the cream of mushroom soup. Also- next time I will add more mushrooms and possibly artichokes. It was an easy, but timely recipe to follow. I've never made soup before and it's the best I've ever tasted!

I made this for our halloween themed teacher's luncheon as chicken and "larvae" soup. It was a huge hit! I eliminated the mushrooms and used cream of chicken soup but otherwise made it as written. Loved it!

This recipe is fantastic!  I made a few adjustments that worked well.  I used 3 cups of chicken from a rotisserie chicken and increased the vegetables slightly.  Instead of the wine or broth, I added an additional can of cream of mushroom soup to make a thicker soup.  The soup was mushroomy tasting at first, but I didn't serve it until the next day.  By then the flavors had blended and tasted really good.    The prep time was definitely more than 10 minutes to cut up the chicken and chop the vegetables.  It was more like 45 minutes for me.  I made the chicken broth using chicken bullion cubes, which I added to my ingredient list.  Overall, this recipe was delicious and had many favorable comments on it.  Thanks!

I loved this soup! First time trying a cream of chicken with wild rice. YUM! I totally recommend using fresh garlic and frying it with onions in butter first. I also loved the white wine in the soup. this soup smells so good!  Two thumbs up!!!

I absolutely LOVE this soup. I made it for my husband when he was sick and it was a hit. I did use some of the other user suggestions.. I didn't add the 1/2 lb of mushrooms (not big mush fans), I used cornstarch instead of the butter to thicken it, and I put in more chicken (shreaded not cubed) SO delicious. I'll be making it many times this winter.

My mom and I just canned chicken and I decided to look for a good chicken and rice soup recipe.  I made this last night and I must say it is a winner!  Very delicious and hearty without feeling too heavy.  It is flavorful and just plain delightful!  I will be making this all through the winter.

This soup was delicious!!!  However I did make some changes.   I sauted the ingredients with butter, salt & pepper instead of the chicken bouillon before boiling.  I used fresh garlic & parsley, used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom soup (as another used suggested) and added Uncle Ben's seasoned wild rice.  My girls & husband loved it!!!  Will definitely keep this recipe.

I added a big handful of fresh spinach and did not do the butter flour roux...didn't see the need. I used a teaspoon of FRESH thyme. I loved this very much and it's only about 100 calories a cup this way. Delish!

Sauteed the veggies with a clove of garlic in a bit of olive oil before adding to the soup. Used 6 cups of chicken broth and added 1/2 cup of half & half for a bit of creaminess! Yummy!

This was excellent as is. I followed the recipe exactly (adapted for crock pot), and my family loved it, including my husband who is  not a big fan of soup in general.

I made this recipe last night after searching for a healthy chicken and rice soup.  I wanted something more than a clear broth and thought this was perfect.  Well it was!  I did make some changes, I did saute the veggies in butter with fresh garlic and then added the broth and seasons.  I didnt use the roux, and just added cream of celery soup (I didnt have cream of mush).  I omitted the wine/broth becasue it was thick enough at this point.    Great soup with some crusty bread.  Also reheats really well the next day!

This has slowly become one of my favourite soups of all time. Generally instead of cubed chicken, i'll throw all of this in a crock pot with four thighs, and cool it all together for more flavour. Instead of adding more chicken broth at the end in the mixture, i use sour cream. Givin' it that ol' hungarian flare. So hearty, so good.

We've made this several times and it's our favorite wild rice soup recipe. My husband always asks me to double it so that we can freeze the leftovers and always have plenty on hand! We usually add just a little Velveeta to thicken it up a bit... otherwise I follow the recipe as written. Delicious!

Really good....although I did change it. I didn't use the butter/flour combo but instead used arrowroot w/ water. It does the same thing for thickening but without all the fat and calories. I only used three cups of wild rice and thought it was perfect, with three I think it would overpower the soup. I also added a can of FF evaporated milk at the end to give it the creamy taste and didn't add the cream of mushroom soup. Even with all the changes I made it was still good and would have been better with the full fat ingredients!

Healthy Eater Modification ;-)  This recipe was great!  Although, I did change it up a little bit.  I try to eat healthy so I opted not to add the butter, flour, or cream of mushroom soup to this recipe.    I also started out by sauteing 2 cloves of garlic and the onion in Extra Virgin Olive Oil  (just a tad)  then added the rest of my veggies and cooked for about 10 minutes.  From there i added the veggies and a bay leaf to the broth and then deglazed my pan with wine and added that to the broth too.  Simmered all of that for 30 minutes then added in the cooked chicken and cooked rice.  (I found making the rice packets before hand, like Carolina Long Grain Wild Rice With Seasonings, work best. The rice doesn't get mushy)  I feel better about eating the modified version of the soup because it is packed full of good for you veggies!

I'm still not sure where the flavor of this soup comes from but it is definitely one of my favorites.  I have not used entirely all wild rice but the combo I can get in bulk at the store but it works!

I was hoping this would be like the creamy chicken and wild rice from Panera. It wasn't, but I was pleasantly surprised. I seasoned the chicken lightly with rosemary and garlic. It was a hit!

Very good!!  Will definitely make again!  I doubled the garlic and added about a 1/2 tsp of basil and a little celery salt & pepper.  Also, I used regular brown rice because I didn't have any wild rice on hand.

This soup is delicious! To cook the chicken, I boiled four breasts with a whole onion, quartered, 3 cloves of garlic, 2 celery stalks, and salt and pepper. I also added poultry seasoning and used half and half in place of the cream of mushroom soup. Turned out thick and creamy- just perfect!

This soup was a BIG winner for my family.  I had my kids going back for seconds and thirds!  We all loved it.  The only think I did different than the recipe was that I did not buy premade chicken broth, I made my own.  I cooked the chicken I would use for this recipe several hours before making the soup and made a wonderful homemade broth to start my soup with.  By doing this I cut down on the sodium contained in the store bought broth (considering you already get some with the cream of mushroom soup they ask you to add also), plus I just think it tasted better anyway.  I will use this recipe over and over again.

Very good!  I did not have any wild rice, so used regular rice, and cut up baby carrots in place of the shredded, and it was delicious.  I am just getting over the flu and my daughter is just coming down with it, so this was perfect!

This recipe was very tasty and had a strong mushroom flavor, which I liked. I would suggest substituting a can of cream of chicken or cream of celery soup for the mushroom soup if you do not want mushroom to be a predominant flavor.

This soup is perfect in every way. The flavors all combine nicely and each bite is better than the previous. I personally made no changes as I feel all recipes given to me should at least be tried at face value before altering in any way. My wife practically licked the bowl and I found myself thinking about doing the same. 5 Stars!

Surprisingly delicious.  We're not huge mushroom fans so the amount of mushrooms scared me, but it was fabulous.  I added an additional 1/2 cup of carrots and celery and left the chicken very chunky.  Yummy!

This soup was exactly what I was looking for.  A bit creamy but not too thick.  Like some of the other reviewers, I also sauteed my veggies (onion, mushrooms, carrots and celery) and herbs in a bit of olive oil before adding the broth.  I will definitely make this again.

This is what I make when it starts feeling like winter! I'm always so excited to put it all together and enjoy that first soothing spoonful on a cold day. I skip the bouillon and add Tony's seasoning, instead to give it a little something extra. This is my absolute favorite soup!

Very good. I lived in Minnesota for 3 years and this was very similar to my favorite restaurant in Cloquet.  I didn't have thyme so I used tarragon (and a little too much) so it had a strange after taste.  Next time I will use the thyme and I'm sure it will be perfect.  My picky 15 year old son even loved it.

Loved this! I made the chicken and broth using a recipe from this site. Otherwise, followed this receipe almost exactly and it turned out perfectly! I did add a little salt since I used homemade stock. This was hearty and satisfying and loved that it is healthy. This will be a staple in our home.

Awesome recipe!  I have trouble making "good" soup, so I tried this, followed the recipe pretty exact, and got rave reviews about it.

This soup was fantastic.  It was very thick and hearty.  With some crusty bread, it makes a great meal on a cold day.

I added a little salt and pepper to taste, but didn't change anything else.

I hate to say this because of all the great reviews... I was not bad it just was not the kind of wild rice soup I was expecting... it was very thin. Good taste but I really wanted a creamy soup.

Yum!! reminds me of home... I used crimini mushrooms, but they overpowered the delicate flavor of wild rice. Also, if you are in a rush, Trader Joe's has precooked wild rice and chicken cubes.

This soup is WONDERFUL!  I didn't measure anything, just threw it all in and it was delicious.  I used leftover chicken from a whole chicken I baked a couple of days earlier (made the stock out of the bones) and I cooked the rice two days prior also.  My husband who doesn't really like a lot of chicken and certainly isn't all that fond of soup said he would give it 4 stars - that is amazing!  I used lots and lots of mushrooms.  I will be making this again and again, thanks!

Fantastic recipe.  I have been trying to find a good Wild Rice soup recipe like I would find in Minnesota (as we vacation there every summer) - and I think this is it.   I didn't have wine, but would love to try that variation next time.... instead I added a can of broth instead of the 1/2 cup.   It could use a little pepper.

I made this soup today and it is wonderful! I do not even like soup, but my husband does, so I made it and I actually had seconds.  It is a treat on a cold winter's night- Plus it made enough for me to freeze and I am going to have friends over next weeekend to enjoy it with us.
