The soup was wonderful.  Easy to make.  The whole family loved it.  I did make a minor change to the recipe- I used 6 beef bones and the meat from them instead of 3. Great on a cold day!

This reminded me of the simple way of life and cooking in Kazakhstan, when we were there in 2000 to adopt.

The soup is great.

My whole family loved this recipe.  It is very bland until you add the chili sauce.  I used regular chili sauce instead of hot and was generous with it.  I used about one third of the 12 ounce bottle.  It tasted great!

Very flavorful soup.

Has anyone tried making a stock out of meat instead?

Simple to make but I found it bland.  I added way more salt than I thought I would to make it appealing.  I would maybe add salt to the bone broth as it is reducing next time.

Loved this soup- I have been searching for something to do with all of the extra soup bones we get and nothing has been good so far. The directions were easy to follow and the end result was perfect with bread on a chilly day. I have actually never had kraut in a soup before- I can't believe how good it was. Thank you for sharing!
