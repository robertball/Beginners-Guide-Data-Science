I added some extras to the recipe and it turned out great!  I actually used a mixture of shredded Cheddar & Monterey Jack cheese, regular nonfat milk instead of evaporated and added some green onions and precooked bacon pieces at the end. Great recipe!

This recipe was great. i used it on a night when I had chicken breasts but did not want to fry and too hot to bake. I used shredded white/cheddar cheese mix. I also seasoned the chicken very well before browning, which will come off into the soup mix when i put it in the skillet. I also cut up green onion to sprinkle on top for the last few miniutes as garnishment. Cream of mushroom is bland so definite recommend seasoning your chicken very well before browning and put black pepper in the soup mix to balance out the salt I used on the chicken. Very tasty. I will defeinitely make again.

This recipe was so nice and EASY!  Just what a college student like myself is looking for!  I made half of this recipe and added mushrooms (plus another piece of cheese) and put it over noodles and it was WONDERFUL!  Definitely one I will make again and again!

This was good, although I did modify it.  I used a shredded cheddar/white cheese mix and added rice into the mixture, although it could have easily been cooked separately then topped with the chicken.  Overall a good recipe.

This was a very simple and good recipe.  I pounded out the chicken breast and dipped them in egg and bread crumbs and fried them in a little olive oil.  I made the sauce as the recipe called for and added a little white wine.  Very delicious and simple.

Rich and creamy...  Followed the recipe closely, just added extra spices to chicken (onion and garlic powder, Spike salt substitute).  Also added some peas to soup/cheese mixture for color/veggies.  Be sure to let it simmer for a few extra minutes to allow sauce to thicken.  Mmmmmm!!!

WOW I have been on this site and a mbr since 2004 and never wrote a review but once I tried this recipe, I had to write something... ITS AWESOME. So easy and boyyyy was that gravy you cook the chicken in (the cheese and soup) was to die for. I wanted a straw to just drink it, it was that good :) I did add a can of mushrooms to the recipe but otherwise I went right off what was written to do and it was sooo easy and a def REDO :) Thanks Diane for posting this.

I used chicken tenderloins and cut them into about 1 inch pieces so they'd cook a little faster.  I added some salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder as they were browning.  I used a tad more American cheese and threw in a handful of shredded mozzarella that was left over in the fridge.  I served it over brown rice.  The whole family enjoyed it.  I used reduced fat cream of mushroom soup and fat free evaporated milk.

3 1/2 - 4 stars. I did as suggested above and added some canned mushrooms and served over rice. I nice little meal that will probably hit everyone's taste preferences. Cheese, mushrooms, chicken. What's not to like?

Easy and cheesy.  I seasoned my chicken with Mrs. Dash while browning.  Gave it a nice flavor.  My picky son even ate it!  Served it over Minute Rice.

My family loved this, added peas, garlic and chili powder to the browning chicken and even the fussy teenager asked if I would make it again. Once I came out of shock I said I would, couldn't believe that he liked something that didn't come wrapped in a pizza pop!

This was very tasty and my husband asked me to add to our regular menu.  I made several changes only because it was what I had available. I cut my chicken in to big cubes.  Used cream of chicken soup, a small can of mushrooms and about a 1/4 cup of sour cream.   I used non fat milk instead of the evaporated.  Also used a good amount of cheddar cheese in lieu of American.   I will make this again and add chives and bacon next time.  Yummy!

My 3 year old twins, 6 year old and 8 year old kids all loved this.  So did my husband who eats like a toddler!  Thank you Thank you Thank you.  I added seasoned salt to the chicken breasts, used 4 oz velveeta in place of the american slices, and served it over egg noodles.  Fabulous family friendly meal :)

My family enjoyed this.  I used skim evaporated milk, cream of mushroom soup with garlic, and shredded cheddar cheese.  It turned out good! Next time I will make mashed potatoes to go with because the gravy would be fabulous on it.

This was sensational; voted a keeper by all of us.  I browned the chicken in a little butter and sprinkled it with garlic salt and pepper. I mixed 1 cup cheddar cheese in place of the American.  Simmered a half hour. Delicious!

Yummy chicken, really good gravy. I usually try and add my veggies into a meal like this but served with roasted potatoes and steamed broccoli we could top everything with the delicious sauce. I did take a shortcut and use a can of cream of cheddar soup instead of the mushroom, then omitted the cheese. I also peppered this with black and cayenne to make a spicy dish, but that's our preference. I will definitely make this quick dinner again, thanks so much for sharing.

This has to be so bad for you... but it really is tasty!  I added some additional water to the soup and stirred in a box of instant hash brown potatos which soaked up most of the gravy as they cooked.  My husband loved it!

This was ok---chicken was moist, I used low fat cream of mushroom soup and fat free evap milk.  I think i had the heat on too high as it didn't turn out as creamy as I thought it should be.

I used cream of chicken since I like it better than cream of mushroom.  This was an easy and tasty chicken dish and I will be making again.

I knew this sounded too easy to be good.  I used the basic recipe, but made lots of changes after tasting the sauce.  I did cook chicken in the skillet, but I seasoned them with parsley, season salt, and added garlic before hand with olive oil.  I cooked the sauce seperately in a saucepan but used Velveeta cheese, 2% milk, parsley, golden mushroom soup,and then added some Italian dressing mix.

A great, easy meal for weeknights. I added more spices to my chicken, as mentioned in some previous comments. Served over rice, and went great with some steamed broccoli! Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

Wow.  I don't know how something so simple and EASY can be so tasty!  I used colby jack cheese, non-fat cream of chicken and served over brown rice.  There were NO leftovers.  :)

I loved how easy this was, even my fussy husband liked. It works good with regular milk if you dont have the evaporated. I also added mushrooms and a little bit of garlic powder and pepper.

I didn't have time to brown the chicken or thaw it or to be in the kitchen very long so I just threw it all in the slow cooker and added shredded mozzarella cheese and since the chicken was frozen I put it in on high for 6 1/1 hours and it turned out great,  but it did seem to be missing some sort of flavor...needs some spices mixed in but over all it was great served over pasta  the whole family liked it, which is saying a lot!!!

This was to die for.  I added some spices to the chicken and used a colby/monteray jack combo.  Served over white rice kids ate it all and asked for seconds.  A keeper for sure.

So easy!  My husband loved it!  I added sauteed mushrooms and a little bit of garlic.  I also used a can of cheddar cheese soup.  It was cheesy, but good! I also served it over rice pilaf.  Delish.

I only had shredded cheddar so used it instead. I also didn't feel like standing in front of the stove so I baked it (40 minutes at 425) which turned out suprisingly well! Will make this one again!

Very good recipe!  Simple but good.  I made this on a night that I had chicken to use up and I didn't feel like another boring seasoned chicken breast.  I'll definitely make this again to serve over rice.

Very easy to make. It could’ve used a little spice in my opinion. I’m going to try this again with some red pepper flakes or creole seasoning.

It was just an okay meal. I needed something easy to fix and this definitely fit the bill for that. I substituted milk for the condensed milk and shredded cheddar instead of cheese slices. I also added mushrooms as some other reviewers suggested, plus some frozen peas. I served it over egg noodles. It was decent for a fast dinner, and I'll eat the leftovers for lunch. The dish overall was nothing spectacular though.

This was a great and easy recipe. I picked up a roasted chicken from the store and cut meat off into chunks, added half of a soup can of fat free 1/2 & 1/2 for a little more moisture, thinly sliced up some potatoes & substituted shredded sharp cheddar cheese, a few frozen peas and dumped it into a casserole dish. Baked at 350 til the potatoes were tender. Sprinkled a little more cheese on top and served it up.. Was very tasty and my grandson that's picky ate it up!

I made this with drumsticks instead of breasts, because they were what I had on hand. This was very yummy. I would like to make it on breasts next time so I could scoop up more of the sauce but this was a comfort food quality dish as I made it.

I didn't care for this recipe at all. I made it pretty much like recipe said but added portobellos into the mix. In spite of being very un-asthetically pleasing (looked grayish in color) it was a very odd flavor w/the American cheese. Cheddar may have improved this recipe and definitely follow some users' suggestions of adding garlic and other spices to avoid the bland taste of this one star recipe.
