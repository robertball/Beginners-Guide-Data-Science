Really good chicken and dumplings recipe--and pretty easy to make too! I followed the recipe as written, but changed the method since I used my Dutch oven. I sauteed all the vegetables and chicken in the butter until cooked through. Then added the seasonings and flour. Then poured in the broth and water, and allowed that to cook a few minutes. Added in the milk and peas, and cooked that until thickened on the stovetop. I felt that the mixture was thick enough at this point, so I simply threw the biscuits on top, covered the pot, and put it in the oven for 15 minutes. Removed the lid, sprinkled the biscuits with paprika (just a personal preference), and cooked another 18 minutes until they were lightly browned. Worked perfectly and kept everything in one pot! This is a really great tasting meal, that is quite easy to prepare too! Thank you for the recipe!

I made this pretty much as written - I always at least try to make any recipe as close to as it's written and then  maybe make any changes the next time.  My main changes were that I had a bag of mixed vegetables in the freezer so I used those instead of the individual veggies and since I have to do everything gluten-free, I mixed up a biscuit batch from GF baking mix and used that on top of the casserole.  This did not turn out well as the biscuit mix absorbed too much of the liquid from the bottom of the pot.  Sadly, I have not found anyone who makes GF biscuits in a tube.  Pillsbury used to, before anyone knew what Celiac was and then discontinued them before I knew I had an allergy.  The flavor of the veggie/chicken/sauce mix was very good and I will likely make this again if I can come up with decent GF biscuits that won't turn into giant sponges-LOL!  Also, I used a dutch oven so was able to just pop the whole thing in the oven.
