I tried this recipe and my three grandsons (8, 11 and14) loved it.

The middle grandson loves to stop at a local convenience store for breakfast pizza.  Personally, I found their product not only over priced but repulsive as well.  I wanted to make a breakfast pizza that would satisfy him.  In looking up recipes I settled on this one.  I was skeptical about using the canned pizza dough and the cream cheese.  I did not use salsa or cilantro.

I made it following the recipe closely.  In grating the cheese, I felt 8 oz. was a bit much, so I quit after grating about 6 oz.  I had the same feeling as I cut the cream cheese into chunks and only cut up about 3 oz.  As it turned out I used most, but not all, of the cream cheese I had cut up.   The grandsons felt that the breakfast pizza would have been just as good without the cream cheese.

This was my first time using a canned pizza dough.  When I unwrapped the dough, I was surprised to find that it was rectangular in shape.  I should have taken a moment and formed it into a round disk before pressing it into the pan.  I would have gotten a more uniform crust.  When baked, the crust was tasty and the grandsons really liked it.

Using the canned dough made the prep go quickly.  Pillsbury has produced a winner.
