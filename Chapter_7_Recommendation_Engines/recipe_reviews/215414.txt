These green, meaty boats looked so awesome going into the oven and I had really high hopes for the outcome, but I was a little disappointed. I will definitely make them again, but not without a couple changes. The "1 large zucchini" written for the original recipe, must've been from a mutant garden strain b/c I scaled the meat back to 1 lb. and ended up cramming 3 1/2 medium zucchinis with the meatloaf mixture, as well as making a couple random meatballs on the side. The end result was unfortunately on the bland side, (splash splash of Sriracha to the rescue!) so next time around, the meat and sauteed veggies need to be more heavily seasoned, possibly w/ more garlic, red pepper flakes, thyme, oregano, Italian Seasoning, etc... Also, I think I would rather prepare these like a stuffed bell pepper where I'd brown the meat prior to stuffing, then just pop the boats in the oven to melt the cheese, only b/c I wasn't too thrilled with the accumulation of grease in the zucchinis. Oh yeah, I also dropped it to 1 egg and 1/2 c. Italian bread crumbs, since I had a little less meat, and the bake time was dead-on. Overall a 3.5 star recipe that (CHEER! My 3-year old gobbled up!) might just need some tweaking b4 I'd make again.

I've been making these for years and we love them!  If you use ground round there shouldn't be an accumulation of grease in the zucchini boat.  If all I have is ground chuck (with 15% fat) then you are better off browning the meat first and mixing then mixing it with some of the sauce.  Terrific way to use zucchini when your garden is producing more than you can handle!  Toss a salad & serve with crusty bread or garlic toast.

This was very good, what I do is cut off the ends of the zucchini and boil in water for approx 10 to 15 mins ...take out let it cool then slice inhalf and take out the pulp and I add it to the hamburger mixture, adds alot of flavor....

This was a great recipe and didn't take long at all. Very easy prep work.  I wasn't happy with the spaghetti sauce that I used but the rest was great. Just becareful on the type of sauce. I used one with the cheese in it.  Thank you for the recipe..

The fat and sodium in this recipe are through the roof! Not to mention the cholesterol. While this recipe is very very tasty, I would not recommend eating often. Omit the bottled sauce and use your own or a low sodium brand. Omit the garlic salt completely and try garlic pepper, you might be surprised. The Italian seasoned bread crumbs have a lot of salt and Parmesan plus the recipe calls for extra Parmesan and mozzarella. Make you your own bread crumbs with herbs, no salt and just use the Parmesan as indicated in the recipe. Then try low fat Mozzarella.  You can try ground turkey or chicken if you like but I do not think it will make much difference. I do cheat from low fat and low sodium diets but have found after very little time that a lot of recipes are very salty and although I love the velvety texture of some fat, greasy and oily becomes very cloying.

I tried it with spicy Italian turkey sausage instead of the ground beef and it was wonderful. I used the small zucchini that didn't need to have the seeds removed. Served for company and everyone loved it.

I've been making these for a while and find that you have to play around with this recipe in order to make it to your taste.  For one thing, scoop out as much of the zucchini as you can... ok, it's not wasting if you have a TON of big zucchini's to use up!   Then bake and season the "boats" first for -- ummmm, maybe half hour or more in order to get it cooked and dried out a little, as it tends to be watery if you don't.  
Cook the beef/pork in your frying pan ahead of time and add the things you'd like--green pepper, onion, garlic, seasonings, tomatoes or tomato sauce, etc. and taste it first so it's more to your taste.  When you stuff it, leave the cheese off until the last 10 or 15 minutes so it doesn't burn.

great recipe! i made this with ground turkey. i even had some meat left for a few meatballs that i added to the sauce that is served on the side. depending on the size of the zucchini, you may need to cook it longer. you don't need to be a "professional" to figure out how to adjust the ingredients to your taste.

You really need very large zucchini to make this work right.  It was okay...I might try it again if I can get larger squash.

SO YUMMY!  Instead of making the meatloaf mixture...I used premade meatballs.  and rather than waste the goodies that I scraped out of the zucchini, I added it to the spaghetti sauce.  My husband and two year old loved it!

I thought this was delicious. The whole family ate it without complaining about the "vegetable" under the meatfloaf. I only used one pound of lean ground beef and there was plenty of stuffing. I just heaped it up tall and we were good to go! Yummy and easy and a great way to use your zucchini.

I substituted 1/2 lb of the meat for Italian sausage. I also added baby spinach leaves and and some mozzarella to the mixture. Definitely cook the zucchini for a couple minutes before adding the mixture, especially if they are larger... And at the very end, I flipped the oven over to LO Broil and gave it a final layer of parmesan and basil, crusting the top. It was a HIT! ;)

I used a zucchini about 12 inches long and over 3 inches in diameter and still felt they were overstuffed.  It took way over recommended time to cook the meat through and still the zucchini seemed undercooked.

i wouldhave to agree that the meatloaf needs more flavor. i did not cook the onion and garlic i just added everything to the meat which i used ground turkey another viewer used hot turkey sauage and that is what i would do if i ever make again. my husband said that the meatloaf would make great meatball in sauce. did not like the zucchini at all.

Great idea, but found that the zuchinni didn't get cooked all the way in the 60 minutes I gave it. I used ground turkey to cut down fat content and it was good that way. insead of parmesan,I used shredded "mexi" cheese.  will make it again, but will probably "tent"it with foil for the first 20-30 minutes.(might keep the burned sauce on the bottom of the pan to a minimum. I served a little spaghetti on the side as well.

This recipe was yummy and a great way to use up zucchini! I used 4 medium zucchini and had plenty of filling.  Following other reviewer's advice, I cooked the zucchini for 15 minutes before stuffing then baking as stated in the recipe.  However, I mixed the shredded mozzarella in with the meat mixture BEFORE baking. They came out perfect.  I served these with a side of spaghetti.

I know we are deviating here from original recipe, but I prefer a zucchini boat featuring sauteed ground sausage - regular or hot.  I nuke zucchini halfs to partially cook and make scooping out pulp easier.  I hollow out zucchinis.  Mix chopped zucchini pulp w/ sauteed onions and mushrooms.  Add salt, pepper, parmesan cheese to taste.  Then top the boats with sausage then zucchini mixture.  Add chopped tomatoes and mozzarella.  Bake for about 30-40 minutes.

I made this according to instructions and although edible and enjoyable I will continue to follow my own recipe for stuffed gourds. After preparing the zucchini I rub the inside with a mixture of Kosher salt and olive oil and leave for several hours, then I rinse under cold running water and dry in a low oven for about 10 to 15 minutes. I use half Beef and half Veal in the filling and use oregano to season. I prefer shallots and add caperberries and chopped green olives. I then mash one whole anchovie into the Tomato Sauce. Bake on the Middle shelf of a 375F preheated oven for 30 minuts. Pair with a good Chianti.

I did make just one change.  I used 3 medium zucchini, cut in half, as the meat mixture was quite a large amount.  I piled them pretty high and used plain old Ragu sauce and they came out spectacular.  Served on top of a bed of brown rice.   Very good!!!

This is "ok" as is.  I made it exactly as the recipe says.  The second time making it i added a few things of my own.  Red pepper flakes, extra garlic (a heaping teaspoon), parsley flakes, and oregano.  I only used half of the olive oil to saute the onion and garlic... the original recipe calls for way too much olive oil.  Also, for this amount of meat, i needed two zucchini's, to make four boats. When i seeded and scooped out the zucchinis i chopped up the zucchini innards and added it to the meatloaf mixture... extra helping of veggies for a little bonus of healthy goodness and couldn't even tell it was in there.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe.  Just a little bland for our taste, but with a few minor additions it was fantastic.

This was a really tasty dish.  Super easy to make which is what I like.  I only had 4 small zucchini's and way to much meat.  So I ended up making meatballs with the excess meat for spaghetti and meatballs the following night!  I got 2 meals out of 1!  Not to shabby.  Plus my husband brought some to work for lunch the next day and said they reheat pretty good too!

This recipe was awesome!! To make it a little healthier, I used ground turkey breast, and for the bread crumbs I used a fiber-enriched bread. It was amazing!! I had some meat leftover, so I made meatballs to use at a later time. Incredible! This has become one of my husband's favorite dishes!

I used ths stuffing with bell peppers and it was just as or even more tasty! My wife's only complaint - a bell pepper full of meatloaf was just too much meat! Don't think I'll hear that complaint from most men!...

My family LOVED this thanks to all of the reviewers suggestions. The zucchini I used was about 14" long & 4" diameter at the widest part. I used minced garlic only, not garlic salt. I also substituted 1 lb. ground bison & Bob's Red Mill Oat bran for the sirloin & Italian crumbs. Less sat. fat & more fiber, plus I'm gluten sensitive. I also only added a couple Tb. of Parmesan & left out the mozzarella, just sprinkling a tiny bit on top the last 5 min of cooking. Instead of spaghetti sauce I used diced tomatoes with more minced garlic, oregano, Italian seasoning & a pinch of red pepper flakes. I cooked it at 400 degrees for 60 minutes & left it to rest for 15 minutes before cutting it. This will be a summer staple in our house. Family, friends & neighbors can give me there overgrown zucchini any time!

This was a really good twist on meatloaf. I used ground chicken instead and it worked wonderfully. I also added two dashes of cinnamon. I had to use several smaller Zucchini since there were no large ones at my store. I think in the future I might just make it a normal meatloaf and shred the zucchini in like I did the carrots. Great recipe though. If I can find a large zucchini I will definitely take this approach again.

We didn't have enough onions on hand or Italian breadcrumbs, so we improvised. I believe the original ingredients will make it more flavorful. We also used one pound of ground turkey filled two largish zucchini from our garden. Would like a definition of "large" :)

I had 2 small zucchini rather than one large one, so I sliced each one into 4-5 long slices and covered the bottom of the baking pan with them.  Then I made meatballs out of the meat mixture and put them on top of the zucchini.  The only change I made to the ingredients of the meatballs was to add about 1/4 c. chopped green peppers to the mixture.  It had great flavor and I liked the various textures with the zucchini, meatballs and cheese.

These were a hit!  All 3 of my children liked them!  I used ground turkey and browned that first.  Then mixed with all the other ingredients.  I also baked the zucchini in the oven for awhile before stuffing them.  I will make these again!

Very good recipe, but instead of the ground beef, I used a mild Italian sausage (ground very fine). I always brown my meats somewhat and drain any fat, to help elevate some of the grease. I did have some very huge zucchini (a normal sized zucchini does not work well). Also, I substituted the onion for finely chopped chives and finely chopped basil.  All in all, a good recipe...but need to watch the size zucchini your purchasing.

Delicious! I used 2 medium zucchinis. I cut, scooped & baked the zucchini boats for 20 minutes as one reviewer suggested. I used hot Italian sausage and cooked with the onions & garlic. Combined everything & filled the boats. Baked about 25 minutes (covered with foil). Uncover, add cheese & bake until cheese melts. I will make again!

Turned out great! Used caribou, so very little fat, almost none draining out of Zuc boat. Spiced it up a bit with red pepper flakes and a dash of chili pepper. Didn't have mozzarella, so just used more parm. Used one LARGE zuc I bought locally, can't wait for leftovers!

I had a few zucchini and didn't know what to do with them. I found this recipe,  used ground beef and cheddar cheese   instead.  I browned the beef a little, mixed the other ingredients . My son and granddaughter  loved it.  He asked for the recipe so  he can make it. Can  wait  to make this for my mom and sister.A

Next time I might throw the zucchini in the oven and get it started before I add the meat in. It took much longer for the zucchini to cook through than the meat and so the meatloaf was a little dry. Fresh herbs in the mix gave it a good flavor.

We loved this idea. We freeze homemade roasted tomatoe sauce (tomatoes, onion, garlic, carrot, sweet pepper) so, it becomes very easy.  Bread crumbs a bit too mushy.  A friend recc using quinoa flakes.

Loved this, although I made some changes. Instead of beef I used a mixture of lean ground turkey (1 lb) and Italian sausage (1/2 lb).  I don't use garlic salt, so I sprinkled dehydrated garlic onto the zucchinis along with a dash of salt and pepper. I diced the onions small and threw them and the garlic straight into the mixture raw. I reduced bread crumbs to 1 cup because the consistency was right at that point. I also reduced the mozzerella cheese to about 1/4 cup. You don't need it for taste- just for contrast.  Mine weren't to temp after the specified 45 minutes - it required an additional 20 minutes, so allow for some extra bake time. Also, next time I'll cover baking dish with foil until the cheese is added at the end. Served with salad and spinach tortellini. Delicious!

This could be 5 star and I will make it again. I made it as directed (just added a little more garlic, onion and added a dash of red pepper flakes). It still needed more flavor to the meat! Add more seasoning to the meat and it would be awesome.

Excellent!  The only thing I changed was to chop the zucchini that I scooped out of the boat and add it in with the onions and garlic.  It sretches the recipe a little bit, and since I'm my mother's daughter, I hate to waste anything!  This made enough filling for one large and two small zucchini.  I will definitely make this again!

Yum! I made it with a few changes as suggested, cooking empty boats in oven on low prior to filling and only using 1 Lb of ground round.  Did have to drain the boats prior to topping with cheese, but no big deal. They were awesome!

Made it for the 1st time tonight. I doubled up on the recipe because I had my parents eating over too. I also added a couple of other ingredients to.make it my own. My husband  loved it. My picky kids loved it as well as my parents! Definitely will be making this again.

This was a wonderful recipe. Like the others, I added and subtracted a few things. First, I used three medium zucchini which used up all the meat mixture perfectly. I omitted the garlic salt and used garlic powder instead. I omitted the carrot and added 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning. I also used finely chopped raw onion instead of cooked. Most importantly, I used ground pork instead of ground beef and it worked wonderfully. There was no grease whatsoever. Finally, I cooked the zucchini in two separate pans on racks. The racks helped the hot air circulate under the zucchini and cooked them evenly. I had no trouble having them cook through. It did take about an hour and a half. Finally, I lined the pans with foil and this helped tremendously with cleanup. I'll certainly be making this again.

I thought this was great....made changes though. Was gifted a huge zucchini the other day and cleaned and cut this into 6 pieces hence six boats. I would have also used the pulp in the mixture but it was too seedy. I did use extra lean ground chicken, used only 1 tblspn of evoo to sautee my onion, garlic and I also added sliced mushrooms to that. Along with the carrot, I added half a red pepper and pulsed those through the food processor. This was quite a meatloaf mix and I used whole wheat Italian crumbs, and added some pecorino romano cheese. Now before stuffing these boats, I did pre-cook the boats at 375 for about 45 min to soften. I then stuffed them with the meat/veggie mixture. When these were done, I then added sliced deli mozzarella and topped with a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes. These were delicious and very healthy, moist and flavorful. Thanks!
