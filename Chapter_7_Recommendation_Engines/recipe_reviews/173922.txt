excellent with the kids - I made it a little healthier by not adding the cream and baking my own potatoe wedges sprayed with a light oil and covered in morrocan spice.
excellent recipe gave me a new way with nachos without all the corn chips

This was really good but way to salty.  I didn't even add the salt that was in the recipe.

If there was a 4 1/2 I would give it.  This was a great recipe, but it seemed to be missing a little something.  It needed more texture.  I think adding a few tortilla chips for a little crunch would make all the difference in the world.
