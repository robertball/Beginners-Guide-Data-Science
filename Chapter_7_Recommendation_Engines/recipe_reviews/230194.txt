I typically don't like foods too sweet, but this was just a little too tart for me (that's certainly easy enough to fix)  I liked using 3 different type berries in this sauce, and the change in texture they bring.  Also liked that little bit of the pumpkin spice flavor peeking through.

Love this recipe, as does all I served it to. Great as is but on occasion I have used pineapple juice in place of water for a little extra sweetness. I dress with chopped walnuts

Made with 600g frozen mixed berries (with cranberries) & omitted the extra OJ. Cooked 30-40min on medium heat or until it reduced by about half & thickened. Great!

Loved it. The additional berries sweeten and flavor it.
