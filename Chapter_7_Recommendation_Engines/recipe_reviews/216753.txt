Holiday Waffles' Haiku: "These are 4-star taste. Cute recipe, in concept. Failed to look 'cute' though." I will describe the appearance of my waffles as "Goblin-with-a-Suntan", as the slight amount of the food coloring called for (which incidentally, I doubled) coupled with the natural browning of the waffle batter, turned my breakfast a, well, sickly shade of celadon. (I'll stick w/ a 4-star rating based on it being a tasty waffle.) After a good chuckle, and some syrup, I ate the waffles, but decided that a holiday-themed breakfast might be better suited for something other than the addition of food coloring to batter - maybe green M&M's in regular waffles.

The taste is very good, but you need to add more food color or use food color paste....the paste works great.

These are very tasty and simple enough to put together.  The amount of food coloring is a bit off, though. I made the batter without the coloring, removed a small amount, and added about 5 drops of red coloring. This resulted in pink waffles. If you look at my submitted photo, you'll notice the color is pretty light even with that amount. To actually get red waffles, you would probably need to add several teaspoons of red coloring to the whole batch of batter.

I made two small changes--I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil and I tripled the food coloring. I made these green and passed them off as "Hulk Waffles". Food coloring amount aside, my husband and two boys ate the heck out of these. I served them with warmed maple-vanilla syrup and Night Before Scrambled Eggs. Great waffle recipe.

These were so plain and lacking in flavor it was difficult to get through them. Not the one to use at all.

I halved the recipe and it was enough for two large waffles. I omitted the dye but it was delicious still!

I used melted Butter instead of vegetable oil and added cinnamon and vanilla extra to the wet ingredients.  My Husband and I enjoyed it.

I added 2 cups of mixed berries and 1/4 cup of potato starch and made them as pancakes on the griddle! Delicious! No syrup needed :)
