Great recipe, easy to make with strawberries. If you alter the number of servings, don't add 4 cups of water in the second step. I had to use cornstarch to thicken it.

This is a wonderful recipe to top off Angel Food cake with.

I substituted orange rind for the lemon rind, and apple/white grape juice for the lemon juice.  I did not strain the pulp because I wanted to retain the fiber.

I will save this recipe and use it again, perhaps as written next time.

This was very good, I did add some cornstarch to thicken it a little.

Very nice topping.  Will use this recipe again. Mashed the berries but did not discard anything - goes against the grain to throw good food out and besides, we like a sauce with texture.  Added cornstarch as I don't like  a watery sauce.  I note the recipe's author acknowledges the need for cornstarch to thicken the sauce - is there no way to amend a recipe once its published?

I dunno if I did something wrong but this came out wayyyyy to watery, I used half the water recomended and it was still more like a liquid than a sauce or topping. it did taste VERY good though, I still poured it on my cheescake.

As the person who posted this recipe, I've found, after some reviews, that you do need to add cornstarch to this recipe.  I would say probably 1 tablespoon per cup of water. Thank you for the reviews and improving on this recipe over the years.

Excellent topping.  I used strawberries instead and it turned out fabulous.  I added some constarch, as others had suggested.  We used it over pound cake and vanilla ice cream...YUM!

I didnâ€™t strain the blueberries out and I added cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I also added less water after reading the reviews. I used this for mini cheesecakes and it came out pretty good. Thanks for the recipe :)
