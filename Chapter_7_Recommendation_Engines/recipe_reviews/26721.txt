Great recipe.  I sauteed the apples first in butter, cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar and after about 5-7 mins when they were tender I mixed them in the caramel mixture.  Served them with christmas dinner and they were the best 'baked' apples ever.

These apple bites were really good right after I made them, but I didn't serve them for a couple of hours.  By then, all the juices had combined with the caramel and turned really soupy.  They still tasted good, though.  Just serve them immediately!

I didn't have any luck with this recipe. I made it, as directed, and allowed them to cool. (on the counter - not refrigerated)
When I went back to serve them, the tray I had them in was full of liquid and the apples were mushy like mashed potatos.

I'm not sure why this happened, but just don't leave them cooling for more than an hour like I did (about 1 hour 1/2)

Wow!  Quick, easy, and delicious.  Big hit at my house.  (Because we like thicker, richer sauces, I added a couple more caramel pieces and a smigon of cinnamon to the preparation, but would still be terrific according to this recipe.)

This recipe was certainly easy and the taste was good, but I can't give it more stars because of presentation - the sauce was pretty liquid, so it didn't really coat the apples very well, and it just sat in the bottom of the bowl.  Maybe I did something wrong?  I might try adding more caramels like one reviewer said.  And it doesn't make good leftovers (because of the soupiness) so make sure you eat it all!

This would  probably be a good side dish, but I don't think it should be catagorized under appetisers and snacks, because the end result is a lot looser than I thought it wouls be.  Also, 30 seconds was not enough to melt the caramel, although I doubled the recipe because i has a lot of apples to use up.

My son has been craving caramel apples ever since he got his braces, so I thought this recipe would be a big hit!  Unfortunately, I had problems with it.  I followed the recipe exactly but the sauce was very runny and never firmed up.  Perhaps the type of apples I used (red delicious) were too juicy.  That being said, the taste was still very yummy, and we can't stop eating them.  It's just very messy and not all that pleasant to look at.  Next time I will try a different type of apple and I will cut back on the corn syrup to see if the caramel firms up.
