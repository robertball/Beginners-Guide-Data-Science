This turned out good despite my not having any turnip greens and totally forgetting the coconut.  

The only thing I didn't like so much was a slight bitterness, which I'm guessing was either the mustard seed or asafoetida.  But nobody else seemed to notice it but me.  I will make this again.

Instead of asafoetida powder, I used a clove of garlic.  This has wonderful taste, with great spices to tame down the pungency of turnips!  I will be making this again!

A keeper for us-- always looking for good ways to prepare the CSA bumper crop of turnips.  Made as directed except for: skipped the optional ingredient, added a small amount of garlic, and added some tofu at end to make it into a one dish meal. Hearty and interesting flavor combination. Make sure to use unsweetened coconut-- I almost grabbed the wrong one out of the pantry and I think that would have ruined it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this the first time and made some errors. First oil. I don't like vegetable oil so I used olive.  After it was too late, it occurred to me that I should have used coconut oil!  So I then added some coconut oil. Then I used a little mustard instead of mustard seed.  And finally I didn't steam with a little water but just used the heat from the oils.  It was a little bitter so maybe it was the leaves.   I will try this again with more care.  I think it'll be a good turnip recipe.

I used coconut oil.  Spinach instead of turnip greens. Added 1 chopped garlic clove.  Doubled the mustard seed.  It was really good, and I will fix it again.

My husband thought he was eating scalloped potatoes. He's not adventerous with out of the norm veggies. Turnips were never a menu item for us. Since turnips were recently a part of my weekly CSA, I had to look for new recipe ideas. This was very tasty.  I omitted the
asafoetida powder and substituted cumin for turmeric since I don't have this spice.

This was amazing. We are low carb and this was a super substitute for potatoes. I followed directions except for the powder that I have never heard of that she said was optional. I used garlic instead.

This was SO good! I did not have mustard seed so used celery seed and 1/4 tsp dry mustard instead. Absolutely fabulous way to use turnips and the tops!

I hate tumeric and I hate coconut. But when you put the two together, WOW! I was halfway through cooking, tasted, and thought I was doomed. Added the coconut and fell in love. Actually, the more coconut the better!  Great recipe, thanks rubiabecka.
