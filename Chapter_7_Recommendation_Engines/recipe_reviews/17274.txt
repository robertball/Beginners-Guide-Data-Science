This is really good. The egg yolks make a great creamy sauce. I will omit the rosemary next time however... the texture of it doesnt go with the creamyness of the pasta. Really good!

I liked this. I could get into the yolk sauce (granted I dumped all of the butter onto the spaghetti along with the eggs!) I used an Italian seasoning blend (the kind that is sold in its own grinder) and extra black pepper and garlic powder. Next time I will use real diced onions for more flavor. I also want to try more vegetables such as bell peppers or asparagus. Perhaps some cheese as well or alternatively sprinkling some lemon juice over the top. Tabasco sauce would also be a nice change of pace.... (I could go on and on and on...) --- PS: I forgot to mention how easy this is.

This was great! I added salt and black pepper and poured all the butter in with the eggs and pasta (duh butter pasta = awesome) and it was great. My 2 year old ate as much as I did!

This was awesome. I really didn't expect much and was blown away by this simple dish. I used a bit less than the spices called for as I sprinkled them over the top and didn't measure just eyeballed them. I used onion powder instead of fresh. The rosemary gave this a wonderful italian flavor. So easy so delicious and so easy on the budget too! Thanks for sharing this little gem.

Oh my goodness this was sooooo good!! I used a bit of Spicy Red Pepper Roasted Garlic olive oil to fry my egg and also added a couple teaspoons of the pasta cooking water to the dish to stretch the "sauce". I also added grated parm on top. This is going to be one of my go to lunches or quick dinners I can tell!!

I've had egg with pasta before and have liked it so though this sounded a bit odd I counted on liking it at least fairly well. But it tasted like nothing - I just felt as though I were eating plain pasta with no flavor.

When I read this recipe I immediatley craved what I thought it would taste like. I love egg yolk and I love pasta. Unfortunately this dish didn't do it for me. it wasn't bad but nothing I'd make again.

I've done this a few times (great minds & thin wallets think alike LOL) sometimes with a few slices of cooked bacon finely chopped & fresh Parm grated on it as a "one-man pasta carbonara". To hose who think it sounds unappetizing please try before you judge You wont regret it! Yolk makes such a lovely sauce:)

Genius idea! I did make a few tweaks. I used green onion and increased it to whatever one whole (green and white part) yields. I used white pepper because I think it has more flavor and I added freshly grated Parmesan. I also threw my rosemary in my spice grinder to eliminate those sharp leaves so I'm sure I used more than stated. I had homemade coleslaw as a side. Fast and very tasty. Thank you pkelley.

This dish was great and it happened to have the only ingredients I had left. I did add some red pepper flakes to give it a lil kick. Awesome.

I have been searching for a similiar recipe to this one my mother used to make. I am not sure if it was a german or hungarian or even italian recipe but the egg was almost poached or boiled along with the noodles... i think.. like a scrambled egg poured into the water as the noodles cook. If anyone has heard of this let me know! I am so thankful for the ingrediants to taste.. as i had no idea what was used.

I was excited to try this since I love both eggs and spaghetti. It was not good. I followed the recipe exactly. We laughed at it that's how bad it was. No bueno.

This was pretty good with some modifications: I used half butter half olive oil sauteed a little garlic on low heat before adding eggs (on top) strained spaghetti over a little big of baby spinach added salt/pepper and Italian spice blend. It wasn't awesome but it did the trick on a budget. What it really needed was a little bit of good Italian cheese!

I do like it. However I believe I had too much black pepper for me. It put too much In it. But it was so good.

I liked this recipe but recommend using half the butter and only a few sprinkles of pepper garlic and rosemary. I used green onions instead of regular - because that's what I had - and I don't recommend that change. I also used freshly ground black pepper so you may want more than a sprinkle if you're not grinding it fresh.

Very tasty & so easy. Saved some pasta water to add more volume & thicken like others said. Worked nicely. Think I ll add chopped green onions next time. Maybe some chopped fresh spinach or basil too. Throw it in right at the end & let it just get warm.

This is one of my favorite comfort meals. I make it without the garlic onion and rosemary. Just salt pepper and good quality parmesan. Yum!

It worked, and it's dead easy to cook. I made it with rice noodles and added a bit of soy sauce. I suggest to not use much rosemary because of the texture when you eat it.

Sorry I didn't like this too much. It sounds very European and I was excited to try it! I think it has potential though I'm just not sure if I like the mixture of pasta and eggs. Thanks so much for sharing though!

Very good with a couple of slight changes. I used three cloves of roasted garlic instead of garlic powder. I diced the onions and increased them to a slight one fourth cup and since I only had ground rosemary I reduced it to about half or so. As a quick note I was only going to give this recipe 4 stars but considering the quick prep time and common "on hand" ingredients used I decided it really did rate a qualified 5 stars.

This was surprisingly good! I didn't have cheese or pasta sauce so I was delighted to find this recipe. I added more onion than was called for fresh garlic peppers and chili powder along with Italian seasoning cream and some chicken cube. Thanks for sharing this. Will definitely make again.

It's hearty and tastey. I did alter. I had no onions so I used onion powder. I used garlic salt instead of powder. I used closer to 1 teaspoon of rosemary. Very yummy.
