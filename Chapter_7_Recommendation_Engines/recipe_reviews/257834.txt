Cookies turned out okay but are a little bit dry if the recipe is followed and definitely could have used an actual icing on top. The icing recipe did not work for me at all.

The cookies were flavorless! They needed to be a little sweeter. I was not a fan of the icing because it tasted just like cornstarch!
