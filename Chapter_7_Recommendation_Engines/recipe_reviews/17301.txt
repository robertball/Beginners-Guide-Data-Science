It was ok.  Was disappointed w/ myself that I did not use all fresh ingredients, instead I used canned crabmeat so even though the taste was very good knowing that made me not like it as much.  Of course this is not the fault of the recipe.

The flavor of this recipe was excellent, however, I made more sauce than was called for because it looked dry after I poured the sauce over it. As a result I got a 'soupy' texture to it - i.e. too much sauce. It would have been good over rice or noodles the way that I prepared it. Also I added sauted mushrooms and a bit of onion and a couple of chopped (cooked) bacon slices to it and it really gave a great flavor and more meaty base. Finally I cooked it too long so the shrimp were rubbery. The next time I make it I will add the raw seafood to the sauce to cook briefly and then put it in a cassarole dish and then melt the cheese briefly under the broiler. Whew ! I guess I changed things around quite a bit but the flavor was outstanding and my guests all really enjoyed it. I served it with asparagus and small round roasted parisienne potatoes. Thanks - I will definitely make it again.

This was so delicious we couldn't stop eating! I believe I may serve this at my Mother's day brunch since both our moms are seafood lovers.May substitute chunks of lobster for the scallops. I added a couple tablespoons of white wine and some green onion to the sauce for a bit of a zing!Yummy! Thanks Carol.

This was delicious!  I used imitation crab instead of real and Tilipia Filets in place of Sole as they were not available. Sprinkled all of the fish with Black & Cayenne Pepper, Garlic Powder, Chipolte Pepper and Old Bay Seasoning..Wow, did that make your taste buds sing!  For the sauce, I just sprayed with "I can't believe it's not butter."  It does take longer to bake than the directions because it is so thick...I cooked it for 30 minutes.  My husband just loved it.  Served with Sesame Asparagus from this site.  In fact, we are having it for dinner again tonight.  Thanks for great recipe!

This was terrific!  I fixed this last night, but have to admit to adding a couple of things.  
I sauteed some FRESH SPINACH and SQUEEZED all the liquid out of it.  I topped the seafood with the spinach and cheese.  I made the sauce just as directed, drizzling ALL BUT 2 TBS of it over the top.  I PUT THE REMAINING TWO TBS OF SAUCE INTO A BOWL AND MIXED ABOUT 1 CUP OF PANKO BREAD CRUMBS IN IT AND CRUMBLED IT ON TOP OF THE SEAFOOD, CHEESE AND SPINACH.  
Another word of advice, pan fry the shrimp for just about 2 minutes per side in butter, the scallops about 3 minutes per side and the thin fish fillets about 4 minutes per side.  I also sprinkled "Old Bay Seasoning" on the seafood as it was frying in butter.  Cooking the seafood first  will help keep water from accumulating in the dish (soupy).  I baked it at 450  (convection oven) for about 8 minutes.  The crunchy topping really makes a difference.   IT IS A MUST THAT YOU USE ALL FRESH INGREDIENTS FOR SUCCESS!

I added saltine cracker crumbs with a little melted butter to place on top before entering the oven in 18oz au cratin dishes.  This gives a little extra taste and colorful appearance.  The sauce is perfect and the array of seafood mixes the taste buds up just right so as to offset the richness.  Outstanding recipe! (no Campbells salty soup, all natural from scratch!) 3 guests demanded this recipe and they also took remaining portions home (A+).  Awesome!

This is delicious.  I did cheat though, the sauce recipe looked like hollandaise sauce, so I used a pre-packaged mix and added a couple teaspoons of lemon juice when the sauce was done. I don't know, but the packaged stuff might cut some of the calories/fat.  Baking time was a little longer than stated in the recipe.

I've made this a few times now and I always have success with it.  I do use a packaged Hollandaise sauce, but the recipe goes together so quickly and yet the final product looks like you fussed for hours.  I've gotten lots of compliments on this recipe.

Outstanding!  I made this for Mother's Day dinner and my family loved it.  It was easy to set up ahead of time and just do the sauce at the last minute.
Thanks for such a wonderful dish!

This tasted good but I don't think the 1/2 cup of butter was necessary, it was way too much!  Next time I will try making the egg mixture with 2 tbsp melted butter, 2 tbsp white wine & mixing it with the seafood before putting it into the serving dishes.  Then sprinkle cheese on top.  As it was, the seafood was swimming in melted butter!!

This was really good. I did it exactly as the receipe said. Next time I may try putting in a drop of white wine and green onions, as another reviewer mentioned. The sole is perfect of this dish, not too fishy or overpowering.

I did find the sauce kind of curdled though. Not sure if I did something wrong?? I served it with some garlic bread and zuchinni. You dont need much in the way of sides as this is a meal in-itself.

I just noticed that it is over 1200 calories per serving - ouch!

Now is the time of year I can finally get fresh sole!  More stars that 5!!!  I used fresh crabmeat and followed the recipe exactly (except I topped with the parsley before baking by accident - but it was fine).  Even though this recipe has way too many calories from fat, high carbs, high cholesterol and more salt than you need in one entire day - I'll have to make it again and again. . . I know the seafood loving DH will love it too.  Thank you Carol!

it was perfect. I've found too little the quantity of the sauce, so I've mixed 200 ml lightly beaten cream to it. The end result is some creamy, light, heavenly miracle.

I used packaged hollandaise sauce as well.  I also added asparagus to it before I baked it and I omitted the shrimp as I didn't have any on hand.  It was good, but not my favourite.

Disappointing!  I should have listened to the review about the sauce separating.  After cooking, the butter seperated in the sauce so everything was sitting in oil.  It was way to rich, but not in a good way.

This tasted like nothing more than egg yolks to us. I ended up ordering takeout. I was so disappointed because I was really looking forward to this combination. Maybe the person who used the sauce packet has the right idea.

Another recipe that deserves mention!! This was fantastic! Easy to prepare ahead of time if you're having guests, and then just pop it in the oven when you're ready for dinner! Your guests will love them. You can use imitation crab, but if you can't beat the flavor of real crab..especially if you're cooking for friends.

Loved this recipe, we all did.  I did not have crab meat and instead of sole, I used flounder.  Also, I subsituted  cheddar cheese.  It worked just as well.

Loved it !!  Although, my scallops were not completly thawed, so I did have a little water on the bottom, my fault though.  Maybe a little more sauce next time, and it is THE perfect dish.  My husband thanks you !!

This recipe is wonderful for a dinner party.  My only suggestion is to leave out the sole.  It was a little to overpowering with the sole.  The scallops and shrimp stand out enough in the dish.  Next time I also plan to sautee the scallops.  They seemed a bit cool after baking.
