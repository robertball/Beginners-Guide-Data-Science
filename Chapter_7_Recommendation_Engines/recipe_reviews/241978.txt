Hubby thought the sauce was a bit on the tart side, so I did add a bit more sugar and added some lime zest as well.  The sauce also would be delicious on grilled fish.  Can't say enough about the shrimp boil, we REALLY liked this blend of ingredients!  SAVVYHOSTESS, thumbs up in this house!

Good sauce with just a little more sugar.  I added a little of Nellie & Joe's Key Lime Juice concentrate.  The kind of juice you use when making Key Lime Pie.

The boil is fantastic.  So simple and so good.  I will prepare all of my shrimp with this boil.  The dipping sauce was okay but not nearly as good as the boil.  Didn't even need the sauce though, as the boil gave it great flavor.  I will never buy cooked shrimp again, even for a shrimp cocktail.  Thank you, thank you.
