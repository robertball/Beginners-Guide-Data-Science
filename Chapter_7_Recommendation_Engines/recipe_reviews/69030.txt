This is just the recipe I was looking for!  A mexican restaurant where I live serves a dish called Chicken ala diablo and I wanted to duplicate it at home.  When I made it I did not marinate the chicken in the sauce, I cut the chicken in strips, like for fajitas, and sauteed them in a skillet, then I just added the sauce to the chicken.  You can completely avoid the "buffalo wing" flavor if you use an authentic mexican hot sauce like Cholula.  I then serve it with flour tortillas, rice and beans.  Homemade salsa and chips.  YUMMY!

I am kind of torn as to what rating to give this.  The chicken itself turned out fine.  The taste of the sauce was basically like a watered down traditional buffalo wing sauce.  Since we like our buffalo wing sauce with a fuller flavour, this watered down version was a bit disapointing.  My husband basically said that it would have been better (and easier) if I had just poured regular buffalo wing sauce over the chicken.  I think if you find the regular buffalo sauce to be too spicy, this would be great to coat either chicken breasts or even regular wings.

Very tasty and spicy.  I used the thin sliced chicken cutlets which I marinated in a ziplock for 24 hours.  I then grilled them on my George Foreman.  Served on sub rolls with lettuce & tomato. Very gourmet style sandwiches!

Read the reviews and decided to use Cholula mexican hot sauce, instead of a hot pepper sauce so it would have more spanish/mexican flavors.  Added some diced jalapenos to sauce.  I too chose to strip chicken, seasoned strips with cumin, coriander, and crushed red pepper flakes, cooked in skillet with oil and garlic per recipe until nicely brown then added sauce.   It seemed a little too sweet/tangy when I first mixed up the sauce, so I adjusted for more heat /spice.  Served it with spanish rice and beans.

Wow! this recipe is excellent.  It tastes very much like Peri Peri that I tasted in South Africa, I believe peri peri originates from Mozambique.  I found it very good without putting the sauce over after it was cooked, but my husband who is a spice freak dowsed it with the sauce and loved it.  He then had a cheese sandwich with the left over sauce.  Yum this will be cooked often.  Thank you.

I thought it was pretty good, but something seemed to be missing.  My kids didn't like it.  They thought the sauce was too spicy.  They ate it after I took off some of the excess sauce.

Very Yummy! This recipe was easy to make and both my fiancee and I really enjoyed it. We had it over yellow rice (saffron rice). I also added a little cayenne pepper to the recipe for an extra kick - we like it spicy!

Made as is the first time and enjoyed it. On my second attempt I sauted some sliced shallots along with the garlic. Then added a few dashes of balsamic vinegar to them before adding the chicken.

Overall a good place to start. Second time I made it was much better. We grilled the chicken and cut into bitesize pieces. Did not add the honey, doubled the paprika and cumin. Saute garlic and 1/2 onion in about 1 Tbl butter, add cut chicken and 1/2 cup frozen peas. Only used the sauce cooked and boy was it good!

Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical of this one...seemed like an odd combination of ingredients!  I decided, oh well, go for it!  Does it taste 'authentic', is it reminiscent of buffalo wings...who cares, we LOVED it!  I used mild smoked spanish paprika and served this over organic red quinoa with a green salad!  Great meal with a nice kick and super flavour!

Great spicy dish! My husband loved it but next time I won't fry it,  but either stick it in the oven for 30 minutes or put it in my george foreman grill.

Very good recipe - I love the sauce. I baked mine instead but still reserved the sauce which is a must! I only increased the garlic because I am a garlic fanatic. :)

I made the mistake of using regular hot sauce, buffalo sytle and it was not spicy enough.  It was still delish though!

This was delicous and easy to make. Yes it taste a lot like the revies but like the recipe says that its less calories than buffalo wings. I didn't change a thing. Cooked it just like the recipe said to.

Excellent! Other reviews are correct, this does taste like a healthy version of buffalo wings...But that's what I love about this recipe. I baked the marinated chicken in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes. I made more sauce and poured it over the top and served it with yellow rice. An excellent meal when you're craving buffalo wings but are trying to watch your calories.

LOVED THIS RECIPE! Even my dad, who absolutely hates sour cream, loved this recipe. He raved about it for days afterward and never knew there even was sour cream in it. I used a jalepeno pepper sauce and it was fantastic. The hot pepper sauce, ketchup, and honey go soooo well together! I always love a good recipe that uses cumin (my new favorite spice).

So good. I didn't want to make mine healthier so I baked the chicken breasts for 40 min at 375 degrees and then seared them in a lil olive oil for about 7 minutes.  I served over Basmati rice. There were no left overs.

Love this recipe. There were no leftovers. The chicken was wonderful and moist. When I was making the sauce/marinade, I tasted it and thought it wasn't spicy enough so I added a teaspoon of chili powder. Hours later after cooking, I thought the chicken was the perfect amount of spice, but the sauce heated-up was too spicy for me (my mouth was all tingly). Next time, I will split the portions (of sauce/marinade), then add half a teaspoon of chili powder to just the marinade.

I also marinaded the chicken for about 24 hrs. Upped the amount of hot sauce, and added some garlic powder to the marinade/sauce too. It was too spicy for me, but Husband liked it. Thanks!

I made this dish and it turned out delicious.  My father and I totally enjoyed it.  It was filling and it had wonderful flavors.  We are watching our eating habits thus I used fat free sour cream instead and it was still delicious.  Thank you for this recipe.

VERY EASY and MOIST.  I used part Franks hot sauce and part the original Cholula hot sauce (totally different flavors) then was worried it would be too hot, so I added a smidge more honey.  Not hot at all, but tasty.  I will definitely make this again and adjust the honey and hot sauce to my mood for the day !

So easy and good. To save time, I've skipped the marinating bit and just heated the sauce and tossed with shredded chicken. Tastes great in a green salad topped with avocado, corn, red pepper, tomatoes, green onions, and cilantro.

Really good. I added extra spices to my mix (cayenne pepper and lots of Louisiana hot sauce) to give it extra bite. My husband really liked this as well.

I used half of the suggested amount of hot pepper sauce with tabasco sauce and I found it quite spicy. I used cubed tofu instead of chicken and used enough rice that when mixed together it was a bit like a jambalaya. I poured some Chunky Blue Dressing ontop and it was great. It was like eating a plate of Buffalo Wings.

Boy was this bad. Wish there was a no star.  This dish was NOT a hit between my husband and me.  This is NOT spicy and does NOT taste similary to buffalo wings AT ALL.  I followed the recipe exactly.

This was SO GOOD!  Instead of cooking on the stovetop, we grilled on our GF grill and just served the boiled sauce over top with rice.  This is so easy, I know we'll be having this often!

I agree with DOGLOVER22, it just tasted like watered down buffalo sauce. Chicken turned out good but I was not a fan of the sauce. I was looking for a true Mexican dish and expecting HOT or SPCIY something.

I followed the recipe to a T, but the sauce was horrible.  Luckily I was able to scrape most of it off before cooking and the chicken breasts were salvageable.  I do not recommend this recipe AT ALL!

The sauce in this recipe is just awesome!  I used Texas Pete for the hot sauce so it wasn't too hot for our guests that may not eat as much hot food as our family does.  Served the chicken over rice and made an extra helping of sauce to drizzle over the top.  A keeper recipe for sure!

Like many other reviews mentioned, it was good but just not as spicy as I hoped.  I doubled the hot sauce and added some chili powder and it was still pretty mild. Also, I didn't notice until I had already started on it that it was to marinade for 2 hours, so I just let it simmer in the sauce. I also added some mixed bell peppers.  Maybe next time I'll add some fresh chilies? Overall though, I enjoyed it:)

My husband LOVED this dish. I thought it was ok, next time I'll use less ketchup since I didn't like that flavor. Putting it over rice was a nice touch, I like the texture of it with the sauce.

Whoa!  Spicy!  Good, but I prefer a milder sauce so would halve the pepper sauce in the ingredients.  Does go well with sour cream.  I cooked the entire sauce instead of plating with raw sauce.  It blended the flavors well.

The chicken cooked in the sause tasted good, but putting the extra sauce on top or even with the chicken totally runed it and tasted gross, my husband tryed one bite the way it was supose to be served then threw it away, and got a new plate with just the chicken and rice together. If you make this dish only eat the sauce when its been cooked onto the chicken.

FANTASTIC!  I was honestly expecting just a nice meal but this was much more than expected.  Husband made this while I was at work and WOW!  He substituted salsa for the hot sauce and served it over a bed of white rice.  We will opt for wild rice next time but otherwise no changes!  This one is a definite keeper!  ADDED AFTER EATING AGAIN.....Brown rice works very well also.  This recipe is just fantastic!

Of course I can leave no recipe alone but this was a great base!  The honey made it slightly sweet but not too much and instead of sour cream I used yogurt which gave it an amazingly mild tangy flavor (used in marinade and sauce portion).  Also added a little cream and put onion, roasted garlic and Hungarian peppers in food processor and added them to the sauce!  Delicious and turned out nothing like buffalo wing sauce.

My boyfriend and I invited a friend over for dinner on "Diablo" night.  While I really liked it, the men loved it!  I marinated over night and baked in a casserole dish.  I sliced and trimmed the chicken after cooking and baked in sauce for a bit longer.  I made some homemade Mexican style rice and black beans and served with steamed flour tortillas.  Don't forget the Corona!

This goes great on salad! We used Texas Petes buffalo sauce and surprisingly it was still very hot with a nice sweet kick. I think this would be good for fajitas as well. It made dinner a breeze! I would suggest doing this for a fast week night dinner.

It was just ok. The chicken turned out tender and most of the sauce cooked off in the pan, which turned out to be a good thing. The ketchup ruined the sauce. Much too sweet and just ended up tasting like spicy ketchup. I would reduce or totally leave out the ketchup.

It was really good, swapped plain greek yogurt for the sour cream and it worked perfectly.

It is very misleading to say this is a 15 min prep time when you're supposed to "refrigerate at least 2 hours". Recipe does not say that is optional, though looks like some people have skipped that part.  It's a good recipe - when/if you have the time to prepare hours in advance, or for the next night.

I work with 16-24 year olds. I made a variation of this. I cooked chicken thighs pulled them and mixed them in with the sauce. Then mixed it in with pasta and warmed it through topped it with pepper jack cheese. They loved it. It is a delicious filling inexpensive casserole.

This was an instant hit at our house.  The only change I made was using fat free plain yogurt (because that's what I had) and I skipped cooking it in oil just used a spray, then poured all the extra marinate into the skilled to simmer at the end rather than dirty another dish.

I was looking for something different to do with chicken breast tonight and this was fantastic! Used all the ingredients listed (I don't really measure though) except I used Goya salsita ancho chile hot sauce and regular sour cream. The ancho chile sauce gave it more of a Spanish flavor. Absolutely delicious!

This was fine as is, although I've settled on a modified version which I like better.  Instead of marinating and frying, I cut the raw chicken into thin cutlets, press them into italian breadcrumbs, fold them in half, and stuff with about a tablespoon of blue cheese crumbs and a teaspoon of blue cheese dressing.  Then I bake them at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  Meanwhile I cook the sauce (doubled) on the stove and serve it over the chicken and rice.  Finally, I don't add any honey at all to the sauce.

We love this recipe.  I cut the chicken into strips, brown them, and then toss the sauce in the pan and let it simmer.  I usually throw in some peppers too.  It is imperative that you use a Mexican hot sauce, I use Valentina and it's perfect.  I also double the spices.

My Boyfriend and I loved this recipe! I tweeked it just a bit to give it some extra spice. For those of you that thought it was not spicy enough, try adding 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp of Cayenne pepper, I also sauted some onion along with the garlic. It was awesome! Thanks so much for the recipe
