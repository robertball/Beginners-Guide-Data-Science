very, very good. I sometimes add extra garlic or spices. Also, I use the juices to make a nice sauce by adding a little milk or half and half. I have also add a little fresh chopped baby spinach  to the creamy sauce. Spoon the sauce over the chicken.  This is a nice dish for everyday, or for dinner guest.

I omitted the onion powder since I did not have any but the recipe turned out perfect. I served the chicken over spaghetti squash. A very easy meal.

Delicious! I ended up grating the garlic and used a bit of olive oil along with butter when browning the chicken as I was worried the butter would burn. I seared the chicken for about 7 minutes per side to get some more colour and crispness so 25 minutes in the oven was enough to cook the chicken through.

Quick and easy way to make chicken thighs.  I made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe and it came out delicious.  The second time, after the chicken was browned I removed it, added mushrooms and minced onion to the pan and lightly sauteed them, then deglazed the pan with a bit of white wine.  Put the chicken back in and then baked.  I served the chicken both time with jasmine rice roasted asparagus.  This recipe is a keeper.

I have to be truthful, way too much garlic for a lemony chicken! Yikes!   I didn’t use any. Added capers instead.

I've made this twice now and it's delicious! It's a big hit with my family too! I seasoned the chicken first with my homemade house seasoning, which is just salt, pepper, & garlic powder. Everything else was done as the recipe called for. I served it with rice, great beans and roasted Brussels sprout we. This recipe is so delicious and the chicken is crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. It's now a family favorite!

My entire family loved the recipe. It tastes better the second day after the meat soaks up more of the flavor. Next time I make it, I will add some lemon zest to make the flavor  a bit more robust on the first day.

Delicious. I made this exactly as written, well except that after browning the chicken I transferred it and the sauce to a different dish to finish cooking in the oven. I served it with wild rice and steamed broccoli. Next time, because I WILL make this again, I’ll serve it with pasta. There was so much sauce in the pan it would have been great over some pasta. Thanks!

I was able to use the adjust feature and it was a real help! I also used my Ninja pressure cooker feature to cook the thighs in half the time, then the crisper lid to crisp up the skin. They turned out juicy, tender and yummy!

My husband and I loved this simple recipe.  We think next time we'll try a little more fresh lemon juice to give it a bit more zing, and try dicing the garlic for more of that bite.  I know you'll like this!  We served this over rice with some of the great sauce.  Yum!

It came out great!! Instead of doing layers I made the bottom half the peppermint part. Instead of putting candy canes on top, I crushed them and baked them right in the bottom layer! I did a fudge swirl topping, but it didn't come out like it did in my head!

This was easy to make but I added lemon slices and zest because I really like lemon!  Plus, I also added more garlic.
After baking, I deboned the thighs and served it over brown rice.

Easy and fast, tastes great, the pan dripping are perfect for a gravy, over pasta with capers and Parmesan, or with rice.  I made my kids do this recipe, great for college student dinner.

Used fresh onions instead of onion powder, added lemon zest to the butter sauce with the lemon juice to punch up the lemon flavor some. Baked the chicken for about 1 hr 15 min and it was fall off the bones tender.

My husband and I really liked this chicken. It turned out very flavorful. I followed the recipe but the only thing is, it did not come out crispy. It was crispy after browning it in the fry pan first, but after basting it once it was in the oven, the skin got almost like rubber. I think I will try it again and do everything the same except I won't baste, and see what happens. I was even thinking about marinating it first in the same ingredients and just frying it and cooking it in the pan and not the oven. But if you don't mind non crispy skin, which I don't eat the skin anyway...very good flavored chicken!

This dish goes together quick and easy. It was delicious with just the right lemon and garlic flavor and a crisp skin. I did not change a thing. A keeper for sure.

Super simple and very delicious! I used skinless and boneless chicken thighs since that was what I had on hand and it still came out great. I ended up cooking it in the oven for only 15 minutes and used a thermometer to make sure it was up to temperature. A winner!

This recipe is quick, easy and wonderful.  I served over wild rice with steamed kale and a trio of roasted peppers.

I did as Kate (a reviewer) suggested and added some cream and spinach at the end.  I also baked brussel sprouts and fresh carrots with it. It smells wonderful...all that garlic!!
The taste is wonderful. Just enough lemon zest to flavor the veggies, which turned out perfectly.  I might try this vegetarian style next time with mushrooms, carrots, brussel sprouts and spinach.

II absolutely loved this dish. However, my very picky significant other did not. I definitely will be making this again for all the more for myself!
