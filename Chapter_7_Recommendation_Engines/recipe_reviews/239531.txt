These delightful little bites are perfect for a gathering or just by yourself - yes they are that good. The avocado mixture does need some garlic salt to taste otherwise a stellar recipe.

I made it with chopped regular tomatoes and sour dough bread, left onions out.  Needed plenty of salt.   Delicious!  Will make again.

These were quite good. I left out the butter and used olive oil for personal preference but otherwise followed the recipe using red onion. They were fresh and delicious. Will definitely make these again. Thank you Wendy for this delicious treat!

KEEPER ALERT!!!  These are absolutely fantastic!  The baguette I used had garlic in it, which was a great addition.  I used the optional onion, in small very thin slices, which was wonderful in these!  Thanks for the great recipe, Wendy!

Might want to use a sharper cheese with more of a ‘bite’.

I made this for a lady’s appetizer party and was embarrassed to see people throwing it out after taking a bite. The onion is too much but yet it needs more flavor, but adding garlic just made it worse. I don’t recommend.

Really good. Hubby asked if we needed to rate this & said he thought it was a 5 star which I agreed. Very easy to make, did add a little garlic powder as other suggested. You could make a quick lunch just out of this. I didn't have any cherry tomatoes so used a small regular one that didn't freeze out from the weather.  I diced it up & worked fine.

These are so good!  I made them as a snack but ended up eating so many they became dinner.  I made as written and think next time I will add a little salt and some garlic.  I will also try to slice the bread a little thinner.
