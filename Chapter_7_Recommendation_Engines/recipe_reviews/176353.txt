Don't know how these could possibly be any better. Murderously silken in texture and decadently smooth in peanutty flavor. Had no trouble dipping them in the chocolate after about an hour in the fridge. Messy work, but well worth the clean-up. I shaped them into eggs for Easter, dipped in bittersweet chocolate and then drizzled with white chocolate. Easiest way to dip: wear latex gloves. Put a Tb or so of melted chocolate in the palm of your non-dominant hand. Roll the refrigerated center around in it and place on waxed paper. Keeps the mess very minimal. This will give you a nice, light coating. If you want a thicker coat, wait until the first coat solidifies, and repeat. Double dipping gives a luxuriously thick layer of chocolate. Fast, fast, fast this way, and as painless as possible. For highest sheen, melt chocolate in a double boiler off heat. First boil the water in the bottom, remove from heat and place the top over the water. Reboil water as necessary (removing the top part) and put the chocolate back over after you removed it from the heat. Do this whenever the chocolate gets too thick, as well.  BTW, don't omit the salt in the filling as it provides necessary counterpoint to the otherwise relentless sweetness. Tastes reminiscent of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, but worlds better, like they came from an old-world confectionary! BTW, if shaping them as buckeyes, recipe only makes about 48 - 1" diameter balls. If you want 60, then roll to about 3/4".

These came out creamy and just the right balance of sweetness and saltiness.  One thing I did that isn't in the recipe is to put the peanut butter mixture in the freezer for about 30 minutes before forming them into balls.  It made it much easier to form.  I then put the balls in the freezer for another 30 minutes before dipping it in the chocolate.   This made them nice and firm. Awesome recipe!

The best peanut butter ball I've ever tried. Very smooth. My husband even likes them without the chocolate on them!

This was a great recipe! It worked out for me well. When I made it I only came up with 45 buckeyes, but that was a perfect number for me! Buckeyes are a great treat in the fall. This recipe has less calories than I found on other ones on allrecipes, so this is great!

Been making these for a long time - my family can not wait for these every year!  I make as eggs for Easter, hearts for Valentines day and I use a shamrock cookie cutter for the St. Pat's day.  Instead of rolling in balls for the other holiday shapes,  I roll out between 2 sheets of parchment until I get the thickness I want.  I freeze the dough right on the cookie sheet.  Once cold I cut out the shapes, re-roll scraps and continue until all dough is used.  Keep everything well chilled or frozen so they hold their shape for dipping.  I use forks, not toothpicks, to dip.  Shamrocks get green chocolate and hearts get red -  you can find colored chocolate at craft stores.  lots of fun to make! NOTE:  Giant Reese cup pan-  use recipe as is.  a 1 pound dark chocolate wafers from Nuts(dot)com is plenty for the outer shell.  Freeze pan - brush up sides - repeat until sides are thick.  Fill and top with remaining chocolate.

I just made these this past weekend as I was having a craving for them. My mother used to make these for the holidays and since she is no longer here I wanted to not only satisfy my craving for the taste, but to also have something to take me back to the days of her making them and BOY! did these do the job! They are soo good! It took about 2 1/2 cups of the sugar for me to get them to roll up into the perfect ball shape, I popped them into the freezer for about 10 minutes and got my chocolate and shortening melted and here's a tip for dipping them. I put 4 or 5 balls into the bowl where the chocolate has been melted, roll that around with a spoon and then lift them up with a fork to release all the extra chocolate! These are a definite keeper! Thank you for taking me back to years long since past! This is staying in my recipe box for sure!

Great tasty little treat! It made 47 buckeyes and I had chocolate left over. I had some trouble with the dough, however. It was VERY crumbly and hard to form into balls. Not sure what the problem was, as I followed the recipe exactly. Maybe I needed more powdered sugar.

These turned out fantastic! Very creamy and full of flavor. I only added a little over 2 cups of sugar and did not use all of the chocolate for dipping so next time I may make a little less chocolate but I will definitely make these again!

Excellent recipe! I put the peanut butter mixture into the freezer for about 5 mins. prior to forming them into balls. This helped reduce the stickiness and I also lightly floured my hands regularly which allowed the mixture to form into smooth balls. Reduced the stickiness and messiness tremendously.

these are super tasty.  i made mine too big as i usually do.  they're still good but i prefer them to be one-bites instead of 2-bites.  just a tip - keep these in the fridge or they'll just taste like a spoon-full of peanut butter.

These are really good, but they are very messy to make. The peanut butter was sticking to my hands so bad I had to pop the PB back in the fridge for a couple mins before I could continue. I let my PB chill for about 3 hrs after forming them into balls, but they were still too soft. Next time I will put them in the freezer before dipping them. Since my PB balls were so soft, I had a heck of a time dipping them in chocolate since they wouldn't stay on the toothpick. I ended up just throwing them into the chocolate and coating them completely. They still tasted delicious :)

I thought these were great, they were gone same day they were made! I agree that they should be bite size, VERY rich. Did these with my friend, we re-microwaved the chocolate every minute or so and kept the peanut butter balls in the freezer; pulling a few out at a time so that the chocolate would stick. Super easy and a must do! Both our familys loved them!

Sorry to disappoint all the Jiff Buckeyes fans, but this recipe was turning out to be too sugary.
I stopped adding the powder sugar at 2 cups and then added 1 cup of Rice Krispies to replace the missing 1 cup powder sugar.
Turned out great!  Still very sweet, but I'm guessing my substitution gave it a more peanut buttery taste.  The Krispies added a nice crunchy surprise!
I'll bump my rating to 5/5 with the change.

I made these for a judged bake sale at work and won 1st place! Everyone loved them. The only thing you need to be sure of is to have the peanut butter balls very firm when you dip into the melted chocolate. They will fall off the toothpick. Refrigerate for about 2 hours or more before dipping.

I made these for Christmas Eve with the family and they were fighting over them! The recipe definitely did not make 60- maybe 30-40. Also, I did not know how long to refrigerate them before dipping them in chocolate, so I refrigerated them for an hour, and some fell apart. I would recommend refrigerating them for at least two hours before dipping them in chocolate. Great recipe, though!

These were pretty much the greatest desserts I've ever made.  I only used 2 cups of powdered sugar because I didn't want them to be too sweet, and I wanted to taste the peanut butter.  They were soft, but I was able to roll them into balls.  I froze them first, and then I dipped them in melted chocolate.  I used a corn cob holder (the kind with three prongs) to hold onto the balls for dipping.  It worked great!  Also, I ended up using 1 package of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 a package of dark chocolate chips instead of just 1 package of semi-sweet.  They came out so, so good.

I thought these were a bit too sweet, but I brought them to my work "Bake Off" and I won! Everyone raved about how amazing they were. I guess I'll have to add this to my holiday recipes.

Perfect!  I found that halfway thru the dipping process I had to stick my peanut-butter balls back in the fridge to firm up as my toothpick was sliding out of it when I dipped in the chocolate.  Made a great addition to my holiday cookie tray!

These are yummy!  I felt like I was eating something professional from a chocolate shop, but these are all home-made goodness!!  The recipe does make 2.25 trays of candy goodies, so you may want to half the recipe if you have a small family (of 2) like I do.  I didn't bother adding enough powdered sugar to get the balls more set, so it was more of an adventure dipping them, but they still turned out great!  2nd review - many many years later - I compared these to a cook's country recipe, and these are still perfect.  I highly recommend them!  You can easily divide the recipe by 2 or 4 for a small family or household of 1!

These are great!  We all loved them.  Tastes like  a homemade peanut butter cup.  I only had to use about 2 1/2 cups of the powdered sugar and not the full 3 cups and they were plenty sweet.

I just made these tonight with my grandson and I have to say this is by far the best recipe I have used! I did, however, omit the crisco and replaced it with a little over 1/2 block paraffin wax and the finished product looked and tasted like they were from a gourmet sweets shop. I also put the dough in the freezer for approx 30 min prior to rolling it into balls to help keep the shape.  While rolling the dough, it helps to keep sprinkling your hands with a little flour to keep it from sticking. I will definitely use this recipe from now on!

Mixture was too crumbly and dry to form balls.  Added more PB but they still tasted like a ball of sugar.  Sad, but I really wanted to like these.  I didn't.

One note to mention is if they are super soft they leave a large hole in the top that you will need to pinch back together so I take a little bit out of the fridge at a time to keep them as firm as possible and I store them in the fridge.

These are pretty rich, and delicious.  I always hate anything that requires me to dip, but these weren't too bad, I only lost one in the chocolate.  Oh, and I didn't have any toothpicks, so I used skewers (probably the cause of the one that got away).  Skewers worked, but it was almost impossible to cover up the holes.  I will definitely make these again!

I made these with milk chocolate and everyone seemed to like them. I think I will try tempering the chocolate properly next time because it melts in your fingers too easily otherwise.

Excellent recipe. These are very smooth and creamy in the middle not grainy at all. Very easy to make too. I used milk chocolate and unsalted butter. Much much better than a store bought candy.

As my mom always did, I dipped my pb balls to completely cover them using two toothpicks held just slightly apart so the balls wouldn't just "spin" while I dipped them. Placed on waxed paper lined cookie sheets and immediately sprinkled either sweetened coconut(my boyfriend's favorite), colored sprinkles, or chopped walnuts on them. The chocolate starts to set up quickly so sprinkle as soon as each is dipped.

I lost my mother's recipe for Buckeyes but finally found it.  This is an amazingly easy and VERY good recipe. Just enough chocolate. My husband--a 'only chocolate' cookie--LOVES these. If I want any, this must be hid until all set!! I give this recipe 5+

The flavor was delicious but the Crisco needs to be reduced to 1 tablespoon so the chocolate doesn't melt on your fingers when you pick them up.

These were good. However, I am rating them only four stars because the chocolate took longer to melt than recipe stated. Also, I've found usind a double boiler and using a bit of grated wax, rather than shortening works better. The chocolate will be thinner and set more quickly. If you roll the balls then put in the freezer rather than the fridge, it will also make them set up for easier dipping.

These were incredibly easy to make and they turned out exactly as expected.  I used Jif brand peanut butter and the consistency was spot on.  Chocolate melted easily in the microwave according to the directions.  I made 1/2 of the listed recipe and got 35 1-inch Buckeye balls.  I had no problems with stickiness.  They rolled into balls easily and then I placed them into the freezer for 5-10 min. to harden up before dipping into the chocolate.  Didn't bother to smooth out the hole the toothpick created because I didn't feel it was necessary.  Then back to the freezer for a few minutes for a quick harden before packaging.  I will make these again and again.

These tasted great!  To make it easier to roll into balls, freeze the dough for 30 minutes before you roll.  Then freeze for another 30 minutes before dipping into the chocolate!

This is a really good recipe! The buckeyes are so smoothe & yummy! The crisco makes the chocolate the perfect consistency. The only suggestion I have is to maybe cut down the vanilla just a little. It can leave an overpowering taste in your mouth. I didn't use 3 cups of powdered sugar. I used around 2 1/2. The peabut butter didn't stick to my hands at all when shaping them into balls. I read other reviews that said the peanut butter was too sticky.?! I melted the butter completely also. Awesome recipe!!

I make these every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas and they are always a hit with all of my guests and family. I LOVE them, they taste amazing!! The only thing I did differently is I didn't add the whole 3 cups of powdered sugar, I added it until it was firm enough to form into the balls. I also refrigerated the balls (with tooth picks in them) before I coated them with chocolate for about a half hour to make them stay on the tooth pick better.

These are really good. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect! Next time I will make them a little smaller though. 1 inch balls made about 35, definitely not 5 dozen like the recipe says. Maybe my inch is a little big!

So good, they are in the fridge setting up for their Chocolate Coating... Can't wait, I'll be sending some to my mother, grandmother and girlfriend, I had so many, and I halfed the recipe!!! Thanks so much for the recipe, and glad I had the (run out) accident!!! Great recipe!!!

The peanut butter filling has a great consistency and is not too overpowering. The only thing that I recommend is to add a little paraffin wax to your chocolate as you melt it. Adding under half a block gives the chocolate a nice, even professional finish.

Great recipe for buckeyes!  I did have extra chocolate leftover, probably b/c I made my buckeyes larger than I should have.  This recipe only made about 30 buckeyes for me.  Next time, I'll have to double it.

I had no chocolate chips in the fridge or pantry, I did however have a big bag of ghirardelli chocolate 'pads' of 3.75 oz in weight.  They had a 86% proof of chocolate, so I had to sweeten it up with some confectioners sugar.  But it all blended beautifully.  I close my eyes and I think I am eating a Reese's peanut butter cup!!!!  They did, however prove to too heavy for the toothpick so I just poured that chocolate all over them and now just have a chocolate coated peanut butter ball!!!

I used this recipe for chocolate covered hearts for Valentine's Day. Allowed cut outs to sit in refrigerator overnight. Very stiff but seemed to hold form better for full dipping.  Also used Baker's chocolate, melted in microwave with no Crisco and had no issues. Otherwise followed the directions as outlined.  Found other recipes that asked for more powdered sugar but this seemed like the perfect mix!  These melt in your mouth and the mini hearts were perfect bit size!  Yum!

half the sugar and butter as other recipes -- thus is much more on the peanut butter and taste is sooooo much better!! Excellent! Just follow recipe, adding in GRADUALLY the powdered sugar at the end so it is not too hard to mix in as it is in one glump.

Fantastic and very easy. I did, however, make the balls and before dipping them in the chocolate I put them in the fridge for a bit. They hardened the chocolate for me quicker and I didn't have any drop off my toothpicks. A great success!

I have made these many times over the last 3 years. Even mailed them to Afghanistan for the hubby in a care package. It can be sweet, but if you slowly add the sugar after 2 cups and taste it while testing the consistency it comes out perfect. My family and friends always ask for these during the holidays.

YUM! These are a Christmas tradition for us. And if you don't want to bother with smoothing over the toothpick holes, see our "Buckeye Ninjas" photo for inspiration. It's fun and easy to give them some personality with a toothpick and extra chocolate!

Fantastic; followed recipe exactly. For the coating process, I finally found a way that works for me: I fill a 1/3 cup measure with the melted chocolate and dip the toothpicked peanut butter ball into that. It gave me more control without burning my hand (like what happened when I used the plastic glove method).

I’m not sure if I did something wrong but I had a hard time getting my peanut butter mixture to stick together so I could form the balls. They still turned out pretty good

I made this and I can rate the taste  five stars. My only complaint is that the buckeye balls never firmed up in the fridge, and made it hard to dip.

These were good but difficult to assemble - the chocolate didn't melt well in the microwave.  We also tried a double boiler but it was still chunky.  Our buckeyes turned out okay but I'd still like to find a better method for dipping them.

Excellent.  Even I can make these. Added 2/3 peanut butter, and 1/3 cookie butter.  Made a double batch and couldn’t keep them around longer than a couple of days.

Everyone loved these over the holidays. A few people wanted the recipe. It’s definitely one to make. Wasn’t hard and I froze my balls after I made the dough mix for 30 minutes which made it easier to dip. Will definitely make this again.

So I need to try this recipe again. My peanut butter balls turned out to be a 1 Star but I’m giving the recipe 4 stars because I’m certain it was user error. I can taste the potential and I thought I’d share my mistakes to hopefully save someone else from making the same. First mistake was that I used generic peanut butter because that’s all I had on hand. They turned out gummy but edible.  They taste okay but I feel like Jif would have a better consistency. Then my second mistake is not watching the melting of the chocolate closely enough. It started smoking a little in the microwave. I mixed it up and thought it was fine so I coated some balls. Turns out they taste like a fire. Ugh. So pretty much a fail for me.

First time I've ever made Buckeyes so I did a double batch. I fridge the peanut butter mix for about 15 minutes before dipping.  also set up a double boiler so I could control the chocolate temp better.  Family loved them.

The finished product was delicious but not so easy to make.  The chocolate was too thick and it was extremely difficult to only dip 3/4 of the peanut butter ball.  I ended up dipping the entire ball in the chocolate because it was so hard to work with.  The chocolate was entirely too thick, no matter how much I heated it.  I might try this recipe again, but only if I can find a better method for the chocolate. It was TOOOO frustrating!!!

I make these every year, the easiest way to dip them is to make the chocolate and the shortening in a crock pot set on low. Then let them dry on parchment or wax paper and put in the refrigerator. Mine don't usually last but 2 or 3 days as my oldest son comes over and steals them by the tray. My youngest son has now started to ask me to make them for him...... he is sixteen so really not that young I guess.....

Very tasty but found it quite soft to work with. I made it exactly as listed here, refrigerated it for at least 30 minutes before trying to roll out but it was still melting in my hands as I rolled. Then, I chilled the balls again before dipping them but after the first few were dipped, the rest became soft again making it difficult to dip. Next time I plan to take only a few out of the fridge to dip at a time. I persevered though  and was able to dip them in chocolate once. I probably made the balls too big (about 1 1/2 Tbsp.) and next time I'll reduce the size cause when you dip them, the size increases significantly.  I'll also have to store them in the fridge as they soften too much at room temperature and I'd like them a bit firmer for serving. Even still, I would make them again and maybe try to chill them longer before rolling in smaller balls. Delish!!

Thank you to the reviewer who suggested wearing gloves and rolling these in the palm.  Easiest and fastest buckeyes I've ever made!  I don't worry about leaving a hole on the top (too lazy, plus I like more chocolate).   Yum!

Tasted great! Very rich though. I only used 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar and they turned out perfectly. They freeze well. Perfect for when you just want a small treat to pop into your mouth.

I love the pb flavor but I added 3/4 cup of potato chips. It was crunchy, salty, nutty, and soo satisfying.

Very yum!!! I tried the recipe with semi- sweet chocolate chips and milk chocolate chips.  The buckeyes made from the milk chocolate chips were much better!!!

Another family favorite.  I don't use the toothpicks.  I make a big mess on the stove and cover the balls entirely with semi-sweet chocolate (to balance the sweet of the peanut butter) put them on a foil lined baking sheet and put them in the freezer.  Once they're firm I package and refrigerate until I need them.  Perfect for gluten-free cookie exchanges.  Easy to make and delicious.  They last awhile in the fridge too.  Delish!  Way better than Reese's.  :-)

This was my first time making any type of peanut butter balls and this recipe is a keeper.  The one thing I did do was used sea salt instead of regular salt.  The recipe is very easy to follow and they turned out very creamy!

I make these every year at Christmas, and no matter how many I make, there never seem to be enough. Sometimes I pinch the side of some of them to form a snout, dip them in chocolate and then roll in chocolate jimmies. I add two jimmies for eyes, and suddenly they're hedgehogs.

This recipe is absolutely delicious, peanut butter and chocolate, what could be better? The only amendment I made was using vegetable oil instead of  shortening simply because I didn't have any and didn't want to make a trip of it. The chocolate still turned out great! I will certainly be making these again.

the mix seemed a bit gooey which made it difficult to dip correctly.they came out looking like Willy Wonka rejects. But they did taste delicious.

Just made this. Tasty, but took a while. The dough was too soft for chocolate so we had to freeze them. The recipe I am used to used cream cheese which made it more creamy. Merry Christmas!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, just used a little less powdered sugar because it was getting pretty thick. They turned out great! They look really nice and taste very good. The remind me of a reese's cup but taste a little more homemade. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they are very very sweet! I probably could not eat more than one.

Great but near impossible to get the buckeyes to look nice. I cannot figure out how to dip peanut butter balls in chocolate right. Once the cold peanut butter hits the warm chocolate it starts to melt and makes a mess.

Really good! I think it was too sweet, but I used white chocolate, so that might account for some of it. My peanut butter was the perfect texture for rolling! Didn't get all over my hands, or crumble. I'll make them again, but even if I use milk chocolate next time, I think I'll either use unsweetened peanut butter, or I'll cut back on the powdered sugar and make up the difference with cornstarch to save the texture.

Just made these today.  They were extremely easy to make.  I didn't use the shortening with the chocolate.  I find the chocolate coating is thicker without it.  If I had anything negative to say it would be that the peanut butter filling was a little on the soft side but, then again, maybe that's the way it should be.  I also made them a little smaller than the recipe calls for. Hence, I got a gazillion of them.  They were wo-o-onderfully delicious.

I couldn't make them fast enough!  I took some to work and everybody wanted more, they kept saying they were the best buckeyes they ever ate.  My grown daughter requested a whole batch of them for her christmas stocking (and she got them). I didn't change the recipe a bit.

They turned out really well, I only needed the 3 cups of powdered sugar for my peanut butter and I omitted the shortening for the chocolate, as I did not have any, and they still turned out great. Definitely will be saving this candy recipe for years to come. Thanks for sharing x
