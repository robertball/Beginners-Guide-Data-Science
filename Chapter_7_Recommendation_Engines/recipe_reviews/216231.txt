This was very tasty, I for kicks, threw in some black food coloring to the boiling water to dye the pasta black, worked like a charm, as the mom of 3 boys this has been requested all year long!!!

This was a big hit with the kids and the Husband. I used Ragu Original and think a nicetouch to it would be to add some olives and mushrooms.

I didn't actually make this but I've made recipies like this with penne so I know it's great, and just the idea of using bowties and calling it bats and cobwebs makes it a 5 star! What a cute idea!!

This was really great! Reminded me of Lasagna only better! I used Classico Tomato & Basil for the sauce as I always do and this was perfectly spiced

Thisd gets 4 stars just for being such a great idea. My kids loved it and it is now a Halloween favourite. It is tasty, but the flavour depends wholelyn the bottled sauce that you buy. Thanks for sharing such a cute idea.

I am an avid Trader Joe's shopper and following the recipe with the following tweaks turns out fabulous!
1.  Use a whole log of "magically sliced" fresh mozzarella.  As my brother puts it -- the extra cheese and use of fresh mozzarella "puts it over the top".
2.  Use a jar of the Rustica Pomodoro pasta sauce.
Enjoy!!

Simple and SO tasty. My 5 yr old loves the idea of calling the bowtie bats, but she calls the cheese bat poo. LOL Not appetizing, but cute. :-) Happy Halloween!

Ok, for kids (including the Hubby) who are cold and ready to eat after trick or treating, this was "AWESOME".  I made noodles (very al dente) and meat sauce (ground chicken brst with spices for breakfast sausage from AR site) the night before and refrigerated in separate gallon ziplocs. Next afternoon, I threw 2 layers of noodles/sauce/cheese chunks in the crockpot on high (I ran hot water over the noodles and re heated the sauce before layering). Ended up cooking for about 2 hours. Noodles were still in great shape, cheese was hot enough to string but more importantly, dinner was cooking while we were out and ready when we got home.  (FYI--That sounds like I really complicated up a simple idea. I'm just saying prepping in advance and doing via crockpot works well.)

This is really fun and clever. My kids thought I was pretty cool for making it. :) Good mom moment.

Very simple and kid-friendly meal. Easy to prepare. The meat does not have a lot of flavor if you follow the recipe exactly but we added onion powder, adobo and red pepper flakes and it was delicious.

What a fun recipe!  The kids ate so well, tying to see how many cobwebs appeared as they brought the fork to their mouth.  It kept them eating to the last bite!!  Might try with ground sausage next time.

This is a great idea.  I made this with Prego Traditional sauce, and used Italian Sausage instead of ground beef.  Kids loved it!!!!

This is one of my daughters favorite dishes (she is a very picky eater) Thanks Kristin! After some time we did start using Italian Sausage and Emeril's Roasted Gaaahlic sauce. This has been a huge hit over the years.

This was a wonderful, quick and easy meal! Thank you so much for posting this. I wound up using a lot more cheese than the recipe called for because that was the size package that I had to use up. My pasta bow was also more, but the sauce jar was less. In other words, this recipe is quite versatile and not dependent upon precise measurements. I kept mone in the oven for the full 20 minutes. It was enjoyed by all of us and was a warm welcome for a midweek meal. So easy, yet tasty!

I use my own spagetti sauce (we call it gravy) recipe.  Parsley, garlic, locatela cheese, salt, pepper, Italian bread crumbs, milk, eggs.  I don't measure.  Salt, pepper, grated cheese in good Italian crushed plain tomatoes.  I make enough for 3 meals and freeze.  All the flavor in my gravy comes from cooking the hamburger in the tomatoes.  Sometimes I through in a raw potato, left over chicken or pork, umm so good.  Play around with this gravy and don't be shy with the spices.

I followed the recipe exactly.  We all loved it, especially hubby who said "don't lose this recipe, it's a keeper."  Next time I will add a little more mozzarella and maybe some mushrooms because we love them.  Will definitely make this again soon.

Going to make this tonight. Going to add some sliced pepperoni, cut in half (we decided they could be little tombstones). One reviwer suggested olives. Why noy? They could be eyeballs. Going to give it 5 starts because I know they will all like it and it's such a cool idea.

Just made this tonight per the instructions. Used Ragu Onion and Garlic Robusto sauce. Accidentally forgot to put the parmasean in, but sprinkled it over top at the end while it cooled. Delicious. Use a good flavorful sauce and you won't regret making this dish.

I used spaghetti noodles because that's what I've got on hand and this is so much better than boring old spaghetti. Also loved the leftovers so this will be a regular in my house.

Very flavorful,  I was did make a couple of changes.  I used only 1/2 lb of ground beef and added 1/2 lb of Italian sausage.  I cooked those together along with a little chopped onion.  I also substituted the cubed mozzarella cheese for finely shredded  Italian cheese blend.  It's easy and very tasty.

I made this using sweet Italian sausage and my family loved it.  Used  a jar of store bought sauce (only had one) and added a can of tomato sauce and some basil and oregano to give it a nice flavor.  Warmed sauce on the stove to blend the flavors.  Didn't have parmesan so I used mozzarella cheese only and put extra sauce on top and around the edges of the casserole dish before  covering with foil, which I removed 5 min before taking out of oven.  My family likes their bats and cobwebs cheesy but not dry, and so the extra sauce prevent the pasta along the edges from overcooking.  Perfect!  They loved, loved, loved it!  Will make again soon!

I didn't have the cooking creme so I used 4 oz of cream cheese instead, 1/2 cup of shredded cheese and fajita seasoning. It tasted good, but next time I think I'll try using less cream cheese as I wanted to taste more of the spaghetti sauce.  Definitely going to make this again.

Love it! Fast, easy, delicious. The kids claw their eyes out for more! The adults can't wait to make it for their boys and ghouls. It’s perfect for a fun children’s party. At night clubs, it appears terrifyingly scrumptious. EVERY YEAR MUST!!!

I made the Farfalle black with food coloring so it was even “creepier”. I think I should have baked it a little longer to get the cheese more stringy.

Yummy!!  I used shredded mozzarella cheese and it was supposed to be cubed (I was buying ingredients from memory …. oops).  It was still super yummy.  When I make it again with the cubes, making it a lot stringier, I would give it 5 stars!!

No changes...I made it for my grandkids in Massachusetss last year and they all three loved it!  I just made plans to  go back there again this year and my 9 year old grandson Luke said 
 "oh good, we can have Bats and Cobwebs!"  It's a hit!

This recipe is great for adults at any time of the year. I have made it around three times now, and since we have a rare cool August night, it is baking in the oven now. I made a fresh tomato sauce using lots of basil, and used sauteed red peppers instead of meat.

Delicious and fun!

I used penne, that's what I had on hand.  It turned out delicious.  Quick and easy.  Like lasagna only easier and not so messy to make.  It was a hit with my husband who is not a huge lasagna lover.

Just made this last night for our Halloween festivities and it was delicious! I made it as is and my family LOVED every single bite! Definitely will make it again. Next time I might add to the ground beef a couple of hot Italian sausages (ground or remove the casings) and a little more mozzarella because my family loves it extra cheesy with a little kick, but it is delicious as is! Thank you so much for sharing this delightful recipe Kristin! It was a HUGE HIT! Happy Halloween!

Loved this! I wanted a kick to it after reading several reviews that said it was a bit bland.... I used a 9X13, put in a lb of ground beef and a lb of ground Italian sausage. I used a lot more cheese than necessary and my sauce was Spicy Arrabiata. One note... Another review suggested dying the bats black. Awesome idea. But! Regular food dye to "make those bats black" doesn't work. Ha ha, they ended up sorta grey and weird looking... Get proper black dye for that if it's your goal. Learn from my mistake! I put mine in the oven for 20 minutes, opened it up, gave it another 5 and it was perfect. Spicy, some different textures, lots of ooey gooey cheese... Perfect after a night of trick or treating!

This was a great recipe!  Kids loved it, and it was so easy.  I used my own red sauce as opposed to the jar that was called for, and used a bit more Italian seasoning and a bit extra crushed red pepper as well.

I give this 5 stars because it was easy and good the best combo. I bought a cheep spaghetti sauce and it would have been a lot better with a good sauce so I suggest using a good sauce because that is where most of the flavor comes from.

I made this for our grandchildren and they  really liked it.  I prepared it as directed except that I used a 12 oz. package of pasta. The sauce and cheese were enough for that amount of pasta. I diced the onion very small so as not to be  noticeable to younger tastes - some flavor but the onion was not visible. I'll make this again even if the bats aren't flying!!

This was quite good with Barilla Roasted Garlic , however, following the suggestion of another reader, I used fresh mozzarella, and the cobwebs just didn't happen.  Taste, however, was great.

I've made this as written and it was very good - my family loves it.  My pet peeve is to read reviews where the recipes are  changed  and then rated, and here I went and did that...  I made it again and added a small container of ricotta cheese and it was amazing.  Lasagna, only bat and cobweb style!  It was also a huge hit....

The dish was very good, I added petite diced tomatoes and the Parmesan on half way through cooking it. My brother suggested adding a creamier cheese to it.

My kids and husband love this recipe.  The first time I made it, I only had sweet Italian sausage on hand.  I removed the casing, crumbled it and browned it with the onions.  Gave it an amazing taste!  Used ground beef the second time, and chicken sausage the third time.  Out of all 3 trials, we prefer sweet Italian sausage or chicken sausage over the ground beef.  This dish does not disappoint!?

Easy. Switched to sweet Italien sausage in  chunks. Just mozzarella, bow ties, 1 can tomatoe sauce, Italien sausage. 2 cups mozz., 1  whole package of Italian sausage, 1 box of bow ties. Fits perfectly in a small glass casserole dish. Looks great. Even added leftover cheddar cheese to make it look better.

A tasty crowd pleaser! I took this to a Halloween party, and it was enjoyed by all. I looked for mozzarella to cube, but couldn't find it; shredded worked just as well.

Simple but very good! Made tons. Fairly fast to cook. Added a can of sliced mushrooms - fine with or without. Will definitely make again.

This is good ol' fashioned spaghetti bake. Added some shredded carrots to sweeten it and for something healthy. Hopefully, will taste good.

Good, easy.  Fun for Halloween!  I added mushrooms, green peppers, garlic and a can of diced tomatoes to the sauce, and seasoned the beef a bit as it was cooking.  I used Prego with Chunky Vegetables but still wanted more veggies added.

Love it! Use spicy Italian sausage instead of beef. Better then lasagne!

I altered it slightly and used sausage and turkey burger for a unique flavor. I just threw a bunch of shredded mozzarella in. Pretty good.

I made it meatless since my sister is a vegetarian. Without the ground beef, it doesn't really need the onion, but other than that it was a huge hit

This was good. Cute title! I added some garlic along with the onion . I really enjoyed the cheese cubed up compared to shredded, and I'm pretty sure I added more than called for! My only suggestion is to pick an awesome sauce to use, since there are no other seasonings in the recipe!

I made this as is with some minor and delicious additions. Super easy! Here goes. 
I bought traditional Bertolli so I could add some of my own seasonings. I added a large garlic clove and salt and pepper while the onion and beef were browning. I then added a bay leaf and Italian seasoning once the sauce was put it. Really kicked it up a notch and made it taste like it simmered more than  20 minutes and made the jar-taste disappear. BUT THE BEST PART OF ALL IS THIS: I added fresh mozzarella slices on top of the dish before putting it in the oven and it added a fantastic twist, almost like ricotta. My family thought it was even presentable to guests and almost like a ziti. Big hit and will keep! This is a great easy, busy day recipe to put together if you don't have time to make things from scratch.

Kids really liked it.  I felt like it needed a little more flavor, so next time I will add more Italian seasoning.

Amazing! We used half ground beef and half Italian sausage, seasons the meat with garlic salt, salt, pepper, lemon pepper and garlic. The cheese didn't melt very well because we used low fat string cheese. Overall it's delicious and I will definitel

I used ground turkey and used string cheese cut up into slices and then added shredded cheese too. My whole family loves it including my picky two year old. My seven year old had 3 helpings and my 19 month old ate it well too. Thank you for the recipe it will now be a staple n our house!

I made this for Halloween a couple of years ago, and my kids liked it so much it became a regular staple for our year-round dinners.  I add a little extra sauce, maybe a half a jar extra, because I prefer it with more sauce than on the drier side.  But, this recipe is a hit either way and really hard to mess up!
Tip:  I prefer to mix all the cheese in rather than leave a layer on top.  It gets a little too overcooked when on top for me.  Mixing in also maximizes the cobweb effect!

My kids and grand kids both loved the recipe just the way it is, but as I was surfing other recipes I found one more thing to add to this to make it the perfect Halloween meal. Take thawed meatballs and push  three broken spaghetti noodles through the meatball to make it look like a spider assemble them on top with a little bit of the sauce and/or cheese so they can soften the spaghetti noodles while cooking in the oven!

We loved this -- especially our grandkids -- they thought the bats and cobwebs was a great description.
