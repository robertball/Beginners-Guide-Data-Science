I very loosely followed this recipe and it turned out great!  Saute'd the zucchini and onions in nonstick spray with salt and pepper.  Added grilled chicken and served in warm tortillas for lunch.  Scrumptous!  Loved the dressing.

Ok, but not as good as it sounds. It is more like a garnish or salsa than a salad.

I used 2 medium zucchini.  It didn't go well at our party last weekend.  I agree with the other review that it is more like a relish than a salad.  Not a "keeper" as far as I am concerned.

I enjoyed this salad. I did add lettuce, carrots and cauliflower. I doubled the dressing recipe and added tortilla chips too. Great summer salad!

This was good. I love anything with avocado in it, so this was right up my alley. I used homemade salsa instead of picante sauce, fresh corn, and fresh garlic plus extra sea salt to offset the sweetness of the raw corn. Definitely a keeper.

Wow, this was so delicious! I used a mild southwest salsa in place of the picante sauce, and I cut the oil in half.

Good salad and a bit different from the ordinary. Used garlic powder instead of the salt and a few more seasonings. Thank you Christine!

My in-laws are not big veggie eaters.  They LOVED this recipe.  It's obvious you're eating veggies but somehow it tastes better.  The flavors blend perfectly and it's so light with a bit of tang and spice!  Perfect for summer!

Good served with BBQ and would also be great served as a salsa with tortilla chips.

Made it as is, very good!  Other reviewers may not fully understand the concept of the Daniel Fast, but those who do will appreciate the flavors!  Thank you!

I doubled most of the ingredients since I was taking it to a large gathering.  I added chopped yellow bell pepper and a few chopped, seeded jalapenos for a little kick, and put in extra avocado.  Left out the picante sauce, didn't think it needed it.   I got lots of great comments on it.  Would make it again.

I added hot pico de gallo in place of salsa, which made this perfect.

Quick and easy to make, it was very tasty.
I was looking for a vegan salad to packing my lunch. This worked out well.

Love this recipe. I decreased oil the second time I made it and it still had great flavor.  I also made it as a main part of a lunch by adding black beans - I had doubled the recipe so a 15 ounce can worked well.  Fresh corn enhances the flavor so I definitely would use fresh if available and have the time.

Added black beans and used cucumbers instead of zucchini (husband bought the wrong veggie). Glad he did. Yummy! Ate it two days straight.
