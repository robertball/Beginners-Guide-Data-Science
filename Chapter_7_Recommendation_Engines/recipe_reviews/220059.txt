I cannot afford beef chuck roast right now, I used beef stew meat instead. I also did not have creme fraiche, I used sour cream instead. You could not tell that I used beef stew meat, the meat turned out very tender and juicy. My family all said that this is their favorite stroganoff yet. I served the boys' portions over buttered egg noodles, I ate my portion over steamed garlic broccoli as I'm trying to watch my carb intake.

My family loved this!  I didn't have time to make creme fraiche so I used sour cream. Next time I would like to make it using the creme fraiche.  Don't forget to butter your noodles.  This is so much better than my recipe using cream of mushroom soup.  Highly recommend! You will not be disappointed.

This is hands down one of the best  beef stroganoff recipes I have had in a long time. I did use stew meat and just made sure to brown it good and let it rest a bit and simmered a little longer. Made recipe exactly as written but added an additional 3 Tbs. flour mixed in with some broth to tighten it up a little. The creme fraiche really seals the deal you don't have to go crazy to buy it. If you know you will make this then you can make your own. In a non reactive container mix 1cup heavy cream with 1Tbs of buttermilk or plain yogurt and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Leave out at room temp. around 72 degrees for 24 hours stir once and a while 8 hours or so but not necessary. Warming the cream a little will speed things up a little and it can be used in as little as 12 hours but will not have the consistency you may want. It can go as long as 36 hours I find 24 or so just right. Can be stored in tight container in frige for up to 10 days the cold will stop the fermentation and you Can make ahead. Also great for creamed recipes and potatoes. This recipe is a keeper for sure. I know I will be making it a part of the rotation. Serve over wide egg noodles its great. Be sure to make extra I bumped recipe to ten servings to have some leftovers for lunch you will be glad you did. Reheats well just slow simmer. Happy cooking, GG

oh my gosh, i think that i have made this recipe about 4 times now....it is a fantastic dinner and often requested by my picky husband.   i usually double the shrooms and onions just because we like a lot of veggies.  i DO make my own creme fraiche as chef suggests, it is extremely easy, just consists of cultured buttermilk and heavy whipping cream.  you just need to start it 2 days before you will be making the stroganoff.  it is so much better than sour cream because you can actually simmer it without seperation and reduce the sauce.  well worth the very minimal effort.  be patient when browning your mushrooms, because at first they will appear to just be stewing in their own juices, but then, the water evaporates, but the butter does not, and they begin to brown beautifully.  it usually takes me about 15 minutes to get to this point.  this is a wonderful tip i learned from chef john, before i rushed them and they never got brown....just have to be a bit patient!  anyway, served this on hot buttered poppyseed egg noodles (papadelle from trader joes) and a nice pickled cucumber and onion salad.  thank for reading :)

I can't believe no one's rated this yet. I've made this a few times and I love it! I buy mushrooms with this in mind. I don't always use exact measurements, but kind of eyeball it. It is soooooo good!!

Fantastic and very easy. I bought and used the creme fraiche because I wanted to try this just as the Chef wrote it, but I think in the future I will use sour cream.  I didn't like the runny consistancy that I got with creme fraiche.  The flavor of the dish is absolutely perfect!

Wonderful stroganoff.  I used sirloin steak since that's what I had on hand, but a chuck roast would certainly work fine too since it's slow simmered for awhile.  It was incredibly tender and the flavor was spot on.  I also used red wine instead of white, since that's what I drink, and sour cream instead of creme fraiche.  Served over egg noodles and scaled to serve 4 people, which 2 of us gobbled up like we hadn't eaten in years.  It was THAT good.  The SO said he doesn't like stroganoff but he clearly loved this one.  The chives were a nice touch and I enjoy being able to use things out of our garden.

Amazing! Kids loved this. Instead of letting it simmer on the stove, I browned it up & placed in the slowcooker and left for a class. When I got home, I stirred in the creme, turned on the water for the noodles & chopped a salad. Dinner was done in 15 minutes and it was great.

I followed this recipe exactly and I was very disappointed.  I've been making the Betty Crocker classic beef stroganoff recipe for years, but thought I whould try a more sophisticated recipe.  Well, this is one of those times that I was wrong.  Very shallow flavor, I'll go back to Betty.

It is wrong to say I have a man-crush on Chef John?  I am really enjoying the recipes he has listed here!
My only "beef" with this recipe is that it lacked the tang I was looking for.  I find the creme fraiche just doesn't have the traditional sourness that soured cream brings.  It is still a wonderful dish, though.  As written, that is why I gave it 4 out of five stars.
I made it a second time, and reduced the stock to 1 cup, and used 1.5 cups of soured cream.  This was more to my expectations. But again,even as written, this is truly an astounding recipe.

Excellent recipe!  I used sherry in place of wine, beef consomme in place of beef broth, and sour cream in place of creme fraiche. (Only because that is what I had on hand)  Probably the best stroganoff I have ever had.

The only thing I would suggest to do differently, is to brown the meat in batches.  Yes, it's a little more time consuming, but unless you have a really, REAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally Large skillet, this step as written takes forever to brown, and basically at that point you are steaming your meat, not searing it to get optimum flavor.  Other than that, spot on recipe, very good.

Beef stroganoff is my husbands favorite dish.  This is now his favorite stroganoff recipe.  I only used rounds steak but bc you cook it for an hour it was so tender and good.  I followed the recipe exactly other than that.  OMG.  Loved it.

This is wonderful!  I only made a few minor changes.  1 I used baby bellas, and only 5 to 6 ounces (because most of the family are not big mushroom fans), I accidentally used 2 tablespoons of butter in stead of 1, and added an extra tablespoon of flour because we like the sauces a bit thicker. and I used sour cream cause I didn't have the creme fraiche. I forgot to add the flour to the pan, so I whisked it into the second cup of broth.  it worked perfect.  This was sooo tasty that I could have eaten the whole thing right then and there.  we made quick work of that meal.  there is barely one leftover meal.  LOL! this was GREAT!  definitely a keeper!!

I made this and I used sour cream instead of cream fraiche and it still came out great. I made it in a crockpot omitted the oil and added about 2 tablespoons more flour and about 1/2 cup more beef stock. I have never made this before but my husband loves beef stroganoff he said so I made it for him. He said it was delicious!!!

This was so so so so good.  The only thing I did different was to skip noodles and serve over mashed potatoes using chef john's recipe and it was so darn good.  Comfort food at its best.  Will def be making this one again.

This recipe makes a fantastic stroganoff. Made exactly as written, including fresh crème fraiche per Chef John’s recipe on this site. This is easy to make and you’ll impress anyone who enjoys a great beef stroganoff. See CJ’s videos for making this dish, as well as crème fraiche, if you have any questions. You rock, Chef John.

I'm a huge fan of Chef John and his recipes. This one is no exception! Only change I made was to use a low fat sour cream I had on hand. Still great and will certainly add this to my limited red meat rotation.

For a lower carb option - Used just shy of 2 lbs. of chuck. added another 4oz of mushrooms. Used zinfandel because that is what I had in the house. Used 2tsp "Better Than Bouillon" Beef and 2 cups hot water instead of broth. Had half an onion sitting around so this recipe got an onion and a half of small onions chopped. Very tasty. Used a little sea salt and generous amount of ground black pepper. Served over 1/4 cup of cooked brown rice in a portabella mushroom cap. I sauteed the mushroom caps in butter until golden. Used sour cream because it is what was on hand. Tempted to add plain greek yogurt on hand, but skipped it. Next time. Very tasty. Very easy.

This is my favorite meal of all time.  So I've tried a LOT of recipes.  So far, THIS recipe FAR outshines any I've tried.  I tried this recipe every way possible, with creme fraiche, with sour cream (creme fraich WON!), with stew meat, with chuck, (both were same), and then 1 more time with the two changes I wanted to try, that my other "favorite Beef Stroganoff" has.  They are as follows...

I usually slice my meat on the diagonal, (stew meat is impossible, ask me how I know), and I add garlic salt, paprika and thyme if I have fresh in the garden.  (I LOVE thyme, so it's optional) !  AND, I'm shocked that Chef John didn't add cayenne!! LOL!  Hope these changes help find that "what's missing?" for those that felt that way.  i'd have added a picture of each, except I canNOT figure out how to send a pix from my I-phone 4 to A/R.

Hey Chef John, thanks SO much for the terrific recipe & if you need another idea of what to try, I would LOVE your version of Chicken a'la King!  and/or bread pudding.  Yum! Yum!

My husband wanted stroganoff for his birthday dinner and I couldn't just make the condensed soup kind for his birthday. So I found this recipe - SO good! It totally lived up to the 81 (soon to be 82) 5 star ratings that it had! Not too complicated, but it does take an hour of simmering to complete - so make sure you plan accordingly! We'll definitely be making this again!

Update: I make this regularly now because we love it so much.  I tried once using chuck and we felt like the beef ended up too tough.  I usually use stew beef instead which is cheaper and pre-cut - win win!  The beef ends up very tender and the whole dish is delicious.

Loved it.  Made it exactly as written but added 1/2 t. cayenne for some heat.  It's very rich and makes excellent leftovers.

I've made this a few times and  now I always double the recipe so there is a chance we might have some left overs. I made the creme fraiche and it was very tasty.  A richer taste than sour cream gives.

Excellent!  Everything you want Beef Stroganoff to be!  I used red wine (the only white I had was very sweet) and used regular sour cream.  To speed up cooking a bit, put in less beef broth so you needn't wait so long for the sauce to thicken.

Very good stroganoff. The only problem that I had was that it wasn't as thick as I would have liked it. Even added a little more flour. It didn't effect the taste and will still make it again.

Amazing! Not only is this very easy to make, it's very good. I usually sub the creme fraiche for sour cream because I always have sour cream on hand. And I'm sure that various cuts of meat would work well.  The first time I made this I used cubed, venison tenderloin. It was delicious! I'm so glad that I found a great stroganoff recipe that doesn't use canned ingredients.

This recipe was kind of bland and never really thickened up.  Had to add more sour cream to each bowl to get a better consistency.  Feel like it needs to cook longer and boil off some liquid with the lid off.

OMG. OMG. OMG. 3X OMG. I followed the recipe exactly and it was fabulous. Chef John is making a cook out of this 72 year old that  never believed I could cook anything. Everything Chef John teaches comes out like a dream. Thank you Chef John. I don't know why anyone would pay $19.95 a month for online cooking lessions when all you have to do is call on Chef John!

Made this last night and omg, it was delicious! It was actually my first time ever having beef stroganoff and I was sold. My husband, who grew up on it made with Cream of Mushroom soup was in heaven. I also used homemade creme fraiche, another of Chef John's recipes, and will never go back to store-bought sour cream again!

This was an ok recipe, used sour cream, was hoping for a much richer sauce.  One hour cooking time not enough time to tenderize meat.   Overall average dish.

Modified the recipe based on previous reviews and personal preferences. Added more onion / added a flour and water mix to thicken the sauce / used only 1/2 cup sour cream. Would have given it 5 stars if I didn't need to thicken the sauce. Otherwise, great recipe / easy to prepare!

This had great flavor. I used an extra 8oz of mushrooms and used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream or creme fraiche.  Note to others: if you're going to do that, make sure you let the sauce cool down a bit first or the yogurt will curdle and give it a grainy texture.  I used stew meat and it turned out pretty tough.  Not sure what I did wrong.  Maybe the simmer was a little too hot.  Although there were a few things that went wrong, I will try it again.

I pretty much followed this recipe as written, and it turned out very well!  I didn't make my own crème fraiche this time, but Chef John's recipe for that is spectacular!  I just didn't have the time.  My meat was from Costco, so I didn't have the luxury of having a perfect cut like he did in the video---thus, it took me longer to cook it down, and I added another half cup of broth to keep it going.  This was excellent, and our dinner guests found it very delicious, too!  Thank you once again, Chef!

I used thin slice sirloin beef for this recipe. I omitted the oil and when I browned the beef. Didn't add white wine since I didn't have any and couldn't find just plain wine white or sherry, and didn't add chives. Used Chef John's recipe for crème fraiche. I marinated the beef slices over night with Montreal steak seasoning. Instead of cooking it on the stove, I used a slow cooker. Cooked it on low for 5 1/2 hours. There was too much liquid after 4 hours. I made a rue hoping it would thicken. It did a little. Served it over rice instead of noodles. It tasted really good. I would make it again with less 1 cup of beef broth in the slow cooker.

I cooked this last night for some friends and they loved it.  I will definitely be making it again!

The only minor changes I made were to use Sirloin instead of Chuck and I added some Worcestershire Sauce as well as the salt and pepper.  I forgot the chives but it was still a great meal.

Any negative reviews written about the flavour (or lack thereof) of the dish need to remember to taste the dish before and after adding any seasoning and also taste the dish before serving it.

Wow!  This dinner was unreal.  Totally amazing.  I made this for the first time for a bunch of guests we were having over.  I actually had 3 pans all cooking this dish at the same time to have enough for everyone.  It took longer than expected to make, but the wait was well worth it.  I had so many compliments that I actually felt like a pro!  A great dish to have for a dinner party.

I used beef chuck blade steak, sliced it thin and cooked it in small batches.  I cooked each ingredient separately as I find that onions and mushrooms cooked together don't have as good a flavor as those cooked separately and united afterwards. I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche.   I also increased the flour to 2-1/2 TBSP.  Time consuming but well worth it!  It even tastes good cold.  Thanks Chef John!

This is a winner!  My husband loved it and said it’s better than his mom’s recipe which is almost impossible  since she is an amazing cook. I followed the recipe as is but used cubed beef cut in slices and sour cream.  Absolutely delicious. I love Chef John’s recipes!  Making it again tonight.

This was delicious and easy to make! I used sour cream (figured it would be less calories than creme fraiche) and it was really good. I would definitely make this again.

Delicious!  I made a double batch of this for a co worker and her family when she was down after surgery. Her husband and both young kids loved it. I saved some for the hubby and I also and we loved it too!  I used stew meat and sour cream but everything else I made exact!

When I saw this was made with chuck roast, I was skeptical. All of the stroganoff recipes I've seen have called for more tender cuts, one even calling for tenderloin. But I rolled with it, and was I ever glad I did! The long, slow cooking ensured tender, succulent beef, and the flavor was amazing! I added about a teaspoon of Dijon mustard toward the end because it just isn't beef stroganoff without the mustard, but I forgot to add the sour cream and I never even missed it. I served it over smashed boiled potatoes for a hearty, intensely flavorful dinner. I know beef is expensive, and this recipe is no exception, but as rich as it is, you get far more servings per pound than you would from blander meals. Thanks, Chef John, for showing me a tastier (and more practical) way to make a beloved meal.

Not fair to make changes and rate it so I followed the recipe as written.  I will say as he stated there is not a lot of sauce . He also doesn't give the amount or type of noodles. I recomend that you double the flour and wet ingredients.

We enjoyed this recipe very much although it wasn't as flavorful as other recipes I used.  I will, however make it again.  It will be something I make about 4-5 times per year.  Thanks Chef John!

Awesome!! Although I added green pepper and about twice the garlic. AND I completely forgot to add the creme fraiche (sour cream in my case) before serving. Didn't miss it though.

Awesome!! I didn't have white wine so I used chicken broth instead, and sour cream in place of the cream. I also just had one left over steak so I used that. I cooked it whole in the pan with veg. oil, then sliced it and threw it in the last 10 minutes. I also only cooked the sauce for about 30 minutes and it was great!! All my super picky kids loved it and so did my picky husband.

Another great recipe! Followed the recipe exactly with the sour cream subsitution. My little family of three inhaled the entire 3 and a half pounds in one evening... I was sure it would last two day, but it was delicious! My husband swears sprinkling it with chopped dill pickles makes this fabulous.

This was pretty good.  I accidentally forgot to buy white wine, so I ended up using white wine vinegar instead.  That was the only change I made.  It was definitely a mistake, but I did not remove the star for that, since I don't think it's right to rate down a recipe if you've made changes.  I did not add any extra liquid, though, and the sauce was a little too runny for my taste.  I think I might even have used less liquid.  I will try it again with actual white wine, but I suspect it will still be too runny.

Excellent...simple, good ingredients and the wine brings out such a pleasant flavor. I have made Chef John's recipe several times and I do use sour cream and a add a half cup of Parmesan cheese at the end. And yes, serve over butter noodles....excellent! Thank you John.

Have you tried this recipe? What did you think?Chefn - this is quite good. My uncle Vasha taught me how to make authentic Russian stroganoff, using SL;ICED LONG STTRIPS OF SIRLOIN, SLICED VERY THIN GARLIC AND ONIONS, SOME RED WINE, A COUPLE TABLESPOONS OF TOMATO PASTE AND LOTS OF SOUR CREAM. DELICIOUS SERVED OVER THIN SHOESTRING POTATOES OR TOAST POINTS. ALL RUSSIAN STYLE. FABULOUS - JUST MADE SOME 2 DAYS AGO

This was the first dish made on our new stove late one Saturday night after a really long day.  But it was more than worth waiting for.  This will be a regular for a long time on our menu.  Thanks Chef John!

I followed the recipe exactly and this was a huge hit with me and my family. It was tender, full of warm deep flavor and just down right delicious. I will definitely make this again and I think it is safe to say that it will work pretty well with most cuts of beef due to the long simmer period. If the meat isn't quite tender yet, then let it simmer a little more and it will be. DELICIOUS!

Just made this for dinner.  YUM!  I did substitute cooking sherry for the white wine, and sour cream for the creme fraiche, but next time I may just leave that out altogether.   It is really rich and delicious without and doesn't really need the extra calories to pump up the flavor.  This is one I will make for company! Thanks for sharing the recipe Chef John.  I love that you walk us through these recipes on your videos!

I made this recipe a couple years ago for a gathering and everyone said it was the best beef stroganoff they’ve ever had. I did make creme fraiche And made it exactly as you showed us. I would like to make this again and I am wondering if I can use a thick New York steak cut in strips. Mainly because that is what I have on hand.

I followed most of the recipe, added some herb, substituted with sour cream. Mix egg noodles in the beef, let it absorbed the gravy. The dish was very delicious, will make it again!

I made it as written but had to exchange creme fraiche with sour cream. My famiy (all adults) says it was fine but not great. They were more generous than I. I was very disappointed in it. It was not very flavorful! I got sirloin stir fry strips as suggested. I did not add as much written (no measurements provided) because some of us have salt/heart issues. I don't usually salt as I cook and add as needed on my plate. Sorry Chef John, this one needs some work!

This recipe had fantastic flavor. The recipe was simple and easy to make. I found the gravy to be a bit soupy. I will adjust it next time and I will enjoy it more. I didn't have crème fraiche so I used sour cream. Next time Ill have crème fraiche.

I adjusted for slow cooker (for work night meal):  Season beef with salt and pepper to taste. 
For slow cooker method; I sautéed the meat and placed in slow cooker once browned. Reduce beef liquid in sauté pan, then add butter, 1 chopped onion, 8 oz mushrooms and garlic till softened, then add 2 T flour and cook for a few minutes, then put all in slow cooker with beef. Add 3 1/2 cups beef broth, and 1 T Worcestershire (wine not needed) and stir to combine and cook on low 4-6 hrs. When cooked thicken with slurry, then add sour cream just before serving.

Delicious!!  Thanks, Chef John, for the best tasting stroganoff I've ever had!!  Not a wine connoisseur, I bought one of those little black box wines thinking it was white wine but as it turned out it was RED!!  Anyway, I think it was a really good mistake because this dish turned out so flavorful.  I also added some mixed herbs and used beef bone broth and truffle salt which I think also added to the overall taste (Chef John, I didn't think you'd mind!..."after all you are the whatever of the whatever!!").   I tasted it before adding the creme fraiche and concluded that this would be a wonderful beef and gravy recipe to serve over noodles, mashed potatoes or rice.  Though we did like it per recipe too.  It's a keeper!!!!

I loved the richness of the sauce, and the tenderness of the beef! For my first attempt; I was quite satisfied. My Mother always served egg noodles with her stewed beef. One of many memorable dishes. Kudos Chef John!

This was delicious! I followed the recipe  exactly and it was straightforward and easy.  Next time I will double the mushrooms.  I used a chuck roast not from a butcher shop and it took me about 20 minutes to trim and prep the meat, but it was worth the time.  Don't forget to butter your noodles before serving! Yum!

This was so good. I thought the meat might turn out a little tough as Beef Stroganoff recipes I've tried in the past have been but I made this recipe exactly as written and it was so tender. And make sure you make Chef John's homemade creme fraiche a few days in advance.  It's so good and easy.  Love this recipe.

PERFECT recipe, though I did make a couple of changes. First, I substituted chicken stock for the beef stock in order to give it a lighter feel. And my family loves mushrooms, so we doubled the amount. Also, we don’t eat a lot of red meat, so I used shrimp instead. Left out the white wine, used bananas instead of onion, and served it over rice instead of noodles. And instead of the creme fraiche I used the power of prayer. Highly recommended!

I left out the onions (which bother my IBS), used 1/2c greek yogurt instead of the creme fraiche and replaced the wine with more broth (since I didn't have any). It was delicious and the meat was super tender!

I admit, I was skeptical that chuck could be tender in such a short time, but it really was! This dish is excellent, and it's amazing  that so much flavor can be achieved with so few ingredients. Thank you, Chef John!

I followed the recipe pretty closely (aside from doubling the garlic).  Turned out really well.  Watching the video helped a lot; I never would have cooked the beef long enough or hot enough to get it to brown.

Such a GREAT flavor! I needed to add a little extra flour to thicken it up. I take some of the broth and whisk it up with a couple more tablespoons flour at the end. Also two 8oz packs of mushrooms. Otherwise yum!!

My wife rated this at A+ which is a rate rating for her.  Other than cooking it for ~1 hour, the recipe was flawless.  Just about any noodle will work; we did not have the wide noodles and used a mixture of noodles.  Either way it worked just fine.

We have made this several times it keeps getting better every time.  The Creme Fraiche makes this a deceptively and incredibly rich dish.  We usually serve this with home made Spätzle.

Nice, but needs tomato paste (2T) and Worcestershire (2T).  I think thin-cut Round Steak works better, less fat.

Real good. I used chuck pot roast so I had to cook about 4 hours. Added a lot more mushrooms because I love them and it cuts down on the calories. Will keep this recipe in the rotation!

I thought this was good, but not great. Used left over prime rib and sour cream. It just seemed to be missing something compared to my old recipe (that I can't find), and needed more depth, in my opinion.  Maybe red instead of white wine and a little dijon? The leftovers were better the next day after the sauce melded with the egg noddles.

Easy to make.  Tastes great.  I used top sirloin instead of a roast.

It came out exactly as the video Chef John posted and it was absolutely amazing. I doubled the recipe and fed 6 people. There were no leftovers except some egg noodles. I guess I’ll be making it again. Real soon.

I planned on beef stew for dinner but didn't have any carrots so if course I have to check All Recipes to find another amazing recipe. Well, I found it! The whole dish takes maybe 1 1/2 hours to prepare and cook.  I used stew beef a s that's what I had, same with using sour cream instead of creme fresche. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a tee. With browning the meat and browning the onions and mushrooms, it was just another hour to cook and the meat was tender. Between hubby and myself, there was only enough left for a single serving. I served with wide egg noodles and a nice spinach salad on the side. Thank you Chef John. Another recipe to add to my repetroire!

This was excellent.  My wife LOVED it.  She said other stroganoffs I've made were good, but this was the best.  And she's a bit of a picky eater.

Awesome Beef Stroganoff.  I used virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I cooked the meat in Angelina Sauvignon Blanc wine and I bought prepared creme fraiche rather then wait 24 hours to make my stroganoff and it turned out fantastic.  Thank you Chef John for another spectacular Sunday Dinner and my husband thanks you too!!!!!

We totally enjoyed this.  I'm Keto so I used xantham gum to thicken instead of flour.  I also used sour cream and dry sherry in place of creme fraiche and white wine.  I served mine over cauliflower rice and my husband's over egg noodles.

This is the BEST recipe ever!  It was SO good!!!    I used thinly sliced top round and substituted chicken broth instead of wine.  I also tripled the mushrooms because we like a lot of mushrooms.  Before I served it I stirred in only 2 heaping tbsp. of sour cream instead of the cream that was listed in the recipe.  The best Beef Stoganoff that I have ever eaten!!!

This recipe was delicious! I used a pino grigio wine and substituted a 50/50 mix of mascarpone cheese and sour cream for the creme fresh. The flavours were amazing. I will be making this again :)

This is a very good recipe. However, I made a few changes. I used sirloin steak. I should have cut the strips thinner and not as long. Instead of white wine, I used red (a little extra too). But this was a really good tasting stroganoff. The meat was very tender and flavorful. I will use this recipe again. I was glad that there wasn't sour cream or cream cheese.

I agree with several others, definitely needed more flavor. Plus I thought the sauce needed to be a little thicker, so I'll add a little more flour next time.

Used Sour Cream Instead of Crème Fraise and I increased the Sour Cream By Half. Didn't have the two days to wait for the crème fraise, but will try to plan ahead next time. Loved it!! Will Definitely make it again.

Hands down--the best I've made or eaten. I've tried various wines and liquors, cuts of beef, and methods, and it always turns out stellar. I make this once a week.  For those who said there was too little flavor, mine has always packed a punch of delicious, rich flavor, but I can only suggest that  seasoning the beef more generously from the beginning with kosher salt and pepper before beginning to cook might help.

Recipe was quite simple and easy to adjust. I added some red wine to give it a richer flavor. Next time, I will also use more mushrooms, which I enjoy as much as the beef. The real bonus of this recipe lies in using creme fraiche. First, you get to learn how to spell creme fraiche, just to search for the recipe. Then, Chef John has a very simple recipe here that was easy and fun. I will use it lots in the future. It was delicious.

I didn't quite make this recipe because I can't stand mushrooms.  What I had on hand was peppers, onions, 1 lb skirt steak and shoaxing cooking wine when I ran across this recipe.  So I used what I had and followed the instructions, cooking the green peppers with the onions.  I used only 1/4 cup of the cooking wine but followed the other measurements to a tee.  It was amazing.  I can totally see making this with broccoli as well.  The sauce was the bomb and the beef was oh so tender after cooking it for an hour.  Served over egg noodles and tried real hard not to eat it all in one sitting.

Delicious recipe. I decided to try a new recipe and this one is a winner. I used  crème fraîche and loved it. This recipe is  rich, smooth and  flavorful. I highly recommend!  Don’t forget fresh chives to top it off. We served over rice ??

I marinated the stew beef in red wine for an hour prior to cooking. When done marinating, pat the beef dry reserving the red wine marinade to use later in place of the white wine.  I also like to add a pinch of nutmeg and a tablespoon or two of dry sherry at the end. Amazing!

I used beef chuck and followed the recipe exactly, but even braising for the entire time, the meat was not as tender as I had hoped.  I wonder if short ribs would make a meatier tasting, more tender product.  I may try again, but not in a big rush to do so.

I highly recommend this recipe.  It turned out sooo good and super flavorful.  I used sirloin instead of chuck, so I didn't need to cook it so long, but other than that, I followed the recipe pretty much to a tee.  Oh, and I added a Tbsp of Dijon mustard when adding the other liquids, since most Stroganoff recipes seem to call for that.  I'm sure it would have still been delicious without this addition.  I took the extra step of making homemade creme fraiche as recommended in Chef John's Food Wishes blog and in the video.  It was so simple and turned out wonderfully.  Couldn't have been more happy with this whole thing.  The only mistake I made was that I probably should have reduced the sauce just a bit more before adding the creme fraiche, since my final product was a little more loose than I prefer.  But I was still licking the plate clean at the end! :)  Give this a try!

Only change I made was to pound beef so it was more tender.  This is he best stroganoff I’ve ever made.  I will definitely put it in the rotation! Thanks, Chef John!

Not bad,  but something was missing. Maybe the meat needed more seasonings.  Will try again though

This recipe does not have the stroganoff kick it is supposed to have.  It kind of sucks at best.

It’s a must try and my new go to stroganoff. Like other reviewers have said use the creme vs sour cream. Plus it’s so easy to make.

I will defiantly make this again. Only change I made was just regular sour crème I did not have crème fraiche. Best beef stroganoff I have had in a long time. Might add just a pinch of red pepper next time.

Made 1/2 recipe for two of us.  Simmered 40 minutes - that was plenty (we tenderized the meat prior to slicing into strips).  Used a dollop of sour cream instead of creme fraiche.   Excellent!

I made no changes to the original recipe of the sauce but I did use left over London Broil that had been frozen previously.  The sauce turned out wonderful but the London Broil did not compliment the sauce.   Next time I will use a better cut of beef.

Nothing to really brag about.  It took a long time to get what didn't amount to much more than I'd get out of a box of pre-mixed Stroganoff from the grocer store.  3 out of 5 for me.  Had high hoped but was left feeling it was lacking.

Perfect, wouldn't (and didn't) change a thing.

Whenever I want to make something I haven't made before I search for a 'chef john' recipe.  As always this one didn't disappoint.  Occasionally I'll tweak a few things based on my tastes but not in this case.  Make this just as he describes and you won't be disappointed.

Yummy yummy! Followed exactly except subbed in lactose-free sour cream. I’ll add more mushrooms next time, but that’s just our family preference. Recipe was perfection.

An easy and sure fire recipe for great Stroganoff. 
I used sous vide roast beef so I didn’t have to simmer long, and served it over rice noodles as that’s what I had on hand (they are gluten free).
Simple recipe is a winner.

I didn't have time for original recipe so made it with ribeye filets. Pan seared steaks to medium rare. Prepared sauce as described. Sliced steaks just before serving to keep med-rare and not over cooked. Placed in sauce to slightly reheat steak and plated servings. I added a pinch of nutmeg to sauce to enhance aroma and taste. Everyone loved it.

This is the best beef stroganoff that I have ever made.  I also made the Creme Fraiche.  I really believe that the Creme made a difference.

Great recipe. As I do with just about everything, I doubled the garlic. I used sirloin steak for a more tender cut.  Don’t skimp on salt and peppering the beef before cooking. It brings out the flavor.  And I used sour cream instead of creme fresche and it was delicious.

Extremely Yummy!! This is an easy recipe to make and follow, especially if you watch the video. I had a bit of a problem getting the butcher where I live to cut a special chuck roast for me but other than that things went well. I had to simmer the beef for a little over an hour and a half to get it tender. I used Chef John's recipe for the homemade Creme Fraiche, and oh my heavens was it ever good.

I love beef stroganoff and when I heard a coworker talking about making this dish, I hopped online looking for an easy recipe. This one was it. It was so incredibly easy to make and the beef turned out very tender. Even after reheating leftovers for lunch the next day, it still had wonderful flavor. Since I did like the sauce a little creamier, I added a bit more beef broth to the finished product and it was perfect.  My husband wants to make more next time because he loved it so much. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that will be added into our dinner rotation!

I made this with tenderloin steak for my husband and I. Because it's tender meat, I didn't need to cook it for a long time. Quick and easy! And very yummy served over cubed fried potatoes made from leftover baked potatoes. I actually used the white wine, which I typically don't because I never have any on hand. But thinking ahead, I bought three bottles of cooking wine just to have it when needed. I've made this recipe before without it and it's still very good. The wine adds an gentle acidic taste, different but very good.

I made it! This was my first time ever making homemade Beef Stroganoff, since we don't count hamburger helper. It took a long time to make, this was no fast and easy recipe, but I wasn't looking for that. 
I made it exactly as described and I'm already pondering some modifications. For starters not cooking the beef until last, and starting first with the mushrooms because they need the most time. 
It was truly delicious as is though, even tasted good reheated as leftovers later on. Now I stay home for Beef Stroganoff. Thank you!

Made it per directions including low fat creme fraiche  No changes. Served with roasted Brussels sprouts and broiled artisan baguette. The low fat creme fraiche took two days in the frig after the initial first day to fully setup.  It’s totally worth the wait.

This was really good.  We bought the cheapest beef and made it in a crockpot and it turned out great!  Sear the beef and veggies first, and cook on low for 8 hours.  We used sour cream at the end instead and really loved it.

I’ve made this two or three times now, always awesome. I use a lot more stock and reduce it down, to concentrate the flavor. Use some soy sauce for and umami boost. Finish with some white wine vinegar. I never have the chives to finish it with though.

I used lower sodium beef broth and sirloin instead of chuck, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I was a bit disappointed with the flavor. It was good, but I prefer a heartier and tangier stroganoff.  Maybe I should have stuck with the regular broth and used sour cream instead.

We thought this recipe was phenomenal; my partner can't stop raving about it over a week later!  The creme fraiche was a hit, although we'll use sour cream in a pinch if need be.  Not against ground beef versions of stroganoff, but this version was like dinning at a five star restaurant at home!

That said, I like more green things in my food.  I'm probably veering far off the authentic path here, but next time I'm going to add more green onion, some frozen peas and maybe some broccoli and/or spinach.

I made this for the first time tonight.  It came together very well although I like my sauce a little thicker so added some cornstarch. I was also looking for a little bit more flavor, but couldn’t figure out what it needed.  My spouse loved it but I don’t know if it’s ready to go into the rotation yet.  Can anyone suggest what might kick the flavor up a notch?

I used Teriyaki sauce as a marinade. Cooked the meat & discarded the sauce. I used 21/2 c of beef broth & increased the flour to 1/3 c. I added 1 T worstchesire sauce & 1 t mustard. Since the beef was tender I didn’t cook it on low for an hour. Tasty! I’ll make it again.

This is the 2nd time I have done this recipe, and always a great hit! every time I followed the recipe to a T by doubling the size of the serving recommendation because I have a bigger family and OMG, so, so good! (1st time was with creme fraise & 2nd time with sour cream (not the cheap kind) and oh boy, possibly no difference in taste! This is so yummy! (Could not get a single muscle beef cut unfortunately so worked around the membranes and fat & have a gas stove, time slightly varied so I eye balled it) Thank you Chef John from me, hubby & kids! DELISH!!!

Have never made homemade stroganoff before and this was very good.  I chose this recipe because of the wine.  Very easy to make.  I bought stew meat as well, and though I cut the bigger pieces down I should have cut all the pieces smaller.  And instead of adding the sour cream to the pan at the end I just added it to the individual dishes  as a dollop on top for presentation and personal taste.

Of course, I made a few tweaks.
I had a sale hunk of top round steak, and I let it sit in the measured wine and first cup of broth while I added the oil to the pan and let it heat up.  I reserved the mixture and added it back in later with a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce.  Also, the only wine I had readily available was a red petite shiraz, which I would use again in a heartbeat.  I did use sour cream, and all of it topped buttered egg noodles. There was just the perfect amount of sauce. This was a good comfort food dish for a cold day.

I made this recipe yesterday, following the instructions exactly. The flavor was "milder" than I thought it would be. My experience with beef stroganoff prior to this has been limited to Hamburger Helper(shameful, I know). Next time,  I'll use more onion and garlic and perhaps a bit of Worcestershire sauce. Thanks Chef John for a platform which to start from.

I followed the recipe exactly, even made my own creme fraiche (Chef John was correct: very easy!) I wasn't very impressed with the results until I added the creme fraiche, and then WOW! I used a chuck roast, and would consider using a nicer cut of beef next time since the results are so good it's a shame to have  some chewy pieces of meat in it. The other issue I had was the serving size. The recipe says it serves 8, but that's only 1/4 pound of beef per serving. The folks I cook for want more meat than that, so consider your diners when deciding how much to cook.

Certainly a great basic recipe.  I used sour cream and a little heavy cream for thickening. Make sure you use enough garlic and seasoning.  It makes all the difference!

Very good. I add a few dashes of gravy master too it at the end, if your grocery store has chuck roast on sale, chances are they have chuck eye steak on sale also. It’s usually a little more per pound cost wise, but you can cut the cooking time almost in half

This takes awhile to put together but it's easy enough.  I couldn't find the right cut of meat so I too bought stew meat. I cut it up small so it wouldn't be tough and used 16 oz whole mushrooms.  It was pretty good over boiled buttered noodles and steamed baby carrots on the side.  I found pre-made creme fraiche at the Safeway store and used that. Adding this one to my beef favorites.

I never liked beef stroganoff until I made this recipe. Much better than other recipes I've tried for this dish. The whole family loved it.

My husband absolutely LOVES this recipe.  He would be very happy having it once a week.  It is quick, easy and absolutely delicious!  The only thing I do differently is to add a little worcestershire sauce and use a more tender beef so it doesn't have to cook as long.  This recipe is in the permanent rotation.

Thanks again, Chef John. I make this about once a month and it's wonderful. I double the mushrooms, 'cause I love mushrooms, and use a dry sherry instead of wine. I add some at the end so the flavor of the sherry  doesn't cook off. Sometimes I serve over rice as the mood strikes.  I have older kids and if I want them to hang for dinner, I just mention in the morning that I'm making it. Never fails, lol.

We definitely enjoyed it!  I used sour cream, as that's what we had on hand.   I think next time, I'll use the slow cooker after browning the beef chunks, to ensure more tender morsels of beef, and perhaps add some additional herbs, or even just a bit of mustard to pump up the flavor a tad more.  Overall it's a tasty and easy dish to make though.  :)

Would definitely make this one again. Changed very little. Browned the meat in a Power Pressure Cooker , then added half of the broth, with a chopped onion and some garlic. Cooked till tender. Set aside meat. Rest of the recipe was done as described other than sour cream substituted. Added the meat back in to mixture just before adding sour cream. I really liked this recipe, family loved it.

This one is a winner - judged by the speed at which my three growing boys slurped up every last morsel.

I'm not a cook at all, but I'm now forced to cook because our children are refusing to eat what they're being served because they're "sick of" the same old things.  So, after seeing them "oo" and "ah" over photos of Beef Stroganoff in a cookbook, I took a crack at this one.

- I'm trying to reduce red meat intake so I used 3/4 of a lb of flank steak.
- I dribbled a tablespoon of light soy and a tablespoon of sherry over the sliced meat and left it for 10 minutes before searing it.
- I used a lot more round onions (2 onions) than the recipe calls for.
- I sliced the mushrooms thinly because my boys don't like the rubbery texture of mushrooms.
- I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil but used the exact amounts the recipe calls for.
- I ended up using 3 bouillon cubes (Knorr) with about 3-4 cups of water (there was quite a bit of evaporation). 
- I used light sour cream instead of creme fraiche.

Served over egg pappardelle.  The taste was amazing.

I make Beef Stroganoff using top sirloin steak or round steak, and the wine I use is a burgundy wine (it is more full bodied).  Instead of crème fraiche I use sour cream.

I started the recipe on the stove the evening before. Let it cool down and the next morning transfered it into a slowcooker. 
It was succulent and soooo tasty. Added much more crème fraiche and thickened it with some maizena, because we like a bit more sauce.

OMG this is fantastically delicious. I used sliced tri-tip roast instead of chuck and the same cooking time. The cream fraiche  really makes a difference.  It imparts a delicious depth of flavor. I used the whole 8 oz. carton. Served over buttered wide noodles with petite green peas, it was a dinner winner.

Delicious!  Just because I had to use what I had, I used red wine instead of white and plain Greek yogurt instead of the creme fraiche. I also ran out of time and cooked it for about 40 minutes instead of an hour, and my family loved it.

I used mashed potatoes via Chef John's Perfect Mashed Potatoes as a bed for the main affair.  I also substituted green onion for chives, which gave it a little stronger onion zing.  Fantastic!  Bravo!

I've made this dish at least 3 times and we love it.
I make 2 small modifications:  I add a beef bouillon cube to the meat and sauce during the simmering process to deepen the beef flavor and I use sour cream instead of cream fraiche...other than that I didn't change a thing.  This recipe is amazing and among one of my favorites!
Thanks, Chef John!

Absolutely delicious. I was a little unsure about this recipe because it seemed too "fancy schmancy gourmet." But, I made it just as written and it turned out better than I had hoped. Leftovers were even better. I ate the leftovers over rice. My whole family loved it.

This was easy to make and very tasty. The creme fraiche was a nice twist on the traditional sour cream. It was a little liquidy the first night, but as leftovers... it was phenomenal!

I'm giving it a 5 star simply because I only used this as a guideline...we lived with a Norwegian family in France and she made Beef Stroganoff in an awesome way...so this recipe was closest to the way she made it...I used a bunch of spices including thyme rosemary  and paprika I also used tons of fresh garlic as my husband and I love garlic....I'm talking whole bulb...I also made alot of it...I used freshly made mashed potatoes simply because neither one of us like egg noodles...and I used heavy whipping cream instead of creme fraise or sourcream...there were a bunch of other adjustments I made...my husband said this was the best version yet....as it was only my second time making it since we've come back from France

Really enjoyed this meal.  I just had regular spaghetti because that is what I prefer and it was a great stick to your ribs meal.  I also used beef stew meat because that was what I originally intended on making but didn't have the time.

It wasn't as tasty as I had hoped it to be.  I didn't have concentrated beef broth on hand and I think using non-concentrated broth it made the taste less intense.  I'll try it again and maybe cook the meat until the juices are gone before adding the broth.

This recipe turned out perfectly.  Very flavorful and easy.  I didn't have creme fraiche so I subbed sour cream and mascarpone.

My husband is lactose intolerant  so creams of any type are a no go. I used Fage plain yogurt, came out beautiful. I would have never thought of that had it not been for the creme fraiche mention in the ingredients. I have used fage yogurt in other recipes that call for creme fraiche. Great substitute.

Loved this recipe and made it as written with the exception of using sour creme instead of creme fraiche and I doubled the mushrooms. I really loved that it used less cream and it really made the flavor of the beef stand out.

Beef chuck roast is out of my price range, so I used beef stew meat instead. I forgot the sour cream and flour but it still turned out pretty tasty. I threw everything - except the pasta - in the crock pot and cooked it for about four hours on low. I then added the pasta and a bit more beef broth about twenty minutes before I ate it. I'll definitely make this again. It was so easy!

This was a fantastic recipe.  I've made other stroganoff's that made me feel somewhat queasy or lacked flavor - especially the ones that are done in a slow cooker.  The flavors were robust, well balanced and very fresh.  Didn't have creme fraiche nor time to make it so I used the sour cream I had on hand and came out perfect.  My husband and I loved this and will be adding it to our regular rotation.  Love the use of a cheaper cut of beef and the treatment thereafter to make it tender and delicious.  I'd even say this is probably the best stroganoff I've ever had - better than anything at a restaurant I've had for sure.

Great recipe. My wife was weary of it, since she's not a big fan of stroganoff, but she gave it a big thumbs up. We will be making this again.

I made several changes (used Greek yogurt, added more butter, etc.).  This recipe required quite a bit of flavor building in the beef department so I can't give it five stars.  I used  soy sauce, Better than Bouillon beef base, a brown gravy starter etc. to get the depth of flavor needed to make this a five star recipe. So I'll call it a really great inspiration recipe but lacking in flavor on its own.  If you are not an experienced cook, you might be slightly disappointed with this one as-is unless you add the things I mentioned -- to taste.  I bought top round thin sliced Stroganoff beef from the grocery. Salt and peppered the beef.  I used almost double the mushrooms called for and cut them in thick chunks and left many smaller ones whole (they all but disappear over the cooking time). I don't think you could put too many mushrooms in this dish -- the more, the better. I used two different varieties. The beef was tender after an hour and the gravy/sauce was the perfect consistency; really tasty. Served over buttered egg noodles. My husband and kids gobbled this up and paid compliments.  I will be adding my version of this recipe to the regular rotation. I love that I don't have to use cream canned soup. In future, I'll limit the sour cream by using more Greek yogurt than creme fraiche (I don't even bother with the $6 creme fraiche anymore after making this at least half a dozen times now -- I  just use sour cream and Greek yogurt as I typically have both on hand and they'r

Made it last night and it's was a hit. I would review the creme fraiche, too,  but could find only ultra pastureized (had it) , not reg plain pastureized. But had sour cream on hand. Used it, and it's true that it curdles and break into tiny bits. Still, it tasted great. Maybe not as creamy  but that's an experiment for another day.

I made this beef strogonoff for my Mother in law after a trip we made to Russia. It came out very salty, I think it's mainly because of the beef broth. I have added more cream and teaspoon of mustard.

I like my stroganoff a little on the tangy side, just before serving I added some diced cornichon's, and I love skirt steak so I used it. It's good to see someone that likes the same stroganoff as me. Some people add tomato, but yuck. I like sticking to the way my old Chef taught me.

I hadn’t made beef stroganoff in ages, so when I saw this recipe, I had to try it.  I followed the recipe pretty closely with just a few minor changes.  I put my chuck roast in the freezer for about 40 minutes, which made it easier to cut, and I cubed it, rather than cutting it into slices.  I had better luck browning the beef in two batches rather than tossing it all in at once.  I used a full can (1 3/4 cups) of beef broth, and sour cream instead of crème fraiche.  I made this early in the day and added the sour cream just before re-heating.  I find that if you add sour cream to a recipe that’s hot, it tends to curdle and look grainy.  It tastes fine, but the appearance is quite unappealing.  So just before reheating, I ladled some of the stroganoff sauce into a small bowl, whisked in just 1/4 cup the sour cream (I thought 3/4 cup was way too much) and then added it back to the beef.  Worked great!  This was very good and I would make it again.  Next time, I would check the beef sooner, as mine didn’t need a full hour to become tender and consequently was a little dry.

My husband does not care for creamy beef stroganoff but he liked this!  My picky kids liked it also.  I added a whole onion instead of half and very little creme fraiche (which I found at a local market) to the main mixture. Probably about a heaping teaspoon. I added more creme fraiche to my plate since I love the creamy taste & it does taste better than sour cream.  This was easy to amend to my family's different likes & delicious!!

As I was making this I was worried that the flavor would be lacking.  I almost added some herbs in the middle, but forced myself to make it as written the first time. In the end the flavor was great and we really enjoyed it.  My only negative was that the sauce didn't thicken as much as I would have liked.  Nothing I can't tweak a little in the future, though.  I'll definitely make this again.

Absolutely perfect!!! Made it entirely as written using sour creme instead of creme fraiche and doubling the mushrooms. Oh, and red wine instead of white. Perfect consistency, thickness of sauce, and tenderness of meat. Delicious! Can't wait to make it again. As others have said, do not forget to butter your noodles :)

This recipe is delicious and is my go to recipe for beef stroganoff.  I've made this recipe several times, and I have a word of caution for you short-cutters out there: make sure you cook the meat long enough to  let all the liquid evaporate. Don't stop short and try to strain the liquid. If the meat doesn't give off everything, then your sauce will be watery at the end!

Although the entree simmered (covered) on the stove longer than the recipe stated, the sauce was still thin. I wish I'd let the beef dish sit on the stove (uncovered) for a little longer before serving because the sauce thickened to a nice consistency. The beef came out very tender, with a savory sauce. I used about 1/2 cup of sour cream, but we found it very tasty even without the sour cream.

I have to admit that this was not my favorite stroganoff recipe.  I thought it lacked in flavor.  The only change I made was to use cognac instead of white wine as I was out of white wine.  This should of added more flavor so cant imagine the lack in flavor with just white wine.  I won't make this again.. will stick to my other stroganoff recipe.

I added one can of beef broth in order to have more gravy.  Next time I would also add more onion slices. I also finished it in the oven.

Excellent! Cheap stir fry meat turned into the most delicious juicy morsels. The sauce came out a bit thin so I may compensate for that when I make it again, but the flavor was perfect. I'm the stroganoff lover in this house, and yet even my Mr. went back for seconds, which is a big deal for him.

Good tasting. Will use a little more flour to thicken sauce next time.  After an hour the meat was tender so added creme fraiche but sauce became too soupy so that was very disappointing after spending all that time and splurging for the creme fraiche.

Very tasty! As someone else suggested, I used a sirloin roast instead and it was tender. I didn't have any creme fraiche and used sour cream and some cream cheese instead. My sauce was a bit runny, so I added some cornstarch to thicken it up. The sauce was also a bit on the "bland" side. So during the hour of cook time, I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, 2 bay leaves, 1/2 tsp of thyme, and 1/2 teaspoon of italian seasoning. Also, next time I will use less salt. But very good over egg noodles!

I did not intentionally make changes or substitutions but used what I had on hand......which was bullion cubes, canned mushrooms and sour cream.   I had no idea what creme fracais was........near the end of cooking time I tossed in the noodles.   I didn't give it a second thought when we sat down to eat until my husband exclaimed how much he liked it!    Making it again tonight for a friend and because I didn't get enough the first time!!!   LOL

I will definitely make many times more, it was scrumptious! My husband loved it and then loved it again as lunch the next day. I used a strip steak from the freezer and sour cream since I had both on hand, but otherwise followed exactly. I prefer more sauce on the noodles so making as directed with a smaller amount of meat allowed for that. The pan was worthy of scraping to get anything left---the flavor was amazing!!! Make it, you and all else will love it!  Thanks, Chef John, you NEVER disappoint!!!

It was great I followed the recipe, I only had moscato wine, it worked like a charm. It turned out sooo good. I'll make it again. I used my electric frying pan to make it.

After reading many recipes I decided on this one (because Chef John never disappoints ;) I used what I had on hand. The changes were not enough to really change  the finished dish too much. I had top sirloin steak in the freezer that needed to be used, dry sherry that I also needed to finish up, sour cream and dried shiitake mushrooms.   This was great! Even my husband who says he doesn't like Beef Stroganoff loved it! This will be in the regular rotation from now on. Thank you Chef John!

This is a decent base recipe; however, it needs more seasoning than salt and pepper. I added several dashes of worcestershire sauce, a bay leaf, and Badia steak seasoning. If I hadn't done that, this recipe would have been a huge disappointment... for my taste anyway. Next time, I will also double up on the mushrooms as others did because I love them. 
It's an easy recipe, so I will try it again with the above changes, and I may try adding some fresh or dried thyme as well.

I've made this about 10 times now. I double the flour to thicken it a little more. make sure you cut your meat into really little pieces to make sure they are tender. it takes a long time to cook the onions and mushrooms down, like 10 minutes or so. Just be patient.
Bon apetit!

It was very good and my husband loved it. Great comfort food. Made it by the recipe, using sour cream instead of Creme Fraiche as he notes in the comments. Only comment I have is that his photo couldn't possibly be the dish after the Creme is incorporated! With the Creme it looks like your standard Stroganoff. His photo looks very braised. I had wanted to try his version of the stroganoff recipe just because of how different and delicious it looked!

This dish was exceptional.  It had a great flavor.  The meat was tender but not mushy.  I used Chef John's Creme Fraiche in it, which made it perfect.

Very good! I used sour cream and omitted the mushrooms as my family doesn't like but overall, they loved this recipe! My 1 1/2 year old loved the gravy and noodles! :)

After browning the meat and onions, I added the rest of the ingredients and cooked it in the crock pot which also helped to tenderize the meat.

Very nice dish! Made this as recipe says except I didn't have Creme Fraiche so I used Sour Cream. The sauce was a tad too thin for my family's liking and I think next time I will increase the amount of flour used. We used a London top round I had in the deep freezer and the meat was WONDERFUL! Very tender and juicy and not needing a knife to cut. I served it over egg noodles and it was a very filling meal all by itself. My family gave it an 8/10 :)

Usually make hamburger stroganoff, but prefer it made with strips cut from chuck roast. Just be sure to remove excess fat or any tough connecting tissue. I used 1/4 cup merlot rather than white wine (didn't have any) and sour cream rather than the creme fraiche. I used portobello mushrooms which I think have more taste and better texture than white mushrooms in a beef recipe like stroganoff. I did all the stovetop cooking in a cast iron dutch oven which I covered and placed in a 250 deg oven for about one hour, stirring once. Excellent flavor, tender strips of beef, and hearty mushrooms.

Made with beef stew meat and creme fraiche and absolutely recommend!  I have also made with sour cream and prefer creme fraiche but both times teenage kids and husband asked for more.  My only recommendation is to make more than you think you need :)

We thought this was very good and will definitely be made again.  The only thing I differently was add another tsp. of  flour as some of the reviews suggested.   
I will be adding 1  & 1/2 TBSP more next time as it was still not thick enough for our liking.  I am also going to delete the garlic and add a few dashes of worcestershire sauce.  Again, personal preference.

Thank you Chef John for another delicious recipe that did not disappoint.

Good recipe and easy to make but not a lot of flavor. It really needs something more than salt, pepper, garlic, wine, in my humble opinion. Whether that would mean using  some green peppercorns or some thyme or rosemary or marjoram to give it a bit of a goose would help make this dish really delicious.

My daughter asks for this on special occasions it's so good.

Just made it again. I changed mine up a bit. It was fantastic! I used beef tenderloin, 1 cup rich broth, and extra creme fraiche. I used a whole med onion and replaced the wine with brandy. Since I used tenderloin I didn't braise the meat.

I made this for dinner last night and OMG it was a home run. Boyfriend said it was fantastic and the best he ever had. I tweaked the recipe a bit for our taste buds ... used red wine,  put in a couple dashes of Worcestershire Sauce and 8 oz Creme Fraiche and 4 oz cream cheese Oh ... and a tablespoon corn starch to thicken. I used stew beef and it was amazingly tender. This recipe will definitely will be a keeper in  our home. Ty Chef John. I especially love your videos !!

Very easy to follow with awesome results. Very tasteful! I used rib-eye without the fat and it was super tender. It cooked for 40 minutes

Great recipe!! After reading it could be a little dry I added 1 1/2 cups of white wine instead of only 1/2 cup.  .. Which actually makes everything better.. I did thicken a little more with flour and water  The sauce was very rich and covered the noodles well. I will make it again !!!

The only changes I made was using sour cream instead of creme fraiche and stew meat instead of beef chuck roast...it was awesome. I used to make this using cream of mushroom soup...I will never do that again, this is now my recipe from hear on out.

Fantastic dish, followed the recipe to the letter, including making the creme fraiche a day ahead.  Served over egg noodles.  The entire family loved it and can't wait for the next time this hits the menu.

I had short ribs in the freezer so I used those in place of the chuck. Otherwise, I kept it exactly the same. It was amazing! My husband couldn't stop telling me how good it was. I'm going to add more mushrooms next time!

I only tried making this once and didn't really get to cook it long enough-also had to use sour cream instead of creme fraiche.  So maybe it's not completely fair to say it was just ok.  Plus I don't think I'm that big on Stroganoff anyway.  I may try again with proper time, more mushrooms, a slightly more diluted sauce and the creme.

Yummy!  I added a little cayenne and worcestershire sauce, with a little fresh thyme, otherwise made it exactly as written.  This was really satisfying.  I probably simmered it a little longer than 1 hour, just due to other activities going on.  It was perfect.

Very delicious. I used sour cream instead of making or buying creme fraiche and it was still amazing. I really really really like mushrooms, so I'll probably add more next time.

It was good. I rated it a 5, but it's a 4 because of my changes - made with stew meat, used beef broth, not beef stock (oops), and sour cream instead of creme fraiche (really wanted to find it in store and try it, but failed). I think if I was able to make as written, it would have been a 5.

Excellent! My picky 11 yr old and very picky 15 yr old both had seconds. Because of the lengthy braising time, it is important to use chuck. Will definitely put on my rotation.

I too substituted stew meat for the chuck roast and sour cream for the creme fraiche. The meat was melt in your mouth tender and the only issues I had is that the sauce didn't thicken enough but that was an easy fix. As written this was delicious but I added a generous sprinkle of Hungarian paprika and that put it over the top.

I used sour cream because my grocery store doesn't sell creame fresh. This was an awsome dish! My wife put it over semi crunchy steamed cauliflower for a lower calorie dish. Plenty of flavor!!! I am so making this a regular dish.

Cooked this as written after making the creme fraiche 3 days ago. Has a really great flavor. I halved the recipe as their are only two of us and put up half of that before adding the creme fraiche. I used part of a chuck roast we had left over and it wasn't a good cut or real fresh. I'll use fresh chuck roast next time.

This was an excellent recipe!  Thank you, chef John for passing it on.  Even my fussy husband liked it!  I found that the recipe, as listed, was enough for two large dinner servings with a lunch portion left over.  I made it exactly as listed with the exception of the amount of sour cream.  This is a very rich tasting dish and I'm not real crazy about sour cream in recipes.  I added only about 1/4 cup and it was a hit all around - for both myself and my husband!

I cut the recipe in half and used ribeye steaks.  The meat didn't really get tender enough but the flavor was outstanding in the gravy.  I did have to add a bit more beef stock to get a good amount to pour over our mashed potatoes.  I'd make this again, perhaps using the baking soda on the meat trick to make it more tender.

This was by far the best and simplest stroganoff recipe I have ever made with amazing results!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated and only added a sprinkle of worcestershire sauce to flavor the meat.  I will be making this again soon!

After just one bite of this I wanted to lick my plate clean. This is better than brownies. There's a reason it has an unbelievable 5 star average. MAKE IT. It is amazing. Thanks to the reviewer who explained how easy it is to make creme fraiche. I mixed 1 c. cream with 1Tb. buttermilk and left it on the counter for a day and a half and it turned out gorgeous. I have seen the light and will never go back to my lousy hamburger with sour cream and Worcestershire sauce recipe again. (FYI, I used stew meat and cooked it first in the pressure cooker for extremely tender meat.)

This recipe was awesome my grandaughter and all my family loved it. They said it's the best I have ever made. 
My grandaughter wants me to mske it every week and she asked me to double the receipe. 
Super good.  Better than the Betty Crocker I make all the time. And my husband is picky. He liked this one better. 
I will always use creme fraiche from now on  big difference.

This was wonderful.  We love Stroganoff and make it often, and this was the best recipe we've found.  I used fat free Greek yogurt in place of the creme fraiche.  Chef John's recipes are the best.  Many thanks for sharing.

So my husband and I hate mushrooms.  I'd like this to be a story of how we learned to love them, but instead I cooked according to directions and after the meat was done cooking, I changed the plan.  I poured everything into a colander and drained off all that wonderful liquid (that had the mushrooms in it), pulled out the hunks of meat and put the meat and liquid back into my dutch oven.  Then I proceeded with the sour cream and served it over buttered noodles for me and mashed potatoes for the hubby.  It was delicious!  So even if you don't like mushrooms, do not be afraid of this recipe!

This recipe was delicious!! I cut the recipe in half which was really silly of me, because I’m already craving for more. I was a little hesitant about make it, because the girlfriend is not a big fan of cooked mushrooms. I even had two thumbs-up from her which surprised me. Followed the recipe, it was somewhat time consuming but the trick is to be patient and let that liquid evaporate and let that meat and mushrooms brown nicely, it is totally worth it. I used stored bought crème fraîche. Next time I’ll take the time to make it. I’ll be cooking a full batch next time and then some, trust me. This one is a keeper. Thanks Chef John! :-)

I made this for dinner last night and it was fantastic.  even better the next day when I had some for lunch.  I did this in my pressure cooker which I cooked the for 30 minutes using stew meet, cut, which i cut into small cube.  I had never used creme fraiche, but don't skip.  I think this is what makes the meal!  Better than using sour cream.  I couldn't find it near the cheese or sour creams.  It was near the deli, where the imported cheeses were.  Thanks Chef Jon for a great recipe.

This came out fabulous! Cutting the chuck steak into strips was the hardest part. They browned up beautifully and the sauce was a nice dark rich brown. I used 3 TB flour and it was the perfect consistancy by the end. I tasted for seasoning and it didn't need any addition salt and pepper. I did season the meat quite generously before browning. It did however taste a bit sour so I added about a 1/2 ts. of sugar and that did the trick! The meat was so tender after cooking for about an hour and 15 minutes. No knife needed! My husband raved throughout the entire meal. Served on buttered parmesan egg noodles with cresent rolls on the side. A must try for anyone who loves stroganoff.

For anyone reading this who is fairly new in the kitchen-- don't think you can get away with cutting the cooking time down just because your sauce has thickened. Cuts of meat like chuck roast have to be cooked low and slow and for quite a long time to melt the collagen in the meat. If the collagen doesn't melt, you will left with extremely tough meat and wonder what happened and then give this recipe a low rating. It took me years to discover this fact about meat. 
Because I was short on time, I made the kid-friendly, faster version: ground beef and diced mushrooms (to camouflage the mushrooms to look like the ground beef) with sour cream and egg noodles stirred in. Using ground beef was nice because it cut my cooking time down by 75%. Both of my girls (2 & 5) gobbled this up and my picky 5-year old was oblivious to the mushrooms. BTW-- I discovered a good way to dice the mushrooms: I used my egg slicer and just turned the mushroom once after the first slice then turned the mushroom on it's side to cut the length. Big time saver and worked great!  Thank you, Chef John, for another amazing recipe! I plan to make the written, grown-up version for my next dinner party. :D

I used stew meat (the good stuff was too expensive), and sour cream. Otherwise made this exactly as directed. It was delicious. On the second try, when I sliced up the stew meat into smaller little strips, it came out much more tender. 
Served over buttered whole wheat egg-noodles.

This recipe is the best I have tried for beef stroganoff, with very minor adjustment. I used beef tenderloin, which cut down on the cooking time; I used heavy cream plus vinegar to substitute for the creme fraiche; I used corn starch to thicken the gravy a bit.  Otherwise I used the recipe as directed, serving it over egg noodles.This is an excellent recipe for beef stroganoff.

LOVE IT! I used 5lbs of meat, sherry instead of white wine, cream cheese & sour cream instead of creme fraiche (didn't have the ingredients on hand) but will definitely use next time! Prepared all ingredients (amounts adjusted for 5lbs of meat) as directed up until step 5. I put all of the prepped ingredients into my crockpot since I wouldn't be home all day (set it on low for 8hrs). Less than 8 hours it was done. As I was boiling water for EXTRA wide Polish Egg Noodles, I added 8oz MORE of sautéed sliced fresh mushroom (because we LOVE) and then added 8oz of cream cheese in cubes slowly, mixed well, then added another (approx. 4oz) of sour cream, then chives. OMG, out of the park delicious! My family from ages 9 to 55 LOVED this version of Beef Stroganoff (and I have made another version for years). I will definitely make it with the (home made  creme fraiche) as listed when I have more time to prepare! LOVE LOVE Chef John and ALL of your recipes.  DELISH! My Family and I THANK YOU!!!

Yum! I'm so glad I followed this recipe instead of one using canned soup, onion soup mix, etc. This turned out delicious and is perfect for the fall/winter time. Like other reviewers, I used stew meat. I chopped it up into smaller pieces since they were quite large. Next time, I'd cut them up even smaller. The white wine is a MUST for flavor and serving it over buttered egg noodles really brings the whole dish together.

I use the end cuts of a tenderloin (frequently available and less expensive than the filet steaks) and sour cream for this recipe. Just plain succulent!)

This was a really good lighter version of stroganoff!  I made 2 small changes.  First I used equal amounts of wine and beef stock (because I like the wine flavor more than stock) and I added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce to brighten up the flavor a little bit.

If you want some more vegetables to make it even healthier, you could also add some chopped asparagus or frozen peas.

I served this over some buttered parsley noodles and it was delicious!!!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and served over egg noodles.  I loved it!  Just keep in mind that it is nothing like the hamburger helper stroganoff you might be use to but it is super yummy.

We definitely love this stroganoff.  I have used both the chuck roast and other cuts; it turns out great.  I added extra broth instead of the wine, and used about a half cup of sour cream in place of the creme fraiche.  Delicious!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous!  Don't forget to make your creme fraiche 2 days before you prepare this dish.  The creme fraiche is so easy to make and really tops the dish. I'd give this recipe 100 stars if I could..

This was excellent. My family loved it. I added more mushrooms and had left over gravy and mushrooms which my husband put on mashed potatoes. Will definitely make it again.

I made this according to the recipe and it was fantastic! Everyone loved it and had seconds. I've read a lot of reviews regarding sour cream vs creme fraiche and having tasted both I can see why he chose creme fraiche. It has a milder taste and adds a nice subtle touch to the dish. We've already added this to our recipe box and will be making it again soon.

Loved this recipe.  Does need heavy seasoning - even though I seasoned meat extremely well, it still needed additional seasoning at the end.  I made a couple of days before so flavors could blend in refrigerator and added creme fraiche before serving - used less creme  fraiche than recipe called for;  definitely recommend this one!

We enjoyed this recipe very much.  I did not use mushrooms as some of the kids do not like them.  We also used red wine (homemade) in place of the white. We added some frozen parsley, rosemary and thyme from our garden along with a few tablespoons of tomato paste. Beef broth was also homemade. We subbed the creme fraiche with fat free mayo as there are lactose/soy restrictions.  Served over homemade noodles.  Tasty recipe that did not disappoint.

I didn't change a thing. I adjusted salt, pepper, and creme fraiche to taste, as instructed.  This was the most amazing Stroganoff recipe I have ever tasted.  Next up- Chef John's Swedish Meatballs!

Tried it last night - made it for my boyfriend who loves mushrooms. I followed the ingredients exactly, except for the sour cream for creme fraiche. I had 2 hours before I needed to eat and had to run an errand, so I after I cooked the veggies and the sauce had simmered and thickened, I poured it and the meat into my slow cooker and cooked it on high for the 2 hours - turned out great! Next time - I'd like more sauce - so I'll probably add more liquid (beef broth, wine), and the bf likes more sour cream in the sauce. Besides what I did due to time, it is a really good recipe, and one that doesn't need to be tweaked which is awesome!

Just made this tonight.   My husband and son both loved it and went back for seconds!   I added some hot paprika along with the second half of the beef broth to add some "kick" and subbed sour cream for the creme fraiche since that's what I had on hand.  It worked out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good - I will spice it up a bit next time - but couldn't believe how tender the meat ended up!  I did use a bit more white wine than called for - so perhaps the sauce was a bit thinner...but just a lovely treatment for less than tender cuts!

I used beef stew meat that was in my fridge and sour cream instead. Next time if I use beef stew meat again, I will simmer the meat a little longer than 1 hour.  Overall, the beef stragnoff turned very nice better than I expected. I served it with mesh potatoes it was absolutely lovely.  Thank you  Chef John for the recipe. MiMiD

This was fantastic and easy.I used stew meat and did let it simmer an extra hour since I had an appointment. It was so tender and the flavor was wonderful. I imagine the flavor will vary with the wine you use.  I made the creme fraiche as Chef John suggested.  That was a new undertaking that went well too. I am so excited.  My husband felt it was the best dish I have made it a while. I will make this again!  Kathy

Wonderful...yet I object to those who do not use creme fraiche. It matters...as does using a nice white as opposed to a red wine. I so dig this recipe. The only alterations I made was a bit of fresh dill along with the chives, and a tad more white wine. Peace!

This is SO delicious! I couldn't wait for the next day so I could have leftovers which heat up great! I used Greek plain yogurt in place of the creme fraiche. Meat was super tender & mushrooms are so flavorful! Great, homey dish!
