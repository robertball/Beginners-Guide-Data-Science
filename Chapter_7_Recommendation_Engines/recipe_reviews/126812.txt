Tasted great.  Ground it multiple times getting it finer and finer each time.  Also, packed in 3" diameter casings.  I'd back off the brown sugar just alittle.

This is great beginner recipe.  This was my first bologna and it turned out great.  Cooked on a Masterbuilt electric smoker.  Hung for 2 hours at room temp first.  Cooked adding smoke only a few times and maintaining about a 40* delta T through the cook and pulled to ice bath at 157* internal temp.  More details and cook log on the Venison Group on Facebook.  Took 10 hours to cook slowly.  I used the calculator to make a 4# batch. (smaller)
