I used margarine instead of ghee, and onions instead of shallots, and it was still delicious!  I will definitely make this again!

Very good.  I had the soft cheese with onion and chive so did not add shallot.  Because my cheese was soft to begin with, I used less.  Next time I will use more.  It was really good; just finished eating!

Tried this tonight (I love breakfast for dinner!), as I had some cream cheese to use up, and I am impressed!  I didn't use curry (allergic), and added a tiny bit of ham which I needed to use up as well, and it was all very satisfying!

Delicious! All I did differently was add a sliced green onion; I might also try a little cilantro next time. I had seen other cream cheese scrambled egg recipes (which called for 1 oz. cream cheese per 2 eggs, instead of 1 oz. per 1 eggs as in this recipe) and worried that this recipe had too much, but it was perfect! People that prefer their scrambled eggs very dry and stiff might find this recipe calls for too much cream cheese, but what do they know?!!

This was absolutely wonderful, but I gave this only one star.  It's so packed with cholesterol, calories, salt and fats, that on a regular basis this tasty dish will kill you.  Beware

I was a little afraid of cream cheese in scrambled eggs, but I really liked the final product.  The eggs had just enough curry flavor and overall were very good.  I served them with herb twists.

Very nice eggs.  Bf didn't even know there was mustard in them and he liked them.  I don't have shallots--another thing bf doesn't like--so I subbed garlic.  Worked well.    I served with sausage and toast.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it! Didn't add the cream cheese due to dieting and used purple onion instead of shallots! Very filing, high in protein and low in carbs!!

My hubbie loves curry, so I had to try this. I ended up baking the eggs instead of using the stove top. It took about 30 to 40 minutes to finish cooking, but it was worth it. It's almost a "curry quiche" in that form and it's our new favorite way to have eggs.
