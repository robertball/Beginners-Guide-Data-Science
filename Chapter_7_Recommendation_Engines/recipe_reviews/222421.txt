I absolutely loved this recipe! The strawberries turned out perfectly and the flavor was fantastic. The tequila is not overwhelming and the lime complements the strawberries and the sweetness perfectly. I topped these with fresh whipped cream. I will be making these over and over again!

In a word...Amazing! These turned out perfect. I made them for a cookout over the weekend and actually had to make a second batch because my friends and family gobbled up the first bowl I made so quickly. I had angel food cake, sponge cake dessert cups, and Cool Whip to make Strawberry Shortcakes with these strawberries. These were not too tart or sweet, the balance was perfect. I also used good tequila for the recipe, so the flavor was mild and smooth. I'm making these again for the 4th of July cookout we are having, but I think that I will triple the recipe, since we didn't have leftovers this time around.

I made this for a party with friends and everyone went crazy for it! It's strawberry season and I had a flat from the farmer's market, so I actually doubled this recipe. I served it with pound cake and fresh whipped cream, but honestly I could just eat a bowl of these strawberries. You definitely want to let them sit for at least an hour and stir then at least every ten minutes because this is what creates the yummy juice that makes a great sauce when poured over cake. The cake soaked it up so it had the flavor of the strawberries too. I am going to make this again and again, while it's still strawberry season!

This is my new favorite summer dessert! Definitely use good tequila like another reviewer suggested and stir often to create a yummy juice/glaze over all the strawberries. I'm going to make these again for the 4th of July for the red layer in a red, white, and blue trifle (layers of cut up pound cake, whipped cream, blueberries, and these strawberries.)

OMG!!! These were awesome! Made to add to a shortcake, they almost never got there - we kept picking at them. Do not make too far in advance, or you might not have enough left for the cake either!

SO. GOOD.  Took everyone's advice and set a timer to stir it every 10 minutes while I made shortcakes and it turned out amazing!  Topped the "Scrumptious Strawberry Shortcake" recipes from AR with these babies, added a dollop of whipped cream, and nommed on it with a gigantic smile on my face.  mmm...can't wait to pop a few of these into my limeade, too!  So many ways to enjoy this recipe!

Made this as dessert for a girl gathering featuring Mexiican food.  What a hit this was - recipe requests etc.  I doubled the quantities and followed the 'dressing' directions exactly, but used a mix of fresh pineapple, strawberries and blueberries. Served with assortment of Mexican bakery cookies.  Really pretty and the taste was fantastic - 8 people, no leftovers.  Will definitely make it again - brightened up a winter's day.

This was fabulous! The flavors blend together perfectly.  We had it on it's own and also served strawberry shortcake style with whipping cream and shortcakes. Make sure you pour the juice over top. Pure perfection! Yum!

These were fantastic. I used grenadine instead of triple-sec. These were a huge hit! Everyone loved them.

Made these as a late night boozy snack for me and my girlfriend. I halved the recipe since I only had 1 lb of strawberries, and these were DELICIOUS!! Ate them straight out of the bowl. We will be making these often. Make sure to stir frequently so you get that delicious juice!

I took these strawberries to an allrecipes get together and served them with Easter Lemon Bread from this site and they were a huge hit! I  doubled the recipe but otherwise made no other changes.  This is going in the keeper file! Thanks for sharing your recipe,  brandilynn7!

This is easy, delicious, and addicting. I made the whole batch, but since it was just my husband and me, I only used half on the strawberries and refrigerated half in a jar for later! Cannot say enough about the complementing flavors! I served it over pound cake on Mother's Day but it is just as good solo.

They are just amazing! But make sure you use a decent tequila, don't use bottom shelf or they will turn out less than stellar.
