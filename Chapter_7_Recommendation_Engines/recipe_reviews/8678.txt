Love this recipe BUT if you follow this recipe exactly as it is written, it may be bland for some.  What I did, prior to adding to the cornstarch mixture is, I seasoned it with more of the curry, cumin, parika and added a bit of red pepper to heat it up.  What I love so much about this recipe is that it allows room to play with the seasonings.  Some people don't want all the heat and spice and prefer the recipe as is so it's perfect.  Others have a great base to work with and can play around with the flavor quite a bit.  This is a versatile, easy and delicious meal for anyone, all you need to do is dip your spoon in, take a little taste and add whatever else you might need to make it perfect for you!

This recipe sounded nice, but the method didn't seem correct to me (and how anyone could find it too hot/spicy with just one tsp curry powder for 8 people astounds me !).

To release flavor, spices need to be fried for a couple of minutes, so when onion/garlic were soft I added spices and fried for 2 minutes before adding remaining ingredients.

I only made this for 2 people, but still used recommended amount of spices, but 1 Tbs soy-sauce (for 8 I would at least triple the spices).

By using coconut cream instead of milk (140ml can for 2 people) there was no need to add water/cornstarch.

Will do again, but use more spice - may also be good using cashews instead of pine-nuts.

This recipe was delicious!!!  I've tried several recipes from Allrecipes but never felt compelled to write a review before.  This was a very simple dish with easy to get ingredients and tasted great. Very creamy with a wonderful blend of spices.  I added about a 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes for a little heat.  Will definitely add this to my list of favorite dishes!

After reading reviews,I added 1/4 tsp. of ground cayenne and 1/2 tsp more curry, 1/2 tsp onion powder,a few sliced fresh mushrooms, cut the onion into thick slivers instead of chopping, used low sodium soy, added 1 tsp. chicken boullion and used 1/4 cup chicken broth instead of the water. I omitted the cornstarch as I don't need the extra carbs or care if it was thickened (that would also make it bland-er). Also, added brocolli tops the last few minutes for a quick low-carb meal. It was VERY GOOD. Fried rice would of been wonderful with some of the sauce but we are eating only the healthier carbs. Will definitely make again with the changes and will add more vegetables (matchstick carrots, bok- choy, snow peas etc.) when we are using more carbs. Thank you William, my Thai restaurant's not going to see me or my $ as often (when I can make this quick and easy at home)!

Very good!  I like that is wasn't hot or too spicy, and it still had a lot of flavor.  I loved the pine nuts.  I used a red onion and light coconut milk and cut 2 chicken breasts in half instead of bite-sized pieces.  I found it thick enough without the cornstarch; I just let it simmer a few extra minutes while I waited for everything else to cook.  Served with brown rice and steamed fresh asparagus.

I never do this.  What is that you ask?  I never change a recipe until I've made it at least once.  BUT, after realizing once I started that I didn't have all the ingrediants I needed (cornstarch, curry (I KNOW!) and cumin) I tried red curry.  After I read what was actually in this red curry blend (coriander, cumin, chili pepper, red pepper and cardomom) at least the McCormicks brand, I thought I might be ok.  The cornstarch would have added a nice thickening to it, but I was ok, I just added about 1/4 cup whipping cream.  Let me tell you ... this was DELISH!  AND, my husband, who doesn't like coconut was ready to gobble this dish up.  Please make sure to read what other reviewers have to say, there were a lot of helpful tips, more then most reviews that I've read in other recipes.  Thank you William for a new family favorite.

This recipe was awesome.  Even my husand who doesn't like coconut loved it!  It was very great!  We used low fat coconut milk and omitted the nuts to make it low fat.

Very, very delicious. I omitted the onions (because I hate them), and the pine nuts (because I didn't have any). I bet it would have tasted even better with the nuts. I did wish it were a bit sweeter, but I loved it. Easy to cook, and fast. Maybe next time I'll try adding reall coconut. Hmmmmmm. I wonder what that would taste like...

I swapped cashews for the pine nuts, doubled the curry powder, and added diced red pepper and a generous amount of fresh basil leaves with the garlic and onion so that it mimicked my favourite thai dish.  So satisfying served over fluffy brown rice!  This recipe is gladly added to our family's dinner rotation :)  Thank you!!!

This dish is pretty bland as others have noted, but it does have potential.  My hubby and I like a lot more flavor so I ended up adding 2-3 times the amount of spices and a whole lot more curry powder to get it to where we liked.

So good!  I made it for my roomates for Sunday dinner and everyone loved the blend of flavors - the curry and pine nuts complement each other.  And can I say, coconut milk!  Amazing flavor.  After the sauce was combined I tossed the chicken back in the pan and let it boil down with it, till it was thick enough, and didn't add the cornstarch.  Wonderful!  Next time I want to make an almond bread to go with it.

This chicken was delicious!! The buttery nutty taste blended well with the spices. I love spicy food so I used extra hot thai curry paste instead, and replaced half of the coconut milk with low fat milk (because coconut milk has so much fat and cholesterol in it), and used crushed corriander sead instead of cumin since I didn't have any. I misread the recipe and didn't slice up the chicken breasts, but it turned out great otherwise :D!!

Like majority of reviewers, this was far too mild for me.  So added more of the spices (took lots of taste tests) and also threw in a granny smith apple cut into chunks along with a heaping handful or so of raisins.  YUM!

I haven't even sat down at the table to eat this yet. Although, I have taken 3 bites straight out of the pan. Yum! I had coconut milk and curry paste when I did an ingredient search here on allrecipes. I did not have some of the other ingredients, but I improvised. I used red curry paste in the sauce instead of the powder and added water chestnuts for crunch at the end. This is a keeper!

FABULOUS!  If I could give this 10 stars, I would!  I made it EXACTLY as written and it's perfect.  The only change possibly needed is to the curry for "heat".  Perfect for serving to my 8yo son, as is....would up the amount of curry if it was for just my husband and I.  Can't go wrong with this one!!!!  YUMMY!!  Thanks Mr. Anatooskin!

This dish was FANTASTIC! Both my husband and I loved it. I made the dish exactly according to the recipe and served it over steamed rice! My husband could not stop talking about how good it was. He asked that I make it every Monday. The leftovers were just as good a couple of days later. Pine nut are kind of expensive at my grocery store... I'll have to shop around.

I was enticed by the description that showed up in my search results, but when I clicked on the recipe, the description said "a delightful recipe with a touch of curry..." which made the recipe sound boring so I am not gonna try it. Too many people change their descriptions once they get published and they change it for the worse. Leave it the way it was, that was why you were flagged for test kitchen review. I cant make my voice heard without rating the dish, so I will give it a neutral 3 stars.

Well, here it is 2011 and I printed this recipe off in 2005. I finally made it and it is outstanding! 

I was only using 4 chicken thighs which I cut into bite size.  So I reduced everything by at least half. The curry powder was my own mix, so maybe that is why I found it just fine and not so mild as others mention. I might add a wee tad more curry next time... but I thought it was perfect as is.  I also used a whole onion.  I did not thicken the gravy but I might if serving to guests, I just didn't think it needed to be. I used a premium grade baking coconut milk, again thou, only half.
Slightly worried the thighs wouldn't be tender - wrong, they were wonderful.
William Anatooskin, THANK YOU so much, I'm sorry I took so long in trying this recipe.

Excellent!  One of my favourite dishes.  Works well with pork tenderloin too.  I'm not crazy about pine nuts so I don't use - and the dish is still fantabulous!

What everyone needs to remember when making a recipe like this is that CURRY POWDER IS A VERY GENERIC TERM.  Your recipe will vary GREATLY depending on the 'curry powder' you use.  Some blends are sweet and incredibly mild while a teaspoon of another variety will blow your face off.  My advice is to MAKE YOUR OWN BLEND.    Regardless, I used a hot madras style curry blend of my own creation and threw a few curry leaves in with this chicken.  I toasted the cumin before adding.  I don't recommend toasting paprika as it burns very easily.  Speaking of, paprika varies widely and wildly as well as it can be a blend of ground bell pepper or chili pepper.  This will also greatly affect the flavor of a recipe like this one.

Enjoyed this very much added more curry a little red pepper. I seasoned the chicken while I cooked it and had it over rice with cilantro to top it off. Will be cooking it again.

Thank you thank you thank you!!  This was fantastic.  Reminded me a lot of a chicken korma.  I did change this recipe quite a bit to suit my tastes but I'm still giving 5 stars because the end result was wonderful.  Do watch those pine nuts carefully while toasting; those suckers love to burn without warning.  One reviewer suggested adding shredded coconut and I think this would be a great addition which I'll try next time I make this (soon!) I may also try subbing half the milk with coconut cream for extra decadence.  I did think it lacked sweetness so I added a little white sugar but coconut should solve that problem.  I also upped the spices, half of which I added to the chicken and onion while it was frying, then half later to the sauce. I also added sauteed mushrooms and thought that they matched perfectly.  Rather than "blandatize" the dish by adding cornstarch I just let it simmer longer and it thickened on its own, as well as tenderizing the chicken.  Thanks to the OP and to all the great suggestions- I LOVED this.

My family loves this - I've made it twice and it will be a regular.  I think I'll increase the spices next time and maybe put a bit of red pepper for a little kick (not a lot).  I take the leftovers to work and my co-workers drool over the smell!

Easy to make and great for freezing the leftovers. I've made this several times and with no variations from the way its written. Definitely a recipe 'm keeping.

I enjoyed this.  I doubled the curry (because it was mild) and put it and the cumin in when the onions were added.  I did not add the cornstarch but reduced the sauce instead as someone else suggested.  Regretably I did not have the pine nuts to finish it off as I'm sure they would have been good with it.

Needs something extra. It would be better if it was sweeter with more of a spicy kick.

I gave this a four-star rating, only because I made modifications that made it really very good.  Based on other people's reviews,,and knowing that my husband and I like food with a lot of "zip", I did the following:  added a dash of red pepper flakes, chilli paste, and a dash of more soy sauce.  I did that after I followed the recipe, tasted the broth, and found it kind of bland.  I also omitted the cornstarch step, and instead, let the broth boil down for at least 20 minutes or so, mainly because my daughter was late coming home for dinner!  But I think this helped the ingredients blend more, and therefore, was quite tasty!  I will make this again for sure.  Thanks!

YUMMY!  I couldn't stop licking the spoon I used to stir.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, and added some extra soy sauce, and in the future will add chili flakes, but all-around my first attempt at Indian-style cooking was a big success, thanks to this recipe.  Again - yum!

This was so easy and delish. I loved it. Was very rich, thought I wanted a second helping, but this was so filling couldn't do it. I also didn't have the pine nuts on hand. Don't worry, wasn't missing it. I also didn't see the need to thicken this, and I added about a pinch of red pepper flakes. Will definately make this again.

This was very ok; I was disappointed, after having read the great reviews. Too many flavors were going on here, so that it ended up tasting like a lot of nothing. The coconut flavor was lost; the toasted pine nuts weren't distinct, either. I won't do this again. My husband thought it was "good", then got up from the table and got the Triple Sec! He said the dish needed "something", so he added a splash of Triple Sec. It helped! Since this is such a combination of flavors that ended up causing a bland dish, if I were to make this again I'd replace the toasted pine nuts with toasted coconut that I'd add toward the end; I'd lose the onions, too.

This was a great recipe!  My boyfriend is not a big 
fan of coconut milk, so I was a little nervous when
I made this for him.  But he loved it and he even
took the leftovers for lunch.  It tasted very much 
like the Thai curry dishes.  The one thing I did was
cut the amount of coconut milk in half to reduce the 
fat.  I think the flavor was still great without 
the extra coconut milk.  So easy to make too!

I did need to add more spices to this; increased them by about 50%.  Skipped the cornstarch/cold water step at the end, because I wanted more sauce for dipping our naan bread in.  Included some green onion I had in the fridge, just to use it up.  Added some chili paste for more kick.  And I used slivered almonds (toasted) instead of pine nuts, which was just as good as the first time I made it with pine nuts. This will remain a repeat recipe for sure!

I could hardly finish eating this utterly fantastic dish to rate it.  My daughter and grandson ate with me and gave it thumbs up and asked for the recipe.  I have a lot of leftovers and I'm sure it will be just as wonderful as before.  And it was amazingly easy to prepare.

This chicken dish is pretty tasty and fast for a busy week night meal.The only thing i did different from the recipe was add 1/2 cup green curry sauce since that is what I had leftover from another curry recipe and wanted to use it up and omitted the cumin for lack of it.It worked great in this recipe.Served with some garlic-chili jasmine rice with peas and some orange cauliflower with  cheese sauce.

I have made this recipe a few times now following it to a tee and it has always turns out wonderful. I think the spice is just the right amount.  And tastes like a meal you would get at an upscale restaurant.   Thank you William for your delicious recipe that is permanently in my dinner rotation. =)

My husband loved this, but I wasn't terribly fussy on it. It seemed a bit more saucy than I would have liked, a tad runny. The taste was lovely, though, if not for the texture. The next time I make this, I will likely reduce the amount of butter. I will follow the photos rather than the recipe and not cube the chicken - I'm hoping that this makes a bigger difference. I served this with cous cous. Good for soaking up the excess sauce, but it wouldn't be my first choice the next time. Otherwise, I liked this and would make it again.

What can I say I have made this 3 times and never get a complaint out of anyone. My mom doesn't like real spicy food so I put some on the side for her, as for the rest of us we love the heat. You can't go wrong with this dish.

This was OK. I used light coconut milk, and followed the rest as written but it seemed to missing something. It definitely had potentially so perhaps I'll follow some of the other reviewers in adding additional spices. I'll make again to see how it turns out. Perhaps marinading ahead in some of the spices would help?

I've just finished enjoying this dish, and it's going into my recipe box.  I made a few alterations.  I added 2 heaping tsp of curry powder, doubled the cumin & cayenne, and added freshly chopped cilantro at the end - I also omitted the cornstarch/water mixture; it thickens up nicely on its own.

As written this recipe gets just an ok. It is really lacking in flavor. I ended up having to add about six times the amount of curry and even then my husband said it tasted like it needed something, and it did. Next time I make it, I'm going to add some ginger to it, and maybe a tsp. of sugar or brown sugar. I'll add some cayenne pepper to it, too. It needs more zip. It did remind of the chicken Satay that one gets at Thai restaurants. With my addition tonight of more curry, it was good, it just needed a little boost to what I had already done. About curry powder: look at the ingredients on the curry powder bottle. For our tastes, we prefer one that doesn't list cumin as the first ingredient. McCormicks makes an excellent brand that we like. If you enjoy alot of cumin, then get one with that listed first. It will really make a difference to your enjoyment of curry dishes if you purchase one with the ingredients you like.

It was great! But I significantly reduced the amount of cream. I only used about 7-8 oz of cream and it was even a little much there. I think with a little less cream and perphaps some water if necessary, this recipe would be amazing!

Had a good flavor.  I felt something was missing, though I'm not sure what.  I took advice from others and added more spice and did not use the cornstach.  Instead I put the chunks of chicken in sauce and simmered it until it thickened.  This way the chicken picked up some of the flavors as well.

Was looking for new ways w/chicken (as usual) and happened to have everything listed but the pine nuts. This was so good! Don't usually like curry but it doesn't have an overpowering taste in this dish. Thanks for sharing

Since I didn't catch the fact that it should be served with rice until I started cooking I had to quickly cook some rice as an accompaniment. We were really not happy with the recipe, but that could have been my fault. I rated the recipe a three because of this. I had halved the recipe so I came up with an extra half of a can of coconut milk. I didn't want to throw it away so I added it to the rice. Whether it was the extra addition to the rice or whether it was the basic recipe, we didn't loke this dish. It was extremely bland and while there was an under taste of flavor, even that seemed like it was missing something. I really wish we had liked this recipe, but I don't think we will be making it again. Sorry.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish!  (He ate two big plate-fulls of it.)  We love Indian food.  It reminds me of a dish I love at one of our local Indian Restaurants.  The only thing I would do different next time is add some heat to it and some cumin seeds.  I didn't have any rice, so we had it over noodles, (definitely not as good as basmati rice.)

After reading a ton of reviews, I decided to just taste as I cooked until I found the right amount of spices that my family would like.  I ended up using 2 tsp. of curry and 1 tsp of sweet paprika and 1/2 tsp. hot paprika.  I enjoyed the sauce the most.  Thanks

What an EXCELLENT dinner! My husband, my 14 year old son and his three friends (as well as myself) thought this was absolutely delicious! They all said this was a "keeper" and that I need to make it again soon! Thanks!

Delicious!  I doubled the curry powder based on other's suggestions.  We thought it was great.  I served it with basmati rice and a salad with basalmic dressing.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

This a great recipe, but it is was too bland for me.  If you are looking for a tasty recipe to experience the wonderful tastes of curry for the first time, this is a perfect one to get started on.  If you already love curry dishes, then you'll want to kick this one up several notches.  Some previous reviews mentioned doubling the spices--I will go 3 or maybe 4 times the curry next time.  This dish has great flavor, just not enough of it.

This is a very good recipe... I enjoy spicy coconut milk-based recipes.  For DH and me, I add more curry powder as we like it *spicy*!  To the reviewer who commented about subbing milk for the coconut milk: cow's milk has cholesterol, coconut milk does not.  Cholesterol is an animal product...no plant materials contain cholesterol.  Thanks, Mr. Anatooskin, for a great recipe!

This was such a delicious recipe.  I added some golden raisins and a little extra curry. After putting the cornstarch in, I let it simmer for a good 20 minutes.  It thickened up very nicely.  I served it in puff pastry shells and sprinkled some fresh shredded coconut on top.  My boyfriend and I both truly loved it!

This is one of my favorite dishes.  I love the texture of the pine nuts. Sometimes I use light coconut milk, it's not quite as rich and velvety, but still very tasty.

I was expecting a little more.  I probably will not make this again, but if I did, I would use more cumin and probably add some red pepper flakes to kick it up a little.  Maybe some sugar to pick up the coconut a bit?  I don't know-- neither my husband nor I *really* liked this one, but it was definitely edible.  I was looking for something closer to a Thai dish I've had.

This is a quick and delicious meal.  It is very mild.  As taste is subjective, unless you like everything hot and spicy, I recommend making it as the recipe states the first time.  Although my husband and I thought it was great we do prefer a stronger curry flavor and I will add more the next time I make it.

This dish was just delicious.  Superb!  I made the dish exactly as written.  I believe in order to truly rate and review a recipe you can't make your own substitutions.  Go ahead and substitute, make changes, but don't review the recipe.  I was intrigued by the description by some reviews of being bland. The ingredients dis not read as bland  This recipe was not bland!  The flavors are subtle and compliment each other, there is a big difference between bland and subtle.  We found the meal to be just pure taste satisfaction.  I look forward to preparing again...soon!

To make this dairy-free I used olive oil instead of the butter, did everything else the same as the recipe, but omitted the curry powder because my husband doesn't like curry. It was a total hit! We loved it, the flavours were great without being really curry-based, and we will definitely make it again. I will try to use coconut oil next time instead of the olive- a good alternative I think.

This was awesome!!! I did make several changes because of the ingredients I had around, to add flavor and to make it healthier. I only used 2 T of butter. I added 1 t of cumin (which I sauteed with the onions) and 3 t of curry powder to increase the flavor, as well as salt and pepper. I added zucchini, shredded carrots and 1 C of frozen peas to include veggies. I want to try it with mushrooms and maybe also broccoli. I used cashews instead of pine nuts.  Wow, thanks William!

Wonderful recipe, I used chicken thighs. Make sure you make rice or pasta to pour this wonderful sauce on top of. Soooooo good, and different from the main stream boring meals. I will be making this again only change I'm going to make is to add mushrooms and maybe frozen peas for added colour. LOVE IT!!

I find this recipe a bit bland, but very good as a base. Basically my boyfriend and I used this recipe as a base for what became a very tasty meal. We followed the recipe at first, tasted it & then added in some extra spices;  2 tsps of curry (instead of 1) 3 tsps of cumin (instead of 1) 1/4 tsp salt 1/4 tsp black pepper pinch of garlic salt  Also, we only used ONE pound of chicken (about 2 good sized chicken breasts)  I think if you follow the recipe as posted it would be way to bland for TWO pounds of chicken as you can see we added much more spices for only have the meat and it was delicious. Served with rice.  Will be making this again tonight, might add in some peanut butter!

Very tasty! Hubby and guest loved it and so did I! I made the recipe exactly as written except I had about half the chicken called for, which didn't really matter in the end. Also, I had no pine nuts, but I'm sure it would taste fabulous with them. After making the sauce as stated I added about 1/8 t (possibly less) cayenne pepper, just because I like things to have a little kick, and to balance out the sweetness of the coconut milk. Really good recipe.  Also, it makes a very attractive meal, especially with some green salad and/or other colorful veggies. Next time I think I'll try it with some red peppers or sliced carrots cooked in the sauce.

I made some changes. I used 2 tsp Thai red curry paste and 2 tsp Indian-style curry powder. Everything else I kept the same and served it over Jasmine rice.

MMM.....ok, I love spicy food, but I didn't find this spicy in the least and I still loved it! I followed the recipe, more or less.  I didn't have any cornstarch and wanted to make a separate sauce.  I used 1 TBS of butter to saute the garlic and onion, 1 TBS to cook the chicken, and 2 TBS to start the sauce (1/4 cup in total).  I made a roux using those 2 TBS of butter w/ 2 TBS of flour.  Then, I mixed in about 1 1/4 cups whipping cream and stirred.  I added the spices, but increased them as follows: ~2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp cumin and ~2 tsp curry. I stirred until to desired consistency. I taste tested and thought it was delicious, but added the sauteed garlic and onions.  I would skip on those next time, but the toasted pine nuts are a must! It made an eat-out-of-the-pan sauce!  Yummy!

This recipe was good.  We like a little more spice so i used a hotter curry powder but at the same quantity as the recipe called for.  Will use this recipe again.

Thank you, William, for a wonderful recipe.  I love spicy foods, but prepared this as written as my family is very sensitive to spices.  I didn't feel that it was bland at all - the flavors were very delicate and the chicken was tender and moist - delicious!  I substituted a small amount of red curry paste for the spices and it still turned out beautifully.

Very good, softly spiced dish.  I used chicken thighs, served with a rice pilaf and green beans.  Will make again.

Every one in my family loved this, served over rice.  The only change I made was to use dry roasted peanuts instead of pinenuts. Yummy!

This recipe is delicious. I made it tonight and served it with the Carrot Rice recipe from this site and it was a huge hit. I took the advice of many reviewers and doubled the curry (just the right heat), and just let it simmer until the sauce reduced (didn't add the cornstarch). Will definitely make this again!

Thought this was a fairly solid recipe.  I'd make it again, but not for company or a special occasion.  I omitted the onion as I was out and no pine nuts (allergies).  As well, I used whole chicken breasts as opposed to chunks.  I had to double the cornstach slurry amounts as my sauce wasn't thickening to my liking (otherwise it would have been quite runny).

This recipe was so/so - although I loved the idea of the rich gravy, it seemed to be missing a little something.  I'd suggest adding more spice, and maybe mangos to liven it up.  Don't think I'll make it again - I have too many other similar recipes with far better flavor.

This wasn't anything special. For one thing, it doesn't seem to be sure what type of dish it is--Indian? Thai? Chinese? It's a little of each, which I suppose isn't necessarily bad.
But I thought it was bland and my wife thought it was too spicy. The chicken did not turn out very well either ... why not simmer the chicken in the curry instead of sauteeing it? And why add cornstarch?

This was okay. It seemed like it was missing something to me. It reminded me of curry chicken but a little off. I think I'll stick with my regular curry chicken though.

Wonderful recipe.  I halved exactly for two of us with 1/3 leftover and used it with Maggi chicken flavor seashells (sauteed a little celery and onion).  Great soup!

This was so good! My family is very picky so I was a little afraid to try this, but my kids loved it. It is very mild but at the same time flavorfull. I didn't have any coconut milk so I just used regular milk and it turned out fine. I served it with the Indian Style Basmati Rice and it was a good match.

I have to give this a "3", which means it is good, not great, not outstanding.  I followed the recipe exactly and it had nice, subtle flavors, but was way too mild.  I will make this again and see if I can't nudge it to a "4" OR "5".

This was great, but I wouldn't use a whole can of coconut milk next time because it came out too sweet.  I also think increasing the soy sauce would help a little too.

This was sooo yummy! I omitted the pine nuts since I didn't have any. I also didn't have paprika so I used some ground red pepper and cinnamon instead.  It was really good and will be added to the dinner "rotation" at our house!

Very good recipe, but did a little tweaking.  The other reviewers were saying it was bland.  I cut the chicken up and coated it with paprika, cumin, curry, and some garlic powder, and put in a resealable bag and refrigerated for a while.  I didn't use any butter, just about 1 tsp. oil in non-stick pan.  I also added the spices when cooking the onions/garlic to release more taste.  The coconut milk was barely noticeable (I used Lite, don't know if that made a difference).  Probably could also use chicken broth.  Will make again, perhaps adding more veggies.

I just made this recipe last night - exactly as stated.  My husband absolutely loved it but I felt like it was a little too mild.  Definitely recommend taking some of the other suggestions (e.g. adding more curry or adding red pepper flakes).

I made it with cream, as Coconut milk is
 not one of the more common items available
 in Moscow.  Very nice all the same.

One comment about soy sauces, though.
 Turns out they are different.  Mine was
 almost sweet, which may have detracted
 from the overall result.  Still, it's a
 recipe I will use in the future.

Made as directed but used 1 tsp red curry paste instead of dry curry powder. It was delicious! Served it over cauliflower rice for a low carb meal. I'd probably add chili garlic sauce next time - I like my food spicy!

Outstanding.  This was very good.  Did everything as called for except used a little more curry. Not a USA curry, which can be bland on its own.  My curry is from the Indian Market in Durban South Africa.  I have various blends.  I didn't use the corn starch and water either which could have also had something to do with it being bland to some.  Simmering for a bit naturally thickens it.  Served over rice and it was perfect.  Great recipe and I'll make it often.

Excellent recipe! Made these changes to my taste

-Added some ground coriander (I never measure spices)
-About tripled the soy sauce
-About doubled (and a bit?) the paprika
-Salt and peppered the raw chicken
-Used yellow curry, as is my preference because my household doesn't like spicy food
-Added the spices in the pan at the same time as the garlic and onion to enhance flavour

DElicious!!

This was easy to make, but BLAND! And who would have thought with all the spices added that it could be bland? I may have messed up by using minced garlic like you buy on the spice aisle... does this make a difference? That garlic was all over in little chunks. Also, the color of this dish was strange- kind of between yellow and light green. I do have a good idea of how to vary the ingredients and make different dishes the same way now- with this easy recipe.

I thought this sounded yummy, but it didn't end up having much flavor.  Is it supposed to be served with something?  I put it over rice.

I thought this was a descent chicken dish. I did not care for the flavor of the curry, but I did like the creamy gravy.

This was an excellent dish and was enjoyed by all in our family.  I made a few modifications to suit our taste and what we had in the cupboard at the time).  I added extra minced garlic, a couple of dashes more of soy sauce, used 7 oz. coconut milk and 7 oz. low fat milk as well as added a couple of pinches of red pepper flakes.  I didn't have any cornstarch on hand, so I used a flour and water mixture to thicken--something that worked well for me in a pinch.  

This is something that we will definitely be fixing again!

Just ok but nothing great.  Maybe I was expecting too much beccause so many people gave it five stars.

We aren't big fans of "curry" based dishes, but I gave it a try.  It smelled GREAT and it tasted "good".  Glad we tried it, but probably won't make the regular rotation.

My entire family, ages 3-40, loved this recipe and it was very easy to make.  I've been experimenting with various ethnic inspired chicken dishes recently, and this one was by far everyone's favorite (except for mine; I would prefer a little more heat to the spice mix).  My family scarfed this down so fast that I'll have to double the recipe next time so we can have some leftovers for a couple of days.

My husband and I thought this was a really nice recipe.  We just tried this a couple of nights ago and he's requesting it again for next week.  I'm not one for handling much spice, overall, so this was on the hot side for me - but I'm a weenie...  Hubby LOVED it.  Followed the directions as is - with the exception that I used fresh coconut milk.

I probably won't make this recipe again.  At least, not in any form that would be recognisably the same.  I halved the amount of chicken and coconut milk, but kept everything else more-or-less the same, to get a more intense flavour in the sauce.  It smelt *incredible* whilst it was cooking, but...  just didn't taste of anything.  It was really weird!!  I did thicken it, and I wonder if I lost some flavour to the weird effects of cornstarch, but both my boyfriend and I found it 'nothing'.  The best I can say is that the first mouthful reminded me somewhat of Marks & Spencer Chicken Tikka Masala (which is awesome!!) - I think it's the mix of coconut and butter.  I'll try adding more soy sauce and some tomato paste to the leftovers to see if I can enhance the resemblance, but...

This was alright. I won't make it again as is; the chicken came out pretty dry (which is my own fault, but nevertheless...)  I had served this over white rice, and did think the sauce with the rice was very good. So I'm going to tweak it a little and hang onto the recipe as a curried rice side dish, leaving out the chicken. I thought the flavors went well together, it wasn't bland, or for that matter, too spicy, and the pine nuts were a pleasant addition. Definetly worthy of a little fiddling with.

I didn't have pine nuts.  I think they must really add to the dish.  My husband loved it.  I was expecting more flavor from the coconut milk and the curry.

I loved this recipe.  Though I agree it could have used more spices, particularly cayenne and curry.  As colorful as it was, I expected more flavor.  The pine nuts are a must.

Like many others said, kinda bland.  I added ALOT of extra spices including red pepper and coconut flakes.  My boyfriend liked it, I still think it needs something.

I doubled the spices, coating the chicken pieces
before cooking; also added cayenne pepper.  Flavor was good, but the kids didn't care for the
pine nuts and they were pretty expensive.
