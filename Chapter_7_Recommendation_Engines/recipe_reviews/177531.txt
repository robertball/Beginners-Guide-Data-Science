I've made this recipe for years. I don't put in the sour cream or the pepper, since I don't like pepper and I wanted to cut down on the fat content. I also don't put in the cheese for the same reason. It's very good without all that and everyone I've served it to has liked it.

I have been making this dish for over 15 years and it always gets rave reviews from friends and family.  Most like it even better then the usual green bean holiday casserole. It is definately a dish to try.  Enjoy!

I have a daughter that is a vegetarian, so I am always looking for side dishes that have more than a couple of ingredients, more heartier side dishes, she loves this one, as does the rest of my family.

I make this all the time, but I cannot have anything with mushrooms, so I use either cream of celery or chicken in place of that. I also, in the summer, add one other vegetable than called for, such as zucchini since I have a ton. Everyone that has this at my house wants me to make extra! I also vary the cheeses, sometimes mixing whatever shredded cheeses I have and it always works out well. No one in my family likes the green bean casserole, so this is a great alternative to that. For the ones who feel this is bland, play with spices to see what you like with this...a recipe is only a guide.

I first made this years ago and recently came across the recipe in my file box.  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit - even with the picky eaters in my family!

A nice change from green bean casserole.  I followed the directions other than using fresh vegetables that I steamed for 10 minutes and I may or may not have used the exact amount of cheese, I had some slices I needed to get rid of.  Personally I would like it a bit more cheesy so I may add more next time, and steam the veggies for less time (or not at all) b/c they were a bit too squishy!

This is one of my favorite vegetable casseroles. I changed it by adding a cup of sour cream instead of just 1/3 cups, and change the cheese from swiss to sharp cheddar. I also add frozen corn thawed.  I love cheese so I mix 1 1/2 cups of sharp cheddar into the casserole while it is baking and then top with the last 1/2 cup and remaining onions. Very good. If you want to make a whole meal out of this, you can add a can of mushrooms to the mixture, 1/4 cup of milk and then add 4 chicken breasts that you have cooked partially in the skillet and then place in a bottom of a 9X13 pan and cover with the vegetable casserole. The chicken stays moist and it is a nice combination of flavors.

I just made this tonight and it was good.  Not quite 5 stars, but my husband did go back for seconds, so I'll give it 4.  I went by the recipe and didn't change a thing.

Followed the recipe as written but used Monterey Jack cheese instead of Swiss because that is what I had on hand.  Loved the flavor but think I will either add a little more sour cream or maybe a little milk as it was not creamy enough for me.  I will make it again but will try it with a little changes.  This recipe is a keeper and I will be trying it again for Thanksgiving.

This recipe is just like seeing an old friend. I have been making this for about 20 years. It was passed on to me by a friend. I think it is one of the most requested recipes I make.  It is nice to know that even if I lost the card my recipe is safe here.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner this year as a side dish, and everyone at the table raved about it.  I used Cream of Celery instead of Mushroom, and I omitted the french fried onion rings, simply because we don't like them.  Instead, I sprinkled buttered bread crumbs over the top, and it was delicious!  I added 1/2 tsp. of onion powder and some marjoram, just to give it more flavor.  I will be making this dish again and again!

Absolutely love this!  I made the recipe as stated as a side dish for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a hit with everyone. For the next day or so I nibbled at the leftovers and even ate them cold. For some reason this dish really hit the spot with me. Thanks so much for a great idea. Much better than the standard green bean casserole!!

I am finding this recipe in the Low Sodium casserole recipes. Campbells soup is not LOW sodium. 
I also have concerns that the recipes I am finding have no values listed for sodium yet they are under the low sodium recipes.

I was so excited for this but it tasted sad and bland :(Like another reviewer said, don't make this as a main dish. My husband is a garbage disposal and he didn't even eat a full serving of this.

(Disclaimer:  I made this as an assignment as an AR All-Star.  However, I am the boss of me, so, rest assured, my opinions are my own.)  I was prepared to not really care for this...after all, it does have the word "casserole" in the title (I chose to refer to it as "Swiss Veggie Medley).  However, after going back for a THIRD serving, I realized I did, indeed, enjoy this.  Why, you ask, not 5 stars then?  While I enjoyed this, I will probably never make it again.  It's not something I'd serve guests, nor is it something I'd whip up for a quick weeknight side.  Even using the 98% fat free soup and fat free sour cream, it still packs way more calories than I prefer for a veggie side.

Made this a few weeks ago for step dads birthday. When I asked my mom what to bring for Easter he was in the back ground yelling "Bring the veggie casserole you made for me". So will be forever known as Al's Favorite.

This recipe was a big hit! I used 2/3 cup of sour cream and a lot more fried onions as well as cheese. But this was a huge hit and will definitely make again.

I liked this as an alternative to the basic green bean casserole dish @ Thanksgiving.  Easy, good flavors, simple ingredients.  I will make this again!

A family favourite. Might not make it as a main dish again but definitely a top notch side.

I was really looking forward to trying this recipe, but was disappointed with the taste. It was a little on the bland side.

I skipped the sour cream, used low sodium cream of broccoli soup instead, and it turned out great! Definitely keeping this recipe.

This is my go to holiday side dish or group gathering recipe. It replaces the more traditional green bean casserole for our family because I have a few folks that don't like green beans or mushrooms. So here are my changes and substitutions: 
I double the recipe, which fits nicely in a medium aluminum casserole dish. I put the veggies in frozen and cook the whole thing for an extra half hour (1 hour to cook and an extra 10 after you add the cheese and onion topping)
I substitute cream of celery soup for the cream of mushroom (I have mushroom haters in the family). 
I add a total of 1 1/2 cups cheese.

I made this tonight with frozen pea, carrot, green bean medley. I used cream of chicken soup as I had a bunch of it, and I added some garlic powder. Also I didn't have enough Swiss cheese so I added grated Parmesan. Very good and easy to fix recipe for something different. Will make again!

I have been making this for years, and it is always a hit with company.
In order to keep the calorie count down I use low fat sour cream, reduced fat swiss cheese, and Campbell's Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup.  It's delicious~

Great casserole. I have been using my own variation of this recipe since I found it 10 years ago. I use mixed shredded cheese instead of swiss but it's still a huge hit I make this twice a month and double on holidays instead of green bean  casserole

this was not good. I followed the recipe precisely and it did not turn out. I was able to make use of it by creaming it with a hand blender, adding some stock and making a soup.

Very easy and tastes fantastic.  I did slice up a pound of smoked sausage and made it a main dish.  The different ways to tweek this is exciting.

I made this with a few alterations: subbed cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom (all I had on hand, but you could probably use any "cream of" soup), shredded cheddar instead of swiss (again, it was already in the fridge), tossed in about a quarter of an onion chopped since we were a little short on the French-fried onions (fiance likes to snack on these, so it wasn't a full can), and put in a little chicken sausage (chopped).  Although I altered it a bit I feel it's fair to remove a star simply because the cooking time and temp didn't get the carrots cooked through.  My fiance liked them crunchy, but I wasn't a fan.  I think next time I will use just the broccoli/cauliflower mix.  I almost added stock or water because it was super thick and paste-like prior to baking, but I'm glad I stuck it out.  The veggies release plenty of moisture while cooking to make this a creamy, cheesy dish with just the right level of gooey.  Didn't even need the garlic I almost added, either!  Very good, just make sure you parboil or leave out the carrots unless you like them crunchy in your casserole... and adding sliced or diced sausage is a great way to make this a main dish.  Very yummy!

Delicious!!  I used this recipe for camping and used tin foil and cooked it over the campfire.  I plan on doing that again!!  My husband isn't a huge fan of eating vegetables... but this is a great side dish he really enjoyed!

This turned out pretty good, but I am sure it is not the healthiest.  I followed the directions exactly, but next time I think I will cut down on both the sour cream and swiss cheese, OR add another bag of veggies instead.  Though extremely tasty, it was a little too creamy for our tastes.

Like everyone else, I have had this recipe in my file box for several years!  It was requested by my daughter a couple weeks ago and now we find her daughter likes it, too!  I don't change a thing!  The recipe was on a label of mushroom soup, and I wish they would do it again...my recipe has seen better days!

I made the sauce, but did not have any broccoli. Instead I used cauliflower, carrots, zucchini, and celery. I diced the vegetables and steamed them just to ala dente. I folded them into the sauce which I had cooked on top of the stove until the cheese was melted. Some black pepper and the dish was done. This was simple and delicious. I will definitely make it again.

Always looking for a new spin on Mac-N-Cheese, so I added 1 cup cooked pasta and 12 ounces cooked broccoli. Then topped it off with 2 sliced Roma tomatoes and then the crushed onion rings. Oh-la-la!

This is super easy and very tasty.  I substituted yogurt for the sour cream because I had it on hand.  I could have doubled the recipe and still not have any left over.

It was pretty good.  I'll probably make it again.  That's a lot of calories, though, to get your kids to eat their vegetables; and I'm not sure if it's worth it.

I found this on the back of a Durkee Fried Onion container years ago and have been making it ever since!  It is more tasty than the green bean casserole.  For the person who says she leaves out the cheese & sour cream to cut out fat:  YOU ARE MISSING THE FLAVOR and changing it into an entirely different dish.  Just eat a little of it and enjoy!!!  And for those who are complaining about low sodium:  Campbell's has low sodium mushroom soup.  Use low sodium cheese.. or.. just eat a very moderate serving and don't worry about it!!!

This has very good flavor, but the vegetables from frozen or thawed are not done enough or hot enough.  I have made this 2 times and for a 3rd time will try lightly steaming the vegetables before mixing with the other ingredients and baking.  I want it hot and bubbly when it come out of the oven.

I had a bag of freezer burned vegetables that I didn't want to throw away. This recipe was a great way to use them.  My husband and I couldn't believe how tasty this dish was even with sub-optimal ingredients.

I make this only without the sour cream. I add a little milk to the soup to thin it a bit, extra swiss cheese and extra fried onions. Everyone always wants me to bring it to holiday gatherings.

I used 48oz of the California mix vegetables, a 26oz can of Cream of Mushroom soup (tried to get low sodium, but could not find it), and substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream.  I increased the amount of yogurt and cheese roughly in proportion to the extra soup and veggies.  Also, used a 6oz can of the French Fried Onions.  
The veggies weren't completely thawed, so I set the oven to 375, and cooked a maybe 10 minutes longer (sorry, I'm a bad scientist in the kitchen - I go with instinct a lot).
There wasn't much leftover, and what was left was taken home by other guests.  I was told it was in fact "a hit".
I'll do it again, and experiment with reducing the overall sodium and fat content, and maybe incorporating other vegetables.

I LOVE the flavor that the Swiss cheese brings to this recipe.  I wanted a veggie casserole for Thanksgiving rather than the old standard green beans or green bean casserole.  Since I already am a fan of broccoli and cauliflower, I knew that I would like this recipe.  It was one of my favorite dishes at Thanksgiving.  The onion rings added a nice flavor also.  I made this recipe directly by the directions and wouldn't change anything.

I've been making this recipe for years and always serve it as a side to Chicken Parisian Crepes that I make. I love the addition of the sour cream to make it richer. For those who do not like swiss cheese, I've made it with muenster, but swiss is my favorite. To make things cook more quickly (and avoid crunchy vegetables), I often pre-cook the veggies in the microwave with a little water to speed things up. This is always a hit!

I bought the Campbells caserole book years ago and have been making this recipe since. This is my daughters favorite dish. I add a little bit more cheese. I also turn it into an entire meal by adding chunks of chicken. My son is alergic to mushroom so I use cream of chicken but i'm sure any creamed soup wouldn't change the yummyness of this dish. I have made this at least once a month for the last 3 years and kids are still stalking the kitchen in anticipation.

This is GREAT! I am lazy so I used already grated Mexican flavor cheese instead of Swiss - which happened to be on sale, too. Everyone loved it - even those who don't normally eat vegetables !!!  I definitely will use again.

I used yogurt in place of sour cream, cheddar cheese, and topped it w/ fish. Then i baked as directed and served it over spaghetti to make a whole meal. It was a big hit and an awesome new way to serve fish.

I replaced the bream of mushroom soup with cream of chicken. I'm not sure if it made any difference, but it turned out pretty bland. It took a lot longer than 40 minutes to bake for the veggies to soften up. I ende up leaving it in the oven for an additional 40 minutes.

Everyone loved this casserole, even my two teenaged sons. I used light sour cream in this with good results. This is a great alternative to the same old green bean casserole that I've made for every holiday for years.
