This wasn't spectacular.  It was easy, which I liked.  After reading the reviews, I doctored it up by adding parsley and garlic powder to the ricotta mixture.  The dish didn't bake as stated.  When I took it out of the oven, it was still cold in the middle.  So I had to put it back in and it ended up taking over an hour to bake.  It was an easy weeknight dish that I am happy I tried, but probably will not make it again.

The flavor was OK, but I didn't like the texture of the ravioli after it was baked. Some of them were a little chewy, some were gummy and some were crunchy.

This was good, but it wasn't spectacular.  It could use a little tweaking - there needs to be something to zest it up a bit.  It tasted a little on the bland side, but it didn't keep me from clearing my plate.

After reading the reviews, I made slight modifications.  I used leftover pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce and thawed out the raviolis (I used italian sausage raviolis).  I added parsley/garlic salt, oregano and a combination of romano/parmesan cheese to the spinach mix and baked in the oven for about 45-55 minutes.  It came out fantastic!

this is good, but not great.  Hubby was not impressed, but my child gave it a thumbs up.  Would make again.

This is a good base recipe, but definitely needs improvement based on personal tastes. I used my regular lasagna recipe, simply replacing the lasagna noodles with a mixture of beef and cheese ravioli, and it was delish. Based on some of the other reviews, I defrosted my ravioli in some water before layering it, and I think this step helps to avoid the rubbery/chewy/undone issues some people were having. If you leave the ravioli frozen, you definitely want to add more spaghetti sauce, because the ravioli needs moisture to cook properly. Made as written, I think it would be fairly dry. All in all this was a good meal, but with the added steps to make it awesome, it really isn't any faster, cheaper, or simpler than making regular lasagna.

Using beef ravioli was a good choice. Baked at 400 for roughly an hour. 40 covered 20 uncovered. Added garlic, & shallots, delicious!

I added cooked Italian sausage and diced onion to the ricotta mix it was amazing. Make sure your ravioli is thawed and itâ€™s fantastic.

My wife thought that the ravioli was still hard. I wound up having to eat them in several settings. They were a little underdone but the leftovers were fine unfortunately she'll try something only once.

This quick prep slow cooking gem was astonishingly good for dinner; the leftovers kicked into flavor overdrive.  We will be making this a regular visitor to our table!

This was a big disappointment.  I pre-cooked the ravioli  thinking it would help with the not completely baking issue.  It was barely warm in the center.  This recipe has too much ricotta for our tastes.  I'm glad we tried it.

The ravioli lasagna that you described on this site was an amazing recipe, I made it at home as a surprise for my parents and the absolutely loved it and how it was a perfect mixture between ordinary ravioli and ordinary lasagna. Based on the reacts I got from when I first cautiously made it I'm excited to make it again and add my own personal touch to it! Thank you for sharing your amazing recipe!

I didn't care for the raviolis--tough and chewy. Maybe it would be better with fresh or precooked raviolis. However, it certainly was quick and easy.

This was fantastic! I modified it a bit used beef raviollis,  cottage cheese, italian cheese blend, shredded cheddar, greated parmesean, some parsley and onion salt (garlic salt woukd have been better). I did have to cook longer but i used more cheeses than what recipe called for..... But beyond that this was a great dish! !!!

This recipe was easy to put together & definitely had all the flavors of a lasagna with a lot less work. However, after baking this for 40 minutes at 375* as directed this dish was still cool in the center. I raised the temperature to 400* for an extra 15 minutes and the result was luke warm but very hot & bubbly around the edges. The ravioli's were rather chewy & pasty. It certainly was eatable & my family ate it but I don't think I will make it again. 
There is another recipe on this website I will try next time, Randy's Ravioli Lasagna in the Slow Cooker

the hubby & i enjoyed this recipe! I menu planned to make this last for 3 days between the two of us and we had enough for dinner, my lunch then dinner (only 2 days because it was sooooo yummy!). great way to mix things up! We use mozz cheese instead of ricotta since the frozen raviolis contain ricotta. We also sub parmesean for romano.

Pretty boring, missing some seasoning. I have tried a recipe that is close to this, but with beef, and it was much better.
