First, I wasn't sure why there was so much oil (equal to the vinegar?), but that is one thing that I cut back.  If I were to make again, I'd try it with no oil and replace it with more vinegar and water.  I tasted this after cooking was complete, and thought it was totally bland.  I added a little more vinegar, a little sugar, and mixed in a paste made of equal parts dry mustard and water which did elevate the flavor, but I still can't say that I would make this again.  I've eaten many types of German potato salad, actually have several recipes in rotation, and this one just didn't work well for us.  The rating is based on the additions I made, not the recipe as written.   dramath, sorry I can't give this a better review.

I liked it, but only after I doctored it a bit. More vinegar than oil. Added a good bit of Dijon mustard. Added bacon to the cooker and reserved some as a garnish. Five hours on low was barely enough... potatoes were a bit "al dente". And before serving, I mixed it in some yogurt to cut the acidity and add richness. Turned out pretty good. Guests really liked it!

My better half is from Germany.   This is about as close as one can get to REAL German potato salad.....potatoes are always sliced in Germany when you have their potato salad.

This recipe is a real hit with those who have eaten it.  Guten appetit.

We loved this but I did a lot of tweaking.  Per one suggestion, I used only 1/4 cup of oil.  Per another I mixed the bacon and also the parsley into the mixture.  German potato salad is supposed to be sweet and sour so I looked at other recipes and added 3 tablespoon of sugar.  Finally, I made a roux out of the bacon grease per another recipe with 1/3 cup of flour and some water and added it in.  It was great.

I made this for Christmas dinner.  I  omitted the onions ( my husband doesn't like them) added 6 oz of cream cheese and about 3 Tbsp dried ranch dip. What a creamy side dish!  Everyone loved it!  Cooked for 5 hours on low in crockpot.

It was yummy! Did change a bit though..  Left out the bell peppers and upped the vinegar to 3/4 of a cup and lowered the oil to 1/4 cup. Applied a liberal amount of salt and pepper and added the bacon and parsley at the beginning. I think next time I'll cook a little more bacon and top if off at the end for the crunch and will try with apple cider vinegar.

Five Stars because this recipe tastes just like how hot German potato salad should taste.  I only spent the time it took to cut veggies and potatoes... maybe fifteen minutes since I was multitasking.. :). I didn't why my potatoes so I don't think I have the correct amount, I probably had extra. That would explain why I needed to add a little bit of extra vinegar at the end.

Five stars with tweaking suggestions (mustard and red peppers) from other reviews. I add 2-3 tablespoons of bacon grease instead of oil.

I was sceptical halfway through cooking, it didn't taste or smell particularly great - 3 hours later, however, it was gorgeous.
I fried off the bacon and added for the last hour. Used red wine vinegar (that's all I had). Served with sour cream and white wine.
Think it could be great(er) with some white wine during cooking.

I will definitely make it again. I used cider vinegar, always use red potatoes for everything because they are more flavorful and moist than white, and Penzeys 4S, seasoned salt is my choice for salt.

I made it and was very disappointed. I tried again and found success by using bacon grease instead of oil, added 1/4 white sugar, cut vinegar back to 1/3 c apple cider vinegar, tossed sliced potatoes in 1 T of flour. Then cooked with the other ingredients. It was okay. Won’t make again.

I made this in my Instapot set on “ less,” which I thought was same as “low.”  The potatoes did not cook fully— many slices were still crunchy.  I reduced the oil because I left the bacon in the pot after using the Instapot “sauté” mode, along with some of the bacon fat for flavor.  The salad tasted much like my mom’s recipe where the bacon dressing is cooked stovetop—- great! 

 I will try again and adjust the setting and/or cooking time to get the potatoes fully cooked through and tender.

We really didn't like this recipe at all. Found the combination of tastes not to our liking, and it was a bit difficult with alot of ingredients to put together. Would never make it again.

I found this to be very bland. The only flavor that really came through was the vinegar. Hubby even told me not to save the leftovers. Very disappointed.

I used small red potatoes but did not cook well in the crockpot so I transferred out of the bag into a pyrex dish and placed it in the oven for 1 hour at 350 degrees. 
Too much of a vinegar taste for my pallete.

Although I followed the recipe exactly, the potatoes did not get totally done. Even adding a couple of hours of cooking time, they were still tough and slightly raw. Also, the flavor was more bland than I had hoped.

Made this with a combo of red, orange, and green bell peppers. Came out great.
