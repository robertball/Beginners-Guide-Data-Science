I love this cake. My Mother used to make a cake like this only it was called Romance Cake. I think that was when you served it to your sweetheart well lets just the cake was named for a reason,FABULOS.  I used my printer to print this on several a pieces of  printable magnet. It is on my frige and I gave others to friends and family I won't missplace this recipe ever again.

Quite good, with a great flavor.  I read what another reviewer wrote and started baking the cake before I put the meringue on (~5 minutes).  I didn't need to do that.  Next time, I'll probably add a couple more egg whites to the meringue, just to have a thicker topping.

I followed the recipe to the T and it came out wonderful! I've never made any kind of homemade cake before. The Meringue was good too. I did use one more egg white for the meringue. I shared some with my older(60+) neighbors. They loved it and told how it tasted like cake when they were younger. I love this cake and will make it again! Its a favorite!

This is a nice cake. Moist and flavorful and easy to make.  I used coconut extract instead of vanilla.  This took about 45-50 minutes to bake, not 30.

This cake is absolutely delicious! Very light and still fresh the next day. The only changes I made were to add an extra egg white.

This is really a good cake. I made it according to the recipe and it came out wonderful. I love the Old Fashioned taste and the flavor of cakes from when I was a child. Make this cake for any occassion and you won't be dissapointed.

A good variation from other cakes.  This cake is moist with a slightly brown crunchy top.  The coconut brings a nice flavor to the cake.  My husband and friends love eating it.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks Carol!

The cake was great.  We had company coming over one evening so I made it in the afternoon.  There were only 3 pieces (from 16) left when the evening was over - so 5 people ate 13 pieces of this cake.  One of my guest even asked if I would make the cake again and bring it to her daughters baby shower.  It was a big hit.

I liked the top part a lot, but the cake was too dry.

I made the cake according to the recipe. The only difference was I wanted more meringue so I made the cake with four eggs. I only had a brownie pan close to what was requested in the recipe it was fine. When I was mixing the batter I thought oh no itâ€™s going to be a heavy dense cake , you know like a brick. I baked it without the topping for 25 mins then put the meringue on and browned it with the broiler. Boy Was I wrong it was light, nice crumb, and the meringue was perfect. Now this cake is a major recipe in our house.

the taste was good but  this was a stressful cake. i would probably suggest cooking the batter of the cake first before the merigne bc it takes much longer than 35 mins to bake. the merigne also gets too done in that time.

I used cake flour.  Seems to be foolproof and turned out perfectly.  Also didn't have any milk, so  used coconut milk instead.  In spite of my changes, this is a delicious recipe - and easy!
