Delicious. I didn't have paprika so I substituted cayenne and it added a bit of a kick. Next time I will add a little more goat cheese though, but I really like goat cheese.

I had made some lentil soup with my own recipe and froze some. My recipe was similar to this but without the arugula and feta. I put my frozen soup in the slow cooker and added the arugula and feta and it made a huge difference!  Very good. I will make it this way from now on....Thank you :)

Best lentil soup ever.  I've made lentil soup in all kinds of variations, but this will be promoted to "go-to" status from now on.

White wine is everything is this recipe! While I omitted arugula because husband is not a fan and used feta cheese because that's what I had, I doubt those small tweaks took anything away from the hearty and tasty qualities this soup possesses.

Served with crisp hot garlic bread, any foodie will feast on this simple tummy-warming meal as the days and evenings grow cooler.
