This recipe was my first attempt at making chili. And let me tell you, it was DELICIOUS! It says it makes 10 servings but I couldn't get enough. Actually, it yielded about 8 servings. I feed my family of four and it was about 2 servings a piece. I didn't have fire roasted tomatoes so, I used regular diced tomatoes and was very pleased with the results. I can not wait to make this again. It is similar in texture to Wendy's chili. However, I think this is better! Loved it!

I made this for the first time tonight and followed the recipe exactly. It was ok, but way too bland for my family's tastes. My husband, who usually eats anything, was adding stuff to it at the table while he was eating it. All 3 of my kids didn't like it at all.  I have definitely made better tasting chili, but this does have healthy ingredients.

I am SO glad I made this!!! I got a brand new 6-qt. digital Crock Pot for Christmas this year, so I've been on a mad hunt for slow cooker recipes! This was the first one I decided to make since we had about a week's-worth of Winter come through about a week ago.
It was so extremely amazing! The only thing I changed was that I used 80/20 ground beef in place of the turkey (I have a thing about ground turkey). It was the best chili I have ever made in my life! It wasn't so spicy that it left my lips blistered, but had a little kick with the tomatoes. 
I saved exactly half of it to freeze and my husband and I ate off off it for three days. The part that I froze is enough to invite my youngest daughter and her family (5 extra people)!!! I WILL be making this again. Extremely easy recipe, and extremely good!!!  
I made some rice, had assorted grated cheeses, and good old-fashioned corn bread to go with it (the rice helps with young children who can't tolerate any spice--even though it's not a really spicy-hot chili). It's good all by itself, however!
Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

This was great, but a bit bland... Admittedly I didn't have the green chiles...or the 'fire roasted' tomatoes - just used 2 cans of plain tomatoes.  However, I added some coriander.  That was awesome!  I would recommend cilantro if you have it on hand, coriander if you don't.  I only had whole coriander so  I crunched it up in a tea bag and floated it in the crockpot.  The cilantro/coriander adds this lovely after taste, and covers up some of the bean aftertaste.  Also 1 cup or more of frozen corn - added in the last hour or so of cooking.  I made it with beef and was a bit generous with the beef.  Served with options of shredded cheese, sour cream, and hot sauce.  It got rave reviews at a recent potluck.

Add 1 tsp of salt and 3/4 c beer plus a pinch of red crushed pepper and/or 1 diced jalape√±o! We love it! Serve it with home made corn bread or fritos and a dollop of sour cream. Delicious!!!

I really enjoyed this dish and I pumped it up by using pinto, black and kidney beans and extra tomatoes.  Instead of purchasing separate herbs, I have a great Watkins Garlic Herb Blend but I also used fresh garlic - lots of it!  I used unsalted ingredients for the most part and added very little.  I ate it for dinners/lunches over the span of almost two weeks but none of it went to waste!  It's versatile - great by itself, with corn chips, with sour cream/cheese, over a baked potato.  I would definitely make it again.

I made this last night. I skipped the tomato sauce and made it vegan.  Added lots more chili powder and oregano and sauteed the onion, garlic and peppers in olive oil for 5-7 minutes before throwing it in. Top with vegan cheddar and tortilla chips and voila

For weight watchers friendly I omitted the turkey and used fresh poblano peppers. It was fantastic! I now have this in my refrigerator as a staple to have a quick go to protein and lunch. You can dress it up with sour cream (or greek yogurt) and cheddar cheese! Love it!

Substituted some lean beef sausage slices instead of turkey and stewed tomatoes instead of fire roasted tomatoes.  Thickened sauce just a bit and served on top of white rice. Very good.

Always a family favorite!  We like extra meat, so we add an additional pound of lean ground beef.  We also add a bag of frozen corn.  Smells delicious as it slowly simmers!

Delicious and easiest to make EVER!!! I add just a bit more cumin (like 1/2 tsp), and make sure to NOT use the ‚Äúhot, spicy‚Äù chili powder and the mild diced green chilies (I can‚Äôt do hot spicy at all so this is perfect for me).

In my opinion this recipe is far too artificial. For those of us who are not blessed with a convenience store or a hypermarket within walking distance it would be nice to start this recipe with RAW ingredients. Dried beans (which every cook worth their salt should have in their larder). Fresh green chilis please - I have never even seen a tinned variety -(I live in Bolivia). Also - why is it called a 3 bean chili (implying vegetarian) when the first ingredient is Turkey? I like allrecipes for ideas but this recipe is too misleading and fast food orientated.

I might make it again.  But major oversight in this recipe is not spicing the turkey prior to mixing with the remainder of the ingredients.  No amount of spice was going to fix the bland flavor of the turkey  :-(

My family was all about this. My adjustments were due to availability but turned out great! Omitted green chilies (unavailable), chili powder & oregano (forgot). Used 1 can diced tomatoes and jalapenos, 1 can diced tomatoes with onion & garlic, ~ 8 oz. tomato sauce.  Added 1 lb. turkey kielbasa cut small and 1 tsp. salt.  Garnished with shredded cheese and plain yogurt (or sour cream).

Made today in crock pot on low, all the seasonings using garlic salt. Added vegetable broth and only 2 canned beans (sorry) chili and black beans and Rotel.  Cheese on top served with tortilla chips. I outdid myself!

Delicious. I thought it was going to be too hot with all that chili powder, but it was fine. I did add a bit of smoked chipotle salt.  It rounded out the flavor.  My husband couldn't get enough of this.

I've made this one several times and am a big fan of it. It's very nutritious and filling. The only thing I would suggest is using lean beef instead of turkey.

Super easy, very delicious!  Def will make again.  I used cubed steak since I had that in my freezer left over from a stew I made in the past but will make with ground turkey or ground beef next time.

I agree that it was bland.  I added green peppers, chicken broth, oregano, paprika, coliander, cumin and alot more chili powder.  Used fresh garlic and top it off with seasoned salt.  I used dry beans cooked about 7 hours then added all ingredients and cooked another 4.  I didn't use chili peppers because they didn't have any at store.

This was delicious! I added a can of corn (rinsed and drained) and it added some nice crunch/color/flavor. Served with avocado slices, chives, and sour cream, then corn bread on the side. Will definitely make again!

Loved this chili. So much easier than the previous recipe I followed. Use be sure to add salt as it was a little bland without it.

I used ground beef instead of the turkey and added bell pepper, celery, and cilantro. As some others mentioned, it was a bit bland-so I ended up adding some chili seasoning to pep it up.  A good base recipe. Just adjust to personal preferences.

Great recipe. I left out the green chilies because of personal taste. Everybody loved it , even the kids. Going to make it again for a football party.

This is wonderful!!!  Easy and great for freezing.  I could not find canned Chili Peppers so I used fresh and chopped them up.  Fire roasted tomatoes were not available either but using canned tomatoes were fine!  I also used about 1/4 pound ground beef (93% lean) in addition to the ground turkey to give the browning of the turkey a little boost.  Will definitely make again, especially this winter!!!! BRRRRR

Very easy recipe to follow and make.  I didn't rinse pinto or kidney beans which thickened the chili nicely.  I added a can of original Rotel tomatoes to give it a little kick. I will definitely make this again.  THIS IS A KEEPER!!!

Good recipe, but a little bland. It needed a little bit of heat. I added chopped up jalape√±o and some cayenne pepper.

This was amazing!  New favorite for our family!  Added a can of petite tomatoes and a small can of green chilies. If you are following weight watchers we figured this to be 1 cup = 4 points.  Great meal!

I followed the recipe and it was delicious! Great for those who are converting meals into healthy options.  
With that said I decided to step it up in flavor with 1tbs Sea salt and a extra 1/2-1tsp of chile powder.  
Great recipe, Cheap and easy too! I bought enough ingredients to make the dish twice for family and it was only 28 bucks :)
