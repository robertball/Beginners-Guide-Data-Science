I needed to look in a couple of cookbooks to find out what to do with the oysters, since I had never used them before.  Their advice:  simmer about 5 minutes in saucepan, drain and chop.  Also, I needed much more than 1/2 cup drippings.  I used chicken broth (about a cup or more).  Most people liked this at our pitch-in.  I guess you need to like the flavor of oysters.  I would also advise greasing the baking dish.  Enjoy!

Tastes even better the second day! This also freezes well, and we make a double batch the night before Thanksgiving so that we have some for Christmas Dinner. Wonderful recipe!

Had this recipe advertised itself as something better than "basic," I would have ranked it lower, but since it delivers on "basic" very well, I've ranked it as a 4 (for delivering what was promised). This dressing is really mild and as written needed more oysters. In all fairness to Lisa, she notes that the oyster volume should be adjusted to taste, which I will do next time. I will research spices to add next time I use this recipe. The large baking dish required in the instructions was too large. The dressing was spread too thin and could have easily been burned. I will use a smaller baking dish next time.

I sauteed the oysters with the vegetables in bacon fat and added some chopped garlic and carrot. This needed a bit more liquid than was even asked for, so I used some of the pan drippings from the chicken I roasted. I did end up adding salt/pepper/sage after giving it a test before sticking it in the oven. With my additions, this is a good stuffing.

This needs way more seasoning than called for to give it any flavor!! I had to do alot of adding and it still was not the classic stuffing taste.

Really very good.  I was worried it was going to be too dry, so added an additional 1/2 cup of drippings, which made it soggy.  So, next time I will just follow the exact recipe (though, we doubled the oysters, since we live near the water and get them fresh!).  Great recipe!

I don't like stuffing and don't eat this, but I tried my hand at making it this past Thansgiving, after my MIL passed away (she always used to make the stuffing).  The family ate all of this, between the main meal and the leftovers, and all said they thought it was very good.  Thank you for letting me keep a family tradition going!

We love oyster stuffing on Thanksgiving but I have never had a recipe...just winged it.  My family doesn't like the cornbread type so this was perfect!  I made a basic stuffing recipe and subbed some of the turkey broth with the liquid from the oysters.  It was really good!
