Wonderful change of pace from the normal rosemary seasoned lamb dishes. Lots of juices retained by cooking it wrapped in foil. Great flavor.  Only thing that is a challenge is getting it rolled up, depending on the shape of it this can be difficult, but don't sweat it, just make it work whatever way you have to, it will still cook just fine. Make sure you wrap it well with foil, it is a large chunk of meat and you are going to need more than one sheet. I ended up using 4, 1 under it and 3 wrapped around it.  Enjoy. Thank you poker playing chef!

I made this for my wife's birthday as lamb is her favorite and artichoke hearts are her second favorite.  We had several people over and everyone agreed it was 5 stars.  It did take a little longer than advertised to cook, however.

I made this with lamb chops. I seared the lamb in my cast iron skillet then added the stuffing on top covered with foil and baked in oven at 375 for 10 mins. It was delicious!

At a loss....I followed the recipe to the letter but the amount of time this had to cook was way off for me. My husband and son love lamb and all the spices sounded delicious so I thought it would be perfect. They said the meat didn't have much flavor unless you ate every bite with the filling.
