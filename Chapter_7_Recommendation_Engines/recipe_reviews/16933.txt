My chili came out great but that was with some changes to this recipe...I only put in 3 cans of beans...i used a can of diced tomatoes and a small can of tomatoe paste instead of the suggested can of tomotoes. I used 3 times the chili powder and also added two hot peppers used only one green pepper and threw in some hot sauce and salt....otherwise it would have been to runny and too beany and too bland...4 hours was perfect cooking time in the slow cooker.

I really wish I would have read the other reviews prior to making this.  The recipe 'as is' does not make a very good chili.  It is very runny, not enough chili powder and has WAY too many beans in it.  I think the changes suggested by the other reviewers would help a lot.

Very good!  I used about 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef and I only used three cans of kidney beans (it just seemed like a lot of beans)with one green pepper.  Also, I added garlic powder, salt and pepper and used A LOT more chili powder than the recipe called for. I used about four tablespoons. It was a little watery so I added a small can of tomato paste!  I thought it was a great recipe overall! I will make this agian without a doubt!  Thank you!

My family loved this one!  I made 12 servings but only used half of the cans instructed (I don't like a lot of beans).  I also added a bay leaf, Italian seasoning and a lot of garlic (6 cloves for 12 servings).  I also put some tomato paste - I have it in a tube so I just squeezed it in) to try and thicken it up a little.  What an improvement to an already wonderful recipe!

After reading reviews and taking others suggestions I made my chili with: almost 2 lbs ground beef, 1 greean bell pepper diced, 1 red bell pepper diced, 1 onion diced, 2 cans of kidney beans, 1 can chili beans, 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 small can tomato paste, 1 1/2 cups water, lots of salt, pepper and chili powder. It turned out perfect!4 hrs was the perfect amount of time. It was my first chili attempt and its now a family favorite.

Try using tomato paste in place of some of the canned tomatoes for a thicker consistency.  You may want to add a bit of suger, however, to sweeten it up.

Followed the others advice with regards to liquids. I used 3 cans and poured off the first part of the liquid in each can. It was just right for our tastes. I did increase the amount of chili as well to 3 tsps. We enjoyed it and will certainly have this again.

Like some of the others that rated this chili recipe, I also found it to be way too soupy and have too many beans. I didn't even add as many beans as I was supposed to! I really had to modify this recipe. My husband loves chili and said this was very bland. Sorry for the bad review :o(

Loved this chili.  It's so easy to make too.  It is kinda hard to mess up chili, though...I mean you can add pretty much whatever you want to it as long as you have the main ingrediants of meat and beans.  I add celery sometimes, different bell peppers for taste and colour, few different spices.  You just have to mess around a bit with ingrediants or add or subtract whatever tastes you do or dont like!

I agree with many of the other ratings. 3 cans of beans not 5 (drained). I put 2 Tablespoons of chili powder because I like it spicy. I also found that it tasted better the next day after all the flavors melded. Perfect for chili size topped with cheese or sour cream.

This recipe requires so many alterations to make it taste like something other than tomato bean soup that there is no way to give it a good rating as chili. I often read the reviews for tips and tricks to improve even a great recipe. I made this twice having to add 6times the chili powder, cutting the beans in half, adding additional seasonings to give it flavor and then I finally realized, I was creating a new recipe! Making this chili as is will create a very bland, very watery, bean and tomato concoction, not chili.

I used one can of chili beans in sauce, can of Rotel, can of tomato sauce, and some kidney beans I soaked over night. I like my chili thicker so I just added some water so it wouldn't dry out while I left it in the slow cooker for 6 hours. I found mine to be just fine for an easy night. Served with corn bread and it was a hearty meal. Thanks for sharing.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I'm a very hesitant beginner cook and I've now made this at least 10 times and my family and I really enjoy it. It's a little different every time, but it always turns out well. Seems like you can't really mess it up..... just my kind of recipe. Enjoy!

This made a pretty good chili. My one complaint is that the recipe didn't have enough chili powder.

Great base recipe, I downsized the amounts for a smaller slow cooker, added in some salsa and cooked for 8 hours on a low setting- instant dinner when you come home from work!

Ok, I read the reviews and came up with a modified version of this recipe. This is my version : 1 lb. of ground beef, 1 jalapeno, 3 cans of kidney beans, 1 can of diced tomatoes, and 1 Tbsp. chili powder. It turned out wonderfully (and the house spelled so good)! Thanks! I will make again.

I took MELISAWARREN's advice.  Used 3 (15 ounce) cans of Kidney Beans, one regular can of diced tomatoes, one small can of tomato paste. Also one red bell pepper (chopped), one jalepeno pepper (chopped), one teaspoon chili powder.  While I browned the meat, I sprinkled on 1 tsp Tradewinds BBQ seasoning, 1/2 tsp salt.  It came out great! Has a good kick to it, my boyfriend loves it. I love it because it's so easy to throw everything in the slow cooker and forget about it. With 1lb ground beef (85% lean) and all of the above ingredients, it pretty much fills up my 3-quart cooker. 4 hours was just enough cooking time.

Is it just me? I find that 1/4 tsp of chili powder is like...nothing. I throw in TABLESPOONS of the stuff. And hot sauce and garlic and oregano and whatever else I can find.   This to me was like spaghetti sauce with beans...in fact this would taste good on top of spaghetti!

A basic chili but I like it that way. I added a little extra organic diced tomatoes to the tomato paste.  This is a simple recipe and you can strengthen the taste by adding more or less chili seasoning, salt and pepper.

Really good chili recipe. Changed it up a bit by adding extra chili powder, grounded cumin, and cayenne pepper (for a little kick).  This recipe is a definite keeper.

I made certain changes to this recipe.  I used 2 cans of chili and 1 can of kidney beans, one can of diced tomatoes and a 1/4 of tomato ketchup, a pound and a half of hamburger and one chopped onion and I used the 1/4 tsp of chili powder.  My recipe came out perfectly fine and wasn't watery.  I just thought 5 cans of beans seemed like too much.  Mine seemed to strike a perfect balance between beans and meat.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much.  A nice spicy recipe for a cold winter day.  I prefer tomato puree and it worked nicely.  It made a large pot of chili.  With only the two of us to eat the recipe (day after day until it is gone), I think I will use less beans next time.

This had a good flavour..but way to runny.  This was the first time I have ever made chili and the first time I have used my slowcooker.  I would drain the beans next time...and have less of them..I only used three cans of kidney beans and subsituted one can of chick peas(which was a great choice for chili).  I would use more beef and mor chili powder.  It just wasn't what you would expect when thinking about chili.

I used the large cans of kidney beans, and I drained the liquid, but used about 2 cups after everything was in the crockpot.  I didn't find it to be watery.  Served with cheese, and oyster crakers!  Although it was GREAT it wasn't 5 star quality.

Added stewed tomatoes instead of peeled and really enhanced the flavor. Used half the liquids and added garlic and a cut up jalapeno. Turned out delicious

I put 1/4 c chili powder plus cumin, 1 can of chopped green chiles (mild) vs bell peppers but definitely the onion!  One T of Taco seasoning. Two cans of beans drained & rinsed, 2 cans diced tomatoes, beef broth as needed for consistency. A couple handfuls frozen corn (or a can drained) near the end.  Everything else pretty much the same.  I offer Fritos, shredded cheese & sour cream for those who choose Frito Chili Pie. Sorry, but I guess I rewrote the recipe. I love beans, all kinds of bean soups, bean casseroles.

I did not care for this recipe. I should have read all the other reviews first, b/c nobody liked it as is. Way too many beans, not enough meat, no seasonings... it was bland and watery. It also takes much longer than 4 hours to cook the vegetables down tender, and there's no instruction as to breaking up the whole tomatoes... I've tried to doctor it up as best I can but it's not even close to being done cooking yet!

Tastes great, very easy to make.  Especially good for cold winter nights.  We added some tabasco after it was done for a little extra spice. We also used turkey rather than beef to make a little more healthy.

I had a half can of diced tomatoes and was wondering what to do with it so I took this recipe as a base and made lots of changes. I added about a half cup of hot salsa because of the small amount of diced tomato we used and half a small can of tomato paste. I used only 1 can of red kidney beans (drained) which was just enough and about 3/4 lb of extra lean ground turkey. I also used just a small amount of green pepper and used dried onion flakes since my husband won't eat fresh onions. I added some red wine to give it more flavor and to keep it from being too thick. For seasoning I added lots of salt and pepper, parsley, garlic powder, and a lot more chili powder then the recipe called for (about 2 tsp) and it still wasn't spicy enough for me (although my husband thought it was perfect). I sprinkled some crushed chili peppers on mine to give it a little more kick. After making all of these changes, we thought that this chili was fantastic. I will make it the same way every time.

Excellent chili!  As others, I found it a bit soupy the first time I made it.  Now I just dump out all the liquid from the kidney beans and it's just right!!

Good basic recipe that needs many alterations. Less beans,  one green pepper, more meat, More ch powder amongst others. To taste. Seasoned salt is a favorite.  A touch of cayenne? 60 years old and have never made chili before!  Happy with what I have created

I made my chili in a small crockpot but; instead I added a can of pinto beans, a LG red onion and a couple dashes of chili powder(taste to your liking). I downsized the pepper and added a LG pepper and instead of tomatoes,I put in (2) cans of small tomatoes sauce.On the side I'd buttermilk biscuits!Yummy!??

I made this chili tonight for dinner, but did many changes. I used four different cans of beans, (pinto, white, black and a chili bean) but I drained most of the juice from each can. I added jalapeno and Serrano peppers and used cayenne pepper instead of chili powder. I added a can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato paste in order to add moisture. If you make the recipe as is, it will be very runny and not have much taste of flavor. I also added salt, pepper and garlic powder. Turned out great.

I'm not a very good cook, so I tend to follow directions to the 'T', which is what I did here. I should have read the reviews. After filling my 5 qt crock pot with mostly beans, I knew that 1/4 tsp of chili powder wasn't going to do anything, but I still did it. I dumped more in later, even though I hate very spicy things. 

This turned out to be an expensive bean soup.

Decrease the cans of beans to 3 (or 4 at most), Increase chili powder at least 3x amount given and I used 1.5 lbs ground beef, not just the 1 lb suggested. Overall though, it's an easy base recipe to follow. I may also add a little hot sauce next time as others have.

After reading some of the other reviews, I also made some changes to the recipe. I used 3 cans of kidney beans (ALL with liquid DRAINED), 4 tablespoons of chili powder, about 2 tablespoons of salsa, and plenty of salt, pepper, garlic salt, and italian seasoning. I cooked it for 4 hours on high and it was just enough. Served it with sour cream, cheddar cheese, and saltines. Would have added Texas Pete to it but we didn't have any. Actually tastes better the next day.

This is a pretty decent base chili recipe. I used a few less beans and little more beef. The soupy consistency is solved with a tablespoon of masa. In lieu of masa, cornstarch would work too.
