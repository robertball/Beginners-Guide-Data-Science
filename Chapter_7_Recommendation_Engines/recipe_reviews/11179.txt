What a variety of reviews! People seem to either love it or hate it, and I went on a mission to find out what was going so wrong for some people and so right for others. Too wet? Too dry? I think it’s the MIXING method that makes a difference. If you mix this like a group of kindergartners would – dump and mix by hand, it should turn out just fine. If you are using an electric stand mixer, you might have to make some changes to get it to work.
My first shot at this recipe was using a KitchenAid stand mixer, and my results were less than ideal. The dough looked nice and rolled out pretty well, but it was impossible to get the cut shapes off of the floured surface without destroying them – even repeatedly flouring the surface and re-rolling wasn’t cutting it – they just stuck down and fell apart. In an attempt to salvage the batch, I put the whole ball back into the mixer and added another 1/4 Cup of flour. Perfect! It rolled out well and cut well on a floured surface, and the cookies turned out great.
Second try was by hand to see if my theory about mixing held true, and it did. The original recipe worked just fine when mixed by hand with a good old-fashioned wooden spoon. I floured the table and rolling pin heavily and repeatedly while rolling and cutting. Stick with the simpler forms like Christmas trees and snowmen, not reindeer with skinny legs – the dough is a bit fragile.
Cookies are soft and puffy, like the ones you get at the bakery with the super-sweet frosting on the

I am dissappointed at the dough quality. As soon as my 5 year old tried to roll the dough it crumbled into little pieces. Then once the shapes were finally cut, as she removed them from the board they crumbled again. This is not a recipe to repeat.

The dough was a little dry even though I was very carefull with my measurements.  After adding a couple table spoons of milk it was much easier to roll out and cut.

This is a fool proof recipe.  I hate cut out cookies because they can be so finicky.  These, however, were rather easy (although my dough was a little dry when cutting the shapes).  And they tasted like the kind my kids like at the store - you know...the ones with all the frosting.  I will make these again.

Crisp, delicious! I rolled them out and cut into shapes, then sprinkled with sugar before baking.  My kids, nieces, and nephews gobbled them up!

I really didn't care for this dough recipe.  It wasn't sweet enough to be sugar cookies, I ended up making a lemon glaze to go over the top.  Plus if you roll it out more than once, it got too crumbly.  I wouldn't use this one again.  It WAS easy, but not worth wasting my time on.

Great tasting, but is not child proof.  The dough is soft  and needs lots of flour to cut out the cookies.

This recipe is horrible. I wish I had read the reviews before I made it. A complete waste of time and money on my ingredients. The flavor isn't bad, but the mix was extremely DRY and the cookies are like bricks!!

hhmmm... read the reviews and thought i was duly prepared.  :)  we added almost a cup of additional flour... still, when we tried to roll these, it was a gooey mess.  we tried the (adorable!) suggestion to pipe some of the dough through a garlic press as "hair" to cookie faces.  it melted into the cookies as they baked and disappeared.  in the end, we made these as drop cookies and they tasted great... tho i'm thinking they should be renamed to "adult-proof" instead. (smiling...)

This is the very best sugar cookie I have ever had and the family loves them too. I've been baking this recipe every Christmas for the past 6 years. It's the best.  I have traded the shortening for butter once or twice, and they were good, however, everyone asked for the - real - sugar cookies. I love that they do not have to be chilled in the fridge before rolling out.  The dough can be a bit on the dry side for some but if you keep working it a bit it rolls out very nicely.  You can roll it out between waxed paper or parchment paper.  Thanks for the recipe!

Here it is another 6 years and I'm making them again.  It's the only sugar cookie recipe I use.

Dec. of 2016 and they turned out beautifully. The best recipe I've ever used.

What a disaster!  I rolled this recipe into three nice sized balls and the dough looked fine.  But as soon as I touched it with my rolling pin, it disintigrated into dry little crumbs.  There was no saving it.  Playdough would make better cookies.

I thought this was a good tasting recipe, my family really enjoyed them.  I found no real problem with the dough, except that I really had to work it with my hands before rolling it out, or else it would be really unmanageable.  The heat of my hands helped soften & heat the shortening.  These cookies are going to become a holiday tradition in my house!!

I have used this recipe for years.  My mom has it in the Betty Crocker Cooky book from the 60's.  I agree that is not a very sweet cookie, they are meant to be frosted (with butter frosting, not royal icing).  You also HAVE to chill the dough before rolling and cutting. If you frost and let the frosting set overnight, they are perfect!  I always make them for my annual cookie exchange and get tons of compliments.

I used butter instead of shortening and they turned out fantastic. I made round cookies and put some of the dough through a garlic press to make hair (long for girls and short for boys)so the grandkids can make faces with frosting. So Cute and so good.

These cookies have great flavor, but it is a terrible recipe for children.  The dough was so crumbly that I had to distract my 4 year old so I could roll out and cut the cookies myself.  They just wouldn't stay together.  When I made them the second time, I doubled the recipe and the dough stayed together much better.

I use this as a basic recipe and I "veganize" it as I am vegan. That means I use vegan shortening (Earth Balance brand usually) and substittions for the egg. This is a GREAT recipe to jazz up with different flavored extracts, etc. I think the reason that it gets such mixes reviews is that people use different kinds of shortening and different mixing and rolling techniques. This always works wonderfully for me and leaves everyone saying, "I can't believe this is a vegan cookie!"

We loved them.  I made them with a 3yo, 4yo & 6yo & had no problem at all.  I substituted microwave-softened unsalted margarine for the shortening.   We also added some red food coloring to the mixture before adding the flour.  The dough was like a slightly moist clay, that the kids worked with for a bit on a floured board before rolling it out.  We found it worked better patting the dough with our hands to a thickness somewhere between 1/8 & 1/4 inch, rather than using our heavy rolling pin.   Delicious!  We're bookmarking this recipe!

The cookies were pretty good, once I was able to get the dough to stick together!  At firts I was a bit discouraged but I added a little milk and an extra egg and after that it was great.  I sent them to my sons preschool Halloween party and they loved them.  I don't think they even touched any of the other cookies that were there!

This recipe turned out terrible! I used exactly what it called for (butter flavored shortning). When we tasted the cookies they tasted just like wax. They tasted like the smell of the shortening. Not one of my 3 and 4 year olds ate any. I don't see how others could enjoy these.

I made these cookies with my two grand daughters ages 3 and 4, and we had a blast!  This was very easy to do with little girls.  They beg to make more everytime they come to visit!  We made so many, we were giving them to everyone.  We sent some home to their house, we took some to church for our Pastor and his family, and their Sunday School Teacher and her family, and of course some were left for Meme and Papa!  The fun we had was ENDLESS!  We even sent this recipe to school since they get to cook every Friday, their teacher was thrilled to get this recipe.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe and the many hours of fun my two precious granddaughters and I shared together.  Now we're on a major search everywhere we go for cookie cutters....just can't seem to find them anymore.  Again, thank you and GOD BLESS!

Well, your little ones may find this recipe very easy, but all I have on my counter is what I can only describe as, a big bowl of beach sand. A bunch of 4 year-olds can make wonderful cookies, but me as a 47 year-old cannot. What did I do wrong??? All my ingredients were fresh.

After reading some of the reviews I really didn't want to make these but a friend of mine said that she had made them and they had a good flavor, however, the dough was dry.  I heeded the advice of others and instead of scooping the flour, I spooned it into the cup and leveled it off.  I did mix it all with my Kitchen Aide mixer and the dough was perfect (Soft and pliable).  I really enjoyed working with this dough.

This recipe did not work for me. I made these with my preschooler, paying careful attention, but the dough was very very soft and we could not roll them out.  When baked, they didn't even hold the shape we cut them into and spread all over the pan.  Once cool, they were hard as a rock!

These taste wonderful. I did have to adjust the recipe a little. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 veg. shortening (reg. not butter flav.) and I added 1/4 cup of water. I mixed it with my kitchen-aid on high and the dough was fluffy and soft. These cookies have a wonderful light crumbly texture. I really like them and will definitely use them again. I made snowflake cut outs and used an icing that hardens with some sugar sprinkled. Very pretty and yummy!

Delicious!!  My 5 yr. old granddaughter and I made them for valentines day, everyone loved them.  They were easy and very tasty.  She's already saying we have to make them for Easter.  We frosted them and put colored sugar on some.

Well, I was a little nervous about trying these cookies, since there were so many "less than great" reviews. But, I thought I'd give it a shot, and if all else failed, I would just eat the dough! :) I did add two eggs, instead of just one, and I added a pinch of salt, which I always add when baking anything. I ended up needing about 3 cups of flour, plus the flour needed to roll out the dough balls. My 6-year-old and I made these over the past 2 hours, and I have to say, "They are awesome!" My little one did most of the rolling and cutting, and I was in charge of the oven. We did not have any decorating sprinkles, but we sprinkled sugar on the cookies before baking. These are yummy and easy little cookies, and we'll for sure make these again. Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making this recipe for years. The dough always seems to be crumply. Through trial and error, I have found that this is a recipe that you have to use your hands. You have basically kneed the dough before rolling it out, adding extra flour as needed. The dough will eventually become the right consistency to roll out. It's little pain-staking task, but I think it is so worth it. We don't like sugar cookies that are to sweet and these are just right.

The end result cookie was somewhat tasty, but the dough was very crumply and cracked alot when rolled. I followed the recipe to the letter, but ended up adding more shortening to roll it out effectively. After the 3rd rollout, I gave up.

The recipe was fine despite two things. One, the recipe did not include water, so I added my own-about 1/2 a cup. Second, the recipe did not have enough sugar to be sweet. Besides for these two things, the dough was easy to work with and was easy to bake with children helping.

I've tried this one twice and found the dough to be very, very dry and impossible to roll out.  I added milk to make it stick together and then dusted with flour to help it roll.  Unfortunately, they fell apart getting from the tray to the cookie sheet.  I am certain I followed the recipe - I am curious what must have been different for those people that love this recipe!

The dough was so crumbly I could barely cut out the cookies.  I re-read the receipe many times to make sure I didn't add the wrong amount but I followed it exactly.  It was not very fun to make with my 3 year old because of this!  I was disappointed to say the least.  The few cookies I was able to cut out tasted fine but I was so frustrated from making them, I was still disappointed.

I called up this recipe last weekend in hopes that it would be a good one. I was nicely surprised. I made a batch for my son's daycare Easter party and I had only one problem with the ingredients... that being it had Almond extract. Nuts and nut products are banned due to alergies. I substituted Imitation Coconut Extract and it still worked out great. The kids loved them and the leftovers went to my office and disappeared quickly. Best roll and cut out recipe I've tried. Thanks a bunch!

I taught special ed for 23 years and this was my "go to" recipe for classroom creations.  The batter may need a little milk,(2T+/-) .  They're delicious  with the  icing.  I got used to keeping cream of tartar on hand for this recipe and the almond extract gives them a good flavor.

We made three doughs from this site for our holiday cookies. Since we my apprentices were 4 and 6 I thought this would be great. It was the worst dough of the bunch. It was so dry the children got frustrated and gave up on it. I had to add water to the dough to try to get it to be useable at all. It does NOT live up to it's name.

Was there something missing in this recipe?  The dough was so dry and crumbly we couldn't do anything with it.  We had to ditch it and start  over with another recipe.  A big disappointment to both my daughter and myself.

I used this recipe with my kids at summer camp.  It was perfect.  Very easy to
work with.  We also converted them into chocolate chip cookies.  The sugar cookies
even made in to the musical at the end of camp.
Thank you!

I found the dough to be too dry so I had to add some water. Other than that, the cookies tasted pretty decent for something that's so easy to make.

Super recipe!  I found that it was very, very kid friendly - my 3 year old could do the stirring and loved adding sprinkles on the top.

I made these cookies with my kids, 11,9 and 5.  The dough was very hard to work with, impossible to roll out due to it's crumbling.  The cookies were far too crunchy.  I would not recommend this recipe for using with kids, unless something is missing from the recipe, these are much too dry.
