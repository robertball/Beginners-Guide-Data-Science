I have been making this recipe for years!  Don't worry about what kind of sour cream you use though!  Only difference from my recipe is that I use half a cup of strong coffee instead of water!  Best and easiest cake ever!

I have made this recipe for years and it is delicious.  ONLY, I have never put sourcream in it.  I use a choc cake mix, sm. pkg of choc. inst. pudding(nofat, no sugar), and 1 bag of choc chips, 1 3/4 C of milk, 2 eggs and if the cake mix has NO oil I use 1/3 C. Mix it all together and put in a pam sprayed bundt pan  350 for 50-55 min.  I never ice it as it is super just the way it is. Next time I will add the No Fat Sour Cream and see how that is.  I bet it is super super moist! A students mom gave this to me  25 years ago and I have saved it ever since!  It's an antique.

This cake is wonderful.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I used chocolate fudge cake mix because that is what I had on hand and I added a touch of cocoa powder to the batter.  The ganache topping is fantastic.  I ended up making the cake as 12 mini bundts instead of a giant bundt and serving individual cakelettes with fresh raspberries.  It would also go nicely with strawberries, sorbet, or by itself.  The raspberries or fruit aren't strictly necessary but if you get them, the raspberry flavor really goes wonderfully with the cake.  The cake was extremely moist.  If you refrigerate (directions suggest that you do that, presumably because of the topping) let the cakes return to room temperature before serving so that the icing becomes soft.  It tastes good cold too, but it is more like chocolate candy when taken straight out of the refrigerator.

Amazingly delicious cake whose crowning glory is the FROSTING you make with the chocolate and Cool Whip (and it makes a LOT of it). I plan to use just that portion as a separate recipe for frosting.  I would say just make sure you follow exactly. Make sure the frosting is warm enough to be drippy while applying (it hardens a bit when it cools).   The rasberries are a nice touch but not necessary for those who want to skip it. I used FROZEN thawed rasberries.

My Mom has been making this cake as long as I can remember but she adds chocolate chips and doesn't make the ganache. I being the chocolate adict that I am, added the chips and the ganache. I am really not a cool whip fan so I used heavy cream, semi sweet chocolate, and powdered sugar to make mine. This cake is rich, moist, and delish. I am a caterer by trade and make this cake very often as it is not costly, and always amazing.

"What you put in, you get out" The artificial tasting ingredients such as cake mix and instant pudding don't disappear with the addition of the other ingredients as I had hoped. SO if you are looking for a really impressive dessert for a dinner party- this isn't it.  It tastes a little better than Entenmann's or other commerical pastry (which are good in their own way- but  just have a certain mass produced flavor). BUT on the positive side- and this is pretty important- it is INCREDIBLY EASY and can be whipped up in minutes by a novice baker and also comes out extremely moist. An excellent texture-not crumby or dry at all-- great for a kid's birthday cake! 2 comments- at my supermarket, I couldn't find any cake mix that was specifically for a double layer cake- so I used 2 complete packets and have no idea if I used the right amount. An actual measurement would be less confusing. Also-- the glaze was far too much. I used half because I didn't have room to pour the rest and it was dripping off the platter as it is. It's also a good idea to let the sauce thicken before pouring it over- about 1/2 hour in the fridge. Otherwise it is really messy and gets everywhere.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever made, and my family said it was the BEST cake they'd ever had! (And my sister wants to be a chef, and my aunt prides herself - appropriately - on making gourmet desserts!) The ONLY thing I would change for the next time I make the cake is to add 1/4 cup less sour cream; I thought I could taste a hint of sour cream, so I think lessening the amount by a tad would eliminate that flavor, but keep the rich, moist texture. In stead of a bundt, I made 2 9-in rounds and used the topping in the center and on top as an icing. Oh my goodness - the icing was like a truffle!!!!! I probably ate a quarter of the cake myself. I can't say enough about this....it was so easy and tasted like it came from a bakery.

I've been making this for years but without the choc topping, I always stir in 1 cup of mini choc chips before pouring into the pan.  Very moist and sure to satisfy a chocoholic, I'm anxious to try the topping next time I make it..sounds good and rich.!

Okay if I could give this 10 stars I would! I did not make the coolwhip topping stuff (coolwhip is yucky to me) I made these into cupcakes and added to the batter a cup of mini chocolate chips and grated a half a bar of dark chocolate into the batter. They were amazing. Defiantely a go to recipe for me!

I made this cake yesterday, and there is one little slice left.  It is very moist(almost a sponge cake consistency). It is very good and very very easy to make.I followed the recipe exactly, but used another brand of low fat sour cream. But, as far as making the little stars on top with the cool whip, well that just didn't happen.  I don't know if the icing was too hot, but I just had little white blobs on top..lol!  I also could not find raspberries, so I cut up strawberries, stirred in a spoonful of sugar, and poured these into the middle.  It was very tasty and my family was impressed with the presentation, even with the little white blobs!  Will definitely make again!

I had a very specific idea in mind for the cake I wanted to bake today so I had to scout around to find a recipe for the cake as well as the filling.  Since I was making a chocolate layer cake with no frosting, I was after a moist, dark chocolate cake with a rich, billowy cream filling.  For the cake, this recipe fit the bill.   I chose this basically for the reference, as I’ve made it many times over many years – it’s a darned good and reliable chocolate cake recipe that really passes for a homemade cake (unlike yellow cake mixes for the most part). The ganache made with Cool Whip and chocolate has always intrigued me and I’m sure it would be an adequate substitute for the real thing. That said, I’m probably not likely to try it, however, since the real thing, with real cream, requires no more effort and will have a bigger pay-off.  This cake, just as I expected, was just what I needed paired with the filling from “Chocolate Sandwich Cookies l,” also from this site.

My family loved this recipe. They are not crazy about raspberries.  So I used strawberries instead. Have lots of milk or coffee it is very rich.

made this for my son's bday 2day. cake itself was good and moist. Didn't have enought whip cream maybe that was it, but the frosting was super chocolately sweet, even for me, had to save it by adding strawberry icing had in cupboard. Mixed it well with the chocolate and saved the day! All in all was good. But didn't understand the starshaped wooded toothpick thing. Maybe figure that out later, but family liked it the birthday boy liked it and so did i, will make again

I wish I could give this more stars! This is the best basic recipe for cake mix enhancements, using the least fat and less sour cream. I use this as a standard for any cake mix I use, substituting flavors such as butterscotch pudding with betty crocker butter pecan cake. MMMM!

Yummy.  Good with the sauce or just use for a decadent boxed cake recipe.  You can also use this recipe in white cake, just substitute the chocolate pudding for vanilla.  The results: an easy box cake with a homemade taste.  Really good with a peanut butter frosting.

I am not a cake fan. It is the one dessert that I can pass on. But this is no ordinary cake! Everyone in the family raved about this recipe. More than one person went back for seconds even after a large Christmas meal. Will be making this again for sure.

I made this one for a family birthday.  It was a big hit.  I didn't have any raspberries, so I left the middle empty.  It was very good without the fruit.  I am anxious to try it again with the raspberries.

I really enjoyed this cake. My family really enjoyed it aswell. I did a small change to it. When I added the chocolate chips I added some mint chocolate chips (approx half the amount I put it) . And everyone thought it added a nice touch to it.

This cake is delicious!!  I didn't do the Cool Whip and Raspberries however.  I did add 1 cup chocolate chips to the batter as well as 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract.  Just a hint of mint and so yummy!  Frosted with Pillsbury milk chocolate frosting because I was in a hurry for a co-worker's birthday. Decorated with some fresh strawberries and voila!  Instant raves! Baking time was just a smidge over one hour.

I made this for Mother's Day, and it was gorgeous! Definitely gets a five star for looks. I LOVED the chocolate topping, and will most definitely be using that handy little trick again! As one user pointed out, the taste is still definitely a boxed cake mix taste, although the sour cream and pudding make it better. It was better than regular cake mix, but not homemade cake good:). Overall a very beautiful cake, and super easy to put together!!!

Awesome recipe!  Makes a delicious moist dense chocolate cake.  For speed, I just made a quick dark chocolate glaze and drizzled while warm.  Will be making again!

Definitely yummy, definitely easy. I'd make this again for sure. The chocolate sauce is really, really good but definitely let it harden a bit before pouring it over the cake.

Good but not outstanding. Just average for my family. Box mix is okay in a pinch but scratch tastes SO much better!

Followed the recipe and it was sooooo moist!  I didn't make the 'stars' on top the second time and I substituted whole wheat pastry flour and it was still very good!

Omg this cake rocks!! I used a devils food cake mix and Im here to tell you it was delicious! I didnt have any whipped cream on hand to make the topping that goes along with this cake recipe but did use a different AllRecipes chocolate glaze recipe for the topping and added some chopped up almonds sprinkled on top. Beautiful as well as scrumptious!

I thought this was delicious. Very moist and spongy cake. I did substitue brewed coffee for the water. Used strawberries instead of raspberries, but I'm sure both would be great. Not everyone liked the semi-sweet topping, might try using milk chocolate next time.

I was looking for the best chocolate cake recipe and I found it!!  I made it this weekend and took it to a "Graduation"/Father's Day party- they loved it! I wouldn't change a thing--it is delish!! ...and most of all, it is so easy to make!  Thanks for sharing this recipe. Can't wait till I make the next one--will use the 'strong coffee'instead of water as suggested by one of the reviewers.

I made this for my husband's birthday - so quick and easy. Everyone raved about it, and said it was the best chocolate cake they have ever had!!!I did change one thing - I made half of the glaze (4 squares chocolate & 1 1/2 cups cool whip), and it was perfect! This will now be my "go to" recipe for chocolate cake!!!

I made this last night (very late) and when I turned it out onto a plate after it cooled I couldn't wait and ate a piece.  It was DELICIOUS!!  I haven't even added the chocolate drizzle/glaze to the top yet, but on its own it was amazing. I did add 1/2 a bag of chocolate chips to the actual cake. Definitely try this one out!  It doesn't get much easier than this, either.

As far as boxed cake goes, this was pretty good.  The make-shift ganache however was AMAZING and is the reason why I'm giving this 5 stars.  I can't wait to try making the topping with white chocolate or even butterscotch chips!

This cake recipe is awesome! I followed the recipe pretty much as it is, except I left out the raspberries simply because I didn't have any on hand. The cake turned out great. Super delicious, very moist. It's like melt in your mouth good. The recipe is spot on, I couldn't have done it better myself. Thanks for sharing.

COOKING AT ALTITUDE--

Since recently moving to Calgary, Canada I've had to make some "adjustments" in the way I bake and cook. The Altitude here is 3700 ft. And this recipe came calling for my daughter's 31st birthday.

I added 3 extra tbs of sour cream to increase moisture and elevated temperature to 365 degrees and 2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips. The first few minutes were frightening! The cake rose to the very top of the Bundt pan, but I crossed my fingers and let it go. I settled down nicely in the cooling process.

Wife and daughters all said, this was the best cake I've ever made! Commented on the moisture especially. I'm not sure if this was the best cake I've made, but it had great flavor and texture. Hope the high altitude bakers will try/comment.

Made for a good friends birthday.  So good.  Defintely add some sugar to the whipped cream.  I did it twice, the second time I added powdered sugar as it was too bitter otherwise.  Everyone agreed that they liked it with the powdered sugar best.  Very rich.

I made this cake and I did change the recipe a little.  I didn't use the chocolate cake mix, but instead I used a butter recipe cake mix, 1 stick of butter, and cheese cake pudding mix.  The cake came out very moist and good.  I can only assume that the chocolate cake would be just has moist.  The only reason I didn't make the cake according to the recipe was because my hubby doesn't like chocolate.  I love chocolate, so next time I will make the chocolate cake.

I am making my fourth cake in three weeks. Took a giant leap and made it for the first time as a sympathy cake, the family raved. I have yet to include the fruit, too expensive this time of year. The chocolate alone does the trick. yummy.
