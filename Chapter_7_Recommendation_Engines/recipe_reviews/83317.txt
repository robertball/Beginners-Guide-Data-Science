Uhm....no.  Boring.  We used boneless, skinless chx breasts and my husband said the chicken was tough (try covering it in foil if you do bnless/sknless chx for the first half or more of cooking) and the sauce had little flavor.  I didn't try the chx, but tried the sauce and thought it was b-o-r-i-n-g!  It needs more....EVERYTHING!  Cayenne, brown sugar, worcestershire, more flavor in general.  It tasted like vinegar and tomato sauce.  Sorry, dear, but next time I'll use one of Steven Raichlen's recipes...y'know, the KING of bbq??  Now that man knows how to make a sauce!  We won't be trying this again.  Big disappointment.

I had 11 guests for my husbands birthday dinner and made this dish.  It was great.  Everyone commented on how good it was.  I used legs and breasts.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make this again for sure.

I looked at the ingredients and actually doubted the recipe at first, but after actually baking the chicken I realized the flavors all compliment each other! thankyou!

The rosemary provides excellent flavor to the chicken. This is a great recipe - very quick and easy to make, too!

I tried this recipe because I'd never made baked chicken with rosemary as one of the main flavors.  I'm glad I tried this and thought it was a nice change, but don't think that I'll be making it very often.   I think there was too much vinegar and not enough sweetness for my taste.

I just made this and it was so surprisingly delicious.  My whole family loved it including my 10 month old daughter and 3 year old son.  it's a nice way to enjoy succulent chicken with hardly any effort.

I made this not because it sounded good but because the prep time was so minimal.  I was pleasantly surprised (despite the ketchup!)

Made as is.  Next time I think I might cut back in the vinegar just a tad-and I usually am a vinegar fiend.  Otherwise tasty and easy to make.

My mother always used a similar recipe; the only difference is she did not use mustard;  nor did she boil the sauce (she melted the butter, added the other ingredients and poured it over the chicken and onion). I make it at least once a month and guests love it!

I needed a quick and easy recipe for bone-in chicken breasts and found this one. I didn't have some of the ingredients so here's what I substituted: dried italian seasoning for rosemary and 1/2 TBS of wasabi for dried mustard. I also added a tablespoon of brown sugar. My husband and I really enjoyed it and the chicken came out very tender with a nice tangy/sweet and flavorful taste to it.
