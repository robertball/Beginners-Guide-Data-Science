Creamy, nice texture and fresh, but it lacks a sort of deepness that I want. Maybe some sour cream or bacon to go in it? It lacks the full bodied taste. Although it is still good, I would make something else. The celery is an interesting touch however.

These are really good. If you are looking for a low-carb way to eat your potatoes and not feel guilty, this is your recipe. The flavor of the celery root is subtle. The important step is letting them dry out a bit as written. This recipe gives you creamy mashed potatoes without the watery celery root stealing the show. Thank you for the recipe.

Great tasting mashed potatoes, gravy optional.
