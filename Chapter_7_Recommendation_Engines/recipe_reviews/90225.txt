"Szilvas Gomboc"!--I remember helping my Yugoslavian/Hungarian mom make these as a child! Except we put a plum into one 4 inch dough square and bring the corners up to the middle and roll in your hands untill they are round, instead of using two round dough pieces!
This wonderful, 5 star, dumpling recipe brings back many warm memories! Thanks.

My Czech family makes similar plum dumplings but the best part is topping them with hot melted butter and then sprinkle a ground poppy seed and sugar mixture on top. I can't imagine them without it.

I had a bunch of extra plums that were too tart and wanted to find a way to use them up. I've never heard of plum dumplings before but thought it sounded interesting and I'm glad I gave them a try because they're delicious - such a great refreshing dessert!

Just a note,  the dumplings are served with a brown sugar, butter sauce, thickened slightly with bread crumbs.  They are not crisp at all and they do look sort of like flying saucers, fat in the center, with flat edges around the circle...and don't skimp on the sauce over the dumplings when you serve!   Also...roll the dough to about 1/8 inch in thickness Cyndi K.

I love these dumplings.  A family friend used to make this when I was young and I can't pass a prune plum without thinking those dumplings she used to make. I'm so glad that I found this recipe so that I can now make these for my own family.

These had GREAT flavor, but I'm convinced I did something wrong. The picture shows them almost crusty looking on the outside, and really round.  Mine were flat like flying saucers, and while they tasted good they did not have a crispy outside.  Any tips?

my mom made these dumplings while we were visiting them in B.C.  they were amazing!!  i will forsure make these!  one thing my mom did differently was to roll the dough out thinner-1/4 inch dough would have been too thick.

Mmmmmhnum!!!  I have red plums from the neighbors tree and had already made so much plum muffins and bread thought I'd try this.  My Hubby is from Germany and said they have something similiar but serve with warm vanilla sauce which I happened to come upon at IKEA sooo thats how we had them.  Yes, there work and I think my dough was a little thick but they are very good and my hubby says its a keeper. The only thing I will do differently is put a little more sugar in the plum a sugar cube would work because they can be a bit tart and also with red plums you dont get as many.

This dough was the toughest, most untender dough I have ever made in my life! I'd made this recipe a couple of years ago( the last time my plum tree was loaded with fruit) and despite the fact that the dough was tough, my family loved the plummy  juice interior. So, I decided to make them again this year. Well,,, after kneading the dough for close to an hour and still having a tough crumbling mess on my hands, I threw it out and found another recipe that used far more potato and much less flour. I had great success with the different dough. I also dont use the bread crumbs, instead I saute the butter and brown sugar and then add a good splash of liquor - slivovitz, kirsh, baileys or kahlua all work great.

I am addicted to these ever since I tried Linda's plum dumplings on this site. I liked Linda's recipe a little bit better, thanks for letting me try a different recipe for this German/Austrian classic dessert. Didn't add the sauce to these, just sprinkled with pwrd sugar and crushed honey pretzels.

The only thing I did differently was to make the sugar mixture a bit more interesting.   I used some white sugar, but mostly brown sugar, and cinnamon and fresh-grated nutmeg and seasoned to my taste preferences.   Some plums got a double dose of the sugar&spice mixture; by the time they were ready to get wrapped, they'd juiced up so some of the mixture had run out and I topped it up again (oh, the horror!).   And that is the only thing I changed. The pastry worked out and despite some misgivings at when I first started mixing the ingredients together, the texture actually turned out perfectly.   The next time I make this, it'll be with a couple of friends, or something. It's time-consuming and a fair bit of work, but oh man, so delicious.

Growing up we looked forward to plum dumplings in the fall.  I found Italian plums at the market and wanted to make them.  I couldn't find my moms recipe, but found one where the dough was made with farina instead of potatoes, and turned out just like mom's.  This saves some prep time.  Also we didn't pit the plums, which also saves time.  Maybe they should be tested for tartness first though.  I was looking for a recipe to tell me how to freeze them.  Thanks I hope this works.

This is the exact recipe my grandmother had and did not pass down when she passed on ten years ago.  I have been craving it ever since.  I tried them last weekend and it was exactly as I remembered. These are one of my father's faves as well and I surprised him with them and he loved them.  Not so much with the brown sugar.  We just don't use that and use the butter and bread crumbs.  Thanks so much for the person who posted this!! :D

The taste wasn't bad, and I don't know if I just messed it up, but the dough was not nearly enough to cover all the plums. I could only make 6 dumplings, instead of the 25 that it called for.

This is so amazing it convinced me to finally sign up to this site, mostly just to say how amazing it was! :) i made some minor changes and a mistake somewhere- i used only half of everything (i was just looking for something to use the plums my gran couldnt finish, jst a few) so, instead of using 1andahalf egg yolks, i used 2; added a little vanilla sugar to the flour mix and a half tsp lemonjuice to the sugar in each plum; for some reason the dough behaved more like crumble so i added a little milk and eggwhite and it was all good.  we usually just make these from frozen, here in vienna, but its expensive, they're experts here, and i didnt think theyd be as good but they were, and better!! :D

Definitely a dessert - not a main or side dish. These were OK, but I'll stick to crisps and cobblers in the future. The texture was a bit weird and I definitely was craving some ice cream on the side.

This is an excellent recipe. I ended up using more potatoes to get the right consistency of dough, closer to two cups. I folded one circle over, like a perogy, rather than using two - mostly to get more dumplings. I also boiled and then pan fried, which made them way better!

My mom used to make these. Loved them. Once they were s little fried in the pan on to the plate they would go with s little cream. My dessert. It was one of those little things that I didn't get a chance to ask my mom before she passed away. No one else could remember how they were made. Thank you. Fond memories...

I make a few changes; brown sugar, cream cheese for the filling, added vanilla to the dough and brandy to the sauce and omitted the bread crumbs.  To top it off I deep fried them and served them with ice cream and they were amazing! 
 I'm the total package, looks and can
bake!

Wonderful - it's also a hungarian favorite.   My Grandmother always said,"old potatoes" are the best for this recipe.   I had to use canned plums because plums were out of season.
