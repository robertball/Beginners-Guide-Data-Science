I'm not much on canned meat so I put boneless chicken breasts (5) in the crock pot with chicken broth for 9 hours on low while I was at work.  When I got home I removed chicken from crock pot, shredded and then followed recipe minus chili powder.  My kids don't like spicy food so the Fiesta Nacho Cheese sauce was spicy enough for us.  I did use 2 cans of cheese add 1/2 can of milk for the consistency we like.  It's not gourmet, but it was quick, easy and tasty!

My husband loved it and he is a picky eater! It was so easy to fix and with a little sour cream, cilantro, and some homemade salsa it is amazing! I will make this a regular for taco night!

Liked this a lot.  Couldn't find Fiesta Nacho Cheese Soup so had to add minced dehydrated onion, the chili powder, a 4 oz. can of green chilies and a couple of spoonsful of salsa to Cheddar Cheese soup.  Toasting the taco shells made a world of difference, too.  Used shredded chicken poached in broth.

I came so close to just re-writing this recipe and posting it on this site instead of reviewing this one since I made so many changes but I decided to give it it it's due. I gave it 5 stars so people would not discount this one as with the changes it was soooo good! I bought a rotisserie chicken and shredded that instead of using the canned chicken. Almost as easy as popping a can and so much better tasting. I sauted the onion in the oil and then tossed in the chicken. I sprinkled a little salt, pepper and garlic powder over it (no chili powder). Then I added the soup and a small container of sour cream and it was amazing! It tasted like a dish you would get in a mexican food place. Took about 15 minutes for the whole thing and so yummy!

Yum! I used what I had on hand, which was Velveeta, salsa & green chiles. We really liked this! Even my picky 7 year old loved it. Of course, with Velveeta it thickened up a bit, but it was still good. My husband even suggested using it as a nacho topping.

I like these tacos much better than regular tacos.  I made a few changes to the recipe....  
Since I cook for a large family, it was cheaper for me to buy a block of Velveeta than a bunch of cans of cheese so I melted the Velveeta with a can of Rotel tomatoes.  I'm not a fan of canned chicken so I used grilled diced chicken from the frozen food section.  I broke down the chicken into smaller chunks as I sauted it in the oil with the onions and chili powder.  
We ate them with whole grain taco shells.  A YUMMY QUICK MEAL!

I made this as written and tasted it and it tasted like can cheese and nothing else. So I added some sour cream, cumin, jalpenos, and some garlic salt. This add some flavor to the meat mixture. Not sure I would make this again.

Not into the canned meat, but I did use a some leftover Rotisserie Chicken, which was a great , I cooked the onions, added the chicken with Cayenne Pepper, Paprika, and chili powder, then added the Campbells Fiesta Nacho, with half  cup diced tomatoes. It was FABULOUS!! I also deep fried my flour tortillas to make a crunchy taco shells, which I know is more calories, but it was utterly delicious and the Hubby LOVED it!! Enjoy

I made this for dinner and it came out great. I didn't use the canned chicken, instead I cut up and cooked chicken breast and I added re-fried beans when putting the taco together.

Made as is, it just tastes like canned cheese soup.  I added a can of enchilada sauce, fresh cilantro and some cumin just to make it passable.  Even then, my children and husband asked me NOT to make it again!
