Wonderful recipe. Only used half pound sausage, which was more then enough. Also, added a bit of finely diced onion and 4-5 drops of hot sauce. Needed two 9" pie crusts or one 10" deep dish pie crust. I've since made this twice and the second time I pre-baked the crust for 10-15 min. The crust came out more flaky with out a soggy bottom.

This was good.  I followed the directions completely.  Next time I make it I will cut down on the sausage and add more eggs.  It was more like a sausage pie than a quiche.  I used a deep dish crust which was good because it was filled to the top.

The Recipe exceeded my expectations! I was looking for something easy to make for breakfast for a group of friends when I came accross this recipe. I had never made a quiche before but I gave it a shot. Everyone raved and said it was delicious. Even my friends 9 year old daughter who is a very pickey eater and didn't even want to try it thought it was great and came back for 2nds. I followed the recipe pretty closly except that I salted the egg mixture and added some Italian Seasoning. This is one that I'm sure I'll use again and again.

This was an excellent quiche!  I used fresh basil leaves instead of parsley and swiss cheese instead of parmesean.  I also found that I needed two deep dish pie crusts for all of the filling.  High in fat and cholesterol, so I won't make it often, but it is delicious.

Sooo good!  Made for a light dinner for mom and I.  Used turkey sausage (1 lb) and used half cream, half milk to reduce the fat.  All of the ingredients fit into one deep dish pie crust, not sure why some reviewers had problems with this.  I also prebaked my pie crust for ten minutes, sprinkled a handful of cheddar cheese on the bottom and poured the rest of the mixture in.  Very good.

This was just okay. I did add some dry onion flakes to the eggs and used 12oz evaporated milk instead of half & half. Also - I added some chopped broccoli to the quiche. I used a deep dish pie crust and it JUST BARELY fit it all. Also - I had to bake much longer than stated in the recipe. Not bad - but my tastebuds aren't sure if they'll crave this one again. Thanks anyways!

Delicious and easy to make!  Just being two of us we had it for dinner one nite and breakfast the next two days.  It tastes just as good heated up in the oven (if not better!)  Very filling with all the mushrooms and sausage.  I didn't change a thing.  Thanks Val!

A very good quiche lots of flavor for such few ingredients. It was easy to get done when I got home from work and the family enjoyed it very much.

Yum. I had portobello mushrooms on hand which made this even better! Other than that I made pretty much as stated; watching my diet so only had fat-free half and half.

This is a delicious and creamy quiche. I did not use sausage but did use 4 eggs because it looked too thin with just 4. And it is wonderful for breakfast and dinner. It is very fattening, however, so next time I will try using milk instead of half and half.

This was very tasty. I sauteed my mushrooms with garlic and added spinach. Also, instead of breakfast sausages I used Sweet Italian sausages. I will make this again...

This was really good and we will make again for sure. It is not all that "eggy" but that was perfect for us. The only change was I used 1/4 cup of dried parsley instead of fresh.

A very good recipe, but I did make a few changes.  First off, if you only plan on baking one quiche, cut all of the ingredients in half!  I also added a mix of chopped fresh parsley and fresh basil to mine, and put it in a mashed potato crust.  I kept the eggs at 3, just because I wanted it to be more "eggy" and I also doubled the cheese, for which I used Swiss.  Finally, I used pan-fried veggie sausage (GimmeLean brand) instead of pork sausage and milk topped off with a little half and half.  This cuts down on the fat and cholesterol content.

I used only 1/2 lb of turkey sausage, and I used skim milk instead of half and half, and it came out really well.  I had to bake for about 45 mins.

Great recipe - I altered it to suit the tastes at our house. I added 1/2 package frozen spinach, thawed, drained and chopped. I cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, I used 6 eggs and used 1 cup of 1/2% milk instead of cream. I omitted the salt as the sausage was salty enough. This filled 2 deep dish pie crusts that I precooked for 10 minutes as other suggested.  My family and guests loved it. Thanks for the original recipe Val.

It's a good base recipe but as other reviewers have mentioned, the proportions are a bit off. If you use 1/2 lb of sausage, it should be enough for 1 deep dish pie crust. You also need to bake the quiche for about 45 minutes.  I modified the recipe a bit: added spinach, mushrooms, and replaced the parmesan with sharp cheddar cheese. The cheddar made it even tastier.

I substituted spinach for the mushrooms, used 1/2 cup 2% milk and 1/2 cup whipping cream and asiago cheese. The end result was heaven in my mouth. Received rave reviews from the family!

I added a great deal more spices and it still needed more. I only used 1/2 the sausage and that was enough. I put in 6 eggs. I put a layer of shredded cheddar on the bottom. I will add some tobasco sauce to it next time.

Loved this recipe, but added onion and cheddar cheese, and omitted parmesan cheese since I didn't have any. Needed to cook it 35 minutes to make it cook all the way through.

This was super easy and everyone loved it. I cooked it for 45-50 minutes so it would be firmer.  I also cooked the sausage and mushrooms the night before to save time in the morning.

This was great!  One of the first times I made a quiche and *everything* fit in the pie shell beautifully.  The only changes I made were adding onions with the sausage and mushrooms and a 1-to-1 substitution of half & half for evaporated milk.  Thanks!

Made this for a shower and it was a huge hit! I used  lower-fat turkey sausage and milk to cut down on fat and calories, and it was still delicious. I would definitely recommeds using a deep dish pie crust, as not all the filling would fit into a regular-sized one.

Excellent recipe!!  I made one substitution because the sausage I was using had a very strong flavor--used a cheddar/mozzarella mix.  Sprinkled a little extra cheese in the bottom and the a little extra on top.  Also changed the name because my husband hates quiche.  HA! He had a Sausage Mushroom Pie!!

I just made this quiche for dinner tonight and it was fantastic! It was such a great change from a regular bacon quiche and so easy. I halved the amount of mushrooms and sausage, and to make it even easier I used a thawed box of breakfast sausage, but left everything else the same. It was delicious and easy.

Sorry Valerie, I made several changes. I used 1 cup of Broccoli florets, snipped very small, 1/4  onion, finely diced, 1/4 teasp. crushed garlic and only 1/2 pound of sausage, which is plenty.  I added 1/3 cup of half & Half plus one egg to fill out two (2) 9" regular pie crusts.  Left out the salt and used a little ground pepper for a little tang. Pre baked the pie shells for 12 minutes at 400 degrees and baked the two Quiches at 400 degrees for 40 minutes.  Your base recipe was a great start!!  Wonderful, quick Quiche!!

I didn't make this exact recipe. But I was looking for a good quiche recipe to make with what I had (and have never ventured into quiche territory)and so I tinkered and referenced this recipe with the recipe for the spinach mushroom Quiche. This really helped me create a quiche that met my personal needs. This was great to use as reference as well as all the comments and reviews. Clearly we can tell that making a quiche is not hard and that we can tinker with ingredients. The important part is the milk/egg/cheese ratio. I used 1/2 c of half and half, and 4 eggs, fresh broccoli and fresh spinach (steamed), fresh mushrooms and green onion fried with butter, garlic and dried onion. It was a veggie heavy filling delight with 2 cups of cheese, and a frozen pie shell. It's not the same recipe here at all, but I think as a reference to help me on the path is worthy of five stars.

I loved this recipe. I fit this recipe perfect into 1 Nine inch pie crust that was store bought. I preheated my pie crust for about 10 minutes or so first and then I mixed up the recipe and had 2 Nine Inch Quiche it was beautiful and tasted great..I am so keeping this recipe. Thanks!
I did follow the recipe just about exactly using the half and half, mushrooms in one of those blue boxes, sausage, a little garlic, salt and pepper and a not to much parsley. 
I personally thought this was a good recipe if it turns out bad perhaps there was a cooking error.

Very good...I also added onions, and green diced chiles, used a hickory bacon flavored sausage. I used a deep dish pie crust. First time making a quiche, and turned out great! Thanks for the recipe.

Used ground mild italian sausage rather than brekkie sausage; what a fantastic recipe!
Best I've had, even better the next day.

This was a BIG hit at Easter Brunch.  Instead of sausage, I used bacon.  Nearly a pound of bacon (you can't cook bacon with someone stealing a few slices...) and everything fit will.  In addition to the Parmesan cheese in the mixture, I sprinkled some on the bottom.  Due to other reviews, I pre-baked the crust for 10 minutes so it wasn't soggy.  Seemed to work well!

Delicious! I followed the recipe to a "t" and ended up with a bit extra (I couldn't find my deep dish pan), so I just made a couple of crustless mini quiches in muffin tins. My daughters loved the minis that were made just for them! Thanks.

I added more fresh mushrooms and also some asparagus cut into bite size piece, and cooked them in the pan with some ground turkey sausage.  It came out delicious and got rave reviews from the family!

Good recipe, tasty. Though next time I will probably reduce the amount of sausage and mushroom and look for another option aside from half-n-half.

This was a delicious quiche recipe.  I added some fresh spinach and think it made it a little too watery so next time I will follow the recipe exactly.  I will definitely be making this again.

BTW - this made 2 pies, not 1.

We loved this recipe. I added 3 more eggs, 1/2 cup swiss cheese and a dash or garlic powder.  It filled two 9 inch crusts. I cooked them at the same time at 400 degrees for 25 minutes. Yum!

Scrump-TIOUS!  I used link sausge (all I had on hand) and just chopped them up before adding in the mushrooms.  Also used regular milk (RAW) and farm fresh eggs.  Diced up red pepper very small and added it as well.  Very healthy dish to include the good fats your body NEEDS!  A+ dish!

One of the best tasting quiches I've ever had. Like fellow reviewers I did a few minor adjustments. I cooked the pie crust first for about 10 minutes so avoid it from getting soggy. I also cut about half of the sausage out. To make it have a little more color I added one cup of fresh spinach into the egg mixture. And lastly being a huge feta lover I cut out the parmesean and added one cup of feta. The results were amazing. I will definitely be making this quiche again.

I am not a fan of quiche but I made this one for a coworker's birthday and everyone, including myself, was blown away! Very good! I did use about half of the mushrooms and didn't precook the crust. Turned out great!!!

A great change on my usual quiches. I forgot to buy the parsley so added 2t of italian seasoning and added extra cheese. I can see how this would be a squeeze in a 9 inch crust. It fitted in my 10 inch quiche dish perfectly. Thanks for a great recipe Valerie.

My whole family liked this!  Good tips from others on using half the filling. I made a few other modifications as well.  I used a frozen pie crust and put 1/2 cup of shredded cheese in the bottom.  This will take care of the soggy crust issue.  I also added one more egg and cut cream in half.  Good recipe!

Very good recipe.  We made it with swiss cheese instead of parmesan, and added 2 small cloves of crushed garlic as our sausage was pretty mild.  Baking time was 35 minutes at 400 degrees.  Works well in a deep dish pie pan.  Be sure to use fresh parsley if you can, it really added a lot to the appearance and the flavor.

This was my 1st quiche as well and it came out pretty good. I followed the tips from other reviewers and pre-baked my crust for about 10min & added garlic & onions to the sausage which boosted the flavor tremendously. Also extra cheese didn't hurt (I love cheese) Nice breakfast quiche, easy to make and mine cooked in less than 20min.

I thought this was gross. The flavor of the parsley was overpowering. The flavor of the cheese didn't mix with the other flavors. Neither my husband nor I liked it.

I made changes but only because I couldn't wait to make this but did not have all the ingredients.  Changes:
Sweet Italian sausage in place of the suggested sausage plus added some caramelized onions, a small yellow bell pepper  and a 1/4 t. nutmeg (what's a quiche without nutmeg?).  I was out of Parmesan so used Dubliner and added some fresh spinach. Yum!  This with a salad was a wonderful dinner and there are left overs for breakfast.  Must go to bed so I can get up and have some more.  I need to plan better and make it as suggested next time but this is a wonderful recipe to play with.  Thanks much!

This has a very good taste, but it's more of a meat pie than a quiche.  There is so much meat and very little egg.  Also, it would be helpful if they specified that a deep dish pie crust was needed.  Luckily I had one because this recipe would yeild two pies in a regular crust.  I will be trying a different recipe next time.

I was looking for a basic quihe recipe that I could "change" up as needed.  This is it!!! Kept basic measurements the same but used sauteed muchrooms and shallots and gryere cheese.  I made these for Easter brunch and they were delicious.  thanks (looked just like the picture)

Very simple to make, and very tasty.  I used turkey sausage, and low fat Italian  blended cheeses.  AWESOME!  Everyone loved it for a Christmas morning breakfast.

This was wonderful! I did substitute low fat sour cream in place of half and half and it was absolutely mouthwatering. I've made this recipe at least 3 times now.

This had a really great flavor. I used soy creamer instead of half & half.  I also used chicken sausage, baby bella mushrooms,dried parsley,a whole wheat frozen pie crust, and 2% mozzerella cheese. I sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil and garlic powder before putting them in the egg mixture. Next time I will bake the crust first as some suggested. That should probably be done with all quiches to prevent sogginess.

This was my first time to make a quiche. This recipe is AMAZING!! I followed some others suggestions. I pre-baked my pie crust for 10 minutes, I added a half a cup of cheese to the bottom of the pie shell, I added one additional egg, and I used swiss cheese. I was able to get all of the mixture into a deep dish pie crust...barely. My boyfriend and I ate this for dinner (I put some hot sauce on mine before eating) -- he even went back for seconds. Thanks for the awesome recipe.

(I made this a while ago and forgot to rate it so my memory is not real fresh, sorry) This was good. I used spicy ground sausage in mine and cut my mushrooms in thick slices. I made this for another family and got lots of compliments on it and a request for another. Thanks!

My family loved this.  I used spinach instead of parsly.  I also added garlic and onions to the sausage and mushrooms.  I used a 5 cheese itallian blend instead of the parm. I found it easier if you layer the egg, cheese, and sausage/mushroom mixture and it came out wonderful.

I took this quiche to work and everyone loved it.  I added onions and used 1/4 cup parmesan and 1/4 cup monterrey jack.  Also I had to cook it for about 10 to 15 minutes longer than the directions called for.

Well, I used this recipe as a springboard for ingredients I had on hand.  Instead of the mushrooms, I used chopped green peppers and onions.  Instead of salt, I used ground mustard. Also, instead of half and half, I used skim milk.  I did have a bit too much filling for the pie crust.  So next time, I may reduce the amount of milk.  It was a great, easy recipe.

Very very good! The only thing I changed was the sausage. I used reduced fat pork sausage. I personally think you don't need to add the 1/4 tsp. of salt becuase the sausage gives it enough salt flavor. Also I think I may use a deep dish crust next time because it was too full with just the regular crust.

This was a great quiche ... and easy. I used bratwurst sausage because I had it on-hand but other than that, followed the recipe as written.  The best test of whether a dish is 5-stars versus 4-stars or less (in my opionion) is if one has  leftovers ... don't expect to have any with this recipe.  It's definitely a keeper.

We really enjoyed this recipe Val. I had no pie crust in the house, so I subbed with leftover Stove Top stuffing. I used five eggs and a combo of cheeses. Because I needed to get rid of some onions and green pepper, I threw that in too. I loved the breakfast sausage/mushroom combo and so did my family. Thank you!

I made this for a ladies brunch at my church this weekend and it was a big hit! Everyone wanted the recipe! The only modification I made was due to time restraints, when the sausage was browned there was still quite a bit of liquid left in the pan from the mushrooms so I drained the liquid and returned the sausage and mushroom mixture to the pan to finish browning everything. It really turned out great, and I added minced garlic to the pan.

This was my first time making quiche (which is crazy because I looovvve quiche).  I added onion to Jimmy Deans hot sausage (and drained the excess fat off) and also put in spinach and some New Mexico green chili. Yummy!  Also, prebaked the pie crust for about 8 minutes and added some cheddar cheese to the bottom of the pan as others suggested.  Brought this to a Christmas brunch and it was gobbled up! Oh yeah, it is a lot of sausage to use, but I just added a few extra eggs and half and half and used to pie crusts. Problem solved!

Tasted great. I reduced the parsley by half and added 1/2 cup yellow onion. Next time I may add a 1/2 tsp of black pepper. Then it may get 5 stars.

Fantastic, While I preheated the oven I placed a 9" cast iron skillet in. Placed my pie crust in and added the filling. It looked a little sparse so I blended 3 more eggs and 1/2 cup milk ( I ran out of half and half). The crust came out nice and crispy.

Actually my husband made the quiche, but I found the recipe and shopped for the ingredients. I made a few adjustments, based on other people's reviews. I used a half pound of "Italian seasoned ground sausage," and that was definitely enough meat! The grocery store didn't have a package of button mushrooms, so I bought a 10 oz. package of sliced mushrooms. My husband did not even use the entire package. I bought a squeeze tube of parsley, because I didn't want to buy a whole bunch of parsley and deal with washing and chopping it (when I thought *I* would be making the quiche).  And my husband used both pie crusts, but he just doubled them up on the bottom of the pie plate. Oh, he also said he added one more egg, because it just "looked like it needed it."
   Whatever my husband did, this quiche was phenomenal! Seriously the best I have ever had, I think!! We will definitely make this recipe again, can't wait to try it with different fillings!

Fantastic recipe. I just used normal milk to make it lighter, and it was still good and rich. As the other reviews have advised, I cut the amount of sausage in half, and there was still plenty per serving. I didnt have any parsley so I put some chives in. Next time I will try putting in some kale from my garden to put a little more nutrients in.

This was very good. I only used half of the sausage / mushroom mixture as it looked like too much for one pie shell, but that was OK because we used it for breakfast burritos later in the week. It was a little runny in the center so we baked for 10 more minutes, but I think if we had let it set for maybe 15-20 minutes, it would have been fine. Overall, a great quiche that we will make again.

Delicious! I added onion when frying the sausage and used turkey sausage to lighten it up a bit! I also used 5 eggs.  I've also made it crustless, which is also great because of the heartiness of the sausage.

Great! Second time around I used a little less sausage. I also set the crust by baking it for 5 minutes on 450. This way, the filling didn't make the crust as soggy. The parsley was my favorite part!

A very good quiche that I will make again. I use frozen 9 inch pie crust shells that are only one and a half inches deep. The recipe must be for a deeper pie dish since it makes far too much filling for my shallow shell. My solution is to use only 1/2 pound of both sausage and mushrooms but follow the rest of the recipe as given.

Super Yummy!  Used 8 eggs, cup and a half of milk, added some chopped spinach and baby kale along with 1/4 cup dried parsley.  Topped with freshly grated parm before baking.  Yielded two pies!  One for the freezer :)

This is an Excellent quiche! I have made many in the past and will keep this as my go to recipe. I used 6 eggs as I wanted the crust filled to the top and it baked to perfection in 35 minutes.
I added 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar and omitted the salt, used Neese's brand Hot sausage and baby portabello mushrooms. YUM!!!

I have never cared for quiche because the only ones I ever ate were awful.  This one is excellent!  I did add a finely chopped sweet red pepper, mostly for color, and about 1/4 tsp of freeze dried onion.  Since I didn't have any half/half handy, I used low fat milk but added 2 tbl of powdered whole milk to it.  I used a 9.5" deep dish pie plate with a 10" crust....I could have added more egg and milk to fill the crust... but not neccesary.
I will definitely make this again.

This was amazing.  My husband hates Quiche - he had 3 servings.  Do I need to say more?  I do suggest not to follow all of the suggestions.  I used Jimmy Dean's hot sausage and cheddar cheese.  "Our taste preference".  I really think if you followed this recipe to the letter you would not be disappointed.  You may want to use a deep dish but it is not enough to make two pies!  I tried - big mistake...

I cut the sausage by about a fourth  and doubled the amount of eggs,  Instead of parsley, I added spinach and lots of it and instead of Parm I used Cheddar.  No crust either.  YUMMY!

I added fresh spinach in addition to the parsley. Next time I will use 1/2 a pound of sausage rather than a full pound. Otherwise it's a very good quiche. Just felt there was way  too much sausage.

I have made this recipe several times. I altered the recipe by using 1/2 package Jimmy Dean sage pork sausage. I cooked the sausage and blotted any grease using paper towels.  I added onion powder, garlic powder and cumin to give it more flavor. Also added fresh ground pepper and omitted the salt. I used a combination of cheeses; some parmesan, some pecorino romano mad some cheddar. I used 4 eggs and a cup of half and half. One 9" deep dish pie crust prebaked for 10 minutes at 400 degrees prevented the soggy crust. Bake time should be increased to 40 - 45 minutes.  Thanks for a great starter recipe.

If you are looking for an AM flavor explosion, this is it. The sausage, mushrooms and cheese together make for a very rich dish. Good flavor and very filling. Kept for 3-4 days for me and warmed up nicely in the microwave. Make it on a Sunday morning for two and you'll have breakfast thru Tuesday.

Quick and easy. The parmesan cheese was not "sticky" enough so this quiche fell apart when being served.  It was delicious, but next time I would add some swiss or provolone to help it firm up a little.  No one minded the pile of quiche on the plate as it tasted so good, but if I had company over, I would have been disappointed. I did use portobello mushrooms as that was what I had in the fridge.  The 50 minutes is generous- only took me 40, so if you are in a hurry, this is the dish for you.

I made this twice, I use 3 eggs and a can of evaporated milk instead of half n half because I have it on hand. 
I didn't use meat because I didn't have any. Used cheddar and frozen spinach with a small sauted onion. I also added a sprinkle of nutmeg. Always comes out very good for a quick meal or breakfast.

This was truly wonderful and heralded by all who ate it. I used half and half and regular milk to give it a richer texture. I also feel you could use any cheese.

This was very good.  I did have to substitute a few things.  Used a mild venison sausage, used whole milk instead of half & half as that's what I had.  I also added about 1/4 cup of thawed spinach.  I didn't have a pie shell, so I used texas butter flavored biscuits to make the crust.  It turned out very well.

I thought this was very good.  I followed the recipe pretty closely and only made a few changes.  I only used half the sausage after reading other reviews, and I diced up a small onion and sauteed it with the mushrooms in olive oil, separately from the sausage.  After that, I followed the recipe to a T and it came out deliciously!

It was okay. This seemed more of a meat pie than a Quiche. Too much meat, and that's about all I was able to taste. Maybe half the meat and more eggs next time.

Bland bland bland.  Have to load up with hot sauce or some other flavour.  Oh, I didn't use the full pound of sausage and mushrooms yet I still needed 2 9" pie crusts.  Definitely not a 1 crust recipe.  Won't be making this again.

Great beginning recipe, but I found it to be a little bland.  Easy to pep up with additional veggies and subbing out the sausage for other breakfast meats.

OK. I made this twice and although it is good I don't consider it good enough to make again.

This is very goood.  However, I do think there is way too much sausage in this recipe. Even with only using half the sausage, I think I will save this recipe for splurges only.  Very good and quick to make.

My family loved this.  I only used 1/2 lb mushrooms because thats all I had.  I also added 1 more egg and used only 1/2 cup 1/2 & 1/2.  I cooked for 35-40 minutes.  (I also precooked the shell for about 5 minutes, before adding the ingredients.  Will make again for a breakfast casserole.

Very good recipe.  Instead of ground sausage I used leftover maple sausage links I had cooked up a couple days ago, I just chopped them up.  I also added onions and green peppers and extra cheese.  Otherwise same recipe.  Yummy!  My husband loved it!

I made this yesterday for a birthday brunch and everyone liked it. I substituted the sausage with spicy turkey sausage. I also used shredded colby/jack cheese instead of parmesan because I like this kind of cheese better.  Sorry to have tweaked the recipe a little bit, but it provided a very good starting point and the texture of the quiche was very good. I took the advice of other reviewers and baked pie shell for 5 minutes, also I added the shredded cheese to bottom of pie shell before putting in the quiche mixture.  It baked in about 36-40 minutes and I didn't have a problem with the edges of pie dough being to dark.

I thought this was pretty good, but nobody else did. I used vegetarian hot dogs, and sauteed one onion and two cloves of garlic to the skillet. That really adds a lot. I'd also recommend adding some black pepper and basil. This isn't bad, just nothing special.

So good!  I added extra cheese (Mexican blend) and extra mushroom, which make it more filling!

This quiche was okay, I think the ingredients would be better just as a breakfast casserole rather than a quiche. My crust was kind of soggy and kind of greasy, and I did prebake my crust and drain the meat before I baked it. Over all good ingredients but not as a quiche.

Very, very good, my work loved it and others have made it since after getting the recipe. It took mine a little longer to bake than stated here though.

Excellent! This is the first time I have made quiche and it turned out great. The only thing I did differently was use turkey sausage and I added some chopped onions. I'm definately using this recipe agian.

This was my first Quiche and it was a big hit in my family of four. We had it for dinner and there is plenty left for breakfast. It was very easy and was great to eat. Thanks.

I like it! It was my first quiche and very easy. The recipe is a bit bland as-is, so I added fresh garlic, green onions and some spices (pepper, cumin, cilantro, paprika). Like the other reviewer, I needed to bake it longer than stated in the recipe, about 40 minutes.
