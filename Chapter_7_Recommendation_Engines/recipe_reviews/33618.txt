AMAZING! My variations: 3 tablespoons powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons raspberry jam. Also used strawberry jam (or preserves) and apricot (YUM!). Everyone who has tried it raves about it. My favorite way to use this is on fresh baked bread or rolls.

I need to use up some strawberries and used this, plus a dash of cinnamon and freshly chopped strawberries.  It was like a fresh jam toast, very good and easy.  It didn't keep well with the fresh strawberries, so just make what you need.

AWESOME! I loved this! I added more preserves and a whole quart of fresh strawberries to give it a very natural taste. It was so delicious and I had numerous people asking for the recipe. Thanks!!

This was pretty good. I ate mine on a biscuit and it was just like eating the biscuit with butter and jelly except easier to put on since jelly is harder to spread. Same flavor as the traditional application of a pat of butter then topped with jelly, but easier this way. I used a little extra strawberry because I love strawberries.

Delicious! I put this on my toasted bagel, wow! I wish I had found this recipe sooner. Why didn't I think of this? I will use this as a topping on lots of different foods in the future. Thank you.

A little less sugar should be added and more preserves should be used! then the butter will have a nice strawberry flavor without being TOO sweet.

This tastes like a lightly strawberry flavored butter instead of a dessert like some other strawberry butters that have cream cheese in them. I didn't have strawberry preserves, but I had sweetened strawberries in the fridge. It is basically the same thing, so I ground them up. I did a 1/2 recipe to taste it, but it doesn't make much so I suggest actually doing the full recipe. I think this would be good on biscuits.

Perfect! Just what I was looking for. Used low-fat strawberry jam and it turned out great! We used it on scones, can't wait to try on waffles!

Make sure the butter is completely softened. Ensure that the preserves (and fresh strawberries, if you use them) are at room temperature. Very tasty.

I can't really describe how this is.  It tasted just like strawberry jam but lighter. I had it on top of crackers with strawberries.  Maybe I'll try it with pancakes next...

Excellent! I was so happy to find this simple recipe-thank you for sharing! I love this butter on engish muffins, bagels, toast and pancakes. I had gone to the Wisc. cheese store and they offered this spead in a small package for $3.99. You had to mix it up when you got home and had to add the butter!! What a rip!!! This was better. Would make again.

I was so exited to make this for my boys but this was way too sweet for us.  The texture was right when I followed the recipe but I wanted a stronger strawberry flavor, so added more preservatives and threw the texture way off.

Fantastic with fresh strawberries!  They last longer in the butter than they do fresh waiting to be eaten.  Awesome on the nooks & crannies of English muffins.  Definite 5 star!

I tried this just recently but I used a small handful of freeze died
strawberries which we keep on hand for camping or snacking,
I hydrated the berries (pieces) by spraying lightly until moistened but not wet, I added 2TBS of powered sugar and the softened butter.  We had it on waffles, there was only one problem.........it was very hard for the two of us not to eat it all in one sitting!

I made this, using strawberry preserves and 3 large fresh mashed strawberries.  I cut back on the confectioners sugar to 1/2 tsp, as we don't like excessive sweetness.  It was easy enough to make, but I expected the strawberry flavor to dominate.  The butter was the over-riding taste, however.  I will try again once before deciding whether to add to my lineup.  3/21/16:  My family quickly made it clear this is something to make again and again.  They like it with both fresh strawberries, and with the preserves.
