I was so excited about this one.  I love cranberry.  I love crisp.  The cranberries and "sauce" on the bottom are hard like cement and the "crisp" is kind of soggy.  I had my doubts about the amount of butter this recipe listed, but I do believe in following a recipe before I rate it, so I gave it a shot.  I was sorry.  It tastes alright, if you can chisel it from the pan and don't have anything against eating a lot of butter.

Made this per the recipe.  I would substitute one small Granny Smith apple -- peeled, cored, and diced -- for some of the cranberries. Just a bit too tart for me.

Not sure if I overcooked this but it came out black and bitter. I will try it without cornstarch next time and keep a better eye on it.
