Olive lovers delight!  I was looking for a "little something extra" to bring along to a small dinner party.  This looked very easy so I tried it without reading the reviews.  I was not very happy with their appearance - the parmesan is not very attractive when mixed with the oil as it sits on the black olives.  BUT, they tasted delicious and were a big hit once someone took the plunge and tried them.
I served them 2 ways -- as the recipe states and also with some added green olives, just for color.  I added extra large pimento stuffed green olives and garlic stuffed olives (store bought, from a jar).  I think this looked a bit more appetizing than the plain black olives, and appealed to those who were not black olive lovers.

These olives are so yummy, next time I will marinate them overnight instead of only an hour.

These were really good. Every night, except the evenings that the kids and I are at dance, hubby and I sit for our "cocktail hour" and chat while dinner is cooking. Drew loves to "pick" and he also loves olives, so I thought this would be a nice little treat. I chilled these overnight to enhance the flavors and we really loved them. So did the kids Jake and thanks!

My husband loves black olives so I thought I would make these for him as a treat.  He absolutely loved them.  I am not a black olive fan, so I didn't even try them. I will go by what he says... "5 stars"

My husband is a picky eater.  He as well as myself found this recipe to be delicious. We enjoy it at parties,etc. on french bread toasted and cut to cracker size.  If you do this the olives need to be sliced. Also very good with green olives.  Thanks for this recipe.

GOOD STUFF! I added about a Tbsp of basalmic vingear to mine and they were gone in minutes! Can't wait to try again and let it set overnight.

This is very tasty and super easy to make.  It goes great with an Italian style dinner.  I added this to my recipe collection.  I gave it 3 stars for a kid friendly rating, simply because my kids aren't big olive fans.  However, my 7 year old daughter did try it and seemed to think it was alright...which is a big concession on her part.

I've made this recipe 3 times in less than 2 full weeks. I am only limited by the number of cans of black olives I buy each trip to the grocery. I didn't notice that the photo had the olives chopped, and so I left mine whole. The first two times I made this recipe, it never  made it as far as marination; I just ate them all immediately. The third time I made them at a friend's house to avoid instant consumption and went back to eat them the next day but he never got even one.  I tweaked the ingredients only by adding more of the cheese/olive oil paste. I think I like them better more toward room temperature as they are looser, and I like the individual flavors better before they meld. (Just sayin') Then again, with olives, garlic and  parmesan, what's not to like? This recipe's definitely a keeper. And-- may I please be invited to the house where the people each only ate one?

I doubled this recipe for a recent beach party and they were gone in no time.  Didn't have any parmesan cheese to grate, so I used romano.  Very good.  I let this sit overnite.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe. Maybe because I used pre-grated parmesan cheese. I might try this again with fresh parm.

I tried this recipe for a family gathering and everyone loved it. We did add some olive juice because we felt it needed a little more than just olive oil ..... I'd make this again.

I have a very similar recipe, with a few differences but oh so close. It was a recipe given to me from a Italian Family that brought their recipe from Italy with them that had been passed down for generations.
It is triple this recipe with 3 different ingredients. Put in a Quart jar refridgerate (roll 4 times a day for 2 days) The Romano Cheese & Garlic will be like you stuffed each olive.   
I did not try this recipe but gave it a 5 star rating, I just wanted to let you try it in the jar and refridgerated for 2 days.. If you like this now try it after it has soaked in.. YOU MUST LOVE GARLIC

I really liked this recipe, the family thought it was ok but they aren't olive lovers.  It was really great the next day.  It had such a great flavor after sitting over night I had to chop it all up finely and eat it over little crostinis I made from of a loaf of french bread I had on hand.  It was soooo good.

I served this as an appetizer before Christmas dinner. Apart from using 1/2 black and 1/2 green olives, I followed the recipe exactly, and the result was great. Easy and tasty! Will make again.

This was very good.  I added a small amount of onion(very small for an onion lover) and it gave it a really good onion flavor.  My wife liked the one with the onion better than the one with just garlic.  Both were very good.

YUM!!  I tripled the receipe - I used jumbo olives - and let it marinate overnight (that is the key!)  Let it come to room temp before serving - my guest LOVED them - but you have to like garlic - these were great - Will surely make them again and again!  THANKS!

I let the olives sit in the mixture overnight in the fridge and I felt like the cheese got a little chunky. Also, the olive oil flavor was a little too noticable for me.

I actually hate olives, but I made these for my mom who's a big olive fan and she loved them. (For all I can say, they smelled really good.) My mom gives it 4 stars because even though they're really good, they're not something you can eat a whole lot of in one sitting.

We thought they were okay...they'd be MUCH better ontop of a salad or thrown into something else.  They just seemed a little bland by themselves.

I agree that they don't look like the most appetizing things, but they taste great!  I used a Parmesan/Romano/Asiago Cheese, because it is all I had, and I chilled overnight.  They were yummy, would be good in a salad.  Thanks for sharing!

made as an hor d'vour (spelling??) for a dinner party and everyone just LOVED them!  people are reluctant to try them because of the way they look, so i would stick one on a toothpick and say "tell me what you think of this" and the rest is history.  :-)

Great little recipe!  I was afraid that no one at a recent party would try them because they didn't look that great.  My sister-in-law started the chain reaction by saying how great they were, and they were GONE!  Easy and simple -- I followed the recipe to a "T".

This is a nice treatment - makes ordinary black olives as interesting as kalamatas.

So far I have made these three times and they have never lasted longer than a day.  My son would be only too happy for me to make a container just for him.  Personally, I don't even eat olives but family rates them a 5

This was a simple way to dress up some olives.  Made it for a get together and they were a hit.  I quadrupled the recipe and they still went fast.

wow, this appetizer really packs a punch! the olives tasted good but i thought they lacked moisture & ended up drizzling on another tablespoon of olive oil before serving. thanks jake, there's no doubt us olive lovers will keep this recipe in our file!

Such a great recipe. I love bringing it to parties. Even with a double batch there are never any leftovers. I do usually let it set for more than an hour though so it can get really nice and marinated.

Simple and easy to make, but awesome results.
I had them before Italian food, as suggested - I snacked on these before having some tortellini. Highly recommended appetizer!

This really makes those bland canned black olives POP!  I was very surprised to find that canned olives are measured by their dry weight, so the 6 oz. can is what would normally be a 14-15 oz can.  Great for an appetizer, and awesome atop a salad.

Not too intense, even friends who normally do not eat olives enjoyed these. I used 3 kinds of olives and doubled the recipe for a birthday gathering. Turned out delicious!

These are wonderful.  I followed the recipe as written and they were a hit.  I will say that the longer they marinate, the better they taste.

My family was a bit skeptical at first when I placed these on the table but all it took was once bite.  For asthetics I thru in about 6 large pimento stuffed green olives but I personally loved the black ones best.  I made this recipe plus the extra green olives for a group of 7 and they were all gone.  If your planning on taking them to a gathering you might want to multiply the recipe.

These were good, but I thought they had way too much basil. I used half green and half black olives. They tasted exactly like olives taste on a pizza. Not sure I would make again.
