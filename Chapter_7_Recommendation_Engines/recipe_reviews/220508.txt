This was very tasty and pretty easy to make as well. I loved the blend of spices. As a carnivore, I decided to add chicken. With the chicken, it probably does not need as much edamame as the original recipe calls for (there was a lot of edamame!) Yum!!

I did make everything as per this recipe but I felt the curry was dry. So I added a cup of water, reduced the heat to low and added a spoonful of cream cheese. This turned out great!!

This turned out really really good!  I used zucchini instead of broccoli and peas instead of edamame, but that is just because it is what we had on hand.  A keeper!
