This is exactly the ambrosia recipe I was looking for! One caveat, however: if you're making this for a family or party, the idea that the recipe would "serve 10" seems preposterous to me. Maybe 10 little kids. Or 10 people who have a lot of other food choices and will only take little helpings of ambrosia. But not 10 people who, like me and my family, see a bowl full of ambrosia, get excited, and take great, healthy helpings of the stuff in anticipation of it being gone by the time they go back for seconds. For that lot, better make more. I wouldn't necessarily double the whole recipe, however. It's got plenty of mandarin oranges; maybe just double the fruit salad, put in 1 1/2 times the recommended marshmallows and coconut, and use 12-14 oz of sour cream instead of 8. (I don't do the nuts.) Adding some red grapes or pineapple chunks can also work.

Perfect ambrosia in my opinion!! There are many ways to make this - including those recipes that use cool whip instead of sour cream (too sweet for me) - but I made the right choice going with this one, it's just right.  I used Fat Free sour cream and enjoyed this as a healthy TREAT.

this salad was so easy and good! I was thrown off by the sour cream at first, but it works for this salad. My four year old loved picking out the marshmellow and nuts, then goobled down the rest.

I make myself a small batch of this a couple times a year just for the comfort that's there for me. My mom made this for almost every holiday when I was growing up. She used half sour cream, half whipped cream and she also added a couple chopped bananas. TIP: To keep your bananas from browning, toss the banana pieces in a little lemon juice before adding to the salad.

I absolutely love this recipe. I use 1 29 oz can of mandarin oranges, and 1 30 oz can of fruit cocktail instead of the smaller cans. I also use only 1 cup of coconut, a whole 16oz container of sour cream, and a little more marshmallows- prob. about 3 cups instead of 2. I have tried with walnuts and pecans, but prefer the walnuts.

I really enjoyed it.  I can't say the same for all of my guests, but maybe I served it at the wrong time of year.  I chose because it had ingredients that i really like.  Next time i'll serve it for a summer barbeque.

I have made this ambrosia twice now.  It is my favorite ambrosia recipe!  I use pecans instead of walnuts and light sour cream (personal preference). Unlike recipes using cool whip, this one tastes light and fresh and isn't overpowered with sweetness. Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe is amazing.  I served it for easter dinner and everyone loved it.  I added 1 can of chunk pinapple drained and a serving spoon of cool-whip, but would have been good without those things too.  Thanks!

This was okay but I prefer cool whip instead of sour cream (makes it tangy!) and forget the coconut or don't add too much of it!

Love this! I don't like mandarin oranges so I left those out and used the very cherry fruit cocktail. So happy I have left overs to eat up all for myself

There are many recipes for this dish but this one is just perfect! I like using the fruit cocktail instead of just pineapple and oranges.

TASTY!  I halved the recipe (which states 5 servings) but it could easily feed 8 people.  Only used 1/4 cup of coconut and 1/4 cup of finely chopped walnuts.  I had a half of banana which I sliced and added at the end so as not to turn brown. When I tasted the dressing it was a bit tart so I always add 1 teaspoon of white sugar.   Great summer dessert!

Very yummy! Easy to make. Try using 1 can of chunked pineapple in place of one of the fruit cocktail cans. Sweet salad but that's what ambrosia is all about!

I'm sorry this was an awful recipe. I made it for a baby shower and only one person ate it. After sitting in the frig for a short time it looked like bad (it was not appetizing looking at all).

My grandchildren loved the ambrosia, but without the walnuts.  We made it on a very hot humid day and it was a perfect compliment to grilled food.  It is a good recipe for the children to make and will become part of our vacation menu.

My only complaint was there wasn't more!  My family loved it.  The only thing we changed was put only half the can of fruit cocktail and subbed the other half with pineapple which we prefer.  it was quick and so easy to make

I made this in under 10 minutes because my MIL was going to drop by! I didn't have time to measure.....  so I just mixed in mandarin, pineapple chunks (instead of fruit cocktail), marshmallows, coconut and sour cream. These were the only ingredients I had, no time to chill, and she still loved it!

This was my first time eating or making ambrosia, and I loved it! This recipe was very easy to follow, and it tastes great. My boyfriend asked me to make him his own special batch!

Suddenly, I had a craving for this! Wow, super yummy! I omitted the coconut and nuts but added chopped apples, crushed pineapple, halved cherries!! Loved it even more when I omitted the fruit salad and just added chopped peaches and halved green grapes to the oranges, apples, cherries and pineapple! I also increased the amount of marshmallows and doubled the sour cream because there was so much more fruit I had added. Who knew that the marshmallows melt into the sour cream and make a yummy fluffy texture.
Oh, I'm going to be making this a lot!!
I have since made this several times and even used canned fruit salad and its still very yummy!

This is completely awesome!  was trying to avoid the whip topping versions for something that focused on fruit flavor rather than sugar.  Really REALLY good!

My Mama made this too while I was growing up. I leave out the walnuts but cut up marachino cherries for color to offset the orange and yellow. I have found that making it the night before allows the flavors to meld better than making it and serving it the same day. Everyone that has ever eaten it has no clue the dressing is sour cream, and they all want the recipe.

Made this for Easter dinner. Out of this world delicious! The difference is using sour cream instead cool whip. It was a big hit and for sure a "keeper." I did follow a few reviews and added some red grapes, few cherries, and few pineapple chunks for a more variety of fruit. Although I halved the recipe, I did still used a whole cup of sour cream (it wasn't too much). It was perfect! Thanks for this great recipe.

This recipe is so versatile! I used grapes cut in half, strawberries, mandarin oranges, banana, and chunks of pineapple- it was so delicious! It's a very forgiving recipe, and don't be weary of the sour cream. It turns out just right! Yum! :) It's not too sweet but just sweet enough.

Pretty good. Needs oranges doubled and I don't know what else...something just seems to be missing!  Make sure to get a "high quality" mix of fruit, as this dish obviously depends on it.

This recipe is amazing!! We make it every year for Thanksgiving and theres never any leftovers! One thing we do differently is add a box of pistachio pudding mix to it. It adds extra flavor and makes it even more delicious.

Quick easy recipe and delicious, even my 4 year old was helping.
Changes I made:
only added 1/2 the sour cream
added 4 ounces of frozen whipped cream(the tub kind)
only added a 7 ounce bag of coconut, I think 2 cups would be way too much.

yum, yum.

My grandma use to make ambrosia salad every holiday when I was younger. I used this recipe to help refresh my memory in making it. Very similar to my grandmother's ambrosia, however I did not add walnuts and I included a can of pineapples in the fruit mixture.

My wife's family loved it during this past holiday dinner.  The variation we did was to leave out the nuts and flaked coconut, and add in slices maraschino cherries.  No leftovers for the day.

This recipe was amazing!  It was fast and easy and delicious and CHEAP. I left out the nuts due to allergies, but everything else was really great.  I was not too sure about the sour cream ingredient, but it tasted so sweet that it seemed almost like whipped topping.  I used fat free sour cream to cut down on the calories.  I will be bringing Ambrosia Salad to all pot luck's I go to!

I would give this a 5 star rating but my family and I feel that there is a bit too much flaked coconut in it.  Next time I make it I will only be adding 1 cup of flaked coconut.  Other than that, it is DELICIOUS!!

Very good and esp. with the nuts! it gives it a crunchy texture to go with the sweetness of the marshmallows. Oh and it must be the rainbowed marshmallows cause it makes a big difference.

Possibly my first ambrosia with sour cream and I really liked that it balanced the sweetness of the fruit.  I used half the amount of coconut and it was plenty for our tastes.  Also, I added a half cup of cherries, halved, then garnished it with sliced strawberries and extra marshmallows.  My family asked for it to be made regularly.

I changed it up a little, no walnuts, 1 can fruit cocktail and then added a can of drained pineapples and some fresh green grapes. It was delicious! Make it a day in advance and it’s even more flavorful!

I've made this for many years, and remember my mom making it! The only changes I made were to omit the nuts (will have to try them in this) and substitute nonfat Greek yogurt for the sour cream (still creamy, but healthier and adds protein). I also like to add both pineapple chunks and crushed pineapple for a bit more texture. This always gets races every time I make it...my husband even eats the leftovers for breakfast!

I did not use coconut and switched sour cream for whipped cream. Just personal preference.

I didn't add any coconut due to kids having allergies, nor did I add walnuts. I added more mandarin oranges because I love their flavor!! Really was a hit.

Excellent recipe.  I eased back on the oranges (1 can) and added another can of fruit cocktail.  I also used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 cool whip and topped with cocoa powder.  Outstanding!  Drain the fruit really well and it will hold up for days!

The sour cream is the only way to go..the coconut provides all the sweetness necessary!! I like to add the nuts right before I serve it...they can get a little bitter. ...super good!!

I've been hoping to find a recipe for this for several years because it's so good.  Found recipe here and made it for a potluck group of about 25.  I used Cool Whip.  It was delicious, and it vanished quickly.  It was a huge success.  -- Spryte

I used half of the amount of coconut and replaced a can of fruit cocktail with a can of pineapples. I also left out the walnuts (preference). Great crowd pleasing dish, thanks.

this was a good recipe but I felt that it was missing something. The next time I make I think I will not put the nuts in and not as much coconut.

Minus the nuts this is exactly how my mom's tastes. (She's bad with giving out recipes---a bit of this...a dash of that...). Thank you so much...easy and delicious!!!
