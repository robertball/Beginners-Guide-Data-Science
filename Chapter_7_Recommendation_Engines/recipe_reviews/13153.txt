These turned out wonderful!  The only changes I made were to leave out the onion and I used 3/4 c milk instead of 3/4 c broth.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

This is comfort food at its finest! The flavor of these dumplings is amazing, which warranted my 4-star rating. However, I agree with other reviewers that the dough was super sticky. I could not roll out the dough, no matter how much extra flour I used. I ended up dropping the dough by pinched handfuls into the boiling broth. They turned out excellent and full of flavor! 
Hint: If you don't like extremely doughy/thick dumplings, you need to pinch off very small amounts of dough to drop into the broth.

I don't know if I did something wrong but these did not come out with any kind of consistency for rolling out, the batter was very sticky (as my 2-year-old described it, egg-gloppy.) So I dropped it in by spoonfuls. The dumplings did have a nice flavor, but they were pretty gummy  even at the point when they were as done as they were going to get. May try again, but I was a little disappointed in them tonight.

I think the term flat dumpling is somewhat misleading in this recipe. These really are flat heavy biscuits, not dumplings. 
For those who appreciate the heaviness and chewy texture, these are quite flavorful. Those looking for a nice traditional fluffy dumpling to have with their chicken, I suggest trying a different recipe

I agree that the term 'flat' is misleading, perhaps 'drop noodles' would suit most. My Grandaddy calls them Sinkers. :)  Anyhow, this is the same basic recipe I have used for years and was taught by my mother. Real old, real good!

These dumplings tasted good...but they were way too sticky to roll out.  I added a lot of extra flour, and even then I ended up just "pinching" them off and dropping them in the broth.

Different strokes for different folks! I LOVE these dumplings! I like my dumplings thick and heavy, I just don't care for dumplings that are like bread floating in broth.  For my hungry guys (2 teenage boys & 1 husband), I doubled this recipe, used milk instead of chicken broth (they were going to be cooked in chicken broth), used only 1 egg, 1/2 cup more flour, less parsley, and no onions.  I used the dough hook to mix the dry and wet ingredients, with the extra flour it wasn't sticky at all.  I built up some muscles kneading and rolling out but it was totally worth it- ended up with my perfect dumpling AND burned a few calories. I made sure to cut them small and added a few more minutes of cook time.  YUMMY!

These dumplings were amazing and so low in fat!  Instead of flat dumplings, I dropped them by very small spoonfuls into the pot bearing in mind that they are dense so keeping them small allows them to cook in the same timeframe.

I very seldom leave a review but I felt this deserved one.  This is by far the best dumplings I have ever made.  I have tried many other recipes and this one is the best!  The dumplings have an awesome flavor and consistency and they definitely made an excellent pot of chicken and dumplings.  They are meant to be rolled out flat but you will have to use a lot of flour for dusting the dough as you roll them out avoid having the dough stick to your roller. I then used a pizza cutter to cut them into squares rather then circles, I find that to be much easier.  Thank you so much for a recipe that my entire family loved so much. There were none leftover!!

Yum. Using a pizza cutter I sliced long strips about 1 1/2 inches wide and then cut them about 3 inches long to make wide, flat noodle shapes.  My husband, who was more of a dumpling-in stew- man, now perfers this recipe.  They were tender and plump and delicious.

These were delicious - I especially liked rolling them out.  I cut them in the shape of stars and my kids called them "starfish".

I just pulled these off the stove and they are fantastic.  Instead of chicken broth for the liquid I used skim milk.  Wonderful!

These are the best dumplings I have ever prepared.  Not at all tough.  The secret in that though, is keeping the dough somewhat sticky. The flavor is delightful. We love parsley and tiny pieces of onion.  They go into our mashed potatoes as well.  Thank you. Shelby

How disappointed I was with how this turned out. Had I of added some black coloring I could have used them as hokey pucks. The middles never cooked and the outter were sticky and hard.  Thankfully it was family at the dinner table...

I did not have any chicken broth so I substituted it with milk like someone else suggested. I also added oregano because I made an Italian dumpling meal. I ran out of pasta so dumplings work great as a fill-in! I did not have any problems rolling the dough. It formed perfectly.

I added chicken to this recipe. Mine also did not turn out flat. But i made dough balls the best i could and dropped them into the boiling broth. VERY yummy! :) nice to eat on a cold evening.

I've never tried dumplings before and after this recipe may never again. I happened to have extra chicken broth laying around that I needed to use. I stumbled upon this recipe, realized I had everything I needed in the Kitchen and set to work. First, there is no way to make them flat, I mean zero ways! It was bland, heavy, and the opposite of delicious. I even doubled the onion and added garlic. I'm not sure anything could save this recipe.

Quick and easy!  I was out of parsley and onion, but I'll try it like that next time.  This is good, basic recipe.  Dough was a bit sticky at first but nothing a few more sprinkles of flour didn't fix.  Like most recipes for any kind of dough, the flour needs to be adjusted a little each time.  Thanks!

Looked at a couple other recipes on here and decided on this one because I didn't want a biscuit type. These lived up to my expectations. I am done shopping for a dumpling. 
I read where some had trouble rolling these out. I had no problem, just floured my area and my pin until all was okay. Turned out great. I made my own broth from cooking an entire chicken with celery stalks and carrots. Then strained the fat off the top, but retained it. Cooked the dumpling in the broth. On the side I sauteed fresh carrot (1), celery (2), onion (1/2), 2 cloves garlic with the chicken fat and a little butter.
When the dumplings were just about done, I added the veggies, shredded chicken, parsley, thyme, salt, garlic powder and heated through. I rated it a 10 and and 11 as a left over. Several people remarked how good and how good the house smelled.  
These are awesome, assuming you dont want dumplings that are airy and light like bread, a floating biscuit.

I used this recipe to make dumplings for the first time ever and they were delicious! Very easy to make and the perfect consistency. I followed another review and just dropped them by the spoonful and they came out perfect. I would make them again the exact same way, but my husband requested that next time I leave the onion out(although he liked them this way, too). Thanks for the recipe!

I have no idea what other people made, but I followed this recipe to the letter and there was no way to roll them out.  It came out a lot more like spaetzel.  Someone should look at this recipe again since there is obviously something wrong with the proportions.

This recipe was better than my grandma's!  They were so easy to roll.  I cut them with a pizza cutter.

We liked these.  They're not quite as heavy as the flat dumplings, but are tastier than the big fluffy ones.  I also gave up on rolling and cutting the dough.  Dropping by spoonfuls worked well.  No chicken fat, butter,
or shortening is called for which is a plus.

Quick, easy, and not sticky for me. I mix the dry together in a medium bowl and the wet together in my liquid measuring cup. Add wet to dry slowly. Mix until just combined. Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead only a few turns. The more you work the dough the tougher the dumpling will be. I couldn't find my biscuit cutters so I used a star cookie cutter. Best "chicken & stars" EVER!

Never had dumplings before and was searching for something I could make with ingredients I had on hand. I thought they were pretty good. The only thing I omitted was the onion but will definitely make again.

Really good and easy. I used my dough hook on my kitchenaid and dropped small amounts of dough into my stew. My kids and hubby all asked for more.
