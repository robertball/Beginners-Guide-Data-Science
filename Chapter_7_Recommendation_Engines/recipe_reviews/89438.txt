This was very good and very easy. It adds a nice tang to plain green beans, but might clash with a flavorful main dish. Stir the beans before serving as the sauce does not cling to the beans. And use fresh beans whenever possible! Be forewarned, they smell like dirty socks when you're cooking them.

Instead of honey mustard, we used a grainy Dijon mustart...It seems to add to the texture

I didn't have the problem with the sauce not sticking to the beans. It is a bit overpowering though. Served with soy/garlic marinated chops. Thought it would complement them, but the flavor of the beans just took over. They are flavorful though, and will try to find something to better serve them with.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I needed something creative to make and based on your recipe I made a great main dish with what I had. I used a canned ham, bag of frozen green beans, the red wine vinegar, regular yellow mustard and lots of pepper. Did not add any salt since the canned ham is super salty. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Good way to add some taste to regular green beans.  Boys liked it.  I used fresh green beans and boiled them for about 10 min before (so they weren't so hard).

These were a huge hit with my boyfriend (who doesn't even like mustard).  I think he ate them all by himself.  I was unable to try them but they looked delicious!

My family really loved these - even the boys who usually resist anything green.  I substituted bacon for the ham and used fresh green beans instead of frozen.  Will definitely make again.

I think the name says it all. These were very yummy! I'm not much of a honey mustard fan but this was really good.

My husband wasn't a fan, but he's weird. I thought these were great. Sadly I probably won't make them again, because he didn't like them, but I would recommend this recipe to others in a heartbeat. Thank you for sharing!

these green beans came out tasting rreally bland...probably my fault, so I might try again.  I kept adding kosher salt to them to make them at lest palatable.

Normally, I find green beans barely edible, but these tasted great. Used some leftover turkey instead of ham and added a bit of extra mustard because It came out fast from the bottle. These will definitely end up in my rotation. Thank you!
