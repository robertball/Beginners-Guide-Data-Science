I made one batch with no cream cheese or cheese on the top and my daughter in law ate 2 of them, she loves it.

The 2nd one I made with spinach tortillas and I added a half can of beans. It was a big hit!

I doubled this recipe for a large group, but I used 2 sweet potatoes and 2 regular potatoes. It was a hit with everyone! I will be making this again. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly.  These enchiladas were delicious!  Great option for meatless Mondays. I will absolutely be making this recipe again.

I had my doubts about this recipe and was pleasantly surprised.  It was really good.  We added cayenne because we like it spicy and used corn tortillas instead of flour.  Flour tortillas get that gummy texture when they are wet which I find unpleasant to eat.

I use 1 lb sweet potatoes, ten 8" flour tortillas (soft taco size), 4 oz cream cheese and a 12 ounce jar of GREEN enchilada sauce. We top with sour cream when serving. This is excellent and a wonderful vegetarian recipe to have on hand.  We've made it 4-5 times now.

This was so good! Needed it to be gf so used corn tortillas that I fried in a little oil. Just microwaved the 2 big sweet potatoes to save time. We like cheese a lot so sprinkled a little inside the enchilada before I rolled it. Instead of cooking spray, just spread a little sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 (had lots of filling). Topped with extra green onions and cilantro just before serving. Easy and delicious, will definitely make again!
