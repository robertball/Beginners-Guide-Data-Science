I found this recipe while searching for ways to use fresh beets from my garden. The beets are delicious and just different enough from my canned pickled beets that the change is refreshing.  The cinnamon is perfect. I made deviled eggs out of the eggs.  Very tasty, but next time I will leave any vinegar or lemon juice out of the yolk filling, as the outside has enough of that taste.  The deviled eggs were quite eye-catching!  Deep purple, fluffy yellow filling, green parsley sprinkled on top.  But you do need to pickle them about 4 days for the eggs to "purple" all the way through to the yolk.  To use fresh beets:  Wash beets, leaving roots intact, and cut the tops, leaving two inches at beet.  Barely cover with water, and simmer till tender.  Drain. Cool, and slip the skins off the beets.  Slice as desired.  You will need about 1-1/2 cups sliced beets and about 1/2 cup for what would have been in a can of beets.

These are yummy.  I increased the vingear to 3/4 cup, decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup, and added a small sliced onion to the mix.

Very good. The recipe says 4 hours, but by then only the outside of the egg is pickled.  Wait 3-4 days if you like them purple to the core.

My husband loves pickled eggs so I gave this recipe a try - I increased the vinegar to 3/4 cup and left out the cinnamon.  I added a bit of thin sliced red onion when I layered everything into a glass jar with a tight fitting lid. You really have to let these set for at least four days to get that rich deep reddish purple color all the way through to the yolk.  These are always great with beer!

This is a wonderful recipe; the only problem I found was that the recipe states they will keep in the fridge for up to 2 weeks…but not in my house!

The recipe was very easy. I don't like pickled eggs, but I made them for my husband who thought they were pretty good. I agree that they need to refrigerate for a couple of days for the color to set in more.

This is a terrific pickled egg recipe.  I have had eggs twice since I first made this recipe (made by different people, using different recipes) and they were BLAND and tasteless.  I wanted to say hey, I tried this great recipe, you should too!

This recipe is excellent and so easy.  I never could get the exact amount of ingredients to make my eggs taste really good.  The cinnamon adds a special touch.

Will DEFINITELY make again (SOON!) LOVE LOVE LOVE! I took the advice of a fellow cook and used 2 cans of beets, 1 cup CIDAR vinegar, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and 1/2 a large chopped sweet (Vidalia) onion! DIVINE! Put the beets, onion, and 1 egg in my spinach salad for lunch today! Terrific! Also used the dash of cinnamon---PERFECT!

These are delicious, flavorful pickled eggs and beets. We added 1/4 cup cider vinegar and some chopped onion, and let them sit for four or five days. The eggs turned out a deep purple, and both the eggs and the beets have a sweet tangy flavor that is just wonderful. This is a great recipe.

Try replacing cinnamon with 1 tbls. of Pickling Spice. Add slivered onion.   Works very well with the eggs especially and doesn't undermine the beet flavor.

I am so happy I found this recipe. I will be making pickled eggs exactly like this forever.  DO NOT forget the cinnamon - it gives them a great taste. My 2nd favorite thing about this recipe was how you cook the eggs - perfection. Regular hard boiling makes them dry, but these are sooo moist.The shells are a little hard to seperate from the egg but it is worth the extra effort, believe me. Just make sure you cool them for awhile before peeling. Oh yeah, and I doubled the batch and it wasn't enough. They were the first thing gone on the table. Beets were great too. Make lots. YUM!

Love pickled eggs and beets! YUM! Used to eat as a kid and wanted to make some so I found this recipe. I used a large pickle jar and make a dozen and a half eggs, three cans of beets. I use a cup of vinegar and 1/2 cup sugar. So good! These go quickly in my house!

Our family recipe calls for brown sugar and cider vinegar and 4-5 days(we like them deeply purple) in the back of the refrigerator.  They have to stay in the back because they disappear from the front!:)  I will try the cinnamon this time.

This is a great simple recipe.  I did not use the cinnamon and took the advice of another reviewer and let them set 4 days.  The only thing I will change next time is the amount of sugar.  It was too sweet for my taste.  I will use this recipe again.

I am so excited! I just made these and they are already a gorgeous purple! I did use 3/4 cup vinegar to 1/4 cup of sugar. I found there wasnt enough liquid to cover them (perhaps because i kept the beets whole, much prettier) so I did add about 1/4 cup more vinegar with water. Now the hardest part is going to be waiting 4 days! An eternity!

This recipe has been pasted down for generations in my family. Awesome!  However, eggs and beets should marinate 3 days for best flavor.  The egg white is purple but the yolk remains yellow.

This recipe brought back memories of growing up in Pennsylvania Dutch country.  The eggs taste just as I remember them - great.  As I was making them, my husband looked at me like I was nuts (he grew in AZ, what can I say); but after he tasted them he also agreed they were very tasty.  I can see these are going to become a frequent addition to our diet.  I did omit the cinnamon.

Like everyone else out there, I'm desperately trying to come up with things to do with hard boiled eggs! I knew this would put a spark in hubby's taste buds as loves beets and he loves eggs. You can imagine how happy I was to find this recipe. The only thing I left out was the cinammon. As I expected, he loved this Cathy!

My family has made these every Easter for as long as I can remember. We use about 1/4 to 1/3 cup sugar and put 2 cinnamon sticks and about 5 or 6 whole cloves in a cheesecloth bag so we can remove it easily once the liquid cools. Otherwise, everything is the same. ... and when we run out of eggs and beets, we boil some more and dump them in to the leftover liquid.

Very easy to make and delicious. Waited 4 days and they were wonderful. They were gone by day 5. As an added bonus, the beets were yummy, too. I cook my eggs in a pressure cooker and they are easier to peel, so they look nicer too. Definitely plan on making these every week to have as a healthy snack on hand for us.

Make these all the time. Especially good for summer BBQ's for the beer drinkers! I add a couple slices of onion and two or three (or more) garlic cloves, depending on the amount of eggs, I also add crushed peppercorns..

These are so awesome.  Kind of like devilled eggs only in reverse (the outside tastes good and the inside tastes normal).  When I made these the last time, I used a beautiful antique egg plate that also had a section for relishes.  I put the beets in the relish section and the eggs in the devilled egg slots.  I usually cut at least one of the eggs open so people can see what they are getting into.

My husband had pickled beets before but not pickled eggs.  He wasn't quite sure about the purple eggs.  I only added a pinch of the cinnamon and you can still really taste it.  Next time I'll leave it out completely.  Oh, he loves purple eggs now!

Followed the recipe exactly, but opted out of the cinnamon, and they were yummy!  Just as I expect pickled eggs to be.  I took them to Easter and others enjoyed them as well.  I made mine Friday night and let them sit until Sunday, stirring every once in a while to make sure they evenly purpled :)

I really liked these eggs.  I put a small cinnamon stick in the jar while marinating to add a little more cinnamon taste.  Simple and delicious.

This was just OK.  My mom has always pickled eggs and beets for Easter each year.  And I love pickled beets on salads, so I make them often.... but only with vinegar.  I was looking for a recipe that would make them a tiny bit less sour.  This recipe was ok, but I definitely needed more of a vinegar taste (and I didn't even use the whole amount of sugar).  I also did not like the color that the beets and juice turned once boiled.  The beets, and now eggs, are an unappetizing color compared to the vibrant color the beets were prior to boiling.

I didn't remember the sugar/water/vinegar ratio I used before, so this was the first recipe I landed on. I love pickled beets and eggs and I have trouble letting them sit long enough to get purple through the whole egg white, but I try. I put these in a glass jar and they were pretty tasty. I never put cinnamon in them before. I did add a little splash of extra vinegar, though, because some of the reviews made me concerned they would be too sweet. In any case, they turned out fine for me and were pretty close to the recipe I used to use (that I lost).

Still working on this one.  Husband felt, "not vinegary enough".  I'll have to try some of the suggested alterations.

These were really good.  I made them without the cinnamon, just because I don't like the flavor of cinnamon with eggs.  There was just the right amount of sugar and vinegar to make these taste perfect.  I will be making these again.

I decreased the sugar as some of the other reviews suggested and these pickled eggs were fantastic!  I let them marinate for 5 days and they were the most beautiful color.  Great by themselves or over a salad.

I added two onions sliced in 1/4" rings and one clove of garlic halved.  Wait  4-5 days for the flavors to blend.

Please note, this review is for my notes until I am able to taste test & probably then not considered true to recipe at which time I will remove my review.  As per another reviewer suggestion--I used about 8 eggs, 1/4 c sugar, 3/4 c white vinegar, 1/2 c water, and sliced 2 small onions.  This was the closest recipe I could find so far that seems most similar to how my mom used to make them, hers were more tart, less sweet.  Recipe as written might be sweeter than I prefer which is why I went with less sugar.  I also added 1 clove garlic, but only because i use garlic in nearly everything. I too did not have enough liquid so I added a small amount (equal parts) vinegar/water to fill container to top off eggs.  I'm hoping for the best...

This was a great recipe.  My father-in-law couldn't believe I was able to make his favorite snack the way he remembered it!  The only thing I did not do is put in any cinnamon...otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  I will definitely be making these again!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Love pickled eggs. Grew up eating them at holidays. The purple color from the beets is fabulous. If you think this sounds gross your wrong, remember it's refrigerated so it's just like a hard boiled or deviled egg. I don't add cinnamon.

I used fresh beets and included a turnip that needed using. Since the veggies were fresh I added a bit more water. The juice for all tasted good before I poured it over the eggs, so I think it’ll be a winner.

These are awesome! I added a little pickling spice and went with the cinnamon. I thought the cinnamon smelled a little intense when it was hot still,  but in the end it mellowed out nicely to a fun flavor. I refridgerated for a week since I was out of town,  not sure I'll have the patience to wait that long next time... which will be soon!

We’re  quite good, but we like our pickled eggs to have more of a “bite” and a touch sweeter.  Will make again, but will increase the vinegar and sugar and leave out the water.  There is enough beet liquid that it shouldn’t need extra water.

Made these pickled eggs for a picnic.  I had never cooked the beets with sugar, but loved the flavor--everyone did.  I did not include cinnamon.

Came out perfectly. Let them soak for at least 4 days to absorb the liquid completely.

Easy and so good!  I tweaked it a bit by adding ground cloves instead of cinnamon.  My Nana used cloves in hers, and it was delicious!!

These were very good.  I did use only half the amount of sugar and they were just the right sweetness.  Will definitely make again.  Happy Granny

My boyfriend absolutely LOVES purple eggs. Normally his Gram makes them for him but as a surprise I thought I’d try my hand out at it. He kept saying something was off and he could taste something weird at the backend. I can only assume it was the cinnamon. That being said he still ate every last one but I’ve already got Grams recipe for next time.

My family loves pickled eggs & this recipe is so easy to make.  The only thing I add when I make this is a bay leaf.  When I heat up the liquids along with the cinnamon, I put in a bay leaf then remove it when I pour the mixture over the eggs.

This is a good recipe, tho I, too, like less sugar.  A quarter cup is plenty.  I  add onion slices, separated into rings, and one or two whole cloves,  Makes a nice salad topping, too.  A bowl of greens, the eggs halved or quartered, black olives, blue cheese chunks, the beets and onion rings.

Finally, ...... a way I can eat boiled eggs (other than deviled, lol). I'm a new canned beet lover thanks to this recipe. I Use the salt free canned beets after draining & rinsing. I do just use a "dash" of cinnamon. They are sweet, but get me to eat some great nutrition. LOL Ty for recipe.

I have never made pickled eggs before and so I was curious to try them.  I like beets and pickled beets, so this seemed like a good recipe to try.  

I followed suggestions by others who made them.  I increased the vinegar to 3/4 cup, decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup, left out the cinnamon, and added 1 T pickling spice and 1 small sliced onion.  Since some suggested using cider vinegar, I split my recipe in half, using cider in one half and regular vinegar in the other half.  I ended up not liking the taste of either.

I did something wrong! Too late I read the review that recommended not using McCormick's pickling spice. I tried to get as many of the cloves out but must've missed a few. Instead of the gorgeous ruby red, I had lavender colored eggs. While tasty,  visually unappealing. Will try these again with homemade spice concoction. These were great for snacks, as long as I closed my eyes.

I made these according to the recipe but I reduced the sugar in half. The flavor is good but I prefer a stronger vinegar flavor. I will make these again but will increase the amount of vinegar

Great recipe for proportions and technique. I use fresh roasted beets from my garden. They are sweet enough, so I reduce the sugar to about 2 tablespoons.

Used about 20 quail eggs for this recipe. This is the second time I've made these, and boy, are they tasty! I used 3/4 cup of vinager, and 1/4 cup of sugar since my hubby felt the first time I made them they were just a tad too sweet. I followed all other ingredients as written and they fit perfectly into my mason jar. This recipe is a hit at camp and I just made them again for Christmas Eve!

This is now my "go to" recipe for pickled eggs.  Minor changes: added sliced onion ( I love pickled onions!), and cut back a lttle on the sugar (I dislike anything remotely sweet!). The 1/2 cup sugar amount is probably ok, but a little over 1/3 of a cup was sufficient for me.  My husband loves this recipe too!

I made these because my Mom always used beets on hers (though I never tasted them) and my boyfriend is a fan of beets, plus they are pretty.  So, I made these and tasted them 24 hours after pickling and to be honest, they were absolutely delicious! I did not expect these to be good at all! I mainly only made them because my Mom bought me a pretty new jar and I wanted to use it haha.  And, I figured these would be a good way and my mom kept talking about hers.  These were the perfect mix of sweet and vinegar and not to mention, they were BEAUTIFUL!!!!!  I can't wait for my boyfriend to try them out this weekend.  Thank you for sharing!  FYI...I made NO changes to the recipe.  I always make it as is to start with before I start twiddling with it and I won't be editing this recipe at all.  It's delicious!

This recipe was REALLY good!  I have fond memories of the pickled eggs my mom used to make years ago every summer.  I was reminded of her when I ate these eggs.

Grew up with pickled eggs, unfortunately the recipe was never passed down.  This is the closest I ever came.  The only difference is I use whole cloves instead of cinnamon.  Delicious.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I find that only waiting for 4 hours until eating these eggs is too soon. It doesn't have much of a taste then, I waited overnight but st

I never made pickled beets before and hated them as a child. My first batch, following this recipe and including the cinnamon, is outstanding! Delish! Amazing! 
Holy cow, this could be so many things - party food, appetizer, side dish, movie snack, dessert. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe

It's Easter and time for pickled eggs in my house. I could not find my recipe so I had to find another one similar to mine and came upon this one. I don't use cinnamon in my pickled eggs and like to add sliced onions and found I had to double up on the vinegar but the deep purple color and the taste was a hit with my family. I have already added this recipe to my recipe collection. Thanks!

Very easy and very good.  Next time I will add just a bit more vinegar since I like a little more "bite".  Now, I can keep these on hand and won't have to buy one or two at a time while at the deli counter.

I have been making pickled eggs for years as an Easter tradition. I wanted to try something different this year and I am so glad I did!  This is by far better than my old recipe.  The sugar adds a nice touch.  Thanks Kathy!
