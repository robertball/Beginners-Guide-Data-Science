These were awesome!  Incredible flavor and what could be simpler?  I have to wonder if those that thought these were bland used Coconut Milk instead of Cream of Coconut.  Look for Cream of Coconut in the Liquor Isle.

YUM!!!!!  My man wasn't too thrilled by the idea of these carrots, and I myself am not a major fan of cooked carrots either but I do love coconut, and I am always using coconut milk in things, crème of coconut sounded good, so thought eh… why not?  Because could this recipe BE any easier? I can’t get over how simple and yet how very tasty these were!! I couldn't get enough. And my picky Bo ate them down! Will be making again! So easy! Thank you for the great recipe!

I always make candied carrots as part of my Thanksgiving dinner.  This year I tried this recipe and it is fantastic and oh, so easy.  Just a little tip...after the carrots were cooked, I added a little cornstarch mixed with water to thicken.  Looks lovely and so dramatic when served.  FABULOUS RECIPE! Oh, be sure to use CREAM OF COCONUT, not coconut milk.  Big difference!

I made the mistake of using coconut milk and had to improvise quickly. Added sugar, butter and vanilla extract, which made it good.

This was so simple and REALLY good!.  I did make some additions as I was bringing this for a side dish to a potluck.  I added cayanne pepper (about 1/8 t) and a few good shakes of red pepper flakes while it was simmering.  I also toasted unsweetened coconut and sprinkled that on top after cooking, along with a handful of chopped cilantro.  I got lots and lots of compliments on this dish.

I made this using one pound of baby carrots and a little more than  1/3  cup of cream of coconut (the can I had in the house was 15 ounces). After cooking the carrots and cream of coconut, I put the mixture in the food processor and mashed  them. They were a really tasty side dish. Both my husband and I enjoyed them.

Overall, it tasted OK... but it was hard to taste the difference between it and normal carrots.  I'd recommend this recipe, though - and use baby carrots!

Sweet, Easy, "mother-in-law" approved!  Even the kids liked them.  The taste is not a wow, overpowering taste, just something alittle different and enjoyable.  I don't know how I will go back to regular steamed carrots!

Wow! This was too sweet!!! the person that said "bland" must have used coconut MILK! I liked the idea alot, it kind of reminded us of sweet potatoes. First taste was good, but after a few bites again,just too sweet. My mom used o make me creamed carrot's when I was a kid, I'm thinking that if you made this recipie and then drained (not rinsed) all the creme of coconut and then stirred the carrots into a rue (white sauce) that might be really good!

These carrots are so delicious and so easy to do. Make sure you use cream of coconut and not cocnut milk.
