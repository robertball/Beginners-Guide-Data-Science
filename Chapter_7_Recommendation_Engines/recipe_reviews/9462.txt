I find the nuts "out of character" for this square.  This is similar to the one I make.  1/4 cup butter melted in saucepan with 1/2 cup peanut butter.  Stir in 1 cup butterscotch chips until melted.  When cool enough so marshmallows don't melt, mix in 1 small bag of coloured marshmallows (227 gr.).  Turn into greased 9"x9" pan.  Cool and cut into 1" bars.  Always the first thing to go at our bake sales! HINT:  Sprinkle coloured marshmallows around bars when serving.

this is the kind of sweet treat that dreams are made of!!! I have made these for many years and they disappear off the plate almost instantly. heaven!! the only thing I do differently is no nuts or coconut. mmmm!

( I have to add a note to this review after reading the review of this recipe by a MIRABLUE!! bakers, do not be put off by her review. this is one of the five top square recipes ever! delicious and always a huge, huge hit!! the melding of the peanut butter and butterscotch is just so intensely wonderful. try it and you will not be sorry!I can not say enough about the excellence of this square! PERFECT, PERFECT, PERFECT!)

I hate to be the first to give bad reviews but I really have to on this one!  I made the recipe as is and it's just terrible.  I guess I'm an old fashioned cook but I like my flavors to compliment eachother and this "snack" was the exact opposite from what I desire.  My husband put it perfectly when he said that you could take a spoonful of each ingredient, eat them simultaneously and that would be your outcome.  I thought it was disgustingly sweet and I honestly had to brush my teeth after eating them!  I do not recommend this one, sorry.

these turned out really well.  i followed the directions exactly but it would have been better to pour the peanut butter mixture over the marshmallows.  other than that they were delicious!!

The overall taste was good. I personally thought there were too many flavours in an old favourite of mine. I think I will leave out the walnuts when I make it again.

I can't stop eating these! I made these for a party that I am bringing a sweets tray to,  and I thought I would sample one first to "make sure they were ok." I have eaten about 4 already! I also omitted the coconut and walnuts, but added rice krispie cereal instead. It added a great crunch and that mixed with the creamy fudge and the soft marshmallows is wonderful.

this was a good idea. i changed a few things... i left out the coconut and instead of walnuts i used peanuts. i doubled the ingredients and poured a layer of the peanut butter mixture (that i didnt not add the actual peanuts to) on the bottom of the pan, followed by a thin layer of marshmellow cream topped with a layer of peanuts, then i poured the rest of the peanut butter mixture over that, plus any remaing peanuts i had and  i added the marshmellows to the top after it had cooled off a bit to avoid them melting completely. they turned out good.

My mom used to make these when we were kids, but without the coconut and walnuts. You don't need them. They are really good without them.

This was soooo good! I omitted the walnuts and used crunchy peanut butter. Also, I skipped the double boiler and used the microwave. Way less mess!

I have been looking for a recipe like this, as these are one of my favorite squares!  I often used to buy them at bakesales, and bakeries, but now I can make them at home.  I made these the other day, omitting the nuts and coconut, as I have never had either in these squares when I've purchased them, and my daughter and LOVED them.  They were just right.  And since I omitted the nuts and coconut, I added another cup of marshmallows instead.  It was great!  Thank you!

This is a really simple and yummy recipe!  I left out the nuts and coconut and instead of mixing the marshmallows in with the melted mixture, I put the marshmallows in the pan and poured the mixture over..much easier this way!

I love this recipe. I love making them in cupcake wrappers rather than in a pan. I find they are smaller for the kids and keep the kids clean cause their hands arent all sticky. Also then i can put them in a container and put them in the fridge to keep them cool. My girls love these. I have never tried them with the coconut or walnuts. Lol i have to make them the way that my grandma used too.

These are heavenly. We did not have butterscotch chips in the pantry and took chocolate chips instead. this was amazing. We added rice crispies and omitted the walnuts and coconut flakes. I would even add a second cup of rice crispies next time I make them. Definitely a new family favorite that we have to keep in the freezer so that it slows consumption.

This is one of the most requested recipes I've ever made. I swap the nuts for an equal amount of rice krispies. It makes the recipe go farther and "feel" lighter (even though it is truly sinful)

I love this classic bake sale square!  I'm not a fan of coconut, tho, so I did as another commenter suggested and added a cup of rice krispies to the mix with the marshmallows.

It was an alright kinda thing.  Very sweet, almost too much for me and I'm a total sweet tooth!! Next time I make this I might add a little salt, 1/2 tsp. maybe?? If you are like me and like your bars full of ingredients, add more coconut and maybe marshmallows.  Otherwise it's too much creaminess!  It's almost like having brownies with no extras. I did the same as the others and poured the mix on top of the marshmallows and mixed it up.

My grandmother made these bars when I was young, but when my mother remembered to ask for the recipe, Grandma gave her a different one.  We never got the right recipe.  Now I've got it and am so happy.  These bars are SO GOOD!

It would have helped if the recipe specified what size pan to use, as I initially used a 13x9 pyrex dish only to find that it was far too large.  I then moved the ingredients to a 9x9 pan which fit everything much more nicely, and didn't spread anything too thin.

Also when making these types of no-bake recipes, it's really much easier to throw all of the ingredients in the microwave using a pyrex mixing bowl for a little over a minute, then stir all of the ingredients together until it's all melted.  I promise you that everything will turn out exactly the same, and that it will be done much more quickly with fewer dishes to clean up.

I have always avoided these types of bars, because I don't have a double boiler. I tried this year by simply melting the butterscotch chips and butter in the microwave for about a minute, and stir to blend. Then added the peanut butter and stirred until blended. Add the marshmallows, cocoanut and nuts, stir and pour into buttered pan. 10 minutes, no mess, no fuss.

These are really sweet but always a hit... I put the butter, butterscotch chips and peanut butter in a microwaveable bowl and microwaved the 3 together for 1 minute on high.  When I took it out and stirred it, it all melted nicely together.  My family prefers nothing but the marshmallows, so I add those and then pour them into my parchment paper lined pan and off to the fridge they go!  Not something I make often, but for special holidays or treats!  They're a hit with kids and adults alike!

I love these! My Gram always makes them. I'm surprised it doesn't specify that you need to use the coloured mini marshmallows, because that is a HUGE contributor to the yumminess. Also I've never had them with nuts, so I left them out. I like the coconut sprinkled over top. We like these right out of the fridge so they are good and chewy! I don't use a double boiler, just melted chips, butter and pb in the microwave until melted, but not too hot and mixed in the marshmallows. Yum yum YUM!

Yes I agree with some other posters that the nuts do not belong. Also, instead of saying remove from heat and add marshmallows, there really should some cooling off period as my marshmallows melted. The result was still yummy! However I should state I also used natural peanut butter which takes a little longer to melt down... Thanks for the old school recipient tho, glad i could still make me like mom - sort of!

I hate it when people completely change a recipe and review it based on their changes, but my mom used to make these for me as a kid and she never used coconut or walnuts, so I omitted them.    I read a few reviews suggesting Rice Crispies; I tried it and it was great!  
Thanks for sharing.

Would be a 5 without the coconut and walnuts - perfect without them, if you need a 'crunch' use crunchy PB or add rice krispies :)

We did not add nuts or coconut as I made it before with coconut and I didn't like it very much.  This time I used chocolate chips and it was very good!

These yummy sweet squares are loved by most. My mom has made these for us all our lives and everyone loved them. We use only the little white marshmallows 250 g bag...the whole bag and that gets rid of a lot of what I refer to as strange sweetness of the colored marshmallows and bring out the taste of chocolate and peanut butter, we don't put nuts in either. We use milk chocolate chips or butterscotch depending on what flavor we we feel like at the time. Try these both ways folks but please get rid of the colored marshmallows and try the white. Coconut is delicious in these.

I used white chocolate chips, replaced the walnuts with honey roasted peanuts and skipped on the cocount. Everyone loved them. Next time I would use colored marshmallows to make them more pretty.

I made these following the recipe but omitted the coconut and walnuts, (I intended to throw in some salted peanuts but forgot to get them at the store!) So easy, and after chilling for 1 hour, I cut some pieces for my hubby to taste-test with me. Yummo! Neither of us have ever had anything like this, and we both liked it. We will try it again with the peanuts for more texture. I usually hate to see when people modify a recipe the first time they make it but I'm taking these to a party and I know at least one person is not into coconut...so I'm guilty of modifying too! I don't see how you can go wrong with this one. Its great!

The only thing bad about these are they are too good!  We did not have walnuts so we used peanuts.  We did not have a double boiler so we used the Microwave.  We do not recommend that you use no name brand marshmallows as we did and they got really mushy really fast so we had to put white mini marshmallows on top to make them look better, we also added green and red sprinkles to decorate them up for Christmas

Drop the nuts and coconut and add a bunch of puffed wheat.  The puffed wheat adds crazy good texture to an already awesome recipe.  These squares smell and taste good enough to make a grown man cry (or do whatever his wife wants him too so that she will make them ? Word.

These are the best!!  I have been eating these since I was a kid, some 30 yrs ago!!  I do not add the coconut as not everyone likes it, but I do use crunchy peanut butter, but a good kind, like Jif or Kraft.  These are a big hit whenever I make them...even my 5 yr old who doesn't honestly like sweet things, eats them.  Yes, you could take a spoonful of each, but it wouldn't be the right consistency...These are soo good!!!

Flavour is perfect.  I recommend letting the melted mixture cool before you add the marshmallows amd nuts.  That way you get a more uniform consistency and the marhmallows don't rise to the top.

My entire family loved this recipe! I added 1/2 cup more coconut and used pecans instead of walnuts. I took the advice of another reviewer and spooned the mix over the marshmallows and mixed slightly. I used an entire bag of mini marshmallows, which was a bit too much. I also drizzled approx 1/2 cup melted chocolate chips over the top. Very tasty! 

Next time, I am going to try increasing the peanut butter, using peanuts instead of pecans/walnuts, decreasing the marshmallows and tossing in a few cups of Cheerios cereal. Thanks for an excellent recipe!

This is so good.  We leave out the nuts and flakes and use the colored mini marshmallows.  Then we call it "Toxic Waste"!  It's fun and easy.

I made these just as the recipe said, and they are super tasty! Creamy, sugary, and nutty. I think the flavors go well together, surprisingly so. I think I would like to try making again with peanuts instead of walnuts, and maybe toasting the coconut, and another batch without nuts and coconut. Just to get a good feel for it all! Yummy!

Excellent treat for peanut butter lovers, though I prefer them without nuts or coconut.  I dream about these.....

To keep the marshmallows from melting: run a small amount of cold water into sink, when mixture is melted, place the pot into water and stir until cools slightly, then pour the mixture over the marshmallows which you have ready in another bowl. To keep the goodies from sticking in the pan, I butter pan then place wax paper which I lightly butter.  After cooling can be easily lifted out of pan. This is one of our most favorite treats.*********

I find the nuts out of character for this recipe. For a chunkier texture, you can try chunky peanut butter instead. You can also substitute chocolate chips for the butterscotch. With the absence of the nuts, I find you need at least 4 cups of the marshmallows. The other thing I found frustrating was that the mixture was so hot that it melted the marshmallows. If you like them to stay together, put the marshmallows in the pan first and pour the mixture over top.

a classic.  as previously mentioned, should be no nuts, no coconut - thats just wrong!  my preference is... use half butterscotch chips and half chocolate chips.  gives it an awesome flavor.  these are definitely the hit of my christmas baking with both the kids and the adults.

I made this for my fiance tonight (he is a complete peanut butter & chocolate fanatic).  I used 1/2 pack of butterscotch chips and 1/2 pack chocolate chips.  Also added a cup of chocolate rice crispies instead of coconut and walnuts.  Chunky peanut butter also gave it an extra crunch.  Super good and will definately be making it again!

Although I'm not a personal fan of this square.  It is a very good recipe.  My husband loves it.  I just prefer the chocolate version better.  This is great for baby/wedding showers.

Awesome.  The after taste and before taste were mouth watering.  I make this dessert without the nuts or coconut and it makes it taste more like a fudge.  Everytime I make it, people gobble it up - yes, like a turkey!

I've made this recipe many times - and it is always a hit with my peanut butter loving family. I've made the squares with and without the nuts and coconut. When I omit these ingredients, I add another cup of marshmallows. I am going to try the suggestions made by Karen S. and see how that version is.

Makes very good squares! I used only 3 cups of marshmallows, and will probably use 2 1/2 cups the next time.  I also added about 1/2 cup of peanut butter over what the recipe called for.

This is a very sweet bar that is not for the faint of heart!  They are VERY rich, but delicious.  I took them to a party and they were a hit!  I omitted the nuts because I didn't have any on hand...but I'm glad I did, b/c I'm not sure walnuts would have made them any better, although it may have negated some of the sweetness.

Such a yummy treat - not the healthiest however. Instead of butter, I used natural unsweetened peanut butter and it worked really well.

I have been craving these forever! I'm happy I found this recipe. I made them today and they are perfect. I didn't add the walnuts and I wasn't sure of the equivelent of 3.5oz so I added the whole bag of coloured marshmallows. I will definately make these again!

These are really delicious and very easy!  I kept going back for more!  I made a few changes.  Instead of walnuts, I used chopped peanuts.  I also toasted the coconut for added flavor (spread coconut on baking sheet and toast in 375 degree oven for 5-7 minutes, stirring every few minutes, watch carefully)

This is the most addictive dessert of all time. Like others I grew up with the basic recipe of this, no coconut or nuts in it. But I LOVE it with the coconut and nuts, they add to it in my opinion. I do have to almost double the marshmallows, I find there is too much sauce part. It is a very sweet dessert and using more marshamallows makes a bigger batch and cuts the sweetness a bit

Delicious squares. My mother in law has made them for years. I omitted the nuts and coconut because she never used it either and I wanted it to be like hers.  However, I found that by following the recipe and just omitting the nuts and coconut it leaves the base a bit too thick. I may just cut down the quantity of the ingredients in the saucepan next time. Otherwise, they tasted just like hers.

Just what I was after! Substituted the rice krispies for nuts, but have made with nuts and enjoyed that, too. No coconut, but only because it was for a gift and I know many people do not like the taste.
Suggestion: Not mixing the marshmallows was a helpful tip. I used a 9x13 pan lined with parchment, which was too big as the bar was a bit on the thin side. An improvement would be to use a 9x11 and spread some of the melted mixture onto the bottom of the pan, then layer the marshmallows, spread the rest of the melted mixture and sprinkle some reserved marshmallows over top.

This is a favorite when I make it. I don't always use walnuts as they are not always in my pantry. But with or without they always all get eaten.
Update... So I experimented with this, I used key lime flavoured candy melts instead of butterscotch chips, I also used pistachio butter instead of peanut butter. It was well received.

I love this recipe, one question I have is....How can I keep the marshmallows from floating up? I always end up with a bottom that is purely peanut butter/butterscotch.

Great recipe! I love coconut so I left that in but did not add the walnuts. Good idea putting the marshmallows in the pan first and then pouring the mixture over top.

These are really fun and easy.  A definite crowd pleaser for kids and a nice break from chocolate. I melted all my sauce ingredients together in the microwave and this worked very well.  Used a whole package of fruity mini mallows and a cup or so of rice krispies for crunch. No nuts or coconut shreds because of allergies and braces. Put mallows and krispies in pan and poured sauce over after it cooled a little. Turned mixture over a few times to coat and voila! All done and nothing melted!  Really easy and candy-like!  A fun treat, thanks for posting!  A nice blast from the past...a lot like grandmas version so all the happy memories are included!

This is such a treat.  It is pure enjoyment but I only make it once in awhile because I find it hard to stop eating!!!  I also make to give as a gift and it is a big hit.

This was one of my favs growing up. This tastes just like the one my Mom made but only on really special occasions. I don't add the walnuts. The secret to making this  is after everything is melted stir in the coconut and let cool a few minutes so it doesn't melt the marshmallows. Pour the coconut and melted ingredients over the marshmallows in a big bowl. Mix gently and only as much is needed to mix it all up.

I make these because a friend got me hooked on her recipe and until I could retrieve a recipe from her, I modified this one to suit the ones she made, which are very addictive.

Nice combination of salt and sweet!
I omit the nuts and coconut and sometimes I add 3/4 milk chocolate or semi-sweet chocolate chips. I've done plain white marshmallows too and delish, but there's something about the tutti-frutti ones..

Substituted 1/4 cup coconut oil and 1/4 cup margarine for butter. Added rice krispies instead of nuts and coconut. Turned out very tasty.

Made this recipe today and I must say it's excellent. One thing that is missing in the instructions is to cool the peanut butter mixture before adding to marshmallows. Hadn't made this in awhile and had somewhat forgotten exactly what to do. Looks nicer when you pour cooled peanut butter mixture over the marshmallows. Awesome taste.

I love this recipe!!! I use almond butter instead and it is delicious. I have had many people say they like it better thant the peanut butter version. . . a nive nutty flavor. More so than peanut butter. Just be sure the oil is mixed in really well to the almond butter or the dessert will be somewhat dry and crumbly. Kirkland has a creamy almond butter brand that works really well. And I find the "Chipits" brand butterscotch chips melts and blends better too. A really nice alternate to the peanut butter version.

Tried it with coconut and nuts I didn't care for the crunch...I have known this treat to be used with rainbow marshmallows and called butterscotch confetti...All in all a good recipe and everyone can tweak it to personal preference, have a batch in the fridge using wow butter (soy based peanut butter alternative)

Yes, I tried this recipe and it tasted OK however, I had a lot of trouble keeping the marshmallows from melting into the peanut butter mixture, Can you tell me how to stop the marshmallows from melting as I stir them in???

If you follow the recipe exactly, they turn out very, very sweet.  If less butterscotch chips were added, I think they would turn out better.

I don't like nuts in anything I make, so I just omitted them, and I only had Reese peanut butter chips, so I used those....
This is my FAVOURITE treat, and I may even be guilty of eating half a tray over the weekend (my husband being guilty of eating the second half!).
Sweet? Oh, ABSOLUTELY!! But it tastes EXACTLY how I would expect all of these ingredients to taste together.

My Mom's version of this recipe doesn't call for butter.  Instead, it has 1 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1/2 cup of walnuts (instead of 1 cup) and 1/2 cup of flaked coconuts (instead of 1 cup).  I find it's perfect the way Mom used to do it as the walnuts and coconut do not overpower the recipe.  This was an all-time favorite when I was growing up and thirty something years later, still is !!!

I love this easy recipe.  I melt the butter, peanut butter, and chips in the microwave making it super easy!  I omit both the nuts and coconut as my kids don't like either.  But do use the microwave; just don't overheat or you will melt the marshmallows when you add them.

These are really sweet but there's a time and place for something really sweet.  When I make these again I'll use a square pan rather than a 9 x13 pan so that they'll be thicker.  That's the only suggestion that I have.  Like others, I omitted the nuts and coconut but that's a personal preference thing.  Probably would be good wtih the nuts and coconut too but I'm not big on coconut.  These square are great for sweet indulgene at Christmas time.

I always use crunchy/chunky peanut butter instead of adding walnuts (which I find bitter)and the coloured marshmallows look better with this recipe.

This was a big hit.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and left out the coconut and walnuts.  I didn't have mini marshmellows, so I chopped up regular-sized ones (not an easy task!).  VERY tasty!

These have been a favorite of my family for YEARS !  Yes, I put in nuts and coconut...again, just a personal preference. :-)  And I definitely will try the rice krispie idea sometime soon.  Also, I never use a double boiler, just a dutch oven pan on medium and keep stirring as the butter, peanut butter and butterscotch chips melt. I do have 1 tip...I let the melted mixture cool for a few minutes, then add the colored marshmallows and spread in a 9 X 13 pan and put it in the fridge immediately, otherwise the marshmallows melt too much...again, a personal preference.  TOTALLY YUMMY !!!! :-)

My family and I ate all of these bars in 2 days...could not keep my fingers out of the bowl, and had to lick the spoon!

Left out nuts and coconut. Stored them in the fridge. Will definitely make again just not too soon as they are quite rich.

This was an easy excellent recipe. I added about 1/4 ( or a little more) Peanut Butter to the recipe. It worked very well!

I've always loved this easy recipe when my kids would like a special treat. I cut the nuts and coconut out as I like the bars better that way.

We have made these many times before but have never tried them with coconut and nuts.  Very nice addition.

I made these but different.  I used Necoa margarine for the butter, almond butter instead of peanut butter. I used organic semi sweet chocolate chips for the butterscotch and in place of walnuts I used a cup of dried cranberrys.  They turned out just great.  Will make this again.  The reason for the changes is food allergys. Dairy and peanut allergys.

Asked the Hubby what he would give it, he said a four or a five. I can't taste it as am allergic to coconut, however, I make something very similar to these called confetti squares (without coconut). It was very easy to make, and I didn't put the walnuts in it. Will make again.

This was great. I left out the walnuts cause the guys don't like them.I would have put peanuts in them but my son just got his braces and that is a no no . But it was really good.It's a keeper.

I love these, but I hate walnuts - I find them much creamier without the nuts anyways!  Great recipe.

These are so good! I remember having these when I was little. Next time I think I might try doubling everything except the marshmallows. For some reason I remember them being thicker, or I'll use a smaller pan.

Fantastic work!!  I've altered it slightly to have way more marshmallows, and changed the coconut shreddings to be the coloured kind.  Other than this cosmetic work, this is a excellent recipe!
