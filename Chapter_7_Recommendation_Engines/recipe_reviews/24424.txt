Whipped these up in no time!  The brown sugar made them much tastier and chewier than a sugar cookie made with white sugar. Like others, I rolled the dough between parchment paper to make it easier on myself...  cut the cookies there and simply lifted the parchment paper onto the cookie sheet. Easier cleanup, and no mushed shapes!  The cookies held their shapes well during cooking, even the ones I'd used the melon baller on.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I was very please with this recipe. They turned out really tasty. I added a tsp of almond extract for a little more flavor. My son loved how fast he got to decorate them. No chilling time was very helpful with little ones. Tastes a little like chocolate chip cookies, minus the chocolate chips. Only downside is used them with a leaf cookie cutter and they puff up a lot so they looked more like clouds. But will defenitly use the recipe again! Thanks!!

Made this recipe exactly as written. Very disappointed. It was way to moist to roll out without chilling. I ended up just pouring the mix into sheet pans to make sheet cookies. Hopefully they turn out good. The mix tastes wonderful. And just a tip... stop rating recipes that you have modified.

I'm definitely a cook, not a baker...but I made these cookies with relative ease. I was in a pinch and needed a fast cut-out cookie recipe. I made little hearts for Valentine's Day and they turned out super cute! I'd make these again.

I replaced half the flour with Whole Wheat flour and my kids didn't notice.  Great dough to work with and everybody loved the flavour.

hmmm......the fact that everybody else rated these 4 stars @ lowest makes me think i probably did something wrong, because when i baked these cookies, they turned out dry and tasteless. i dont know what i did wrong cause i followed the recipe exactly. a good thing about it though was the dough was very easy to work w/ and rolled out well

Yum!  Loved these, such a great flavor & a bit richer than  regular sugar cookies thanks to the brown sugar.   Found they puffed up a little too much when rolled 1/4 in thick,  but they baked perfectly when rolled thinner.  Will definitely bake these again!

THIS TURNED OUT FAB!!!! i used 3 cups of flour and i cup of unsweetened cocoa powder instead of the 4 cups of flour, and i used white sugar instead of brown.  i baked it for an exact 8 mins and it turned out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. SOOO GOOD!!!! for those who want a more crispy version of this, use white sugar. DO substitute 1 cup of flour with cocoa powder.you'll nvr regret it!!!! :)

These were good.  The dough is easy to handle...it doesn't fall apart when you are trying to roll it and with only a few ingredients that you would normally have on hand, they are easy to make!

This was the best cut out recipe I have ever made.  Very easy to work with.  I was nervous at first after mixing the batter.  It was crumbly, but suprisingly it rolled out just fine.  The cookies are very tasty, almost like a chocolate chip recipe without the chips.  Not bland tasting like some cut out cookies.  I will always use this recipe from now on.

Good recipe! Imade them for our "Christmas Around the World" Sunday School class and the kids enjoyed rolling out the dough and cooking them right away. I improved the taste by adding 2 tsps of ginger,which gave them some Christmas kick!The dough freezes well.I made some more last night for Santa to have.

These are easy to make and work well with cut outs, but the final product is a bit bland.  I won't be making these again.

I was really pleased with how easy these cookies were to make. The kids helped me on a week-night which are busy times around our house. I placed cling wrap over the dough to make it easier for my 3 year old to roll. Great taste.

I made these for a German class at school. It made so many that I was able to give some to my friends and my teachers. Everyone that tried them said that they were delicious. My sister thought that they would taste better with chocolate chips in it. These were quick and easy to make. The thing that took the longest was cutting out the cookies. They turned out well. Though I baked them for 10 minutes instead of 15 minutes. I will without a doubt make these again.

I thought these were very good.  Loved the brown sugar in them!  I followed the directions exactly.  I did make the dough a day before baking them, so I put them in the fridge, then let them sit out on the counter before rolling out.  I did find that I only had to cook them for maybe 6-7 min.  I didn't want to risk getting them hard and over cooked.  I may try a batch at 8 minutes to see how they turn out.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing !

I don't think I have a choice but to make these again.  Everyone loved them.  Not too chewey but not too crispy either.  But best, was it rolled out perfectly right away.  My 3 year old did not have to wait long before decorating.

These cookies are really easy to bake. But I guess it wasn't the cookies I was expecting. They looked fine before it was in the oven, but after in came out, it looked kind of ugly. But they were still pretty good.

Super easy to make, rolled out beautifully.  I really like the brown sugar used in these, made them more flavorful and chewy. Only problem was that they puffed more than expected during baking.  I did the recommended 1/4" but will try thinner next time.

Pretty good.  You can roll this dough out thicker than regular sugar cookies and it still holds its shape.

My family loved these. They aren't sweet all that much. The dough dried out fast so if you make these don't over handle. Very good recipe.

Fantastic! I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and it had this delicious earthy taste. Even the cookies left a week later were soft! I'm thrilled.

I love these. Tasty and quick. Know your oven, though! I mad small cut outs, and as the time went on, I went from 8 to 6 minutes.  Great without decor, for a dlecious, not too sweet treat.

They’re tasty and I’d make them again, because so easy to make. The dough turned out a bit soft but I added extra flour ( maybe 2 handfuls) while rolling and it fixed everything .

These cookies are wonderful! The only thing I changed was adding about 1/4 cup of water after all the dry ingredients, and wetting my fingers whenever it would start to crumble while rolling! They'r even good without frosting! Fluffy, soft, and good consistency. If I could give six/five stars, I would!

Love how easy these were to cut out and work with the dough.  Great for kids helping out.  And, the most awesome thing, they taste so wonderful!  The sweetness isn't overbearing and these cookies just melt in your mouth.  Huge success for our daughter's cheer fund raiser!!!

I love this recipe.  So easy to make and the dough is easy to handle.  They also taste fantastic.  The texture is somewhere between a chewy and crunchy cookie.    I don't make them very often because they are slightly addictive.  I think t is the brown sugar which gives them a slightly richer taste.   I either sprinkle them with colored sugar or male a butter cream to pipe on...it depends on how much time I have and how fancy I want to get.  I have used this recipe as the base for fruit pizza.  Yum!

I wasn't sure when the cookies would be ready because it didn't mention a specific colour which would indicate it, so I ended up over baking them by 5 minutes because they didn't look done. That made them crispy and hard like a regular cookie. I would take them out before 10 minutes, when they turn a light golden brown because I have a preference for soft cookies. Definitely going to be making these again as they were delicious. I got a lot of approval of this recipe.

I am almost never compelled to write a review, but this totally exceeded my expectations!  This is a great recipe! I'm at a high altitude, but didn't make any adjustments & they came out perfectly. I really thought the dough seemed too dry but I resisted the urge to deviate from the recipe, and I'm so happy I did. I have always hated butter cookies used for Christmas cookies but now I'm excited for this year! These were beautifully browned without being at all crunchy. Crisp enough to hold there shape, but even the thinnest of my cookies are soft & chewy. And they taste good! Thank you!!! :)

I made these for 2 reasons.  1: My family is German, so the title intrigued me.  2: I have never made a roll-out cookie with brown sugar.  These turned out really well.  They were super easy to roll out without any chilling (I used a silicone mat lightly dusted with flour), and the dough withstood a lot of handling and re-rolling without getting tough (the kids were helping me...). I like the end result: a slightly chewy sugar cookie.

3rd year using this recipe for our annual Christmas cookie decorating with the kids & grandkids.  :)    Wonderful cookies everytime, the only adjustment I had to make less baking time but that is due to an older stove and dark pans.

Used this recipe this winter to make cut outs for my grand kids. My son who found the recipe modified by using cane sugar in place of the brown sugar and reduced the vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp. They rolled without sticking and cut without sticking to the cutters. The cookies by themselves were very mild and medium well baked. Iced them the following day and they moistened up and became the wonderful chewy sugar cookie people expect at the holidays.

Followed recipe exactly. These were definitely soft sugar cookies which was nice. Dough was fairly easy to work with, a little bit sticky. Taste was good but nothing spectacular.

Well, first time making this, but adjusted recipe to 24 cookies.  When I went to roll out the dough, it was so sticky I had to add more flour and more flour.  I have finally gave up and put it in the fridge.

Nice, soft cookie.  I was skeptical about not requiring chill time, but it truly is fine straight from mixing bowl to being rolled out.  The flavor was more mild than I was expecting with the brown sugar, which was great for my daughter, but I think personally I would prefer this made with dark brown sugar and the salt should be upped to 1/2 tsp.

Great quick cookies! Halved the recipe and rolled them a wee bit thinner than called for.  My son wanted train cookies and within an hour we had 'em ready. Didn't have a train shaped cutter so cut i them with a sharp knife - came out well.

I was looking for a simple cookie recipe for my family 's annual Christmas Cookie Exchange and being pregnant this year I did not want to be standing for hours, nor did I want to have to do several batches. This recipe gave me the amount of cookies I needed (54) and then some (different shapes and sizes). I didn't have to wait long to decorate them as they cooled in NO time. 
I'm thinking of redoing the recipe with my my 3 yr old, so that she too can have some decorating fun !

I added ground cloves and nutmeg- AMAZING.  Great easy Christmas cookie to whip up for my toddler to help me decorate when the mood hits!

I HIGHLY dislike making cut out cookies. They're a pain and let's face it, sugar cookies are so BLAH! I made this recipe and I LOVE IT! Dough was quick, rolled BEAUTIFULLY and the taste is FAR superior to sugar cookies! Made Ninja cut outs for a bday party: HUGE HIT!

My kids (6 and 4) and I made these today. We followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect! Normally I avoid cut-out cookies like the plague but, these were so easy :) They are not as sweet as drop cookies.  if you want them sweeter then frost or decorate them.  They are plenty sweet for my goodie loving family! These are going in the recipe box!

The cookie itself is good but the dough was too moist to roll out, so I had to just roll the into balls like a regular cookie.

These are delicious and easy!  They have a mild, pleasant flavor before being frosted, which I thought was great with coffee, and they were perfect for the kids to frost.  Other reviewers suggested refrigerating before rolling out (even though the recipe says you don't have to), so I tried that, and found it actually made the dough really difficult to roll out.  BUT it led to a discovery: if the dough is fully chilled (ours was in the fridge overnight), you can shape it into a log and slice it into cookies.  I did some of our cookies rolled out and some sliced, and they worked equally well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very easy to roll and cut!  The texture is soft, and we love the caramel flavor from the brown sugar!  These are actually better without frosting, so that the brown sugar flavor shines!

Very good and quick recipe! The dough was little hard to work with at first, but it beats letting it sit for a few hours like other sugar cookie recipes!

These were very easy to roll out and cut. I frosted mine with cream cheese frosting. They were a hit at my son's Eagle party. They have a definite brown sugar flavor.

This recipe turned out perfect! I made them for work and everyone raved about them. They were a little time consuming but so worth it. Now all I need is the perfect icing recipe and I am set!

These are the best cookies ever!  The only thing I changed was I added 1 1/2 cups of flour (total of 5 1/2 cups).  I don't even like cut outs and I have been eating these like they are going out of fashion.

This is a good, basic cookie recipe that is easy to make.  I added a bit of cinnamon and it worked very well.

My husband and I are German, and we're not sure why these are called German cookies.

Okay, okay, I give up! I guess I just don't like rolled sugar cookies. I've tried several recipes on this site and the recipes that people rave about, to me just don't have much flavor. They aren't sweet enough for me. I thought this one would be different because of the brown sugar, but I just didn't care for it. Also, the dough is sooooo much easier to work with if you chill it first. I think my co-workers will like them, I think I'm just the weirdo that doesn't!

I needed a cut-out cookie recipe and this one caught my eye since I am learning a little German too.  Most cut-out cookie dough requires refrigeration but this one doesn't. The brown sugar gives them good flavor and texture. For Easter we made doves, angels and crosses. Excellent.
