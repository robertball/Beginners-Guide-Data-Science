Made this for a holiday party and it was a hit!!  I cut the apples up smaller so it was easier to put on a cracker!

I used the larger brie wheel and omitted the pecans due to a nut allergy.  I added one more slice of bacon and 1 more apple for the larger brie.  Next time i will diced apples so they are easier to eat.  This was an excellent change to my old crescent roll wrapped brie.  Everyone loved it!

I made the recipe without the bacon. First time I baked the nuts/sugar combo, it burnt but the second time I reduced the time and it was perfect. 
The apple topping was amazing but it made cutting through the Brie wheel a little challenging. 
I will definitely make it again!

I made this 2x this week for 2 parties! So easy (if it wasn’t, I wouldn’t even try to do it) and a huge hit both times!

I liked this recipe and I would make it again. My personal preference would be to increase (maybe double) the bacon and pecan portion of the dish. *Disclaimer* I currently don't have an oven, so I cooked the bacon and melted the brie on the stove. Next time, I might try to manipulate the cheese more and melt it with chicken stock, for example, to get it to a more fluid consistency. That way, when I mix in the apples, bacon, and pecans, the consistency is more spreadable. It may even store well in a spreadable form. As it is, I stored it overnight in my fridge and it still tasted good the next day (cold and warm). I definitely suggest using high quality bacon though. It takes the dish to the next level.

Good, not great. Given the ingredients I thought it would be amazing so I was a bit disappointed.
