So glad I tried something new, this was delicious! I used raw Andouille, so I started off by crumbling and browning the sausage, then removing it from the pot. I like a lot of veggies, so I sauteed some onions, carrots and celery, then added the lentils, chicken stock and spices to the pot. (didn't have turmeric, so I skipped it) I let it boil, then simmered until the lentils were softening and added the sausage back in. When the lentils were done I stirred in the mushrooms. I can't believe how well all of these flavors went together, thank you for sharing.

I had chicken Andouille sausage which wasn't spicy enough.  Next time I will use my usual hot Andouille sausage.  Added some cayenne for heat.  Will make this again.  Enjoyed the soup!

I used kielbasa instead of andouille and sauted carrots and onions with the mushrooms before adding to the soup. Oh my goodness! So good!!

Crimini Mushrooms are not common here, so just used white mushrooms.  Liked it, and will make it again.

I used sausage link without the casing instead. This recipe is very versatile and good.

Warming soup for cold weather.
My changes to original recipe:
Made broth from turkey drumsticks so I added meat to soup, as well as carrot and onion.
