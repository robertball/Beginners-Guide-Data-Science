I have been making (and eating) Creamed Egg for years.  I never thought I'd see a recipe in print - I thought it was something my Mother made up!  She made lots of vatiations, using browned hamburger, or browned sausage, or creamed dried beef instead of the hard boiled eggs.  The basic sauce recipe is so versitile that you could creme anything!  I bet some crumbled bacon would be delicious with the eggs in this recipe.  This recipe is a little different from my Mother's in that it called for Chicken Boullion. I gave it a shot and got great reviews.  I made it for breakfast yesterday for my two best friends and they loved it!  They wanted the recipe.  I directed them to allrecipes.com!  Thanks for another great recipe (one I thought my Mom was the only one who knew how to make it)

I was just about to add this as a recipe of mine, but I did a search first and found this. My grandma used to make this for me all the time -- the morning after I would spend the night at her house. It's hands down my favorite breakfast item! My family makes it pretty much the same way as listed here, but this honestly looks better (we use less eggs and more butter per serving -- the rest is the same). The eggs are the best part, so I find my rating to be valid, I would give my own recipe 4 stars. I like the idea another reviewer to put crumbled sausage in this. My GOSH! That would be heavenly! For those of you who are questioning whether or not to try this: it sounds a lot more weird than it really is. I have yet to make this for someone and have them not like it. This is a classic breakfast dish in my family that's been made for over 40 years! And so well loved that we've all memorized the recipe.

I have been eating and making this dish for over 50 years. My mom made this every Easter, and called it "Goldenrod Eggs" because of the sprinkled yolks over the creamed egg mixture. We add a pinch of dry mustard to our version.

This is one of my go-to recipes for my
husband's bad days. I made this for him when we first got together and he's still raving about it.

The only thing I do different is fry up
a pound of ground sausage and use the 
grease from the sausage, with a little 
butter, to make the milk gravy. Then,
I don't need to add bouillion. Just 
a little pepper and Tabasco. Then, I add
in the eggs.

Really good for a hangover.

Great Recipe!  My grandmother taught me a version of this, we chop the whole egg, no smashing the yolks seperately, add 1-2 tsp of worchestershire sauce, salt to taste, 1 med. onion diced fine and fried until soften but not brown (at the beginning of the recipe, makes a flavorful sauce base).  When I was about 10 and just learning to cook, my grandmother told me to start the peas one day when we were making this for lunch...I thought she meant to put the peas in the sauce with the eggs...it was a happy accident, now if this is served in my house for lunch or a quick supper, we always add peas and some parsley, and you have a different twist on this classic!  Isn't it interesting, I am from western canada and here it is a sauce, my husband is from eastern canada and there the same recipe is a gravy!  I was interested to see that phenom. here too.

Time-saving secret and tips: 

Since a child, mother patiently sturred the heating milk and flower to thicken. Forget it! All trained chefs know to heat the milk to just below a boil in microwave or on stove while preparing the white roux (flour and butter). 

Proportions for cream sauce are 2 tablespoons each butter and flour per cup of liquid. Cook white roux over medium heat 3 minutes stirring with a whisk. Do not brown the roux, as this will destroy the thickening potential. Add the heated liquid (milk for this recipe) all at once and whisk briskly for perfectly smooth sauce in less than a minute. 

I use two hard-boiled eggs per cup of sauce cut two directions in an egg slicer to stir into the sauce. Salt and fresh ground white pepper to taste

Option 1 - reserve one yoke to press through tea strainer for a garnish. Add chopped fresh parsley and a dash of paprika. 

Option 2 - add 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder per cup of sauce.

Option 3 - Serve over fresh baked buttermilk biscuits split, buttered and toasted under the broiler. (Good buttermilk biscuit recipe on this site.)

Caution: Do not introduce saliva into starch sauces with the tasting spoon. Enzympes digest (break down) starches and can cause watery sauce, particularly with cornstarch.

this was delicious.  I made it for a day when I knew I would have to get dinner on the table in a hurry, boiled the eggs the day before and then threw the rest together that night.  My only suggestion is to make sure that you add the milk slowly and give it a good chance to thicken.  This would be just as good (probably better) for breakfast but what can I say, if it's easy and it's tasty, it's dinner in our house!

How lovely to see this recipe appear! My college roommate turned me on to it almost 40 yrs ago.
I do variations on it like many of you.
I want particularly to address the remark that its appearance is "not for company". I disagree! I have served it for special brunches with smoked salmon (lox) and steamed asparagus: The colors together are beautiful and the flavors perfect together. 
I chop and add the whole egg so that the yoke is not fully mixed in; the mixture is spooned over toasted sourdough French bread which I like for its tartness to complement the richness of the other ingredients. The asparagus is laid over the eggs with the salmon on the side. Sprinkle fresh chopped parsley over the eggs.
I use the variations others have noted, and also prefer half and half which is not as sweet as milk.

I admit that this tastes great and is a good use for massive amounts of leftover hard-boiled eggs. However, it looks kind of like something the dog threw up. Definitely not a company dish. I honestly think adding a little mayonnaise to sliced eggs and making egg salad is the better option.

I have a similar recipe that does not use bullion.  Just make a simple white sauce, season with salt & papper and add several shakes of tarragon. I cut the hard boiled eggs, yolks and all, in an egg slicer, as you would for egg salad and stir into the sauce. Delicious over toast or biscuits.

When I was in Home Ec (back in the 60s) this was called "Eggs a la Goldenrod" and was delicious even then.  Thanks for bringing back good memories and a good recipe.

I have never tasted anything quite like this before, but I loved it. Since I don't use bouillon, I replaced it with hot water, and some preferred spices (salt, pepper, and onion powder). I thought it came out wonderfully and pleasant. I can definitely see myself making this again... my boyfriend loved it too =o)

I have been hard-boiling eggs a dozen at a time so I could take one each day to work to eat for breakfast.  About a week ago, I suddenly could no longer look a hard-boiled egg in the face.  This recipe was perfect to use up the rest of the eggs in the refrigerator.  I only had six, so I made up the difference with diced ham and thawed frozen peas.  I used non-fat milk (it's all I had) and added a few dried onion flakes to the milk/boullion mixture which I heated in the microwave to take off the milk's cold edge.  I also added the tiniest dibble of Worchestershire sauce to the dish. I didn't mash the yolks, I'm way too lazy, but it didn't seem to hurt anything.  This was really good and DH said it "hit the spot".  Thanks for the recipe!

My mom used to make this by laying sliced hard boiled eggs and speamed asparagus on the toast and spooning the white sauce over.  Same taste and a little prettier.

This is awesome. My 2 favorite foods as a kid were Creamed Chipped Beef (same sauce, dried beef instead of eggs) and Ham a La King...which is this recipe with ham (also leftover from Easter!) added in. Great for any meal of the day. Thanks!

I had not heard of creamed eggs so I gave it a try for something different on a cold Saturday morning.  It was great!  I served over toasted English Muffins.  Next time I think I will add crumbled sausage or bacon.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and please forgive the rude reviewer that compared the dish to something the dog threw up.  How rude is that!!!

I made this for one. I really loved this recipe and it works fine with skim milk.  I also thought that mustard would be a great addition and tried smearing a little dijon on my toast before adding the egg mixture, and it was a little too much. Way too overpowering. I will try adding a pinch of mustard powder and hot sauce as someone else mentioned.  Super filling!  Make sure to serve immediately - this mixture turns into plaster if you let it sit.

My mom made something similar which she called Eggs Goldenrod.  Instead of chopping the whole egg, she would chop the whites and mix them into the white sauce - then pour this mixture over the toast.  The yolks were grated over the top.

Oh, where have you been all my life?!!! This was SO GOOD!! I recalculated the recipe for 4 servings - used 7 eggs and skim milk. I added a good pinch of fresh nutmeg to the sauce. It made a generous 6 servings (served on 2 slices of toast each). This averages only 1+ eggs per serving which makes this fairly cholesterol friendly. Loved this and will make this often as I have access to lots of farm fresh eggs. Thanks for sharing!

My Mum made this when I was a kid and I have never made it for my kids but will now.  She always put onion (sliced in rings) in the sauce and then cut the eggs in slices and just laid them gently in the sauce before spooning over the toast.  Yum.

We make the white sauce/gravy, toast some bread, slice the eggs on the toast and top with the gravy and some salt and pepper.  This was my husbands special Christmas breakfast, but I also learned to make "eggs a la goldenrod" in jr. high school home ec classes.  I also use the basic receipe to make sausage gravy and biscuits or chipped beef gravy, only I add the flour to the browned sausage or "frizzled " chipped beef, and cook it awhile stirring often to kind of "toast" the flour, gives a nutty-sweet taste to the gravy, my family loves it, and my step-son who is a chef asked for my receipe to make at the restaurant he works in, so must be good. Thanks for the memories.

I grew up on something similar to this!  We had it every year as an Easter breakfast.  Now my own kids look forward to it each Easter too.  (And all year round, for that matter.)  No chicken bouillon for us as we have vegetarians in the house.  We also just slice whole eggs right into the sauce.  (Much easier.)  And to those who said it "looks" bad--I totally disagree!  It is a beautiful chunky white sauce over golden toast.  This is a highly recommended dish that I know most will repeatedly make throughout the year.  (BTW, in the army they made a version, sans the eggs, and instead with ground beef calling it "SOS".  I am sure some military folks will know what that stands for!)

This is SO good.  I've never had them before, and my 5 year old daughter took one look at them and said "ew"... until I told them they were "princess eggs" and the recipe was given to me by a princess.  She cleaned her plate.  This will definitely be on our breakfast (and breakfast-for-dinner) roster!  The only change I made was to add about a tablespoon or two of dijon mustard to the yolks before I mashed them.  Delicious!

I like it best when you pan fry a pound of bacon and take out some of the grease then make the gravy in the skillet. Finish by topping with the crumbled bacon and yellows. We called it "Sunshine Eggs".

Basic good recipe.  I like to save some of the grated egg yoke for a garnish.
Step it up a bit by adding just a dash of cayenne pepper and a few drops of lemon to the sauce.  Or add some dried tarragonto the sauce instead.  
Use toasted English muffins or a coarse artisan bread instead of whit toast

Have been eating this 65+ years, making it the past 49 years for my family and guests.  Never occurred to me that this was not a staple in every household.  Love it with asparagus and frequently add cut pieces of it and/or ham to the egg mixture.  Never thought of the bouillon, but can see where it would offer additional flavor as well as the bacon garnish others have mentioned.  The white sauce/cream sauce is a great beginning for so many great meals: hamburger over potatoes; ham and peas or mixed vegetables over biscuits; chicken or turkey over biscuits or puff pastry.  Just change the ingredients and adjust the seasonings for multiple quick and delicious meals.

Like many of the reviews here, I'm shocked to see an actual recipe for this.  My mom used to make this for me when I was growing up called "Eggs ala Goldenrod".  I thought it was just something she made.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great breakfast!! I used leftover bechamel sauce that is made just like the sauce in this recipe. I left out the chicken bouillon granules all together. Great breakfast at work.

This was fabulous! I followed the directions to a tee and everyone enjoyed these, including my fussy 11-year-old who won't go anywhere near egg yolks-lol. I kept some of the mashed yolks aside to sprinkle over the top as desired because it looks so nice. One thing that i felt was important to mention was that you may not even need salt. I always salt my eggs, but the bouillon makes this dish salty enough. Very important to have people taste before adding more salt. This recipe will be used over and over in my home! Thank so much for posting it. My pictures don't do it justice.

We have chickens.  We got chickens so we could have fresh eggs. This was successful far beyond our expectations, and as a result we are always on the hunt for egg recipes.  Since finding this one about two weeks ago, we've made it 4 times and it is officially our go-to weekend egg breakfast recipe.  We've tried adding different spices and flavorings, and honestly you can't go wrong - dill, Lowery's, cayenne - this sauce takes all suggestions beautifully.

One suggestion:  pull out your handy-dandy stick blender when you go to add the egg yolks to your sauce.  Saves a ton of time and aggravation, and you get a nice smooth sauce.  If you have access to fresh eggs, you're going to LOVE the beautiful golden color those bright egg yolks give the final product!

I grew up with his recipe and am still making it at 71. HERE"S A TWIST though...the children always got to push the yolks through a strainer or small sieve and then they (the yolks not the children) were served in a bowl of their own to sprinkle on the top...if no children are around a grown up can have the fun of pushing the yolks through...I'm not sure it makes it taste any better...but I know it makes it look much fancier and ever so elegant! I have never seen this recipe anywhere...how much fun to see it here.

I made this for dinner tonight for my husband and myself. I just did the recipe as stated and made no adjustments. It was very good all on it's own. Next time I will try adding the mustard powder or the onion rings as another reviewer suggested. It's simple and a nice meal that doesn't require meat so would be great for Fri. lent dinners. I will be fixing it for the grandkids next weekend and see what they think. Thanks for a simple, old fashioned, kind of meal.

When I saw this recipe come up on my computer, my brain got enveloped in a myriad of flashbacks of meals long forgotten.  My Mom used to make this and I loved it!  Could not believe it.  I had completely forgotten about this dish for 50 years.  The only difference is she used to add paprika and dry mustard to it.
I made it and was rewarded with pleasureable memories - not to mention a happy stomache!
Thanks Allrecipes!

My mother used to make this also, under the name of "Eggs al a Golden Rod." She shortened the name to "Egg Goo." All 6 of us kids loved it and still do. Even my daughter loves it. Our version is to mash up the yolks and sprinkle on top of the egg gravy on the toast. My old and beat-up Better Homes and Gardens cookbook also calls this "Eggs a la Golden Rod," and instructs to put yolks on top. These similar recipes do not use the chicken bouillon, but I imagine that is a good addition. This recipe always brings back good memories and makes me hungry for this dish. A must try, if you have never had it.

I was drawn in by the reviews, so I made this last weekend. I'll have to agree with the reviewer who claims that egg salad is a much better use for hardboiled eggs. This is just "egg gravy," no matter the name. I served it over toast and it was just ho-hum. It might shine a little better served over some sort of breakfast potato. I doubt I'll ever make it again.

As usual with a new recipe I made this exactly as written only making 3 servings rather than 6.  My wife's first taste gave me the tip I needed for the next time.. She said it is very much like "eggs benedict"  and it is... I will make this again for a crowd, as an eggs bennedict substitute, english muffins for toast, slice of canadian bacon, bit of lemon and a touch of cyan, topped with a sprinkle of paprika and a slice of black olive. Although it is pretty good as written..

Talk about a trip down memory lane!  As a child, we had this once in awhile for dinner: sometimes after Easter, but once in awhile at other times of the year, and it wasn't until I was married and going through the "lean times" that I realized that she probably made this when there was more month at the end of the money!  She always just sliced the eggs into the sauce, and I doubt she used bouillon (she passed away before I was an adult, so I can't ask), but this brings back many memories. I like the idea of adding sausage to the dish to make it even more "dinner-like"; I might try this with left-over Easter ham this year.  Thanks for the memories!

I scaled this down to 2 servings, and had enough of the egg mixture to top 4 slices of toast. I had never tried anything like this before. Tasty!

I just finished making this recipe for the first time.  I thought it was pretty bland and couldn't find that wow factor.  I tried adding  a little nutmeg, onion powder and more boulion to wake up the flavor but only after I tried the finished recipe.  Even with those additions this dish wasn't anything to rave about.

This was a quick supper for us when I was growing up.  Mother called it "Welsh Rarebit" which I believe was a twist on "Welsh Rabbit".  No rabbit?  Use eggs.  We just sliced the boiled eggs, placed on toast, and covered with sauce, which sometimes had cheese in it also.  Later, I found a recipe that called for beer instead of milk in the sauce.  A nice variation.  This is a definite comfort food for me.

Havent tried this particular version of creamed eggs, but will make it for a brunch with shrimp and chopped asparagus mixed in served over toasted english mufffins with some cheese and paptika sprinkled on top, a pass in the broiler, sparkling wine and fresh fruit on the side. I could see this recipe going many different directions with different meats and vegs. mixed in like cubes of ham and peas or bacon and tomatos etc. Roger

I have made creamed eggs for years and am surprised so few mentioned serving it sprinkled with grated cheddar cheese. Chopped parsley and the grated cheese add flavor and color. It tastes wonderful on 9 grain bread.

I didn't care for the recipe but my son liked it.  I can see how this would be a favorite comfort food if you grew up with it.  Its very bland and filling.  I was bored with it even though I added sausage, salt and pepper.  If I were to make it again I would change a few things to make it more flavorful.  I would definitely add onions, garlic, paprika, and cheese on top.  Plus, less sauce.  I would want the eggs to be the stars but they seemed to be a filler for this recipe instead.

We eat these every Easter!!!  It's a great way to get rid of hard boilded eggs.  When I make it I omit the chicken bouillon and I season it with salt and pepper, onion powder and prepared yellow mustard to taste!!  It's a family favorite every year!!!

LOVE this!! I've been eating Creamed Eggs for as long as I can remember! As another reviewer, I always add peas to the mixture, and don't separate the yolks, just chop the whole egg and add it. Much easier. Never tried it with bullion before, just added my own spices. Very good recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Many years ago when I was in grade school, on Fridays we always had "Eggs Al a Goldenrod".  I always loved it and have made it many times for my kids.  They always loved it and it's also MY "go to" comfort food.  We're retired now (for many years) and I still make it with leftover hardboiled eggs.  I sprinkle paprika over it because it makes it look so pretty.

I too have been making this dish for over 50 years. In the 50's, my mom made this dish for the family and called it "Egg-Ala-Goldenrod". She would make it every Sunday after church. Now my grandkids ask for it every time they come and stay with me. However I was taught to sprinkle the mashed egg yokes on top after the sauce was put on the toast.  She made a simple white sauce (no chicken broth) and used white pepper. With a couple sausages on the side...deeeelicious!!!

My mother used to make this for us when we were kids.  Except she strained the egg yokes through a sieve so they landed on top of the egg whites in the white sauce like a golden blanket.  She called it "Eggs Goldenrod."  We all loved it!  I think I'll make it soon and add a picture!

I prepare the white sauce as usual. Cut up hard-boiled eggs. Steam some fresh asparagus (cut into 1-inch lengths) and add to sauce. Serve over toast as suggested. A great evening meal.

This dish was called Goldenrod Egg on Toast in my house & it was served mainly during Lent.  I don't use bullion & the egg yolks are smashed real fine & sprinkled over the white sauce on the toast.  Very tasty.

Wow!  I had never heard of creamed eggs, boy, was I missing out!  I used leftover Easter eggs to make this for breakfast.  Easy, quick, delicious!  Scaled recipe to 1/2 since I only had 6 eggs.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks Chrissy!

All these years I thought I had a special family recipe. And yet here it is. My family calls it Eggs La Goldenrod.  We don't add the meat just make the gravy, add salt and pepper, chopped hard boiled egg and serve over toast. I will have to try it with meat now after seeing it!

Eggs Goldenrod. I skipped chicken boullion (it's made of yucky stuff), but added 2 slices of cheese into the melting mix and a shake of garlic and/or onion powder. I used toasted english muffins and spooned the eggwhite mix onto the muffins, topped with the crushed egg yolks. Sprinkle with paprika. Voila.!

My family recipe was very similar, medium white sauce with chopped egg whites in sauce served over toast.  Take reserved egg yolks and force through strainer with back of spoon causing the egg yolks to become light and fluffy.  Be sure to scrape the strinter to remove as much egg yolk as possible.  Very pretty and people can't guess how you got the egg yolks into "goldenrods" thus the name.  Enjoy!!!

I was also raised with eggs goldenrod.  The colored Easter eggs add a nice  variety of color for Easter breakfast.  We don't use the bouillon. But we always save some egg yolk for crumbling on top - that is the golden rod.  It works well on English muffins.  Sometimes we add mushrooms and peas to make more of a supper dish.  My kids, now grown, are sure to pass this tradition on to the fifth generation.

Everyone loves this for breakfast!!  But I have an easier/faser alturnative to it.    6 hardboiled eggs (or if you like more add a few more) 1 can of Cream of Chicken soup  1 can of Milk  Boil the eggs.  When they are done boiling, let them sit in a pan of cold water.  As they are cooling, mix the cream of chicken soup and milk in a sauce pan and heat.  Peel the eggs, then cut them up in chunks, and mix in with soup mixture.  Heat through.  While that is heating, toast your bread and butter it.  You can cut the bread up in chuncks or leave it whole; serve egg/soup mixture over toast.  Sometimes I use bisquits instead of bread.  You can also use english muffins.  Absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!

HA!  What a surprise to find this recipe here.  This has been a favorite since I was little, and is now a favorite of my 20-year-old.  I don't bother with the bouillon or mashing the yolks--just make the white sauce and chop up the eggs--heaven.  I also like to add a little curry, not for the heat, but for the smell.  Num!  Also, I would not hesitate to feed to company--everyone who has had this dish loves it.

I learned how to make this dish in home-ec in high school....in 1955!  I haven't seen this recipe since then.  I believe we sifted the yolks thru a strainer, which was a pain.  This way is much easier.  A really tasty way to use hard boiled eggs.

Found this recipe today as I was looking for a relatively quick and easy meal.  I've never heard of creamed eggs before, but the reviews sold me.  This is a real treat!  I added a shake of garlic/ramono cheese to egg mix, boy that took it over the top.  I can see making this recipe a lot.  Thanks Chrissy!

My mom has made this for us for more than 50 years.  It's still one of my favorite things that she makes.  Instead of mashing the yolks and stirring them into the cream sauce, she places them into a fine seive and pushes them through to sprinkle over the creamed eggs after it's over the toast.  It looks really pretty with the yellow yolks over the white cream sauce.  I think I'm going to make this for dinner tonight!

Love this recipe!!  My mother has made creamed eggs on toast my whole life.  It's one of my faves, but doesn't quite appeal to my husband (the way my mom made it....flour gravy with sliced eggs in it).  So this recipe satisfies the hubs that wants more of a substantial gravy.  I serve it over biscuits or toast.  
A great add in is to make it with bacon grease (in addition to or instead of butter) and top with crumbled bacon.  Divine!

So happy to have found this recipe!  My grandfather used to make this, with his own little twist and we all called it "Eggs a la Adrian".  I remember his being a little mustard-y (his twist) and it was delicious!  So happy to have this recipe!  Great recipe to allow you to put your own twist on it, and also great as is!

Creamed Easter Eggs!!  I grew up eating this!  We had it once a year on Easter. Mom would set some colored eggs aside in the fridge and then the egg mixture would have colored pieces. 
We set the yolks aside and grated in the yolk to taste in the sauce. Serve some grated yolk on top for "golden rod" Salt & pepper.

Saves well for the next day.

This was alright, a nice change from our typical scrambled eggs, bacon and toast breakfasts.  I would probably make this again occasionally, but I don't consider it a favorite.

I have been making this recipe since I was very young (in my sixties now). I haven't used the chicken bouillon before but certainly will try it. The other thing I do different is to spoon the cream sauce over the toast and then add sliced boiled eggs instead of crumbling them into the sauce. I doubt that it makes any difference in the flavor of the dish. Like the other reviewers say, it is a very versatile dish and can be easily modified; after all, it is simply a basic cream sauce that every cook uses at some point in time.

I never had this before, it was really good, kinda a twist on egg salad. I liked the chicken bouillon in it. I think I already memorized the recipe I liked this so much.

I grew up on this but my mom would put the yolks through a small sieve to sprinkle over the mixture . she called it eggs ala goldenrod  it does make for better presentation. Sometimes she'd add peas hence creamed peas over toast. Yummy

My husband credits his Mother for this recipe, and he spreads the toast with chunky peanut or almond butter then tops with the creamed eggs - sounds horrible, but try it - pretty delicious - even for me who does not care much for peanut butter. Also, curry powder is a delicious addition to this recipe.

my only problem with the recipe is the chick bullion.... your basically making a rue.  I would just use chicken stock and milk to make the rue, but I like the premise of this recipe and it sounds good.

Have been making creamed eggs for years but I don't mash the yolks - I merely add sliced hard cooked eggs to a bechamel sauce and serve the entire thing over steamed asparagus on toast.  What a wonderful spring luncheon!

It looks real good, except whole wheat bread is better for you, and switch the bacon for any other meat or non-meat protein.

This is a great beginning recipe that lets you add or subtract ingredients as you like. I've been making it for years, minus the bullion, PLUS a good dose of curry powder, and quite often with less eggs.

I cut this in half and used a mixture of whole evaporated milk (I had an open can to use up) and skim milk - it's great! Very warm and satisfying. I've been eating the leftovers for breakfast. Thanks so much!

I have had this recipe since childhood (back in the 1950's).  The only thing different was serving it over broken up Saltene Crackers instead of toast.  It is delicious!  Easy meatless entree.

For the reviewer who said it looked like something the dog threw up, instead of following the directions for the eggs in the recipe, slice them as suggested by one other reviewer, but then just put the slices on buttered toast and pour basic white sauce over all.  Looks nice and taste fantastic!

This is a great recipe, my stepmother used to make this for us, but she called it s* on a shingle (I know, far less appeitizing than creamed eggs on toast).  She used dried beef plus the eggs.  It was so creamy and delicious, can't wait to try it with bacon!

I'd give it a 5, I loved it. Hubby gives it a 3, says it's missing something. The only change I made was adding some cubed ham and serving over english muffins. Hubby's suggestion was whole ham (ala canadian) and some kind of cheese. Very easy to make, but likely won't make it again (even though I think it was great)

The original of this does not include the chicken boullion.  It was put in 1937 Betty Crocker cookbook as Eggs & Goldenrod.  It is a family tradition for Christmas morning here :-)

This is something I grew up with only my mother served it over mashed potatoes.  It's terrific served that way as well as over toast.  Also great poured over steamed asparagus.  Try it as many different ways as you can think of..........

This is even good for breakfast, and reminds me a little bit of the flavor of Eggs Benedict. My aunt just made it today, try using equal parts flour to butter, YUMMY! It's really addictive. A sprinkle of crumbly egg yolks on top looks really pretty. (also my aunt adds cheese to hers)

I eat this every Easter morning. I have never used chicken bullion in my recipe but always use real butter and put the creamed eggs over buttered toast. One of those childhood traditions my entire family dose. Gets rid of a lot of the Easter eggs too.

The recipe is too bland for my taste.  I like the idea of serving the creamed eggs over steamed asparagus. I alter the basic recipe by adding curry powder to taste when making the roux and serve this variation over rice with  mangeo chutney as a condiment. I've been making this curry recipe for years - a family comfort food...

Truly comfort food and a many years family tradition for us. When I stay home from work and play hooky, I always make this. It's loaded with tons of fat and calories, and don't use skim or low fat milk either. The creamier the better, and white sauce should be creamy and not stiff and glue like. Don't forget a generous amount of salt cuz sause it just butter, flour, and milk with not a whole lot of spice. We eat on toasted white bread, sauce on top, yolks crumbled on top, then gobble up. For men in the military, they know it as S*#$@t on a Shingle!!

I've never had creamed eggs on toast before but I absolutely LOVED it and will make it often!  Only thing is I needed a bit more butter to make a nice roux.  Thank you so much for sharing this simple comfort food!

I did add finely diced ham as other review had said...It doesn't look as bad as I thought it would but tasted GREAT. Good comfort food/great for budget. I do (as other reviewer) keep hard boiled eggs on hand for salads, breakfast, etc.

Wonderful recipe! I halved the recipe for two people, added a little extra milk, more than a few dashes of Louisiana hot sauce, about 1 tsp kosher salt (or 1/2 tsp regular salt) and 1/2 tsp of pepper to the gravy. So yummy! I will definitely make this again.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe. Did everything the recipe says. At the end, I added cubed ham from a leftover ham I ha made. Anyway, after reading what the recipe said, reading review, that what I was looking for to use with my ham. Mom use to make it when I was a little girl. Miss you mom!

I made it without the bouillon cube... I worried it would be too savory.  Other than that this was exactly how I remember my mom and grandmother making it.   It was delish!

Very tasty recipe! I halved the recipe and it turned out great. Super easy to follow which is awesome because I like speedy dinners. Only thing changed is my husband added paprika to his meal and absolutely loved it. Will definitely make this again.

I really like the addition of the bouillon. That adds a nice flavor. I didn't add any more salt since the bouillon already has so much. I will definitely make this again!

Wow! Creamed eggs?  Who knew? But you see, it turns out that some magical enchantment strikes the pot when the mashed yolks are stirred into the sauce - to 'dissolve' into the sauce as Chrissy put it! At that moment when they were almost fully 'dissolved', I sensed success, but was admittedly still nervous about my family. No need to fret, though. This was really amazing.... Not filet mignon, but still really, really good. GARNISH? Loved the bacon in the pic, but had none. Used paprika, S&P. Served with a tossed salad on the side. PROBLEM?  Only with the bread that we used - it was a tad too sweet for this nice sauce.  CHANGES DOWN THE ROAD?  1) Since this is actually an easy way to serve eggs to a crowd, I'm strongly considering putting a full batch in the bottom of a casserole or ramekins, topping with biscuits (no sweet'sh ones though), and baking this until the biscuits are cooked through.  I'm thinking the eggs won't get tough...., will let you know.  2) will try to sub or combine some of the additions from other recipes, such as ham, veggies, parmesan, or curry with or instead of the broth crystals: but will keep this AMAZING TECHNIQUE of stirring in the yolks 'to dissolve them'.  Great recipe, Chrissy! And not just a seasonal recipe either!  Thanks so much!

Delicious! I made as written except used skim milk instead of whole and added ¼ cup Marsala wine for ¼ cup of the milk. Next time I'll try Sherry instead of Marsala, and a little curry powder would also be a nice addition. We ate this over my husband's homemade popovers. Loved it!

Omit the chicken bouillon  and it would taste just like the meal my mom made. I think the thicker chunks of egg are better, both yolk and whites stirred in at the end are good

Okay I cannot believe I came across this recipe. Other than a few differences in the eggs (since we put in the whole egg, sliced - not separating whites/yolk)and using chicken bouillon. It's our family recipe..except we never use measurements!! I've never actually saw a recipe for creamed eggs on toast before.  This recipe is great; however, I probably will go back to just slicing the eggs, some things just are "creature" comforts!

I have eaten and made this recipe for years.  I add some fresh nutmeg, just a touch, and I do not add the yolk to the white sauce though.  Instead, I mash up the yolks with a fork and sprinkle over the top of the sauce on the toast.  Looks nice also instead of what one viewer commented!

This was Delicious. My roommate is a really picky eater, but we both ended up loving it. It worked well with our college budget, we had all ingredients on hand, and is a nice change from spaghetti and top ramen.

These were yummy. I used less egg yolks than what was called for and they still tasted very good. I used toasted rolls since I was low on sliced bread and they were excellent. I will make these again and next time I was thinking I will use to buttermilk biscuits. Hubby and kids LOVED these. a great way to use up hard boiled left over easter eggs :)

I have been making this too for years for my son. Never thought i would see a recipe for it.  People have always thought it odd when I talked about it.  The only thing I do different is I make it after Christmas with leftover turkey.  Turkey, creamed gravy with the hardboiled eggs over bread, Heaven.  We call it Turkey Ala King!!

I also have been making this dish for 40+ years.  We always had this, at my Pa and Grandma's, every Easter, after we had been to sunrise service.  Our version was to use an egg slicer and slice the eggs then make a simple white sauce and add the eggs and stir until the eggs were warmed.  Over the years I have been adding chopped chipped beef (the kind that comes in little packages where the sandwich meat, like bologna, is in your gorcery) or crumbled browned sausage to the egg mixture.  It is wonderful comfort food.

I'm so excited to see this. My mom made it a lot when I was a child. I had not thought about it in years. She used dry mustard and threw in some peas. Thanks so much for reminding me of my childhood. I plan to make this soon.

I also have been making this for years.  My mother served it to us when we were younger.  The only thing we do different is: we don't use bouillon granules and we add canned peas.  I don't have a recipe for it, we just throw it together.  My husband just loves it!!!

My mother has made this for us for years and she called it egg a la goldenrod as well!  I thought it was something she made up.  Glad to see others loving it too.  We make it without the bouillon and it tastes great.

Awesome recipe! I spooned some over toast and someover bacon wrapped aspargus. I'll make this again in smaller portions since my daughter hates eggs.

I had a lot of left over hard boiled eggs, so I decided to try this.  It's really good, but really rich.

This went over pretty well with my family. I think next time I would add bacon and maybe cut back the chicken bouillon a bit.

The method of mashing the yolks and adding them to the cream sauce before the chopped whites caught my eye...I liked that the sauce was a sunny yellow color instead of just a pasty white sauce.  I did find that I needed to use slightly more butter for the roux, less flour, and more milk to make it the proper consistency for my preference.  Crumbled bacon added flavor and made for a nicer presentation.

Had 14 eggs, so we threw them all in.  This was delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing!

My family has been making this recipe since my Great Grandma. We only make it on Easter.  As Eater approaches we all start drooling. We don't use the bouillon.  Everything else is the same and you must have the white pepper, black specks ruins the look.  We use the kid’s dyed egg that cracked and have little spots of colors makeing it pretty.

Nice change for eggs. I added ham as one other reviewer did. My husband thought it was good. I think if I had omitted the ham, it would have been an okay breakfast.

Only giving this 3 stars cause it might have been the cook who made it.I boiled the eggs on Sunday,thinking I would make this recipe for dinner.Hubby brought home some prepared Mexican food,so the eggs got put into the frig. Two days later I made this recipe and was totally disappointed. As I said,it could be the cook but it just didn't taste the way I thought or hoped it would taste.Hubby said it was good but he rarely says he does not like whatever I cook.(lucky me).

Who would have thought??  Creamed eggs are the original comfort food around our house.  My Mom has made since long before I was born..and that's been a few years and I still continue the  tradition and have passed it on to my girls.  Our recipe calls for chopping and adding the entire egg. We have never bothered to press through a sieve or anything else.  Just the eggs in a white sauce made of butter and flour roux, milk, salt and pepper.   Good way to stretch a few eggs to feed more when nedded and the ultimate comfort food.  Thanks for sharing.

I have made a similar recipe for years by making a white sauce with salt & pepper seasoning plus what ever herb you may like.  But I also add cubed ham.  Served over toast it makes a complete meal.  I occasionally serve it for a lunch or dinner as well.

This recipe has been in our family for years and although we do not use the chicken boullion or add the cooked yolks to the sauce, it is delic!  We put the cooked yolks through a potato ricer and sprinkle it over the creamed eggs on toast.  Yummy--a definite favorite!

This was a winner in our house!  Makes quite a lot and doesn't re-heat too well but otherwise, delicious.
