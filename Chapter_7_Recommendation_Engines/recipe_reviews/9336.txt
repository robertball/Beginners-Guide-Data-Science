I made this as written, and we enjoyed it. However, if I were to make it again, I would use a hot tangy English mustard (we could barely taste the Dijon), decrease the amount of honey (too sweet for my taste), and use more pecans and less breadrcrumbs (making it more crunchy and flavorsome). The '10 minute per inch of thickness' baking suggestion was absolutely spot-on. Thank you, Christine!

Really good.  After I mixed the mustard, butter and honey I refrigerated it for about 15 minutes so that it thickened.  It stayed on the salmon better as it was not so runny.  Then I pressed the bread crumb mixture into it.  I also used a little extra parsley for more color.

I am completely addicted to this! I used already prepared honey mustard (I bought from tastefully simple), mixed the bread crumbs in with the mustard mixture it was FANTASTIC!  Thank goodness my Dad goes Salmon fishing & shares his catch with me (it's best with fresh Salmon). Thanks so much Chris, this is better than what I've paid $25 for in a resturant!

There is one word to describe this dish--             Delicious! 
I added a little garlic powder to the mustard and honey sauce, marinated it about an hour, than added the bread crumbs and pecans prior to baking.

EASY!!!!  Very classy and delicious!!  I make it all the time---I keep a container of the pecan topping in my freezer.  All I do is spoon on the mustard and sprinkle on the ready-made topping and bake. Awesome.

Easy to prepare and nice taste.  I used walnuts instead of pecans.  This recipe is very similar to the Baked Dijon Salmon recipe on this site as well.

My husband and I both loved this dish!  I halved the recipe and used a 1-pound fillet instead of the six small ones.  There was a little bit too much mustard--next time I will add a bit more honey and take away a bit of mustard.  But we will definitely be making this again.  And it's so easy!

DE-LI-CIOUS!!! Such a great, tasty and elegant recipe, and so easy to make!!!. I reserved some of the mustard-honey mixture, and served in on top of the salmon once it was done. My 22 month old daughter LOVED it, thanks for a great recipe!

Fabulous!  Compares to a superb salmon dinner in a seafood restaurant.  We all loved it.
However, I only used about half of the sauce. Will make less next time.

I've been making this recipe since 2002. It's my daughter's favorite meal. I serve it to guests as well as just the family, and it always gets rave reviews. Be sure to use fresh parsley instead of dried - there's a definite difference in flavor. I always use a 2 pound center cut piece of salmon and prepare it early. After putting the topping on the fish, I refrigerate it. I also prepare twice baked potatoes ahead of time and refrigerate those along with asparagus coated with olive oil and garlic salt. When dinner time rolls around, I bake the salmon and potatoes and grill the asparagus on a grill pan - dinner in 20 mins with no fuss! Great for company!

I love seafood and this recipe is headed straight to my top 5 seafood favorites! I recommend making it just the way it's written the first time. I see a lot of reviewers suggesting a bit more of this, less of that, and I understand that we all have our own preferences, but really this was very good as written and the perfect baseline, even if you do tweak a bit.

A very elegant salmon! This was wonderful and great tasting. Preparation time was approximate and everything was easy to prepare.  I did tone down on the amount of mustard to 2 T, and butter to 2T, melted. I increased the honey to sweeten up the sauce (personal preference). I seasoned the salmon with a little sea salt and black pepper and then marinated the salmon in the honey, butter, mustard for 6 hours. In a food processor I pulsed fresh italian parsley, 1/4 cup white bread crumbs, and 1 cup organic raw pecans. I pressed the crumb mixture into the salmon before baking at 400 degrees. It took a little longer in baking time because I had thicker cuts of salmon. The results were absolutely amazing! The salmon was light, flaky, sweet and flavorful. I could taste a subtle hint of the dijon mustard. The pecans added a nice texture to the coating of salmon. I served this over a bed of, "Quick and Easy Sautee Spinach," and "Mushroom Rice," all from this website. I will put this in my recipe box and make this again!

I had everything to make this and it was patiently waiting in my Recipe Box.  Yes, this is so easy!  I followed the recipe exactly and it is truly wonderful!  The only thing I'll do different is to marinate the salmon with the butter, mustard, honey mixture.  Thank you Chris for a new favorite!  UPDATE DEC 2011:  Marinate was very tender but I really didn't notice much of a flavor change - so I'll save time by not marinating as the recipe is originally written.

It's been a while since I've been amazed by a recipe, but I was truly impressed by this one!  I did not change a thing.  The cooking time is perfect - no over cooked fish here.  I crumbled a slice of whole wheat for the fresh bread crumbs.  I served the fish on a bed of baby spinach sauteed with evoo, garlic, fresh black pepper, and really good quality coarse sea salt.  I also made the Basic Beurre Blanc (French white wine cream sauce), which tied in all the flavors perfectly.  I thought this dish would be a culinary stretch for my hubby, but he finished a huge piece despite not being too hungry.  I wish I could give this 10 stars for being so simple with ingredients and quick with the prep & cooking time.  Fish, spinach, and sauce were on the table in 30 minutes.

Oh boy was this good!  I used chopped walnuts and pistachios with the breadcrumbs, and mixed in dried parsley as I didn't have any fresh.  I also substituted some sugar for the honey as I was out (and the sugar was to taste as I don't like too much sweetness). Served with mushy peas and a glass of Chardonnay, it was a terrific - and easy - meal. Will definitely make again.

Oh my God! This recipe is AWESOME!! I generally don't like salmon but this had an incredible taste - definitely a keeper! I used fresh breadcrumbs cut into roughly 0.5-1cm pieces which gave the salmon such an amazing mouth-watering texture. Can't wait to make it again!

The only thing I did differently about this recipe is I used 4tsp of agave nectar (WAY lower glycemic index than honey) instead of 5tsp, because so many people had warned about its being too sweet.  It was a little bit sweet, but I thought the sharpness of the mustard balanced it well.  Also I would highly recommend serving this dish with wild rice - the nutty, heavy flavor of the rice complemented the crisp, sweet topping so, so well.

Made it for Christmas, was a hit! it was literally gone within 10 minutes! I've made this 3 times already. I've found it works well on Tilapia too, but I prefer the original recipe with salmon.

This recipe was wonderful as written.  I did not make any changes.  When the salmon was ready to put in the oven, we had a slight delay and it sat out at room temp. for about 20 minutes with the topping on it. This helped to moisten the crumbs slightly and made for a nice crispy topping that did not fall off the fish. I will do that on purpose when I make this again.

Quite flavorful. I'm going to rate it 5 stars for flavor, but when I make it again, I think it needs minor changes to be considered out of this world. First of all, for 6 pieces of salmon, the mustard/honey mixture should be doubled to easily coat all of the fish. Don't mess with the proportions because the sweet/sour flavor was perfect. FYI, I used the course ground dijon which I think made it extra flavorful. Secondly, the breadcrumbs were a little overwhelming, so I would recommend decreasing maybe by half. In fact I had trouble sprinkling the pecan breadcrumb mixture because the breadcrumbs would clump together. I think it may be easier to coat in breadcrumbs first, and then sprinkle the parsley and nuts on top. I will definitely make this again...oh, and my 4yr old son even gobbled it up!

I didn't find that the coating added much to the salmon.  I liked the addition of the dijon flavour but unfortunately, my husband doesn't like mustard and so that was what he liked the least.  So, this recipe wasn't for us.

Hubby loved this!  Personally, I thought it was a little heavy on the mustard, but the appearance of the dish was awesome, and I can decrease the mustard a tad the next time I make it.  I used panko and omitted the salt and pepper.  The mustard added enough salt for our palates.

this is my favourite fish dish! i often make it with a white fish, such as halibut or snapper. instead of coarse bread crumbs (which my supermarket doesn't carry??), i'll use salad croutons! sometimes instead of pecans, i'll use pistachios! i discovered they're absolutely delicious in this recipe when i forgot to buy pecans, but had some pistachios on hand. the most important thing with the nuts is to always toast them!! this is a great base recipe to play with! its a keeper!!

Very, very good. Instead of honey, used maple syrup, and instead of pecans I used almonds, with fantastic results. Will certainly make again.

Great recipe!
Only suggestion would be to broil the salmon rather than bake.. so that it evenly crusts and not just the sides. The flavor was great.. my husband loved it. We served it with a hot orzo pasta salad. Thanks!!

10 stars if I could.... this is to die for.  Made it as written, with Panko (sp?) bread crumbs.  Oh, did use cilrento instead of parsley,  then made a Pico Di Galo to serve along side of it.  Also brown rice, fesh corn on the cob, and brussel spouts.  It was GREAT - my husband raved all night.  I also just used a large salmon, not individual fillets.  -  Whats nice about this is it is simple enough for dinner, but elegant enought for company.  Very impresive.

Great base recipe that you add your own touches to.  I bought a whole fillet with skin on (about 1 1/4 lbs) and sliced it into 8 portions.  Sprinkled fish with salt, pepper, and smoked paprika.  I didn't measure the butter, honey, and mustard mixture - just did it to taste.  Put it on the fish and let it "marinate" in the fridge for a couple of hours.  Toasted the pecans then chopped them in the food processor.  Left out the breadcrumbs and pressed the pecans into the mustard mixture.  Cooking time was perfect.  Absolutely amazing!

Made it as written for dinner tonight.  It was delicious.  Thanks so much for showing me a new way to prepare salmon.  I was given many salmon cutlets (I usually cook with fillets) and this recipe worked really well.  We had the salmon with steamed zucchini and carrots.

This is awesome!  I substitute olive oil for the butter.  The coating  freezes well - I quadruple the coating, divide it, and freeze it in zip locs to save time for future meals.

I suggest pressing in the bread crumb pecan   mixture on the salmon after sprinkling it on so it won't fall off while serving.

This recipe was a huge hit, and it was so easy!!! I took the advice of marinating the salmon for 2 hours before baking it.  I also substituted Fresh Bread Crumbs for Parmesan Bread Crumbs and it turned out faboulous.  We had company over for dinner and EVERYONE loved it!! Thank you Christine for sharing this recipe!!

Hi Chris,
This recipe was exceptional, and exceptionally easy too!  I used 8 oz. center cut salmon filets, brushed them with the butter mix, and then coated with the crumbs.  I did this early in the day, and just popped it into the oven at dinner.  I baked it using a "slow roast" technique.  Twenty five minutes at 250 degrees.  One other tweaking---instead of 1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs, I used 1/2 cup of dried plain bread crumbs.  I processed the breadcrumbs with the pecans, until a moist meal consistency. Four happy diners last night!
Much thanks,
Jeff

I love salmon and this recipe for it! But instead of adding honey and the dijon mustard separate, I just bought the French's Dijon honey mustard. I forgot to add the lemon wedges which would have added an extra zing to the dish but overall very tasty!

Wow!  This was amazing!  I would highly recommend it!  I bought some fresh salmon filets and put the mustard/honey mix in the fridge for 30 minutes to thicken.  Instead of baking them I put them on a wooden cedar plank on the grill and they were amazing!

To die for! We can't eat wheat but we chop up Barbara's O's cereal for the bread crumbs which works great. I made this for Christmas dinner with this beautiful black rice and brussel sprouts w/apples. It was like we were eating at a fancy restaurant.

This will be one of my go-to recipes when we have company.  It is elegant, delicious, and super easy to prepare.  I also prepared the honey-mustard-butter mixture an hour ahead and let the filets soak in it.  Also, I might take another reviewer's advice and increase the pecans while decreasing the breadcrumbs slightly in the crust mixture to make it a bit more crunchy.  But you can't beat this dish.  I served it with brussel sprouts roasted in Meyer's lemon-infused olive oil and the "Garlic Mashed Red Potatoes" also from this site.  To die for...

If I could give this 10 stars I would!!!
My family sayd I am going to "wear this recipe out!" I swap sliced almonds for the pecans & cut the butter back a bit or sometimes simply brush with olive oil & put honey/mustard mixture on .......takes me minutes to prepare now & 20 mins in the oven.....great for dinner parties or everyday..when I have guests over I always print off the recipe before they coma as I know they're going to ask for it once they've eaten!

This recipe is amazing! It has become a staple in our house. I use equal parts butter, mustard, and honey and then dip the whole piece of salmon through the mustard mixture and then into the crumb mixture. I also use whole wheat/multigrain bread(I save all the end pieces and make crumbs out of them cause no one likes to eat them) as it gives more flavor and is a bit more health concious, as well as either whole almonds or pecans, and then just run it all through the food processor with the parsly to make the crumbs. delicious!!!

My family likes this very much.  I don't change a thing, though I eyeball everything.  My 11 yr old and 13 yr old claim they don't like fish and usually grumble when I serve it to them.  However, they gobble this up with no left overs (and I make almost double the recommended portion).  - I serve this with Japanese-Style Sesame Green Beans (from this site) and linguine in an Alfredo sauce.

This came out beautiful! I made as written but we only used two salmon fillets so I really coated the fish with the Dijon/honey mixture. We are saving the rest of eh pecan/bread crumb mix to put on pork chops tomorrow. We may make the entire mix again.

Easy and Delicious.   I LOVED this dish, and will definitely make this over and over again!  Very flavorful!  I did marinate the salmon in the mustard/honey/butter sauce for about 11/2 hrs. before I added the topping.  I removed the skin and brushed the sauce onto the underside of the fish as well. I used panko bread crumbs along with the pecans and parsley. Otherwise,  I followed the recipe and it turned out wonderful.  One of the best recipes I've found on here.

I really enjoyed this but my boyfriend LOVED it- we are at a bit of a disadvantage because we are landlocked, so we used frozen salmon- and we are salmon snobs (moved from the PacNW), and this recipe made it pretty darn decent- also pretty easy to make

I decided to try this recipe out to give Dijon a second shot. To be honest, I don't care for it. This recipe did it no justice. I will def try this again, but without the Dijon.

This recipe is always a winner.  If you have the fish cut into individual servings; it will not only taste delicious but look extremely appetizing as well.  I have made this recipe twice....once with dried bread crumbs and once with fresh.  It came out wonderfully both times.

This dish was excellent! Restaurant quality, in my opinion. I made it for my uncle's 50th Birthday and it was a huge hit. I only added about a third of the amount of honey the recipe called for as none of my family are big fans of sweets. Also, it worked better to just soften the butter rather than melt it. It spread very easily on the salmon that way. Thanks for the great recipe!

Throw out all of your salmon recipes and use nothing but this!! It is most awesome.  My husband had something similar to this in a restaurant and I've been trying to duplicate it.  This is even better.  We love honey mustard, so used it instead of Dijon.  You rock Chris!!

This is so easy to make and tastes like something you'd eat at a fine restaurant (I was moved to even garnish our dinner plates with parsley, the entree looked so good!). Served with rice pilaf, a great match for stray pecans from the topping (which my son had the audacity to scrape off).

This recipe has a really great mix of flavors. I followed the recipe exactly as it said and it worked out perfectly. I love the salty-sweet, crunchy-soft, salmon, honey, mustard, and pecan combination.

I made this, although the salmon was good and moist, I think i went wrong by using Italian bread crumbs instead of plain. Please dont use the italian just use plan or make some from scratch. The other honey mix and italian bread crumbs were not a good combination .Will try again with plain. Otherwise it prob wouldve been much better.

Nice change of pace from grilled salmon.  I added some cayenne and garlic powder sauce for some added zip.  I added panko bread crumbs since they are crunchier.  Lastly, sprayed some cooking spray on top and broiled for a few minutes to get more crunch.  Would make this recipe again.

I made this exactly as listed except I spread the honey mustard sauce on top of fish and let it sit (covered) in fridge for an hour or more because I was having a guest and wanted everything done ahead of time. When I was ready I spread the crumb mixture on top and baked like instructed. THIS FISH WAS DELICIOUS!!! I DEFINITELY will make this again and not change a thing!
NOTE: remove skin from salmon before cooking! You can see a demo on UTube video.

This recipe was fantastic!!!  Good suggestion about putting the honey butter mix in fridge to cool.  Should use a rough chop on the pecans.  I used a high speed processer and the pecans turned to dust!  The glaze is perfect.  Also use a piece of foil to line the pan to make clean up easier.  Will use this recipe again.  Loved it.  Thanks.

FANTASTIC! I used seasoned bread crumbs, honey dijon mustard & I coated all sides of the salmon w/ the honey mustard mixture & pecan mixture. I converted the recipe down to 4 & then only used 3 salmon. Next time I will make more of the honey mustard mixture to drizzle on teh pecan coated salmon. I served this w/ an apple cranberry salad, Harvest Yams (definitely one of my better pairings...the flavors were a  wonderful complement to each other) &  fresh rolls....cranberry pie II for dessert. Thansk for a wonderful recipe Christine L.!

Nice recipe. I served it with the mashed sweet potatoes on this website as a side, and they compliment each other nicely. I think next time I'll mix just a tiny bit of olive oil into the dry mixture- not enough to make it wet or soggy, but just to get the dry stuff to hold together on the fish a little better. Will make this again. Thanks for the recipe, Christine!

Great potential! I tossed the topping with a little melted butter - made it very rich. Next time I am going to try something savory rather than the honey-mustard - maybe garlic & butter.  I must have used too much honey/mustard mixture because it ran off the fish and burned in the pan before the salmon was cooked thru. I think this would also be really good on chicken!

It made salmon lovers out of the entire family and those who I shared the recipe with as well.
Don't wait until Christmas to make this.  Once a year isn't enough when you are taking as great as this recipe is!

It tastes good, but the coating is kind of heavy.  If I'm going to put anything on salmon, I'd prefer a teriyaki glaze and sesame seeds.  Contrary to what another reviewer said, a good restaruant would be serving good salmon that doesn't need to be covered up like this.

FABULOUS!!! EASY!! I didn't have honey so I used Log Cabin syrup instead - it was so good I'm reluctant to use honey. I used Panko bread crumbs vs. regular bread crumbs - again fabulous! Tonight I'm going to use the honey (now that I have it) and I have some Hazelnuts that I want to try in place of the pecans. This recipe makes the best salmon I've ever eaten!

I made this dish for thanksgiving as an entree for my vegetarians.  It was very easy to make and to prep.  I rinsed the fish and laid them out on a cookie sheet and salt and pepper them about two hours before cooking them which helped a lot with timing all the elements of the meal. I personally don't eat fish but I make a lot of it when entertaining.  From what I was told it was delicious.  The topping made it a bit difficult to determine if the fish was done.  It also didn't look as appealing as the picture from the recipe because I used all of the topping that I made per the recipe.  If I make this again I would make less topping and I would chop the pecans and bread more coarsely strictly for presentation.  I gave it 4 stars based on taste per my guests and how quick and easy this was to make.

I loved this recipe.  At first I thought the flavors fought each other; the mustard overpowering the salmon.  I changed my mind when I had it again the next day.  Didn't have pecans so used macadamia nuts.  The salmon was baked perfectly, the topping was sweet, buttery and tangy, and the nuts added a crunchy texture.

I made this using halibut instead of salmon.  I also used panko rather than fresh breadcrumbs.  As another reviewer suggested I refrigerated the mustard mixture, which allowed it to thicken.  It then stayed on the fish nicely, instead of running off.  After assembling this I thought it looked a little dry (no doubt due to using panko) so I drizzled it with a little butter just before popping it in the oven.  My halibut was only about a half inch thick but it still took more like 15-20 minutes to bake.  We enjoyed this and I would make it again.  Although if I use panko again, I will toss the topping in melted butter before topping the fish, instead of drizzling it on after.  Good recipe!

Made it as instructed, with one minor alteration:  placed filet on top of lemon slices for baking.  

Oh... And I used a side instead of individual filets.

Deelicious, my family loved it. Very easy to make;  I added garlic powder to the mix and will definitely make this again.  A delicious coating, I want to try it with different nuts next time, I'm sure it will be superb as well.

A new staple in my kitchen!  The dijon works wonders with the natural flavors of the Salmon.  My hubby LOOOOVES it!  And the kicker, he hates mustard and anything to do with mustard.  
After finshing this off for a second time, he states, "Wow, i just love this flavor!" 

Keeping the ingredients to myself on this one!! 

Enjoy!!

I didn't actually try this dish cause I'm slowly tryign to adjust myself to fish and seafood (didn't grow up with it so I find it a aquired taste). My husband loves this though and he said this was awesome. I made it for him for dinner and lunch he liked it so much. I will give it a try, the ingredents look great for someone like me to try a fish dish with.

The flavor was fine, but it overpowered the natural flavor of the salmon.  If you've got some nice fish, it seems like a bit of a waste.

I made this dish and my boyfriend who doesn't really like salmon even enjoyed it.  I made a little extra sauce and after I finished cooking the salmon, I drizzled it over top.  It was great.  Will definitely make again!

Great recipe! I was very impressed. I made the recipe as posted. I think my preference would be to go with 2 parts pecans to 1 part bread crumbs.  Definately worth a try! Making it again next week!

Absolutely the BEST fish recipe out there. Even company who don't like fish say it's great. I did make a few changes. I add two tbsp of mayo to my mustard mixture and then refrigerate it until all other ingredients are prepared. I substituted ritz cracker crumbs for the bread crumbs and double the pecans. And then I roll the fish in the honey mixture and then roll them in the crumb mixture. Drizzle with the butter and bake. Absolutely awesome.

This was a very easy recipe with a great taste! We did as another reviewer suggested and used the honey mustard instead of making it ourselves. When I make this again, though, I plan not to chop the pecans up as small to give even more texture (put the pecans in the blender and they were the same consistency as the breadcrumbs)

This is my go to Salmon recipe. I always look for another recipe to try out for salmon and keep going back to this one. I make this recipe at least once a month! I add a little bit more honey then the recipe suggests though because I'm not a huge mustard fan. But I Love This Recipe!!!

Really really good the first few bites, however, eating more and more of it, it was way too sweet. My family couldn't even finish a whole fillet because of it, but did enjoy it at first. I will definitely make this again, but I will AT LEAST halve the honey.

Good flavors. I agree with the other suggestions about more pecans and less bread crumbs. I used agave nectar instead of honey and I liked the level of sweetness in the dish.

Enjoyable new salmon recipe. We eat lots of salmon and had not tried this until tonight. Glad we did. I used a stone ground mustard and mixed that with a little smart balance and 1 T. honey. I sprinkled a little bread crumbs on top and topped it with coarsely chopped pecans and parsley. I baked it for 10 minutes at 400 and it was perfect. Squeezed a lemon wedge on top with fresh steamed broccoli for a healthy fresh meal. Can't wait to make it again.

Very tasty, and also not a hassle to prepare.  I do agree with other reviewers that the butter/mustard mix could benefit from some refridgeration to help it stick better when it's brushed on, and I would go ahead and add more pecans than called for (including some to the butter/mustard mix), but overall this is a great tasting, easy recipe.

This was a delicious recipe.  I used basa filets and it was so tasty.  The only thing I ommited was the butter in the sauce, just te reduce the calories.  It worked out just fine.  The mustard and honey stuck perfectly to the fish and the bread crumbs and pecans stuck perfectly to the sauce.  Thanks!

This is one of the best salmon recipes I've made. I used 3 tbsp of honey instead of 5 and half a package of crushed saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs. The crackers added a nice crunch along with the pecans and the honey butter combination melded great with the salmon.  One last note, it may be easier to throw the honey, butter, and mustard into a blender instead of mixing it by hand.

AMAZING recipe! Living in the PNW I've eaten a lot of salmon, but none better than this. After cooking for many years, I seldom follow a recipe exactly as written and didn't in this case either. Instead of parsley, I used fresh dill and rather than baking the salmon in the oven (too hot) I soaked a cedar plank in water for 30 minutes and than cooked the fish on the BBQ for about 10 minutes. My family, especially my mom-in-law, couldn't get over how delicious this recipe tastes.

This was great but I would use less bread crumbs. I put pecans in the food processor and pulsed a couple of times making sure I had small pieces and a little large pieces for presentation. I served it with wild grain rice and spinach and berries salad (look this up great recipe also! and i'm not even a fan of spinach)

The idea seemed interedting but in the end it didn't work for me.  I've had crusted Salmon in restaurants before but the effect was much always much lighter and flavourful.  For this recipe I found the overall taste rather flat, uncomplimentry to the Salmon and very heavy in a bad way.  Am thinking it might be cook on chicken though....

This was a very good recipe. May add a little more mustard next time for some extra kick. We are definatly adding this to the monthly menu.

Very quick and easy, however I agree with other reviews that it is a little too sweet and not spicy enough for my taste.  Easy fix - next time I will use hot spicy mustard instead of honey mustard.  Other than that I will make it the exact same way next time.  Also, I used the 2 lb fresh salmon at costco insead of the smaller fillets, cooked for about 15 minutes and it turned out perfecto!

This was delicious.  the texture was perfect.  After reading other reviews I added some wasabi (I was out of horseradish).  Next time I will add a heaping tbls of horseradish because we like a little bite.  This is a keeper.

Fabulous, classy and easy recipe!  Next time I will leave out the butter as there is plenty of fat in the salmon to make up for it - good to reduce calories too.  I halved the recipe and it came out perfect!  Thank you!

I liked this recipe, but some people in my family didn`t like it so much due to honey because it was sweet. I used walnuts instead of pecan.

I loved this recipe.  Surprisingly my husband ate every last bite on his plate.
I made enough sauce/topping for 4 fillets, but just loaded it all onto 2 fillets.

I made this for my roommates and even the ones that are avid fish haters loved it.  I added a maple praline to the top of each fillet to bring all the flavors together.  In the future I think I may used crushed pralines instead of pecans.  To make the pralines us pecans, maple syrup, some honey, and maybe a bit of sugar.  Heat in a small sauce pan until it is just barely bubbling, then spoon small bunches onto wax paper and wait to cool.  The maple flavor helped to mix the sweetness of the pecans and the flavor of the salmon.

Very, very good!  I think I would cut back on the honey a bit next time as I don't like too much sweet with salmon, but this was very easy and delicious.  I used a dijon mustard that had a bit of a kick and it was wonderful!  Served with baby spinach lightly sauteed with garlic and it made a nice light supper.

this was delicious.  I normally don't like salmon.  I soaked the salmon in milk based on a tip on another recipe which took any fishy taste out.  I also used whole grain dried bread crumbs to make it healthier.  I first made the mistake of putting the salmon pieces too close together, and they didn't get cooked in the projected time.  I took them out and put them in a larger pan so they didn't touch each other and they turned out great.  I would definitely make this again.......guess 211 people can't be all wrong!

This was DELICIOUS.  I used packaged dry bread crumbs and was able to throw unchopped parsley, pecan pieces and bread crumbs in my mini-food processor to chop and mix them and it turned out to be way easier than I expected.  The sauce and crust were absolutely delicious!  (and I don't generally even like fish).

This dish was our Christmas dinner last year.  I purchased wild salmon from Sam's club and used the entire salmon from this recipe.  It was out of this world.  I don't think I have had better salmon yet and we eat a lot of salmon!  You have to try this recipe if you like salmon and loads of flavor.  Great recipe!

the coating was too sweet and competed with the natural flavor of the fish. i prefer milder sauces for salmon.

All I have to say is that this recipe is FABULOUS!  Any negative review must have been from some fluke.  Being a good southern boy, I coated the entire filet in the mustard/honey mixture and breaded the entire filet with the pecan and bread crumb mix.  It came out delicious and will be in a heavy rotation in our families meal planning.

"Oh my God, my girlfriend can cook!" was my boyfriend's reaction to this dish. This was my first time making salmon so I was a little skeptical about the results. I had just regular mustard, not dijon, and didn't use any nuts. I followed the rest of the recipe, and in addition, I added half a tsp of crushed ginger and garlic, a sprinkle of chili powder, oregano and about half a tsp of chili sauce. After the fish had been in the oven for 10 minutes, I sprinkled the fish with bread crumbs and crushed red pepper flakes. When finished, it looked really impressive and the flavour was just awesome and spicy, but also a little sweet from the honey! Very moist, but not at all soggy. Would definitely make this again!

This recipe was restaurant quality! I took the advice of a few other reviewers and added a little olive oil on top to moisten the crust. I also used  12-grain bread. It was great. The ingredients in the sauce blended perfectly. I had to stop myself from eating it by the spoonful! Thanks for a delicious recipe. I'll be sharing it with others.

MMMM... the pecans really add so much to this recipe!  My family loves this salmon dinner.  I made it for my extended family for mother's day last year, and it was requested for Christmas Eve dinner, too.  So flavorful, and easy to make.  Make the coating ahead of time, and the honey mixture, too, and prep time before baking will be a breeze.  Even my sister in law, who dislikes fish, loved the salmon!  Great combined with the garlic red potoatoes found on this site.

Excellent recipe.  I've used walnuts instead of pecans with no problem.  I served it with Wasabi Tartar Sauce, from this site, as a dipping sauce on the side.  The sweet of the salmon combined with the hot of the tartar sauce really woke up our mouth.  Guests loved it.

If you're looking for an impressive dish to serve company (or to spoil your family any time), this is it.  You can round the honey and parsley up to the next tablespoon; measurements don't matter too much.  Food processor makes topping prep a snap (but don't process it too long--a few pulses will do).  Serve with an oaky chardonnay or even champagne.  Have made this a few times with other fish; always great.  A must-try and must-add to your recipe box.

AWESOME! That was what both my 4 year old and my husband said when they ate this. I agreed. This dish was perfect. I used almonds instead of pecans. And we loved every bite. Easy to make. Will definately make again and again. New family favorite!

The taste was great.  Next time I'll combine the honey and Dijon, but drizzle the butter on after the crumb mixture. As it was prepared there was a lot of dry,dusty crumbs on top after baking.

My boyfriend and I both loved this recipe.  After reading the reviews, I made a small adjustment to the recipe.  I only used 3 teaspoons of honey, and it turned out perfectly.  Next time, I will use either no bread crumbs or only a few teaspoons rather than the recommended half cup.  They really overpowered the pecans.  I will also be using this coating on chicken breasts in the future.  The suggested cooking time was also spot on.

Perfect recipe! Made it for the whole family and they loved it. 

The only adjustments I would make is cutting the bread/pecan recipe by half ATLEAST. Probably a 1/3 of the amount would be fine. I had lots of leftover mix. Also I used honey mustard instead of dijon mustard because that's what I had on hand.

As for baking, 10 mintures per inch of salmon is a good starter. I baked it for about 15 minutes and it was fine. 

I also made my own sauce to go with the dish that gave the sweet salmon a tinge of sourness. A simple mixture of heavy whipping cream, salt, lemon juice, fresh parsley, and a little bit of butter.

This will definitely be my go to salmon recipe from now on!

So good I will make it again the next time I get some more salmon. Only thing different I did with the recipe was I had no parsley so added just a little Montreal steak seasoning to the bread crust-pecan breading. After applying a coating of the honey mustard and bread crumb mixture, I drizzled it with melted butter and sprinkled more mixture on. Forgot to serve with the lemon wedges but it was great without it.

I made this recipe as directed but I doubled the topping ingredients both dry and wet because we wanted a lot of topping to fish ratio.    I followed the directions and brushed the sauce on the fillets and topped them with the breadcrumbs (I used panko)  and pecan mixture.   When I was finished I dripped the remaining sauce on top of the dry ingredients too.    10 minutes per a inch of thickness was perfect.    My husband and I both absolutely loved this.  None of the ingredients overwhelm or call attention to themselves.   The flavors of the topping and the fish come together in this wonderful cacophony that is indescribably wonderful.   It is was one of those dishes where you go, "This is AMAZING what is in it???"  And then go back to the restaurant and order it over and over trying to figure it out.   I covered my pan in regular foil and then put a piece of non stick foil at the top (which is more expensive) so nothing stuck and there was no clean up either.   This is going to be permanently added to the dinner rotation.

I made this for my boyfriend and I on our first Christmas together in our own place. I don't eat meat other than chicken and fish and wanted to make something elegant and tasty for both of us to eat that wasn't the traditional ham! My man LOVED LOVED this salmon and so did I! It was absolutely perfect. We used honey dijon mustard instead of the honey+dijon mustard and we have absolutely no complaints there. This was all around an amazing dish and so easy to make as well! Definitely will be making it again.

EXCELLENT...This was even better than I had hoped it would be! When I told hubby what we were having for dinner, he was less than thrilled, but after one bite he was hooked (no pun intended, lol)! He said I could make this anytime and he would be happy. I used panko instead of fresh breadcrumbs and dried parsley b/c I had no fresh. So yummy and a recipe that I will be making over and over! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was a nice salmon recipe and everyone enjoyed it. I on the other hand thought it was good but not fantastic. No matter what the recipe is, I am not a big fan of mixing fish with nuts. It still gets 5 stars because my older daughter ate all her salmon (and not a bit of rice), my 3 years old  daughter ate half of her salmon, and all of the adults happily ate their portion.

Thanks for the recipe.  I followed it exactly and I found it super easy to prepare.  Next time I would use less honey - was a little too sweet for my taste but got good reviews overall!

I have not always been the biggest fan of salmon, but my boyfriend loves it.  I used my android app for a fish main course and this was one of the results.  I really loved it and it doesn't take long to prepare at all.  It was tender, flaky and practically melted in my mouth.  I suggest pairing with a Chardonnay or other mildly sweet white.

This recipe just didn't do it for me and my husband. None of the flavors really seemed to meld so I felt like with each bite I was tasting each separate ingredient. I guess my hunt for the perfect salmon recipe continues.

I used this recipe to try to copy a dish at an italian place.  It turned out delicious.  I also made a horseradish cream sauce that I put on the plate and then placed the salmon on top of that.  I topped the salmon with a fresh tomatoe and basil mixture.  Very good.

This recipe had a great flavor made it on 7/30/11. I only had two huge salmon fillets and tried to use all the coating and breading, not a good decision. Will definitely make this again, had lots of taste and was pretty simple.

Excellent salmon meal. We substituted almonds for pecans and smart balance for butter. Served with steamed cauliflower and asparagus. Put the sauce on everything. It was yummy.

This was delicious. I followed one review's suggestion and refrigerated the sauce before applying it to the salmon. I think I left it in there too long as it was thicker than I would have liked. Still the flavor was great. I used a spicy dijon mustard and agave instead of honey.

Chris, I prepare salmon many ways, but this was absolutely the best, the honey helps alot, but you don't really notice it. This made it to my cookbook for keeps. A.G. Seither n519bg@gmail.com

Turned out pretty good, but there's not enough balance between sweet (honey) & tangy (dijon).  Next time, I believe I'll add more dijon - it didn't have enough "bite" for me.  I will also skip the bread crumbs & just use pecans.  Good base recipe to play with.

The topping had little flavor and I added seasoned breadcrumbs.  Maybe toasting the nuts prior to would bring out the nuttiness in the pecans. It needed a little something more.

OMG! YUM!  I marinated it with salt/pepper/minced garlic and the mustard/butter/honey sauce for an hour or so.  Put the bread crumb mixture on both sides right before baking it (make sure to use FRESH bread crumbs NOT dry). 10 min/inch thick is perfect as suggested.  Wow.

Tastes amazing. We used horseradish mustard instead of the dijon. I felt there was too much of the bread crumbs, will use less next time so it's not so powdery.

I followed some of the suggestions in past reviews including marinating the salmon in butter/honey/mustard mixture for one hour and adding more pecans to increase the flavour.  Unfortunately, I found the salmon to be relatively bland.  My husband and I ended up adding some more dijon mustard to the salmon while we ate it to improve the taste.  Maybe it would be better if you marinate it longer.

I pretty much followed the recipe except not everybody wanted Salmon, so I added some Tilapia.  Breaded them according to the direction and literally poured the honey/butter/mustard mixture on the whole thing and baked it.  WOW!!!It was so yummy!! Tilapia and Salmon was fabulous this way.

I think this is the best salmon recipe I have ever tasted.  I used olive oil rather than the butter to make it healthier.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

This recipe was really great! I used a whole fillet of salmon, added soysauce, chilliflakes and limejuice to the mustard and honeyglaze and marinated it for 1 hour as suggested in another review . It turned out lovely - moist and tender! I will definently do this again!

WOW! I did this recipe for 2 but used the exact measurements of the ingredients. The only thing I substituted was Panko bread crumbs instead of fresh. I also lined the pan with foil and did NOT grease it so that when I lifted the fish out of the pan the skin stayed behind. I used 6 oz filets and there was a perfect amount of glaze and bread mixture. I also made it early and kept it in the fridge so when hubby came home dinner was ready in 10 minutes. GREAT for entertaining!

What a delicious recipe!  I would probably decrease the butter, and increase the pecans, for more crunch.  I agree - this is definitely a restaurant-quality recipe.  The ingredients melded beautifully to produce fantastic flavor.  I highly recommend it.

I live in Seattle, so I eat a lot of salmon, and every restaurant in town has at least one salmon recipe on the menu.  I am so picky about my salmon that I won't eat it anywhere outside the pacific coastline where it is fresh and restaurants don't over-cook it (seriously landlocked cities, try taking the fish out a little earlier, it shouldn't be chewy!!!) I wanted to try a new recipe since we have salmon at least once a week, and I am getting bored of the same old recipes.  This one was fantastic! I don't really like mustard, so I cut it back to 2 T, and we didn't have dijon, so I used a spicy sweet mustard instead.  I also took a reviewer's instruction and increased the ratio of pecans to breadcrumbs (changed pecans to 2/3 cup and breadcrumbs to 1/3 cup) otherwise we cooked it exactly as written.  This is definitely going in the regular rotation.  Thanks!

absolutely the best salmon i have ever, EVER had! my mother is a salmon lover and has had all kinds and she said she has never had better. as for my husband, he didn't like.....not because it was gross but because he HATES fresh water fish....especially salmon. i tried to do fish dish he would like but no success. i will just have to make this every time he isn't home or make him something different when i want this. i can't tell you how flavorful and amazing this was. i prepared the sauce before hand so it was nice and thick when i got home and it stuck to the fish great! i accidently left the parsley out though. : (

This is the best salmon recipe on earth, as far as I'm concerned!  I have just a couple of tips:  Tip #1:  Don't brush the fillets.  Put the glaze in a shallow bowl and dip each fillet in it quickly before placing it on your cooking pan. Tip #2:  Use a Silpat (a silicone pad that is made for cooking pans so bottoms of foods don't get overcooked or burnt onto your nice cookware)--the clean up is so much easier. Tip #3:  If you don't have a food processor, the crust might be frustrating to create.

We loved this recipe! It is quick and easy, but it looks like it took hours to make! It is nearly impossible to find pecans here, so I used grated almonds instead, and it worked great. Thanks for a new favourite!

This was tremendously easy, but doesn't fail to impress whomever I am cooking it for. I used a little less honey and used more parsley, but this is a no-fail dish.

The pecan crunch coating was great, the salmon was great, but not together.  I think the coating would have paired well with pork or chicken, but the salmon was an extremely odd flavor combo.  I'll stick to citrus next time.  Thanks for the recipe, though, I'll use the coating.

This is a really good and easy recipe.  This is my first try with salmon, and I'm so pleased with how it turned out.  My 7 year old ate an entire fillet, and my 6 year old and 2 year old ate their share as well.    Thanks so much, now I'm looking forward to trying out some more salmon recipes.

Wow!  I needed a new recipe for salmon and decided to try this one due to the high rating score, and I can honestly say that it deserves the high ranking.  My whole family enjoyed this dish, including my four year old, and it looks beautiful as well.  I served it with roasted green beans, pan rolls, and rice pilaf, and was impressed by how quickly it disappeared.  Salmon isn't usually great the next day, but my husband warmed up some leftovers (in the microwave, I think!) and said that the flavors blended even better on day two.  I know, you'd think it would be gross, huh?  But with such a positive reaction, this will be our new number one salmon recipe!

I followed the recipe as it was presented. It was a big hit. One of my dinner guests, who loves salmon, said, "If you are looking for the perfect salmon recipe-stop looking now. This is it." Another one of my guests wasn't a fan of seafood. She didn't think she liked salmon...until she took the first bite of this dish. She liked it so much she asked for the recipe and took home left overs. 

Thanks for this great recipe! I will be making it again.

My kids really like this recipe--especially the pecan coating. I add a little more garlic and lemon juice with a dusting of butter and bake it for 20-25 minutes per 2 lbs at 375 degrees and it turns out great every time.

Because my family likes the nutty coating, I doubled the pecan/breadcrumb ingredients.  Found that it insulated the salmon fillets so they were exceptionally tender & flaky.

I'd like to say that I joined this website just to be able to rate this recipe. I've tried quite a few recipes on here but none were worth commenting. This one is amazing.  To make sure the crust stuck to the salmon, i brushed with the liquid, then sprinkled crust mixture, then pressed it in, then poured a second coating of liquid and a second coating of crust mixture. And I had no pecans so I used sunflower seeds which were great. I added parmesan but should have added garlic too. This is a great recipe! Even my boyfriend who doesn't like fish enjoyed it.

i had my parents over for dinner yesterday and made this. here are a few little modifications i made. i used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon, about 3 tbls of honey, and i also used panko bread crumbs instead of fresh. i cooked the pecans on the stovetop with a little bit of brown sugar, butter and cinnamon to make up for the smaller amount of honey. i baked the entire fillet (bought at costco) for 20 mins and it was wonderful! not too sweet, but just savory enough because of the mustard. i also marinated it in the mustard topping for about 1 hour before topping it with the breadcrumb mixture. enjoy!

I had 4 frozen salmon fillets and was not quite sure what to do with it until I found this recipe.  I prepared the marinade with a few additions:  added 1/2 tsp minced garlic, 2 tbs mayonaise, and I used honey mustard dressing since I didn't have any dijon on hand.  I covered the fillets in the marinade while they were still frozen and covered the cookie sheet with wax paper and allowed the fillets to thaw and marinate over night.  The next day, I scraped off the marinade and added more honey, mayo, butter and dressing, and also blended in 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs and parsley. This was then used to cover the fillets.  I baked at 400 for 12 mins (based on the rec of 10 min per inch of thickness) and then turned the broiler on high for approx 2 minutes.  The fillets were flakey and juicy and everyone loved it.

I followed this recipe to the letter and I wasn't real thrilled. It took much longer to cook and the "crust" was soggy. However, I put all the leftovers in containers and took it all to work for lunch for my coworkers. We put it on salad and it was good, though the crust was still soggy. I am going to try one more time because of the number of good reviews this got, but I will make a "crumb topping" with the melted butter so it will crisp up.

Great Recipe!!  I made as is and my family and I really enjoyed it.  I did chill the mustard/butter/honey mix for about 15 minutes before spreading on top of salmon fillets.  Worked out Perfectly.  Be careful not to overbake, as the salmon can dry out quickly.

One thing I did differently was use fresh dill instead of parsley and it turned out perfect.  My boyfriend was so impressed when he came home to this this meal.  He said "It was like an expensive restaurant."   I will definitely use this recipe again in the future for friends and family.

Excellent recipe! I let the honey, butter & Dijon rest before brushing it on the salmon. It thickened up and coated the salmon nicely. Then I just pressed the bread crumb mixture into the top of the fillets. I baked for about 20 min. for 6 normal sized fillets. Thanks for a recipe I know I'll make often!

This is a very good salmon recipe.  It was a tad too sweet when I made it the first time, so I used about half the amount of honey called for when I made it subsequently, This turned out to be perfect for my taste .  I also agree with another reviewer that it helps to leave the butter (or I used non-hydrogenated tub margarine) semi-solid. Don't melt it too much, if at all.  It stays on the salmon better and seems to make for a better end product (more moist and the topping sticks better).  I will make again and again.  Thanks!

This was wonderful. We loved the different flavors all combined. My 20 month old scarfed it down before I even sat down at the table and he kept wanting more! My 4 yr old daughter liked it too but my 7 yr old son didn't, only because he doesn't like nuts. This is a keeper recipe!

I've been cooking salmon for years and this is the best recipe I've found!  Magnificent!  Be sure to brush on the sauce very liberally...and next time I might consider doubling the sauce recipe because it made a DELICIOUS salad dressing to go with the fish.

Made this for a birthday earlier this week.  Not a big salmon fan myself but I thought the fish was wonderful and everyone else thought it was a tremendous success.  Would definitely make again despite the two naysayers who felt like the coating/crunch took away from the fish.  Definitely suggest preparing extra sauce (heat first) to drizzle on the crumbs to keep them moist.

This was very good! I still couldn't get my 10-year-old to eat salmon, but I enjoyed it. While the flavor, texture, and presentation were good, I can't give it 5 stars because I almost felt like I was putting too much other 'stuff' on the salmon, thus detracting from its natural goodness. I may make this again, but if I do, I will decrease the bread crumbs and pecans.

Because I couldn't find 'easy' bread crumbs at the store that didn't contain high-fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated fats, I toasted a couple slices of organic "Women's Bread," then threw it in my food processor. It was the perfect addition. I think next time I'll substitute plain yogurt for the butter, too. Then I don't have to worry at all about the healthfulness of this dish. Thanks for the recipe!

with al lthe positive reviews i thought for sure this was a home run.
I think there was too much mustard taste- the pecan topping was decent but all in all the flavors did not go together (especially the parsley). Im sorry but I was not a fan of this

This is indeed a fabulous recipe. My husband says it tastes like from the kitchen of an upscale restaurant. To avoid the toppings being too dry as what the other reviewers said, I drizzled on the honey mustard sauce on the crumbs before baking them. It turned out amazing! It was crunchy and full of flavor! The only change I made was I used hot mustard instead of dijon (the only one I had in the fridge), light margerine for butter and almonds in place of pecans. Terrific!!!

I was disappointed with this recipe.  With the number of responses and a rating of 5 stars, I thought it would be terrific; but it was just ok.  My husband & I love Salmon but this coating wasn't special...just another dijon type.  I've tried others with nut coatings and less ingredients that I was much happier with.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!  I used six frozen Tilapia filets (bought at Sam's Club) instead of Salmon (I don't care for Salmon).  I used dried parsley (which worked out fine but it may be even better if I use fresh parsley next time) and left out the lemon (only because I don't care for lemon on my fish).  I also used the canned dried bread crumbs I had on hand instead of fresh.  Even with all the substitions this turned out absolutely FABULOUS.  My husband and my ten year old daughter (both of whom cringed when I told them we were having fish for dinner) LOVED this and fought over the very last piece.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!  Now I have two great fish recipes in my book.  If you liked this recipe you should try the Firecracker Grilled Alaskan Salmon recipe on this site.

Awesome! I used Smart Balance spread instead of butter and honey mustard instead of dijon. I also didn't measure the ingredients, but otherwise followed the recipe. Everyone loved it, including my 4 yr. old daughter who told us before the meal that she doesn't like fish. It was the first thing she ate and then asked for seconds! Great, easy and special enough for company! Thanks!

I made this recipe New Years day. It was quite good, but I couldn't help thinking I would like to have extra sauce with it. I served it with candied yams, broccoli, wild rice, and rolls. It made a very nice meal. I was also wondering about using a raspberry vinegarette instead of the mustard....hmmmmmm.

This was a very tasty and very easy recipe.  I agree with some of the other reviews...could use a little more flavor.  I think next time I might marinate the salmon first.  Worth trying though!!

This is a perfect recipe for the winter and when you can't go outside & BBQ.  We enjoyed this.  I only used half of the mustard (I'm not a big mustard fan), and used sliced almonds instead of pecans.  It turned out great!

This recipe had such mixed reviews that I almost didn't try it.  I'm glad I did, though...it was great.  I only put half of the bread crumb topping on after reading the other reviews, but this recipe is a keeper.  Even my kids loved it and they didn't like salmon the last time I fixed it.

I tried this recipe last night. The salmon itself was good, but as for the topping, not so. It would  have been a lot better if the pecans were sauted ahead of time with butter and brown sugar, then add the bread crumbs to that mixture.

Very tasty salmon.  The crumbs left in the honey-mustard coating on the pan are good enough to eat with a spoon, which I did.

I think I would cut back on the honey a little bit and increase the ratio of pecans to bread crumbs a little.  I really liked the fresh parsley.  Also, I cooled the melted butter in the fridge a few minutes before mixing with the mustard and honey.

Loved this recipe as did my husband. We had taken a tour of Alaska a few years ago and this is just like the salmon they served in Denali. I would not change a thing.

Have tried this with both salmon and tuna steak.  A+. Very easy for entertaining. I like to serve with a traditional cold coleslaw for contrast or try it with an Asian vinegar base slaw. Served on a bed of jasmine rice along with roasted asparagus. Simply delish combo. Garlic oven  roasted Brussels sprouts would be good too! The last time I used leftover pumpkin spice almonds that I had on hand. Fantastic. Try this one and create your own WOW!!

This recipe is a keeper. My only alterations were some tried herbs instead of parsley and I increased the temperature to 450 when it was almost done to get some crispness on the top. The salmon came out moist without being undercooked. I usually make blackened salmon and was looking for a different flavor.  I wasn't disappointed.

Holy moley!  Alaska Salmon Bake with Pecan Crunch Coating was a success. Even my two anti-seafood family members like it.

"I like the coating. I wonder what it would taste like on chicken," said anonymous

One thumbs up from another anonymous.

I made one mistake an used 5 tablespoons of honey instead of 5 teaspoons, but turned out well anyway.

oh my goodness, this was great! It was easy and fast and I will be making it again. My son and my brother were ready to duel over the last piece!
The only thing I will do differently next time is I will line the pan with foil.  The clean up was rather sticky.

So good! I was looking for a new salmon recipe and tried this because I had all the ingredients - my hubby would eat this every day. Also served it to guests who don't particularly like salmon, and they raved about it. Only change was that I didn't use lemon.

Love this - I kind of cheat, though, and just roll the salmon in honey and pecans and stick it in the oven.

This dish blends the flavors of sweet and crunchy and salty.  If you don't like sweet then use a tangy mustard as recommended by Caroline C.   It is a rich dish and would go well with a simple green vegetable like haricot verts or asparagus.  My husband said it was the best salmon he had ever tasted and he is from Louisiana where food the food is incredible!

I LOVE this recipe.  The second time I made it I used caramelized pecans and decreased the amount of honey by a bit (due to the sweetness from the pecans).  It was absolutely delicious!  Everyone loved it and asked me to make it again!  Gee, I never thought I even liked Dijon mustard!!

This is wonderful.  I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of butter to make it healthier.  I also used Panko bread crumbs so it would be lighter.  I mixed in a little olive oil into the bread crumb mixture to make them stick together a little better.

I used a filet with the skin on and seared the filet, skin side down, in a pan on the stove before I put it in the oven to make the skin crispy, the fish comes off of the skin better when eating it.

Made this the other day, and I loved it. I used Rainbow Trout instead of Salmon, and I didn't have pecans so I used chopped walnuts, and it was delicious.  I found the crumbly topping a little dry, so I drizzled leftover sauce on top as well.  Turned out delicious, I can't wait to make it again.

I suppose more sauce and seasoning would've been better.  But even with adequate amounts of those, I don't think this would be a five star recipe for us.

I love this recipe.  Here are the changes I make just so it's easier for me:

~Dried parsley instead of fresh
~Panko breadcrumbs (I like the good crunch)
~Walnuts instead of pecans (it's what we have in the house. I think any nut would be good)

We make this about once a week.  Love it.

This has become my signature dish. It was the first thing I made for  my in-laws and they were so impressed they had me make it again for a big family dinner to show off my cooking skills. Everyone compliments it and asks for the recipe. If you want to cut down the fat, you can make the mustard mix without butter and it still tastes great. And sometimes I substitute walnuts for pecans. Enjoy!

I was really disappointed with this recipe. The pecan topping with the bread crumbs did nothing for the dish. Salt and pepper, bake, toast pecans in butter over low heat and pour over cooked fish and eat.  That would have been much better. Never falling for a honey mustard fish dish again.

Solid pecan crusted salmon recipe. I ended up with excess crust though. Would do 3/4 of what's prescribed next time. Also, would perfer a higher pecan to bread ratio. Maybe 2:1 instead of 1:1. Had excess honey mustard as well. Probably half would be sufficient. Served this with steamed broccoli and homemade sweet potato fries. Went well together.

This was really tasty. I followed the instructions as is but added a little more honey. I baked it for 10 mins but noticed it was still pretty dry on top. So I made another small batch of the sauce, drizzled it on and cooked it 5 more mins. Came out perfect. Will definitely make this again.

I made this for my sister and brother-in-law and we each thought this was fantastic!  I used fresh Chilean Salmon and followed the recipe as written.  The flavors and crunchiness of the pecans worked together perfectly.

Delish! I did use sweet hot mustard, and I think that made a difference. Also, the timing was off, my fillets were only 1 inch thick but took 20 min to cook. I love the pecan crunch!

This recipe is amazing! I used old– fashioned mustard and it came out perfectly. This is my new favorite recipe.

I made this exactly as written, using gluten free breadcrumbs.  Delicious!  Cooking it as directed gave us a moist, perfectly done salmon filet.  Will definitely make this again.

I think four stars is a bit generous, but we can't give half-stars, so there you go. I used panko instead of regular bread crumbs and while it was edible, it just wasn't especially yummy.

Doubled this recipe, using fresh Alaskan salmon, for my mom's 78th birthday dinner. It was a hit with both the adults and my teenagers! I did increase the pecans to 1 cup, but will increase further next time to 1.5 cups pecans, 1/4 c. breadcrumbs, for even crunchier and more flavorful coating. This will be my regular baked salmon recipe.

This is a keeper for us! I made as posted, except I let the fish marinate in the honey butter for about an hour, and used Panko instead of bread crumbs. Delicious! Don't be shy with the sauce and the topping, the more the better!!

There are no words to describe how amazing this dish is!!!  It is absolutely perfect, and so easy to make.  I accompany it with a creamy dill sauce which just adds a nice touch, but the recipe is great without it.  I made it for company one night, and they raved for weeks about it!  It is an impressive dish!  Thanks for sharing!

Made this last night. Next time I will cut the honey by 1/2. The butter/honey/mustard mix is good, but comes out too sweet and overpowers the Dijon flavoring. Cut the honey in 1/2 for sure. I let the salmon marinate for 20-30 minutes, and also had to bake it at 400 for close to 25 minutes versus the author's  "10 minutes per inch". That simply would have not been cooked thoroughly enough. Also, I used walnuts instead of pecans, and Japanese Panko breadcrumbs - got a great result. I will definitely be making this again, using less honey and baking for 20+ minutes. Served this with sauteed zucchini, red pepper & green pepper (in olive oil, garlic, balsamic and red wine vinegar).

One of my favorite recipes. I love to make this when I have company because it looks nice but requires very little effort.

This is also a great recipe for people who do not like salmon but want to eat salmon. I do not like salmon, but I love this recipe. I also made it for a friend who is not a salmon fan and he also loved it. 

I usually leave out the bread crumbs to make it healthier and have even on one occassion left out the butter. I don't think omitting these ingredients negatively impacts this dish. I also usually add extra honey and less mustard.

I made this for Christmas dinner, it was a hit! Even guests who say they don't normally like salmon loved it. VERY easy and extremely tasty!   I did find that I had to cook mine longer than the time recommended, and even finished it off with a little broiling to brown the top.... but other than that ... perfect!

Best baked salmon recipe!  I'll be honest, I didn't exactly measure the ingredients, I mixed to taste.  The key ingredient seems to be the chopped pecans.  Wife wants me to make this every week now.  Kids even devoured it, no leftovers here.  A wonderful treat when you cannot get your fish out to the grill!

I had something similar to this in New Orleans restaurant, (Olde Nawlins Cookery) and it was absolutely incredible!!!!!  I recommend to Caroline C. that she try a remoulade sauce instead of dijon.  It may be just the flavor she is looking for, slightly sweet, with a nice bite behind it.

This was by far the Best salmon recipe we have ever tasted.  We had a piece of wild sockeye salmon that was 1 1/3 pounds.  I cut it into 5 servings and brushed a thick coating of the sauce on top, I then pressed a thick layer of the topping into the sauce and baked for about 13 minutes.  My family loved it and decided that we will have our fish this way twice a month, forever ; )  I served it with fresh steamed broccoli, couscous and a small green salad.  Our dinner for 5 cost a mere $17.00 but looked and tasted like a $30 to $45 each, meal in an upscale place.

This was excellent!  I did it on the BBQ on a stoneware bar pan, on indirect heat. Fantastic, lots of raves from my dinner guests.  I did it again at the cottage, on the BBQ, but my boyfriend picked up trout by mistake, plus the BBQ was pretty old, but still did it on the stoneware, on a low heat,  and that too was excellent.  Only change I made was I used breadcrumbs from multigrain bread (as that was all I had), I will stick to that change.

A little less honey and it would be perfect. Very good, though, and the honey mustard kept for a while so we used it on a couple other things.

Another winning recipe!  I've prepared this recipe as is and it is delicious!  I've varied the ingredients based on what I had on hand -- honey mustard instead of dijon, almonds instead of pecans -- and still turned out delicious.  I've even used a maple agave syrup blend instead of honey and same result--delicious!

This is a wonderful recipe that I make for company.  To make the coating crunchier, I omit the bread crumbs and just use the chopped pecans (walnuts work too) and parsley.  Ten minutes in the oven wan't long enough the first time I made this. Even though the salmon filllets were not more than an inch thick, they were very large.  Make sure to test the thickest part with a fork before serving.  I serve this with asparagus and whole grain & wild rice.

Been using a very similar recipe in my restaurant for the past year now and wont be changing anytime soon.  We mix the nuts and crumbs with the butter .. helps keep them on the salmon in the convection oven.  Customers love it.

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST - (my husband loves that he doesn't have to grill) - I have made this twice and as others noted - decreased the bread crumbs and pumped up the pecans.  The cook time IS right on.  Next time, I may saute the pecan mixture w/butter in a pan and slather it on.  Liked the idea of refrigerating the honey/mustard part to keep it thicker when brushing salmon.  ENJOY this one's a keeper for sure!!

Wow, this is restaurant quality!  I, too, used a store bought honey mustard and mixed that with the melted butter.  I didn't have any bread crumbs so I just sprinkled the salmon with salt & pepper and then a little dried italian spice mix which contained parsley. Then I sprinkled on the ground pecans and baked for 11 minutes.  At the end of baking I turned on the broiler and let the pecans toast a little more, just about 2 or 3 minutes before removing from the oven.  Watch carefully, though.  This was so yummy even without the bread crumbs, which saved a few calories, too!

Made this last night and thought it was SO delicious. The sweet flavors of the honey mixed with the tangy mustard and nutty pecans. I am not even a big fan of honey or dijon, but the flavors mixed were amazing. My boyfriend isn't a big fish fan, but he ate his up quickly and admitted it was really good. The only change I (accidently) made was that I let the salmon soak in the honey/butter/mustard mixture for about 20 minutes, sort of like a marinade. I don't think it made much difference, but it may have infused more sweetness into the salmon.

We really enjoyed this dish, the pecans gave it a very nice crunch.  Good flavor but I think I will marinade the fish in the sauce for an hour before cooking as others have suggested to get more flavor.  It was very easy and quick to make, just the type of recipe that I like!  Initially I thought that it was too much topping but after baking, we ended up scraping the topping that drifted off the salmon during baking.  Yummy dish!

WOW!  Best salmon I've ever had!  Chill sauce to thicken, it will stay on salmon much better.  I added 1/2 tsp curry to sauce..thick topping of pecans does the trick.  Can't wait to make again for company, it's a keeper!

This did not go over too well with the family. They all complained it was too sweet. It came off very rich. I would suggest maybe 3 teaspoons honey. The only thing I changed was to use butter in the bread crumbs, because they were left-over and previously made up that way.

Very Good, but a little too sweet as the recipe is written.  I have made this twice and I like it better with about 2 T less honey.  Also,  I didn't have pecans so I used almonds instead and it was delicious.  I also omitted the butter and used whole wheat bread crumbs.  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

I have never made salmon before, so I was a little leary about the cook time and the flavours agreeing, but this was a perfect recipe! I folllowed it exactly. I made it for my boyfriend's birthday with the onion rice pilaf recipe on this site and he couldn't have been happier!

I made this exactly as shown, and it was quite delicious and very quick to make. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because I think it's maybe a tad too much bread crumbs. But that's just my opinion. I'll definitely be making this one again!

This was good.  Baking times are spot on.  I used panko instead of bread crumbs but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The salmon was spectacular but it was good.  Served with steamed brocolli and cauliflower with a spinach salad.  Dinner was complete in about 35 minutes (from mixing ingredients to pulling food out of the oven and clean up).  Excellent for easy clean up and healthy, quick dinner option.  I will leave butter out of honey mustard next time - salmon is so oily on it's own there is no need to add fat/calories.

Very sweet; needed the lemon to cut some of the honey taste.  Baked 15 minutes, brushed off excess breadcrumbs, and baked 2 more minutes... perfection.  Next time I'd cut down on the honey and increase the mustard.  My teenager, who likes seafood, liked the topping but didn't like it with the salmon.  My husband gulped down 3 pieces.

This may be the best salmon dish I've had.  The crunchy coating is a wonderful offset for the flaky mild salmon.  Not being a huge mustard fan, I used honey dijon mustard along with the extra honey called for in the recipe.  It worked well.

Nice dish but don't go too heavy on with the bread crumb mix.  I think lighter is better since it allows for the flavor of the glaze to come through better.

I made this for myself for Christmas.  Best Christmas dinner ever!!  I only made minor changes.  I had an entire filet (28 oz) so I cut it in half and only used half the ingredients.  I used French's Honey Dijon instead of regular dijon and honey, since I already had it.  Like other reviewers, I increased the pecans and decreased the breadcrumbs (2/3 and 1/3), but I didn't actually use breadcrumbs.  I used Ritz crackers.  (Saw it in another review.)  I don't have a brush, so I slathered the mustard mixture on with my hands (fun, but messy!) then pressed the crumb mixture onto it.  I also drizzled melted butter on top before baking.  It was FABULOUS!  I can't wait to make the other half!

We live in Alaska - so we eat a LOT of salmon. We usually have several hundred pounds of filets in the freezer by the end of every summer... So for my husband to say this is his favorite salmon recipe yet means a lot. We both loved the crunchy sweet topping. Some of the mustard-honey-butter sauce slid off the salmon as it was baking, but I just took it out of the oven, scooped it off the sheet, and drizzled it over the top. Made it even better!

Excellent, easy to prepare with ingredients I had on hand! The honey-dijon combination with pecans was great. I used Italian bread crumbs which I would do again. Cook time would have been right if I factored it up for fillets that were about 1-1/4" thick. We fish salmon in the summer and are always looking for new ways. This one will be remembered and tried again and again.

I started this recipe just as written.  However, as I continued on, I decided to add a little parmesan to the bread crumb/pecan mixture and it added just the right amount of saltiness.  I also added a little white wine in the bottom of the pan and it came out wonderful.  As many of the other reviewers stated, the cooking time was absolutely spot on.  I served it with a pine nut/garlic couscous and some grilled asparagus.  It was a fantastic, healthy meal!

Absolutely excellent with Arctic Char. No need to remove the skin, just place skin-down in baking dish. When done, the fillets lift easily off the skin. For a more Northern dish, use day-old bannock for the crumbs.

I have made this recipe several times as stated. We really enjoy it. The other night I pulled out the salmon to defrost. To my surprise; no dijon or breadcrumbs. No problem, I subbed ranch dressing and ritz crackers. Cooked for 8 minutes as they were thinner fillets and what a delicious twist to this already great salmon dish. My BF and I like variety and that opps turned out perfect. It may always look like the same dish but a nice surprise when you take a bite. This is my fav way to do salmon. Next I will try the same prep for chicken.

I have made this several times for my family and my husband, who doesn't even like nuts, loved it.  What's really nice about this is that it's perfect the way it is...but you CAN make changes in the type of nuts (walnuts instead of pecans) and different types of mustard.  This is a dish I use often for company.  Thanks Christine.

I thought this salmon topping was delicious. I will use a better cut of salmon next time. I was only cooking for 2 so I halved the recipe. Next time I will try and coat both sides of the fish and see how it turns out on a grill.

Wow. Wow. Wow. I don't know how or where you got this recipe but wow. SO GOOD. This is THE BEST salmon I have ever had in my life. I made this for the first time serving it to dinner guests and it came out so good! Didn't have pecans so I use slivered almonds instead (super crunchy!), and I used half the amount of bread crumbs and doubles the nuts. Also drizzled a little melted butter on top so make the breadcrumbs crispy! I will DEFINITELY make this many many many more times. Thank you!

This recipe works well when you have little time to get dinner together. Next time I'll cut the breadcrumbs down by at least half. It was just way too much. The flavour combination is a bit odd, but it works. I keep this recipe around for those last minute dinners, but it's definately not gourmet food...

Family enjoyed it, even the kids.  I didn't read far enough in the directions (interpret as distracted by children) & combined all the ingredients together vs brushing w/ liquid then covering w/the crumb topping.  It still tasted delicious, made sort f a crust on top.  I didn't have fresh parsley so omitted that.  I'll make this again.

This is the best salmon recipe ever.  I used sliced almonds instead of pecan, and it was to die for.  My small children LOVED it, too.  Super easy and quick to make. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!!

This was very good! The topping was crunchy, and helped keep the salmon moist. My personal preference would have been to have more Dijon flavor, but that is easily adjusted. Overall, a very tasty and easy way to prepare salmon.

A very nice change of flavor for salmon! The crunch of the pecan lends an almost meat-like heartiness. I used honey mustard (for lack of dijon), cut down to 2 tsp of honey and 1 Tbsp butter, cut breadcrumbs to 1/3 cup and increased pecans to 2/3 cup. I also covered the salmon in the mustard sauce and then dredged it in the pecan/breadcrumb mixture and baked in foil packets. A quick, delicious dinner! ~UPDATE~ I am giving this a fifth star... I used dijon this time and let the mustard mixture sit in the fridge a bit before spreading it on the fish; the fish then marinated in the fridge for a while before I sprinkled on the pecan mixture. Baked on a sprayed cookie sheet... my family devoured this.

Excellent, but I didn't have pecans so I used parmasan cheese instead.  I was sucking the leftover sauce off the pan when I was done because the salmon was all gone and I wanted a little bit more.

Awesome!  My new favorite!  The salmon was not fishy at all and the flavor was delicious!  The only problem I had is that the fish did not cook as quickly as the recipe said.  But that's probably because the skin was still on it?

Wow, this was great.  I used walnuts the first time because that was all  I had and it was amazing.  Made it again using pecans and it was great too, but I have to say I prefer walnuts.  Used fresh Copper River salmon which is one of the best flavored in my opinion, but this would work well with any salmon or fish.

My neighbor brought me a piece of ahi that needed to be cooked today.  Since I was unable to go to the store I had to use what I had in the house.  I adapted this recipe and it came out beautifully.  I left out the butter to reduce the fat and calories, but you couldn't tell.  I also coated all sides of the fish.  It was delicious!  Since I was only working with a small piece of fish I didn't even measure anything, but since I coated instead of crusting just the top, it didn't really matter.  I would definitely recommend this one!

We eat salmon frequently so I like to try new recipes.  We thought this was excellent!  Since the kids were non-stop yapping I accidentally added 3 TBS honey rather than what the recipe specified but it turned out absolutely fine.  I didn't fully melt the butter so when I mixed the mustard and honey in, the mixture wasn't too runny upon spreading and I was able to pat the crumb mixture on without having anything run off the fish.  This joins my collection of other great salmon recipes!

Very very good!  I used a whole plank of salmon and omitted the butter but no other changes.  It was gobbled up fast here!

This was very good! It did take a heck of a lot longer to bake than I thought it would, however.

This is a fabulous way to prepare Salmon.  I was lucky enough to cook a piece of fish caught just yesterday!  I didn't make any real changes.  I served this with the Caribbean Sweet Potato Salad and they paired very nicely.

I randomly bought salmon on day at the grocery store, which is odd because I don't actually like salmon (except in salmon ceasar salads). This recipe was a cinch and my boyfriend devoured it but I just don't like salmon.

This turned out great. Used cilantro in lieu of parsley because that was what I had. Added a little garlic to the honey mustard mix because I love garlic. I also used a little olive oil instead of more butter since I made a 3lb fillet. My sister in law even took the recipe home with her.

I did not get to this recipe as soon as I had hoped and my salmon smelled a little suspicious so I put the stuff I had prepared in the fridge and used it tonight on chicken!  I coated both sides of chicken with honey/mustard and dredged in crumb mixture, cooked it for 15 minutes a side and did not use lemon, of course.  It was really yummy.  3 out of four kids gave it a thumbs up! Next time will serve it with a rice side dish.

I was very lucky to have freshly caught spring chinook salmon, to make this recipe with. It was awsome. I served it over basmati rice with summer squash and red bell pepper. We had a nice green salad on the side. Don't forget to serve a special dry white wine. It is to die for.

I found this recipe to just be meh. The recipe made too much glaze, and the extra on the sides burned quickly because of the honey. Also, the topping wasn't crunchy. The flavor is good, but I'd rather make a dipping sauce or something.

We live in Alaska and have a freezer full of salmon, but haven't found many recipes that our family of 8 enjoys.  This is the first recipe that we all really like.  Everyone goes back for seconds when I fix this.  Thanks!

I made this recipe as written, it was very good.  I will do less breadcrumbs and more pecans next time and I did marinate for an hour or so.  I think the honey & mustard were a perfect combo with the right amount of each.

Very flavorful. The Dijon was a great taste with the honey.  Make extra sauce if you like to get that extra drizzle:)

Delicious salmon recipe. My 2 year old even ate it. I used a 3lb fillet(from Cosco) and it was all gone. I did add a sprinkle of Parm and broiled.

Everyone enjoyed it!  I especially liked the nuts on the top - they added a sweetness to the topping.  Don't use too many breadcrumbs though ~ it will increase the cooking time, like I found out.  I will definitely make this again!

I had this dish in a restaurant before and it was really good, so when I saw this recipe I decided to make it myself. I added only 1/4 cup of bread crumbs and extra pecans. I bought pecan chips and put in the food processor only for a little bit, so I had some pieces very fine and some bigger pieces. It turned out very good, next time I will add even less bread crumbs.

Skipped salt, pepper and lemon wedges... otherwise prepared exactly as directions stated... YUM!  I usually try to keep food simple, but this recipe was super-easy to prepare and was simply delicious.  My husband and I both loved it.

We loved it! Made 6 servings of sauce and toppings accidentally, so we piled on the breadcrumb mixture. Was great, very juicy. I really liked the mustard flavor, and the slightly sweet taste went great with the salmon flavor. Substituted cilantro for parsley.

Did not change a thing and it was simple and delicious.  I will make again and follow some of the reviewers suggestions to marinate in the honey dijon mix for an hour.  But as is this recipe is a winner!!

Made this for a small dinner party and everyone enjoyed it. I followed the recipe as written except inadvertently used brown mustard instead of dijon. I am sure the dijon would have enhanced the flavor considerably. Will make again soon.

This is a quick and delicious way to make salmon. It would probably work with chicken as well. Definitely be sure to layer things on the salmon with the honey mustard mixture and then the pecan mixture on top. I noticed a few people say that they mixed theirs and though I haven't tried it that way, I doubt it would hit the palate the way the recipe intends if it is mixed.

Awesome! SO SO EASY AND SO QUICK! My family loved it, even my daughter that doesn't like fish!  I'm acctually going to try this on Red Snapper when it I get a chance.  All the flavors are just amazing.  I might just cut back a litte on the honey and I used Emeril's Horseradish Mustard, love the litte skick that the horseradish gives.  Just great stuff.

Ok so this is really good, and surprizingly filling.  I recommend cutting back on the crunchy topping.  The salmon gets lost under it if you put too much of it on.  Very good though.

This was quick, easy and delicious.  Just made filets for the two of us.
I added a bigt of the liquid to the dry ingredientgs and formed a paste so it stayed on top of the salmon better.
Wonderful receipe.

Very good overall. I think I made the topping too thick on top of the fish, so when I checked for doneness underneath the topping, it kept looking underdone when the rest of the fish was done. Next time I will bake it for a few minutes and then add the topping. Thanks for the recipe!

YUMMY!  I used some of the reviews and used 2 T. butter, 2 T. mustard (spicy brown), and the 5 t. honey.  I didn't measure the crumbs but used 2 slices of bread and a couple small handfuls of pecans.  I didn't have fresh parsley so used dried.  I also refrigerated the mustard mix first so it was thick.  Very yummy--will be a staple of my salmon repertoire.

This was good.  I used a whole salmon and it took 20 minutes to cook. The kids didn't care for the pecans but they said it was good.  My husband and I liked it but the asian salmon from Lynseey is much better and the kids eat it all up.  We make the asian salmon all the time.

This is one of my husband's fave salmon recipes. He just loves the crunch of the pecans with the flakiness of the salmon. I'm not a big pecan person so I just omit them when preparing my fillet. Very tasty.

I have been searching for a quick and easy recipe that tastes gourmet and will impress anyone and this is definitely it!!  I made this for my husband and his best friend and none of us could believe how great it turned out! I left out the lemon wedges and also obmitted the parsley as I only had 4C seasoned bread crumbs on hand and it has herbs in it already, but the combination of all these flavors worked wonderfully!

This recipe was great and had a really light, sweet flavor. I used regular mustard because I was out of Dijon and added more honey. I also put more of the mustard/honey/butter mixture on top of the dry mixture. It was perfect! Cook time is spot on as well. Served wtih a salad and basmati rice. MmmMmm

A great recipe! Instead of the bread crumbs, I used Crakers; they matched perfectly with the sweet flavor of honey. I recommend fetuccini Alfredo as a side dish. Enjoy!

I would give this recipe more stars if I could.  There is no need to make any changes.  It is great the way it is.  I will try this with other fish also like some walleye.  It's so easy to make and is so DELICIOUS!

I used almonds instead of pecans and olive oil instead of butter.  I didn't have bread crumb so I crushed some crackers and it did the trick.  Delicious!

I had just purchased fresh salmon and decided to try this.  Excellent recipe!  I did make a few changes, I used room temperature butter which made the honey-mustard mixture thicker and it adhered better to the salmon.  Also I used Panko bread crumbs which gave the topping some crunch and I substituted the parsley with dill.  I will try this with chicken and use tarragon in place of dill.  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't usually like to clutter fish dishes with too much "stuff" but I really like this one - it allows you to merely add an extra layer without disguising the salmon.  And it looks good, too!

Excellent! Both my husband & I loved this recipe; I will definitely make it again.
I didn't have dijon mustard on hand, but I used (Mrs McGarrigle's) Canadian Maple coarse mustard and it was fantastic.
Thanks.

I go back to this recipe every time I need to make something easy and for company!  It is such a great easy beautiful dish.  Thank you so much!  My only advice after making it many times is that I omit the breadcrumbs and butter altogether.  Either way Thank-you so much!!

This was very good.  As my husband says "It's a do over".  I didn't have dijon mustard so I substituted with honey mustard, added to the sweetness a little, but still gave it some zing.  I will need to get some dijon and try again.  Thank you for sharing.

This was very good.  It isn't quite THE recipe to make me toss all others, but it is very much a repeater.  I'd suggest either making sure you're using pre-flavored breadcrumbs or that you get more liberal with your seasonings in the dry mix because it was just a tad bland even after using spicy mustard.  **edit** I originally reviewed this in March of 2008 and only gave it 4 stars. I've changed my mind entirely. This is delicious and has become a staple at out house.  Just don't forget to s&p the fillet before topping. I get a bit more liberal with the spices and we throw these on the grill in tinfoil trays. EVERYTHING tastes better off the grill!  Just triple layer some foil, triple fold the edges and pull them up to make sides.  You can just toss it when you're done...

What an easy and delicious recipe!  I used panko instead of traditional breadcrumbs and I added a few red pepper flakes to spice it up a little.  It was a HUGE crowd pleaser and I will definitely make it again.

Wow!  This recipe was delicious.  I can't say enough good things about it.  I made salmon three ways for my dad when he was visiting and this was my favorite.  His favorite was the maple salmon from this site.  Thanks for the recipe!

I cook Salmon a couple times per week and for some reason this did not impress me. It has so much potential, but was too sweet for me and those I served it to.

This was very good and I just keep making it Holiday after Holiday.  My grandfather truly hates salmon but has requested I make this dish for the last several holiday's not to mention other friends and family members loving it ... I added glazed pecans rather than the plain and purchased the large piece of salmon at Costco/Sam's It’s seriously a great flavor for the salmon ... Thanks a bunch, I'm a hit with this one! I just want to add ...if you end up with a bad piece of salmon it could kill your whole recipe ... be sure to get a nice piece of salmon and you won't be disappointed!

An incredible recipe. The honey-dijon goes great with the salmon. I would suggest either toasting or adding a little more of the pecans as the flavor gets lost in everything else going on with this one

This is one of my top 5 salmon recipes.  We have salmon quite often due to living in the Pacific NW.  I did change the recipe a little buy using half the butter in the spread and drizzling the rest on the top of the salmon.  This gave it more of a crunch.  It was hard not to just eat the topping!!

We have salmon a couple of times a week.  This is a very easy and good recipe.  I didn't measure exact, but followed the recipe fairly close...though I did forget the parsley.  It was still excellent, but I will use it next time.  When I put the mixture on the salmon it ended up mixing a bit to make more of a paste.  I think this made a better crust.

This recipe does not need improving, but for a change of flavor I substitue mango chutney for the honey.   Gives it an intriguing flavor.   Try it - you might be surprised.

This salmon wasn't quite as good as I had hoped based on the ratings it has received. I love the flavor of salmon, and thought all the added flavors of honey, mustard and toasted pecans was really a little bit too much for the fish. I would try this again without the honey or with another type of fish.

Delish!  I opted to make this recipe without the honey and it still turned out perfectly!  I've never tasted better salmon anywhere, including restaurants.  My husband asks for this all the time, and he's a very picky eater.  Definitely a keeper!

If I could give this 6 stars I would.  It is wonderful.  I make this at least once a month.  I follow the recipe exactly except I usually make it with tilapia instead of salmon.  I like the more subtle fish flavor with this a little better than the stronger salmon.  It is quite good with salmon as well but I just prefer the tilapia.

I skipped parsely (who could use up the whole bunch anyway?) and I used the butter substitute. Put some garlic powder, sprinkled a bit more of salt and black pepper.  I just don't think it's that 'restaurant quality', though. It was pretty good, but some people are either exaggerating or have never been to a real good seafood restaurant.. sorry!

I served this for our Christmas dinner last night.  This was amazing!  I don't cook fish often, and was a bit nervous as to how it would turn out.  I received rave reviews and my husband said that this was one of the best meals he has ever had.

I cooked this for my parents and they LOVED it! I didn't have any dijon mustard so i just used regular old yellow mustard. And, i reduced butter by half and added a little mayo instead. I accidentally put less honey than supposed to, but the stil fish came out really nice and creamy. I also used store bought italian bread crumbs along with pecans and almonds. The nuts became sweet and carmelized  and were awesome! My mom also insisted i add some onions on the side of the baking dish because she likes veggies. The onions also carmelized with the sauce and came out wonderful. Served with brown rice, with carmelized onions, salmon with pecan/almond on top. It was a wonderful meal and my parents were Very impressed. next time ill make a little more sauce to put on the side for veggies. Oh, and im a college student (not an experienced cook) and this recipe was super easy and fast!

This was very good, everyone thought I was a natural gourmet. I used Grey Poupon (my boyfriend went shopping as I would have bought something cheaper) and cut down to 2.5 TBS but I think the whole 3 would have been fine.  When I first mixed it, I thought the mustard was, too, much and my boyfriend would not like it but it was excellent when it was done. I even used the extra sauce as dip.  My salmon was about 1 and a half inch at its thickest point so I baked for 20 minutes and the topping and sides were done but the middle was not hot all the way through so I covered with foil to not over brown the topping and cooked another 6-8 minutes more.  It was great. I used one and a half slices of Stroehmann King Bread and put it in the food processor.  I will definitely make this again. My boyfriend loves salmon and eats at a number of restaurants and thought this was great.  I served with some wilted spinach and white rice.

Very simple to make indeed and quite delicious!  We used the leftover glaze as a sauce to drizzle on top (heated it on the stove until boiling first).  We also baked the fish on broiler pan so that the skin would crisp up as well.  Definite keeper!

This salmon was very good.  I used wheat bread for the breadcrumbs and almonds instead of pecans.  Added some dill and garlic powder, but really couldn't taste those additions.  I wish I would have slathered on more of the honey mustard sauce, but since I'm not a huge mustard fan I didn't.  You definitely need to slather it on!  Very good.  Husband loved it.  We will be making this again.

This recipe is now a family favourite! After reading other reviews, I too put a layer of sauce, bread crumbs and then sauce again (to keep the bread crumbs moist)

Fish was moist, if nuts are salted-don't add any more salt.  Not a fan of honey on fish-just didn't seem to go together.

This is definitely a keeper. We used all of the honey mixture and put it on both sides of the fish (we used a butter substitute).  We used a brown horseradish mustard instead of a dijon.  We put the breading on both sides of the fish and cooked it for 18 minutes. Wonderful taste.  Will make this often.

I really liked this!!!  I used panko bread crumbs and it tasted great with them.  The only thing I would do next time is marinade it in the wet mixture for a little while to really get all the flavor into the salmon.

Very nice recipe!  Makes a nice presentation for company.  I only had 3 pieces of salmon so I used the remaining topping and sauce on talipia and baked it in a separate pan.  I think I liked the talipia better than the salmon but both were very good.

This was the best salmon I've ever had and I made it myself. Even my 7 year old son loved it! I made the bread crumbs from some whole grain bread I bought from the bakery it wasn't quite breadcrumb consistency so I tore the bread into small pieces and baked them for a bit till they were more crumbly. I think the whole grain bread crumbs paired quite nicely with the pecans.

Wow!!!  We were really impressed with this recipe.  I had to substitute almonds and dry bread crumbs, but it was still fantastic!  Use up all of the dry mixture... it gets crunchy and yummy while cooking.  The flavor was just great... a new favorite for us.

This was good and I will probably make it again.  The fish taste was covered up.  The bread crumb & pecan mixture was way more than enough.  Next time I will reduce it by half.

I'm sorry but contrary to all the great reviews, I was very disappointed.  First of all, there is way too much mustard - it overpowers the sweetness of the honey.  Secondly, salmon is such an oily fish it really doesn't need so much butter.  I really would have liked to taste the honey and should have followed my instincts in reducing the amount of mustard to a teaspoon or so.  I also had the idea of doing a fresh ginger honey glaze to brighten up the flavors.  Overall, this recipe was nothing special.  I probably won't make it again without altering it so much that it becomes another recipe entirely.

Sorry!!

Chris,

Your recipe rates a 10.  My family loves fish, so I have it often.  I have made Salmon, many ways and your recipe has just pushed our favorate into second place.  Please be assured that I will make it often.  I hope you have other fish recipes posted on All Recipes, like fresh Tuna, Sword Fish, etc.  

Sincely,

Iret

This will become a family favorite...restaurant quality recipe!  I had to leave out the dijon mustard as my husband has an aversion to all condiments.  I also added a little olive oil to the butter for extra flavor.

The coating was superb - make sure its well ground up.  Another reviewer was right; it does cover up the taste of salmon.  But I'm not that passionate about the taste of salmon - so I loved it.  It is a grand way to serve fish.  If you make extra topping, save the rest in the freezer!

This is great if you do not like to the taste of fish.  My husband and I love salmon, but we could not taste it at all through the coating.  We found it very disappointing.

Loved this, it was a different way to have salmon.  Next time I will leave out the honey to save calories and because i didn't need the sweet.

The nuts added a unique flavor.  It tasted light and gourmet.  Took a while to make.

We are on low-sodium diets so I did not season the salmon with salt and used unsalted margarine. Had to bake longer than expected. Delicious!

I live in a landlocked Mid-Western state where beef is king.  I admit that this recipe was my first attempt of preparing fresh fish at home.  This is one area of cooking where I am a true novice, but this recipe turned out fabulous!  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately, my 6 & 10 year olds refused to allow any to pass their lips.  (Their loss!)  The basting sauce was so tasty that I didn't want any to go to waste so after brushing it onto the salmon fillets, I then poured the remainder over the top.  I also crushed the pecans very fine (approximately the same texture as the bread crumbs) because my husband is not a big fan of nuts.  Guess what, he didn't even realize this had nuts in it!  Thank you Chris for making my first attempt at preparing salmon a success.

I used a combination of fresh toasted bread crumbs and Wheat Thins instead of all bread crumbs (mostly Wheat Thins).  This was able to give the recipe both the extra flavor and the proper texture other reviewers felt it lacked.  I went easy on the Dijon mustard, but was asked later by my fiance to add more next time.  It was simply delicious (I don't even like salmon).  This one is a keeper!

Easy to make with common ingredients, yet the taste is most unusual!
I made it to prove to my family that salmon does not have to be greasy or
prepared in the typical way and this dish achieved more than just that. :)

Super easy and super yummy.  You can vary the crumb topping if you don't have the exact ingredients listed on hand.  I rarely eat fish and hardly ever cook it myself (always seem to mess it up when I do!) but this recipe is as easy as it is tasty!

I thought that this was awful!  I made it for my in-laws anniversary dinner and I couldn't even eat it!  My guests were polite enough not to say anything but no one complimented me on the meal so I assume they did not enjoy it either.  It was much too sweet for my liking and the flavors just didn't blen well together - plus the pecan/bread crumb topping was mushy instead of crunchy.  Yuck.

This is an easy, impressive dish. Goes great with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh, steamed grean beans. I have also used crushed "Townhouse" crackers rather than bread crumbs for even better results. This has become my husband's favorite salmon recipe.

An excellent dish.  I did not have Pecans handy, so I subsituted slightly salted roasted almonds and ground them up to a fine grind in my coffee bean grinder.  It came out great.

Very good, quick n easy. I think next time I’ll try increasing the Dijon and reducing the honey and lived the idea shared about refrigerating the Dijon mix to thicken it up.

The mustard mix kept the salmon moist and flavorsome, while the pecan topping added texture and crunch.

My family LOVED this. Now here's something I accidentally did - I was measuring out the honey, and was two tablespoons into it when I realized the recipe said TEASPOONS not TABLESPOONS. 

But I tasted the sauce, and it actually worked. This recipe's pretty  good. What I would add is - not just serve with lemon, but sprinkle a quarter of a squeezed lemon juice on the breading AS its served....

BRAVO!

Wasn't bad yet the honey made it alittle too sweet. The dijon had a very good taste.I used Beaver hot mustard instead. I want it with zip.

This recipe came out great. I used frozen salmon fillets and Panko bread crumbs. I also used spicy  brown mustard instead of dijon ( i couldn't find any at the store). The topping was crunchy and tasty. The fish was perfectly cooked.

Holy cow was this good. Followed the directions to a tee except I didn't cut the salmon into individual pieces before cooking . Also turned the oven on broil at the end to get the nice browning on the top.

Thought I had too much topping on the dish until I took the first bite. It was perfect.

My first time reviewing a recipe after ten years of reading them.  Made this for company.  Everyone raved about it. One change...I used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain.  I felt compelled to say you can't go wrong with this one and its so easy. My husband is not a fan of fish and yet he kept telling me how delicious it tasted.

I used 1/4C each of olive oil, honey, and yellow mustard, with about a teaspoon of wine on the fish before adding the topping.  I left the big fillet I had in one piece, so it took a little longer to cook, but it was really delicious.

I've made this soany times I know this recipe by heart.
The thing is, fresh salmon can be pricey and frozen salmon doesn't taste right. With this recipe you can buy that frozen salmon and make it taste better!

I changed the recipe slightly and it was a great dish!!! I omitted the bread crumbs completely. I waited for the honey mustard mixture to cool before spreading maybe about half of the mixture on the salmon (enough that there was a nice coating without pouring off the fish) and refrigerated it for a 30 minutes. I keep the left over honey mustard mixture and made a cream sauce with it. The pecans stuck perfectly to the salmon when I was ready to put it in the oven. And I baked it as directed. For the cream sauce I added half a cube of vegetable bouillon to a cup of boiling water, then stirred in 3 tbsp of cornstarch and one clove of minced garlic . I put that in a sauce pan on med low, then added 3/4 cup of cream (milk would also work fine) then added the remaining honey mustard mixture. Let that come to a simmer and reduce the heat to low, stirring often. I'd say it would be ready in about 5 mins. Was awesome! Also this is gluten free if that's important to you. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Very tasty! Made a few changes: used a sweet hot mustard (Inglehoffer) instead on honey and dijon individually. Also added just a touch of pure maple syrup (about 2 tsp). After tasting, decided it needed just a little sauce so made additional butter/honey mustard/maple syrup as a drizzle sauce. I Will be making this often!

Turned out great...I did marinate it on the pan before baking, also scattered some onions on the baking sheet, then scraped them together with the fish skin and marinade fond. Super yummy. Served with red quinoa/tomato/avocado/cucumber salad and corn on the cob and nice beer in frosted glasses.

Excellent dish.  Only used three salmon but kept same toppings.  Served with steamed snow peas, squash and green and red peppers.  Then followed it with jalapeno pierogis.  Made a great meal.

This was good, but I agree with other reviewers that the glaze did not have a ton of flavor.  I guess a prefer more of a sauce for more flavor.  Also, I highly suggest halving the amount of bread crumbs this recipe calls for, because it is way too much bread crumbs.

Very good and simple. I used beer mustard & maple syrup. Could have used less mustard but wasn't overwhelming.   I would also put fresh lemon juice on the salmon before the salt and pepper.

Followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfectly.  The fish took about 20 minutes to cook, probably because of the topping.  No one was especially fond of the honey mustard with the fish.  They didn't mind eating it, but prefer a different flavour with their fish.

Made as recipe but used slivered almonds because I didn't have pecans. My husband said be sure to save recipe so can make again.

This was a really easy recipe.  I did take a few shortcuts however  like I used cranberry honey mustard that I purchased from a deli.  I used italian bread crumbs from a package instead of fresh and I didn't have pecans on hand so I used cashews.  It was delicious.  Even my kids who tend to be a little picky enjoyed it.

I made this recipe with Basa fillets instead of salmon and it was delicious! Very quick and easy to make and looked and tasted like a fancy gourmet meal!

I made this for my wife tonight. I read some of the reviews and cut the honey to 3 tablespoons, salt pepper, Old Bay seasoning, seasoned breadcrumbs and let the fish rest with the glaze on it. 

My wife couldn't stop raving about it and put up some to take for lunch tomorrow.

Oh yeah, I also toasted the pecans and chopped them up after it cooled down some.

Wow, these reviews did not mislead, it's that good. I did let the Dijon sauce sit on the fish about a half hour before adding the nut mixture. I also added Parmesan cheese to the nut and breadcrumb mixture. Awesome dish and very easy.

I'm not a fan of mustard but this was really good, I used more honey to make sure it was sweet. I also used panko bread crumbs since that's all I had at home. It all turned out great!

This was excellent.  Definitely make sure to thoroughly cook the salmon if you don't want it raw (dark pink). It should be very light pink or beige to be cooked through.

Overall it was good recipes but to me the honey was a little overkill for the amount called out. Next time if I make it again, I'll reduce the honey to half the amount. 

The balance of the mixture of the bread crumbs, walnuts (used instead of pecans), and butter was perfect. I would even add more parsley for sharpness.

I made this for dinner today and it was awesome.  all I did was cut down the portions because I only made 8 oz piece of salmon.   My husband does not care for salmon but tried a bit and came back for more.   Will have it again.   It was easy to put together, I did it in the afternoon and let it set till dinner.

Left the parsley out - just not a fan. Reduced the honey a little. Used softened, not melted, butter and spread the mixture on evenly. Nice recipe, easily changed to suit your personal tastes!

This is one of our family favorite recipes. The sockeye fresh out of the ocean with this dijon and pecan topping is lovely. I have left the bread crumbs out on occasion and it is just as good. YUUUM!

Absolutely delicious!  My hubby who isn't a fish lover ate most of it. Definitely my favorite recipe. I read  some of the reviews before I made and put the fish in the fridge after I put the honey/Dijon mix on it.  After I put the bread crumb/pecan mix I stuck it back in the fridge for 5mins.

my only alteration to the recipe was that I missed out the butter in the Honey Mustard sauce...... and it was still absolutely fantastic. We even had enough sauce left over for drizzling over asparagus. I will most certainly make this again.

Use a hot tangy mustard to add more flavor, less honey and more pecans to increase crunchiness.  Place honey/mustard mixture on salmon and refrigerate for 15 min-1hr. Apply breadcrumbs right before cooking.

I made the recipe as directed. KIt was a wodnerful dish. We loved the sweet layer between the fish and the coating added a good contrast. I may have chopped my pecans too finely on the first try  and would maybe not chop as much when i make again for more of a crunch. Otherwise everyone loved it and definitely going to be a go to meal in the future.

I made this as written and thoroughly enjoyed it. The only thing I forgot to add was the lemon, but it honestly didn't make or break the recipe. This was my first time working with salmon... I mean really working with it. Any other day I would just slap a few spices on it and stick it in the oven for a few minutes. Today however I wanted to get creative, and use the bag of pecans I purchased at work.
The sweetness of the honey works really well with the Salman. Sadly I didn't have normal honey, but a jalapeno honey I bought from the Farmers Market. The spice really added a bit of flavor, so no harm there. Next time I will more than likely mix the dry ingredients into the wet. That was the only problem I had with the cooking process because the dry ingredients didn't bake too well. Otherwise, great recipe. Will definitely make again, once I figure out what to pair it with. This time I wind up using a black rice, but that was a bit on the dull side.

Oh, yeah. The husband has now decided he likes salmon. He found the mustard a little sharp, so will reduce next time, and there will be a next time, and a time after that. Would not hesitate to make the recipe as written if it were just me.

I made this with Coho Salmon. Absolutely delicious. I doubled the amount of pecans as I had a huge filet. I don't follow recipes 100% but this was very tastey. Will make it again, often.

This was enjoyed here by my family. Those that didn't want the topping liked it very well with just the sauce. I had to change a couple things to use what I had at home but I did not stray far.***Made  this again& we had forgotten how delectable it was!! Mmmm! I accidentally forgot to put the honey in the sauce& I had to spoon it on & then put the coating on. So crunchy! It still was wonderful! I cut the honey back to 3 tbsp. Perfect! I also seasoned it with Old Bay right before baking. I had to use Panko for the bread crumbs & cilantro instead of parsley.

This is very good and EASY! I used Panco because that is what I had and would continue to use them. I had made enough crumbs to give our daughter some to try the recipe as well and she also loved it.  On our scale my husband and I give it a 9.5.  Will definitely use again!

This recipe is great! Made it exactly as written. Nice blend of honey, butter, mustard and pecans to give it a rich, sweet flavor on top of the deliciousness that salmon already is. The 4 yr old ate it ok but the 9 and 11 yr olds devoured it.

I've made this twice and loved it! Definitely one of my favorites. The second time I didn't realize until too late that I didn't have any pecans in my pantry so I used almonds instead and it was good both ways!

Love this. I don't care for mustard, but since I couldn't indentify the mustard in it, it was fine. Family thought it was "fine" so no rave reviews there, but they also didn't complain. I would reduce the breadcrumbs. I would like the nutty flavor more prominent. Cooking time was twice what the recipe stated. Also, coating wasn't crunchy, but was flavorful.

The sweetness of the sauce and the aftertaste of the pecans mix very well with the salmon. I recommend making jasmine rice with this. Add a little cinnamon to the jasmine rice to support that overall sweetness of the dish.

Delicious!   I made the minor change of decreasing the dijon mustard to about 2 Tbsp.   I used panko breadcrumbs instead of fresh and added 1/4 tsp salt to the breadcrumb/pecan mixture.    I also split the melted butter -- 1 Tbsp was drizzled over the bread/pecan coating to crisp it up a little bit.  We enjoy salmon at least twice a month so I have a lot of different prep methods -- my husband and 3 kids raved about this one!

Success! Used walnuts instead of pecans, it's what I had, and for the breadcrumbs used panko. I added some finely chopped fresh tarragon and thyme from my garden instead of the parsley. As written I was sure it would be too sweet for my taste so I decreased the honey by about half and that turned out perfect for me. I couldn't really taste the mustard; either I'll increase the amount next time or opt for a stronger flavored whole grained brand instead of the generic smooth Dijon. Before putting in the oven I spritzed the topping with an olive oil spritzer to make sure the topping browned nicely and it looked beautiful. I'm definitely making this again and keeping this recipe.

We really enjoyed this and it was easy to make!  I would add more pecans to the crust next time to ensure each piece is heavily coated.  Also not everyone may enjoy parsley so go light on that if you aren't sure and you can have some chopped fresh parsley on the side for those who desire it.  I also recommend to serve with lemon wedges!

This is the best salmon recipe I've ever come across. It's super easy and there's really no way to mess it up. It always comes out delicious. I cook this often. Living in Hawaii, I use macadamia nuts instead of pecans. Thank you to whoever shared this recipe.

This recipe is good, and very similar to one I have made for years. I don't use any honey or Dijon, but add a cup of light brown sugar. When the salmon bakes, it makes almost a candy coating that I prefer. Also, nix the breadcrumbs.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  Great flavor and so easy.  If you are looking for a way to vary salmon, this is a keeper.  Loved the sweet honey/Dijon mustard hint under the topping.  I use seasoned Panko breadcrumbs which increased its crunch factor.  I served it on white rice with a few bits of pecan tossed in to carry out the flavor theme.  Would serve this to company anytime!

After using this recipe for so many years, I thought it was about time I wrote to thank "Chris" who submitted it!  It's been my go-to salmon recipe for such a long time now, and the only changes I made were to make an easy recipe even easier! I use panko crumbs instead of fresh (no crumbling needed)and instead of putting the raw pecans on the salmon before baking, I use the tiny pre-toasted pecan pieces from Trader Joe's (Yes, I am that lazy!) and sprinkle them on before serving along with dried parsely. Like reviewer Santon, I wait until the topping mixture thickens before I slather it on.  Thank you, Chris!

So delicious, definitely a new favorite way to cook salmon. I used panko instead of bread crumbs, perfect crisp.

Delicious!  I loved the crumb/nut topping.  I'll try cutting down on the butter next time to keep it a bit healthier.

2 star rating for me. I don't mind Dijon and thought this coating would be better than it was. I made it without any adjustments and just how the recipe suggested. The Dijon flavor was too strong- perhaps cut back on that but even then I would not make this again.

I made this using stealhead, seasoned breadcrumbs, and omitting the pecans (for dh, who doesn't like nuts), and it was fantastic! A total winner that dh (who also doesn't like fish) said he would have again!

Aside from a comment of 'oh that looks gross' from my son.  One bite and he was hooked.  I used a big salmon filet from Costco, cut it in half and used the measurements here, with the exception of the mustard.  For that I only used 2 tablespoons.  Some fresh from the hive honey thanks to a friend who is a beekeeper and we were in business.  Very very tasty, not overpowering.  Served with plain white rice; didn't need anything more since the salmon was flavorful enough

I just tried this tonight, as we had some extra pecans.  Yummmmy!  We have fish once a week and usually salmon so I love to try new recipes.  I didn't have any parsley this time so I just used some dry basil.  I also cut it in half and had plenty for about a lb and 1/4.  Instead of butter I used about 1 tsp. olive oil and half the honey.  Until writing this I didn't think I changed it much.  Very good and especially loved the advice on how to determine the cooking time.   :)

Great recipe. No one in my family (other than me) is a salmon fan...until tonight! They all loved it. I would recommend, however, using aluminum foil on the baking sheet to prevent the skin from sticking.

this salmon recipe is very good. I've made it twice so far. Be very careful not to over bake as the pecans burn easily. My husband loved it too.

Wow this was soooo good! I made complete topping ingredients, and put them over only four fillets, instead of six. This just meant more topping per fillet. WE LOVED it! Also, I only had 2 Tbsp Dijon, so I used 1 Tbsp regular mustard in addition to the 2 Tbsp Dijon.

I love this recipe I made extra of the crumb mixture and put it in the freezer so on those long work days I just use it and it saves a lot of time. I make it exactly as written but I have used maple syrup instead of honey (didn't have any on hand) and the family loved the slight maple flavor.

Made this recipe with Sockeye salmon and my husband absolutely loved it! I am not really a salmon eater, but even I liked it. It was super-easy to make, ready really quickly, and the salmon stayed so moist. We are having a brunch at our house next month and I am definitely adding this to the menu.

Very nice.  My husband is never crazy about salmon but loved this.  I used ingredients as listed except a mixture of chopped hazelnuts and pecans, and panko instead of breadcrumbs.  I also let the honey mustard mixture sit on the fish for several hours before I cooked it.  This will become one of my regular recipes for salmon and possibly other fish.  We did not think it was overly sweet.  Thanks Chris!

This dish was absolutely amazing!  I made a single portion just for myself since my boyfriend isn't a fish eater and I wasn't sure how my 7 yr old son would react to it. Well my son loved it and my father, who isn't a salmon person, raved about it.  I cant wait to make it again. So easy to make also, I put all the dry ingredients in a baggie and banged it with a rolling pin for easy cleanup.  I used about a teaspoon of splenda instead of honey (i didnt have any).  It was delicious! AWESOME recipe!

YUMMM! My boyfriend is not a huge eater but he finished all the fish on his plate when I made this! Super easy and delicious. I bought 2 half found fillets instead of the 6 and I used all of the marinade. It made the fish extra delicious. Heated it up the next day and I thought it was even BETTER! I will definitely make this again.

Very delicious! I'll definitely keep this in my recipe arsenal when we have company. The only change I made was subbing hazelnuts for pecans, since that was what I had on-hand.

Yummy! I made the sauce for 6 servings but only used 3 fillets. Instead of brushing them I dumped the whole sauce onto the fish - very flavorful.   I also used almonds instead of pecans.  Will def. make again

Loved it!  I too had to make a few substitutions based on what was in my pantry.  I used walnuts instead of pecans and I didn't have any dijon mustard, but had a cranberry mustard.  went nice with the walnuts.  Thanks

This was really good, espeically considering the fact that I am not really a fish eater.  I loved the recipe, but I think I might try it on chicken or another type of fish next time.  I am not a huge salmon fan, but I know that if I were this would have been an AMAZING recipe!!!

This recipe was sooo phenomenal!  I used a tantalizing mustard instead of dijon.  I wish I could've gotten the flavor further into the fillet but overall it was mouth watering!  I'll definitely be making it again!

Love this recipe! Was super quick and easy to make, and delish! Instead of using breadcrumbs, I subbed cornflake crumbs (gluten-sensitivity) and it was great.

This was pretty good! Next time, I think I'll increase the mustard mixture (but change the mustard:honey ratio to 3:1) because the taste didn't come through as strongly as I would have liked. Be sure to use FRESH breadcrumbs and Dijon mustard not the yellow stuff! It makes a world of difference. Next time, I might try using my homemade grainy mustard.

This was amazing!  I'm not a big fan of salmon, but the flavor of this fish was wonderful.  It was both sweet and tangy and the crunch of the pecans added a great texture.  I used Italian Bread crumbs on mine and it was fabulous.  I will definitely make this again!

I am usually skeptical about anything with mustard in it, but this is a really good recipe.  I measured everything out except the honey I just threw in there.  I think I should have put a little more honey in it and then this meal would have been a full 5 stars.  A quick, easy and delicious recipe!  Thank you!

I am new to the fish-eating world and am constantly looking for fresh ideas for fixing Salmon.  This recipe was amazing.  The fish flaked apart and had a wonderful flavor.  My husband, a long time fish eater, scarfed down two pieces in no time.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe, will make again and again.

TERRIFIC!!!!!! After catching some Kokanee Salmon over the  weekend we had a fishing partner over for lunch. He said he normally didn't like Salmon but  he liked this recipe  so much he asked for a copy of it. To my chagrin instead of giving me all his fish, he said he was going to keep some from our next salmon trip to cook with this recipe.(Drat, I screwed myself on that one)

This recipe is almost identical to Baked Dijon Salmon, another recipe on this site.  We love that recipe and we love this recipe!  I used 4 salmon fillets, and to make it easy, used 2 Tbsp dijon, 2 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp honey.  I cut the crumbs and pecans down to 1/4 cup each - it was plenty.  Highly recommend this recipe!

It was pretty good! I liked the crunchiness of it but I think sweet marinade is just not my thing when it comes to salmon. I'm glad I tried it though.

My husband really enjoyed this, but my two sons (who usually do like salmon) wouldn't touch it.  I thought it was good, but not quite as good as some of the other recipes we have used to prepare salmon in the past.  I think the quality of the ingredients makes a big difference, I read some reviews that stated that there was not a lot of flavor, but I used a high quality full strength stone ground mustard and a good local honey and we had no problems with depth of flavor.   put fresh french bread and pecans in the food processor for the breading and it turned out great.  I did use another reviewer's tip on refrigerating with the mustard sauce spread on it for about 20 min before cooking.  thanks for the recipe!

EXCELLENT! you could almost say i didn't really follow the recipe... i was out of pecans, so i used walnuts, i only had seasoned bread crumbs, and honey mustard, no dijon!  but it still tasted great!  i will say, if i make it again, using the same ingredients, walnuts & seasoned bread crumbs, i will add some parmesan cheese to the topping mixture.  overall, excellent recipe, and i will definately be making it again soon!

Nice recipe - I used Sea Salt. The fish was moist and the honey mustard was a nice addition ( I put it all over the salmon). Personally, I think there was too much topping (which I only put on the top). It's a nice alternative to our favorite Salmon with Dill sauce.

This is a great recipe especially for last minute dishes.  I served it with rice and corn on the side which made it a perfect dish.  The parsley gives it a great color and a little something extra.  However, since i have certain allergies to Gluten i used crushed up gluten free pretzels instead of bread crumbs and it holds together just the same.  Goes well with a nice white wine.

This is absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I always keep a bag of fresh bread crumbs in the freezer and I would recommend not using anything else. It went together quickly and even though my coho salmon fillets were not very thick, I did have to roast them for a couple of extra minutes.  I'll make this again and again.

GREAT dish. I prepared it (raw) ahead of time and froze it. I separating the fish, the crust and the sauce. Thaw the night before. It was SO quick after work. Brushed on the sauce, dumped on the coating and thew it in the oven for 20 min! mmmm. The whole family loved it! What a treat!

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I had never even eaten salmon before (I'm not sure why) but we loved the crunchy coating.  The first time I made it just like it said.  The second time I omitted the mustard (just our preference) and cut the bread crumbs in half so we could taste more of the pecans.  It was great and we will make it again.

melt in your mouth delish! I only used half the amount of honey, but that's because I don't like my food too sweet.

This could've been better. I had issues with keeping the topping from overbaking in my uncooperative oven, so the final product ended up being dry. Boyfriend wasn't thrilled about the flavor either. Sorry! It's a good base to start from though.

This is great.  Its simple and tasty and really highlights the flavor of the salmon.  I would not change a thing.  I used Trader Joe's dijon mustard (its got a good kick) and it cam out beautifully.  The 10 mins per inch was perfect.  This is a keeper!

I loved this recipe! I agree with some other reviews that it was a tad on the sweet side but I think next time I'll just add more mustard. I might decrease the amount of bread crumbs as well.  I'll definitely make this again!

This is phenomenal! It took about 5 minutes to prepare, and exactly 10 minutes to cook to perfection. The balance of flavors was just right, and the coating added a wonderful crunch. Love this recipe!

Really really good!  My hubby loved it which is a big deal with any fish dish.  The only thing I did different was to double the "dip" and the "breading" and dip the fish in the liquid and then roll in it the crumbs/pecans so that it was completely covered, not just topped.  SO GOOD!

The only thing I changed was I used panko bread crumbs instead of fresh.  Ultimate crunch!  It really made a nice crunchy topping for the salmon.  We loved it!

Very good. I couldn't give it 5 stars because I feel salmon in itself has all the flavor it needs. A lot of added calories here that aren't at all needed. It is good and looks impressive but I would save it for white fish.

My family thought the horseradish in the dijon was distracting, but I thought this dish was great.  The butter and honey somewhat carmelized the pecans and resulted in a sweet, crunchy coating for the fish.  I'll make this again, but I'll probably use a yellow mustard/mayonaise mix in lieu of the dijon to suit the husband and the kid :-)

Awesome recipe.  When I make it again I will use less honey and a little more spicy dijon mustard.  It was a little too sweet.  Overall, delicious and moist.

Excellent dish for Christmas dinner. Husband and one of our guests do not like salmon. So I made both salmon and swordfish for our dinner. I used the same pecan coating to top the swordfish. Worked very well and both entrees were a big hit with family and friends.

Couldn't decide between 4 or 5 stars because it did require some modifications. I took previous reviewers suggestions and reduced the honey to 3 tsp, increased the pecans to 3/4 cups, and chilled the sauce before applying to salmon. I wish I had reduced the breadcrumbs though.  It was delicious and super easy!

Made this for our Christmas dinner, just my husband and I and toddler boys. Although the boys didn't eat it (they never really eat anything), we LOVED it. I substituted maple syrup (thanks to a previous review) for the honey and walnuts for the pecans. Served with herb buttered baby carrots and zucchini, and Garlic Mashed Red Skin Potatoes (also from allrecipes.com). WIth some white wine, a wonderful Christmas meal. The parsley made the pink salmon look so festive!!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner this year and it was fabulous.  My friends and family oohed and aahed.  The honey and pecan melds with the mustard to create a sweet, tangy flavor that is scrumptious. Use wild natural salmon if you can.

This was really good.  I used honey Dijon and cut down on the regular honey.  I wanted a little more sauce than what I had and will increase that next time. I was surprised at how nicely the flavors complemented the fish - nothing was overpowering and you still tasted the salmon.   Cooking time is spot on.

Pecans complement salmon really well.  The dish has sublime savory & sweet flavors.  It tastes as though it was a much more complicated recipe and costs much more than it actually does.  Chris, thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't have breadcrumbs, so I used grape nut cereal.  it kept the topping crunchy and tasted great.  I also refrigerated the honey mustard combo like another reviewer suggested.  My boyfriend loved it!  I'm even thinking of making it for my dad who doesn't usually like fish.  Yummy.

This is one of those dishes that looks really fancy and tastes delicious but is very easy to prepare -- my kind of recipe! Followed other reviewers suggestions to increase the pecans in the pecan/breadcrumb mixture and also refrigerated the honey-butter-mustard mix for a little bit. Will make this dish again.

I did not eat this but made it for my husband and friends.  All said that it was wonderful.  Best of all, my husband (who only mildly likes salmon) said that he would have eaten more if it had been there.  Definitely a keeper!

This was fantastic. I made one mistake while making it. To mix the crumbs and the pecans I put them into a food chopper. It just turned the pecans into crumbs. This was okay but i would have rather had bigger pieces of nuts or just skip the bread crumbs all together

A nice change to my plain poached salmon.  My eight year old said it was okay, while my five year old said I should make it everyday.  It's all a matter of taste.

Made exactly as directed.  Just didn't like it at all.  Maybe I would have liked it with fresh salmon instead of frozen, but I doubt it.

Only thing I did different was mix bread crumb mixture in a food processor with 1 tbsp melted butter. Maybe I used to much of the bead crumb mix but it was just ok for me. My son who loves salmon didnt like the sweetness of the honey mustard sauce either. I think its safe to say we prefer grilled fish to this recipe and probably wont make it again.

Quick, easy, tasty, impressive & healthy!  Used feedback from others - used prepared honey mustard, added some garlic, used panko breadcrumbs to reduce breadiness and increased pecans for crunch.  "Marinated" salmon in dressing prior to adding panko/pecans.  Baked according to directions and it came out perfect.  Served with brown rice and steamed veges - left enough calories for dessert!  YUM!

excellent recipe! I did have to tweak a little bit as i didn't have any pecans or breadcrumbs. All i did different, because i had to omit those ingredients was replace the breadcrumbs with crushed captain crunch cereal, and still it came out delicious! Will definitely make again

THIS IS AWESOME!!!   Im not much of a fish fan but I LOVED this and so did my hubby!  The only thing I didn't different was that I used sliced almonds instead of pecans because that's what I had on hand,and It was still great:)

I cooked this for my husband and I last night and it was the best.  I have never cooked salmon before and am not a huge fan of fish(my husband loves salmon).  It was very easy to make and tasted amazing.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I changed the recipe a little bit though.  I did half djion mustard and and spicy mustard to add a little more flavor.

Easy & Great taste BUT, We used more honey than stated in the recipe  MY ADVISE is to adjust ratio of Dijon Mustard to Honey to your own personal taste.

Absolutely delish!! My husband and I eat fish - especially salmon - a lot.. so I am always looking for new seafood recipes. My husband definitely said that I have to make it again!  I only made 2 portions, so had to divide everything from the recipe in half... and still had a lot of the bread crumb mixture, so maybe cut down on that a little.. and it's perfect! Yumm!

One of my faves and I make it often. I use hard (not runny) honey; the really grainy mustard and usually make both mixtures in advance to let the flavors blend a little.

My mother and I enjoyed this recipe immensely. It was very easy to prepare and the tip about using Honey Mustard dressing for the sauce was an excellent one. I prepared mine at 350 degrees instead of 400 because other things were baking as well. In the end I had to sprinkle on paprika to give the dish some color. I will prepare this dish again very soon at the correct temperature to see the difference. Overall, an excellent, easy-to-prepare, nutritious way to prepare salmon. Can hardly wait to try this on some Copper River Salmon.

I thought this meal was very good!  My entire family ate all of the salmon (which includes the picky 3 & 6 yr olds).  I really liked the sweet flavor the mustard gives to this dish.  It was pretty easy to make as well, which is an added bonus.

This was absolutely delicious!  My boyfriend, who doesn't eat fish, actually ate two pieces!  My only substitution was to use dried dill in place of the parsley, which I forgot to buy.  Served it with Couscous and fresh green beans.  I will definitely make this again!

The crunchy topping on this was wonderful. I am rating it a 3 because I feel like the recipe called for too much dijon mustard. I will try this again another day and only use 1/2 as much mustard.

This recipe was AMAZING!!! Super easy, super fast and it taistes GREAT! I didn't have fresh parsely so I used one and a half tablespoons of dried parsley. I also added a tablespoon of soft butter to the bread crumb mixture to hold it together. It turned out great. I will definitely be making this again soon.

very quick and easy to make. I made this recipe at a practice with my team for a 4-H contest and every one loved it. My brother said that the coating over powered the fish, but every one els there said that it did not.

This is an excellent recipe. I used honey mustard and still used the honey in addition because I like things to have a sweet taste.  It was GREAT!  Can't wait to have it again.

Absoloutely lovely..thank you Chris.  I amde this at a dinner party with 2 very fussy eaters and they adored it.  I fried the the walnuts in butter and honey before hand (just a small amount of butter) and then refigerataed before adding to the salad.  YUM!!

Only alteration was that I used canned breadcrumbs instead of fresh and cooked for longer than 10 minutes per inch (but I think the oven was cold).  It was delicious!!!  The birthday dinner went off without a hitch, and everyone raved over the salmon.  It was fantastic!    My only concern is that salmon gets expensive (this was a special dinner).  For the first run I wanted to use salmon because I didn't know if the recipe would overpower a lighter fish.  I may start experimenting.  Also, I agree with another reviewer - I'd minimize the breadcrumbs and amp up the pecans!

We didn't alter the directions much other than to suit ingredients we had.  We used a honey dijon mustard and dried parsley rather than fresh.  Delicious!  Tasted great even as leftovers for lunch the next day.

This was very good. The salmon was moist, and the combination of the pecans (which I toasted first) with the mustard mixture tasted great! I didn't have fresh breadcrumbs so I had to use store-bought. I think fresh would be better, because the kind you buy are almost ground into dust! I will definitely make this again!

This was really great! We are big on Salmon in my house and my normal routine is baking salmon with a sweet raspberry chipotle sauce, because I prepared it the night b4 for myself I was searching for a quick new way to prepare it for them and found this recipe. I had all the ingredients in my cabinet and rather than regular dijon mustard I has a honey dijon blend on hand.  I used that using the specified amount of honey and all things remained unchanged. I didn't have time to refrigerate it but it baked up nicely! my family loved it and even the fickle ones asked for 2nds and 3rds.  I went back for more myself!

Delicious!  I used Ritz cracker in place of bread crumbs (didn't have any) & added 2 cloves of chopped garlic to sauce.  It was so flavorful.  I baked in foil packets...no mess.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  My wife who doesn't like salmon ate this and changed her mind.  Very good.  Made with chopped hazelnuts rather than pecans as it was all that was on hand, probably would have rather had pecans, but still very good, easy and delicious.

Great recipe, I make this a lot and love it more every time but always decrease the butter to 1 tbsp. That way the mustard mix sticks better to the salmon and it cuts back on saturated fat. More pecans are a must too!

Incredibly easy and delicious. I'm a college student and I love to cook so I'm always looking for easy new recipes to wow my friends and family with. I agree with other reviews that there should be less bread crumbs and more pecans to intensify the texture. Otherwise, spectacular!

This was fine but I didn't love the flavors - something about the honey mustard tasted a bit off to me - I used a more expensive "hotter" mustard and just regular honey and even less honey than the recipe calls for.  I ommitted any bread crumbs and just used finely processed walnuts (what I had)...I ommitted parsely because I didn't have any handy...

We really liked it but I did make a few minor changes. I added my salt and pepper along with a few other spices to my breadcrumb and pecan mix.

Great way to fix salmon. Since my husband is not a big salmon fan I used cod for him with the same coating. Overall, something that I would make again.

Excellent recipe! I did cut back a bit on the breadcrumbs and I drizzled a small amount of olive oil over the topping.  Found this to be a delicious way to prepare salmon.

This was very good.  The bread crumbs needed something.  Being a novice cook, I don't know what.  They were very dry and added nothing to the taste.  I will be cooking this again (my wife says so), but will probably omit the crumbs.  Thanks for a good recipe.

Nice flavour; easy to prepare.  Children enjoyed brushing honey mixture on salmon and then sprinkling pecans.  May try with candied pecans next time.

My family was not wild about this recipe.  The crust ended up getting scraped off to eat the salmon underneath.  One positive this was that the crust kept the fish very moist and tender.  If I make this again, I will alter it a bit.

This is a great recipe.  I followed a couple of recommendations like adding some garlic to the liquid mix and refrigderating for an hour.  This is excellent.  The honey carmalizes and makes the pecans so delicious.  I made the mistake of putting too much of the mustard sauce on the fish, but that is because I love toppings.  This is an awesome recipe and can't wait to make it again.

My family and I loved this recipe! We took the suggestion to turn oven to broil the last few minutes. Also, I used 2 T spicy brown mustard and 1 T honey mustard as well as Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Definitley a keeper!!

This was a great and easy recipe! I used store bought honey mustard to make it even easier. Next time I think I will marinate it as was suggested to let the Salmon soak in the flavor. But I will definitely make this again.

This recipe rocks!!!  It was absolutely delicious.  It also happened to be the first time I cooked salmon.  We loved the sweet and spice of the dijon sauce and the added richness of the pecans.  I also used seasoned bread crumbs for a little added flavor.  I may broil for a few min next time to add more crunchiness to the top.  Overall this was a fabulous meal and will be definitely making it again soon.  Thanks!!

Great salmon recipe.  I made two small changes.  I substituted just a bit of real maple syrup for a little of the honey.  After topping with the crumb coating, I sprayed the filets lightly with cooking spray to make them a bit more crunchy.  I might try a margarine spray next time and decrease the amount of bread crumbs as some others have suggested.  The taste is fantastic!

Delicious, fast & easy!  I used Halibut (it's what I had on hand), reduced honey to 2tsp, changed mustard to spicy & used more nuts & less bread crumbs.  The family loved it!  I'll make it again.

Dinner tonight got rave reviews, even from my mom, who doesn't much like salmon.  Thanks!

Update:  This has become a regular in our household.  I never order salmon out anymore, as I know I can make it better at home.

I hated salmon, never ate it, just couldn't do it, but for health reasons I needed to eat it. I asked for recipes to change my mind, got this one and now I am a convert. This recipe is awesome! I used panko crumbs instead of regular for extra crunch and I had to leave out the parsley. The pecans mixed with the glaze was heavenly. I had to resist eating it all and actually ate the leftovers the next day willingly. I think a really fresh piece of salmon is essential. It didn't taste fishy at all. I will definitely make this again and make my husband try it too!! Thanks AR exchange!

Definitely worth making.  I only have a couple of suggestions that stay true to the original recipes.  1.  Use course ground dijon, as it has more texture and depth of flavor.  2.  Use Panko instead of bread crumbs.  This also gives a coarser texture and is nice contrast to the softness of the salmon. 3.  Enjoy! This is delicious.

This recipe was ok. I followed all direction except used walnuts instead of pecans. It was too breaddy for me. I prefer my BBQ salmon much more to this. I need more sweetness onm the salmon. The mustard was a nice flavor though. I probably would not make again.

This recipe is really rich and decadent.  I used glazed walnuts instead of pecans and it was good.  Would save this for special occasions, I usually eat salmon because it is a fairly light meal.

Very good, but if done as recipe written, breadcrumbs definitely overpower, too much. Will definitely make again and use 1/2 of the breadcrumbs with more pecans. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a scrumptious dish.  I substituted panko for bread crumbs and loved the result.  Just enough honey for a slight sweetness and the mustard added the spice.  Four stars!

This is an outstanding recipe.  My young kids (4, 6,and 8yrs old), LOVED this!  It was so easy to make!  Perfect for a Sunday night dinner when your busy with activities all day.  F.Y.I., I had to sub the salmon for talapia because that's all we had, and it was fabulous!

Excellent! I didnt have bread crumbs, so I substituted french fried onions, added a bit of garlic to the marinade and a bit of rosemary to the topping, and didn't have pecans...but had walnuts. Even with these changes and substites it was the best homemade salmon we have ever had. I can't wait to try again when I actually have pecans!

This was a nice change for dinner. I used a large filet of salmon from Costco and used the advice of marinating the fish in the mustard sauce for and hour. I used half Dijon and half spicy brown mustard. and I used lots of pecans for the topping.

Very good.  My husband really enjoyed this and he doesn't usually like fish, but said I should have this recipe and make it again.  The topping adds a great flavor to the fish.  I followed the recipe pretty closely but added a little more honey than it said, which I would cut back on next time.  Served with fresh Sour Dough bread and asparagus.

Awesome and easy to make. I think the high oven temp and not too much baking time lends to the very moist and crisp on the outside textures. I'll definitely make again!

Great recipe! I used frozen thawed pacific salmon.  I couldn't quite taste the pecans, perhaps because I ground them too finely.  Next time I may decrease the bread crumbs and increase the pecans and leave some in larger pieces, also maybe add a little salt to this mixture. One of the best salmon recipes I have tried, it looked beautiful too!

This was my first attempt at salmon and I was very pleased. We had guests over so I was a bit nervous to try out a new recipe but everyone LOVED it. It was very easy.  We will make this again for sure!

Loved the texture of the salmon but the flavor wasn't enough for me. Next time I will use more mustard and less bread crumbs.

This was PHENOMENAL!!!!  I made it to a T per the instructions and it as soooo delicious!  I did have to cook mine a little longer than the recipe indicated but that was the only difference.  This is making it's way into our normal rotation!

I'm reviewing this again because it is sooo worth it! I made it exactly as stated with Panko break crumbs and cooked it on a cedar plank on the grill.Outstanding!! First review: Loved it! I accidently used maple syrup instead of honey and it was nice.

This was outstanding! I marinated the finish in white wine for 2 hours then applied the mustard sauce. I added dill paste, and tabasco sauce to add a little kick. tasted like it came from a resturaunt. This is a KEEPER!!

I would have preffered either the bread crumb/ pecan as a topping, or the honey mustard as a topping. The two together just made the bread crumb topping soggy.

For not being a big fan of salmon, I definitely enjoyed this recipe. The only changes I made to the recipe were 1) no pecans (allergies) and 2) out of regular dijon mustard so I used a horseradish version...very good!

Great Recipe! I use 6 oz portions and serve 4. Cut down honey to 3 tsp and breadcrumbs to 1/3 cup. Also spritzed olive oil on top with my Misto. Served with rosemary roasted potatoes and asparagus.

As I was putting on the bread crumbs, it looked like it was going to be just to much so I used only about half the topping.  It was delish!!! And quick. And easy!!!  Mr. Picky had wanted to grill the salmon the way we usually do but it was just to cold outside so I talked him into trying it this way for a change.     Mr. Picky loved it!!!

Fantastic! This is our new favorite salmon dish.  I would make this for company.  My husband loved it too.  I marinated the salmon in the honey mustard sauce (plus garlic) for 1 hour and used very finely chopped walnuts since I was out of pecans.  I refrigerated the honey mustard sauce so it got thick as a reviewer recommended.  Before baking I recoated the salmon with the honey mustard before adding the nut topping.  It was scrumptious!

This was so fantastic and SO EASY to make.  My husband doesn't like salmon so I made his with talapia and it was very good.

I used only two filets, and cut the ingredients to 1/3. It was delicious, although I baked the salmon for 15 minutes, total. Delish.... AND healthy.

This was fantastic - I made it for New Year's Eve dinner this year up on the ski slopes at Mt. Snow in Vermont. Used one large salmon fillet (rather than individual ones) since I was feeding 12 people for dinner. It came out beautifully and I couldn't believe the number of compliments that I got - even from folks who don't usually like salmon. The best? People asked for me to make it again the next night! : )
Thanks so much Chris for sharing. This one's going into "my usuals".

Fabulous recipe; I, too, cut back on the topping a bit only because I didn't want to overwhelm the flavor of the salmon.  This was easy and impressive on the plate.

Very tasty. I eliminated the pecans because my son has a nut allergy, but it still came out very good. I love salmon and it was nice to have a new way to make it. I'd definitely make this again.

Delicious stuff!  I'm not a fan of measuring, so I don't really know how much of the ingredients I used, but it's easy enough to put together.  Instead of brushing on the honey, dijon, and butter mixture, I dipped the salmon in it then dipped in the pecan and bread crumb mix, like you would do for fried chicken.  That way was a bit messier, but I was able to coat all of the salmon.  Bf and I both loved it, and bf didn't even notice there was dijon mustard in the salmon.  (He hates mustard)  Thank you very much for the recipe!  We'll make again.  :o)

We really liked this one - nice flavor and texture. I'd make it again. It seemed like I ended up with too much topping; a lot of it fell off during the baking time. I served it with rice pilaf, and it went well together.

It was very tasty! I would advise more bread crumbs... that's personal preference. I also did not have dijon and used the german stone ground mustard which was a little strong for my taste(i used less than claled for) so I will try the dijon for sure next time. Super easy!

Very nice salmon dish.  The sweetness of the sauce is balanced out by the breadcrumbs and it all comes together well.  I marinated mine for about 30 minutes before putting it in the oven.  Mine took about 20 minutes to bake to our liking.

I followed this recipe exactly except I used honey mustard instead.  I was so excited about this recipe and when I ate it, I was really disappointed.  It lacked flavor and just wasn't what it was made out to be.

This recipe was a very good choice. When my 10 year old daughter likes it, it's a hit!  Everyone in the house loved this one.  I didn't have djon mustard, I used regular and only had about 3tbls of honey so I used about 2 tbls of brown sugar.  Very tasty!

This was good, but would be better on a white fish.

My husband and I both loved this dish! My kids loved the topping :) For the topping: I didn't have dijon mustard, so I replaced with honey mustard, coarsly chopped pecans, rather than finely chopped, and seasoned with coarse black pepper and sea salt. This recipe is certainly a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

My family of 6 loved this. I used seasoned bread crumbs but still added fresh parsley. Also, I used the salad honey almonds from grocery store salad section instead of pecans. First meal my husband has enjoyed in a long time. My young boys loved it. The sweet taste sold them on it while I was happy they were getting the super protein.

Great recipe for a busy weeknight!  You can do all of the prep work in the time it takes for the oven to preheat.  The flavor combination was pretty good, especially the honey mustard.  My husband wouldn't eat it, but he only likes fish that's fried. :(  I subbed dried parsley for fresh.

I thought this was very good, but my husband said it was interesting (his way of being polite)... I think it was the dijon mustard that threw everyone off.  They are not used to that flavor in my cooking...  Otherwise, I'd say that it was really good.  Loved the outer crunchy topping!  Maybe I'll leave out the mustard next time!

I love salmon.  It's expensive, but I try to eat it whenever it's on sale.  I especially like it raw or smoked, on a bagel.  This was bland.  The coating was kinda bland and didn't compliment the salmon at all.  The coating wasn't bad, and it made a pretty presentation, but it just isn't right for this fish.

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have pecans so I used walnuts instead.  I also used the panko style bread crumbs.  The closest to dijon mustard I had on hand was sweet hot mustard by hickory farms and I think it added a great flavor!  I will definitely make this again!

Good flavor but it needs something to make it crispier.  Maybe drizzling butter on it before baking.

This recipe was very tasty and easy to make.  I substituted the butter with canola oil to mix with the mustard and honey.  Loved the crunch of the pecans with the sweet/tart of the honey mustard underneath. Awesome!

Made this tonight for my husband and I. He is not a salmon fan, but said this was asbolutely great. I loved it too. It was easy and fast, which always helps. I did make one change - didn't have parsley on hand but we love cilantro, so used that instead. Great blend of flavors.

This recipe is awesome. I tried it for myself for dinner. Though, I did alter it a bit. Instead of using melted butter, I used vegetable cooking oil- because I am allergic to dairy. I crushed pine nuts and almonds, instead of the pecans. It was so tasty, I have decided to use it for my Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner. Not everyone I invite will eat poultry or meat- so this is perfect.

Spectacular Dish.
I used just a little less honey.  I used a white sage raw honey which I buy threw EBay from The Flying bee Ranch.   This honey made such a smooth wonderful sweetness to the salmon.   
I used less bread crumbs & more pecans.  I usually make my own but this time I used Contadina Roasted garlic and savory herb.  It was good and quick.  
I fixed this for my book club and everyone was moaning.  It was a very nice dinner. 
I put the fish on top of a bed of creamy mashed potatoes and served with steamed asparagus, Caesar salad, Rosemary homemade bread and English Trifle.

Left pecans in large pieces and the toasted pecan crunch made this a 5 star recipe.  Mom begged me to make it again, and give the recipe to my sister, too.

Delicious! I used dried tarragon because I didn't have any parsley and added soy sauce, fresh lemon juice and fresh minced garlic to the mustard mixture. I brushed some of the mustard mixture onto the fish then mixed the rest with the pecan crumb mixture and spread it on top. Baked for 20 mins (2-inch thick fillet) at 400 degrees. Wonderful flavor. Next time I might marinate the salmon in soy sauce for 30 mins before coating with the toppings. Served this with fresh broccoli and cauliflower and brown rice. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This was very, very tasty and easy to make. The coating was a little too heavy though. If I make it again I would probably go easier on the breadcrumbs. Delicious otherwise!

Wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting it to be considering the ingredients. But it was still good and pretty easy to throw together.  The cooking time was just right for me and I also turned on the broiler after it cooked for 8 minutes and broiled it for about 2 to crisp up the topping.  Made exactly as written and served over long grain and wild rice.

Even my 3 kids liked this!  Made it just as the recipe was written, and it was great.  Some of us thought it could have used more of the sauce-but that's because we like sauce.  I served it over long grain rice.  Healthy, really good, and super easy!!

I loved this recipe!  The flavors were great.  I think next time I'll go easy on the bread crumbs and maybe increase the amount of pecans I put in the topping.  Overall, it was wonderful.

I used smoked almonds because that was what I had. I also turned the broiler on at the last minute to lightly toast the top. It was the best salmon I have ever had.

Recipe tasted fine, just not any flavor you could really define, just kind of bland. If you don't like spicy, this is your recipe.

I really liked this recipe. It was tasty but maybe a tad too sweet for me. I think next time I will use a bit less honey and use a little less of the bread and nut topping. I will make it again.

Very good and simple to make.  I used Ritz cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs, and it was delicious.  We had a little extra glaze and so sprinkled some on top because it was so yummy.

Excellent recipe.  I did coat the fillets quite heavily with the honey dijon mix, and let them marinate for a couple of hours.  This one was a big hit and I'll definitely make it again.

This is AWESOME!  I have never eaten salmon this good anywhere.  We make it regularly.  I usually end up with a bunch of extra topping, so you can scale back on the bread crumbs and pecans and still have plenty.  The foil tip makes clean-up a snap.

I was let down by this recipe.  I was expecting a lot more.  My husband didn't like it mostly because of the honey mustard base.  I think it would have been better without the honey mustard. I wish the sauce would have cooked together more for a real gooey crunch.

This was a fabulous recipe!! I love salmon and pecans. The topping was just right - not too sweet, and not to mustardy. I would recommend this for anyone who love salmon. I would recommend baking it for closer to 20 minutes, covering it for the last 10. Thanks for a great addition to my recipe file.

This was simple and good...only had grainy mustard so not sure if that made a big difference.  I think some sort of a sauce...just a little would make it better.  I used frozed salmon.

Thanks

This was very good, I'll be making it again. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to put the honey mixture in the fridge for 15 minutes to thick it up a bit. Good suggestion!

Excellent recipe!  I put this meal together and had it in the oven quick!!  Great fast recipe for a spectacular looking (like you worked all day) meal!  Kids loved it too and it left-overs were still yummy too, but at a cooler temperature so the fishiness wouldn't come through.  Will make again, thanks!

I didn't care for this.  Husband thought it was ok.  I just don't care for the Dijon Mustard, mixed with the Honey with the Salmon.  Didn't mingle well on my tongue.

I thought this was pretty good, but not 5 stars good.  I guess I was expecting the pecan crust to be more crunchy.  The honey dijon mustard sauce went very well with the salmon.  I was skeptical once I mixed it up and tasted it.

This recipe is so so good and amazingly easy! The only pecans I could find at the grocery store were ones that were meant for pecan pie (coated with sugar) which gave it a much sweeter (but great) taste.

I love making this recipe when I have guests over, it seems to be a real hit!


Over the last year I have found a quicker and still tasty way to pull to serve it. I coat the salmon with Dijon mustard only, then sprinkle with the nuts. After baking, I put on a bed of spinach or salad and that's it! It's a simpler variation but easy to do if someone if coming by for lunch on short notice.

Not a great recipe.  
Disliked the Dijon mustard flavour with salmon.
Bread crumbs were dry.  Probably better to mix melted butter to breadcrumbs.

Everyone loved this recipe, even my picky 11 yr old and 4 yr old nieces! I did substitute walnuts for pecans and I also left the rub on for 20 minutes in the fridge before baking. I also decided to used both lemons and limes for garnish, and I drizzled a very small amount of honey on top of the salmon after I took it out of the oven. Thanks Chris for this keeper!

This recipe is AWESOME and easy to make.  I made it for Christmas dinner.  Everyone loved it and were happy to take some home with them.  I followed the advice from another review and put the honey/mustard mix in the frig for 15 minutes.

Absolutely fantastic dish.  Tried this as a new recipe for Christmas Eve dinner.  It was a huge success, and I even made it with walnuts.  It's a keeper for sure.

I wouldn't change a thing to this recipe, it was fantastic!  I finely chopped the pecans in my food processor and used a spicy hot/sweet mustard.  Served it with herb oven roasted new potatoes and steamed broccoli!

This was delicious. I reduced the recipe to 4 servings. I had 2 big pieces of salmon and I ended up with a good amount of sauce so I poured a little bit on top of the bread crumb mixture. It turned out wonderfully. This topping would also be really good on chicken.

Yum!  We made this for Thanksgiving and it was great.  We bought fresh salmon from the fish store and the only change was marinating in the mustard honey sauce before cooking and adding chopped green onion to the breading mixture.  We also added seasoned croutons to the fresh breadcrumbs.  Highly recommend this recipe.

I have been meaning to make this recipe for awhile and it was worth the wait.  My mother said it was the best salmon she had ever had (and she is big salmon fan).  I will definitely make this again.

This is my favorite way to eat salmon.  I'm not a big fan of salmon because of its "fishiness" and I don't like honey mustard, but something about the combination is magical.  Delicious!

Fantastically easy and delicious to boot! 

I am an extreme novice when it comes to cooking and this recipe was so quick and easy... even for me. :) The Salmon came out sooooo good. Just the right amount of sweetness with a nice soft crunch. (I substituted Walnuts for Pecans)

Will definitely be making again!

I detest salmon but my guy was given some as a gift (he likes it).  I used this recipe because of the rating - I followed it exactly and those that ate it loved it.  It didn't pass my lips but wanted to let others know that this apparently is a great way to cook salmon.  Thanks submitter.

OH Holy Yummy!!!! I made this for my daughter's baptism and received rave reviews. The coating tasted great with the mustard flare. I generally do not like Salmon but with this recipe, I will make it again! I purchased the freshest salmon I could find, which I am sure is half the battle. Yummm, I will definitely make this again!

This tasted pretty good - but I don't think I will make it again. The breadcrumb/pecan mixture was dry on the salmon, so it was falling off the salmon. I added more butter on top of the salmon to "crisp" it up a little bit, but it didn't really work out. It was the texture of sand and salmon - not exactly what I was hoping for. bummer.

I eat this like a fiend, quite literally. I even made this for my friend, who supposedly hates seafood, and I think I converted her. I skipped out on the pecans when I had company that was allergic, but if you can eat them, don't skimp. This is by far the best fish I have ever made.

This was good.  I used tilapia instead of salmon as this is all I had.  Because tilapia is so mild,more honey and mustard may have been warranted.  I can't wait to try this with salmon next time!

I feel like a dork because I messed up on this recipe a little.  I read the directions wrong and mixed all of the topping ingredients together.  It was really thick and pasty and hard to put on the fish.  It didn't look appetizing either.  My fault though!  It still tasted really good though.  I cut the recipe in half for a small half-fillet.  Served with potatoes and broccoli.

Absolutely delicious.  I scaled this down to 4 servings and served it at dinner with friends.  It got rave reviews, and is definitely the best salmon dish I've ever made.  I will be making this again, for sure.

I have used this recipe several times recently and my husband who doesn't generally like fish has really liked it.  I cut corners a little by using prepared honey mustard instead of the mustard, butter and honey.

Great dish! I used honey dijon mustard, dipped the salmon in the honey dijon then coated both sides with the pecan coating.

Wow! This was a very easy recipe and very tasty. I didn't have dijon mustard, so I used a bitter honey mustard instead. Also, I used one large piece of salmon instead of 6 small servings; I didn't have enough pecans, so I used something called pecan meal- which is super fine pecan powder - it worked very well and stayed on the fish! Thanks so much!

Really good. Didn't have dijon mustard,so I used honey mustard eliminating the extra honey in the first step. This was a good alternative for the dijon and it worked pretty good. So glad I doubled the sauce so I could have a little extra. I would make this again.

This was REALLY good!  Every Saturday night one of my kids gets to pick the meal and desert.  It was my 8 year olds turn and she wanted salmon.  I picked this recipe and it was a hit!  She said it was the best Salmon she's ever had, and she usually orders that at every restaurant we go to.  What makes this recipe even more of a keeper is that my husband actually liked it.  He does not like salmon at all, and was not looking forward to dinner.  He said if salmon was always made like this, he would eat it more.  I see more salmon at our dinner table in our future thanks to this recipe!  Thank you for submitting it!

Very tasty.  If I make it again, I would use a mustard with more spice than dijon, to counter the sweetness of the honey.

I thought this was pretty tasty and a nice change from the way I usually bake salmon.  However, it took longer to prepare than I had expected, but that might have been my relative inexperience as a cook.  I might make it again with a little more time to prepare.

Yum! I accidentally used too much honey and we didn't have parsley, but this salmon was GREAT!  We used a 3 lb. filet, still whole, and first broiled the topping side, then flipped it over and cooked it (skin side up) at 400 until medium-rare.

This recipe has become a weekly meal for our family!  It is perfect!  I use whole-grain mustard instead of the recommended kind, and I think it gives it a little something extra.  I also melt a little butter and mustard together for dipping sauce.  Perfect!!

I'm giving this four stars because the recipe has some potential.  We made some of the changes suggested such as decreasing the bread crumbs, increasing the pecans, and adding the topping at the last minute.  I found the flavor overall to be bland.  I've had pecan coated trout and salmon in restaurants before and it was better.  I found the topping to be a bit dry.  Next time, I think we'll drizzle more butter over the pecans.  The topping which fell off the salmon and baked on the bottom of the pan with the butter and juices was better than on top of the fish.

Enjoyed this fine recipe yesterday evening.  My girlfriend prepared this meal with perfection.  The results indeed were unimaginable.  Definitely the best salmon meal I've had ever,  and recommend it toanyone seeking something different for dinner.   Yum X's a million.

This was so easy to make that I thought it must not taste as good as everyone says. Happy to report that I was wrong. Made it for Christmas dinner this year and the guests were impressed. Excellent! Thanks for the recipe.

This alaska salamon bake is very very good The ingredients are not that expensive except perhaps the fish. I was kind of upset for letting my kids try this cause I know they'd like it too.

YUM!! :) Easy recipe, quick bake time. It was deelicious! I used walnuts, however (already had them in the pantry), and dried parsley. I also forgot to add the lemon wedges at the end!! But it was still scrumptious, and since I'm kind of inconsistent with how my salmon turns out, I was REALLY pleased with how moist (but not raw!) it turned out this time. Thanks for the recipe!! :) Next time I'll remember the lemon. :P

This recipe was wonderful.  I made it for my family and it was a hit!  The only thing I changed was I drizzled the honey/dijon/butter sauce over it when finished--it looked to dry.

This was a very easy to make recipe...The flavor was good also..I used italian bread crumbs, that was all I had, and it added extra flavor..this was also a kid pleaser which is hard to do with fish..
Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made this dish twice now and it has turned out great both times.  Our family and friends love it and it is an easy recipe to follow.  The pecans on top of the honey dijon coating adds just the right flavor to salmon.  One of the best recipes I have!

Love salmon and this was absoloutely delicious.  Followed the directions to a "T" and would not change a thing except maybe cut the breading mixture down.  I did have a lot of mixture leftover.  Great recipe.  Thanks Christine!

This recipe was delicious.  However, I did make some modifications.  To coat the salmon, I melted butter, and added brown sugar together instead of using honey.  Then, I rolled the salmon in the "finely" chopped pecans.  I baked it at the temperature the recipe suggested.  My husband who does not especially enjoy salmon, LOVED IT!  This was a simple yet elegant dish.  I will certainly make this again!

I put the honey mustard on thick, put the topping on then drizzled the rest of the honey mustard over it. Only one kid scraped it off so I guess that's pretty good. It was a little labor intensive so it probably won't be used often but I might use it occasionally.

My husband and I took one bite and threw it out! We aren't big fans of Dijon mustard, so that could have been it, but the flavors just didn't work together. Sorry.

This is a really great recipe.  Easy to make and a big hit with the guests.  If you like your salmon on the sweet side, you'll love this.  Goes great with white rice and steamed vegetables.

You would not BELIEVE the rave reviews I got from this dish--it is so easy and SO delicious!!
Note-I used Panko crumbs and it made such a light, crisp coating. I also substituted dill for parsely because its what I had on hand. Ridiculously good. Wow.

I thought this was very good.  I usually have salmon grilled with a bit of dill and lemon, so to actually have pecans, honey, and dijon mustard on it was very different.  I did enjoy it though.  I think I found a new way to have salmon!

My family loved this recipe!  My hubby doesn't even like salmon but he liked this.  I think it's very important to get very fresh salmon.  If the salmon is not fresh, it will taste fishy.

This was a great recipe!   It tastes just like it was prepared in an upscale seafood restaurant.  The dijon mustard was a little spicy for the kids but the adults loved it!

This is the best Salmon recipe I've ever tried. It's so easy. My husband loves it too. He's a BIG meat lover (I don't eat meat, only fish) but now this is his favourite meal. It's great to have found a recipe that we both love.

I made this for company and they absolutely loved it!!  I don't particularly like Salmon but it didn't really taste "fishy" at all.  This one is definitely a keeper.  I served it with "dirty rice" and steamed asparagus.  Thanks so much for this great "Lenten" recipe.

This was great - the pecan mixture takes away the 'fishy' taste of salmon for me.  Definitely will make again.

This was awful.  The salmon was good, of course.  but the coating was dry and tasteless.  I followed the recipe exactly so I want to know what those other people were making!

This was my first attempt at home cooked fish so I am comparing it to restaurant prepared.  The fish was great however i thought the crust was lacking in flavor, kind of dry.  I did however  make more Mustard-butter-honey sauce and dipped my fish on that and it was awsome.

OH...MY...GOD!
I had two filets of 1lb each for two guys.  My intention was to eat half and bring the other half to work with me.  Hah!  I wound up eating the entire filet.  This coating is the best.  I like Salmon but this made it even better.  Make some extra of the pecan, bread crumb, parsley mix and save it in your Tupperware for later.

This salmon melts in your mouth.  This is definately an impressive dish to serve, and so easy to prepare.  This is the kind of dish you would pay over $25 to eat in a nice restaurant.  Try it.

this recipe is very quick and easy to prepare, however the best salmon will aways be 'grilled'if you make it at home.  this one is best ordered off a menu.
