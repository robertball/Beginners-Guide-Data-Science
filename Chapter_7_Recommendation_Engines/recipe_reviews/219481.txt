Having had turkey every month for the last three months we decided to try something different. Very interesting way of cooking a turkey but not something we are used to. Even though we liked this we prefer the traditional way of cooking a turkey.

Fantastic!  My family raved over this bird for days afterward.  I will definitely use this recipe again.
