BEST HAM I'VE EVER HAD!!!! The Scotch glaze is YUMMY! Instead of a spiral ham, my husband scored a 7-lb smoked ham and cooked for 1.5 hours, instead of 2. He adjusted the recipe to 14 servings. I'd make ham this way EVERY time, it was THAT good!

The BEST ham ever, my kids gave me a standing ovation.... Since I "accidently" drank all the whiskey the night before, I substituted apple cider, DELISH!!!

Wow! Easy & delicious.... My cooked spiral ham only called for 1 hour of baking, so I followed its cooking instructions. This cinnamon and scotch added a great flavor...minus the cloying sweetness of some ham glazes. And the next day leftovers...yum! This recipe goes into the binder of our favorite holiday feasts.

This was okay.  Not my favorite way of making ham, though.  Couldn't use the drippings for gravy as the whiskey did not blend well into a gravy taste.

The consensus was that this was the best ham ever. I used bourbon, and only 1 cup of it, and omitted the mustard (only because I didn't have any). After carving it, we put it all in a crock pot and poured all the juices over it and people ate on it all evening. I will definitely make this again.

Huge success. Cooked this for Christmas dinner. My sister-in-law, who is a professional cook, asked for the recipe! Huge hit with everyone. Even I liked it, and I am not a huge fan of ham. I cooked exactly to recipe, and it worked great. I think the leftovers even got better with time, as they continued to soak in the scotch-brown sugar glaze.

I won't make ham another way.  It was a little out of the ordinary - infused with the spiciness from the scotch - perfect for Christmas.  Don't need to be a scotch drinker to appreciate it.  Delicious.  Although my husband was a little bummed I used so much of his scotch!

I made it exactly as specified and it came out good.  Unfortunately my ham was a bit too salty, which was not the fault of the recipe.  I prefer a recipe for ham .with orange juice in glaze.

BEST. HAM. EVER.
I made this for a friend's Christmas party. OMG! Everyone loved it! A few people told me it was the best ham they ever had. I bought a 12lb. Hy-Vee smoked, spiral-cut ham. I used Scoresby blended Scotch ($10 a bottle--don't waste the good stuff!) I cooked it for 3 hours following the label on the ham. Great glaze, not too sweet and the cinnamon is very subtle (I'm not a big fan). Tender with great flavor! Great recipe. I am now required to make this ham every year!
