Disclaimer:  I'm rating the stir fry w/out the rice as I realized I only had "Ready Rice" as I was preparing this.  (And my actual rating would be a "3", but I'm rounding up just in case the rice is awesome)  This is surprisingly bland.  The entire time I was making this, I really wanted to add a shot of sesame, some garlic, and some soy to the veggies.  I wish I would have.  The chicken had good flavor, but there was no "sauce" to speak of to add any flavor to the veggies.  This was ok, but it won't be a repeat at the LTH house.  Thanks for the recipe, ally-gator!

This was pretty good but I didn't care for the spicy rice, next time I would just do plain brown rice.

I thought this was pretty good. I've actually made it twice, since I had all the ingredients on hand, and I made it exactly as written.
I was a little confused about where the chili rice got mixed with everything, as it's not mentioned towards the end of the recipe steps, then I noticed in the recipe introduction that the chicken/vegetable mixture is meant to be served over the chili rice. Actually, I thought the chili rice itself was quite nice, as I'd never made anything like it (I used large dried "California Chili Pods" for it). The overall dish is quite tasty, and lasted me for 3-4 days each time.

I just made this, my wife and I loved it! It wasn't bland and had a burst of flavor.

I adjusted the recipe a little bit, added about 6 cloves of garlic, 2 before the chicken (as called) and another 4 to the vegetables. Instead of using butter to saute the veggies, I used sesame oil in the wok where I cooked the chicken (putting the chicken aside) and added the tablespoon of soy sauce to the veggies while cooking.

I also added about a teaspoon of cayenne to the mixture that cooks with the chicken.

Overall, it turned out really yummy!

VERY good!  I added julienne carrots, and it added a nice flavor.  Made WAY too much rice for us.  I would cut down on that next time.

Loved this dish! The rice was a nice touch,  good spice. I had everything on hand except turmeric, which is unfortunate but still tasted delicious! Will make again as my husband loved this dish!
