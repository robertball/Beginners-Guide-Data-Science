This recipe makes a good meat pie... but it is not a traditional Tourtière recipe.  A true Tourtière requires no herb, no garlic, no chicken broth (water is used instead), but rather the following spices: cinnamon, cloves, all spice, salt and pepper.  So, as a French Canadian, I would not mind serving this meat pie say on a cold January night, but certainly not on Christmas Eve (Réveillon), as it would break the tradition.

I liked this recipe and the spice blend.  I use a variety of meat pie(Tourtiere) recipes and have been making them for a long time. Sorry Tyggrette, there are as many "traditional" recipes for tourtiere as there are ways to prepare meatloaf!  Each Region of Canada prepares it differently.  Besides, spices don't make a tradition, people do.  This is a nice recipe and a recommended try.  Thanks, Claudette

Good recipe.  I agree with the use of pork only and the spicing in this version.  Every French Canadian, myself included knows the BEST recipe for tourtiere and it's their's!  Part of my family Christmas is a friendly discussion around the dining table as to whose tourtiere is the most 'authentic'.  For me, tourtiere and home-made chili sauce IS Christmas.  I've never met a tourtiere I wouldn't sample!

This recipe provides excellent flavor in the filling.  As I am not familiar with a tourtiere, I cannot judge about it's authenticity.  I would like a binder of some kind, as the meat wanted to spill out of the crust when serving.  Thanks for posting!
