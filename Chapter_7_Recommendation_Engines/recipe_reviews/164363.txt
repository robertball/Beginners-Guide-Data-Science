Very easy to make and simply delicious.  Once i rolled up the crescent dough into the long rolls, I cut each roll in half and then cut the halves in half to make each slice even. Make sure the cheese mixture goes all the way to the ends so that the end slices have cheese in them.

These are really good.  Make sure the onion is very finely chopped and that the dough is covered adequately so that the flavors are spread throughout each bite.

great recipe. But I didn't want to bother with rolling and slicing the rolls, so I just used the mini puff pastry shells, baked them off, filled them with the cheese and nut mixture, threw 'em back in the oven for 5 mins to warm through, and then topped them with the onion jam. I got so many compliments- and so many requests for the recipe.

Very good recipe.  I am not sure how to get 32 servings. I had 16 servings and it seems perfect.  When I make these again for my MIL I will try to cut them smaller.  Would be interesting to try with homemade dough.  Enjoy!

I used orange marmalade instead of the apricot preserves.  Next time I will really cut down on this ingredient because it was too sweet. Very good though, and everyone enjoyed them. Tip - wet the knife before you make each cut so you don't squish the dough.
