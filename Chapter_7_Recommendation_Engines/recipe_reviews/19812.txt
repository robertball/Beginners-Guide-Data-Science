I have made this recipe numerous times with numerous alterations and have finally find the one that works for me.  I decrease the extract (personal preference).  I heat the half-n-half/cream and sugar on the stove until the sugar is dissolved the night before I want to make the ice cream.  I chill the mixture all night.  I put the ice cream in my ice cream maker for about 25 min.  Put it in the freezer for about 2 hours.  Take it out and let it soften a little and serve.  It was wonderful!!  I make it way to often and my chocaholic son never seems to mind that it is vanilla!

I chose to make this recipe my first try at vanilla ice cream due to no cooking required and no raw eggs in it.  I used homemade vanilla (from this website), so the ice cream had little specks of vanilla bean in it, and was nice and creamy.  The instructions say to mix the ingredients together IN the freezer container of the ice cream maker; don't do that if you have the kind of ice cream maker with the already-frozen canister!  Mix them in a bowl and then add to the ice cream maker!  Oh, I also scaled it down to 8 servings for my 1.5qt ice cream maker; it didn't make a lot; I think 16 servings would be about right for a full recipe. Thanks for the recipe, Jackie!

Delicious recipe for homemade ice cream...I just modified it a little bit by using 1% milk instead of heavy cream, almost 2 cups sugar, and 4 big spoonfuls of vanilla.  My entire family said it was the best ice cream they have ever had!  Also, I warmed up the milk and dissolved the sugar in it so it wouldn't be gritty.

My family loves this recipe. It's very easy. Tip for keeping it soft even after it's been in the freezer for a while: don't add the cream to the mix before it goes into the ice cream mixer. While the freezer is working, use an electric mixer to whip the cream into stiff peaks. After the freezer stops, let the iced mix harden for about ten minutes. Fold the whipped cream into the iced mix until combined. Allow to harden for at least two hours in the freezer or it will be too soft to serve.

Good ice cream as is. I like to reduce the fat by using fat free half and half, and 2% milk instead of heavy cream.

I chose this recipe out of curiosity because I finally wanted to try and step outside my comfort zone of the  2:1 ratio of heavy cream to half and half or whole milk that I am very rigid about.  I still am.  This was not nearly as rich or creamy, or have that wonderful mouth feel that I'm accustomed to and prefer.  It was worth a try, but it's reaffirmed my preference and will not make a convert of me.  (I scaled this to 10 servings to fit my 1-1/2 quart ice cream maker)

Very good!  I made this recipe three times in two days (with variations) for a large family gathering.  The first time it had a grainy texture, so I dissolve the sugar in a 1/4 cup of water and the grainy texture was gone.  On my last batch I substituted 1/2 c of vanilla creamer for the half and half . . . IT WAS FANTASTIC!!!

This is a wonderfuly easy and delicious recipe!  It is light and creamy without being too rich, I  paired it with peach cobbler with heavenly results.  

I scaled it down to 8 servings to fit my machine and rounded the vanilla extract up a tad and added a scant 1/4 tsp. rum extract and 1/4 tsp. almond extract -- just a touch of these really deepened the vanilla flavor without overpowering it. Just perfect,  YUM!

This is a fantastic recipe. If you're a strawberry fan, take note: adding one carton of frozen strawberries with sugar (found in the frozen aisle) about 30 minutes before the ice cream is finished makes the most amazing strawberry ice cream. I didn't have any fresh berries on hand, otherwise I'm sure they would make it even more scrum-diddly-umpcious. But seriously folks, get some berries into this amazingness. Your taste buds will thank you.

Since 4th of July is right around the corner, I decided to make some vanilla ice cream. I have never been let down before with Allrecipes.com, so I thought I would search their site for this. The ice cream turned out fabulous! I did not follow the directions to a T. I did read the rest of the directions and made it my own. I had to double the recipe (since we have a lot of people coming over tomorrow.) I used 2 quarts of HnH, 1 1/2 quarts of Heavy cream, half a cup of milk, 2 cups of sugar, 3 REAL vanilla bean pods, 2 small pinches of kosher salt and two cap fulls of REAL vanilla extract. I melted the sugar in the pot with the creams and bean pods till slightly warm. I took 4 large egg yolks and gradually mixed them into the mixture. I turned the heat off and then I let it steep for about 10 minutes (to get the flavor of the vanilla to come out.) I then put the mixture in the ice cream machines and it came out PERFECT!!! It's creamy SUPER vanillay and rich. It's just what I wanted!!

This was so easy and so good!  I used best quality vanilla, since there are so few ingredients, it makes a big difference.  There are maybe better tasting ice cream recipes, but they usually require eggs/custard step.  I don't have time to make those very often, and this is better and far more satisfying than most store versions!  I have made this a dozen times this summer, and will be making it a million times more!

I follow the directions exactly and it is fabulous. It is light, creamy and sweet. It is totally easy, as well. I have never had ice crystals in mine and I have made it 15+ times. I have thought about experimenting with the recipe, but I like it so well, I never do.

So easy, and Oh So Good !!!
Reminds me of Breyers Vanilla, which has always been my favorite !!

After making this several times, I've made some adjustments.  

I use "3" ingredients:
Fat-Free Half & Half, homemade Vanilla, and sugar.   

I replaced the Half & Half and the Heavy Cream with Fat Free Half & Half, add vanilla, sugar, and mix in freezer container for about 25 minutes. 

Absolutely delicious !!!  

Experimented by adding chopped walnuts, and that was Awesome !!!

I tried two batches of this recipe and could not get it to freeze.  One of the reviews said to add some flavored coffee creamer, which I did.  I added about 1/4 cup to the first batch and about 1/2 cup to the second.  Could this have beeen what kept the ice cream from freezing?  It ran in the ice cream freezer for over 2 hours.   I took it out of the ice cream freezer and put it in a bowl in he freezer overnight.  One batch is softly frozen, the other is frozen only around the ecges and still liquid in the center.  as far as I can tell the coffee creamer is the only variation to the original recipe....  has anyone else had similar experiences, or know what could have happened?

Only 4 stars because I modified it as follows:
1 cup sugar
7 cups milk, 2 cups heavy cream
5 pureed bananas
3 tbs vanilla paste
It was absolutely awesome. I threw in some finely chopped banana into 1/2 of it at the soft serve stage, and froze. Excellent!

I made this recipe at a family barbeque. None of my husbands family had ever had homemade icecream without eggs before.  They all loved it and even 3 weeks later are still raving about how delicious it was and wanting to know when I can come back and make it again.  Excellent!

This recipe is GREAT!  My girl scout troop used it at the last jamboree and got raved reviews.  The ingredients are simple and easy to measure.  We've also added strawberries to make strawberry ice crenm and left over chocolate pieces to make a chocolate chip variety.

We had company over this evening and I picked this recipe for dessert. I made it almost exactly according to the recipe (I didn't have half-and-half so I made my own with whole milk and cream). I dissolved the sugar in a bit of hot water. I also added 1/4 tsp each of almond and rum extract as a previous reviewer suggested, to bring out the vanilla flavor. I forgot the salt.  

The results were absolutely fantastic! Possibly the best ice cream I've ever made. We all got seconds. And were horrified at the end of the evening to discover we'd accidentally eaten the ENTIRE batch of ice  cream. Yes, 32 servings between the 6 of us. It was pretty awful--but it sure was tasty!

Do I recommend this recipe? Only if you want the most incredibly delicious and completely irresistible vanilla ice cream you've ever tasted. On a diet? You should probably cheat on something else.

This was delicious and very easy to make. I served it with fresh berries, but it's definitely good enough to serve alone. I will make it again.

I like a light clean flavor over a rich creamy ice cream, and this fits the bill. It is like comparing Ben and Jerry's to Breyer's. Both good but I like the lighter texture of the Breyer's. I added some crystal ginger that I minced and rehydrated in a little hot water.and some diced peach

This recipe is great -- maybe a tad too sweet, but that's probably just my personal taste. I'll probably reduce sugar to 1 cup next time. I used all half-and-half rather than part heavy cream. Also, it's completely possible to make this without an ice cream maker! Put the mixture into tupperware and freeze. Every 30-minutes to an hour, pour it into a blender and blend until smooth. Depending on the size of your blender you may need to process in two or three batches, because this recipe is huge. After a few hours it will blend to the consistency of a very thick milkshake -- at that point, just let it freeze untouched for a few more hours, and you'll have ice cream! The more often you blended it, the creamier it will be. It's more time-consuming than using an ice cream machine, but it also makes the final product all the more rewarding! And it's so cheap to make compared to store-bought. I can't wait to make again with different add-ins -- bits of candy bars, caramel syrup, peppermint extract and chocolate chips!

I loved this simple recipe. It took no time at all to put the ingredients together and get it churning. It took exactly 45 minutes to churn. It doesn't taste sweet enough for me but I did forget to add the salt. That may be a factor but next time I'll a bit more sugar.

Lacks character, but it's a solid vanilla (easier and faster to make with no eggs, too).

Excellent texture, very easy and versatile with much potential as a base recipe for many other flavors - have used this to make honey vanilla cinnamon, mint chocolate, and today will be trying raspberry chocolate chip.  Thanks for posting!

This recipe is WAY too much for a typical home ice cream maker.  My Cuisinart came with a similar recipe for a smaller batch, and I've adjusted it as follows:  1 cup whole milk, 2/3 cup sugar, pinch salt, 2 cups heavy cream, 2-3 tsp vanilla.  This recipe leaves out the step of whisking the sugar and salt into the milk until it dissolves, and I've found that an essential step.  Then mix in the cream and vanilla.  This is the creamiest, yummiest vanilla ice cream I've ever tasted.

This was great for a no-egg ice cream recipe. It reminded me of ice milk that my dad use to buy years ago. I added chocolate chips by request from my kids. I would make this again if I wants ice cream and I was out of eggs but I prefer the creamy custard texture that eggs give ice cream.

I changed the serving to 12. Instead of heavy cream, I used whipping cream. I have an old stove, and put the temperature on 3. I didn't let the creams boil or even simmer, just let the sugar dissolve. I tasted the ice cream as a liquid, and also had my husband try it. We agreed it was pretty darn good. I found it to be too sweet since I was going to make Kahlua (homemade, and non alcoholic.) flavor. I added in another cup of half and half, and another quarter cup of the whipping cream. I added about a an 1/8 of a cup of the Kahlua mix. The ice cream did come out with an icy texture, but it was still good, and my husband actually prefers it that way. We both agreed to keep this base, and make chocolate next time.

This recipe is easy and flexible. I made two batches one vanilla and one chocolate. With both recipes I slightly heated one cup of half and half to help dissolve the sugar and salt I also added the coco at this time for choclate for the same reason. I also added more vanila I used pure vanila extract and doubled the amount as well as added a tablespoon more of sugar. In both instances I tasted my mix before freezing. I am already planning more flavors like espresso , strawberry , mocha . I will keep updating my flavors though.
I hope this helps .

just one note to those who mentioned this froze "hard..." this is a hallmark of homemade ice creams.  you will find that if you use a whipped-cream or custard recipe with lots of air or fat in it, it is less so... but that is a natural effect of less additives/processing.  just set it out or microwave a couple of seconds to soften before serving.  never store homemade ice cream for more than 2-3 days; it loses its great flavor and texture!

I halved this recipe (and it's still plenty of ice cream for two or three people).  The store didn't have heavy whipping cream, so I just used half & half and liquid vanilla coffee creamer (the full cream version, NOT the low fat or the sugar free).  I also do not have an ice cream machine, so to make this without a machine, all I did was pour the mix into metal ice trays and cupcake trays.  Leave this in the freezer for 45 mins, then take it out, blend it smooth and put it back in the freezer ... every 30 mins, take it out and blend again to keep ice crystals from forming.  It turns out beautifully smooth and as good as from any machine.  GREAT recipe!!!

This was so simple to make and delicious. It is also very forgiving! I was short 4 cups of half and half. I subbed two extra cups of heavy cream and 2 cups of 2% milk because that is what I had. I also ran short on vanilla and only had 2 1/2 tsps.  I accidently forgot the salt!  Despite all these problems on my part, I decided to keep going. My son asked me to throw in a pinch of cinnamon. It turned out so good. It made a big batch.

This was great, the flavor was perfect. A lot of reviewers didnt seem to care for the flavor but I wonder how many used imitation vanilla instead of pure. There is a very distinct difference in the flavors, any recipes where you are not heating the vanilla above 300 degrees you should use pure vanilla. I threw in some mini chocolate chips after it was through. Very quick easy and versatile.

Great recipe. Simple and easy. To solve the problem of gritty sugar in the ice cream, use powdered sugar instead. No need to dissolve, no need to heat.

This is my first try at homemade ice cream with my Kitchenaid ice cream attachment. I thought this recipe was very icy and reminded me of ice milk or something even less rich than that.  My husband thought it was good. I also thought it was flaky like snow.  For all the half and half and heavy cream I was eating it sure didn't taste like half and half or heavy cream. I'm going to try some recipes with cooked eggs in them, it just sounds like that might be what I'm looking for. I also thought the taste was very bland.  I froze the bowl for
24 hours.

This is the best homemade ice cream I've ever tasted!  It is super easy to make as well!  I did dissolve the sugar in water first, as suggested in another review.  Also, I added vanilla pudding.  I've made it twice already, and will soon be making it again.  It's great with all kinds of toppings.

Do not expect creamy... Its not really. But its graininess is not entirely unappealing either. The graniness could probably be resolved by using a sugar syrup rather than raw suger just thrown in. I don't like the homemade ice creams that coat the mouth and this one was very 'clean'. I halved the recipe, but used 3 tsp Vanilla because I wanted a very intense taste. Its a good last minute recipe

I love a rich, creamy vanilla ice cream, don't you? You can do so much with it. This is a really nice recipe. Followed it to the letter. Made a homemade blackberry sauce using fresh berries, sugar, blackberry schnapps and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Garnished with fresh blackberries. A simple and elegant summer dessert.

I have made this recipe many times now. The quantity of ingredients above is the perfect amount for my 3 quart ice cream turner. I use bakers sugar which is a finer granular than normal sugar. I have found it nice to make the full batch of vanilla. I then divide it into two separate mixing bowls and add what ever ingredients we want to mix in (Oreo Cookies, Chocolate Chips etc...) to make two separate batches. I stir those in by hand and then put both bowls in the freezer to finish the ice cream off.

This is such a simple recipe that we tend to make ice cream much more than when we used to make the custard style cook recipes.

This is a delicious real cream ice cream.  I have tried several and this will be the keeper.  I did take the suggestions of other readers by dissolving the sugar in 1/4 cup water.  I also will try the gelatin to help it set up better.  The hardening process is a bit tough for me to get right.  I like to do it in the machine, packed in salt and ice.  It is a great recipe!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Made exactly as stated.  While very tasty, I prefer mine to be made with a larger proportion of heavy cream to light cream.

Followed the 2:1 ration of heavy cream to half and half.  Used 4 1/2 c cream & 2 1/4 c half and half for our 3 quart icecream maker.  Finished product tasted too much like heavy cream to me.  Great overall flavor.

Loved this ice cream!  Tweaked it by adding some almond extract, strawberries and chopped pecans.  Also as I like rich ice cream used 2 cps half-and-half and 2 1/2 cps heavy cream to make a 16 portion amount.  Went over great with company, will do it again.!

Great taste, easy to make, but a little grainy.  I have never tried a no cook ice cream before.  This was easy and I'll make it again, but it doesn't seem as smooth as my cooked recipes.  If anyone has suggestions- I'll try them.

Tasted icy.  Not nearly as smooth as custard based ice creams.

Excellent NO EGG ice cream!  For years, I've eaten homemade vanilla ice cream that a co-worker made and loved it.  I finally purchased my own ice cream maker and I asked for her recipe and I was shocked that there were raw eggs in the recipe.  Although, I did make the recipe I could not get over the fact that I was eating raw eggs and therefore no longer enjoyed her recipe.  I guess it was a "mind" thing.  I have searched for recipes that did not include eggs and came across this one and decided to make it exactly like the recipe called for. While I did need to let it set up a bit in the freezer after it was done, I thought it was delicious.  It kind of reminded me of a ice-milk milkshake, which is my favorite type of frosty creation.  I've never been big on ice cream but this is definitely a treat I will be making over and over! Very easy and very good!

I made this as written and then did a second time with some adaptations with great results. First, I scaled in half for my 2 quart counter top ice cream maker. To get a better texture, I reduced the half and half to 3 cups and increased the heavy cream to 1-1/2 cups. To make sure you don't end up with a grainy texture, use a hand mixer to combine the half and half with the sugar for just a couple of minutes and then stir in the remaining ingredients. This is a soft serve ice cream, even straight from the freezer. We loved it!

I accidentally used 4 Tablespoons of vanilla & a whole pint of heavy cream & I can't imagine how this would of tasted/felt if I hadn't...Actually, I CAN imagine that it would be a bit bland & lacking in both flavor & mouth-feel. I should've known when I saw the proportions but I just couldn't seem to find my regular no-cook/no-egg recipe...

This results in an icy-textured icemilk.  Very disappointing.  Won't try again.

Made as stated, but scaled to 10 servings to fit in our ice cream maker. Did not turn out smooth and creamy. Nice light flavor, but more like eating flavored ice.

This recipe is sooooo easy.  We don't have any ice cream maker, but I just beat it with a handmixer and put it in the freezer.  I made it as written, but I made part of it with 1/4 cup unsweetened cocao powder because we wanted chocolate too.  The second time we added crushed Chips Ahoy cookies and stirred them in when it was half frozen.  All 3 tasted great!  Like store bought.  Thanks for sharing.

The only thing good about this recipe is that it was easy.  After an hour and a half in the ice cream maker it still wasn't frozen.  My husband who will usually eat anything and not complain, wouldn't even eat it.

I had to half the original recipe to fit into my 1-1/2 qt machine.  I have to say, I read the negative reviews and unfortunately they are right...this has an icy texture.  I will continue to search for a vanilla ice cream recipe.

This has to be the most delicious home made vanilla ice cream ever.  Oh my goodness it is sinful, you could just eat and eat and eat it.  Also love the fact it  has no eggs. (halved all ingredients to fit my ice cream maker).  I know I will be making this forever! Thank you for sharing.

This was my first time ever making ice cream and this is the best I've ever had.  The only change I made was adding the Coffemate French Vanilla that another reviewer suggested.  I also heated the mixture to disslove the sugar.  I will be making this again!  Thanks for sharing!

I must admit when I saw this "simple" recipe I was skeptical, I'm mean it's no cook, a few ingredients, eh, I'll try it. This is one of the best batches of ice creams I've ever made! The fact there are no eggs is even better! I scaled the recipe back to 1 qt using the calculator on the site (or what was supposed to be 1 qt, it was more like 1 1/3 pt). After reading some of the reviews & some stated the ice cream was a little grainy from the sugar, I decided to heat the cream, 1/2&1/2 & sugar to a simmer (whisking periodically). After heating, add the salt & vanilla to the mixture, whisk a little more, let it cool & refrigerate overnight, 2-4 hrs is sufficient.  The flavor was fabulous. I'm starting on my next batch now because a pt is not nearly enough for my family (plus I’m no longer “testing” the recipe, it’s ok to make a BIG batch :-)). I know this is supposed to be a QUICK recipe, but I think the 2 ½ hrs (min) cook & cool time is well worth it – especially if it means you’ll have SMOOTH & tasty ice cream.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe JKINFLA!!
UPDATE: I forgot to mention that I sub'd 1/4 of the 1/2&1/2 for eggnog (NOT a 1/4 CUP, 1/4 of the amt of called for in the recipe). That being said, I made 2 more batches 1 Chocolate cookies n cream-to die for!!and 1 vanilla no eggnog.  The plain needs more vanilla. I recommend using vanilla bean and/or double, even trip vanilla. I still think this is a good recipe though.

I tried to make the ice cream smoother by adding one package of instant vanilla pudding. (I used sugar free pudding)   Instead of the 1 1/2 c. of regular sugar I added 3/4 c. of the Splenda sugar blend  and added one vanilla bean.  It turned out really good.  Not a bit icy.

This ice cream is terrific and it's the only kind I make for my family. (I am not a big fan of homemade ice cream with eggs in it.) This recipe is quick, easy, and you don't have to worry about dealing with raw eggs.  The taste is rich and creamy, and this recipe is a great base to work with for creating other flavors.

I heated the half and half, cream, and sugar until the sugar was dissolved and put it in the fridge over night. My maker is the hamilton beach one where you freeze the canister. (1.5 qt.) I scaled this to 8 servings. And BAM! it was done in 20 minutes! This tasted fabulous also..Thank you for posting!

I think making it lower fat gives it a more traditional homemade ice cream taste.  I like to use milk (whatever % I have on hand) instead of heavy cream.  Love this recipes, altered and in it's original state!  So yummy and simple.    I do also dissolve sugar in heated milk (or heavy cream) and then add to the rest of the ingredients, and chill before adding to my ice cream maker.  Yummm.  I have some chilling right now.  This is my second summer making this recipe!

Awesome!  My grandma, the home-made ice cream queen who says "it aint ice cream unless its got eggs in it" loved LOVED this recipe.  Thats a great compliment from someone who's so picky.  It was easy to make and as suggested, you should dissolve the sugar in the half and half first.  It does make the difference.

Yum yum yum. I'm so happy I found this easy recipe. I made it b/c I had all the ingredients in my kitchen. It was so quick and easy I'm already enjoying my ice cream! I can't wait to play with this recipe. Thanks! (PS - converted to 8 servings for my 1.5 qt ice cream maker.)

This tastes exactly like frozen whipped cream, with good reason because that is exactly what it is. It's very good for eggless ice cream and simple to make.

Yummmmmm!!!!  Excellent recipe - perfect homemade ice cream.  For me, the grainy texture is what sets homemade ice cream apart from storebought, and I love it!

I just attempted this recipe for a second time.  The first time it was a bust the mixture would not come together at all.  You really need to follow the instructions on your ice cream machine on both freezing bowl if need as well as chilling the mixture.  Since my bowl only does 16 services cut the recipe in half.   Using a KA Ice Cream Maker I put the bowl into my chest freezer then put the mixture from this recipe in the fridge.  After 17 hours attempted to make the ice cream and it came together.  I did give a taste and yes this recipe is good but reminds me more of Ice Milk Ice Cream.  It is in the freezer now looking forward to trying after it fully freezes.

Delicious!  I have added crushed strawberries to it; one reviewer suggested coffee I will have to do that one of these next times.  Very good, simple, vanilla ice cream recipe.

This is a yummy no cook ice cream recipe!  We prefer recipes with a cooked custard mixture for the creaminess and flavor it provides.  This recipe will be a back up for when I don't have time those steps.

This recipe is good but my thought is that if you are going to make homemade ice cream, it's worth the calories to make it as creamy as possible. I prefer a custard base and this isn't health food as written. So the difference in fat and calories using a a heavier custard recipe is worth it to get the texture and flavor that a custard base affords. Still, I have a very good friend who doesn't like a custard base vanilla ice cream so she would love this recipe.

I made this twice.  The first time I was not happy with the result.  It was too icy and not rich, but I liked the concept so iI did it again reversing the  ratio of cream and half and half.  That produced a much better result.  I used vanilla paste to amp up the flavor and served it with Chef John's Easy Homemade Chocolate Sauce.

This was very good, very easy, but not as creamy as the recipe I usually use.  Changing the ratio of cream to half & half would make it creamier. My ice cream maker doesn't make a gallon of ice cream so I reduced the recipe for 1 1/2 qts.  I dissolved the sugar in some warmed half & half because I was afraid it might be a bit grainy, and I also added a cup of chopped strawberries-yum!  I like that this recipe doesn't use eggs or canned sweetened condensed milk.

This was the absolute easiest ice cream recipe. The vanilla turned out so good I made a second trip to the store to get more stuff to make chocolate.  I just added 2 tsp of vanilla instead of 4 and added unsweetened oocoa powder.  I had forgotten just how good homemade ice cream could be!

This is really good, I wanted a recipe that didn't use eggs, this filled the bill. I have made it 3 times in the last week and it was great each time. I did makes sure the sugar was all dissolved before I started to freeze it to avoid any grainy texture. I used half 35%(whipping) cream and half 1% milk as that is what we always have on hand it worked well! We like it, and our company did also. I am going to add fruit the next time!

Based on feedback I changed this to use a 2:1 ratio of heavy cream to half-n-half because some other recipes turned out a bit icy and I was looking for creamier.  I also halved the recipe because my ice cream maker isn't that big and added two egg yolks to help emulsify.  I mixed the ingredients together in the mixer for a minute or so prior to putting in the ice cream maker because my maker does not mix.  As it was mixing, the cream started to whip up slightly so it had a bit of air in it.  After about 10 minutes of mixing in the machine I added 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips and some chopped walnuts (optional).  As it came out of the ice cream maker I thought it was a failure because it was very light and tasted somewhat like whipped cream.  But after being in the freezer for 3 hours it thickened considerably and was dense, creamy and amazing.

Absolutely fabulous! I had actually made a different custard recipe that was way too rich for my family's taste and had ingredients left over so I found this one. To fit in my 2qt cuisinart I put 2 cups of half and half, 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla and just filled the remainder of the bowl with whole milk. Of course the ease and deliciousness of this recipe is not going to be good for the waistline! maker beware!

Very disappointed in this recipe.  I prefer no-egg ice creams, but this was more in the line of iced milk, even using the stated amounts of cream and half & half.  Extremely bland and icy with virtually no vanilla taste at all.  I even dissolved the sugar in with the liquid base at the beginning, and still no creaminess at all!

Very good. I used all fat free half & half, even in place of the heavy cream but I'm going to try it with cream next time for a smoother texture. I also subbed agava for sugar. This one's a keeper =)

Absolutely delicious! I reduced the recipe to 8 servings (one quart) and will definitely be making more. I modified it somewhat, using 1 cup heavy cream and 1 1/4 cups nonfat half and half (picked up the wrong carton at the store.) I also dissolved the sugar in 1/4 cup of half and half and let cool before putting the concoction in the ice cream maker. The modifications resulted in a delicious, creamy yet still light ice cream. My boyfriend called it the best ice cream ever.

So easy and so delicious! You can use any combination you want ie. Whipping cream, half and half etc. I have made this three times once as is, once with peppermint extract and chocolate chips and once with agave nectar instead of sugar. All three were to die for good!!

So easy, and so good.  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't wait for the ice cream to "harden" in the freezer.  We crushed up oreos to mix in and it was like soft serve, very smooth.  We'll definitely make this one again!

I made it a few days ago and added chocolate sandwich cookies to make cookies n cream flavor.  Finished texture was a little flaky rather than smooth, but great flavor.  I'm making it again and will whip it at intervals while I'm hardening it to try to get a smoother texture.  If I succeed, I'll give it 5 stars.

This reminds me of what, as a kid, we called "ice milk" as opposed to ice cream, but the longer it froze, the closer it seemed to ice cream. Loved it!

Very delisious.  Fit our gallon ice cream maker perfectly.  We were testing it out for our annual 4th of July party and everyone agreed that this is what we should make instead of the ice cream packets.  We found the mixture to be very smooth and so creamy.  Followed directions exactly as is.  Update:  Husband wanted Chocolate Ice cream, so I used 1/2 cup of Coca powder to make it and I can't explain how good it was.  It tasted like a frosty it was so good!!

Disappointing. Lots of ice crystals made for a very unsatisfactory texture. Flavor good. Have made lots of other "no cook" ice cream recipes, and never encountered so much ice. Look elsewhere for a recipe before using this one.

I've tried many recipes and this is our favorite.  I don't like the ice milks and I don't like when there's so much whipping cream that it sticks to the top of your mouth.  This one's great!  Not too milky.....not to "whip creamy"... just perfect!

So simple, yet so delicious! Everyone raves about this when I make it and it keeps well for many days. Also made a batch with smashed cookies and it was awesome!

I did not like this, unfortunately it makes a lot so I am going to have to figure out if there is a way to use it.  Weird texture- overly fatty and grainy at the same time.  Bummer.

This ice cream was really good.  It was easy to throw together on a moment's notice and we all liked it alot.  I think I may try using vanilla bean next time in addition to the vanilla extract to bump up the flavor a bit.  When I received my ice cream maker I wasn't aware that so many recipes needed eggs and cooking etc.  I'm glad to find a recipe that doesn't need all that complicated stuff to taste good!

Great recipe!  I used this to make ice cream the first time in our new ice cream maker.  I really thought it had a nice flavor.  I did follow suggestions to add 1/2 cup of French Vanilla Coffee Mate to the mix.  I really think that enhanced the flavor!

I was looking for a "no egg" ice cream recipe and this one is great!  I haven't yet made vanilla but I've used this recipe to make peanut butter cup and coconut ice creams.  I have a batch of Chocolate Malted in the ice cream freezer right now!  Thanks so much for such a wonderful recipe!

It was ok!  I prefer a creamier ice cream.  This was very icy.  My adult kids want me to go back to the old way and that's Junket Tablets used to make ice cream.  You buy them in baking dept. as puddings and gelatins.  My Mom always used it and it makes a very good creamy ice cream.

Made this without alterations and it was wonderful.  Everyone in the family raved over it and it was a great option for the pregnant women in the group who didn't want to eat the raw eggs.

This recipe's makes a great base for multiple ice cream recipes. I made strawberry and "cherry cordial"(cherries and dark/semi sweet chocolate chips) using the base straight(as-is).

* for any fruit mix-ins: Add sugar to fruit in a freezer bag; zip and squeeze the fruit and sugar together. Add the fruit mix-ins AFTER the ice cream is made.

I do cook some of the cream ingredients and add egg to this recipe; while I know this is a "no-cook/no-egg" recipe, I wanted that creamy "Haagen-Daas" texture. I add 4 eggs, using yolks only first, then the whites. It worked beautifully for my pina colada ice cream. Some egg bits do cook in it; a sieve or strainer is best. Also handy is a 2-quart pitcher with multiple openings--great for chilling the mixture/custard before freezing. If you like custard-style, use the slotted opening when pouring the custard; that will get out any egg solids your sieve missed.

Using this recipe straight or making it custard, this is my Master Ice Cream Base.

Very easy!  I never remember how much 1/2 and 1/2 to buy so I go with all heavy cream and mix with 50/50 with milk.  This is a family favorite now.

What a great recipe! This ice cream tastes just like the kind my parents made when I was a kid. I cut the recipe in half and also added 1 extra tsp. of vanilla. This recipe does produce an icy product but that to me is what homemade ice cream is. It will not be creamy like Ben & Jerry's but you will get an authentic homemade flavor. I'll be making this all summer! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was fantastic!  I chose it because of a pregnant friend who was coming over for dinner.  Made it according to directions, but added another teaspoon of vanilla.  I have never made homemade ice cream with out eggs, and was a little nervous about the texture.  It was awesome.  I will use this one from here on out.  Thanks for a great and simple recipe!

I wasn't sure about this recipe, as I usually make ice cream with eggs; but I tried it for July 4th and added butterfingers; and it was heavenly.  It does make quite a bit, more than our ice cream maker would hold; but it was so easy and delicious.  I did warm the sugar and one carton of half and half and let that cool before putting it in the freezer; and this did not taste grainy at all.  Enjoy!  It's a keeper.

Very good homemade flavor--we really enjoyed this. I used half-and-half and one percent milk in place of the cream. I made the recipe for 16 servings, and it ended up overflowing my Cuisinart, so I'll have to adjust the recipe further. Good summertime treat!

This is the best ice cream, as another reviewer said, we also put in Coffee-Mate creamer for a portion of the 1/2 and 1/2. You can use any flavor. I have gotten rave reviews every time I made this. It is now a birthday tradition in our family.

This is a very easy and delicious ice cream.  Try it, you will not regret it.  It does not leave a film in your mouth like many rich ice creams can, yet it tastes creamy and smooth.

Super easy and good!  I did warm the half and half with sugar on the stovetop until the sugar melted, then refrigerated until cold.  It made the perfect size batch for my old electric freezer.

The flavor of this recipe was wonderful, but it took a very long time to freeze. It also had little ice chunks in it rather than being thick and creamy.

LOVE this recipe!  Love it even more that it doesn't include raw eggs!  My husband has experimented with this as the basic recipe and added other flavors.  His favorite--anise flavor with black food color!  Great as just vanilla or as a base for other flavors!

OMG! So simple. So good. Next time, I'll heat one quart of cream with sugar to dissolve and then chill the mixture.  I cannot tell you how good this is. Just make it!

If you are looking for an ice cream recipe without eggs, stop here. It is THE ONE. You'll need no other. I made this for my wife and I and it was perfect. I shared some with my neighbors across the street and also made another batch for my American Legion meeting. It was a grand slam across the board! Everyone loved it!

This was my first time making ice cream so I followed the directions and I think it came out GREAT! The flavor was spot on and it wasn't grainy. Next time I will venture out and add things to it. Thank you for posting this very easy recipe.

Not creamy like ice cream should be.  Yes it was easy but the results weren't worth it to a true ice cream lover.   Needs higher fat content for the true mouth feel of creamy heaven. This is really like iced milk.

We made this ice cream on our last night at the beach. The only recipe change I made was using 1 cup of sugar. I stirred all ingredients for a moment to make sure sugar was dissolved, then poured into a 1-gallon maker. It took about 15-16 minutes for it to make. We let it set up about 5-minutes. There were 13 of us and this recipe made more than enough for all of us.  The kids put sprinkles on theirs, others used chocolate or caramel syrup, while others ate it plain. It was easy & delicious!

GREAT vanilla flavor (I used Mexican Vanilla).  I love that it's no cook, and no eggs.  I will experiment with other flavors using this as a base.

I loved it and my family did as well!  I loved Schoolee's idea of French Vanilla coffee creamer addition as well,  big hit!  

Made it twice, I don't see the need for dissolving sugar by warning. Stir  for 2 - 3 minutes and it dissolves  just fine.  Sugar melts when in liquid hot or cold. 

Like the idea of simplicity, no cooking or raw eggs.  I used Pure Mexican Vanilla. It was delicious!  Nice job on the recipe JKINFLA??

This recipe is great. But it turned out with ice crystals in it. Next time I will not add as much vanilla also. But it is awesome if you add candy to it or fruit.

My daughter is an ice cream aholic, but she uses splenda in place of sugar!!!  I'm one of those people who can tell if something has artificial sweeteners, but I thought it was "Slendid" (no pun intended)!!!  It's the only way I'll eat it.  Blessings!!!

I thought it tasted like frozen whipping cream.  I'm going back to the recipe from my childhood that has eggs in it.  This recipe lacked the richness that eggs add.

Followed recipe as written. It came out very good. It is a little grainy, and I see why others say it's more like ice milk. I actually prefer the taste of ice milk.  It was easy to make and I like that there were no eggs and no cooking involved. The batch made plenty and all who ate it thought it was delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Being vegan, this was a great recipe to use as a jumping off point. I used vegan heavy cream (mimicreme) and coconut milk. I used half monkfruit sweetener and half stevia because we don't do white sugar. Also added some vanilla bean.

OK, so I tweaked this!  When your granddaughter asks for chocolate, that's what you have!  I added 1 cup of dutch process cocoa, and subbed out 1/2 cup of the white sugar for brown.  Chocoholics, beware!  This is seriously good!  Melts a little fast, but who has time for that, lol!

I made this recipe as it was written, and it turned out fabulous.  This is a double batch for the Cuisinart, so anyone with that machine might want to half it (but who wants to half this - it's SO GOOD, and I'm a self-proclaimed chocoholic!!).

I mixed the sugar, 2% milk (my choice instead of half and half, heavy cream and sugar until the sugar had dissolved.  Then I placed in the ice cream maker and made per the instructions of the ice cream maker.  I used vanilla paste in place of the extract so I could have the little flecks of vanilla bean.  Delicious.  My aunt said it was the best ice cream she had ever eaten!

We wanted black licorice ice cream! So I made it! Used this recipe but used anise extract instead. That shows you how versatile this ice cream recipe is! 
If using anise... I recommend cutting the flavoring down to 1/2-3/4 of recommended flavoring.

I made this recipe without an ice cream machine and it turned out great.  Loved the flavor, very creamy - definitely a keeper!  I used vanilla bean paste and it was awesome.  Next time I will have to try mixing in some fudge or chocolate cookies :)

I typically don’t change a recipe on the first try, but I did tweak this slightly.  To lighten even more, I used fat-free half-and-half, mixed in a little bit of a peach puree along with some chopped fresh peaches.  Next time if I add peaches, I will use almond extract instead of vanilla.  It was nice not having to make a custard, and then wait for it to cool before pouring into the ice cream maker.  Texture was not quite as creamy as it would have been using the typical full-fat whipping cream recipes, but this was more than satisfactory considering all the calories and fat I saved.   I guess what I’m saying is that it was less of a guilt trip using this recipe, and it tasted good!

The only sub I made is that I used vanilla bean rather than vanilla extract. That made for fantastic flavor, but I found the texture to be just shy of perfect. I would've given 5 stars for simplicity PLUS perfect, creamy texture. Don't get me wrong, the family ate every bite, but I could tell it wasn't as creamy as I wanted it to be. IMO you really need a eggs to get that truly creamy texture in homemade ice cream.

I really like this ice cream recipe with a few alterations.  I don't stock half&half, but do stock heavy cream, so I substitute equal parts of heavy cream and 2% milk for the half&half.  It's the only recipe I have tried where the ice cream doers not get too hard and icy after being in the freezer a few days.  I also increased the vanilla to 6 teaspoons, since I didn't think there was enough vanilla flavor.

This. Is. Too. Die. For.

I used vanilla bean paste to flavour....MMMmmmmm!   I've been trying to get away from processed food, including ice-cream, and this seriously ROCKS.  Thanks for sharing the recipe! (PS - I scaled the recipe to 18 servings and for my hubby and I it is the perfect amount.  It also is the perfect amount for our ice cream maker).

It was a little disappointing we got all excited about having homemade ice cream, but when we tasted it it was almost flavor less. The only way this recipe would taste good is if you put a lot of chocolate syrup on it!

This was good; it was a light vanilla taste. I didn't let it stir long enough in my ice cream maker I think because although parts of it came out creamy I also had a bit of it which had more of an ice milk consistency. I'm a bit of a beginner at making ice cream, so I'll try again, I am looking for a just a  tad richer and creamier ice cream.

I really wanted to like this ice cream, but I found it to be more of an ice milk taste/texture. I should've paid more attention to the ingredient list.

It was easy.  But it had no flavor!  It tasted like whipped cream!    And it's icy, not creamy.  If I were to ever try this again, which I doubt, I'm thinking 2 or 2 1/2 cups of sugar, and 6 or 8 teaspoons of vanilla.

I loved that this recipe did not involve cooking, raw eggs, or waiting and chilling the mixture for any length of time. We halved the recipe for our little 4 person family and added fresh chopped strawberries. The next day we went to a local fruit packing place that prides themselves on their homemade ice cream. My kids and I agreed, ours was better! Thanks for this easy and affordable recipe!

I really love this recipe.  I do cook a little liquid to dissolve the sugar.  I use a clear vanilla from Mexico that really makes it special.

So good!!! If there is one thing I would alter, it would be sugar content. If you like your ice cream very sweet, this would be perfect. I'm still giving this recipe five stars, because we loved it.

Great taste. My family doesn't care for half and half so we substituted milk in it's place. Great creamy taste! Threw in a chunked up green and black dark chocolate bar and it was a HUGE hit!

We made this last night for the hubby's birthday.  It was the perfect ice-cream to have with chocolate cake.  If serving alone, I think it would need a little something extra.  But for the most part?  WONDERFUL!

Tastes good, kind of icy because it's not a custard type.  My family prefers the creamier texture of a recipe that requires cooking.  If you're in a rush, though, this is a very easy recipe.

This did not turn out well for me. The flavor was nice but the consistency was horrible. It was very icy and would not harden in the ice cream machine. I stuck this in the freezer and it just turned into rock hard frozen cream.

This reminds me of when I was growing up in the 50's.  Very simple and very good.  It's even better when you add mashed up bananas or strawberry before freezing.  Crazy good stuff!

I scaled this down to 16 servings in order to fit in my 1.5 qt. maker, and otherwise I didn't change a thing (except to stir all the ingredients together in a bowl and then pour into the maker). Fabulous ice cream! No grainyness from the sugar, and a very nice taste. Will definitely make again. Made excellent root beer floats for July 4th. :)

I made this for my daughters graduation party.  It was absolutely great!  I used 1 quart half-n-half and 1 quart heavy cream.  I used 1/4 of a madagascar vanilla bean and kept everything else the same.  It was not grainy and it was very creamy.  Everyone loved it!!!!! Thank you for such an easy and tasty recipe!

Very good recipe.  I dissolved the sugar in about 1/4 of the half and half.  The ice cream was a bit grainy, but that is how I expect homemade ice cream to be.

Followed exactly. (but I did semi disolve the sugar in microwave, with milk)
Very good...but..it still has a GRAINY texture, from the sugar (or salt?)
Its a CLEAN, fresh tasting icecream, not overly creamy...but good none the less.

This is a very simple recipe. The ice cream is very good and creamy. I personally reduce the sugar as I do not like my ice cream quite that sweet.

Excellent taste and texture without a lot of fuss. For a variation, I added one scoop of Chai instant hot beverage instead of vanilla extract. Decreased sugar to 1c. Wonderful!!

I LOVE IT!!!  I added in mini chocolate chips & it tasted and had the texture of Breyers all natural chocolate chip ice cream (my all-time favorite).  This is the recipe that will totally blow my diet. Thanks a bunch.

Made this tonight for guests and they raved about it and just generally seemed impressed that I would go to the "trouble". HA!  This was soooo much better than another recipe I tried from this sight that used whipped cream. It's so easy and very creamy.  This will become my standard recipe for vanilla!

This is the first time I made ice cream and was a little scared to use the recipes with raw eggs so I came across this one and I'm so glad I decided to make it. It was so easy and so delicious. I cut the recipe in half only because there is 2 of us and I'm mad I did because I need to make more already. So much better than store bought. I didn't think it was too sweet like others had said. This is a great vanilla ice cream, next time I'm going to add oreo's.

We used this for a recent Girl Scout cook out.  I doubled it for the large maker we own.  We only took home a very small amount as most people had second.  The recipe was so loved that one family was inspired to get their own ice cream maker.  :)

What a great, simple recipe.  I actually made eggnog ice cream using this recipe.  I used 3 cups of organic egg nog, 1 cup of heavy cream (to make up for the fact that I accidentaly bought lowfat eggnog- but I used two kinds and one was full-fat) and 1/2 cup half-and-half.  Just used 2 tablespoons of sugar since the eggnog is already sweet.  I did add about 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and only half the vanilla.  Rum extract would have been good but I didn't have any.  Only took 2 minutes to put together and about 20 minutes in my ice cream freezer.  So good!  The whole family enjoyed.

This recipe was so easy, but the best part is how it tasted...wonderful. I've made it several times now and when my son had his tonsils out, that was the only ice cream he wanted. It's not too sugary. I also put sliced strawberries into this and it too came out great!

Next time I will substitute whole milk for the heavy cream for a lighter version because as it melted, it looked like pure cream.  I scaled it to 12 to fit in my machine and it called for 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar.  I substituted 2 tablespoons honey for that 1 tablespoon sugar.  I love the honey flavor and it was just really excellent.  It was SO good that I couldn't stop myself from eating it out of the top of the machine as it was freezing!

This was wonderful!!! The taste was amazing and it was so easy!! Perfect, sweet, and creamy. It did freeze a little too hard to scoop, but that's no big deal. Just let it set out before you scoop it! :)

This ice cream had a really good flavor, but it had a grainy texture.  That may have been because I didn't let it churn long enough...I'm not sure.  Nevertheless, I probably won't make this one again.

More like vanilla ice milk than ice cream... seemed too light, not creamy enough, but that may be my own fault for using half and half instead of heavy cream. But it does remind me of those shaved ices you can get in cafes, etc. Not bad, just not what I wanted/expected.

I wanted an egg-free recipe since a friend is pregnant.  Followed the recipe but used only 3 tsp of vanilla and added 12 mini butterfinger bars moderately chopped up.  No noticeable problems with the sugar being gritty, and the consistency was terrific.  I couldn't believe it was firm as it turned out after only ~25 minutes in the ice-cream maker.  Seems like an excellent base for whatever you want to try.  My new go-to.

So simple.  It makes the BEST homeade icecream ever.  We like to put fres strawberries in our food processor and then add them to the icecream as it's churning.  Also candy tates yum-yum, too!

Just tried this recipe for a church ice cream social (first time without cooked base ever), and the teenagers especially loved it ...was told it was the best vanilla ice cream at the party!  Great tastes and did not have grainy or buttery problem...very tasty.

This was far too "buttery" tasting and not nearly sweet enough.  I'd suggest adding extra sugar and vanilla flavoring.

This was PERFECT!!! Cut recipe in half for my 2 qt ice cream maker, otherwise followed the directions exactly. Makes a great base. Perfectly creamy, but not too rich. I added crunched up butterfinger in the last minutes of churning. So delicious!

I really enjoyed this recipe, my only note is that I wish that the vanilla stuck out more in the flavor. Otherwise, it was a great consistency and tasted great! Make this recipe even better by adding in your own mix-ins, I added crushed chocolate bits and cookie dough :)

Delicious!  I didn’t have half and half, but I had whole milk and heavy cream, so I did 3 cups of whole milk, 1.5 cups heavy cream, 3/4 cup sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla, and 1/2 pinch of salt (the recipe was scaled to 16 servings).  Can’t wait to try this again with strawberries, blackberries, or peach purée!

Flavor was average. The texture was not creamy and the ice cream didn’t get as firm as it usually does. We have made ice cream many times and never had a problem with texture or consistency before.

I usually use a recipe with eggs. I decided to try this one. It was awesome! I heated the half and half with the sugar the night before I made it. This is definitely my new recipe when I fix ice cream in the future!

I made a couple of modifications based on previous reviews. I increased whipping cream to 1 pint and added 1/4 c of Carnation Coffee-mate french vanilla creamer to the mix. So delicious and so simple.

The recipe was actually really good! the only problem was that after you ate a bit of the ice cream you started getting an uncomfortable coating on the top of your mouth. :(

My seven year old son wanted to make ice cream for his dad's birthday yesterday.  I chose this recipe for its simplicity so he could do it himself.  The ice cream was surprisingly good and got rave reviews. I am so glad it made a full gallon- even with large helpings for a family of six plus a visiting grandma, we still have plenty left to enjoy tonight! 
We made the recipe exactly. but be sure to use real vanilla extract.  You can't disguise an imitation flavor with such simple ingredients.

My whole family of 6 absolutely loved this. I did substitute 1 quart of half and half for milk just because i didn't have enough half and half but still turned out delicious. I have 4 kids 9 and under and they requested over 3 servings!!! The best ice cream recipe and without eggs!

I read a ton of recipes and all the reviews before  settling on this one. I mixed 3/4 cup brown sugar with 4 tsps strong coffee over heat until the sugar dissolved then I removed from heat and stirred in 3 cups heavy whipping cream, 1.5 cups of half and half, and a pinch of salt. I chilled this for two hours before processing in the ice cream maker. It is scaled down for a 2qt ice cream maker. Loved the creamy, rich, buttery, coffee soft serve I ended up with. We ate it immediately. Thanks for the guidance for my first go at ice cream!

This had wonderful flavor!  I made the recipe pretty much as is (I didn't actually measure the vanilla, but would guess I poured in 4-5 tsp).  We didn't wait on our ice cream maker to finish churning, so it was a very loose consistency, but the flavor was exceptional.  Will make again and would recommend to anyone.

My family loves this ice cream. It is super easy and super delicious. I don't know if I would ever try a vanilla recipe that required cooking the ingredients. This one is too simple and too tasty.

This ice cream was best soft served. Like other reviews it was a bit grainy when soft served and icy one placed in the freezer, but that did not affect the taste at all just texture. Soft served had a light grainy texture and when frozen it was very airy and slightly icy. It was super delicious either way!!! I have never made ice cream before. I did add a dash more of the vanilla essence than suggested and I used organic vanilla essence to maximize the natural flavor.

I make this version of homemade vanilla ice cream every year with my kindergarten class.  It is quick and easy.  I use the old-fashioned crank ice cream maker.  The kids love making it and eating it.

This recipe is simple and fail-proof since you must put it in the freezer to set.  We like to add smashed Oreos to make it special.

I'm giving this a 4 for flavor. This one is hard to rate for me. I had trouble from the beginning getting this frozen in my ice cream maker. I had put the bowl in the freezer the night before so I determined it needed to be frozen 24 hours so back into the freezer it went and the mixture went into the refrigerator. I tried freezing the ice cream again the next morning, no go. I had scaled this recipe in half to fit my ice cream freezer. I increased the heavy cream to 2 cups for 1/2 recipe and took the half and half down to 2-1/4 cups hoping to make a creamier texture. I added 2 vanilla beans in place of the  vanilla. Since I gave up on my ice cream freezer I tossed it in a freezer container and in the freezer it went. For some reason this turned out very icy for me. I'm not sure if it was because of the way I ended up freezing it or if it was the ratio of more heavy cream to half and half I used. I can't imagine it being from more heavy cream since that is richer than half and half. The flavor was awesome but I'm not sure I would make it again. It turned out more like ice milk for me.

My ice cream maker is smaller so I scaled back the recipe, and increase the cream to light cream ratio after reading the reviews.  This was a simple and easy recipe that made a very nice vanilla ice cream.

We enjoyed this vanilla ice cream with some bananas foster!  It was not as creamy as some others (due to the half and half to cream ratio) - but it was still tasty.

This was so easy to make and is really yummy! I used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer ice cream maker attachment, and it worked like a charm. I didn't need to make any changes to the recipe, it has a great depth of flavor and is rich and creamy. Yum!

Have used a similar recipe for 3 years.  Instead of sugar and cream, use 2-3 cans of sweetened condensed milk.  Blend all ingredients prior to putting in mixer container.  No chance of graininess with this modification.

This recipe wasn't for me.  I will stick
to my old fashioned cooked vanilla custard
ice cream.  This wasn't very creamy and
not much flavor.

Warmed the cream and half and half to dissolve the sugar. Chilled overnight. Awesome vanilla ice cream! Saves well and doesn't freeze solid.

This is delicious!!!  After making it I put right into the freezer for 2 hours but could wait no longer.  The consistency was like a milkshake and sooooo.good!!!  The only changes I made were using Truvia Baking Blend sweetner instead of sugar and I took about 1/8  cup of water and dissolved the sweetener and salt in it and reduced 1/8 cup of the heavy cream ......next time I will not reduce any cream....and try to dissolve the sugar in a little of the half n half first.  I think the water even such a small amount made it too thin.  We will never buy commercial preservative laden, artificial ingredient laden ice cream again!!!!!

So good!  I did as some other reviews suggested and used about 1/3 c. of vanilla creamer for 1/3 c. of the 1/2 & 1/2.  Next time, I might add even more vanilla or maybe some vanilla bean, but it's a great, EASY & FAST vanilla recipe!

I would have given this icecream a 5 star but I made a lot of changes. First off, I used 2 and a 1/4 cup of half/half and heavy cream. I used 5 and 1/2 tsps of vanilla and added rasiberries, chocolate chips, and walnuts. After that it was great, but as others stated, it came out more like ice as is.

This ice cream turned out more like ice than cream. It was also way too heavy on the vanilla flavor, but I did use Mexican vanilla, so maybe that was just me.

Super yummy!  I like the idea of no eggs.  We made it together as a family, using our ice cream maker for the first time.  It was easy, and it tastes great, even after days in the freezer.

Very good no-egg/no-cook base recipe.  Here is a modification idea that I tried and had great results with:  replace some of the 1/2 and 1/2 with flavored coffee creamer and adjust the sugar accordingly - you'll use maybe half the called for sugar.  I found a buttercream flavored creamer to use - the ice cream was delicious!

I really liked the taste of this ice cream, but it wasn't really the texture I wanted. I wanted a harder texture, but this was sort of like frozen whipped cream. If you are looking for something light, this recipe is for you.

I sort of followed this recipe...had to be scaled down a lot for my tiny ice cream maker.  I used 2 cups half-and-half, 1 cup skim milk, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla.  The ice cream was sweet and flavorful enough, but it clearly needed more fat (should have used heavy cream or whole milk instead of skim) b/c it was a little icy.  Pretty good though!

Good for a no cook.  Better if you're impatient like I was, but still not quite the creamy yumminess that a custard based ice cream produces.

This is a good vanilla ice cream that sets up just a touch icey. I made it in an ice cream maker using french vanilla flavored coffeemate and half the amount of suggested sugar. Flavors mellowed with time, such that I think it tasted better the next day than fresh. Even straight from the freezer I was able to scoop it, though the texture did not lend itself to classic round smooth scoops (wedges of ice cream worked much better).

I gave it five stars when I would love to give it a ten star. Thank you for tis recipe it is so easy on any tommy young and old, not too much sugar and easy to make with or without an ice cream machine. If and when you have left overs longer than a few days it still taste fresh.  One of the best that I have had, I let the ingredients set for a few days the first time that I made it. The second time no one wanted to wait longer than a day to put it in the ice cream machine.   Each time it was excellent.

Pretty Good stuff. Tasted very good but the texture was just a bit off for me (not smooth)but somehow that could have been my fault since I'm totally new at this homemade ice cream thing.  I let the icecream ripen overnight in the freezer and even the next day it scooped out very easily.

Rave reviews from the 14 people we served it to. Nothing left.... Did as suggested and dissolved the sugar in the half/half first and added 1/4 tsp almond as well. Helps (but not necessary) to also make mixture a day early and get really cold in the refrig.

This is by far the BEST vanilla icecream my wife and I have ever had!!!  We used the recipe exactly as shown at the top of the page, with one small addition-- we added the pulp of 1 vanilla bean (crushed and scraped from the bean) to the mix before placing it in the icecream maker.  It added an awesome layer of flavor along with the vanilla extract, and gave it that "authentique" vanilla icecream look with the tiny black specks.

This is delicious! I dissolved the sugar in the heavy cream and let it cool in the fridge until it was cold. Then proceeded as the recipe advises with the addition of a little bit of almond extract to add flavor. Mix ins would be a great idea!

As others have stated, this is ice milk. I thought that it had to be creamy with all of the milk fat...not so. I prefer a cooked custard. May try junket tablets that another member suggested or plain gelatin???

This recipe made two batches for my kitchenaid icecream maker attachment. We made half and refrigerated the other half to make later in the week. The texture is not quite as creamy as full-fat icecream, but we really liked it and will make it again and again. It is easy to make with few ingredients and less guilt!

This was good, but after it froze in my freezer overnight it turned very icy.  I assume that's because the recipe doesn't include eggs.  Otherwise, it was good.  I also used some of the other reviewer's suggestion to use vanilla creamer instead of the heavy cream - good addition, and it added a nice flavor.  We'll make this again, I'm sure, but I'm still going to keep looking for other recipes.

Good Recipe...Very expensive, but I've been wanting to try it. I made mine as chocolate. I followed the recipe but added almonds and chocolate syrup to taste. Then froze in freezer for 24 hrs after it came out of ice cream machine.

The flavor was nice but it was very icy. Maybe it was my ice cream maker? Either way we didn't eat much of it because of the icy texture.

I thought this was just ok. The flavor was very good, but I couldn't get past the texture. It seemed too much like ice milk to me but hubby and the kids loved it!

I have made this recipe according to the directions and LOVE the taste. I just have 1 problem, it seems to freeze too hard after being put in the freezer. I make milkshakes with the ice cream (entire reason I tried it) and we can barely scoop it out. Any suggestions?

My husband loves ice cream.  He's eaten some of the best commercial ice cream there is, but this homemade ice cream is his favorite. He loves the taste as well as the texture.  When I make it, I make it in small batches in a small counter top ice cream maker and use a good brand of vanilla.

I cut the recipe down to 12 servings to fit in my 1 & 1/2 qt ice cream maker. I was out of half & half so I used half cream & half 2% organic milk. I also scraped out a vanilla bean in place of the extract. Thsi ice cream was great! I removed half the batch from the freezer after it wsa done & then added 3 tbp. all natural peanut butter to the remainder & whirled it in my maker until it was mixed. That was great too!

Very good, but I like the creamy texture of the egg based recipes. Did not have any problem with the sugar being grainy.

This is the best! Okay, so I played with it a little (no offense intended). I added the instant vanilla pudding called for in VAnilla IV (because it just seemed so logical) and it worked. Thank you for a wonderful summer treat.

Very good.  Not real sweet, but just enough sweetness for me.  I could have easily upped the sugar to 2 cups.  I may try a few more different ice cream recipes since this was my first attempt.  I can't say that I got rave reviews by my guests, but it was still very good.
