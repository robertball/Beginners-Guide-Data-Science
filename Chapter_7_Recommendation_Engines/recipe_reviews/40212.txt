This is Indian comfort food.  I would make this once a week if I could get away with it.  This is definitely one of my faves.

This was really missing something.  It's not bad, in fact I made it twice thinking I did something wrong the first time!  Maybe some garlic sauteed with the onion and apple?  Someone else might try that, cause I'm not trying it a third time . . .

This was yummy, I didn't have garam marsala, or cumin, so I put in a teaaspoon of allspice instead of garam marsala, it gave it a nice, sweet flavor but not overpowering.  I think that next time I'll try it with the right spices.  But it was very nice for something different.

Delicious! I just discovered I liked Indian food last weekend. The only modification I made was I used "mild curry powder" from my work (world market) which was yellow and not red. Followed everything else to a T. The light coconut milk combined with the apple, onion, garam masala, and curry powder makes a flavorful, creamy sauce! next time i will serve with basmati rice but all i had on hand was brown rice so i mixed that with some onion, bell pepper, chicken broth, golden raisins and garam masala. my husband who hates curry said he was "pleasantly surprised" and that it was "a million times better than the last time (he) had curry" though he still doesn't like the flavor of curry itself. oh well it's a start. Highly reccomended!

This was wonderful chicken curry!  I used red curry paste in the sauce instead of the curry powder on the chicken and it turned out great.  A friend who lived in Thailand came over for dinner and made curried chicken and it tased the same as this recipe....I think this one was a little better :o)!

This is a fabulous recipe!  After 35+ years of cooking experience, this was my first time making Indian food.  I had to purchase two new spices for this dish and it was worth every penny of it.  My husband and daughter have both asked me to make this again.  I thought the spices were adjusted perfectly and I was surprised that the meal wasn't as spicy hot as some cajun dishes I've fixed.  I'll definitely add this to my favorite recipe file.

This was an amazing dish. We simply loved it. I did add some more 'heat' with cayenne but everything was simply superb. I love the McCormick spices and was so thrilled to find them in my local market. I DO NOT WORK for McCormick!!!! :)  Simply put this recipe is a 5*keeper. Don't judge me~ Judge the recipe!

Made this yesterday for lunch.  It was delicious.  My wife doesn't normally like curry dishes, and she raved about this.  Brought leftovers to work today and it had my Indian co-worker salivating.  I'll definitely make it again (in fact my wife asked me to make it for her "girls night out" progressive dinner in a couple weeks.

This recipe is so delicious! A male friend made it for me several years ago, and, bored with the old Italian standbys, I decided to make something a little more exotic or at least something different and new for my fiance. Success! This is pretty darn easy to make - and he said it was some of the best food he had ever eaten, including the fancy restaurant dinners he'd had growing up in NYC. I've tweaked it to my own liking but even without changes it's a fantastic recipe!!

This was great.  I used a wok for cooking the meat, versus a regular frying pan.

I'd give this recipe 4.5 stars if I could.  It was really very tasty, and not at all hard to make.  As indian food goes, it wasn't "hot", but the spices can be easily adjusted.  I thought it had a nice kick nonetheless.

I doubled the ingredients in the flour mixture because it didn't seem like enough.  In addition, I used dried apricots instead of apples -- this was good, but apples would probably be better.

This was good but not nearly spicy enough.  It was really pretty bland as an Indian dish.  I might make it again and tweak the recipe though.

We loved this meal.  My 5 year old asked if I could make it every night.  Next time I'll double it because I was so disappointed that there weren't leftovers.

This was a very tasty, easy recipe with an exotic Indian taste. I used frozen stir-fry vegetables and served it with rice.

This recipe is fabulous.  My husband and son polished their plates!  If you are looking for something spicy, this is NOT it.  This dish is very fragrant, flavorful and sweet, and goes great over white rice.  I used regular curry because I didn't have any red, and it came out brilliantly.  Give it a shot, if you don't expect typical "Indian Heat", you won't be disappointed!

LOVE this recipe. Simple and very tasty.  Only change made was to add cayenne pepper as we like our Indian dishes hot!

It turned out well for my first time. I would add more garlic salt and a little sea salt for more taste.
