This recipe is excellent. I used Veal Schnitzel instead of scotch fillet but other than that followed the recipe correctly. The mustard sauce has a lovely strong flavour which works well with the delicate avocado and veal flavours. My boyfriend loved it !!!

This was quite good. The only thing I would do differently would be to add more, or stronger mustard. My husband thought it was Hollandaise! Very tasty though, nice combination.

It's a shame the steaks I used were so chewy - the mustard sauce paired with the avocado was absolutely delicious! The only problem I had was that the sauce was a little bit lumpy. It didn't make any difference to the taste, of course, but the presentation wasn't as good as it could have been. I would definitely make it again though. Thanks, Thomas!

A nice combination of flavors.  I don't understand the reviewer who suggested the sauce might possibly be difficult or even maybe labor intensive ?  The instructions are very clear and easy to follow.

This is outstanding!!!
I used another reviewers suggestion of using veal schnitzel instead of steak - turned out fantastic.
Sure the mustard sauce is probably a little tricky for some people to make but I urge you to give it a go!

I had sirloin, so I pounded it out...a different cut of meat would have worked better. The flavor was amazing though..I loved the sauce with the avacados. I'll make this again with a better cut of meat.

I love these steaks, was a bit skeptical with avocado and mustard sauce but it was truly amazing. Everyone in my family liked it as well,even the boys who generally don't like avocado.

I felt that 2 eggs plus 3 egg yolks was a waste.  So, instead of dipping the steak into a beaten "whole" egg, I used the three egg whites from the three egg yolks.  Worked fine!  I didn't have Dijon mustard, used Spicy Brown, it worked. I would love to try it with Dijon.

This recipe is good, but a bit of a pain to make.

I thought this turned out really well, however, I do agree with other reviewers that it would benefit from a stronger mustard sauce.  My bf doesn't eat avocados and wouldn't touch the sauce, so I made his with bernaise sauce (from a dry mix) and he said it was really good with the steak.

I liked this recipe however no one else in my family did.  I think it was the egg.  The presentation was not at all pretty and I think that also made everyone "think" it was not good and I like to pride myself on being a good cook.  Maybe I will try again but without the egg?

I am a great cook and I did not like this at all.  Leave out the egg and it might be better.  Needs more flavor so I added sauteed garlic and seasoning salt. Everything besides the egg was fine.  Will not make this again.

Turned out very well! I am a chef by no means, but decided to give it a shot... fairly easy to make and had most of the ingredients on-hand already. Polished it off with a bottle of smooth Italian wine... NICE!

i couldn't find scotch file steaks, so i used 'round eye' steaks... It was good. I made more sauce, because amount in the recipe was not enough for 4 steaks. The sause was great...

This recipe was really good.  I used rib fillet but could have used veal.  The sauce was so tasty and worked wonderfully well with the avocado.
