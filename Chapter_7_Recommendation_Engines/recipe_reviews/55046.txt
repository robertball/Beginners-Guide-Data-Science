The easiest queso ever! It's a staple. A couple of tips: Don't drain the RoTel - you're supposed to add the juice. To give it a head start, melt the cheese (dice it) and tomatoes in the microwave, one minute at a time. Stir between zaps. For a heartier dip, add some ground beef that's been browned and drained. Keep a bottle of beer handy to thin the queso if it starts drying out in the slow cooker. Enjoy!

I have been making this for years but had forgotten about it until we moved to Texas, where it is a staple appetizer at most Mexican restaurants.  I usually make the whole 2 lb. block of cheese, and spice it up with more salsa, garlic powder and a little milk to thin it out.

I am from Georgia and make this all the time!  The only difference is that I add one package of breakfast sausage (determine your own choice of mild, spicy, or hot), browned before added to the crockpot.

Great basic recipe!  My family's been making this forever, but adds a couple dashes of cumin, and some sliced scallions.... Always a winner!

Another variation on this popular dip is to add a can of chili.

I laughed when I saw this because it has been such a staple in my family for years, it's almost part of the basic food pyramid. But for those of you that this recipe is new for, you cannot go wrong. Always good with chips or on burritos and never disappoints.

Very simple and not bad. Someone gave me half a "loaf" of processed cheese so I used it for this. Since I only had half the loaf I only used one well drained can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.
