My favorite banana bread recipe is one my mom got more than 40 years ago from a Home Ec teacher friend.  It is a sour cream based banana bread, moist, delicious, and the standard by which I compare any other banana bread recipe I feel like trying. Using that favorite banana bread as a comparison, I find the bread made from this recipe is pale rather than richly golden brown, light and fluffy (more like cake) rather than being dense as a quick bread should be, rather flavorless and not nearly as rich and moist as it should be.  Surprising, since this recipe calls for twice the amount of sour cream as mine does!

The bread itself was very moist. I used 2 bananas which equaled 1 c mashed... Next time I would def used 3-4 bananas because the bread wasn't very distinctive. I also added some chunks of chocolate and used whole wheat flour. I baked it for about 50 min. at 350  The second time I baked this I used about 4 bananas skipped the chocolate cuz I didnt have any and added walnuts...very moist and delicious!!

I wish my camera wasn't broken. This bread looks SO pretty. I used FF plain yogurt instead of sour cream and added a tsp. of vanilla. I seperated the batter between two greased loaf pans, which made them about half full. I didn't need to cover them halfway through and I didn't have any issues with the bread cooking too quickly on the outside. Very simple bread and the yogurt lends a nice tang. I'll make this again.

This is a *great* banana bread recipe! I have started looking for baked goods recipes with sour cream-- my fridge will always be stocked with it from now on. Make sure you add the cinnamon and vanilla-- they forgot to put it in the actual recipe but they have it in the video. I forgot 'til I put the batter in the pan so I put them in there and stirred LOL but obviously this is not ideal! Coating the pan with cinnamon sugar and sprinkling on top with a few extra walnuts (save some!) makes a big difference in presentation and taste of the crust :)

My kids are banana bread freaks so I doubled this recipe right away.  I filled a bundt pan and had enough to make 12 additional muffins.  This recipe bakes into a nice, fluffy, and moist bread.  It's a little more on the "cake" side of the street than the banana bread recipe I am currently using.  I've tried a lot of different banana bread recipes.  This one ranks right up there with the best of them.  We'll make this one again.

Perfect!  My Family loved it!  I had all of the ingredients in house.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. cinnamon, baked for 1 hr. then covered in foil for 10 mins. more.  Lasted for about a week and still very moist.  Definitely NEEDS NUTS!

This came out very good - I doubled the recipe, using 5 small bananas, 2 eggs and 1/3 cup egg whites and subbing 1 cup white whole wheat flour, so I used 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour.  I also left the salt at 1/2 tsp.  The loaves baked up perfectly in one hour, golden brown and moist, but not "gooey" like some banana breads get.  Really nice recipe!

This is a nice light, airy banana bread.  I omitted the walnuts and added a half a teaspoon of apple pie spice.  I used regular fat sour scream because it was what I had on hand. Took the whole hour to bake, and a little more.  All in all a good recipe, although I would prefer a denser texture.

I tried this recipe, because I didn't have all the ingredients to make my all time favorite recipe (Banana Sour Cream Bread) that's on here.  I omitted the nuts and doubled the recipe to make two loaves.  The bread does turn out very moist, but it just is missing a little more sweetness that the other recipe has.  This is not a bad one, but the other is still my favorite!

Very nice banana bread recipe. I added  1tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnimon as I always add these to banana bread.Adds a nice flavour. I would use less sugar next time and I subbed chocolate chips for the nuts(allergies).One problem with this recipe is the bake time. Way off. I had to cook mine for 1 hour and 45 min. At 1 hour it was still completely raw in the centre.

This was a great recipe. Very tasty bread went quick.
The only thing since it is so moist cutting a piece it tends to fall apart a little bit. Great recipe and yummy!

My grandmas banana bread was the most important thing at family gatherings.  She used buttermilk instead of sour cream and crisco instead of butter.  Every one always begs for the recipe, but it's grandma ad my secret.  I'll pass it along to my girls.

This was really good, I followed the directions exact except substituting pecans for the walnuts because that's what I had on hand.  I did have to bake it about 15-20 minutes longer though...my pan may have been a little smaller causing this.

I would give this four and a half if I could.  I did need to leave it in the oven for an extra 10 minutes for it to be fully baked.  It was very moist, and it was a hit at the family gathering I took it to.  Still, I added an extra banana to the recipe, since I like the added flavor.  I may consider using even one more next time plus a little vanilla.  Great base recipe for banana bread, though

Wonderful--I added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon to the batter and also used the sugar & cinnamon mixture to coat the pan with. I forgot to add the salt but you couldn't tell. Yummy with pecans!

Everyone liked this bread better than a traditional banana bread. It was more moist and would be a great way to use up leftover sour cream.

Very good.  This was light and fluffy and not overly sweet. Very tasty especially when hot.

Very easy to make.  I will make this many times again.  Can't wait to share it with friends.  Super moist.

So delicious, light and airy. I added 1 tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla, and a few dashes of nutmeg and allspice. I toasted the walnuts in the oven for 10 minutes before chopping them and mixing into the batter. I baked it for 1 hour, then covered with foil and baked for an additional 10 minutes just to make sure it was cooked all the way through. My 92-year-old dad said it was the best banana bread he had ever tasted.

I did not make any changes and was very impressed with the texture. I will make this again for sure.
