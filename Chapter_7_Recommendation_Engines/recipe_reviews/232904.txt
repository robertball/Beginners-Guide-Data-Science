Made for Recipe Group. So simple and easy, why didn't I think of that?! I used the microwave lemon curd recipe to make the curd(and had to thicken mine too), already had the phyllo shells, it was a match made in heaven! They tasted like tiny lemon meringue pies, love it! Thanks Paula!

My husband has a killer lemon curd  recipe we used for this, which we also found on all recipes. Also, I hate fake whipped topping like cool whip, so instead made homemade whipped cream with a little sugar in it.  Lastly, I left off the cinnamon and instead took  equal parts lemon zest and sugar and mixed them together with a few... and i mean few drops of lemon juice and i sprinkled that on top of the whipped cream. This is the perfect balance of sweet and tart, and not too much of either. This is a perfect light delicious spring or summertime dessert.

Recipe Group Selection:  12, April 2014 ~  A nice, delicious, tart, yet sweetened lemon tart.  After looking at three stores for lemon curd I finally made my own using 'Microwave Lemon Curd' from AR.  It was a great recipe although I had to thicken to use in the phyllo shells.  I made these for Easter and they were a hit.  Paula, thank you for this simple recipe.  I already have 2 other occasions that I know I will be making these again.
