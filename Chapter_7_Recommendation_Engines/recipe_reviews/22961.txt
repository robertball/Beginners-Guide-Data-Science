I don't know what either of the other reviewers are talking about.  The sugar IS listed in cups, not teaspoons.  My cake rose just fine.  Plus, if you either reheat the cake pain in a sink of hot tap water for about 30 seconds and then tap it out, it comes out easily.  To make it even easier, just use parchment to line the bottom of the cake pan before you butter and flour it.  ANY good baker knows both of these tricks and I can only assume the other people who have reviewed the cake don't bake very often, or at least they don't bake cakes.

This recipe was exquisite, very lemony, and rich.  If you don't like as much lemon, just use 1/4 cup milk in place of the lemon juice in the cake recipe and you'll essentially have a white cake to use with the lemon filling and glaze.

We do a food network night (my kids and I)and my 11 year old son who is disabled especially enjoys it.  He won the cake contest with this recipe.  It was great, moist, lemony and tasty.  My neice asked me to make it for her wedding party.  If you had a negative experience with this, you should remember that over mixing, adding ingredients in the wrong sequence or not correctly measuring some ingredients can totally change the outcome of a recipe.

I often have clients request "lemony" cakes in my home dessert business.  I have several "old reliable" recipes, but I was intrigued by this recipe.  I made the cake 3 times as an experiment with friends & clients & the response was consistent (& I agree):  the lemon flavor is good, but the cake is way too dense (egg yolks versus whole eggs).  The cake was easy to make & I didn't have any problems with the cake coming out of the bundt or tube pan.  I always use Baker's Joy spray (plus parchment paper for tube pans) & never have problems.  I did like the glaze and decided to use it with another recipe on this site.  I modified the Kentucky Butter Cake recipe and then glazed the cake with the lemon glaze from this recipe.  The result was good--a lemony cake that was moist and not too dense.

The only thing that makes this an "ultimate" lemon cake is the fact that you drizzle on so much lemon "sauce" afterwards.  With that stuff - you could soak a couch cushion in it and it would taste the same. The batter has very little lemon flavor to it - just some lemon juice.  Lemon doesn't hold up well to baking - the flavor sort of dissapates.  I did change the recipe - and I know I hate people's reviews when they change it but - well if others do it, so can I!  I wanted a lemon CAKE.  Not a plain cake soaked in lemon juice.  So - I added the zest of a whole lemon to the batter.  I couldn't see making this thing with what little lemon juice it called for and having any remaining lemon flavor after baking.  Zest was necessary!  Also - I didn't just use egg yolks.  I didn't see the point - so rather than use EIGHT egg yolks: I used 4 whole eggs.  Less work, less hassle, and the cake cooked up BEAUTIFULLY.  This is a very solid nicely colored lemon cake.  Well, at least MY version was!!!

Very lemony flavor. I've made this cake twice. The first time,in a rush,I didn't wait the full hour cooling time. The cake fell apart coming out of the pan because the center was still hot. 
(But it tasted yummy so if at first you don't succeed...:) Second try I added an additional 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup more lemon juice to the cake.  Before pouring on the hot glaze I used a metal skewer to poke holes in the cake. This allowed the hot glaze to soak more evenly into the cake. I cooled the cake in the pan 1 hour according to directions, ran a butter knife around the sides of the pan before turning and it came out perfect.

This recipe is superb and the reviewers who had trouble with it were probably not following the directions.  I used a commercial oil-flour spray rather than butter and flour and the cake came out of the Bundt pan neatly and well.  The glaze is delicious and I have made this cake several times with no problems whatsoever.  As for its density, I was very pleased with it and thought the cake was perfectly moist and delectible.

This is the absolute best lemon cake I have every put in my mouth.  I have to agree, I don't know what the negative reviews are about.  The first time I made the cake, I did have a problem with it falling out in pieces.  But the cake was so delectable every morsel was eaten.  I found the cake very time consuming, but DEFINITELY worth it!!!!!!!!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

I think this is one of the worst lemon cakes I have ever made.  I have tried doctoring the recipe, but it is stiff, dense, lacking taste...vanilla and lemon don't do well together.  I would like to warn you that there are much better recipes out there, especially the lemon cake in the Silver Palette Book.

This is my favorite lemon cake.  I've only had it stick to the bundt pan once, but I think it was because I didn't remove it as soon as I was supposed to. The several other times I've made it, it has been fantastic.  Use real lemons for ultimate flavor.

Had no problem with getting this cake out of the pan, but the glazing and then the drizzling of frosting was just way too much sugar. I would recommend leaving off the glaze part and just putting on the final drizzle of frosting.

I printed out this recipe to make the cake for my lemon-loving dad for Father's Day.  Well, this cake is a real lemon.  Don't bother to spend money on the ingredients -- 8 eggs, butter, etc.  After pouring the glaze over the cake in the pan and waiting an hour, the glaze turned into super glue and the cake fell out of the pan in pieces.  I'm in trouble now, because I promised to bring dessert and now at almost 10 pm on a Saturday night, I have to run to the store and get ingredients to make something GOOD!

What an amazing cake!

Not having read any reviews that said they tried this, my husband and I thought the batter was not quite as lemony as we would have liked.  So I added about a 1/3 cup more lemon juice.  The bake time increased by about 5 minutes.  I put the hot lemon glaze on while still in the bundt pan and I don't think I'd do that again next time.  Using 3/4 of the hot glaze was plenty.  I didn't need anymore when I finally got the cake out of the pan.  Next time I think I'd remove it immediately, drizzle all over with the hot glaze using a toothpick to create fine holes throughout to let that glaze soak in evenly.  Then when cooled, finish with the icing.

This is an amazingly lemony and pleasant cake.  It does seem it could get overwhelming with all of the glaze so I think it's ok to use about half of that.  It's an amazingly moist cake so that glaze is just for flavor, not for enhancing the cake.

This wasn't as lemony as I hoped. I followed the recipe completely. I didn't use fresh lemon juice either, I suppose that could help immensely. Aestheticlly speaking I didnt't use a fork I put the frosting in a bag and made swirls.

I ran out of lemon juice, so replaced glaze icing with a cream cheese icing.  OMG,  love this cake.  Moist and lemony.  I waited the 60 min to take out of the pan, only one part fell off,  not bad for my second time.  I will definitely do this one again.

I will never make this again.  The cake stuck to the pan and I am a baker that usually doesn't have this problem.  The cake itself was very dry and the lemon taste was just too much.  Maybe it was just too sugary.  We didn't like how soggy the cake was.  Glad other people liked this.

I don't know why the other reviewers were having problems. IT turned out wonderfully! If you don't like it real lemony then try putting on less frosting or glaze. I love lemon stuff though and it was PERFECT! I was on a bit of a tight schedule so instead of putting it in the fridge for two hours I put it in the freezer for about forty five minuets. It didn't fall part or crumble at all!

it was Ok, but very sweet. I ran out of sugar so I didn't make the frosting. I'm glad I didn't because it was sweet enough as is. Will not make again!

cornbread and lemons don't make for the ultimate cake to me! This recipe was a let-down. The icing was too sweet and the cake was dry and gross and I followed the recipe to a tee.

We enjoyed this cake. I lined the (glass 9x13) pan with parchment paper. I cooked it for 45 minutes at 350. I used juice from fresh lemons and used 4 eggs rather than 8 yolks. I was after well-flavored and not-overly-sweet...so I did not add the second round of glaze. I was well pleased with the results and will make it again. If you don't have a Costco-sized bag of lemons and are shopping just for this recipe, it took me almost 1 & 1/2 fist-sized lemons to get each 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Thanks for the recipe AND for not using artificial lemon flavoring!

I don't usually do reviews but I had to on the cake.  I agree with several of the other reviews...this cake is way too dense.  It has a very good lemon flavor.  I think I will try it again with the suggestions of some of the other reviewers.  I'll use 4 whole eggs instead of 8 yolks.  I will also poke holes in it before pouring on the first glaze.  As far as getting it out of the pan...I use a silicone bundt pan & have no issues whatsoever.   I'm giving this recipe 3 stars for flavor alone.

This cake was excellent! Very lemony, moist. I would serve this to guests! I used fresh sqeezed lemon juice. Instead of using 8 egg whites, I used 4 whole eggs. I followed the rest of the directions perfectly and It came put beautifully!

I rated this on how it sounds and from some of the other reviews.  I haven't tried this recipe but fully intend to because I absolutely  LOVE lemon cakes.  
I would like to know if anyone has ever done this in a 9x13 pan and if so, how it worked.  Thanks.

This is a great recipe - would have given it 5 stars if I had actually made it the same exact way - but I didn't, but came out perfectly. I wanted to make a layered lemon cake in 2-10" pans and one 8", so I used 50% more of each ingredient, and then used cake flour instead of the all purpose and baked for less time - about 20-22 minutes - until toothpick comes out clean.

This cake was awesome! My husband and kids could not get enough of eating it and it didn't last long in our house. Only one of sons was overwhelmed by the lemon, but the cake was still a winner in our home. I HAD to save this one to my recipes list. The cake was moist, not too heavy and fluffy - to sum it up - Dee-licious!

I made this cake just recently as a "tester" for a later cake to come. I didn't have time to frost it. My family ate the whole thing before it even had time to cool!  No icing was necessary, it was beyond delicious plain!

I made this recipe because my husband and father are both huge lemon fans.  I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems.  It definitely has a lot of lemon flavor and got a big thumbs up.

I made the cake according to the recipe, except I used (2.75 cups) cake flour instead of all-purpose, since I find it usually produces a lighter, better textured cake.  I also added a tablespoon of lemon zest.  The cake was done in 50 minutes, so I took it out a little early.  Next time, as others suggested, I will use 4 eggs instead of the 8 yolks.  Also, I will use much less glaze--just too sweet!  However, I had no problems removing it from the pan, and it was nicely textured.  It disappeared quickly, so we liked it fine, but with a few changes, it will be better suited to my family's tastes.

So gooood!! We were craving lemon cake, found this recipe, and cooked it up after dinner. The batter was a winner with my batter-lickers (5-year-old and 2-year-old boys). We'll be making this again!

Sticky sweet lemony.  A bit much with all the glaze and icing.  Might try again, with less of each.

Easy to make, but was a little dry.  Used a chocolate icing instead as John is a chocoholic.  He liked it so must be good.

I was so disappointed in this cake. I removed it from the bundt pan (without any problems) before putting on the lemon glaze. Whoever described the glaze as super glue is right on!! The cake was very dense, heavy & dry.  This is the first failure I've had with any of your recipes, but I'll keep on tryin'!!

This cake came out fluffy and light - and with a great lemon taste.  I used splenda for baking for the sugar - even the confectioners sugar - just put it in the blender until it was powdered!  My husband, the real lemon lover of the family, and my son enjoyed this cake.  I highly recommend it if you like lemon!

This was so-so. In my husband's words, he said it tasted like flour. The cake was very dry, with little pockets of moistness. About the only thing that tasted lemony was the glaze and icing (which were pretty much the same thing, so why the extra step?). I was in need of a sweet fic and this wasn't it.  I won't make this again.

I made this as a surprise for my sister who loves lemon cake. I followed the directions precisely and the cake did everything it was supposed to do. No problem getting it out of the pan. But going by what my sister says, I didn't have any of it, but she said it was too dense. Could be used as a nice lemony boat anchor. (Hey, she said it- not me!)

I don't know what the negative reviews are about either. I don't consider myself a fantastic baker (mediocre at best), but this cake was quite simple to make and turned out flawless! One thing I did, though, was let the cake cool too long in the pan (by accident) and then poured the hot glaze on top. I had no trouble whatsoever removing this moist cake from the pan.

This recipe is very flawed.  The amount of sugar is incorrect - it should be CUPS instead of teaspoons (big difference!).  And, the other reviewer mentioned that the glaze glues the cake to the pan.  It certainly does.  On top of it, the acidity in the lemon effectively cancels out the baking powder and it doesn't rise at all.

I followed asingleguywhocook's advice: added lemon zest and used 4 whole eggs instead of 8 egg whites. The cake cooked up beautifully and was a hit with the extended family at Christmas.

I recommend that you don't allow your cake to sit for as long as the recipe recommend (60min) after pouring the powdered sugar and lemon juice over it. I allowed mine to sit for the time recommended and half of the cake stuck to the pan because of the syrup mixture and if so I would heat it up a bit before turning the cake out the next time. All-in-all the cake was very good.

This cake was really good! If you follow the instructions correctly (beat butter and sugar until fluffy, beat after every egg addition, and your baking powder isn't bad) it isn't terribly dense. It's more dense than a box mix, sure, but not so much that it takes away from the cake.  Most glaze soaked cakes are denser than box mixes so they don't fall apart and turn to mush. 

I removed one star because the glaze at the end was way too thin. It dripped right off the cake. I'd do 1/8c lemon juice to 2c sugar. Maybe even add more sugar.

WOW!!! What a yummy cake! I baked it for 50 minutes, and it was perfectly moist! I added the glaze (cold) right before I served it (didn't read that I was supposed to do it way in advance) and it still tasted yummy! I dusted some powdered sugar on top, and it looked so pretty. My husband even asked me to do this for his 50th birthday!!!! So, yeah everyone LOVED it!

I did not care for this recipe. Something is left out.  It was short, dense, and even broke a birthday candle when it was inserted.
