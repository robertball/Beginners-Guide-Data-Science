Great, easy and tasty topper for your lobster.  I just added a splash of cooking wine and lemon onto the meat before spreading the topping. YUMMY!!

Very easy, quick and simple. BUT, if the folks you cook for (like my wife)are life long fans of "drawn butter" with Lobster, chances are this will not be requested again. I may try this with other types of seafood in the future.

Awesome!!!  I used this over halibut and it was wonderful.  I used 1/2 of the recipe for 4 big fillets and it was perfect.  I put under the broiler to finish for about 5 minutes and it made a wonderful crust.

This is fattening as all heck, but really yummy.  I reduced the mayo some and served with lemon wedges.

For me, this was too rich a sauce for lobster.  I love the light taste of lobster, and this sauce disguised that taste for me.

wow! this was a big hit. I used it on 4 different kinds of seafood, for four people with different tastes in seafood, and it went so well with each choice.try it on scallops, shrimp, salmon, whatever!

Wow. So simple, fast, with ingredients I already have in the fridge. My favorite type of recipe. I loved this. Excellent with a splash of lemon juice added. Very, very good flavor. I had some left over so I spread a thin layer on some crackers and quickly broiled it in my toaster oven. So bad for me (I know), so rich, but SO GOOD. Thanks for sharing this simple recipe!
