These caramel rolls are the best I've ever had. I've probably made them 5 times in the past 2 months. They taste so delicious and are very easy to make. I've always preferred caramel rolls as opposed to cinnamon rolls, and this recipe really is the best I've found!!

These were ok, guess I am more of an icing fan than caramel on rolls. I do love caramel but they didn't ring my bell. Maybe it was the frozen bread thing, there is a big difference. Thanks for the recipe.

Loved these!  I didn't let sit overnight but baked rafter a few minutes.  I used homemade vanilla ice cream and I think that set the flavor over the top.  I will be making these again.

This recipe was really good and easy to make. The rolls were moist and full of flavor. The change I made was not to add all the caramel mixture at once, I saved half of it and spread it on top of the rolls just after I baked them, the result was a fantastic glazing. I left the rolls in the fridge for a day and a half. We really enjoyed having  them with a nice cappuccino.

These were ok. I think putting the caramel on the night before might not be the best idea. Maybe adding it right before putting it in the oven.  But overall this did come out decent.
