Good taste and will make a great icing.  I would add more milk to use it as a drizzle.

did not set up. Even after adding muchmore chocolate, it never got stiffer than cake frosting. I let it freeze,  and it got stiffer, but anything less than frozen and it reverted to a soft, frosting level consistency. I was just using it as a glaze for a Bundt cake, and it was a bit too thin for it.

This was delicious, but it just did not set up for me. I'm still giving this 4 stars, because I may have (possibly) added too much cream while being distracted by the little ones, but I'm not sure if I did or not, lol, so I am not going to fault the recipe. This seems like a pretty standard recipe for ganache, so it should work fine, that's why I think I may have messed up. It still worked out for me because I just used it as an ice cream topping for the kids and they LOVED it (it really is tasty)! I promise, I will try this again and report back. Thanks for sharing. :)
