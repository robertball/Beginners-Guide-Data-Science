I followed the instructions exactly...twice.  Both times the cookies spread out really thin, the edges burnt and the middles were still raw.  The burnt edges stuck to the sheets and the middles crumbled.  I have four cooling racks of oatmeal, chocolate crumble...  What did I do wrong?

This cookie was awesome.  When sampling the dough it seemed as though it was not sweet enough...but don't add more sugar.  Once the cookies baked they were perfect and sweet.  I did add 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/3 tsp of cinnamon.  It added the perfect amount of spice.  When you are baking the cookies don't over bake them.  The centers will look doughy and the very edges will look lighly brown (this took about 10 minutes). Take them out...they are done.  WAIT 2-4 minutes to take off of the tray (this allows the centers to continue cooking slightly).  I found they did not crumble if you turned them upside down on the cooling rack.  Hope you find these tips helpful.

These cookies are insanely fabulous.  I was really dubious of an eggless recipe at first.  But all the awesome reviews prompted me to give it a try.  And boy am I glad I did.  I halved the recipe, and it still turned out perfectly crispy and airy, despite being an oatmeal cookie.  While baking, they smell fantastic.  But be sure to let the cookies sit for 2 minutes after taking them out of the oven though! Or else they'll crumble all over you.  Truth be told though, not all the dough made it into the oven, lots were consumed in a big bowl of chocolate cookie dough ice cream!

Excellent cookies, very easy to make, and everybody loved them!  They baked perfectly for me at 350 for 12 minutes, but are very forgiving - I got busy with my daughter and wasn't able to take the last batch out until nearly 16 minutes, but they were just fine, only a bit crunchier than the others.  

I especially like that these are egg free - my daughter was able to help me make them without me worrying about the raw dough, plus of course they are great for those with allergies.  

For Berbage, who had the trouble with the cookies spreading thin and not baking properly: it sounds as if your butter/margarine was too soft. 

Also I wanted to add that I never put in the extra quarter cup of white sugar. The 3/4 c of brown sugar is plenty of sweetness here, especially if you're adding raisins or chocolate chips.

I have been making this recipe for years and my family and friends all love these cookies.  My recipe calls for flattening the cookies with a fork dipped in cold water before baking.  I think you'll find that it really makes a difference!  (These were originally called Neighbourhood Oatmeal Cookies.)

I've been addicted to Chewy Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies for weeks. I wanted some last night, but was out of eggs. I found this recipe, and let me just say: I'll never go back to my old recipe! These are amazing! I love them!

Try using dried cranberries and white chocolate chips for a nice change of pace.  Also, I omitted the white sugar completely, used 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, plus 1 cup of white flour.  Makes a terrific cookie!

These are so tasty!  If you're looking for a big, thick cakelike cookie, these aren't going to work for you.  I followed the recipe exactly and flattened a bit with a wet fork before baking as suggested.  Do let them cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet before moving them to cool on a rack.  They will most definitely crumble/mush if you try to move them too soon.  I only cooked mine for 10 min. and it was perfect for them.    They cook a tad more as they sit on the sheet waiting to be transferred.  Thanks for this great egg-free recipe!

I made these cookies for my son's valentines party at school.  Some of the kids are allergic to nuts, eggs or milk.  And the cookies were so good I made another batch for my family!

I have made this recipe countless times.  Each time I make it I am astounded at what a good cookie this makes.  They are light, crunchy and perfectly shaped.  I highly recommend this one!  I have substituted margarine for butter.  I use one cup of turbinado (evaporated cane juice) sugar instead of white and brown sugar.  
The cookie should be slightly flattened before baked and need a bit longer to cook than the traditional cookie.  This is, by far, the BEST cookie recipe I've ever tasted.

I didn't have enough butter, so I mushed up a banana [not sure if that's a thing people use to substitute, but whatever]. AMAZING. Banana, oatmeal, chocolate chip, raisin cookies are flipping FANTASTIC! Stuff a banana in your cookies today!

If you like your oatmeal cookies not too sweet, light, tender, lacy and crispy around the edges this is the cookie for you.  My family LOVED them. If you prefer a dense, rich, chewy cookie I'd suggest choosing another recipe.  I followed the instructions exactly except for adding 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and a bit more vanilla. I skipped the raisins and used dried cherries. The cherry/chocolate combo was amazing. They were very quick to stir together. A portable mixer worked well until the end, then I hand-stirred in the oatmeal and chips.  I used a 1 tablespoon cookie scoop, baked them 9 minutes, and let sit undisturbed in the pan until almost cool (resist temptation to remove them while warm or they will tear). It made 40 cookies.   I'll definately make this one again!

This recipe is awesome!  I added dried cranberries instead of raisins, and my husband was blown away.  No eggs and a butter base make these little delights thin and crispy!  These are going on my permanent rotation.

These were awesome. Use butter! To evenly bake, I used parchment paper, decreased heat to 325, flattened them a bit before baking, and kept an eye on them after the 8 minute mark.  Everyone loved them.  As stated before, no one could tell the difference w/o eggs.  The batter itself is yummy and I was able to let my kids lick the beaters since there are no eggs.  Crisp and chewy.  Will definitely make these again!

This is an AWESOME recipe.  I hardly had them out of the oven, and the kids were all over them.  My husband who is not wild about oatmeal cookies loved them.  This is a keeper for sure.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!   :-)

SOOOO GOOD! I think I've eaten 10 so far today!   I had to add 3/4 cup more flour though so they didn't flatten out like other reviews said. And I reduced cooking time to 9 minutes & it was perfect!  I don't like rasins in cookies, so I just added 2 cups of chocolate chips. Super yummy recipe! Thanks!

What an incredible recipe.  As a cookie dough fanatic, I loved that this recipe didn't have the raw eggs! Alot safer and the kids still get to lick the beaters. I didn't change a thing with this recipe for my first batch - the second time around I refrigerated the dough before cooking which helped to make the cookies thicker. Also - make sure to let the cookies sit on the cookie sheet a couple of minutes before taking them off. This will prevent the "crumble factor." Loved these!!! Will make these again!

Excellent recipe! I followed the recipe almost exactly - I just added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and used all brown sugar (had no white). I would probably cut the salt in half next time though as I found them to be slightly salty to the taste. Before putting them in the oven I flattened them slightly, and once baked, I left them to cool on the cookie sheets before removing them (otherwise they would've fallen apart on me).

Followed the instructions exactly and these were perfect.  Crumbly if you don't wait long enough for them to cool or overcook... wait 10 minutes for cooling as per the instructions.  I used butter from the fridge and grated it into the sugar.

Wow!  I think this is my new favorite cookie.  I wasn't thinking and added the choc chips after adding the boiling water and baking soda.  Can you say - turtle oatmeal choc chip cookies?!

Yummy! My only comment is that I tried to bake two trays at the same time. The tray on the bottom rack turned out perfect, but the tray on the top rack turned out a little crumbly (as some others seem to have experienced). Baking the rest on the bottom rack only.

This is a great recipe. I used craisins. I did flattened the cookies a bit as some suggested. And if you make sure your butter is room temperature and NOT melted when mixing up then the cookies should not spread. 
Thank you. It's a KEEPER!

Delicious!!!  Took the advice of leaving them on the cookie sheet for 2-3 minutes after taking them out of the oven and had no problems with the cookies falling apart.

I was looking for an eggless recipe since we didn't have any eggs. I used 1 1/2 cup old fashioned oats (had no quick oats either) & a little extra water. They still turned out GREAT. We all went for seconds.

These are divine! Having never dissolved baking soda into boiling water, I was a bit confused as to whether or not it went into the flour/sugar mixture or if the oats and chocolate chips went into baking soda mixture. Figured out it was it was the former and made perfect cookies. I made these gluten free using gluten free oats, gluten free vanilla and fancy chocolate. Nom.

These were great. I subbed butter for vegan margarine and dried cranberries instead of raisins. I also added some walnuts. Beware the cooking time- They really do only need 10 minutes, as will firm up outside the oven.

I've made these a couple times and once they were perfect, the rest of the time they were tasty but crumbly. I'm usually good with cookies but I can't seem to get consistent results with this recipe.

This is a fantastic cookie recipe! It's easy, fast, and yummy. As with most baking I do, I almost double the amount of vanilla extract and salt.   The only con for this recipe is there's no eggs - which means I have no reservations eating the uncooked dough!

Over all a good recipe
I added a teaspoon of cinnamon; I did the fork thing that was suggested.  My only complaint is the first batch stuck. I put the rest on parchment paper. I also did a table spoon instead

Excellent cookie recipe that I will definitely use again.  I have deadly allergies to eggs, so this one is a winner in my books.  I did substitute milk and white chocolate chips for the semi-sweet as that is what I had.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used a cold fork to press down on the top of the cookies before they baked.  My one and only complaint was that you should definitely not drop it by the "teaspoonfuls"...I used a tbsp for a measurement and the cookies were a little on the small side (or maybe I am just extra greedy!).  As well, recipe made 48 cookies instead of 24.  Next time will use larger spoonfuls of dough.

Easy to make and delicious! Made recipe for six cookies. Used Smart Balance instead of butter. Added 1/4 tspn. of ground cloves, 1/4 tspn. nutmeg, used raisins, and sprinkled cinnamon on top before putting in oven. Next time may double the vanilla and add more nutmeg and ground cloves, and use fewer chocolate chips. Only reason this recipe isn't a 5 for me is because it can use some more spice and possibly fewer chocolate chips...but it sure will be fun to experiment with it! :-)

These make really yummy oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, and they took no time to prep at all. 

I would recommend using a non-stick pan or slightly spraying the pan before dropping the cookies on it, because the cookies were so soft and crumbly (just the way I like them!) that it was hard to get them off the pan in one piece.

My absolute favourite cookie!!  They remind me of cookies I used to get at high school.  Whole family loves them.  I put in chocolate chips instead of raisins.  It is also great that there are no eggs in the recipe because of allergies in our home.  Thanks a lot!!

Excellent, especially as I have discovered that I'm allergic to eggs.
I used all regular sugar, reduced the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup, and cooked for about 14/15 minutes.
I'm gonna try dried cherries next time, instead of raisins and chocolate chips

Wonderful!  I omitted the raisins and used one whole bag of mini chocolate chips.  Next time, I would use half a bag.  I wonder why the baking soda is dissolved in boiling water?  Curious.  The cookies turned out lovely.  I used a 1-tbsp scoop and got about 5 dozen cookies.  I'll make them again!

Very good flavor. I like that there are no eggs, so I feel free to snack on the batter, which is so yummy! A little difficult to stick together, but end result is a little crunchy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside!

Pretty good. I decreased the butter to 3/4 cup because I didn't want them to be too soft. I didn't use raisins (too many flavors; wanted just chocolate and oatmeal). Maybe next time I will use dried cranberries in place of the raisins. Decreased white sugar by 1TBSP. And the 1-1/2 cups of chocolate chips were just a little shy of a 12-oz. bag. Anyway, even with my alterations, it turned out well. I think you could use old-fashioned oats, though I did have the quick-cooking on hand. Before putting these on the cookie sheet, I packed the dough into balls so the cookies would be solid. With my alterations, the cookies spread just a little. My husband likes these a lot so I'll probably make these again.

What a pleasant surprise! Great flavor. I worried they would not flatten when baked and remain "haystacks". But no problem. I nice looking well rounded cookie. The kids were even happier, "Mom! We can eat the batter because there are no eggs in it!" -- I also liked the fact that this recipe did not get "stale" after a few days the way other homemade cookies do. Their taste remained consistent until they were completely gone.

Excellent recipe, if done correctly. I have to refrigerate the dough before baking in order to prevent the cookies from spreading too much and going flat after they're cooked. If it's refrigerated for like 20 mins first though... these cookies come out puffy and light and delicious. Left some uncovered on the counter overnight by accident, and found them still soft and delicious the next morning. 

I usually pull mine from the oven a minute or so before they're done and let them finish on the heat from the cookie sheet. Everyone I've shared these cookies with has said they're amazing and possibly the best oatmeal cookies they've ever tried!

Many thanks for the recipe. :)

Awesome cookie recipe. I rolled the dough into balls before placing them on the baking sheet and the cookies were thick and soft. I also used 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips and 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips which was a nice variation. Will certainly make again! (might try substituting a bit of coconut for oatmeal next batch)

This recipes was amazing.  The first time I did them they turned out Perfect.  Nice and fluffy and yummy.  Even a good friend of mine came over and requested the recipe.  The key really is to not over bake them.  So GOOD!

Excellent cookie. I had to make modifications due to what limited supplies I had on hand. I think it probably made the cookie, "healthier," if there is such a thing. Instead of the butter, I used cold refined coconut oil. It whipped up very nicely with the sugars. I only had whole wheat pastry flour, and old fashioned oats (not quick cooking). Also, I omitted raisins and added a half cup of finely chopped pecans. I hand-formed each 1-tsp cookie into a tight ball and baked for 9 min. After cooling~5 min the cookie was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. This recipe will be a keeper- thanks!

AWESOME recipe.  I added a little  flax seeds and mixed some cranberries in  with the raisins... no one complained!!!
I used gluten free all purpose flour to accomodate an allergy in our house and had no no issues. (used same amount of 1 1/2 cups).  
I did see the review about being thin, so I sprinkled a little extra flour (maybe a tablespoon)as it was looking a little wet when all mixed.

Was out of eggs so gave this recipe a shot. I'm glad I did!!! They are so good!!!! Didn't change anything in the recipe at all. They came out crispy around the edges and soft in the middle. This recipe is a keeper!

this was a great oatmeal cookie recipe, I did add a twist to it though, I didn't use plain quick oats.  I used quaker banana & cream oatmeal instead.  Awesome!  Just a hint of banana with the oatmeal and chocolate chips.  Try it!

These cookies are perfect! And no eggs in them, so you can indulge yourself a little and eat some dough while no one is watching ;-) I've made them twice now and each time was wonderful! Give them a try...they are SUPER easy!

Good eggless cookie, but mine turned out a little bitter. May use 3/4 tsp. of baking soda if I make again.

These tasted good but they spread out when they cooked and were very thin and completly flat.  Other then subbing cranberries for raisins I followed the recipe exactly.  I froze 3/4 of the dough into "balls" hopefully these turn out better when I cook them...Update: they are still completly flat but I've discovered I'm completly addicted to these anyway.  I love the cran, chocolate, oatmeal combo.

Love these cookies! I like to add a little cinnamon and sliced nuts to it, but otherwise I follow the recipe as is. My roommates and I always end up eating a good chunk of the cookie dough while we're waiting for the first batch of cookies to bake.

so delicious. Not too oatmeal-y. Husband who doesn't like oatmeal cookies, likes these because you can't tell there is oatmeal in them (but I think it cuts the sweetness and adds health benefits). The only small complaint is that the batter tends to be pretty dry and therefore, difficult to get on cookie sheet in anything better than clumps that you form together with your hand. And mine didn't fall, just stayed big clumps. Delicious nonetheless!

My cookies came out very flat and burnt around the edges the first time around (could be my oven). I had to reduce the cooking time for the second round. They were flat, but good!

These were amazing. My family loved them, and they were the perfect solution to a no-eggs crisis. The only thing I did differently was instead of using all semi sweet chocolate chips I used 1/2 cup each of milk, semisweet, and white chocolate chips.

Freakin awsome. It's funny because the whole day I was desperately craving something sweet, but I didn't have any eggs. I couldn't find any good recipes so I just gave up. Then I stumbled across these and just freaked out when I realized that there weren't any eggs in them. That was also a plus because then I could eat the cookie dough without the fear of dropping dead from salmonella. The cookie dough was soo good!! I actually like it better than the baked cookies. I left out the raisins which were fine and just used the chocolate chips. Next time I think that I might decrease the amount of chips because I thought they were a bit much. Also, they didn't seem done so I increased the baking time which was definitely the right choice.

This recipe was simple and DELICIOUS!  I cooked them 10 minutes and they came out chewy and stayed together well.  I skipped the step where you dissolved the baking soda in water and added it directly to the batter and they did fine.  I will definitely make these cookies again!  Oh, and the raw batter is safe and delicious to eat as well.

These did turn out pretty fluffy like a normal cookie, but I think they tasted a little more bland, not sweet enough to be called a dessert.  I only baked one batch yesterday when I made the dough and will add more white sugar before I bake the next. It would probably be better to add equal parts brown & white sugars.  The nice thing about this recipe, is that you can eat the dough without the fear of getting salmonella, however, I still prefer the recipes WITH egg.

First of all...no eggs means this is a cookie dough thats safe to eat!!! These are great cookies.  I have made them twice now and planned to make them a regular thing.  I love the chocolate chips and raisins together.  If you are looking for a spicy oatmeal cookie this isn't it.  If you are looking for a yummy treat...this IS it.

this is a fabulous recipe!  along with the chocolate chips, i add craisins instead of raisins and make them on the smaller side, flat, and crispy...less guilt for eating several at a time!  these are hands down probably the best cookies ever!  i make them all the time and they're always a hit (and gone way too quickly).

Awesome cookie recipe.  Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  I let them cool about 5 minutes on baking sheet and they 'finished' baking nicely.  Will definitely keep this recipe!

These cookies were absolutely, unbelievably the best oatmeal cookies i have ever had...and i am not a huge fan of oatmeal cookies! I will make these again and again. I feel bad for the person who said hers never turned out right. I did notice that when i took mine out, they looked undercooked, but after i let them rest on the baking sheet for a few minutes they relaxed and only them did i transfer them to the cooking rack. Mine did indeed get a little brown around the edges but they were perfect...just follow the recipe to a T and they will come out fine! I left mine for 12 mins and they were perfect!!! mmmmmmmm!!!!

Tasty!  I looked up egg free for my newly allergic sister in law.  This seemed odd to just add hot water, but it worked.  I used 1/2 cup butter, 3/4 flaxmeal, only 1/2 cup brown sugar, oat flour for regular, dark chocolate chips and left out the raisins.  They could be crumbly, mine stayed together ok.  I think the whole cup of butter would make these perfect, but had to sub for health reasons.  Very good, I am sending some of them with the recipe to my sister in law!

Hmmmm.... I'm not sure how I feel about these cookies. The first couple of batches of mine got overdone at 10 minutes, and I used more than a teaspoon of dough. They're pretty crispy and do fall apart easily. I left mine on the baking sheet for a couple of minutes before trying to transfer them to the cooling rack. Overall, I don't think I would make these again. They just didn't turn out as well as I thought.

I made these last week and sent a dozen over to my neighbor.  These are so good!  She called me within 10 minutes to see if I had any more.  Of course we had already eaten the rest (no self-control here).  She asked when I was going to make more and I told her I was out of chocolate chips and oatmeal.  Yesterday I found oatmeal and chocolate chips by my front door...
I made these without raisins and used a combination of milk chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I also used closer to 3 or 3 1/2 cups of chips. This is my new favorite cookie!

I just changed my review.  Initially my cookies were a horrible crumbly mess.  I let them cool for about an hour and tried to pick them up and they just fell apart.  I gave up on them and came back about 3 hours later and the texture totally changed (and now so is my rating).  These are fantastic but you MUST let them cool a long time.  Also DO NOT OVERCOOK-even a little.  Definitely better to error on the side of them being too raw otherwise no matter how long you let them sit they will fall apart when you pick them up.  The flavor is great. Pleasantly surpised.  I'll make them again...now.

This recipe makes a very chewy, flat cookie. I dislike the way they look, but I have constant requests from my office to bring them in. They have good flavor, but get no points for appearance.

This is the best cookie recipe I have ever made. I am still in awe by how good these cookies are. They are the perfect texture -- not too oatmealy -- and perfectly chewy and crispy, with just the right amount of chocolate chips. Yes, these are perfect cookies! I didn't change a thing in the recipe and they turned out wonderfully.

Delicious when first made.  After cooling and storing in air-tight container overnight they were very dry the next day.  Crumbly.

For a cookie generally, they were very good. For an eggfree cookie, they were excellent.  I will continue to make for them for my egg-allergic niece. The best part is getting to eat the egg-free batter without worry!

OMG, is this the best cookie or what?  Made these with a bag of mini choc chips and 1 cup of raisins (soaked in hot water and 1/2 tsp of vanilla for 30 minutes)If you like a sweet gooey cookie this is it.  Stayed soft in a ziplock bag til they were gone.  This is the best I've ever had.

Very nice, but a little too sweet for my taste. Next time, I will reduce the amount of sugar. Because there are no eggs, this makes a fabulous uncooked addition to vanilla ice-cream!! Absolutely divine!

These weren't bad but not the best, be sure to add 1 tsp of vanilla and reduce the sugar and choc chips or they will be gooey and tooth aching sweet.

All I can say is WOW! These cookies turned out great. I used margarine instead of butter and didn't put any raisins in. I had to leave the dough in the refrigerator over night but just put a little hot water in the dough and used a spoon to mix and the dough was perfect. Came out great they were all gone in no time. I will definatly use this recipe again

Very good, I subbed in non-hydrogenated margarine for butter and decreased it to 3/4 of a cup.  Very good cookie.  

Just as a PSA though, just because there are no eggs doesn't mean it's safe to eat the raw batter.  All of the danger in raw eggs comes from contamination by the shell.  You are just as exposed if you touch an egg shell and don't wash your hands as you are if you eat a whole raw egg.  The dangerous part in raw cookie dough is the raw flour, which can contain worms.  

Great cookie though!

Great cookies recipe. I am pregnant and I felt like eating cookie dough. Because there is no eggs in that recipe, there was no risk for salmonella...so it was perfect!!!
I'll make that again for sure :)

These cookies are wonderful! I found this because I was out of eggs and my husband wanted cookies. I also took some to work, and they can't wait for me to make more! I will double the recipe next time, and I added chocolate chunks instead of chips. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was a real Christmas present to our family! My 8yr. old daughter is deathly allergic to eggs, and never enjoys eggless cookies.  We found this recipe on Christmas day, had a blast making them, and then the whole family enjoyed them while playing a board game. Thank you, Janie,
you made our day!!

These cookies are great!
I used 2cups of choc chips rather than the raisins, and they were awesome.
After reading the reviews, I made the cookies larger than recommended and they were great.
I will definitely use this recipe again.
They are very sweet so next time I will omit the white sugar.

The recipe is very easy to follow and have come out perfect each time. I have tried the recipe with butter, half butter and half margarine and they were still great.  I even tried using the golden raisins and dried cranberry.  Very tasty additions.

I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour and they turned out great!
A definite keeper!

Added cinnamon and nutmeg per others' suggestions. Omitted cc's and raisins to keep them simple for my kiddo's class party. So good! Because I skipped the add-ins, there wasn't that extra sweetness to balance out the salty... so I might reduce the salt juuuust a tad next time. Great, simple recipe. Cooked 10 min and left on tray for 4 min before removing per suggestions from "most helpful review." Thank you for that! They were perfect.

Tastes great. Have made it twice now, two different ovens. Once by hand and once with Kitchenaid. It falls to pieces. 
Not worth the cost or time. Needs EGG or SOME binder. Just not a good recipe.

Very good, followed recipe exactly but didn't use raisins. I softened my butter in the microwave on the second lowest setting for about 2 minutes, making sure it wasn't melting. Will make these again.

DELICIOUS!!! Fabulously crispy and not greasy at all. Ten minutes is perfect and do NOT flatten. They flatten themselves out just fine. I didn't realize they didn't call for eggs until the batter was made and I was extremely NERVOUS but these are truly wonderful. I think I like them better than my Mom's old recipe from the 60's and that is saying a lot. My daughter and I did half butterscotch, half semi-sweet chips and we are in heaven! We will definitely make them again

I am cooking these now and following suggestions about waiting 2 min to remove from sheet. They came out well & I added a little more water than called for because the dough was too dry. As one of the reviewers mention that they were crumbly you have to use your judgement & not follow a recipe blindly it's ok to add more of an ingredient if necessary. I was not a fan of store bought oatmeal cookies but these are really good.

Actually really good and I did not miss the egg. I was already knee-deep in the recipe before I realized it was eggless. Anyway, I added a little cinnamon (like I saw suggested here), and took them out at 12 min exactly, then let them sit on the sheet for a couple min. I found out quickly they fall through the cooling rack, so I took my batches off the sheet while they were still on the parchment paper. I just plopped the parchment paper right on the cooling rack and they cooled nicely. 
I used Earth Balance margarine and added a little extra rolled oats.

Best recipe yet! Followed instructions to a T. Baked for 11 mins, and made sure not to overcook. Followed another reviewer and added a little nutmeg and Cinnamon to the batter. Husband is very picky and he loved these.

The best oatmeal cookie recipe that I've ever tried and I've tried many!  These are thin and chewy but hold not brittle.  They taste of oatmeal and chocolate, not flour.  They are heavenly! I will also try this recipe with raison as I loved the consistency.  I used parchment paper and baked them for 11 minutes then let them cool on cookie sheet for about 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack.  They were perfect and  a huge hit with my husband and his 2 college aged kids.

Satisfied my late night sugar craving. Super easy to make. Perfect salt/sweet balance and texture. Definitely make again with nut/chip/raisin variations.
Thank you for an amazing eggless recipe!

This was a highly reviewed recipe so I decided without reading 1-Star reviewers that I would make it myself. It turned out to be quite salty as well as very dry. In my opinion you don’t need to use any extra salt if you’re already using salted butter. If it’s unsalted butter go ahead. But the oats are also a bit much. I would say probably 2 rob 2-1/2 cups of oats

really good.  in the ingredient list it says quick cooking oats and in the directions it says rolled oats.  I used quick cooking and they turned out well.  My butter was softened to room temperature and I also substituted chopped up dried cherries for the raisins.  will make these again for sure

No eggs scared me a bit... but it turned out great. Chewy, soft, delicious. Be warned that they don't look done and they're overly soft when first out of the oven, but the firm up and darken a bit as they cool (even on a cooling rack).

While tasty, I had problems similar to some of the other reviews I read, biggest one being crumbly and uneven in shape, despite using a cookie scoop. Flavour was good, but I'll keep looking.

Very good recipe! I made these for my daughter that has dairy and egg allergies. Instead of butter, I used earth balance, it's like dairy free margarine. For chocolate chips I used Enjoy Life brand.  The result was a fat cookie, crisp on the outside and chewy inside.

Excellent cookies. I left out the white sugar, as other reviewers suggested, and also the salt, and I didn't miss them. I used two thirds white flour and one third whole wheat, along with a spoonful or two of ground flax seed. Next time I will probably just use 1 cup of chocolate chips and perhaps reduce the butter too. I ended up adding a little extra flour, and also some almond meal, to soak up the excess butter in the dough. They cooked perfectly in ten minutes.

I needed to make cookies for an event, but eggs are really expensive right now ($4 a dozen, usual price is under $1 a dozen) and I didn't want to buy a dozen just to make cookies. This recipe came in really handy because it does not require eggs. I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out great. They are soft and chewy. I'll definitely make this again.

I also was reluctant to make cookies without eggs, but I wanted to try something different.  I made this exactly as written except that after I had the dough mixed together, I had an emergency phone call.  I covered the dough with Saran wrap, and stuck in the fridge.  Several hours later and the emergency passed (trip to the ER for a fractured wrist of a friend), the dough was pretty solid.  I rolled them in about 1 inch balls, and they baked beautifully!  Keeper for sure.

Very good cookie! I was surprised there were no eggs in the recipe, but after baking them I found them to come together quite nicely. My husbands favorite type of cookie and he gave it a 4.5 out of 5.

Love this recipe and struggle to get the cookies in the oven before I eat all the dough! I’ve made it a few times with using a 3:1 ratio of baking powder to baking soda and I like the texture of the bakin powder cookies a little bit more. Regardless, great recipe!

These were by far the best Oatmeal Cookies I have ever made!
I see most reviews state that they come out thin and crispy which was not the case with mine. I followed the recipe only changing the sugar to Organic unprocessed sugar. I measured the dough with a heaping tablespoon and they came out light and fluffy. These are amazing! I'm hiding these in the freezer before my husband gets home or they will be gone by the end of the day! These are a keeper!

Easy to follow and the bake was very consistent! I used only 3/4 cup of sugar and it was a more subtle sweetness, which I preferred since I was adding chocolate chips. However, I felt that the cookies needed more salt. I used unsalted butter and a 1/2 tsp and it was not nearly enough. Next time I will try 1 tsp and also add a tsp of cinnamon!

I gave this the full whack! I normally don't make these silly reviews but these cookies were scrumptious!  Even my cat liked them (and Mr Whiskersons is hard to please!) Top notch! I would recommend you get your grandchildren to cook them for you. (Although I did have to go to the bathroom a bit more afterwards)

This is a fantastic recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with really great cookies. At some point, I added 1/3 tsp of cinnamon, and I also used 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips + 1/2 a cup of white chocolate chips instead of only using chocolate. I baked the cookies for approximately 14 minutes (after misreading the recipe and thinking that I had to bake them at 325 degrees instead of 350). Despite the mix-up, the cookies came out perfectly chewy in the middle and crispy on the edges.

These cookies aren't bad, but they aren't my favorite.  Baking is kind of tricky, maybe because they don't have any eggs.  I don't think I'll make them again.

A great cookie.  Easy to make, a soft cookie, not hard   Everyone I take these cookies to, love them.   I make them with vegan chocolate chips, because I have several friends who are vegan or partially vegan.  They love them.    Cook them only for the time specified, do not over cook.  Cool completely.  Can be placed in bags and frozen for later -- but they usually do not last that long.

Thank you for this recipe! I had to change ingredients due to the fact we didn't have everything I needed.  I used all brown sugar because we were out of white, I had to substitute maple syrup for vanilla because we were out of it, and had to substitute baking powder for baking soda (2 for 1) because we were out of it. And, they turned out great. 12 -14 minutes and 2-4 minutes on the pan after (no more than that or they start to get hard). Tasted great despite all the subs.

I was a bit skeptical because of the absence of egg, but my daughter really wanted to bake something with her friend and we didn't have any.  Turned out really well -- maybe a teeny bit doughy in the center, but they really spread out thin, so it's not an issue.  Baked for exactly 12 minutes and they were perfect, except when I made the cookies too big - which I won't do again - and then it took 14.  (Bonus:  things are easier to clean up without all the "egg glue.")

I was looking for a good egg-free cookie recipe for my son who has allergies and I couldn't let his childhood pass without being able to enjoy homeade cookies. I came across this gem and whether you're allergic to eggs or not, these are the best tasting cookies I've ever had. I am a very picky cookie eater and these were soft, sweet and rich. I used the 2 sticks of butter straight from the fridge and chopped it up into pieces in the bowl. Then, I massaged it with my hands into the sugar mixture, then added the vanilla. It helped it thaw just enough to be creamy. I skipped the raisins but used the oatmeal... and the oatmeal makes it taste more than just sugary but gives it some sustenance. 5 stars all the way.

Brought these to work-2 people asked me for the recipe and many compliments from others! I accidentally melted my butter, but still came out great! I ran out of eggs and needed to bring cookies, so this was the recipe for me! I didn't use the water since my butter was somewhat melted and it worked great.

This cookie is amazing!  The first time I tried it I had the problem with becoming very thin and falling apart.  This time put the cookie sheet in the refrigerator (with cookie rounds on it) for about 5-10 minutes and then flattened than with a fork.  They came out perfect!

I am amazed at how good these cookies turned out I was a bit skeptical as the cookies didn't call for eggs but they truly turned out so soft and chewy at the same time I will be making these again!!

I have been making these cookies for a few years. They are now our go-to favorites. The recipe is perfect; I wouldn't change a thing. They are beyond delicious! They are fairly easy to make; and they don't take that long to bake. I would HIGHLY recommend this recipe. Yum!

Left out the raisins and followed the directions and measurements exactly. Baked for 10 minutes until edges were slightly brown and let cool on the pan for about 10 minutes while the next pan baked before removing to a cooling rack. DELISH!  I'll be making these again for sure!

Excellent!  We didn't have any eggs, but my husband was craving cookies, so I gave these a try.  Delicious!  We also didn't have butter, so I used coconut oil.  Also didn't have chocolate chips, so I just used 1 1/2 c of raisins.  Even with all the changes, they were still wonderful, and getting to eat the raw dough was an extra special treat!

Fantastic cookies. Took a couple minutes longer to cook than specified, but turned out very nice. Note that they'll still be very soft when complete, but will harden in a couple minutes. My younger brother raved and raved about these cookies. He had them fresh out of the oven and said they were the best he has ever had, but it was likely because they just came out of the oven. He had some the next day and said they were still the best cookie he has ever eaten.

As written, I am sure this is a five star recipe.  I made a few changes to cater to my family's tastes.  I increased the salt to 1 tsp., reduced the chocolate chips to 1 cup, omitted the raisins, and added 1 cup of chopped walnuts.  I have made dozens of recipes of chocolate chip oatmeal cookies.  This is the one I will make from now onl

I am allergic to eggs so when I saw this I was really excited. I followed the directions as written and did not add raisins. They are so good! Make sure you wait a couple of minutes after you take them out to move them. They will fall apart if you don't.  That's not a big deal. I love them and thanks for sharing!!!

I made this recipe gluten free using gluten free all purpose baking mix by adding enough of the mix until it gets to the normal dough texture you are used to. It made the cookies soft, thick and delicious!

I like this recipe, but it hardens  quickly. To remedy that I put them in the microwave for 25seconds and they turn chewy all over again. Very yummy.

Delicious cookies that I was able to whip together in a pinch without eggs. I like my cookies crisp on the outside and gooey in the middle, and these were perfectly that. They were a bit more undone in the middle than most probably like though, so keep that in mind! I plan to make these again and again though!

The cookies were great, the preparation was amazing. The only thing that I'm not to crazy about this cookies are that I find them extremely dry. But they're amazing with a glass of milk or tea. The cookies did not crumble. I let them cool for about 7 minutes before I transferred them into a container

There are several vegans in my family, and these cookies are perfect for them. I replace the butter with Earth Balance vegan buttery sticks (which are great for baking), and I use several different ingredients instead of chocolate chips, depending on how the mood strikes. I use craisins, cinnamon chips, sometimes even dried fruit. Even my non-vegan friends and family members love these cookies when I make them.

This is my go-to recipe for fast cookies. Everyone is addicted to them around the holidays. My only issue is that I've gotten a wide variability in how thick they come out. Maybe chilling the dough between cookie sheets would fix this. Thanks! Delicious!

I made them as written and the cookies are delicious! Keep an eye out at about 8 minutes to make sure to remove when they begin to brown a bit. Our family thinks they taste best when just barely brown, and after they have been cooled and refrigerated. A new favorite recipe!

Just made these and I love them!  Had no eggs but needed cookies for hubby's lunch. So glad I found them!  I left out the 1/4 cup white sugar and only used chocolate chips.  Awesome!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made this recipe twice now and love it!  I use coconut oil instead of butter and it gives them a yummy, light macaroon-like flavour.. I also followed an earlier note and added a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon.  Took them to a baby shower and everyone was asking me for the recipe!

I have an egg-allergic 5 year old daughter who absolutely loves these cookies! Egg free cookies tend to be hard and dry, but these are perfect! I am thrilled to add another cookie recipe to my egg free collection! We live above 6000 ft so to added an additional 1/4 cup of flour to accommodate our high altitude and these baked nicely. I baked for 12 minuets and then let them sit on the pan for another 5 mins or so. After cooling they are chewy and delicious!

Note to self: do not try a new recipe when cooking with kids. These are kind of lousy and my daughter is disappointed.

EDIT:  My apologies, I just realized my oven thermostat is messed up and the temperature was way too high.  Once I got the temperature regulated they were better, though still a bit drier than I like.  I also flattened the dough balls a bit after the first batch (thanks for the tip from one of the reviewers!), and we used walnuts in place of the raisins.  I upped the stars to 3.  I still like the classic chewy ones better!  As for my daughter, she still thinks the raw dough tastes best.

Great recipe for when you're out of eggs. Soft and crunchy at the same time. I used craisins instead of raisins and they were excellent.

Great base recipie for eggless oatmeal cookies!! Personally I didn't need as much sugar so only used a half cup brown, & used half butter half coconut oil. Cookies came out with a great texture and flavor and fall owing one users review to let finish on pan before transfer & voila!

Absolutely LOVED these cookies!!!! I used white chocolate chips and it was unbelievable. Try not to overcook them. When you take them out of the oven they look like they aren't done, but let them cool. Totally amazing!

I have tried several cookie recipes without egg because my son has an egg allergy. This is the first one that stayed moist, didn't fall apart, didn't require a bunch of obscure ingredients, and was delicious! Even my skeptical husband loved them. They were very easy and I can't wait to make them again!

For eggless, this is so good, texture-wise and taste-wise. Crumblier than the one with eggs, thick, chewy with enough crispiness on the outside. I used bread flour and it added to the chewiness. Also added 1 tsp cinnamon powder and they turned rustic and beautiful.
I will make this again, maybe add more butter to make it spread thinner.
Thank you for the recipe.

Tried this recipe, because I didn't have any eggs in the house and wanted to make cookies.  I omitted the raisins.  Baked them for 12 minutes, then let them sit on the pan, on a rack for about 6 minutes, then moved them to cooling rack.  Great recipe!  I will make these again.  Next time, I will try raisins or craisins, or maybe some pecans or walnuts.  I didn't have any problem with the cookies spreading too thin.

I have made these cookies a few times now and they are a huge hit every time.  I had been looking for a good eggless chocolate chip cookie recipe and this is it!   We don't like excessively sweet and/or chewy cookies, so this recipe is perfect for us.  The cookies are crunchy and not too sweet.    I used only one cup of chocolate chips instead of one and a half, and left out the white sugar completely.  Also reduced the butter by 2-3 tablespoons and they still turned out great.  When I took them out of the oven it looked like they weren't completely done, but after letting them cool down a little bit, they were perfect.

We love moist and chewy cookies, and these delivered. I was a tad upset finding out we had no eggs after I had beat a cup of butter in with all my sugar. Looked up an eggless recipe. Crisis averted! These cookies came out moist, chewy and delish.

This recipe is awesome, thank you!! Cookies turned out very well. I used clarified butter (3/4 cup). The first batch turned out crispy, so I watched the cookies very closely when the second batch was baking and got them out as soon they looked light brown.

Delicious. I used dark chocolate chips and added craisins.   To remedy the too soft butter, I put the mix in the refrigerator for 20 minutes before I baked them..Great recipe. Can't wait for my husband to come home and try.

This is the best chocolate chip cookie ever! Who needs eggs?! 
Even though I love chocolate I would reduce the amount in half and if you add some pecans or walnuts that would be heaven!

I found this for my son's daycare to make on our cookie Friday. They turned about great - easy to make and I love the no egg, as sometime I just don't have them on hand.  I did read through the suggestions and we flattened the cookies with a fork.  My husband loved them - even with oatmeal :)

These cookies are so yummy. The dough felt a little loose after all the prep (could be the 80 degree weather out here), so it went into the refrigerator for 15 minutes and that made handling easier. Also instead of dropping the dough with a spoon we rolled them up softly into 1 inch  balls. This might help to mitigate the crumbling troubles some reviewers have reported. Baked it for 12 minutes and it came perfect.

I am so glad I tried this recipe.. I am allergic to eggs so love being able to have a great egg free recipe.  I used Pamelas Gluten free bread flour since my hubby is celiac.  The cookies turned out chewy and delicious!
The addition of the bolling water to the soda works wonders with the gluten free flour.

Of course, everyone ate these, but with sugar, butter, and choc chips, what do you expect? Good thing to make if you are out of eggs and still want to throw some cookies together. These are a crispier cookie and if you want a really moist chocolate chip cookie, you may be disappointed with this recipe.

I made these cookies tonight because i needed a new cookie to bake on my regular day off, so i decided to go for my second favorite cookie, and this was a hit in my house, my wife and her friend thought they were awesome, and they don't normally eat oatmeal chocolate chip.  This is going in my recipe box as a quick cookie when friends and family come over.

Finally, a chocolate chip recipe I can use for my highly allergic granddaughter that actually tastes great.  Used Earth Balance margarine (no dairy) and Enjoy Life mini chocolate chips (no dairy).  Of course, she's also allergic to eggs and this recipe has none.

I added a couple of tablespoons of unsweetened coconut the 2nd time I made them - wonderful!

They were great! This was my first time making oatmeal chocolate chip. I did find there were too many chocolate chips, I even had tons leftover in the bowl that I just couldn't get into any of the cookies! Next time I think I'll use 1 cup of choc. chips and up the raisins to a whole cup :)

These cookies turned out really good! They were a little crumbly but I think taste is more important so that doesn't bother me the only change I would make next time is to use less chocolate chips 1 1/2 cups was a bit too much for me.

Turned out great! I substituted shortening for half of the butter (so they don't spread so much) and baked for only 10 minutes and they turned out perfect.

My new go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe!  I baked these at 350 for 7.5 minutes exactly and they came out perfect.  If your cookies are spreading thin, make sure you're not over-beating the butter/sugar and also do not use melted butter (only softened).

Needed an eggless recipe and was impressed by the reviews.... let me just say these were amazing. My batch yielded 35 cookies I have 16 left, my kids ate them right up. I made afew changes, omitted the raisins, added 1 cup whit and 1/2 cup ww flour, 3/4 cup butter, 1/4 apple sauce and used 100% cocoa chocolate chunks, turned out fabulous!!!

Very happy with these! Loved the fact they aren't too sweet AND that they are eggless! The first batch didn't spread at all, likely due to the fact that the butter was cold. As the dough warmed in between batches they started to spread. So if you're having trouble with these going flat, simply refrigerate the dough as others have suggested. As a personal preference I subbed nuts for raisins and added only 1 cup of chocolate chips. My husband really liked the fact these weren't super sweet. This recipe is a keeper!

I thought these were wonderful. Very soft and yummy in the middle, but still crisp enough on the outside and edges. It was a very good balance!
 Next time I will be putting raisins in instead of chocolate chip though; not because these were bad, but because if I'm gonna eat so many, they might as well have a LITTLE more nutritional value!
One thing though... I did not, "drop by teaspoonfuls," on to baking sheets though, as those were much to small. I tried that once as an experiment, and since they don't spread much they were just baby cookies. I dropped by an average spoonful and flattened them with a cold fork before putting them in, as someone suggested.
Again, these wer excellent. I gave the majority of the cookies to my neighbors for a Thanksgiving treat, as I knew having them around my house would not be very good for my health or waistline!

Wonderful recipe! I didn't have any baking soda and so I substituted with baking powder but the cookies turned out amazing. I used chocolate bars with hazelnuts rather than semi-sweet chocolate chips, but that was the only change I made. Great recipe - an instant classic. Thank you!

I promised my son oatmeal chocolate chip cookies for his party at school. There was only 1 problem - no eggs! I came across this recipe and gave it a try. The cookies were great! I followed the recipe except used 1 cup of mini chocolate chips as that's all I had. Perfect cookies! Thanks for the recipe.

This is an amazing oatmeal cookie recipe! They melt in your mouth.  I suggest following the instructions when it says to drop the cookies in teaspoon size amounts (or slightly larger). I got lazy toward the end and tried making a couple of big cookies.  They started to fall apart when I moved them from the cookie sheet to cool.

This cookie is GREAT! And the best part is it's a good cookie that doesn't call for eggs! It reminds me a lot of the 7 layer bar, it has similar taste. They mean it when they say only cook for 10-12 min then let cool. They do keep cooking so it's be easy to over cook them. My 3yr old loved making and eating these scrumptious cookies. :)

I have to admit i was worried about an egg-less recipe,but I sure am happy I went with it...This one is deffinatly a keeper.I used 3/4 c of choco chips and 3/4 c raisins and the balance was perfect. I also added 1/4 ts of cinnamon. They do darken in color in the cooling process,so 10 minutes was perfect followed by 2 minutes cooling before taking off the rack..I have found that by using a melon baller instead of a regular teaspoon helps keep the size more uniform making them a perfect "bite size" cookie.

A very well-balanced recipe.  You can microwave the water in a Pyrex cup, and then pop in the baking soda, before giving it a quick stir and adding the resulting fizz to your dough.  Watch that baking time: you want just slightly golden edges.  Let them sit a moment on the sheet, then remove with a spatula to a cooling rack -- just like any fragile cookies.  I took them to a Girl Scout meeting today.  NO leftovers!  The texture was just fine.

We ran out of eggs this week, but still had a craving for chocolate chip cookies. So, we found this recipe and gave it a shot. We were not expecting much.

The cookies had a slightly "healthier" texture, but about the best chocolate/oatmeal cookie we've ever made. This recipe is being added to our family favorites.

I wasn't sure about trying this recipe because it has no eggs, but it's FANTASTIC! I undercooked the first batch, so bake them for 12 minutes instead of 10. They tasted better to me a bit crunchy. Also, double the recipe because these will go fast!

Quick, easy to follow! Turned out great for me :) I do recommend pushing them down with a fork just a bit.. they definitely do not spread! I cooked at 340 for 10mins, left sitting on stove for 2 mins, then moved them to their cookie trey and they are delish! I also used 2c of choc chips to cover the raisin portion but you can totally get away with 1 1/2c and if you're going to use something with it you may want to reduce more unless you like lots of goodies in your cookie.

I found this recipe because I wanted to make cookies, but had no eggs. I gave it a 4 because it's not amazing as far as cookies go, but for cookies without eggs it's really a 5. I was so impressed. Trust the reviews that say that when they look undercooked, they're probably just right if you leave them on the pan a while. I may not make these when I have eggs around, but when I don't I won't run to the store, I'll make these again.

These cookies are very simple to make and they are delicious!  For the first batch, I put them on the pan and mashed them with a wet fork.  They turned out a little too flat, so for the next batch I just let them flatten on their own.  I would recommend the latter.  I gave these as gifts to some coworkers and received good feedback!

Seriously delicious.  I did freeze half the batter and I am glad I did because they are so good I would have eaten the whole batch.  I made no changes to the recipe and am tickled pink withe the cookie. Thank you for the great recipe.

A new favorite! This makes a perfect crunchy cookie and the kiddos (and you) can eat the raw dough since it is eggless!  Do not over-soften the butter.  Be sure to flatten the cookies with a fork before cooking.  Allow to set  for a few minutes before transferring off the cookie sheet.  12 minutes was too long in my oven (slightly burned) so it is better to go for 10 minutes.

I was all out of eggs and my kids wanted to make cookies!  I couldn't believe how good they tasted - and relatively healthy (I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and they still turned out great!).  We will definitely be making these often in the future.

Fabulous recipe! I chose this recipe because I didn't have any eggs and wanted to bake but I think I'll be making these from now on. Definitely let the cookies cool a minute before moving to a cooling rack and if you make more than one batch, let the pan cool in between or they'll spread too much.

These cookies are awesome, I didn't change a thing on the recipe!!  Baked for 11 minutes and although they looked a little gooey in the middle when I took them out they were perfect when cool. Kids loved them!!!

Excellent! I made these for a house full of skeptics but everyone was sold on these cookies! I really couldn't believe how good they were. I wanted a cookie the kids could help make and taste test the batter and these were perfect. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems. I like it when a recipe is perfect just the way it is.

My family loved these coookies! I made approximately 60 small cookies instead larger ones that I find go flat. I chose not to use the raisins. This will be a recipe I use over and over again.

These cookies are divine!  A big hit with my family.  I sub'd whole wheat flour for the all purpose and used Smart Balance butter instead of regular to make a healthier option.  I also lowered the sugar by 1/2 c and added 1/2 c more semi sweet chocolate chips.  If they held up to all of my modifications to make them a bit healthier, I'm sure they are even better as is.

I picked this recipe because I didn't have any eggs. I read all the reviews first but didn't change anything to the recipe. When spooning batter onto cookie sheet I pressed the batter firmly between two spoon making them stick together better for baking. Turned out great. I took the advice of others and let them continue baking on the sheet once out of the oven! I know my boyfriend will love them!

I used this recipe to try to mimic a cookie called "Chocolate Salty Oats".  I added extra oats and also used a mixture of regular cook and slow cook oats. Also, I added a high quality cocoa powder to make them "chocolate chocolate chip". I added an extra pinch of salt, and used callebaut chocolate chunks.   Instead of regular butter I substituted the 50/50 "butter/smart balance which is great for baking. They came out delicious!

I was skeptical but these turned out pretty good.  I did 10 min in the oven and 2 on the sheet and they were done just right.  I use a fork on them before baking and I would recommend doing that.  They also lacked a little flavor so I added a little cinnamon to the dough.  Pretty good for a quick and easy no egg recipe.

Nice chewy cookies (so far).  Baked for 10 minutes and let sit for 2 minutes on pan.  I didn't realize that I was out of Baking soda so, after doing some research, I subbed in 3 tsp of Baking Powder instead.  I also addedd a two more shakes of salt and 2 shakes of cinnamon.  Pretty yummy.

Found the cookies bland.  Made my version with peanut m&ms and the candy was the only exciting part of the cookie.  Maybe if there was more vanilla or some cinnamon... but I won't be trying this recipe again to find out.

This was delicious! I dislike soft cookies and this was just right! I made them as the recipe said but with milk chocolate chips and no raisins.  I had some left over packets of original microwavable oatmeal and just used that, went pretty well.  great recipe!

I'm not a big fan of oatmeal cookies but had a bag of quick oats to use up.  I made these cookies and must say...  they are great!  They are light and fluffy and only took 10mins.  I also loved the fact that the recipe made 3 dozen scruptious cookies.

I followed this recipe exactly, except for adding raisins. I thought the cookies came out somewhat tasteless. I didn't experience any crumbling, however, as some has mentioned.

I've been making these cookies for two years now. I take them to parties and potlucks and people always ask for the recipe! I like to add chopped nuts for extra crunch.

I added an egg but these fell apart for me also.  The flavor was ok but made a mess and turned into crumbles.  I was not very happy because they were ment to be gifts and I had to make a different batch with a different recipe.

Great recipe!  The only modification I made was substituting a 1/2 cup of butter-flavored shortening for half the butter.  The cookies came out with such a great consistency, soft and moist, with a slight crispness on the outside. Highly recommended!

These were excellent.  My 12 year old made them by herself.  The 15 minute cook time was kind of a long time, but it was worth it.  It made a lot of cookies too.  Delicious and very portable.  They don't crumble like other cookies.  I would replace the butter with butter flavored shortning because it makes them less crumbly.

LOVE this cookie! Although it makes more than the recipe yields, but who could complain about extra cookies?! I added about a half teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix and half a cup of pecans instead of raisins. My friend that doesn't even like cookies or desserts with nuts in them, raves about this cookie! And if you're having issues with them flattening out, try rolling them into balls first; and parchment paper is the secret to evenly baked (and non-stick) cookies!

These were fantastic! My breast feeding son has a dairy, egg and nut allergy and these curbed a craving I have had for weeks. I cooked them exactly like the recipe and they were chewy just like I like them. I will be making these often!

I was looking for an oatmeal choc.chip recipe and decided to try this one. I was happy with the way the cookies turned out. I followed the recipe completely, and I let them bake for 12 min. and kept them on the pan for another 5. It's nice to allow the kids to be able to lick the bowls because this is an egg-less recipe! I think the only thing I would try different is whole wheat flour for a even healthy cookie. :o)

These cookies are delicious! I replace 3/4 c all purpose flour with 3/4 whole wheat flour. You can't even tell they're a bit healthier. I may try all whole wheat flour next time I make them. I agree with other reviewers that the cookies need to sit on the pan for at least 2 minutes to prevent crumbling. I also use a criss-crossed cooling rack so the cookie can't fall through the slots.

I JUST made these.  Some are still in the oven!  I'm not a big fan of oatmeal but made them for my boyfriend.  Even I like them, though.  I did add 1/2 c more flour, a full tsp of soda, (as recommended by other reviewers) but kept the salt as the recipe calls.  I subbed 1 c sweet choc chips.  I did chill them 30 min and didn't flatten them on the sheet w/ a fork.  They turned out very good, maybe a little bit dry because of the extra flour.  Oh, and I baked them at 325 for 10 - 11 min. Take them out before they are too brown on top to keep them chewy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a great recipe. However, the recipe made many more cookies than the recipe stated. Also, they did not hold up well shipping overseas so I was a little sad. I guess these cookies will just be cookies for staying at home and eating immediately after making. Otherwise, a really good recipe.

Deeeelicious! This is definitely a keeper! I recommend letting the cookies cool for about 10 minutes before trying to move them from the baking pan to the cooling rack so that they can keep their shape. I used a small ice cream scoop to make each cookie even, too. It's really convenient. =)

Great recipe for oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.  The only thing that I did differently was use 3/4 cup semi sweet MINI chocolate chips and 3/4 milk chocolate chips.  They turned out perfect at 10 minutes,

This recipe was AMAZING. The best cookies I have made in a long time. The only thing I found was that it's a good idea to do a heaping tbl. of dough, it seems to come out better than a smaller cookie, but overall...GREAT

The key is taking the steps to make these cookies. Follow this exactly: you have to really beat the butter with the sugars first, then add the vanilla and beat it until it is creamy. I use a Kitchen Aid mixer (love that thing). Then add the flour/salt mixture (mixed separately first) and mixed, then the water/baking soda mixture and mixed until creamy. Then I added the oats then the chocolate chips, mixing after each.  The consistency was perfect, and it fell right off the paddle mixer. I sprinkled cinnamon and folded the dough, then used about a rounded tablespoon-sized ball on parchment paper, and pressed lightly on each with a fork to slightly flatten. I used a Caphalon pan (which I find usually need a few minutes longer to cook); 14 minutes was perfect. I am adding these to my recipe box. Photo was included.

These are great.  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup olive oil and I added 1/2 cup ground flax seed.  I also used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour.  My kids were thrilled.  I followed the other reviewers advice and didn't try to move them for at least 2 minutes and I flattened each cookie with the back of a spoon after dipping the spoon in cold water before flattening each cookie.  No crumbling at all!  Yum.

Really good cookie recipe. I had to turn the oven temp down to 325 and cook the cookies for 14:00 because they weren't cooking through in time. Also, pressing them down with a fork helped a lot. I would probably prefer a "with egg" recipe, but I forgot to pick them up at the store, so this worked perfectly.

This recipe is great and has become my only oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe!  The taste is perfect!  Made with salted butter, it's a bit salty - but that brings out the sweet and makes it even better.  My only complaint is that the cookies are quite flat after baking, as are most cookies like this made with butter.  But the taste can't be beat, so I highly recommend them.  I added a little cinnamon to mine too. Yum!

Thank you for this eggless recipe!! I have made these several times, each time with excellent results. My only modification is using half whole wheat flour occasionally. They're still excellent, and a BIT more healthful.

I decided to go with this recipe because I was out of eggs. I substituted shortening for butter, and added a little bit of light corn syrup to hold them together (I was worried because of the lack of eggs, silly worry, I know). I don't know if this cookie dough is going to make it into the oven! It's delicious! :D  The only reason I could think of for someone having these come our runny is not mixing completely- after adding the water I did find it to be a bit runny but the more I mixed the better the mixture soaked it up!  Thank you for the recipe! I'll definately be trying it out again once I get butter and vanilla extract ;)

I'd give it 4.5 if possible.  These cookies are really good.  They do taste slightly off because of the lack of egg, but it's hardly noticeable.  This does mean I can eat as much dough and lick the bowl as much as I'd like though.  Definitely something to try.  (I did add cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  Still good.)

These cookies are amazing! My husband loves them and frequently asks me to make them. Last time I made them I used half butterscotch chips and half chocolate chips and they were delicious! I also flatten them just a little bit so they cook more evenly.

These are great cookies -very tasty and easy to make. I appreciate that there are no eggs or shortening in the recipe. I had to keep my family out of the dough! I baked them for 9 minutes because we like a chewier cookie.I will definitely make these again.Thanks for sharing the recipe!

we were craving chocolate chip cookies tonight, but we were out of eggs. i found this recipe and i am so glad i did! they are very delicious. i love how soft they are in the middle and crunchy on the outside. i did squish them down with a fork before i put them in the oven, so i think that might have helped. i also added a few teaspoons of sugar more then called for and they tasted great!

Loved this recipe! Very easy and timing was perfect. Did not make any changes at all. Believe it or not, I've always had trouble with chocolate chip recipes. Seems they flatten out too much and get so dry, even though I follow the recipe to a T! But this one is great! Holds together nicely -- a little crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside.  This is my new favorite chocolate chip/oatmeal recipe. Thanks so much for sharing.

This was the very first I've ever baked cookies and these turned out wonderful!!!
My husband loved them.  Very easy to make and 12 min was perfect.  They do seem undercooked at first, but when cooled they are perfect.  Will definitely make these again!!!!

My husband was craving oatmeal chocolate chip cookies and I didn't have any eggs so I decided to make these. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised how good these are. For personal taste preference I omitted the raisins and I added coconut. I modified what the other reviewer suggested and after I scooped the dough on the cookie sheet I rolled in into a ball and flatten with the dough with a fork and I dipped the fork in water after I flattened each cookie.

I had a craving for Oatmeal Choc Chip Cookies and have never had a good recipe that wasn't too dry....this was GREAT! My husband and I loved these- I had some extra Peanut butter chips around so total I added 2 cups of chips instead of 1.5 and it was that much more yummy! Wouldn't change a thing- I also recommend flattening the cookie before baking- I only cooked for 10 minutes and they were perfect!

These cookies are a huge hit in our house -make sure you flatten them.  I also, when pressed for time, made them as a pan cookie -baked for approx. 18-22 min. and they're still great

I use this recipe every time I make oatmeal cookies!  It's amazing - people are always asking me for the recipe and wanting seconds.  It's prefect for those with egg allergies (like myself).  You won't be disappointed with these cookies.

This was a wonderful recipe! I followed the recipe but added 1/4 cup of wheat germ and substituted for 1/2 cup of the oats,one pack of Cinnamon and Spice instant oatmeal to give it more of the spice flavor (the remaining 1 1/2 cup I used plain oats per recipe). They turned out soooooo good! They are very soft and chewy. I baked one batch and put the remaining dough in the fridge overnight. I made the remainder this morning and they were even better! The dough was harder and easier to work with and the cookies came out not as crumbly. Either way, they were very very good--just like a bakery! Thank you so much for this recipe. It's a keeper!

Yummy Recipe!  They did fall apart a bit at first, but I just let them cool a little longer and then transferred them to a cookie rack.  It seemed to work for me and after that none of them fell apart :)  The only thing that I can say about them (I really don't eat a lot of sweets) is that they were very sweet!

Very nice...easy to make and taste great. I halfed the recipe(testing !!!) skipped the white sugar and used WHOLE WHEAT. They came out nice in shapes too(i shaped the cookies with hand and placed them on the sheet which gave them the perfect shape). They are a little crumbly though crumble if just press a little harder (speaking in point of view from toddler ... no issues for us )
It is always good to find a eggless cookie recipe(being vegetarian).
Thanks for the sharing.

The cookie dough may be great, but I wasn't impressed with the actual cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly and had flat cookies that fell apart.  I gave them 2 more minutes in the oven to try and give them some strength and they came out hard as rocks and glued to the pan.  Maybe I'm just missing the sweet spot on these, but I'll be sticking with my other recipes.

I am so amazed at this recipe!  It makes the perfect cookie!  I added my 3 secret baking ingredients: ground cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  I used a silicone pad over my cookie sheet and the bottoms are perfectly golden and crispy.

We love these cookies! I add more vanilla and chocolate chips to the recipe because we like our cookies sweeter. Pay close attention to the cookie time as these can burn quickly!

These are cookies are amazing. The only thing is that I found the cooking time is too long. I bake them for 7-8 min and they are usually good. I just keep an eye on them in the last minute. They are soo good. My boyfriend has an egg allergy and he loves these in his lunches. I cannot rave about them enough!

These are amazing cookies! I used margarine and dark brown sugar, and they are too die for! I like the idea of using mini chocolate chips instead of regular size, but we did do the raisins too. Will be making this one more than regular chocolate chips! And the dough is great!

I cut the recipe in half, made this with vegan margarine, half mini chocolate chips and half chopped pecans, total of one cup of chips and nuts. They turned out delicious. I was suprised as it didn't seem as if there was anything to bind the batter together, but they baked up nice and crisp, very chewy, not too sweet. Might be the best oatmeal chocolate chippers I've ever had. Definitely a keep and very easy to convert to vegan!

My teenage daughter had an easy time making this recipe and enjoyed eating a lot of the cookie dough!  Oh, me too. Yes, the dough was yummy and so were the cookies!  I wasn't sure how they would turn out without the eggs but, low and behold, they were terrific.  We followed the advice from others on letting them cool before eating them so they wouldn't fall apart.  We gave them out as holiday treats and they were a hit.  One recipient said there were too many chocolate chips but we ignored her.  We tend to improvise by adding a few more chips.

These are the best oatmeal cookies ever! They are so light and airy for an oatmeal cookie! Right before I put one of the cookie sheets in the oven I dusted a few of them with cinnamon, and they turned out great.

This is by far the easiest and tastiest recipe for chocolate chip oatmeal cookies. Every time I make them they get eaten very quickly! YUM! They make slightly more than 3 dozen if you spoon half a tablespoon (which makes pretty good sized cookies). Enjoy!

The first time I made this recipe I used dark and light chocolate chunks (Hershey's) and the cookies were fantastic.  The second and third time I made them, I used regular chocolate chips and the cookies were good, but not great.  Bottom line is, easy and good oatmeal base, but the quality of the chocolate matters.  Will make these a regular for my kids.

These are absolutely delicious.  One of the best oatmeal-chocolate cookie recipes I have ever made.  Crispy and chewy all at the same time.  Loved them!

Very very good cookie recipe. I enjoyed the dough almost as much as the cookies themselves (if not more).

My sister-in-law gave me this recipe and I absolutely love it! I often make it without any chocolate chips and just leave it as a plain oatmeal cookie recipe, without changing anything. It's still delicious. I like the cookies thick so I never flatten them. I usually use a Silpat and that cooks them very evenly. And I love not feeling guilty about eating the dough because there are no eggs!

I love this recipe mainly because we are big cookie dough eaters, and it's nice to be able to eat while we make this without worrying about raw eggs.  The dough tastes wonderful!  The cookies are tasty as well.  I was a little disappointed at how thin they were, but the taste and texture is good.  I would love to dry this dough recipe with dried cranberries and white chocolate chips. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

My son cannot have milk, so we use non-dairy margarine and chocolate chips and it is great. With no eggs, I don't have to worry so much about all the dough the kids eat while "helping" mom make cookies. Great Recipe!!!

These were pretty good. I was asked by a guy friend to make oatmeal choc chip cookies so came here an tried to find a well rated recipe that wouldn't give me several dozen. So I tried this one cause it looked smaller and had good reviews. There was no difference without the eggs. We ate them fresh out of the oven and he said they were great but I wasn't sure yet but the next day they were moist and awesome and I got the true taste. I'm not one to modify recipes so made it exactly minus the nuts. It was easy and quick. I will probably make these again.

Absolutely wonderful! These cookies were beautiful and tasty. I made these for some friends while housesitting and bored.  Instead of just chocolate chips, I used a mixture of semi-sweet, white chocolate, and m & ms to total the amount of semi-sweet  chocolate chips called for. Next time I'll try to make them with vegan margarine and carob chips, I love the fact that they don't contain eggs and can be easily adapted to a vegan recipe.

I tried these hoping that they would be better than my other oatmeal cookie recipes but I had the same problem with this one.  (It's not my oven, I've moved 7 times and always have this problem).  They spread so thin on the pan that I end up with flat, crisp oatmeal cookies with chips and raisins clumped in the middle.  They fell apart terribly.  After the first two pan fulls I added some more oatmeal to the dough.  The next two pans were a little better but they got so brown on the bottom after 9 minutes.  I guess I'll keep trying, I want a little more dough in my chips and raisins.  I also think it may help to let the dough sit a while before baking them to allow the oatmeal to absorb some of the water.  The dough on the first pan-full was watery which probably made them spread too fast.

These are terrific!  I added a bit more raisins than the recipe called for (more than 1/2 cup).  I also used old-fashioned rolled oats instead of the quick-cooking kind which makes these even more substantial and yummy!  I used very dark (60% cacoa) chocolate chips which complements the oatmeal and raisins very well (plus a bit more healthy!)  My husband gave these the ultimate thumbs up. Will definitely make again!

These are tasty cookies but very dense.  There is just a little cookie holding the oatmeal together.  The adults in my family think they are pretty good but the kids arent fond of them.

I've been trying different chocolate chip recipes for a while looking for a  keeper. This is it! 
I don't like raisins
but will try other additions such as pecans. I will also try using less sugar
and choc. chips in future, not sure how will turn out but will be fun to try.
Also may try adding peanut butter sometime.

Pretty darn good cookies! Especially for not having the egg! I cooked them for a 9 minutes instead of 10 to make sure I had really soft cookies. I didn't add the raisins (personal preference). These were certainly a lifesaver when I had to make cookies and didn't have any eggs in the house! Thank you!

After promising my kids that we would make cookies and then realizing we had no eggs, I found this wonderful recipe.  The eggless batter is just as good to munch on as the baked cookies.  It was perfect for a rainy day like today when getting out just for eggs wasn't on my list of things to do.

These cookies were awesome.  My boyfriend had a craving for them and I picked this recipe from all the others and they turned out  great.  I personally have never seen a cookie hold shape so well when it's baking, it didn't get runny or flatten out at all.    I tried one thing a little different by grinding the oats in a blender before measuring them into the batter.  The reason I tried this was to try to duplicate an amish cookie that I had over the summer that you couldn't even tell had oats in it because they were finely ground.  My boyfriend loved them this way.  Thanks for a great cookie!

I omitted the chocolate chips, and instead made a regular oatmeal cookie.  The texture is great, and the cookies are just the right sweetness.  The best part is that the cookies have so much fiber, you actually don't feel that guilty eating them!

These cookies taste great!  I may have slightly overcooked the first 2 batches and undercooked the last one.  They were either crunchy and flat or raw in the middle.  And they seemed a little too greasy for me.  I used all butter.  I also used old-fashioned oats.  I would like to try steel cut oats next.  The taste is perfect and exactly what I was looking for, though!

Excellent!  My daughter is allergic to eggs, and you don't miss them in this recipe.  Even my husband liked them after I said, "by the way, they don't have eggs!"  I use my 1 1/2 tbs cookie scoop and bake them for 10 minutes-- perfect!

Thank you so much-  I was out of eggs but really wanted cookies.  I did halve the recipe because I didn't want to use 2 sticks of butter and I melted the butter.  These were terrific!  Chewy, soft.  The dough does easily fall apart, just pack into spoon before placing on cookie sheet.  The first dozen I didn't pack so they came out flat- I have eaten 6 already as I type.  The second batch are in the oven now, puffier because I packed the dough.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Definitely recommend.  Did not miss the egg.

I keep children part time in my home & realized before snack time that I had no eggs to make my chocolate chip cookies. I came on here & did a search of eggless recipes. I came across this one & decided to try it. This was absolutely the best cookie, of any type, I have ever made!!! It was perfect! My kids loved them. The only thing I did different was that I added Nestle peanut butter chips & chocolate chips together. I am thrilled to have this recipe.

I mustly tried this recipe because I was out of eggs and my husband really wanted oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. I was worried at first because they seemed to crumble before I baked them. But they turned out great!

This cookie was really good.  I omitted the raisins (dont like them) and used half chocolate chips and half butterscotch chips.  They were fantastic!  I didn't have any eggs and was worried they wouldn't turn out, but they were one of the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made.  Nice and flat with crispy edges and chewy middles.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Pretty good in a pinch!  I wanted to make cookies for my kids and their friends when I realized that I was out of eggs...so I did a recipe search and decided to make this recipe.  After I made the dough, I only added chocolate chips to half the dough and left the other half plain.  

They made the kids happy!

I altered the recipe a bit and that may be the reason I didn't get great results.  I used half margarine and half light-butter (probably shouldn't use light butter again).  The cookies were very flat and had many tiny air bubbles in them (kind of like a lace cookie).  I always use parchment paper when baking cookies, it makes it so much easier to remove the baked cookies.  I also substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour instead of white.  I will try this recipe again using all butter.  The batter was pretty good considering it didn't have any eggs.

I dont have a clue what I did wrong with this recipe.  Followed it practically to the letter.  The cookies came out dry (but still relatively tasty).  They practically fell apart when I took them off the cookie sheet.  :o(  I did give this 2 stars since the batter was really good by itself...  :o)

I took these cookies into work and EVERYONE fell in love with them.  They are a huge hit, and everyone is asking for the recipe.  I have made them crispy and they are still great!  I find you must cook them for minimum 13 minutes though.

it's so great that this recipe doesn't call for eggs. my roomates are picky vegans- i used whole wheat flour and vegan chocolate and they said these cookies were arguably the best they'd ever had.

It's very difficult to find good eggless recipes out there, so it's nice to know that this cookie is really great tasting. Family & friends don't even realize that these were baked w/o eggs.
