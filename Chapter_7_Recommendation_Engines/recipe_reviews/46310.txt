Based on the reviews, I made some slight changes and had great success.

Note that I let the fruit soak for about 18 hours - only because some other things came up.  I think this is one of the mysteries of the recipe.  Since I had soaked it for so long, the peels were really soft, so I boiled for a shorter time.  I think for the first boil, we need a time as that will seriously effect the amount of liquid.  I did measure out 3 cups of fruit (I used a blender to chop) and added 7 cups of water instead of 9.

I still added 9 cups of sugar.  I added 1/2 cup lemon instead of 1/4 because it seemed so sweet.  I did not add pectin.  I boiled until 220, poured in jars, then processed to seal.

My marmalade did gel - not completely like store bought, but enough to spread, and it tastes delicious.  

Next time I would take out another cup or 2 of water.  I think I would like less sweet, but I know the amount of sugar effects the gelling.  Maybe I would take out one orange and add more lemon juice?  

But you can definitely do this without pectin.  I highly recommend.

I have made this recipe every year for the last 6.  After the first time, I reduced the water to 2 cups/cup of mixture.  This improved the taste and consistency and reduced the boiling time.  Every one who tastes it loves it!

Beautiful sparkling marmalade just like from the store.  This recipe has 4 stars only for confusion because it made me nervous while making it.  You could however go to the trouble to remove the peel from the quartered oranges, scrape off more of the white part, and then slice the peel with a knife, if you want to remove any bitter taste, but its good as is.  Dont bother rechopping kumquats (just slice them on a mandolin).  I wonder why it says to add water and soak overnighta step not called for in other recipes.  I decided to add a packet of regular pectin as insurance on warning of another reviewer, at about 218 degrees (never could reach 220 degrees).  Highly recommend the pectin; texture is perfect.

Good recipe, although make sure you slice the orange skin thinly or the marmalade gets clumpy...unless you like that!

This is a great recipe.  I made with Splenda since my husband is diabetic.  Sliced kumquats and seeded.  Cooked until I thought was ready and it turned out perfect.

Today, I put kumquats in my Vita-Mix and pureed, added Splenda and lemon juice and cooked until I thought was ready - made really nice Kumquat Butter (like Apple Butter)  Did not soak before cooking.

As this is the first recipe that I have tried on your site it may be a bit forward of to ask if the amount of water added to the fruit is a bit excessive.

This marmalade is so good!!!  I made two batches in a month.  I gave them to my friends and everyone just love the taste. I changed the recipe:  I added orange without peel, used half splenda and half suger, processed through a blender and added  a package of pectin for 6 cups of fruit mixture.   The taste was awesome!

I agtee with the first review and should have taken the advice to add pectin.  I now have several jars of kumquat syrup.  It tastes good but I am disappointed in myself for not going with my instincts.

Too runny and too sweet.  I have made tons of jams and jellies.  This is the first one I have made that has never set. This recipe needs measurement adjustments.

Everyone loved this marmalade.  My mother-in-law loved it so much she asked for the recipe.  I only let it soak for 2 hours. Maybe that's why mine came out a little liquidy.  And I used a food processor to chop up the fruit.  Made it so much easier and less chuckier.

I used VERY little of the orange skins - they make it bitter!   I popped the WHOLE Kumquat in to my blender and blended them up with the oranges until slightly chunky  - pour them in pot, cover with just enough water to cover all fruit  - bring to boil  - simmer for...a while...until the skins are soft (it doesn't take long)   (I didn't soak them for any amount of time!)  - I had 10 cups fuit/water mixture and I added only 7 cups sugar, lemon juice AND some vanilla to take away a bit of the bitter left over - the vanilla added wonderfully!  - boil to gel stage (mine never reached this but I added a packet of liquid pectin) - it firmed up plenty to put on toast, but certainly isn't a "gel" -  - pour into hot sterilized jars, seal, process for 10 minutes  Thats my modified recipe - no soaking, less sugar, less chunky and super delicious!

According to the previous comments, it seems like that the jam was cooked with water. The recipe should’ve mentioned, “Drain the water, then measure the fruit”. In addition, there’s no need in so much water for soaking, just 1.5-2 inches above the fruit is enough. Pectin is not essential either, the mixture jellifies beautifully when brought to 20 degrees F. Amount of sugar has to be equal to the amount of fruit and for more accurate results it’s better to use scale.

This recipe needs clarification!  The directions are too vague and confusing and now I have 6 pints of kumquat syrup because of way too much water. It is very tasty syrup but unusuable for marmalade!
Clarify the directions to show that the soaking liquid is NOT the amount of liquid used for cooking the fruit mixture.  I would recommend a complete revision of the directions so that they are less confusing.

Just made this and it's better than perfect!  Made a couple of alterations - only added 2 cups of water per cup of fruit.  Also discarded skin on the oranges and used 1/2 cup of lemon juice instead of 1/4

I am not familiar with how to make marmalade and this recipe is a very poor description for a first timer. I read some of the other reviews and reduced the water by two cups and STILL was left with a watery mess at the end. Mine did not gel at all. Very disappointed.

Good recipe, however I used Ruby Red grapefruit instead of the oranges. The taste was tart yet sweet, perfect for the holiday basket. I also used only 2 cups of water per 1 cup of fruit which I processed in a food processor.   I will however use pectin next time due to the somewhat runny consistency. Otherwise, great recipe.

Oh, how I wish I had read the reviews before I began to cook this recipe!  I used no orange peel, and soaked overnight as directed.  I also used half a cup of lemon juice, as I ahve a very prolific tree.  After about 2 HOURS of boiling, I gave up and potted it.  Next day I re-boiled it for a further 45 minutea and achieved a set!  I live at altitude, and this affets the setting temperature of jams, as water boils at 94 degrees.  Howver, it is a lovely marmalade, and gave me another use for my kumquats.  I also preserve the fruit whole, in syrup.  Incidentally, I am not sure how you could put the kumquats in a blender, because the variety grown in my country has LOTS of pips in, which need to be removed before cooking.  A bit tedious but worth it!

Some of the the reviews on here make it seem that many who try this recipe don't realize that a marmalade is traditionally very different than a jam or jelly. It is supposed to have large pieces of rind in it. This is where the natural pectin is and what causes the gelling of the liquid. The preserved rind and juice of citrus is the definition of marmalade, it originated with the ancients, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantine s. It was a way to not waste any part of a fruit, or to use fruit that was of less quality. It was the Romans that originally brought the recipes for it to the British Isles, and then a 1000 years later during the 17th and 18th centuries, as it was all the rage to revamp anything from the ancient world, the recipes traveled with European colonists to the new world and were adapted to add new crops that they"discovered " growing here, such as sugar cane.

I reviewed this recipe once before, but have since tried it again and this is the result.  My fruit of choice was Calamonden, a cross between a kumquat and a manderine orange.  I reduced the water a lot, and the sugar very little.  I didn't use oranges because the skin of the Calamonden is sweet, the fruit is bitter.  I chopped the fruit before boiling it. I didn't soak it because the skin breaks down quickly.  This time I added some pectin because the last batch was soft.  This time it came out just right.  I've also done this with Satsumas mixed with Calamondens.  It was milder but delicious.  My Aunt doesn't care for Marmalade but loved this.  You can probably use this recipe as a basic Marmalade for all sorts of citrus, but I imagine you'll have to reduce the water to get a good gel.

Wonderful taste!  I had planned to triple this recipe, so used 75 kumquats, 6 oranges and 6 lemons.  I ended up with 8 cups fruit/water mixture, added 4 tbsp pectin, 2 tsp vanilla and the lemon juice from 6 lemons.  The taste is wonderful!   However this did not set up well.  It's not runny but not set up.  Next time I would add MUCH less water (probably 1 cup for 1 cup of fruit). And add more pectin, probalby 6 Tbsp.  The taste is wonderful though.  The vanilla really adds!

I'd rate this higher if it were easier.  Modified this to be done in less than an hour and added different flavors for different batches.  I used 1 lb fruit, (de-seeded, then sliced in the food processor), 12 oz sugar and 2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice.  Stir then microwave on high 6 min.  Stir then microwave 2 min, continue in 2 min bursts an additional 4 times (complete cooking 16 min).  Add 2 Tbsp brandy, 2 Tbsp bourbon, or 2 tsp gaaram masala.  Pour into pint jars.  Super easy and pretty yummy.

Total failure.  I substituted a small grapefruit for one of the oranges and increased the lemon juice a bit.  This would have made for a slightly less sweet marmalade, if only it had jelled at all.  It didn't.   I ended up with dozens of jars of liquid "citrusized" sugar.  I cut the water a bit based on several of the reviews I read; however, I kept the sugar ratio as called for in the recipe.  I soaked, boiled, etc., then brought the whole thing to 220 degrees as directed.  No jelling.  I should have used pectin.

Maybe someone has a suggestion for what this syrup could be used for.  It's definitely not marmalade.

After reading all the reviews I realized that most people who tried this recipe suggested less sugar and water. I followed the advise, but also added very finely sliced strips of fresh ginger, which adds a zing to the marmalade. Great hit ! Try it with your holiday meats along with mustard too.

The mixture never set, not even close.  The only thing I did not do was allow them to soak overnight, but others said soaking made their marmalade runny.  So this recipe is just not a real marmalade, more of a sauce.

I let the fruit soak for about 18 hours. Then I let it boil for a WHILE! It never did gel but it tastes great. Certainly a great way to use the kumquats no one wanted to eat.

There was not enougn fruit to liquid ratio. It came out very running and thin.  What a waste of time and kumquats.

Great recipe.  I reduced the water to about 2 1/2 cups per, and next time I'll take it down to 2 cups, as boiling time was unnecessarily long.  Make sure to take it all the way up to 221 degrees!  I canned mine in very small jars to give as gifts and so far the response has been great.

Wow.  Loved this.  I made sure the rind was soft before I went to the final step and added 1/2 package of Sure-Jell (I've never canned before and wanted to be sure it turned out) and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to make it Christmas-sy.  Yummy.  You made me a real grandma.

The flavours in this marmalade are good.  I followed the recommendation of 2 cups of water per cup of fruit, though still found I had too much liquid.  It's not a major problem if you have put in too much water, just keep it simmering for longer prior to putting the sugar in to let it reduce to approximately half.  If you've already put the sugar in, do not panic, just keep the rolling boil going.  

Don't worry about the temperature so much if you have got the rolling boil going.  Have a plate in the freezer and when you want to check if the marmalade is ready take the plate out of the freezer and put a teaspoonful of the mixture on the plate.  Then put the plate back in the freezer for approximately a minute.  Take the plate out of the freezer and with your finger gently push the edge of the marmalade on the plate.  When you push you are looking for a rippling effect.  Ideally when you push you want the ripples to be close together rather than one or two ripples spread out through the dollop of marmalade. If on your first test you get only one or two ripples, keep the roiling boil going, put the plate back in the freezer and check again by repeating the process 15 minutes later.  Keep checking until the desired consistency is reached. Once you have a good cluster of ripples when you push, you can take the marmalade off the heat and start decanting it into your jars.

One more tip for the scum on the top at the end.  Put a little bit of butter in and stir until it dissolves.

I made this today and since I tend to be impatient I didn't let the fruit soak.  I only used enough water to just cover the top of the fruit in the pan and put it on to boil.  I think all total boiling and simmering time was around two hours.  It got up to 221F and gelled beautifully.  Made some toast tonight and put it on it.  Yummy!

Thanks, I loved not having to mess with pectin. The consistency was just right without it. This is the perfect way to use the kumquats from our little tree. It produces just enough to make a delicious batch. I reduced the water by two cups, as others suggested, and reduced the sugar by a cup.

Neighbors gave me probably 20 kumquats.  This was a great way to use them up, and I gave him a jar.  This week, he brought me a bowl of 2-3 pounds of kumquats and an empty jar.  Need I say more?

I've been making this recipe for 15 years, but always used 6 cups or 1.5 quart of water. The amount of sugar depends on the amount of the liquid/fruit you boiled. Also I don't boil for too long before adding the sugar, maybe for 20 or 30 minutes, as I like the rind with a little bite to it. GREAT TIP: to remove the pits from the kumquats, cut them across in half and use a metal cuticle tool to scoop them out.

Followed others advise and added less water and less sugar. I added the orange peel from only 1/4 orange finely julienned; I soaked all finely chopped fruit in water for about 1 hour. Added pectin and a bit of vanilla. It is DELICIOUS!!

Very delicious kumquats marmalade recipe. Easy to put together. Been experimenting with different marmalade recipes and this is the best I have come across so far. As I'm no expert, I followed the recipe as is and I think it turned out fine. Thanks so much for sharing.

this was my first attempt at making marmalade. I used pink grapefruit instead of oranges because that's what I had and added some fresh ginger and a little mulling spice, and it turned out beautiful and tart. I didn't change the recipe at all other than that. it was confusing to me to have the citrus slices so large. didn't seem appetizing so I put the fruit in the blender before the last gel stage to chop it up finer. if I make marmalade again I'll reference this recipe.

is good. Reduced water from 3 cups to 2 to make sure there wasn't too much liquid in there. Also reduced sugar from 1 cup to 3/4 cup. Also added Habanero for a nice bite to the marmalade. Addicting.

Zero!!! Allrecipes forced me to rate one star to submit but I give it zero!!!   I made this recipe twice and both times the results were the same:  watery, no jam consistency.  I made it twice because I thought I must have not followed the recipe correctly.  I would not bother making this recipe.  It was a waste of my kumquats and time.

Followed instructions precisely but ended up with syrup.  I think other reviewers are correct - you will need pectin to get syrup to jell.

It never set up even after a water bath.  I then had to remove it from the jars and cook some more with a package of Sure Gel.  It has set up but I do not think the recipe as written will ever work. You need pectin.

WAAAY too much water and runny and syruppy. I followed this recipe down to every detail. I have kumquat syrup now. Why so much water? A waste of four hours of my time and a waste of my first batch of home grown kumquats.

Didn't gel after simmering for 5 hours. First of all, I agree with other reviewers that 3 cups of water for every cup of fruit is way too much. 2 cups or less might work. Secondly, at the end it says to place unsealed jars in a water bath. Now, I know not to put hot glass in contact with cold water, but in my frustration I did it anyway and ended with a broken jar and runny syrup in the sink. Very confusing instructions.

I made this with no pectin as it said, and it certainly did NOT set up.  I thought perhaps it needed a day or two, but it's three days later, and it might make good syrup-but certainly isn't a marmalade consistency.

I altered this recipe and added 2 envelopes of liquid pectin because the marmalade did not gel.  I thought there was too much liquid when I sta  but I went ahead and followed the recipe anyway. The next day  I ended up  re cooking & re sterilizing my jars & adding pectin. Vola! It turned out perfect!!

I have also followed this recipe and ended up with a "runny, good tasting" result.  Not wanting to waste it, I tried using it in a boxed cake mix with good results when making a pound cake.  Follow box directions, but substitute the runny marmalade for the amount of water.  Bake in loaf pans.  Excellent with any citrus flavored cake mix, especially if topped with a light lemon flavored glaze.  In fact, I continue to jar "runny" marmalade just for making these cakes.  I also drastically reduce the water amounts at other times and end up with a GREAT jelled marmalade.

I used this recipe last night. I didn't get a marmalade that is a thick as I like. I did reduce the amount of sugar by a cup or two which may hav affected te gelling. & also used a 2/1 ratio w/ the fruit and water (instead of 3/1). If I were to make this again, I'd probably add pectin, & def wuduse a food processor to make sure the skins r finely chopped enough and to take the time to remove the pith.
