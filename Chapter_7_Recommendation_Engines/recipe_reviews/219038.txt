Amazing fudge! I used two dark chocolate bars, large marshmallows snipped into quarters, almond extract and glace cherries instead of dried. The result was exactly what I envisioned: rich, creamy fudge that recalls black forest cake. The flavour combination is sophisticated and uttely addictive. I stirred in the cherries last, quite gently. A definite must try!

This was a very easy fudge recipe! And yummy to boot. I made no substitutions except to use store brand dark chocolate chunks. We made three different fudge recipes this weekend and hubby and I both liked this one the best. The flavor is very good. It's a dense fudge, not as fluffy as some.

Delicious!  I made this last night and it is awesome!  It is very sweet and I might cut back on sugar next time and Hubby said he would like some walnut in it the next time!  It took longer than two hours to harden so I left it in the fridge over night.  When I left it in room temperature this morning it became too soft, so I put them in a container and back in the fridge.  Wish I could just leave them at room temperature though!  But it sure taste great, rich and yummy... and so easy to make!!

Smooth creamy fudge.  Easy to make.  I used cherry flavored crasins because I think they are more flavorful than dired cherries.  Next time I think I will try cherry flavoring in place of the vanilla.

Very good, sweet though and I did use less sugar than the recipe called for. However, I did use marshino cherries as I didn't have dried on hand. This did take more than 2 hours to firm up; I left it in the fridge overnight and it was perfect. Overall, this was a nice rich fudge and very easy to make.

So easy, yet so delicious! This fudge was so chocolately, creamy and rich.  The addition of tart dried cherries not only made this festive for the holidays, but gave it a nice contract in color and flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly and got great results.  This is a definite "must try" for fudge lovers everywhere!

Made this for a holiday family get together and it was a huge hit.  To give it a stronger cherry flavor I added about a tablespoon of grenadine

Yum! Followed the recipe until I got to the part where I was supposed to add the cherries... tore through my cabinets looking for them before realizing that I must not have bought them in the first place. I did have dried cranberries though, so added those instead and it worked very well. Very tasty. Thanks :)

A delicious little bite of fudge.  Typically when I make fudge it never comes out, but this came out beautiful!  The cherries really balanced out the sweetness of the fudge.  A definite keeper!

Creamy, decadent and scrumptious fudge.  The only thing that I did differently was to use almond extract instead of vanilla to enhance the cherry flavor.  FYI a 10-oz bag of morsels is the 1-2/3 cups you need for this recipe

Best fudge my family has ever had! Made as is except added walnuts. Even my husband, who doesn't like fudge, kept sneaking pieces. Will be my only chocolate fudge recipe from now on.

Instead of dried cherries, I used one jar of marachino cherries that I chopped coarsely and drained/patted dry very well before folding them into the fudge. Holy frijoles, is this fudge TASTY! We ate it all last night--it's GONE!

I was the hit of last Christmas with this recipe.  It is so easy and can be varried using different dried fruits (love ya Ocean Spray). My first attempt I tried hand chopping the dried cherries but ended up with large chunks in some fudge pieces and others with no cherry at all.  Second time I used my food processor and even though the cherries were minced really small, they were distributed more evenly through the fudge and the cherry flavor really came through in the entire batch.

This is amazing!  Be sure to allow the milk mixture to boil long enough, or your fudge won't set correctly.  Then stir as hard as you can to incorporate the chocolate, marshmallows and cherries.  Delicious, I wish I'd made more!

First of all - make sure that you use a large pot! I used a medium-sized one which seemed to have plenty of room - until I added the remaining ingredients and had trouble stirring it effectively, leaving me with a pot full of chunky, stiff goo. I thought that perhaps next time I would melt the chocolate before adding it to the sugar/milk. In any case, the result did have nice flavours (I used craisins, glace cherries and nuts), but the texture of the fudge is granular and the overall taste is overly sweet. I guess in the end I prefer my old standby recipe for Sweet Marie bars - a much easier and creamy concoction of chocolate, peanutbutter and Rice Krispies.

Made this recipe twice. I make fudge at least once a month for my girls. This recipe didn't make fudge, it made chocolate sauce. I even had brand specific matches for the ingredients both times. It tasted good and wound up being a sauce to go with cheesecake I made for a party, but this doesn't set like fudge.

I now have two favorite fudge recipes that I love from Allrecipes.  I made this recipe exactly, and put the cherries in last and stirred gently like a reviewer said.  I loved this fudge, and I don't like cherries.  It was great after I tasted it!!!

Creamy and full of flavor, I used semisweet chips and cut back on the sugar a little. I was not able to find dark chocolate chips until after I made my fudge. Still very good recipe.

I was very happy with how this recipe turned out. I made it for the Allrecipes Allstars this month. I used juice sweetened dried cherries and did just 1/4 cup as my only change. I also chopped them to a mince. I might add just a tad more next time. I have never made fudge with marshmallow and chocolate chips, and was surprised how much it turned out like what I know as fudge. It was very easy to make also. The most time consuming part was the actual cutting of the fudge. I did take the time to cut it into the 48 pieces. I would make this for a Christmas party or something similar.

This was much easier to put together than other fudge recipes I have made in the past.  I boiled for 4 minutes and consistency came out perfect.  It was  smooth, creamy, and not grainy at all. We thought the chocolate part of the fudge was very good, but, we were not a big fan of the dried fruit.  My family would prefer it just plain chocolate or with some walnuts added.  I will definitely make again - minus the dried cherries.

Ooooh, yummy!  This fudge reminds me of cherry cordial candy, but without the mess and without the cordial.  I followed the recipe exactly, going with a 4 minute boiling time.  The fudge wanted to set up rather quickly, so I used a sheet of waxed paper to smooth out the top, once it was poured up.  Dark chocolate chips is the right choice for this, because semi-sweet or milk chips would make it too sweet, IMO.  In fact, if I were sure it wouldn't affect the candy, I would even cut the sugar back a bit.  Great chocolate fix!

This was pretty good fudge on its own (I don't like cherries) With the cherries, though  my family loved them! This was pretty easy to whip up a batch and I like that it's a pretty dessert that can be made ahead.

I found this recipe good, but it was missing something. Maybe it was that it was dark chocolate and not milk chocolate? Or maybe it was because they were tart cherries instead of sweet? Either way, I still recommend the recipe. I'll play around with it more next time to find out if I'm wrong or not.

Very good and easy to make. Be sure to use a large heavy pot. To make sure the marshmallows melt, add them and stir until they melt before adding the morsels, cherries, and vanilla. Fudge is very easy to cut using a pizza cutter.

Very easy to make. I had no problem with the mixture setting up in 2 hours, but sometimes atmospheric moisture can make a difference. My daughter asked me to make a "plain" batch without the cherries and loved the results. I also made a batch and added 1/8 teaspoon each of ground ancho chili and ground chipotle chili, and a pinch of cayenne when I added the cherries, for a different flavor: warm and only slightly spicy. I think the chilis cut the sweetness while adding depth. That version will make great Christmas presents for my spice-loving friends.

This recipe has a really good chocolate flavor. I had Craisins on hand so I used those instead of the cherries. If I make this again I would use the cherries. The texture wasn't as creamy as I like my fudge to be, but we tend to like a fudge made without marshmallow products. As far as fudge goes, it didn't wow me but it's worth making again.

Very easy to make fudge. I boiled for exactly 5 minutes. My family didn't like the cherries but it was still good and I would make it again without the cherries.

I wasn't sure how this fudge would go over with the family, but they loved it. Creamy and delicious just like fudge should be. I did add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. And I'm very glad I did the flavors went together great. The fudge didn't last very long at the parties I took it to. Yummy!

VERY GOOD!  I used maraschino cherries which I patted dry and microwaved to dry out a little as I didn't have dried cherries.  It turned out excellent!  Chocolate marshmallow is one of my favorite flavors so next time I plan on adding more marshmallows just prior to pouring in the pan to firm.  A definite winner here!  Thanks Nestle!

I am not a fudge person at all, but this fudge has several things going for it. It doesn't require being cooked to a soft ball stage (which I can't do), so it is very easy to make. It is creamy and is NOT dry and crumbly. And it has a nice added flavor with the addition of the dried cherries. In fact, I think it could actually use more cherries in it. A nice addition to the Christmas dessert tray.

Nom nom nom! I'm not normally a big fan of sweets, but this is so decadent! Yes, it's sweet, but IT'S FUDGE!!!  It reminds me of Black Forest cake. Make sure you use dried cherries (not Maraschino cherries or cranberries). Cranberries just aren't the same. Cherries are bigger and a lot more moist than cranberries, with much more flavor.  The fudge is super creamy and rich. A small piece will surely satisfy your craving! As an added bonus, it's very easy to make. I made mine in the evening and let it set overnight. The only change I made (and very minor at that) was that I used vanilla nut extract instead of plain vanilla. It added a nice level of flavor. This is a keeper and perfect for the Holidays!

A creamy and delicious chocolate fudge that is very easy to make.  I didn’t realize I didn’t have enough dried cherries until after I started making it so I added chopped dried apricots which worked out very well.  This is a lovely addition to your Christmas dessert table.

This was easy and came out well. I am not that well versed in making fudge, but I will continue to look for another recipe that might be more like what you buy in the stores (silky smooth texture). It was lovely and really not too much trouble though. Nice addition to my Christmas cookie trays.

This was really good but a little too rich on the chocolate flavor....which is near impossible for me!  I think next time I'll try it with some semi sweet vs all dark chocolate.  I did use Ghiradelli morsels though so maybe they are stronger than Nestlé.

This was so unbelievably good! I did not change the recipe at all and we found it perfect. Not too sweet and the cherry chips were a real nice surprise. The marshmallows melted beautifully if you follow the stir time listed exactly. Use a heavy spoon when you get to the final stage- it comes together quickly!! Very, very good.

I need to make more of this, pronto!  Everyone who tried this commented on how great it was!  I had only tried making fudge once before and it didn't set right, but this set no problems.  I did use semi-sweet morsels instead of dark chocolate because my husband isn't a big fan of dark.  SooOOOOoooo good, both in looks and taste!

It was totally amazing!  Okay, not only amazing but so easy to make-just follow the directions since fudge is tricky, and it all works out.  Loved it!  Keeper for sure.

I used Splinda blend and low fat Condensed milk to trim the kps (approx. 125 kps as apposed to the 154 kps) and it was still  delicious.

I am not a fudge person, but if I were, this would be my go to recipe.  I added extra cherries as that is the best part IMHO.

The taste of the fudge was great.  The taste reminded me of a yummy cordial cherry.  The texture of the fudge after being in the fridge was a little too hard.  If left out to warm to room temperature, it would become too soft.  I could not find a happy medium where the fudge was just right.  I will definitely try this recipe again to make sure it was not an error on my part when I made it originally that affected its setting.
