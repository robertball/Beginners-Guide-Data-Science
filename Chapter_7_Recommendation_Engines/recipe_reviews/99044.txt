Excellent! Years ago my husband got me hooked on dipping fries in mayo - who knew?  Well, the addition of red wine vinegar was great and gave it such a nice tang! Great recipe!

I used malt vinegar instead. This was good, pretty much like a salad dressing.

A friend of mine serves this sauce with asparagus, I didn't realize it actually had a name.  My family calls it green sauce because they will only eat asparagus and artichokes if I make this too.  However I don't use the salt, it is great without it.

Wow!! This is amazing. I can't believe how much flavor the vinegar gave the mayo. I dipped it in frys. I think this would be good on fish. It tastes like a malt vinegar. Thanks for posting.

I used white vinegar, but I'm thinking I should have used apple cider vinegar instead (never have red wine vinegar on hand). I added a pinch of black pepper. Pretty good, a little goes a long way.

I was looking for a dip for Sweet Potato Fries and thought I would try this one. It was very good but I didn't add the salt. Be sure to chill it for at least an hour as the flavors get better the longer it is chilled.

This is a nice alternative to ketchup. It reminds me of Belgian fry sauce. Thanks!

Surprising great. The whole was greater than the sum of it's parts. Will make again, for sure.

I was kind of unsure about trying this. Never thought of dipping fries in mayo. I absolutely love this.

My husband spent some time in Holland and has been craving ‘frite sauce’ ever since. He said this hit the spot.
