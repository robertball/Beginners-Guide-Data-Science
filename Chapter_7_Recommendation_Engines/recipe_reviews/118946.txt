This is a very peanut buttery shake! It does not need to have the sugar if you don't want to add the extra calories. The shake tastes as good with or without the sugar.

I tried this recipe but made a few modifications to it due to being pre-diabetic.  Instead of ice cream, I used 2 cups non-fat milk.  I also used a dab of honey, and a drizzle of sugar free vanilla creamer as a sweetner.  I put a scoop of soy protein and it turned out wonderful!  You can never go wrong with peanut butter!

Yummy!  We added chocolate syrup and came out with a peanut butter cup ice cream shake.  Very happy taste buds!  So easy for the kids!

I suggest adding more ice cream, or perhaps less milk.

*Its great when 1/2 cup of marshmallow creme is added!

There's no need to add the sugar.  Also, use less milk if you want a thicker consistency.  A very delicous treat!

YUM, YUM, YUM...SO GOOD! I had to use chocolate ice cream because that's all I had, and it was delicious. The proportions were right on and it had a wonderful peanut butter flavor. I topped them with whipped cream and mini peanut butter and chocolate chips. This is definately gonna be made often! Thanks for sharing. :)

My kids would rate this higher than 5 stars if they could. The only change I made was to use 1/4 cup of half and half and 3/4 cup milk. (Trying to squeeze in as many calories as possible). They asked me to put in some chocolate syrup next time.

These shakes were absolutely delicious. Our local movie theater serve pb shakes that my husband loves, so I wanted to duplicate the recipe. This was it! We served them in frosted beer mugs. I like my shakes a little thicker, so next time I'll increase the ice cream to milk ratio, and we will definitely make these again and again.

Wow! The possibilities are endless with this one! We used double chocolate fudge ice cream and peanut butter swirl!! Yum! Will try another flavor next time. The oly thing I would do ahead of time next time is chill the glasses longer. Turns runny on a warm night. Delicious!! Will definately be doing again!!

This taste just like the peanut butter shakes at baskin robbins made with the real peanut butter. I added an extra scoop of ice cream, 1 cup of milk, and deleted the sugar.

I made some changes to this recipe because the original was way too rich for me. This is how I made it.  1/2 cup milk, 3 cups of vanilla ice cream, 1 tbsp. of peanut butter, Crushed up butter finger and chocolate syrup on top :o)  I didn't use sugar.  It was sooooooo good!

This was just an "ok" recipe for me. The shakes had a good consistency but was lacking something and I can't put my finger on it. I will make this again, but will be trying different add-ins. I still prefer my United Dairy Farmer's PB milkshake!

Huge hit with the husband--who loves peanut butter anything. I added a generous squirt of homemade chocolate syrup to the shake ingredients to make it a chocolate peanut butter shake. VERY peanut butter-y. He loved it.

I mainly turned to this recipe to know the amounts of ice cream to milk because I always make them too runny.  I added a little more peanut butter and no sugar, but kept the ice cream and milk amounts. I pulsed it 30 seconds, stirred, then pulsed another 30 seconds and stirred one last time. It was perfect.

YUM! I didn't follow any of the proportions in this recipe just kinda eye balled it but man was it great! Can't believe I hadn't thought of this before. Reminded me of the peanut butter cookie dough ice cream I loved as a kid. I used light vanilla ice cream and no sugar other than that no changes. Can see I'm going to be going through a lot more peanut butter.

OMG so good. I used fat free vanilla ice cream, skim milk and two packets of splenda because I had no sugar and it was awesome. It's probably even better with full fat ingredients. Definitely will make this often.

My boyfriend loved it!! I made some minor changes... we didn't have much ice cream so I made 1 serving but we could have had more ice cream. Instead of the sugar we added chocolate syrup and chocolate malted milk powder.

This is a very good shake!! I have made these now a few times. I have used chocolate ice cream instead and it's just as good that way!! I also tried it adding chocolate syrup and it was really good also!! None of the times did I add the sugar though and they turned out just fine!

I am trying out milkshake recipes this week and craving peanut butter for some reason. I scaled the recipe to one serving. I used Breyers homemade vanilla ice cream flavor and creamy natural peanut butter. It was like combining the flavor of a peanut butter cup with vanilla ice cream, delicious.

I didn't have vanilla ice cream, but I did have home-made chocolate ice cream. I used that. In the end it was quite milky, but I fixed that quickly by adding cool whip. It was delicious!

First time ever having a PB milkshake. Tasty, rich too.  I omitted the sugar and it is plenty sweet.  Perfect ratio of milk/ice cream.  Measure your ice cream, don't just eyeball it and it will come out the perfect consistency.

I used Gone Fishin' Ice cream with crunchy peanut butter. It was really good with a bit of honey added (I used about 1/4 cup). It have it a sweet chocolate candy bar flavor. Definately going to use again!

This is definitely better (and cheaper) than any shake you could buy at a restaurant. I used vanilla soy milk for a richer flavor, and I am glad I omitted the sugar, because it just wasn't necessary. Next time chocolate soy milk might add a subtle chocolate flavor since I'm not a big chocolate fan.

I thought this was one of the best tasting milk shakes I have ever made.  I did drizzle some dark chocolate syrup on top for the peanut butter cup taste effect.

Simply wonderful! This is a great recipe that can easily be modified to suite everyones individual tastes. I prefer a thicker shake so I added more ice cream and decreased the milk. At first I left out the sugar but after I tasted it I realized that it needed it and put it in. I put just a dollop of homemade cocoa whipped cream on top. Absolutely delicious.

My daughter is a peanut butter fanatic.  She was looking for a recipe for a drink using peanut butter and came across this one.  I had all of the ingredients, so I agreed to make it.  Simple and delicious.  I am not a huge peanut butter fan, but I even liked it.  I drizzled the shakes with chocolate syrup and my daughter said that they tasted like a Reeses shake.  Thanks for making her day!

Too rich for me, even without the sugar, but my wife and daughter both liked it.

Amazing! I topped it with chocolate syrup for the Reece twist without changing any of the pure peanut butter flavour. SO good!
