This receipe makes 8 - 10 servings, especially if it is served over couscous!  It adapted easily to a slow cooker: garlic, onion and oil on the bottom (did not pre-cook these), then peppers, carrots and sweet potato. Eggplant around the sides and the tomato and squash on the top--it cooked together beautifully and required only 1 can of broth instead of 3 when cooked this way. I added the garbanzo beans at the very end.

Really delicious and easy, and it made enough to feed an army--but since I'm cooking for one, it means eight days of lunch (including today).  I love how only a quarter teaspoon of spice makes it so flavorful.  My only complaint is that it's maybe a little sweet for my taste, but that can be remedied with a little salt.  Also, a word to the wise--I'd recommend using normal-sized vegetables.  I went all gung-ho on this and got gigantic carrots, and by the same I finished doling the soup out into plastic containers to be frozen, it was all carrots. :)

We loved this! I used butternut squash instead of eggplant and zucchini, and the taste was wonderful.

This recipe was great! Actually tasted very authentic with the exception of not actually cooking in a tagine.. I tried to mimic one of my favorite tagines I had in Morocco, so substituted the eggplant for two large red potatoes and upped the spices to 1/2 tsp. apiece and added saffron. Very good, and definitely feeds an army.

Really great recipe! Perfect for this cold winter night. I made it vegetarian by using vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. I also followed the others' advice: I used ginger, cayenne, and paprika, in addition to the spices listed. I ended up using 1/2 tsp of each (except the cayenne) and I thought it was perfect. And it had just enough kick to it!

This was good! I really love tagine, but had never had a vegetarian version before so I just had to try this. My changes and thoughts: as far as I know, traditional tagine spices are ginger, paprika, cinnamon, cumin, cayenne and saffron so the recipe was missing some - I added 1/2 tsp of each. I used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes (lazy)including the juice and added about 3 cups of shredded cabbage that I needed to get rid of (not traditional, I know but it does such an amazing job soaking up the spices!). I ate this with Syrian bread which I used to scoop the veggies and soak up the broth and it was delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  I, too, added with the other spices ginger, paprika, cayenne, and then I also added curry.  I added 1/2 to 1 tsp of each.  I also upped the other spices to 1/2 to 1 tsp based on personal preference of each spice.  I served it with a side of couscous.  Very good.  It does make enough for an army so I will be freezing the left overs.

good recipe and, yes, makes a lot! I made the following changes:
Added 2 chicken breasts cut up(cooked first w/ the onions and garlic); upped the spices to 1/2tsp each and added ginger and paprika (prob. needed more of all spices); no eggplant or green pepper; 2 zucchinis; can tomatoes; some leftover butternut squash with the sweet potatoes;

served with quinoa.

This turned out really well.  I threw in some sausage that I had to use up, other than that I didn't change anything.  It makes a lot, but you can always freeze some.  Great recipe!

Wow, this was SO good. The flavors were wonderful together. The only thing I might do differently next time is to wait a little longer before adding the zucchini and eggplant, since they turned to mush after 45 minutes of simmering. Maybe I'll add them after the other veggies have cooked for 15 or 20 minutes, or maybe with the chickpeas next time. Oh, and I might reduce the broth by a cup or two. Still, this recipe is great as it is, and I am really looking forward to my leftovers!

This was very good and easy to make. However I doubled+ the spices, used only about 2/3 of the veggies (to make a smaller batch), added a dash of cayenne to balance the sweetness, and served with pearled couscous.

Excellent flavors.  The only change I made was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  I really liked the raisins sweetness with the savory vegetables.

I served this to guests and everyone loved it.  I used my own home made veggie broth and chickpeas.  I also added a little fresh ginger.  I'll definitely make it again.

This was awesome, the only change I made was I left out the eggplant cause my husband doesn’t like it. I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh. Otherwise I fallowed the directions. The spices were a different change of pace.

It's fantastic! Lots of flavor, beautiful color. It's a more adventurous recipe with sweets as savory. We served it  over rice, and even the pickiest family member came back for seconds!

I used vegetable stock rather than chicken.  The spices combine to make sure a rich and savory sauce, my car about friend did not even notice that there was no meat......delicious

Wonderful veggie dish! For anyone short on time, I used a pressure cooker to make this, and it turned out great. Sauté onions, peppers, and garlic, then add the rest of the veggies and spices along with broth. Cover and cook on lowest pressure for two to three whistles. Also, if you can't find sweet potatoes in season, pumpkin pieces are a good substitute.

Awesome recipe.  My husband is Moroccan and vegan.  This recipe was a perfect fit and Ill make it regularly. Its a 10 out of 10. A Dutch Oven is the American Tagine substitute which worked great.  I have several tangines and prefer my dutch oven since it is bigger. Plus broth often bubbles out of my tangine and makes a mess, 

 I left the raisins out.  I added the spices while sautéing the onions, pepper and garlic, instead of  waiting until later as the recipe indicates.  That is how most authentic Moroccan recipes are made.  I served this over Far East boxed Pine Nut couscous. (Not authentic, but it was still so good) Im bringing this to the next pot luck i attend. Spices were perfect.

This was a nice change from a regular veggie stew-but I don't really care for the raisins.  They were like biting into a ball of sugar.  I would also use a different type of bean.  The garbanzo beans stayed too firm to blend with the rest of the stew.  I would try navy beans or cannelloni.

I loved this recipe, though I have made it slightly differently each time I put it together.  I usually reduce the amount of broth substitute canned chopped tomatoes for the fresh and don't drain them.  I also like to cut up some fresh cauliflower and lay across the top to steam and absorb the flavor.  Sometimes I add a bit of mild yellow curry powder and maybe just a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne powder.  I have added plain old cubed white potatoes when I didn't have eggplant, butternut squash cubes or Mexican squash instead of zucchini, and substituted craisins or chopped dried prunes for the raisins.  You can pretty much use what you have and vary the amounts as needed or to taste.  The only veg I didn't like in it was broccoli - it became sort of bitter after cooking. It does make a lot of food; my solution is to share with friends or neighbors!  Enjoy!
