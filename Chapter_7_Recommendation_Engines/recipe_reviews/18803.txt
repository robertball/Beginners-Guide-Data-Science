I used other suggestions and increased the cheese and potatoes; I decreased the milk and added garlic and French-fried onions (see my other reviews for more doubled recipes.) I used 6 medium sized potatoes sliced in the food processor.  After sautéing pork chops in olive oil, I sprinkled with a season salt.  It doesn't matter if it’s a season salt or some sort of rub, just put a spice on it.  Then I took it out of my pan and added the onions with 2 cloves of garlic, sprinkled with paprika and pepper and sautéed. I bet you could increase the onion a bit. I didn't because of the kids.   Don't add salt.  I did one time and it was too salty.  At this point I added the soup and 1/2 of cup of milk only.  Even with six medium sized potatoes, this was enough fluid.  Mix this up, add the potatoes and pour over pork chops that are in my 13 x 9 rectangle stone; cover with foil the first 30 min. and then remove foil, top with 2 cups cheese and sprinkle with French-fried onions and bake 30 more minutes.  I think the key to this recipe is thin chops, covering the dish.  Also, instead of the spices you could probably just ad a can of golden mushroom soup.

This was great with the few minor changes I made.  I used 4 potatoes and sliced them fairly thin- about what you would for scalloped potatoes. Then I used about a cup of chopped onion.  I sliced up 3 boneless porkchops I had and then browned them in olive oil and garlic with lots of fresh ground pepper & garlic salt, took them out, and then threw the potatoes and onions in next, again adding pepper & salt.  I put the potatoes & onions on the bottom of the casserole dish then the pork, then the soup mixture.  Covered with foil, baked for 30 min, added more garlic salt, salt, pepper & a bit of cayenne pepper, and the cheese, recovered and baked for 25 more min.  Delish!  My husband loved it :)

This dish was very good...my whole family enjoyed it.  I followed the advice of some other readers and seasoned the potatoes and meat before cooking, used cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and covered the dish the first 30 minutes.  I also used olive oil to brown the chops.  It may not take the full hour to cook depending on how thick your chops are...be sure to slice your potatoes very thin to be sure they are cooked through..Thank you for sharing...

This was really good with a little tweaking.  I normally don't review something I change up, but this turned out well, and I wanted to make these suggestions:  I tossed the sliced potatoes with salt, pepper, mushroom soup, onions, cheese, and a few tablespoons of melted bacon grease (bacon grease may just be what made it so good).  Skipped the milk.  Just wasn't necessary.  I placed the chops in a casserole dish and dumped the potato mixture on top.  Covered with foil, and cooked in the oven for about an hour, until the potatoes were tender.

Very good and easy.  I used cream of chicken soup, and I seasoned flour with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to dredge my pork chops in before browning.  A light coating of non-stick cooking spray on your baking dish will make clean-up a bit easier.  Make sure you use a flavorful cheese (like sharp cheddar) to add extra taste to the potatoes.  Thanks Wendy for sharing!

I suggest you use a mandoline to slice the potatoes and onions. Also, the second time I prepared this, I browned the onions slightly, along with the porkchops.  It was much better.  I followed the suggestions about seasoning the meat and potatoes prior to cooking as well.

This recipe was extremely easy and flavorful.  I sauteed pork loin chops in olive oil and seasoned with Mrs. Dash -- sliced the potatoes and onions thin on the mandolin and used the roasted garlic cream of mushroom. In addition to the cheese, I used french fried onions -- the new cheesy kind.  That was really the crowning touch.  I also see no reason why this recipe could not be used in the crockpot.  I'm going to try it next time.

Big hit with the family. My four year old was asking for more meat, which she rarely does. The pork was very tender and juicy. Very good recipe. 

I used 1" boneless pork chops and covered the dish for the first thirty minutes. It does seem to be very important to season the potatoes and meat.

I also used the cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic instead of plain. Good move!

I haven't tried it with this recipe but I know this will work based on a similar recipe:
For  variation and some spice, use a jerk rub on the pork or marinate in a jerk marinade before searing. You may also add 1 to 2 tablespoons of Marsala wine to the soup mix(depending on your taste). Instead of chopping the onions, slice them. It provides a good presentation and kids can remove them easier if they want. The jerk seasoning will add some spice, but mostly flavor since the soup will take care of a lot of the heat from the jerk rub.

I made this using 3 pork chops instead of 6. I also used a can of cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom (don't like mushrooms). I kept everything else the same as in the original 5 serving recipe. Very good! This will definitely be a keeper! Thanks!

Easy and very good. I did put salt, pepper and garlic powder on chops before browning. Added some salt and pepper to potatoes also. Husband asked me to make again!

This was really good with a few tweaks. I seasoned both the pork and the potatoes with a mixture of rosemary and paprika. I found I only had to cook it for 45 minutes as I sliced the potatoes quite thinly. I really enjoyed eating this and so did hubby.

Made this one tonight and it was a hit.  The kids loved it, and my fiancee was too busy eating to join in the conversations.  I added minced fresh garlic to the onions, and used the roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup.  I was a little worried that I wouldn't have enough sauce, so I added a little more milk, a splash of chicken broth, and a couple tablespoons of sour cream.  I added some basil to the sauce, due to other reviwers saying it was too bland, but would omit the basil next time as it did not seem to make it better.  I also left out the cheese, as I thought it would make it too greasy.  The kids are picky, so its always good to have them tell me dinner was awesome.

I really liked this one.  I changed a lot of things to fit my world and how it runs, but it turned out really great.  I diced the potatoes...easier for my girls to eat.  And I sprinkled some of that "potato steamers" seasoning on them, and some mozzarella before I layered the rest on...so mine wasn't bland at all, it came out awesome.

Tasty and relatively simple to make - the only arduous part is thinly slicing the potatoes.  I added a finely chopped clove of garlic and a couple splashes of hot sauce for a little extra zip.  My husband loved the pork chops - giving them a really good brown first was essential!  The potatoes were pretty good, but I think next time, I'm just going to bake the pork chops and onions in the casserole, make skin-on mashed baby potatoes and reserve the sauce to put on the potatoes as liberally or conservatively as I want - and I wouldn't have to slice all the potatoes.  The pork chops were soooo good, though.  Thumbs up!

My husband's response to the first bite of pork chop: "Mmmm.  MMMMM. MMMMM!!  Oh, my. . . "  Definitely a winner here.  Who would have thought something this simple could be so tasty?  The recipe didn't specify, so I used red potatoes for this dish.

This just goes to prove that there is nothing new under the sun. I've been making this for years and thought it was my own creation, anyway this is a great recipe. The only thing I do that is different is use sharp cheddar cheese and a liberal amount of Mrs Dash original seasoning. I would also slice the onion into rings, this makes it easier to assemble the casserole.

This recipe is pretty easy & can be easily modified to suit your tastes. I season the chops & potatoes to taste. I did not have a problem with the potatoes cooking, I just sliced them very thin.

After some revisions this was fantastic! My fiance loved this and went back for seconds. I thinly sliced the potatoes and seasoned them when Lawry's season salt, pepper, garlic powder & onions. I did 2 layers of this & seasoned both layers. I seasoned pork with salt & pepper & put in flour (which I added pepper, season salt, & garlic poweder to the flour). I seared on both sides. Put pork on potatoes & then added the cream of mushroom & milk. First 30 min I covered dish. I then added french's fried onions, cheese, & bake uncovered for 30 min. This turned out so flavorful & the pork was very moist.  You have to season this one & it's definitely very good!

Good recipe, you should definitely grease the baking pan though. We were scraping the potatoes out. The pork chops stayed juicy and with just one added teaspoon of garlic powder it was very tasty and quick! Tip: I used my apple corer/peeler/slicer to do the potatoes and it worked great for thin potato pieces.

I've made this a few times, and it turned out great.  The only thing I did differently the second time around is I browned the potatoes in the skillet first so that they don't turn out mushy from baking in the casserole.  I also liked to sautee the onions to bring out the flavor.  It's also very important to make sure not to sear the chops too long, and that the chops are completely covered in soup, otherwise they might dry out.

Excellent! This one is just like the one my mother made. The only thing I would change is the method of cooking. I use my small (5qt) Nesco cooker and the potatoes always come out tender, and the pork chops are cooked to perfection. You can also substitute chicken for the pork - GREAT taste! I have also used "O'Grady's" frozen hashbrown potatoes as well. This is a very versatile recipe.

This recipe got good reviews.  I made it tonight.  It didn't turn out like it was supposed to.  Other than adding some seasonings, I followed the recipe exactly.  After about 45 minutes, my pork chops were done, but the potato/onion mixture was a soupy mess, and the potatoes weren't done (and they were sliced thin).  I had to remove the pork chops and return it to the oven for another 20 minutes.  I returned the pork chops and added the cheese and put back in the oven to let the cheese melt.  This reminded me of a recipe my dad tried years ago from a magazine.  It was called Poor Man's Steak.  Same concept sliced potatoes, onions, and meat.  Except the meat was raw hamburger, and the soup was added without the milk.  This dish tasted good enough to try again, but next time, I will not add the milk...just an additional can of soup.

I made this last night.  After reading some of the reviews I thought I would change a few things.  I added another can of cr of mushroom soup.  I salt and peppered the pork chops.  I browned my onions before browning the pork chops.  Cover the baking dish with tin foil for the initial baking.  It was quite tasty.

Great recipe. I did tweak it a bit. I added fresh mushrooms, garlic and baby carrots.  Also seasoned the potatoes with pepper garlic and adobo Goya. Added some Parmesan cheese and cheddar cheeses the last 30 minutes of cooking and I did cover with foil the whole hour I cooked it. I cooked at 350 degrees for an hour and it was very tasteful and moist. Nothing dry about it. To the soup mix I also seasoned it a bit with red pepper and adobo.

Sliced potatoes very thin (using Pampered Chef slicer).  I recommend using Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup. Delicious meal.

This actually came out quite good, however I made several changes based on previous reviews and the ingredients that I had on hand. I used a can of cream of onion soup and reduced the amount of onion by 1/4 cup. There were just two of us, so I used only two chops with the same amount of potatoes called for, but I used an 8x8 pan. I seasoned the potatoes and pork with garlic powder, salt and pepper before searing. I layered half the potatoes, then half the soup mixture, remaining potatoes, pork chops, then remaining soup mixture. I also used a 4-cheese mexican blend rather than cheddar. Cooking time was the same - the pork was moist & the potatoes were great, plus we had plenty of potatoes left over for the next day's lunch. If you like onion, you would like this variation of the recipe!

Excellent recipe! My husband loved it. To prevent the pork from getting too dry, I covered the baking dish the first 30 mins. I also added a little bit of salt and pepper on the potato and they turned out perfect!

This recipe was very easy to make and had nice flavor.  Be sure to salt & pepper the meat & potatoes or may be kind of blah.  My kids, who are generally picky eaters, liked it.  Definitely a keeper!

This was a super recipe.  Will definitely  make it again.  I added a few more potatoes in the bottom of the dish to feed the 5 of us.  Pork chops were so moist that I could cut them with my fork!

These chops were great and so was the sauce. The potatoes however seemed to get lost. I had a 13x9 pan covered with two layers of sliced potatoes but it was like you had to go searching for them lol. Maybe I sliced them too thin. The chops were tender and juicy and very flavorful. I seasoned them well with salt and pepper and seasoned the potatoes and onions with seasoning salt, pepper and garlic powder. Definitely will make these again but with thicker potato slices.

This recipe is delicious, but i added fresh cut up garlic about 2 to 3 cloves and onions after i brown the chops to the same pan with cooking spray on top of the pork chops, then i use 2 cans of cream of mushroom with 1 1/2 cups of milk with some seasoning salt and pepper and garlic powder it's also good without cheese.

My husband loved this recipe and I thought it was very good too.  As others suggested I used Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup and used 2 cans because my husband loves "gravy" with his food.  Very easy.

We made this for dinner tonight.  I really liked the way the potatoes turned out (using other people's suggestions to cook them in the pan first, as well as cook the onions first), but my kids didn't like the potatoes.  They said they didn't "taste right".  They LOVED the way the meat turned out, but I didn't.  I thought the meat was too dry, and didn't have much taste.  I'm sort of torn on this recipe.  I have a feeling I won't be making this again any time soon.  It's a shame, because it truly was very easy.

Delicious!  We all loved it.  Very simple to make.  Think I'll try previous recommendations and use the roasted garlic in the soup the next time and cover for the first 1/2 hr. to see if the pork will be more tender.  Thanks for a great recipe, Wendy!

This recipe was simple and easy to make.  I read the other reviews and I agree to cut the milk to 1/2 cup.  I browned the chops and also baked everything in a large cast iron skillet which worked perfect.  The only addition I made was adding some cayenne to the pork chops prior to baking.  Very hearty. filling meal that is great for wintertime dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so easy to make and we liked it very much.  If I could give it 4.5 stars, I would. I followed the recipe exactly as written but added salt and pepper to the potatoes and onions  and the pork chops I seasoned with Lawry's Seasoned Salt and fresh cracked pepper. The pork chops were very tender and the sauce thickened up nicely.

This was an okay recipe. Chops were tender but the sauce was way too runny. I did change this a bit by using Bob Evens seasoned home style potatoes because I had some that needed to be used and I'm all about saving steps where I can. They are already diced and seasoned with onion and spices and pre-cooked. The pork chops I seasoned with a bit of sea salt and Konriko's creole seasoning. I think using 1/4 of the milk would have worked better for my taste, I like a thick sauce that sticks and doesn't run all over the plate.

Very tasty! I agree with folks about the seasoning of the chops and potatoes.. I used garlic, Tony Chachere's and a herb blend on both. I also covered the pan the first 30 minutes. I then uncovered and sprinkled a combo of Parmesan and cheddar about 1 cup(cheese it up more if you like) baked another 20-25 minutes at 375. It was so pretty and Carmely brown on top! This is going in the keeper box.

My mother made this recipe for us when I was growing up, she called it "Good John", or something like that.  The only difference is she put french fried onions on top, no cheese, and plenty of black pepper.  Now I make it for my family and everyone loves it.  A definite family favorite.

The pork came out dry and the potatoes were tasty.  I left the cover off for half of the time and I think that's why the pork turned out dry (maybe it was browning the pork first).  I did add a little more spices but only a light sprinkle.  I will try this meal the way it is written and see what difference it makes.

Thought this recipe was a little bland without any spices. I did add some spices to the pork-chops while I browned them, but I think next time I would season the hashbrowns also. Definately needs to cook longer when using the hashbrown potatoes. More like 60 to 65 min. Also think that pork chops should have the bone in them, because they are alot more apt to stay moister with being in the oven so long. This recipe needs a little fine tuning and will be a 5 star recipe, which I will try to do and then re-rate it :) But love the idea of it because it is easy, and my family are pork-chop fans. Definately a good filling meal.

Very good! I used 2 more potatoes as I had 8 pork chops. I also added the soup and milk to the potatoes before I put the pork chops on top. You definately have to add salt and pepper to the potatoes when you layer them or else they will be bland.

Followed some of the suggestions from others and this turned out fantastic.  Seasoned each layer with fresh rosemary, salt and pepper.   Browned the onions with some garlic after browning the pork chops and it created a great flavor.    Very easy to make and great on a cold winter day.

I'm not much of a casserole gal myself, but my family loved this.  I browned the pork chops, then put the potatoes in the pan with a little bit of butter and browned them and pressed down on them before adding the pork and sauce.  It made the potatoes a little brown and crispy on the bottom (not sure if this happens anyway or not).  Very good recipe for a quick and easy meal.

I'll have to make this my new favorite pork chop recipe. My old one was the baked pork chop I recipe from this site. I did make a an adjustment to make it similar to the other recipe. I added 1/2 cup white wine to the sauce as well as another can of mushroom soup.  I also follow the advice of some of the other reviewers and sauted the potatoes and onions before baking them in the sauce.  I think this recipe was better because I liked the addition of the potatoes, and it was a little less time consuming.

Very tasty. In lieu of real onions, I added 1T powdered onion soup mix to the mushroom soup. I also added fried onion crunchies for the last 5 minutes of baking. Make sure to season the chops, and sear them quickly, about 30 seconds each side is all. Don't let them cook. (I used thin chops.) Potatoes have to be chopped/sliced very small as larger pieces won't cook all the way. I shortened the baking time to 20/20 instead of 30/30, and this seemed to work well. I used a pyrex casserole dish and the potatoes didn't stick at all. I didn't cover at all either. Very easy to make, and will definitely do again! :-)

I made this recipe for the first time tonight and I always like to stick to the exact recipe for the first time, and I must say that I was quite disappointed. Normally my husband eats two porks chops every time I make them, but tonight he barely ate one.  The only real flavor seemed to be in the cheese, and even that was pretty bland. I thought the recipe looked too simple to be good, maybe I should have followed some of the suggestions of others before me for the added flavor. . . Sorry, but this won't make it to the normal rotation.

Good basic recipe.  I agree it needs more seasoning and also I altered the cooking.  Here's the details.  I seasoned the potatoes, pre-sauteed the onions, mixed them with the soup and some of the cheese and cooked without the chops for 40 minutes.  Then I added my pre-seasoned/browned chops on top for about 20 minutes.  For the rest of the cheese, I added it to the top of the potatoes as I served them, if requested.  It turned out perfect!  Have fun.

This recipe is very easy to make and uses items I usually have in the cupboard.  To add a little extra flavor, try adding paprika to the sauce.

Recipe is a good base,but it definitely needs seasoning.  Just use salt when browning chops otherwise the other spices will burn before you get a good sear. Add garlic powder and other spices when you layer the potatoes. I put the potatoes on top of the chops  and it kept chops moist as well as letting the potatoes brown nicely when I uncovered for the last 10 minutes.

My family really liked this. I would suggest seasoning the pork chops and potatoes with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and herbs. Sprinkle some cheese on top of potatoes so it adds more flavor for the potatoes. Then more on top of pork chops. Cook onions till tender. Also add a dash of worcestershire sauce to the mushroom and milk. Turns out good everytime!

I made this on a week night just to try something different. It turned out better than expected. I'm not real big on using canned soups, but it was quick and easy, and the chops were as tender as could be.

Trying to find different ways to cook pork chops beside frying and grilling. I tried this last night and I LOVED it. The chops we cooked perfectly and the potatoes, onions and milk/soup mixture make a great scalloped side dish. I did take the advice of other testers and covered in foil for the first 30 mins. I could see this recipe working with chicken breast too!

Just put your choice of spices on it and decrease the milk a little.  I also followed some other suggestions to cover with foil for the first 30 minutes.  Very easy to modify.  I also quartered some bell peppers I had in the fridge and threw them on the top.  They turned out great, and I imagine you can put a few pieces of whatever veggies you got in the fridge on it.

At my boyfriend's request, I made this without ever having it before, and I must say, this is such an easy yet delicious and filling recipe!  The only thing I did differently was that I used EVOO and cut up three to four (nibbling was involved) large pork chops into strips versus full chops.  (He farm raises pork, so they were bone-in, *large* chops.)

So good!! Absolutely delicious. Here's what I did: sliced the potatoes very thin, then chopped an onion. Put the onion in the pan with 3 fresh pressed garlic cloves and the pork chops (I used 4 with bone-in), topped everything with seasoning salt. Once the pork chops were browned, lined my baking dish with foil and a little butter, mixed the potatoes in the same pan as the onion and the juices left from the pork chops, then put the potatoes/onions in the baking dish and topped with the chops and soup mix. At about 25m of baking, topped with lots of cheddar cheese and a few shakes from parmesan container. At 50m in the oven, everything was cooked perfectly. Potatoes had no bite left and the pork chops were still moist.

I think the trick to keeping the pork chops moist is not over-browning and keeping the bone in, because the chops were just right and they were only about 1" thick.

Great recipe. My dad, who is the king of scalloped potatoes and pork chops, loved this meal (he's a tough critic), and so did everyone else who ate it. Hard to believe you can do it all in one dish.

We followed the recipe except we were out of onions.  We substituted onion flakes instead.  When it came out of the oven, it looked wonderful.  However, the pork chops were so tough I couldn't cut mine at all.  Although we cut the potatoes thin with a mandolin, they were not done after an hour.  I covered it all again, added more milk for some moisture, and baked it 1/2 hour longer.  The potatoes were then done, and they were wonderful.  I think it would be better if there was enough sauce to cover the pork chops.  Covering with foil wasn't enough.  We will not make this again.

I think the basic of this recipe was ok - but it definitely needed more flavour. I salt and peppered meat and the potatoes. I also added some old bay and fresh rosmary to the potatoes. Overall my family liked the it, but I was unhappy with the consistency of the sauce. Definitely should have added a few tablespoons of flour to the soup/ milk to make it thicker. It is a nice base to build from.

The pork chops were overcooked, the potatoes were undercooked. I sliced the potatoes thinly, but they really needed another 15 minutes. I had boneless pork chops, about 1 inch thick, but they got too dry. I did add seasoning as other reviewers recommended, and am glad I did. Overall, a good flavor, but I won't make it again.

While this is an easy recipe and the ingredients are simple.. it's just that.. SIMPLE! The potatoes were on the soupy side... but did have a good flavor. The pork chops however were a little dry and blah .. not fond of cooking the cheese for so long. So I guess IF I were to make this again.. I'd put the cheese on during the last few minutes of baking to avoid the crispy cheese and instead be melted and gooey.

I was hoping for a slightly different taste than just the soup. Barely tasted the cheese. It was good though.

I used leftover barbeque pork tenderloin I had grilled the night before, sliced it and used it as the chops. I added fresh chives instead of onions and used the french fried onions on top- it was great! The barbeque flavor worked well with the recipe.

Made this for supper last night.  It was really tasty.  I did saute the onions before adding to the potatoes.  I poured half of the sauce over the potatoes added the pork chops then poured the rest of the sauce over the chops.

I used thinner chops for this recipe, which I sprinkled with lots of garlic powder, seasoned salt and pepper while searing. Used an entire chopped onion and cooked covered for the first 30 minutes. Added french fried onions with the cheese. Delish and thank you, WANTU.

Mixed reviews on this one. You need to make sure you layer your potatoes in a single layer or at least pre cook them. Some of my potatoes were perfectly cooked and others were still raw. Other than that my husband and I thought it tasted very good. My parents thought it was rather bland. I will try this again maybe using a lot more seasoning and pre cooking the potatoes first.

I added salt, pepper and a little garlic salt and I diced the potates instead of slicing them.  Next time I will double the soup and milk to make more gravy to pour over the meat and potatoes. But very good recipe!

This was really tasty and soooo easy to put together!  I made exactly as directed with one exception - I just couldn't put cheese on top of a pork chop.  It didn't matter though - the pork was tender and the potatoes were cooked perfectly (I used a mandolin to slice them thin).  Don't forget to season at every step w/ s&p (on the potatoes when you put them in and on the pork before you brown them).  Great recipe - even without the cheese!

This was okay.  My 4-year-old didn't like it at all, although she's a pretty picky eater.  My husband and I thought it was okay, but I have to agree with other reviewers - the appearance of the dish was very unappealing.  Thanks to other reviewers, I sliced the potatoes thinly and they came out perfect.  I'm not sure I would make this again, though.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I love this recipe.  I have invited several friends over and this is the dinner that I cook and they have all loved it.  One thing that I do to add a little flavor is I cook some of the onion with the pork chops.  I also put a little garlic powder with the chops and onions.  It makes this meal even more flavorful!

This was a decent recipe - a good starter.  I added a few spices and some garlic and I still thought it needed a little something.  I didn;t care for the potatoes - but that may have just been the potatoes I had - they tasted a little earthy or something - maybe it was the soup - next time I might try it with cream of chicken instead and see if I like it better.  Definetely a good homestyle meal.  I will make it again but try and tweek a little.

The chops were great. Very tender and had a great taste. However I changed the recipe up a bit and the potatoes where still a bit bland to my taste. I sprinkled the chops with Season All before searing them. Also I used the Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic and still thought the potatoes weren't all that great. I think next time I will add garlic and sprinkle the potatoes and onions with a lot more seasoning.

My husband loved the flavor and even went back for seconds so I'll definitely make this again.  However, I'd use thinner cut pork chops as an hour wasn't enough to cook through the ones I used- they were about an inch thick.  After I cooked them longer, they were pretty dry.

This was great. I changed a few things but a great recipe! I baked the potatoes (seasoned) for about 40 minutes before adding the pork chops (which I also seasoned and just lightly seared on each side).Then I sauteed the onions along with some fresh sliced mushrooms and than added it to the soup. Yummy!!

I did alter this a bit, to suit the ingredients I had on hand.  I had made a pork roast this weekend (kalua pork from this webpage) and had lots of leftovers, so instead of pork chops I used shredded leftover roast, and had to leave the onions out since my kids dont like them.  It turned out good, nothing fancy and sometimes that is exactly what you want.  Kids and husband all ate it happily, and it was inexpensive and easy to make with items on hand.  Thank you.

This recipe was very easy and turned out great. My whole family raved over it. I thought it might be bland, so I seasoned the pork chops with seasoning salt and pepper before searing them.  But the potatoes were the real hit of this casserole. I could leave out the pork chops and use this simple recipe for great scalloped potatoes. This will be a regular in my house.

I was not happy with this at all. The only thing I did different was use bone in porkchops. Maybe that made the difference. We had leftovers that ended up in the trash. That never happens here, we always eat our leftovers. It just did not taste good. I will continue my search for different ways to prepare porkchops. The kids didn't like them either and only picked at their plates that night

Wonderful, I have made similar dishes, but always seem to make it too soupy or too thick.  Nice the have the correct proportions for the sauce.

I was very impressed with this.  If my 3 year old daughter says, "Mommy, I love this meat!", then this dish is definitely a 5 star recipe!  Hubby and I couldn't get over how tender the pork chops were, even after re-heating the leftovers!  The only drawback was that even though I pre-seasoned the potatoes, they were still kinda' bland.  But I think that maybe I shoulda' bought a different kind.  Also, seasoning the pork chops before browning is a must!

This dish was not as good as it sounded.  Using the thicker pork chops may have been the reason.  Not very tasty to me.  My husband said it was just "O.K.", although my little guy loved it.  It continues to get super reviews, so don't let my review discourage you.  Enjoy!

My family really loved this recipe.  I took previous suggestions and used the mushroom soup with roasted garlic, as well as covering the dish for the first 30 minutes.  Delicious!  I am always looking for quick and easy pork recipes.  Thank you!

After reading so many comments I made small changes. Seared the chops with the onions. We like a little heat so I used a little Cajun Seasoning, Black Pepper, and Cayenne Pepper on the chops. Added minced garlic on top of the potatoes then the chops. Everything else the same from there.  I will share that I only had 3 fresh potatoes so I used a can of Del Monte Fresh Cut Sliced New Potatoes and could not tell the difference.  Came out delicious!

3.5 stars.  I avoid recipes that rely on cans of soup as one of the ingredients, I would rather make my own roux, sauce, gravy, etc.  I sliced the potatoes thin, covered the dish for the full hour and still the potatoes were slightly underdone.  I used the full cup of milk because I knew the dish would need the liquid to cook the potatoes.  I seasoned the chops and dredged them in a light coating of flour before searing them.  Over all...the dish was okay.  I may make it again, but it didn't knock my socks off.

I will make it again. I don't slice the potatoes. I use baby red potatoes. When the taters are done to my liking and the chops can be sliced with a fork, it's time for dinner. Been eating it for many years. Is in most midwest church cookbooks.

I was looking for a new/different way to make a pork chop dinner, and I came across this recipe. It was fabulous! So easy to make too. Very few ingredients, and the flavor; excellent. This is a definite repeat recipe for me.

I made it with 2 one inch pork chops so I cut the time down to 20 minutes, but I think the cheese should be added in  from the start because they dried out a bit.  And soup was a little too soupy.  But very tasty.

This definitely needs some help. Season the potatoes and pork chops for sure. Add cheese in between the layers of potatoes. Increase the milk by 1/4-1/2c. Add Panko on top of the cheese in the last step. The concept is good-the flavor needs help.

This was easy to put together and very good. Did need to season with salt and pepper, would suggest adding to taste before baking.

Super easy and tasty. After reading other reviews i: seasoned the meat and potatoes with salt, pepper, garlic and onion; added cheese in the soup/milk sauce; added the porkchops for the last 20 min of bake time only.
Hubby and I both loved it!

I always read the reviews because I lack the courage of more experienced cooks to tinker with things.  I used Lowreys on the chops before I cooked them.  I always use it with pork.  I used an whole onion and sauteed it with garlic and added pepper only and paprika.  I used a whole cup of mile and not a half.  I did not add any salt and it was fine.  And I like my salt.  I mixed the cheese in with the soup which is something we always do as we don't like toppings.  And I used extra potatoes an d could have used even more.  It was terrific.  I will make this many times.

I took this recipe and combined it with the Parmesan Sage Pork Chops from all recipes and it was delish. Sliced the potatoes  then browned the chops with the parmesan crusted  coating. Baked with the soup and milk mixture. Perfect

Will definitely make it again!  However, the recipe does not call for seasoning the chops before you sear them and you should always season meat when searing it, especially in a recipe like this where there isn't a lot of flavor in the other ingredients.  My husband used a blended seasoning for pork on the pork steak we used instead of chops.  Also, added french fried onions on top when added the cheese. Yum!!

I would recommend adding the soup only without the milk.  It was almost too runny as it was without the milk.

I would definitely make this again. It did seem a bit "oniony" for my taste, so will saute the onions prior to baking as one reviewer suggested. This dish is very close to one my mother-in-law used to make. It is delicious.

My mom made this for years and it is comfort food for the winter. I followed others advice and did not add the water. When I seared the meat, I seasoned it with seasoning salt, pepper and paprika and added a 1/2 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce to the mushroom soup. The paprika gave it a nice golden hue when it was done. We lapped up the leftover gravy with bread after all the spuds and meat were gone. Thank you,  I am a little too full now.

I’m amused by the words “creamy mushroom sauce”. It’s a can of cream of mushroom soup with a little milk. Gross. Why not make mushroom gravy from mushrooms and butter? And use the pork chop skillet ?
I did. It was good.

I precooked the potatoes in the microwave, so I could cut down on time in the oven.  I also seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper before searing them.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  My husband said he liked it, which is saying A LOT!

Yummy! I did sauté the potatoes and onions a bit in the pan that I seared the pork in before adding them to the casserole dish. I also completely forgot to mix milk with the soup, but it is still so so yummy!!

Loved it! I even used soy milk and dairy free cheddar. My pork got a little dry but I probably overcooked them on the stove. The second time I cooked it in the slow cooker and then baked it with the cheese to look pretty.

The flavor was really good and the pork chop was tender, but the potatoes did not cook all the way through.  I think maybe should precook the potatoes a bit.

It was fantastic and easy.  I followed the suggestions of a few others.  I seasoned the potatoes once they were on the bottom of the pan (any kind of seasoning you prefer).  The most important part and the best part was caramelizing the onions.  I used one whole onion but next time I will use two.   I also seasoned the pork chops while they were browning.  I used bone in chops and they were an inch thick, but they were tender cooking them this way.  Also added the cheese the last 30 minutes.  I did cook them with foil on for the first 30 min.  Will make this again and again maybe even substituting chicken breasts.  Delicious!!!!!

My hubby loved it. Begged me to make it when his brother and girlfriend visit:) I used coconut cream instead of cream of mushroom because he doesn’t like mushrooms. Marinated pork chops and seared. Mandolin slicer is an absolute must for this one. Will be making plenty of these. Thank you for the recipe.

Easy, tasty & such a pretty casserole.  I only added mushrooms with the onions & a 1/4 cup veg. broth to the liquid.  The rest of the recipe I followed without change.  The more seasoning the better!

I really liked this dish but hubby liked it less than I. It was easy and I thought very flavorful. The cheese made a big difference. I made the dish as stated. It took only minutes to prepare. I think I will make it again but put some other seasoning on the pork chops other than salt and pepper.

This was absolutely delicious and I don't even LIKE port chops normally.. The only change I made was I dredged the chops lightly in flour before I seared them in the skillet it made a lightly brown crust that really set off the taste of the cheese after they were done.. Also I didn't have normal shredded cheddar so I used what I had which was Taco blend cheese of Monterrey Jack and Cheddar cheese mixed.. absolutely wonderful stuff.. I will absolutely make these again. Hubby raved over them because he is a meat and potatoes kind of guy.

My husband & I liked it but the pork chops were a little dry. Next time I will not brown them first, I will place them in the dish raw and cover with the potatoes etc. This should make them moist. Very tasty recipe... will make again

I made this as-is and I wish I had read some of the reviews about baking time first. I took the chops out and kept cooking the potatoes for almost another hour. I had sliced them with a mandoline and they were thin, but for some reason, took a long time to finish cooking. Great idea, though. I'll make scalloped potatoes again and put chops on top - but will know for next time about additional seasoning and cooking time. Thanks for a tasty treat.

Very easy recipe! The only thing I did differently was mushroom soup with roasted garlic as suggested in some of the reviews. My husband doesn't really like pork chops because he says they are always too dry....he loved this recipe. We reheated the leftovers a few days later and he thought it tasted even better!

Good flavors and sauce but it wasn't cooked throughly. It needs to be covered, otherwise pork dries.

I used one pound of thinly sliced pork because it  was all I had but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written. For some reason the water from the milk and mushroom sauce separated, leaving a large pool of water in the bottom of the pan. 
I will make this again but maybe cook the sauce in the potatoes for the first 30 minutes and then add the pork and cheese in the final 30 minutes.

I made it just as the recipe shows except I added some cheese to the soup and milk mixture.  I made sure to slice the potatos very thin with a mandolin and it turned out perfect in an hour. Delicious and the chops were very tender. Will keep this easy and quick recipe. Oh and I used thin cut bone in pork chops and additional seasonings.

I used boneless pork chops, and wasn't thrilled with the chops - but the potatoes are outstanding!  Following other reviewers' hints, I used my food processor to thinly slice the potatoes.  I also used only 1/2 cup of milk, which was perfect.  I put the chops on the bottom of the pan, then poured the potatoes mixed with the sauce on top.  After the first 30 minutes of baking with foil on it, I removed the foil and sprinkled French fried onions on top, then cheddar cheese.  I did have to put the foil back on after 10 minutes, as the cheese and crunchy onions began to brown too much.  I will definitely make this again - but without the chops, and just serve it as a delicious side dish!

I added some yellow bell pepper, chopped. I sautéed the onion and pepper in the skillet before searing the chops. I seasoned the chops with garlic salt and pepper; used the same seasoning in the soup mixture and did everything else as the recipe states. Delicious!!

We loved it, I did not use any onions and at the 30 minute point I added some frozen green beans.  We will be making this again, but I will probably wait to put the cheese on until there is 10 minutes left

Major comfort food.  I added a touch of dry sherry to the soup mixture and Lawry's garlic salt to season the pork and potatoes.   I also sauted the sliced onions in the pan after browning the chops.  Used a mandoline  to slice the potatoes and onions.  I will make this again this winter.

After making some adjustments that others suggested this dish turned out great.  I added and sauteed chopped onions and 2 cloves of sliced garlic to the pan after browning the chops.  Then I added the soup etc.  I will make again!

This recipe is really good. The chops were boneless and covered in foil for the first 30 minutes. The next 30 minutes they were uncovered. I would probably decrease the cooking time because the chops seemed like they were a little overdone, even though they were very thick chops. I did add garlic. I will read the other reviews and perhaps incorporate their suggestions for more tender chops. Thank you for a great recipe that does not take a lot of time to prepare.

Very good, even my son liked it. Before I could even get it all served I hear from the table "delicious!" Followed the recipe exactly the first time. Last night I took others advice and added more potatoes and cheese as well as added some crispy fried onions on top. Was even better. This goes in the rotation for sure.

This meal was great.  My wife isn't a big fan of pork chops or anything with the word casserole in its name, but she was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it.  Will definitely eat it again.  Only thing I did differently was sear the pork with salt and pepper on it and added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the potatoes.

Nice change from the rice! Adding garlic, more onion(and sauteing them), seasoning salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper really was great. Covering during cooking is helpful for even cooking and to get all cooked through. The cheese at the end is delectable! I used medium thick boneless chops and they remained moist.

Everyone loved these chops. But next time i think i'll add some carrots. Mandoline works great and sliced the onions the same size and placed them on top of tators. I used 6 large tators and 1 medium onion.

This was very good, especially the potatoes. We used bone-in chops because that's what we had on hand. Hand-sliced the potatoes as thin as I could get them. I seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper before searing them. And the potatoes with salt and pepper. I added less milk to the cream of mushroom soup per other suggestions in the comments. But I think it would have been fine leaving it as written in the instructions. And I added a  ton of cheese. Definitely more than a cup, but that's just fine with me. I ended up only leaving it in 15 minutes after the cheese was added because it was browning and I didn't want the porkchops too done. It was very tasty!

Family loved it! I used almost twice the  potatoes called for.  You need to season well or it will be bland. I liberally sprinkled seasoned salt and pepper on the potatoes and mixed them well. I dredged the pork chops in flour seasoned with a little Cajun seasoning. After the chops were seared I added the milk (or half and half), a can of mushrooms and the mushroom soup and heated it thru. I needed a little broth too. Turned out great!

I used this recipe as a base model and made some changes. I cubed my potatoes and tossed with chopped onion. I laid them down in the pan, topped with a generous amount of fresh broccoli florets, sprinkled 1 cup of triple cheddar blend shredded cheese, topped with thick cut pork chops. I mixed onion soup mix into the soup and milk mixture and poured that over the top. I baked for one hour. Came out absolutely fantastic. My husband and I are both in love with the dish.

This came out well.  It was good, comfort food for me. I sprinkled the pork chops with Creole Seasoning (from this site). I sliced the potatoes very thin, almost too thin, as they came out a bit mushy. I used half milk and half sour cream. It made it nice and creamy. I added the cheese the last 15 minutes and I also sprinkled with a few French fried onions.

Sometimes a one pan casserole is what it's all about. I don't usually use canned creamed soups (homemade is the bomb!) but when time is of the essence for a working gal then can come in handy on occasion. One of my favorite potatoes is augratin so I added a little cheese to the soup and milk mixture. My pork chops were only around 1/2” thick so I knew I wouldn't be baking them for the full 60 minutes called for or they would be dry, especially after being seared. 

I buttered my baking dish before adding the potatoes and onion and poured about 1-1/2 cups of the soup mixture over potatoes. Baked for 20 minutes before adding the pork chops. I lined the seared pork chops (only used 4 and they fit perfectly) along the center of my dish and added another ½ cup of the sauce down the center of the pork chops, not covering the whole chop. Added cheese on top of that sauce and sprinkled on the potatoes that were showing. I did not coat the whole dish with the sauce and cheese. It made  pretty presentation this way. I baked for 30 additional minutes after adding the pork chops. After taking the dish out of the oven I let it set for about 10-15 minutes before eating. The sauce thickened nicely, the potatoes were perfectly cooked but the pork chops were a tad dry. If I made again I would shorten the cooking time or use thicker chops.

This doesn't call for any seasonings and some may be tempted to use at least salt and pepper. I did add pepper to the pork chops when I seared them but cho

I am not a fan of canned cream soups, but, I needed to get something in the oven without much prep and this fit the bill.   I could tell by the ingredient list this would be a little bland for us, so, I added seasoned salt & pepper to the pork chops and seared them in a skillet before layering in the casserole.  I also added some pepper and a light sprinkle of salt to the potatoes and onions.  I didn't add too much because I knew the soup was salty. I prepared the rest of the recipe as is and kept the cooking method the same. I let it stand about 10 minutes after I took it out of the oven and it set up fine.   I wouldn't make this on a regular basis, but, it was a hearty meal on a cool night and the pork chops were tender and flavorful.  Bonus, the husband liked it!

I browned the pork chops as directed   I mixed all of the rest with the potatoes in a mixing bowl.  Added 1/2 cup ranch dressing.  Put the potato mixture in the baking dish and put the pork chops on top with a little shredded cheese on top.  Covered it with tinfoil and baked for one hour.  OMG!  Everyone loved it and everyone went back for seconds.  This is definitely a keeper in our house.  So easy and so good!

I kept everything the same, except we used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar and I would stick with that - the flavor of the mozzarella with the mushroom sauce was perfect!  Oh - I also sprinkled some basil over the potatoes and onions before putting the pork chops on them.  Delicious!

This was a huge hit, very easy to make. Added some minced garlic, Mrs. Dash and French fried onions as others suggested and it really kicks up the flavor. The pork chops stayed nice and moist and tender. The only downside is it is high sodium. Will make this on a regular basis. It goes really well with roasted asparagus.

I used 4 very thick boneless pork chops and cut them in half so they were not so thick. I followed the recipe pretty closely except using granulated garlic, and Montreal spice after searing the meat. I also reduced the milk it about half a cup.

Super easy to make and delicious. My 1  almost two year old even loves this dish. What I did different  is seasoned the pork chops before browning and i used an entire medium onion. Also recommend adding more potatoes and another chop. only three of us in my household and not a drop is left.

Have made this twice and it was a home run both times. I sliced the potatoes with my mandoline on a medium slice, did the same with the onion. After braising the chops (that I sliced 1/4 thick) I browned the taters and onions before adding to the 13x9. Used a bit more cheddar  too. Easy meal and very satisfying.

Made a major tweek and did it with rice.  Was amazing.  Not a big potatoe eater so used cream of mushroom, can of water and can of rice, added chives and onions.  Will do this at least once a month.  Baked same amount of time and did everything else the same except cooked in a covered skillet.

I would call this a comfort food recipe. We enjoyed it very much. I cut the recipe in half and used cream of celery soup in place of the cream of mushroom soup.

Very good. My son loved it.

I made this and it is absolutely AMAZING.  I may either cook it slightly longer or cut the potatoes thinner as they were still a bit firm but we still devoured it all. 
I served it with garlic roasted asparagus (first time) and that was a hit as well.
So grateful for this site and the gluten free options. This was not gluten free with the cream of mushroom soup but I just replaced it with a "cream of anything" recipe which was gluten free.

Made exactly as recipe stated except I added seasoning salt on top of the potatoes. I did not cover it. Next time I will add more potatoes and use a few more pork chops as the ones I had were a bit small. Also I will be adding more cheese.

I made changes as per the reviews by reducing milk and adding potatoes and onions. I also deglazed the pan with the soup and milk to get all of the bits from the chops.  I added French fried onions on top of the cheese.  It was pretty good with the changes.

Very good basic recipe. I always make a recipe as written the first time and found that this needed some tweaking for added flavor. Added garlic salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper to the sauce and topped with cheddar jack cheese instead of plain cheddar. Also added some crushed Ritz crackers on top for the last 15 minutes of baking.  As others suggest; cover with foil for the first 30 minutes and bake uncovered after putting the cheese on.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Family loved this when I made it. There's only three of us so I reduced some of the ingredients. 3 potatoes, 1/2 an onion and 4 pork chops. I kept everything else the same, still worked the same with cooking time and everything. I did season the pork chops before I seared them, simply used seasoned salt. Gave the pork chops just a little more flavor. I will be absolutely be making this again!

Made this tonight and the whole family enjoyed it. The only changes I made were I seasoned the potatoes and I also put flour, montreal steak seasoning, salt and pepper in a baggie and shook the pork chops in it before I browned them.  I covered it with foil for 30 minutes, then removed it and added the cheese and some homemade french fried onions.  It was really delicious.

Made this today and it is delicious.  I made a couple of changes based on the reviews here.  I used 1/2 cup milk and 1 cup onions.  I made a mistake on the potatoe slices. I didn't read the receipe correctly and only used 1 very large russet baking potatoe instead of 4 but it worked OK  When I make it again I will use more potatoes but it did not seem to affect the final taste.  I cooked the pork chope my usual way and added:  butt rub and Arizona spice.

I gave this 4 stars as it was really good, but it could use a seasonings to bring out more of the good flavor it already had, just to give it that oomph, even if its only seasoning salt. But my really picky eater ate it up, which is a big surprise.

I season the potatoes with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder then put half the potatoes in and put thin slices of velvetta cheese and add the rest of my potatoes when adding the shredded cheddar I remove the chops and cover all the potatoes then put my chops on and cover them too. I love this recipe it can take real tough chops and make them so tender! Another recipe I make a lot!

This was a good dish. My husband went for seconds...yay! I did do three things different. I added garlic to the dish, I added Basil and Marjoram, and I didn't brown the pork chops. The only negative part of this dish was watching to make sure that the milk doesn't separate. Perhaps a little lower temperature (preventing milk proteins from becoming a binded glob), adding a starch (flour or corn starch), or even exchanging the milk for....dare I say it....heavy cream (ahh, my hips are screaming!). Otherwise, thanks for the great supper, I'll make this again.

YUM!
I did a little tweaking... Firstly I used organic pork cutlets. Salt and pepper each, dip into flour, egg and breadcrumbs (like you would a cutlet) fry each.  For a healthier option use coconut oil - 1-2 tbs. as needed.
Place in casserole dish and cover with the thinly sliced potatoes, and onions followed by the soup mix and cheese.
My family devoured the whole thing...I was lucky to get a bite.

I did season my meat before cooking. I added some broccoli on top of my potatoes. I used a half of can of water instead of milk and stirred in season blend in my bowl with the can of condensed soup and water before pouring it over my meat and veggies..  i cooked it about 45 minutes before putting cheese on it  and returning it to oven for 20 min more...

Feeding a family of six and we all loved it.
So easy, I only added garlic.  This will definitely be a regular at our table.

My family loved this. Definitely one I will save. I did add additional seasoning.  Other reviews helped me decide that a little additional seasoned salt would enhance the flavor.

Potatoes need more time, and not overly flavorful, so the recipe needs some tweaking, but not a complete waste of time.  It has potential.

My husband loved this meal. Pork chops,  potatoes and cheese, what's not to love. I did add some Madeira wine, as suggested and I sauteed the onions a bit. How thick should the chops be? I was a bit concerned about 1 to 1 1/2 inch chops getting done. So I split mine, made 2 into 4, and they were a bit overdone. Entirely my fault. I will make this again, great comfort food.

Made this lasr night and we loved it, although I was a little skeptical about cheese on pork chops it was great. I put my own twist on it I used a pack of chive and bacon seasoning for potatoes and sprinkled it over them before I added the porchops. I also lightly seasoned the chops with seasoned salt and black proper.

I thought it was good overall, definitely season the pork and potatoes before putting them in the oven! I also suggest frying the potatoes a bit before oven to cut down cooking time. My picky hubby loved this!

I love this recipe, but I find 4 chops is enough with the amount of ingredients, and I thinly slice the onion rings instead of chopping it.

i just made this for dinner for myself and my super finicky boyfriend. i used a few suggestions, such as browning and seasoning the potatoes, onions and pork prior to cooking. i also used a lot more seasoning; season salt, garlic salt and minced garlic. i did cover with foil for the first 30 minutes. it came out SO delicious! i loved it. big hit. i used very thin boneless pork chops and thinly sliced russets, also way more onion than called for.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. It is similar to something my mom used to make when I was a kid.   Just a couple changes I made. Rather than porkchops I used chicken. I had to cook it a little bit longer but it was worth the wait. And I add some veggies, Carrots and corn. Everyone loved it!!

We enjoyed this dish very much. I bried the pork chops for 45 minutes, then salted each row of potatoes. I mixed up the cheese with cheddar and mozzerella. I wanted to add garlic to the onion mixture that I fried after I fried the pork chops, but I forgot. I'll do that next time. Great recipe, we will make this often.

I made this for dinner tinight & it was delicious.   The only change I made was to add chopped garlic with the onion.   I also baked it for 30 minutes, added the cheese @ put it under the grill until it was brown.  It was great.

While I was hesitant about putting cheese on a pork chop, this recipe was excellent.  I subsituted cream of celery soup for cream of mushroom.  Everyone loved it!

For the 108th time, this recipe is dull with no changes. I used a Pork Lion and sliced it into 6 servings seasoned it well then sliced and seasoned Onions and Yukon Gold Potatoes. Using the suggestions of others, I sautéed my potatoes/onions which were already thin and it caused them to be overcooked in the finished dish. Overall I like the meal-in-one idea and the pork was very tender; my only problem was overdone potatoes. I would recommend trying this dish only if you have ingredients on hand and most importantly SEASON YOUR PORK/POTATOS/ONIONS prior to cooking(I used a combo of garlic powder w/ parsley, red pepper and salt)!

Qucik, easy and simple.  I made this for dinner last night.  Followed the recipe but had bone in pok chops and fried it for 2-3 min each side and it turned out very good.  My husband loved it.  I will try this recipe again.

Quick & Easy and tasty.  Before browning the pork I put garlic powder, pepper & salt to give it flavor and seared with oil & butter & the onions. Cooked at 350 for the hour, thought 400 was too much & would dry out the pork. Family enjoyed it too.

I followed the recipe exactly as is and I thought it was pretty good. The pork chops were slightly dry, but the sauce helped.  Next time I might let the potatoes cook a bit before putting the pork chops in.

This recipe was great! It was an easy one dish recipe. The pork chops turned out very moist. My husband even loved it. Nothing fancy, just a good meat and potatoes meal.

I'll definitely make this again because my husband enjoyed it.  I thought it was just okay, nothing special.  I followed the directions and everything turned out fine.  The key is to slice the potatoes thin.  I also covered the dish with foil for the entire time.  Thanks, Wendy.

This was really good.  I used Yukon gold potatoes (about 6 small) and 4 center cut boneless chops (thick).  My only changes would be to season the chops, add some garlic to the sauce and cut the cutting time WAY down for the pork.  Maybe 45 minutes for the potatoes and onions, then throw on the chops for about 15-20.  Other than dry chops, the recipe turned out great!

This is very good. Will make it again. I adapted a few things which worked really well. After I seared the chops I cut them into bite size pieces before adding to the baking dish. I sauteed the onion with fresh mushrooms in a skillet first, and used up some Mexican flavored cheese I had in the fridge.

We could feel our arteries clogging with each bite and it wasn't worth it because it didn't even taste good.  We even added some veggies to make it better, but they really just didn't soak up enough of the grease it was swimming in.  We're deleting this from our recipe box immediately.

This recipe is so easy and delicious!  I only has to make a few changes: I seasoned the potatoes with garlic powder, salt and pepper, added a few cloves of garlic to the soup mixture, and as others suggested, covered the dish for the first 30 minutes.  It turned out wonderful.  Will definately make this again!

Made this for my family last night.  It went over pretty well.  Next time I will use mushroom soup with roasted garlic and be sure to season the potatoes before baking.  Over all this was a pretty good recipe.  With a little fine tuning I think it will be great.
