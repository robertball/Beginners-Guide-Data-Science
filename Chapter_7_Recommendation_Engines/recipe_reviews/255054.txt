I followed the recipe as written and I didn't think they tasted anything like a Mounds Bar or even reminiscent to one. They were a bit chewy, a bit on the dry side. Just didn't care for them.

They are brownies, so they can't be "bad". However, I wasn't very impressed. The coconut flavor wasn't very strong. I had to cook them longer than the recipe stated.
