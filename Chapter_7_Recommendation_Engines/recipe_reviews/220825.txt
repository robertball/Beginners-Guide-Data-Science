No sweetener necessary, even for kids' tastes, and certainly "spa"-healthier without! Frozen grapes are awesome just by themselves... They're like little natural popsicles!

"Spectacular" little recipe! Ya just gotta love it when a few items you have laying around the kitchen turn into something a little extra special...  I've frozen fruit before, but never grapes. And while they're delicious with or without sugar - that addition gave regular 'ol grapes a little pizzaz.  I did use less sugar than called for and opted for Spenda which made the amount even less.  This was so easy and tasted oh so good - very nice little treat without any guilt.

Never mind the sugar and put them on long skewers for a fun treat.  They freeze beautifully and certainly are delicious.

Really pretty and oh so tasty - I didn't use nearly as much sugar as called for - maybe 1 teaspoon total - This was just enough to give the grapes that crystal effect - they actually taste a bit like a sorbet.  Thanks for a fun idea.

Agree that no sugar is needed.  I freeze them in snack-sized zip lock bags so so we can grab individual servings on the go (although you must eat them before they completely defrost or they will be mushy).

Awesome.  We really enjoyed this sugary frozen treat on a hot evening.  No need to even complete steps 4 and 5.  The grapes went straight into the freezer inside the resealable bag.  Easy and delicious!

Our grapes were extra sweet, so we didn't use sugar. This is something we actually do quite often. Just sticking them in the freezer and getting them out two hours later works well for snacks. Mmmmmm.

You can also put the frozen grapes in a glass of sangria, and it won't water it down like ice cubes.  Yum!

I really wanted to love this recipe, but I just couldn't... The sugar was clumpy and the whole thing just ended up being too sweet.  Maybe I'll try the powdered jello as another review suggested....

Well, I really wanted to like this and love the idea of it.  And honestly, the taste was good...but I could not get past the texture of the grapes.  I am not usually very texture-sensitive, but something about the frozen grapes and chewy insides really turned me off.  If the texture won't bother you, go for it.

I don't know what I was expecting, but I didn't care for the texture of the frozen grape and wonder why the sugar is necessary.  May if they were soaked in vodka I would get it ;)  fun idea. Thanks anyways.

I've been freezing grapes for years. NO SUGAR necessary! I recommend this to my girlfriends who are dealing with night-sweats. It is also a great way to extend the life of grapes. If grapes begin to show a little too much ripe-ness, rewash and individually bag approximately 10-20 grapes per zip-lock bag. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!, especially in the middle of the night when you wake up in a puddle of sweat.

Just wash and freeze. Kids and adults will be addicted. Grapes are sweet enough, and the sugar is never missed!

There is absolutely no need to add sugar. Grapes are plenty sweet. I just rinse my grapes off, into ziploc (or similar) bag, into freezer. Then i just pop 'em in my mouth at the pool, in front of the tv, whenever i want a cold refreshing healthy snack.

We really enjoyed these. Nice to have a somewhat healthy snack. My daughter and I preferred the red grapes as they were sweeter and the skin didn't seem as thick. I think the next time I will make them with all red grapes.

Unlike others I have never tried this.  I took the suggestion from other reviews and cut the sugar.  These turned out great.
They look great also.  I can think of several possibilities for these grapes.

Much too sweet, and ended up being very messy as well. On the plus side, my daughter tried regular frozen grapes without the sugar and now loves them!

Have you ever tried all natural frozen cotton candy flavored grapes? You can find the cotton candy grapes at some HEB stores and at Sam's. They are so delicious to eat cold and a extra bonus frozen!!

I put the grapes in whipped egg whites first so the sugar coats them easily.  Hey nothing wrong with a little sugar !  People get to crazied on minor things such as a little raw sugar ...

I love frozen grapes, and they're a really easy snack to prepare after school when my parents are out, and they sure do wonders on a hot summer day. I don't use sugar or anything like that, I find them just sweet enough as they are. I'll pop them in a bag and stick them in the freezer, and they're perfect just like that. 
This is the first time I've heard of putting sugar on them, all the people I know have never done that. I've never tried it with sugar personally, but I sure do love them plain.

Simple to prepare and absolutely delicious! I served them as an appetizer for Easter and Thanksgiving dinner and they were very successful!

These were pretty yummy and look really nice on a pretty plate.  I think they would have been good frozen plain, but it depends on what sweetness you are in the mood for.  I made 2 changes, I used two packets of Truvia (4 tsp regular sugar) and 3 tablespoons regular sugar to cut back on the calories.  It wasn't very many calories saved, so maybe next time I will up the amount of Truvia, because it tasted fine.
