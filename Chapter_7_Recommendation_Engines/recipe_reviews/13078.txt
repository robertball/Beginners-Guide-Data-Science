My 5 star rating comes with a caveat.  After reading several reviews complaining about a)the potatoes not being thoroughly cooked enough, b) it was too watery, and c) it wasn't "clammy" enough, I made the following modifications to the recipe:

1) Rather than cooking the potatoes uncovered, I covered them.  Even doing so required a full 20 minutes to soften the potatoes, and

2) Rather than throw out half of the clam juice, I added it all.  But not before I put 2 tablespoons of flour in it for thickening.  After adding, I brought it back to a boil and stirred until "the desired thickness was acheived"

My wife, a New England clam chowder aficionado (I prefer Manhattan-style) proclaimed it to be the best she's ever had.  SCORE!!

Reading the reviews before making this recipe I made the following changes:  I used bottled clam juice instead of the water (1 ½ cups); 2 cups half-and-half and one-cup heavy cream instead of 3 cups half-and-half, and 3 - 10oz. cans of clams. The other adjustment I made was to use 1-cup ham instead of bacon as I find that bacon gets to soggy in soups, the ham is a perfect substitute and give the soup a bit more bite.

I was looking forward to this recipe and followed it exactly. I made no changes and was very disappointed with how it turned out. The soup was very watery and had an unusual texture. I also think it was just a tad bit too chunky for my tastes (cook the potatoes longer?). I plan on looking for additional clam chowder recipes to try and leave this one alone.

Wonderful chowder with a couple of minor modifications to suit our preferences.  I appreciate you posting this recipe as I'd never made a creamy chowder before, and needed a good, basic guideline & procedure to follow.  I cooked the chopped onions and diced bacon in a few tablespoons of melted butter, then added a couple of tablespoons of flour thus creating a roux.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe, but omitted water and substituted more clam juice instead, doubled the potatoes.  After the potatoes were cooked through in the clam juice, I reduced the heat to a low simmer, then I added twice the amount of clams (I used half minced clams and half chopped clams), and used 1 quart half & half with about a pint of heavy cream. I stirred it often making sure the cream wasn't allowed to boil.  I threw in a couple of tablespoons of dried parsely, and a couple of teaspoons of dried dill weed.  I served this at a potluck with fresh french bread, and got huge raves, and lots of recipe requests.  Thank you!!!  07/15/2012: Made this again last night...just delicious! I've found that precooking the bacon til crisp then adding to the roux of butter, onions and flour makes a huge difference.  Also, replacing all water with clam juice adds great flavor.

Great base for Clam Chowder! I like my clam chowder a little soupy but chunky so I used equal parts water, clam juice and 2% milk (1 and 1/2 cups) and I also left out the bacon to keep it light. To thicken I added 2 tablespoons of flour to the sauté of onions, celery and butter to make a roux. I let the clams (2 cans of minced and 1 chopped) warm on the stove in a separate pot with the clam juice and water. Then I added the clams with liquid to the roux. Brought to a boil and added the milk and partially cooked cubed potatoes. I used Oregano and a little garlic; it was a huge hit!

A good start for chowder base. I use salt pork rather than bacon. I only use clam broth and begin by cooking a couple of potatoes till mushy to give the broth some thickness. A real New England Clam Chowder NEVER thickens with flour or cornstarch. That will change the flavor and texture completely. Light cream and freshly ground pepper are added to the hot chowder just before adding the clams. I have never used canned clams, but I'm sure they are similar to fresh. I don't trust a chowder that "you can stand a spoon in". I make a simiar corn chowder with chicken broth and celery when the corn is fresh and plentiful.

I've been making a clam chowder recipe very much like this for years (Mom's recipe) but decided to give this one a try instead.  I loved the addition of the bacon, however I prefer Mom's way of boiling the potatoes in a seperate pot and then adding them to the 1/2 & 1/2 (without the water).  It makes for a much creamier chowder.  This was excellent though, the only changes I made were to use 3 cans of whole baby clams and to thicken it a little with some cold water/flour. Thanks for the recipe!

I used two 6 & 1/2 oz cans of clams & reserved the juice from both...using clam juice & a very rich, homemade chicken broth instead of water. I used Old Bay instead of salt & since I used baby yukons, I just scrubbed them really well instead of peeling them. I also gave them a light mash before adding the half & half. That helps thicken up the soup w/out adding flour or cornstarch. I was out of half & half so I used half heavy cream & half 2% organic milk. Served it w/ garlic breadsticks...yum yum!

Great recipe.  Instead of 3 cups of half and half, I used 1 pint (2 cups) of half and half and one cup of 2% milk.  Also, I used clam juice instead of water, and stirred a bit of corn starch at the end to thicken it up.  My mother who hates clams even loved it!!!

This is a true New England clam chowder...In Gloucester Ma, you don't find chowders thickened with cornstarch or a flour rouix...THIS is how they are made...If you want a stronger clam flavor use bottled (or better yet, fresh) clam juice instead of water...DELISH!!!

I have been using this same basic recipe my whole life. Hearty enough for a main meal. I had a big meaty ham bone left from the holidays. I cut fat and meat off of that and substituted for the bacon. Being on the Chesapeake Bay I can get big chowder clams for about $2/doz. I steam them up and then use the water from the clams and from the steam pot as a substitute for the water in this recipe. I cut up my clams in larger pieces and still add the canned clams suggested in the recipe. Add extra potatoes or put in some instant mashed potatoe powder to thicken as needed. I sometimes add celery early on so it is soft and adds flavor.

Wow wow wow!! This tastes just like my favorite clam chowder at Outback Steakhouse. This is definiately tastes like New England Clam Chowder. I should know because I've lived in Boston all my life! I don't trust all clam chowders because they've tasted too bland, too watery or too dry. This is perfect. My niece who doesn't like clam chowder loved this! My husband insisted on having it twice a week! LOL! I did take some advice from others. I used clam juice instead of water (added 1/2 cup more afterwards from canned clams). I added 3 cans of minced clams and 1 can of chopped clams. I used lots diced red potatoes(cooked almost 20 minutes covered, stirred it every 5 minutes). Also added lots of black pepper and parsley flakes. The first time I did it I thought it was a bit too watery for me so I put a tablespoon of flour at the end and let it slightly boil for about 5 minutes or so while stirring at the same time. Did not add any salt. PERFECT! If u know the taste of real NE Clam Chowder, you'll love this!

This was a good base recipe.  I used chicken broth in place of the water.  Since most canned clams are salty, I eliminated the salt.  Added finely chopped celery with the onion.  If you want to thicken the broth, be sure to do it BEFORE adding the drained clams.  Once the clams are added the soup should be gently heated - definitely don't let the soup boil or heat too long or the clams become chewy.  Added minced fresh parsley with the clams.

I am another New England girl. This tastes just like the good stuff with a few changes. I cooked the potatoes in a different pot with water. I then cooked the bacon and onions and added a few tbsp of flour to make a roux. My cans of minced clams were 6oz so I used three. I drained the clam juice into a cup and it measured to about 2 cups. When the flour was cooked I slowly added the 2 cups of clam juice. Threw the clams, half and half, and drained potatoes in and let it thicken up. No need for butter(the bacon fat and half and half are enough). It was wonderful to bring a little piece of home here to Illinois. Husband adored it! Every time we visit home he always has clam chowda in a bread bowl at Quincy Market. He said that this rates in his top bowls of clam chowda!

This was my first time making New England Clam Chowder for my Boston-native husband and he LOVED it! I followed others advice and doubled the potatoes and boiled them seperately. I omitted the water and the chowder came out super thick and creamy - without the use of flour! Thanks 1,000,000!

I did not care for this recipe. For flavor, I added a whole other can of clams, and cut down on the amount of potatoes! I also added a bottle of clam juice.  I might have been eating plain milk.

I made changes to the basic recipe based on other reviews and put my own spin on it. I really liked the result and next time I'm even going to make my own bread bowls to dish the soup into. The changes I made were to add the butter at the same time as the onion and after a minute or two add in about 2-3 tbsp of flour. Once the things were incorporated I added a can of evaporated milk which was 12oz along with the water which I heated first before adding. I seasoned it then with salt, pepper, and a dash or two each of garlic powder, thyme, dill, basil, parsley, and coriander.  I added in the potatoes and slow simmered everything. After 20 minutes I added 3 cans of clams along with all the juice and the half and half. I slow cooked everything for another 10-15 min.  It came out wonderfully creamy and was a very good chowder.

I didn't make this recipe but I read reviews and agree with a lot of other users. Definitely use the clam juice, why more water than needed if you have flavoring available?  If using whole clams, steam and use the broth. In addition to onion I also use celery, and cooked them in the bacon grease. added thyme to mixture then added flour to make the roux for thickening. Also use parsley, hint of tabasco, and worcestershire sauce. thicken to desired consistency

Very yummy!  This was our Christmas Eve fare.  I used instant potatoes to thicken this soup.  I also used 1.5 cups clam juice from the clams instead of water, and added 6 cans of clams.  I think I'd like celery in there with the onion as well, but overall this was quick and easy.  And everyone loved it!  Thanks for sharing!

The flavor of this chowder is delicious. The only change I made was to thicken it because of personal preference. I mixed about 2 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch with the left over clam juice and added that in. Stirring I allowed that to cook in without boiling. I served this chowder in Italian Bread bowls from this site. YUM! It was perfect!

This recipe is great!!!  The only thing we do different is to add more clams but that is just because it is our preference.  Recipe is great just the way it is

This was excellent and as good as our favorite fine dining restaurant, The Lobster Shoppe in Tacoma!  I did not change the ingredients or amounts.  I boiled my potatoes in another pan using slightly more water to cover the potatoes better and left uncovered as instructed, and did boil them until they were very soft and the water was cloudy-ish with the starch.  I added this to the bacon and onions after making a roux with about 2 T of flour.  Then followed the recipe as instructed.  Wow, great soup and the whole family can't wait for me to make it again.

Oh this is good. I lived in Maine and have missed this stuff! Only thing I would change would be to add 3  cans of clams as 2 wasn't enough for me. Also- I took a bit of the soup out and blended it in the blender and put back in the pot to make it a bit thicker.

YUMMY!  This one was a hit with both my hubby and my son and stepson!  I added extra clams and clam juice and to thicken it up I added some potato flakes.  Simply awesome recipe!

Great starter! This is what I did different as per our taste and what I had on hand.... I used 3 cans of minced clams and 1 can of whole baby clams, 3 cups clam juice in place of water (2 from draining clams and 1 bottle), I did not peel my potatoes, diced them up rather small and covered the pot til they were done, I added basil, old bay, thyme and garlic... thickened just a little with instant potato flakes (didn't measure, just added a little at a time until it was where we like it). This was very good, with 4 of us there was very little leftover (maybe 1 serving). I served this with sourdough bread.

This was amazing!  When I cooked the onions, I added 3 T butter and 3T flour to make a roux.  Added the water and 1% milk into the potatoes on low temp.  I also used turkey bacon and at the end I added thinly shredded carrots for color.  Will definitely make again!

Best Clam Chowder Ever!!  As suggested by a previous review, I cooked the potatoes for about 20  minutes ( covered). Also, I dissolved 2 spoons of flour in the clam's juice (which is cold, that's the only way flour gets dissolved ). I also added all the clam juice instead of half , and OMG!!! it came out amazing!! I was afraid to make it because the only clam chowder soup that my husband and I like is the one from Uno's Restaurant , but this one it came out much better. I can't still believe how good this recipe was. Thanks a lot!! =D

Very good.  I used chicken broth in place of the water,  and cubed ham in place of the bacon,  but it was great,  I also used whole baby clams one 10 oz can and all the juice.  Like many of the others I added about 2 1/2 T of flour to the pan when cooking the onion,  made for a nice thick chowder.  Served in Bread Bowl  will cook again  Thank you

This is a good starter recipe but it is way too runny and not much flavor. I reduce the liquid and double the clams. Also add more bacon.

A meal in a bowl! Yum!  I tweaked a few things only because I didn't have all the ingredients. I cooked the onions and Bacon Bits (Imitation) in the butter.  Used a steamer bag to cook the potatoe dices for 10 minutes while the onions were cooking. I did NOT add any water but used all the clam juice instead.  I have a Jersey cow so just used 3 cups of whole milk with the cream still in it, instead of using 1/2 and 1/2. Oh, and I left the peels on the potatoes. It was a huge success and there is no more for leftovers.  :(  Served with fried cornbread topped with homemade butter and honey on it. Delicious!

I omitted the water and added a little corn starch to thicken. I also added 2 extra slices of chopped bacon and some parsley. It was awesome.

I have to admit,I haven't tried this recipe yet,it is close to my own though. However,true New England clam chowder is not supposed to be thick,thick,thick!  Thicker dosen't mean better for most chowders.

I've made this recipe twice now and my family likes it a lot. It is a little thin, so next time I think I might just add a little cornstarch to it, but the taste is great and it's really easy. It's great served with sourdough bread to dip in the soup!

Great recipe.After reading the reviews,I discovered how few people have ever tried real New England clam chowder.It is a light and creamy chowder(not thick)with great clam flavor. Subbing clam juice for water and using fresh clams makes it that much better.

This was a great tasting, easy recipe, but I did make some changes, I used 3 cans of clams, I used pre-cooked potato, and a combination of both light cream, 2% milk and skim milk, I used chicken broth instead of water, I removed most of the cooked bacon before I put the onion in then sprinkled the bacon on the soup before serving.  I also used a hand held mixer to thicken it up before I added the clams.  I will make this again, thanks!

I made this soup last night and it was fantastic! It is definitely not a very thick chowder but delicious none the less. The only difference I made was using clam juice instead of water and added more minced clams just because of personal preference. Wonderful

We liked this, but most of my family was in agreement - it doesn't need the butter, it does need celery, and it needs to be thickened.  As a base, this is a good recipe, but this isn't a recipe that I really think will be memorable to us.  I'll probably use it as a base recipe again, but will definitely change some things up.

I was so disappointed :( Definitely have to make a roux to thicken it. Added a little worcestershire sauce like someone else recommended. Wish I had boiled the potatoes in clam juice.

We LOVED this after making a few changes. We served it with sourdough bread. DELICIOUS!!
1) Cook the bacon and onion with a tablespoon of butter. 
2) Add 2 tablespoons of flour to the onion and bacon mixture. 
3) I cut the potatoes into sticks rather than cubed them and cooked in the full amount of water, covered.
4) I added some thyme and used all of the clam juice.

Delicious. Tastes just like this restaurant in Boston.  After reading reviews, I added a little more flour (I like thick chowder) and let the potatoes cook covered. My entire family ate this wanting seconds and thirds. Thank you for posting this!

I followed the recipe to a "T" and this came out DELICIOUS. I live in New England and can get Clam Chowder anywhere and this came out just as delicious as any fantastic restaurant I have ever had it in. If you can't get access to good ole New England clam chowder then this is the recipe to make!!!!!!!

After I sautéed 1 cup of onions in 1 T. of margarine and a few shakes of garlic powder, salt and pepper and Old Bay Seasoning (to taste), I boiled 3 cups of potatoes with a bottle of clam juice and the clam juice from 2 cans of clams.  When the potatoes were soft, I mashed a few of them in the pot for thickening (recipe listed is much too thin for chowder), then added a cup of half and half and 2 T. of margarine.  I simmered this for 5 minutes and stirred in the clams for 5 minutes more.  Clam juice gives it more flavor and the mashed potatoes thickens the chowder without giving it a flour taste if you use flour.  (If you prefer add real bacon bits from a jar for a bacon taste.)  It was DELICIOUS!!

Really good chowder. I made it to go with clam cakes (fritters). The only thing I did different was that I added a can of cream of potato soup because so many reviewers said it was watery and being New Englanders we like our chowder creamier. Adding the can of soup made it perfect. This reminds me of summers at Cape Cod.

Extremely good--6 stars on a scale of 1 to 5!  We substituted clam juice for the water, used Kosher salt rather than iodized (didn't decrease amount, however) and put in half whipping cream and half 1% milk rather than half-and-half.  We also only used two 6.5 oz cans of chopped clams (put them in the food processor to make them a little bit smaller).  I was worried that wouldn't be enough, but it was!  It was absolutely delicious and our friends were quite impressed.  It was a little thin so my husband thickened it with a mixture of cornstarch and milk.  Very, very good.  This was the first time we'd made clam chowder from scratch, and we will not be looking for another recipe; this is the one!

I LOVE New England clam chowder, however, I found this recipe to be just "OK".  I prefer a "creamy" soup.  This one is WAY too thin.  Maybe it's supposed to be this way (it called for quite a bit of liquid)....  I may try this again before giving up, but thicken with flour or cornstarch, use heavy cream instead of half-and-half or puree some of the potatoes to give it that creamy texture I am looking for.  I do think there are recipes on this site that would better suit my taste.  As is, deserving of 1 star (sorry!).  Thanks for sharing anyways!

This was just ok.  The flavor was good but it wasn't the consistency we like (too runny).  I did try to thicken it up a bit but it still wasn't the way we liked it.

I have never made clam chowder before.  My 8 yr old dug up clams over the weekend, so I was determined to use them in this soup.  It was pretty easy, even though cutting up clams was kind of gross.  I washed and diced the clams pretty small.  I diced the bacon and fried it in the bottom of the soup pot.  When it was crisp I added the onions and cooked until about done, then threw in the clams.  In the meantime, I was simmering the diced potatoes in a bottle of clam juice, for a stronger clam taste.  I mixed a cup of milk with some flour and poured that into the bacon/onion/clam mixture and stirred until thick.  Once the potatoes were tender, I threw them w/the clam juice into the soup pot.  I then added more milk until I reached the right consistancy.  This was fantastic clam chowder - better than any I've had at a restaurant.  I was pretty happy with myself!  And my daughter was proud too, though she wouldn't touch the stuff with a 10 ft pole...

Followed this recipe to the "T".  Lots of comments about the potatoes not being done, but I found they were done perfectly (chopped to 1cm cubes). I did boil the potatoes in fish stock instead of just plain water.  The potatoes absorbed much of the water and so constant stirring was required for the last few minutes.  Everything else was exactly as the recipe indicated.  I'll definitely be making this one again very soon.

This is a great recipe and I would give it five stars.  I did modify it just a little by adding a cup of chicken broth to the potatoes while they were cooking and added a full quart of half and half along with two tablespoons of corn starch to thicken it just a little.  My husband and five of my grand children gave their approval.  Thanks for the recipe.

If you want a "watery" New England Clam Chowder, this is the recipe for you.  It is not creamy at all.  It is a watery soup....

I changed it a little but none the less it came out awesome!!! I cooked the potatoes and onion in butter instead of bacon fat and added celery as well. And I threw in the whole thing of half and half which was four cups. My family of picky eaters LOVED it!! Definately will make this again!

This recipe is fantastic!! I had never made clam chowder but this made it easy and a family hit. 2nd time I made it I did add about 2 tablespoons of flour to slightly thicken it and the rest of the clam juice. It was a great addition. Make sure you cook the bacon very crips otherwise it will get chewy.

OMG!! This was amazing. I took the advise of the other reviewers and cooked the potatoes covered for 15 mins.  I also substituted the water for clam juice, added fresh mushrooms and used green onions.  My friend and I could not stop eating it.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Five stars! Thanks Debbie!!

Great recipe...although, like many others I made some adjustments. First, after crisping the bacon I set it aside (added it just before serving) and drained about half of the oil and melted a generous tablespoon of butter and then fried the onions (added a clove of garlic too!). I boiled the potatoes in 1 cup of chicken broth and all of the clam juice (I also used 3 cans instead of two) and added a bay leaf and some thyme as the potatoes cooked. Like others, I used a thickener and added it to the soup as well (cream and cornstarch for me instead of flour). This is definitely a keeper! :)

Excellent!  I used to not be a fan of clam chowder, until I tried the real deal in Boston last month!  In Boston, the clam chowder is smooth and creamy.. not thick, goopy, and flour-y.  Ew.. that's what we get out here in California! :)  I was also amazed at how simple it is to make this at home, from scratch.  I admit I left out the bacon to make it "healthier", but it really did not sacrifice flavor (so you *know* that this recipe is good and didn't need bacon to make it good)!  I took the suggestion of a few other reviewers to boil the potatoes in the clam juice from the cans (I decreased amount of potato, because I like the ratio to include more clams over potato), and also to mash up some of the cooked potatoes to use as a "thickener", if necessary..  and I can not believe how quick and simple it was to whip up.  I added a *lot* of black pepper, and just a tiny bit of sea salt, since I used cans and those already have enough sodium.  If you're looking for a thinner, creamy, true NE clam chowder, this is it.  If you like the thicker, chunkier, flour-y type of soups, then you may not enjoy this recipe.  I bet using cream instead of half and half for special occasions would be out of this world yummy! :)

I used all of the clam juice and did not add water. Good flavor. I had to cook the potatoes for 20 mins with the lid on to get them done. It is very soupy and not thick, so you might want to make a roux if thickness is an issue for your personal taste. Will make this again in a heartbeat! I will probably use 2% milk or whole milk next time and make a roux for thickness - cuts down on the calories!

I'm From New England so I'll just say instead of water add clam juice or homemade clam stock . Also u should use pork fat instead of bacon for a real authentic taste. theres a couple other stuff but that will really set this off real good

My family loves this.  I added 3 cans of clams, increase the bacon, and cooked potatoes in clam juice instead of water.  I put all items in crockpot, except milk/half and half.  Cook for 4-6 hours on low, then add half and half and cook 1 more hr.  When finish, I add 1 mashed potatoe to the pot and we are done.

Followed recipe exactly except before adding the half-and-half, I "slightly" mashed potatoes with a masher to thicken the broth.  Worked great.  Thanks Debbie

I was very disappointed with this recipe, considering all the rave reviews.  I made the soup as-is and it was bland.  I modified the recipe per other reviewers (replacing water with clam juice, using double the amount of clams, using 1 cup heavy cream and 2 cups half-and-half, cooking the potatoes in the clam juice first), and the soup still tasted like it was missing "something."  (and I used the best clams I could get from Whole Foods).  To make the recipe even resemble clam chowder, I had to add even more clam juice, salt, cream, etc. and eventually resorted to adding MSG since nothing else worked.

I'm glad I read all of the reviews before I made this, and made some changes, because the result was truly a 5 star chowder! I added celery with the onion, used almost no water and all of the clam juice from the canned clams, and thicked just a tiny bit with some instant potato flakes. I was VERY impressed with the results. Give this one a try - it's one of the best soups I've ever HAD, much less made!

Very Good!  Used 4 cans of minced clams and reserved 2 cups of juice from them.  Used all the clam juice instead of water.  Added 2 tbs of flour to the clam juice to thicken the soup up.  Topped with scallions and oyster crackers.

OK for a basic recipe, but I made the following changes: added more potatoes and  doubled the clams, added sliced celery, old bay seasoning, bay leaves and used potato buds (about 1 cup) to thicken the soup - gave it better consistency and texture.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Took the advice of others and substituted clam juice for the water and also added in an extra can of clams.  We doubled the recipe and used 4 cups of half and half and 2 cups of milk.  We also substituted tasso for the bacon which gave the soup more of a smoky flavor.  Served this at a family meal and everyone agreed that this recipe deserved five stars.

This is my first time making clam chowder, and I must say, with the suggestions for replacement ingredients (clam juice for water, extra minced clams, half-and-half and cream combination), this was THE best clam chowder I have ever tasted in my life!  My husband absolutely enjoyed it so much that we'll have it as a treat weekly!!!  If your spouse is a carnivore, I'd recommend doubling the amount of clams.  It may seem like a lot, but it goes so very well with the recipe.  I'll use this recipe for life!!!

Outstanding. I doubled this recipe for a friends open house party and it was a hit. I did a couple of things different. I added a few chopped celery stalks and some sliced baby carrots and chopped fresh parsley and garlic. I also used clam juice instead of water. I thickened it a bit with a broth and flour slurry. YUMMY!!

Made this for my husband, the clam chowder expert, he loved it.  He is a picky eater as are all men from what I read. I added (2 ea) shredded carrots and celery as well used 2 cups chicken stock in place of water and clam liquid.  Prior to adding liquid I did make a roux with the onion and bacon mixture + 1 tablespoon butter, it really help to thicken it up.
I will definately make this again.

WOW!  This is fabulous!  I have tried many chowder recipies and this is the one i will use from now on.  It is lighter than most, but extremely flavorful.  I doubled the recipe and it made the perfect amount for lunch or leftovers. To thicken it, i used a little bit of cornstarch and let it warm all afternoon.  This is a keeper!

Awesome recipe, I use the juice from both cans of clams and only half of the cream called for in the recipe and substitute the other half with 2% milk...just to cut calories and fat a bit.  A big hit in our house!!

Delicious, this was the first time I ever made a clam chowder. I used all clam juice instead of water. I also added extra potatos and made alittle roux to thicken up in the end.

I made this on Sunday for my Super Bowl party and I followed the advice of some other reviewers and cooked the potatoes in clam juice instead of water and used 1 1/4 cup of whipping cream instead of all half and half.  Everyone who had some at my party loved it!!  I'm so excited; the recipe is so easy to make, I'm sure I'll do it again!

We all loved this.  I used turkey bacon, used only about 1/2 cp of onion, 2 cups of water, 2 cloves of garlic, 3 cans of clams, and I forgot to add the butter.  I used all the liquid from the clams and added about a tablespoon of flour to the clam juice to help it thicken up.  The kids ate two bowls and made me promise to make it again!  Delicious!

This is the best clam chowder recipe I have made.  I did follow some of the suggestions and used the clam juice instead of water.  I also added a little flour (mixed with the broth) at the end of the recipe to thicken it up just a little.  The flavor was amazing and the consistency was perfect!

Clam chowder in my area (San Francisco Bay Area) is a highly regarded and diligently researched food that has about as many different "great" recipes as it has simple (& intricate) variations. That said, without getting into a "add a touch of dry white wine instead of a measure of your water" or "put in less pepper and let your guests decide what they want in their individual servings" argument, this is an excellent started recipe.

My brother makes the very best crab cioppino I have even encountered; one, because it is all crab, and two, because it is full of garlic and cheap red wine (Carlo Rossi Burgundy-or as mom called it, "Rosco Carli") and is served with fresh, local sourdough bread with our family recipe for garlic bread (garlic, lots of butter, fresh oregano, a tad of fresh basil, some balsamic vinegar and sprinkles of Parmesan cheese and baked at 400 degrees just until the top is brown-outer crust crisp and inner soft and lovely!!!)... I digress... we know good local seafood specialties and love them: this is a really good started chowder recipe with all the potential to add to if you want to make it your own.

Like barbecue sauce and spaghetti sauce, any good cook likes to add their own special "unknowns" to a recipe to get their personal 'scent' on it. A great quote, "Barbequists put secret ingredients in their sauce for the same reason dogs  on trees" says it all. You want to say "THIS IS MINE!" Love it or "pee" on it. It will be good! What could be better?

I also used clam juice rather than water to boil the potatoes.  I added 2 tbls. of flour and 2 tbls. butter to the bacon and onions after they were cooked to make a roux.  I didn't add any more butter at the end.  I added 1/4 teas. nutmeg when everything was combined.  Was a hit!

I made the recipe to the T, but used fresh clams I steamed and 1 cup of clam juice from a jar with 1/2 cup water. When I put in the half and half I noticed it wasn't thickening so I added a can of white potatoes and smooshed them against the side of the pot, the result was delicious! I am keeping this recipe, thanks Debbie!

This was very good, but I wish it had been thicker. Next time I make it I will add a couple of tablespoons of flour to the rendered bacon fat in the pan to make a roux. Also, instead of using all water to cook the potatoes, I will use the rest of the clam juice from the canned clams. I felt that it needed a little something extra as far as flavor, and that might have done it. As it was, a little extra salt and pepper improved it tremendously.

I have never made clam chowder before. My husband is the one who makes the chowder in our family. He said this one blows his out of the water! I was concerned about my 3 and 5 year old eating it, they've never had it before. To my surprise, my 3 year old cleaned his bowl and asked for more. I did take some suggestions from other reviews. I replaced 1/2 the water with clam juice, used another can of clams. The kids say this is definitally a keeper. Thanks so much!!

Excellent. Could have used more clams but the flavor was perfect. I used both cans of clam juice plus an extra splash from a bottle. Of course, I added more flour so the consistency remained the same. Will definitely keep this recipe in my collection!

This was so good! I did make a couple of changes as other reviewers suggested. I added the butter while cooking the bacon and onions. I used clam juice instead of the water. I also used about 2 tbsp of potato starch (potato flour) to thicken the soup. I used 1 cup of heavy cream and 3 cups of half and half. I also used 3 cans of chopped clams and 1 can of whole baby clams, because we like to really taste the clams in our chowder. After cooking the bacon, onions, and potatoes on the stove I transferred everything to my crockpot and let it cook all afternoon on low.  I served the chowder in toasted sourdough bread bowls. My family was so impressed and absolutley loved this! Yummy!

This was a perfect chowder recipe and it was oh so easy!  As I usually do, I substitued some things to make the dish a bit healthier...used fat free half and half and got rid of the bacon.  I also used a slurry of water and flour to thicken up to my liking.  Even with these changes, it was still delicious!

This recipe is delicious. My husband commented last night that it was restaurant quality. I sent some home with my neighbor, and he told me today that it was the best Clam Chowder he'd ever had. I only had chopped clams on hand, so I used those. I added all of the liqid from both cans, added about 3 stalks sliced celery, one diced carrot, and chopped, fresh flat leaf parsley. I only had a pint of half and half, so I added 1 cup of milk to make the difference. Also, I added more chopped bacon and parsley when serving. I will definately keep this recipe in my recipe box and make again and again. Thanks so much for sharing your wonderful recipe!

This is a terrific recipe.  As others suggested, I substituted 8 oz clam juice (plus the liquid from one can of clams) for the water, used 2 cups of potatoes, and 3 cans of clams.  I also used (2) 12-oz cans of evaporated skim milk in place of the half-and-half.  My VERY picky husband and 5 year-old son raved about this chowder.  Thanks so much!

This was delicious - also followed suggestions to use clam juice instead of water, and add additional can of clams (I used chopped instead of minced).  My son liked it so much, he said he doesn't want canned chowder again!

This is the BEST clam chowder recipe ever! My family loved it at Christmas and everyone had to copy it.  I, too, added an extra can of clams and a little seasoned salt and pepper and a bay leaf.  It gave it the extra flavor that was somewhat lacking.  This will be a family tradition...Bill Rodgers

Best New England Clam Chowder I have had EVER.....MOVE OVER CANNED STUFF, this recipes is easy and economical. I did not have half and half on hand so I substituted 1 cup of heavy cream and 2 cups of milk still came out great, I also like my soup thicker so I added a teaspoon of corn starch to the milk to thicken it and I used 16 OZ of fresh chopped clams in its own liquid from the fresh fish section in my supermarket and poured the entire liquid in it was amazing. Great flavor of bacon, clams and the sweetness of the caramelized onions, this has become a family favored soup.

I used small creamer potatoes and boiled them for the 15 minutes. Added the butter and boiled for 2  minutes. Added the clam juice and clams and boiled 3 minutes. Then added the half and half and let sit on medium -low for 10 minutes. This gave time for potatoes to cook and get the clam taste.

I wouldn't really call it hearty. This was my second time with this recipe but this time I changed it up a bit with celery, cornstarch, clam juice instead of water and extra clams and bacon. I also used all of the juice from the 3 16oz cans of clams. This is a good base recipe.

Very good, I did a few shakes of Old Bay seasoning and a shake of celery salt. My husband loved it, said it was even better heated up the second day.

i grew up on new england food and seafood was a mainstay at or house on the coast of the atlantic.this is almost exactly the same recipe my mother used,except she usd whole shucked clams.we would go dig up a pail[10qt]of clams fresh from the clam beds,wash them in the ocean surf to maintain the fresh flavors then shuck them into a collander over a bowl to collect all the juice cutting back on th amount of water needed,also she brought out all the flavors by using evapor-ated milk,served with big round common crackers.i'm 82 and still like my chowders the old fashioned way.

This was a very good recipe.  I made a few changes to take it to 5 stars.  I doubled the bacon and added 3 diced celery ribs. I added about 1/4 cup fresh minced parsley and 2 garlic cloves.  I drained the clam juice into a measuring cup and had 2 cups of liquid.  I substituted this for the amount of water in the recipe. I used lactose free half and half to the amount of 4 cups. (I added 3 and held back 1 cup)  I used the butter to make a roux with flour (about 4 tablespoons)in a saute' pan.  I added that extra cup of cream and let it cook about 30 seconds.  I blended this into the soup and it thickened up perfectly. I also added a few shakes of red wine vinegar. We really did enjoy the soup and it was not hard to put together at all.  Will definitely be making this again with my changes.

I never thought about how easy it was to make your own clam chowder!  I always order it when I go out to eat but making your own taste so much better!  Using chicken stock instead of water makes a big difference and I added more clams, just the way I like it. I've made it twice already and both times it turned out great!  Will be making again soon!

My family loved this.  I omitted the bacon.  Instead I used a little bit of butter to cook the onions in.  I used clam juice instead of water.  I used 5 cups of potatoes.  I also added three tablespoons of flour towards the end.  Also used 4 cans of clams.  It was delicious!!  Very easy to make!!

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I made it for the first time on Christmas Eve and it was a huge hit.  
I modified it slightly by adding chopped celery (4 stalks when doubling the recipe), 1 medium shallot, sea salt, fresh ground peppercorns, with a sprinkle of adobo and fresh parsley.  I utilized shucked whole clams and chopped clams found at Costco.  Everyone remarked the clams were really tender and delicious.

I am cooking for my family using the Feingold diet, and was able to do so with with the basic ingredients this recipe called for, and it was AWESOME! My husband said it was the best he ever had and we lived on Long Island, NY for most of our lives!

The flavor is spot on, but the problem is the consistency for sure. It was very watery, without signs of improving until i added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. THEN, it was perfectly chunky and creamy. I cooked the potatoes with clam juice instead of water, and covered the pot for quicker cooking. I also used 2 cups half and half and 1 cup heavy cream. I used ALL the clam juice. Chopped fresh cilantro for a little color and flavor. A BIG TIME hit at my dinner party!

This is an awesome recipe, however, I did change it a bit. I added a couple extra slices of bacon, couple stalks of finely diced celery and used clam juice instead of the water. The potatoes had to be cooked longer. With my changes, I would give this recipe 5 stars. Thanks!!!

I used more bacon and clams than the recipe originally called for and I lessened the onions by 1/2 cup and it turned out wonderfully!  My boyfriend is a HUGE clam chowder fan and he pretty much demolished the entire pot in a night!  Great and easy recipe!

I can say I love the Clam Chowder from another Allrecipes.com user who uses red wine vinegar!  OMG it just makes the meal.  I even throw in a tablespoon to the Campbells Chunky or Progresso canned soup just to get that tastel  Some how that tiny little bit of vinegar makes a huge difference.  Never throw out the clam juice!  Use it in your chowder.  It makes the flavor that much better!

I nuked the cubed potatoes to speed things along. Substitute clam broth for the water. Just right with a shake of chipotle in your bowl.

I like the base recipe but I added 24 oz of clams and used clam juice instead of water.  Next time I will add more potatoes to it for added thickness. I did add 2Tbsp of dissolved cornstarch to thicken the soup.

The clam chowder was GREAT!    However, I did follow a few things other reviews had mentioned.  Added an additional can with all of its juices and a few tablespoons of flour to thicken it up!  Yummy and very tasty with buttered sour dough bread on a cold and wet winter evening!

Excellent base for a chowder. I used lobster, home canned bar clams and fresh mussels.  I added the mussels at the same time as I added the potatoes and water. The rest was added at the same time as it calls in the recipe. I get rave reviews evey time I make this!

I changed it up a little but kept it basically the same. I used about 4 oz of diced salt pork instead of bacon, and used 1 1/3 cups of clam juice give or take instead of water, and didn't add more at the end. I also put in 2 bay leaves while cooking the potatoes. Instead of half and half, I used 3 cups of heavy cream, and instead of 10 of minced clams, I used 4 6.5 oz cans of chopped clams. I'm from Boston, and this came out amazing!!

I used about five cups of potato cooked very tender, then I "mashed" some to thicken the chowder a bit.  Also mixed a couple tbs of corn starch into the clam juice and used it to thicken the broth some more... it was excellent...

Really good recipe! Very velvety broth.  Only thing I added was cornstarch at end to thicken otherwise followed recipe as written.  Next time would add more clams, just for my preference.

Being from New England and living in Tennessee now we were craving a good Clam Chowder.  I made this chowder and didn't have a problem with the potatoes or not being clammy enough.  This recipe surpassed others i have tried.  People who have had or never tried Clam Chowder before raved about this meal.

An easy, basic recipe, this would have gotten five stars but I needed to tweak it a bit.   After cooking the bacon I removed it from the pan and set it aside to sprinkle on top. Nothing worse, IMHO, than soggy, rubbery bacon! Decided to add about 2 ribs of chopped celery (with the onions) and a little bit of dried sage at the end because it seemed a bit bland. Also, reserved a little of the clam juice that I mixed with a tbls. of cornstarch to thicken what would have otherwise been a thin chowder.

This was excellent my husband & I loved it.  Easy to make.  I followed one reviewer suggestion of using all of the reserved clam juice.  It is true that the bacon is not crisp but worth it for the flavor.

This had a really good flavor, much better than another clam chowder I've made. I'm doing low-carb, so I used cauliflower instead of potatoes, and I mashed some of the cauliflower up to make it a little thicker. I added chopped celery and red bell pepper, used three cans of minced clams with their juice and I added 2 tbsp of red wine vinegar at the end. I will definitely make again, but use less water and butter and more caulifower, as it was a little too soupy.

This turned out very good. I baked the potatoes for about 1/2 an hour before I peeled them, cubed them, and added them to the soup. I also added 2 Tablespoons of flour and it was perfect. Nice and thick.

I doubled the recipe and used heavy whipping cream in place of the half and half.  I also heated the clam juice and added 1/2 to 3/4 cup flour to it with a whisk and then added it to the chowder.  I also increased the pepper and salt and used 1lb bacon.  It was great and pretty thick.  I will add this to my families favorites.

This was very delicious but very different from other clam chowder's I've had. I followed the recipe mostly as listed with a few modifications. Instead of using water I used the clam juice and chicken broth - I would have used all clam juice if I had some on hand. Instead of half and half I used evaporated milk and whole milk - it was still extremely rich and creamy. To thicken it I used 4T of flour mixed with just enough cold water to get rid of lumps and make it smooth - this made the chowder nice and thick. If you do this make sure to add half of this while the potatoes are cooking and the other half right after adding the milk - you want to make sure your flour has a chance to cook and thicken up. I also added a handfull of fresh chopped parsley and some dried dillweed - oh and quite a bit of salt and some pepper. It was very thick, very rich and very good! I think I would add just a tad less potatoes next time - it was almsot like a stew with so much stuff in it but some people might like that! I used small red potatoes with the skin left on. Serve with some warm baked ciabatta - delicious!!

No leftovers which is always a great sign.  The flavor was very good.  Instead of 2 cans of minced clams, I used 3 cans of chopped clams and used the juice from 2 of the cans.  I also took another reviewers advice (as the broth is a little thin and I prefer thicker)and used a can of cream of potato soup.  I just let it cook a little longer and this helped thicken the soup up.  I cubed the potatoes a little too big and so next time I will cube even smaller.  (Per my kids advice.)

This is just like the clam chowder I grew up with.  Sometimes I make it with milk for a less rich flavor   I always add about 3 cloves of garlic i also use clam juice insted of water.  All of my friends love it they say it is better than the wharf.

I usually do not like clam chowder, but husband loves it so I decided to make this for him; well he loved and so did I. It does not have that fishy taste to it at all it kinda reminded me of potaoe soup with a twist.

An excellent, easy clam chowder.  I used frozen clams instead of canned, and added a bottle of clam juice to boost the flavor.  The chowder tasted great and got rave reviews at my Christmas party.  One thing, though:  I followed another reviewer's advice and added mashed potato flakes to thicken the soup, but it got too potato-y.  Next time I'll try cornstarch or flour if it's too thin.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor of this is everything you could want from clam chowder.  My family loved it but all agreed that they prefer their chowder a little thicker.  Next time I will add a thickener to give the broth more substance.

I really impressed myself with this recipe!  I added some diced celery along with some shallots for a milder onion flavor...and I doubled the amount of clams!  Also, I went all out and served this in Panera sour dough bread bowls...out of this world!!!  ...Not a drop left over!

Add Celery with onions. Thicken by blending a few tablespoons of some flour into sauted onions before adding water.  Add more seasoning -- salt, pepper, parsley.

Very good, only the bacon really does not fit well with the other flavors.  I made it once with the bacon, thinking I would really like.  (Who does not like bacon!)  It was not bad, it just seemed like an odd flavor with the clams.  The second time I made it without the bacon.  I also placed 1/3 of the chowder in a food processor, just like one would do with potato soup.  (One can also use a blender or a stick blender)  A little tweaking made this the best clam chowder I have ever made!

I had never made clam chowder before and thought this recipe was simple.  I wish I read some of the reviews before I made it. The chowder overall was easy and tasted great, but not as thick as I would have liked.  I never did think to add flour or corn starch.  Next time I will. Great recipe. Thanks for posting.

This chowder didn't turn out so well, I didn't rate it though because I didn't follow the recipe exactly so I don't think it would be fair to rate it. I used turkey bacon, condensed milk and all of the clam juice instead of water. DON"T DO WHAT I DID. might be much better when you follow the recipe to a "t".

I changed a few things by omitting the butter until last and using it to make a blonde roux and thinkening the chowder a bit.  Also added Old Bay Seasoning and dried dill weed.  Excellent!

This was an awesome recipe. I did like some others said and replaced the water with the clam juice and replaced the half and half with cream and "WOW". This was the best clam chowder my family has ever had. I made a huge stock pot full and had nothing left over. Absolutely amazing recipe. Will definately make again and again. Thank you

I used 4 cans of chopped clams and had enough liquid to replace the water with clam juice. Light cream replaced the half and half. I made this because it was quick and I had all the ingredients available, next time I'll make it  just because it is GOOD!

I made this while camping for a large crowd. Did things a little different. Used a can of boiled clams and chopped them and my onions (not together) in my food prossessor  before I left. I did use a few cans of  minced clams but they are expensive. I also used a jar of clam juice with the juice from the minced clams and a little water to cook the potatoes with. Everyone loved this chowder very much.

Awesome chowder, I needed to thicken it with a flour/butter paste but I'm sure it was because of something I did or didn't do!

I left out the Bacon and add a little flour to thicken it up. Everytime I make it I get rave reviews. I made it three times in less than a month due to demand. It is a great recipe and I was surprised on how easy it is.

This is a delicious clam chowder!!  My husband, 13-year-old son and I all raved about it.  It is easy to make, but takes longer than the estimated 15 minutes, depending on how small you want to dice the potatoes.  I will make this soup again and again!

If you prefer to mix things up as I do, try boiling potatoes in heavy cream with flounder to ensure potatoes are extra delicious. Use shallots rather than onion, and discard use of bacon in favor of toasted prosciutto. The flounder dissipates in the cream rendering the new improved broth. Then add your clams, including clam juice, to the pot and warm. It's a spin off a seafood chowder the ex captains in South Boston would give us when we got back from lobster fishing. Except they'd include chunks of Atlantic cod and scallops. Try these variations and you've got something! Half and half is overrated and doesn't firm up rendering a milky soup taste. Heavy cream is where it's at!

I just made this soup and I give it 5 stars for being very tasty along with a simple amount of ingredients. I did make the roux separate with butter so it has a buttery flavor. Can't wait to go eat some.

I made the soup using the suggested clam juice instead of water, but was still disappointed it is pretty bland. I will look for a different recipe next time.

This works out to be more of a clam soup with a cream base.  This doesn't have the New England Chowdah' thickness that I/we were looking for but still very tasty and would maybe make a couple changes next time.

I've been making this for a few years now. I did make some modifications. I use 2 linguica instead of bacon, 2 cups half-and-half and 1/2 cup heavy cream, 8oz cream cheese, clam juice in place of water. Then sometimes I use this and then make it into a seafood chowder with scallops, bay shrimp, canned crab meat, and mussels. The seafood chowder is so good.

Fabulous!  I added chopped celery, including the leafy part and some fresh thyme.  Also, next time I will cut back on the potatoes a bit. The four cups seemed a bit much. Overall, fantastic tasting chowder. The broth has perfect consistency. It's creamy without being too heavy.  I added a bit of extra bacon as well. Enjoy!

I am actually a bit amazed by the negative reviews because I followed the directions to the T and my family and myself are stuffed and pleased!  This was my 1st time ever making clam chowder and I was hoping it stood up to my mom's from when I was little and I have no complaints.

My husband loved clam chowder and I made this for father's day and he just loved it! Even my 7 and 2 year olds thought it was delicious. I cooked the bacon, set them aside added the onions and after 5 min I added 2 table spoons of corn starch. Used clam juice instead of water - 2 cups; covered the potatoes and used 1 1/4 cup of table cream. Cut the bacon into small pieces and sprinkled on top of the chowder in the bowls

I made this the other night and the whole family loved it! I used 1 cup clam juice and 1/2 cup water when it came time to cook the potatoes and my husband thickened it some with corn starch in the end. I'm not very good at making any kind of soup but this ended up being the best by far the best tasting NE Clam Chowder I ever had! I will be making this again when the weather starts getting colder in VT.

I LOVE this recipe but I changed it slightly. 
-I added fresh parsley at the end.(About 5 minutes before serving)
-Doubled the onion and bacon.
-I use minced AND chopped clams.
-I add extra potatoes.
-I use a homemade seafood stock instead of the water, it adds alot of flavor.

Great base recipe! The only changes I made was using chicken broth instead of water and instead of 3 cups of half and half I used 2 and 1 cup of heavy cream. I  also added 3 cans of chopped clams including the juice. Before adding in the cream I tossed a couple spoonfuls of flour into the potatoes and broth after the potatoes were tender and whisked it together to thicken the soup a bit. It came out really good!

I loved this recipe but changed and added a few things. First I used veggie broth instead of water. I like extra bacon so I used 6 slices. I also threw in 1.5 cups of finely chopped celery. A healthy sprinkle of dried Thyme, Parsley, and a bay leaf. I also minced some fresh garlic (2 cloves) and added that when cooking the onion. Other than that I stuck to the recipe and it was delightful. My boyfriend ate three bowls of it and said it was a keeper for our dinner rotation. 

PS shopper tip: I used chopped canned clams because they sell them cheap at Costo. I just used my food processor to make them minced.

I view many clam chowder recipes. including this one. My grandmother ran rooming homes in Portland, Maine and clam chowder was one of her listed meals. While I have tried many parts of clam chowder ingredients I have some favorites. Salt pork, fat removed and fried to well done cannot be substituted. Clam broth should be the only liquid for cooking. I use large amounts of onion but cooked to blend well. The chowder must have LOTS of clams and potatoes. While I love cream, I lighten with regular milk and add dehydrated potatoes to thicken a little. I am still trying to find the "secret" ingredient that won the California clam chowder cook off using a seafood enhancement as her winner. In any event, I just made a batch and thinking about what I will do with the next. Tom Brackett

This was a hit with my fiance who adores clam chowder!  I used bacon bits instead of slices of bacon diced.  I also used suggestions of (1 tsp. of each) oregano and minced garlic (sauted with the onions in olive oil).  In addition I also used the suggestion to thicken the soup with 2 tbsp. of flour mixed thoroughly with the clam juice and USED all of the clam juice with the cans, not partial.  These helpful hints I used that made it great:  Bring to boil the potatoes and such and cook COVERED for 20 MINUTES until potatoes are tender.  AND after putting in the clams and clam liquid with flour allowed it to cook for 5 minutes to BOIL.  Will make this again!

I have used this recipe a couple of times with a few changes.  

1.  I am not a fan of Bacon so use Salt Pork makes a difference in the taste in my opinion

2. Instead of Water I use Clam Broth Cup for Cup I think it gives the finished product much more flavor.

3.  I also use less onion and I use a food processor.  

4.  I also use a couple of bay leaves.

I tried this recipe and it was great. Yes, it seemed a bit watery. If you let the pot sit on low for 10 minutes or so and stir, the potatoes will thicken it at bit.  

I will follow the advise from others next time and substitute some of the water for clam juice, and while stirring the bacon with onions add some flour to make a roux. Also, I may do it with turkey bacon next time.

I took the advice of 1 reviewer and boiled my potatoes covered...be warned, you will need to add more water! I had halved this recipe, which took the water down to 3/4 cup. I had to add water twice. I did add about a teaspoon of flour to the clam juice which I think helped with the texture. Hubby said the clams lacked flavor, so I'm thinking next time I should add the clams about 2 minutes before the potatoes are done to impart extra flavor. Otherwise, loved it! Only my second time eating clam chowder ever and this was far better than my first experience.

Awesome! I used two cups of heavy cream and one cup of light cream because the store didn't have half and half. It turned out great and even the picky eating kids loved it. Of course I didn't tell them what was in it.

Made as is, it is a fine chowder, but nothing special.  Read through some of the alterations to thicken it up, and add what you need to for your family's taste.  We added corn and carrots from the garden and used cream instead of half n half.  Cooking the potatoes 20 minutes covered is a must unless you want a crunchy soup.

The process is good, and the taste is spot on to what I've tasted in New England. I just cooked the potatoes a little longer than directed. Also use all of the clam juice as it wont come out tasting clammy enough. I like my soups a little thinner, but if you want a thicker texture, I would sift in maybe two or three tablespoons of flour.

This was delicious! I used 6 slices of bacon (you can never have too much bacon, and my slices were thin) and added celery (I had it on hand and figured it wouldn't hurt). I may have also used closer to 3 cups of potatoes instead of 4 (I rarely measure). Other than that, I stuck to the recipe, and was very pleased with the results. I served this in a bread bowl with a salad on the side, and my husband and I went back for seconds. Definitely give this recipe a try!

This is a great recipe with one exception. It needs more clams and possibly more potato. Everyone loved it but asked where the clams were.

This was a very good, quick, weeknight soup.  If I were making it for company or a potluck, I would want a slightly richer clam chowder.  But still, this is quite good.

Very tasty.  I had to adjust the recipe somewhat: (a) I had 2 6.5 oz cans of clams.  I added more liquids then ended up thickening it up a bit.  I also used some thyme and celery (as a Jamaican I'm VERY into lots of seasoning!)  This was great!

This recipe is a good recipe and I tried making it for the first time tonight, I used a little bit too much water and that prevented my chowder from being think and creamy. I would also like to omit the bacon, but otherwise, a good recipe.

I made this and it was exceptional!! It was so easy and I was a little worried it wouldn't be as good as you get in a restaurant, it was! I was actually short 7 ounces of clams, but it was still good. I will add the required amount next time. I did also only add a little over 2 cups of half and half.  I was very pleased overall!!

very nice ! I too added flour, cooked potatoes longer, added 2 oz of white wine slightly sweet plus a can of salmon, bones out or you can crush them to add some calcium to your diet, to cut down on the fat use homo milk and extra flour, been a cook for 30, years retired now, love to adjust recipes,also run my own small eatery on large farm for the workers they love my clam chowder with biscuits. Linda sophia.....I give this four stars

This is one of my all time favorites, and I know the secrets for achieving the best flavour possible for this soup. First, the bacon has to come out of the pan to be later crumbled into baconbits and spread on the soup at the very end. It has to be crisp but not burnt, this will keep it from going soggy in the soup. Second, you must remove some grease from the POT  before the onions go in.  Once the potatoes are soft, you can mash them up to add thickness, but otherwise this is NOT a thick soup. A few pieces of sweet potato is a nice ingredient to add as well. Add clam juice from cans or fresh and some worcestershire sauce is a must.

We really enjoyed this chowder.  I used peppered bacon and therefore did not add additional pepper, 1 pint of light cream and 1 can of evaporated milk in place of Half & Half.  I also used 3 cans of clams and the juice from 1 can, discarding the liquid from the other 2 cans.  It was delicious!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I have been craving clam chowder for weeks. This was exactly what I had been wanting. The soup was a little thin so I made a roux out of the clam juice. I cant wait to make more,  my whole family loved it and it was so easy!!

9 out of 9 guests thought this was the best they have EVER tasted.  I added thyme and basil along with the celery and garlic.  It was wonderful.  Thank you!

Based on other reviews, I made some modifications. I used 2 cans of minced clams and 1 can of chopped clams. I used two cups of half&half and 1 cup heavy cream. I boiled the potatoes in clam juice instead of water.

This was a very good chowder!    I did make a few modifications based on the other reviewers suggestions: 3 1/2 cups of potatoes and 1/2 cup of carrots; all clam juice instead of water for a total of 1 3/4 cups of juice; used 3 (6.5 oz) cans of clams; 2 cups of half and half and 1 cup of heavy cream; turkey bacon instead of pork; added a bay leaf; and, lastly, I put it in the fridge to meld the flavors for about two hours before reheating right before serving.  As for the 'soupy' issue... I used an imersion blender to mash it some and that thickened it right up.    A few minor tweaks but, overall, a really good clam chowder.

The recipe was very easy to make.  I doubled everything but the potatoes and added 1 1/2 cups of chopped celery.  As for a whole, the soup was excellent.  It will be going into my recipe box for sure.

This is the best BASE recipe I've seen.  It has all the basic instructions you need.  I used 12 pieces of bacon, used clam juice instead of water, used twice the amount of clams, made a slurry to thicken it (with more clam juice).  I used 2 c. whipping cream and 1 c. whole milk because I didn't have half'n half.  Everyone who tasted this chowder LOVED it!  My husband who never eats the same meal twice in a row, actually ate this soup for three days in a row and was disappointed when it was gone!  I got my clams at costco.

After reading the other reviews, I decided to cover the potatoes while cooking them for 20 minutes.  I also added all of the clam juice and used flour to thicken it.  After it was done cooking, I let it cool down before putting it in the refrig for a few days.  I made it on a Sunday and heated it up on Wednesday for dinner.  It was a big hit in my house!!  Will definately do again and again.  Thank you for a great recipe!!!!

I really had to doctor this one up to make it the way I like it. Used 2 6.5oz cans clams. Added first one including all the juice. Drained juice from the second can and added about a 1/4c flour and used it to thicken with. Still wasn't thick enough so I used the potato masher to break up some of the potatoes. Tastes pretty good but definitely not a 5 star the way the recipe is written.

Absolutely delicious with some changes.

Added a bay leaf, added all the clam juice from the can, needed much more salt and added a corn starch surrey to thicken it up.

Also I needed more water to get my potatoes soft without sticking/burning to the bottom even when cooked covered.

I agree with other reviewers, as a chowder, this recipe is too thin.  I followed a tip to make a roux in a separate saucepan with butter and flour.  I also whisked in some of the broth from the soup then whisked the mixture back into the soup.  It'll thicken more upon standing so don't make it too thick unless that's what you want.
I used half and half but to make it lower fat, I'll try it next time with 2% or lower fat milk.  
The chowder was still missing something so I added some Old Bay Seasoning, a few drops of hot sauce, and a few shakes of Worcestershire Sauce.  I think that did the trick!

I'm from NE.  This chowder was just OK.  Not the greatest and it certainly needed a LOT of thickening up.  It was missing something and I think that something was clam juice.  Good effort overall though.

Cooking this up was prompted by a visit to a small bar-restaurant in Quebec City where they served a "to die for" clam chowder. If it was a '5' - this recipe was easily a '4'. Followed the recipe except for the 1/2 & 1/2, (couldn't find any.) Used 500ml 15% cream with some skim milk mixed in. Also added about 1/2 a cup of wather during cooking as the water was   evaporating too much.
HIGHLY recommended (& I'm not even a fan of clams).

Very good, but definatley not the BEST.  I will be making it again. Changes I made:  I boiled the potatoes in the clam juice and I also added garlic.  I also added some flour to thicken it a bit.

I just made this and am pretty disappointed - its way too watery. 

I added celery and used clam juice to boil the potatoes in stead of water and instead of adding it in at the end- thinking that would add more flavor and not water it down. I was wrong. Its still pretty bland - like someone else said, more like a potato soup. 

I also omitted the bacon fearing it would overpower the clams - I'm glad I left it out!

I was planning on giving half the pot to my grandparents, but I'm too embarrased to now. 

I won't make this recipe again.

great recipe! I added a couple of cloves of fresh minced garlic in with the onions for a little more flavor and some minced crabmeat. it was fabulous!! the soup was a little too runny, so i took the suggestion of another reader and added some dry potato flakes to thicken it up. i think i will also add in more clams next time, but this is definitely a keeper! thanks for the post.

This soup was awesome! I made a couple changes-I cooked the potatoes for a bit longer-I added 2 stalks of chopped celery while cooking the potatoes, and I did thicken the sauce with some mashed up potatoes and a LITTLE bit of flour, and I used 1 can of minced clams and 1 can of chopped. It turned out amazing! But it did have a potato soup kind-of taste, so next time I'm going to cook the potatoes in clam juice, and probably add one more can of minced clams. (My husband LOVES them.) All in all, a great recipe! Thanks for sharing

It tastes okay but the consistency is thin and weak. I was just disappointed that it didn't have a thicker texture.

Fairly good potato soup but not a hearty clam chowder.  This is more like thin potato-bacon soup with some canned clams thrown in.

While this recipe was very good, it certainly was not akin to New England clam chowder.  I thickened it with flour and also substituted clam juice for the water.  There was just something missing, and I didn't like the addition of bacon.  A good soup but not what I hoped for.

Delicious! Like others I thickened with corn starch. Had to bring to a slight boil to get it to thicken, but that didn't seem to effect the clams or quality of the soup. In our house, this recipes serves 4 and not 8!  I like thick soups so I will add more potatoes next time.

So quick and easy, it's hard to believe something so convenient could taste so good.  As other reviewers have indicated, if you prefer a thick base, add flour or corn starch.  I used corn starch and needed around 4 tablespoons--maybe more--to thicken it to the consistency we like at my house.  I felt the need to add a little water when I added the potatoes, since the potatoes covered the water entirely!  I also used the clam juice--I had around 2 cups of clam juice from the canned clams.  This is restaurant quality.  Don't hesitate to prepare this one!

This was delicious. I made a few changes and additions. I cooked the onions in the butter first and also added 4 stalks celery. 

I did not use bacon in this recipe. I also cut down the amount of liquids by a qarter cup each so it would be very chunky. It could possible use a few more spices, thyme or celery seed. I just added a bit of parsley.

Add a bit of cheddar cheese to the top too. I also did use a bit of cornstarch to thicken it even more. 

This recipe is very runny if followed exactly.

We thought this was too bland and too thin.  I think, cook the potatoes and onions in clam juice instead of water, and add garlic salt, garlic pepper, and celery seed.  Thicken with either flour or cornstarch, set the bacon aside and crumble on top of each serving so it will stay crisp.

This recipe tastes just as good without the bacon (put the butter in with the onions instead of later) and canned corn is a good addition.  Also, like others have mentioned, clam juice instead of water and whipping cream instead of half and half.

Having just returned from New England, I hoped this recipe was close to the clam chowder I had eaten while there, but it wasn't. It was too thin and tasted too much like bacon. :-(

After my first attempt at making clam chowder the verdict is in...it was wonderful.  I used the clam juice instead of water.  I also added a pinch of tarragon and thyme.  It was wonderful!  Thank you

Although we liked this one enough, I just can't help that it was missing something.  I'm no chef so I'm not sure exactly what, but everyone seemed to like this one.  Warms the bones on a cold winter day.

This a great recipe.  I have never made clam chowder before and this was very easy to make.  It has a lot of flavor.  I did use a bit of flour to thicken it, and I think next time I may add more clam juice.  I will definitely make this again.

OK, I've made this many times. I have also made it Keto, by using Cauliflower instead of potatoes. 
I use this recipe as a ballpark guideline. Clearly 15 minutes is really not enough time to cook the potatoes properly.
My revisions:
I start with fresh chowder clams or cherrystones. 2 dozen. Large pot, half full of water. At least 6-8 cups. 
I boil them, one layer in shell until shell is open. I remove the clams when the shell opens, and continue until all are cooked and open. 
I set the open clams aside, and remove them from the shell. 
Chop them and add later per recipe.
I reserve ALL liquid I cooked the clams in, and I strain it through a colander lined with paper towel to remove any sand that settled. 
Reserving all strained liquid clams cooked in as the base instead of just water. 
I continue per recipe, cooking potatoes covered until cooked, then add clams, cream, butter etc. 

I also modify this recipe to make a fish chowder, and a seafood chowder as well, by adding fish/shrimp as well as the clams. 
I will also thicken with Wondra flour after the cream is warm.

Pretty easy to prep and my picky wife rated it A+ by our rating (A for excellent and + for wants again soon). I cooked the bacon before the rest and chopped it fine after thorough draining; half in the mix and half as top dressing. Excellent!

I made this, but turned it into a seafood chowder instead, by adding bay scallops, prawns and calamari. I had no cream so, i made up a package of Knorr Cream of broccoli soup to help thicken, and it really gave a bang to the chowder, also since I didn't have cream, I used 2% milk and all the juice from 2 cans of clams. Turned out great!

I added extra clams and I mixed some lean ham in with the bacon. Perfect for a cold evening. My nine year old ate two big bowls of it!

This is a great recipe! I took note of some of the comments made regarding the thickness and bland potatoes. I made a few changes. I used the bacon, onions, potatoes, salt and pepper according to the recipe. I reserved a little bacon grease in a separate pan to make a roux. I added 1/2 cup of celery and carrots. I replaced the water with clam juice from a bottle and allowed my potatoes cook in the juice until tender. While that was cooking I began my roux. I melted the butter in the separate pan added flour stored until I had a light puffy sauce. This took about 5 minutes. Then I added heavy cream to the mixture. I then transferred the roux to my clams broth and seasoned to taste. OMGOODNESS was this good! It was thick and flavorful!

Should have added more potatoes.   I also made my flour roux with onions sauteed in butter.  And, I added 3 cups clam juice and a pound of new england shellfish medley.

My family loved this easy recipe. I substituted chicken broth for the water and since I am allergic to pork, I sauteed in butter instead of bacon. I added turkey bacon, but I think it would be just as good without. I will definitely make this again!

Make sure to check the top substitutions! I used those and some of my own

Cooked the bacon and discarded because it turns rubbery in soup. Used the bacon grease and a little butter to cook the onions then made a roux with flour before adding the juice of the clams in place of water.

I used pre diced “Simply potatoes” that I cooked in the microwave for like, 3 minutes to make sure they cooked through all the way. Also added a tsp of chicken soup base to bring out the flavors. My boyfriend loved it so much it’s made it onto the regular rotation.

Made it according to the instructions. Only thing I did was added corn starch to thicken it. I didn't see anything regarding adding a thickener but I did because it would have been to watery. As it was my husband didn't like it because it wasn't thick enough! I usually have added a little chicken bullion to add more flavor but needed to try this before judging. Will I make it again? Yes but will add a couple of things to add more flavoring..

This chowder was easy and very tasty.  I always like to follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it.  However, this time, based on other reviews, I made 2 modifications.  
I replaced the water with clam juice and used 3 cans of clams instead of 2.  Everything else I kept the same.   
Some reviews said the potatoes weren't cooked enough.  I cut my potatoes the size of dice and cooked them half the time with lid off and half with lid on.  I kept them at a boil the entire time, and they were cooked perfectly in 15 minutes.  Also, Step 2 says to cook for 5 minutes or until heated through.  My chowder was still watery so I continued to stir and cook until it thickened slightly (another 5 to 10 minutes).  While stirring, I also mashed some of the potatoes with the back of my spoon against the side of the pot.  Would definitely make again.

Great base to adapt to your liking!  I halved the entire recipe.  I added about 1/2 cup diced celery, used fat-free half and replaced the water with all clam juice instead.  Also, because I prefer my clam chowder a little thick, when cooking my bacon and onion I added the butter and then a little corn starch to make a ruux as others had suggested.  Thanks for sharing!

Love this soup! I did make some changes though, I included a cup of chopped celery, 4 sliced hard boiled eggs and 1/4 cup cornstarch with the same amount of water to make a slurry for additional thickening.

I changed a lot, just because it was what I had on hand. But it is basically the same recipe. I followed other reviews and used clam juice to cook the potatoes ( I never use water in a recipe like this unless it and drained off and even then it adds flavor to whatever is cooked in it. I would add celery which is a common ingredient in clam chowder. I like the bacon.

One note, I used the Hormel Real Bacon Crumbles instead of the actual bacon since I didn't want all of the bacon grease in the Chowder.  I sauteed it first and then I added the onions and proceeded with the rest of the recipe.

Very good recipe.  I used 2% milk, 1 chicken boullion cube, and a pinch of dried thyme, the liquid from two cans of clams.  I will make again.  This recipe is very adaptable.

It came out GREAT! The only change I made was to remove the bacon after frying it.

I made a double batch as well as added corn and fresh carrots. Added pepper and substituted more clam juice in place of any water. Everyone came for seconds and took some home. It’s now a Christmas tradition.

I used this recipe as a guide and added a few  things:  diced celery, Old Bay Seasoning, fresh minced garlic, cayenne and butter/flour (for thickening). I didn’t add the water, but used a bottle of clam juice and 3 tins of baby clams with all their juice. After simmering until potatoes were cooked, I used only about a cup of 18% cream.

I enjoyed this very much, of course there were a few changes as I made it into a seafood chowder
I would double the clams/ seafood  and sub clam juice for water as I like a strong clam flavor ~ I do very much enjoy this recipe though and thank you very much for sharing this recipe, it will always be my go to

The only things I did differently is use 3 parts clam juice 1 part water and instead of thickening, I mashed a few of the potatoes which made the perfect consistency.  Seems too simple to be true, we'll see what my husband thinks....Clam Chowder is his favorite.

Generally very good soup.  Too many onions, but then one and a half cups instead of my read of 1 and 1/2 onions puts that fully on me. lol  I used 3/4 of a large yellow onion and that was a LOT, probably close to double what was called for. 

Bacon should be crisped completely. I found adding the onions stopped the crisping process and finished steaming the bacon which gave some of the fattier bits a less than appealing chewy texture.

With these two modifications, this will be an outstanding recipe that I will make again.

Followed it to the tee with exception of using stock instead of water.  I had to rescue it as it was brothy and runny.  I removed a cup of the hot liquid and whisked in some flour to make a slurry and added it back.  I also used a potato masher on the soup and that thickened it up and turned it to chowhdah!   Restaurant quality and the family mopped up the bowls with sourdough bread.  Perfect but has to be thickened.  Recommend a small dice on the potatoes.

After reading reviews, I made some minor changes.  I added 3 Tbsps. of flour to bacon grease and used clam juice instead of water.  Diced the potatoes small and had no issues with them.
My New England born mother would have loved this, as did I.

I thought this was really good. I made it with fresh Razor Clams so I wanted something fairly plain because I wanted to be able to really taste the clams. I will make it again, but I may add some flour or cornstarch to thicken slightly.

So good!!  Followed a few review recommendations and this turned out so good.  1) used a bottle of clam juice and drained clam juice for the liquid I boiled the potatoes in.  2) added 2 tbsp of flour and cooked 5 min to make a little thicker.  Get it too thick, add water.  Easy and delicious!

Of course I made changes because other reviews all said to do so. I added 1 TBs. butter and 2 TBs. Flour to the bacon and onions to make a rouix. My potatoes were small cubes so they would cook. I substituted the water using the other half of the reserves of clam juice, 1 c. Chicken broth, and a cup of actual clam juice. I lightly mashed the potatoes to help with the thickness. Everything else was the same and I got rave reviews.

Delicious. I read the prior reviews and was concerned about the chowder being too thin and the doneness of the potatoes, so I used one cup water to boil the potatoes in rather than one and a half, and I used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half. I also put all the clam juice in because people said it didn't have enough clam taste. Next time, I'm going to substitute the clam juice for the water to boil the potatoes to try and thicken it up a bit more. But the way I made it was very very tasty.

Loved It!! We are doubling the recipe so our family will have leftovers. It is so rich and tasty, the only thing we changed is we are going to use 1 1/2 cups of 1/2 & 1/2 and 1 1/2 cups of milk, just to cut down on a few calories.

New Englander born and bred. Great soup! Just like the chowder I remember my mother making. I followed the recipe as is. Homemade chowder was always a thin base when I was growing up. If you cook the potatoes in the clam juice and then add the leftover juice in, it thickens up just enough. It's not supposed to be really thick.  Really, really good! Thanks for the trip down memory lane. :)

Sooooo easy and delicious! I'm not one for exact measurements so I guessed mostly lol! I also omitted the butter. I think the bacon and cream adds enough fat.  It's definitely a great base recipe to change as per your own likes but it's also great as is. This one is going in my book. Thank you!

Very tasty but two watery. Fried the cubed potatoes before I added them to the soup, also made a mixture of 3 tablespoons of flour and some clam juice and added it to the soup to make it thicker.

I read the reviews before I made my clam chowder and sauté my onions in butter then added my crumbled bacon and made a roux. I also used 3 cans of clams plus used some of the juice from them for added flavor.  I used both half n half and heavy cream.  I got a little bit to much bacon in mine because my bacon was already cooked and finely crumbled and I had no idea how many pieces were in my little sandwich bag (hubby had done the bacon a few days before).  Still turned out delicious but I do highly recommend making a roux to thicken this chowder which makes it taste just that much richer.  I'll be making this more often in the future.  Very Good flavor!

Made this with 5 slices of bacon . . . because BACON. Used red potatoes and left the skin on. 
Substitute 1 cup of half and half with 1 cup of heavy cream, to thicken add 1 to 2 TBSP of flour and combine with a whisk. (Be careful not to whip)

With a few tweaks, this was delicious! I added 1 more strip of bacon and instead of 3 c half and half, I did 1 c heavy cream, 1 c half and half and 1 can cream of celery soup. I then added the 2nd half of clam juice (heated)  and added just enough corn starch to thicken the soup.

I used 3 cans of oysters instead of fresh. Even my 6 year old granddaughter said it's the best soup she's ever had.

Just made a big pot! like some others, I made a couple modifications.
1. Added a little garlic and celery when cooking the bacon.
2. I used chicken broth instead of water.
3. Added cornstarch/chicken stock mixture to thicken it up. 
4. Added a 5th can of clams. I lime mine meaty!
Very good recipe and came out amazing! My wife had only tasted some of the canned version before. My 5 year old had never had it and devoured his whole bowl.

This is a really good basic clam chowder recipe.  I liked the fact that the time for cooking the potatoes was minimal, because I do not like my potatoes mushy.  The proportions of ingredients was very good.  I make corn stock with frozen corn on the cob, simmering a couple of corn cobs with the corn cut off in water to cover for at least a half hour, then discard the corn--unless you like it a little overcooked.  If more liquid is needed for the soup, and boy do we like the "juice,"  then I add clam juice.  Plain water just does not give a good depth of flavor.  That's the only change.  I do love clam chowder made with fresh clams, but it is tooooo expensive!  The instructions in this recipe for adding the clams at the last minute and not letting them boil is genius!  If your soup is a little thin, add a cornstarch slurry before adding the clams.  YUM!

This was fantastic. I used clam juice instead of water and used 2 cups of cream. Otherwise I followed the recipe, and it was the best soup ever.

As is, the recipe is a three star. It was very loose like a soup instead of thicker like a chowder. Before I made it, I read a good number of reviews and found a few helpful tips. I made two separate batches. One using the directions from the original recipe and the second using the following changes.  a) don't bother draining the clams. Keep them in the juice and just dump them into the chowder at the same time. This saves time and cleanup. b) add all of the clam juice, not just half. The extra juice adds more clam flavor to the chowder. 
c) Only add 2 1/2 cups of the cream at first then after adding the clams and juice, add the remaining cream that has been mixed with 3-4 Tbsp of flour or cornstarch to thicken the broth into a chowder. After I found that the chowder with the changes looked and tasted better, I altered the first, three -star batch with more clam juice and some cream/flour to fix it. My family thought it was very tasty. The ingredients are well balanced. It just needed a few tweaks to the method and the thickening.

I have made this clam chowder numerous times.  After the first time around, I declared it my favorite recipe for New England Clam Chowder.
But I can never repeat myself so...next time I tried something just a little different.  No major change detected so...I did this a few more times, always just a little something here or there, but always delightful.
Tonight, I apparently made enough changes, I hit a nerve with my family.  All were raving that this was the best ever...what did I do to make it so good...and me myself...something was really different and soooo good...;)
My changes were simple...I used bottled clam juice instead of water, added more bacon...a good half pound but....I added some dried Tarragon...1/2 - 3/4 teaspoon is all but it did change the flavor just enough to say I'd do it again.  The clam juice....just added a little more body and clam flavor but...I can't honestly say that was what the major difference was.
I still love the original recipe and I will continue to use it.  I will just make the same changes and call it good!!!

Good recipe.  Can be better, I think!   Us folks in the PACNW mostly like our "chowdah" thick.   Thicken to taste with flour blended into the cream - how thick?  Some of my buddies would like to eat it with a salad fork, I think!   And the clam taste...I use 2 bottles of clam juice, and ALL the juice from the cans, no water.  If you don't like the rich clam taste, save your money and make "tater soup"! Try finely chopping some celery into it as you bring it to simmer, and - a couple minutes before adding the cream, -stir in some finely chopped green onions, with plenty of the green part.  Finally, why peel spuds?  Use new potatoes scrubbed and diced.  Last, add the clams at the very last just to warm them.  Yum!

Nowhere near my favorite and supplemental instructions modifying the recipe certainly did not help.

Overall, adjusted recipe was hard--to-follow. It needs to be incorporated and reconstructed from scratch.

Did not thicken substantially and wasn't "clammy" enough. Takes the word "delicate" to a whole new level.

I have made this many times with some variations. I like the big cans of chopped clams with all the liquid. I've been know to use salt pork instead of bacon sometimes. I've been known to add sometimes celery and/or corn to my chowder. One trick I use to thicken the chowder is add some instant potatoes.

I'm torn on this one. While the flavor was very good, I found it too thin and soupy. If a thick creamy chowder is what you're after, this isn't the one for you.

This was tasty, but not the thick and creamy New England clam chowder I know and love from my previous Boston home.  Next time, I will replace the water with clam juice and the half & half with heavy cream.  Needs all of the liquid from the clams too, not just half.  Will add more salt too.

I have made this many times for groups of people and they all loved it. Swiping bread in the pot to get it all. I do tweek it a bit with adding garlic powder, white pepper, Himalayan pink salt, old bay seasoning, and sometimes season salt. I just add what  I think will brighten the flavor up so there is no teaspoon of this or that I just add till the flavors are nicely melded.

I added some diced celery to the onions, and substituted diced Canadian bacon for the regular bacon. I also used less potatoes, and used a combination of half-and-half and condensed milk.  When it came time to add the clams, I threw in the juice from the can as well. The soup was absolutely delicious, easy, and I would definitely make it again.

I substituted turkey bacon for regular bacon when making this. When cooking the bacon and the onions, I made sure to add a little water and oil to prevent the bacon parts from sticking to the pan. I also added 1/4 bunch of Italian cilantro (finely chopped) to the ingredient list, added into the soup prior to serving. Himalayan pink salt was substituted for cooking salt to try to prevent the soup from tasting too salty.

As I've also read among the other reviews, my soup was very thin. To prevent this, I plan on adding some flour during the "add water/broth" phase of cooking to thicken the broth.

I will try to fix the watery soup issue by reheating saved portions in a pot, slowly adding flour until at the proper consistency. I did not have any flour available at the time I made this recipe so I could not correct this issue at the end phase. Also, after reading some more reviews, I plan on cooking the potatoes more thoroughly until they start losing their shape to help with thickness.

After reading reviews, I changed the recipe accordingly. It turned out amazingly well! I will definitely make this yummy soup again with the alterations.  

First, after crushing the bacon, I removed it from the grease and used it to top the finished soup so the bacon didn't get soggy. Also, I fried up a few more strips separately and used that to top the soup once finished so each bowl got about 1 strip of bacon toppings. I also topped the finished soup with a bit of dried parsley as the recipe picture shows but does not mention.

Second,  I cooked the potatoes separately (covered),  drained, then added them to the soup when it called for it. This way the soup was not extra starchy with potato water, and I could move right to the next step.

Third, I used clam juice instead of water, and also used the clam juice in the cans with the minced clams. This gave such good clam flavor! 

Fourth, I thickened the soup with flour because without it, it was quite watery, as other said. I put about 3-4 tablespoons total for the whole pot. I added two tablespoons to the onions and bacon grease, and two more at the end. 

Awesome!!!! This recipe made 13 ladles of soup ( about 13 cups)

This was good, but not quite like the clam chowders I grew up with in New England.  It seemed that the bacon overpowered everything else in the soup.  If I try it again, I'll use salt pork and see if that makes a difference, maybe add a little cream.  Like some other reviewers, I boiled the potatoes, covered, then drained them to add to the chowder.

By adding some flour, milk and butter mixture as the water boils, the soup's consistency was a better thickness- no longer watery! Although the instructions say not to boil, I boiled it for thirty minutes after adding the clams and they didn't become tough. Try it for yourself!

I have always loved New England Clam Chowder in the can but had often wanted to make it myself. I followed your recipe and it did not disappoint!  It was delicious! That is not to say I have stopped eating Progresso or Campbell's. They're still okay when time is a factor. But given the time, I make it myself now. Thanks for a great recipe!

This came out very good but I changed it slightly. Substituted some of  the water with the clam juice from the canned clams but I first thickened it a bit with flour. Otherwise followed the recipe as written.

I cook my bacon in the oven, I added a small bit of chopped garlic and chardonnay  to onions when I sauteed in butter. I used heavy cream and whole milk because it was what I had. I also used home made chicken stock (instead of water)  that I keep on hand in feezer for soups.  Excellent!

Good flavor but not as thick as I would have liked. I used chicken broth instead of water, all the clam juice and added 2 tbsp. flour as suggested.

I made it using clam juice instead of water and thickened it with a flour roux. I will definitely make it again using some celery for extra flavor.

I love this recipe & will make again & again. I do add mushrooms & double the clams. I was born and raised in Arkansas & you just can't find a good clam chowder around here. I got hooked on it when I lived in the keys. Thank y'all for this great recipe!

This is how I have made New England Clam Chowder since growing up on Cape Cod 45 years ago. The only addition I like is celery.  Just delete the water.  You can keep the juice from the clams.

My preference is to add all of the clam nectar and a few more strips of bacon and a touch of tarragon......Otherwise  this recipe is a winner.

Very good recipe with a few alterations. I added some carrots and sautéed that for about 15 mins to soften them out before adding the onions. I too used about 1 cup of half and half. I also added in a cup of water since I didn't have clam juice. I threw in corn, mushrooms right before throwing in the clams. It was thick and hearty. Very good and will definitely save this in my recipe book.

Very tasty. It's more brothy/watery than other recipes I've tried though, so if you're looking for a thick, creamy soup, this isn't it.

Changes were made out of necessity. ...added 2 C. Heavy Cream and only 1 TBSP of butter. Used  Chicken Broth instead of water. Added fresh thyme. AND this recipe must be thickened (used cornstarch). Ending chowder was delicious.

This is the best recipe by far for my taste. However, I substituted 1 cup of heavy whipping cream for a cup of Half and half. I used a whole pack of bacon instead of a few pieces. Cooked my onions in left over bacon grease and since I like a thicker soup. I added a little starch.

I made this but after reading reviews I did it I bit different.  Well the main thing I increased the amount of ingredients and made a rue with butter and flour to thicken it up and I added old bay and oregano.  Tasted great.

This was a taste of the sea! I'm from New England so I made a few changes. Omitted bacon, I used cans of boiled clams and the clam juice from those in place of the water! Will definitely be making again!

Cooked bacon and removed to paper towel then added near end of cooking time. I used chicken broth. Made a rue using cornstarch with butter to thicken soup. I'm gluten free. Used 2 6 1/2 ounce cans of Clams and used all the juice from 1 can. Excellent!

I made this as a surprise for my husband, a Maine born and bred N.E. Clam Chowder lover.  I gave it to him to sample and asked him what it needed and he said, "clams?" I added more clam juice and he then said it needed "flavor".  So, overall, I followed the recipe except that I used clam juice instead of water. I boiled my potatoes in clam juice, too. For seasoning, I used some Old Bay and pepper.  I had to add about a cup of instant mashed potatoes because my husband said it was too thin.   After all was said and done, he liked it and said he would eat it again. Next time I will add more potatoes and smash them a bit for thickening. I will add more clam juice and use all of the reserve juice from the clams as well.  I am a Midwestern gal and our seafood came shaped like "sticks" and so I have nothing to compare this soup with, but I will continue to tweak this one until my hubby gives it a solid two-thumbs up.

I have not tried this exact recipe, but the one I use is as close to that as you can get. I grew up in New England where we had clam chowder. I moved south and the first time I had clam chowder , all I could think of was wallpaper paste!!!Do not like thick clam chowder.  I like clam chowder with lots of clams and clam broth!!

It's a fantastic recipe. As other reviewers suggested, I cooked potato separately until ready and added flour to the soup to thicken. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

I can't give full stars only because I had to change it up. Like all reviewers said it was too watery with half and half so I opted for 1.5 C heavy and 1.5 C half. I also added minced garlic to the onion and bacon. After all the ingredients were cooked down I lightly mashed the cubes of the chowder to thicken it more. Overall the chowder yielded great results!

Tasty but I added more clam juice. Does not get thick at all.  Will not make again.  I will give it 3 stars just for taste.

I did Like the recipe But i also did as a few others...I cooked the chopped onions and diced bacon in a few tablespoons of melted butter, then added a couple of tablespoons of flour thus creating a roux. Otherwise, I followed the recipe, but omitted water and substituted more clam juice instead, doubled the potatoes. After the potatoes were cooked through in the clam juice, I reduced the heat to a low simmer, then I added twice the amount of clams (I used 1 8 0z can of minced clams and 28 once baby whole) (servings for 12)
Also I added 3/4 cup of diced Portobella mushrooms.The mushrooms were added when potatoes were almost done.

this recipe is a great base. this was my first try at clam chowder and I would omit water,and replace with clam juice. I had to thicken. I used cornstarch instead of flour. all in all the chowder was bland.but not to say it can be improved.

This soup is great! The whole family loved it. I had to thicken it up by taking out a small amount of liquid & whisking in some flour . Then added this " slurry" back in the soup. The result was Perfection!! I will be making this again !

Followed the ingredients listed exactly and took the advice from Texas2Step for cooking potatoes and adding more clam flavor. My husband and I loved this soup! This was my first experience making clam chowder, it had always intimidated me before but this was very simple and DEEEELICIOUS!

My first attempt at making New England Clam chowder left empty bowls and happy tummys behind. I did make some changes to this, but for the most part it was quite a big hit. I'm quite a fan of heat. Added jalepeno sauce and a bit of sriracha to the bacon and onions. I also  covered the potatoes while they cooked, only used 3/4 cups of water and 1/2 cup of vegetable broth. Used 3 cans of clams and poured one can if clam juice Ito the soup. I also used one tbsp of flour to thicken the soup After the cream was added.

By far, the best clam chowder ever. I make a few alterations to suit our tastes... I add a few more slices of bacon(cuz who doesn't like more bacon?), more clams & I add a slurry of cornstarch & water to thicken it slightly. Soooooooo goooooooood

I tried this recipe. I loved it! And that was a real big deal for me because I have never liked clam chowder. I would not eat a clam. My husband loves clam chowder. So I looked for a recipe so that I could make it for him. I don't really like to buy it in the can. I followed the recipe to the letter. It came out perfectly! It was so delicious! I am now a clam chowder lover. Yup! Wonderful! Try it for yourself. You will love it. Thank you Debbie2. :o)

I really liked this, except that I want more clam flavor.   I had used about 50% more clams than the recipe called for and 100% of the juice.   I started out with half the juice, as the recipe called for, and it tasted more like potato soup, so I added the rest of the juice, which helped a lot, but left the chowder not as thick as I would like.   I should have probably mixed corn starch in with the juice and then used heavy cream instead of half and half, but 2 cups instead of 3.   I think that would have given me what I wanted.   The other option would be to add in some clam base.   I think this is a great base recipe and will use it as a guide the next time I make this.   Thanks!

this is my go to recipe!  I follow it pretty much EXACTLY except that i drain the clams and use ALL of the juice.  I also sauteed the bacon... then added the onion... then added 1/4 cup flour so that it would thicken the soup.  then I added the clam juice and boiled the potatoes till they were tender.  IT WAS PERFECT!

turned out very well. the kids ate it all (rare for them). I really liked this version. I added two filets of thin white fish (cubed) to it to make it more of a seafood chowder. I really like this recipe!

I was very skeptical when my fiance (who is from New Hampshire) found this recipe and wanted to try it.  I never thought we would find anything like what he used to get back home.  We both thought it was the BEST clam chowder we had every had!  His only complaint was that he is used to thicker chowder but that is an easy adjustment.  I can see how adding a few things might make this an even better recipe than it already is, but for the first try we made it as is.  Thanks for sharing and giving my future hubby a taste of home!

My husband says the best clam chowder he has ever ate.  This is a keeper.  I used clam juice instead of water and used heavy cream instead of half and half.  It was awesome.  Everything else was perfect.  I always use heavy cream when making a chowder or cream soup.  No calorie counting here, but love the richness it addes to the soup.

Perfect clam chowder recipe for gluten free!. I have used this recipe for years, my whole family loves it. Even the picky 6 year old. I cook the potatoes to my liking, and use 2% milk, because that is what i normally have in the fridge. If I want it a little thicker then I add some corn starch, my sister has celiac disease. I also like to add carrots and celery with the onion to make it a little heartier.

I've been wanting to try a clam chowder for so long and I decided to give this recipe a try. Making it, I was reminded of the cream soups I usually made - saute veggies, add a roux, add cream, etc. Maybe it was the fact that I only used 2 cans of whole baby clams and 2% milk (I accidentally wrecked the 3 cups of half-and-half I'd set aside for this recipe so had to substitute) that made the final product just "meh". I added some carrots, celery and a can of peaches and cream corn (which I usually love in the canned versions of clam chowder), and it was still missing something - it was still a bit bland. Pureed some of the clams and potatoes...still not right. Finally, I added a packet of chicken stock and had my "AHA" moment! Next time, I'll try using all clam juice and NOT mess up the cream! Overall, a good recipe.

Best soup I've made yet! I followed another review almost to a tee (DManfredi's review). I used 3 cans of clams and saved all the liquid and used that instead of water. We used turkey bacon instead of bacon so there wasn't much bacon grease, but I love the idea of using the bacon grease for flavor. I only used 2 cups of half and half because I only have a medium sized pan (have to invest in a bigger pan soon) but when we reheat the leftovers I will add more. I'm glad we used 3 cans because we had lots of clams in every bite. I've only ever had clam chowder from a can, so this really knocked my socks off! Thanks for the recipe!

To me, this was just average.  It reminded me of corn chowder more than clam chowder.  It was still good, but will keep looking for more of a restaurant style quality recipe.

Like many of the others I made some alterations to the original recipe: 1 cup of heavy cream in place of 1 cup of half-and-half; added all the clam juice; at the end, brought it to a boil and stirred (and stirred and stirred). I added 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper and it was not enough. Will try a full teaspoon next time. Still got rave reviews from a 12-person party. I will definitely make this again.

This chowder was fantastic!  It was thick and tasty.  I added corn and a touch of garlic powder to the mix.  Another variation is using fish.  It makes an amazing fish chowder if you replace the clams with haddock or cod fish!

Great recipe! Instead of adding more salt for flavor, I added more clam juice and cut down on salt. Next time, I'll probably add some flour or starch to the broth so it's a bit more creamy. Lactose intolerant people should be very careful when eating this because this is very heavy in dairy!

Tasty I would cook bacon longer and I made it with 1/2 non-fat and 1/2 whole milk. I am sure I would like the heavier milk but wanted to lower calories a little.

This was delicious! I did make a few changes - I used a little bit more bacon, added a clove of garlic and some chopped celery and also used clam juice in place of the water. I did use the half and half but also made a roux to thicken it up a bit. It was really, really good! Will definitely make this again!

My husband and I really liked this, I took advice of other reviewers and used clam juice instead of water and mashed some of the potatoes to make it thicker.  I also used 3 6.5 oz cans, 2 were minced clams and 1 was chopped.  I think it could have been a little clammier still.

Like some of the other reviewers for this recipe, I thought the chowder was a bit watery, so I added a tbs of flour and two tbs of cornstarch. This helped thicken it somewhat. Otherwise, this tasted delicious! I had no trouble making this recipe, and I've never done chowder before.

I loved this recipe. This is my sons favorite soup. I did add the juice from both cans of clams because we wanted the clam flavor. I also used some stock that I had made up. One time when I made it I did celery, onions, and garlic as the base. Just a little variation.

I only gave this four stars because i changed a few things.. I used heavy cream instead of half & half (none on hand) and I had to make a roux with 2 tbsp of flour added while sauteing the onions to make it a creamy soup. But my family enjoyed the flavor and suggested more clams even though I used 3 10oz cans. I agree with them fully!! Other than that.. the flavor is awesome!!

This was the best clam chowder I've ever made but was thinner than we like as written.  I made a roux with flour and butter to thicken it at the end.  It ended up very smooth, creamy and flavorful.  I doubled everything and used all the clam juice.  I used all whole milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2, still came out wonderful.  Thanks!

This recipe is very basic & easy to make. It has a good taste but is too thin for our liking. I had to add flour to thicken it up. It also could use some celery or something, just to plain for me, but a good base to start with.

I should have checked the reviews before delving into this one.  This recipe is not to my liking. Is there a II and III version because it's a work in progress. Title should be milky clam water. Huge let down for myself and my eagerly awaiting family. Back to the can, I guess.

Really good recipe. I used clam juice instead of water and I added 1/4 cup corn starch when I added the clam juice that was called for at the end of the recipe. That thickened it up nicely. Very good recipe. Will make again.

Looked at alot of the other reviews, and changed a few things, didn't use bacon, i had just boiled down a ham and used the ham instead.  Added about 2 cups of ham with the clams.  Then added garlic and other favorite spices.  I love it.

This is an excellent recipe! I made this numerous times and it always turns out great. The only thing I had done differently is use more bacon and add corn starch near the end of cooking to thicken the soup.

Loved this recipe.  Very adaptable. I added different kinds of seafood including halibut, and I threw in some half and half cream I had sitting around.  The cayenne adds a nice kick, and I added a bit extra.  I found I needed to add a bit more milk than the recipe called for.  Will definitely make this again.

This was wonderful!  My husband loved it and I will definately make it again!  I would just advise using a little less half and half and water cause it wasn't quite thick enough.  BUt really good!!

This was a very watery recipie with no substantial flavor except the bacon. It took 3/4 cup of flour to thicken it to where my husband would eat it. I think it needs more clams and clam juice and less bacon. The potatoes were good though.

This was the first time I made clam chowder, and I was quite impressed how easy and delicious it turn out to be.  I loved the bacon, added a little corn starch to thicken, and used the clam juice in place of water.  My picky 2 and 1 yr. old sons also loved this dish!  So it is bound to be one of our stand-bys.

This tasted just like clam chwder in a restaurant!!!  I added 1 t each of oregano, garlic salt, and celery salt.  I also forot the butter and it was still great.  As others, I added about 2 T corn starch.  I also didn't have half and half, so i used half heavy cream and half non fat milk, and still great!  As others, I also used more water, but it still mostly evaporated and i ended up almost frying the potatoes.  Excellent recipie...very recomeded (my boyfriend LOVED it served with sourdough bread)

This was a great recipe, however I was hoping it would have been a little thicker.  After reading through a few more reviews I too will try some thickening ingredients.  I did use the clam juice  in place of the water and thought it was a good addition.

my boyfriend says this chowder is "awesome"  he loved the taste of bacon in the mix.  i followed the others advice and used clam juice instead of water.  i also used more clams than asked for to make it chunky.  since he likes his chowder thick i also added corn starch.  will definately make this again!

This totally reminded me of the clam chowder I ate as a child when I lived in Vermont.
We loved it!  I did thicken with a flour/water paste and I also doubled the recipe--needed leftovers for lunch!

The bacon was too strong and can be completely omitted.  Otherwise...okay.  More like baked potato soup with clams.

this clam chowder was incredible!
I only added 1 potatoe and then the remainder I added chopped celery. This proved to be delicious!
My Dad eagerly asked for more, but unfortunately there was none!
Thanks Debbie for an awesome recipe!

This was a good starter recipe for me, as Ive never made Clam Chowder before. 

For others reference, this is exactly what I used (as far as the original recipe, combined with the changes based on other reviews):
1 SMALL diced onion, 3 slices of bacon, 2 medium potatoes- small cubed, 3 cans of 6.5oz minced clams, 1 pint of 12  12, 1 cup of heavy cream, 12 bottle of clam juice (give or take), 3 tablespoons of butter and salt  pepper to taste.

Instead of the water in the recipe, I used the juice from the 3 cans of clams, and added a touch more of the bottle clam juice... kinda eyeballed it.

Definitely an easy recipe, and faster than any soup Ive ever made

A great, basic recipe. Easy to follow, and easy to add on. My kids eat it up, my husband takes leftovers to work with him the next day. We prefer this chowder as is, garnished with a bit of green onion and crumbled fresh bacon. It doesn't get any better than this!

We loved it!  I took the various suggestions and replaced water for clam juice, and also added both minced and chopped clams from three cans.  I then added a can of broken up tuna slightly drained-- I'm sure salmon or one or two other types of fish would be great as well.  This gave the chowder a more fishy taste and with the addition of flour to thicken-- Bingo! This clam chowder came VERY close to the Legal Seafood chowder we go out of the way to buy and for which the Legal Seafood spokesperson said its recipe is not truly disclosed to the public--as their cookbook only has a variation!!  THANKS!!

This was a great recipe!  I added a few of my own changes, some hot sauce, garlic, only 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2, a bay leaf, no bacon, and a Tbls. of flour.  I also took advice from previos reviewers and used clam juice instead of water.  This is such a perfect chowder recipe, I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an "authentic" chowda!

This is incredibly delicious, and it's very easy to convert to a low carb/Dr Atkins way of eating if you just eliminate the potatoes. It's still rich and creamy and very satisfying. Super yum!

My test subject, my wife Ania, did not believe that I made this clam chowder until I pulled the can of clams from the garbage.  It was spectacular.  Like many others, I used clam juice instead of water and added another can 8 oz of miniced clams.  Additionally, I added just a pinch of celery salt.  Thank you Debbie! This one was a real winner

I thought it was very good.  I did do some modifications - I used fat free half and half and I left out the salt.  Also did substitute some of the water for clam juice.  When I served it, I added a little Cream sherry.  It really was great.  Thanks, Debbie for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

This is a wonderful, rich and creamy chowder recipe that is simple to prepare and even better the next day. I usually add 1 additional can of clams and thicken just a bit with sifted flour...fabulous!

This was REALLY good.  It is definitely resturant quality.  My husband and six year old son both loved it.  I will make this often.

This recipe was delicous. My whole family (and there are seven of us) loved it. I added extra bacon... it made it even crunchier and chewier--definitely a make-again meal.

This recipe was delicious!!!!  I used 3 cans of clams instead of 2 which I thought was a good move.  I will make this at least once a month!!!

I have been looking for a really good chowder recipe and this was it!!! I did follow the advice of another cook who tried this and added flour to thicken it up!! I also used less water and more clam juice. My husband, 3 and 2 yr. olds loved it too!!! Will make again and again!

This made a good chowder, but not a great one. To improve this recipe, I used cream in place of half and half and doubled the clams.
