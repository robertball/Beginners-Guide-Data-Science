I didn't have any peanuts but used cashews in stead. Recipe didn't mention how much nuts to use but it turned out yummy. Very lite and satisfying. Will make this again.

The sauce is really good, however, I did add 1 tbsp. of Hoisin. Also, I prefer a crunch so added 1/4 cup of peanuts. Water chestnuts or carrots would work too. Next time I will chop in mushrooms and red peppers. Great flavours.
