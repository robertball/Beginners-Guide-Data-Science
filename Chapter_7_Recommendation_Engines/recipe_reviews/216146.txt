This gets 5 stars for what it is...simple and different. It is actually quite mild, which surprised me, but it could be the age of my spice. I had last minute surprise guest come who said she would/could not eat okra unless it was fried due to the slime factor. Well, on seeing this, she said...let me try a "No, thank you portion." So, I fixed up a tiny serving, which (believe me... she would have had no problem consuming only a nibble of), and she ate the whole portion, noting that it was not slimy, even though it was definitely not fried. So, another star added for reducing the slime factor on boiled okra. Thank you for sharing this recipe, I think it would be good combined with some shredded chicken for a pita filling.

Good ingredients, but there's no 'wow' factor to the taste.  Easy to prepare.

A nice simple dish. I served it over millet, and used fresh tomato & tomato paste.

Turned out great served over rice AND my 5 yr old enjoyed it. Easy to prepare. Made the recipe as is with the suggestion of using fresh (2 Cherokee Purple heritage) tomatoes. Delicate flavors of the veggies, turmeric and rice made a great meatless meal.

Loved this recipe! I did make one alteration.  I used canned diced tomatoes in addition to the tomato paste!  Fantastic recipe.  I will definitely be making this again!  I served over rice.

This tasted really great. Took it to a family dinner and it was a hit. It was really good to eat with rice.

This is a follow-on to my earlier post. I made this as is except I added about 1/3 C chopped tomatoes as recommended by others. I truly dislike okra but my husband Ioves it.  This recipe is “palatable” for me, served over rice.

I love okra and left mine whole, I used garlic since I didn't  have turmeric. I will try the recipe again with turmeric and like the idea of serving this side dish over rice. I am Greek and love the okra with feta cheese.

Delicious I used red Palm oil instead and I added green juice pulp for some more flavour. Yummy

Excellent recipe for okra. Followed the exact recipe and my dish turned out flavoured to perfection.
