This would be better named Chocolate Orange Chewy Truffles, to avoid people expecting any crunch! The flavor was 5 stars, as great as the quality of the chocolate & marmalade used. I used Ghirardelli's "Bittersweet", with 60% Cacao. Instead of Smucker's "Simply Fruit", I used a fine French marmalade, which I whirled in a mini food processor because the orange peels were 2 inches long! The texture lowered the rating to 2 stars: as I figured would happen, but hoped wouldn't, the Rice Krispies cereal 1st became chewy, then soft.  They also aren't "truffles"! I'd only make this again if I tried a cereal that is likely to remain crunchy (like GrapeNuts), or with ground almonds.
