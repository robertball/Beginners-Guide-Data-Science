I would rate this 10 stars if I could! There is nothing about this tart that I don't love--it's absolutely delicious, it's relatively easy to make, and it's beautiful! I used raisins and walnuts in the crust, and baked it in a 9-inch springform for 12 minutes. In the filling, I used plain Greek yogurt that I added a little honey and vanilla extract to. I would recommend creaming the cream cheese until it's completely smooth before adding in the yogurt (to avoid lumps). I also omitted the stevia, since I added honey to the yogurt. I topped it with strawberries, oranges, bananas, kiwis, and blueberries. This tastes kind of cheesecake like; so it's like you're eating something really bad for you, but it's actually pretty good for you! I love it, thank you!

I made this with a pretzel crust due to a friend's nut allergy,  and it turned out great.

This got rave reviews from friends, especially one who can't eat any sugar. I used various fruits including kiwis- anything to make a range of colors.
