This recipe is delicious!!! I replaced asparagus with green beans because I cannot get one in my local grocery store... i love the colors and different tastes I got in every spoon. Love it!

Wonderful vegetables flavors shine through in this dish. I did add one zucchini from my garden to this recipe. I served it over brown rice for a meatless meal. Very filling and it made a big serving! Will use again since it's so easy and can be so versatile.

I did make a few changes as my family does not like eggplant. I roasted radishes instead - was a huge hit! I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine. Will make this again.

I made this to eat as a hot vegetable side dish. I added mushrooms thinly cut celery tiny baby carrots and didn't use any of the dressing ingredients. Delicious and will definitely make it again. I roasted the vegetables mixed them together and stored them in the refrigerator overnight. 15 minutes was the perfect baking time to get the veggies tender crisp so I can reheat tomorrow without them becoming limp and soggy.
