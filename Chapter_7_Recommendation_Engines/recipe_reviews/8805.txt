I've been cooking for over 50 years and during that time I have fried chicken hundreds of time. But...in all those years never have I fried chicken that comes even close to being as crispy, moist and delicious as Ms. O'Neill's "Crispy Fried Chicken". Without a doubt, her recipe is THE BEST fried chicken I've ever prepared or eaten. Not only is
it delicious and crispy hot right out the frying pan, but when warmed up the next day in the oven, the chicken is as crispy as ever. 
Thank you, Ms. O'Neill for sharing your wonderful recipe

5++ star rating for this one, Elaine! Your techinque works wonderfully. This plus some tried and true ways, give the most perfect fried chicken every time. Correct oil temp is necessary, about 375, and it takes a while to get that hot. I also brine (soak in salted water) any chicken I prepare and this assures moistness no matter what the cooking method. I have tried many seasoning combos, depending on the mood, and they all are super, as long as you follow Elaine's way of preparation. Simply the best fried chicken I've ever made!

I used boneless filets and cut it into strips. I usually coat my chicken in eggs before flouring them but the buttermilk worked 100 times better. The chicken was more tender and moist than it normally is when I fry chicken. Great prep instructions. I also found that I can freeze the chicken after it is coated in the flour. So, I can just pull it out of the freezer the next time I want to make some and it will be a lil' quicker. And for a fun variation, every now and again I add garlic powder and dried parmesan to my flour mixture. Then after I fry up my strips, I throw them on top of some pasta with marinara sauce and top with fresh mozzarella and parmesan cheeses to make a quick and easy chicken parmesana! My family loves it and I can't get rid of my friends when I make it. There is never, never, never any leftovers!

This is my recipe and I'm flabbergasted with the wonderful reviews!! Thank you all so much!  I haven't been able to edit the recipe, but would like to add that you can add any seasonings you like, it's all personal preference. I didn't include a lot of spices because everyone has their own preference. Please don't complain about it being bland if you don't add your own spices, thanks.  The recipe is more about technique than anything else.

OMG!  I never grew up eating fried chicken and after trying this recipe I feel deprived as a child! My husband had been asking for fried chicken for a while and I wanted it to be perfect.  Having never made this before I read through a bunch of recipes but obviously knew that fried chicken has to be moist on the inside and the breading has to be thick enough to stand up to the frying process so it can be crunchy on the outside.  So, I began with a marinade. I put the cut up chicken in a glass bowl and filled it with enough buttermilk to cover plus a couple dashes of tabasco.  I turned the chicken a few times during 6 hours.  I drained the chicken in a colander and patted it dry then breaded it in the flour.  For the flour mixture I used 3 cups flour, 1 Tbsp. garlic powder, 1 Tbsp. onion powder, 2 tsp. paprika, 1 tsp. salt. 1 tsp. pepper.  I then follwed the steps outlined in this recipe.  We used an electric fryer so our cooking time was a bit less than 30 minutes.  You have to watch your chicken closely.  I don't know which I like better - fried chicken that's fresh out of the frier warm or cold out of the fridge the next day.  Either way, I'm hooked! Thanks for a wonderful recipe that definitely makes "Crispy Fried Chicken"!

I rarely give a recipe an overall rating of five stars. This one deserved every one of the stars. This was a true winner, and I couldn't believe how crispy and juicy it was!  I used poultry seasoning, lots of paprika, and some garlic powder to season the flour.  I know a recipe is good when my family devours the dish and asks when the next batch will be ready.  Even my 3 year old niece ate two pieces!  Thank you *SO* much for sharing this recipe.

the fried chicken turned out to be deliciously crispy even though i made a few alternation.  i substituted buttermilk with sour milk (made from 1 cup of milk mixed with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice)  as i couldn't find any in the supermart in our country.  Marinated the chicken for few hours with little salt, pepper & paprika. i only cover the chicken for 10 mins (for a batch of 8 thighs).  there's none left to test whether chicken still remain crispy when left overnight

Great simple recipe, but i did add some changes well prep steps and tips not flavour wise. I soaked the chicken in cold ice water for 30 minutes (helps all the blood out of the meat)then soaked in room temp water with dissolved sea salt for another 30 minutes or so. Then soaked over night in the butter milk. Makes my chicken super tender and tastey. I like a really thick coat of bread so i double dip. When frying i add a stalk of celery to the oil, it deepens the color of the fried chicken without needing to overcook it. I also dont use paper towels, i recomend letting the chicken drip on a wire rack, the paper towel although it soaks some of the oil the chicken tends to reabsorb the oil making it soggy! Comes out perfect, with a side of gravy and mashed potatoes what more could you ask for!!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  I've tried (emphasis on "tried"!) to make fried chicken in the past and it's always come out all burned and crisped on the outside and still pink in the middle, then I'd try to fix it by nuking it, and ended up having it soggy and uncooked.  But the tips and recipe were both perfect!  All I did was add garlic (garlic fiends here) and paprika then followed recipe to a tee and received perfectly done fried chicken!  Woohoo!  It tasted awesome and looked super!  Hubby and I loved it and chowed down big time!  Yum!

I am eating the leftovers right now and this chicken is even better cold!  I have been making fried chicken for 10+ years and I have never been able to perfect the technique until now!  I added garlic powder to my chicken after dipping in the flour and dipped my hubby's in Texas Pete hot sauce (mixed in with the buttermilk) because he likes it hot.  I am a southern girl so I take my fried chicken seriously!  So good with gravy too!  Thanks so much Elaine!!

Incredibly good!  I also add a little garlic powder and some seasoning salt in with the flour mixture.  This is a wonderful recipe, stays crispy even after being in the fridge-when there are leftovers!  Easy and delicious recipe, thanks for sharing.

Certainly this chicken lives up to it's name... it definitely IS crispy! I read all the reviews and decided to not only brine it first, but then rinsed and soaked in a buttermilk/tabasco mixture for several hours. Added garlic powder, lemon pepper and Old Bay to the seasonings but I have to say... this chicken, although crispy yet moist, tasted like fried grease. No flavor to speak of. Will continue my search for a good recipe... although this was better cold, I will not adhere to the recipe again. I know it's not the popular opinion, but I think this recipe would definitely benefit from adding MSG (Accent). Three stars for the excellent method, though!

This is a fabulous easy recipe.  I didn't have buttermilk so I put 2tblspn of white vinegar in a pyrex measuring cup and then added milk until it got to the 2 cup line.  Let sit for 5 minutes. Voila ! You have buttermilk.  I added the tiny chicken bites into the buttermilk and then threw them in a ziploc bag with the flour and spices.  Shook.  I then put them on a tray.  To hasten the pasty like consistency that you need in order for them to crisp nicely, I wet about 2 clean paper towels wrung them and laid them on top on the chicken.  I then laid a clean kitchen cloth on top of that.  It took about 10-15 minutes for the chicken to be ready to be fried.  I made sure my oil was nice and hot.  I fried about half the batch.  On the remaining batch I sprinkled cayenne pepper.  I had regular popcorn chicken for the kids and buffalo ones for the adults. I love this recipe.  The chicken always comes out juicy and delicious and it's white meat ! I can't even imagine how good it would be with chicken on the bone.  I will always be using this recipe to fry my chicken.  My kids love it cut into small pieces. I also may try leaving the chicken in the buttermilk overnight.  I heard it's suppose to make it even juicier !  Thanks for sharing !

This was the most moist fried chicken I've ever made!  The method is what I needed to learn.  I double dipped the pieces so it took a while for the coating to get to the right texture.  The next time I might try using a cracker crumb coating for a different texture although good old flour is the favorite standby.

Amazing, amazing recipe. I never thought I could fry things until now! I learned something, too. Cast iron is THE way to go. My chicken would not fit in one pan, so I had a high-quality steel pan next to my cast iron. The chicken skin stuck to the steel, and the color never deepened beyond a light golden brown. The cast iron got a beautiful color, and almost nothing stuck to the bottom. Even though the flames were equal, the cast iron just got so much hotter. Excellent recipes, excellent tips!

I love this recipe!! It has been in the family over 100 years! This is the same way my grandmother use to make hers, and I now make mine.  The only difference is--after frying, we put the chicken immediately in a 275 oven on a rack over a cookie sheet uncovered. Lets the grease drip off and it stays warm and moist.

I DID IT!!! i successfully made fried chicken, and it was what it should be - crispy and tasty on the outside, and moist on the inside! As it seems to be the case in good recipes, this recipe uses a few ingredients, and then tells you about the method.  That was the difference. I used only chicken legs, just to try it out, and next time I will try using the whole chicken since it went so well. I added a little garlic and onion powder to the flour/salt/pepper/paprika mixture, and i was generous with the paprika. Definitely need to use a cast iron pot/skillet.  My vegetable oil was too hot the first time, and my first batch got browner than I would have liked.  i lowered the heat, and the rest came out perfect.  I drained on a drying rack as suggested instead of paper towels, and kept it warm on a baking sheet in a 225 oven with the door cracked.  Its amazing how much heat the fried chicken retains. The key here is really to let the chicken rest (I used a damp paper towel to put over the chicken, and a dish towel on top of that) before frying it, and letting that pasty consistency come thru.  I believe that is the method that makes this recipe a winner. Thank you so much, I can check off one more thing on my bucket list - successfully frying chicken ;)

I read reviewes "followed recipe to a T" but this was hard to do as the instructions were not detailed. What does "hot" mean? Another post stated 375 degrees, should it stay at 375 during the "crisping" stage and when one should turn it "down" as instructed, what temp should THAT be? I used 375 to crisp and down to about 300-325 to cook, not knowing what else to do. I cooked first batch for "30 mins" and the chicken was DRY. I took another post's advice to brine it for a bit first. Didn't help much. However, I can't deny that this chicken WAS crispy. I was hoping it would be a thicker crust. Maybe if I double dipped it, buttermilk+flour+buttermilk+flour.  I think this recipe would be more user friendly if the author would suggest cooking temperatures and types of chicken. Some pieces may take longer than others. For a novice chicken fryer like me, more detailed instruction would help a lot.  Also, I seasoned my flour a lot. If you can get your cooking times right, this could be a dandy recipe. The crust was very crisp and tasty. I would try it again and after "crisping" it, I would cook it about 15 mins the next time instead of 30, maybe then I'll have juicy chicken.

So...I decided to modify this recipe a little, to make it a little more "healthy."  First off, I used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I let them sit in the buttermilk about 15-20 min before putting them in the flour mixture.  Next, I pan fried them in about 1/2 cup of veg oil.  I fried each side until golden brown, then finished them off in the oven (on top of a rack) for about 25 min at 350 degrees.  So delicious!! I topped them with a little bit of country gravy, omg!!!

This chicken was delicious and exactly like my grandmother used to make.  I've never made fried chicken before and this recipe kicked some major a$$.  My husband said it is just like fried chicken is supposed to taste.  I didn't have a cast iron skillet, so I used a Le Crueset dutch oven and filled it almost halfway up with oil.  I dipped the handle of a wooden spoon in to see if the oil was hot enough (if bubbles crawl up the handle..it's ready).  After the chicken starts to brown I covered, set it on low heat and cooked for 20 minutes instead of 30.  PERFECT!  CRISPY!!

This is exactly the way I have been frying my chicken for the past 40 years and it always turns out perfect. I use a little more seasoning - Morton's Natures Seasons is a perfect all-purpose mixture to use instead of salt and pepper - it's just important to use enough salt. Sometimes I drain the freshly fried chicken on a rack set over a cookie sheet instead of paper towels if I am frying a lot of pieces. What makes this work is letting the flour coating rest long enough to form a paste, which seals in the hot oil and forms a barrier to prevent greasiness and hold the juices in. It's great to hear from someone else who does it this way.

It is so true...dipping the chicken in buttermilk (I let mine sit in it overnight in fridge)coating it with the flour and LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT 15-20 MIN. ON WAX PAPER and you end up with wonderfully crisp fried chicken...also, MAKE SURE YOUR OIL IS HOT, if it isn't then it is guaranteed your coating will stick to pan and come off when you turn the chicken pieces.

Can I double the 5 stars to 10? AWESOME recipe. Thank you; I can now get the chicken crispy!!!! I brine soaked the chicken for about 2 hours and then followed the directions to the T except for some spice tweeking(onion & garlic powder and a dash of cayenne for kick). Just let say all thats left is memories. One word of WARNING however; don't attempt this recipe unless you have the time to devote to it because I think if you try to hurry it along you'll be disappointed with the results.

There are a few recipes that I cook to give my wife a break in the kitchen and this is one of the best.  I have been using this recipe for a year and a half.  The first few times that I made it I made it as the recipe is listed, it is the only way to honestly review any recipe.  I have tweaked it for flavor only but not the prep method. For added flavor I brine the cut-up chicken at  1-2 hr in 1/4 cup salt, 1 teaspoon of Garlic salt, onion powder fill with water to cover the chicken.  I use 3 cups of all purpose 2 tsp garlic powder 2 tsp garlic salt 1 tbs onion powder  1 tsp paprika 2 tsp salt 1 tsp pepper. I follow the steps in this recipe but I use an electric fryer that takes 15-20 per batch until it reaches 160 on an instant read thermometer.  My wife and 5 children love this chicken and if I want any of this for cold chicken I must make it specifically for that purpose. We love it for a picnic lunch.  Thank you so much for sharing this technique.

This was pretty good, definitly crispy! I still think the recipe could use some tweaking as it was a bit bland. I fried my drumsticks in my deep fryer @ 375 degrees for about 14 min and they were done perfectly. :)

My family LOVED this chicken!!  First time mine has ever turned out crispy with the coating actually sticking to the chicken.  I am so glad I found this recipe!!  Thank you!!

For those who are wondering, it takes at least 30 minutes for the flour to turn to a paste.

This is a great recipe!  This chicken is just like this Alabama boy grew up eating from time to time.

Veggie oil works good, but you need to try this recipe with Crisco.. try it.

Justed to come back and say a few things about this recipe.  

1. Elaine's method is spot on.  It just works.  The batter doesn't fall off the chicken when turned in the skillet and it browns nicely.  Popeye's or the Colonel doesn't have anything on this recipe - the chicken is twice as tender as theirs.

2.  I wanted a spicier version for myself. so I have been playing with the batter a bit.  First thing I did was add about a 1/4 cup of Franks or Tabasco to the buttermilk and mixed it well prior to soaking the chicken.  I let the chicken marinate for 6 hours before battering with the flour+seasonings - that gave it a little more spice.

3.  Next thing I tried was was give the chicken a dry rub using "Southern Flavor" Cajun seasoning then allowing the chicken to sit in the fridge for about 18 hours prior to soaking the chicken in the buttermilk/hot sauce mixture - A little more spicy.

That's what I love about Allrecipes - you get so many ideas and it's easy to share/take as needed.

Thanks Elaine

I might be biased, because Elaine O. is my mom! But I made this chicken myself the other night, and it was totally outstanding. It blew everyone away. I used slightly more flour than the recipe called for just to ensure a really good coating. It came out nice and crispy. If you like it even EXTRA crispy, I have a trick that I learned from Chinese cooking that you can also use here. Prepare the recipe as directed. Then, let the chicken and the oil cool for about 10 min. Then, bring the oil back up to very hot and re-fry each piece quickly, only for about 5-10 seconds tops. When they cool again, they'll be super crispy. My other optional tip is to let the chicken marinate for a while (30-120 min) in buttermilk first for added moistness and flavor to the meat. Try this recipe...it's the best buttermilk fried chicken you'll find!!

Used my deep fryer and followed recipe for first batch for 13-15 minutes. To avoid second batch from being soggy, I made sure to bring oil temp back up to high before submerging second round.
first couple pieces were awesome crispy wise but a bit bland so I quickly added some seasoning salt while still hot and cooling. Next round was garlic salt and seasoning salt sprinkled on and then rubbed in with the wax paper and deep fried. I liked the second batch better, salt added before frying.The crispiness wasn't as flaky I think because they were sitting for an extra 25 minutes before cooking and had a much more soaked into skin look on the wax paper. 15-20 minutes is not quite long enough for sitting/covered on wax paper time. I also added 4 minutes more cooking wise on the 2nd batch. I will now use this as my base recipe from now on. The taste gets better the next day too..

Incredible!  I have tried a couple of recipes for fried chicked, and this one was the best yet.  I used boneless, skinless breast meat which I cut into small pieces, since I don't like dark meat and don't buy boned meats because I think it's a waste of money.  This made the cooking time required much less (less than 10 minutes total per batch).  Adding a couple teaspoons of cajun seasoning or szechuan seasoning to the flour coating mixture adding some nice flavor.

I followed the recipe and skinned the chicken pieces.  I had too much flour even for a 5# chicken but the coating turned out wonderfully, according to my husband (I don't eat meat) and he wants me to make this our standard recipe.  I fried the pieces in canola oil on medium heat in my large, shallow Le Creuset pan and did not need to lower the heat nor cover the pan.  The chicken fried evenly and absorbed very little fat.  This is a great recipe and the chicken is excellent cold as well so it's wonderful for a picnic.  Thank you, Sleepygal!

Don't miss the opportunity to not only follow a fantastic recipe, but get a free cooking lesson. Once you've followed her trick, you're going to use it always. I've been able to add spice, cracker crumbs to the flour, and even soak buttermilk with hot sauce. You must follow the technique on waiting for the paste on the chicken or nothing matters. This is foolproof, you can even work with skinless chicken!!

Used 2 chicken breasts. Need only 1/2 cup of buttermilk, 1 cup of flour, 1/2 teaspoon of paprika. While covered cook only 15-20 minutes. Only need about 1/2 cup of oil.

This recipe is awesome! I've struggled with cooking for years and frying chicken...forget about it, but I followed this as written and the chicken was sooooo flavorful. I couldn't believe that I cooked it, lol. I will use this again and again and hopefully as time goes on I won't burn it as much :p Thank you for sharing.

I was looking for a fried chicken breading recipe to do in my deep fryer, but this recipe got such good reviews that I decided to try her method.  The problem with this recipe is there are way too many things that can go wrong.  She says too heat the oil until very hot, which just isn't specific enough, and then to turn the heat down and cook for 30 minutes.  Turn it down to what? Medium? Low?  So I guess if you are very lucky at guessing this recipe could turn out well.  Mine turned out pretty grease logged and the breading was falling off.  Fortunately, the peices that wouldn't fit in my skillet, I threw in the deep fryer at 350 and they turned out awesome.  I will continue to use her coating method, but not her cooking method.

Great recipe! My family loved it. One change I made was to place the chicken in the oven and bake instead of frying. I placed the chicken on greased baking sheets and used oil cooking spray to lightly spray the chicken on top, before putting it in the oven. It turned out very crispy.

Good.  Was very crispy and the breading stayed on well.  I found the cooking time to be off.  I didn't need the 30 minutes covered cooking time.  I also didn't season the flour heavily enough.  Will use this again.

Gee, I hate raining on the parade, but this was so bland.  Really needed more seasoning & I am not into hot spicy stuff.  Did get crispy when prepared as directed.  I will not make this again.  I made the mistake of making this the 1st time for friends and I was embarrassed at the outcome.  Will go back to my standby recipe. Sorry.

This is a great fried chicken recipe.  Soaking the chicken in the buttermilk is a good tip.  I added about 1/4 cup of Old Bay seasoning to the flour mixture to add some flavor.  Old Bay has paprika in it so you can omit it and still get the color.  I sprinkled the finished chicken with salt and little more Old Bay.  I don't make fried foods very often but will always use this technique when I do splurge!

Excellent recipe.  I used 1 1/2 tsp. of salt but could of used a bit more, 1 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp. poultry seasoning. I did let the chicken marinate in the buttermilk for about 6 hrs.  Next time will only do it for 3 hrs. Reheated so crispy the next day.  Was excellent cold also.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Definitely a keeper in my recipe box.

This is a great recipe and the whole family really enjoyed it.  I added chili powder and Cavendar's Greek Seasoning to the listed ingredients.  I know that sounds weird, but I always do my fried chicken this way and it works.  With the added buttermilk/flour layering, it was excellent.  Thanks Elaine.

First time ever attempting fried chicken, so it was a bit dicey a time or two, but when it was all said and done & time to taste, I really could NOT believe I made this chicken; it was THAT good. Recipe is 5 star, for sure, but I will say that a good base knowledge of cooking techniques is helpful. I can understand some of the confusion of other reviewers as to how long to let the breaded chicken sit, what "really hot" & "reduce heat" mean specifically, how to season "to taste", etc. It is helpful to have a feel for what works for you and your kitchen.

Thank you, Elaine, for sharing this method for crispy, delicious fried chicken. This is truly as good as or better than any other chicken out there--can't wait to make this one again!

I used this recipe for dinner lastnight! This is only like the 2nd maybe 3 rd time I have ever made fried chicken and it turned out good! I only had 2 problems I was heating the oil while the chicken sat and waited for the crust to trun into a "paste like" as the directions said well after almost an hour it still looked the same to me (not paste like at all (1st problem)) so my oil got a little to hot and the chicken ended up burning (2nd problem). On the second batch that I put in the pan I just kept the chicken at the same temp and it turned out a perfect golden color and was cooked perfectly also! The only things I changed where I added hot sauce to the buttermilk and I added a few other spices to the flour. Thanks for the recipe

One tip: if you think the recipe is bland its because you didn't season to taste - so disregard any review that says this is bland. Very  helpful techniques for crispy, delicious fried chicken my best ever!! Thanks for sharing!!!

This definitely had a crispy coating. I did not use the suggested vegetable oil because I only had peanut oil on hand. Also, I did not lower the heat enough while it was covered. As a result, mine came out a little dry and over-cooked. However, my husband loved it and kept saying, "mmm...". I'll do it right next time!

I love this recipe. I've been using it now for over a year, the only thing I do different is I marinate the chicken in the buttermilk. If I don't have buttermilk? I use 2% milk and a few tbsp's of vinegar. My husband loves how crunchy it gets, and there is never any left when its done.

Great recipe. I've been frying chicken for years, but I rarely covered and simmered. It turned out great. The coating was the most even I have ever produced.

Really delicious!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast cut into "fingers".  I added some Red Hot to the buttermilk and soaked the chicken for a minute or two.  I also added a generous amount of garlic powder, salt and pepper, and some onion powder to the flour.  They cooked really fast and were very good!  Four stars instead of 5 because I added some things.

Fantastic. In all the years I've been cooking this is the most successful of my fried chicken attempts. I soaked the chicken longer than recommended and added a touch of heat but kept everything else the same. A must try.

Thank you for this cooking method! I put my chicken in brine overnight and then did a buttermilk and flour seasoned with onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and cyanne pepper. Wonderful crispy chicken!

I've fried chicken almost this way for years now.  The only thing that makes it even better is to soak overnight in buttermilk that has some hot sauce mixed into it.  The longer marinating time makes it that much juicier and more tender! This is the ONLY way to have juicy, crispy delicious fried chicken!

The chicken was good but not really that crispy. After reading the reviews I also added some Italian seasoning to the flour to give more flavor. The best part was it stayed very juicy inside.  If you have time let the chicken sit in the buttermilk overnight for for a couple of hours, it helps lock in some of that juicy flavor.

Taste your flour to check for seasoning.  I put lots of seasoned salt (about 1/4 cup) in the flour and quite a bit of pepper.  I had three grandkids running around, couldn't find my cast iron skillet, didn't have enough oil (used about 1/2 inch in non-stick skillet).  To reduce spattering I didn't allow the oil to get as hot, and I think a half hour is too long with the lid on.  But turned out ok.  I will try it again.  It really should be made as directed.

Well after one ruined top and oil splatters from one end of the kitchen to the other.  All I can say is it wasn't worth it.  I think the oil should be hot, not VERY hot, make sure you wear an apron.  Chicken was moist and chrispy but nothing to write home about.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I didn't think all that cooking time was necessary, even for bone-in chicken. However since I used chicken strips (thicker ones) of breast meat... I just cooked it for about 5-7 minutes on each side until it was golden (or caramel colored) brown and firm. I use a cookie cooling rack and paper to absorb the oil. 

Additionally I used more seasoning in my breading and I even infused my buttermilk with fresh herbs from my garden like thyme, rosemary and a little basil. I added dried lavender too since I was trying for an "elegant" fried chicken to be served cold in a picnic lunch basket. I used peanut oil to fry and we LOVED the flavor. 

For the flour I used sage, margoram, thyme, and smoked paprika. 

It had a very delicious and delicate herby flavor.

This was really good. Although, I think the name should be juicy fried chicken instead of crispy. I had a pack of chicken breasts and used that for the recipe. For the salt I did 1 tsp. but I left out any pepper. One thing I did do different is soak the chicken in the buttermilk for 30 minutes, that may have also added to the tenderness. I really liked the technique of adding the lid also. It kind of made it like broasted chicken and juicy. The season was light but tasty to. If I make again, I might just double coat it for an extra crispy and crunchy texture. A winner either way.

Yummy! I have only once before tried to make fried chicken only for it to turn out undercooked and slimy. No good! But this recipe was fantastic! The skin is crisp and the chicken is moist. 

I did take the advice of another reviewer and soak my chicken in a 1/2 c. kosher salt and 2 q. water for a 1/2 hour. I also cut the cooking time from 30 mins. to 20 mins. because it seemed like it took forever for my chicken to brown the first time around. I was afraid the chicken would dry out.

One little thing, instead of soaking in saltwater, my Mother always cut up her chicken,salted and peppered it the night before and let the chicken absorb the seasonings all night and cook it the next day. I also do this.  It's great! Try it, you'll like it.  I promise

This chicken was awesome!  This was my first time to make fried chicken, and it turned out perfectly.  I can't get over how crispy it was.  I followed the instructions to a tee.  The only thing I might do differently is add more salt.  being my first time, I didn't know how much was too much or too little.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I give this recipe 4.5 stars. I made this for my house and everyone went back for seconds. I followed the prep and cooking instructions as stated, but had to replace the buttermilk for egg since I didn't have any on hand. In the future, I'll add some more seasoning to the flour batter to give it some extra flavor.
For anyone having issues with the batter cooking correctly, heat the oil at medium-high heat (8 on a scale of 10) before starting step one. Then after browning both sides, drop heat down to medium low heat (3-4 on a scale of 10).

I made this, just now, exactly as the recipe dictates. That whole "LET IT SIT" in the #2 instruction is serious business, folks. I let mine sit for about 35 minutes. The oil was certainly hot enough (I checked) BUT the first batch didn't fare very well. The coating came off a couple of the pieces. Still edible, though, so I'll be using those pieces in a salad for lunch tomorrow. The second batch which, of course, sat with its flour coating a full half-hour longer than the first, came out perfect. Excellent! That's the trick here: let that chicken sit in its flour coating for a while; I recommend an hour, minimum. Oh yeah, as an added note, I'll say that I threw in some other spices with the paprika in the flour: onion powder, garlic powder, yada yada. Throw in what you like. You know what to do.

This was pretty yummy! Just make sure you don't make your oil too hot because if it's too hot, the outsides will cook faster (even burn) and the insides of the chicken won't be finished. Other than that, it was good!

The best fried chicken EVER, hands down! The ONLY thing I did different was put a few small cuts in the chicken and filled them with my blend of spices that I love, before dipping in the buttermilk. If you follow cooking method exactly your chicken will not be hard or dark or burnt, if this happens you did something wrong because there is nothing wrong with this method as it works VERY well. Some of you who say it is bland just spice it up some more to your liking! Thank you for sharing. This is my husband's favorite whenever I make it he is one happy man!!

A great method.  I used more paprika than the recipe described (about 1 table spoon).  But letting the chicken sit for about ten minutes after being coated in flour made a big difference.  The chicken was moist and crispy.

Delicious. I made this as written and it was excellent. The only thing I will do next time is start checking the temperature at 20 minutes. I cooked it for 30 minutes and it was quite a bit past 165*. I also didin't need to use 2 quarts of oil in my pan. I needed about 2 cups. We had a couple of pieces today and it was good even cold. Thanks I will make this again.

I have made something similar to this for years. I started out with this idea but it was very bland. I found that if you add hot sauce (Texus Pete or Slap Yo' Mamma) to the buttermilk it gives the meat a great flavor base(buttermilk is a key to good fried chicken). I also add salt/pepper/dried sage/dried rosemary/dried parsley (herbs ground into a powder) to the flour. I don't normally keep paprika but can't say it wouldn't be good in the mix. Adding these ingredients to the flours gives it a better flavor takes on a KFC like quality but better cause I don't like KFC too greasy, salty etc. I can control the spice amounts to my families taste and it is an all the way round winner for the base recipe. AS Posted the recipe Needed Kicked up a notch by additional ingredients. When frying I do cover with a lid after the chicken has been browned on both side it seems to lock in the moisture better when done this way and by sealing off the chicken by browning first this keeps everything crispy. 
FYI to those who's coating is coming off your grease in my experience isn't hot enough.

great recipe. I did something my grandmother showed me, soak the chicken, especially leg quarters, in salted water. Gets rid of veins and excess blood around the bones.

OMGOMGOMGOMFG!  Fried chicken would be my last meal if I was on death row.  I'd die of a clogged artery before anyone could inject the lethal stuff...  Having said that, I've searched for years for the best recipe, and THIS IS IT!!  I didn't measure anything.  Poured some buttermilk in a dredging pan and threw in the flour, salt, pepper & lots of paprika in a Ziploc.  Let it rest in the fridge until it became a paste-like consistency & took it out for about 15 minutes before cooking so it was at room temp.  Filled my cast iron pan halfway with oil. More cooking time on breasts with the rib but it was worth the wait. SO GOOD.  Thank you!!

It was the technique in this recipe that intrigued me.  Many times I have fried chicken, esp. larger pieces like thighs, large legs and breasts, only to cut into them to see they were still red in the center.  This method not only ensures a perfectly crisped crust, but also good internal cooking.  My mom always taught me to season the chicken before frying, so the night before I sprinkled each piece with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.  Chicken sat all night in the fridge.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  There are literally hundreds of fried chicken recipes out there, but this is the best I have found.

The two stars are for the crispiness.  The recipe claims it would be crispy and it was.  However, that was all it was.  It didn't taste that bad but it lacked flavor ENTIRELY.  I will try this recipe again but I will add more flavor after performing further research of other recipes.

This was the thing I've been looking for and trying to achieve for a long time! The chicken came out great!

Even when I reheated it in the foil package this morning the batter was still stuck on and crispy. 

The only alts I made were: granulated garlic, more paprika, poultry seasoning and well crunched up cornflakes to add to the flour.

Thank you for the recipe!

I am a rookie cook and this was my first time frying chicken. However, the results were incredible. My family loved the chicken which was every bit as moist inside and crispy on the outside as the majority of other reviews stated. The best part was how easy it was to prepare to get such an awesome result.

One of my daughters favorite recipes... Let the chicken marinade in the butter milk and a little chopped garlic over night. Then double bread it if you want it extra crispy. Totally yummy!

This is the first time I made fried chicken and the results came out way better than I expected. The reason I gave this recipe a four is because I added other spices to bring out the flavor more but the technique was awesome. I will make this again & again. My family loved it!!

This was my first attempt at fried chicken.  Like other reviewers have said, the directions are a little vague - what's hot and what's the temp for reduced heat?  But I tried it.  The chicken was pretty bland.  I did marinate it in the buttermilk for about 4 hours and I have no idea if that helped.  I also had a little trouble keeping the batter on the chicken, but I think that'll improve with practice.  Overall, it was pretty crispy but needed a TON of salt and the chicken was surprisingly dry, even when I thought I might've undercooked it.  I think I need to mess with this a bit.

Just wanted to thank the author of this recipe! My family loves fried chicken and my attempts at it usually failed. Tonight I made the most tasty and pretty chicken ever! My only suggestion is to add a bit more seasonings such as garlic powder or poultry seasoning to the flour. The technique is perfect!

Now I understand why you need the pasty consistency. That is how the crispy crust is created. This was the best fried chicken I have ever made.

Yep, crisp and juicy chicken every time. Made it twice now, both times turned out great. I marinate the chicken first for more flavor, but the actual frying technique works like a charm. Thanks!

I only like boneless chicken breast so I tried it with that and followed the recipe but with a little extra spices.  Fried for 30 minutes and it was much too long and it was very dry even though I soaked the chicken in salt water.  This was my fault, not the recipe.  The second time I cut the chicken into strips and followed what I did before, cooked for about 10 minutes and it was Crispy, juicy and FANTASTIC!!  I will NEVER use bread crumbs again, as this was how I was taught to bread chicken... good old fashioned egg and bread crumbs!  Thank you and I can't wait to cook this again!  So easy and little clean up!

I made this last night and it was very good. The only thing I can add is to not let it brown too much before you cover it, just to avoid it getting too dark while you're waiting for it to cook. I had 2 frying pans going (made too much) so it was a mess to clean up, but now I can enjoy the leftovers today.

This was really good chicken!  I have never been able to fry it properly without burning, so I played it safe, and finished them in the oven for 1/2 an hour.  I did add some extra seasoning, per reviews, and my family was pretty happy!  Will have cold chicken tonight and see how that tastes!  Thanks!

Good Lord, this is the best fried chicken recipie I've tried! Thanks for the tips in the recipe. They made all the difference. I brined the chicken before hand and it was just so juciy and tender. The only issue is that I didn't have any butter milk. But I mixed one cup of milk and 1 tablespoon vinegar and let it sit for 10 minutes. Its a good substitute. I like my chicken extra crispy, so I dipped the chicken in the "buttermilk" and the flour mixture once, and then dipped it back in the milk, and then back in the flour one more time. It was perfect! Thank you!

This recipe produced beautiful chicken!  I really don’t fry food, but I hadn’t had home-made fried chicken in years, so I thought I’d give it a try.  It was somewhat bland, but like other reviewers recommend, extra seasonings can be added.  I would definitely increase the paprika and salt, add garlic powder and possibly cayenne pepper.  I was trying to do too many things while the chicken was getting crispy and it ended up burning on one side.  Oops!  Since I overcooked it, it was a little dry, but my mistake can be easily remedied.  My only other complaint was the smell that was leftover.  Cooking the chicken didn’t exactly produce a bad smell, but the air ended up being thick with a grease-like odor that stayed until the next day.  Like another reviewer, I cooked on a gas stove and was very worried about the potential for grease fires.  Please be careful if you’re cooking on a gas stove and although this is probably common knowledge, please remember that water should NEVER be used on a grease fire!  Instead, smother it with a metal lid (the heat from the fire may cause a glass lid to break), with baking soda, or with a class B chemical fire extinguisher.  This is a good recipe, but I may not make it for quite some time since I don’t like to feed my family too many fried foods and also because of the danger in cooking with hot oil on a gas stove top.  Wonderful recipe though!

After reading the reviews I dipped the chicken the opposite way. Flour first mixed with a lot of garlic powder,paprika,salt and pepper, then I dipped it into the buttermilk and let it sit in the fridge for about an hour. The mix came out nice and thin and crispy. Chicken very nice and juicy. Great recipe but now I remembered why I have not made fried chicken in 13 years...the grease fires! Have a good DEEP skillet or frying pan on hand!!

Great.  I'd cook the chicken for 5 minutes per side to make it crispy on high heat.  Very good.

the chicken looked great, but the breading was too thick.  I like my fried chicken a little lighter.  will not make it this way again.  I think a little seasoned flour goes a long way.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was crispy but it lacked flavor. I will try it again, but will experiment with spices to get a good flavor.

I am 57 years old and love to cook but I never made good fried chicken until I made this recipe. Thank you so much Elaine O. I danced around the kitchen after I tried the chicken. Finally! I did add 11 herbs and spices to the flour (copy cat KFC spices) and my whole family was blown away. I can now die in peace knowing I can make good fried chicken. PS, I have never rated a recipe before yours Elaine, but I had to give you praise and thank you so much!

There was not much taste and I think part of it was because it would be better with the skin on, but I removed it. Maybe I'll make another attempt and add more paprika and some cayenne or something.

I have been looking for a really good fried chicken recipe for years.  Most of what I found has been good but not worth bothering with again.  This one is the exception.  It is very good.  I followed the ingredients but added about 1/3 t. of Poultry Seasoning. (I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 3/4 c. full milk, 1/4 scant cup of cream, and 1 T. white vinegar as a replacement--a recipe I looked up online.) I fried the chicken to get it lightly browned, and then I put it in the oven at 175 degrees until I got back from church (about 1.5 hours).  I then turned the oven up to about 325 degrees for about 20 minutes (fearing it might dry out--too many recipes produce dried out chicken).  The chicken was tender and tasted great!  This will be the recipe I use for many years to come.  It turned out wonderfully well, and we all loved it.  Thanks for sharing.  (Next time, I'll have real buttermilk, and I bet it will be even better.)  If you want a double thick, crunchy outside, dip your chicken in the flour first, then into the buttermilk, then back into the flour.  (You will need extra buttermilk for this and maybe 3 cups of flour instead of two (adding extra salt, pepper and cayenne so as not to change this delicious recipe.)  It turns out extra crispy.

My family has a chicken fry every Memorial Day and my Mom has always made delicious fried chicken.  Using this recipe took it to an all time high.  Hands down best homemade chicken she has made and everyone agreed.  She soaked the chicken overnight in buttermilk, breaded it as directed adding paprika and season salt.  The color is darker when it has cooked due to the paprika so don't be alarmed. Letting the chicken sit 10-15 minutes or is the key and that was something we have never seen.  It made the breading stay on better and the chicken was very juicy and more flavorful.  Absolutely fabulous.

I have failed at frying bone in chicken in the past, but this recipe, along with the reviews had me wanting to try again. I marinated in buttermilk for a few hours as suggested. I added 1/4c of McCormick's chicken seasoning, and basically poured the Paprika, and onion powder into the flour mixture, double coating as suggested. Being I have a gas stove, I only filled my cast iron pan 1/3 of the way for safety reasons. My "hot" was set @ 8, my low @ 3. I fried 5 legs as a test, before frying the rest. They were delicious with a nice crispy coating. Thank you Elaine!!

LOVE the texture on this chicken; its perfect!! I used a deep fryer at 375 until the chicken turned golden brown and then dropped it to around 355 for about 10 minutes, then amped it back up to 375 for the final 4 minutes. Turned out super crispy and moist and juicy on the inside. I also double battered it because I prefer thicker breading. 

I did find that the flavour was not as strong as I'd hoped. So that's the reason for 1 less star. But I didn't taste the batter before I threw in the chicken, so could be my fault. Great recipe, I will remember to add more spice next time.

Great recipe my chicken was sooooo moist and crispy. Just be sure to season the chicken and flour... I think because of the buttermilk you need a bit more seasoning, I love Tonys for chicken!

I agree with a previous reviewer - This recipe deserves 10 stars!

(My sister, boyfriend and I were watching The Help last night and we all got a craving for crunchy fried chicken like Minny and Celia were eating.)

I've never made fried chicken before, and this was the first recipe I came across. GENIUS! I cut up 4 boneless chicken breasts into strips and a few small chunks, followed the recipe completely and this chicken was PERFECT! There wasnt alot of flavor afterwards (Even though I was worried I might have over done it with seasoning) but I sprinkled salt and pepper on the crispy strips when done frying and they were absolutely delicious, something I can be proud to have cooked! Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!!!!!

I started frying chicken with panko's so that I could get a great crunch on it. I tried this the other day and was pleased that it came out so crunchy. Will make again.

Yum!! I finally made good fried chicken - thanks to this recipe! I used my electric fryer and filled that almost half way with veg oil and heated to 350. I used only drumsticks and I added seasoning salt and ground pepper to the drumsticks right before they hit the fryer. Totally juicy, crispy, and delicious!! Definitely adding to the recipe box!

Did a batch of drumstick-only chicken for the kids.  First time using this recipe.  Worked just as described.  I wasn't sure the final crisping phase was going to work, so I removed 3 drumsticks before turning up the heat.  The chicken remaining in the oil got nice and crispy and didn't burn as I had feared, so I put the first 3 back in for the final step too.  Definitely will make this again.

Very good results. I added garlic powder and a little cayenne, otherwise this might have been somewhat bland. I served gravy over top and it stayed crispy.

Chicken was crispy and moist but there was little flavor in the crust. Salt and pepper to taste is difficult because you can't taste until it's cooked then it's too late. Paprika isn't much for flavor either. I'll be looking for a recipe with more seasoning/herbs for next time.

Mine came out more crunchy than crispy. I did not like it too much. Even though I had added some jerk seasoning, which made it taste really good, the texture was a bit hard for me, and not worth the work and time it takes. My kids did love it though! Thanks for sharing :)

It seemed like the chicken that I cooked IMMEDIATELY was the only chicken that turned out crispy. The step that she said was crucial to let it sit until it had a glue consistency seemed to be ruin the recipe. Also, next time I will add more spice or zest. This seemed bland to me.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe!  I've made fried chicken before and it was tasty but never turned out fantastic.  This time it was great.  I had 5 very large bone-in, skin on chicken breasts.  I marinated them in buttermilk and hot sauce for six hours.  I mixed flour, salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder and garlic powder together to dredge the chicken.  I fried this in my cast iron dutch oven because I was afraid of this boiling over.  This method of covering the pot for 30 minutes gave me perfectly tender and juicy chicken.  The crust was very crispy too.  Thanks for my new go-to fried chicken recipe.

I agree, this is the ultimate of crispy, it was hard.   I keep looking for a great fried chicken recipe and I already had one.  All it really takes is to dip the chicken in egg or buttermilk then in seasoned flour and fry.  Simple and that is all there is to it.  I am no longer looking for a better recipe, I am happy with the one I already have.

I found this chicken to be time consuming and very greasy! It tasted good but not worth all the fat. I did have a few pieces left and decided to try baking them in the oven in a Pampered Chef stone pan. They turned out awesome. Very crispy but WAY less greasy.

My husband and I broke in our new deep fryer for this recipe.  The chicken doesn't have quite as much flavor as KFC, but it's delicious.  It might just need some time to marinate before frying.  We served it with cornbread and collard greens.  Yum!

This recipe is awesome! However i make quite a few changes. I soak chicken in salt water for 1hr before coating it in season flour. Soaking in salt water really make the chicken really juicy just like KFC. Add red chilie flake to it too as i like it more spicy.I'm impatient so after coating with flour i straight away damp water on the chicken to get the paste like consistency in few sec. To make it even more crispy i coat and damp with water several times.

Ugh.  This was a disaster.  We are big chicken fans.  We like it just about any way you fix it,  but this was awful.  The crust was like cement casing on the chicken with very little flavor and it came out way too greasy.  We won't try this again.

I boiled the chicken, then dipped in buttermilk then in flour mixture. This is a really great recipe! I used whole wheat flour in place of the all pourpose flour. The breading didn't stick very well, but still a wonderful recipe!

Great, classic recipe for Southern Fried Chicken.  I made a couple modifications that knocked it out of the park!  First, I used a milk/egg mixture instead of buttermilk to dredge chicken, and I found that it helped to keep breading from falling off.  Just make sure to whisk eggs in milk thouroughly.  Also, I added some onion slices into the hot oil, which just added another layer of flavor that was fantastic.  This is my new fried chicken recipe that I will use and enjoy for years to come!

Very good and crispy. I think next time I shall pay closer attention to the directions. Didn't put the chicken in really hot oil initially, like I should have and the recipe says to do. But, yeah, it was crispy and tasty! Oh, and next time I'll have to get a pair of tongs to turn the chicken with - more of the coating should stay on that way. Thank you ~~

I have been trying for years to make "CRISPY" fried chicken and was never able to until NOW!!  This technique is the best!!  And like she said it is all to your own taste when you spice up the flour but it is all in the technique and following directions to get it really nice and crispy. Thank you soooo much!

This was the best fried chicken that I have ever made.  It was cooked perfectly.  I added a splash of hot sauce to the buttermilk and let it marinade for a few hours.  When I was ready to start frying my chicken I added an egg to the buttermilk mixture.  We used boneless breast chicken (4 pieces)  I added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp seasoning salt, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp paprica, dash cayanne pepper, 1 tsp garlic pepper and a dash of salt.  I also dipped the chicken in the flour first, then the buttermilk mixture and then the flour again.  I drained my chicken on a wire rack so that it would stay crispy.  Try this recipe....you will not be disappointed!!!!

I have to admit this is the first time I have ever tried frying chicken.  My husband bought me a deep fryer so I thought I'd give it a shot.  It definately came out crispy and the coating stayed on which I was happy about.  I did add garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt, poultry seasoning and seasoned salt to it but I still found it a little on the bland side myself.  Mayve next time I'll try adding more garlic perhaps.

This was my first time making fried chicken.  I never had it growing up, either, so I really was clueless as to how to cook it.  I'm giving the recipe 5 stars because her technique is excellent, and I believe that was her intent in sharing this recipe.  I was pleasantly surprised that I was so successful in my first attempt, and I owe it all to Sleeygal.  The chicken was fairly crispy on the outside and unbelieveably moist on the inside.  I probably could have gotten it more crispy but I didn't know how long to cook it during that last stage of high heat, and I was afraid I would overcook it.  I cooked it in a cast iron skillet.  I did add more spices after reading that others thought it needed more flavor.  I doubled the paprika and added a teaspoon each of seasoning salt and cayenne pepper.  If I were to make this recipe again, I would increase the spices even more; however........I doubt I will make it again.  What a mess!  It was a miracle I didn't have a grease fire.  One word of advice--the recipe calls for filling the skillet 1/3 to 1/2 full of oil--don't do go with 1/2!  I filled mine half full and when I put the chicken in, the oil bubbled and overflowed.  I cook on gas so I was scared to death I was going to have a fire.  I think filling the skillet 1/3 full should be the maximum.  Throughout the entire process I felt like I was fighting oil popping and splattering everywhere, and what a huge mess I had to clean up afterward.  Maybe that's just part of making fried

I was too afraid to cover the chicken so I just fried them uncovered until golden brown. Because I was cooking legs which takes longer than white meat, I finished them off in the oven to ensure doneness. With the additions of garlic and onion powders, my gang was very happy with this special treat. Thanks so much Elaine!

I followed the recipe exactly, however the chicken had no flavor (I did use salt and pepper) and the coating was hard, not crispy, when finished.  Sorry, but I won't be using this recipe again.

Pretty darn good fried chicken!  I took the skin off my chicken and the coating was a little harder to adhere but all in all this was great chicken.  I hadn't made fried chicken in years because my husband prefers baked due to the grease but at his suggestion I did make fried.  And, yes, this chicken is just as crispy the next day even after being refrigerated.  I had even had some for breakfast this morning.  Except for the mess on the stove............try it..............you'll like it!

I have been craving good non kfc, popeyes ect. chicken for a long time. Decided to try this recipe and am so glad I did! Followed the recipe to the letter but did add garlic powder and seasoning salt. I cooked mine in an electric skillet because I wanted to be able to control the temperature of the oil. Only bad thing is family will be wanting me to make this over and over but no one sticks around to clean up the mess when its done!
Thanks for this recipe.

OK, so I have to admit, this is the first time I've ever made fried chicken myself, and this recipe is wonderful! Gotta agree with other reviewers: the technique that Elaine lays out is the key. The chicken came out beautifully golden brown and crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside - thank you, Elaine! :)

I'm glad I found this recipe. The  chicken came out deliciously crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. I did make a few changes however. I let my chicken strip sit in the buttermilk for about 20 minutes in the fridge before coating them. I also double coated the chicken before frying it in my deep fryer. The first batch came out a little dry in certain areas when I left it in for 20 minutes, which was too long. The rest came out so good that there is none left for me to eat. Definitely keeping this recipe. Thanks for sharing!...

This was great. Needs a little more flavor but the chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. I did drums for 17 minutes at 375 in my deep fryer.

Update: I made this again but added 2tbs of seasoned salt as well as S&P to the flour. This made it much more flavorful. I also make chicken nuggets with this recipe. I like those better than the chicken pieces.

I'm making this my go to recipe for frying.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and drained on a wire rack instead of a paper towel, worked out great.  Waiting for the flour plus buttermilk mix to turn into a "paste" only took about 10 min. I also didn't have buttermilk so I just added a Tbs. Of lemon juice to a cup and waited until it thickened up, about 5 min. I just wish I used regular salt or season salt to the mix. I used kosher and it wasn't as good as it could have been, but that's my fault and an easy fix for next time. Juicy and crispy! I used this chicken for Japanese curry and it was awesome. I also had a few peices with bbq sauce and it was also great. Very versatile.

I use gluten free flour and it works like a dream.  I also soak my chicken overnight in buttermilk, so it comes out marinated and juicy.

Added an egg to the buttermilk as someone else mentioned.  Chicken is incredibly light and crispy coming out of the deep fryer.

I made this recipe last night. My husband loved it and it remained crunchy, even after reheating it. I have tried so many recipes for fried chicken, and this method was the best. I did add some onion & garlic powder in it, as well as old bay and poultry seasoning. Thanks!

Like a lot of reviewers, I like the methodology, but the seasoning is lacking. I added 1-tbsp. of garlic powder, 1-tbsp. onion powder, 1-tsp. of salt, 2-tsp. of paprika, and 1-tsp. of pepper to 2-cups of flour and it wasn't close to being seasoned. I would probably change the recipe to get to 2-tsp. of salt (or sub celery salt for an old bay taste). Oh, and it kinda sucked if you had like diff. sized pieces of chicken bc they weren't cooked evenly - I would stick to one type of meat (ex. thighs, breasts, etc.) Will def. try again, though...

It worked! I had planed on buying fried chicken, money was short bought a raw chicken instead and tried this receipt. After cooking,  I was told this was better than the fried chicken I was going to buy. I also really spiced it up used seasoning salt . (Takes time, so don't wait until last minute to prepare.)

I actually did make this with chicken legs exclusively and it turned out FANTASTICALLY! My husband, who is the master fryer and incredibly particular about extremely flavorful food, raved about this! I also made creamed biscuits and green beans and it was an amazing comfort dinner haha
I added onion powder, garlic powder, white pepper, and a little red pepper to the mixture also.
This confused me when reading reviews so I want to tell what I did:
I did 1 cup whole milk to 1T vinegar (vinegar goes in FIRST!) 
And let it sit like 15 min. Then I marinated 5 legs in that for an hour. Dropped in seasoned flour bag, dipped in soured milk again, and shook again in flower bag. I fried it in a cast iron skillet with half canola oil, half non-hydrogenated shortening. It was really amazing. I was so surprise because as comfortable I am with cooking, fried chicken has so intimidated me until now!! (Also, j only fit 4 legs in my skillet at once so I fried to light golden, covered for 15, and fried to crisp)

Made the chicken according to the recipe. I used a cast iron Dutch oven with about 3/4" of oil in the bottom (because I didn't have a deep skillet) on top of a glass top stove. I didn't have a thermometer so I guesstimated 'HOT' oil to mean 8 on the dial of 1-10 on my stove. Burned my chicken even though I browned it and turned the stove down to 6. There was no way that was going to stay in for 30 min, it was in 20 min and burnt the skin to a black crisp. Turned the stove down to 6 and left it there to add the next batch which browned then cooked, but didn't cook anything but the drumsticks through. It did turn out very crispy skin and coating though. I wish there was more of a set temperature so someone like me that is unfamiliar with deep frying would know how to get crisp, not burned but cooked through chicken. Would try brining it and using a different mixture to coat it with next time, but would try it again.

I haven't cooked fried chicken in about 20 years, so I found this recipe, read many reviews and was very eager to try it.  I also wanted to use the method that Elaine described as I remember my Granny doing something like this when I was little.  I made very few modifications to the original recipe.  I soaked my chicken in buttermilk (in the fridge for about 6 hours) and added garlic and onion powder (about 1 1/2 tsp each) to the flour mixture.  Oh my goodness!  Let me tell you, the chicken was crispy and tender and oh so good.  Next time, I will have a lid for my cast iron skillet and I won't put as much oil in my skillet to begin with.  I think 1/3 is plenty.  I had forgotten how messy frying can be too.  As another reviewer stated, be prepared to have a few hours to make this from flour mixture to the dinner table.  You really shouldn't leave a large skillet of grease on the stove unattended.  But it was so worth the extra time and effort.  My family loved it and wants me to make it again.  And that y'all is what melts my butter.  :-)

I would not rate something 5 stars unless I REALLY love it, but from one who loves fried chicken, I have to say this is the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. The first time I made it, I had too much oil in my skillet, which resulted in a mess - start with your skillet no more than one third filled with oil - you can add more later if needed. Since that first time, no problems, just great chicken. I added a few shakes of cayenne pepper to the flour, but that's the only thing I did differently. If you love fried chicken, you MUST try this! Thank you Elaine!

Amazing!!! This is the first time I have made fried chicken and I am so happy I read through all the reviews and found this recipe! I am from Canada and growing up we don't really have fried chicken but this is now one of my favorite recipes! I cut up chicken breasts because I like the skinless boneless aspect and it turned out amazing. My boyfriend was hanging out in the kitchen in anticipation, which is very rare when a hockey game is on. I can't wait to have friends over and make this! Better than take out! Thank you for this!

My 84 year old father requested pan fried chicken for dinner and I went with this recipe. 
So glad I did. He loved it and said it reminded him of the fried chicken his aunt used to make that he loved so much. The only thing I will add next time is gravy made from the pan drippings. Thanks!

I've been trying different recipes for the last couple years, until I found this one.  The technique is by far the BEST for getting crispy fried chicken, that is moist and tender every time.  My four year old asks me all the time when I am going to make "that crispy chicken" again!  And after you cook it, the oil used is almost exactly the color it was when it went in the pan, with very little to NO residual bits... I would say, that depending on taste, you might want to increase or change the seasonings added to your flour.  Elaine DOES say that should be tweeked.  I add mounds of salt and pepper, garlic salt, onion powder etc etc.

5 for method. I can't rate the seasoning because I added more using Chef Johns Buttermilk Fried Chicken as a rough guideline. But this method is the absolute BEST you will find-hands down!!!

This recipe reminded me of how Hooter's makes their chicken and I love that style, so I gave it a shot. If you read the directions, you know to season to taste (unless "bland" is the taste you want).

We soaked the chicken in milk with a splash of lemon juice (homemade buttermilk) and some hot sauce. I used the paprika, some salt and some pepper, but added garlic and onion powder, some greek seasoning, some cayenne and some rosemary. (you can always taste the flour with the tip of your finger to check seasonings)

We let the chicken get to its desired wet look and then fried it up as directed. This was so incredibly juicy and honest to goodness, straight out of the refrigerator, cold... then microwaved... still crunchy!!! 

I'm going to make pork chops with this as my 'starter' recipe and see how the family loves crunchy pork! Yummy!!

So... I used my own seasonings, but wanted to try this method. I agree with a lot of the other reviewers... the crust would not stay on some of the pieces, and what did, was hard not crispy. I'm hoping the leftovers are better.

Good recipe. Wouldn't say it was the "best" ever. Tasted like most fried chicken should taste. I don't think it was the moistess chicken either. But I received compliments so I'm good. I would do this recipe again.

Sorry but this batter did not stick to the chicken. It fell off as it was frying and was a big disappointment! I'm going back to dipping the chicken in egg.

Very juicy, cooked through completely! Followed the recipe exactly only added some extra seasoning, not much, and my only complaint is that it was pretty much flavorless. So Im making it again tonite with much more seasonings, we'll see :) also it takes a bit to get that texture before frying.

Followed to a tea, and the coating would not stay and the crispy never came! Maybe you need to say how deep the oil needs to be!

Best I've ever made.  I don't fry chicken often but when I do, this is the ONE!  Crisco does a better job than veg oil, but it's so unhealthy.

I made this to serve the next day, and it was still great. I found the seasoning to be a bit light, so next time I'll make sure to heavily season the flour so the chicken has better flavor. Also, I didn't lower the temp and cook the chicken for 30 min, as stated, because I had a lot of chicken to fry and not a lot of time. I fried the chicken for 20 min. The next day when I warmed it up, it was still moist and cooked through. Thanks for posting, this is a keeper recipe.

So without a doubt my chicken came out moist on the inside and crispy on the outside - however, when i say crispy, i mean near burnt. I followed the recipe exactly but the outside of my chicken was nowhere near that beautiful golden brown but instead near black - although luckily not burnt. Other than my very crispy coating, it was delicious!!

Thank you :)

Like many others here, I've experimented with many fried chicken recipes and none can compare to this easy to do recipe.   Crazy crispy today and tomorrow...succulent & delicious...'nuff said.

I have never EVER been able to fry chicken until I tried this recipe... it was wonderful!  The only thing I will do differently next time will be to marinate the chicken in buttermilk (with some hot sauce mixed in) for awhile prior to frying.

This was  great! Chicken stayed crispy as promised! Make sure to let it sit for a while after coating with flour. That really made a difference.

In my first fried chicken experience, I was glad to have such a simple recipe. I did have a little trouble gauging just when the chicken was ready to remove from oil and accidentally overcooked my first batch. This is a staple recipe with specific directions that will come in handy the next time fried chicken is needed.

this is an excellent fried chicken recipe. Per other readers I ended up adding a lot more garlic salt and other seasonings, as it can be a bit on the bland side. As long as you season well with your favorite spices, this one is excellent!

I've tried several fried chicken recipes, and this is the first one where I feel like I completely nailed it. Even my daughter, who hates meat, ate it all and asked for more. The only change I made was to add a little bit of seasoned bread crumbs to the flour and some powdered garlic. Perfect!

Fixed as called for w/ legs.  Was not as crispy as I would have liked, but I did remove the skin first so that may have made a difference.

This is a wonderful recipe! It's full of flavor, and cooks nicely.

I didn't following the directions all the way. After doing the flour part, I put some garlic salt onto them, then warmed the oil. Cooked it till it was cooked through. I did cut my chicken into strips, so they cooked faster. I've never made fried chicken, and this turned out really good!! :)

Very crispy. I double dipped in buttermilk and flour mix, back to the buttermilk and flour mix.  Loved the crispiness but it needed more spices, I think.  I will be using this recipe again but add more spices.

The chicken was crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.  So is the chicken at my local take out.  For the $25-$30 it costs to order take out for a family of 4 and have it in 30-45 minutes, I'm not sure the effort was worth it.  And the take out tastes so much better, despite the fact of adding plenty of onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper.  70 cranks of the pepper mill to be exact.  Not sure what can be done to improve the taste.  The recipe/method itself was pretty accurate with the exception of the oil.  I used 1/3 of the way up my cast iron skillet, and the oil was foaming all over the place.  What a tremendous mess.  I think 1 inch max on the oil is sufficient.  It is pan fried, not deep fried.  Doubt I will make again, will direct my efforts to another dish.  Sorry.

I didn't follow the recipe except to leave the chicken cooking in the hot oil after the meat is done, for an extra 10 minutes or so.  IT WAS SO CRISPY!  I dredge it in seasoned flour TWICE, with a savory egg wash.  I am so happy I finally made extra crispy fried chicken! THANK YOU!

I have been frying chicken for a lot of years this was by far the best and one of the easiest fried chicken I have ever made. I used boneless/skin-less thighs so there was no need to cover for very long. Turned out great! Thanks for the wonderful recipe, it will now be one of my standards.

This was great!  Still uncertain about how to do seasoning. Did the 2 cups flour, 1 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tsp salt and a bit underseasoned, but not sure where to go from here.  Will experiment -- technique was perfect, though - and quick!  I only let it sit for 5 minutes before frying and crispiness was perfect!

Wow! Definite 5 stars. Thanks so much for the "Fried Chicken 101" class. Had I not read it, who knows how many more years I would have went without trying it myself. Great tips! I have been cooking for many years, but this is one thing I always left to the southern folk (I'm originally from NY). I was always afraid the coating would fall off, or it would burn while the inside was still raw...so I never attempted to make it. Well, I'm happy to say, I did exactly what you said, followed the recipe exact (except adding a few of our fav spices), cooked it at around 350 degrees, and came out with the most beautiful fried chicken! (I've added a photo). The "waiting" time was excruciating, lol...but well worth it. My fiance' LOVED it, and I almost didnt want him to eat it because it was so pretty, lol. Fried chicken is his favorite. He's southern, so you can see why I always get scared to try new things when it comes to southern cooking. Anyway, I showed the pic to a few friends and they all said it looked delicious! Thanks so much for this recipe, and the tips! You made it MUCH easier for me to try this :o)

I have been making fried chicken for years for my family - and they LOVE mine.  But today I tried this one - and this was, bar none, the BEST technique and recipe I've ever had.  My family LOVED it.  You can adjust it to make it "spicier"if you prefer, or make it simple, as is - either way, it is absolutely great.  Be sure to cook on low, with a lid, to ensure it is at it's peak of slow cooked goodness - and then crisp it up.  Really great

Really good fried chicken.  My family loved it.  It was nice and crispy, good hot or cold.  I hate to say it but it was almost too crispy.  Everyone kept walking by and pinching off little pieces of crunchy,  I knew they were guilty because I could hear them crunching across the room.  Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this last night, adding spices to the flour mix. It worked really well and was not nearly as messy as I was afraid it would be! I also used boneless breasts, which seem to have a much shorter cooking time--they only needed to be covered for 15 minutes, flipping once halfway through.

When I made this I used chicken breasts cut into chunks. The cooking time seemed a bit long so I fried the chunks for 10 minutes instead of 30. They were a bit over cooked and tough. The coating, however, was amazing! I'm sure that this would be a 5 star++ recipe if I fried the chicken for less time (or used big pieces of chicken).

While it was crispy, I think I did something wrong. It kind of hurt my jaw to eat this, plus it was pretty tasteless. Also I could really taste was the sour buttermilk taste, maybe next time I will use a brine mixture with extra salt.

OH MY GOODNESS!  Thank you so much for this technique/recipe - - made the BEST fried chicken strips I've ever had or made!   I let the coated chicken sit for about 30 min, browned, then only cooked it covered for about 20 min, and crisped it up again!  Wonderful! Thank you!

This was my first attempt at fried chicken and it turned out amazing. I used boneless chicken breasts and cut them into fours. This cut the cooking time in half and i kept it on high heat the entire time. This is an awesome recipe.

This definitely produced crispy fried chicken and none of the batter fell off! Because we used skinless & boneless breast fillets, we cut the breasts into large chunks and then fried them in the oil, uncovered, for 10-15 minutes. Result was perfect, crispy fried chicken that was moist on the inside and not at all greasy on the outside.

This is always a nice way to do chicken - the only thing I did differently was to beat an egg into the buttermilk to make sure the coating stuck together!

OMG!!!! This recipe turned out perfect. I was shocked that the chicken was cooked all the way through, moist, and crunchy. And it is as crispy the next and delicious cold! I added garlic and Adobo seasoning to the flour.

on a personal basis i would only give this a 1 star. i didnt like it. I guess it just wasnt like what we used to get back home. But my husband loved it and asked me to try and make it again with a little bit of spicy kick next time. any food he will eat is a pleasure for me though.. so 4 stars it is!

Wow!!!! This was soooo good. My first attempt at fried chicken and it was a hit. I let my drumsticks sit in buttermilk and garlic for about 3 hours in the fridge, then i followed the recipe, except i added cheyanne pepper for a kick. This chicken browned up so perfectly, had excellent flavor and the outside was super crispy and delicious. Will have to make again soon!

We made this for Memorial Day and what a treat!! This recipe is faboulous!! I did a few things different, I used Self Rising flour and I used 2 packs of Good Seasons Italian Salad dressing mix, and after soaking the chicken in buttermilk, and tossing in flour mixture, we fried it in our turkey fryer for 15-18 minutes and it was perfect. Will definitely make this again....Good Bye Colonel!!!!

Was very cripsy.  I think the key is to cook it "slow", but I couldn't help myself from addin my own flair . . .  mixed equal parts corn meal, flour, and bread crumbs, rather than dredging in flour alone.  Also added spices to the flour (such as paprika, black pepper, garlc powder, and onion powder, etc.).  I give this five stars because it is a wonderful, no fail base that is easily expanded upon to fit your moood.

Very crunchy and juicy. Would not recommend leaving chicken in buttermilk too long. Also, season chicken with desired seasonings first, put on plate, cover with plastic wrap, put in fridge about an hour, than dip chicken in buttermilk. Next coat in seasoned flour and then fry. Yum-O. LOL

My family agrees - this is THE best homemade fried chicken. I added about 1/2 cup parmesian/romano cheese to the flour mixture. Excellent recipe.

I have finally made a fried chicken that my husband would eat! I basically did everything described. I used smoked paprika and garlic pepper with he salt. I didn’t let the chicken sit long enough to get gooey. I will be sure I do that next time. I used the kernel of popcorn method to get my oil hot enough to brown the chicken. I then reduced the heat to medium low and covered my cast iron. I set a timer for 30 minutes and waited it kind of close. After 30 minutes, I removed the lid, increased the heat to just above medium (electric stove) and it took 10-15 minutes for the chicken to crisp. I turned halfway through the cooking time for browning and crisping. Our chicken looked like grandma’s fried chicken and had good flavor. We like plain spices, so I didn’t add hot pepper flakes or anything like that. I filled my cast iron skillet (with high sides) about 1/3 full. I hope my review is helpful to inexperienced cooks.

My mommy made THE BEST chicken (like  ALL mommys do!) And I've been frying chicken forever, sometimes in buttermilk or Ranch, even 1000 Island on zingy flavor nights.. but i just KNEW there was something i was missing.  Let the Chicken coating become a paste!!!  Thank you! When i read that i remembered how mommy would put the chicken in the fridge, i had just forgot why.. xoxo to you for the "secret" that i forgot!

I followed the recipe and the flavor was good and chicken was nice and crispy. HOWEVER, the recipe called for HOT oil and to COVER. Do not cover!!!! I currently have second degree burns on my face and neck by following that part of the recipe. I'm not a "seasoned" chef so I didn't assume to use a splatter screen and did not have much experience with hot oil. But at the end of the day, even with the burns; I will make this chicken again because it was simple ingredients and still had good taste. 

Sincerely,

Lesson learned

I brined 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts over night in a mixture of kosher salt and water. I cut the chicken into 12 pieces, and followed the recipe method to the letter. I did add some onion powder and garlic powder to the flour, but NO salt because of the brining. I'd bought a new thermometer just for this recipe today, and it was broken, so I guessed at the proper temperature! The chicken was so moist and flavorful, and crispy! I'll do this again! Update: It was just as good the next day!

Great for chicken tenders! I made this last night with boneless skinless chicken tenders.  They were crispy and moist and delicious; an instant favorite. I marinated the tenders overnight in the buttermilk, and then put them in a colander to drain while I mixed up the flour (to taste; some salt, cayenne and poultry seasoning in addition to the paprika).  After shaking them in flour I let them sit until flour became pasty. Then I fried them in my cast iron dutch oven at 375 degrees. I'd sliced the tenders to get that awful tendon out of them, so they were more like chicken fingers.  They cooked quickly as they were almost submerged in oil.  2-3 minutes per side.  I was worried I'd overcooked them because they came out very stiff but that was just the crunchy delicious outside holding them stiff.  Inside was moist and juicy.  We can't wait to make them again and experiment with different seasoning.  I'm thinking buffalo popcorn chicken next,  on a salad.

I loved it, the best fried chicken recipe I've tried in a long time. The only change I'd make is to not let it sit until it gets pasty. We've used this same recipe on country fried steak & chicken tenders & it turned out rather amazing.

This is my go-to chicken recipe for the ingredients its uses, but the frying method seems off. Instead of browning the crust, reducing the heat for 30 minutes, then turning it back up, I bring my oil temp to 350, add a couple pieces to the pan, then fry them at 300 degrees until done. This makes sure the center is done without having burnt or greasy crust.

This is the recipe I've followed for awhile now and it produces perfect fried chicken every time - we never have any blood in the center (which was always my problem with other recipes.) Over time, I've changed 3 minor things to our liking. 1. Instead of paprika, I use garlic powder. 2. I mix an egg into the buttermilk (it helps it stick more.) 3. After its fully cooked, I lay it out on a baking rack over napkin covered plate. It seems to get even crispier this way. Great, great recipe!

This was awesome! My husband, who is picky with what chicken he likes absolutely loved this. I cut boneless, skinless chicken breasts into thirds so that it was slightly healthier. I also added basil, oregano, Parmesan cheese, and coriander to the dry mix. It came out awesome and took only 4 minutes per side to make! Thanks again

Why would you have to turn the chicken pieces when it is completely submerged in the oil?  Utter nonsense.

The method is not efficient for making crispy chicken. Just fry it in hot lard or oil until well browned, tray and let rest, uncovered for 20 minutes in a 225 degree oven

This recipe was really good! I've had a lot of fried chicken fails, so I was excited to find this one. The only change that I made was that after I fried the chicken until it was brown, I finished it in the oven, and only because all of the chicken wouldn't fit into one pan and I wanted it to be done all at the same time. It worked great! Thank you for posting this recipe!

Never made fried chicken until this recipe. It's super easy and the key is letting the chicken rest after it is battered and getting the oil to temp of 375 as one of the other reviewers noted. I added extra paprika and my friends loved it do much they had four helpings!

Sounds great, but one quick question.  When you say heat both sides until browned, then reduce and cover........doesn't it get browner?   Sorry but I am a total rookie here.  Any help appreciated.

Loved it, first time I ever made decent fried chicken.  I cut up large chicken breasts into good sized individual portions.  I added 1Tbsp white vinegar to milk to make the buttermilk.  Thanks!!
I used peanut oil to fry the chicken, that also may have added to my success.

This was a great recipe, however, when i placed the chicken in hot oil it instantly got crispy and when i cut it down and covered, it became soggy.  And when i tried to remove cover and raise heat and fry until it was crispy, that didn't work well.  Going to try it again and see how it works with skinless.  Maybe i need to work on the technique a few more times to perfect it!  Even though mine wasn't as crispy as i like, it was still delicious! Well worth a few more tries!

This recipe is more on technique than anything and it was spot on!!  The crust is a little bland so next time, and yes there will be a next time, I will put more spices in the flour mixture.  The Chicken was brown on outside and moist and done on inside.  I did what others suggested I put the chicken when finish in oven at 275 on rack with baking sheet underneath it.  Smoke up house a little but no big deal.  This is a keeper. :-)

I brined the chicken in salt water over night then let it soak in buttermilk the morning before I fried it. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because I burned the tar out of the chicken (used a propane burner outside) and it was still juicy inside with good flavor. I'll be making this again soon and next time I won't burn it!

Wow!!  I've used this recipe for the 3rd time and all I can say is it just keeps getting better and better!!  I did brine my chicken for about an hour and then washed it before placing in plastic containers.  I covered the chicken with buttermilk and about 5 dashes of hot sauce and then sealed tightly, shaking the containers to cover.  I placed in the fridge and let it sit for about 2.5 hrs.  I placed my flour in a paper grocery sack and really added the paprika and other seasonings (kinda heavy because the first two times I wanted more taste!).  Shook very well for coating and placed on covered cookie sheets.  After all the chicken was ready to for the pasty stage I sprinkled my remaining buttermilk/hot sauce mixture over it.  I then followed the recipe as stated.  The outcome was amazing!!  Perfection.......juicy inside and crispy outside!!

NEEDS lots more seasoning!!! Was really good second time with more seasoning. I saw one person say that they cut slits in chicken in the thickest part..good idea. I wish the top rated comment had mentioned seasoning because I only read the first few reviews the first time making it. I am going to try it with chicken strips next!

Yummy chicken! Thank you so much. Used cut up chicken quarters, and cut slits into the meaty parts.  Loved the batter, it covered the cuts.  Used a deep fryer and double checked 375 temp. with candy thermometer. The paprika makes this chicken brown fast. This recipe would work better with less meaty or boneless pieces because the fast browning time.

I wanted to try this recipe for some time now and today was the day i made home made fried chicken for the first time!
I didn't follow the method of shaking the chicken pieces in a plastic bag (although simple i was sceptical about the even coating), so i dipped each piece separately in buttermilk (added hot sauce) and flour (added chilli powder) and left the pieces to sit for 2 hours.
Some of the coating got stuck to my pan and as a result, the bottom of the pan got burnt and the chicken pieces didn't brown evenly but overall, i think it was a pretty good first attempt. Even with all the salt i added to the flour, it needed more when my hubby and I started eating.
I will definitely use this recipe again whenever i make fried chicken, as it's so easy and will hopefully sort out the issue of the coating coming off.

Really good fried chicken! My husband absolutely loved it and it really wasn't that hard to do! I did change something which is that i put a dry rub of spices on the chicken for about an hour before breading and frying. It was juicy, crunchy goodness!

XLNT fried chicken, and not at all greasy! I did take off the skin, and also used a cast iron skillet. The second batch didn't take as long to cook. The directions are clear and well written -- thank you! Next time I'll salt brine the chicken and use about a tablespoon paprika and a touch more salt in the flour.

Thank you SO much for this recipe, I used whole (huge) bone in split chicken breast, and they came out so moist on the inside, crispy on the outside!  I got so many compliments on this, and my guest asked to take home the leftovers!!! PERFECT!!!!

Great recipe! I think that the lid should be kept off during frying though...I made a batch with the lid on, and then one with lid off and the second one was crispier. I also marinated my chicken in a tabasco-salt water marinade for a couple of hours before preparing. I like to season my flour as well.

Hi! This is the first recipe rating I have ever given, as i felt compelled to write and say that this is the BEST fried chicken recipe I have ever tried!!  I consider myself to be an accomplished cook but could NEVER master fried chicken - until I tried this recipe!  This chicken was very crispy outside, but moist and tender on the inside.  My husband said that "this was some kick-a** chicken! :-) I used pepper, seasoned salt, paprika and garlic salt to taste.  I then seasoned the flour with poultry seasoning, then followed your recipe.  Your 'trial and error' paid off.  Congrats on an OUTSTANDING recipe!!!

This is delicious!  The flavor of the chicken is enhanced by the simple flour/paprika mixture.  I had trouble keeping the 'breading' on the chicken but what was on it still was so nice and crispy!  I'll be making this again and again!

At 59 yrs. old, I had only tried to fry chicken 3 times & because I love a lot of crispy crust, I failed all times w/crust in one bowl & chicken in another. :) When I saw this picture, I just had to try it & WOW am I glad I did! It's incredible & to get it tasty just do as other's suggested--add the spices you prefer! I can't thank you enough for this recipe! I LOVE it!

Great recipe. I seasoned the chicken over night and it was filled with flavor. Only thing is 30 minutes is too long to fry the chicken.

Really great and it works! I put lemon in whole milk for my buttermilk and made a gluten-free flour mix using cornmeal, all purpose GF flour and instant mashed potatoes.  And I also made a sort of chicken fried chicken using boneless skinless breasts. I was afraid that with the GF flour it would get too soggy but it didn't.   I actually waited around for it to get "paste-like" but it never did, just parts of it did.  Well that was good enough for me so I fried those puppies and they came out good and super crunchy still! With some garlicky mashed taters and collard greens I had a down home southern meal.  This is my new go-to whenever I want southern fried chicken.

I've made fried chicken many, many times, but this recipe was by far the BEST crispy chicken ever! I have never used buttermilk, I think that was probably key, and then letting the battered chicken "rest" before cooking was genius. My husband and I raved about the taste! Thanks for the great idea I will make again!

I can't cook very good, but I felt so great after making this recipe.  It gave me confidence to try new things. I have tried to cook chicken more times than I can shake a stick at, and it always turns out poorly.  This recipe turned out great!  I followed it exactly as she described!  Love, love, love it!

I followed the recipe exactly and yes, it was the most moist and crispy fried chicken I've ever had, but it was also the most bland.  I should have paidattention to the other reviewers and added some more spices.  I'll make this again, but will def kick the spices up a few notches the next time!

I used this recipe mainly for the method to fry some chicken wings.  It was perfect!  I lightly brined them for about 45 minutes, rinsed and patted them dry.  Mixed the buttermilk with some hot sauce and allowed the wings to soak for 1/2 hour.  And proceeded with the recipe using a few extra seasonings.  Wings take about 11-12 minutes..frying 2.5 minutes per side at 360º then turned the heat down and covered the them and steam-fried them for another 5 minutes.  Removed the lid and turned them and cooked 1 or 2 minutes more.  Removed to a rack, the residual heat probably continued cooking them for an additional 3-5 minutes.  They were moist and tender inside and crispy outside.  I still had almost all of the oil remaining in the pan.  I'm really impressed!  Thanks, Sleepygal, great method.  I will fry chicken this way from now on.

Love the cooking technique, I'll use it on other type of fried foods. My boys usually don't eat fried chicken or fried anything for that matter, however, they gobbled it up quickly and I didn't have encourage them to eat. Hubby and I that the flavor was bland. I added extra paprika and garlic powder. Next time I will add way more extra. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was excellant. I never fry food but was willing to because of the ingredients and reviews.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  I did add more seasoning like many readers suggested.  It didn't taste greasy either.

If you use the techniques as written you will have perfect fried chicken!  Nothing I can add that could make it better.  I also tried this with fried wild turkey (it is turkey hunting season here!) - I really did not change a thing - except cut the turkey breast into strips - then followed this recipe and the techniques. Pan drippings made a wonderful gravy.  I agree with the one reviewer - I have fried chicken many ways - some pretty close to the way this recipe says - but had not used the specific techniques as called for here.  It really makes the most wonderful difference.

The technique in this recipe was great. The chicken was very moist,tender and crispy. I did add extra seasonings. Will be making this one again for sure.

I love this recipe.  I made it for a large number so it was a little more time than I liked but for just the two of us it would be great.  The chicken comes out crispy and tastes great.  I used chicken breasts and cut them into smaller pieces, but will leave them as full breasts the next time.  I didn't cook for 30 minutes since they were smaller pieces.  I will use this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe.  This was my first time attempting fried chicken, and I didn't let the oil get hot enough (I was in a hurry).  BUT... the chicken STILL came out with a crispy finish and an excellent taste.  I can only imagine how good it would have been if I had let the oil get hotter.  Thanks!

Wow!!  I made fried chicken!!  I have been cooking for years, but fried chicken always seemed like a daunting task.  This recipe made it easy and the result was delicious.   Everyone loved it and we are looking forward to the bag of leftover chicken in the fridge.  I will save this recipe and pass it on to my kids when it is time!

I too wanted the perfect crispy fried chicken and have finally found it.  My husband is so not a chicken fan but, requested for me to make this again and again.  That was doing exactly like the recipe stated.  Love this and a definite keeper.

My family LOVED this chicken. I soaked the chicken in buttermilk for about 1 hour. I used chicken grill seasoning, and seasoning salt in the flour. The only problem was that the flour took a about 45-60 minutes to turn paste on the chicken which made supper a little late but well worth the wait. I made “Scalloped Taters” to go with it which I would also recommend. Pretty easy to make as well, it just takes a little time.

It lived up to its name - it was crispy.  Next time I will use more seasoning in the flour.  The taste of the chicken was bland.

Oh My Goodness this is the best really every time I find a recipe for "crispy" fried chicken I make it and until I found yours I have never been able to get the skin like I want it which is crispy enough to actually eat. The only thing I didn't have was the paprika and I had to make butter milk with vinegar and whole milk but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and I will always make it this way My daughter always wants fried chicken when she comes home from school for a visit and I cannot wait to surprise her with this new find. Thank You again crispy fried chicken that is just that.

Wow this is the best chicken I've ever made!! The ingredients and preparation were simple. I used butter instead of buttermilk, however, and I cooked the chicken a bit faster than the recommended 30 minutes but it turned out great! My husband commented, "This chicken is better than KFC"!

This chicken was very good.  I seasoned it to my liking, but I followed the preparation directions.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because of the cooking instructions.  The first batch of wings that I did, I burned.  I know how to cook so I should have known better, but for those who are not that great in the kitchen or just learning how to cook a note stating cooking times may vary should be inserted in the instructions.  That way a new cook won't leave the chicken cooking for "30 minutes" and come back to burned chicken or worse a burned kitchen.  Just my opinion.  Otherwise this was a very good recipe.  Thanks.

I have made this numberous times....and given it to neighbors....one trick is to pound the chicken breast flat (about 1/2 inch) and then double bread them....pan fry them up and call it good....good old southern cooking!

The chicken was crispy but lacked seasoning; maybe if the recipe had garlic powder and onion powder it would of been better..I was disappointed.

I read all of the reviews for knowledge, but honestly a lot of you are over thinking this. I put whatever seasonings.  But the gist is the buttermilk, & flour resting. Used my electric presto with thermostat. Did wonderfully. I mean, use common sense to adjust seasoning & spices. Threw a turkey leg in the middle. Fab. Electric: Started at 375 until a bead of water danced. Turn, Turn after a light brown, I watched at this point!  Then I changed dial to 300* & put lid on for 10 min/flipped-reset timer/flipped to = 30 min. Cranked to 375 & quickly flipped. Than tree in last two drumsticks on 350* & watched

The method seemed fine, and I put on my own spices into the flour mix to get the flavor that I wanted. My biggest problem with this recipe is that there's no specificity or even ballpark figures. She says that the oil needs to get hot, but how hot? Should be bubbling? Should it be smoking? And then when she says to put the chicken in the flour and then let it rest until the flower gets to a paste-like consistency, how long should that take? Approximately how long should that take? I know that it probably can change depending upon how much flour you put on it, if you double battered it, or other factors, but for someone who's trying this recipe for the very first time, are we talking about something that should take 5 minutes, or 2 hours? I have no idea, and I felt that the recipe was riddled with non specific things that assume you're already a fried chicken expert before you try this recipe.

Ive been cooking for 45 yrs and this is the best fried chicken recipe ever! I did add garlic powder and didnr have buttermilk so i soured some milk with vinegar...the secret is to let the coating sit until pasty...yummm!

Ok so this technique worked perfectly (with some changes mostly because I was using boneless skinless chicken breast). I had been using another recipe that was far more complicated (involving triple dipping) but the problem with it was that the coating, while delicious, wasn't sticking to the chicken! Kind of a problem. My chicken breast recipe calls for the chicken to be marinated overnight in the buttermilk, and spices, so this was PERFECT. I pulled it out of the bag that it was marinating in, dipped it in the flour/seasoning bag (I only seasoned a bit because there's quite a bit of seasoning in my marinade) and WAITED for the paste like consistency. It took about an hour and 25 minutes  just fyi. We then cooked it at 350 (the whole time because it wasn't whole pieces) for about 6 to 7 minutes I want to say (until it was crispy and brown) and it was PERFECT. And the coating STUCK!!!! And it was easier. So thank you!!

Fixed chicken legs in my first cast iron skillet.  I didn't have paprika so I used tumeric, and make my own buttermilk with vinegar added to whole milk.  Turned out great--but the direction to "turn down heat, cover and cook 30 minutes"
wasn't clear enough for me to know how much to turn down.

This is the first one I’ve tried, so maybe I’m underrating it at 4 stars, but I’d say it’s a good sign that I’m comparing it to fast food chicken. The crispyness of the fried chicken needs some flavoring but overall the chicken was very good. I’m going to tinker with the seasoning to make the skin more flavorful

My family loved this! The breading didn't fall off like every other time I've tried frying anything. I did flip the chicken and check the internal temp of the chicken during the 30 mins. I didn't need to cook it for the full 30 mins. The chicken ended up crispy on the outside and juicy. Will make again!

One of my boyz favorite meal. They requested it on a weekly basis.  I  marinate it overnight in hot sauce and other seasonings.  You have to double coat like the instructions say to come out perfectly.

Chicken is perfect!! Oil temp should be 375. It will cool down once the chicken is in, then keep around 325 while frying. I love fried chicken with hot spices, but my grandkids don’t appreciate spicy foods, so I think the minimal seasonings in this are perfect. I added turmeric.  Will be making again.

I made this using chicken breasts cut into strips. I added a touch of garlic powder, otherwise exactly as written. Cooked it maybe 15 mins.  It got rave reviews from all my kids. And my husband, who is stingy with compliments even said how delicious it was. I’ll definitely make this again!

This recipe was great.  I followed it closely including letting the battered chicken set for over an hour.  Was generous with salt, pepper, and paprika, putting it on chicken before the buttermilk wash as well as in the flour mixture.  The family loved it!  We will make this again.

First time making fried chicken here.. roughly used Food Network's recipe, but followed this technique, since reviews said the recipe was bland. And i believe it, bc the recipe i used was a tad step up but i wasn't excited about the flavor, and it's a bit too salty.  I had 5 chicken legs (not quite 2#) brined overnight, rinsed and let it drain and warm with ambient temperature. I substitute buttermilk, 1/8C almond milk to 3/8C to make 1/2C "buttermilk" substitute; for the mix i used: 1.5C flour, 1T salt (plan to cut to 2tsp next time!), 1T black pepper, 1/2T garlic, 1/4T onion, 1/2tsp paprika, 1/2tsp red(cayenne) pepper; I used my  carbon steel wok and had it filled with just enough oil to submerge half the chicken.  Fried the first side for 15min before flipping to other side for 10min to try to mitigate overfrying.  I ended up overfrying and inside was maybe just a smidge undercooked? just nuked in microwave for 1min to be on safer side.  I did not do the cook through with lid cover...so will do that next time (I was afraid of losing crispiness after already overfried the outside)!  Still had at least half of the flour-mixture remain  - so it's a good amount.

So disappointed I love fried chicken but stay away from the frying, so gave it a try anyway, the technique was good but no taste at all, OK no raw chicken but no flavor to this, and took so long to make. made only two whole legs and of course way tooooo much flour, but will have to play with the spices. thank you anyway. I love Allrecipes

Absolutely fabulous fried chicken! Did add a few additional spices, 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder and Emeril’s and used House Autry Chicken Breader in place of the flower. Fry as directed, then place on absorbent paper. Drained the oil through a strainer and retained the extra crispy‘s back into the pan adding 1/4 cup of the breading mix with 3 tbsp of the oil on high heat stir until smooth then add 2 cups milk adding salt and pepper to taste, stirring constantly heat until a rich creamy consistency, serve over mashed potatoes!

Definitely love this technique!  Didn’t have any buttermilk so I just used eggs instead, but next time I will get buttermilk. I love the technique of letting the chicken sit once floured, you can definitely see and taste a difference! Husband and son loved it! Great recipe!!

Made this for dinner a few nights ago.  Followed the recipe except for the addition of some hot sauce  mixed in with the buttermilk.  Chicken came out moist and juicy on the inside and crisp and crunchy on the outside. Hubs  especially liked it.  Will definitely  be making this again.

I'm rating 5 stars because I KNOW this is a great recipe. But it didn't turn out as good as I hoped (there was still none left, mind you). I'm going to do it again now that I know the following:

1. After reading MANY reviews I finally found one reviewer (AFTER I cooked it) who revealed the flour can take 30 minutes to reach that "pasty" consistency, which is critical to this working.  The recipe doesn't give you an idea how long it takes, so if you've never done it you really don't know how long you should expect it to take. That may explain people jumping the gun on this step (like I did).

2. I think real Buttermilk (not a substitute like I used) is a critical component to getting that paste. I could be wrong here but I'll use the real stuff next time.

3. Mine was a little bland, like many others. But I think that's because if you're someone who likes to taste a lot of seasoning it takes a lot more than the recipe calls for  to cut through 2 cups of flour.  I could taste it a little but I'll add quite a bit more next time.

4. I used one of these counter-top electric fryer-type things, so I was able to dial in the temp to 375. But my chicken got more brown than I wanted it to, and it got there pretty quickly.  Even without fully reaching the pasty phase though, I could tell the skin was definitely different.

Next time I'll either cook it at a lower temp or omit the Paprika,  since it's a browning agent.

Other things were a little unclear because the instructions differe

I never knew how to make fried chicken so I never made it. I made this recipe and I am a believer. This recipe is remarkable. 
Thank you, Elaine O for sharing  !!
This is my new Sunday nite dinner.

I made this yesterday and I couldn't agree more with the comments. This recipe works because of the technique**.
The choice of seasoning and quantities is up to you! But do make sure that after you dip (or marinate) in buttermilk you toss the chicken in a bag with the flour mixture (in batches) and let it sit**** for at least 30 minutes!!!. Also I did follow instructions and covered the chicken while it was sitting in the flour mixture, I think this helps keep the coating wet. I used my cold oven to house the cookie sheets with the covered chicken. 20 min after I started heating up the oil in a cast iron dutch oven and by the time 30-35min passed the oil was hot and ready. The chicken is going to have a sticky paste coating when ready. One more thing, make sure your oil is hot and stays hot. Between 350*F to 375*F. I made chicken wings and boneless strips so I didn't have to cover and let cook for 30 min. 10-12 min is all my chicken needed. I gave the recipe 4 stars because it's pretty vague so you need to have some cooking experience to get a successful batch but the technique is the key**

Delicious! I'm an amateur cook so I found this recipe so simple yet heavenly. The crispiness was perfect and the texture was amazing. The only problem was that it wasn't very flavorful but I fixed that problem by frying the chicken in coconut oil (instead of vegetable oil) with a pinch of chili oil.  Apart from that, my family and I loved it! Will definitely cook again!

Elaine O Ty so much for this recipe. Fried chicken was something I made one time and it was ok for a first timer. BUT this made me a pro! I heavily seasoned the flour with Lawry's seasoned salt. Followed your instructions and it was better than Popeye's. It did take hours tho. That's the ONLY bad thing. This was some bangin chicken.

This recipe turned out pretty good. It would have helped if the amount of salt and pepper were listed rather than. Season to taste made me a little skittish about adding to much salt. I will use this in the future with a few additions such as some brown sugar and more salt.

I made this exactly as written.  The chicken stayed juicy and tasted delicious.  The coating browned up nicely and was crispy.  However, it lacked flavor.  I'm probably used to restaurant fried chicken, and maybe theirs is nothing like the real deal - I don't know.  But this tasted like a crunchy coating of flour on my chicken.  There was zero flavor.  For the time and effort involved, it wasn't worth mine.

Delicious!  I deviated a little from the original recipe but not the advice to let the flowered chicken sit covered until it becomes a little pasty.  This takes about a half hour.  The  recipe said to lower the heat, and cook for 30 minutes, then increase the heat again.  I kept cooking  the chicken at relatively high heat, just lowered slightly, and turned frequently. It turned out great.

I made this without brining the chicken on the first attempt and it was even better the next day cold.  I am trying it this time  and brining the chicken in  kosher salt water with brown sugar , soy sauce, and olive oil.   The chicken is much more moist and it didn't take nearly as long for it to turn the coating into a paste.

Put in about 1 tsp of Adobo seasoning instead of salt and pepper. Very fussy about oil, so used peanut oil to fry. Very nice. Perfectly cooked, crispy, moist.  I have no deep fryer, nor an appropriate thermometer. Put my gas "power burner" on at high for the browning, low for the slow cooking.

This was the perfect recipe for a novice like me, very easy to follow. I used seasoned salt instead of just adding the paprika on its own and loved the taste. Was too impatient to let the battered chicken sit and get that paste-like consistency as was suggested before frying lol, but I'll do it right next time and it still tasted great when I made it the first time regardless!

Made exactly as directed. Easy, moist, & crunchy crispy delicious. 1 change when I make this next time will be to season the flour and/or chicken as it was a little bland.

When my Mother made fried chicken I remember she coated the chicken with the flour mixture and put it in a skillet of hot oil to fry it. In this recipe they want you to brown it in the hot oil then cook for an additional 30 which I found odd. When the oil got to be the right high temp I ended up cooking each side for five to six minutes and it came out great. In fact the skin was super crispy and crunchy. No additional 30 min needed on a low temp. Just saying.

This turned out great.  Perfect crunch, but next time I'll add more salt to the flour mix.  I used my cast iron skillet, a thermometer to monitor oil heat and checked the chicken temp, removing at 160 degrees.  I had a small issue keeping the oil temp at 375, but once I got it to stay there, the chicken fried perfectly.  I fried in batches and kept the other chicken warm in a 250 degree oven.  New and experienced cooks can learn from the video.  I don't fry foods too often, so it was a real help.

I have made this a couple of times and follow the recipie as it is written. I only add Rice Krispies to make it crunchier and it is so yummy. It is really important to let it sit and get pasty and the oil must be really hot. It is the greatest recipie for fried chicken.

This Was So Delicious.  I was always afraid to make fried chicken & this recipe made it pretty easy.  I did brine my chicken about 5 hours before putting it in the buttermilk overnight.  My breast did get a little dark (30 minutes may have been to long) but It still tasted great. BF loved it. Thanks Elaine!

This is truly a great recipe. I didn't forget to set it on the rake to give the flour mixture time to turn into a lite paste. Because we like spicy items, I added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper and garlic powder. Also I used smoked Paprika. The family loved it.

More or less followed the instructions apart from using egg instead of buttermilk as that isn't available where I live.  I also floured before and after the egg dip (think I had read so many recipes by this point, I was getting confused over what I was meant to do).  I was doing chicken wings only so I reduced the cook time to 20 mins but the effect was the same.  Very moist inside and crunch outside.  I may have underestimated the amount of paprika needed because they are not very spicy so I will up that next time.

This recipe was awesome. I've made a lot of fried chicken recipes, but this is by far the best. I did use this as a base, but for seasonings I added a few. ..I added some garlic powder and onion powder, and left out the paprika. 

Other than the seasonings, I followed everything to a tee and it was oh so yummy! Thank you so much for this delicious recipe.

NO HIGH heat (burned the first time)...cast-iron pan on low for 15m on each side gives a perfect golden brown crispy crust and juicy result.  I also dip in egg instead of the milk, then the flour mixture, then egg again.  And I cover it with a loose/oversized lid the entire time.

Very good but we thought the coating was a bit bland even with garlic. The method though is fool proof and perfect.

I made this tonight, Superbowl 2016 and for the most part it was amazing. The tip of allowing the coating to set was such a great tip! I myself would probably double the seasonings next time I make it but over all it was the best fried chicken I've ever made! Thanks for the tip!

I made this using chicken breasts and removed the skin. It was so tasty, I added seasoning and garlic salt. I first brined the breasts for 1 hour in sea salt and water in a gallon ziplock bag. It came come super juicy and delicious. I was afraid the batter was not going to stick to the meat without the skin. It did but like the recipe says it's crucial you let the chicken sit covered with the batter on it until it gets a pasty consistency.

Excellent coating. Use my regular fried chicken spices. Don't overload frying pan. Fry as per my regular chicken recipe. Buttermilk made huge difference. Consider double coating.  Used boneless things. Perfect!  Tried in cast iron and regular frying pan. Didn't find any difference. Tried a pinch of rosemary. Was good...but could have used a quarter pinch.  And it needed to be ground powder small.

Cooking for family of six. Could not fit all of the chicken in the cast iron so I had to take about half of it and bake it at 325 after browning it while the second batch was cooked per the recipe. Some liked the baked better as it was moister, but the breading on the batch that was cooked in the cast iron skillet was awesome! Very good will make again.

My family devoured the chicken.  It was certainly the moistest we've had.  No changes other than using boneless strips instead of bone-in chicken.  A definite keeper.

Thanks! The flavor was spot on! I just am not sure why my coating was so dense? It was almost like it was stale? I used Canola oil could that have been the issue or the flour I used? Uggggg so frustrated! But overall chicken was moist as could be!.....great recipe!!!

This is exactly the way I have made mine for 43 years of marriage.  I got it from my grandmother who owned a cafe for years.  It is really tasty and not difficult at all.  Sometimes I double dip the pieces for extra crispness.

I struggled with the recipe because it lacked some cooking details, namely the temperature of the oil.  Also, did anyone else notice that the video lacks the step where the chicken is covered?!  Seriously, if you're going to make a video for a recipe then follow the steps in recipe!  I tried it with just chicken legs and struggled with temperature and cook time.  I did soak the legs in the buttermilk overnight and increased the spices, but I think it could have used more flavor.  The chicken was really moist so not all was lost.  But I definitely need to experiment more with the cooking time and the flavor to make this work.

This is absolutely THE BEST fried chicken recipe I've ever used. My husband says it's right up there with his mom's and she was a fantastic cook from the Deep South.

The key to this recipe is following the directions exactly, especially the first part where one must let a paste form on the dipped chicken. Also, follow the cooking directions exactly, too, and you'll never go out for fried chicken again!

Great recipe if you like fried chicken that isn't soggy!  I brine chicken tenderloin and then add a few seasonings, like celery salt and garlic, and the rest is just as the recipe instructs!

I used boneless, skinless breasts in my version. I also added crushed Ritz crackers to the flour. It didn't take as long to cook since I cut the breasts into strips!

Then I made boneless thighs as directed in two batches. AWESOME!!!

We rarely eat fried foods and even more rarely eat fried chicken (amazing to me since I grew up eating it several times a month). So my chicken frying skills needed much refinement.

Since discovering this recipe, I've made it about half dozen times... to rave reviews. It's ridiculously crunchy & flavorful! I only make it a few times a year... It's always a hit.

Made this last night for dinner.  It was the best fried chicken I've ever made.  Added a little poultry seasoning to the chicken.  Came out delicious.  Will definitely make again.  I served with a copy cat recipe of KFC gravy and coleslaw.  Only thing I was missing was some biscuits.  Next time.  You don't be disappointed.

I  had never tried to cover the chicken while cooking , but thought I'd give it a try and sure enough this technique works well for the large parts such as the thighs and large drumsticks, large breast with bones , but the wings/small drumsticks and parts don't need 30 minutes to cook through.  I like super moist chicken that does not have any over cooked parts, so I've learned to separate prior to cooking, now everything comes out perfectly cooked, by putting small chicken parts in one pan and large parts with bones into another

With all of the 5 star reviews, I expected this this to be like the extra crispy chicken that you get from a focus fast food chain. It was close enough. I also soaked my chicken in a liter of water with a 1/3 cup of kosher salt for one hour.

You can use alternatives to buttermilk!! 

My daughter is allergic to milk, so I mixed up some soy sour cream and water to the consistency of buttermilk and used that. It turned out so great!
This recipe is really simple and delicious. Step 2 is crucial. I have never waited for it to make a paste and I think that is the issue I have had in the past.

I used this recipe with boneless chicken pieces and it was amazing.  Letting the battered chicken pieces sit and the high low high frying are the key.  Instead of paprika, I used a some cajun spice mix I had in the cupboard and it was delicious.

Great crispy fried chicken. I cooked legs and it was so good. Since I was out of paprika I used a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne. Came out juicy and tender. Will definitely make again.

I have been cooking fried chicken for 15 years and this recipe is the best that i have seen, soaking the chicken for 5 minutes in the buttermilk bath, as well as adding minced garlic to the flour mixture, unbelievable taste Elaine O Excellent recipe!!!

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve. I modified the flour mixture slightly to add more paprika, salt and pepper. I also added garlic powder, old bay seasoning and cayenne powder. The chicken was moist on the inside and very crispy on the outside, even the next day out of the fridge! All my guests raved about the chicken and I will absolutely make this again!

Great starting point for a recipe.  I loved all the tutorial information...it was super helpful.  Plus the chicken was quite moist on the inside and perfectly crispy on the outside.   However the coating definitely needs more seasoning...it was a little bland.

Tried this last night.  Needed about 5X the seasoning in the flour in order to actually have a flavor.  I used spices as shown, plus 1/2 again and then added about 1/3C Rotisserie Chicken seasoning and 1-1/2T garlic and onion powder, 1t Lawrey's Seasoning Salt, 1T Paprika. My other problem was I flipped my chicken before turning up the heat and letting it get hot enough again so all the flavored skin then stuck to the bottom of the pan.  Will definitely try  this one again.  It's a great starter to season and make your own. Made great gravy!

I followed this recipe to a T, did not add or change one thing and it did not receive the rave reviews I expected from the hubby or the kids.  Children complained that the crust of the chicken was not flaky and crispy, it was hard. And as most posters before me commented, it lacks enough seasoning to really flavor the crust.  I had to let the chicken pieces sit an hour before the buttermilk/flour coating made a gluelike paste so be prepared to have the prep time needed to make this recipe. I will not be making this again, not because it was bad but because it was not GOOD ENOUGH to warrant the effort!

Moist and crispy! Loved it. Easy to follow. I used a deep fryer so it took about 20 mins. Keep monitoring the chicken so it doesn't get too brown. I  think next time I'll try using one of the injectable creole seasonings on the chicken and have it sit in buttermilk that has been well seasoned ie add salt, pepper etc I'm from the Caribbean and we like our chicken well seasoned. There were a number of great tips from others that I will be sure to incorporate.  5 star recipe.!

Very good recipe. First time I've ever made fried chicken, and it turned out wonderful- a delightful crunch on the outside, and beautifully juicy on the inside. I added a little chilli, garlic, and onion powder along with the paprika, salt and pepper, and was very pleased with the results. Some El Yucateco habanero sauce for dipping, and it was bliss on a plate. Thank you AllRecipes.com!

WoW!    I LOVE fried chicken and, being a single person, do not often engage in preparing foods that require time & patience, but I was realllllly wanting some good, crispy fried chicken and THIS recipe DID IT for me!!!!   Thank you !     AND Thank You for including the "LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!" as I would have ignored that step.    THIS definitely made a difference and I am anXious to make this again.   I only didn't score it a 5* as I need to perfect my version.     Thanks again.   WonDerFuL!

Great crispy recipe. A good basic recipe you can add spices to for a bit of variety. So easy, too. I did thin strips and cooked them for 8-9 minutes at 350 or so in the fryer. Yum.

I'd nearly given up on any desire to put lots of time into fried chicken for a mediocre outcome. This recipe changed that. This is fried chicken done right. Follow the instructions exactly. Give yourself plenty of time to wait for the coating to set up on the chicken. This is the only recipe worthy of my home-grown chickens. Of course it's not health food but for a special occasion, it's worth it!

very simple but really great, we loved it.  I've been looking for a good fried chicken recipe for a long time.  It is very important to let it sit after coating the chicken, that's the one thing I didn't do before.  Next time I will experiment with a few spices.

I just tried this recipe, I think it was very good, crispy and juicy.  the only modification I made was I soaked the chicken in the buttermilk and then dredged it in flour, I did not flour it first. this was an error on my part but it turned out great.  Mine came out a little dark but I like it that way. The crust stayed on just fine.

Made this yesterday.  Sleepy gal aint kidding when she says it's crispy... almost too much for me, honestly, but the flavor is good and the chicken inside is fantastic.  I brined the chicken in salted ice water for 2 hours, then soaked in BMilk for another hour before following the rest of the recipe as is.  Excellent technique.  I'll probably alleviate the pasty stage next time so that the crust isn't so crispy, but the recipe delivered as promised!

This is definitely the best method for frying chicken and getting the best crust.  I agree with other reviewers that it needed more spices.  I added additional paprika, garlic powder and a touch of cayenne.

I made a mess of this wonderful recipe!  I didn't have buttermilk but used the reviewers suggestionf od milk/vinegar but I don't think my chicken got pasty enough (I missed the covering with damp paper towels step) and I didn't drain on a rack, hence very oily/wet, not very crispy chicken.  I also think I put too many in my pan at time, since I was only frying only a few I didn't want to do two batches, big mistake.  I will definitely try again.  On a good note the seasonings were just right!

I loved the frying method, Sleepygal, and will use it always.  I also tried the salt brine mentioned by some reviewers and I believe that helped make it more tender and juicy.  Thanks for your helpful hints, everyone!

This recipe is so simple that you wouldn't expect the wonderful results it produces.  Just the paprika is wonderful but I've been experimenting with other spices and it always turns out terrific.  Thank you for the recipe.

We love this reciepe so much and its great.5 stars all the way.We like to use the chicken breast sliced up into fingers and dip in vinigar.Also I wanted to note that when I ran out of buttermilk I made a comprimise that works just as well when i couldnt find any buttermilk,1/4 sour cream and 1/4 cup 3.25% milk milked so that its thick but not runny either works the same as buttermilk and tastes just as good

My husband and I loved this fried chicken recipe. It's the best I've ever had.  I made mine with chicken wings and it doesn't cook as well as the meatier portions of a chicken. This is my new fried chicken recipe that I will use from now on.

Fantastic! Easy, family loved it! All I changed was I added a 1/2 tsp of OLD BAY seasoning. PERFECT!

I hadn't made true fried chicken in years, but this was excellent; followed recipe exactly, letting chicken sit after flouring.  Hubby and adult grandson LOVED it.  Thanks so much.

This was just okay.  For the prep/cook time it took, I didn't think it was worth it.  I will stick to my own chicken recipe.  Thanks anyway!!

Excellent. I used some home canned tomato juice as a base.

I used this recipe/method for chicken tenders, which can be quite dry.  Very tasty and not dry at all!  Especially with Ranch dressing as a dipping sauce.
