I was not able to try the recipe as dictated as I did not have all ingredients on hand.  However, I was looking for something to do with garbanzo beans for lunch, and this inspired me to make my own 'mock tuna salad' with mayo, garlic, and lemon juice, which was very tasty.  I never would have thought to do something like that without this recipe, and I look forward to making this when I have all ingredients.

This was really good!  The texture is very good, and a bit like tuna salad - though to be honest, I'm no judge, as I haven't had the 'real' stuff in ages.  I'm a Vegan, so I left out the horseradish.  Also, I didn't have any Wasabi or lime juice on hand, so I left that out, and used lemon juice to compensate for the lime.  I also used Veganaise & whole wheat bread crumbs.  I served it on a whole wheat bun with lettuce and tomato, and had it for lunch.  Even my brother liked it, and he hates chickpeas.  So overall, VERY good!

This is delightful!  I used dill relish in mine and then let it sit overnight before serving.
