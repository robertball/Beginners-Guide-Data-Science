Don't let the simplicity of this recipe fool you! These beans are awesome, both in taste and presentation. The walnut oil adds a subtle nuttiness and, if at all possible, should not be substituted. The toasted walnuts also contribute great flavor and at the same time dress the beans up visually. Perfect.

This was Wonderful! I did not have walnut oil so I just used Extra Virgin Olive oil. I also used about a tablespoon of minced garlic since my family doesn't like anything without garlic. It was a hit even though most of my family doesn't like vegetables. Thanks!

I threw this together as a last minute veggie side for guests.  I used frozen green beans, defrosted and substituted olive oil and dried parsely and it was still amazing and so easy.  One of my guests said that she usually didn't like green beans, but these were an exception.

Awesome!  I used olive oil because I couldn't find walnut oil at the store.  I also added some dried cranberries as suggested by some others.  I halved the recipe and still had a huge bowl of green beans.  You are going to need a HUGE pan to sautee the green beans if you do the whole recipe.  I generally hate vegetables and I had no ideas green beans could be this delicious!  And it was super-easy to make!

My husband really liked this recipe. I added fresh minced garlic. It was good tasting and had a nice presentation. Think this would be good for a buffet. I do, however, still prefer the cherry tomato/basil/butter/green bean recipe from this site.

These were good.  This is the best method for cooking green beans that I have found (boiling for 5 minutes then saute for 4 minutes).  I added a some minced garlic because we eat everything with garlic. Didn't have walnut oil so used EVOO. Also be sure to toast the walnuts, that's a must.

I don’t normally have walnut oil on hand but I found out it was worth every penny spent. I par-boiled the green beans in hot water then put it in cold water to cool it. I also added in fresh minced garlic to the oil and butter. The walnut oil added another layer of mild nutty flavor to the beans. Thou I am sure if prepared without the walnut oil this would still be a tasty side dish. The toasted walnuts added texture and makes for a nice presentation. This was an interesting nice twist to plain ole green beans. I paired this side dish with, “Caramel Apple Pork Chops, “ and “Roasted Sweet Potatoes and Onions, “also from this website.

We used frozen green beans, cooked in boiling water and drained.  They were as bright green and crisp as fresh ones.  The walnut oil added a light flavor - not too greasy.  However, it definitely needed salt and pepper.

This dish is delicious! The second time I made it, I made the mistake of preparing it about 30 minutes before we ate it. Definitely not as good. Eat it while it's hot, sucka!

This was a simple and tasty dish!  Toasting the walnuts is key.  You can toast them in the oven or they can be toasted in a non-stick pan, tossing frequently.

Any recipe that helps us eat more tasty veggies is good.  I did splurge for the small bottle of walnut oil for this and found myself throwing it away 1 year later since I left it in the cupboard with this recipe attached to the bottle.  Much better to keep in the fridge so it doesn't go rancid.

Very tasty! We're bored of the same 'ole bagged veggies and this was a nice change! Careful not to get the "nut dust" on the beans - it just doesn't look as nice. But very yummy!!!

Yummo.  Just a few nuts and some green beans and yet somehow seems so special.  We totally loved this and I know we'll be making it again and again. I do think it was key that the nuts were really toasty so don't skip on that!  Thanks for the recipe Tina :)

I wanted something different for our Easter dinner. I made these green beans and everyone loved them! They were a big hit. I nice change from the usual green beans. Next time i will try some toasted almonds..... I think that would go well also.

I've made this recipe 3 times now, Thanksgivng, Christmas Day, and yesterday (12/27) for another family holiday dinner.  It's a big hit.  I think that toasting the walnuts makes all the difference.  The dish looked attractive too in my red serving dish.

Tina, my family loved this recipe! So I didn't have to dirty another pan, I toasted my walnuts in a skillet and then added the other ingredients. As usual, I threw in onion and garlic powder and only used one TBL. of butter. I would make this side for company any day. Thanks so much!!

Served for guests at dinner, everyone liked them except me. I used  canola instead of walnut oil maybe that was the wrong thing to do? Great that they can be cook ahead though.

I love this recipe.  So good and looks so impressive and "fancy" yet so easy.  The walnut oil makes a big difference.  I omitted the parsely because I don't like it and it was still a wonderful side dish.

This was great & so easy! I used frozen whole green beans instead of fresh and used canola oil instead of walnut oil and they turned out great!  I left them out at room temp, as the recipe called for, and heated them up just before dinner, they turned out fabulous, highly recommend this recipe!

These were delicious green beans.  I poured boiling water over my frozen whole green beans and let them sit for a couple of minutes.  I rinsed with cold water and let sit until dry.  The toasted walnuts are essential to this recipe.  This recipe is going to make a lovely addition to my Thanksgiving menu.  Next time I'm going to add garlic for additional flavor, but they're very good as is.

I just adjusted  this recipe to make 3 pounds of green beans and served it to 22 people.  I didn't change the recipe at all, except I didn't add salt or pepper.  Everyone really liked it and the entire bowl disappeared!  You know it's good when people ask you for the recipe!

I roasted the walnuts a little longer, for 10 minutes Then, I didn't have walnut oil so I used olive oil and I used about half as much oil and butter as the recipe called for....  it was DELICIOUS!  My family, including my 3 and 5 year old loved it. I will be making this again for sure.

Excellent flavor.  I think the recipe calls for too many walnuts.

This was good.  I did not use walnut oil, instead I used olive oil.  Was good and my husband asked me to make it again.

This is a great combo.. I used canned beans (which I never like) and it was a great compliment.
