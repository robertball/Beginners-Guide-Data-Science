A very decent dish with a few personally motivated modifications.  I omitted the sun dried tomatoes and dill because I'm not a fan of either and secondly I thought they (the sun dried tomatoes) might taste odd with the other ingredients.
Instead I used what I had in the fridge which was a red bell pepper and two small tomatillos (which added a great tartness to the dish) It turned out very well with all of the other ingredients and to finish I mixed in a dollop of Greek yogurt to add a little acidic creaminess and make it almost korma like.  Very tasty.

I'm writing this directly after making and eating this dish for the first time. It is a very filling and hearty meal, which is something I look for when I cook vegetarian. -- I cooked it with golden couscous instead of whole wheat, omitted sun-dried tomatoes, and added about a 1/2 cup of diced tomatoes to it later in the process. Everything about this dish was good & I will likely consider making it on a monthly basis. The only thing I may consider altering further is adding a bit more veggie broth. The final product I made wasn't too dry but it could've been a little wetter.

My vegetarian daughter loved it and so did everyone else!  The only substitution was roasted grape tomatoes instead of sun-dried, and I also added  some toasted pine nuts.  Really delicious!

I made this as is and it was awesome. Omitting the sundries tomatoes and dill means you are making a different recipe. It was delicious just the way it called for. I used fresh spinach instead of previously frozen.  If I had goat cheese in my fridge I would sprinkle that on top after dishing it up.

Very tasty!  I omitted the dill and sun dried tomatoes. I added chopped par-boiled carrots and used chopped spring mix salad instead of the spinach. Also added a bit of garam masala. I will definitely make this again.

I used less olive oil--just drizzled to my liking and used 2 large English cucumbers, seeded.  Other than the tedious peeling and chopping of the fresh garlic, it was pretty quick.  Next time I will just use my garlic press to speed things up.

I made this recipe as directed. The couscous ended up being a little dry so I added half a cup more vegetable broth. It turned out delicious. I don't think I will use sundried tomatoes next time but I might add some chopped peppers and halved cherry tomatoes instead. As a base recipe, this one is a keeper.

I love sundried tomatoes, but somehow their flavor didn't mix with the curry in my opinion.  I also noted my guests did rave about it as they usually do my dishes.  Hmmmmm, don't know how to tweak it.  Probably won't make it again.

I wanted to give this 5***** but I just couldn't.
It was horribly bland to me. It needs something to spice it up. I would put in 1.5 tbs of curry and maybe some cumin. all I tasted was the veggie  broth and spinach. This has amazing potential but it just needs some help.

Easy, tasty, and all kinds of substitutions/omissions are fine!  I didn't have sun-drieds, dill or curry, so I used cumin and cherry tomatoes. I also put in carrots.  It tastes great.  I was going to add feta, but mine was spoiled.  I think it would have tasted awesome, though.  I don't enjoy cooking, but this was worth it!

Excellent recipe! Based on suggestions and supplies, I left out the tomato and dill and used fresh spinach. Everyone really liked it and I was firmly told to make it again!

I substituted the tomatoes with raisins and also left out the dill.   A great quick, healthy, and delicious recipe.

Delicious.  I'm neither vegan nor vegetarian, so I threw in a chopped up chicken breast and made the couscous with chicken broth, not veggie.  No chickpeas on hand and used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Will definitely make again.

I thought the recipe was really nutritious.  I would probably add some mushrooms next time and serve it with yoghurt.

This turned out fantastic, with a couple of last-minute subs based on what was in my kitchen.

Substitutions:
• Sun-Dried Tomatoes: 1/4C Arriabata sauce (any spicy pasta sauce would work)
• Sherry: Merlot
• Curry powder: Curry paste
• A bit more Cayenne

This is an excellent vegan recipe! I followed the directions exactly with one exception: I used the olive oil from the sundried tomato jar. I don't usually like Curry, but I love it in this recipe!!! Thank you for sharing!

Amazing! I didn't know what to expect at it was one of the most scrumptious, filling, and "light" meals on this site. The sun dried tomatoes really are a must. Didn't have the cayenne pepper and didn't add salt, and I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, but otherwise followed the recipe. Made plenty...probably slightly more than 4 servings.
