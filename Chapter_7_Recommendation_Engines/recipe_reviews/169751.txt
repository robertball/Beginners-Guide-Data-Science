Fantastic - I found this as a last minute addition to a dinner party after one of our guest informed us they were avoiding oil. I made this and it turned out really wonderfully. 

A very light and refreshing dressing.

I'm giving this a 5 for the idea, however I added some mustard and a little honey, and I don't think I would have eaten the dressing without these additions. I can see a lot of possibilities for this, though, like adding garlic, celery seed, mustard seeds, etc. Thanks for the inspiratiion!

I used apple cider vinegar and had this over a spinach salad that had apples in it. Very light dressing and was just right for the salad I had.

The dressing could easily be a dip for any veggie.  It is very important not to mix it in advance.  It gets watered down with cucumbers.

Not terrible, but pretty boring. I could see this working better for grain salads, or bean salad... not green salads. I saw that one reviewer added mustard and honey. That would probably be a good improvement. My salad needed more! I'm always looking cut cut back on or omit oil in recipes. I really wanted to love this.
