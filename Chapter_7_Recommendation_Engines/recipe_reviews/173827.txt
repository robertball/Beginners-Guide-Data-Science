Word up -- I used 1/4 c sugar + 1/4 c honey instead of the full c sugar, plus I substituted blueberries for some raspberries. It was very tasty!

I halved the recipe. Used strawberries, blackberries, blueberries and an apple as my fruit. Half sugar, half honey. May use less sugar next time. We found the mint in the salad a little too leaf-y texture-wise so I may omit it next time or simmer it into the syrup. Also, did not use water for the syrup... I used limoncello instead ;) DELISH.

This was absolutely wonderful! Very refreshing yet sweet enough that it tastes like a desert. I did take the advise of another reviewer and used half honey. Very nice flavor and a little healthier. Thanks! :-)

Outstanding!  I read the other reviews, and changed it slightly.  I added the mint to the sauce and strained it out with the cinnamon and lemon zest.  I didn't change the sugar, but doubled the amount of sauce and used about 2/3rds of it on the fruit.  I also cut the recipe from 12 servings to 4.  YUM!!

Wonderful way to flavor simple syrup!  Now I want to try lemon and mint, lemon and ginger, lemon, ginger and mint, orange and cinnamon...endless possibilities!
