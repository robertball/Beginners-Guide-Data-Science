I used regular gin instead of lemon gin and added some lemon juice. I also used lemonade and limeade concentrate instead of lemon/orange. Delicious!

This is a good one, a few suggestions: We used 4-5 tea bags,combined with sugar and water then let steep for a few hrs.  Then combine and freeze. We also love fresh mint with lime slices on top-something to dress it up. Enjoy :)
