Wow. I followed this recipe instructions exactly, except for the fact that I had no idea where to find cloves, and I don't personally like mushrooms. Yes, it takes a while, but you can reasonably break down tasks simultaneously. So that not much prep time is needed, and much of your dishes and waste are already dealt with before the meal is prepared. This meal was incredible. It's *better* than most restaurants. I used a stock pot for the first step, and a dutch oven for steps three through six. In hindsight, I wish I had used chicken broth instead of water in step one. Even without, I am telling you this stew is incredible. The combination of herbs is good. One set of herbs (tarragon, rosemary, herbes de Provence) reminds me a little of absinthe for some reason, while the others added plenty of spiciness. I highly recommend this meal. It deserves WAY more reviews. It is spicy hot as some noted, but not overly so. If one doesn't want it, they could probably leave out the cayenne pepper. I think the cayenne pepper makes it perfect, however.

Full of flavor with perfect results. Be warned this is spicy hot, so do take that into account when preparing  this dish. I used dried herbs as I did not have the fresh and just cut back to 1 tsp. of each. I made homemade dumplings instead of the purchased biscuits. Simply dropped them into the stew and done in 20 minutes in the oven (kept the pot top on). Really great recipe, Chef John.

This was tasty, but a bit too spicy. Next time I would not so much fresh taragon since it has a strong licorice flavor to it.  I probably would opt for a spoon of it dry.  I'd also cut all of the pepper in half and then add individual taste after it's served.

Awesome recipe!  Only a few things I did to make this simpler:  One I baked chicken breasts in the oven and used store bought chicken stock, and two I did not cook the stew for 45 min.  I let it cook just until the carrots were tender.  The fresh herbs make this!!  Oh, I baked it in a 9x13 pan, and split the biscuits in half so that they cooked through faster.  DEEEEEELISH!!!!!!

WOW! I can't believe there aren't more written reviews.  I didn't have all of the herbs called for but used what I had, and the stew was amazing. I also didn't have mushrooms, so I just added a few more carrots and celery (including the celery leaves because they always add great flavor).  It is definitely worth the stove time.

I gave this 3 stars because the basics are there for a good dish but it's not good as written. For starters, there is way, way too much pepper and it overpowers everything else. The last time I was around someone using this much pepper, they were heavy smokers and their taste buds were zilched. Start out by reducing the pepper asked to 1/2 or 1/3 and increase or reduce it from there next time. 

If you try to rush the dish and not let it simmer to thicken, then it will turn out very runny. I substitute frozen bisquits and they work out just fine and I like the flavor better than canned biscuits.

I am just so happy I found and tried this recipe. It is flavourful and delicious. A warning to those about to make it it is a tad bit spicey. I am not one for spicey foods but I still loved this. Next time I will tone it down with the peppers. I think it is a must to use all the spices otherwise you will lose some of the flavor. I cannot wait to make this again. I should mention I don't own a dutch oven so those like me can use a stock pot and then throw it all in a roaster when it is time to place in the oven. Works just the same. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe!

Comfort food times ten. I did a double take when I saw the ingredient amounts for the herbs and spices. After reading through other reviews, I checked the amounts for this recipe on Chef John’s website. They were the same. Made the decision to halve them and am glad I did. Was a terrific combination and still had plenty of punch. For the liquid used half homemade stock and half water. I think next time I’ll add an additional piece of carrot and celery.

I admit I left out the cayenne in deference to my kids, but otherwise made as directed and WOW, is this yummy. I'm going to start stalking Chef John around this site.

OMG!!! My family thinks I'm a good cook but kind of takes me for granted, this dish was the exception, they kept repeating throughout the meal how great it was and when was I going to make it again! At first I was disappointed that the "gravy" wasn't as thick as I thought it should be but when we all started drinking it with our spoons like soup it didn't seem like a bad idea. Definitely a keeper.

Chef John's recipes never dissapoint! Wonderful flavors, well worth the time spent by the stove. Used some different herbs (tarragon just isn't available, darn) but wow. Oh, and DO use cream, rather than milk if you are not calorie-conscious.

I think that people who wrote a review should only rate the ORIGINAL RECIPE (follow the original recipe exactly)  from Chef John ( or whomever) they must make it according to the ORIGINAL recipe from the web site.  Then, if they make adjustments to THEIR taste, submit THAT recipe for other folks to try and rate.  I do not find the reviewers opinions credible when they change the recipe and then give it review stars. Totally BS.

This is pretty good - spicy, hearty... I did use dried spices, which probably made the flavors more intense, so next time I'll scale it down (although it's not a problem - it's really good just the way it is).  My boyfriend raved about it, so I'd say it's a keeper!  It's different than the usual chicken and dumplings I eat - probably just more herbs and spices, so it's all dependent on how you like it.  I like it both ways.  :)

Overall, we really liked the dish but were surprised by the peppery bite.   Next time, I will leave out the cayenne completely and it will be perfect.   Also, I didn't add the biscuits and served it over rice along with broccoli and a green salad.

Delicious! Short on time I used boneless skinless chicken breast cut up and cooked with garlic cloves  and used chicken broth instead of the homemade stock, and it was still amazing! This will become a staple recipe in my kitchen.

A lot if work for a good-but-not-quite-outstanding dish. I started w a cooked rotisserie chicken in hopes of speeding things along, and I used purchased stock. It is a spicy dish even with only a couple of shakes of cayenne; if I make again, I might eliminate it entirely. Shred the chicken while the sauce cooks down; doing so would have saved me time, and I wish the recipe had been written that way.

I was really looking forward to some classic comfort food since Chef John advertised it was kind of three classic comfort food meals all times into one and I was so disappointed.  First, let me start with what I did like.  The chicken was most and delicious, and the sauce was the perfect consistency.  The sauce was nice and creamy without being too heavy out thick.  The reason I have it three stars was the herbs and spices.  I think they're all wrong for this recipe.  I'd recommend using thyme or another herb that you think goes well with the chicken in place of the tarragon.  The tarragon simply overpowered the dish.  My family loves spice, heat, and pepper.  It was just way too much of just about everything.  I'd recommend omitting entirely either the white or black pepper, just choose one, and reducing all other seasonings by about half at least.  While I was making this recipe I was thinking that everything seemed out of whack quantity wise, but I decided against my gut trusting that since the recipe said it was submitted by a 'Pro Chef' that I should leave it up to the 'Pro.'  I should've trusted my gut and adjusted everything spice/herb wise.

This is, in fact, a time-consuming, overly spiced knock-off chicken and dumpling recipe. The result is 1/4 inch deep in butter fat and the only flavor, is too much pepper.

It is delicious.  I only used 1/4 tsp of cayenne, though, as I have 2 young grandchildren to serve it to.  I would say to start out with a smaller dose of cayenne, even for adults, and then go from there.  Cayenne doesn't have a lot of flavor on its own, it is mostly heat.  As for the prep time...it is always worth it to invest a little time in cooking...although I do understand time restraints.

Everyone loved it. I had to make gluten-free adaptations for my daughter, but it was still a hit. I hand made biscuits using Namaste Foods Gluten Free Biscuit mix. This recipe takes a lot of time so I will save it for special days or when I am craving comfort food.

I am writing my first Allrecipes review for a very worthy recipe.  I thoroughly enjoyed making this dish although it took some time.  It turned out fantastic!  It is one of the best chicken dishes I have had.  

These are the changes I made:
I didn't have a clove so I used 1 tsp ground cloves
I didn't add the mushrooms or the chicken back into the sauce until the final step when I put the Dutch Oven in the oven (to prevent them from being overcooked)
I cooked the veggies and butter in the Dutch oven for 25 minutes instead of 10 because it took a longer time for them to begin to become tender.
I used 3/4 of the chicken stock and very gradually (so the sauce would be more thick) 
I used 1 cup of milk instead of 1/2 cup
I used 2 tsp tarragon instead of 3 Tbsp

I have never made a chicken stock and this recipe made a VERY tasty one.  I'll be making this again!

Amazing recipe! All that work to cheap out on refrigerated biscuits is silly, though. I use the Bisquick drop dumpling recipe, put it in the oven for 12 minutes uncovered, and 12 minutes covered and it is amazing. If there are kids, I use half the cayenne pepper, but the rest of the seasonings are perfect. Made at least 10 times and shared, and it is an instant favorite!!!

This was great! Used frozen biscuits as another reviewer mentioned, added 1 cube of Knorr's homestyle stock and omitted the mushrooms.  It was fabulous and very, very tasty.  Definitely a keeper!

Very Hearty meal!! I even cut out the butter to make it low-cholesterol and it was still delish!  First off, the chicken and stock came out great! The chicken was not dry at all. I used grains of paradise and a pinch of all spice since I did not have cloves; and fresh sage instead of bay leaf.  When I cooked the vegetables I used olive oil instead of butter because my husband has high cholesterol.  Also, I made biscuits from scratch using olive oil instead of butter and just baked them for ten minutes before placing them on top of the dish, (the mix is runny not stiff like canned biscuits so I didn't want them to sink!)  Overall, the meal took a long time to prepare but was very hearty and flavorful plus I had leftovers. You get A LOT of meal just from a chicken some vegetables and herbs so it's family-budget-friendly :)  It is a little spicy, next time I will put less cayenne, and I think I will maybe add some parmesan to give it something a little extra since I cut out the butter!  Very impressed and will definitely be making again!

This is an amazing meal.  Since my husband isn't as adventuresome as he might me, I left out some of the pepper so it wouldn't be so spicy.  We put the leftover in the freezer for another meal and look forward to having it!  It would be a great meal for company if you didn't mind the amount if kitchen time it requires!

Freakin Awesome! The flavors and the consistency were beyond fantastic.  I used chicken base in the water when first cooking the chicken which really added great flavor.  The only complaint I have is that it took half the day to prepare it. This dish is so good, though, I will set aside a day and make a huge batch.

I used slightly less than 4 lbs. of chicken part because all whole chickens were much larger than 4 lbs.  I was a bit thrown off by the 9 qt. stock pot.  I used a 6 qt. and it was fine.  I used dried tarragon but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  It took all afternoon and while it was good I don't think it was worth the effort.  My simple chicken and dumpling recipe is better and completely homemade.  Sometimes simpler is better.  My husband liked the spiciness, but with the time involved he won't see this  one again.

Made this last night, it was a little time consuming to make but it came out good, didn't have tarragon so left that out, used cream instead of milk, and added more cayanne pepper than what it called for, and used pilsbury grand biscuits, I will make this again

This was quite time consuming and I swore I would not make it again however after I tasted it and my family raved about it I will make again. I followed the recipe with a few changes. I cut back on the cayenne, added some fresh green beans and used rosemary spice instead of fresh. I did use fresh Tarragon and it was exceptional. It is a must. I probably used too much of the chicken broth because I had to thicken it with additional flower before I added the chicken and herbs. I also did half of the biscuits with gluten free Bisquick. I try to eliminate wheat in all recipes. Even though there is flower the g-free Bisquick helps. I thought it was even better because the g-free biscuits sank into the chicken broth and seemed to absorb the spices and flavors.  Outstanding!

Heaven!! Made exactly  but with just a pinch of Cayenne cause husband doesn't like hot. BTW- a pinch of Cayenne marries all the other spices perfectly and does not add Hot. (Husband will never know Ha-ha). This is another keeper from Chef John! Chef John rocks and is my Hero!!

Delicious. Perfect for a cool weekend. I didn't have canned biscuits so I used the Joy of Cooking recipe for cornmeal dumplings, covered and simmered for 20 minutes. I
I also cut the pepper in half, but I think I could have used more. I will definitely make again.

I have made this recipe many times since I first saw it fall of 2012; in fact I have bought 3 friends a porcelain Dutch oven to make this in so they could have it too.  This is delicious and so worth the time spent preparing it.  I look forward to cool weather just so I can make this!  The recipe is wonderful just as it is.  Try it and enjoy.

It's a good base recipe, but know your limits when it comes to pepper! I cut mine down to 1/2 tsp of cayenne and only a sprinkling of the black and white peppers, but that was too much heat for my preferences. This makes a hearty dish with very generous portions. It's fairly simple despite the long list of ingredients. I was also hesitant on the tarragon because I'm one of those people who gets put off by the licorice-y taste. I topped mine with the Cheddar Onion Drop Biscuits on this site and that made a nice touch which helped to somewhat alleviate the peppery bite. My husband was impressed. Would season according to personal tastes, but would make again. I'm giving it four stars because I not everyone would be able to eat this if made exactly as written; still, it is a good recipe. Thank you, Chef John!

Excellent recipe, I have made this several times now but usually adjust the seasoning because it is spicy.  I also don't add the carrots anymore just because my daughter and I like it better without and just add a lot more mushrooms.  But this is an awesome recipe with or without adjustments.. It has become our new favorite comfort food here.  Thanks Chef!

I generally don't rate recipes I've altered as I feel it is unfair to the submitter. In this case, however, I'm doing so as I feel the original recipe is a 10 star as my somewhat-healthier-so-we-can-have-it-more-often version is a 5. Roux is great but not for an everyday meal in our house sadly. In place of butter, I use 1 TBS of olive oil and 1-2 TBS of flour in lieu of the half cup. We use soy milk in cooking and I don't add tarragon, which are strictly health/taste variations. This is one spicy, delightful dish. And who knew that canned biscuits would be perfect? Oh, and I've used homemade broth and in a pinch Trader Joe's low-sodium version. All good.

Fabulous!  I used leftover grilled chicken breasts and store-bought stock, skipping steps 1 & 2.  Also, I had to DIY the herbs de Provence with marjoram, basil, thyme & rosemary.  Spicy & flavorful, restaurant quality meal ~ thanks, Chef John!

6 Stars! One of the best recipes ever! Really, I would not change anything. Whole family LOVED it. If I’m in a rush next time, I’ll try with pre cooked rotisserie chicken and chicken stock and skip the 1 hour to simmer the chicken.

I didn't used any white pepper and cut the red pepper back to 1/4 tsp. otherwise I think it would have had way too much pepper.  I turned the biscuits around after 20 minutes to prevent them from being soggy on the bottom.  With these changes I would rate this a 5.

Very tasty, not for a quick meal obviously.  I didn't follow directions properly and totally covered chicken with water instead of measuring out the 2 quarts! Had alot of broth to deal with but cooked it down after adding veggies and added more flour to thicken.  Would add more veggies next time, peas, perhaps potatoes! Yummy!

Not good, and I cut back on the herbs and eliminated all the peppers, but it still came out way too herby - rather overpowering.  Plus it is labor and time intensive.

This was an absolute hit with my family on a cold snowy Colorado evening.  I used a rotisserie chicken i picked up from the supermarket, cut the meat down and went for it.  The only modification that I made was that I used Bisquick instead of tube dough and placed the dough balls on top.  I popped it in the oven and WOW did it come out great!

I made it as written, except omitted the shrooms because the hubs isn't a fan. OMG, so good. Full of flavor, packed a bit of a kick. The hubs and little guy couldn't have raved more. If you don't like heat, halve the cayenne. If you don't like a flavorful stew, walk away. I'd like the sauce a little thicker, but I misread and didn't cook the veggies in the flour for five minutes. This is a lot of work but worth every minute!

This was a very satisfying dinner.  I did use pre made chicken stock to cook the chicken and cut the pepper way back , but following the instructions to put in the oven and brown/steam the biscuits  makes a perfect crust. This is a little bit of change from my usual chicken pot pie. Will make it again!

So so good!!! I doubled as I was making two of them. I used Rotisserie chickens from Sams. I cut the pepper and for me it is still spicy but my other half loves it. I used 1tsp cayenne and 1 tsp of white pepper and 1/2 tsp of black pepper and it was a doubled recipe in all else. When I make again I will cut the pepper a bit more. I used frozen Biscuits so it took a little longer in the oven and I didn’t cover as much due to steam keeping them soggy.

Outstanding recipe!  Labour intensive, but so worth it.  I used cream instead of milk.  Gravy had a beautiful consistency. I substituted the prefabricated biscuits with Chef John’s Buttermilk Biscuits recipe.  Served with a side dish of Chef John’s glazed Acorn Squash.  Chef John continues to be my culinary hero.

Delicious! A little fussy to make, but worth it. So flavorful. Not like most chicken and dumpling recipes that are so bland. I used chicken broth and made dumplings instead of using canned Bisquits. Would definitely make it again. And again.

My daughters love this! However, first time I made it, because of reviews, I added 1/2 the cayenne. I love spicy but this was a good call. Made last night and forgot to cut cayenne, whooeee! A bit much, wondering if Chef John really used that much...I love the flavors w/ tarragon, etc., but even as a “heat” lover, too much. Otherwise, AWESOME!! Don’t skimp on the chicken, I used a rotisserie from grocery store and it was not enough meat. A definite keeper, just add a little of the pepper then more later if you wish...

So over spiced. And spicy hot. I agree with reviewer that said spice flavor was off. There's just way too much sh*t in it. Took a long time to make and went right into the garbage disposal. Super disappointed and hate wasting food.

Delicious!  I skipped the first two steps, and instead used skinless chicken thighs (bone-in) and cooked them in store-bought chicken broth.  I let them simmer for about 3 hours until the meat fell off the bones.  I also cut the cayenne down to 1/4 tsp and used dried herbs instead of fresh.  Everybody enjoyed it!

I had all the dark meat and stock from a turkey (Alton Brown's recipe) and wanted to make a pot pie of some kind. I tried this with some modifications -- used carrots, onion, potato and zucchini, turkey stock, dark meat and less herbs/spices. It was time-consuming and messy to make (which I found relaxing), but yielded a delicious stew.I made Chef John's buttermilk biscuits and a spinach salad to go with it. Yum!

Sorry.  I did not like this recipe at all.  My husband would not eat it again.  He had to have another biscuit to put out the flames in his mouth from all the peppers.  I usually like all of Chef John's recipes so I followed the directions exactly as written. Wish I would have followed the advice given by some reviews to drastically reduce the peppers.

I read over the reviews before making this and did some changes on that but others because I didn't have the ingredient...boiled the chicken in chicken broth w/splash of lemon  juice, left out white pepper, tarragon,  rosemary,  and clove since I didn't have any of those but I did add lemon pepper, poultry seasoning, and crushed red pepper  (along with the ground)

I didn't find this too peppery at all but I'm also the type of person who eats pepper on EVERYTHING

I also used this recipe the other night but added the juice of 1 lemon, lemon zest, and instead of biscuits used wild rice mix (about 1 cup and a half)

This was amazing!!!  Only made minor changes:  almost burned the biscuits, 17 min was plenty.  Added a few extra mushrooms.  Had to add more flour it was like water, I think I used another 1/4c or so.  I like it spicy but word to the wise if you are inviting company use only 1/2tsp of cayenne.  Oh and since I used a very wide roasting pan in the oven I ended up using to small 6oz cans of biscuits (10 total).  This recipe just jumped to my #1.  Thanks Chef John!!

Every time I make this, people love it! I usually put just a little less cayenne in it because most people that I cook for don't like things as spicy as I do, but it still has good spice and is very savory. It's a wonderful comfort food with great taste!

I also boil chicken in broth which means little to no extra salt is needed.  I might increase roux and liquid amounts next time to have more sauce. Overall a great recipe. Herbs and spices really make it special. I don't like peas but family does so I serve those on the side.

Five stars ONLY if I cut back on the three peppers by half. Otherwise rich, flavorful, and substantial. I make this often and my guys love it. So satisfying.

I followed the recipe closely and per other comments the peppers really over power the dish.  Next time I will eliminate the cayenne and cut the black and white peppers by 2/3.  Otherwise it is flavorful and easy to prepare.

It was delicious but a little too much pepper for our taste. The flavores are rich and complex. The store bought biscuits detract from the from scratch flavors. There are many steps in this recipie but worth it.  Homemade biscuits would add to the work but probably worth it.  Will definitely make it again, cut down on the pepper and add more vegies.

Made exactly as directed. Well, almost. I knew I had to go easy on the spices. But that said, this was the absolute most flavorful and delicious chicken dish I think I have ever made. Take the time, and you will not be disappointed. Bravo!

Good idea but the pepper was overwhelming making the dish way too hot for my family. Too bad because when the dish came out of the oven I was thrilled - it was beautiful! I might be willing to try again cutting pepper dramatically.

All I can say is CHEF JOHN FOR PRESIDENT!
This is probably the best dish I make.  My wife loves it , loves it.  I made the dish as written, could only get fresh tarragon, and no Herbs de Provich., but it is still excellent.

Loved it!!  I decreased the cayenne by half and was still a little spicy for some though - fair warning.  The family consensus was that it was just as good the next day for lunch!

I made this for my family and it was awesome! It was so delicious. I will definitely be making this again. It does come out slightly spicy so if you don't like spicy maybe use less spices.

The cayenne is completely overwhelming!  Left out the white pepper but used the full amount of black and cayenne and regretted it.  It seemed to be a good enough recipe otherwise to try again.

Awesome!  I found it to be a little spicy though, and I think the pepper takes away from the flavor of the stew itself.  Next time I will cut the pepper way back

This is a really good recipe. The entire guest loved it.  Maybe next time I will add one chicken breast to add more meat. This is a keeper.  Great for a Sunday dinner. My sides were boiled corn and salad.

This was very good, like a chicken pot pie with biscuits for the crust.  However, I agree with the reviewers who said it was too peppery.  Although I deleted the black pepper, it was still a bit too peppery, so next time I will decrease the other peppers, also.

This was so easy to make.  I am not a fan of spice so I omitted the wht pepper and cayenne .  The broth was excellent and the fleur de Provence made the dish. Thanks John.

I could not give this 5 stars because like many others, I halved the pepper(s)amounts and omitted herbes de Provence(didn't have). Topped with my own homemade biscuits.  It's a marvelous recipe, but very time-consuming. If you have that rainy morn or afternoon and are in your cooking mood, you can't go wrong. Give it 3-1/2 hours. Even with the time involved, it's lovely.  But then again, I think I'm in love with Chef John.

Chef John, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but my mother always referred to the scum that you and I (as well as many others) remove is albumin. Sidebar on this:  When my gramma made her chicken soup, she kept it at a low simmer and skimmed every last bit from the pot, resulting in golden yellow broth that was absolutely clear.
Kugelblitz, whole cloves are found in your grocery store along with other spices and herbs.
This recipe knocked our socks off, and I wasn't even wearing any! While I may adjust seasonings a bit next time, I made it according to the recipe.  DH  and I pigged out on it, and Himself took the rest to work, where he'll share with whichever one of his employees has first shift with him that day (they rotate).

My whole family loved it!  Time consuming, so I made a double batch using a large roasting pan, two chickens, and doubled the ingredients.  I didn't use mushrooms, cayenne pepper or herbs de Provence but threw in some thyme instead.  I used all dried herbs.  Don't throw in extra liquid if it seems too thick as it will be great thicker later with the biscuits.  Will def make again!

Made this tonight using grocery store rotisserie chicken, veggies off the store salad bar and boxed chicken stock - so good everyone had seconds. And my picky child had a third dish. So quick and easy I'll make this again. I can't imagine how good if I had cooked the chicken from scratch. Thanks, Chef John!

I loved this recipe! Unless you are brand new to cooking and either don't have experience yet or don't yet trust your own cooking instincts, you can just use your judgement regarding the types and amounts of spices you use in this or any recipe. For instance, I don't like a ton of pepper in my dishes, so I simply cut back the amount called for in this recipe and it was perfect for us. I also rarely put cayenne in recipes like this, so I left that out too. So for us, with these small changes, it is a five star recipe! Thanks Chef John!!

I first started making this recipe a couple of years ago.  At first, I needed the video to help me, as I am in no way, shape, or form a chef.  Now I know the recipe and can pretty much just glance and throw it together.  Point is:  It gets to be pretty simple after you've made it a couple times.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!!  It is the perfect blend of everything and my family/friends think I am much more of a cook than I really am when I make it, which is a great thing.  It's creamy and flavorful with a pretty decent kick, yet balanced out by the sweetness of the biscuits.  [Note:  I think one could use a tiny bit less spice, evenly proportioned down by maybe an eighth or quarter of teaspoon - the spices seem to all work their magic together, so to take out a little of one might ruin the harmony.]

Thank you, Chef John!  You rock.

Chef, loved this recipe!  I was wanting comfort food and I got it with this dish.  I did need to substitute a couple of ingredients in that we eat Primal and it worked beautifully.  Coconut flour for all-purpose flour, heavy cream for milk, and no biscuits.  I will definitely be making this again and again.  Also, I loved the spices just the way they were written.

I confess, I took a huge shortcut and used a Costco rotisserie chicken for this recipe.  Hey, it saved me time!  I didn't use celery (forgot to buy some) or the herbes de Provence because I didn't want to buy it just for this recipe and I don't like fennel. I followed the advice of previous cooks and halved the spices and it was still spicy.  Just right for me as I like spicy food, but even at halved quantities it may be too spicy for some palates.  
I used Pillsbury Grands biscuits which were surprisingly salty.  I checked the nutrition label afterwards and saw that one serving contains 24% of your DV of sodium!  One tip, if you choose to go with a rotisserie chicken, keep in mind that it is already salted or brined and adjust the amount of salt you add to the stew mixture.  Overall a good recipe and once you know the basics you can adjust the seasoning to your liking.

Great tasting broth. I used Pillsury Grands frozen biscuits instead. Combination of veggies is good. I added frozen peas also. The fresh herbs made all the difference!

Absolutely "loved it" and so did the Mister. And your video too that was a huge help. I finally feel like an adult since I can make a inexpensive meal, that's savory and filling, and everyone without a doubt, absolutely loves.
