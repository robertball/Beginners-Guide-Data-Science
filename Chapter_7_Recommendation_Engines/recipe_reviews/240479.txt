let me say, this is spot on! I didn't have time to make the complete loaf, so I thought a little out side of the box. I combined all the spices to make my donair spice blend. for the meat portion, I used a box of steak-umms! take your time cooking these. slice in three; pan fry, don't flip or stir as the strips will fall apart and turn into cheesestake meat. While cooking the meat add the spice. This recipe is for 5lbs of meat. using the spice blend, I used 4.5 tsps for the one pound box of steak umms.  AMAZING! Just like home, Listuguj, QC The sauce is good however, next time I would use about 1/2 tsp less of garlic powder. 
Thanks for sharing!

Will definitely make this again. Like the sauce, this needs to sit overnight to give the best flavour.

It texture is perfect made it exactly as directed. A little to spicy for my husband will cut back on the heat to half and it really doesn't need that much salt. All things aside and done great recipe taste and texture just like a Donair. I did not make the sweet sauce I don't like a sweet sauce with Donairs I preferred the cucumber sauce.
