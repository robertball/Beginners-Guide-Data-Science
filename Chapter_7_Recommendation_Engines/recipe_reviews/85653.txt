I made the recipe as written, with the exception of reducing salt to two tablespoons.  While it is certainly less time consuming to buy Jalapeno Powder, if you are feeling particularly adventureous, you can make your own, if you have an abundance of peppers in your garden. Cut jalapenos in half, or quarters, and seed so they will dry faster and more evenly. Place, in one layer, on a parchment-lined cookie sheet. Bake at 200 degrees, 1-3 hours, removing those that become dry, so they don`t burn. When cooled grind the peppers in a blender, or food processor, to make jalapeno powder. Store in an air-tight jar. (Wear gloves while handling peppers and be careful not to breathe in the jalapeno pepper dust when grinding).

Today, I found Jalapeno Pepper Salt at my small town grocers, $2.99 for 7 ounces, not too expensive at all.  It was much better than what I had made using this recipe. Taste test, and use the salt cautiously--even the smallest dab on the tip of a finger will get your FULL attention!  And, it will leave you wanting more.

I use Himalayan Pink Fine Ground salt since bleached salt is not good for us. My husband is addicted to this one! He's a Jalapeno lover and puts them on just about everything he eats. Thanks and easy to boot - I'm just reusing the commercial Jalapeno shaker. btw - the commercial salt he uses also has MSG in it and this does not. I also use organic ground jalapeno.
