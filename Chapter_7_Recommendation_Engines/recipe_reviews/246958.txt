This was a hit with my family! We loved it! I made it as the recipe is written. The only change I made was to add a half cup of sweet vidalia onion with the bell pepper.  I also served salsa and sour cream on the side.  This recipe seems easy to change up. I think bacon, cheddar cheese, cooked potatoes, could also work in this recipe.
