Good recipe, however I cooked the artichokes first and used the cooked leaves as garnish arranged like flower petals around my pasta bowl. I only used 2 cups heavy cream and added a bit more sugar to cut the acid of the tomatoes since I only used white cooking wine.  Overall we liked it and have a ton of sauce left over the freezer to have a second time.

Recipe Group Selection:  08, February 2014 ~ I thought the sauce had good flavor, but DH, not so much.  I made a half batch of sauce in the morning and slowly reheated it in the evening and added the parmesan cheese at that point. I served this with steamed cauliflower and garlic toast.  I think I will repurpose the leftover sauce into a small pan of lasagna.

My family RAVED about this pasta sauce; it was a real hit! We really enjoyed the arties and the sun-dried tomatoes and the flavor of the sauce with the liquid smoke was interesting and tasty.  Thanks a lot; I will definitely make this again!
