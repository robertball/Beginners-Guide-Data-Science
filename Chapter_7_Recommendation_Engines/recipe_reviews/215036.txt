Delicious!  Very sweet & fantastic!  It was a little runny, so next time I weill add a bit more flour to thicken it up a bit.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is excellent! I tweaked this just a little and used the filling recipe in a cobbler. I used all of the ingredients exactly as written except honey as I didn't have any. I used light corn syrup instead, but will absolutely try it again with the honey. I skipped the refrigeration step and poured it from the saucepan directly into a glass 9" x 13" baking dish. I then topped it with 12 biscuits ("J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits" from this site with the sugar increased to 1/4 cup). It was delicious!

Soooo good. I make this for friends and family birthdays and gatherings. Always been a big hit. I use frozen peaches instead of fresh because I make all year long.

This was great.  The peaches we picked this year were severly lacking in flavor and we thought they were going to be a total loss, but this recipe made the best of the peaches and I think that the peach snapps gave them the flavor they were missing.  We couldn't stop eating this!

Very good recipe!  I didn't have fresh peaches so I used canned.  I also didn't have any peach schnapps so I used some of the juice from one of the cans of peaches.  Because I used canned peaches the mixture was still a little soupy so I added about a tsp of minute tapioca just to help it thicken up a bit.  I had company over and they said it was a very tasty peach pie!  Will definitely make again.

Great except it doesn't stay together well because its runny. I want to make again but I will probably add cornstarch to thicken it.

I followed the ingredient list (except subbed corn starch for flour and only had 5 peaches), but did not pre-cook the peaches nor did I bake it at 425 degrees.  Made my own crust and baked it at 350 degrees for 55 minutes (I'm at altitude so it took a bit longer).  I've gotten rave reviews and the peaches were cooked to perfection. (Used 1 tblsp. + 1 tsp. corn starch).

Doing the filling this way is GREAT. I get a wonderful consistency of from the fruit surrounded in a syrup goodness created from the honey. The schnapps does add a noticeable character to the pie. I've used this on other types of fruit pie, and it always turns out tasty.

Made the Peach mixture the day before. I did like other reviews and added a little more corn starch to the syrup. I would reduce the sugar next time. Waited until it was completely cooled. Had a piece, wonderful!...  It is a keeper. Will make up some more of the peaches and syrup and freeze, so in winter we can have another. Thanks for sharing.

Best peach pie I've ever had. I substituted corn syrup for the schnapps. Worked great!

This was good, but with the ingredients called for I kind of hoped it would be a bit more different and interesting. It tasted just like every other plain peach pie I've made, couldn't tell there was honey and schnapps in it. But, it was still tasty and we enjoyed it. It was quite runny though, like the other reviewers said. I have to say as well that I followed the ingredients but not the method. I couldn't bring myself to cook the peaches for 20 minutes on the stove and then bake for 45 minutes. I can't see how they'd be anything but complete mush. I did have the intent to cook the syrup without the peaches, but laziness prevailed, and I ended up just tossing everything (cornstarch instead of flour) with the peaches in a bowl and dumping in the crust.

Made this for July 4. I added an extra peach but followed the recipe for the remaining ingredients. I used organic honey. This pie is amazing  and I will be making it again very soon!
