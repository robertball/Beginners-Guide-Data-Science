Wow! These are incredibly delicious (just be sure to keep them away from the kids). I made these for a birthday bbq last weekend and my guests went absolutely crazy for them. They take a bit of time to prepare and freeze, so be sure to give yourself a day or so ahead of time if you are going to make these for a party.
