I made these for a wing cook-off and they were a huge hit! The flavor is fantastic. We transferred them to a crock pot and poured some garlic butter over them to give them a little more garlic flavor. DON'T DUMP OUT THE BROTH! Julie K, I saved the broth the wings were parboiled in and added some chopped leftover chicken (2 breasts, 4 thighs), 1c. chopped celery and 1c. chopped carrots to it. It was a little salty, so I added about 2 1/2 cups water (to taste), boiled it until the veggies were tender (30 min?) and ladled it over rice. Makes an awesome soup!

I made these wings for a wing cook-off on Super Bowl Sunday.  I won first place (and $100).  So, although they were all eaten before I got a chance to try them, they must have been great.  I mixed the par-boil ingredients early that morning and used fresh herbs (just cuz I happened to have them).  I liked the par-boiling so I didn't have to worry too much about the timing of the baking step.

OMFG these wings might be the best wings i've ever had.. and that's truly saying something b/c i'm a huge fan of all types of wings.. i am completely blown away.. i cant remember the last time i was this impressed by any dish.. i was even lazy about the end topping.. i just mish-mashed all the dry ingredients and the garlic (i used my garlic press) with the oil and pressed the wings into the mixture.. truly perfect.. ty so much for this recipe

My first time ever making wings... I'm not a big fan of BBQ. I loved these! couldn't stop eating them. They are nice and spicy but not so much as to hide the excellent flavor. I would never guessed they were baked if I hadn't done it myself.
    I shook them in a gallon sealed bag to coat them, I thought it was easier.

My fiancé is obsessed with wings. He wants to go out for them about once a week. After eating these he said he would never have to go out for wings again. They are absolutely incredible and was easier than I expected them to be. Will definitely be making these again in the near future

These were REALLY good!! I didn't use the bread crumbs--I also didn't have fresh garlic, so I used the equivalent amount of granulated garlic for the recipe.(Tone's granulated garlic from Sam's club) I dipped them in the oil containing the pepper flakes (didn't use the black pepper), and then shook them in the bowl containing the parmesan and granulated garlic. Baked them on convection oven setting for 20 minutes at 425. They turned out golden, spicy and delicious. Great recipe!

These were excellent!!! I par broiled and let cool the night before then stuck them in fridge overnight still in par broil recipe.  I took them out of that then let them dry the next morning prepared as recipe states then put them in a crockpot on warm to serve at a Sunday football party.  Everyone raved about them and wanted the     recipe.

We did NOT "tweak" this recipe at all and it was DELICIOUS! Nothing was changed and my husband and I absolutely loved it. We will be making this recipe again and again as we had been looking for a great oven-baked wing recipe and this is it! Thank you so much, Chef John. It is an easy recipe yet full of flavor. It's a keeper!

We like the parboiling technique because it gives the wings a nice flavor. Have made these twice and they turned out great both times.

I've made these a few times already - the first time for a Super Bowl party (a bit risky trying out a new recipe on a whole slew of non-family members, but I don't mind living on the edge sometimes). I made half with the garlic parm ingredients Chef John describes, and the other half buffalo'd for the husband's special "how 'bout making some buffalo wings, too" request). They all came out DE-E-LICIOUS! The parboiling ingredients were a good base for the buffalo wings, too. We're having a cookout today, and I've just finished the parboiling process on another batch. I'm going to have hubby grill 'em up for me, instead of baking them. Thank you for the recipe and the 800th video, Chef John! :)

Although I get most of my recipes from this site, I have never left a review...these are to die for!!! Made a double batch for my 13 year old, husband and I... a couple neighborhood boys tried them and they are gone!! Superb! Served with homemade potato salad, celery & blue cheese dressing...yum!! I saved the parboil juice for next time. Thank you so much for an awesome recipe,

These were a huge hit at my party! I made them exactly according the recipe, and they were delicious. Served them with ranch dip. Next time, I might add a little more red pepper flakes and maybe even a little more garlic.

I've made this recipe twice in one week and its so freaking good!!!! Each time I par-boiled and let it sit for a few hours to soak in all the flavor. This is better than any wings I've ordered in a restaurant and my husband agrees.

I just made these tonight and they are FANTASTIC!  They are so crispy!  I didn't have time to let them "dry" and they still were super crispy.  I am definitely going to make them again.  The only thing I need to come up with is a complimentary dipping sauce.  That would be super!  If anyone has a suggestion, please post!

Great recipe, thank you for sharing!  By personal preference, we left the red pepper flakes out and they were terrific.  Am sure the spicy addition would be great for those who like heat.  Crispy without being greasy - a nice feature of a very good recipe.  I also parboiled early in the day and finished everything but the baking ahead of time.  Next time I'll bake them much earlier, too; they kept well on "warm" in our buffet-style slow cooker.

A bit of work, but crispy and delicious! I just used 1 heaping tsp of red pepper flakes, and turned halfway thru cooking (a must), but otherwise followed recipe to a tee, even crushing Panko bread crumbs to "fine".  Might turn on broiler at the end next time for a little extra crispiness. :)

Best wings I have ever made - definitely some of the best I have ever eaten!  I have made a lot of wings recipes for my sports loving man and I... Most of the time the cooking method just doesn't produce crispy, rendered skin (roasting the wings in the oven at 400 or so).  Chef John convinced me to try against the his recipe and I was pleasantly surprised by how crispy and flavorful the wings were!  Did not change a thing to this recipe.  I will definitely make this again... What is nice is that you can prep in advance by boiling the wings, and then cooking them up when you are ready to serve.  I am going to try this cooking method again with traditional buffalo wings (just salt in the water, maybe some garlic or cayenne also) and maybe a Jamaican style with mango habanero sauce... I am so stoked on this recipe and you will be too!  A must try for wing lovers :)

The wings were a huge hit and were extremely easy to pick up and eat.  I have never believed in par boiling but this definitely worked. 

The flavor cooked all the way through the chicken and while baking, you don't have to turn them over!  I assume the oil spray on the pan is what provides that great crust. 

Will do it again the next time I make chicken wings!!

I followed the recipe exactly. The wings were juicy and tender on the inside with a nice crispness on the outside!  The seasonings gave the wings great flavor with a perfect bit of heat, just enough to know it's there. But the stars of this recipe shine through, filling the kitchen with the amazing richness of garlic and Parmesan.  These are perfect for a football Sunday afternoon.

Soooo awesome! I didn't have rosemary so I didn't  use it.  I didnt have Balsamic Vingerette so I substituted  it with Italian dressing.  I simply forgot to add the bay leaf.  But, it didn't matter. My wings were sooooo de-lish! Better than I anticipated.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

The wings were so moist and flavorful.  The result was worth every extra step.  Made these for football sunday so I had a little more time to make sure I followed the recipe to a T.  They smelled delicious before they hit the oven.

These are incredible.  I've made them three times, making a larger batch each time.  We eat them as is, or with bleu cheese.

Amazing. Easy and soooo delicious! We couldn't stop eating them. I enjoyed dipping them in ranch dressing to offset the spiciness. Definitely a keeper worthy of superbowl status!

I really like this recipe, the wings were delicious! I plan to make them again but this time I will use only 1 tsp of pepper flakes for they were a little too spicy for me, but not for my husband :) I also thought the wings were a bit soggy so next time I will let them dry for more than 15 minutes.  This is also my first review and my first "saved" recipe.  Thanks!

We had a "wing fling" night with all types of different wings and sauces and these didn't last.  Everyone loved them!  Very easy to follow recipe.  One of my sons who cooks nothing helped make them.  The second time I made them, I didn't want to mash the garlic, so we used 4 tablespoons of granulated garlic powder.  Still awesome!  Oh yeah, I saved the brine to use again.

These are good. And relatively easy and fast! I would say instead of mincing then mortar/pestling the garlic, simply microplane it... you'll get a similar result and faster, in my opinion :) I don't THINK it would affect the outcome. :)

Also - has anyone come up with a use for all the leftover "broth" created by the parboil? Or just chuck it?

I prefer my wings more saucy, but everyone loved them. The second time I made it, I used chicken thighs and legs. I also do not have a mortar and pestle so I added my olive oil, garlic and salt to a bowl and used my blending wand to mix. Worked great. The chicken was phenomenal!

These wings were awesome!  I don't normally leave reviews, but I had to on this recipe!  I followed the recipe as written.  The hardest part was cutting the chicken wings (removing the tip then separating the flat from the drummette).  Absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make these again.

Pretty good. I stuck them under the broiler for about 3 minutes after following the directions just to get a little extra crunch.  I wasn't thrilled at first with the result but they definitely grew on me and by the time dinner was over, I was sold.  These are quite good.

These are SO easy to make, however there is WAYYYYYYY too much pepper.  I really enjoyed them but my son and husband are not fans (even though my husband ate like 10 or 12 of them)  they both thought the spice was way too much and would have likes more of a parmesan flavor.

I fully expected this to be a waste of time given how easy it is to buy cooked wings at grocery store. Even my husband said so...until he tasted them!  They are so awesome and were a big hit  with my teenagers too.  Soooo good!

I just made these tonight and I have to agree; cooking them partially in a seasoned liquid gives these wings SO much flavor. I absolutely loved them and I am extremely picky! My husband and kids loved them!! I am definitely making these again with NO changes bc it doesn't need any!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I needed a new wing recipe and this was great.  I thought it was going to be complicated or over involved to have to boil first and then put the seasoning on.  Well, it was simple and delicious. I wouldn't change a thing.

I added extra breadcrumbs for a crunchier outside and I used less than a cup of salt and the mouths that I feed had nothing but thumbs up for it. Great Recipe.

After reading all the good reviews, I couldn't wait to make these!! I was a little disappointed with the wings tho. I followed the recipe and made no adjustments. One thing that should be noted is to turn the wings while they are in the oven. Mine ended up charred on the bottom. They had good flavor but were dry. Only cooked them in the oven for 20 minutes. I would suggest making a little extra sauce to put on after.

Really the best flavor.  Watch them though the cheese will burn if your oven runs a little hot.

These are a nice change of pace from the regular buffalo wings or teriyaki.  My mouth was watering as I made them.  I followed the recipe exactly, because I figured with Chef John, how could you go wrong?  The only thing I would change in hindsight is to cut back on the black and red pepper.  They were a little too spicy for my husband and my taste.  Also, it seemed the heat kind of overpowered the garlic and parmesan.  I would definitely make them again.  They're a keeper!

It was very good, and the red pepper flakes gave it a nice kick. It was my first time parboiling and I'm happy I did it because after baking it, it was super tender and falling off the bone when eating. Only con is next time use more cheese because it gave off a real mild taste.

Outstanding flavor.  Made these for a Super Bowl party recently and they were gone before the brisket and ribs.  People raved.  Nice work!

Awesome! We didn't know we were going to use this recipe until the last minute.  We had 8 pounds of wings sitting in a brine.  We did par-boil in plain water, because of the brine.

We used a lot of extra garlic (we love garlic) in the sauce and skipped the red pepper flakes.

We will make them again.

Amazing recipe! Great flavor and easy to make. I loved that they are not fried but taste like they are! Definitely would recommend. My husband's new favorite dish.

These wings are out of this world!  I love the par-cooking technique, that step made them so juicy and full of flavor.  The bread crumbs and parm combined for a wonderful crunch in the oven.
Thank you John for a hit recipe and please post a recipe for dipping sauce to go with these! You have a fan in NOCO!

These had a great flavor. Not sure I would go through the parboiling stage again. I don't think it added that much to the recipe. Overall a pretty easy recipe to follow!

This is a phenomenal recipe!  I will say I don’t want to be one of those people that alter a recipe then tell you how great it was but ultimately I made a whole new recipe, but I did change a couple of ingredients to make it work for my diet... doing the keto thing and instead of using breadcrumbs I used crushed pork rinds and I substituted the balsamic vinaigrette for whiten wine just because it’s all I had.... but omg, the crunch and taste was amazing... my whole family couldn’t get enough and we all said it was the best wing recipe ever.   I took other reviewers suggestions and kept the broth to make a soup... I threw ground browned turkey breast, tossed in some raw broccoli and cauliflower along with diced onion and shredded carrot and let it boil for about 15 minutes and added a brick of cream cheese and 1/2 c heavy whipping cream and 1/2c Parmesan and it made the best keto soup recipe to go with the wings... I’ll never make wings any other way from here on out.... great job

Made them for the 2020 Super Bowl as I considered them fitting for a party with the 49ers playing given Chef John's work and life in San Francisco :).
I must say the wings turned out great. Crispy, tasty, just perfect. Even the people who don't like wings had to try them and liked them, so that recipe/technique was quite the success :)

These were very good but I boiled them at a full rolling boil for 15 minutes and I believe simmer is what I should’ve done.   Will definitely make them again!

Friends and family loved these. I found it was good to use 1/2 cup of Kraft Shredded Parmesan Cheese to coat the wings and Panko Bread crumbs and then shred fresh Parmesean cheese over the wings before baking... “best They Ever Had!”

We made this for New Years Eve. I wish we would’ve made more! They were gone in minutes. We used extra garlic and cheese and left out the spicy red pepper. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

These wings rock!! The only thing I changed was I cooked them in my new Christmas air fryer (thanks Jess).  I followed the directions on my air fryer for cooking wings, perfect!  Balsamic vinegar, very clever.  Another review mentioned using the brine as a soup, again very clever!

Chef John does it again! I love that his recipes include great basic cooking tips. No need to adjust anything, these are fabulous..the red peppe has some heat, but it nicely countered by the creamy Italian used as a dip!

Wow! What a hit!  I made these for dinner last night and served them on a simple bed of spinach/arugula with  a side of creamy Caesar dressing!  My family devoured them! I loved the way the parmesan cheese crusted with the garlic and pepper flakes to form a crunchy coating!

This is a real surprise to the pallet, I had no idea boiling the wings prior with spices would infuse so much flavor. The garlic paste with the parm does not over power, but rather like caramelized onions changes the flavor during baking to a rich crunchy crust that only hints at the garlic while leaving plenty of room for the aromatics to come forward. 
I subbed salad cracker crumbs for bread crumbs and left out the salt entirely, between the crackers and the parmesan cheese I didn't miss it in the slightest.

Wow, great wings!  I made these as instructed but did not use the bread crumbs [for a low-carb diet] and i also used grated Parmesan because it's what I had in the frig.   You won't miss the crumbs or the fresh parm; trust me!   I was afraid the balsamic vinegar would throw off the flavor but, chef John nailed the ingredients!  They're a little bit more work, but they cook up like they just came out of a fryer.   I also went with a blu cheese dressing for a dip which I prefer; a great pairing for me.  Will definitely make again!

As good as you’ll find anywhere!  I found 450° for 20 minutes to be a tad high because it blackened the edges of the cheese — and I was anticipating some nice cheese crispiness.  I think next time I’ll bake at 425° for 20 minutes.  And there WILL be a next time!  As another reviewer suggested, I saved the broth, simmered it with celery and carrots.  Haven’t decided if I’ll make chicken rice soup or use the broth as stock for other chicken dishes, but it’s too good to waste.  I’ve got two quart bags of it in my freezer.

Got a compliment from a complete stranger (at a potluck) who said they were the best ever. I didn't have a muddler, and I worked really hard to mince and smash the garlic, but I couldn't get it as spreadable as it would have been with a muddler. So, the flavor was a little uneven. Nevertheless, wings were moist and delicious. Reheated nicely. I used Trader Joe's Ceasar Dressing which really did compliment the flavor.

Didn’t have enough red pepper flakes so used what we had. Plenty spicy. We won’t use the full amount for future.

This last time I made it MINUS the breadcrumbs so that someone who has a big wheat allergy could enjoy them too!  I can’t tell the difference!  I am now his new best friend.

Excellent!  I made them the first time thinking I would save half and we ate them all.  Now, I will do the parboil step and then portion them for baking later.

I am a new cook, but was a little ambitious with this recipe, hah. It took me 3 hours all together (oops). Then, being the idiot I am, I didn't realize the red pepper flakes were going to make it so spicy. So after spending my night making them, I can't eat them, but the people who like spicy food really like them so it's still a good recipe!

These  wings were amazing did not change a thing.  Doubled the recipe, took them to a party and they disappeared. Boiling the wings makes a big difference, nice and crispy.

I'm not sure what Chef John has against the micro-plane.  Maybe my mortar & pestle skills aren't up to snuff. My advice is to use a micro-plane for the garlic. These wings were very good. I would totally do these again. I followed the recipe and can't think of anything else that would improve it.

The wings were delicious! I didn't use as much cheese, but they were still very good.  I also cooked them about 5 minutes longer in the oven because I like them "falling off the bone."

These are absolutely dreamy.  I am not a huge wing person, but these were so delicious.  They were tender and the garlic parmesan flavor was so good makes you want to beat the person next to you, trying to get the last wing from you, good!!!

These were the best no fry wings I've ever attempted from this site. I think the parboil was so important to remove excess grease, giving the wings a chance to slightly crisp up - I say "slightly" because after they came out of the oven, I flipped them in some buffalo sauce......because I LOVE buffalo wings. I added my garlic cloves in during the parboil and didn't use any extra salt. We'll have them more often, but probably next time I'll cut back on the rosemary a little bit from personal preference.

Thank you CJ, this was an awesome recipe for chicken and the broth generated from the boil will come in handy for later use. The only changes made was broil the last 5 minutes and used thighs along with the wings, and used the bread crumbs to smother the rice and veggies. The family devour dinner this will be definitely made again and again!

Another huge hit from Chef John! Hubby, who is a wing fan, declared these some of the best ever and please make them often.
after a few tries, just minor changes- I used drumsticks (total accident first time searching on wrong thing, but turned out great). Boil for 20-25 minutes instead, depending on size.   Put whole garlic in boiling water rather than paste as a time saver.  cooked as recommended, just add 5-10 minutes at broil for the crispy skin and full cook.  
Served with dipping sauce, but everyone agreed salt, pepper and hot sauce of choice tableside was all that was needed.
Also note - I put on parchment paper rather than foil, beware the temp and turn on your fan.  The smoke alarm *may* have gone off, but didn't affect the goodness!!
Chef John, you are my hero!!

The bomb. A more dry rub approach, not like the creamy coatings at the wing places.

Chef John you never fail me. I look for your recipes first! There is nothing I would change about this recipe and I like lots of flavor!  If done right they are perfectly crispy! The parboil step helps this but also provides tons of flavor so don’t skip it! I also use frozen wings that come in a 4lb bag...no need to defrost!

Made these with my 9 year old. Cut back a little on the red pepper, but other than that by the recipe. She loved them and my wife even ate some. It’s time consuming but worth it.

This is first time I have ever made chicken wings and this recipe exceeded my expectations! I used full wings and drumsticks, followed the recipe and they turned out delish! Garlic parm wings are my fav and this was a spicy new take on them for me. The perfect amount of heat, while still letting the title flavors shine. Made it last night for a friend, and it was so good I'm making it again tonight for my boyfriend.  Also trying out Chef John's Creamy Italian Dressing to go with it. Can't wait! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I will definitely make it again! I would add a bit more spice. I added 3 chopped Thai chili peppers to the water, it wasn't quite enough. There weren't any leftovers.

Officially now our favorite wing recipe! Used my Instant Pot for the par boil, reducing the water to 1 1/2 c. but keeping the other ingredients the same. Pressure cooked the wings for about 7 minutes, drained for about 10, then tossed. 

Keeping the par boil broth to freeze for future wing adventures!

For the garlic-parm mixture, I used minced organic garlic in the squeeze tube and the shaker parm in the green can. The breadcrumbs were skipped totally since the sharker parm did double duty (and we’re on a low carb diet - bread is a no go). Coated everything thoroughly tossing by hand, then browned under the broiler. 

Every bite was fabulous. Thanks for another 5* recipe, Chef John! Your Mother *should* be proud!

I give this 5 it was easy to make and taste delicious my only change was I used Italian bread crumbs because that's what I had which I felt gave the wings more flavor .I also used Sage in the stock because I didn't have rosemary I used Garlic Power instead of fresh which I added to the bread crumbs but I followed the recipe and it came out great I will make again thanks

Followed the directions almost to the letter (passed on the rosemary, used garlic salt instead of separate garlic and salt, and added some pesto); also made some boneless chicken wings out of chicken breasts, and used organic chicken. 3 teenagers devoured all of it within 15 minutes of completion! Looks like I'll have do double the ingredients next time...

Yes I made a couple of changes and I will make it again.
1. Instead of measuring out the rosemary, thyme and oregano and red pepper flakes. Use italian seasoning. It contains the same ingredients. I used 3 tablespoons.
2. Next time instead of spending 20 minutes wearing out my hands using a mortar and pestle to crush 8 cloves of garlic into a paste I will use 3 tablespoons of garlic powder.
3. If you don't have any balsamic vinegar handy but do have some balsamic vinegarette salad dressing use it. The oil in the salad dressing didn't seem to make any difference and you have to add olive oil anyway.

Tried this for Fourth of July barbq this weekend, HUGE crow pleaser.  I added last minute so I used what I had and end up using grated parm not the good reggiano freshly grated, but decent quality, and fresh thyme because I had it and  didn't have the dry. Also hit them with a fresh squeeze of lemon when they came out the over which I think really enhanced the other flavors.  Absolutely making these again!

Didn't change anything except for using a piece of fresh bread that I ground in the food processor for crumbs. Absolutely delicious! Hubs raved about it & dipped his in some Greek yogurt ranch dressing. Definitely will make again!

Boy were these A LOT of work, but so worth it. I admit I tossed the garlic (finely chopped) and oil with the parboiled wings and then added the rest and tossed. Turned halfway through cooking for even browning. Delicious! Spices can be adjusted to taste. Thank you for a great recipe!

Very easy! The house  smelled so good! Some of the kids were just standing over the trash can pulling the bone right out and reaching over to the dip on the counter. (We used Ranch dressing and I did NOT add pepper flakes,  just a couple of dashes of chili powder)  The kids didn't even make a plate they were eating it right from the serving dish!  They were gone quite quickly! This is how we will be making our wings from now on!   We served this with a veggie tray and a fruit tray ?

I will make it again. The only changes I made was less red pepper flakes and baked it too long. I will follow exactly the recipe next time as it needed the extra spice!  That'll teach me for tweaking a perfect recipe!

I LOVE this recipe.  I've made it several times and it's always wonderful.  The wings are perfectly cooked:  not too wet or dry, and the seasoning is spot on perfect.  This last time I did half with the garlic parm and the other half with buffalo sauce for my husband.  These are a bit spicy for kids, so be aware of that and cut the pepper way back if no one is a fan of heat.  For low carb, I just leave out the bread crumbs.  They add crunch but doing without them doesn't take away from the flavor.

I made this tonight for my family and they LOVED it!  It was too spicy for me, only because ketchup is spicy for me - my family loves spicy! Next time, I will pull a few wings aside for me before adding to the red pepper mixture and adjust it for my taste.  

I love Chef John's recipes and videos! Keep 'em coming!!

These wings are really easy to make and the best part is that you can make a big batch all at once. No standing over the deep fryer cooking wings for an hour or two when you have a large crowd to feed. 

The wings come out perfectly seasoned and have a nice crispy coating.

made for extended family.  Everyone loved it even the people who I didn't think actually like chicken wings!  They took longer to cook than I thought but it was mainly that it took an extremely long time for the liquid to boil.

I took these wings to a party last night and everyone LOVED them!! I parboiled them earlier in the day and then refrigerated them until I was ready to assemble and cook them just before serving. I think the garlic/oil mixture would gave adhered to the wings better if the wings had not been so cold. Next time I will either do the whole preparation at the same time or bring the parboiled wings to at least room temperature before proceeding. They were still delicious!!

I prepared as an appetizer and they quickly disappeared. I used more of the herbs in the balsamic water than the recipe actually called for because I love spices. I boiled the chicken the day before which was a time saver for me. I also used shaved Parmesan which is what I had on hand at the time.  I used panko crumbs mixed with fine bread crumbs. I will definitely make the dish again.

Absolutely fantastic. I followed just as listed and could NOT believe how delicious these are. Took them to a party and non wing fans raved about them. The next day my husband asked to have them again.

I have made this twice. Amazingly good. And I don't even like chicken wings that much. They have to be crispy and not soggy for my liking. The first time I made it, I followed directions to a "T". Awesome. My husband is a big wing fan, and he loves ranch flavored wings. We travel 20 miles to get his favorite "Wild West" ranch flavored wings from a local well known wing restaurant. So, the next time I made these wings, the only thing I changed was that I omitted the Parmesan cheese. I still used the bread crumbs, and mixed in ranch dressing mix in (1 packet). Tossed the wings in that, baked as recipe stated. Freaking Awesome. We dip ours in a little blue cheese dressing. Nummy both ways. Can't wait to serve these to company or a "chicken wing-off".

So good! I added double the breadcrumbs to make it more 'crusty' and would halve the red pepper in future, but it's still delicious as written

My children loved these wings.  I added an extra cup of bread crumbs and 4 tablespoons of Olive Oil.  Kids used Ranch Dressing and said the only thing different would have been even more bread crumbs.  Either way - definitely making these again.

This is a great recipe kept trying different wing recipes hate the mess with frying but this recipe does give you crispy wings.  Some I sprinkled with salt and vinegar seasoning some tossed with buffalo sauce before baking the possibilities are endless.  The seasoning in the parboil is perfect for any wings.

These are always a big hit, but takes a lot of time to complete right before a party.  I haven't tried preparing them a head of time yet.  I do like using the broth to make a soup, so I tend to use this recipe more in the winter.

This is a great recipe! I've used the method (parboil then broil) for wings, drumsticks, and chicken thighs. I save the broth for rice, stock. etc. It is a winner all the way around.

Made these for the superbowl, and they were a hit. Tasted like they were deep fried, but so much healthier. They were a tad time consuming though. I will make again.

Tried this tonight and it was very good.  A lot of trouble but next time I'll do it in stages.  Truly didn't taste baked!

Turned out great! I don't have a mortar and pestle so I used my acrylic press.  And I used gluten free chips instead of bread crumbs. Worked really well!

Made these tonight. Perfect, perfect in every way! Full of flavor, super crispy, easy to make, and you can make a pan of them ahead, put them in the frig, and pop them into the oven just 25 minutes before the crowd shows up. I deep fry a great deal but I will definitely leaving the fryer in the cabinet a little more so we can have these crispy wings instead. They're that good. Dipped them in ranch dressing. Made the recipe exactly as written.

SO GOOD! I'm sure to make these again & again! 
I'm really picky with wings; they have to be cooked thoroughly...loved the parboiling method.

My husband, who HATES chicken wings, was disappointed when we ran out last night (because he wanted more). I was also repeatedly dinged as to when I was cooking these again. This is a WINNER!
