I made this recipe with my sister one day for fun and they were excellent!  They tasted just like the Almond Joy candybars.  It took a while for the chocolate on the top to set; however, a half hour or so in the fridge seemed to do the trick.

OK....so I just ate one of these and WOW!! I love them...they are supposed to be for tomorrow for Fathers Day, but I couldn't resist. They taste just like Almond Joy bars! I used the 4c. of coconut, increased the Karo syrup to 1/3c. and added 1tsp. of coconut ext. to that mixture. I used Hershey's semi-sweet chips, (may try dark chips next time) and only 1 tblspn. of shortening (which I thought was more than enough).  I also did wizz the coconut through my food processor for a few seconds for a finer texture as another reviewer suggested. They were easy to roll and form into little mounds. I did freeze them for about 30 minutes and re-formed them so I didnt have any coconut pieces hanging. Delicious! Will definately make again!

I loved these and they were so easy to make!  I had a little bit of trouble with the coconut mixture sticking to my hands so I rubbed a little bit of crisco between them and that did the trick.  I also chilled the coconut balls it the freezer after the 2nd time I rolled them because I wanted to dip them in the chocolate and I was worried they might fall apart.  Worked like a charm!  Great recipe!

I increased the corn syrup since the coconut mixture looked too dry to form into balls.  Once I started rolling them up, I realized it probably wasn't necessary.  As for the finished product, I thought there wasn't enough coconut flavor.  If I make these again, I'll probably add some coconut extract.

Okay, here's a brief breakdown of my tips on this recipe:

1)  Use shredded coconut instead of flaked.  I don't know if you can put flaked coconut in the blender or food processor to grind it up but if you can, do it.

2)  I used 8oz of corn syrup (half a 16 oz bottle) for this amount of coconut.  I also didn't bother cooking the corn syrup, I just drizzled it into the mixer bowl of coconut while the mixer was running.  

3)  Don't make them too big.  

4)  I toasted my almonds.

5)  Chill the coconut balls before dipping in chocolate

6)  To dip them in chocolate, I used two forks.  I dropped them into the chocolate upside-down, then used the two forks to pick up the candy, turn it over to make sure the sides were coated, then I raised the candy up tilted slightly to the side to drain off the excess without compromising a smooth texture on the top.  Then I placed them on a parchment-lined baking sheet to harden.  

7)  After the chocolate dip has hardened, DO IT AGAIN.  Once is really not enough to get a good thick chocolate shell.

8)  Oh, almost forgot-- I didn't bother with the shortening.  Pure chocolate was all I needed-- these do NOT last long.  

They really do taste just like the candy bar.  AWESOMENESS!!!

After you pour in the hot corn syrup, let it set a little bit to cool.  The coconut will hold its shape better.  If you find it doesn't hold together, wait a little longer.  Firm the balls up in the freezer, and use a fork to dip them in the chocolate.  I used butter instead of shortening, and I used 1/2 cup in the chocolate to get a runnier consistency, it made dipping much easier.

These were very yummy!  I thought I would try to roll the coconut/corn syrup mixture into a log and try cutting them after taking them out of the freezer.  I ended up just rolling them into balls anyway! It's the only way to do it.  I do recommend sticking the coconut mixture in the freezer for a bit tho, it did help to keep it stiff.  I also added 1/3 cup corn syrup and a whole bag of coconut.  I dipped the balls and lifted them out with a fork. Just lay the almond on top right after you dip and they stay nicely. I put them in goodie bags, no problem with the almonds coming off.

These are as good if not better than Almond Joy. I rolled them into logs, and dipped them in tempered milk chocolate (I didn't use the shortening) and topped them with a whole almond. Everyone loved them!

These are delicious!! Only thing I did wrong was make them bigger than it said too - definently stick with the 1 tblsp. coconut, otherwise it makes for too much coconut even with more chocolate. I suppose if you flattened the coconut like Almond Joy bars are you could get away with it. They definently do taste like the real thing after I took some coconut out, lol!

I used extra dark chocolate chips and dry roasted almonds. I really didn't have much of an issue making these, though it did take me a while to get the hang of it. I took several other reviewers advice and stuck the little tablespoon portions in the freezer for a touch so that they'd be easier to work with, I think that was a step that should have been added to the directions. The coconut mixture was a pain to work with UNTIL I took them out of the freezer. I did press the almond into each "ball", then I covered it with chocolate, like one of those packaged candies. I found that if I used a fork to hold the candy and spooned the chocolate over the candy, it was a little easier.

Wow!!! These were much easier than I thought they'd be and look great in addition to being delicious! I made three batches in a row - the first one was a breeze, the second batch was some trouble and the third batch was almost impossible. My theory is that the coconut got progressivly dryer as it sat out. DO NOT LET THE COCONUT GET DRY!!!

Amazing.  Just like the "famous" candy bar.  Anyone who loves coconut will love these.  I made some with a whole almond, and some topped with slivered almonds.  Both were great!

These were very good, but I, too, made them too big. I also used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet just because I prefer the milk chocolate.  We shaped them like eggs for our Easter celebration.

I've always been bothered that Almond Joy candies, unlike Mounds, are made with milk chocolate, rather than dark.  With these, I was able to melt premium dark chocolate to coat them and have the best of both worlds!

I just made these a little while ago and they turned out pretty good. They're a bit grainy but that was my fault...I forgot to heat my corn syrup (with 2 6 year old girls running around I can't imagine why lol). They still taste awesome and turned out well otherwise. I did do a couple of other things differently (and successfully lol). I chopped my coconut in the food processor as well as my almonds and mixed them in with everything so I didn't have to worry about individually putting them on but still get the crunch & flavor. I also added a little coconut and almond extract for extra flavor and had to add a little more corn syrup since I added the nuts in the mix. I used a domed, silicone covered teaspoon and packed it and scooped it out with a spoon which eliminated the messy hands. After that, I dropped them in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes which made the 2nd rolling MUCH easier. I also used a double broiler and dipped them in the chocolate for better coverage and less mess. I'll try these again some other time when I can focus a lil better and hopefully make them correctly. Thanks for the recipe!! :)

These are good.  One tip to help with the stickiness when rolling the coconut into balls: rub a thin layer of shortening on your hands before you get started.

Very good and very easy recipe!  I made these for Easter and used crushed Jordan Almonds on top in place of the almond for a more colorful presentation.  I can't wait to make them again and possible used chopped almonds in the chocolate.  I had to add a bit more corn syrup to the coconut to get the eggs to shape better.  I also froze the coconut eggs for about 30 min. before dipping in the chocolate.  They tasted fabulous!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe delivers a delicious product, but plan on getting plenty messy when making the balls. Pouring the chocolate over the balls also does not allow for the ball to become fully covered, but if you don't mind the mess or the look of these little gems, the recipe is simple and delicious!

These were really good and tasted just like the almond joy bars I like. I made mine a little too big, so the coconut was a little too much, but that's the only thing I'll change for next time.

These are great.  They taste just like a Mounds or Almond Joy.  I made half of mine without almonds. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  Another poster mentioned needing to add coconut extract, but I thought this was plenty coconutty without it.  It's hard to form the coconut into balls the first time (I did pulse the flakes in my food processor a few times before mixing them in just to make the pieces smaller and less likely to stick out).  I sprayed my hands with Pam and that helped a little, but I worried that these would be a disaster.  The second rolling is key.  They were much tighter, well-formed balls after that.  I rolled them in the chocolate, but I recommend just putting them on wax paper instead of putting them on cooling racks.  The chocolate solidified around the wires and made the coconut balls hard to remove. EDITED TO ADD: Wow. I made these again today and it was a disaster. I did everything exactly as I had before, just as the recipe said. The balls would not stay together even after a third roll. No room in the freezer to firm them up. Once I got the chocolate on them they were still falling apart. They look terrible and I will not be putting these out for holiday guests. : (  Bummer! I don't know what happened.

These are really good!  I made them for my 8 yo, who just discovered his favorite candy bar is Almond Joy.  I made as directed but could not get the coconut mixture to hold together. I put the mixture in the freezer for 10 minutes and this did the trick.  Instead of spooning the chocolate over them, I dipped them right in the chocolate but had quite a bit left over when I was done.  I had 26 candies as the recipe stated so probably only half of the coating mixture was necessary.

These are very good candies-just like an Almond Joy that you buy at the store.  I only got 22 "logs" from this recipe, I was hoping it made more.  BEST REVIEWER RECOMMENDATION: Food process the coconut to make smaller flakes, and re-roll after placing balls in fridge.  Will definitely make again.

I used coconut oil instead of shortening to the chocolate which added more of a coconut taste (which I love!). Delish!

This candy is wonderful.  I used some tips and oiled my hands before trying to roll the coconut.  I also put the flakes in my blender and ground them to make them more "user friendly".  That worked well.  I used another readers tip and chilled them before trying to roll them again.  Priceless.  Before putting the chocolate on them I put the balls in my mini muffin pans. After adding the melted chocolate I chilled them again.  I then turned them over, added chocolate to the other side and put the almond on top.  They were oh so good.

These were great for our Holiday gift tins! After reading the other reviews, I put the coconut balls in the freezer for five minutes before re-rolling. I found that it was actually a little easier to squish the coconut into balls then roll them. I also let them dry completely then put an extra coat of chocolate on them, to make them a little prettier. They were great!

I have no idea how many stars to give this candy.   I loved the idea but.... lordy what a mess I had.  The coconut would NOT stick together after I poured the syrup over it.  I put them (messy) balls in the freezer and then rolled them again, but by the time I was ready to pour the chocolate over them....they'd begun to fall apart again.  Perhaps I should have read more review.   Sounded like a great idea but sure didn't work for me.  They taste good but were not 'gift able' which was what I'd hope to do.... add them to my Christmas cookie assortment that I give to friends and family.  I'll try again next Christmas.

I prepared this recipe as written and found that I needed more corn syrup to make the coconut stick together. I ended up using about 1/3 cup of corn syrup. Forming the coconut/corn syrup in to balls wasn't as easy as I anticipated I followed the directions for topping with chocolate. Next time, I will attempt to dip the candy in the chocolate to get better coverage.

There is something wrong here. The chocolate tasted funny to me with so much shortening. 1/4 a cup seems to be too much. I think 1 or 2 TBS would be plenty. Also the flaked coconut should be chopped up in a food processor and I think it could have used a bit more corn syrup. Maybe 2 more TBS would do the trick. "Rolling the coconut into balls" wouldn't be the phrase I would use it is more like squeezing the coconut into balls. My husband really liked them, I didn't. I might try again with the changes I think it needs.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it for work and got rave reviews.  The only modifications I made included setting the almond on top of the ball and then spooning the chocolate over it so it's more like the famous bar.  I also used milk chocolate as that's my preference and I added a few drops of almond extract flavoring.  Will make this again!

Yummy! All my guests liked them. I used a 14oz. bag of coconut, which was maybe a little more than 4 cups. I think I should have added a little more Karo syrup too because I found it difficult to keep the coconut in the ball shapes, even though I rolled them twice per the recipe. I made about 35 balls, keeping them small as other reviewers suggested. I used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet. The bottoms did not get chocolate coated as I expected when I poured the chocolate over the coconut (not too much candy experience here!), but it worked out fine--the balls lifted easily off the rack when they were set. It was a humid day, so they set up best after 30 minutes in the fridge. Just like mini Almond Joys.

Very easy and tasty!  Put them in little paper candy cups and they looked tres fancy!  Be sure not to make them too large, though.  I think the smaller the better (as long as they are large enough to put a whole almond on).

These are pretty delicious!  I made a double batch as Christmas gifts for the neighbors.  As others have suggested, the second rolling of the coconut balls is key, and I found that having wet hands helped with the process.  I used a bag and a half of chocolate chips to coat the balls.  I actually had better luck using the store brand chips - they seemed to melt into a runnier chocolate that coated the balls easier.  Probably due to the higher oil content or whatever.  I only had a few balls fall apart out of 55, so I would say this is a success.

These were good but a little dry. Next time I will add more corn syrup and also run the coconut through the food processor.  The coconut was just too coarse.  Also next time I will use milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  With these changes this recipe would definitely rate five stars.

These are very good and easy if you stick them in the freezer after dividing into 1 tablespoon quantities. I think next time I will divide into smaller quantities. I think there was a little too much coconut per chocolate ratio.

Taste just like the real thing (Almond Joys)!  Rolling the balls of coconut was sticky/icky but it didn't take long and the end results were very good. I made mine in small foil candy cup liners and they look terriffic.  Thanks for the recipe Saundra.

These taste really good, just like a bounty bar. I had to use more corn syrup to get the coconut to stick though, probably used 1/3 cup total. I also didn't use any shortening in the chocolate, I used 2 tablespoons of coconut oil instead.

Very good - but I agree with others before me; it needed more corn syrup.  I added extra but I think I could have still added more - almost double.  I pushed the almond into the middle of the balls and it turned out beautifully.  I will definately make these again - only with the extra corn syrup.

These were great! I put the cookie sheets with coconut balls in the freezer to help set up, they were SO easy to roll the 2nd time after being in the freezer, BUT the chocolate set up way fast when poured onto them being that cold. I will definately make these again!

The recipe was halved, but still made a lot. I ground the coconut, and added enough corn syrup to make it stick together.  I piled the coconut on the middle of wax paper, and formed it into a square about 8x8, and 1/2 inch thick. I froze the square, and then cut the square into bars, which were dunked into the chocolate, and had several almonds placed on each bar. This all was really easy. They are the perfect consistency when stored in the fridge. The hardest part is waiting for them to set!

These were okay. I halved the recipe, to make less, I got 16 balls out of it. I thought they tasted good, but the kids did not like the texture. They were a little grainy on the inside. Even though I did grind the coconut flakes as per other reviewers' advice, the filling was still not smooth enough. It never became nice and pasty like the storebought kind. For the glaze, I did not use shortening, because I prefer using natural butter. It was a bit stiff, so I added some warm whipping cream to it, and turned it into ganache, which worked perfectly for dipping the balls in it. I did chill the balls beforehand to make them stiffer.

Taste just like the famous brand.  I did put the almond on before I dipped it in chocolate.  It worked out great.  I did have to put them in the freezer before dipping into the chocolate.  Also, I let the chocolate cool just a bit.  Dipping leaves them perfect with chocolate all around and no little chocolate tails etc.  These were perfect.

Very easy to make. I added slivered almonds to the center by making an indent and then rolled mixture around it. Delicious!

I enjoyed this recipe A LOT!  I used a bit more corn syrup to make the coconut stick together better.  Thanks for the post!

Yummy!  Tastes like a Mounds candy!  It was a bit messy but well worth the effort...as in previous reviews-make them SMALL.  I did have trouble keeping the mix together but I will make a bigger effort...these will be wonderful for christmas candies...thanks for the recipe!
