This definitely is a very healthy hummus, but I must admit I still like garbanzo beans better.  If you have a food processor, I'd recommend you use it rather than a blender.  The drained garbanzos do not process well in the blender even after adding some of the reserved bean liquid...I switched to the FP.   OK, but not one of my favorites, but I definitely like the way this breaks down nutritionally, 5 stars for that.  Thanks for sharing htiz.

This recipe was a nice change from regular hummus.  The only thing I did differently was take out the tahini (we didn't have any) and swap it with equal amounts of additional olive oil with a bit more cumin.  This dip didn't last more than a day a half in my house!

This was a nice hummus. I was surprised at how soft the black beans got. Like anything, you'll need to adjust to your taste with more/less tahini, garlic, cumin, etc. I tried it with kalamata olives blended in as well.

I actually found this recipe in No Meat Athlete (by Matt Frazier). He gave the option of using 3tblsp of the reserved liquid from the canned bean instead of oil, so I followed that instruction. I have made this 3 times now. Such an easy, quick snack. 
The 1st black bean hummus recipe on this website adds cayenne, paprika & Greek olives to this recipe. I think I might try that next time. LOVE THIS RECIPE

Love it! Didn't really change too much except cutting it in half and adding more of the lemon juice and olive oil.  I love the change from the traditional chick peas.  I have tried white beans as well, but I really think this is my favorite, very creamy and just the right amount of spice for me.

I cooked black beans rather than using canned. While the recipe was a good base for my taste, I also added a jalepeno (diced), another Tbsp olive oil, about half Tbsp of tahini, and half a lemon (maybe 1.5 Tbsp).  With my recipe additions I'd give it a good 5 stars, but as it was, it was too bland. I've seen other recipes or other reviews mention kalamata olives and I bet that's delicious, but I didn't have any.

Definitely a recipe to keep handy. It hints of Tex-Mex and seems more a healthier version of refried beans than hummus. When my husband tasted it he asked where the fajitas were, so I broke out the tortillas and ended up smothering it in jalape√±os and served some salsa and guac on the side. I used Chef John's Tahini instead of regular and much more of it than 1 tsp. so yes, this is a very good recipe but I wouldn't consider it a replacement for traditional hummus. Thank you for the recipe.
