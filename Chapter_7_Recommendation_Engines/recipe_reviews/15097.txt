I never had a chance to find out how long these cookies were supposed to "set" on the cookie sheets because they all disappeared long before the 10 minutes were up!  A few substitutions I made because I was working with a pretty basic food supply:  2 2/3 cups chocolate chips is about a pound of semisweet chocolate; add 1/4 tsp baking soda to regular cocoa powder if you can't get "Dutch process"; if you use salted butter, reduce salt by 1/2 amount.  Do use parchment paper, but otherwise there is nothing tricky or difficult or fussy about these cookies.  I had requests for another batch before I had finished washing up from the first one!

Really great chocolate flavor. I'd been having trouble getting the right consistency in the finished cookie, though...I would end up having to throw out half the batch (never seem to set up). But the flavor is so awesome that I kept trying til I got it right. Definitely, the trick to these cookies is to let the dough sit at LEAST 45 minutes before scooping/baking. Now they're coming out perfect every time. Totally decadent cookie.

Terrific! For the first batch, I just scooped spoonfuls of dough onto a baking tray. Although they were tasty, they spread out until they were really thin, and almost overcooked. For the next 2 batches, I put the dough into a muffin pan, and out came perfectly round, thick cookies! Yum. I would definitely recommend this recipe , as well as the muffin pan. Thanks for the recipe!

I definitely think next time the coffee is being left out.  There was too much of a coffee flavor and I much prefer to have more chocolate flavor then coffee.  Other then that, 35-40 mins for setting seemed to work great for me.  A hint though.... do NOT put the mix in the refrigerator to have it set up faster.  It doesn't work and just turns the mix really hard.  :-)

This is a fantastic recipe! It comes from the Cooks Illustrated New Best Recipes cook book. For people who have had trouble with the recipe, I would recommend buying really good quality bittersweet chocolate (not semi-sweet). I used Lindt 70% cocoa bittersweet baking bars and valhrona cocoa powder. I also used finely ground espresso instead of instant coffee granules and it really heightened the flavor of the chocolate. This was definitely worth the work to make.

This cookie got rave reviews from all the chocolate lovers in my family. I have made them twice-some for home-most for a cookie exchange. Good quality chocolate is key to a great cookie. I used Ghiradelli bittersweet & added 1 cup of chocolate chips-semisweet one time and milk chocolate the other time. Dutch process cocoa is a must too.  Droste is the brand I use and it's got a great flavor. If you don't wait too long between melting the chocolate & adding it to the sugar mixture, the dough won't get too stiff when you mix in the flour. Once the dough is all mixed, letting it sit for half an hour will let the chocolate firm up and not be too difficult to roll into balls.

These are incredibly chocolately!  The dough is a little hard to handle, but if you actually follow the recipe and let it "set" for 35 minutes, it's much easier.  I got the crackley texture by rolling into balls as opposed to dropping from a spoon and I found 9 minutes in the oven was perfect timing.  They are dense and chewy like brownies with a subtle flavor of mocha from the coffee granules.  So good!!

Great recipe.  The first couple of batches I used a cookie scoop for the dough, but was not all that pleased with the finished product.  I decided to try rolling a batch into balls...and what a difference!  Great presentation...you end up with a cookie that is shiny and very elegant looking.  I strongly suggest the rolling.  Also, next time I will add some additional chocolate chunks or chips at the end for a teeny bit more chocolate.  Very yummy recipe...I'll add this one to my list of 'tried and true'!

These really are the ultimate chocolate cookies! The recipe can easily handle the addition of chocolate chips, walnuts, or even peanut butter chips. By the way, dutch processed cocoa can't really be substituted by adding baking soda to regular cocoa powder. It will do, but the taste is very different, which is why I keep both in my pantry.

we loved these cookies and the yummy brownie like consistency.  I made them a bit bigger than the recipe and just watch them so they don't burn.  With the first batch I thought they weren't done so I left them in longer.  the they burned!  So I realized the center will be pretty soft when you take them out!

Ok, I'm pretty speechless right now.  Actually it's because I'm stuffing my face with these Ultimate Double Chocolate Cookies.  I just got through baking these and they are out of this world.  I live in Seattle and one of Tom Douglas' restaurants, Dahlia Lounge (the bakery part,) has chocolate truffle cookies that I have eaten and loved for so long.  I have looked and looked for a recipe that is just as good and I think I've found it.  They are so decadent.  They only change I made was to throw in a handful of mini chocolate chips after I mixed the dough and before it sat for 30 minutes.  I wanted a little texture in there. They seem to be not fully baked when you remove them from the oven but after they sat for about 15 minutes they were perfect.  I used a cookie scoop so they were all the same size.  I baked them for exactly 11 minutes and that was just right. Since mine were slightly bigger than what was suggested - I only got 34 cookies out of it.  When I was mixing the flour/cocoa in by hand, it seemed like there was too much to mix in.  I mixed and mixed and it eventually was incorporated but it took awhile.  I usually am not a lover of dark chocolate but these are smooth and tasty and I am in love with them.  They would make a great gift for a chocolate loving friend.  It's kind of like eating a piece of fudge and brownie and cookie all at the same time.  I highly recommend them.

holy cacao beans, batman!! this recipe is all kinds of splendid!! i've tried both milk chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips for this recipe. i would definitely go with the semi-sweet. the flavor just works so much better. also to help the instant coffee granules to diffuse into the mix better, i recommend dissolving them in the vanilla in a small ingredient bowl and then adding the whole thing to the eggs. lastly, i've found that letting the dough chill in the fridge for a few hours lets everything come together and blends all of the flavors perfectly.
this recipe is outstanding!!

Like a few other reviewers, I added chocolate chips. It was a very tasty cookie. I also hand rolled the dough to make a more attractive cookie I only gave 4 stars because of it taking a little extra effort/difficulty than the average cookie. After adding the melted chocolate, I had trouble mixing in the dry ingredients. The melted chocolate cooled so fast it made the dough *very* stiff. I set the bowl in a sink with hot water and used my hand to mix. It was that stiff. Anyone else experience this?

For almost 10 years, I have followed this recipe as written.  I usually double the quantity.  The effort is worth it!  I use Trader Joe's Pound Plus chocolate bars.  Dark Chocolate is a huge favorite with family and friends.  Definitely a keeper in my recipe box!***One vital suggestion:  DO NOT CHILL the dough.  I did this once to "save time" and the dough was rock solid for half a day...made scooping almost impossible.  My oops! ;) ***

This was a really excellent cookie with rich chocolate flavor that reminded me of "candy bar" fudge cake or chocolate fudge ice cream.  It's a little more trouble than I'm used to, but it's not difficult to make.  My comments:  I used salted butter and omitted salt from the recipe, and that seemed to work fine.  I didn't have parchment paper, so I used cooking spray on metal cookie sheets and that seemed to work well, though be very careful not to overbake.  I only baked for 8 minutes and I think it should have been shorter.  I agree with the other reviewer who said to let the dough stand at least 45 minutes.  The last cookies I baked held their shape better than the first.

our family makes these a little different...meltyour chocolate chips and swirl it thru your white dough so you get a marbled effect...leave the coffee and the cocoa powder out....put on cookie sheet in a ball, dip the bottom of a glass in water then in sugar and flatten your cookie a little with it...gives it a sugar top, very pretty cookie when baked and tastes great too!!!

These are great.  I made them yesterday mainly for my boyfriend because he loves chocolate and they turned out really good and rich.  I halfed the recipe since its only 2 of us.  They were so gooey on the inside and nice and firm on the outside.  We couldnt eat that many so I put the rest in a baggy.  I ate one today and they are, in my opinion, even better!  I made these with just cheap store brand cocoa and chocolate chips.  I dont know why some people say you HAVE to make it with good quality chocolate because they turned out delicious with the cheap stuff.  I guess its just your preference.  I didnt have any problems with the dough at all and sat it in the fridge for 30 min to get more firm.  They were very easy to roll in balls afterwards.  This was an easy recipe and I will be making again!

Did not like the way the recipe was written 10 tbsp of butter who does that?  Whats wrong with using cups?  Also used 1 tsp of baking soda instead of powder I did not have powder and it also made the cookies less cake like.  After all was said and done the cookies came out nice, soft, crunchy around the edge and chewy not too chocolaty,  did not taste like a brownie.

excellent recipe! I was looking for something that had a mocha/hot chocolate flavor to it and this had all those elements. I bought a package of peppermint flavored bits that had the consistency and flavor of Andes. I cut the semi-sweet chocolate in half to give a more cake-like consistency, added the peppermint, and followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. These were amazing!

I didn't have dutch cocoa or unsalted butter, so I just used regular Hershey's cocoa and salted butter.  I halved the salt, but followed the directions on everything else.  The cookies came out great and my daughters were both asking for them before I even took them out of the oven!  While they were cooling, I sprinkled them with powdered sugar for a pretty presentation.  We all thought they tasted like brownies...YUM!

YUM!  I used gluten free all purpose flour, 1 cup Egg Beaters instead of eggs, & half the coffe because my coffe granules were not instant.  I also used the recommendation for the Dutch process cocoa sub.  I've never cooked with the Dutch stuff so the fam wouldn't know the diff.  Cookies were delicious & perfect!  Next time I will use the full amount of coffee granules & maybe add chocolate chips.

I made the mistake of using regular cocoa powder (the Hershey's cocoa powder) because I couldn't get my hands on anything else, and the cookies came out with a strange, sour aftertaste. The intense chocolate flavour and fudgy consistency were great, though, so I'm giving it 5 stars. I'm sure, if I'd used Dutch process cocoa, as the recipe called for, they would have come out perfectly.

I made a few changes based on what chocolate I had. I used dark chocolate chunks, and dark chocolate cocoa powder. I replaced butter with non-hydrogenated margarine. I only added about 1/2 a teaspoon of instant coffee. (I wanted to taste chocolate, not coffee.) For me the mixture setup after 15 minutes sitting out on the counter. I dropped the cookies by the spoon onto a cookie sheet and baked for 8 minutes. They were delicious! This recipe is a keeper!

i just tried one after it came out of the oven to rate this recipe and ended up eating 3! very good. i followed some others advice:used 2 2/3 cups semi-sweet choc chips, added 1/4 tsp to reg cocoa powder. did not use wax paper, let sit in fridge for 40 minutes.  definitely watch the time on these, 8 minutes was just perfect for me. i thought the consistency was perfect and not too brownie-like at all (although i love brownies). i might add some choc chips for texture next time and more coffee granules, i did not get an "espresso" taste from this cookie that i was looking for.

These are now my official favorite cookie to bake!  I halve the recipe and use a 12oz bag of chocolate chips, melting the asked for amount and stirring the remaining chips into the dough.  I've used milk chocolate too and that was a sweet variation.  I make these probably too frequently!  Mmmmm!  Update:  Even better with dried cherries stirred into the batter. YUM!

These cookies turned out really well, although I made them extra big and only got 27 out of the recipe.  They were very moist, but a bit cake like in the middle.  I guess that's because I made them so much larger (cooked them for 15min).  Still they were very tasty and everyone at work very much appreciated them .... though you could on eat one as they're so rich!

This is a great cookie for chocoholics.  It is also a very forgiving recipe.  I was in a huge rush and just threw the ingredients in without really measuring. (Although I did follow the order)  I didn't have quite enough chocolate so I added enough chocolate chips to make 1 pound. I added handfuls of walnuts and chocolate chips and since I did not have dutch process on hand I added baking soda.  I also started at the wrong temperature by mistake. They *still* turned out great and I will certainly make them again.  I can't wait to tasted them made the "right" way!

Whoa...yeah, definitely PMS cookies.  I did exactly like the recipe said, except I didn't have any coffee or espresso powder on hand.  The coffee probably would have added an interesting subtle note, but I sure as heck didn't really miss it because of all that chocolately goodness!  I used a combination of chocolate I had sitting around for the 1 lb. (Baker's semi-sweet and some morsels), but I made sure to use Wilbur Dutch Processed cocoa.  I made one huge mistake...I told my mom I'd make something she can take to work for a pot luck charity lunch, and it ended up being these.  *sigh*  Next batch is all mine.

On the mark with chocolatey-ness, but these turned out a bit more cake-like than I would have expected, esp. with flour/sugar ratio.

LOVE these!  I made them once a couple of years ago to share with co-workers, then forgot about them until today...  The last pan just went into the oven.  I always roll them into balls to bake, so they spread perfectly into a dense chewy cookie.  These are wonderful and very very rich.  I am so glad I found this recipe again.  Thank you for sharing it!  Happy Holidays

Taste-wise, pretty good. Didn't like the coffee flavor so will not use that again. But I was very disappointed and felt kind of tricked- this is a BROWNIES batter, no matter how you shape it. So if you like your brownies cookie-shaped, go ahead. But to me, these are not real cookies.

If it was only for me, I would give these 5 stars. However, most people who tried them thought they were too rich, and my mom said they tasted heavily the cocoa powder. To me, they were rich enough, and I loved their chewy, chocolaty, fudgey taste!

Wow...these are "knock your socks off, no messin around, take no prisoners" cookies!!!!...lol...These were truly awesome. 
I like to cook with natural sugars and things so I used whole wheat pastry flour and substituted rapidura sugar for the brown in the recipe and whole cane juice sugar for the white. I also used a 10 oz bag of organic semi-sweet chocolate chips in place of the pound of semi sweet chocolate chopped. I let the mixture settle for the 35 minutes suggested and then, the piece de resistance was I also added, just before baking, a bag of organic white chocolate chips. YUM! I think I actually saw a tear in my husbands eye after tasting one!...lol....Thanks Carol for a wonderful recipe...this one is a keeper for sure!

ummmmmmm..... yeah couldn't stop eating them. Amazing I was forbidden by my husband to ever make them again. HA! like that will ever happen. I used 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate and 2/3 cups special dark chocolate chips. Then I threw a couple not-melted dark chocolate chips in the finished batter before baking. We don't drink coffee, I don't have any in the house so I omitted it. absolutely sinful!

To empty my pantry, I used 6 oz. Baker's bittersweet chocolate, 8 oz. Hershey's semi-sweet chocolate and 1/4 cup of chocolate chips; one stick of butter and 2 Tbs. margarine.  Even with plain old Hershey's cocoa powder and this odd mix of chocolates & fat, the cookies came out fine!  I did put the instant coffee in a small baggie and crushed it with my rolling pin so it would incorporate in the dough more completely.

Delicious.  I used quality chocolate and these were amazing.  They went to a back-to-school picnic, but I'll be making these again for Christmas.  I used a 2-tsp scoop and it made the most perfect chocolate bite.  Any bigger, and you'll miss the deep taste.  Perfect classy cookie.

Considering that I messed up the recipe, these were really good. I accidentally added too much butter and realized it too late, and improvised a bit to try to make up for it. They were really really flat, but still very tasty. Gooey and chocolatey. Next time I will either add a little extra instant coffee or add some white chocolate chips. If you like brownies, you will love these!

Very very good. Fairly easy. Maybe a little to much chocolate for me. Be sure to not overbake and do allow to cool on cookie sheet for a few minutes before removing.

These cookies are hard to handle!  They deserve 5 stars on flavor and texture, but man did I have a time baking them.  I didn't have parchment paper, so I just used my baking stone.  They did not turn out well at all.  They never did get done on the bottom or spread out.  So, I put the dough in the fridge and I went to get parchment paper.  BIG MISTAKE!  This dough is TERRIBLE to deal with when it is cold.  Make sure it is always at ROOM TEMPERATURE or else you will never get them spooned out without making a huge mess.  Other than all that drama, very good cookie.  My husband (aka, the COOKIE MONSTER) gave them a 5, but they were a 4 for me just for all the trouble. They did turn out perfect with the parchment paper.  I will make again.  Thanks for the good recipe.

Great cookies with awesome chocolate taste. I had semi sweet chips and wish I hadn't-I think they would have been even better without. I'm thinking white chips and walnuts next time.

An intense chocolate cookie you might find in a coffee bistro. Wonderful flavor and texture. Even better when I added 4 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips in my second batch.

Divine!  Not an impressive looking cookie but tastes so good!  I used the other reviewers tips and added 1/4 teas. baking soda instead of the Dutch cocoa.  I also let the dough sit for 45 minutes.  I also didn't add the coffee crystals as I'm not a coffee drinker.  I used wax paper on the cookie sheets but found that lightly greasing the wax paper helped.  The cookies are gooey on the inside like a yummy perfect brownie.  Love it!

Wow! This was on the cover of the magazine, so I cut it out and saved it. Made a batch this weekend to take to neighbors. Was so impressed with the outcome -- like a cookie version of a molten chocolate cake served in fine restaurants. I have a convection oven -- baked at 325 for 12 minutes -- cooled on cookie sheets for 10 minutes, then transferred to my granite counter top to complete the cooling. Perfect! So much so, hubs begged me to make a batch tonight just for him. You won't be disappointed!

his recipe was in the magazine this month and looked so good, I had to try it. I followed the recipe exactly except I used Semisweet chocolate chips instead of bakers chocolate because that was what I had. I made them late last evening and waited until this afternoon to try them. They were great! They had such a fudgy taste. I will make these often. deb1001

I made this recipe as is except I added a small amount of vegetable oil, and they came out prefect !!! Almost the consistency of a brownie... The flavor is the best fudge flavor in a cookie I've ever tasted !

Those cookies tasted like mini-brownies! I baked mine at 325 degrees for 8-10 min because my oven is hot. Do NOT overbake. Make sure that everything is at room temperature (except the chocolate) before you start working.

I didn't let the dough set bc I was in a rush, and dropped the 1st batch on the sheet by TB. They looked fabulous, until I took them out & they flattened- although it did have the crackly texture & still tasted fabulous! The 2nd batch, I let set in the fridge, and they turned out perfect, no flattening, and still GREAT flavor!  I didn't add the coffee, only bc I didn't have any on hand, but will add next time. I also added white chocolate chunks and Macadamia nuts! Thanks for sharing. Is this from Cook's Illustrated, as another reviewer suggested? If so, I'm not surprised this recipe is so great, all their recipes are wonderful!

Only change I made to this recipe was to roll the dough balls in powdered sugar before baking.  Baked 10 minutes and the let them cool on sheet for 10 minutes.  Very Very Yummy - Good coffee cookie!  Printed and put in recipe book for future use.

I've tried a few cookie recipes from this site but this one is the absolute best.  Its perfect in taste and chewiness.  The batter can be frozen and used later so that they're always fresh from the oven. I add chocolate chunks for some more awesomeness.  I use this recipe to make all sorts of things......brownies, cookie cups (to fill with cheesecake or chocolate truffle).  Its amazing every time.

GREAT recipe!  If you love chocolate this is an awesome cookie for you.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and used 2 2/3 c. of semi-sweet chocolate chips for the 1 lb. of chocolate, and added 1 tsp. of baking soda to my regular cocoa powder.  We started to make these late at night and I hadn't realized that I needed to let them sit, so we tossed them into the fridge overnight.  The dough was hard the next morning, but the cookies turned out terific!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm really glad I found this recipe!  It's seriously delicious, and not much trouble at all.  I think people get different results using different qualities of chocolate, so go for broke here, and use the good stuff, it's definitely worth it.  These cookies are rich, intensely chocolatey, and if you use good bittersweet or dark chocolate, not overly sweet.  I made the dough last night, and baked off a few, and they were good...today, after refridgerating the dough overnight, I baked the rest and they're much much better. The coffee flavor really comes through.  Incredibly good, thank you.

I love these cookies! They taste like brownies! I agree, you should wait at least 45 minutes before baking. They came out perfect and disappeared in an instant. Now I have to keep making them to keep up with the demand. Also - these freeze very well. THANKS!

I just finished making them and they are everything the reviewers said and more!!!! I didn't use the dutch processed cocoa, I use some amazing cocoa I bought at Central Market and added the 1/4 tsp. baking soda. My 7 yr. old barely let them cool before having to have one. I have never seen him enjoy a cookie more!

Do not skimp - the secret to these cookies is in the quality of the chocolate. Selecting a chocolate with very high cocoa percentage ensures a good "setting up." It seems the darker the chocolate, the firmer the dough. I prefer Valrhona bittersweet. Also using espresso powder instead of instant coffee crystals provides a more-subtle shading of mocha flavor.

Fantastic cookies! They're cookie-crunchy on the outside and brownie-chewy in the center. I refrigerated the dough for 30 min to help the chocolate set and the texture turned out wonderfully. The tip on substituting 1/4 tsp baking soda instead of getting dutch processed cocoa helped a lot (thanks!) I think next time I will add some walnuts or chocolate chunks for added texture. Cheers!

If you like brownies, you'll love these cookies.  Wow they were awesome.  I halved the recipe with no problem.  I didn't have dutch process cocoa so I used regular Hershey's cocoa.  I also didn't have the granules so I omitted them.  I only had 6 oz of bittersweet chocolate so I added 2 oz of white that I had on hand.  These are definitely a keeper.  Everyone in the family loved them.

I really liked these cookies. I added 1 cup of chocolate chips and used regular coffee instead of instant.  I rated them a 4 because the dough was really sticky and kind of hard to work with and for some reason they seemed to smoke in the oven even though they didn't burn the house was awfully smokey.

I am 4 months pregnant and have been looking for a chocolate cookies to satisfy a craving...this was it!  I gave it only 4 stars because I liked them as is but liked them even better with toffee chips added in.  It added great texture and a nice addition to the pure chocolate cookie that the recipe calls for.  Excellent!

I was so busy reading reviews of this cookie that I forgot to let it sit for 35 minutes as the recipe states.  I put them in the oven right away and they came out perfect.  I also added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and they were excellent.  This is the best cookie I've ever had in my life.  If you love chocolate this is the cookie for you!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

They look better than the picture when made.

I didnt use the coffee because I knew the kids would not like that. They did taste like brownies and they were very good.. Next time I make them I will throw in a handful of walnuts and chocolate chips.

These were good cookies, but they are  not chewy as advertised.  I was expecting something similar to a molten chocolate cookie - chewy on the outside and oozy on the inside.  What I got was more like very dense cakey cookies.  No complaints because it was chocolate!

If I could give it more stars I would - this is one amazing cookie! Almost like a brownie but maintained it's cookie texture. The chocolait fix was great! I even added chocolait chunks to the batter to add more gooiness! I will definately make more of these!

Very good.  I thought they would be mocha in flavor with the added coffee. I would make these again, although I might try omitting the instant coffee next time. To my taste, the coffee didn't really add anything except to take away from the overall chocolate taste, and the chocolate taste is WONDERFUL!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are the best chocolate cookies yet. I have had to make 4 batches!! People just cannot get enough of them. My best friend said she didn't care if I ever made her fudge again, she would rather have the brownies. I rolled them in Christmas spinkles for a festive look, they are beautiful and taste even better.

This is an excellent cookie if you enjoy an intense chocolaty flavor (and a hint of coffee). I think they might be a bit overwhelming for some people. I have to say they were easy to make and baked up perfectly. I dusted them with a little powdered sugar as they cooled to give them a crackled effect.

I've been baking for 25 years or so and this is THE BEST CHOCOLATE COOKIE I'VE EVER HAD!  It's rich, chewy and ooooh, so tasty! I like cookies to be a bit more chewy, so next time I'll reduce the time by a minute.  This recipe will become a regular in our house, easy!

I made these last night and they turned out much better than I expected for a cookie without chips. I wanted to add PB chips, but got talked out of it so I made them plain, exactly as the recipe said to. The cookies are chewy and delicious, and have a somewhat soft center that tastes just like fudge (if you don't overbake them:))

I have been looking for a cookie to rival the one at the Paradise Bakery (little chippers.)  These are it!  Very fudgy, great appearance, and addictive.  I do like some kind of crunch cookies like this, not just dough.  So, I added white chocolate chips to some and some toffee chips to some with good results.  They were so chocolatey I was concerned about adding chocolate chips.  But it works fine too!  Enjoy.

Very nice but you do get overwhelmed with the chocolate! I made half quantities and still got about 30 biscuits, so you must have bigger walnuts over ther than we do in Australia!

Thank You Carol P. whoever you are!  These are definately right up the alley of a chocoholic.  I have made all kinds of chocolate cookies and they are either not chocolaty enough or have the consistency of a brownie.  These are perfect.  I added chocolate chips to mine, but I actually think they may have been distracting from the perfect chocolate taste of the dough.  This recipe will always be a treasure in my recipe box.

I made the recipe as written BUT added a Trader Joe chocolate covered caramel wedge to each cookie (wrapped dough around the wedge before baking). Dear God. At least I only made a 1/2 batch.

These cookies are great for the chocoholic.  I made a half batch because I didn't trust myself having a whole batch in the house.  Make sure to use quality chocolate since that is the dominant flavor.  They set up fine on the cookies sheets and are delicious.

This is a rich, very delicious cookie. I used one pound of semisweet chocolate morsels, and I omitted the the coffee because we do not use coffee in our house Because I used salted butter I used 1/2 teaspoon of salt as suggested by another reviewer. Hubby kept stealing them off the baking sheet while they were "setting". I used a measuring tablespoon to portion out the dough and the cookies came out looking the same size and baked perfect. They were a little crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Very yummy. I got 5 dozen cookies. This will become a family favorite!

This is the best chocolate cookie I have ever tasted.
I appreciated the reviewer suggestions that rolling the cookies into balls yielded the best results.  
Time to chill in the fridge for 30 min coupled with rolling the dough into balls yielded perfect, thick, chewy cookies with none of the flattening that some reviewers described.

YUM!!! I followed the recipe except for the following: used plain baking cocoa, used light butter, left out coffee, used 3 tsp vanilla extract. I let it sit for 45 minutes before shaping the dough. These are so, so good. I got 75 small cookies out of the recipe!

50 stars! 500 stars!!! As a true chocoholic I'm always looking for the ultimate fix...and this just might be it. I used dark chocolate (70%) and stirred in Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I'm in heaven. This made about 60 cookies for me which is a double-edged sword. I'm thrilled that there's so many delicious cookies, but I'm watching my weight so can't just sit down and eat every last one. THANK YOU  Carol for an excellent recipe :-)

This is an awesome cookie.  I used cocoa powder with a 1/4 tsp of baking soda because I didn't have dutch process.  Some of the batch I left as-is, some of the batch I added pecans to, and some of the batch I added pecans and chocolate chips.  All were great and chocolatey :)

My boyfriend found this recipe when we threw our New Year's party. The cookies were AMAZING. Very, very chocolate-y. Next time, I think we'll add more ground coffee. It really brings out the flavor of the chocolate, and gives a pleasant crunch of bitterness!

My daughter-in-law and I look for new cookies to add to our Christmas plate gifts. Based on the reviews I made a batch of these. The flavors are very complex and not overly sweet. We agreed, that along with the cranberry hootycreek recipe, this is a MUST cookie and a definite keeper. Thanks for the recipe Carol P.

These are the best chocolate cookies I have ever made or tasted. I made them last Christmas for the first time to include in my christmas baskets. Everyone raved about them and now I make them for every party. I'm about to make a double batch for this years baskets!

Tastes like little brownie bites!  I made a half batch.  I melted about a half bag of mini chips for 1 1/2 minutes in the microwave.  I then added the coffee crystals and vanilla to it.  At first I thought I ruined the chocolate b/c it got a bit thick with the addition of the liquid, but in the end it didn't effect the quality.  I did not cool the batter at all and it made no effect on my cookies.  I used a small cookie scoop which made 35 cookies--and that's a half batch.  They took about 9 minutes to cook.  I did not have parchment but the Reynolds Release foil worked fine.  Only make these if you are a chocolate lover!

I prepared chocolate, sugars and butter as for a brownie recipe and melted them all in the top of a double boiler.  I continued the recipe as directed, but only had 3 eggs - came out fine!  The first batch didn't spread (I used a small cookie scoop) so for the next batch I rolled the dough into balls and flattened slightly with the bottom of a small, decorative bowl dipped in sugar.  Came out beautiful and wonderfully chocolaty!  Yum!!

Everyone in my office loved these. The chocolate flavor rocks! I let the dough sit in the fridge for an hour as people had recommended, and didn't have any problems with consistency at all... nice and chewy...mmmm. Definitely a keeper!

These taste like fudgy brownies.  They are VERY good and with an intense, rich chocolate taste.  They were extremely hard to mix.  When you get to the point of hand mixing in the dry ingredients, you will need some muscle.  I had my doubts because the dough turned so hard and dry (probably b/c of all the semisweet chocolate in it) but they turned out great.  Mine didn't flatten out very much in the oven, so right when I took them out I flattened them SLIGHTLY with the back of a spoon, they are like little discs.  They get a "cracked" look on the top, which looks nice.  I baked mine for 8 minutes, I like soft/chewy cookies, we'll see how soft they stay after a day in the cookie jar.  Straight out of the oven they are delicious, you will need MILK to go with these!

This recipe is phenomenal! Be careful not to overbake, however; a couple of extra minutes in the oven totally changes the character of this cookie.  I used King Arthur organic white whole wheat flour with excellent results.

Really good and they improve over the first few days. I used Ghiradelli 60% chips for the chocolate and added a few semi sweet and white chocolate chips. They had a really good chocolate punch. Make them small as they are really rich.

I made these with some 72% cacao bittersweet chocolate from Trader Joe's, and some 62% cacao Nestle Chocolatier chocolate (both in bars).  It was a dark chocolate cookie this way, which is what my hubby really likes.  If you are more of a milk chocolate person, I'd suggest the semisweet as the recipe states.  They are chewy and delicious- really rich!

Great Cookies! Taste like brownies, and have that crackled look even.  My husband loves them and he doesn't really go for desserts. These store really well and stay chewy in an airtight container.

I am only giving it 4 stars because of some of the flavour was not as rich as I thought it would be but it my be my fault as I did not have a pound of quality chocolate and I substituted 8 - 1/3 cups of chocolate chips melted for the chocolate.  The presentation is definitely a 5 when they are rolled...they are so pretty.  Will make again but use a better quality chocolate.

Great tasting, chocolaty tasting cookie...reminds me of a brownie with a cookie texture.  This recipe did take quite some time, so I only recommend making these when you can dedicate the day to making them.  A great Christmas Cookie however.  Thanks so much for sharing, I have a new favorite cookie recipe ;)

These are not a sit down and eat a dozen in one sitting, unless of course you want to become sick.  They are wonderfully rich, chocolate cookies.  They would be great still warm and with a bowl of ice cream.  

I did not have Dutch processed cocoa on hand and used 1/4 t. baking soda in addition to the regular cocoa just as I saw a previous baker used.  It worked beautifully.

These are a keeper!!

These are awesome!  Best chocolate cookie I've ever made.  I added 12ozs. of milk chocolate chips (as if they weren't chocolaty enough!), which made them even more soft and gooey/chewy.  YUM!

I can't say I've ever made a chocolate cookie before quite like this but I won't ever have to look again.  After baking about 6 different types of cookies for giveaways, and letting my boys taste them all, these were hands down the favorite.  My youngest didn't even want to finish his other ones, he only wanted more 'chocolate cookies'.  I think we'll be making these again VERY soon.  Thank you!

Okay, this is the best cookie EVER.  I followed the recipe exactly, using ghiradelli chocolate (don't denigrate this recipe by using low-quality chocolate!!).  I also refrigerated the batter for a few hours - not sure if that helped, but they turned out wonderfully.  I cooked them for 8 minutes on 350 and they are like molten lava cookies.  A chocolate-lover's dream!!

These are very good but I haven't made up my mind if I like them better than my other, easier to make chocolate cookie recipe.  I threw in two cups of white chocolate chips and some nuts.  Thanks for the recipe, chocolate lovers everywhere are getting their "fix" with this one.

Not bad, but considering all the rave reviews, I was slightly disappointed. Although it might be my own fault- I used finely ground coffee in place of the instant coffee granules.

These cookies are delicious!  I used regular cocoa powder and 1/4 t baking soda.  Mine turned out quite large and flat - I would suggest using teaspoon-sized drops if you want neat cookies.  I would also halve the recipe unless going to a shared lunch - my batch made 40 very large (3-4" wide) cookies.

These cookies fixed my chocolate craving as well as everyone else's at my work. I didn't think they were too rich but you have to like chocolate. The texture was perfect, a little chewy, very soft and moist. I followed the recipe except added the 1/2 tsp of baking soda like others recommended since I didn't have Dutch processed cocoa powder. I will be making these again!

Mmmmmm.... I don't like coffee, but I didn't notice any unpleasant taste of coffee - just a rich chocolatey taste. (And thanks to the reviewers who explained that 1/4 tsp baking soda should be added to regular cocoa to substitute for Dutch process - I didn't know that.)

These are the most wonderful chocolate cookies I have ever tasted! Incredibly adult, they melt in your mouth. Positively addictive. The batter is stiff, and I made small, bitesize morsels, but that only makes them last longer (I wish!). Great with a glass of cold milk!

This is my favorite double chocolate cookie recipe.  I usually cut the sugar in cookies but don't do it in this recipe.  This chocolate is so deep/rich that you need the sugar.  These cookies come out chewy and crackled on top.  I used a cookie scooper to drop the dough onto a baking stone, ignoring (sorry) the "walnut size" directions and parchment paper.  Delicious!

These were great and fairly easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I couldn't find Dutch process cocoa in any of my local stores, so I used regular (Hershey) unsweetened cocoa powder cut w/ 1/4 tsp. baking soda.  The batch went very quickly!!

This is the best chocolate cookie I think I will ever eat. It is certainly better than any I have eaten to date. If this suggests my search is over, so be it. I can live with that. The chocolate flavor opens in the mouth to a size much grander than you would expect. And then the chewy center, that fudgy brownie effect. Man. I am ready to go spend some serious money on some serious chocolate and find out how far off the chart I can launch this cookie.

This cookie is pretty tasty fresh from the oven but the chocolate flavor intensifies if you store them in an air-tight container for a couple of days. Well worth the wait if you can manage it!

This was an awesome recipe I will definitely make again. I had no instant coffee in my pantry. So, instead after I mixed the chocolate in the mixture I poured coffee in. Then I added dry ingredients. It really worked and the taste was delicious.

Full marks, exactly as written, except I used regular cocoa powder. Apparently my city doesn’t stock Dutch process.

Delicious. Addictive little morsels. Not the easiest or most convenient cookies to make, but oh, so worth it. Ultra chocolate-y. We made them bite-size. Uncooked balls the size of quarters and the 7-minute cook time was great.

Rich and chocolatey! I read another review that suggested reducing salt to 1/2 tsp. if using salted butter and adding 1/4 tsp. baking soda to coco powder if you don't have dutch process coco. These worked out well. Also, in lieu of parchment paper try a very light dusting of flour on a greased cookie sheet to prevent them from spreading to much. Mine came out perfect! To make them into a xmas cookie I lightly press a Hershey's peppermint kiss on top right out of the oven, they are pretty and delicious.  Keeping them on the small side I got 90 cookies from 1 batch.

I followed the recipe in magazine and these did not turn out. I  then looked at the recipe online and the ingredient amounts are different. I wish I had looked online first! Please make sure the magazine and the online recipes match! Very disappointed. I will probably try again with online recipe.

These are so chocolatey. Definitely goes well with coffee or tea. 
The new guy at work should be thrilled.. I followed the instructions on the recipe with 2 substitutes. 
Found the clarification from another review tp substitute 2 2/3 cups chocolate chips (melted in microwave in small batches then added to creamed butter, eggs and sugar. I also  added 1/4  tsp baking soda to dry flour mix as I didn’t have Dutch processed cocoa.
Baked 15 minutes.

I didn’t have any problems stirring this like some people did, but to be fair I used a kitchen aid with the paddle attachment. If you’re having trouble mixing the melted chocolate, you likely either didn’t melt the chocolate enough or you burned it (if it looks like it’s crystallizing you cooked it too much). I also waited to melt mine in the microwave until after I mixed the dry ingredients. I made mine into more of a Mexican hot chocolate flavor by adding 1 tsp cinnamon powder, 1/8 tsp cayenne powder, and 1/8 tsp red chili powder to a half-batch of dough (sift in with the other dry ingredients). It’s got some heat so be prepared and experiment until you find a ratio that works for you.

This had excellent chocolate flavor, but didn't spread all that well.  I flattened them before baking and they came out great.

I only changed one thing - I didn't have Dutch process cocoa so I used Hershey's special dark. THESE COOKIES MIGHT BE THE BEST COOKIES EVER. I might be exaggerating, but dang. I made them three days ago and they're still perfectly soft. They're like a brownie in cookie clothing. Love love love them! Thank you for this recipe!! Will definitely be my go-to chocolate cookie from here on out!

These cookies are very rich.  They were completely devoured before the 10 minutes cooling were up.  I didn't have Nescafe, so i used coffee flour from Trader Joe's, which turned out great and i think has better flavor than Nescafe. I also had to substitute chocolate chips for the Dutch chocolate. They have the richness of brownies, but consistency of cookies.  I love browned butter in brownies so i may brown it first next time, and yes there will be a next time.

I love a really strong coffee/mocha flavour so I used espresso powder instead of coffee, and added coffee extract with the vanilla. I didn't have quite enough semisweet chocolate, so I used some unsweetened too. Also made a Kahlua glaze which I drizzled over the cookies. I did try a cookie before glazing, and found that even then the coffee flavour was rather slight (for me). But the chocolate flavour is great!

Man, these are awesome.  I am not a chocolate lover at all, but we have some chocolate lovers in the family so I usually make one chocolate cookie for them.  These are really good!  They stayed soft and have a really nice complex flavor.  I used Dutch cocoa and a little of a super dark cocoa I have, and only used 10 ozs. Of chocolate because that's all I had.  I thought I screwed up because I forgot to put the butter in the first batch and had to beat it into the stiff dough at the end after I realized I had forgotten it and they still were perfect, same as the second batch I didn't screw up, so the recipe seems to be very forgiving.  I also used king aurthurs espresso powder, which I put in anything chocolate.  These cookies are great.  I also rolled 1/2 of them in chopped pecans I had left from another cookie I made and that was great also.

These taste like brownie cookies! So good! I was a little worried from reviews but glad I decided to make them anyway. I used cold butter instead of margarine and I think the cold helped keep them from spreading too flat like others had problems with. I will definitely be keeping this recipe! I used them as a base for my Pilgrim Hat cookies (top with Rollo's and mini Reece's cups and decorate with icing) for Thanksgiving - worked out perfectly! I did shape then into balls and smushed them into fat discs and baked them on parchment lined cookie sheet because the first sheet I did drop cookies didn't get round/flattened enough to use for my purposes.

Love this cookie!  I made it just as written!  Just don't overtake or you will not get that chewy brownie texture.  I will make them again and leave out the coffee.  I felt like it took away from the pure chocolate taste!

These are DELICIOUS! They taste like brownie cookies. I have a few solid cookie recipes, but decided to try something new last week. I found this recipe and thought I'd try it! It's now one of my favorites. It made a ton of cookies. They flattened out after cooling, but they were still a hit! Also, I tried adding Butterfinger crumbles and it burnt the bottoms. They cooked much faster with the candy in them.

very chocolaty, soft cookie!!  It seems the middle of mine are a little doughy, but the taste is great. I followed the recipe in the magazine (feb/mar 2015), but this one has minor changes. Not sure which one to foolow.

My friend Lissa brought these to my AR Round Up in December  2015 and they were a hit.  I am not a chocolate lover but these were wonderful and I had to make them.   If you like brownies you will love these.  I used Trader Joe's Pound Plus 72% Cacao Dark Chocolate.  The dough is very thick, I used my #30 black scoop and got exactly 42 cookies.  Perfect.

I made these exactly as written, and rolled the cookies instead of dropping them. They baked up uniformly and beautifully. These are rich, soft, and moist, with a lovely depth of flavor owing to the dutch cocoa and espresso.  For cleaner rolling, dusting your hands in powdered sugar prevents them sticking to you and doesn't affect the flavor or texture at all. These will be a new staple cookie in this house.

I was looking for a new choco cookie recipe, and tried this. I didn't make any changes. They came out nice and uniform but found them a bit boring to eat and look at. Will go back to the chocolate crinkle cookie that I normally make at Xmas.

Wonderful! Very chocolaty and rich. Accidentally only used 8 tbsps butter (half butter and half coconut oil) so the cookies didn't spread out much at all. Looked kinda like a truffle.

So I made these with a fudge instead of chocolate, because i didn't want to run out to the store, and it was fantastic, they came out with a soft fudge center and taste like cookie type brownies, and I made a homemade candied peanut butter spread to go on top, much like a candied caramel spread you see on candy apples. it came out absolutely amazing, i shared them with my neighbors and my roommate and boyfriend. But I did minus out the coffee, though because i didnt have it. or i would have put it in there. i will next time though for sure. best cure for my sweet tooth!

Love love love love these cookies!! I tried making these cookies with a few different recipes and they all turned out horrible then I stumble upon this recipe and it turns out perfectly!! I didn't have the Dutch cocoa and so I just used normal cocoa powder and it still turned out great!! This recipe made so many cookies which was great because I had a lot of people I owed cookies and after they ate them they were begging for more!! These cookies even converted a non chocolate lover to devoir them in under a minute!!! I will definetly be making these again and again!!!

Excellent recipe, except leave the coffee out if you don't like coffee. Supposedly you can't taste it, but if you are not a coffee lover, that is not true.  That being said, my husband and son did not notice it. Now I know when people say the coffee just deepens the chocolate flavor, that is only true if you are a coffee lover.
I will make these again but with no coffee!

This recipe is spot on. Took 2/3 of the cookies to work and they were all gone by lunch time. Cookies are the breakfast of champions, at least on Mondays. 

The only change I made was baking them for 13 mins instead of the instructed 10. I chalk this up to a difference in actual oven temp (vs. oven display). Baked the 1st batch for 10 mins, let them cool and found them slightly saltier than expected (wasn't bad, kind of like a salted caramel). When I did the next batch at 13 min, the saltiness wasn't present.

These cookies were awesome! They dont come out "tasting like coffee" really, but the coffee definitely enhances the dark chocolate flavor. Also I let my dough sit for over an hour and it was really easy to roll out. I think next time I will try a caramel glaze over them

These are my family's favorite cookies - they are moist, delicious and absolutely addictive.  They freeze well and in fact taste really good frozen!  The only change to the recipe is the cooking time.  It usually takes about 16-17 minutes for these to be fully cooked.  Thanks for a great recipe!

OMG... this is fantastic!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, and then added in a cup of Heath chips, then rolled the dough into balls and they baked up perfectly!  I think for the holidays, I'll add in chopped candy canes.  These are spectacular... like a fudge brownie cookie with a crisp crust.  My new favorite cookie recipe!

I love these! They were so YUMMY! The instant coffee is what makes these. Ditto on the don't let it get too col/hard because it makes it tough to scoop out. Ended up letting it sit out to soften-no big deal though. Had to keep making more cause they were disappearing fast!

This recipe should be called Death by Chocolate. I love chocolate and this is definitely as chocolate as chocolate gets. I think I may have eaten 1/4 of the batter while placing the batter onto the pans! A definite "non-guilt-free" cookie! I added roasted almonds and white chocolate to the cookies before placing in the oven and it was amazing!

These weren't the best Chocolate cookies ever, but they did come very close. Next time I'd add a few nuts and maybe some white chocolate.

Amazing! The dough was very stiff at the end, but the cookies still flatten like they should. Chewy center with crispy edges. I only had bittersweet chocolate chips so melted those. Took a basketful to work...all I heard were moans! My new favorite cookie recipe.

Wow...  very good!  Super chocolatey and great texture.  I didn't add the coffee - my hubby doesn't like it.  They seemed a little boring (probably because of that), but I think adding nuts would greatly improve them (with or without the coffee)!  I didn't have any walnuts (I think they would be best), but I pressed a few pecans into a cookie right when it came out of the oven, and that made it tons better than it already was!  I'll try walnuts in the batter next time, or press a few into each cookie before baking.  Thanks so much for indulging a chocoholic!

I use this recipe when I aim to please a chocolate lover or two!  They always disappear quickly... super soft and yummy!
The only change I made, is I add a pkg. of chocolate chunks, and let it stand for a little longer than listed.  I drop my the rouded tablespoon, and they are perfect every time.  Just be careful not to overcook them if you want them chewy!  Bake them only until set...

These are SO GOOD and SO MOIST and SO CHOCOLATEY! Instead of one pound of chopped chocolate, I just melted a 12 oz. bag of semi sweet chocolate chips in the microwave, and it worked fine. I can't imagine a more chocolatey cookie. Delicious!
***I'm editing my review because although these were great the day I made them, they were not very good the day after.***

These cookies just are not doing it for me like they are for some of you.  Perhaps I had high expectations after reading the reviews or I'm just a chocolate snob?  Either way, I gave three stars because its not that they're bad but they're not excellent.  There has been some question as to weather they are brownies or not, I'm not sure either way but even if they are I don't think the 'brownies' are that great.

Good cookies.  I think I burnt the chocolate at the beginning so they have a little burnt taste to them (my fault).  Or maybe it was the coffee.  Worth trying one more time and not burning the chocolate :)

I made these as the recipe stated, except I used regular Hershey's cocoa instead of dutch cocoa.  They still came out very yummy, nice and chewy.  Brownie like, but I'm a brownie lover, so I have no problem with that!

I must agree with other reviewers who think that these cookies are actually brownies. After several batches, I decided to spread out the rest of the batter onto a pan and I got brownies squares out of this recipe.

Very good!  My husband requested something "really chocolaty", so I made these cookies.  They really hit the spot.  The few we had left had dried out a little after a day, however.  Thank you!!

definately leave out the coffee.  For a little fun, when they first come out of the oven push a few mini marshmellows into them and then drizzle them with a tiny bit of chocolate glaze.  Really pretty and yummy.

These were good, not the best i've tasted.  They are very soft and chocolately!  They keep well at room temp in a ziplock bag or airtight container.

WOW!  Very good cookie.  So easy to make.  Every chocolate lover will like these.  I like the fact that they stay nice and chewy annd moist, not dried.  Will make these again and again.  I did use chocolate chips as that is all I had.  Turned out amazing.

Mmmm chocolate!! Turned out great. The batter comes out nice and thick and it taste just like a brownie. Would probably be good with some nuts added to it or a single pecan on top.

Makes a very, very good chocolate chewy cookie if you don't overbake it.  If you do and it ends up hard, it still tastes great - like a round biscotti.  My almost 3-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter had a great time "helping" lick off the beaters and clean out the bowl that I melted the chocolate in.  They helped roll the pinched off dough pieces into balls too, in spite of saying they looked like "poop".  Tasted great when cooked - rolled half of recipe into balls & froze in bags of 12 to thaw & bake at a later date.  will have to see how the thaw & bake works out.

Hmmm. I was so anxious to try this recipe. I just made them tonight and while the texture is chewy and puffy like a brownie. The taste is sort of bitter or not sweet enough. I didn't add anything to the recipe, so maybe next time I will try white choc chips. I can see how they would sweeten it up a bit. I used semi sweet choc chips- and a teaspoon of expresso powder instead of2 tsp of instant coffee.

These cookies have a rich chocolate flavor and were a huge hit at a potluck I had at my school.  I took the advise of other reviewers and substituted the regular Hersheys cocoa w/1/4 tsp. baking soda.  These cookies are perfect for chocolate lovers! Next time I am adding nuts to recipe.

great recipe, very soft and chocolatly.  all that i would suggest is getting bold and very (can't overstress) finely ground coffee.  chocolate chips/chunks would be a good addition as well.

These were awesome - just plain awesome. The cookie dough was to die for as well. Can't go wrong with these - make sure to let them sit long enough, though.

I've tried the other top rated chocolate cookies, but this is the best. It tastes exactly like the pre-mix cookies in the supermarkets that you just add oil, egg and water to. It is very soft, chewy, and rich. I added chocolate chips to it for extra fudgy centers! Amazing! Incredible! Everybody loves this recipe!! I won't try any other recipes again!!!

These cookies are almost perfect, certainly the best I've tasted. Be sure to leave enough space between the cookies on the pan because they spread a lot. I would have given 5 stars if they were not so sweet. Maybe half the semi-sweet choc should be replace with dark chocolate? Or reduce the sugar a bit... But they are REALLY excellent!!

I had to try this recipe because of all the wonderful reviews that it had received, and I am glad I did!  I found that it didn't have so much of a coffee flavour, it was pure ecstacy.  Substitutions: margarine and a dash of salt; 2 2/3C of chocolate chips; and I added an extra 1/4 baking powder b/c I used regular cocoa.  Next time I would add maybe a little more coffee crystals and try adding some nuts.

Absolutely the most fabulous chocolate cookie recipe I've ever made. The cookie is that wonderful combination of chewy center and crispy edges and is to-die-for chocolaty. Incredibly rich and decadent - Look no further than this delicious recipe for a real treat. 
As far as changes, I skipped the coffee, I just didn't want that flavor, and my dough balls were bigger than walnut-sized - I like a big cookie! I also sprinkled some confectioner's sugar on top before baking to make them look more festive.

Wow!  These were awesome!  Just like a brownie, only in cookie form.  Not your "everyday" cookie, but a definite treat!  I tried to stay pretty close to the recipe, but made a few modifications.  I used margarine and it worked well. Also, I used 1/2 vanilla extract and 1/2 almond extract.  It gave the cookies a nice little subtle difference that I really liked.  I didn't have instant coffee granules, so I used a spoonful of cappuccino mix.  I made these with my two-year-old and his reaction was "MORE PLEASE!"  
This one is a keeper!  Thank you!

This cookie has excellent chocolate flavor.  This is the cookie for the ultimate chocolate fan.  This batch made way more than 3.5 dozen - more like 5 dozen total.  Also, the dough for the last batch became so soft and started to melt because of the melted chocolate.

These are very good and chewy. Definitely perfect for chocolate lovers. Expect the dough to be more like a batter (you could probably bake it in a pan as brownies). The recipe says to use parchment paper - but trust me, you don't even need to to grease the pans for these little grease balls. The only thing they'll stick to is your ribs! These are way too greasy for me to make again - sorry.

Even if God Himself told me not to make these cookies again, I would have to disobey. They are an experience unto themselves. The only thing I might add is white chocolate.

It was a very simple recipe and very easy to make.  The raves were amazing!  Make sure to use the best quality chocolate you can find/afford!  They were rich and delicious.  My friends and family were anxious for the next batch.

Delicious! Everyone loved them.  But my
first batch came out burnt. I had to lower
the temp to 325. At first, I thought
I had messed up because the cookies came
out too floury and cake like. But after
eating them the next day, YUMMY! They are
very chocolately, although, not as chewy
as I hoped.
