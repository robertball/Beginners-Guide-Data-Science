Delicious!  The only modification I made was to top with 1/2lb ground beef with 1/2 pkt taco seasoning.  Great recipe!

Just so you know - this is also great using sweet potato wedges and the taco seasoning mix recipe from this site - everyone at our party last night loved the combination (made this for my vegetarian friend). Also, I used very spicy pico de gallo and forgot the green chilis - still was great!

The family loved these!  The more toppings the better.  Me, I didn't get to try them, them were inhaled.   Note to self, come football season, double or triple the recipe.  (I used pinto beans instead of black beans)

I made this with a few modifications.  I browned 1/2 lb. of ground venison with 2 tsp. of Taco Seasoning.  I then added a can of Mexican Bean Salad.  I put that mixture on top of the roasted potato wedges and topped with chopped sweet onion and tomatoes and then topped all with Mexican shredded cheese.  I served with taco sauce and sour cream. DH loved it and went back for seconds.  Very pleased with this and look forward to making it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for something fun and quick to make for a after dinner treat  and this was perfect! It's a very flexible yummy dish you could easily make an appetizer or as a side. 

I also added one red pepper [diced ]
Half a cup of corn 
I feel those additions really made the dish pop and gave it the extra boost in taste. Served with side sour cream but not necessary it's great without.

Oh and don't make the same mistake I made by putting wax paper on baking sheet a few potatoes got stuck to it lol! Enjoy!

Thank you

Very tasty. Might want to increase the number of potatoes next time to carry all the "stuff" on top.

Yum!   I put the potatoes in a baking dish after the initial cooking time, then added cheese , a full can of Rotel tomatoes and full can of drained black beans. 
Baked in the oven for  another 15 min,  added a final scattering of cheese once out of the oven.
A very tasty easy to prepare dish with minimal  ingredients!

Doubled recipe and shared it as a evening supper. Great way to cook healthier potato fries, no deep frying!
