Surprisingly good! My family could not guess the ingredients! They're already begging me to make another batch tomorrow when we have company over. I think I will! Thanks so much for submitting this!

These are the only thing that Jeremy Axlerad has eaten all day.
That drop of lemon juice really sealed the deal.

All the ingredients are well worth it.  I used Hazel Nut Hot Chocolate instead of regular hot chocolate for a little extra nuttiness.  I love salty chocolate anything but I did reduce the amount of salt by one quarter, and next time I may even half the amount called for by the recipe.  There are so many layered flavours in these cookies - don't over power them with salt!
