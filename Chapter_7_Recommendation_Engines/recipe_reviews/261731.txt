Made as written and this turned out good. It looked dense but it wasn't. It was light and fluffy and full of flavor. It actually turned out so soft that it didn't hold it's shape once cut and crumbled. While the corn added texture, I'm not sure I liked it and probably wouldn't add it next time. This was one of the better vegan versions I have tried.

I added a 8 oz. can of sliced jalape√±o peppers. I like their flavor when cooked in cornbread.
