This cake is absolutely incredible!!!  Whether you  make the entire cake recipe as written, or choose to make just the cake or just the icing, you will not be disappointed.  This is definetly well worth the effort to make this dessert for a special occasion!  A few tips when trying this one-- 1.- Allow yourself plenty of time for this recipe.  It takes quite a while between preparing, baking, and waiting for the cakes to cool and the filling and icing to chill.  2.- Make sure you have whipped the filling very well before chilling.  If you haven't whipped the whipping cream well enough, the cake layers will slip and slide when you try to frost the cake. 3.- Don't spread the whipped cream filling all the way to the outter edge of the cake layers.  When you're frosting the cake, the pressure will spread the filling a bit and the filling will come out the sides of the cake if you've spread it too close to the edge.  All in all, this recipe is definetly a keeper and well worth the time it took to prepare.  I know I will never buy store bought chocolate frosting or cake mix after trying this recipe!

For over 35 years this is the cake recipe I've always known as "The Perfect Chocolate Cake."  And make no mistake about it, it is aptly named, because it IS perfect. I've always let the water and cocoa mixture cool before combining it with the rest of the ingredients.  Don't know if that's necessary or not, but it's always worked for me.  For the frosting, the recipe I've always used calls for light cream (half and half) rather than heavy cream and again, it's always worked for me.  After blending in the powdered sugar I set the frosting over a bowl of ice and beat it until it holds its shape.  Other than maybe the "Black Magic Cake" from this site,  I don't recall ever making a better chocolate cake than this.  It's impressive in its presentation, a feast for the eyes as well as the palate.  If you're looking for a good old-fashioned chocolate cake that's sure to impress, this is the one.  It has been requested for more birthdays than I can count over many, many years!

My dad was devastated when he remembered that this recipe was lost in his recent apartment fire. Funny thing is, he got it for free in the mail many years ago back when you used to get those packages of recipes all together. I went looking for it, and here it is. This is THE best chocolate cake I've ever had. Most chocolatey. Very decadent. It's all everyone who knows him asks him to bring to any gathering. BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE YOU'LL EVER HAVE. Thank you for posting this recipe. If it wasn't for you, we would have never had this cake again.

I give this cake 5 stars, however I had one reservation—The frosting could be improved.  The cake portion was probably one of the best “from scratch” cakes I have ever made and it is RICH and delicious!  I will continue to search out the perfect frosting, however anyone that makes this cake will not be disappointed.  It is definitely wonderful.  Be sure to use the best quality cocoa as it certainly made a difference in mine.  Thanks for the recipe!  This is definitely going to be a keeper for me!

This was a great cake - very rich and tasty!!!  Be prepared for a lot of dirty dishes.  The only small problem that I had was with the chocolate frosting - when I stirred the powdered sugar into the butter/chocolate/cream mixture, it didn't totally mix in.  Even after whipping it back up after it was cool, I felt like there was still little chunks of powdered sugar.  I think the next time I make it I will use my mixer to really mix in the powdered sugar before I refrigerate it.

A couple of issues. First and foremost, It's not a torte, it's a cake. I did not realize that a torte is made with *much* less flour to get that fluffy, almost mousse like quality, after being disappointing with the cake turn out of this (I just dislike the texture of cake, it's like chewing on a sponge), I looked up the difference, but that was disappointing. It's not a torte, it's a cake. Really you could have done the same thing with a box from the store.

Secondly, the icing is WAY too sweet. I mean, i get that people like rich, but it doesn't even taste like chocolate icing, it just happens to be brown.

I can definitely see why some would like this, don't get me wrong. But I wish there was more of a warning about just how incredibly rich and sweet this is, and how it is in no way, what-so-ever a torte.

As a whole, I felt it really wasn't worth all the effort.  The cake part is good (used half coffee / half water), the filling is just whipped cream - which who doesn't love whipped cream?  But that frosting?  It was too much, too sweet.  With a different frosting and a tweak here & there, this could be a five star.

GREAT cake for chocolate lovers! I love chocolate, so I used fresh brewed coffee in place of water and added hot cocoa mix to the mixture for an extra kick...and boy was it chocolaty! Cake is perfect for a chocolate cake, lots of cleaning afterwards, but you won't be disappointed.

Yumm, this was delicious. A bit hard to work with because layers kept sliding off eachother. Make sure to refrigerate cake layers well before filling. I did overnight. Also, I make my topping in microwave, which makes it so much faster to cool down. The whole family loved it! I would suggest to take it out of the fridge 15-20 minutes before serving to let it come to room temp. It is so much more delicious that way!

I made this recipe twice, following it exactly. I have to say that the CAKE part of this torte is really yummy. But the filling and frosting I did not care for AT ALL. Nor did my family. That is why I give this two stars. The filling is just whipped cream and kinda blah, and the frosting was sickeningly sweet and just too much. Like I said, I gave this tow chances, and that is my feeling. I really think this cake would be better with a ganache or buttercream frosting. Also, if you are going to make the filling, you will definitely need to double it to fill a double or triple layer cake.  I also saw that many people complained about the layers sliding and cake falling apart when they tried to put the filling on. I wonder if they left the cake layers rounded and tried to stack them. You will definitely need to use a cake leveler or a serrated knife to cut off the rounded tops before stacking this cake.  This is a good rule for stacking cakes in general but especially recipes like this that call for whipped cream.

A few things that I never do are bake, follow recipes exactly and eat chocolate cake.  I did all 3 today and wow, this is the best cake I've ever made and as far as I can recall, the best I've ever eaten.  Excellent recipe.  Will definitely be doing this one again exactly as it says to.

Excellent cake.  Instead of 2 cups of boiling water I used 1 cup of boiling water and 1 cup of fresh brewed coffee, it gave it a little more dimension.  Made this for my mother-in-law's birthday and everyone raved about it.  What a fantastic recipe, thank you for sharing.

Unbelieveable. Really. I will say that all I got to eat were the scraps from shaving off the tops of the cakes and samples of the filling and frosting... I made this to give away to someone who donated to a ride I'm doing. **Her feedback on it was that it is incredible. They were supposed to take it to a party but it didn't last just sitting there on the counter looking so pretty... I'm excited to make this for ME and eat a piece or two... It's more time consuming than open-box-add egg and oil... but OMG... worth every second of the time. =)

I've made this a few times now, following the recipe exactly, the first as a base layer of an 11 x 15 in. sheet cake for about 75 people. Got RAVE reviews! Made it again a few days ago for my fiance's sister's sweet 16, but as a 3 tier. We ended up taking that to her band camp, where it was gone in 5 minutes. Amazing recipe!!! I didn't care too much for the filling, but the actual cake and frosting were absolutely amazing!

This tasted so wonderful therefore worth the effort to make. Lots of steps but for the right person(s) it worth it. I didn't change a thing. Next time I will even out my layers better and be more consistent with how much I put between the layers.

Seventeen Magazine published this in the late 70's as The Perfect Chocolate Cake! I had saved the recipe but lost it and didn't think I would find it again. I did the ingredient search and up popped the exact same recipe. This cake really is amazing and I am so grateful that you published it!!!

This cake was delicious!  I made the cakes the night before and chilled them overnight, and the icing and filling the next day.  Everything must be 100% cool or filling/icing the cake will be very difficult.  I had to put it in the fridge periodically as I was icing it to keep it cool.  I did have a rather hard time cutting it.  The icing had hardened somewhat in the fridge but the whipped cream filling started to get "slidey" very quickly, so some pieces fell apart on their way to the plates.  This cake serves at least 15 people. We were 10 and ate only half the cake.

This is the best chocolate cake from scratch that I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  I was skeptical about the whipped cream between layers and almost used the icing instead.  I am glad I didn't!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  It is a keeper!

I only made the cake, I used a different filling and a buttercream frosting. The only change I made to the recipe was using cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. The directions are easy to follow, the cooking time and temperature are accurate, the texture is nice, it was easy to cut into layers...but the taste seems to be lacking something. The flavor is nice, but it lacks depth- this is why I only gave the recipe 4 stars. Next time I make this (I will use this recipe again), I think I will replace a 1/2 cup of the water with coffee and add an additional 1/2 cup of sugar.

I did not make the frosting but only the cake and it is definitely my new choc cake recipe - fabulous!  I made it in a 9x13 pan and it turned out great and frosted with a buttercream frosting.  So good!

I made this torte a week ago for a co-workers birthday. She wanted chocolate on chocolate on chocolate. I found this recipe & thought that it sounded pretty darn good. I didn't have time to test this out on my family, so my first try was for all my co-workers. All I can say is FANTASTIC!!! Everyone loved this cake. So much so that one of the girls requested this for her birthday next month & another one said the frosting is much better than her chocolate frosting which she felt was quite good. I followed the recipe to the letter. There is no need to change anything. I mixed the cakes in my food processor & baked them the day before. When cooled I wrapped them in plastic wrap & left them on my counter. Whipped up the filling & frosting the next day & finished it off. I did cut up a 50g milk chocolate bar & sprinkle on top just for looks. This is a definite keeper & I would rate more if I could. Thanks so much for the recipe, it's awesome!!

I made this for my daughter's 15th. birthday and it was absolutely delicious! My family thoroughly enjoyed it. Just a note-I did this in three stages: Baking, Layering, Frosting-and I allowed quite a few hours between each stage to allow everything to settle nicely. Lovely for special occasions.

I am only rating the cake and I give it 5 stars!  Very easy, flavorful, and moist.  I baked the cake in a 9x13 pan and topped it with "quick and almost professional buttercream icing" with chopped Oreo's mixed in.  Family raved!

This is by far the best cake recipe I have ever had! I always get rave reviews and last time I made it my mother wouldn't give us kids ANY to take home! The cake is so moist it's a great choc. cake standby recipe anytime you make a chocolate cake. The tops shavings I cut off in order to stack the layers flat get eaten up by any friends I have over while making this phenominal cake!

I finally got around to making this awesome cake.  It is so moist and rich with its delicious whipped cream filling and fudgy frosting.  It took some time to frost, but so worth it.

This is a great cake, Just made it and everyone loved it.  I feel like you need to make a double batch of the center filling in order to have enough though.

Excellent! Next time I will make twice as much filling -- it was everyone's favorite part of the cake! It also helps to make eaters believe the cake is more moist (yum)

Fantastic cake! But I changed three things- 1. Add 1/4 of a teaspoon of nutmeg, it gives the cake a chocolatey "nutty" flavor 2. Add a bit of extra vanilla in both the cake and filling and add a bit more cocoa if your a big chocolate fan (like me) 3. Make sure not to put to much filling on the layers, the cake squishes together and makes the filling run down the side. Also, if you only have two 9 inch baking pans, I would suggest baking two layers, wait to cool, flip, clean pan and whiloe baking the third layer, flip the first layer onto the cake and put on the filling. And then flip the second and then REFRIGERATE!!!

I made the butter from scratch which, I think made the cake super moist! To make butter just throw some cream in the blender until it forms "curds". Then squeeze the buttermilk out with a cheese cloth! The cake was great, everyone enjoyed it!

This cake is DELICIOUS. I made it for the first time for my best friend's birthday in a bundt pan. I separated the egg whites and added the yolks as directed, then after the batter was complete I whipped the egg whites and folded them in. SO GOOD!! I also made a nut cream frosting with soaked pecans, almonds, and walnuts. Blend them with a bit of water and coconut oil (or butter) and honey! Amazing!! I'd give more stars if possible.. I had trouble getting the batter into the pan because I wanted to eat it all :] Thanks for such a great recipe!

I have made this cake four times now and it has turned out perfectly each time. Follow the recipe's directions exactly and you cannot fail. This is my family's favorite cake. It is so much better than any cake you can get at a bakery or even a fine restaurant. Warning: Once you try this cake, you may never be able to eat a cake from a box again.

This cake is amazing!  My family actually thought it tasted better the second day--after it chilled in the refrigerator for 24 hours.  I had trouble spreading the filling between the layers.  I thought I was using too much because the top layer would slide.  So I didn't use very much filling and we all thought it needed more when we tasted it.  Next time, I will try to thicken filling and use more.  Also, this is a HUGE cake--the recipe says it makes 10 servings, but I think you could easily get 12 or more out of it.  This reminded me of a cake you might find at a gourmet bakery.  We all LOVED it!

Wow! This cake is absolutely delicious. The chocolate frosting is super light and fluffy and just full of chocolatey goodness. The cake itself is moist and delicious.  The cream filling is good but I think I will try it with almond extract next time.

I halved this recipe and baked it in a nine inch Pyrex because I needed to travel with it and didn't want it to get messed up. I used ganache instead of the filling or frosting. I stuck with the recipe for the torte, though, changing nothing. My dad and I both loved it - we could only eat one piece each with ice cream because it was so rich!!

I have been using this recipe for years...passed down from my grandfather...we refer to it as Big Daddy's chocolate cake...it is THE BEST!  Use Dutch processed cocoa (Penzeys is the closest I can find to good European cocoa)...VERY good.  I use my own frosting recipe...everyone who eats it simply raves!  If you love chocolate...try it out!

This recipe is amazing. I LOVED how it turned out. I did do a few alterations though.  I didn't make the filling or the frosting, but used ganache instead. I also only used two cake pans, so the layers were a bit thicker. I had to bake them for about 20 minutes more, but it was worth it. This cake has amazing flavor and texture!

I followed this recipe step by step. The only change I made was that I used hot coffee instead of of water as suggested by another review! It was long and difficult to make - I couldn't imagine making this without a Kitchen Aid mixer and it dirtied lots of dishes. I would suggest letting the cakes cool in the freezer before stacking them with the cream. I did let my cakes cool as the directions said, but when I stacked them with the cream, the cream just melted and everything started falling apart. I put it in the freezer for awhile before putting the icing on. When I pulled it out to put the icing on - the icing was hard to ice on the cake - kind of thick and it did not really look like the picture - mine was darker and did not look creamy like the picture. All in all though - it smelled to good to not eat and it did taste DELICIOUS!!!!!!!
