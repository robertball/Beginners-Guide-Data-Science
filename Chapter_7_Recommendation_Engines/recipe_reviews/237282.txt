This was very easy but a little more time consuming than I was expecting.  I sliced the onions instead of chopping them because I thought it would look prettier than the chopped on the appetizers I had planned to make.  I was delusional.  Ah well, it had good flavor.

I lost my onion jam recipe & was looking for a replacement. This fit the bill nicely! I used red onions, added a pinch of salt & cut the sugar down to about a tablespoon.. YUM!!!

Onions do not carmelize in 10 to 12 minutes, regardless of what the instructions say. Spend more time and actually carmelize the onions, and this will be so much better.

This sounds wonderful. Would like to make for gifts. Can it be canned?

this was okay--I have had better onion jam.  Maybe needed to boil down the vinegar more to thicken.  Still needed more flavor.
