This was great! I was very skeptical about the spice, but the kids loved it! There was not one noodle left! I added more franks sauce, used ranch instead of blue cheese dressing, I didn't have any rotini so I used rigatoni. It will definitely be made many times again!

Made a few changes for little more of a kick adding more buffalo sauce and actually swapped out the cream of chicken for cream cheese making it a lot more like the texture of chicken dip as opposed to the cream of chicken which can be over powering

Made this one for the family and it was a hit. We eat quite a bit of Buffalo hot type dishes so this one was a no brainer. I added quite a bit more than 2 tbl spoons of hot sauce and also a can of Cheddar Cheese soup to blend with the Cream of Chicken. I used a chunky blue cheese dressing (1/2 cup) and 2 small scoops of minced garlic from a jar. I always ask: 'is this a keeper'? The answer was a unanimous YES!

Came out great.  I thought the hot sauce would be too hot but that combo with the blue cheese worked perfect!  Great dish.

This turned out delicious!! i made this casserole for my boyfriend and we both loved it. Recipe is probably great as is, but I'm not a big blue cheese fan so I substituted ranch dressing. I also used 3 tablespoons of Frank's red hot sauce instead of cayenne pepper sauce. I bought a whole pre-cooked chicken from the grocery store to shred and save time. This was so easy and very tastey! I will definitely be making again!!

Love it, if you enjoy buffalo style chicken wings, you are going to love this, and the price is right too. We like spicy, so we add 6 tablespoons of franks sauce, yummmm.

i made chicken breast and thighs buffalo style and found this recipe looking for a dish for left overs. as the pepper sauce i used my favorite franks hot sauce, the only thing i would do different is add a little broth to this dish seemed a little dry. But will say i will make it again and my husband says best casserole ever!

Good everyday dinner, but not amazing. It was pretty dry even though I added some chicken broth and a little milk, maybe because I cooked my noodles aldente. If I made again, I will add enough liquid to make it a little sloppy going into the oven.  I used about a 1/3 of a bottle of the hot sauce and it still could have been spicer for us.

I opted for ranch dressing instead of blue cheese and did not add celery.  So good!

When my daughter was little one of our favorite meals was buffalo wings with noodles on the side, putting the buffalo sauce on the noodles. The other day I went looking for a casserole recipe with the same idea and found this one. MMM mmm. My daughter is somewhat lactose intolerant, so instead of the cr. of chicken soup I made a sauce with almond milk, flour,  and better than buillion, and used a dairy free ranch type dressing. Very good! Wan't spicy enough so I wound up using a cup of Frank's Red Hot sauce instead of 2 tablespoons. Such a keeper!

I made this for dinner for my boyfriend and he LOVED IT. Every single piece of the casserole was gone. The only thing we changed was using about half a bottle of Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce,(we like things spicy!) and about a cup more of cheese than the recipe called for. In all we loved this dish and will definitely be making it again! Thanks for sharing this recipe(:
