I only gave this 3 stars because it lacked the chopped boiled eggs and the sugar should be omitted since the miracle whip itself is sweet. Otherwise follow the recipe.

This is great!! I used frozen thawed peas instead of canned (salt intake) and it was wonderful! It gets requested at least once a week!

I make this recipe all the time with a few adjustments. I use iceberg lettuce as the first layer, then some shredded cheddar cheese, then the peas as the next layer, then the mircle whip/sugar on top of all that.  Then as the finale... I top with grated parmesean.  Put in refridgator to let tasts "marry".  This is sooo very good!!  And so very easy.

This is awesome.  I accidently hit the print button during a recipe finding marathon.  I had all the parts and decided why not.  It took 5 minutes to make tops.  This is now a weekly must have.  I think the yellow or white onions have a better flavor than the red.  I also use shredded cheddar but only for the texture.

Quick, easy, great taste, and cheap! Can't ask for more than that. It's much better made with thawed frozen peas, though. It's on my regular rotation for summer; we'll be eating this often.

This is a very easy-to-make recipe, and it usually gets good reviews when I take it to potlucks. I add chopped boiled eggs and don't use the sugar, however.

leave out the sugar. use mayo. season with black pepper. My first husband made this and I was horrified! And then decided was definately good and in comfort food category.  Frozen peas would work too, but the canned peas bring back memories of what we ate 50 years ago!

This was not a great pea salad recipe, although it was very easy.  Probably won't make it again.

I also used fresh frozen peas and "chunky" shredded cheese.  Wow, this is fast & easy and very yummy!  It's a great dish to take to a pot-luck or office gathering.

I changed this up a bit by using 12 ounces of frozen peas and mayo instead of Miracle Whip, other than that the recipe is unchanged. It's pretty tasty and I'll make it again using my tweaks. Thanks for submitting it.

im probably rating this wrong because based on what was in the work pantry i loosely used this recipe. i upped the peas to six cans because it was going to be served at a potluck tree lighting. i didnt have the cheese so i omitted it and added 3 boiled eggs and i had to use regular mayo. there was about 1/3 of the bowl left and i saw it on a few plates. i think this is an acquired taste.

I think this is great as is.  Super easy to make which is always a plus.  There are so many variations of this that people will always put their own spin on it.  For extra flair, and calories, you can add crumbled bacon and hard boiled eggs.  But I don't think that it needs it.  Simple, easy, tasty and something different to add to a meal!  Thanks!

I was craving pea salad and this was perfect! I add chopped sweet pickles, and eggs to mine. I didn't put the cheese in because... well I didn't want to. One batch is never enough for my family...

This is a good base for a pea salad. I went over the top and added a few things. First, I used thawed frozen peas and shredded mild cheddar (wife hates sharp,)onion (go easy,) and added a package of Imitation Crab (chopped large,) and omitted the sugar. I whipped up the dressing separate using Miracle Whip, a couple of spoons of sour cream (I don't measure anything...) basil infused EVOO, and a few dashes of Red Wine Vinegar. After tossing the peas, crab, onion, and cheese together, I folded in the dressing and chilled it for 3 hours. I was great! I called it a crab pea salad! lol!

I changed it up a bit,I used celery along with the onion,and bacon bits,I substituted ranch dressing for the miracle whip,if I hadn't been under the weather I would have boiled some eggs to put in it,then it would have been at least 4 stars.

I made this pea salad for the 4th of July. Everyone loved it, and it was completely gone! Thanks for sharing. It was delicious. The only thing I did different was I added 1 hard boiled egg. YUMMY!!!

This was a little blah. We added macaroni and bacon on top to give it more flavor. I probably wouldn't make this again.

So easy and so perfect for a Bar-B-Q side!  Didn't add the sugar the second time, and it tasted just as good.  With the salad dressing mayo, I don't think it is necessary.

Was really really good.  I used shredded cheese, but I think next time I will use small cubed cheese.  My husband even liked it and he NEVER eats peas.  I talked him into trying and he liked it.

This is a quick simple recipe to through together.  I used Hellman’s Mayo with olive oil. I also added a tablespoon of bacon bits. Used only a quarter of the sugar.

I added boiled eggs in addition to the other ingredients.  Also, added bacon bits as a garnish right before serving.  My husband loved it.  Will make again.

Canned peas are disgusting, no matter what the recipe.  Use fresh or thawed frozen peas.   
I love Miracle Whip.   I also love a similar  salad that uses mayonnaise, red wine vinegar and sugar.  It's like the dressing you put on Cole Slaw or Broccoli Salad.  
Definitely use the cheddar as recipe states.  Never trust a salad with American Cheese. My daughter wants to chop up some water chestnuts to put in this.

This was too sweet and nobody could eat it.. However, I tried it again with Hellman's mayo and just diced onions and shredded cheddar cheese... This was gone in minutes.. I also used frozen peas instead of canned..

Since I wanted something different as a side for tonight, whipped this up quickly before work this morning. The only dressing I had on hand was Thousand Island, and I used white instead of sweet onion. Also didn't have chunks of cheddar, so I used some shredded instead. Very nice! I'll have to make this for our next gathering at church or work.

It's a good base for pea salad, but I have always put minced ham or bacon in mine, and I use mayonnaise if adding sugar or use miracle whip, and I always use chopped peanuts in mine alone with chopped egg along with the ingredients already listed, and always use frozen thawed peas. They taste so fresh, but,like I said, it's a very good base to start pea salad.

Inedible with the CANNED PEAS! It probably would have been fine if fresh or frozen were used. I cannot imagine a recipe that ever called for canned peas, especially used in a cold salad. Terrible!

This is a refreshing salad for summer.  I added chunks of ham just to change it up a little.
