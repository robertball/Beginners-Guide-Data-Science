I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving last week and it was awesome. I used 5 large sweet potatoes, peeled and boiled, so the casserole would not be dessert-sweet (and so I'd have more leftovers!). It was the perfect flavor. The pecan topping provides a great crunch. I'll be making this every year!!

A wonderful receipe.  I made this for Thanksgiving and my mother-in-law made her version.  My recipe won hands down (not that I am counting :)  I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the evaporated milk.  The only thing I would change would to put it in a larger dish so I could double the recipe for the topping because people really liked that part of it.  The family thought it was the best recipe for sweet potatoes ever!

i have been making this type of sweet potatoes for a long time; love it love it. i however use a lot less sugar, maybe 1/3 cup st most, sometimes don't use the milk, and sprinkle a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg on top before putting on the topping. yummy yummy.

This is the best sweet potato casserole recipe here!  I have used this recipe for the last 3 years, and every year I have to keep making more and more.  I have yet to find anyone who didn't like it.

I used 2 29 oz cans of sweet potatoes, drained and mashed them, then followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It turned out great! A big hit with everyone!

You would have to be CRAZY not to try this! It is sooooo good. It just makes the sweet potato- marshmallow combination so lack-luster. You simply must try this... you will not regret it!

This is it. For always and forever, this is going to be the sweet potato casserole around our home! Off the charts, five stars simply doesn't do it justice.

Made a couple of minor changes:

1.  Used canned yams, drained.
2.  Used a lot less sugar, because of the canned yams.  I started out with a 1/3 cup and kept adding for taste.
3.  Used unwhipped whipping cream as I forgot to get evaporated milk. Worked fabulously.
4.  Before putting on pecan streusel, dusted the top with cinnamon.  
5.  Made even more topping, as suggested by others.

These changes were more about what I had in the house, rather than any problem with the recipe.

Thanksgiving guests went wild over it.  

Look no more, this is THE recipe for holiday meals!  Thanks for sharing it!

Lovely recipe, but cut down the sugar! I used half a cup brown for the topping, 1/4 cup white in the bottom. I left out the butter for the bottom. Before adding the topping, I sprinkled with nutmeg and cinnamon. Delish!

This has recipe has become a holiday staple for my family. I was looking for a good non-marshmallow version and this is it! I started making it last year for Thanksgiving, made it again for Xmas (per hubby's ardent request) and will do so again this year. I think 'as is' for  me would be too sweet so I cut the white sugar way back - to about 1/3 cup and its perfection. Can't take a star off for that being that its sooooooo good and If super sweet is your thing go with a cup!

I don't really care for sweet potatoes, but these I devoured one easter many years ago. My sister insisted even if I hated sweet potatoes that i would love these. What do you know? She was right!! The only thing I do different is double the recipe and make 1/3 more topping than the recipe calls for. Hate sweet potatoes? Try this one and you'll never be able to say that again!! :)

I customized this but that was mostly just tweaking so I gave the recipe 4 stars since it was a great starting place.  I used one 29oz can of sweet potatoes. I put them in the microwave for about a minute and then mashed them up. I cut the white sugar to 1/3c and used 1/2 stick butter. And I used skim milk. For the topping I used the other 1/2 stick of butter. And I put the whole thing into pie plate instead of a 9x13. My boyfriend and I liked it with these modifications but we thought the topping was a little too sweet. Next time I'll cut the brown sugar to 1/2 c.

My mother-in-law made this recipe for Thanksgiving and I couldn't stop eating it!  Yesterday I made it for company and they used words like: delicious, wonderful and amazing to describe it while they were eating! My husband (who claims to be allergic to all vegetables:) tried it and went back for thirds!

This was good but so sweet we decided it could be a breakfast casserole for people who eat donuts for breakfast. Not a vegetable dish for my family.

Very good, not too sweet, just right.  The only thing I will add next time I make it will be cinnamon and nutmeg.

This was actually really good.  I gave it 4 stars because I personally thought it was way too sweet.  My husband loved it though.  I think when I make it again, I'll reduce the sugar (both white and brown).  Also, I didn't put the pecans in it because we didn't have them and we aren't really pecan people.

I am the biggest fan of sweet things.... jellybeans, candycorns, etc.  But this recipe is just TOO sweet, it would make a great dessert - but not a vegetable side-dish.

I don't think anyone especially cared for this casserole.  It had a bland flavor and a strange, chunky texture.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.

I was looking for a recipe like the one my mom used to make.  This one wasn't exactly it, but still pretty good.  My only disappointment was that it was a little bit soupier than I like.

I actually made this recipe twice this past Thanksgiving and will be making it again this Christmas by high demand.  The only thing I would suggest is adding an extra potato or two or not so much sugar or vanilla.  I did that the second time around and it was fantastic. I also barely mashed the potato. more or less just mixed a little.  It's a texture thing with me.

I made this recipe this past Thanksgiving for the first time, and it was super great! I took it to a family gathering and everyone had second servings, or third. The only change: I used Splenda instead of white sugar. Fabulous!

AMAZING. no one could stop eating it. the topping is like pralines. next time i will not add 1 cup sugar to the potato mixture, maybe  1/2 a cup. oh, and i added some cinnamon and nutmeg to tast in the potato mixture too. just delicious. and also, i mixed it all in the food processor for a very smooth texture.

Very good and everyone really liked.  I also made changes based on other reviews and added only about 1/4 c. sugar to taste.  I did not want it overly sweet or dessert like.  Instead of evaporated milk, I used half and half.

It's a big hit! I always wanted to make a sweet potato recipe yet thought it would be hard. So glad I found this!  I made it for thanksgiving dinner, the recipe was easy to follow with simple ingredients. I did add a dash of cinnamon to the mashed sweet potatoes. It was so delicious.  It did make a big batch (I was only serving 3). However, the leftovers won't last, long!

I am required to bring this every year for Thanksgiving.  Like others, I skip the white sugar and I also use canned yams or sweet potatoes.  I just rinse them thoroughly to get rid of the syrup.
