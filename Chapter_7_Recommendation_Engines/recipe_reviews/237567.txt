I am allergic to garlic, so I skipped that.  This is good reheated, too.  I squeezed the spinach to get additional liquid out (about 1/2 cup) and I believe that eliminated the extra water in the pan after baking.  I used my toaster over and left it in for 30 minutes.  I used a stoneware casserole dish.  I used 2% low fat cottage cheese.  I highly recommend this recipe.  All good nutrients!

I have made this twice.  The first time I made it as written and it was ok but not that interesting.  I made it the second time because I had cottage cheese that I had to use. I added diced sweet onion and a dash of cayenne.   I think I will use whipped cottage cheese in the future for a better texture.  Thanks, Mandie.

to be honest I wasn't expecting to like this.  it was more of a "what can I make with the stuff I have now" type of recipe.  I was truly surprised how much my family and I liked it.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen so I am not sure how much of a difference it had made, but it was tasty and we will make it again

I really like this. I used Daisy 2% low-fat cottage cheese and added the garlic powder, salt, and pepper before cooking. So glad I added the optional garlic powder. It gave this a great flavor. I ended up cooking it about 35 minutes. After I cut it, there was a very small pool of liquid in the bottom of the dish and on the plates that took away from the appearance just a little. This might not have happened had I used a full fat cottage cheese. I made this for a side to salmon, but I see enjoying it for lunch too.

This was a good recipe and tastes similar to souffle.  I would probably add some nutmeg or something to make the seasoning more interesting but it is a good recipe for variety in your veggies!

I had made this recipe before and relaized that It was a good 4 star but didn't rate it . This time, I had fresh spinach from my garden , therefore I carmalized some onions and saut√©ed my spinach instead. 

As per other reviewers , I add Garlic powder ( my family loves garlic) and a good 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.

Came out wonderful , but still a little liquid on the bottom .

Being a vegetarian, it's very hard to find good recipes with protein in them, but this one is excellent! I added some onions, Cilantro and feta for extra flavor! You can even throw it all in a slow cooker overnight for the next morning

Although I haven't made this particular recipe, it's identical (plus one egg) to my recipe for lasagna filling, which I love love love.  Never thought to bake it on its own.

It was good, but bland.  The second time I made it, I added dried onion, garlic salt, dried jalapeno, and mixed salad herbs and an extra sprinkle of Parmesan on top.

This was very easy and delicious...I did add about a half cup of shredded mozzarella to the mix and sprinkled a little more on the top before baking.

Being a meat eater who is married to a man raised not eating meat , I have tried many meat free recipes. The all time best is one similar to this one. Every  meat eating person I have shared it with was blown away at how good it is and that it looks like meat. It's  called cottage cheese loaf and is a big favorite in the Adventist church world. Me, the farm raised meat eater stands by the oven waiting for it to come out. 1 lrg cottage cheese, 1 med onion chopped, 5 eggs, 3 pkgs George Washington brown broth, 1 and 1/2 cups pecans, 1 stick melted butter. Mix all then add 5 cups special k. Bake at 350 for 45-50 min in a 9x9 dish, ps the GW broth is vegetarian as well. Its wonderful cold on bread with mayo.

I've made this several times:  bland (just salt and pepper, no garlic), with onions & garlic, with Herbs de Provence seasoning, with cilantro and chipotle seasoning.  It's always delicious, especially with fresh spinach or any other green (chard, beet tops, etc.).  I use 4% high fat cottage cheese.  Once I used Philadelphia Cream Cheese, another time I grated up several odd pieces of different kind of cheese.  I consider the given recipe to be a bland base that you can butter up, spice up, switch up, or doctor up.

This was delicious and so easy to make. Though I've added a bit too much salt, but it came out delicious from the oven. I've made for last night's dinner and topped it with Aldi's Italian bread crumbs for the toasted bread crumbs. Delicious! I would make it again for sure.

Easy - just be sure to drain excess water from spinach.  Great flavor.  Tastes good as leftovers if you refrigerate and microwave.

Great recipe! Even my cottage cheese hating family liked it.
I used the Lactaid cottage cheese which is  4%. I also left out the added salt as it is still very salty. I will try cutting down the parmesan next time. I used the Costco Organic grated parmesan cheese which is very flavorful.
A high protein dish. I calculated at 192 calories a serving.

First of all let me say, I hate cottage cheese (the texture).  Secondly, this was wonderful.  I added chopped cilantro and scallions, as was suggested in the magazine.  Baking this changed everything!!!!  I baked it in individual ramekins but I see online that you can bake in a cake tin which might be easier for larger crowds.

Healthy alternative breakfast. I doubled up on the eggs, it didnt look like enough but I did half the eggs just whites. I minced in a few green onions and added a sprinkle of cayenne. Very tasty. I used fresh baby spinach, wasnt too watery but you have to expect the cottage cheese to expell a little.

If you like spinach, this is an easy and quick recipe for a side-dish.  Experiment with spices to improve it, but it's good as written.  I used the leftovers as a side-dish with my eggs at breakfast, and I liked this dish even better than for dinner.

We really enjoy how simple and light this tasted.  Great side with a spicy main course and so easy.  I cut the parmesan back to 1/4 cup because that's all I had and used 1/4 tsp each garlic powder, salt and pepper.  We will definatly be making this again and my BF doesn't even like cottage cheese.

Easy to make, will probably bake again.  Soupier than I expected after 45 minutes cook time.  I could have done a better job of squeezing out the spinach...

This recipe is a breakfast staple at my house. I rated it 5 stars because it's so simple and so good. I season with garlic powder and salt and pepper before baking.
