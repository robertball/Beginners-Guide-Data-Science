Made this following the recipe and we really liked it. Next time I will substitute some chicken stock for some of the milk. The seasonings gave it a real fajita flavour.

I ended up using a fajita mix packet and added the spices it said to in the recipe, by eye. I also made the pasta separate and added seasoning and cheese to it after to have it cheesy and a little spiced. Doing it the way I did it will end up in thick saucy pasta and chicken though. If you prefer a little bit of a thick creamy sauce try this maybe.

This was really bland, I don't know why. I halved the pasta and used a little extra chicken.

The amount of chili powder is too high. Use 1/2 half tsp instead.
