So happy so many people like this recipe. Just to address a couple of issues some people are having:

When making the recipe I used ground turkey which was a mixture of white and dark meat. This not only helped add flavor but it also added moisture that helped it to not become crumbly. Adding an extra egg is also a great way to bind it even more and hey! Extra protein!

Secondly, this meatloaf is meant to be free-formed on a flat pan. Ground turkey and ground beef cook two different ways.  Beef tends to give off a considerable amount of fat and a little juice making it ok (although not at all healthy) to cook it in a loaf pan soaking in its oils.... turkey and chicken on the other hand give off a lot of moisture and very little fat, so basically when you cook it in a loaf pan it is steaming and soaking in turkey water, making for a mushy fall-aparty (yes i made that word up) loaf.

I hope this helps some of the future folk who make this recipe.

I doubled the recipe and took it to a potluck and it went over very well!  Cooked Quinoa in chicken broth and added tomato paste to top.  It was very good.  Making it again tonight and will add an additional egg to the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!  this is a fantastic recipe!

This recipe is a family favorite! I love quinoa and I'm constantly trying to find different ways to use it.   I do a couple different things with this recipe, just for my own personal taste.  -I leave out the hot sauce, since I have 2 small children, but I add some on top of my serving.  -I add 1 cup of grated cheese to the meatloaf, I like the extra flavor and it moistens it up a bit.  -I haven't yet tried the topping for this recipe because I love my old one too much. 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. ketchup, 1 Tbsp Mustard and a few splashes of Worchestershire.  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed!

This was awesome. I used bbq sauce instead of hot sauce and the flavor was perfect.

I am always looking for new ways to prepare ground turkey and this meatloaf is one of the best!  Perfect combination of flavors and loved the texture.  I made this for my very picky husband who raved about it.  Next time I make this (and there will be a next time) I will add a little cheese...maybe cheddar. But do yourself a healthy favor and make this recipe.

Thank you for a recipe that lets me serve meatloaf again!  I haven't used ground beef for about 12 years and miss a good meatloaf.  My poultry-hating hubby LOVED this meatloaf and asked me to make a double recipe next time so he could have a meatloaf sandwich the next day.  To round out the menu I served it with baked sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli.  It was a wonderful family meal.

This was the BEST meatloaf I have ever eaten!  The only change that I made was to scale back the hot sauce to 1/2 TB for my kiddo.  The whole family went back for seconds.  Thank you for a wonderful nutritious meal.

I LOVED this!  The quinoa is a fantastic flavour in the mix (and an excellent protein source), even my very picky roommate loved it and 3 hours later is still raving about it.   I added diced zucchini to the recipe and instead of hot pepper sauce I used sweet chili sauce which gave it a wonderful zip, but not too overpowering.  Absolutely lovely!

Fantastic!  I couldn't believe how much kick came from the 1 T. of hot sauce though, might scale it back next time for the kiddos.  But wonderful meatloaf!!  Loved it!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe and so do all of our friends that we've made it for.  I use 1lb ground turkey thigh (not as dry as breast) that I can get at Whole Foods.  I make meatloaf balls in a muffin pan which I bake at 350 for 30.  Great way to make them for lunches or stick in the freezer and take them out as needed.

This produced a moist and tender 'meatloaf'. I didn't find that the quinoa added any noticeable flavor. What I really didn't like was how the hot sauce overwhelmed this recipe. It was all we could taste (the spiciness wasn't a problem, just the one dimensional flavor). This could be made so much better and given more dimension with the right mix of herbs and spices. It's a good solid start but needs a bit of work.

DELISH!!  I follwed the directions fairly closely except I added 1 TBS of rosemary to meat mixture, used only 1 TBS of brown sugar instead of 2 in the paste.  Then cooked in 6 cupcake tins for 40 mins.  Then popped them out, turned them over and cooked for 5 mins just to get ride of some of the moisutre.  Will definitely make again.  Way to go Drew!!

This was a great twist on traditional meatloaf - and healthier too! Served with baked sweet potato and sauteed brussel sprouts.

I was looking for a ways to use quinoa and came across this recipe. In that regard, this recipe is great. What a terrific way to have quinoa. I gave 4 stars because my husband and I both felt that it was a little bit too sweet. If I make this again I would probably omit the brown sugar and maybe add some mustard.

Absolutely delicious! The whole family really enjoyed this dish. I didn’t add any hot sauce because I wanted this dish to be “kid friendly”, so I did add 1 1/2-Tbsp of BBQ sauce and a dash of liquid smoke flavoring instead. I also had to add 1/3 cup of Panko breadcrumbs because I thought it needed to be a little firmer. For the toping I made my own recipe: ¼ cup ketchup, 1 Tbsp brown sugar, 2 tsp Dijon mustard and 2 dashes liquid smoke flavoring. Thanks for sharing this great recipe Drew!!!
10/04/11: Drew, I was just printing your recipe to make it again and noticed that you are in Pembroke Pines, FL. Can't believe we are so close! I'm just all the way East from you, as I live very close to the beach. I make this recipe quite often, we all love it. Thanks again!

Made this when my mother-in-law and sister-in-law were coming over for dinner. I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did! Had I made it as stated, I'd probably have no leftovers and I really want to enjoy this for a couple of days! This will definitely become a regular menu item!

AWESOME. Seriously great. 
I subbed BBQ sauce for the hot sauce as I have little ones. Also added one small diced zuchinni for an extra veggie punch and moisture. LOVED IT. Served with hot sauce for the adults...AWESOME.

This is great and easy just as written.  The hot sauce makes this so tasty.  We eat a lot of quinoa so I make a big batch and freeze it in 4oz servings.  I use it just like I would "instant rice".  Since I'm cooking for two, I made 4 loaves shaped like footballs.  We eat two and  have  an extra meal for later.  Like the quinoa, this freezes really well.  Just remember to adjust your cooking time.  I started checking after a half hour with a thermometer.  I also made the topping a little runny.  I made little troughs in the loaves, about the size of a pencil, and poured the topping in those.  The sauce seeped into the meat and wow!  Think I will double the topping next time!    One more thought.  Try baking the meatlof in a cupcake pan.  This way you have little kid size portions.  Thanks for the recipe, Drew, it will go on our table many a time.

Yum! Definitely a good alternative to traditional meatloaf and I always love quinoa. Instead of the brown sugar glaze, I did a ketchup & Worcestershire glaze with a smidge of sriracha because my family doesn't have a sweet tooth (and I don't usually keep sugar in the house). I also doubled the quinoa because I am always trying to stretch a recipe as far as I can, it didn't make the recipe any less moist. My 7 year olds and my husband both LOVED it. Served with roasted sweet potatoes & Brussels sprouts.

I enjoyed this recipe a lot.  There is a bit of a kick to it due to the hot sauce; it's not tongue-searing hot by any means, but it's a consideration if you're feeding it to kids.  I thought the 1 egg was enough to bind the meatloaf mixture, but it is important that you let the meatloaf stand at least 10 minutes before cutting it up so that it has the best chance of holding its shape when sliced (which was done easily with a serrated knife).  All in all, it was one of the better recipes for meatloaf that I cooked up, and I think I'll keep it in the dinner rotation.

Wow, this was really good!  What an interesting way to make a gluten-free meatloaf.  I added green onion along with the regular onion and baked my meatloaf in individual silicon muffin trays since to me the most annoying thing about meatloaf is how long it takes to bake all the way through.  With the muffin sizes, overall bake time was only about 30 minutes instead of 50 and they just popped right out.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

If I could give this 10 stars I would--This is my family's new favorite meatloaf!  You can't go wrong by using whole grain instead of breadcrumbs.  The quinoa gave this a fabulous bite and texture, and it is seasoned extremely well.  I added chives from the garden for color, and next time, will probably top it with BBQ sauce.  **It's really important to not use ground turkey breast because it will turn out too dry and colorless.  A winner for sure!  Thanks for sharing!

This meatloaf is incredible!  Even my hubby who is a self-proclaimed meatloaf hater loved it!  I made it following the recipe exactly, and the only complaint I have is that it was too salty.  Other than the amount of salt, I wouldn't change a thing!

Where do I start?  Um, WOW... This recipe has totally restored my faith in healthy food.  The only thing I changed was omitting the brown sugar as I am on a low-no sugar diet.  This was my first time using quinoa and I loved it.  I almost felt a little naughty eating it...this meatloaf will be a go-to recipe for a long time!

This was very good, it tasted different from beef meatloaf, but still very good. I was short on time, so I actually made this in muffin cups. I put a small piece of bread in the bottom of each cup (to soak up juices) and then the meat mixture, baked for 15-20min. The kids loved it, I would make this again.

This is an excellent recipe. I've made it a number of times using turkey, or ground chicken breast, I even tried half turkey/half tofu and it was excellent. Love quinoa instead of breadcrumbs (which I can't have). I used ketchup instead of tomato paste and tabasco sauce for heat. Instead of egg I used chia seeds in water (as a replacer) and added some ground flaxseeds to the mix too. Thanks Drew !

Loved it!  I subbed the hot sauce for bbq sauce and added a tad of honey instead of the brown sugar.  Turned out great.  Next time I will use bbq sauce on top instead of honey/Worcestershire sauce

Use this basic meat for filling peppers...use tomato soup and a can of diced tomatoes...yup, leave the sugar in this.. I cook carrots, celery, and taters in the soup/peppers...my gosh makes a great (!!!) soup afterwords. Just smash all leftovers together. Thin with more soup, tomato juice, milk, or water...to taste..

Very good.  Very moist.  I had 1 lb of ground turkey and left the rest of the ingredients the same.  I used Tiger Sauce for the pepper sauce - 1 tbs for 1 lb of meat still wasn't too much.  Also, I was really surprised by how much the quinoa flavored the meatloaf.  We are quinoa lovers. =]  I recommend and will make this again.

lAt first, I was afraid to try this because I love my old "bread crumb" meatloaf, but this was absolutely perfect and will become our "fave meatloaf recipe" now.      Just could not believe how good it was    I bought the quinoa for the first time organic and then read somewhere on line that you need to soak it and rinse it because there is a coating on it that can be bitter tasting and also have a laxative effect, so trust me we soaked the quinoa first for a couple hours and then rinsed it over and over before cooking it.    Turned out perfect.  INCREDIBLE RECIPE!!!!!  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS!!!!!   LOVE Allrecipes and since retiring this is my favorite internet site!!!

My girlfriend made this for a dinner party. It was fantastic!!! Even my husband was impressed. This is my new favorite meatloaf. I've loved meatloaf since I was a child, but this one rocks the plate! So good, wonderful texture. Not doughy or mushy. Simply put, one of the best meatloafs I've ever had! It'll make a great sandwich. I should have brought some home :)

This is the BEST meatloaf I've ever made! I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so I substituted teriyaki sauce. I also didn't have tomato paste, so I used ketchup. It was so moist and delicious, and super easy to make. You can change this up - it is a no-fail recipe! My family loved it!

Good flavor...would definately make again. Only change i would make is to cut the amount of salt.  Mine turned out way salty, but other than that no other changes.

Tasty + very easy to make + healthy = 5 stars!  Made the following changes: 2 packages of ground chicken (~20 oz total) because store didn't have turkey; 1/2 cup quinoa boiled in 1 cup chicken stock; 2 eggs; 2 tbsp homemade bbq sauce instead of hot pepper sauce; 1 tbsp ketchup instead of tomato paste; halved the salt and pepper measurements; topped with bbq sauce instead of brown sugar mixture.  I prepped everything (in about 20 minutes) before beach vball and refrigerated the mixture.  When I came home, I preheated the oven to 350F, sprayed a foiled lined baking sheet with PAM, shaped the mixture into a flattish rectangular loaf and topped with bbq sauce, then popped in the oven for 50 minutes.  We ate it with mashed potatoes, yum!  Makes 4 generous servings.  I love how easy it is to prep and the great taste!  Will definitely make again.

I put off making this recipe as I just never have any quinoa in the house, but this past weekend I noticed a box of it at the grocery store and added it to my cart.  I am so happy that I did!  This recipe was incredibly moist and flavorful and perfectly seasoned.  At my house it made enough for 4 adult and 2 toddler sized portions (only because I filled up on veggies in order to keep myself from eating seconds ... and thirds).  Using a nutritional powerhouse like quinoa in place of breadcrumbs makes me feel great about serving this to my family.  I plan to make a few more batches this weekend to stock in my deep freeze for lazy dinners in the near future :)

This was easy, delicious, and probably the healthiest meatloaf I've ever made! I don't think I ever made a meatloaf without having to use breadcrumbs before this, and I liked the texture of the quinoa.

This meatloaf turned out great - not dry, flavorful, and made great leftovers.  I cut the brown sugar a little for the paste, as I'm not a big fan of sweet things unless it's dessert.  The quinoa truly was a "secret" ingredient, adding some texture.

Very delicious and easy to make just have to plan to begin prep a couple hours before you want to eat. I wanted to add more veggies to this to make it even healthier so I just threw a few handfuls of spinach (maybe a 1 1/2 cup packed) into the pan after sauteing the onions and before adding the garlic. The texture was perfect and did not fall apart from the addition of spinach.

This was great, the quinoa added a great texture.  Maybe too much hot sauce.  I would scale it back to half a tablespoon or a teaspoon.  Other than that, great recipe.

This was delicious!  I made exactly as is, except with ground chicken since it was on sale, and brown sugar splenda blend to cut down on sugar.  Next time I will probably use a loaf pan just to keep the shape and so the topping stays on top (maybe next time I will also use less water for the topping).  I've been trying to find a way to sneak quinoa into our meals - I love it but my husband thinks it's gross.  He had no idea this meal was so healthy : )  Thanks Drew!

LOVED This recipe. Even my picky traditional-meatloaf-loving boyfriend loved it! I made a couple changes. I used BBQ sauce instead of hot sauce. I also cooked quinoa in chicken broth instead of water. Also... In an effort to make it slightly more "healthy", I used about 1 tbs of honey instead of brown sugar for glaze. Turned out GREAT! Tons of flavor! Highly recommend!

I make this recipe about once a week now.  It is outstanding, and I especially love that it doesn't taste healthy!  You MUST try this!  The only thing I would be cautious about is using 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt.  I did this and it was way too salty.  This last time, i used about 1/4 teaspoon of salt and it turned out perfect!

This was delicious!  Even my picky husband liked it (a HUGE plus).  I will be making this again, and most likely will double the recipe so I can freeze a loaf, as I know we will be having this more often.

I was short on time, so I made them into patties instead, and poured the sauce on top just before taking them off the stove. My family loved them. Will make a regular.

This recipe was a huge disappointment to my whole family. I followed the directions precisely, but it was too salty, too spicy, and too sweet. In addition, it was so soggy that it was meat mush instead of meatloaf. I really wanted to love this recipe, but it was unpalatable.

A very moist and tasty meatloaf. I did change the glaze as per others to a mix of ketchup sauce, a spicy bbq sauce and Worcestershire. Everything else was the same...more garlic though because I am a garlic addict. I loved the quinoa and ground turkey together - no one would ever know they were being fed healthy food! hehe. Great recipe and mix of ingredients! Thanks!!

I realy liked it...the texture was great, and it just is a healthier variation to the classic ground beef meatloaf.  When it was almost done, on day 2, I sliced it up and made a sandwich!!  One thing I realized I didn't have when I was preparing it was the tomato paste, so I used ketchup...the tabasco in this recipe realy gives this a balanced taste.  Ground turkey on it's own can be bland in comparison to ground beef, so the tabasco and  worcestershire is a must in this recipe.  I scaled down the hot sauce abit...I was scared it would be too spicy.  I also added about 2/3 cup of homemade bread crumbs.  Overall, this is nice, low in fat, lots of flavour, and I'll be making it often!!

Very easy to make and leftovers make for great sandwiches!

I made one 3 days ago, and another one tonight.  And there's only 2 of us eating!!  

I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce.  Also, recipe says 50 mins, but the inside isn't 160 degrees until about 65 mins.  Pull it once it's 160 or it'll dry out.

Wowie! This is a DARN good meatloaf!!! I am happy to have FINALLY found a DECENT turkey loaf recipe (I've tried many...). My only reason for giving this 4 *'s is b/c my "picky" hubby wasn't a fan. I don't consider myself a health nut, but am trying to adapt to that lifestyle. I've heard of quinoa before, but never tried it. And, although I seem to like it, I think I prefer breadcrumbs instead. I too cooked my quinoa in (chicken) broth to enhance its flavor. My only other changes were to add ~ 3/4 c. shredded reduced-fat cheddar cheese & substitute chile sauce for hot sauce (I was afraid my loaf would be too spicy otherwise). I will NOT add cheese next time (there WILL be a next time!) since most of it oozed out anyways. I assembled my "loaf" yesterday, refrigerated it overnite & then had my hubby put it in the oven when he got home from work so that dinner would be ready when I got home. NOTE: I purchased a box of Roland brand quinoa which was specifically labeled as having been "pre-washed." This step removes the naturally occurring bitter coating, saponin. Served w/ mashed sweet potatoes, garlic green beans & dinner rolls, this was a FANTASTIC MEAL! Other than subbing breadcrumbs for quinoa, omitting the glaze (hubby didn't like THAT either argh!!!) & serving w/ gravy instead, I wouldn't change a thing about this. Thanks SO much for sharing, Drew! :-)

This was excellent! I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth with dehydrated onions and a couple of crushed garlic cloves.  I also only added a couple of shakes of worcetershire in the meat mixture and I used katsup, brown sugar and a couple more shakes of worcetershire for the glaze. Superb!

It's such a satisfying feeling to enjoy a moderately reviewed recipe with an alluring  star grade. This dish is one you will want to pass along to family and friends who normally don't think healthy and delicious is ever synonymously  possible.  With good direction and great balance and pairing of ingredients this recipe was easy and almost fun to put together. Great flavour is apparent with the very first bite. Soon we were all doing the "nodding with mouths full" dance. Thanks for posting Drew. Loved it!

This meatloaf is very good!  The quinoa def. gives it a nutty taste and the brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce gives it a great sweet and full bodied flavor! My fiance LOVED it!!!!

I am giving this a four star due to the potential of this dish.  I took reviewer's advise and used two eggs, so my dish was firm and kept the shape.  I doubled the topping and used half tomato paste and half ketchup.  Still very bland dish.   A  spice is missing, and I can not place my finger on it.  I MAY try this again simply due to the healthy factor.  I will try adding mushrooms? zucchini? more onion?  herbs?

I followed this recipe to the letter and I LOVED it!  The combination of hot sauce and the brown sugar coating gave it a wonderful sweet/sour taste.  Usually turkey tends to be dry and kind've tasteless, but the combination of ingredients in this makes the taste and texture wonderful.  I will definitely be making this one again; it was better than regular ground beef meatloaf!

Very tasty. I didn't have Worcestershire so I did modify a bit (I used soy sauce, tamarind paste, and cider vinegar as substitute). I also put in some rosemary because I love rosemary. Mine was great and I imagine being true to the recipe will be just as excellent. The quinoa was a great idea to use in this. I cooked the quinoa in beef broth for added flavor.

I thought this was really really tasty.  Very moist and had a beefy flavor.  I found it a bit too salty, so I'd cut down on the salt next time. I guess the hot sauce adds enough salt.  I didn't find this to be spicy at all.  I did add a tbsp of tomato paste to the topping, because I though it needed it.  I might put even more tomato paste next time, that's a nice complementary flavor.  Turkey and quinoa- great idea!!!

Just made this and the fam loved it! My two sensitive pallets didn’t even realize the hot sauce was in it. Next time round I’ll make a more “traditional” glaze to go on top. We cooked ours in the smoker for about 45 min. The quinoa was a great addition that added to the consistency, so much so that it but perfectly and was way more easy to serve up than our regular meatloaf (a ground beef/sausage mix). I believe we’ve found our go to.

I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth for extra flavor. Also, used agave syrup instead of the brown sugar. It was delicious. Family loved it and said to make it again.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever had. Not to mention a great way to get quinoa in my family's diet. I left out the sugar because you really don't need it. Why ruin a perfectly healthy meatloaf with sugar? I "double" it by just making it with 2lbs of ground turkey and double everything else too. My kids and husband LOVE it and they are stingy with compliments. I also put them on one baking pan lined with wax paper and make them into 6-7 individual loafs. Makes it quicker to cook and less like one huge blob.

I actually would do 4.5 stars.  I used finely chopped green pepper and garlic for inside because it's what I had.  Otherwise I followed everything but added an extra egg from some of the comments I read thinking it would help hold it together.  Eh, it didn't.  It was pretty crumbly.  I did it on the baking sheet like described and it seemed plenty moist when I put it in.  I think perhaps the baking time was too long and I should have checked it at 40 minutes.  The kids were not fans but for hubby and I - we'd make it again.  I like adding the quinoa for extra nutrition.

We don't eat much ground meat and I've NEVER made meatloaf, but for some reason, this recipe caught my eye.  I expected we'd have to order pizza once we tasted it, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This will be in our rotation of meals.  I made it exactly as the recipe was originally written.

This is one of the few recipes that I don't mess with - it is just so good!  I cook extra quinoa and use the rest to make a quinoa salad, to serve with the meatloaf.  Leftovers are delicious on sandwiches with hummus and a bit of mayonnaise.

Using other cooks' notes, I used bbq sauce instead of hot sauce. But! Since I only had Korean BBQ sauce on hand and it worked GREAT! I also used 2 eggs. Next time I am going to try to cook then on a rack on a flat pan so they don't bake in their own "goop" Overall, a great recipe!

I used ground dark turkey meat because it was cheaper. It still turned out kind of dry but it did taste good. I might try using a loaf pan next time. Also, the meat needs more seasoning, some sort of herbs or something but I would definitely make this again.

Really good! Great, bold, fairly traditional flavor. Doesn't have an alternative/healthier/whole grain vibe about it like some recipes that are an acquired taste. Made a great sandwich with leftovers the next day. I'll be making it one of my regulars!

Best.  Meatloaf.  Ever.

Cooking the quinoa requires a little more effort but it's worth it.  We never have leftovers.  Meatloaf I don't feel guilty about it and it's freaking DELICIOUS!

Excellent. I followed this recipe exactly other than I used dried minced onion and bottled garlic. The meat mixture is very wet so shape it somewhat in the bowl and as you dump it on to the baking sheet.

LOVE this one! I made it exactly as written as I usually try to do the first time I try something--this one hits the mark.  Note: Always rinse quinoa before using to eliminate the bitter taste. I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce for the hot sauce ingredient.  Because of the 2 Tbs. used, we found this to have a bit of a kick so keep that in mind if you make this. The topping was quite liquid so I found it impossible to "paste" the top of the loaf--more like pouring it over slowly to ensure that it absorbs a bit before baking.  My loaf was a bit salty so I will cut back on salt.  Each hot sauce probably has a different amount of salt so other cooks may not have this problem.  This one is going into "the rotation" for sure!  Thanks, Drew!

This one did not work for me at all.   The kids took one bite and passed on it as well.   Maybe we're just not meatloaf lovers to begin with.

This was the first meatloaf I've ever made and I am so happy this was my first because it turned out delicious! I did not have Worcestershire sauce so I just substituted soy sauce and for the sauce I used Wyco recommendation of 1/4 c brown sugar + 1/4 cup ketchup + 1 tbs mustard. This is so amazingly delicious and so healthy as well!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  I have to admit that I did not have ground turkey the first time I went to make this so I used ground veal that I had in my freezer.  I omitted the topping as well but this meatloaf was one of the best by far that even my husband wanted to have his friends over to try it.  Have made it since with the veal again and it's still delicous!

This is the first recipe I have written a review for. With good reason, I am now a meatloaf lover! This is the moistest and tastiest meatloaf. My kids love it, which is an extra bonus. The only change I make is to omit the brown sugar topping, I substitute with bbq sauce. Saves time, calories and give it that little punch

This is very good-will definately make again.  Healthy and tastes great.  My son liked (and he is picky)  My daugher did not like.  I think it was the glaze.  The next time I make I will follow suggestions and change the glaze to something else.

good gluten free recipe.  Used ketchup instead of paste and topped with ketchup instead of rubbing brown sugar mixture on loaf.  This held together well and will be making again.

MMMmmmm good, quick and super easy to make. Very light tasting, not heavy like a true meatloaf. Next time I'll double it for leftovers. This would be great with a cranberry glaze. 
Update: I now double the quinoa, add more veggies, second egg and glaze with a combo of ketcup and garlic teriaky sauce.

Best meatloaf recipe I've tried.  Adding the quinoa gives the dish a nice nutty flavor!  Using quinoa instead of bread crumbs also gives the dish a more pleasant texture.  Instead of a brick-like texture, the servings have a lighter consistency.  Having the added bonus of using a complete protein grain such as quinoa is a definite plus for those looking for healthy recipes.  I will definitely make this recipe many more times.

This recipe was a total surprise, because it really came out delicious! I used steak sauce instead of Worcestershire. For the rest of the ingredients I ended up using almost the same amounts and baked it for an hour. This is the second time in my life that I had meatloaf, and from now on, I will be making it for the family very often. I used mashed potatoes as a side dish.

100 stars! WoW! BF & I LOVED it! I didn't change a thing. My topping was too thin to be a paste. So the next time I omitted the 1 Tbsp of water.  This recipe is great for DIABETICS bc there are no bread crumbs. I used a double meatloaf pan, the kind that drains fat. My meatloaf was firm and not "fall aparty"

This was SO GOOD! I loved it. I was so skeptical about using quinoa, but it was excellent. I substituted ketchup for the tomato paste and left out the hot sauce and it was still excellent. I didn't put all of the glaze on the loaf because it was a little too sweet for my taste. The only recommendation I have is to get the leanest meat possible. I will definitely make this again and will double it!

This is not the recipe for me.  I actually like ground turkey usually halfed with ground beef.  But the quinoa was awful!  I've never tasted it before and never will again.  Sorry but this is not anything like a traditional meatloaf.

This was very good. I baked it in a loaf pan (drained during baking) and it came out very moist. Cut back on W. sauce and hot sauce a lot due to personal tastes. Used ketchup becuse I didn't want to open a can of paste for just a tablespoon. Served with mashed taters, gravy and peas, Very nice meal and will be making again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This meatloaf is AMAZING! It has such a great flavor. I added a few squirts of sriracha as the "hot pepper sauce" and it gave it a great kick! Next time I will probably add more (red) quinoa just because it is so nutritious and gives a great texture. I was a little surprised by how small this meatloaf was. I cooked the loaf in a glass bread loaf dish and when I took it out of the oven, it had shrunk around the edges. It was perfect for my boyfriend and I and we even had leftovers, but if you're cooking for a larger family, you may want to double the recipe! And btw - the loaf dish was perfect because it was able to cook in it's own juiciness!

My kids declared this better than my usual meatloaf (made with ground beef) which is pretty darn good! This is way better than any turkey loaf recipe I've tried. I tripled the recipe thinking I would have two future meals in the freezer, but since everyone is home for Christmas it's going to be gone before it makes it to the freezer! I reduced the hot sauce to 1 teaspoon (perfect) and added an egg. Also cooked the quinoa in chicken stock. Yum!

I subbed soy sauce for Worc. bc I didn't have any. The "rub" for the top  didn't go well. I'm not sure if it was my fault or the recipe. Would be better with your own concoction of ketchup/brown sugar/soy sauce added at the end. The onions were a bit chunky if you aren't an onion person. I'd recommend grating the onion next time. The quinoa was a nice change to regular meatloaf. I'd definitely make this again with a different topping next time. Great leftovers.

I hate meatloaf, but I really liked this one.  I followed the directions almost exactly, except I added some mushrooms too.  The quinoa isn't exactly the greatest food binder, and the meatloaf fell apart in places.  That didn't really matter, because I still thought it tasted good.  I served it with the vegetarian gravy recipe on this site, which is an excellent olive oil based gravy that is a lot healthier.  I will definitely make this one again.

Nice healthy recipe until you look at the nutrition breakdown.  991 mg sodium per serving! I made this with 1/2 tsp kosher salt and it tasted great. I am very careful with sodium intake so my palate is accustomed to less sodium than most people. Also, hot sauce & ketchup are high in sodium, unless you make your own.

Texture and taste was really good.  I baked it in a 9X5 inch loaf pan and the pieces fell apart a little when I went to lift them out of the pan.  I didn't want the heat so I subbed ketchup for the hot sauce.  quite pleased with the addition of quinoa.

Really  good.  I used a cheap turkey chub with red quinoa.  I'm going to cook the quinoa in beef broth next time. I did use less salt than the recipe stated.  Hubby who doesn't like meatloaf loved it.

My kids said this was better than the beefy meatloaf that I usually make.  I am new to using quinoa, so I love finding new recipes to try it in.  This one was a definite keeper in my household.  I didn't alter the recipe, and it was easy and tasty.

I loved this, my husband liked it.  It was very tasty and I didn't change a thing.  I particularly like the fact that you are incorporating a grain that is so good for you with the quinoa.

The flavors seemed to work against each other.  It was too sweet and the Worcestershire sauce was overpowering.  I only got through one slice.

I had also sworn off of turkey meatloaf as it never quite did it for . . until now.  It's going back in the rotation!!  Like others,  I would caution to beware of how much hot sauce you use depending on your preference for heat.

Yum! I have issues with salt and this recipes has very little salt and lots of flavor. Even my puerto rican husband who says I cook a little on the bland side loved the flavor of this.

I made this meatloaf as directed, didn’t change a thing and the entire family loved it!  I prefer ground turkey to beef so this was right up my alley!  I wanted to put the mixture in a loaf pan but thought that the entire recipe would be two much in one pan and wasn’t sure how it would cook.  So I divided it into 2 loaf pans and it was fine but the loafs were not very high.  Next time I will try it in one loaf pan or make the loaves as directed.  I would say this will become my new standard meatloaf recipe.

I double this recipe and then freeze one. I also add diced carrots or diced zucchini and sauté it with the onions. It’s a great way to add veggies and the meatloaf is super moist. It’s one of our favorites.

My daughter and I loved this meatloaf. I have never mixed quinoa with meat before so I was worried about how it would turn out. It was awesome. The flavor was great. I did add a little Tony's seasoning before baking. I will be making it again!

Just finished making and enjoying this recipe for dinner.  Outstanding given the low calorie high protein content. Followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make again.  Next time will cut the salt in half.

The biggest criticism for turkey loaf is that it doesn't taste like meat loaf. Of course it doesn't. It is made from turkey. The object is to make a turkey loaf that tastes "good" not taste like beef. If you want meat loaf use meat.

I was leery of this recipe because ground turkey meat loaf definitely did not sound appetizing. However, I needed something to do with the ground turkey. This turned out amazing! I used red quinoa (its what I had), and salsa in place of the hotsauce and tomato paste (didnt have any tomato paste), and wow so good. Even better is that its totally healthy! I've got this packed up for my lunches this week!!

Disclaimer, I don't really care for ground turkey, but made this based on a review that said it couldn't be distinguished from regular meatloaf, so I had high hopes.  However it was unattractive and tasted like blandness with tabasco to me.  I've never given a "1 star" review before, but this really didn't work for me.

Excellent. I saw the recipe today..figured I would try it because its healthy and I look for different things to give my 1year old so she doesnt get bored with the same old easy to chew type of food everyday. Everyone in my family LOVED it including me and I have never been a meatloaf fan..ever. This is a definite keeper. Thank you for the recipe.

I am not a fan of regular meatloaf, but this was FANTASTIC! I LOVED the texture of the ground meat and quinoa and felt the quinoa added a nice flavour. I think where this recipe goes wrong is not mentioning what TYPE of hot pepper sauce people should use. I read some reviews that thought the 'hot sauce' was overpowering, some that called the recipe bland. There are so many types of hot pepper sauce with differing flavour profiles, I'd like to know what type/brand the recipe's author intended. The first time I made this, I used a Thai sweet garlic chilli sauce, as a review recommended and it was PERFECT!! The second time I tried a Jamaican hot pepper sauce and it was too bland. I would never try a tablespoon of tabasco because I think that WOULD overwhelm the recipe, but I might try 1/2 TBS. This is a fantastic recipe and I intend to keep experimenting  with the different hot pepper sauces, but I'll double the recipe and make one with the sweet garlic chilli sauce.

we liked iit-I think it could use more spices to up the flavor...maybe some bouillon some other herbs-I added more egg because I had 2 leftover egg yolks,so I added 1 egg, plus 2 yolks-- it might have changed the texture?- who knows? It sliced and held together very well. The quinoa made it more healthy.
We are try to eat less red meat & more fish.I miss old favorites and this fits the bill. I will play around with more herbs--I used  ketchup, brown suagr and mustard glazed on top--I will be making again.

Used 2 eggs, substituted ketchup for the tomato paste, used 2 cloves garlic, reduced hot sauce to 1 tsp, added 1/2 a red bell pepper (chopped) to the onions. I was reluctant when I saw this recipe, but it came together just as instructed and the result was DELICIOUS! MY 2 yr old and my husband both INHALED this meatloaf and asked for seconds. That is a win-win, my friends. :)

Tried it tonight. Added chopped broccoli and carrots to the mix to bump up health factor. Husband thought it was meatloaf, ate far more than his share. I didn't add as much spice for kids, might have to remove it completely for them next time. Thank you for a great recipe.

This recipe was awesome! I doubled all the ingredients for a 48 oz package of ground turkey. I did make a few changes. I didn't have tomato paste so I used equal parts ketchup. I also substituted equal parts BBQ sauce for the hot sauce to keep it from being spicy for the little one. I doubled the number of eggs (in this case, I used 4) to keep it from being too dry. I reduced the salt to 2 tsp and I felt it was plenty salty. My substitutions of ketchup and BBQ sauce may have contributed to the saltiness. Also, I used sea salt which tends to be "saltier". I may reduce it even more next time. As recommended, I cooked it on a cookie sheet covered with aluminum foil. This made clean-up pretty easy and kept the turkey from cooking in its own liquid and becoming soggy. Finally, I formed my meatloaf on the flatter side so that the cooking time wouldn't dramatically increase. In my case, an extra 5 minutes (total of 55 minutes) was perfect!

Excellent. I make this a couple of times a month and I have a ton of fun playing with this recipe. I have added another egg, cooked spinach, beans, almonds, squash... Try chili past instead of tomato paste. (No hot sauce then.) I did not make the glaze. I do make this into 2 loaves. I have used beef and chicken as well.

Want to add my voice to the many others praising this great recipe! I'm currently on a very restrictive diet and this recipe is helping tremendously. The quinoa improves the texture dramatically, and the flavor is excellent. I follow the recipe, then saute small patties instead of making a loaf. That way I can easily grab one for a meal or freeze individually for using later. Thanks so much for sharing this easy, great-tasting recipe!

Wow! I am amazed - A dish with quinoa that my husband said about: "you can make this again!" He didn't even notice there was quinoa until my son told him after!  The flavour was incredible. I made it with ground chicken (forgot that it was not turkey I had on hand), and used Wyko's recipe for the sauce, which my husband said "made it", so use this instead of the one with the recipe: 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/4 c ketchup, 1 tbsp regular mustard, and a few drops of Worcestershire sauce. 
And I   only used 3/4 of the hot sauce called for, and it definitely had enough zing and flavour. A keeper!

This was tasty and different.  I followed the recipe exactly except I refrigerated the meat mixture for about an hour before shaping and baking.  With ground turkey (93/7 blend) I find this helps the meat hold together.  Make sure you like the hot sauce you use because it is very strong in this recipe.  Next time I plan to use a different brand for a different flavor profile and plan to put the topping on before refrigeration so it has time to sink farther down into the meat.  Mine was done in 35 minutes - the size and shape of the "loaf" will impact cooking time, so check early if you don't have an instant read thermometer that you leave in for the duration of cooking.

This was so good! I didn't have tomato paste on hand, so I used ketchup. I'm always looking for ways to use quinoa - it gave this a nice flavor. I shaped it into a loaf and cooked it in a pan as suggested by a reviewer. I plan to make it again this week - ground turkey has been on sale.

I'm floored how good this recipe is! I took into account one review about the hot pepper sauce and using bbq instead. I used "sticky fingers habanero bbq sauce" 2 TBLS. I bought a reduced price 3lb ground turkey pk (85/15)and turned it into this something amazing. When I applied the glaze I left about half to top it off after it was done to seep in and "extra" glazify( made up word) it over. This is amazing I recommend it! 5 stars to any one!

This is wonderful!  I added a second egg and 1/2 red pepper (because it would have spoiled if I didn't use it). Otherwise, followed Drew's recipe exactly.  Tastes awesome as leftovers for lunch sandwiches.  I will make this again, just for the leftovers.

This was REALLY good! Love the fact that the binder was quinoa instead of bread crumbs, much healthier!  I did take others recommendation and used extra egg and I mixed in the tomato paste instead of putting on top and it turned out just fine. Will be making again and again.

WOW! I read the reviews, and thought, "These people are just trying to talk themselves into the fact that this healthy recipe is delicious".... but it ACTUALLY is..  I always toast quinoa in the pan before cooking.  I used beef broth as the liquid for the quinoa, skipped the salt in the meatloaf recipe and topped with a mixture of 2 tsp Worchestershire, 1 tsp of water, and 1 Tbsp of mustard (no brown sugar).  SO GOOD.

I made the meatloaf exactly by the recipe except that I doubled it and cooked it as meat muffins instead of meatloaf (cooked them in 12 muffin tins for 20 minutes).  Since I planned on freezing them & I wanted a healthier meal,  I didn't put the sauce on top.  On the day I served them, I took out what I wanted and reheated.  for a sauce, I simmered a can of low sodium diced tomatoes with a little Spenda, a few shakes of hot sauce and a couple shakes of Worchestershire.  For color, I added dried parsley & chives.  I pureed the tomatoes with an immersion blender and cooked to about 1/3 the original volume.  Mashed turnips and broccoli were the perfect compliment for a healthy meal.  The turnips really complimented the meat & tomato sauce.

Good, but a little salty. It may make a difference on how much sodium the turkey you are using has. I used the amount of salt indicated in the recipe but with 2 lbs. of turkey. The turkey I used had 140 mgs (6%) of sodium. If I made it again I would use 3/4 to 1 t. salt.

The whole family loved this healthy alternative to beef meatloaf. I didn't think it would firm up as the mixture was quite wet when it went into the oven. But it did and I dabbed the grease with a paper towel.
The Quinoa was subtle but you could taste it.
Wonderful recipe!!
I wouldn't change a thing.
Thanks for sharing.

I felt this to be too dry.  I also was surprised how much of a punch the hot sauce packed in it.  It was on the spicy side for me.

Very good and well received.  I spaced out & accidentally put the ingredients meant for the topping in the loaf mixture and still tasted great!  A thin layer of brown HP sauce went on top instead.  The sweet and spicy flavours were balanced beautifully in this surprisingly healthful loaf.  Thanks Drew!

This is truly an amazing meatloaf.  I followed the recipe to a 'T' and wouldn't change a thing.  There are many recipes on here with high ratings that really are only worth 3 stars but this is not only nutritious but it is tasty and guaranteed to be a family favorite!

Truly amazing!  I've made lots of recipes from this site, and never been excited about a find enough to bother with a review.  I have already told all my friends about this one.  I, too, was worried it was too soft and wet when I placed it in the oven, but it came out perfectly.  Just follow the recipe and you're golden.  By the way, I made this because I am on a no carb diet right now.  Just skipped the brown sugar topping on half of the loaf (it was more of a glaze than a paste as indicated).  I ate from one half and the hubs ate from the other.  We were both extremely pleased (although, I do admit I tasted a bite of his...and the sweetness does add to it.

This is fabulous! I really like the taste and texture, and it's very moist. I also like that this is a healthier recipe. I buy the Jennie-O 85% lean large package of ground turkey (48 oz) then double the rest of the ingredients. Once I have it all mixed up, I divide it in half. That allows one meatloaf for dinner that night, and I put the rest (raw) in a freezer bag for later. That way, all I do is thaw it overnight next time I want it, and throw it in the oven for dinner. 2 meals in one! The whole family loves it, and this is one of those recipes I tell everyone about!

I've been making this for a year or two and my boyfriend prefers it over beef meatloaf.  We actually can eat at least 2/3 of this just for dinner, so we always fight over the leftovers for lunch the next day! I make it pretty closely as written but maybe mix up some more sauce and add some liquid smoke to the loaf.

This was wonderful! I fixed this last night with some fresh asparagus and fresh strawberries and my family loved it! Drew, thank you so much for the tip about baking it in a flat baking dish rather than a loaf pan. The texture was perfect.

Impromptu meal with my girlfriend.  Thoroughly impressed us both with this meatloaf.  The quinoa is succulent and adds that little al dente pop to every bite.  Don't over cook the turkey, but that always goes for turkey anything!  
I used 2 medium sized eggs.  I used a loaf shaped cooking pan b/c it was so moist it wouldn't stand up on its own.  I used ketchup and bbq sauce instead of tomato paste and hot sauce.  Though I did throw a little hot sauce in for minor kick.  
Best turkey meatloaf I've ever had.  And I can't freakin' believe I made it! lol 
Thanks, S

Fantastic! I am not a fan of beef-based meatloaf, but this was delicious and I am already looking forward to making it again. I didn't have tomato paste so I subbed ketchup but it was still amazing. I would recommend to everyone.

The use of quinoa is brilliant!!!  I only gave it a 4star for the spices because I modified it to suit mt taste. I give a 5 because of the moistness and the texture. It came out perfectly. Since I like thyme I added that, plus 2 extra garlic cloves, Kirkland seasoning salt instead of plain salt and pushed in some cubes of cheese.  Also I glazed it with BBQ sauce.

YUM! Thanks for the idea! This came out amazing. I made a few changes:
-- I cooked the quinoa in organic, low sodium chicken broth with a tiny sliver of butter.
-- I left out the tomato paste (only because I was out) and substituted the hot sauce with bbq sauce (kid friendly). 
-- I sauteed the onions and garlic with diced carrots and celery then added thyme in the veggies for seasoning. I also made the glaze/gravy a little differently - I melted butter, added about 2 table spoons of tomato sauce, dark beer, regular raw sugar, worchestershire sauce, and garlic and added it to the top of the loaf at about 15 minutes into the bake. 

This came out so delicious! It's going down in my book of favorite recipes. Definitely a crowd pleaser!

Don’t be tempted to save a few calories by using ground turkey breast.  Using ground turkey, white and dark meat, produces a flavorful and moist meatloaf.   I never use a loaf pan for meatloaf but always bake them free form on a baking sheet.  I was tempted to skip the brown sugar/ Worcestershire topping but I am glad that I went with it as it added significantly to the wonderful flavor of the meatloaf.

Everyone really enjoyed this meatloaf.  I've never cared for meatloaf, but my boyfriend and roommate really like it.  I decided to try making it for them.  When I found this recipe, I was really excited because I love quinoa.  The meatloaf was moist, flavorful, and super easy to make.

Very good. I was afraid of the 1Tbs of hot pepper sauce but I added it and it was not overpowering. I am glad that I added it as directed. I also added some chopped fresh spinach for color (and I needed to use it) This is a really good alternative to the "heavier" meatloaf that is made with ground beef.

Excellent! Although I am an avid ground turkey lovver, we opted for our own ground elk meat we processed last week. I added about 1/2 cup of cooked quinoa, and did not change anything else. This recipe will be a staple, as we have 44 lbs of ground elk to enjoy!

Wonderful recipe!  I omitted the olive oil, onion, and hot pepper sauce and subbed the tomato paste for chicken base.  Awesome meatloaf!!!  Have made it numerous times and it's always a hit.  Thank you.

Drew, thanks for reiterating that your recipe calls for a freestanding loaf. I have made it several times in a meatloaf pan, but after reading your recent posting, formed it in the pan and then turned the pan upside down so it popped out onto a foil lining. It was even better this way and had a nice crust all around that I didn't get in a pan. I like to add green  pepper to the onion and garlic along with 1 cup of fat free cheese to the meat mixture.

This is exceptional! I did exactly as the recipe called for, with one minor tweak. I added 1/3 cup of uncooked oatmeal as well. This helped with the binding. It was so perfectly moist and flavorful. Thanks for the delicious AND healthy recipe!

We decided to try quinoa and this looked like a good recipe.  It was very good.  I used venison instead of turkey, but I will try turkey next time.  Now we feel more comfortable trying other recipes with quinoa (aka bird seed).  :-)

This meatloaf is fantastic, the whole family loved it. My 5 & 14 year olds do not like meatloaf but I did not tell them what it was & they both really enjoyed it. I did not change a thing in the recipe, and won't next time either.

This was very good meatloaf.  The texture was perfect and it was nicely spiced.  I followed the recipe with the exception of subbing ketchup for the tomato paste (because I didn't want to open a can of tomato paste for only 1 TBL) and I used Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of salt and pepper.   As we like spicy bold flavors next time I will probably follow other reviewers recommendations to add bbq sauce to give it a little bolder flavor.

This meatloaf was very tasty.  I didn't use a loaf pan, but after an hour it still wasn't done, so I turned up the heat to 400.  I did not use the topping, so a after about 15 minutes I turned the oven on broil to brown the top.  At that point, the texture was fine, and I will make this again.

Fantastic recipe, everyone had seconds. Next time I will double the recipe!   I always make the following topping as one reviewer suggested  just minus the smoke flavouring and it is very tasty...."For the toping I made my own recipe: ¼ cup ketchup, 1 Tbsp brown sugar, 2 tsp Dijon mustard and 2 dashes liquid smoke flavoring.

Quite good. I liked that the quinoa gave it some crunch. I added some cheese. I must've boned the topping or something; it slid off the loaf and onto the pan. Whatevz.

I think the quinoa makes the difference for me.  However my spouse hated it.  He has something against Quinoa.   So probably won't make it again since it wasn't popular with children or spouse.  I hate cooking so to put effort into something no one likes except me just isn't worth it.

My husband used this recipe to make meatloaf.  I don't think he followed it exactly but I gave it 5 stars for the quinoa addition.  It was a nice texture.  He also used real pieces of bread which was tasty too.

This is awesome! I love quinoa and turkey, and thought this recipe was a perfect fit.  I skip the sauce on top.  Ive tried adding in chopped zucchini, and flax seeds with great success. A great, adaptable recipe.

I didn't make a single change.  This was delicious!  I made two and froze one for later- just thawed completely in the fridge overnight and baked as usual.  For the frozen one, I just whipped up another batch of the glaze right before baking, because I didn't think it would freeze as well without that.  It worked wonderfully!

I thought this recipe was really good but a tad too salty. Next time I'll cut down the salt to 1 teaspoon.

Besides that, no complaints. Very clever use of quinoa, and the entire family gobbled it up. With the salt modification, it's definitely a keeper!

My family loves this meal!!  I don't use the hot sauce so that my 19 month old and 5 year old will eat it and it still tastes great.  I also portion out the meat into a 12 count muffin tin making 12 individual portions.  Each one is about 95 calories and you can decide how many you want and the kids think it's cool to get a meatloaf muffin (just cook for 30 minutes at the given temp)!!

Good stuff! I also added BBQ sauce to the top only 'cause that's how we like it. Great texture for the loaf, the quinoa really made it firm up like ground beef.

AWESOME. This is the first meatloaf I ever made and I loved it. Husband complained it was not the right color for meatloaf, there's no pleasing some people.

I used less sugar and less hot sauce than suggested, and next time I think I will add more garlic and salt, and add some herbs. Would love to try cheese as well.

This was pretty good. I will make it again. I will hold off on the top sauce though. Maybe a ketchup based one instead, if any. I didnt want to open a new bottle of hot sauce, so I used some sort of southwestern chipotle sauce. I also didnt want to open a paste but had a dab of pasta sauce I wanted to use up. I did put it in a pan. I just didnt think it would hold it's shape. Now I am reading one of the reviews that says this will in essence steam the turkey, so I will try to remember that next time.

I was kinda skeptic about adding quinoa to this, but loved it!  Great with ketchup and for the next day's meatloaf sandwiches.  I might cut back on the hot sauce the next time though.

Not sure what the hype is all about. I've made turkey meatloaf several times and each time it has tasted much better than with this recipe. I followed it exactly, but added an extra egg to help with the crumbly issues that others reported. It wasn't crumbly... it just didn't have much taste. I got the kids to eat it by adding ketchup on top, cutting it up, and passing it off as "meatballs."

This is fantastic! I can't eat gluten so this is perfect for me. The best thing is my family likes it better than regular meatloaf. My teenage daughter raves about it! I followed suggestions by others to add an extra egg. I also omitted the hot sauce and tomato paste and used barbeque sauce instead. I also put barbeque sauce on top instead of the listed topping. It is amazing! The whole house smells wonderful when I make this!!! It is a new family favorite.

The reviews are what made me want to try this recipe. I never would have considered meatloaf with just ground turkey but I am so glad I did! I accidentally added the glaze ingredients to the meat but it turned out fine. I might try to add some spinach next time, but it's absolutely delicious just as it's written.

I made a mistake with this and used couscous instead of quinoa; however, the result was fabulous and so healthy!  On WW PP program, one serving was only 5 points!  Moist, slightly spicy and an overall winner!

Everyone in my family LOVED this.  I think this will become one of our regulars.  I did a ketchup, brown sugar sauce for the top instead of the rub suggested.

Everybody took seconds... Even those that don't usually like turkey.  Used Cholula hot sauce.  Might kick the heat up more for those that like it spicy.

It was good, but I can only give it 3 stars.  It was a little too spicy, and even with 2 eggs,  ir was still pretty runny.   Flavor was just ok.

Absolutely delicious. My skeptical husband also loved it. I did use ground turkey thigh meat. We thought the topping was a tad sweet for us but it was still good. Will do the topping with less sugar next time, and will also add an egg, it was just a tiny bit crumbly. Really great and I will be making it again soon!

I liked this, but the rest of my family didn't really. It was a bit on the dry side. I think by throwing in some pureed vegetables you can add even more nutrients and some moisture.

I made the recipe as is and found it to be absolutely wonderful.  My husband asked how much ground beef did I use.  He couldn't tell the difference.  My own preference next time would be to use less hot sauce and maybe half it with BBQ sauce.  Great recipe.

WOAH! My tried and true meatloaf has been replaced! What a great recipe! It tastes wonderful, the texture is perfect, and it is far superior to mine from a nutritional standpoint. The only thing I did differently than stated was that I topped it with my traditional meatloaf topping which is about 1/3 c ketchup, 1T mustard, 1 t worcestershire all mixed together and spread on top. Thanks, Drew, for sharing this excellent recipe!

Big hit in my household!  This one will be a keeper!  I too increased the quinoa and the meatloaf was still very moist.  I might add a little more hot sauce next time to give it a little more zip.  For those of you who read the recipe and are afraid it will be too spicy, you can't even tell there is hot sauce in it!

This has become a regular recipe of ours.  My kids and my husband LOVE it.  I highly recommend it.  Whenever I don't have Worcestershire I use soy sauce.  I have also tried different kinds of hot peppers, we liked the extra flavor that the chipotle pepper gives it.  Fast, easy, healthy and tasty!!

The whole family absolutely raved about this!! We have several difficult eaters in the family and it was a hit with everyone and healthy to boot! I did change the brown sugar to turbinado and added some Dale's steak seasoning to boost the rich flavor and it was delish!  The 11 year old picky eater requested it for dinner two nights later :)

I've never rated before, but this was the best meatloaf I've ever eaten.  I made the quinoa in the rice cooker and then cooled it prior to mixing in.  Also, I baked it at 425 degrees for about 35 minutes--I think the shorter time/higher temp helped with the texture.  My meatloaf did not have any texture issues at all, and we loved it!

I must have done something wrong.  This recipe looks amazing, as do the reviews, but I found it a little too bland.  I didn't add hot sauce because I don't like anything remotely spicy.  I used more tomato paste to make up for it.  Also, it was very moist- like sitting in 1/2" of liquid in the bread pan I used.  Not sure what I did wrong.  I will try it again, maybe the quinoa needs to cool before going in?  Maybe next time I will try half quinoa and half bread crumbs to absorb some moisture.

Excellent recipe!  I omitted the hot sauce for my kiddos, added 1/4 tsp dry mustard, a small diced zucchini and 1/2 cup cheese per other reviewer's suggestions.  It would have been just as great without the changes though.  What a great way to sneak quinoa into my kids.

This was good, after reading reviews I added better than boulion 'beef' to the water I cooked quinoa in- Yummy. I used BBQ sauce in place of hot scauce. Turned out good.

I am usually a ground turkey hater, but this was pretty good--good enough that I'll make it again.  The cooking time made for a slightly overcooked product in my oven (I really need a thermometer) and I think the hot sauce needs to be scaled back (used Tabasco--was very spicy and overpowered the other flavors, even though I like heat).  

I had to use garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, ketchup instead of tomato paste, and I added a stalk of finely chopped celery.  I also added some ketchup and lemon juice to the glaze because I didn't like the flavor of just brown sugar & Worcestershire. 

Thanks for an easy, healthful recipe!

Made exactly as stated and it was fantastic!  Hubby knew there was quinoa in it, but said it didn't taste any different than regular turkey meatloaf.  Only 7 WW Points+ per serving, too!  I wouldn't use the glaze next time, though, as it was a little too sweet for our tastes.  Delicious!

Five stars for the concept of using quinoa to improve the texture of the turkey meatloaf!  I followed the recipe (okay, almost), but next time I think I will use the turkey/quinoa proportions and my own meatloaf seasonings.  This was good, but we prefer a different type of seasonings.

We really liked this meatloaf.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe, but I did bake it in a meatloaf pan. This was my first time cooking with quinoa, but it won't be the last. I can't wait to make it again. Thanks!

The recipe seemed pretty tasty but was way overcooked- I didn't want to rate it too low so people don't miss out on the recipe. I make turkey loaves very often and have never cooked them for 50 min, more like 35-40. I will try it again like that and hopefully it comes out as everyone has said! As I said, recipe itself was tasty.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! Great use of low fat healthy turkey and wonder food quinoa. It has a nice texture and the flavor was amazing. The only change I made was I used ketchup instead of tomato paste, because I didn't have any. I made this recipe for my boyfriend and I and we both thought it was one to make over and over again.

Made this tonight and everyone liked it very much even the 4 yr old!  I followed it to the letter except I didn't have hot sauce only a really strong Sriracha sauce so I used about 7 dashes if that.  Turned out great!  Next time I will add more quinoa.  If you are new to quinoa make sure you don't boil too long it goes dry easily!

I forgot the hot sauce I grabbed was Habanero (my son's) until the T was already in.  It was extra spicy but we loved it!  And I really liked the effects & taste  of the quinoa. Thanks very much.

I thought this was very good. My picky son actually ate something considered "healthy." I'll be making this again, but next time, I'll leave off the glaze to make it a little more traditional.

I had never made meatloaf before but I have always loved it with beef. We had ground chicken (instead of turkey) and decided to try this recipe, it was fabulous! We doubled the amounts and added a "jerk hot sauce" instead of the "hot pepper sauce" and the jerk flavour burst through the meatloaf. We also had to substitute the Worcestershire sauce with an oriental anchovy sauce as we didn't have any Worcestershire sauce on hand.  Instead of tomato paste we used "Diana Sauce, original"...again, due to not having tomato paste. I also forgot to add the salt but it didn't matter, we added it later to taste and simply enjoyed every savoury mouthful! Excellent!!

Just made this, and it's wonderful. I never ever use ground turkey because I feel it's just so... blah! But this recipe made me a believer. Also, I took the advice of a lot of people on here and cut the hot sauce in half, but next time I'll use all of it. I felt it could use some more heat!

This was GENIUS!  I wish I had the creative mind to come up with dishes like this.  I HATE quinoa, and cannot believe how much I like it in this recipe.  You really hardly notice it. The funny thing is, the meatloaf looks dry, but the texture is perfect, and you don't need any gravy or anything because the flavor is subtle, but so good. A hit with the whole family, which is nearly impossible!  Thank you for this wonderful healthy recipe Drew!

Very tasty.  I cooked the quinoa in beef broth, instead of water, and did not have tomato paste so I used tomato sauce.   Very very good.

Since I am a quinoa lover and I like to eat healthy, I was happy to find this recipe. I gave it 4 starts because the only issue I had was the with the rub for the top. It didn't do anything for me. I think next time I'll stick with the classic ketchup topping. Thanks!

This was delicious! So different, and loved the flavors. I scaled back on the hot sauce quite a bit, but would probably do 1/2 TBS next time. Great way to get a ton of protein in a yummy, hearty meal!

This was really, really good! The quinoa made it very most, and a perfect texture for meatloaf.  Followed recipe exactly except I only used maybe 1/2 tsp salt.  I think I'd skip the glaze next time and go with a more tomato-based one.  The flavor of this is good, but also would work nicely with some herbs or jalapenos for a change of pace.  Great as stated and great potential!

Tried it, as a rookie cook, for the first time.  Came out great!  My wife loved it, although I left out the hot sauce for my wife's sake.

Delicious!  I made it exactly as written and cannot believe how good it is considering it's all turkey.  The hot sauce gave it a nice kick and the brown sugar on top really added great flavor.  I'll be making this regularly!

What a great option for ground turkey! I made it just like the recipe....however, I was out of hot sauce (a blasphemy in Louisiana, I know)..so I substituted ketchup. The brown sugar on the top of the meatloaf really set off the flavor. I WILL definitely be making this again!

Delicious made exactly as is.  I baked it in a loaf pan rather than on a cookie sheet.  Turned out great!  My boyfriend was initially skeptical but the first bite won him over.  Much better than beef meatloaf (in terms of taste & health!) and so flavorful it does not need any extra sauce.

This meatloaf is AMAZING! It has such a great flavor. I added a few squirts of sriracha as the "hot pepper sauce" and it gave it a great kick! Next time I will probably add more (red) quinoa just because it is so nutritious and gives a great texture. I was a little surprised by how small this meatloaf was. I cooked it in a glass bread loaf dish and when I took it out of the oven, it had shrunk around the edges. It was perfect for my boyfriend and I and we even had leftovers, but if you're cooking for a larger family, you may want to double the recipe! the loaf dish was perfect because it was able to cook in it's own juiciness!

I made this recipe with a few extra veggies,  so good.  I chopped up a 1/2 cup of celery, carrots and red pepper and cooked them up with the onions.  I also only had a mixture of wild rice and quinoa,  that was also very good.  I also skiped the "paste" on the final step 4 and used a teriyaki baste and glaze sauce.  I served it with a cauliflower puree and I was a very healthy dinner.

I had gotten tired of using the same old meatloaf seasoning packets. This is worth the little bit of extra effort in making it from scratch! I also used lean ground turkey. I made it exactly as told except I used 1 egg white in place of an egg & I added tomato paste on top of the paste on the meatloaf. It was a big hit though, definitely will make it again!

This was a nice change to the regular turkey meatloaf.  I always use ketchup in meatloaf (as per hubby) so I omitted the tomato paste.  Quinoa adds a great dimension, being a super-grain.  This could never replace my usual, classic turkey meatloaf (ya know, with the tangy glaze on top), but like I said, it's a really nice change!

This is officially a staple in our house.  I do make changes - I double the recipe and get about 3 loaves out of it  - I add about 3 whole shredded zucchini to the onions and saute that together, then I mix in all the other ingredients.  I do not put the brown sugar based topping on, but rather opt for the reduced sugar ketchup.  My kids eat it up and hubby and I love it.  And the best part is that it is a super healthy recipe!!  Thank You.

Excellent recipe, this will be one we'll make again and again.  I didn't tell my kids (who are very picky eaters!) that there was hot sauce in the meatloaf.  They ate it all up and went back for seconds, after they were done I told them and they couldn't believe it.  It's refreshing finding a dish that everyone really likes, I highly recommend it!

Best meatloaf I have ever had.  I am recently gluten free and my family is having a hard time adjusting as I am always the one who cooks, but everyone raved about this meal.  I fed the 5 pickiest eaters I know and had them getting seconds and thirds! Love the texture even more than regular meatloaf as there's no nasty soggy bread :)

This is the best meatloaf ever! Bursting with flavor and light as a feather (hard to do with ground turkey). We also eat lots of quinoa so this is perfect. I use soy instead of Worcestershire sauce.

LOVED THIS! It was super moist, doubled the recipe for a group of 5 adults and 5 kids (only one little guy). I did improvise quite a bit, here's what I did:  -Cut salt and pepper in half -Substituted BBQ sauce for hot sauce -Skipped the worcester -Added 1 C cheddar Jack cheese (could be reduced fat I'm sure, but adds moisture) -Made a mistake and included 2 tbls of brown sugar (used splenda blend) INTO the meatloaf instead of on top and it was actually really good, if you don't want it too sweet you could leave this out or cut it in half. -Cooked Quinoa in chicken broth =Tried to rinse the quinoa but didn't have a strainer thin enough so didnt' really do that.  I cooked the 2 loaves at 350 for about 1.5 hours in 2 loaf pans and they came out perfectly, not dry at all!  My husband who HATES meatloaf, actually liked this!

VERY tasty! I was pretty impressed with this recipe. I read other reviews and decided to omit the brown sugar topping. I just used more tomato paste on the top. My meatloaf came out slightly dry, but I think it's because I cooked it for too long. Next time I might throw a bit more worcestershire in the mix. YUM anyway!

My husband couldn't stop raving about this and wouldn't change a thing! But next time I make it, I'd like to use only 1 1/4 t. salt, and about 3/4 T. hot sauce. My girls thought it was a bit spicy for their taste. Overall, fantastic!

Great meatloaf recipe - better than beef.  Reduced hot pepper sauce in 1/2.  After 35 minutes of baking, drained the liquid and flipped the loaf onto a foil lined baking sheet.  Added a glaze of ketchup, worcestershire sauce and brown sugar - resumed baking for 10 more minutes.

The quinoa is what drew me to this recipe - I love the taste and nutrition of it. I made the recipe as written. I did find it rather wet so I added 2 tbl of corn meal to absorb some of the wetness. I formed this into 4 patties rather than a loaf for portion control and to cut down on baking time. I baked them for 25 min. We found these moist and tasty and the quinoa added a great something extra. Will definitely be making this again.

AMAZING! I had to sub soy sauce and ketchup and vinegar for the wort. sauce, as I can't find any wort. sauce that's wheat free. Aside from that sub, I followed the recipe exactly. And we were stunned with how good it was! My hubby does NOT like quinoa, but he LOVED this meatloaf! Thank you for such a lovely keeper recipe!

I am blown away by how good this was!  I didn't think a turkey meatloaf could possibly be very good, but I was completely wrong.    I was worried it might be too spicy with the pepper sauce but it wasn't at all.  I used ground chicken because it's what I had.  I used 2 small green bell peppers instead of onion, cause I didn't have any.  And I used sundried tomato pesto instead of tomato paste, because I didn't want to open a can of paste for only 1 tbsp.

I loved this.  I divided it and put it into muffin tins just for the sake of a shorter cooking time and after about 20-25 minutes, they were done.  My hubby hates meatloaf and he's not a big quinoa fan either, but he did ask me to add this to my permanent recipes!  Dee-lish!

This is deserving of all the rave reviews! My only complaint is that it didn't hold together very well. Next time I will try 2 eggs.

Great, interesting flavor and really healthy. I feel like it was just a tad dry, though. But I overcooked the quinoa, so that could be my fault. The recipe says to simmer the quinoa for 15 minutes, but mine was almost burnt at 10.

I was really skeptical of this recipe, but decided to try it. We loved it! I only had 1 pound of ground turkey instead of 20 ounces, I forgot the garlic, I substituted ketchup for the tomato paste because that's what I had on hand and I used only 1/2 tablespoon of Sweet and Spicy Tabasco so it wasn't too spicy for my 2 year-old. It really turned out good, and I don't even like meatloaf! I baked it in a loaf pan for 55 minutes and it was done perfectly.

this was a great, flavorful turkey meatloaf that we loved! I skipped the hot sauce and subbed BBQ, but that was the only change. YUM!

This meatloaf was really great! My grocery store didn't have quinoa, so I used couscous, which seemed to work really well also. I'd really like to try it with the quinoa next time, but if you do use the couscous, throw some herbs into it as it cooks and/or use chicken broth, just to give it a little extra flavor. I skipped the hot pepper, used ketchup instead of tomato paste, and grated up a zucchini and some baby carrots into it as well (I had prepared 1/2c of couscous, and ended up using all of it to bind the meatloaf together with all of the veggies' extra water). I also threw in some dried basil and parsley to give a little bit of extra flavor. My 2yr old, who doesn't care for meat very much, LOVED it- he was dipping his pieces in ketchup and had most of his serving finished before my husband and I sat down! Served it with mashed sweet potatoes and garlic green beans- very tasty and pretty easy. Will definitely get worked into my meal rotation!

I really love this recipe and so does my husband! The only things I changed are additions: I add a cup of shredded carrots to the mix, and it really kicks up the flavor and healthy aspects. As well as cooking the quinoa in low sodium beef broth; by doing this the meatloaf ends up having a heartier taste. But by far the best part of the recipe is the sauce on top! If you let it run over the sides of the  loaf, the flavor will soak into the entire thing....so yummy!!!

Turned out great the first time! I didn't have 20 oz of the turkey so I added about a cup of bread crumbs and omitted the sugar on top (just my preference).

I've tried quinoa several times and have never really enjoyed it. I decided to make this recipe on a whim one evening when I had turkey to use up. Finally, quinoa I liked! I didn't change a single thing and thought this was a great meatloaf. I think next time I might add a different topping, but it's quite good just as it is. :-D

My wife will not eat meatloaf but she raved about this dish.  I will definitely be making this again.   I also used BBQ sauce instead of hot pepper sauce as my family does not like spicy foods.  I found that it crumbled quite easily and so I will try it with an extra egg next time.

WOW! This exceeded my expectations in every possible way! My incredibly picky, meat & potatoes, husband even liked it and went back for a second helping! I only had a 16 oz package of turkey, but did not alter the amounts of other ingredients and it tasted great! I subbed ketchup for the tomato paste and BBQ for the hot sauce (I'm a spicy wimp). I made the loaf in the afternoon and put it in the fridge until it was time to bake. I added the glaze right before I put it in the oven. This was delicious, easy, healthy, and I will DEFINITELY make it again!

We didn't have Quinoa in the house, so we used Bulgur wheat instead and it came out awesome!  My husband is not really into the ground turkey thing, and even he loved it!  Also changed the topping to tomato paste rather than the sugar. Also added some celery with the onion.  The mixture is quite wet, we were tempted to add breadcrumbs or something, glad we didn't do it as it came out perfect!  Definitely will make again, and recommend to others.

This was a very good recipe.  I actually used lean beef and substituted ketchup for the tomato paste and a dash of chili powder for the tobasco sauce.  Will definitely make this again!

This recipe is fabulous.  As my husband said "you've made me lots of meatloafs and this is by far the best."  It came out with such a great texture, I far prefer it to all other meatloafs.  Also, I love recipes that are nutrient/vitamin rich, so making this with quinoa is just one more plus.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used ketchup instead of the tomato paste.  Everything was right on, and I'll be making this over and over again!!

This was fantastic!!! I only had 16oz of ground turkey so I added 4oz of spinach (cooked it with the onions). I used Jalepeno hot sauce so that it would be fairly mild. I followed what someone said below and used two eggs instead of one. Delicious!! Only downfall? There wasn't more of it!

I change almost all of the seasonings because I didn't have them, and I generally don't like to use Worchestershire sauce in cooking.  I replaced that with dijon mustard and soy sauce.  But I love the use of quinoa in meatloaf instead of breadcrumbs.  I do it all the time now!

My husband usually turns his nose up to anything that involves ground turkey. This passed with flying colors. It really was delicious and simple to make. I recently began using quinoa and have only used it as a side dish. This is a great way of adding a really healthy grain to your diet.   Thanks for the recipe!

We loved this!  I followed the recipe exactly, but to be fair, I topped it with some leftover home-made BBQ sauce, and it was AWESOME!  I don't think that tomate paste would be good.  BUT, I loved the flavor and moistness of the meatloaf itself.  My fiance was a little put-off by the squiggles from the quinoa, but admitted he liked the taste.  I'll likely make this again, using BBQ sauce to top it (or at least a ketchup/mustard/brown sugar mix).  Thanks for the great recipe!

Best turkey meatloaf we have ever had. I replaced the quinoa with couscous because it is what I had on hand. Amazing! I am making it for the second time tonight. Again, I will use couscous, but everything else will be the same.

liked the idea of using quinoa as a filler. very good, backed off the hot pepper sauce (used 1t) cause my 3yo was eating it. I wish I had added little more, but was not disappointed.

My husband stopped eating anything with ground turkey a few years ago claiming he no longer liked the taste.  He LOVED this!  It was a bit spicy for my 1 and 3-year olds, so now I divide the mix in half, add the pepper sauce to one part and add ketchup or BBQ sauce to the other.  Everyone's happy!!

This is a great recipe!  I followed the recipe the first time, way too salty and peppery for me and could've used an extra egg.  The second time I cut the salt and pepper in half, added diced and shredded veggies (carrots, celery, peppers, mushrooms) as I always do with meatloaf, and added an additional egg.  A little extra brown sugar in the topping and it was fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe!

Best meatloaf ever.  I now use Quinoa in my Turkey burgers as well.  I didnt have tomato paste so I left that out and I used Sriracha chili sauce.  I also added some Flax meal to aid in the healthy aspects.  Again, BEST MEATLOAF EVER!

I changed my review after I followed the recipe! I made the mistake of adding spices last time and it was overseasoned. I don't like spicy food, but I took the gamble and used almost a tablespoon of hot sauce. It was great- just a little kick to get the metabolism going! I found the recipe for the sauce topping to be kind of weird and too sweet- I used about a tablespoon of brown sugar and added tomato paste. Next time, I think I'll use my ketchup/dijon/brown sugar glaze. Love this recipe!

Awesome meatloaf!  I accidentally added a whole can of tomato paste and it turned out great!  I love spicy food so I added a bit more of the hot sauce.  I could've added more, but it was great anyway.  Easy and delicious!

Fantastic!  We just started eating healthier in our house and this is going to make it much much easier.  I'm a fan of smoky flavors along with spice so I used chipotle sauce in place of the hot pepper sauce.  It turned out great!  I was going to take a pic but it was gone too fast....

I love the spicy-ness so I added hot sauce to the topping also and served it with mashed sweet potatoes - yumm! Nice meaty texture and a great way to get more protein into the diet.  I'm definitely making it again!

I know the reviews are from several years ago, but this is my go to meatloaf. We don’t eat beef, so turkey meatloaf is what we like. The addition of quinoa instead of bread crumbs makes It quite  moist.Easy, quick, and very good. I make his a couple times a month.

This was very good. It was light and flavorful. I made it without the hot sauce, just as a matter of preference and it was still very tasty.

Holy  this was delicious!  The sauce on top proved a little aggressive but still good, and I accidentally put in double the quinoa - still came out absolutely tasty, and was a huge hit with my household.

Excellent flavor! Followed the advice of other reviewers and added some seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic powder). Very moist even with ground turkey breast, which can be very dry.

Best turkey meatloaf I’ve tried. Made one adjustment in cooking the quinoa in chicken broth, as suggested in another review. The quinoa gives it a delicious nutty flavor. The sweet topping made the biggest impact. Will now be a staple in our diet.

Wow! I never thought to use quinoa to replace the bread or crackers before. I tried this for my elderly mother's restrictive diet. I had to omit the salt and Worcestershire sauce but I added a little more garlic and onion! We were pleasantly surprised!

Great recipe but be sure and follow the creator ‘s advice and cook this on a cookie sheet so the extra liquid can drain out. There will be a lot. I added a small amount of grated zucchini as did others. I think it keeps ground turkey moist. I made two meat loaves from the recipe and froze one so I would have it for another meal in the future. Let it cool a bit before cutting and it will slice nicely.

I had 16 oz instead of the recommended 20 oz.  maybe that is what made it dry for us.  The topping was great, but the entire meatloaf was so-so for us.  My husband loves to eat healthier and was so excited to find this recipe, but probably will not make it again.

I made this for my family tonight and we loved it. The brown sugar paste, as written here, didn’t turn out as a paste. I added another tablespoon of brown sugar and it probably could have used a 4th for consistency, but I was afraid it would be too sweet. Next time, I won't add a teaspoon of water. But I will definitely make this again. Easy and very tasty.

This is a fantastic recipe, I did cut the hot sauce to 1 teaspoon and added 1 tablespoon of  Heinz Chili Sauce, and the flavor was as good as any meatloaf I have ever eaten, none was leftover so I would suggest making a double recipe so you can have meatloaf sandwich's and other leftover meatloaf dishes.

Pretty good. I usually make my meatloaf with turkey and lean beef so it was different. Just the turkey seemed a little crumbly. It needs some sauce. We just used ketchup. The quinoa was a nice addition for color and texture.

This turned out GREAT!! the flavor was fantastic and texture couldn’t be beat. I would add celery to it as well. Pairs well with Mac and cheese.

So I didn’t have 20 oz of turkey (I had almost 11oz) so I added a few cups of steamed carrots and cauliflower. Also, instead of hot sauce I used a little cayenne pepper. It turned out soooo good, and it was pretty easy to make.

We both loved it, and as stated, because it is not in a pan, the juices run out as opposed to steaming it.   Flavor superb just as it is!  Definitely enough for lunch tomorrow!

I followed the instructions as written.  I used Green Dragon hot sauce from Trader Joe’s instead of a traditional red hot sauce. This type of hot sauce did not cause it to be spicy at all as some reviewers said; it just added some flavor. I baked them in a regular size muffin tin (it made 6 overflowing “muffins”) at 350 for 30 minutes.  These held their shape nicely and were very moist.

I made this over the weekend. I bought 2 one lb. packages of ground turkey, not realizing that the recipe's package was 20 oz. I doubled all ingredients, plus the extra egg and mixed it all up - it was like soup! I know that I didn't have the right quantity of turkey, so I ran to the store and bought another pound. The math said I should have only needed to add 1/2 pound, but I ended up adding the whole pound and it was still very wet, but could keep a shape. I will attempt to make again with the correct amount of turkey, and not double it and see if it comes out less wet. That being said -- the taste is PHENOMENAL!! I also substituted the hot sauce with BBQ sauce. My husband hates eating recipes that use ground turkey instead of beef, and he says he can't stand quinoa. I didn't tell him what was in the meal - just that it was meatloaf. He ate it up!! I still haven't told him, yet, because we have quite a bit left to eat. But really, really yummy. I will be making it again.

I made this with flax meal and water (1T flax meal +3T water=1egg). I did not make the paste. It was very flavorful! My husband recently had a heart attack so I’m looking for heart healthy recipes to replace the old standbys. We both were so pleasantly surprised by the wonderful texture and flavor. I will be making this again. I might try to make meatballs from this recipe.

I halved the hot pepper sauce b/c all the reviews said it was too spicy and barely got any heat so will probably use the whole amount if I make this dish again. I also found it a little too sweet for my taste...I'm assuming it's from the paste so I will also trying reducing the sugar in the paste next time.

Just okay for us. I liked the turkey/quinoa but the spices didn't work for me. If I made it again, I'd sub bbq for the hot sauce. I followed the recipe exactly. Husband said to go back to my "normal" meatloaf recipe.

Very tasty! I only had 1 pound of ground turkey but the proportions still turned out okay. I also used bbq sauce instead of hot sauce. Next time I’ll omit the water from the glaze because it made it really runny and it slid right off the meatloaf. Will definitely make this again!

We loved this Meatloaf and will make it again. When we posted a pick on social media we had friends ask for the recipe and wanted to make it also. Next time I want to try ketchup, Worcestershire and a little brown sugar for the topping. When I reheated it I made this for a topping and it was even better.

I was craving meatloaf but wanted to be health-conscious. This hit the spot! I had to open a whole can of tomato paste, so after using the one tablespoon in the meatloaf mixture, I mixed the rest of the can in with the brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce for the topping. I added a splash more Worcestershire sauce, a few shakes of garlic salt, and 2 tablespoons more of water and frosted the meatloaf with the stuff like a cake. Excellent! I can’t wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!

Love this meatloaf!  I typically HATE meatloaf.  Not a fan of ground beef in general and the standard meatloaf is usually drowning in fat.  The flavor is amazing, a little sweet, a little spicy.  I make this for my husband who is a huge meatloaf fan.  He likes this version better than any other types.  And it's so much better for him!

Made this with 3 lbs of ground turkey, basically doubling the recipe and it was outstanding! The family loved it!  I use ground turkey all the time and this was exceptional.   Has just a little bite from the hot sauce which makes it noticeable but not too hot.  This will be made on a regular basis.

I was searching for what to do with a pound of ground turkey and found this recipe. My 7 year old son loved it! I did modify it slightly because I didn’t have all of the ingredients...I used 2 tbsp ketchup, 2 tbsp bbq sauce and 1 tsp sriracha sauce instead of the tomato paste, Worcester sauce and brown sugar. I made it in an 8x8 Pyrex...when baked, I drained off a little water from the top and covered it in cheddar then continued to bake until the cheese melted.

I used ground chicken and had to reduce the amount of hot sauce.  I will make it again and will play around with the amount of the hot sauce.  Plus I think I will omit the water for the brown sugar rub.  Just the Worcestershire and brown sugar would be good enough

This a very tasty turkey meatloaf with excellent texture.  I used 1/2 chipolte and 1/2 regular hot sauce, then because i could only get 16oz packages or turkey, I added 1 slice of bread in crumbs as it seemed too moist on mixing.  It was really good! Will make this again!!!

Delicious! Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical that this would be as good as the reviews indicated, but this recipe is absolutely worthy of all the 5 star ratings. Prep was relatively easy and the taste and texture were out of this world! I'll definitely be making this one again. Thanks for the recipe, Drew!

This is my fav and I make it all the time. It's also great for my gluten free and dairy free friends. Super healthy and easy to make. I don't have any issues with this recipe and I usually make it with a pound ( because finding a 20oz package is hard for some reason) and it's all white meat and it always turns out great. Sometimes I use ketchup if I don't have tomato paste on hand and I also add it to the glazing mixture too.

Love this recipe.  I have made many times and it never fails.  I really don’t change much other than I use 1.5lbs of ground turkey and I also add some onion powder, garlic powder, and some ground mustard to the mixture.  I also use my own sauce.  This stays moist and is an excellent way to get your family to eat more quinoa.

OMG! Awesome!!!! My 3 kids all who don't even like quinoa --- so they say --- loved it! I left out the hot sauce, added extra egg & parm cheese and threw in some fresh parsley.  It's printed and going to be added to the recipe book.  Keeper!

Delicious!  I made just as described except for using larger package of ground turkey (an extra four ounces), and so using two tablespoons of tomato paste, two cloves of garlic, and a larger onion.

I Butchered this recipe! Instead of quinoa I used rolled oats, adding 1 more egg, and instead of READING the amounts I added whatever! Ex. 1 tbsp tomato paste turned into the whole can! Regardless, the loaf turned out Amazingly!

This was my first time to ever make anything with ground turkey, so I was glad to read the comment about not putting it in a pan because it would be soggy. I followed the recipe as written, except I didn't include the hot sauce. I used red quinoa, which added a nice bit of color to the finished meatloaf. It tasted wonderful, although a bit too dry for my taste. I'm going to have the leftovers with my homemade cranberry sauce to add some moisture. Overall, great recipe and one I'll try again.

I've experimented with quite a few turkey meatloaf recipes and this was probably the best one I've made. I loved the tip about using a baking sheet instead of a loaf pan to keep it from steaming and getting mushy. That and the quinoa helped give it a firm but tender texture. My husband is not a fan of quinoa but didn't even notice it was in there. The flavor was great, though slightly salty for my taste. I would probably just use one teaspoon of salt next time. I loved the hot sauce--it wasn't too spicy but added a nice little kick.  
My one issue was that, although I followed the recipe exactly (2 T brown sugar, 2 t Worcestershire, 1 t water)the sauce was not a paste. It was very thin and ran down the sides of the loaf, pooling around the edges.  But it tasted good regardless.

This is a tasty turkey meatloaf.  Went easy on the hot sauce, but still quite flavorful.  I was doubtful about not using a loaf pan, but it worked out great!  Thanks for sharing .   Made extra quinoa for an egg, almond, onion, cranberry breakfast.

It was very good, I only had 1lbs of ground turkey so I added a leftover of ~5oz  tofu, 2 eggs instead of 1,  green onions, half the salt indicated, and a dash of hot pepper sauce. The glaze was a tad too sweet, I think next time I'll add some dijon mustard and less sugar, and use a bit more quinoa.  The meatloaf did not crumble, as others indicated here, and wasn't dry either. I cooked it on a flat baking sheet.

I really enjoyed this meatloaf.  It was very moist and flavourful.   The only change I made was I used a ketchup based topping instead, since my family is ketchup obsessed.  My only complaint was from an aesthetic perspecitve, it was very soft (as mentioned in the directions) and that made it very difficult to mold, so it was quite a flat loaf.

Thanks, Drew!!  Love this recipe - and your explanation of how beef and poultry cook differently was really helpful.  For what it's worth, I keep a container of already-cooked quinoa in the freezer for occasions like this one so I can skip the step of cooking and cooling it and just add what I need to a recipe.  A few seconds (or so) in the microwave on low power and the frozen quinoa separates easily when poked with a butter knife.  Thanks again.  (c:

I agree, this was the BEST meatloaf I have ever had. I took note of the modifications, used Tbsp of ketchup instead of hot sauce, used two eggs, and made sure to free-form the loaf on a backing sheet vs. using a meatloaf pan. I also cooked the quinoa with onion mix soup and just increased the water. It was amazing!

Made this tonight- was really good.  I added a green bell pepper and about 5 or 6 extra cloves of garlic.  I also added a tablespoon of the tomato paste to the top glaze and made double the amount of glaze.  I put 1/2 on top for baking, then when it was done baking, I brushed on the rest of the glaze and broiled it for 3 minute- delicious!!

This meatloaf is delicious!  I have never cooked quinoa but it was a snap and it did add a good texture to the meatloaf.  I did not have any tomato paste so I used ketchup.  I also added about 2 TBsp of ketchup to the topping. If you do this, TAKE NOTE - don't put the topping on until about the last 10-15 min or it will burn!  I used a 16oz pack of turkey and I did decrease the hot sauce to 1 tsp.  I will be making this again!

I've made turkey meat loaves before, and quite honestly, they were very bland. Had some ground turkey on hand - thought I'd give this one a try. Followed recipe exactly-- turned out great! Very flavorful! I will search no more for a great turkey meatloaf recipe - I found it here!

I followed the recipe exactly, and this turned out perfect.  Much better than expected.  I was expecting a healthy recipe like turkey meatloaf (which doesn't sound really great, honestly) to be kind of bland.  But this was anything but - it was moist and full of flavor.  Easy to make ahead of time and take to work for lunches, and so good I don't mind eating leftovers for a while.

This was unbelievably tasty; it really lived up to it's rating!! Next time I would reduce the salt though as we found it a bit salty and maybe add some grated carrot so that it reminds me of my grandma's recipe. I will def make again.

Wow! I never expected the flavor explosion from turkey meatloaf! This is the best ever and will be in my recipe rotation from now on. My husband loves his beef, but he really liked this, we both agree it is a keeper! I didn't have ketchup and so I used the Chile sauce mentioned in one of the reviews. When we sat down to eat my husband offered ketchup to our guests, and I said well that's great, but we don't have any. Everyone agreed there was such great flavor that nothing else was needed!

I loved this recipe!!! I did not use the hot pepper sauce neither the brown sugar! Instead after almost done I took it out of the oven and spread cream of mushroom diluted with milk, then I put it back on the oven for 10 more minutes!  It was perfect!!!!

I added an extra egg like suggested... I don't think it was needed because there was almost a film on top afterwards that didn't look very appetizing. I also added tomato paste to the glaze on top which was very delicious. Overall I think this recipe was good, I'm not sure if I'll make it again or not.

Super moist, not too spicy, and no messy loaf pan.  I added a chopped jalapeno for some color.  Due to a shellfish allergy, substituted ketchup/cholula mix for the Worcestershire sauce.  Great meal - can't wait for leftovers!

this was amazing! The first time around I had to wing it, I was missing a few ingredients. Went with the ketchup and mustard topping as I was lacking the topping ingredients. Also missing an onion.
A little mashed potatoes on the side covered in sauteed muchrooms
Going to double it just so I can get some leftovers

Great recipe! Had no tomato paste so I used ketchup. Also used ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and worcestershire as the glaze. Flavorful and moist. Will definitely make again!

I made this recipe exactly as written except I only added a few drops of hot sauce. The flavor and moistness of this meatloaf were amazing. The few drops of hot sauce added just enough flavor without being overpowering and the quinoa added a really nice nutty flavor. Loved it!!

I haven't had meat loaf in a really long time.  I was a vegetarian for 10 years and just starting eating fish and poultry again.  This recipe was great.  We have gluten allergies at my house so having the quinoa was a great addition and added to the flavor without overpowering.  I initially thought the hot sauce would be too much but it tasted perfect, not too hot.

For sure best ground turkey meatloaf I've ever tried. I used "Wyko" meatloaf topping suggestion YUM! this definitely helped a lot because it added such a perfect hint of sweetness. GREAT RECIPE!

just made this tonight and it's great! Buddy's words were 'it is heavenly'.  :)   I added two thinly sliced carrots and used Jim Beam bab sauce on top. We don't eat red meat so this was a great alternative. Thanks!!

I thought the topping was too sweet, and the loaf was a bit crumbly, but my criticism is of the texture. My grandkids, ages 4,6 & 7, did not care for this fresh baked. However, they thought it was edible the second day sliced thin on a sandwich with ketchup. Chilled, it held together solidly. I might try again without the sugary top and with herbs instead of hot sauce, using Drew's hint of an extra egg and baking it flat to aid in holding it together.

Amazing!  Trying to eat better and decided to try quinoa for the first time.  This is the best meatloaf ever.  The tabasco, pepper etc gave it a great kick.  I would serve this to even my hardcore meat n tatters friends.  WI'll defiantly try again.  The brown sugar "rub" was actually liquid not paste though.  Not a negative...just FYI.

I have made this too many times to count since discovering the recipe.  I use quinoa flakes instead of quinoa and Thai sweet chilli sauce and ketchup.  Excellent - turns out perfect every time.

Make this quite often, however, use ground chicken instead of turkey.  Think it's a tad tastier.  And, although I made the original recipe just as Drew submitted (think that's only fair when reviewing), I have since experimented adding sauteed, chopped red, green, or yellow peppers; banana peppers; capers; whatever may strike my fancy!  Thanks Drew for the original!  It's a keeper.

So great and healthy. I would cook the quinoa in chicken broth but it is not necessary. Even my kids liked it.

I was extremely pleased with this recipe, it was very tasty and delicious, and I love that the quinoa replaces the need for breadcrumbs.  I followed the recipe to a T and wouldn't change a thing.  My husband loved it too, I made it with a baked sweet potato recipe that I also found on this site.  Thanks!!!

This was a great recipe.  Was making it for my dad who doesn't eat beef.  I just added bbq sauce on top of the loaf prior to cooking.  Also used ketchup instead of tomato paste and also put in soy sauce instead of the salt.  I'm going to make again today in cupcake tins and freeze them so dad can use them out as needed!

I love this recipe.  The quinoa adds texture to the turkey.  I've made it a couple times and settled on a few changes.  I double the quinoa, omit the black pepper, half the salt, and bake for 70 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a really great alternative to the normal greasy meatloaf.  I sometimes add more quinoa and less ground turkey and I always add lots of chopped spinach. The tablespoon of hot sauce is a bit much, that should be "to taste"

Excellent recipe.  Only substitution I made was used hot horseradish instead of hot sauce. Next time I'll use hot sauce. It's a keeper.

So delicious! I'm making it again this week. I added diced sauteed red bell pepper as a vegetable and it worked splendidly! I may add an extra egg as the recipe's author Drew suggested next time and I plan on doubling the recipe so I'll have some for later. Two of us finished the single meatloaf quite easily. Such a great recipe!

Wonderful! I used what I had on hand: Italian-seasoned ground turkey, ketchup (no tomato paste), and left out the hot sauce. My husband (who would NOT even taste quinoa) finished off the first one took out three more packages of turkey. I also followed the suggestions, adding another egg, and forming the loafs on a baking pan. I will put foil on the pan for easier clean-up this time. Thank you for a healthier version of meatloaf!

My husband said this was the best meatloaf he has ever had and he is a steak and potato's guy. Yeah! I get to make it again.
Instead of tomato paste I used BBQ sauce and instead of hot sauce I did red pepper flakes. Awesome!  I also speed up the carmalizing process with a dash of baking soda

I've searched high and low for a healthy, yummy meatloaf and I'm so happy I found this!! This is a staple in my house!! Adding the Quinoa is genius!! The only thing different that I do is add a little less hot sauce (only because my daughter doesn't like spice as much as my husband and I do!) and I add a full cup of cooked Quinoa (because why not?!) it just gives it more texture and helps hold the turkey together even BETTER! And I use BBQ sauce on top, instead of the ketchup or the glaze they say to make, I use "Sweet Baby Rays" and OMG....delish!!

I left out the hot sauce and used scallions instead of onions since I had them from my farm share. My whole family really liked this even after they discovered it was made with quinoa!!! I have failed with turkey meatloaf before which must've been due to cooking it in a loaf pan instead of how this taught me. Thanks so much!

This is the first review I have ever written on this site! This recipe has brought me out of the shadows to write a review!  It's delicious and I plan on making many more of them as it is a healthier and oh so tasty version of meatloaf.  I'm so happy I tried this recipe!!!  I think I added more onions and didn't do the tomato paste the same but it still came out AMAZING!  Can't wait to make more.

I did use only 1lb of turkey (97% fat free from Trader Joe's) not the 20 oz. called for in the recipe and I baked for only 30 minutes.

Amazing!!  I added 1 medium shredded zucchini, and 1 large shredded carrot to the onion and garlic mixture and sautéed. I also added 2 TBSP of A-1 Sauce to the mixture.  Coated half of the loaf with ketchup, and the other half with a spicy bbq sauce.  My picky eater ate three servings!

Awesome recipe!!!!!!!! The only changes I made was the addition of an extra clove of garlic and I omitted the water from the glaze and used 2 tsp ketchup instead. I have been searching for the perfect Turkey Meatloaf recipe and this is it!!!!!! :)

I have made this recipe many times and my whole family, including my picky eater, loves it.  Wonderful flavor and so much healthier than beef meat loaf.  I usually double the paste that goes on top and I have never added the hot pepper sauce because I don't have any and my little ones don't like it.  The last time I made it I didn't have any quinoa on hand so I substituted a 1/4 cup oats and ketchup for the tomato paste. I also was in a hurry and didn't sauté the onion, just chopped it up and threw it in and it still turned out great.  I do prefer the original recipe though, especially the nutrients and flavor the quinoa adds.

Really good - my husband and I preferred it over ground beef and my 3 1/2 year old even gave it a thumbs up! I did add a handful of cheese and shredded carrots. I also just used tomato sauce to top it. Officially in the rotation.

Yummy! I just made this meatloaf yesterday and is was so moist and flavorful. Mmmm Mmmm.  I did have to make a substitution, I added BBQ sauce instead of of the Worcestershire sauce (I didn't have enough for a teaspoon) so I don't know how much difference it makes but it still was terrific.  I also added some red pepper, just because I like it that way.   I think adding the hot sauce is great, It actually helps me to stop eatting as much.

Extremely yummy. Added 3 drops of ghost pepper sauce instead of the regular hot sauce, and didn't do the tomato paste because I forgot to buy it. Turned out perfect anyway! Roasted some bell peppers in the same pan as the meatloaf.

I never liked meatloaf growing up and I loved this. I didn't have tomato paste but I had 1/2 a can of tomatoes with green chilis so I blended it and used it instead. I also used the tomatoes in lieu of water for the topping. I baked it on a cookie sheet and the texture was perfect.

I just tried this last night and, WOW, am I happy! I followed other suggestions by adding a second egg, half the brown sugar, cooking the quinoa in chicken broth and a tad more hot sauce. It took the full 50 minutes for me but turned out beautifully! Not dry or bland at all ( I didn't add ANY salt, but I did find a garlic/herb pre-seasoned quinoa). I also added red bell, zucchini and celery. I will be putting this up against my mom's famous meatloaf very soon! Thanks for sharing Drew!

This was an amazing recipe!! I only did a few things differently and my whole family loved it! Instead of water, I cooked the quinoa with chicken broth. I doubled the garlic and added a pinch each of rosemary and thyme. Also, I left out the hot sauce. It was moist and delicious! I'll definitely be making this many more times to come :)

great recipe, very tasty.
I substituted the olive oil with coconut oil.
Also, ran out of Worcestershire sauce so instead of the paste I lightly brushed with BBQ sauce after molding, gave the outside a nice coating of flavor.

Winner winner turkey dinner! I'm glad I read the reviews first or might have just put it in a loaf pan. I halved the hot sauce and added mushrooms, just cause I like them :) This recipe does not disappoint!

I  didn't give 5 stars because of me:  I don't normally review recipes, and I don't often like reviewers that change recipes and then review.  But I am doing doing both.  I had some left over wild rice and (fresh) ground turkey and was looking for a meat loaf recipe for both.  This is the closest I came too.  Instead of quinoa I used the left over wild rice.  For the topping plain old ketchup.  Everything else was pretty much exactly on. Oops, I added mushrooms too. LOVED IT!  Thank you for giving a tasty recipe I could work off of with the ingredients I had!

I really liked it and frankly am surprised by the less positive reviews. It's healthy, easy to make and my daughter really liked it. I made it exactly per the recipe, and (against my nature) formed it into a loaf and putting it on top of a foil-lined sheet instead of a loaf pan and found it tasty and not at all dried out as others have said. (Now, if I had used a normal sized loaf pan dryness may have been a problem because it wouldn't have filled one fully) The only complaint that I have with the recipe is I think less brown sugar would be a good thing. I don't really think meatloaf needs 2 tablespoons but that's just me trying to be healthy.

This was okay.  I didn't use Worcestershire sauce because I don't like it.  I used a little browning sauce instead.  I used barbeque sauce on top.  I used 2 eggs and had no problem with it falling apart.  As it was cooking I used a paper towel a few times to absorb the water/juice that was surrouning it so it wouldn't be mushy.  I cut the leftovers into pieces and froze individually and will eat like a hamburger.  I think with burger fixins it will be good.  Update:  I've defrosted the frozen leftovers and put on an english muffin and ate them as burger.  They were much better.

I can't believe I made a beefless meatloaf that I like!  This was really good.  I read the reviews and made a ton of changes.  First of all I used 1 lb of chopped chicken breast meat and boiled my quinoa in chicken broth instead of water. I added about 1/4 c italian seasoned panko bread crumbs. I used a couple dashes of hot sauce, not a whole tbsp and it didn't even need that.  The pepper gives this enough of a kick (for my taste anyway).  I also used plain tomato sauce instead of tomato paste.  Last I added about 1 tbsp of the tomato sauce to the worcestershire/brown sugar topping and omitted the water.  I formed the mix into 2 loaves since everyone in my house loves the ends and baked for 35 minutes.  It was perfect.

I doubled the recipe and added 2 shredded carrots and 2 shredded zuccinis to the mix.  I also left the tomato paste out because I didn't have any and I'm not a huge fan of it anyway.

This meatloaf is delicious and freezes SO well.  I let it cool, cut them into individual pieces and froze them for quick meals (I live alone).  Reheat for 3 minutes, as delicious as it was out of the oven.

This was great!  I just so happened to have some quinoa, and figured I'd give it a try.  The only thing is I can never get the loaf to stay in a loaf shape.  It eventually spreads almost flat across the whole baking pan.  But it still tastes delicious!

My Husband and I just made this recipe with some changes based on reviews and what we had in cabinet. We did 2 eggs, no worcestershire sauce, used a full small can of tomato paste for the loaf. We also did half the sugar and replaced worcestershire sauce with hot sauce for the coating. Since we changed it so much it was hard to tell if it was cooked so we cooked it for about 30 mins longer than recipe said. It turned out well and was very filling.

I tied this tonight, using Stubbs BBQ sauce with a bit of hot sauce instead of the paste, brown sugar, etc. It was good and made generous servings. However, I think I will stick to adding oatmeal, not quinoa. It's not as expensive and time consuming. Thanks for sharing it, though.

Wow! Not so much!  I followed this recipe to the "T" and it was nasty.  It was dry and grainy and had a strange after taste. I am known to be an excellent cook and this just turned out terrible.  Won't be making this again.

Absolutely loved it.  If you're concerned about the quinoa, you cannot taste it and it is very good for you.  This will definitely be a staple for us.

WOW!!!! This was delicious.  I didn't have tomato paste, believe it or not, so I used 1/4 salsa verde. I didn't have hot sauce either. Also, I added a half cup of chopped red and yellow peppers for a wonderful flavor and color.  I'm SURE the original recipe is just as good but I didn't have all the ingredients and then wanted to use up my peppers.  I put it in a glass loaf pan and then turned it upside down onto a foil lined pan.  That way it was easier to form into a loaf rather than doing it by hand.  Enjoy!

This was fantastic and it sliced up so nicely (I waited the ten minutes).  I also did add some panko crumbs but next time I will try it without as mine was a little dry as a result. We really loved the recipe and will certainly be making it again.  Thanks Drew.

Made it using Quinoa Flakes, I used a tad bit over the 1/4 cup.  I skipped the first step and just added the flakes to the meat mixture then put the whole thing in my Meatloaf pan.  It came out great!

Strong work Drew!! Thanks for the recipe, this dish was amazing. Simple, super moist , & flavorful. I followed the directions pretty  closely minus a pinch less of salt & sugar & 1tbs less of hot sauce. I also added one red pepper to the sauté mix & about 2 cups of shredded habanero  jack cheese. I made 10 servings & am so glad I did!!  The quinoa was a great tasting  & healthier substitute. Hands down the best meatloaf! :D

This is hands down my favorite meatloaf recipe. I did take a few suggestions from others. I added an additional egg and 1 cup of sharp cheddar cheese. I topped it with the sauce suggested by one reviewer, 1/4 ketchup, 1/4 brown sugar, 1 TB mustard, dash of Worcester which was very tasty. I made two loafs but forgot to add the tomato paste to one of the loafs and couldn't tell the difference. The two loafs fed my family of five with leftovers for my husband to take to work the next day and a plate to give to my Mom. Thanks for the yummy recipe. It's a keeper!

I added tomato paste to the top. Excellent flavor and does not taste like the bland turkey you would expect.

Just made this recipe exactly as stated except I ketchup instead of tomato paste since I didn't have any on hand. I just took it out of the oven- not only does it smell great, but it tastes amazing, too! So flavorful and a great way to incorporate quinoa into your meal. Thanks Drew!

I never made turkey meatloaf before.  I actually had some ground turkey and quinoa amd all the other ingredients I had so I thought I'd give it a try.  I was amazed at how moist and delicious it came out.  The only thing I changed was instead of using hot sauce i substituted it with Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe I will be making this again.

This was a very good recipe and I love that it doesn't use the traditional beef and bread crumbs. My boyfriend even ended up falling in love with this when he hates meatloaf! The only suggestion I would have is to substitute the hot sauce with BBQ sauce and to also add about 2 TBSP more liquid than the recipe calls for based off how my turned out a little too dry for my liking. All around a wonderful a recipe though and it now a new favorite!

Love this recipe. I use finely diced raw onion & garlic without sautéing first. I also mix in the remainder of the can of tomato paste into the topping.

Really delicious and easy to make. Thumbs up from the whole family including small children. I did not use the hot sauce but added a healthy shake of Hot Mexican Chili Powder. I also added a cup of shredded cheddar, which definitely gave it a tasty texture, and the extra egg. Next time I will try to add some more chopped, sautéed veggies to see how that holds up.  Definitely line your pan with foil, as the loaf runs and oozes quite a bit, and the cheese runs out. I rolled up the sides of the foils to make a lip, which I also recommend.

I substituted ground venison for turkey, cooked in a greased bunt pan with ketchup in the bottom so that once inverted becomes a sauce on top.  I serve it with english peas mounded in the middle of the ring and mashed potatoes surrounding the ring.  This works well as a meal to take to someone.

I made the recipe as stated. The texture was great with the quinoa, and baking it on sheet allowed the fat to run off. It had a unique flavor, but really broke down into a basic pepper, sweet and spicy flavor. Black pepper was the prominent feature, along with sweet/salt from the Worcestershire and brown sugar. Had to think to taste the hot pepper sauce and onions. To cook the quinoa for texture wasn't worth the time. We won't make this again.

I've always found meatloaf to be just okay no matter how good the reviews were, so I was actually surprised with how tasty this recipe turned out! I was skeptical about the quinoa, but you don't even notice it. Minus one star though because I did tweak it a bit per other reviews, as well as swapped a few other ingredients to match what I had on hand. I used ketchup instead of tomato paste, BBQ sauce instead of hot sauce ("hot sauce" was a little vague since there's so many different kinds out there with unique levels of heat and flavor profiles, so I went with a surefire thing) and two eggs instead of one. The flavor and texture were perfect. I also found the glaze to be just a bit too sweet and might just replace it straight up with BBQ sauce the next time around (and there will be a next time!). I also like how easy this recipe is to halve, which is good for small households like mine. I'd say that half a loaf could feed three people reasonably. This is definitely my go-to meatloaf recipe from now on!

I doubled the recipe and it came out delicious.  I added a little extra hot sauce to the brown sugar glaze sprinkled over the top.  I baked it in a 9" square casserole dish, and found that it needed extra time due to the doubled size.  Total baking time was around 1.25 hours.

Be sure to really combine the turkey and quinoa well.  Failure to do so will leave unconsolidated quinoa at the bottom of the dish.

I thought this meatloaf was delicious - I made it as directed, but found it could have used another egg to hold it together.  It was crumbly even after sitting for a good 10 minutes, although I found when I was putting the leftovers away, it had firmed up.  The taste of the glaze was delicious and I liked the texture that the quinoa gave it.  Followed Drew's directions and cooked it on a foil covered cookie sheet instead of a pan and it came out just right.  Thanks!!

I didn't use any tomato in this recipe, replaced Worcestershire sauce with coconut aminos, made the glaze from a mix of coconut sugar, apple cider vinegar and coconut aminos. I baked it on the parchment paper. Yum! My husband, who hates quinoa couldn't taste it. Will cook it again and again. Thanks!

This had great flavour, however I found that it didn't stay together well with when slicing. I followed the recipe to the tee, however I may change a few ratio's to get mine to stay together better. Overall this was a wonderful recipe!

First thing I heard from the kids when I told them I was making meatloaf was "ew gross!" Ummmm.... They flipping LOVED it!!! All my girls cleared their plates. I adjusted the recipe as follows: left out the onions and garlic because I didn't have them on hand. I used 1/2 cup of quinoa rather than 1/4 cup. I believe it made the loaf firmer. I added garlic salt and some beef seasoning rub that I had on hand and used franks red hot in place of the chile sauce. I added about 2tablespoons of tomato paste to the glaze and cooked to melt the brown sugar. It tasted like homemade BBQ sauce. All in all this was a hit at my house. The loaf was nice and light and felt pretty healthy. I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE THIS ONE AGAIN!

I'm eating leftovers and I have to say this meatloaf is much better the day after than the day off. The flavor is good... it's the texture we didn't care for too much. Sort of on the mushy side. Today the texture is more on the fluffy side and it tastes really good. Unfortunately since my BF refused to take leftovers for lunch (he ALWAYS does) I will likely not make this again. Also, the only changes I made was to add an extra egg and I cut down on the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon and added 1 tablespoon of grey poupon.

So yummy! I thought it might be more of a hassle than I was willing to do for a meatloaf with making quinoa, sauteeing onions & a glaze but it was super easy and quick. Hubby loved it. I followed recipe exactly but made extra glaze. ; )

Moist meatloaf with a wonderful flavor! 
I was a little worried about the texture being so moist - and I thought it would just sort of lose it's shape on the tin when I turned it out - but it stayed relatively mounded.  The only substitution I made was I used chicken broth instead of water to cook my quinoa.

I loved using quinoa instead of breadcrumbs in this meatloaf recipe. I didn't have tomato paste, so I used ketchup instead. I also left out the hot sauce. I sauteed mushrooms with the onion/garlic mix. We loved the glaze on top. Great recipe, will make again :)

It was very, very dry. Try the Incredibly cheesy turkey meatloaf from this site.  It is 100 times better

I had trouble forming it into a loaf shape and it didn't look great when I took it out of the oven but it was delicious!  My husband and I both liked the brown sugar/worcestire topping. Will make this again.

I LOVE this recipe. I have made it several times. It is better than recipes with hamburger. I add a little extra tomato paste and skip the Worchestire sauce.

I made this for the first time tonight and it came out delicious! So easy. I am always collecting quinoa recipes and coincidentally gluten free recipes as well. I did follow the author's advice and added the extra egg for moistness. I also decided to chop in some celery because I had some on hand. I didn't even have a loaf pan... I just put it in an 8x8 pyrex pan and it still came out presentable and easy to slice.

Delicious!! I made it exactly the way the recipe called for the first time and it turned out great.  Tonight I made it with ground chicken instead.  I also used two tablespoons of spaghetti sauce instead of tomato paste and a healthy dollop of franks red hot instead of hot pepper sauce. I omitted the worcestershire sauce because I'm not a fan, and didnt put the topping sauce.. and it was SOO fantastic.  My picky hubby ate it (with a little ketchup) and even my 2 year old daughter gobbled it up.  I recommend this for everyone!  And to Drew.. Love it.  I did make this in a loaf dish and cooked it at 375 for 40 minutes.. it cut beautifully

My husband raved about this. I mean, he went on & on and he NEVER does that about anything. I did customize a bit though: 1/2 turkey & 1/2 beef, added a 1/2C pureed zucchini (to hide a veggie from hubby & toddler), added more quinoa, omitted the hot pepper sauce because of my toddler, used garlic powder since I didn't have any cloves on hand, used ketchup instead of tomato paste because I didn't have any on hand. Then, I changed the topping to 1T dijon, 1T ketchup, 1T brown sugar and 2 splashes of Worcestershire. And I cooked it for 50mins in one of those As Seen On TV meatloaf pans and it worked great! My toddler even scarfed it down and she is picky! Yay! Will definitely make this again soon! :)

My husband isn't a huge fan of red meat, so typical meatloaf is not his favorite but I was craving meatloaf the other night so thought I'd give this recipe a try.  I though it was just okay.  Hubby asked to have it put into the rotation and said he loved it.  Will make again.

5 stars!  This has been in our regular dinner rotation for several years, it is so good.  The quinoa adds great texture.  The only thing I do differently is add sauteed onions and shredded mozzerella cheese, and top with a combo of ketchup and BBQ sauce.  Trust me, give this recipe a try, you will be happy you did.  The fact that you can stick to the recipe pretty much as written is a sure sign of its excellence!  Thanks so much for submitting.

Really liked this except the topping was a bit sweet.  We also like spicy so I will probably add some chopped jalapeno next time. Didn't have hot sauce or tomato paste (none open) so used ketchup like another reviewer suggested. Texture good baked on the foil covered sheet.  Definitely do this again.

The only thing I changed was to add red bell pepper, carrots and celery. I liked the changed but it was still a bit bland. I might throw some chicken bullion in to give it more flavor. But a very good base recipe you can change to your taste.

I'm a terrible cook but can follow a recipe.  If the recipe is good then the dish will be good.  I was unconvinced as I put this in the oven - that it would hold it shape and taste good.  My skepticism wasn't needed.  Recipe was fast and fantastic.  Turned out moist and flavourful. So Thank you!!! 
*note:  needed to make gluten-free adjustments. Used Lundberg's brown rice couscous and GF worcheshire sauce. I also didn't have tomato paste and subed in ketchup.

Loved this recipe!  It was a perfect marriage of healthy for me and down home cooking for my husband.  Really a great recipe and one I have already passed on.  It has a definite spice to it though so if you have kids you may want to cut out some of the hot pepper.

I doubled this, added 6 chopped slices of turkey bacon, covered the top with turkey bacon, used hot pepper paste instead of hot sauce, added a red pepper, chopped mushrooms (no one is the wiser and it's good for them), oregano, basil, an extra egg, and cooked the quinoa in chicken stock.  Can you tell that it's hard for me to follow recipes?  It did inspire me, wasn't dry, and the family loved it so much there was barely any leftover.

Very good recipe.  I was looking for meatloaf made with turkey that actually had flavor.  And I LOVE the quinoa.  I took others advice and added more egg whites and a little more worchestershire..  Perfect.   Thanks for sharing

This was very good and easy to make.  I would give it 4.5 stars if I could, as I found it to be too salty.  And this is coming from someone who loves salt!  I will definitely make again, but next time won't add the salt.  The W sauce gives it plenty of salt, I see no need to add more.

I've tried this recipe over and over and it is now a staple in our home.  It has great flavor and surprising amount of moisture for a turkey loaf.  Make it exactly as directed and it will be great!  Watch the time and temperature of your meatloaf.  If your loaf is flatter, it will take less time to cook.

A new favorite!  Make sure you pay attention to how Drew explains to bake it on a sheet rather than in a pan or Pyrex dish; it makes all the difference in the world for keeping the loaf firm but not dried out.

Very wonderful recipe! My husband - who is a "regular" meatloaf lover even enjoyed this recipe. I did add a bit of ketchup to the topping. This is now our "regular" meatloaf recipe. 

Note: 2nd time I made it i added grated cheese & carrots to the recipe, still wonderful

Have made this many times since!

Outstanding!  I have actually never made any kind of meatloaf before and according to my husband and niece, this one was fantastic! moist, flavourful and substantial.  the only thing i would do differently is thicken the paste for the top - mine was a little think and most of it leaked off and carmelized to the tin foil.  I will definitely make this again!

This was absolutely delicious.  I have to admit, I was fairly skeptical but after reading the reviews, I thought I would give it a shot.  I did use a higher fat content of turkey instead of the extremely lean ground white turkey.  I think that the addition of barbecue sauce next time would make it even better; this time I just mixed some in with the sauce for the topping and served some on the side as well.  I don't know if using a higher fat content defeats the purpose of cooking with turkey at all, but it was very good and I will be making it again.  In the future, I may try using ground turkey breast with either shredded apple or zucchini to add some moisture.  My boyfriend cleaned up all the leftovers which was so disappointing to me...I was looking forward to cold meatloaf sandwiches with spicy mustard!  Next time I'm hiding the leftovers.

Wonderful!! Everyone in the family loved it!  The quinoa adds the perfect texture to replace a traditional bread crumb meatloaf. The brown sugar glaze has a nice sweetness.  Next time my family requested we try a buffalo wing type sauce for the topping to go with the zing of the meatloaf. Can't wait to make it again! Thanks for the great recipe!

delicious! I ran out of eggs and it still came out fine..and I also opted for a few squiggles of organic ketchup instead of brown sugar/worcestershire and it was sooo good! And easy, easy!!! Me and my kids love it and I plan to incorporate into my routine for sure!

Yummy, but a little dry. I did use extra lean ground chicken instead of turkey...maybe thats the reason it was dry...but not un-edible. My family did go back for seconds and had no clue that there was quinoa in it. I did sub the hot sauce for bbq sauce as others did and I also added a diced green pepper for a little extra veg. Will make again, a great way to incorporate a very healthy grain. Thanks!

I've been looking for good ground turkey meatloaf recipe and this has been the best I've found so far.  I did take the advice of another member and used her ketchup, brown sugar, mustard topping, but other than that I will definitely make this again!

This meatloaf was awesome !! I added an extra egg, as some of the other reviews suggested. Also, I added BBQ sauce instead of Hot sauce. At first, I wasn't sure it would turn out... due to how soupy it seemed, but after it baked, it set fine and was wonderful  :)

I used quite a bit more than 1/4 cup of quinoa and ketchup instead of tomato paste.  Everyone loved it.  I served leftovers to a group of kids the next day and they just couldn't get enough.  I'm forwarding this recipe to one of their mom's because they went home asking their mom to make it.  It's a keeper.

I followed the recipe to a T and while the flavor was great, the loaf itself was dry (I used 93/7) and the topping was too liquidy - not a paste - so it ran off of the meatloaf. Next time, I might not cook it as long and I won't add water to the topping. Maybe I'll even add tomato paste to the topping to thicken it up.

This was delicious!  I loved the ideas of making it in muffin pans; I will also be trying meatballs with this recipes, too.  I did take a previous reviewer's suggestion to double the quinoa to make it stretch farther and, as with her experience, it worked out great (I added an add'l egg to help it bind).  Although, if you do this, be prepared that if you free-form it in a pan (with sides to catch run-off), it will take about twice the amount of time but it's worth it for leftovers and sandwiches.  I could not find ground turkey in my local stores so I substituted ground chicken (the butcher confirmed that it does have a mixture of white and dark meat) and it worked wonderfully!  My kids said it reminded them of chicken nuggets.  I added no salt but somehow this recipe still tasted too salty for our palates.  I will definitely be substituting low-sodium Worcestershire sauce next time.  Also, we skipped the hot pepper sauce, doubled the garlic, and added BBQ sauce to the tomato paste mixture for the glaze topping.  Thumbs-up!  Highly recommend.  Thanks, Drew :o)

YUM YUM YUM!!!  Excellent recipe!  I actually used 93/7 ground beef b/c it has fewer calories than ground turkey (by quite a bit).  I also added some of the tomato paste to the brown sugar topping.  Next time I will probably add a little more of this topping - I like the sweet/savory combination (sort of like a sloppy joe).  I will definitely make this again...thank you so much!!  A new recipe for my collection.  Everyone should try this!!

Loved it! I only had 1# of ground turkey but proceeded with the recipe as is. It turned out great. Loved the flavor and the texture. I did add some ketchup and mustard to the glaze/topping because I like it that way. Baked for 60 minutes and couldn't be happier about it. Will definitely make again.

Amazing amazing amazing. Followed the recipe exactly and it was by far the best meatloaf I've ever had -- and healthy to boot! Boyfriend flipped out and couldn't get enough. We ate it with barbeque sauce -- delish. 

Will absolutely be making this again...

To help with shaping the loaf, I lined a loaf pan with seran wrap, added a layer of turkey bacon, poured in the sauce, added meat mix and plopped the whole thing on a baking sheet.  Beautiful form with some nice extra flavor ... Like probably everyone else on this site, I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I customized it to my taste (It wasn't very spicy, by the way, when I used green Tabasco) and it was probably the best meatloaf I've ever eaten.

Absolutely fantastic - didn't change a thing. Made it on a cookie sheet rather than a loaf pan as suggested and it was perfect!
Tossing my ground beef recipe of the past 15 years for this healthier, yummier alternative.

This is a delicious and flavorful recipe that will now be a staple for me! Its so very healthy too! The Worcestershire sauce gives it a really nice flavor. I LOVE the brown sugar sauce that goes on top! I'm definitely using this recipe to make turkey quinoa meatballs next...yum!!!

Delicious! Didn't alter one thing and it turned out fabulously. Next time I will omit the chili sauce and instead use barbecue sauce, the kids thought it was a little too spicy.

Made this last night for dinner and it was absolutely delicious!  Asked my 2 adult sons if they would change it any, and the only suggestion was maybe chopped green pepper.  Otherwise leave it alone!!!

Very tasty!  Even my five and two year olds loved it..with ketchup on top.  Next time I make it, i will probably mix in some ketchup and a bit of tomato paste with the glaze.  I didn't have an egg, so I used 1/4 cup silken tofu and it turned out great!

like quiet a few other people, wasn't a fan of the topping but the loaf itself was surprisingly tasty! I might try a topping such as cranberry pepper jelly or something sweet but lite like that.

WOW ! WOW! WOW!  This meatloaf is incredible!  My husband won't eat any other meatloaf other than his moms and he said "Here we are five years of trying, and you finally made an amazing meatloaf!"  

I didn't have quinoa, so I did sub Panko breadcrumbs.  I think this helped keep it together some since some people thought it fell apart.  Mine didn't at all. 

I can't wait to eat this again tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!!!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!!!!

Yum!!  I added a box of frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed out, into the sauteed onions and continued cooking for a few more minutes.  This bulked up the recipe, added great flavor, and helped make it even more nutritious.  Next time, I may omit the glaze and add some chopped feta and dill (along with the spinach) into the meatloaf instead.

Delicious!  I took Drew's advice and used 2 eggs (which definitely helped hold it together because I used all white meat for the ground turkey).  I also used BBQ sauce instead of hot sauce since we don't like spicy food.

Very good. So healthy. I have several turkey meatloaf recipes. This is not the best, but is good, and a nice change. I always prefer the turkey to the beef meatloaves.  Thank you.

This was delicious.  The first time I made it, my husband ate half the loaf...this one's a keeper!  I made only a few changes.  I didn't have tomato paste, so I used 1/2 cup of petite diced tomatoes.  I also omitted the hot pepper sauce and added extra garlic.  Great recipe!

Great meatloaf and healthy too.  It is very moist and the quinoa gives it a nice texture.  I have made it twice and both times my husband and I loved it.
I did reduce the 1 T of hot pepper sauce to about 1/2 teaspoon of Chili Garlic Sauce and a few dashes of Tabasco. You can find the chili sauce in the Asian section of the store. Also, used just 1 T of brown sugar/splenda blend since we do a low sugar diet. The topping was still sweet and very tasty!
Excellent recipe!!

I will put a little less pepper in the sauce rub next time, the top was too peppery for my taste. Although other than that this recipe is exceptionally delicious! I will make definitely make it again.

The family loved this healthy meatloaf! Used Stonewall kitchen BBQ sauce instead of the hot sauce, and 2 eggs.  Cooked for closer to 60 mins but might have been ok at 50. This dish is going into my rotation!

Newly gluten free, I made this several weeks ago. I liked it a lot, but for my own taste, I would probably add more herbs or some kind of depth in flavour. Maybe chopped cilantro or parsley would give it a more exciting flavour. I liked the texture though. Will make again.

Lovely recipe - I had leftover quinoa that was roughly 1 1/4 cups cooked - so not sure about the proportions. Used Cayenne and Hot Pepper Flakes as I didn't have hot sauce. Nice flavour, and sweetness combination. I followed the suggestion of cooking on a baking sheet, and it was just right!

This was my first time making anything with ground turkey. So if this recipe makes it taste less bland, I'll take everyone's word for it. 

That said, this was a flavorful recipe and I'll definitely make it again.

YUM.  The recipe didn't peak my interest but I had to try it based on the reviews and because of the ground turkey and quinoa.  Made it exactly as is, with egg beaters and zappata hot sauce and free form on a baking sheet.  Love It as is but will definately experiment.  Siriracha? Spinach? Sweet peppers?  Thanks Drew!

This the first time I have rated a recipe on the site and I am not necessarily a ground turkey user but after all the reviews I had to try this and I am glad that I Idid.  I sauted the onions in butter instead of olive oil and forgot to rinse the quinoa but that doesn't matter when mixed in the loaf.  I am not a big eater and I swear I ate most of the loaf by myself.  I will double it next time.  Thanks Drew!!

Great turkey meatloaf recipe! I followed some advice from other reviews: added a green pepper, and I boiled my quinoa in chicken stock.  I also sauteed my onions, a few extra cloves of garlic, and green peppers in some olive oil, butter, and chicken stock.  I cut down on the wors. sauce.  It was amazing. Great recipe! Thanks

Incredibly good.  I had meatloaf for the first time a few days ago at a restaurant in town.  It was good in the middle, but had a large border of tough meat that wasn't fun to eat.  Not a problem, I just brought it home for my furry little girls.  I was concerned that this would also be a problem here...but what I got was very juicy meatloaf with no hard borders.  The texture was a bit different...it fell apart a little easier.  But this dish exceeded all my expectations, and I did not pay $10 for it.  This was the centerpiece in my thanksgiving dinner (only two of us here, no point in a proper bird), which was a success.  Thank you.

This was fantastic!!!!  Next time I would half the salt and I only used about a 1/4 tsp of pepper.  My 3 little boys ate this up and my husband was very impressed.  Thanks you for a great easy new family favorite.  I also added some tomato paste to the top.  It was the perfect texture, and smelled delicious!

Very reluctant to try this recipe but it was so fabulous!  Remember to rinse your Quinoa before putting it in the saucepan.  I have been experimenting with Quinoa for almost a year now and found that this is a very important step to ensure it cooks and tastes good.  For this first recipe attempt I used 48 ounces of ground turkey and used three eggs while only doubling (but with rounded spoonfuls) the other ingredients - except for the hot sauce.  Thanks for all the tips and this amazingly delicious recipe!

AMAZING!!! Was distracted while reading recipe...ended up putting tsp of pepper in the topping as well.  Added some heat but we loved the extra spice!  This will be our new meatloaf recipe!!

I'm always looking for healthy recipes that the whole family can enjoy ... and when I say family ... there are 7 of us (our kids range from 5-14yrs old).

This is a recipe that I have been wanting to try for awhile and finally gave it a go today and am soooo glad that we did. Needless to say the kids totally enjoyed it and the youngest ones even had seconds. It was a good thing that I doubled the recipe (this loaf was 1 of 2 that was prepared). Very few leftovers (probably enough for one large serving for myself).

Will definitely be making this again.  Based upon some other reviews, I did add an extra egg.  I also left out the hot sauce as I didn't want it to be too spicy for the kids.

Best Turkey Meatloaf ever. I used instead of hot sauce chopped canned chipotle pepper in adobe sauce. if you double the recipe go easy on the sugar. Doubling it will make it too sweet.

This was FANTASTIC! I have two boys who are kind of picky eaters and they LOVED this. My husband and I as well. The hot pepper sauce (I used Aardvark hot sauce) really adds zing and makes this stand out. I made the recipe exactly as written and the loaf turned out moist and flavorful. The brown sugar topping is a nice foil to the slight heat of the turkey, and the next time I make this I may just double the topping. Very yummy, very highly recommended! Thanks!

Delicious. Will now be one of my staple recipes. I am not a big hot sauce fan, so I substituted some buffalo wing sauce. I also used ketchup instead of tomato paste (never know what to do with the rest of the can in these situations). Since I only had 16 oz of turkey, I added bread crumbs to make up some of the difference. I free-formed it on aluminum foil as instructed, and it turned out perfect -- moist, held together, delicious. It really tastes just like beef meatloaf. Thank you for this winning recipe!

This was delicious!!!  My whole family loved it (even the picky ones) and asked me to put it on the regular rotation.  I only made a few changes:  I used chicken and ground it in my blender and I added some chopped mushrooms and yellow bell peppers.  We don't eat wheat so it was wonderful to be able to use the quinoa instead of bread crumbs, and it made it so moist and wonderful.  I also loved the kick that the hot pepper sauce gave it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We loved this! I followed it very closely, the only change was adding a teaspoon of dijon mustard. It was so flavorful. The bottle of BBQ sauce I put out for by BF went untouched. I will definitely make it again.

THIS IS FANTASTIC!!!  the quinoa makes all the difference. The texture is moist and yet the meatloaf falls apart.  We all had seconds and it was gone in a flash. Thanks for a great recipe.

Very yummy!  Definitely do the free formed loaf on a cookie sheet - it turns out perfect.  I think next time I'll take a tip from another reviewer and cook the quinoa in chicken broth.  I did add an extra egg and the mixture stayed together great. I may have made a mistake with the topping glaze/paste b/c it was fairly liquid and not paste like at all. However, the flavor was very very good and I will definitely make this again.  I would also double the recipe for more leftovers.

really good although a tiny bit bland. I added some carrots for a different texture and used a little less turkey then called for. Also added some BBQ sauce in addition to the called for topping.

I was not a big fan of this meatloaf served as-is.  I used ground turkey breast because it's what I had on hand, and I added some olive oil to account for the lost fat, but I must not have added enough because the meatloaf was quite dry.  I also did not care for the taste of the hot pepper sauce in the meatloaf.  

I am giving it three stars however, because of how good the transformed leftovers were!  The next night I crumbled the leftovers into a skillet with some water and cooked it for about 10 minutes, then used the meat as filling for tacos.  It was some of the best taco meat we've ever had!!

Awesome taste! Even my meat-loving husband gave this one a thumbs up. I didn't use the hot sauce due to tender palates - just increased the ketchup (instead of tomato paste) to 2 tablespoons. I also add more ketchup to the topping to be more traditional.

Can anyone tell me why you have to cook the onions and garlic ahead of time? I'd think that after nearly an hour in the oven, they would be well cooked. (When I put raw onion in beef hamburgers and fry them, they always cook just fine.) I just put them in raw (minced) and they cook just fine.

I cook the quinoa in beef broth instead of water - adds some beef flavor.

Thanks, Drew! This has become one of my "regulars" now - healthy and tasty! :)

This was *awesome*. I added a little extra hot sauce because I like the kick and served with sautéed vegetables. This was my first time trying quinoa and I could have eaten it all from the pan. 

I made mine in a loaf pan despite the recipe owner's suggestion because I didn't feel like touching the meat combo. It was a little crumbly, but I expected it and wasn't disappointed. 

Other changes - I left off the sweet topping for personal preferences and used 2 eggs. 

This was freaking delicious and I'll recommend to my friends!

LOVED IT!! Followed recipe almost exactly with the exception of adding one more egg and only using 1/2 tbsp of hot sauce. Baked it in a glass dish with a little olive oil on the bottom for approx 55 minutes and it turned out absolutely perfect. Had two helpings and had to stop myself. Will definitely make this healthy treasure again!

Yum! First time cooking with quinoa. I couldn't really taste it, but I liked knowing i was cooking with healthy ingredients. I was rushed for time, so I made meatballs and cooked for 18-20 min. The sauce was great. My 22 month and husband liked it - and they are hard to please!

My husband looked so disappointed when I told him we were having meatloaf, but we put aside our usual dislike and tried this; it was delicious. I added 1T BBQ sauce to both the meat mix and the glaze. It was also incredibly helpful to read that this shouldn't be put into a loaf pan, but free formed on a baking sheet.

This has become a staple in my house, I love it!  The spice really makes it for me, so I even add a tsp of chili paste as well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Not bad at all!  The taste was really good, it was a bit crumbley but I found out my wife used tomato sauce and not paste.  I'm guessing the paste would help out on that.  Don't get me wrong, it's not the best meatloaf ever, but not bad for a healthier alternative.

Thank you so much for this! I don't usually cook with ground turkey because I don't like the blandness. I love that this is a healthy AND superior tasting choice to regular meatloaf. I will be making this again for sure.

I have always disliked meatloaf...until I tasted this one.  I did add some panko bread crumbs, but only because I was four ounces short on turkey.  I can't wait to make this again.

dry, dry, dry!  i even added the extra egg some others had suggested.  maybe i didn't shape my loaf thick enough on the baking sheet?  my husband loved the flavor, but it was so dry we couldn't even really finish it.

This is the best recipe! My 3 year old daughter LOVES it. Changed it up a bit tho. While cooking the onion I added the Worcestershire sauce, little bit of ketchup (instead of the tomato paste) an a couple table spoons of chicken stock.  Bring it to boil and let it reduce for about a min.  When cool, add to the turkey and rest of the ingredients.

I tried this tonight, have never eaten quinoa before, and ground turkey is an acquired taste, but I absolutely loved this recipe.  Thanks!
Oh, I added jalapeno's to give it a kick!

This is a great recipe, easily adapted for the food plan I'm on.  Actually, the only real changes I made were to cut the salt in half and substitute no-sodium catsup for the tomato paste.  The only thing I would do differently next time would be to cut the Tabasco down to 2 tsp.  This was so tasty that my husband didn't realize it was turkey until I told him, and even though he's a great salt lover, didn't even notice that any was missing.  I would highly recommend this recipe to any meatloaf lover.  This is the first time I've tried turkey meatloaf and the recipe is a definite keeper!!!!!

This was excellent!  For the topping, I mixed about 1 Tbsp of tomato paste in with the brown sugar & worshestershire sauce and it was fab!  Instead of blobbing it on a baking sheet, I lined a loaf pan with foil and baked it in there for 1 hour.  yum.

We loved this recipe. Thanks for the smart idea about using quinoa. I think it could use a snip more heat--I'd put in cheyenne pepper next time or more hot sauce. Also I always double or quadruple the garlic. Nice meal. Husband was shocked it was turkey. Delicious.

I made this as listed except added approximately 1/3 cup chopped orange pepper.  I omitted the hot sauce for little kids, perhaps this would have given the extra oomph to make this  a 5 star.  Texture was good, a great way to incorporate quinoa, next time I might experiment with other flavours or spices.   This was a very good weeknight recipe, I would also like to try making this recipe as meatballs for pasta.  Thanks for sharing!

Ehhhh...I'm not a fan of ground turkey and even less a fan of meatloaf, but I gave this a shot.  It's OK.  My boyfriend loves meatloaf, so we'll see what he thinks when he tries it.

OK, updated after the BF ate some.  I added a star - he said it's very good, but we both felt it could use more onion and maybe some green peppers?  I don't know.  I'll make it again.  He put extra hot sauce on it.  Really couldn't even taste the tbsp that I'd put in the recipe.  Maybe a hotter hot sauce next time?  I used Frank's.

This is a great basic meatloaf recipe that can be adapted according to your tastes.  I used a combo of beef and turkey and topped with Store bought BBQ sauce.  Also was out of tomato paste so substituted ketchup.  Had never cooked with Quinoa before but this was really good!  My husband raved about it and though I have never been a fan of meatloaf sandwiches I thoroughly enjoyed the one I made for myself with this recipe.  Next time I will follow the recipe exactly for a different but still great flavor.

I substituted ketchup for tomato paste (didn't have any on hand) and added a tbsp of barbeque sauce per another recommendation. Definitely one of the best meatloaf recipes I've found. Everyone (including two small kids) thought it was great!

I make turkey meatlof all the time and love this idea. Rather than add Quinoa, I will try adding farro. Also a very nutty type of grain. I most likely will treak the seasoning a bit too-maybe adding ketchup instead of tomato past since I never seem to use up an opened can of partially used paste. Thanks for the inspiration-can't wait to try it tonight.

The family loves quinoa and I'm always looking for a different way to incoroprate it into a meal. This was the daily recipe I received from allrecipes.com and decided to give it a try. I doubled up the recipe and made two loafs. Darn happy I did. The family loved it and everybody had seconds. Awesome flavor unlike any other meatloaf I have ever tasted and moist too!

I froze the second loaf which will help to make for a quick meal in the not so distant future. I highly recommend this recipe!

I followed the recipe adding mushrooms and shreaded carrot. The flavours were there but it turned out a little dry. I will certainly make it again keeping a closer eye on the oven. I like the idea of cooking the quinoa in a low sodium chicken or vegetable stock!

Brilliant! Tastes like spicier version of traditional meatloaf. I doubled the recipe and used a ketchup sauce instead of the topping in the recipe. It fooled two very picky, meat eating, guys into eating a healthy dinner and they loved it.

Made it just as recipe called for and my entire family LOVED it!!  I was worried about the heat after reading some reviews but I found the heat to be perfect for even my children ranging in ages 10 months-9 years.  DELICIOUS!!  Adding to my "rotation".

I had never cooked anything with Quinoa in it. This Turkey meatloaf turned out really yummy.  I've been making meatloaf w/ turkey for a long time.  This has to be one of the top recipes I have ever used.  I did add about 1/4 cup ketchup to the topping w/ some extra brown sugar. My husband didn't even notice that I used Quinoa in place of crackers or bread. :o).  Much healthier!!

This was pretty good.  I've tried turkey loaf before and did not care for it.  I would only stick to beef.  But then I found this recipe and gave it another try.  Especially since I just started cooking with quinoa.  I was pleasantly surprised by how this turned out.  I added about 1/3 cup of shredded ched. chez (but won't add that again since i couldn't really taste it) and added an additional egg.  I also added bbq sauce to the sauce topping.  The quinoa helped with the texture to make it more meatloaf-y.  Instead of making it as a loaf, I made it into individual mounds and baked them for about a 1/2 hr.  My toddlers even liked these so I will definitely be making them again.

Great recipe! I modified it a little: adding some grated zucchini.I burnt the quinoa, so I was only able to use about half.  I baked them in a muffin tin (make a perfect dozen). Then I topped with mashed potatoes and bread crumbs.

This was great.  The only thing I changed was I used onion and garlic powder because I didn't have onion or garlic on hand and it turned out really good.  The Quinoa is a great touch!

I tried this because my kids love traditional meatloaf and I hated it.  It was incredible.  There was no leftovers unfortunately, and my kids now request this instead of the traditional.  The only thing I did different was that I didn't have any tomato paste so I used ketchup instead.

My husband raved about this recipe, even saying it might have been the best meal I've cooked! I was surprised how good it was since I'm not usually a meatloaf fan. I followed the recipe and didn't change anything. It turned out wonderful. Also, it's another good ground turkey option!

I was very surpised at how great this was. I would say it was addictive...texture, flavours, smell. I had never cooked with quinoa before, and it went so well with the ground turkey. I don't know if I could go back to beef meatloaf. For the topping I added a bit of ketchup to the brown sugar and worchestershire sauce, then I broiled it for about 5-10 mins at the end. It was amazingly flavourful and juicy. The whole pan went in 1 sitting between my boyfriend and I:D

Delicious! I ate mine plus my kids' portions too. They refused to eat it. I had to make a slight substitution because I found myself without an onion. I used about 3/4 of pico de gallo salsa instead. I also added the cup of shredded cheddar that others recommended. I loved it. Five stars plus!

I made this for some friends tonight and it was a big hit!  I've made this a few times now and it just gets better every time.  The only thing I would change is making extra sauce because it was soo good we couldn't get enough!  Thank you so much for posting this awesome recipe!!

I had my family over for this dish.  At first, my father was questioning why I was making meatloaf.  Halfway through the meal, everyone was very impressed with the meal.  My fiance ever took the leftovers for lunch.

Loved this! Took suggestions from a few others comments, used ketchup instead of tomato paste, sweet chili sauce instead of hot sauce, added some zuccini and cheese...so delish!

I didn't have quinoa so I substituted millet and read on a vegan cooking site that they substitute fine for each other in recipes. I followed the cooking directions for millet first.. dry-skillet toasting it to bring out flavor then boiling it with water to soften/cook it. But I have to say it made the meatloaf taste sort of like sawdust! That's not anyone's fault but mine, of course.. because the spices in the meatloaf were delicious with the turkey. I was still glad to try the recipe and maybe I'll try it again sometime as it's posted-- with quinoa. Definitely don't substitute!

Really moist and flavorful- such a clever solution to turkey meatloaf, which has always been a disappointment in the past.  This is very spicy though (and I like heat)- much too much for my son, so I just reduced to a sprinkle of hot sauce and was great.  I added more to my own portion at the dinner table.  I didn't have tomato paste, so used 2 Tbs ketchup and worked great.

Cooking for family, I followed the advice of others and did not add the hot pepper sauce. While making the loaf, I noticed that the Worcestershire had chili paste in it which was fine for the loaf but I thought was too spicy for the topping-paste; decided to toss that topping mixture and instead made a paste of equal parts ketchup and brown sugar.

Made this ahead on Thursday evening and served for dinner on Saturday. I put the meat in a bread loaf pan and sealed with saran wrap (pressed right on top of loaf and then up sides of pan so no air was in there.) Kept the top-paste separate in a pyrex dish to add right before baking. Stored in fridge.

Everyone ate it! Two picky boys 4+7, husband who usually can't stand meatloaf, my mom who doesn't eat read meat, my very health-conscious dad, and me. Served with grilled, seasoned, sliced potatoes and peas. Grown-ups all had more than one piece, and there were a few leftovers which were tasty too. Will make this again! Husband said I should triple the ketchup-brown sugar topping next time.

4 stars due to the alterations, 5 stars for the idea/inspiration!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever made!  My husband called it "delicate"...because of the texture.  I will definitely make this again.  My husband teases me that I never follow a recipe...and I tell him a recipe is a guideline....but I did follow this recipe to the letter and it was wonderful!  My daughter, who doesn't like meatloaf, has asked me to make it again.  This is definitely a keeper!

My family, especially my husband, really enjoyed this meatloaf. He said it was the best one I've made yet! Like others, I substituted ketchup for the tomato paste since I didn't have the paste on-hand. I was looking for a recipe that used ground turkey and I'm glad I decided to try this one. It was absolutely delicious!

I've wanted to try quinoa as Dr. Oz raves about it. This was pretty good - easy to make. I was lazy the day I made it so I just microwaved the onions/garlic. I will be trying quinoa as a breadcrumb replacement in other dishes like turkey burgers or salmon patties.

Great recipe!! Everyone raved about it, and they normally don't eat anything healthy. Mine came out a little too moist and falling apart, but that may be because I used tomato sauce instead of paste; next time I'll try using another egg as well.  Thanks for the healthy tasty recipe!

Well, I had been looking forward to making this recipe all week, so naturally by the time I got to the store, the quinoa bin was empty! I decided to try it with millet instead. Very tasty! I suppose you could substitute almost any small grain - but I do hope to try it with the quinoa soon!

I'm surprised that I didnt like this recipe after all the high ratings it got. I generally like ground turkey and quinoa separately but when they were cooked together i thought it created an odd texture, though the flavoring was good. I am giving it 2 stars, one start for good flavoring and another star for being healthy. I probably wont make it again.

My favorite meat loaf so far!  TRY THIS!!!!!  Quinoa is a power food, packed with protein and has a nutty taste.  I love recipes that include my favorite grain!

This meatloaf was FABULOUS. We're making it for the 2nd time tonight and can't wait to eat it. The last time we made it, we froze the left overs as individual portions for lunches for work and it reheated beautifully.

I substituted brown rice for quinoa, and 1/2 tablespoon for hot pepper sauce because I didn't have any. This was AWESOME. I loved it.

This was delicious.  I have tried a few turkey meatloaf recipes and have been disappointed in the texture, but this one is different.  I think the quinoa is the secret.  I will be using this recipe fro now on!

The family loved it!  Great flavor for a turkey loaf!  I followed the recipe exactly and my only complaint was that with the quinoa it tends to fall apart when cut but I loved the texture while eating it!!  Thanks for posting this great recipe!!

Fantastic!  I never follow a recipe to the letter but the only change I made to this was to add the rest of my can of tomato paste to the topping/glaze.  My husband is such a huge fan of this recipe that he requested it again for next week.  As I write this, I'm wishing we hadn't already eaten all the leftovers!

Update: I found a great technique for making this meatloaf.  I double the recipe and pat it into a cookie sheet (size dictates thickness of "slices"), spreading the glaze on top.  I bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes.  Then I can cut it into portions and freeze the leftovers.  Just wrap individual pieces in wax paper and pop them all in a freezer bag.  They reheat wonderfully in the microwave!  My hubby loves to take them for lunch and when I was on bedrest at the end of my pregnancy and then recovering from the c-section, having a freezer full of protein-packed meatloaf was a life saver!

Also, in recent batches, I've used garam masala for the seasoning and the rhubarb steak sauce from allrecipes.com in the glaze.  Incredible!

This was a huge hit at my house, even my toddler loved it. I made it in a loaf pan. I am sensitive to salt and will need to add less next time. Other than that, it was wonderful!

This is delicious!  While I was making it I thought "wow, this is really a weird combo" but then again I don't cook a lot, so what do I know??? LOL!!  I am happy to report it turned out to be delicious.

Very good meatloaf!  It was a tad bit spicy for me, so I will cut back on the hot sauce next time. I added about six crushed butter crackers the second time I made it to improve the texture of the meatloaf for our own personal preference.  I really liked the sauce for the top, too.  I think this is just as good, (if not better), as any beef meatloaf.  I would make this again.

Wonderful flavor! The only thing I was disappointed with was that the quinoa didn't cook completely in the top half of the loaf. It wasn't fully cooked after cooking til the water was gone, as the recipe stated, but I figured since it still had 50 minutes to cook that there was a reason. SO, my recommendation is to make sure the quinoa is fully cooked before adding to the turkey mixture. Then it would be PERFECT!

EXCELLENT!  I am one of those people who sometimes gets creeped out by ground turkey, but this dish was absolutely delicious!  I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth and added ketchup instead of tomato paste.  i also added 1/8 cup ketchup and 1/8 cup mustard to the "glaze" on top and baked it.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  6 weight watchers points if you cut it into 5 servings.  I am eating a leftover piece for lunch right now.....

This Meatloaf is absolutely delicious.  My 3 and 4 year old loved it and even my super picky husband had two servings!  Really great for someone trying to avoid a meatloaf with breadcrumbs.  This had such a nice texture - much lighter than a traditional loaf.   Will definitely double the recipe next time.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

This was spectacular!!  I had to modify the ingredients  slightly, I used ketchup instead of tomato paste.  My 16 year old daughter said this was the best meatloaf she has ever had, and my husband asked me to make it again the next night.  This is definately a keeper!

I thought this tasted delicious.  I really liked the consistency of the quinoa, and the added nutritional benefits.  I added some tomato paste to the glaze, used lean ground turkey, and sauteed some bell peppers with the onion.

Had no quinoa, so used burgol instead.  Had no tomato paste, so used tomato sauce instead.  Had no brown sugar; so used white instead. Had no hot pepper sauce so used Hot Chili sauce instead.  And it came out very tasty.  It didn't keep a shape so I poured it into an English cake pan lined with baking paper.  It came out perfect and very very good.  I would give it 5 stars, but after all...it's only meatloaf!

This recipe is a BIG hit with my guys!  I made only small changes:  included a chopped red bell pepper and omitted the hot sauce (just passed at table).  We will be making this really often at our house.  We may experiment with substituting brown rice for the quinoa sometimes.  Thank you very much for this wonderful recipe, Drew!

Loved this recipe.  Very easy.  Only real modification I did was use Cous Cous instead of quinoa and chicken stock instead of water.  Would make it again. Update 12/09/11 -  made it with quinoa. Still awesome. Added some ketchup to the turkey mix and a little mustard to the spread. This recipe kicks .

After reading other reviews, I made the following adjustments. I omitted the worcestershire sauce and used LS Soysauce (only 1 Tbsp).  I reduced the hot pepper sauce to 1/2tsp, omitted the salt, reduced black pepper to 1/2tsp, used egg substitute in place of egg, used cooking spray instead of oil, omitted the brown sugar.  The additions I made were to add panko bread crumbs, dried oregano, dried basil and homemade tomato sauce on the top.  I used a loaf pan which I'd highly recommend to keep its shape.  I love the flavor of the a quinoa.  This was excellent.  My husband loved it.  I will make this again.

I liked it fine (a bit spicy for my taste, but not too bad), but hubby is disappointed in anything that doesn't taste like the beef meatloaf he grew up with and that I always used to fix. He also disliked the spiciness.  Guess I should have toned it down a bit for the first time out.  Probably won't make this again.  Think I'll try crumbling up the leftovers and using it in marinara sauce for pasta.

Very good.  an extra egg is a good idea.  It's a lot softer than other meatloafs I make, but it tastes great, has a nice texture, and is very healthy.

I was unimpressed with this recipe. The loaf came out too dry. The taste was good though. Perhaps the next time, I will add less quinoa (I am unsure). My 5-year old daughter did not like it & I did not either. I will try it again because I appreciate health recipes. I will just ‘tweak’ it a little.

I found this meatloaf to be really dry.  There are much recipes out there.

Love, love, love this!!!  It was a bit tangy and I may cut the hot sauce back a tad next time, but overall it was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used Whey-Low Gold sugar substitute in place of the brown sugar for the topping.  I will be making this for many years to come!

This was delicious. I do not like regular beef meatloaf and my hubby has recently started a gluten-free diet but loves meatloaf so this seemed like the perfect recipe to try. Cooked up in a loaf pan, moist and yummy. Made the quinoa with chicken broth for a little extra flavor. Served with green beans and mashed taters. Heats up nicely. I did use the hot sauce sparingly since the kids were eating it, but next time will probably add what is recommended. I also did not add the topping, cutting back on sugar.

This was a FABULOUS dish- my entire family loved it! I added diced carrots to the sauteed onions and exchanged Worcestershire sauce for BBQ sauce- it was awesome!! My grandma even asked me to give her a copy of the recipe!

Enjoyed this healthy meatloaf very much, but I think I'll try it again with a bit of chili sauce to add a bit more flavour.  The only change I made to it was adding a small diced zucchini (just because I had one in the fridge and thought I should use it up) and cooking it in a loaf pan instead of free-forming it.  Thanks for a good quinoa recipe.

I, too, am looking for more ways to use quinoa and this recipe is awesome.  I used ground beef instead of turkey because we eat locally and ground turkey is difficult to aquire from our local farmers.  I also accidentally added the "topping" ingredients into the loaf itself but it was still fabulous.  Leftover it was just as good!  I'm thinking about making it again tonight.

This tasted okay. Guess I'm used to beef, but it wasn't bad for a healthier option, just a little bland for my taste I guess. Definitely could use several seasonings.

Really tasty!  Omitted salt and added some Panko bread crumbs.  Baked in a 9x5 loaf pan.  Let it sit approx 5-7 minutes before slicing.  A great way to add Quinoa into your diet.  Will make again.  Served with homemade mashed potatoes and fresh corn.  Perfect comfort food!

I made this as called for except the paste for the top, (was in a hurry)  FABULOUS!  We love quinoa, so good for you! It's a great addition to an otherwise traditional meatloaf.

Great meatloaf...loved the incorporation of quinoa, which I adore!  I wasn't overly fond of the 'sauce' on the top, so next time I would leave off.  I just don't think it added much to the recipe.  The hot pepper sauce gave it some nice spice (I used Frank's Red Hot)...a definite repeat, thanks.

This was delicious. I did not use hot sauce because I didn't have any on hand. I used ketchup on top instead of making the glaze.

Very good! I didn't use the topping suggested in the recipe, I used Heinz 57 sauce instead, and it was great! Even my roommate that's not even into healthy food liked it (he ate half a pan lol). Makes very good leftovers, and is perfect for meatloaf sandwiches to take to work.

The flavors are great, but mine was a little crumbly, so it didn't hold together well. I also added one chopped zucchini to have some vegetables in the meatloaf, great addition. Thanks for the recipe!

I was too lazy to go get turkey at the store, so I just used the ground beef we had in the freezer (I know, I know, not as healthy). This dish was very flavorful. The spices were enough to add some kick, but not too much. I chose to cook this recipe, hoping it would give be a better opinion of meatloaf, and it worked! The glaze for the top was a great touch, too.

This was very good! I used a little more than a table spoon of hot sauce but I didn't really taste it. I used carrot, onion and a few mushrooms, processed in the food processor and then sauteed in some evoo and salt and pepper and then tossed in a diced zucchini. And then I just mixed together all of the ingredients and let it stay in the fridge overnight. My husband baked it when he got home from work and it was ready for when I got home!! Very good!

I cooked my quinoa ahead of time. I thought this was tasty.   To the reviewer who was whining about quinoa being expensive & implying the poster shouldn't have posted it,  I will say 2 things. 1. Don't make it then & move on and 2. You can buy small amounts in the bulk section. That's what I did

This was delicious!!! Tender and moist with great texture from the quinoa. I used thai chili paste instead of hot sauce and red quinoa. Added a small bit of ketchup over the glaze. Husband did not know it was turkey or quinoa. Makes great sanwiches, too.

I made this recipe thinking it would be excellent like many of the other ratings. It was good, but not excellent. The meatloaf by itself has an odd taste to it. The quinoa does give it a good texture compared to standard turkey meatloaf, but it doesn't help with the flavor. I will not be making this recipe again. I added cheddar cheese on the top toward the end of baking and this helps quite a bit, as well as ketchup.

This is an awesome, tasty meatloaf!  My husband doesn't even like meat loaf and he loved it.  I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out just perfect.  The glaze on the top, I think, really adds much of the flavour.  It's going in my favs!!

This was so good. I didn't want to waste all my tomato paste, so I added 1 tbs to the topping mixture.  I also covered it with shredded cheddar in the last 10 mins.  So yummy!

This was really good, but a little dry. I guess that's to be expected when cooking with lean turkey, but it was so moist before I baked it that I hoped it would retain the moisture during baking. I would make it again, but I think I'll make a honey barbeque glaze instead of the brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce.

I thought this was really delicious. Next time I will cut the hot sauce in half, and maybe use chipotle tabasco. The flavor and texture of this meatloaf were excellent!

I made this exactly as it's written, and it was perfect.  I had read other reviews and they had mentioned that 1tbsp of hot sauce was too much, but I thought it was perfect, just the right amount of kick.

Good!  I added a sweetpepper for bulk.  This recipe was reletively small, so next time I'll double it.  This would be a good entre for 4 people.

very good, better the next day when the quinoa had a chance to lend even more structure to the loaf.  Loads of good flavor.  Thanks for this recipe, I would never have thought of using quinoa!

This was excellent.  A bit salty, I will cut it back toa 1/2 teaspoon next time.  Also, I made the mistake of putting the worsteshire sauce and tomato paste into the mixture and omitted the brown sugar.  It was still delicious.  It crumbles a bit, so I will take the advice of another reviewer and add an extra egg next time to hold it together better.

I made this for guests and they raved over it.  I never shared the fact that it was made with quinoa and turkey. I've found sometimes it's best not to share ingredients.  I made turkey meatloaf for a church dinner once and one man wouldn't even taste it because it wasn't made with beef.

My husband & I were pleasantly surprised by how good this was. He was surprised it was turkey but he is not a picky eater. I was out of quinoa so I went to Trader Joe's to get some. Most grocery stores don't have it and the health food store is very expensive. I was glad I did. I used only 1 tsp sea salt and didn't use brown sugar for the topping. We don't care for sweet toppings for anything. I just used a little tomato paste, worcestershire sauce & water and spread on top with a pastry brush. Will definitely make this again.

One of the few recipes that I actually didn't change a thing.  Made as written and it was amazing.  I even shaped mine like the picture (as a heart).  My kids actually went back for seconds (which is a rarity).  Thank you Drew for posting!

This was so close to a 5 star recipe.  Although it was very tasty, it seemed to be missing something.  Next time I think I'll add BBQ sauce like some of the others have mentioned.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe that my whole family enjoyed.

First time using Quinoa...interesting.  Used chicken broth instead of water to cook it.  Took the advice of others and used BBQ instead of hot sauce.  Next time I'll add extra BBQ.  My picky 4 and 2 year olds actually ate this!  Cooking the onions first really gave a good flavor.  I was rushing to get it in the oven and used dried, minced garlic.  I also just sprinkled the brown sugar, then the Worchestire sauce on top instead of mixing first.  Came out great!!  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

Fantastic!  The addition of quinoa is perfect to bump up the nutritional value of meatloaf.  I've been doing turkey meatloaf with bbq sauce for some time; I subbed bbq for the hot sauce in this recipe to keep it palatable for my kids.  This is a keeper, thanks for sharing!

Very moist and yummy.  I used 2 lbs. of turkey and doubled the quinoa.  Added a little ketchup to the topping mixture.  So glad to have a beef alternative for meatloaf now!

WOW this is a great recipe.  I wish I could give it 10 stars! We have never really liked the taste of ground turkey before but thought I would give it a try.  This dish taste like Beef! My husband said it was actually better than my old beef meatloaf recipe that he had raved about for 25 years.  I added a tablespoon of Tomato Paste to the topping as some others did.  I'm going to use the recipe for Super bowl Sunday and see if we can't grill turkey burgers using these ingredients.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

Very tasty!  I halved the pepper and hot sauce to keep it less spicy for the kids, though, I did double the garlic.  I added a cup of chopped fresh spinach and half a cup of shredded carrot to sneak in some veggies. I also doubled the quinoa as I made too much. It was a hit with everyone and we'll definitely be making it again soon.

I used real bread crumbs with 1/2 cup of milk, with this only because I didn't have any quinoa. I also used garlic powder because I didn't have whole garlic. BUt My kids and my DH loved it, especially the sauce. I will be saving it and trying it with the quinoa. Lots of good flavor.

This meatloaf was kinda bland.  The quinoa was cooked in chicken broth to add flavor.  I left off the sweet paste because I don't like sweet food....it was moist however ...

Really good!  Added 1 extra egg and shook in some panko to help as it was a little loose.  Shook in some cheddar cheese but probably doesn't need it, couldn't notice it.  I subbed sweet chili sauce for the hot sauce, and subbed ketchup for the tomato paste (rather than open a can for this little amt.).  
For the topping I did 1/4 C. br. sugar, 1/4 C. ketchup, 1 T. mustard and added some worcestershire.) 
I put it on a PAM sprayed, foil lined sheet (used one that had sides).  Formed it into a rectangle.

Looking for healthier dinner options that are dairy and gluten free and this was AMAZING!!! After eating so many salads this was just the healthy comfort food I needed!! We paired it with sweet potatoes and French green beans....DELICIOUS!

First I confess to changing the recipe  little. I doubled the batch but mixed turkey and ground beef. I also added mushrooms. I didn't have tomato paste so I used catsup. I loved it, but, with the recipe as-is, we found it too salty. I would cut back on the Worcestershire a little as well as the salt. Still, it had a wonderful taste. I shaped it on a cookie sheet as suggested.

The only thing I changed was that I had some leftover spaghetti sauce and I used that instead of the tomato paste. Was really good! Would definitely make it again!

Turned out great!   Reduced hot sauce to 1 tsp.   Used veggie bullion in the quinoa cooking process.  Added yellow peppers.  Made (2) 1-lb loaves from all dark meat that I cooked on a raised rack with perforated parchment paper.  To do this, I put parchment paper on a cooking rack and used a fork to poke drain holes.  Placed rack on a pan and put loaves on top of the paper.  Great texture and flavor!

It's a decent meatloaf. Not my favorite, but satisfactory. But your bro was just being polite. NO ONE with taste buds is going to confuse this with beef and there is no need to try and sell it. It's like keto people trying to claim cauliflower mashed potatoes taste just like real mashed potatoes. You're only trying to convince yourself.

I've made this twice now and both times my family devoured it. The first time I baked it in my oven, the second time I baked it in my Big Green Egg. Let me tell ya folks, either way is good, but cooked out on that grill took it over the top.  One other thing...the first time I made it , it was per the recipe. The next time I cut the hot sauce in half, as it was too much.  I also sauteed green bell pepper and added it to the mixture. Will be making this again before too long.

So so bland. This should be called Sweet Worcestershire Loaf. I should've known from the lack of flavorful ingredients that this wouldn't work, but we had everything on hand so we gave it a shot. None of the family liked this at all.

I was reluctant to make Turkey meatloaf due to the stories that I'd heard.  Girlfriend can't eat beef and loves quinoa, so this recipe seemed appropriate. 
Thanks, Andrew Benoit for putting together an amazing and healthy Turkey meatloaf. 
I used 99% fat free ground Turkey and added a second egg to help bind the ingredients. 

I used a Rachel Ray meatloaf pan which has allows juices to drip through, which deals with any exces moisture. 

I'll make this again and add salsa to the mix and on top of the loaf.

My loaf moist and tender, not dry at all. I didn’t use the pepper sauce, since I wanted my kids to eat it, that was a good call, even without it was a little on the peppery side. Other than that, it was great!

This was delicious and a great alternative for those who want an alternative to beef. I did find it a little salty but that may just be me. This was even better the next day after it firmed up. My husband didnt even notice the quinoa!

This was DELICIOUS!!!  The only thing I changed due to my 4 yr old daughter not liking spice was using bbq sauce instead of hot sauce.  I still put a dash of hot sauce tho, but not much.  This was very moist (make sure to put on baking sheet in loaf form vs pan) and absolutely amazing!!  I will be making this again!!

I’m sorry I haven’t left a review much earlier but this has become my go to and I absolutely love this recipe! I love the texture, look and flavor the quinoa gives. I follow the recipe exactly other than an addition of chicken broth when I cook my quinoa because I will usually make a bigger batch of the quinoa for other dinners, salads etc. for the week. To me, this is super clean healthy eating and also comforting at the same time, win win! I’ve started to make it about once a month and it’s become a classic for my family. Thank you!!!

Found this recipe when I was fishing for something interesting to do with ground turkey, and am I glad I did! The nuttiness of the quinoa and the bite of the hot sauce brought the turkey to life.

I ended up using 30 ounces of ground meat, half of which, I think, was ground chicken. I also used two eggs and 1.5x the quantity of just about everything else. The quinoa makes a surprinsingly good filler and the loaf did indeed hold together well. You bet I'll make this again!

Was very pleased with how well it turned out.  Very flavorful.  I cubed the leftovers, topped with a grape tomato and served on a cracker.  Used BBQ sauce.  Very good.  As they say it was good to the last drop.  Everyone at our BBQ enjoyed it,  Was a great appetizer.

I wanted to like this. I truly did. I can't eat wheat so I couldn't add Worcestershire sauce. I also added some chopped zucchini to add vegetables. But I honestly thought it wasn't that good. I've been on a bit of a quinoa kick and thought I'd try this...just the flavours tasted a bit strange.

This was ridiculously good!  I've been using All Recipes for years but have rarely commented.  I felt I had to this time.  I totally did not miss the taste of traditional meatloaf.  The texture was perfect.  I was short on time so, I didn't measure anything but the seasoning.  I reduced sodium to 1 tsp since there was worchestire in the recipe and I try to watch sodium.  I used a little extra garlic, a medium onion and one extra egg since I didn't have ground turkey thigh and breast can be dry.  Also, I cooked in two loaves to expedite cook time.  Finally, since I'm not a big fan of tomato based sauce on meatloaf, I didn't add a sauce.

This was really good. I will try and rate the recipe as written although I omitted a few items because we are limiting our salt and sugar intake. I used 99 % lean ground white meat turkey.  It was kind of genius to use the quinoa as the binding agent. I also used two eggs.  Although I do not care to wash extra pans, cooking the onion and garlic before adding to the loaf is a good idea. Nothing worse than undercooked onions. The loaf texture was ok; it held together but was not too dense. Cooking time was spot on. I omitted the topping but put beefsteak tomatoes on top instead.   This was a pretty good recipe.

No one in my family had had a turkey loaf before so I decided to give this a try. It was a first time for quinoa as well but over all we really enjoyed it! We thought it maybe just a little bland so next try I might add some spice!

I'm new to quinoa but thought I'd give this a try since it has ground turkey and had great reviews.  Following others who cut back on the hot sauce, and we really liked this a lot.  I will be making this over and over again; thank you for sharing your recipe

My 2 and 4 year old ate it!  I don’t care about anything but that :)  Although I tasted it too and it was pretty darn good. I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Next time I will add a second egg, mince the onion instead of chopping, and reduce the cooking time by 10 minutes.

A great healthy meatloaf recipe to get all the good nutritions from quinoa. I modify the recipe.....I cook the quinoa with chicken broth, onion powder and garlic powder for extra flavor. Also, I use the tomato paste on the top instead of mixing into the turkey to avoid the dryness from baking. I try to avoid refined sugar in my diet, so skip brown sugar and Worcestershire for my meatloaf, still taste great!!

This was pretty good! I like my meatloaf a little saucy so next time I would make a topping for it. Other than that I liked it and my husband did too. I doubled the recipe so we have leftovers and I’m glad I did! I made it with rice cuz I didn’t have quinoa.

I used BBQ sauce instead of hot sauce, as one reviewer suggested.   The meatloaf was good and interesting tasting.  I used a 16 oz package of turkey and 1 teaspoon salt and a little less worchestershire.   One egg was sufficient to bind the ingredients together.

Made it this evening and my husband adored it. He said it was not at all dry. I made a few changes as the majority of the reviewers have advised: added another egg for binding, and for the topping I didn’t have brown sugar on hand so I used regular white sugar, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and honey mustard. Also, my package of turkey only came with 16 oz instead of the 20 oz asked for in the recipe.

Excellent! Super moist, but it holds together beautifully. I didn't have any worcestershire sauce and I substituted Dale's Steak Seasoning. It made it way too peppery for my own taste, but the glaze was perfectly sweet and helped some. I'll definitely make this again as directed!

I tried. I really tried. Followed your directions with only one addition. Added ketchup to make the topping a bit tangy.  That’s it. Well, although I was very happy that the loaf did not fall apart, my hubby and I looked at each other after the first bite.  We were politely quiet.  It was practically tasteless. No flavor. It was as if the meat absorbed all of the seasoning!  ln spite of the onion, garlic and seasonings, nothing! I saved the turkey meatloaf and crumbled it into a spaghetti sauce with diced tomatoes. THAT, turned out well - made a great meat sauce!  I am hanging up the quest for turkey meat loaf.

I eliminated the hot sauce..too much sodium. Figured the person eating could sprinkle on hot sauce it they wanted it.
I doubled the recipe and made two loaves.  I added 1/4 piece of a large, chopped red pepper and a handful of sliced, chopped carrots. I sliced it with a potato peeler.  Also, used chopped red onions.  
The meatloaf came out very tasty and surprisingly moist, even though I forgot to make gravy. I like gravy on my meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Everyone in the family enjoyed.

I have made this many times as it is a definite favorite in our home.   As far as ingredients go, we do not deviate from the recipe one bit.  We do, however, bake it in a two-piece loaf pan we bought at Meijer that actually drops all of the grease under the pan and collects it away from the loaf.  It is PERFECT for this recipe.  Highly recommend you get one. (Or two, like we did because we double this recipe EVERY time......Sam's Club sells their ground turkey in 2.5 pound packages!)

Delicious - only change was to use low sodium vegetable broth instead of water, and I  used a flat pan as suggested instead of loaf.

Loved this dish.  I used ketchup in place of the tomato paste as I was not wanting to open a can for 1 tablespoon. I also cut  the  brown sugar  in half because of the sugars in the ketchup  Otherwise I did the recipe as written.  I used sriracha for the hot pepper sauce  and it gave it a nice subtle heat.  This was also excellent the next day.   This will be used in place of my tasty regular meatloaf from here forward.

I put in 2 eggs, as it was kind of crumbly, but it became firmer, and tastier after it was in the fridge for awhile.  Even my husband, Mr. Gluten/Soy/Dairy/Corn-Free loved it!

I'm on Weight Watchers and calculated this to be a good low-point entree, and it was delicious!  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used 2 eggs instead of one, and I cooked my quinoa in 1/2 c. fat-free chicken broth instead of water for more flavor.  I also omitted the hot sauce because I knew my kids wouldn't eat it.  This recipe is going into regular dinner rotation in my house!

I didn't have hot pepper sauce substituted 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and didn't have tomato paste so had to use 2 tbsp. ketchup which is usually a poor substitute but in my other meatloaf I always used ketchup. It was great I really enjoy the taste of quinoa in the meatloaf and healthier too.

I followed Andrew's advice and it came out perfect! (only one drop of hot sauce.) I used another's suggestion for the topping: 1/4 c. tomato paste, 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1 tbsp Dijon mustard and 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce. Update: Also, since turkey here only comes in 1 lb packages, I used 2lbs this time, doubled the topping, worchestershire sauce, tomato paste, and added a second egg and it turned out great. No hot sauce either.

I make this a couple of times a month. My husband and I love it. I usually pair it with Garlic Parm faux mashed potatoes (cauliflower) and green beans. We fight over who gets the leftovers the next day.

This turned out awesome! Only 2 minor changes...added more garlic (I always add more garlic, lol), and used ketchup instead of water in the topping. This is another keeper!

I loved this! Full disclosure, I don't use worcestershire sauce due to food sensitivities however, I used equal parts of honey and apple cider vinegar in the recommended measurements to get that sort of flavor. I also used coconut sugar in place of the brown sugar, and cut the hot sauce down to 2 tsp. Mine was a bit crumbly so I may try another egg next time if I have company and need it to be perfect. I will be putting this on the regular rotation. It paired nicely with carrot salad.

I was so excited to cook this recipe for my friend and I, who always cooks me food. Thank God my excitement didn't go to waste, this was delicious! I usually dip mine in ranch or ketchup, but this was amazing just alone. It's juicy and savory, cooked perfectly with every flavor jumping at you!

Hard to review.   This dish was flavorful and tasty but not what I'm looking for when I think meatloaf.  I enjoyed it but it tries to pretend to be something else.  That doesn't mean its not worth it. Give it a try!  Enjoy it for what it is!

I love this recipe! It always turns out so moist and people are surprised it's turkey. I have changed the recipe based on the items I have on hand. I use a quinoa and brown rice mixture along with my own homemade ketchup. Since turkey cooks off a lot of moisture, I find I have to drain the liquid immediately after cooking so it doesn't make the bottom of the loaf soggy. I use a low rim flat  pan which seems to work well for this dish.

Made this last night with 1 lb. ground turkey so I just reduced the other ingredients a bit.  I forgot to sautee the onion and just mixed everything else as directed. So delicious!  the leftovers made great sandwiches with apple smoked cheddar cheese.  Putting this one in my file!

Love this recipe! It's great to make on a Sunday and have the leftovers for lunch throughout the week. I reduce the hot sauce just a tad when I want it a little less hot. I suppose it depends on your hot sauce of choice too.

This turned out to be way easier than I thought it would be. It looked gross before it was cooked (I used multi-color quinoa and it looked weird). But this tasted great! My family loved it and they are picky, usually unhealthy eaters. I used Sriracha for the hot sauce and it gave it a perfect little kick! I'm definitely making this one again!

This is a great recipe, but a bit salty for me. So I only use 1tsp of salt, and no sugar. I also skip hot sauce for my son's sake.

I followed the recipe without making any changes and it was amazing!  I am not a fan of ground turkey in general but trying to eat more of it for health reasons.  This recipe was so good that I might even prefer it to beef meatloaf, which is saying a lot!  This is now my go-to ground turkey dish!  Thanks!  The only thing I might change the next time is using only about half the sugar for the glaze.  If you like a sweet glaze, you'll love this but I prefer it to be more savory.  Even the kids loved it!

This was really good! Made as directed...no changes other than using dried onion because I was completely out. The best turkey meatloaf I've ever had for sure! The texture was definitely more like burger than turkey, and the taste was great. Will definitely be making this again, and again.

I made this for the first time last night.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I doubled it making 2 loafs.  It turned out delicious and I love that I can get rid of breadcrumbs entirely now!  Served it to my family with mashed potatoes and sauteed greenbeans and they gobbled it up.  I just had some leftovers for lunch and it was still just as good as I thought last night.  Yum!

Used 16 oz turkey and didn't reduce salt (also used catsup since didn't have paste); definitely too salty tho that would've been my fault. It was an ok recipe-- I guess I'm not the biggest quinoa person.

I use quinoa for meatballs as well, so this recipe caught my attention. Meatloaf is one of those fun meals in that it's very forgiving to alteration. I followed pretty close, but did use a few less ounces of turkey and added bell peppers and fresh basil. 

I also opted to bake in a loaf pan and didn't have issues with sogginess. Once baked, I removed from the pan and collected the drippings to drizzle over the sliced meatloaf for added effect.

Just as the contributor intended, the quinoa is a great replacement for the traditional breadcrumbs and adds great texture and flavor retention to  the dish. It's a double benefit for added protein, fewer simple carbs, and puts meatloaf back on the menu for my gluten intolerant wife.

Absolutely loved it! Followed recipe almost totally, but adjusted to our taste. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will not make the topping  as sweet! Highly recommend this!!

Made a few changes and it was the best meat loaf I've had.  I made the quinoa in chicken broth, used a sweet BBQ sauce instead of the hot sauce, and covered the top in ketchup.  The sauce that is supposed to go on top I mixed all of those ingredients just into the main bowl with everything else and didn't use as a topping.  Also I used two eggs because they were farm fresh eggs so on the smaller side.  I cooked it on parchment paper on a pan with 1/2" sides.  Paired it with steamed broccoli.

I LOVED this recipe!! I had 1 lb (16 oz) of ground turkey instead of 20 oz, so I changed the quantity of servings to 4 instead of 5 and set a timer for 35 minutes. I checked the temperature before leaving it in any longer and it was fully cooked and still moist at 35 mins. Definitely going to save this in the books. Thanks for sharing!

It was BOMB-DIGGITY! I would definitely make it again. The only thing I added was a little habanero sauce for that extra kick.

Loved this recipe, great flavor and texture!  I made it as written but used 2- 16 ounce packs of ground turkey so adjusted all ingredients accordingly.   By dong this I was able to make 2 nice sized loafs.  I can see the potential of using the base ingredients but changing up the spices for a totally different taste- so many possibilities.  This is a keeper, thanks!

I wasn't at all sure about using the quinoa instead of breadcrumbs. Quinoa looks like swollen grits to me - but this turned out great.  A lot of flavor with just a little kick of heat depending on how hot a hot  sauce you use.  Really like this one, and having made it once, it'll be an easier / smoother process than my first.  Thanks for this recipe. My prior efforts with ground turkey were just "okay"; this is really good!

Best meatloaf I've ever made! Even my daughter that hates turkey meatloaf went back for seconds. The texture was perfect. I have struggled with bread crumbs and flax since going gluten free.  The only thing I added was some sun dried tomatoes.

Made it for the first time last night. It was delicious and one I'll definitely make again. Only problem I had was with the topping. The taste was great but didn't make a paste so it ran off when I put it on the loaf. Even so, this is a recipe I would highly recommend!

Pretty good! For extra nutrition, I added a shredded carrot, some shredded spinach as well finely diced red peppers sautéed along with the onion.  After mixing in the quinoa, egg, and spices (I added both garlic & onion powders, a bit of Lawrey's seasoned salt and parsley), I decided to throw in 1/8 c of panko and a small handful of parmesan cheese. I baked it in a 9" pie plate for 50 minutes, but would reduce that to 40-45 min next time, as it came out just a tiny bit drier than expected (although it could've been the addition of the panko as well).  I served it with some steamed sweet corn and it went over very well with both the husband and picky 9 year-old daughter. Overall, 4 stars and this recipe will be made again.

I modified it. Had ground pork, not turkey, so I used that instead. Used ketchup not tomato paste. Had a small zucchini, so I chopped it up and added it, plus a teaspoon of poultry seasoning. It was delicious!

Seriously, my families favorite meatloaf recipe! My kids ask for it at least once a week! I always double the recipe, since it's so good!
Changes I make:
Add a carrot with onion to sautee.
Cook quinoa in chicken stock.
Only maybe 1/4 to 1/2 the amount of hot sauce.

we are gluten free (not by choice!) and so was thrilled to find a recipe that did not use breadcrumbs. We can't have worcestershire sauce - so I substituted our favourite gluten free bbq sauce for the tomato paste + hot pepper sauce + worcestershire sauce, and the same for the topping
2 thumbs up from everyone in the family!

Used less hot sauce (must keep the wife happy!), 50% more quinoa and a half cup each of grated carrots and diced zucchini, which really added to the texture and taste.  Whole family agree it was one of the best meatloaves ever.  Will be making this often.

First turkey meatloaf I've ever loved.  Juicy, flavorful, and the quinoa gave it a great flavor.  I substituted bbq sauce for the tomato paste.  The second time around, I made turkey patties and froze them.  They were excellent as well.  Two thumbs up from the entire fam??

I usually don't like turkey, but seeing all the good review and tempted by the quinoa which I just bought a big bag at Costco and need t find way to use it, I decided to give it a try. It is very delicious and nutritious! I had only one pound of turkey (following the author's recommendation of using white and dark meat) used 2 eggs, instead of 1, a large onion, which makes it sweeter,  and only a little bit of sriracha because that's what I have and we don't like spicy. Finally, I use baby ray BBQ sauce to replace the hot sauce. I didn't top it with anything because I don't like sugar. I baked it in a pie dish for exactly 50 minutes. When it first came out of the oven, there is some gooey juice on top but was absorbed back into the meat loaf.  It's the tastiest turkey meatloaf I ever tasted, and it's much lighter than beef.

We love it but have to leave out the pepper or too "peppery" for the kids. The Worcestershire already gives it enough of a kick.

Too spicy for my taste, but my husband liked it.   I think I'd skip the hot sauce if I tried it again.

This was very good. Had a nice kick to it, and it was easy to make. I like the consistency the quinoa gave it! Nice and healthy way to eliminate the bread crumbs.

I made this a few weeks ago. This was very tasty, but the hot sauce is unnecessary. I was surprised that it held together because it seemed kind of moist, but the quinoa definitely helps. I'm making it again today without the heat.

I'm the Queen of Making Bad Meatloaf.  So, I followed this exactly and was so excited. But, it turned out too spicy, sweet and somewhat dry and was lacking some savory dimension.  The Quinoa really gave it a great texture. 

I notice a lot of reviews give it some sort of modification.  I will definitely use Quinoa in the next meatloaf I try to make.  But, thank you for posting it.

Thanks for an excellent recipe!  I substituted one diced chipotle pepper with a little of its sauce for the Worchestershire, hot sauce and tomato paste, and used smoked paprika instead of black pepper on the turkey.  Also used Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce on the top of the  turkey loaf, but would try the recipe's topping next time.

Delicious and nutritious. I followed the recipe exact except I only had a 16 oz packet of ground turkey and I added a little ketchup and Worcestershire to the top. This is the new meatloaf staple in our house. Looking forward to tonight's left overs.

Wow! this is my first rating because it was that good. I started learning how to cook from all recipes recently and i have to follow directions exactly! this was one of my first that i followed exactly but gained enough confidence from my family to try something different than stated which was a big deal for me. I added the 1 cup cheddar cheese as stated by a previous review and changed the water cooked with the quinoa  to chicken broth and wow! OMG! not sure if it would have been as good without but wow, this is so tasty! worth making!

This is very good. My extra picky husband even said it was good and that is a 10 from him. I read comments from some of the other reviewer and took some of the suggestions such as adding an extra egg, rosemary and less salt. I added dried parsley and only a couple of teaspoons of hot sauce. I didn't make the glaze because my husband likes catsup with meathloaf.

Used soy sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce in the meatloaf.  Used 1/2 cup salsa and 1 tablespoon brown sugar on top of meatloaf.  I was surprised how delicious it was.

Delicious!!! The fam bam loved it! I made it for friends too one night and they didnt even know that it was turkey until I told them. Has AMAZING flavor. Everyone goes back for seconds. It's now a go to for our house. My only tip is to use a good hot sauce, really gives a lot of flavor.

I've made this recipe a couple of times and am making it again tonight, by request from my birthday guy. He's asked for "spicy turkey meatloaf with sun-dried tomatoes," which means this recipe with the addition of chopped sun-dried tomatoes. :) That's the only change I've made to the recipe (and it's a permanent one, we love sun-dried tomatoes). Good recipe, thanks for posting it.

THE BEST recipe for turkey meatloaf I have ever found (and I have been looking for 10+ years)!  The only omission I made was the hot sauce because I don't like it.   The quinoa was not discernible as a flavor or texture but adds so much more nutrition than bread crumbs.  I baked this in a meatloaf pan with a perforated insert to let the drippings fall through.   The loaf was moist and tender but held together and sliced really well.   Thanks for a great recipe-this is the only turkey meatloaf I will ever make!

I made the recipe following the ingredients and instructions exactly as is. I used sriracha hot sauce as I wasn't sure what type of hot sauce to use. I also followed the tip of free-forming the loaf on a flat baking pan instead of putting it in a meatloaf pan and it came out beautifully. I have to say, this is delicious and has become one of my favorite entrees. I definitely will be making this again.

I've made this twice now - one exactly to recipe and second time adding green peppers and mushrooms (because they were about to not be good anymore).  Both times it came out great.  Definitely remember not to put in a loaf pan.

Will make this again as it was really good.  I didn' have the raw quinoa but had organic quinoa and brown rice in a bag that was already precooked together and added a cup instead of the quinoa.  I used Sweet Baby Ray Vidalia Onion barbeque sauce instead of the hot sauce.  Sauted onion, garlic and chopped mushrooms in butter.  Those were the only changes I made and will make it again.  The flavor gets better reheating.  My husband loved it as much as I did and will be making it again soon.

Great flavor! The only area of improvement i think is the topping,  it didn't create a paste as the instructions mentioned, even though flavorful.   We added barbecue sauce to the topping, yum.

I would make it again.  I can't complain about how well concocted it was in its entirety.  However, a personal touch I would invest thought in: Consider making the saucee for it either thicker, or just including it in the meatloaf mix itself.  the loaf was delicious when eating part of the outside, but then eating the inner part of the loaf it was just... meat and quinoa and spices.  not bad, but not spectacular.

My family loved this recipe!  I added an extra egg on the advice of reviewers, and made a couple of changes for our tastes, and according to what I had on hand.  I used a couple tablespoons chopped sun-dried tomatoes and some left-over  canned fire-roasted tomatoes (about 1/2 cup).  Onion powder replaced the onion, and BBQ sauce replaced the hot sauce and topping.  Delicious.  A family member is avoiding wheat, and the quinoa is a wonderful substitute for bread crumbs...light and tasty.

I try to cook relatively healthy and had this recipe sitting in my favorites for a long time. I finally decided to give it a try and holy cow! I was skeptical and so was my boyfriend but he said we definitely had to make it again. It was perfectly cooked and just really tasty. I made it as is with no alterations.

I tried this because I hate quinoa but love meatloaf. I know quinoa is healthy, so I wanted to try to figure out some way to be able to eat it. The only changes I made were to add 1 diced green pepper and a little extra hot sauce (both were per my husband's request). I loved those additions because it kept it from being boring. I actually really liked this meatloaf and will definitely make it again. I finally found a way to get some quinoa into my diet.

I am thoroughly impressed with this recipe. The only thing I added was half a chopped green bell pepper, used only a touch of sriracha sauce instead of the recommended amount and I omitted the glaze. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out to be fantastic! A bit more work than a traditional meatloaf, but so worth it.

I thought this recipe was definitely good but not delicious.  I think I would double the amount of tomato paste - purely to add flavour.  I would make it again.

IMPORTANT DETAIL: This does not get cooked in a loaf pan! Read the author's post-script about how turkey has a lot of liquid and it ends up all "fall-aparty" if you don't cook it on a baking sheet. If I had paid attention to that detail, I would have gone a step further and elevated it off the bottom of the baking pan. 
THAT BEING SAID: This may have been the first meatloaf I've made without a seasoning packet and it was wonderful despite the fall-aparty-ness. The flavor was perfect.

I used chicken instead. Absolutelly delicious. The  Worcestershire+sugar+water on the top is the secret. Use a little more, so it penetrates the sides. You will love it.

I used 2 lbs of turkey, increased quinoa to 1/3 cup & water to 2/3 cup. My family doesn't like sweet on their meat, so I left off the glaze with brown sugar. They loved it!

Not a big quinoa fan but...  this was great!  It gave texture and moisture to the meatloaf.  I didn't do the hot sauce but I bumped up the other spices just a touch.

Fantastic! Added the extra egg, cut back on the hot sauce (for my wife and kids) and made a sauce/rub to go on top that was made of Dijon mustard and worchestersire.

I rarely post reviews but this recipe was so good I just had to give it give stars!  The quinoa gives the meatloaf such a great texture and the flavor is wonderful.  Like some other reviewers, I substituted barbecue sauce (brown sugar) for the hot sauce and used a brown sugar (1/4 c.), ketchup (1/4 c.), and dijon mustard (1 Tbsp.) topping.  This is absolutely the best meatloaf I have ever made ... a permanent addition to my recipe collection!

5 stars for the flavor. I only dropped it down a star because of the presentation. If you expect it to look and bind together (I even used 2 eggs) like a traditional meatloaf you'll be disappointed...BUT it was delicious!! I used a habanero based hot sauce that gave it some real heat. I have a wheat allergy so it was nice to find a recipe without any flour/bread crumbs/etc. Rave reviews from the table. It's definitely going into my meal rotation.

This recipe was a hit!  I didn't read the instructions thoroughly enough before putting it together, so I added the "topping" in the meatloaf mixture.  It made for a flavorful loaf!

This was quite tasty. I made a few changes though, used ketchup instead of tomato paste, sweet chili sauce instead of the hot sauce and followed the suggestion of cooking in a 6 tin muffin pan for 40 minutes, flip them out and continued baking for another 10 min. Next time I'm thinking of adding a little fresh ginger.

This was pretty good and very easy.  I omitted tomato paste because I was out and I used a large red onion and 16 oz. of ground turkey (because it came in 1 pound packages).  Even with these alterations, the end result was delicious.  Next time I will add another egg to help the loaf stay together better and use a small onion, as written.  I shaped it like one big mounded loaf on a baking sheet.  It omits a fair amount of liquid so I recommend cooking it on something with raised sides.

I really liked the consistency the quinoa gave the meatloaf.  Even the picky kid liked it! The only change I made was to use the ketchup/brown sugar topping another reviewer recommended. I think as written the topping would have been a tad bland, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I did throw some cheese in as well, but that was personal preference. We will definitely have this again. Thanks for giving me another great way to use quinoa!

I didn't have tomato paste, so I skipped the brown sugar and put in 3T ketchup instead. No hot sauce either.  Came out fantastic!  The quinoa makes for a nice texture and it had plenty of flavor.  The kids put more ketchup on it, but that is typical.

Full, happy bellies in my house tonight! At 40 minutes it was at 190 degrees- I think I could have taken it out sooner and it would have been more moist. Other than that, this was absolutely perfect!! I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor was delicious! I will definitely make this again!!

This was awesome. I added more hot sauce, just because of my preference, and also added a dash of paprika and chili powder to the mix. When it was finished I sprinkled and melted some cheese on top. My super picky boyfriend loved it too!

PERFECT! Followed recipe exactly except just put ketchup on top so it really felt like old fashioned meatloaf. Husband didn't even notice the change. I was afraid of the quinoa giving off a nutty taste. Nope! Will be putting this in my weekly meal rotation.

Doubled recipe called for 1 tbsp salt. This was way more than necessary, so cut that to about 3/4 tsp. Also added a little chili sauce, maybe 2 tbsp. And agree that cutting the hot sauce by half was better for the family ;-) Also, using red quinoa really made it look like beef!

Loved this recipe! The flavors came together nicely. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, subbing diced jalapeño for the hot sauce and less salt. I'm impressed!

Fantastic! I read some reviews and added some stuff and it was delicious. Juicy, flavorful and perfectly cooked. Served with mashed potatoes and peas. I added: some shredded cheddar, few shakes of dried rosemary, an extra egg, a tiny bit of breadcrumbs only cause I didnt have enough quinoa, ketchup replaced tomato paste only cause I didnt have it and did 1/2 the hot sauce and replaced the other half with bbq sauce per other suggestions. For the top I mixed 1/4c ketchup, 1/4c brown sugar, 1tbsp dijon and a bit of Worcestershire sauce.  I put mine in greased cupcake pans for 40mins at 350, then took them off and placed on a baking sheet for another 8mins. I wanted freezable extras. Would make again any day.

Family Favorite.  I have made this multiple times without issues.  I line a cookie sheet with aluminium foil to ease clean up.  I double the glaze on top of the loaf and omit the water to keep it thick enough to not run off the loaf as it cooks.  Fantastic.

I make this all of the time. It's great as written but I always adjust to my own liking. I double the quinoa and cook it in 1 vegetable or beef broth and also add an extra egg.  Free forming on aluminum foil on a cookie sheet makes it stay moist. My fav turkey recipe!!

VERY good! I followed the recipe exactly for the loaf part. I used a 50/50 blend of brown sugar & ketchup on the top because that's my daughter's favorite meatloaf topping. The loaf had a really good flavor. My whole family loved it!

I have been making this recipe since I started with Allrecipes years ago. It is delicious and moist. The first time I made it I forgot to put on the topping so we had it without and it was so good I've never put it on. I do use 2 lbs of ground turkey as I have three teenagers. I double the quinoa, onions, garlic, and tomato paste, one egg, and adjust the other seasonings accordingly. My teens love it (although they started having it when they were younger!).

Delicious recipe, added a bit of siracha to the meat and the glaze. I'm also using the meat recipe to make stuffed bell peppers and making it a bit more Italian for better turkey meatballs than I've found recipes for. Love this one and can be tweaked several different ways!

I am so excited to have found this recipe!  The last time I tried to make a turkey meatloaf, it had no flavor and it fell completely apart.  This was scrumptious, and it actually held together very well.   I only had a 1 lb. package of ground turkey, so I added 1/4 lb. of ground chuck to it so that I had 20 oz. of ground meat.  I also only used 1 tsp. of hot sauce.  It was excellent.  Thank you, Andrew!

This was really good and a big hit with the whole family! I left out the hot sauce, and just used ketchup instead of tomato paste. I also didn't have garlic cloves, so I just used garlic powder. The texture was perfect for meatloaf and the flavor was delicious! I'll definitely be making this again.

I will definitely be making this again.  Changes that I made were, no salt added due to the Worcestershire sauce has enough in it and only half the amount of hot sauce due to I only had a super hot one in the house.  I didn't have brown sugar to make glaze so I just put ketchup and it paired well.  Added mashed potatoes and its major comfort food meal....I will be making this for sure again!!!

Wonderful tasting and easy to make dish. I used Italian Style quinoa and the overall taste was amazing. Very soft and juicy. Will make again for a family gathering with kids accompanied by Mac & Cheese.

It took me a while to rate this, since I made it and froze it before cooking to enjoy in the early days after my baby was born. Well, I'm back!
I made it exactly to recipe. I loved it! It was moist and interesting. Much more flavorful and nutty than your typical meatloaf (which I hate). I think this would be great as meatballs too.

We liked it.  I had a large bowl of cooked quinoa but not enough other  ingredients  to make the  salad I wanted. Punched in quinoa in  "search ingredient" and this piped up. Had ground turkey so I just had to try this! As the author explained, turkey can be bland so I was sure to be generous with the seasonings. The only variations I made was adding rosemary, per another's post, and about 1/4 the  Tabasco. It was very tasty.

I do not like meatloaf. I make it maybe once a year for my husband because he does like it.  Today I was supposed to make chili. I bought my ground turkey and when I took out my recipe I realized I didn't have all the other ingredients. I decided this would be the one time this year I make meatloaf. I searched for a recipe and found this one. It turned out great, I really enjoyed it and am sure I will be making it again.

Lovely! It's unanimous, my husband, children, mother, and I all loved this recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and made it freeform, I also halved the hot sauce. I would definitely make this again.

I generally find things made from ground turkey to be pretty bland, but I thought this was delicious and juicy. I did not form the loaf, but made it in a loaf pan. I was also out of worcestershire sauce, so I made a replacement with soy sauce, lemon, sugar, and hot sauce. Both my 6 and 3 year old ate it all up (and this is unusual). I will definitely be making this again.

I have to give this 5 stars.  I have started changing my diet to clean eating, and have been doing it for about 4 months now.  I look up new recipes all the time to keep from getting bored.  My husband refuses to  eat anything that is "healthy" so I usually make a veggie for me, prepare a meat dish he will eat and then make my own side dish, like brown rice or whole grain pasta, while he sticks to packaged rice dishes or regular pasta.  I wanted to try this recipe, so i told him it was a turkey meatloaf with quinoa instead of bread crumbs, and that i could make it personal size for just me.  He said "fine....I'll try it!!"  I was shocked he would even try, since I bought low sodium ham at the deli and he wouldn't even try a taste.  When dinner was ready, he was prepared to drown the meatloaf in gravy or ketchup if it was gross.  Well, it passed with flying colors.  he went back for a second helping, and took some for leftovers the next day.  he also said he wouldn't mind if i made it again.  One small step toward getting him to join me in eating healthier!! Thank you!!!  I had to leave out the hot sauce, cuz hubby doesn't do well with spicy, but someday i will make a small one for me with that, as i Love spicy!!!

I made this exactly as described. I did not care for it as much as my husband, so I would give it a 3 but he a 5 so I rated it 4. I felt that the pepper sauce was unnecessary and there was too much worcestershire sauce. My quinoa was a bit undercooked too, so maybe adding more water to that would fix that part of it. I think with some tweaking I would like it so much more.

Wonderful surprise!   My guests loved it as did I.   I doubled the recipe also added some finely chopped celery, green pepper, mushrooms to sauté of onions and garlic.    I mixed beef and turkey as that is what was in my freezer.   Fabulous!!!

Used two eggs, and didn't have onion, so I used two shallots instead.  Tiny sprinkle of cayenne since I didn't have any kind of hot sauce. Skipped the topping altogether.  Put it in a pile (it was too gloppy to form into any other shape) in the middle of a 9x13 sprayed with Pam, and halfway thru cooking I took it out, poured off liquid, and used two small cutting boards to shape it into a loaf-like shape. Yum - and super easy cleanup!

I've made this meatloaf a few times and my family loves it!  My picky children (ages 12, 4 and 1) always ask for more!  I do use a loaf pan and have never had any issues.

Wow, this was fantastic. I followed the recipe as written (double it though) and boy am I glad I did. I shaped my loaf on tin foil not in a loaf pan. I don't think I'll ever make a meat loaf from anything else other than turkey and quinoa. Thanks for sharing!

I use this recipe all the time.  I can't have spicy food so I omit the hot sauce and it still comes out great. I've also used this recipe with beef instead of Turkey and that too is great.

Loved it! I didn't have any hot sauce so that was omitted.  Trying to add nutrients to traditional foods and the addition of quinoa to this was wonderful.  Best part? All 3 kids (9,6 and 3) ate it happily.  They like it better than my traditional meatloaf and guess what? So do I! :) Thanks for a great recipe!

I think the worcestershire ruined it for us but luckily, I had some leftover bbq sauce that we like in the fridge that i smothered it in to make it more palatable.  The texture was weird, very crumbly.  Don't know if i would make again. Maybe I would try it with beef and without the worcestershire.  I also only added 1/2 tsp salt and pepper each and it was even a bit too salty.

Loved this meatloaf!  Honestly, I was skeptical but the reviews were so good, I had to try it.  I followed the recipe as written other than substituting ketchup for tomato paste & I used an extra egg.  Delicious!  Definitely a keeper.

I'm a texture person so I was iffy on this one but holy moly this was good! I love meatloaf and would never try a turkey loaf. 
This recipe has changed my way of thinking! This has sooo much flavor I don't think I will do beef again! 
The only change I made was omit the brown sugar. I hate sweet food. I substituted ketchup in its place and turned out great!

I never liked making turkey loaf. It's always dry and tasteless. I followed this exactly as written. This is the best turkey load I have ever had. Full of flavor and moist and very light. If you don't like turkey loaf you need to try this one. It will be the only way you make it.

Excellent. Make this regularly.  As other reviewers explain, it must be baked free-form, not in a loaf pan.

My go-to recipe for meatloaf. I love this so much and it is so easy to make. I usually double it because we eat it up so fast and I love taking it to work the next day for lunch. I always follow the recipe exactly. Great as is. Highly recommend.

I have prepared this recipe several times.   Depending on what I have on hand, I have added spinach and shredded carrots(cooked with onion and garlic) and also some shredded cheddar cheese.  If in a hurry, I glaze with store bought bbq sauce.  This is also a great way to use up any leftover quinoa!  Love this recipe!!!!

To be honest I was nervous about the hot pepper sauce and the effect it would have in the taste. I followed the recipe but used Tabasco for my sauce. Mind you I don't like Tabasco and my husband doesn't care for ground turkey. My husband and I both loved it! I am definitely making this on a regular basis.

My family loves this recipe as is.  However, there are opportunities for variation - we especially like adding grated carrots and dried cranberries (almost like a thanksgiving effect) to the recipe, and omitting the brown sugar topping (too sweet).  I also interchange ketchup w tomato paste, and on occasion will also use quick cook oats to "thicken" or dry up the mix.  I always cook them as little meatballs - kid friendly and freezer friendly when the kiddos need a fast meal ready made in the morning!

I have made this time and time again...SOOO GOOD!!!  I have a 15 year old daughter who also requests this. I have made it for my picky 7 year and 9 year old niece and nephew and not so picky 1 year old niece and they really liked. I do add an extra egg (so 2 total) and don't forget to cook on a foil lined baking sheet.  For a side I make the cauliflower patties (found on this site) and they all had seconds!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious.  I used chili paste instead of hot sauce.  Otherwise, I made it as stated.  It was delicious.  The chili paste gave it a sweet flavor that wasn't overpowering.  I will definitely make it again.

absolutely delicious. definitely don't miss the beef. I made with a lb of ground turkey instead of 20 Oz because that is only way it is sold around here. kept other proportions the same except for the onion, it just looked like too much. will make again for sure.

Absolutely love making this dish! The flavor and texture are perfect. I added an extra egg which binds the meat even more. I also mixed tomato paste, worcestershire sauce, and brown sugar for the topping. Delish!

I really like how it is so moist.  I subbed Sirracha since I was out of "hot sauce."  Added about half of what it called for and although I can tolerate it, my kids probably will find it too hot.  I would decrease it even more so the next time. I also was out of Worcestershire  sauce, so I made a paleo-friendly Worcestershire  sauce, which was quite simple.  It all came out fine.  I thought the topping was a bit on the sweet side but I'm accustomed to low sugar recipes, so it's probably just me.  I would make it again, especially if my kids like it.  I prefer this GF, lower carb alternative to reg. meatloaf recipes.

Best meatloaf I've tried on here so far.   Nice bold flavours, but not overpowering.  For the hot sauce, I used Franks, because we're not big on heat in my family. 
The only thing I mucked about with was the sauce/rub.  I omitted the water, added more Worcestershire, and a bit of tomato paste.

Great taste and texture. Mods:
- added an extra egg . It made it very wet so added some quick oats
- added epicure burger seasoning
- making a double batch makes LOTS . Be sure to shape it not too high or it takes a long time to bake 
- boyfriend raved about it for days
- makes great sandwiches when cold

Update:  Made again and this time a single batch and followed the recipe as is. For us, we missed the mods I made last time so will return to my version (maybe single batch though

This meatloaf was very tasty. I would definitely make it again. If a little heat bothers you, you make want to cut back on the hot pepper sauce.

I normally dislike turkey meatloaf but this was delicious, even my husband approved.  The only change I made was that I used ketchup instead of tomato paste because I was out but it still came out amazing, way better than I thought it would be!

Love this recipe and make it all the time when craving meatloaf.  I often use Saracha instead of hot sauce or use a combo of Hot Sauce plus Saracha.   I also use a pinch of tomato paste in the mixture for the topping.  Remember - do not use Ground Turkey Breast - way too lean, and make it on a lined foil baking sheet.   It's so good!

This was delicious! I substituted the tomato paste with ketchup because that was all I had. I omitted the hot sauce. I also used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar because I was out of that too, but the coconut sugar was delicious too! I will definitely be making this again!

Made exactly as written and it turned out really well.  Was moist and flavourful, the hot sauce adds a nice bite.   I did find it a bit salty and will reduce the salt next time, but that's just personal preference.  All in all, a great recipe.  Will make this again!

This was SO good!  I could have easily ate it in one sitting.  I'll definitely be making this several times.   I made mostly as written only because I don't add sugar to recipes so I omitted the brown sugar and I still loved it.  I didn't find the hot sauce overwhelming at all.

I made this exactly as the recipe said. Yum! My family loved it! My son was skeptical at first, because he knew there was quinoa in the meatloaf. Will definitely make again.

I made it in a loaf by mistake. I used to make this all the time and forgot that I used to make it in a tray (which always turned out moist and with perfect texture). This time it turned out dry and fell apart. Also, I used to follow a reviewer suggestion that made  a nice topping with brown sugar and ketchup. I forgot to do that this time and followed original recipe topping, which didn't turn out quite right....perhaps because I used the loaf pan. Oh well! Still giving it 5 stars because when I make it right, it rocks!

Made it tonight, really great! Did not substitute anything, just minor additions. Used a boat-load of fresh chopped basil (a huge handful of leaves!) More tomato paste (used rest as sauce topping) used Red onion & added Balsamic vinegar to meat mixture & also the sauce topping. Baked on parchment paper in my Le Creuset roasting pan ... easy cleanup. Really amazing flavor, keeping this one!! Thanks Drew!

I love this recipe! Only minor adjustments were to add a little sautéed celery, parsley and cut the hot sauce by half. Really good flavor - surprisingly similar to hamburger. I have made it twice already, making small single serving loaves to freeze (although first batch never made it there!) Thank you for a winner!

I added some chopped red, yellow, green bell peppers and added tomato paste to the sauce. (I think that was intended but was not clear in the receipe/ingredients.)  I substituted raw sugar for the brown sugar because I did not have brown sugar. Really great! I will definitely make it again and again! I used a metal loaf pan while cooking.

The recipe works very well as written.  Also try adding some mashed parsnip and a green pepper to jam in more vegtables, be sure to cook the green pepper very well and cut it into very small peices.  I also added 4 oz of hot pork italian sausage to 16oz of turkey one time.  I use less hot sauce to make it 2 year old friendly.  I agree using 1tbls of hot sauce is abit over powering, depending on the hot sauce I suppose.  Wondering if I could make it and freeze it raw...

I had a couple of glasses of Chardonnay before cooking and made some mistakes, but it was delicious! I added the brown sugar to the loaf and then mixed tomato paste and the 2 tbsp of worchestire to make the topping (no brown sugar).

After having made this over a dozen times, I have to say this is an absolute favorite of mine. I have made slight adjustments to the recipe each time and think I finally found the adjustments that make it my all time favorite.

Instead of only 1/4 cup of quinoa, I use 1 cup uncooked quinoa (likely about 2 cups cooked) in the final recipe. I also use an entire chopped white onion.

I added 4 tbsp of tomato paste for a redder color and more flavor as well as about 2 tbsp pepper. With additional quinoa and onion, I feel the extra tomato paste and pepper help keep the flavor. 

I also left the glaze off my most recent attempt at the recipe and actually much preferred it and felt it was healthier without the brown sugar.

This recipe, whether made as listed or with your own variations, will not disappoint!

Lastly - I cook this in muffin pans for easy serving sizes and a slightly reduced cooking time.

This meatloaf is incredible!  I've tried many recipes from AllRecipes over the years and this is by far one of our favorites that we continue to make again and again.  I use 93/7 turkey, red quinoa and Tabasco for my hot sauce.  I add just a few shakes of salt and pepper.   Following the advice of another reviewer, I changed the topping to 1/4 c ketchup, 1/4 c brown sugar, 1 T ground mustard and a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce.  The loaf I just made read 187 degrees on the meat thermometer after 45 minutes at 350 degrees in the oven.  As always, it came out moist and tasty! My husband made his into a sandwich on sourdough.  I ate it with green beans and salad.  This dish is quick to put together and makes for an easy clean up and tasty leftovers.  Try it!  You'll love it!

While I am a true "traditional meatloaf" lover,  this is the BEST meatloaf I've ever made and much less time consuming with fewer ingredients than my usual recipe  which you would never know because the flavor punch this meatloaf  packs along with the moist texture! Unbelievable! The bonus is with the quinoa, this must be a healthier version. This will be a regular menu item in my house

This turned out well!  I added a little shredded zucchini as I had some to use up,  used two eggs so it would hold together better with the zucchini and used a little A-1 instead of hot sauce as we have a kiddo.   Andrew B's hints were very helpful (the 2 egg  idea).  I will make again!

This is hands-down the best recipe for turkey meatloaf. The quinoa adds a little tooth and the cooking method (on a jelly roll pan not in a loaf pan) made all the difference. I did add some celery and carrot to my sautéed onions and one extra egg. Came out perfect! Outstanding...thank you for the tips!

This is an awesome recipe.  I followed it step-by-step, and used Siracha as the hot sauce option.  My boyfriend and I almost ate the whole loaf in one sitting.  It's a new favorite!

This was amazing! I used sirracha in place of the hot sauce, and ketchup instead of tomato paste. I did use a 9x5x2 bread pan to cook it in, and even though it was sitting cooking in the fat, it still held together very well. I removed the meat from the pan and let it rest so it wouldn't soak up any more fat than necessary, and it didn't crumble up.

This was delicious! Left out the onions and the hot sauce and this meatloaf turned out to be the best  meatloaf I've ever eaten. You can really taste the quinoa and the Worcestershire sauce and those flavors work great with the turkey. Easy to make and delicious; I'll be making this on a regular basis.

Made this tonight for dinner using  ground turkey breast, 97% lean, meat.  Followed recipe exactly with these exceptions - used shallot instead of garlic ( don't like garlic), used 1 teaspoon of  Tabasco sauce instead of 1 tablespoon, added 2 eggs ( instead of 1 as suggested by the author) & added 1/4  plain panko bread crumbs to the mix as it seemed too liquidy.  Very good will definitely make it again!

I really enjoyed this recipe. My only regret is telling my quinoa hating guy that this wasn't a "real" meatloaf. He hears quinoa and it's all over. This recipe was moist and tasty and I'd make it again. I'd listened to other reviews and made my standard topping of ketchup/brown sugar, but I think that was a mistake. Next time I'll use the recipe topping. I also won't use Tabasco as the "hot sauce". I used half the amount and it still had a bite.  Overall satisfied and think this is a great alternative to ground beef and bread crumbs.

It was really yummy.  I used ground beef as I was looking for a tastier meatloaf.  This was really good. I think I used a little too much quinoa as it fell apart easily. Definitely going to try it with turkey meat as well.

This is surprisingly delicious!  Turkey can be bland but the ingredients in this dish make it so tasty I don't add any sauce (and I always pile my meatloaf with ketchup)!

Loved it! My his ac loves meatloaf, but we're trying to avoid red meat. He loved this! It definitely has a little kick to it and is incredibly flavorful. 

The only change I made was the quinoa I used. Our food store didn't have plain quinoa so I used vegetable quinoa and it was delicious! 

We will definitely be having this again!

Excellent recipe! I have been making this for a few years now and have since modified the recipe to include pureed fresh roma tomato in place of the tomato paste and a bit of freshly grated carrots. My little one prefers the version with fresh tomatoes and carrots, which is perhaps a little more colorful, and therefore, a bit more attractive to young picky eaters! ;-)

This seems like a fool-proof recipe.  How could I not review this when my family scarfed it down?  I have made this twice  and my 10, 7 and 4 year old and my husband had thirds!  This time, I didn't have tomato paste so I tried to simmer down tomato sauce but it didn't quite work.  I got a flat loaf and I was so disappointed as I served it.  But, the kids didn't care, even though it was kind of overcooked (because of the thickness).  They eat this like they haven't eaten all day!  This has officially made it into my meal planning rotation.

I LOVE THIS! Thank you! The stars in my opinion were the hot sauce (I used Sriracha) and brown sugar. It had great flavor and was very moist. This was the first time ever I did not dip my meatloaf in ketchup! Also the first time I've ever made meatloaf on my own. Great tip on the cookie sheet too (who'da thunk it?)! Will def make again!

I loved this recipe. I by coincidence  had a ground beef and turkey blend of meat in the fridge. I had to double everything because I wanted to use the whole 5lbs of meat.  I added more quinoa (red) and I still added Italian bread crumbs because mine was a bit moist. Totally, my own doing by adding more worchest. sauce etc.  But I loved the flavor and ease of this. It is my now my first  go to recipe for meatloaf.

Excellent alternative to traditional meatloaf!  I use this as a base and switch up spices for variety.  I have used Mexican spices and Indian spices and both turned out excellent!

I made meatballs with BBQ sauce for dipping instead of meatloaf.  It came out great!  Browned them in a pan then finished in the oven.  They were so good!  This recipe is a keeper for sure.  Thank you!

I loved the flavor of this meatloaf.  My only problem was that there was a lot of juice in the pan.  I ended up pouring it off .  Also, when I sliced the loaf, it wasn't very cohesive .  It was somewhat crumbly.   I added shredded kale because  I'd seen a meatloaf at whole foods  with greens in it.  Delicious addition, but probably contributed to the wetness of my dish.  Overall, very tasty and I will try it again.

I am a complete novice. The first time I made it I got a quinoa rice mix instead of plain quinoa. I burned the onion and garlic. My kids loved it. Friends at work gave it a thumbs up. Kids asked me to make it again. This has given me a lot of hope that I can give them healthy meals that I make from fresh ingredients on my own.

This is the best meatloaf ever!! Even die hard ground beef lovers enjoyed this turkey recipe. The only substitution I made was that I used brown rice instead of quinoa since I didn't have any on hand. Also thank you for the open loaf tip. I've had issues with using loaf pans and didn't know what I was doing wrong.

I like this recipe, it is pretty good. The next time I make this I will add another egg as I would prefer the consistancy to be a little bit firmer, and maybe some cheese as others have suggested.

the topping sauce was not "pastey" at all. Think ill try adding the tomato paste to the sauce rather than the meat mix next time. Very Good though

Followed this recipe exactly as written.  The result was not bad - the texture was good - didn't fall apart but I did find there was a sweet undertone to the flavour of this meat loaf.  The spicy was ok but too sweet for my liking - I would cut both the pepper sauce and the Worcester sauce.  Liked the idea of the turkey and the quinoa - healthy alternative to regular meatloaf and for quinoa haters - they probably won't even know it's in the meatloaf unless you tell them.

This is the best use of quinoa!!! I actually do not like the taste of quinoa, but I didn't want the stuff that I had on hand to go to waste. I saw this recipe and one other user commented that you cannot even taste it. 
I omitted the hot sauce and subbed BBQ. My hubby and kiddos loved it! Thanks for a great recipe!

I might never go back to a beef meatloaf!  I followed the recipe except for the Tomato paste, which I didn't have.  I used ketchup instead.  Some people went to 2 eggs but honestly, this recipe is just great as is.  I also, with some trepidation used the full amount of hot sauce and it was, surprisingly, not overpowering at all.   I added brown sugar and ketchup to the topping, which might have taken it to a 6-stars but takes nothing away from the recipe as is.  5 stars all the way.  The author of this recipe said her husband couldn't tell it wasn't beef - neither could mine.  Deee-licious!

I made mainly as suggested, though I did add two eggs as many reviewers recommended.  For the topping, instead of using what the recipe asked for, I mixed about a tablespoon and a half of Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy BBQ Sauce and a tablespoon and a half of spicy brown mustard and spread over the meatloaf before going in the oven with a basting brush and it was delicious, my husband loved it and immediately asked for it to go in the rotation.  

I almost made the mistake of putting this in a loaf pan, until I read the recipe again, do not make that mistake.  

Make this, you and your family will love it!

I didn't make any changes and I absolutely loved it and will make it again.  The texture was great but what I think I liked the most was the perfect blend of spice.  It had amazing flavor.  Btw, for hot sauce I used tobasco.  Thank you!

This was OK. It was a bit dull even though I made some alterations to enhance the flavours. Everyone ate it, which is a plus when you have a family of five, but no one was particularly enthusiastic.  I would suggest added more herbs, seeds or nuts, maybe some cranberries etc

This is the best turkey meatloaf recipe I have ever found!!  I doubled the recipe to make 1 loaf for me & my husband.  I didn't use the hot pepper sauce, NO salt, only 1 tablespoon worcestershire and added extra garlic (just a personal preference) added 1 large diced carrot & followed other reviewers advice & cooked my quinoa in chicken broth.   The quinoa made my ground turkey breast moist and added a nice texture.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Served with crab & broccoli salad & roasted garlic mashed potatoes.

This recipe is EXCELLENT - possibly our new favorite meal!! It's moist, it's got a little kick, and the sweetness from the topping balances it out perfectly. SO good! I combed through all the reviews to find the best alterations and this is what I changed:
A. Cooking
- I doubled this recipe because it is DELICIOUS!
- I cooked half of my batch in muffin tins (350F, 32 mins), the other half as two separate loafs
B. Loaf Ingredients
- 1 tbs ketchup instead of 1 tbs tomato paste
- 1/2 tbs hot pepper sauce instead of 1 whole tbs (it still had enough kick!)
- 1.5 egg instead of 1
- 1/2 tsp rosemary (added)
- 1/2 a zucchini, diced (added)
- 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar (added)
C. Topping Ingredients (another reviewer's recipe)
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup ketchup
1 tbs mustard
1/2 tsp Worcestershire

This turkey recipe is as close as it gets to beef folks! I stopped eating beef 10 years ago and have been able to find a tasty meat or protein substitute for just about all of my favorite beef recipes, with the exception of the classic American meatloaf.  My previous attempts at turkey meatloaf always seemed a little bland and watery, at least until now.  The quinoa cleverly disguises the ground turkey, both in appearance and taste.  My husband who is all about meat and potatoes even admitted this could be mistaken as beef.  I eliminated the hot sauce and it was still very flavorful.  Be sure to wait the full 10 minutes before slicing and it will hold together nicely.   I revised the glaze since we are attempting  to reduce sugar intake.  Substituted the brown sugar with 2 tablespoons of organic ketchup and mixed with the 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce. Sliced the entire loaf to store and now look forward to cold meatloaf sandwiches!

Great meatloaf! I eliminated the hot pepper (two kids) and didn't miss it at all. The meatloaf was so flavorful! And even my kid who claims not to like quinoa liked it. (I didn't tell him what was in it.) Rather than meatloaf shape, I used a muffin tin and baked them for about 25 minutes. It's faster plus the kids really prefer Meatloaf Muffins, to a slab from a loaf.

I don't usually like ground turkey but it was all i had to make dinner with.  Tried this recipe, did not change anything and it was amazing!! If your making for kids i would probably cut the hot sauce in half but it was perfect for me!

This recipe was absolutely amazing! Smelled just like classic meatloaf, but tasted 10 times better! The quinoa gave it a surprising but wonderful texture, and the brown sugar mixture on top was the icing on the cake (or meatloaf, I suppose). Very eager to make this recipe again!

Besides eating quinoa as a replacement of my starch (rice), this was the FIRST recipe I tried with quinoa & first time making meatloaf. I am impressed!!

Flavor: very flavorful and delicious
Moisture: very moist
Difficulty: beginner

I followed the recipe as close as possible with some changes based on the reviews.
Changes I've made:
- 1 more egg
- Half the salt (you can always add but not take out!)
- Half the brown sugar
- Ketchup (didn't have tomato paste)
- BBQ sauce (didn't want spice)

Recipe was easy to follow. Took a little while from start to finish, just because it had to bake. It IS a very soft mixture (because it's so moist!) so it was interesting to mold into a loaf shape. Because it's so moist, it won't be nice & tall like a traditional meatloaf but honestly, who cares? It's sooooo good! :)

WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN!! I'm already drooling...

I added julianned zucchini and squash, about 1/3 of a cup total, to increase the healthy factor.  I also used significantly more garlic, 4 cloves.  The "paste" did not turn into a paste even when I added extra brown sugar, but I poured it over the loaf and it turned out fine.  Just noting that it's not a paste, don't expect it to be.  Overall, it was a good dish and I will be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this several times and it is my favorite Allrecipe of all million recipes. This one! No need to alter anything but this round I diced up a spicy banana pepper from the garden and threw it in, omitted the hot sauce. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Amazing!..this is a great start but here is how I tweaked it to take this recipe over the top. 1st, cooked quinoa in chicken stock, as I always do and others have noted, 2nd, used bbq sauce instead of hot sauce as it meshes better with the Worcestershire sauce, to get that heat back add a dash of cayenne, then add fresh sage and rosemary from the yard and finally about a 1/4 cup of fresh grated parm!

I didn't like this at all. The combination of flavor was weird and it was too peppery. The sugar coating did not enhance the dish at all. I ended up using ketchup to mask the flavor of the meatloaf. It was also a bit dry.

I made this and the only thing I took out was the hot sauce (for my 2 & 3 year old- even if it was just a tablespoon..) and it was AWESOME.  My husband who does not like meatloaf, and doesn't like turkey, ate the whole thing, and then asked me to make it again!  That is BIG coming from him!!!!  This recipe is a perfect pair for turkey and quinoa, and super healthy!!!

Love this version of turkey meatloaf. Love the quinoa in it, what a great idea! I didn't have any tomato paste on hand so I used ketchup and as it was cooking I realized I forgot the brown sugar so I sprinkled maybe about a tablespoon on top of it. I didn't add the onion because my son doesn't like them. But it turned out great. Very moist and good flavor. The only thing was after mixing the raw ingredients together it was super loose and had to kind of pour it in the baking dish and I lightly greased the dish as well.  I will make this again.

This is becoming a favorite in our family. My "meat and potatoes" husband requested it even though we just had it last week. I was hesitant to mention it had quinoa in it (he knew, haha)! He even said this was better than the meatloaf I usually make (mini meatloaves recipe from this site).

I will never make meatloaf from beef again. This is that good. I actually had this recipe saved for a long time before I tried it, knowing that my husband hates quinoa. (Actually, he refuses to even try it.) But I made this yesterday and stayed true to the recipe, with the exception of adding one extra egg. It was wonderful. It's full of flavor and very moist. My husband loved it too, although I never did tell him that it contained quinoa. We had just enough left to make meatloaf sandwiches for tonight. If you're on the fence, give this recipe a try. There's a reason why it's received so many rave reviews.

Beautifully done, well made, recipe. Growing up, I did not consume a lot of beef. For some reason, beef sits on my stomach forever and makes me feel bloat and sick. To have a recipe to substitute beef is wonderful. I can eat this and not feel sick afterwards! Also, it saves money because ground turkey is cheaper than beef!

I LOVE this recipe. Ground turkey always seems so blah, so after fixing this, it's been a permanent addition to the dinner rotation. I add chopped zucchini to mine, and after reading other reviews, I also add another egg. Instead of breadcrumbs, I've added smushed up croutons- SO GOOD! I also suggest cooking your quinoa in chicken broth, makes a big flavor difference. I use Franks Red Hot, and I'm a mild gal, wasn't too spicy for me, even my 16 month old goes to town on this. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

Great recipe! AAA+++ Followed reviews added an extra egg, 1tbsp fresh Rosemary, 1tbsp Bar-B-Q sauce, 1tbsp Deli Mustard. Also followed reviews for glaze and brushed on at 20mins left to cook (next time I'll put it on before placing on the oven)......1/2cup ketchup, 1/2cup dark brown sugar, 2tbsp mustard, few dashes of Worcestershire, few dashes of liquid smoke. Was fairly wet as described before laying on cooking sheet added around 1/2cup Panko bread crumbs. BAM!

Amazing. My husband couldn't eat enough of it! the meat was a little spicy and then the sauce on top was sweet. And it was very juicy. Oh but I used sriracha for the spicy sauce at the same measurement because that's all we had. It was great.

I was cautiously optimistic making this recipe for the first time. I was certain I would like it, but would the picky husband? The results- he loved it!! It is our go-to meatloaf recipe now and he doesn't even mind that it's turkey and not beef. I didn't tell him until after that it had quinoa in it, he had no idea. So yummy!

Perfect as is! I omitted the hot sauce since I have little ones, so I added some fresh cracked pepper for a mild kick. It was great! We will definitely have this again and again!!

My husband LOVES this recipe. Since I've made it (Which was just about 3 weeks ago) I have made a whole meat loaf 4 times. He has even suggested it for when his best friend came over for dinner. I must admit it is pretty darn tasty. The only changes I have made to the recipe is I put the loaf in a bread pan for about 55 minutes in stead. I mix all ingredients in the same bread pan and then flatten it as much as possible and put barbecue sauce on it instead of the sauce suggested to be made. It comes out amazing!

Way too soggy, fell apart immediately.  Even after resting for 10 minutes...and making sure it was cooked through it was a soggy mess. I did everything in the recipe as stated. Not quite what I was hoping for :(

Very good! I doubled it and baked it in muffin cups for kid sized servings. Couldn't taste the quinoa and avoided the Alpo taste that results when you mix hamburger and tomato sauce.

A bit spicy for my seven year old, but we liked it very much overall.  Changes made: cut salt to 1/2 t, added 1/2 t thyme, 1/4 c diced red pepper, substitute ketchup for tomato paste (easier).  Next time, I might add extra egg to see if it will hold together better. We liked glaze, but half would have been enough, the rest just ran off and burnt in the oven.

This is a great recipe. I have to be very sneaky when trying to make my family eat ground Turkey but this one was so good, they didn't care. I didn't have any tomato paste so I subbed it with tomato sauce & sun dried tomato tapenade. I also read comments about which ground turkey to use and the right pan. It had a hint of spicy and sweet. It came out perfect.  Will be making it again. Thanks for sharing.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever made. It is easy and I love that it uses quinoa instead of bread crumbs. I don't like using beef for meatloaf, even lower fat is super greasy and doesn't have much flavor sometimes. This is so so good and making it on the baking sheet gets rid of the little fat there is in the turkey. I have made it over and over again. Love love!

We loved it! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the glaze. Instead I mixed ketchup and hot sauce because our family likes it hot! Like many reviewers, I used a mix of white and dark turkey. This is a winner (and healthy)! It will become part of the regular rotation. Thanks, Drew!

My husband LOVED this meatloaf!  I usually make a turkey meatloaf, but no recipe has ever received such an enthusiastic response!  He had no idea there was quinoa in it (he probably would not have eaten it if I had told him in advance--not because he doesn't like quinoa, but only because he doesn't know what that is).  He has proclaimed this his favorite meatloaf.  And it is so easy to make!

I tried this recipe and it was very well received. I made do with what I had on hand, I had all white meat ground turkey and didn't mind that it crumbled a little. I added some rosemary and pressed in a couple of slices of applewood smoked bacon as "garnish." It tastes great and  even better the second day. I'm going to make a sandwich out of it today.
Thanks for sharing!

Considering this is ground Turkey, my family loved it! It's meatloaf, remember. Flavorful and easy.

This was a hit (pretty much) in our family. I do not like meatloaf at all, but never thought of making with ground turkey. But we were getting kind of bored with same stuff so I tried this for my husband. He really liked it. Only reason 4 stars, is because the kids liked it, but not "loved!" it. I will definitely be including in my rotation though. Thank you!

I made this almost exactly to the recipe, making sure I used a combination of white and dark turkey meat.  For the hot sauce I used Sriracha sauce.  I served it with roasted vegetables.  It actually took about an hour to cook, but was so worth the wait.  I am by no means an accomplished cook, but this was delicious!!  Whoever said in the reviews that it needed more flavor, I can't understand.  Several people said they didn't use the topping that the recipe called for, and I believe that was a mistake, because it tied everything together so well and brought out a delicious taste.  I will definitely make this again!!

This is a great recipe as is, and it also adapts easily to use whatever else is in the fridge. I doubled the recipe size by adding a pound of  ground chicken to the ground turkey. In the fry pan, along with the grilled onions, I added half of a red bell pepper, finely diced, half of a zucchini, again, finely diced, and a carrot, finely shredded. In addition to the cooked quinoa, I added half a cup of oats, and a few tablespoons of milk(put this into a large bowl first, allow milk and oats to soak while frying vegetables) I didn't have tomato paste, so I used a tablespoon of ketchup instead. In addition to the black pepper, I added a heavy dash of cumin, turmeric, and coriander. Mixed it all up using 3 eggs, shaped it into a loaf in a 9x13 glass baking dish, then topped it off with a lattice of woven thin sliced bacon, tucking the ends under the loaf(used about 10 strips, 5 in each direction). In the last ten minutes of baking, I drizzled 2 tablespoons of raspberry chipotle marinade, instead of the brown sugar-Worcestershire mix to glaze. It was awesome!

Best Turkey Meatloaf I've ever had!

To save time I used 365 Frozen Quinoa with veggies which only added to the great flavor. As suggested by others, I used two eggs for better binding and some chopped fresh herbs. Easy,  moist, flavorful - I will definitely make again!

Best Meatloaf I've Tasted! You won't know it isn't beef. Moist, delicious  and easy to make. I added little more on all wet ingredients even the tomato paste and I packed the quinoa and brown sugar, I also used a Jumbo egg.
Try it, You'll Like It!

This meatloaf didn't really end up being a meatloaf. I ended up having to just dump it out the loaf pan and cooking it in a skillet. It tastes really good, I'm just disappointed in how soft and loose it was. And due to the tomato paste, it had a pinkish/red tint to it and a "wet" look that made me uncomfortable because it didn't look "done". I'm trying the whole low carb bit so I was really excited to find a meatloaf that didn't require breadcrumbs. But I was weary of it because I wasn't sure how it was going to bind together. Something told me to use a small amount of breadcrumbs.  And I was right, I should have. I guess it's a matter of preference too. I like my meatloaf to be dense, maybe others don't. Also, I wasn't aware that it was supposed to be cooked flat. I just assumed otherwise since its meatloaf. But it is a flavorful meatloaf. Hopefully, if you're making this then you read the reviews first

I have made dozens of recipes from this site over the years, but I have never left a review until now.  This turkey meatloaf is amazing!  I mean, I have never had a more delicious meatloaf, and I have made meatloaf at least 10 different ways over the years.  And I love it because I can feel better about what I am feeding my kids.  The only thing I did was add a second egg, which the writer noted was an option.  I followed everything else to a tee.

Very nice..if you want it extra juicy, you can add 1/2 lb mushrooms to a quadrupled recipe as I did. Made 3 large loafs. Freezes nicely and took another's advice amd did 1/4 c ketchup, 1/4 c brown sugar and 1 tbsp mustard as topper. Yummy w mashed potatoes and cream corn!

Really good, even the husband liked it and he's neither a quinoa or turkey fan!  I reduced the hot sauce to a few dashes because a whole tablespoon sounded like a recipe for a mouth on fire.  The few dashes added a kick but didn't make it unedible like I'm sure a whole tablespoon would have.

Best turkey meatloaf I have ever had! I took the advice and used 2 eggs, ketchup instead of paste, and would only suggest doubling the recipe for the sauce that goes on top because it tastes so good and really sets it off. This is definitely the recipe I will use from now on.

Should have1 read reviews and added an extra egg for binding and not used a loaf pan =/  Cooked for about 1 hr and it was delicious! Will definitely make again with the suggested changes. Thanks for a great recipe!

Meh.  I've had better and will probably not make this again.  We ended up tossing the leftovers.

A great healthy meatloaf. Skipped the glaze the tomatoe paste, and hot sauce (alergies) and it was still delicious.  The kids loved it too!

I just made it tonight and it was great!  I used one of those four bags of ground turkey you can get at Costco.  I didn't put any hot sauce and used tomato sauce(less amount) instead of tomato paste because I didn't have one.  I had one tofu so I used about 1/4 of it.  I smashed it before mixing it.  The glaze gave it a nice flavor and moisture that I didn't need any gravy.  
This is on the salty side so I might use less salt next time.  Thank you so much for sharing such a good recipe!

I do not throw out 5 stars... but let me tell you this... this is THE recipe I have been looking for.  The ONLY thing I did differently, by mere necessity... I literally had 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce left.. and threw 1 tbsp of A-1 to make up the difference.  My husband loves quinoa and hates meatloaf, so I said, let's meet in the middle and try this.  My husband, my 9 year old, my 1 year old and I... I should have made 2 loaves at once... we have the smallest bit left but I was thinking dang, this would make amazing cold sandwiches tomorrow.

This is HANDS down the best turkey meatloaf I have ever had.  Thank you for the recipe...

Very flavorful.  I changed it up by adding just one bratwurst sausage link into the mix (yes, that's definitely cheating) and using ketchup instead of tomato paste (after doubling the amount in lieu of hot sauce).  Didn't have quite enough onion lying around, so I used about a teaspoon of Lipton onion soup mix to season the quinoa while cooking and then threw a little extra into the meat mixture itself.  Not wanting to spend an hour waiting, I decided just to pan-fry the meat into turkey burgers and skipped the glaze altogether.  Delicious!

This was the best meatloaf my bf and I have ever had! Wow! I added a green bell pepper and sauteed it with the onions. I also added a couple sprigs of fresh rosemary and thyme from the garden, minced and tossed in at the same time as the garlic. I omitted a half teaspoon of salt. I didn't realize that I needed to free form the loaf, so it was pretty juicy. It didn't fall apart too bad though. This was my first time making a meatloaf and only my second time having Turkey. This is so much better than beef and I am a beef fanatic! Enjoy!

What a great way to add quinoa to meatloaf. I doubled and added chopped fresh spinach to onions/garlic after cooking it and spinach blended well. I did use organic grass fed beef (unusual pick for us) and it was extremely popular with family. Will use turkey next time, thank you!

I approximately doubled the recipe (used 2 16oz packages of ground turkey) so I used one big onion, a few cloves of garlic, 1/2 cup of quinoa, 2 eggs, and like others said, I used BBQ sauce instead of Worcestershire or hot sauce. Also added a little ketchup and really enjoyed it! You can't really tell it's not beef, and it's tasty and very filling and healthy!

I made this and we loved it.  I also cooked the quinoa in chicken broth. I didn't add the hot sauce, but I did add a second egg per another reviewer's suggestion.  For the glaze I used ketchup, worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, and a drop or two of Caribbean habanero hot sauce for the spice.  The recipe didn't specify what kind of ground turkey to use, so I used 85/15 which isn't as healthy as lean but I liked the results.  The meatloaf was moist with a nice texture.  I might try 93/7 turkey next time.

I made this with some hesitancy, but we absolutely loved the final result. I had to make some changes based on what we had on hand. I didn't have garlic or onions, so it was essentially turkey, quinoa, cheese (1/2C (60g) - I wanted some, not a lot) and spices. In addition to the recipe, I added quite a bit of onion and garlic powder, a touch of cumin, used one tablespoon of barbecue sauce in place of the hot pepper sauce, and since I didn't have tomato paste, I used one tablespoon of pasta sauce. I also rubbed a thin layer of barbecue sauce on the outside instead of the rub. I was worried the barbecue sauce (Montgomery Inn) would overwhelm, but it didn't. I also cooked the quinoa in water with a chicken bouillon cube, and the one egg was plenty. Shaped it as suggested, plopped it into the center of a 9x13 dish, and 50 minutes later we had an extremely tasty, yet healthy, meatloaf! Thanks so much for the recipe, the quinoa really makes it!

Hey, this was pleasantly delicious.  I did lessen the hot sauce (and by "hot", I mean Cholula--I basically halved it) and added a bit more garlic because we loooooves the garlic in this house. Other than that, I prepared it as stated and it was a win.

Delicious! I agree the secret is to bake in free form loafs so the meat doesn't swim in its excreted juices. Allows it to get a nice crisp crust and helps it hold together well for slicing. I made two types: the traditional and an Italian version with herb de province and parm. Great for sandwiches the next day!

Delicious recipe and I'm not even a fan of meatloaf. I wouldn't change anything about this! Watched the video and followed exact instructions. I made this with Lauren's Sour Cream and Chive Mashed Potatoes.

It was just so-so.  My own turkey meatloaf much better.  Use breadcrumbs instead of quinoa (about half a cup or more- add enough until you get the texture you like).  Also throw in some frozen peas/carrots along with the onions.  I also don't feel the need to pre-cook the onions- 45 minutes of cooking the entire meatloaf is plenty time to cook the onion.  I also throw in a garlic/onion/parsley dried spice called "Parsley Patch" for seasoning.  Also add some mile and skip the worscestershire / brown sugar thing.  Simply top with ketchup instead before you bake.

I have NOT made this yes, but I have to submit a rating, so this is not necesarily auccurate (but it sure sounds good!) Has anyone tried increasing the liqud a bit and just letting the quionoa cook into the meatloaf, eliminatng that first step?

Great flavor!  Used leanest turkey (97% fat free) but added a little greek yogurt and shredded apple to keep it moist. Put in a little oregano and basil. Also mine only took about 35 minutes to bake on convection bake setting 350 degrees.

I made this for dinner last night, and both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was.  I have tried using turkey in the past, and no matter what I did, it was always bland and boring.  We loved the flavor and the texture of this, and it will definitely be my "go-to" recipe for turkey loaf in the future.  I did use less hot sauce (1 tsp instead of 1 tbsp) than indicated as highly-spiced foods don't agree with me, and I added a tablespoon more tomato paste as I love tomato flavor.

Delicious meatloaf!! I love the healthy aspect of this dish, but it has to taste good too, right? Well, this certainly does! The first time I made it, I left out the hot sauce (personal preference - I knew it would not work for my family's tastes so I just left it out) and added some basil - I have to add basil when I use any form of tomato in a dish :) - and otherwise followed the recipe as written and my family and I loved it! Like all cooks, as I continue to make this dish, I tweak it here and there, but overall I follow the general recipe and always get delicious results!

Loved it and so did my family.  Using quinoa instead of bread crumbs makes this very light.  Will be making this again.  Goes great with wild rice, and baked green chard with feta cheese.

I tried this recipe tonight and it came out really good.  Moist and very flavourful.  It was a hit.  

I did make a few small changes tho.  I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth instead of water (and for 1/4 of a cup it's 1 1/2 cups of broth, not just 1/2 cup as it suggests in the recipe), I grated a small zucchini and mixed it into step 4, and I added about a 1/2-3/4 teaspoon of Italian Seasoning for flavour.

Wow! I used boxed quinoa flavored with garlic & olive oil as this was all I had on hand. Even with the quinoa being flavored, I still followed the recipe with the exception of reducing the salt. I also doubled this recipe for my family of six, and scaled back on the hot sauce to make it kid friendly. Was this ever tasty!!! You can't even tell it's made with turkey! It's moist, flavorful, and simple to prepare! I used a loaf pan without any problems. I just drained off the excess drippings halfway through cooking and again before serving. I tasted the glaze as written and knew it would be a bit too savory for my children's taste buds, so I added some ketchup to it and it was perfect! All four kids asked for seconds and one even helped herself to a THIRD serving! The leftovers were even better the next day! Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!

There are several steps to getting this meatloaf together, but, it was worth it!  The flavor was very good and even my husband loved it.  The only problem I had was that the meatloaf completely crumbled once sliced.  When you tried to cut it with your fork it would completely fall apart.  I followed the recipe to a T.  I am not sure what happened with the texture - I am wondering if it had too much moisture.  I will definitely try again though because it was delicious.

Great with the topping from some other recipe...brown sugar, soy sauce, mustard kind of thing. Loved the texture and didn't have that ketchupped taste. Could have been more moist.

I've made this recipe several times, and I love it! My picky 11 year old actually asks for this for dinner. The quinoa is so interesting in the meatloaf and the sauce on top adds a nice sweetness. I used red quinoa.

I love this recipe! I've made it several times already and even gave the recipe to one of my friends to try. I don't use hot pepper sauce so that is the only thing I omitted/changed, otherwise, perfect!

I doubled my recipe and added an extra egg.  It has a nice light texture.  I'm going to cut the hot sauce in half next time, some of my family found it a little strong.  Depends on your tolerance and the hot sauce you use.

I cooked this today and it would be one of the best Meatloaves I have ever cooked.
I used sweet chilli sauce instead of hot sauce and also diced up some red and green capsicum very small.
Made them into mini loaves and I also mixed up some Dijon mustard with BBQ sauce for the top.
As suggested by another member I poked 3 holes in each loaf so the sauce would seep down into it.
They were loved by all and I will be certainly keeping this recipe as a favourite. Thanks for posting.

I use this all the time. People LOVE IT!! I just make extra sauce for top of loaf. Hot sauce and quinoa are Fabulous additions.  Have probably produced this 20+ times in last year.

My husband and I enjoyed this to some degree but I found it too salty . I did like that quinoa was added for extra health but I didn't notice any extra flavours because of it.

I slightly increased the quinoa and cooked it in a stoneware loaf pan despite the suggestion not to. Ended up leaving it in the oven closer to 1 hour and 15 min to be sure it was done. It was moist, flavorful, and I couldn't bear to drizzle it with ketchup like I do with regular meatloaf. Definitely will make it again.

UPDATE: second time making this, still added more quinoa and also a second egg. Didn't have tomato paste, subbed ketchup. Was rushed so I threw the glaze ingredients into the mix by mistake, made a slightly sweeter meatloaf but still delicious. Also glazed with BBQ sauce (yum!) And added small cubes of cheddar cheese in the mix. Cooked on sheet pan as directed, but it was raw in the middle after 50 min. Another 20-25 min,  and I'd say it was done.

I really love this recipe and have used it many times. The best part about it is that it's so versatile and can be played with. Most recently, I had some carrots and zucchini to use. I shredded them and added about 1/2 cup of each to the mix. It was great! Only problem is that it barely fit in the pan!

Wow ... brilliant. a delicious, healthy and easy recipe.  looks like quinoa will be on my shopping list from now on.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was scrumptious.  after mixing the topping it was a little runny and some did not stay on the loaf so maybe I'll leave out the water next time or somehow thicken it up because I loved the taste.

Well this recipe did end up being everything I thought it would be, and I can't believe I was eating healthy! I did add the extra egg to bind it a little more and I used a only a few dashes of Cholula for my hot sauce! I chose to cook this in a loaf pan because it seemed easiest to me. As Drew stated it does produce a bit of turkey juice but if you cook it for about 65-70 Min instead of the 50 the water cooks in and gives the Loaf so much moisture and flavor! Seriously can't believe how tasty this was! My husband fell in love with me all over again! THANK YOU DREW

We're always looking for inventive healthy recipes and this one is a keeper.  This was a hit with the whole family.  The only changes that I made were to add an extra egg and use chicken broth in place of the water.  This was accompanied by fresh green beans and hatch chile cornbread. Yum!

Such a nice recipe! The quinoa added a very nice texture to the ground turkey. I was a little afraid of the hot sauce, not for me, I love spice. But for my family of sensitive taste buds.  What a really pleasant surprise. Just the right amount of spice.  This recipe is very flavorful. I can definitely recommend.

This was so tasty. I haven't had meatloaf in years. I used 1/2 a container turkey and doubled the quinoa(I don't like meat very much) The only other thing I did different was the topping, I put about 1/4 cup ketchup, 2 tablespoons tomatoe sauce, 3 tablespoons worstershire, 5 tablespoons brown sugar. Was sweet and delicious.

I was trying to use up some quinoa, which I don't particularly like, and some ground turkey, which is not high on my list either,  this was the best use of ground turkey I've ever had.  It was moist, flavorful, meaty tasting and really delicious .

Great meatloaf!!  Cooked the quinoa in chicken broth, added minced garlic and onion powder to the quinoa at the end of cooking time (instead of cooking them separately)and used about 1/2 the Tabasco.  Very flavorful and much healthier than regular meatloaf. I didn't even bother with the glaze. I will make this again!

I just made this for the first time tonight.  It is seriously the best meatloaf I've ever had! I added Diana's honey garlic BBQ sauce and franks red hot sauce, a little red wine and crushed some regular crackers then put that brown sugar mixture on top and cooked for an hour.  It was perfect! My mom even asked me for the recipe!!

Made exactly as is. Considering it was a turkey meatloaf, it did lack flavor but still a good alternative. Next time, I'll stick to my usual meatloaf recipe but subbing ground turkey for ground beef and combining the 2 recipes together.

I did not think this would come out good because it was so "gloppy" when I mixed it. I'm glad I was wrong. If you're not worried about calories try this with the "pot roast gravy" on this website (1 pack brown gravy, 1 pack Italian salad dressing, 1 pack Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing, 2 tablespoons of flour, 1 1/2 cups of water). I know it sounds weird but it's absolutely AMAZING...I have to get another slice:) !!

Absolutely the best meatloaf I've ever had.  The quinoa must be the secret ingredient. I used two eggs as per the suggestions of many but I'm not sure it needed two eggs. The meatloaf was very moist and super delicious! It's only myself so I have leftovers. Can't wait!!!

Excellent! I wasn't really sure what to expect but it was pretty fantastic. Had a sprouted rice/quinoa blend I used instead and it was delicious. Scaled back the hot sauce for the kiddo and took another reviewers idea of cooking the quinoa in broth (I did veggie though). Thanks Drew!

I LOVE IT!! This was so good!!! I had to make a few changes since I didn't have all the ingredients on hand... Didn't use any hot sauce. I didn't have tomato paste so I substituted with ketchup, used 2 eggs instead of just one and I added grated Parmesan cheese and I only used ketchup as the topping. I did bake it in a loaf pan and I didn't mind that it wasn't as firm as regular meatloaf. Perfection! Thank you for your recipe Drew! You rock!!

Amazing flavour!  I made no changes to the recipe.  The hardest part was waiting for the loaf to come out of the oven because it smelled SO good while it was cooking.  Moist, delicious, flavourful.  My husband couldn't believe it was turkey because there was so much flavour.  He RAVED over this dish and told me to triple the recipe next time.  I felt like a star and will certainly make this again.  Thanks for posting!

Delicious flavor. I overcooked mine a tad and that, of course, made it dry.  I def suggest using half dark meat to keep moisture.  I used bbq sauce in place of the hot sauce because I had it on hand, it was great!

We didn't change a thing. This is my whole family's favorite meatloaf. It's great leftover too...if there is any left! We've made it probably 20 times now. Our hot sauce brand of choice is Tapatio.

Fantastic recipe! I had never made turkey loaf before; in fact I had never even bought ground turkey, but I will be doing so on a regular basis thanks to this recipe! I used a mixture of white/dark ground turkey, added more garlic, and had to sub ketchup for the tomato paste. Used sriracha for hot sauce, 2 eggs, and only added 1 tsp. of salt. Had to cook for 55 min. before it reached 160. Loved.

I made this using a 48 oz package of 85% lean turkey.  I used barbecue sauce in half and hot sauce in the other half.  I thought both versions tasted fine.  I used 3 eggs & 3/4 cups quinoa for the quantity of meat.  The people who ate it thought it was fine, but didn't choose to have leftovers.  I did eat leftovers, and they were good.  I think people who are fans of turkey meatloaf will enjoy this recipe, but it just wasn't for my household.

Great recipe.  I went with Cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce and used a brown sugar/ketchup topping.  Definitely will make it again.

This was a delicious and healthy meatloaf! My husband and I loved the unique flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, the loaf was a bit crumbly. So next time I will be adding one more egg. The glaze on top was nice! Very creative. Thanks for the great new recipe, I will definitely be making this again.

My very first attempt at meatloaf (turkey or otherwise) ever and it turned out wonderful! I was shopping at TJs so no Worcestershire sauce instead I used the Trader Joe's brand steak sauce ultimately probably making the whole dish a little sweeter. My only hiccup was that the 15-20 minute cooking time for the Quinoa was way too long. I ended up burning it and charing the pan. I ended up doubling the amount I cooked (only using half) -- my saucepan was probably just too big -- and cooking for ten minutes. I will, for sure make this again and enjoy the leftovers this week. Thanks Drew!

First time coming quinoa. Glad I made this recipe. Modified just a tad. My package of ground turkey was only 16 oz. Didn't have tomato paste so I used a tad over tablespoon of surachi (spicy oriental sauce) and tad over tablespoon of catchup. Didn't shape meatloaf to big so it doesn't take very long in oven. I'm thinking about 45 mins.

Thank you for this recipe. I was looking for tips on how to make a flavorful turkey meatloaf. Quinoa is a much more flavorful and nutritious addition than regular breadcrumbs. I used this recipe and basic method as a template for an Asian-inspired teriyaki turkey meatloaf with quinoa, so I can not comment on the exact proportion of spices and ingredients this recipe yields, but the quinoa was a great, nutty, hearty addition to the meat. I used ground white meat turkey because that's what I had. I'm sure a mix of white and dark meat would have been more flavorful, but it was still quite good. The meatloaf looked like a big unappetizing blob with congealed egg liquid all around it when it came out of the oven, but after resting it for 15 minutes and slicing it on a platter, it looked quite  nice. Thank you!

I followed all the directions...i shaped the mixture into a loaf and baked it on a regular baking pan.. But about 15 min into baking, the meatloaf was falling apart and there was a lot of liquid and oil coming out of it.. It was a complete mess.  The mixture was wayyyy too mushy to hold shape.   I had to transfer the meat into a loaf pan.  I'll see how that goes.   Anybody else have the same problem? The only change i had to make was i used 1lb of ground turkey instead of 20 oz (thats how they came in a pkg and i reduced all the other ingredients a little bit) , used ketchup instead of tomato paste since thats what other reviewrs suggested ... But still used 1 egg.

We loved this meatloaf!  It turned out great ... very moist, incredibly dense and best of all, very TASTY!  We had given up eating meatloaf since we are eating much less beef these days, especially hamburger.  Made the recipe without any changes and it was EXCELLENT! My only complaint is the brown sugar topping, which takes what could be a healthy meal and lessens it somewhat.  Will experiment with other healthier toppings.

The best turkey meatloaf.  I used sriracha instead of hot sauce, very good! And not too spicy with one tbs, if you like it hotter I'd add a little more.

I really love this recipe! I cut the onions back to half, and sometimes I use dehydrated onions in lieu of the fresh ones. This is such good comfort food!

Made this recipe last night - instead of tomato paste and hot sauce used equal amount of ketchup as my kids would prefer. Also added ground sage. Turned out wonderfully. For the topping I used my regular brown sugar, ketchup and mustard topping as my family likes it. This was very good, everyone loved it, and I thought it was every bit as good as the beef meatloaf I usually would make.

So easy and very tasty! I used 2eggs and also about 3 tablespoons of the worsteshire sauce for the glaze. It was a hot and everyone said it was better than regular meatloaf. Healthier too!

Really tasty.  Had a hard time forming the loaf.  It wouldn't stay together when I shaped it.  Added 1 extra egg and approximately 1 1/2 cups of Italian breadcrumbs.  It came out of the oven, perfectly moist and didn't fall apart when it was cut.  I'll try again without the breadcrumbs next time since it gets placed in foil.

Really liked this meatloaf! Took the submitter's suggestion and used an extra egg, but it was still too liquidity to form a loaf. Next time I will use more quinoa to firm it up. So, I used a loaf pan upside down over the mess, and removed it to brush with the sweet mixture with about 15 minutes left. The flavour was really really good!

So good. Very spicy loaf from the hot sauce and the nutty flavor from quinoa was awesome. The glaze offset the spciness just enough. Made exactly to the recipe. No changes needed!   Will be making this many more times!

This is one of my least favourite recipes ever from the website.  It was sooo bland (ground turkey with quinoa was really BLAH!!) and the turkey did dry out off the sides of the loaf.  If I was to ever make it again (I won't) I would cook the quinoa in flavourful broth, caramelize the onions (double them) and ... no, still wouldn't be worth saving.

This meatloaf was alright. Easy to make. Didn't blow my socks off, but would probably be better with some sort of gravy.

Made this with the extra egg and BBQ instead of hot sauce, per reviewer suggestions.  Had some fresh parsley on-hand and threw that in too.  Fantastic!

Making this for the second time. Very healthy and delicious. My only change was subbing barbecue sauce for the topping. It is now on our menu rotation.

I made this and added half a green bell pepper that I blended so as to get it passed small children and I didn't use the topping.  Everyone loved it even my grandchildren the four year old and the two year old asked for seconds.  We will. Do this again.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Loved it!  Used leftover spagetti sauce instead of tomato paste & hot pepper sauce and used more on top.  Served with chili sauce on top.

I tried this recipe, and I must say that it's definitely the best meatloaf I've ever had to date hands down! You wouldn't even know that it's not beef... I followed the recipe to a T, except for a few things. 1) You definitely should use more than 1/4 a cup of quinoa. More like 1/2 a cup is perfect. For added flavor, I cooked the Quinoa in Unsalted Chicken Stock! 2) instead of that brown sugar sauce they say to put on top, I used a Honey Teryaki Glaze! 3) 55 minutes @ 350 degrees. Let it cool for 10 minutes and enjoy!

Just tried it...  Awesome!!  No tomato paste..  Used a mustard blend and cheese on top.  I will definitely try this again...  ...will try more quinoa and a higher fat version of ground turkey next time.

I didn't have tomato paste, hot pepper sauce, or Worcestershire, so I used BBQ sauce in place of all three ingredients. I also used 2 eggs, per someone else's review. It turned out great!

This is a wonderful recipe. This was the first meatloaf I ever made and I've been told by my wife that this has to get made again. Don't make the mistake I did though, if you have a little more than 3/4lb of ground turkey make sure you add more quinoa.

As someone with mammalian meat allergy (i.e. no beef/pork/etc), I feared missing out on comfort foods that beef can provide -- however, not anymore. THIS IS AWESOME! My Husband (a beef fanatic) loves this as well! We used an extra tablespoon of tomato paste based on other reviews, and a little extra bbq sauce (no hot sauce, but instead used Rufus Teague's Touch o' Heat bbq sauce). Thanks for sharing this!!

OMG... Best meatloaf EVER. Very delicious. I added sauteed onions, garlic along with chopped mushrooms and shredded zucchini and topped it with a tangy mustard bbq sauce. It was to die for.

Wow!  So yummy!  My family absolutely loved it.  I followed some recommendations and added an extra egg...it wasn't crumbly at all.  I also didn't have hot sauce, so used ketchup instead and added some spicy red pepper.  We like spicy food, so I put half black pepper and half red pepper flakes.  Also, I only used 1 T of brown sugar, and put some tomato paste in the topping.  Still plenty sweet.  With a nice glass of red wine, this is to die for!

Yummy! I made the quinoa with chicken broth and white wine(added a little to the meatloaf also),it definitely enhanced the flavors. Thank you for the advice on not to use a loaf pan-it made a difference in the texture.

I thought this was fantastic. My kids and husband loved it especially the "kick" from the hotsauce. They won't eat quinoa, yet couldn't tell it was in there. I used organic ground turkey. Will definitely make it again.

This is delicious! I make this meatloaf regularly. The only change I make is I use Trader Joe's BBQ sauce to cover the top instead of the mixture in this recipe.

This is so good! I modified the glaze a little since my husband doesn't like sweet glazes, but I kept everything else the same and it turned out great! The flavor was wonderful and the hot sauce was not overpowering. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this 3 times now and have passed on this great receipe to my daughter-in-law and we all love love love it!  Any leftovers get sliced up and wrapped in foil individually for my husband's lunch.   He has a plug in lunchbox that heats up. So much healthier than a sandwich!

I have used this recipe to make meatballs. Instead of 2 eggs I use 1 egg, 1 egg white. I also add 2 TB. of grated Parmesan cheese and  chicken broth instead of H2O . I agree with using all dark meat or 1/2 and 1/2. for added moisture. (Half dark/half white.) For meatballs I cook them for 10 min. turn, then 10-15 min. more. You can use the meatballs for Swedish meatballs, Italian etc. Great for gluten free diets!

I just made this tonight. It was good, but the topping made it very sweet and taste kind of funky. I love the idea of putting quinoa in it. Next time I make it I'll do a different topping that doesn't involve brown sugar.

Delicious and easy to make recipe! Followed the recipe to a T and came out amazing.  The quinoa gave it a wonderful texture that I now MUCH prefer over breadcrumbs. I topped it with some cranberry sauce (whole berry, mixed with a little orange juice).  Perfect!

This was amazingly good! We are just starting to use quinoa, along with saving $ and eating better... this was a perfect way to hit all points. I got ground chick on sale, used 2 pkgs, an extra egg, and topped with a good quality bbq sauce, but otherwise made as directed. The entire family LOVED this and I have enough for a whole other meal. I was surprised that people don't add their own seasoning profiles- I always use more than just salt & pepper. I found this to be flavorful, filling, and soooo good. Try it, I know it sounds scary, but please try it. Good for you and yummy!

This was amazing!! My husband said it's the best meatloaf he's ever had and informed me that I'm making it again, haha. And my 1 year old "vegetarian" son actually ate two servings of it for dinner and some more for lunch the next day (I think it's because it had quinoa in it and he loves the stuff). I changed it up a bit, though - I didn't do the hot sauce, I used ketchup instead of tomato paste, and added some shredded cheddar cheese and liquid smoke. For the topping, I did a Tbsp of brown sugar, 1/4 c. ketchup, a splash of Worcestershire sauce, and a squirt of mustard. Seriously, I'm so happy I found this!

I had Never used Quinoa before or made a meatloaf. Im glad i did. It was soo good! When i cooked the quinoa i put a little bit of chicken bouillon into the water it cooked in. And cut back on the salt, using only 1tsp. The flavor was awsome ,even my picky boyfriend asked for seconds. Great Recipe!!

This was better than I expected!  I don't like much spice, so I cut the pepper sauce down to a tsp, but it was still a bit spicier than we like.  The consistency was great. I baked mine in a self draining meatloaf pan. No issues with it falling apart. I haven't cooked meatloaf for my kids before and they kept asking what it was, but they (14 and 9) ate it with ketchup, of course. :)

I added an extra egg and ground Italian sausage (intentionally) and unintentionally I added a whole can of tomato paste and it was awesome!  Will definitely make again and potentially add cheese.  :)

This was wonderful! A little too spicy for my 3 year old but others loved it. I did use 2 tablespoons of ketchup instead of paste and A1 steak sauce instead of worcestershire just because I didn't have others. Also only had 1 lb of turkey. I will make this again.

I ate it two nights in a row. It wasnt bad, but it wasnt something I oohed and ahhed over. More like well I cooked it and dont want to waste it. The first night I skipped the glaze and topped with mushroom soup but the second day I just wanted it semi cold with ketchup. With ketchup was better for sure. It was just soft and fluffy and bland. Id try again but change it some way.

This meatloaf is very moist and my family loved it!  I was skeptical because meatloaf doesn't have the best reputation. But I had ground turkey that I needed to use and I am so glad I tried this recipe.  It was such a hit I will be making it regularly.  I think I am going to attempt a sauce or gravy to accompany it and serve over mashed potatoes as well.

Ground turkey is all I ever use for cooking instead of ground beef. It makes the best meat loaf. Just started using Quinoa and love the taste and texture. Used it in cookies and vegie burgers this week and will use it in my meat loaf. This recipe is on my list this week. Thanks for posting!

Tried last night and it was a HUGE hit.  Boyfriend went back for seconds and would have done thirds, I'm sure :-)  This made approximately 12 1/2" servings and won't last near as long as I thought it would.  Made it according to the recipe specifications and thought it was great.  My hot sauce could be old, as it didn't have the strong kick most have had a problem with.  Excellent, EXCELLENT recipe!

I don't really care for meatloaf, but this was really quite good. The glaze made the meal! The ends were a little on the dry side, but otherwise it was perfectly moist. I ate it with ketchup and it was delicious! I will definitely make this again and share it!!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight, and I made a few changes for taste -- I substituted a slightly spicy BBQ sauce for the hot sauce to give flavor without heat, and for the glaze I substituted whole grain mustard for half of the brown sugar to enhance the spice in the BBQ sauce without making it too sweet. I also added an extra egg to help it stick together better.

The recipe itself is very delicious, and it won over the whole family (including the picky eaters, young and old). Since I was baking it in an 8x8 pan I took care to drain the fat and juices a couple of times so that the loaf wouldn't come out mushy. However, I still managed to accidentally dump half of the loaf out into the sink when I drained the last bit of the juices. The result was that the dish wasn't too juicy, but it also still fell apart. In the future, I'm going to try variations with rolled oats or partially-cooked quinoa or uncooked quinoa to see if I can overcome the problem of the loaf falling apart in the pan.

Verdict: Great base recipe, definitely worth experimenting with.

I cooked chopped celery and added shredded carrots for some added veg and this was a hit at my house. I cooked it with an added egg, and free formed it on the pan, but it was still a bit crumbly. But this is kinda expected with turkey vs beef.

Thanks for the healthy version of a comfort food! The flavor was wonderful (I was a little generous with the seasonings). I also added a couple more veggies (mushrooms, bell pepper, and carrots). Next time I might add more pepper sauce because I like spicy, lol.  The quinoa added a really good texture! Love it! Will have sandwiches for days!

My whole family liked it. I agree with the author that the quinoa helps "disguise" the taste of the turkey flavor. And the combination of brown sugar with Worcestershire sauce plus the kick from the tabasco were a nice change for my palate.

I loved making this receipe, I added some additonal ingredients on top of everything listed.. I did find that after mixing all the ingredients that it was very moist as noted in receipe and not easy to make into a loaf. In the the sautee pan with onion I added equal amounts of green pepper and fresh campari tomatoes. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of fennel seed, fresh ground sea salt and black pepper. In the bowl with turkey I added 1 tsp of fresh thyme and an extra egg like one of the other reviews did. I also cubed up a small amount of goat cheese brie and mixed that in. I used ketchup instead of tomato paste. I used tapatio for pepper sauce. The only other thing I did was add 1 1/2 tbsp of ketchup in the sauce made for drizzling over the top.  I would recommend putting the loaf in a pan with edges as this has a lot of liquid.  I decided to cook my loaf in waterless cookware on the stove top for 30 mins instead of the oven. It came out perfect.The flavor was out of this world. By far the best meatloaf I have ever made. My sweetie said it was great. I will definitely be making this again.

I only gave it 4 stars due to modifications based on previous reviews, but overall a very good recipe!  Based on the reviews, I only used 1/2 Tbs of Chipoltle Tabasco and used 1/2 Tbs of Chipoltle barbecue sauce due to not wanting it to be too hot for my parents.  Also based on previous reviews, I reduced the salt to 1 tsp.  Oh, for some smokiness, I added 1/2 a teaspoon of liquid smoke.  It seemed too moist, so I also added 3 teaspoons of bread crumbs.  The glaze was a little too sweet, so I think next time I will either do just ketchup or barbecue sauce on top.

This was a big hit at my house! My son is allergic to beef, and meatloaf has been off the menu, but not anymore! I did reduce the hot sauce, though. Don't like spicy.

Yum!!! I've been wanting to try this one for awhile, but my husband isn't a fan of quinoa, so I hadn't until now. I made it and waited until he tried it and liked it before telling him what was in it! He had no complaints! I didn't have tomato paste, so used ketchup and we don't like spicy, so I used BBQ sauce instead of hot sauce, as suggested by another reviewer. I also added about a cup of shredded marble cheese, also as suggested by another! Will definitely make this again!

This recipe was a hit with my hubby who is a major meatloaf fan, but isn't too wild about turkey meatloaf.  I made a few adjustments since I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I used A-1 steak sauce and soy sauce in place of Worcestershire, ketchup instead of tomato paste, mixed the onion and garlic right in without cooking first, stuck with old fashion ketchup for topping since I didn't have brown sugar, and used 2 eggs.  I even sent it for lunch with my 3 year old the next day.  The container came back empty.  My 2 year old on the other hand wouldn't touch it, but that's not saying much since he won't eat most things unless it's covered with breading.

This was amazing!!
Moist and flavorful and cooked to perfection easy peasy!!
I cut the hot sauce in half as other reviewers suggested and was glad I did, still had a bit of a kick but didn't overpower the AMAZING taste. It didn't need any kind of sauce or seasoning once cooked (although I used ketchup to draw 'laces' on my football shaped loaf and that was a nice little addition).
The recipe calls for 1.25 lbs of ground turkey, I used ground chicken because that's what I accidently grabbed from the store... I had to get 2 1lb packages but next time will just use 1lb and hopefully it will be just as good.
MMMmMMmMMmMmm!!!

Great Recipe, that I've made many times for friends and family. Two changes that I always make is 1) delete the pepper sauce. 2) Use the Italian style herbs added ground turkey that is found in most super markets. I find it makes for a well balanced spicy taste that is not overpowered by peppers.

I loved it, I've never free formed a meatloaf before, that was fun. Next time I may skip the glaze, we are not used to or a fan of the sweet but it was not overpowering, it was simply delicious. The heat was perfect. A+ I had a lb of ground Turkey left and wanted to experiment, I had all the ingredients in hand. (-:

My husband who isn't a huge fan of meatloaf...let alone turkey-meatloaf, LOVED this recipe! The quinoa gives the loaf a nice meaty texture without making it too heavy. I made it once, following the recipe exactly and again adding extra veg (peppers/mushrooms). Thumbs up on both counts from me and my husband!

I made this with teriyaki sauce and it was awesome! I added some sauce to the meat mixture, a little freshly grated ginger and green onions and for the paste on top I still used the brown sugar but also mixed in a little more of the teriyaki sauce. Great base recipe looking forward to adding more flavors to this and experimenting!

I tried a version of this recipe last night and it really was the juiciest turkey meatloaf I have ever eaten! I read every single review and took some notes,added 2 eggs,omitted the extra salt,cooked my quinoa in plain water& salt free Mrs.Dash,switched half of the Worcestershire sauce to ketchup,changed the glaze into tomato paste,BBQ sauce&a bottled sauce from Costco. Bottom line is, the proportions were right on target& anyone can make this their own!My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it,thanks!!!

Made it tonight and it turned out very well.  I agree with another reviewer who said it had a beef-like consistency. It really was similar to a typical beef meatloaf.  I wrapped it with turkey bacon and instead of the brown sugar topping I just used some BBQ sauce on top to make it easy.  This was also my first experience with quinoa.  Glad it was a positive one!  This one is a keeper!

I loved this meatloaf!  The only change that I made from the original recipe was that I used chicken broth to cook the quinoa and I used ketchup instead of tomato paste.  I don't think I will ever make a ground beef meatloaf again!  Also, great the next day as a sandwich!

This was amazing! I used ketchup instead of tom. paste  and omitted the hot sauce.  I was out of brown sugar so used BBQ sauce on top.  If my husband knew this was turkey & quinoa he would not have touched it~so I didn't tell him.  He ate two helpings and raved about his leftover sandwich today!

My husband is on a very restricted diet and needs more grains - this fits the bill! It was delicious, and I really appreciate the help in meeting his dietary goals. Thanks for posting.

Delicious! I didn't have quinoa so I replaced it with panko bread crumbs and it came out great! I'll have to try to quinoa next time.

I've been pretty disappointed with meatloafs lately but this was fantastic.  Very moist and a ton of flavor.  My four-year-old found it a little spicy but it was spot on for my wife and I.  Next time we might try using Lite Salt to cut down on the sodium content and use a little less Tabasco for my son.

This is an excellent recipe! I can't eat gluten, so I can't eat most meatloaf because of the breadcrumbs, but I actually like it much better with the quinoa. It stays much moister than most meatloaf. Only change is to add 2 eggs, as other reviewers suggested.

MY kids can't get enough of this meatloaf.  I have made it 4 times already.  The Turkey and the quinoa make for lighter and fluffier texture than a traditional meatloaf

We loved this (picky kids included).  I only used 1 lb of ground turkey and did add the extra egg.  I had no problem with it falling apart.  Will definitely make again.

I've never liked meatloaf but my husband loves it. Made this using 2 eggs and 2 cloves of garlic and added tomato paste on top.... SO DELICIOUS!!! I loved the added quinoa and my husband said he couldn't tell it was turkey :) This will become a house favorite!

Still Looking for a good turkey meatloaf. This was okay but nothing special. No one in my family went back for seconds which is always an indicator of how much they like it.

So delicious!  My husband said we should make this once a month at least.  We followed the recipe for the most part, with a few tweaks:
We added an extra egg like others recommended, and chopped up red bell pepper and sauteed with onion (step 3).  Also put about a tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese over cooled onion/pepper mixture.  We used a little Frank's hot sauce since I can't take the heat.  Turned out amazing.
We served the meatloaf with smashed potatoes (Pinterest) and sauteed broccoli.

Very tasty.  I added an extra egg, replaced the hot sauce with bbq sauce.  If making it again, I would double the bbq sauce.  I would also double the glaze and use it an extra drizzle.

Excellent! We all loved this, next time will double to make two.  Used cooked Texmati brown rice instead of quinoa (didn't have quinoa). I did use a half tbsp hot sauce, 2 eggs, one tsp salt, half tsp pepper (sons prefer less spice).  Will make again!

I made this meatloaf exactly like the recipe specifies. I did not change a thing. I was disappointed; the meatloaf had almost no taste. I guess I will go back to red meat for my meatloaf.

Flavor was yummy...I  made it just like the recipe said however and it was to crumbly.  Next time I will add an extra egg.  I also only had a chipotle hot sauce on hand and used that, I think it really added a great flavor.

Nice recipe, thank you. I took the advice of other reviewers and added a second egg, replaced the hot sauce with some BBQ sauce and made sure to cook it on a baking sheet. I also added a handful of craisans to the mix. My wife and I enjoyed the end result, finding the loaf to be relatively light.

Great recipe! Addressed all the issues I've had with traditional meatloaf.
This is so light, moist, and flavorful, seems a shame to call it meatloaf.

I'd all but given up on turkey meatloaf, always dry and tasteless, but decided to give this one a try. I was pleasantly surprised. This meatloaf is moist, flavorful and just all around tasty. I love it!

I made this in a mini loaf pan (12 minis) and it was delish.  I used lean ground beef and 1 recipe made 12 nice mini meatloaves.  Next time I would top it with BBQ sauce instead of the Worcestire paste.

This is a great recipe for a low fat alternative to ground beef meat loaf!  The flavor is spot on.  My 12yr old was shocked when i said it was turkey, and my wife is not a fan of quinoa "by its self" but she said that it was really good in this dish.  I find the hot sauce addition really needs to be to error on the side of caution less is more for heat sensitive people.  Wonderful recipe my new favorite!

I doubled this recipe to make two...I was glad I did, it was great sliced cold the next day over salad!....I added 2 tbsp. of tomato paste to the sauce to top the loaf though....I like meatloaf with sauce dripping off the sides, so that whatever I serve it with will soaks it all up. (mashed cauliflower and green beans in my case).

Very good flavor. Ate it with white rice and ketchup of course. Does "hot pepper sauce" refer to Tabasco? I used Tapatio and it was great, not too spicy.

What a wonderful meatloaf!  I like quinoa anyway, but have always had a hang-up about the texture of ground turkey.  The combination solves the problem.  As someone else suggested, based on personal preference,  I subbed barbecue for most of the hot sauce (added just  a dash for some zing).  The flavor/ texture were good enough to pass the test w/ a friend who likes neither ground turkey nor usually these weird things I come up with to cook!  Definitely a keeper.

I had to make an account just to complement this recipe, all I can say is WOW. This is a masterpiece. Definitely not as binding as your average meatloaf...but this is no average dish. With that being said, I had no problems with excess crumbling. I did use 2 EGGS as opposed to 1 (as suggested by the mastermind) so that may have been a contributing factor. Also, I recommend making a double batch of the Worcestershire/brown sugar rub, it was to die for. Will definitely be making again and again.

Absolutely delicious. I wouldn't change a thing! Very moist and flavorful. I've made this several times and it is loved by my entire family. An excellent alternative to beef and much healthier.

Absolutely loved it!!!  This will become a regular in my family. I added two shredded carrots, 1/8 cup bread crumbs and one additional egg.  Plus I topped with three tablespoons of my favorite spicy/sweet BBQ sauce.

AMAZING!!! Just made this tonight. Not only it is the best meatloaf I have ever made, it was the best meatloaf I have ever had! I did a couple very slight modifications. I added an extra egg, about a quarter cup to half a cup of breadcrumbs to bind the mixture, and instead of tomato paste I used ketchup as I noticed most people did that as well. My husband went back for seconds it was so good! The topping really added a burst of flavour. Even my 2 year old ate it, and it is difficult to get him to eat anything these days! Didn't seem to have any issues with this dish! I know he is getting the healthy quinoa and the turkey, so it made me feel good as a Mom! I found the meatloaf to be moist and didn't lack any taste in the least! It was bursting with flavour. I will make this over and over again, only difference is I would double the batch so we can eat more of it!!

This was so amazing! I added fresh parsley, bell pepper, mushrooms and didnt have hot sauce so I used tiger sauce. Served it up atop pureed cauliflower and it was a true winner, even the baby loved it! I always have quinoa on hand for baby food and never buy bread crumbs which is why I chose this recipe. One reviewer mentioned it added no flavor and its not supposed to, it just acts as a binder and has more nutritional value than bread crumbs.

Delicious!  Our entire family loved it.  We did not make the topping because we are not consuming sugar right now and it was flavorful and delicious without it.  Possibly the best ground turkey recipe we've tried.  Thanks!

Of all the meatloaf recipes I've tried, this one came out exceptional. Although I didn't have all the ingredients and had to "adapt" from experience it was superb. What I did have was left over quinoa which added a a nice nutty flavor in place of the rice I usually use. From now on, it's quinoa!

Great, but cook time is WAY too long. I cook it for 30-35 min. I also add just two or three slices of bacon laid across the top so that the juices are absorbed by the loaf, keeping in moist.

A refreshing take on regular old meatloaf. It is lighter in texture and lower in fat. Very moist and tasty. Even hubby and 9-yr-old give it a thumbs-up!

We loved this recipe. I did it just like it was written and it turned our perfect! Am forwarding it on to friends. I might add some red pepper next time but it is really good!
Update, red pepper is always added now. We eat it cold in sandwiches and make it once a month! So glad I came across this recipe! Remember shape it into a loaf on parchment lined cookie sheet to bake.

This was a great recipe! I didn't have worcestershire sauce, so I substituted soy sauce, and it turned out really good.  I also added a little bit of cheddar cheese.  I was out of hot sauce, but it still tasted great.

My new favorite meatloaf! I have had this recipe for over a year and was hesitant to try it because of the negative reviews.  I really struggled with how to procede: should I try the recipe as written which is my preference or heed the advice of reviewers?  I decided to try it as written and after reading several complaints about the amount of hot pepper sauce, I deceased the hot pepper sauce by half.  My young kids can't handle too much spice anyway.  This was the right choice for us.  I could still taste the hot pepper sauce but it didn't overpower.  I also used Frank's hot sauce which is milder than Tobassco and I can see how a full 2T. of Tobassco would make someone say "woo doggies!".  Anyway, we loved it!  Even my health-food averted husband said it was great.

Great flavor, great texture, quick and easy.  Love the quinoa.  People that say it was too spicy, don't use such spicy hot sauce. If it's a hot sauce you like, the spiciness is just right.  The recipe is good, and easy to clean up with the tin foil.  I used Sriracha as the hot sauce and it was good.  Thanks for a nice recipe!

I have made this recipe so many times, and for good reason! It is so quick and easy to make. I use two eggs and form a loaf on a cookie sheet rather than using a loaf pan so the moisture can bake off, and it has always turned out great. I love to eat it with oven roasted sweet potatoes and homemade tzatziki. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Made it for my wife who hates meatloaf.  It was a huge hit! She absolutely loved it!! I did make some changes in the recipe: I used egg whites instead of whole eggs to cut the cholesterol and only 1/2 teaspoon of salt for lower sodium and that's it!  
I'm quite sure I will be making this often!!   Thanks Drew!!

I LOVE this recipe!  I made it for the second time tonight and my two girls (ages 5 and 7) have devoured it both times!  The only thing I did different was add a little tomato paste to the sauce on top (figured it couldn't hurt since you usually use ketchup on top) and added a few more seasonings.  This is definitely a keeper!

Delicious!  I used 2 eggs instead of 1.  I also used Splenda brown sugar instead of the real thing.  It was a little messy to put together but cooked up great!  My husband loved it too!  This recipe is a keeper!

Unbelievably good, especially for something involving ground turkey and quinoa.  I halved the hot pepper (aka Tabasco) sauce after reading some of the reviews and it came out perfect.  Even my 11-month-old loved it (and could eat it!).

Love this turkey meatloaf. I leave out the hot pepper sauce because I don't do spicy but otherwise it's great as is. This is the only meatloaf I make anymore.

This was so good. I followed some commenter recommendations and used bbq sauce instead of hot sauce. My boyfriend didn't know it wasn't beef and he certainly didn't know it had quinoa in it! Next time I might try adding the extra egg because it did fall apart slightly while slicing but otherwise this will become a regular recipe for me.

This has become one of my regular dishes and the family loves it! I make a double recipe and still it's gone way too fast. I even wrote the recipe down in my personal cookbook in case of technical difficulties. the only change i make is to double the sauce on top. I do recommend using a silicone mat under it so that you have easier pan cleanup.

I really liked this and so did my family. As per another suggestion I substituted BBQ sauce for the hotsauce because we have small kids. I also upped the brown sugar in the sauce to 3 Tbsp and added 1.5 Tbsp of tomato paste. I've made this a couple of times now and will make it again.

I loved this meatloaf! I used ground chicken instead of turkey and it was my first time cooking with quinoa. I followed the poster's suggestion and used 2 eggs and although I used a little extra chicken and onions, it was still too wet and mushy. I wasn't even able to form a loaf. Eventually I just added another 1/4 cup of quinoa and that helped. It was still mushy but I was able to form the loaf. I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce because that was all I had. Next time I would add extra for more zing. I may also add a bit more spices but it is  fine as is. I cooked it a little longer so it was slightly brown on top and it turned our wonderfully. I prefer it to regular meatloaf. Thanks for posting Drew!

This is an amazing recipe that I make time after time.  I've used couscous and a whole wheat rice blend in place of quinoa and both versions are awesome.  It's very flavorful.  I also add a little sharp cheddar in the mix as well.

This recipe was excellent.  My grandson just kept saying "ummm" and my husband asked me to save it.  It was easy to make and easy to clean up after.  Healthy and tasting good.. two of my favorite things in a recipe.

Not exactly sure why I tried this as my family has never really cared for meatloaf, but we'd never had a meatloaf like this. This was excellent! The fact it's likely much more healthy than a more standard meatloaf is just a bonus. No leftovers between the 3 of us and I'd even burned it a little by getting the oven temps mixed up with some roasted potatoes in our dual oven. Thank you for sharing, this will likely be a regular at our dinner table.

I also used 2 eggs instead of one, and more like 1/2 cup of quinoa instead of 1/4 cup. Definitely needs to be molded on a flat cooking sheet rather than using a loaf pan as a previous reviewer wrote, because there are a LOT of fat drippings that would have made for a really gross mess in a loaf pan. I did make the glaze and thought it was perfect, although I would recommend making twice as much as described to really get the loaf covered with it. Loved the hot sauce ingredient, big fan of that. My husband loved this... Would recommend making double the recipe if cooking for more than 2-3 people. Tasted DELICIOUS!

This is literally the first time I have ever felt compelled to leave a review for a recipe.  I have made this 5 times now since originally downloading it.  It's a delicious recipe that served us well on this snowy evening.  Because I am sometimes a bit scattered I have come up with a couple of modifications for if you want to make this but have failed to buy onions:
1. Cut up one apple into 1 cm cubes and fry with the garlic. Add to recipe in place of onions.
2. Chop one 10 oz container of mushrooms, sautee for 5-10 minutes in olive oil till soft, add garlic and cook 2 mins, deglaze pan with balsamic or red wine vinegar. Add to recipe in place of onions.  This was a little lacking in moisture compared to the original recipe and the apple idea, room for improvement.
3. (Not onion related) I added some ginger poweder to the glaze, turned out well.

I thought this was just okay.  I cut the hot sauce down for my kids and still found it to be too spicy.  Maybe I will try again with BBQ sauce instead as some other reviews suggested.

I made this last night and it was a huge hit! I do agree with CC(loves)2bake's observation that the hot sauce overwhelmed the recipe, and I even used only half a tablespoon instead of a full one (I am not a fan of spicy food). I can't imagine what it would've been like had I used the full amount! My boyfriend on the other had LOVED it (he likes a spicier dish) and said it was definitely something we "need" to make again. A very successful and tasty creation, Drew. Many thanks for posting it!!

I cooked the quinoa in low-sodium chicken broth, added 1/2 cup green bell pepper and cut the salt to 1 teaspoon.  My entire family loved it.

For turkey meatloaf, this was REALLY good.  I had trouble getting it to form a "loaf" though, it was more of a meat pile.  I even added an extra egg to help hold it all together.  But it still tasted great!  Will definitely make again.

I made this for the first time a couple of months ago, and loved it. I've got this meatloaf in the oven right now too! 
I don't like ground turkey, but I like ground chicken, and it works great in this recipe. Tonight I didn't have any "rooster" sauce, so I used hickory smoke BBQ sauce instead, and I also added chopped fresh parsley, just because I love parsley. 
What a great recipe this is to use quinoa in too! YUM

This came out GREAT! I added some chopped mushrooms with the sauteed onions, and I added a few squirts of bbq sauce into the mixture. I also added maybe 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar. My quinoa needed about twice as much water as listed to cook. I mixed brown sugar and ketchup and put on top instead of the listed topping. Once put together, it was awesome!

Excellent recipe! I wanted to make meat loaf but I didn't have any bread crumbs and then ta-dah! I found this brillant recipe here. It was fantastic. I also didn't have any brown sugar or tomato paste so I used ketchup and coconut aminos and it was fantastic! Thanks

I rarely comment on recipes - but this was nothing short of excellent!  One of the best Meat Loafs (turkey, beef, or otherwise).  We doubled the recipe and made with two lbs of turkey (also added some chopped mushrooms to the onions) and it turned out perfectly.  Well done!

Oh.My.Gosh. This was delicious! If anything at all I would change, it would be double the brown sugar glaze for the top. It was lick your fingers good. Awesome with some roasted veggies, and mashed potatoes.

The topping is pretty boring. I think I will make a more classic ketchup based one next time. Needs more spices too.

Wanted so badly to love this... Came out watery and fell apart on me. Was still edible, but not something I'd try again. Still searching for a good turkey meatloaf! :(

For a really healthy alternative to the traditional meatloaf mix, this is pretty good.  I used Frank's hot sauce  The flavor was mild and the texture was a little soft.  It was plenty moist, and it browned well enough considering how little fat it had.  But I don't care much for quinoa, and its texture and flavor were too prominent for me.

This was DELICIOUS!  I will definitely be making this again.  A few changes I made were ketchup for tomato paste, no hot sauce, soy sauce for worcestershire, 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 c ketchup for topping.  And I used a 12 cup muffin tin at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.  I served with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.  My whole family loved it.  Thanks!

Well, this turned out quite dry.  And very peppery.  I used bbq sauce rather than hot sauce.  Could have done with more topping tool.

Very good. Didn't taste like turkey! I added 1/4 cup of dehydrated onions for extra flavor and it was delicious.  Will definitely make again.

I left out the hot sauce to make it a bit more family friendly.  I also accidentally bought & used italian style tomato paste, which was very good.  It was a hit!

Served with "Yukon Cauliflower Mash".  Great combination!

This has become one of my favorite recipes. I used to make meatloaf about once a year (at the most!). This meatloaf is so tasty. The quinoa keeps it moist. I also use Frank's Red Hot Sauce instead of a spicy hot sauce which can be overpowering. Instead of brown sugar, I use two packets of Splenda to keep the calories/sugar down. I started a diet 3-1/2 months ago and was looking for a healthier way of cooking. Replacing ground turkey for beef I thought would be kind of tasteless but it isn't. Last night I made it with cauliflower/potato mash. Since I had leftover meatloaf and potatoes I made a shepherds pie with the leftovers. Normally I make a meatloaf parmesan which tastes like a giant meatball covered in reduced fat mozzarella and marinara. It also makes a great meatloaf sandwich. Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

I have the world's pickiest eaters in my house.   I decided to serve this to my family last night and see how it went over.  My husband actually said that he prefers this to a beef meatloaf.  I was shocked!  
I didn't have a lot of the ingredients on hand, so I improvised a bit on the spices, but it's really the quinoa that makes this recipe.  I love the texture of this loaf.  It will definitely become a staple in our meal rotations.  Thanks!

i am NOT a fan of turkey, but I gave this a try because I had left over quinoa. Boy was I surprised! I really like meatloaf, but I think I liked this more than "regular" meatloaf. My 3 yr old loved it and was begging for more! I was very skeptical before I baked it because the raw texture was so mushy, but it baked beautifully. Yum! Will definitely make again!

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was fantastic.  Very moist for a turkey loaf. My husband didn't realize it was made out of turkey because it was so juicy.

I used 85% ground turkey and baked it in a pan. The only issue I encountered was the fat rising to the top and covering the entire loaf. Easy enough to spoon off, but my next attempt will be in a different dish so the fat falls off to the side. Used Frank's hot sauce with delicious results!

We have made this quite a few times at home & we love that it takes what you'd think of as bland ground turkey meat and has a bit of spice & a kick to it.  I also love cooking with quinoa in every way possible!

I found this recipe outstanding!  My husband and 2 older children are EXTREMELY picky due to sensory processing diorder and they all like/dislike different foods so it is very difficult to feed the people in my home!  They all LOVED this meatloaf!  I cooked it a little bit more than the 50 minutes to guarantee a firmer texture but the taste was still awesome!  The only substitute I made was I used ketchup for tomato paste since I didn't have that on hand and I did not use the hot sauce.  This is now my go-to recipe for meatloaf!

This is the best meatloaf recipe I have even found. My husband loves it. I even like it and I don't care for meatloaf that much. I use one of those meatloaf pans with the lift out piece, so all the liquids drain off the meat. I also broil the top for the last few minutes to get a good crunchy sweet topping. Delicious!

This meatloaf is great! I'm giving 4/5 stars for the original recipe because I think the hot pepper sauce and black pepper amounts need to be halved- the amount called for overwhelms the other flavors, I think. I'm making this again tonight with half of the amount called for and I expect it to be a 5 star recipe! Make sure to NOT use ground turkey breast- it is too dry. A lean, 93% fat free ground turkey does the trick without sacrificing the health benefits.

I have used this several times over the past year and really enjoy something different.  

If you lessen the worsteshire and add a ketchup/mustard/brown sugar topping the kids will enjoy it as well!

This meatloaf was really yummy!  I added the extra egg like other reviews had said to do and the meatloaf held together very nicely!  The hot pepper sauce adds a nice kick to it although i may hold back next time due to others thinking it was too spicy

This is an excellent meatloaf recipe for those looking for an alternative to breadcrumbs.  Even my husband said that this recipe was a "keeper".

We LOVE this!  I just made it again tonight and it's in our regular rotation.  It's great as-is.  

There are a few things you can play with, if you like.  I have added garlic powder, thawed frozen spinach & a small amount of parmesan cheese.  Next time I may try adding some diced carrots.  You can make small adjustments and it is always fabulous!!!

I've had bad luck with meatloaf recipes in the past. This one came out firm and *really* tasty. I fully intend to make it again the next time I want meatloaf, and there isn't another recipe that can make that claim!

This was my first attempt at a "lighter" meatloaf and it did not let me down! I read the reviews and made just a couple alterations I added an extra egg and instead of the hot sauce I added a low cal BBQ sauce. Instead of just salt and pepper I used Montreal steak seasoning cuz I wanted it to taste like a "real" meatloaf.  I've already shared with friends and will definitely make this part of my repitiore

Wow! This is the best meatloaf I have ever had! Pay attention to how it's cooked too. I almost put it in a meatloaf pan like I usually do but decided to try it just as the recipe instructs. So glad I did!

Excellent. Made this with 36oz of Turkey, half thigh/half breast meat, increased the other ingredients a bit, still used only one egg and 1/4 cup (uncooked) quinoa. Still worked great. Also, added bacon to the top of the loaf, right on top of the brown sugar topping. Went with the other ingredients very well. Plan on making this again in the future.

I would have given this a 5 because it was moist and delicious but the brown sugar mixture on top was unnecessary. It made it too sweet and meatloaf, in my opinion, should not be sweet!

I gave this recipe a try and added chopped spinach, celery and mushrooms to this recipe, I didn't have tomatoe paste handy.  I cooked the quinoa in low sodium vebetable broth and I reduced by simmering down a can of V8, in place of the tomato paste.  I added the celery, mushrooms and spinach to the onion and pre-cooked them along with it.
Also added dried Jalipeno peppers and some chili powder to it. ;)

Very easy recipe - I made it with chicken instead of turkey and it came out moist and flavourful.  A nice healthly alternative to beef meatloaf.  It has a sweet and savoury flavour.  Very good.

3 stars as written, 5 stars with a few minor changes: no hot sauce, 2 eggs, and only 1/2 tsp salt. I also prefer a simple brown sugar/ketchup/mustard/Worcestershire blend for the glaze. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the hot sauce overwhelms the rest of the ingredients. Better to have it on the table to add as people want for their individual servings. Soo tasty without!!

This meatloaf is fabulous!  I made this exactly as stated but added an extra egg after reading reviews.  It was REALLY good!  I consider myself only an average cook and this was easy and delicious.  I do my best to eat clean as much as possible and this recipe fits the bill- can't go wrong with finding a way to make ground turkey and quinoa taste so good!  My boyfriend doesn't even like meatloaf and even he raved!  THANKS for the great recipe- this will be going in my permanent file!

This was the most delicious ground turkey meatloaf I have ever had or made.  I did use 2 tblsp chili sauce in place of the tomato paste and hot pepper sauce but my, was this delicious and moist.  Even the picky husband loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I want to thank you for an interesting recipe. I did have to do some modifying for my friend that can not eat tomatoe products, pepper of any kind, or vinegar which is in the Worcestershire sauce. This was a great recipe. Thanks again.

This meatloaf is fantastic.  I love recipes for turkey that improve the flavor of the ground turkey (which I don't think is the greatest).  Well, this one does that.  I actually enjoy it more than the meatloaf I usually make with meat (and my family loves!)  My daughter loves this turkeyloaf and I am passing it to a friend and will definitely keep it in my favorites.  I made it "as is" and loved it.

Very good! Just as awesome as a leftover. I was thinking of putting in some chopped jalapenos and backing off the hot sauce a bit only to add a bit of color/interest in the loaf. Maybe my oven was a bit hot because it was ready a good 5 minutes less than required.

We love turkey and quinoa at our house but we did not like this meatloaf. It crumbled too much for us. We like a meatloaf that you have to cut with your fork and can then eat with a fork. This recipe gave us a "spoon eating" meatloaf.

I made this for my brother, who is a very particular eater, just last night and it was literally the best meat loaf I have ever made! Great recipe! The Quinoa added some much more than plain old boring bread crumbs. I made one change by not adding the brown sugar and Worcestershire to the top but instead just brushed a couple of tablespoons of ketchup for the topping! I will definitely be making this one again! And my brother even took some to work for lunch, so it must have been good!

Enjoyed this recipe. A little difficult finding the quinoa--finally did in the health food secion at Publix. Used 1/2 T hot sauce and 1/2 T BBQ sauce to cut down on the heat. Sightly dry, next time I'll check the internal temp at 40 then 45 min. Will definitely make this often. In the meantime, can't wait for meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow. Thanks Drew :)  **StephD, perhaps the spice you think may be missing is SAGE.  I've always used 1 teaspoon in meatloaves I've made in the past...

Love, love, LOVE this recipe! This has become a staple dinner for us over the past year. My husband and 2 kids both love it, which doesn't happen very often. I make it exactly as the recipe says and it has always come out so good. I usually use 93/7 turkey and it is always so moist. My husband usually makes a meatloaf sandwich the next day for lunch with a couple of slices, carmelized onions and a little ketchup. Thank you so much for posting this!!

Adding to the family recipe book!  I rarely follow a recipe to the dot.  My variations include the following:  added 1 carrot, 3 green onions, 1 tomato all diced.  I like color and this added a more interesting look, texture and flavor.  I also mixed the Worcestershire and brown sugar in addition to the top.  Also, I broiled the loaf for a more appealing color.  I did not include the tomato paste.  I felt it didn't need it after I mixed the the sauce and sugar within.  Kids and hubby enjoyed it, so it was a win win!!!

I really liked this recipe.  I have probably only made meatloaf a couple of times in my life because it always turns out like, well, a hunk of meat.  I love quinoa and am always looking for new ways to use it.  It gave this meatloaf a really great texture and broke up the "meatiness" of it.  
Very moist and flavorful too.  My only changes were that I used ketchup because I didn't have tomato paste, I threw in a little Italian seasoning, and omitted the salt.
I would definitely recommend this recipe!

Excellent! Thank you Drew for your clarifying comment.  I added 1 egg and did NOT put it in a loaf pan. Only other thing was I added some celery and omitted onions.  This was our first all turkey recipe to get praise from the whole family. Usually I mix turkey with beef.  Thanks again will be making this often.

This is a surprisingly good meatloaf.  I followed it exactly as written (only doubled).  I think we are just used to meatloaf with the traditional tomato sauce on top.  The next time I make this I'll try adding that and I'm sure it will send it over the top.  The texture and taste was great.  I especially liked the addition of the hot sauce.  It gave it the needed flavor boost.

Delicious meatloaf, wonderful flavor, I'm shocked that it's made with ground turkey! My daughter always hated meatloaf because she hated ground beef, and I never liked ground turkey because the texture seemed mushy.  But we both thought this was scrumptious and with good texture; I can't believe it's not beef! (I cut the hot sauce amount in half, and that was just perfect for us, and didn't put any topping on the meat either). Thanks for an amazing recipe!

I happened to be looking for a recipe with ingredients I had at home and voila!  I had all the ingredients for this, I love love love to use quinoa, as it is the perfect grain!  This meatloaf was excellent.  I added extra hot sauce and garlic and gave it even more flavor, Next time I will double the glaze recipe and add additional half after baking.  Otherwise it's perfect.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe!  Super easy to throw together and even the husband enjoys it (he's wary of "weird" stuff like quinoa, lol).  I make it as directed, though if I'm feeling lazy I'll just brush the top with regular bbq sauce from a bottle.  Freezes well too...it's the perfect entree!

AMAZING!!!  Absolutely loved this... served it to my mister who RAVED about the flavor.  Used a topping that was posted by another reviewer that called for much more brown sugar and ketchup since it was more like how I remember it being like when I was little...   Bottom line, if you're not planning on making this for dinner you're missing out!!!

This recipe was great. My roommate who doesn't like meatloaf even liked it. I made a few changes to the recipe. I used ground chicken instead of turkey. I cooked the quinoa in low sodium chicken broth to add more flavour and I used organic tomato paste and doubled it. I'm sure the original recipe would be good as is but this suited my tastes better.

This recipe is perfect, even for someone who hasn't made a meatloaf in 15 years - that is how unsuccessful I have been.  I cooked my quinoa with some beef boillion in the water and subbed the BBQ for the hot sauce as others recommended.  The flavor was great and IT STAYED TOGETHER!  I will make this once a week for awhile because the sandwiches are delicious the nedt day.  Thanks.

Made it for the boys and they had no idea it was remotely healthful!  The quinoa adds a great density and flavor, though I'd add a bit more since I ended up using a bit of panko to thicken it up.  I'd also add a bit more tomato paste for flavor, otherwise - great recipe!

Loved it.  The quinoa gives the meatloaf a really nice, light texture.  I agree that the 1 Tbsp of hot pepper sauce seemed a bit much, so I reduced it to 1 tsp.  More would have made it too spicy for my kids.

This was so good!!! They only thing I changed was using bbq sauce rather than the hot pepper sauce like another reviewer had done because I didn't have any hot sauce. The next time I have to make a dish for a potluck or some other gathering I will definitely be making this!

We love this recipe! My son is allergic to wheat so I love the quinoa in this recipe. Since he's allergic to eggs as well we usually replace the eggs with half cup of apple sauce or pumpkin purée. I also omit the worsherster sauce and use more ketchup instead. The whole family loves this.

This meatloaf is very good!  I love using quinoa (which contains more protein than any other grain) instead of cracker or bread crumbs.  The Worcestershire sauce gives it lots of flavor.  I definitely will be making this one again!

We really enjoyed this recipe made just as instructed.  I will probably use a different recipe for the paste on top next time because this one wasn't as flavorful as we're used to, but overall, great recipe.

Somehow I managed to miss the directions to mix the last three separately as a rub for the meatloaf. Instead I mixed all the ingredients in together and it was awesome! I also used grass fed beef instead of ground turkey, but that didn't matter...it was so tasty. My husband loved it. Served with yukon gold mashed potatoes from this site and steamed broccoli. Highly recommend!

This recipe was great!  I was a little hesitant because I'm kind of a classic meatloaf kind of person, but it turned out awesome.  The only changes that I made were adding about a tablespoon and a half of brown sugar to the meatloaf mixture and i doubled the sauce and added some ketchup to it.  Everyone loved it....I will be making this one again!

I just made this meatloaf today and it really exceeded my expectations. I used 97% fat free turkey and it still turned our super moist. I did cut down on the hot sauce (by half) and did not find it to be spicy at all. Next time I make it I will add a full teaspoon of hot sauce. What makes this meatloaf great is that it's healthy without tasting like it.

Adding quinoa instead of breading is a great way to make this healthier.  Tastes great!

I'll admit I was skeptical about the quinoa- but it was actually very good and the texture worked. I think this has become my new go-to over beef meatloaf. My husband LOVES my standard meatloaf and he agrees. I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn't crazy about the glaze. Like others I used a ketchup/brown sugar/mustard powder glaze instead. I also added extra garlic and some chopped Italian parsley. If the glaze were a little different I'd give it 5.

Seriously this is the best meatloaf I've ever had! I made it just as the recipe says other than I had to used ketchup instead of tomato paste because I didn't have any. I cooked the quinoa in veggie broth and added some fresh chopped spinach because I needed to use it up. I will be making this again and again!

Excellent. Using quinoa was a great idea. I substituted 2 tbs barbecue sauce for the hot sauce and tomato paste. Next time I will try ketchup instead of barbecue sauce. I also added half a cup of shredded cheddar cheese, but I don't know if it made a difference. The end result was very moist and delicious.

This was very good. I loved the nuttiness of the quinoe and the worchester sauce in it.  The only substitution I made was BBQ for the tomato paste. Definitely a keeper.

I doubled the recipe, used 3 eggs (instead of 2) and switched out BBQ sauce for hot sauce (plus a few shakes of hot sauce for good measure). Also added a Tbsp BBQ sauce to the topping mixture. It was delicious! 
I made it for the book club ladies and they all wanted the recipe to take home and trick their husbands into eating turkey :-)

Excellent recipe!! Drew, I only changed three things: less salt and I added a little ketchup in the sauce to baste the meatloaf. Also, I reserved a little sauce to pour on the meatloaf in the last 10 minutes of baking. Great flavor!!! Thanks again.

Love it!!! Made it exactly as per the recipe except I halved the hot sauce because I only had habanero sauce (Ardvark sauce).  It was perfect and we all liked it so much that we're going to add it to rotation.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fabulous.  Instead of hot sauce I used Picappa Sauce.  I double it because it is great for sandwiches too.

This was great!  I left out the hot sauce.  My kids would not have eaten that.  I love when I can sneak in healthy food and noone knows.  All of it was eaten.  To bad, I had been looking forward to a meatloaf sandwich tomorrow.
It has been a while since my first review.  This is a family favorite.  There is never any left and the kids say "don't stand between me and my meatloaf".  They have no idea how healthy it is they just know that they love the taste.  For my family's taste I always substitute ketchup for the tomatoe paste and barbecue sauce for the hot pepper sauce.  It is always perfect for us this way.  Also, I don't use any salt.  I never use salt in cooking.  My family favorite from this site!

I was worried about how the quinoa would taste and how it would affect the consistency, but it turned out excellent!  Great texture and flavor.  I omitted the hot sauce because I'm a wimp.

I thought this was excellent! I also used ketchup instead of the tomato paste and it was delicious even my husband liked it :-) I also used a lean ground turkey to cut back some of the calories.

Nothing exceptional at all, and I made it exactly as stated. Way too bland, very dry, and the and the Worcester made it taste a little rancid.  The only good thing was the use of quinoa.

This was the best of all of the ground turkey recipes that I've tried. I'm not 100% sold on a sweet topping, but it tasted better the second day. I actually used a quinoa and brown rice mixture - very good! Will definitely make this again.

This was a WONDERFUL meatloaf!  I very rarely eat sugar anymore, so I substituted Stevia in place of the brown sugar and left out the Worcestershire sauce and added soy sauce instead.  It was delicious.

Loved this! Just as satisfying and moist as ground beef meatloaf. Doesn't need sugar on top - just 1/4 cup of ketchup mixed with a tsp or two of Worcestershire. I was out of foil so I used a small rectangular glass baking dish.

A really easy and tasty recipe. I did add a little hot red pepper jelly to the paste for a little more heat. Very moist and yummy--you won't miss the beef.

Moist and delicious. The kick from the hot sauce is just delicious. I took whites out of two eggs before making this, and just used the remaining yolks for the egg requirement. It had no negative effect. I look forward to making this again!

I am often hesitant of turkey meatloaf recipes- but gave this one a try because I was intrigued by the use of quinoa.  This meatloaf is fantastic!  I love the use of quinoa in place of the usual breadcrumbs and appreciate the benefit of the added whole grains!  The meatloaf was very flavorful and the texture was great (both complaints I often have with meatloaf, especially turkey).  I did substitute BBQ sauce for the hot sauce to make it more kid-friendly.  This will be my go-to recipe for ground turkey from now on!

I'm not always a big fan of ground-turkey substitutes, but this meatloaf was a big hit with my whole family! It was flavorful and surprisingly moist. Be careful with the hot sauce though - using the amount specified makes for quite a kick to the meatloaf.

I have to admit I was surprised by how tasty it was.....for healthy meatloaf. Other than cutting the hot sauce in half I followed the reciped exactly, if I was cooking for just my husband and I would keep the full amount of hot sauce and I'll bet it would taste even better. This will be added to me meal rotation, thanks for sharing!

I was wondering what to do with the big bag of Quinoa I got at Costco.  This will take most of it.  Was very easy to make and the family loved it.

Wonderful meatloaf.  I pretty much followed the recipe exact, which is odd for me.  It was very moist and didn't any sort of sauce.  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious, healthy supper!  Basically followed the recipe except a few minor changes.  First, I added more garlic than called for (3 cloves which was just right, not overpowering, but I do love my garlic!).  Second, used ketchup instead of tomato paste.  Third, I used Sriracha hot sauce for the hot pepper sauce.  Finally, I cooked the meat mixture in lightly greased muffin tins.  Recipe made 12 muffins which I cooked at 350 F for 30 minutes, plan on freezing the extras!

I would give more stars than 5 if I could.  Absolutely delicious - made exactly as recipe stated - it does have a kick but we love spicy here.  Moist and flavorful - best meatloaf I've ever had.  Will definitley be making this a lot this winter!  Thanks for sharing!

Even my picky toddler loved this dish.  It was much smaller than the in-pan beef meatloaf that I usually make. I will double it next time to have leftovers.

This was really good and really easy!  The quioa gave it a great texture and body.  I didn't glaze mine because I accidentally put the brown sugar into the loaf rather than onto the loaf.  Oh well!  It was yummy just the same!  My sweetie went back for seconds and said if he'd had room, he'd have gone back for thirds.  Thanks for sharing!

This was definitely easy and seemed pretty healthy, but it doesn't go down as my favorite meatloaf recipe. I love Quinoa, but it does make this a little crumbly, as Quinoa doesn't absorb like crackers or breadcrumbs do. Definitely worth a try if you need something easy and affordable.

This was wonderful!!  Every other turkey meatload recipe I've tried just seemed too boring - like the flavor was lacking.  But this was wonderful!  I substituted the tomato paste for ketchup as well and it worked great.  I strongly recommend and can't wait to make it again soon!

Delicious. Texture seemed a lot like regular meatloaf, and a much healthier alternative. I did add a little barbecue sauce to the recipe. Will definitely be making this again.

Delicious! I had problems getting it into a loaf on the cookie sheet and it ended up only an inch tall! However, it still tasted great and made a wonderful sandwich for lunch the next day. Next time I will try the muffin tin idea.

Great recipe to adapt to what you have.  I used 1/3 cup quinoa and 1/2 cup chicken stock.  used ketchup in place of tomato paste and used 2 lbs of hamburg in place of turkey.

I really enjoyed this "something different". I am always looking for ways to fix a healthy meal using turkey, and this recipe did not disappoint! My husband, who HATES traditional meatloaf, loved it as well!! That's always a plus!!

This is a yummy recipe.  I would at 1/2c of quinoa instead of the 1/4c it calls for because it was a little crumbly.

The best. I haven't had meatloaf since I was a kid, because I didn't like it. Tried this and loved it. I cooked the quinoa in water with beef bouillon, it would probably be great with chicken bouillon if you don't care for beef. The quinoa really picks up the flavor of anything it is cooked in so this really adds to the overall flavor.

Awesome recipe!!!  I didn't have 20 oz of turkey, I had 2 16 oz packages so I used them both and changed the serving size to 8.  I used a silicone loaf pan and cooked it at 340 degrees in a convection oven for one hour.  I wasn't sure if it was done but I checked the temperature and cut it open and there was no pink.  It was delicious, and my husband loved it too.  I'm glad I made so much, looking forward to leftovers!  Oh, and I followed the recipe exactly (apart from scaling to a new amount and using a convection oven)!

Yummy!  I really enjoyed this.  I'm not a huge meatloaf fan but I think this is just as good as beef meatloaf.  My husband and my kids, 6 & 4, really liked it too.  Good weeknight meal.  Thank you!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It was very easy to follow and the meatloaf is moist and flavorful.  If you happen to have some quinoa that you don't know what to do with, try this out.

I love this! Wonderful recipe for anyone on a gluten-free diet. I've made it according to the recipe and with my own variations -- both were delicious. The second time around I added diced mushrooms and squash to up the health factor and add to the texture. I also tried using agave nectar rather than brown sugar. It was still yummy, but next time I'll do a tbsp of each. Btw, the sauce is so delicious I like to make a little extra. I didn't have hot sauce on hand, but sriracha did the trick.

This came out great! I added some bread crumbs, about 1/2 cup to the mix because it felt too wet. Next time I will just double the quinoa in the recipe.

Wow... this was the best meatloaf I have ever had!  So nutritious with such great flavor.  I am usually not a a fan of "sweet" with savory foods, but I loved the glaze and thought everything came together perfectly.  I didn't change a thing and won't next time either, as I don't think you can improve on this one!  Served with "Spruced Up Mashed Pototoes" and broccoli.  Thanks, Drew... this one'e in the rotation!

This was so delicious and moist!  I used blackstrap molasses instead of brown sugar and it worked well.  Is there a reason this is cooked on a baking sheet rather than a loaf pan?  I'd like to try using  that type of pan next time.

This had a great kick to it, and for those of you who are worried about the brown sugar topping, don't be.  It's sweet, but not overwhelmingly so, and you probably won't end up with a thick layer of it anyway.  The biggest problem with this for us was that it was a little dry.  This could be my fault; my one deviation from the recipe was that I used extra-lean ground turkey.  If I make it again, I'll use regular.  Still, the quinoa was an interesting idea, and one I'll probably try to adapt for other meatloaf recipes - thanks!

I don't like Meatloaf but was looking for a way to use quinoa and came across this recipe.  Changes-  2tsp of Hot sauce, ketchup instead of paste, and quinoa cooked in half broth half water.    We have made it twice now and really enjoy.  Plus  its a healtier alternative.

This meatloaf was exceptionally yummy!  I was looking for recipes using quinoa and thought I'd give this a try. 4 instead of 5 stars 'cause the brown sugar topping burned and smoked up the oven.  Didn't care for the sweet taste of the topping either.  Will stick with ketchup as a topping next time.

For a turkey meatloaf, this is really good.  And I love that quinoa is added instead of bread crumbs.  I thought mine turned out a bit crumbly so I will use another egg next time and see if that does it.

This was tasty, but didn't wow me. The only chance I made was to add some chopped fresh spinach to the mix.  I think this needed a lot more seasonings and i really missed the ketchup on top...

I love this healthier version.  I used ketchup instead of the tomato paste.  Wonderful gluten free option with the nutritional punch of quinoa.

This recipe is a real find!  Very flavorful and low fat.  It seems that you could almost double the quinoa and not sacrifice flavor. I served the dish with sweet corn and green beans -- will definitely make again!

Great recipe.  Turkey in anything is usually bland, but this is definitely not.  Nice flavor, and an added bonus of using quinoa in a recipe which I know is a healthy option.  My family loved this, even the child who normally "doesn't eat meatloaf".  Thanks!

The meatloaf was very good,  I had a tough time locating the Quinoa in the store, but finally found it thanks to google and my Blackberry.

Delicious! Made exactly as written and it was great! It had a wonderful not dry texture and is way healthier than the original. I think next time I will add some tomato paste to the top, but that is the only change i would make. This will be in my menu planning from now on. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious! I added an extra tablespoon of tomato paste to the meat mixture and about a tablespoon to the rub. My husband and I both loved the nutty flavor of the quinoa. Will definitely be making this again!

Loved it!  I added about a half green pepper diced, and 1 shredded carrot, plus 2/3 of the tomato paste can went in the bottom, and the rest mixed in with the topping.  I also UP'ed the amount of quinoa to 1/2 c. (with a cup of water) instead of 1/4.  This is my new favourite!.
