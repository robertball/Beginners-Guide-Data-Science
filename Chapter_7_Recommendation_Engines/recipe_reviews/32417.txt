I only rated this a 4 star because I changed it.  I didn't have any sweetened condensed milk or instant coffee granules so I made my own recipe.  This is what I did.  1/4 C coffee.. 1 cup ice cubes.. 1/3 c half and half..  1/3 c milk..1 T chocolate syrup and sugar to taste..makes 1 cup..it was fantastic! I will be making this alot..and you can save coffee from breakfast to make it...  so thanks for the idea..ENJOY...

I didn't use the hot water, just blended in the instant coffee granules with everything else. I used white chocolate syrup instead of milk. Nice way to wake up this morning, and it felt great on my sore throat. TIP: You don't really need that many ice cubes, just a few will do you just fine. Otherwise, it's a little ice-chippy. EDITED 12/08/08: This is even better with eggnog! Try it for yourself.

THANK YOU SOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!! This is exactly what I have been looking for!! I used to be able to buy iced coffee in a carton back home in West Ontario.  Since I moved, I have been looking for this forever!  I gave up until I found this recipe.  This is definitely a 5 star recipe!  Add a shot of Kahluha or Baileys and you have yourself an $8 drink.

Oh my, this is soooo good!  I'm drinking it right now!  It's like a Capuccino Blast (from Baskin Robins) without the ice cream!  I am so HAPPY I found this recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing.  You could add the whip cream and cinnamon or chocolate sprinkles to the top, but I don't think it needs anything.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I will be making this over and over and over.... Thank you Janice!

I was more than a 100 miles away from home earlier this week. My friend and I had a Starbuck's Iced Coffee.  I can't believe my incredible good luck to find this recipe so soon!  Is that serendipity, or what?

I cant believe I didnt rate this one before!  I have been using this recipie ever since I found it about a year ago, and when I did, I laughed at the idea it could replace my beloved Starbucks coffee, but on reflection...it seriously has!  I think its perfect as the recipie says, easy to make, and even my bf raised his brow in approval when I surprised him with a tall glass of this on a hot day at the pool.  I have also made this with leftover brewed morning coffee in the afternoon.  Great recipie!

Made this for company on holiday.  I don't like instant coffee, so used chilled, freshly brewed with mini ice cubes (not blended), topped with whipped cream & heated caramel.  Was shooting for the d&d's caramel watcha ma call it.  Next time I use this recipe, I will try blending.   I changed some things to make it to company's request.  Thanks for the recipe.

WOW!!! I have tried nearly every single "DIY" coffee drinks and not once have I been pleased. But THIS.. oh wow, thank you so much. I would have never even considered using condensed milk in a recipe such as this, but go figure, that's what all the other recipes are lacking! This tastes just like what I would pay $4.66 for at Starbucks. HA! Looks like I'll be pocketing that money from now on. I did make a few minor changes. The changes I made created 3 tall glass servings. I'm currently living overseas and we use the Senseo coffee machines; so I used 2 cups (2 pods) of regular Senseo coffee. 1/2 cup of milk, 4-5 oz. condensed milk and 1 to 1-1/2 teaspoons of vanilla coffee syrup. Blend it all together and you are left with a cheaper, easier and just as delicious coffee drink. I was so happy about this recipe that I did the math, and I would spend between $30+ a WEEK (1 drink a day) and now with this recipe I am only spending 75 CENTS per large glass!!! Oh man, I'm so happy I don't know what do with myself. LOL

very tasty treat. I like it's made with sweetened condensed rather than 1/2 and 1/2.  Next time I will freeze some milk to make it a bit thicker and I will make the coffee stronger. Overall, I really liked it.

Last year around this time, my sister and I were really craving a Iced Coffee drink. Since I live in South America, there is no Starbucks or anything to go to for a cold coffee drink, well atleast a good one. When we found this one, we tried it right away and became addicted to it! It is great and all of the ingredients we can find here. I make it a lot now (I try not to make it too much). Thanks a lot!!

I have this every day before work.  I have the bullet and blend up a cup at a time - take less than 5 minutes to prepare, save me money and time stopping at Dunkin Donuts.  I don't use the chocolate syrup - I'm the minority by not liking chocolate much and it is still wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe.

not that great.  I wanted to save some bucks and not spend $3.55 for a large vanilla iced latte at starbucks but unfortunately, starbucks is much yummier than this concoction.  the condensed milk is a little too much for me.  I guess i'll continue having my starbucks once a week as one of my guilty pleasures.

Excellent!  Now my wife won't spend so much at Starbucks or McDonald's!!  This is a great recipe.  The only thing I changed was I added one more teaspoon of instant coffee to give it an extra oomph!  Thanks a million!

Very yummy. I didn't bother with the water and the instant coffee, just used about a cup of cold coffee left over from the morning, used fat free sweetened condensed milk, and no regular milk. Made it with chocolate syrup, caramel and both, great every time.

After trying this recipe I have decided that it's a 5 the best, Iced Coffee I've ever tried. I changed a few things, but nothing major. After blending the Iced Coffee in the blender, I stuck it in a bottle with a lid, then set it inside the freezer for an hour to get it thicker. I should have put it in for only 30 minutes though,because the middle of the drink was liquid, but the outside was frozen to the point of having to wait a while to drink it. Other than a minor problem it went well.

My wife is a huge starbucks fan.  I should buy a bumpersticker that says my wife and my money go to starbucks.  I made this for her recently. She tried it, looked at me with teary eyes and told me she loved me.  AND THEN...........NO Im just kidding.  She really did love this one though and did compare it to Starbucks.  Ive been making it for her quite often.  I dont like coffee but its pretty darn good to me too.

We love this! I am enjoying a glass (for the second time in two days) while writing this review. The only thing I change - I use 3 teaspoons (= 1 TBS) coffee granules because we like a strong coffee flavor. Honestly, this recipe is going to save us a ton of money. It really is similar to a Starbuck's mocha frap. Just add whip cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup on top and add a straw. Perfect. Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy!  I had to use rather a lot of ice to make it thick and shake-like, which diluted the taste a bit.  I think that I'll chill the coffee first next time so that it doesn't melt the ice cubes as much.  I used a bit of vanilla extract instead of chocolate syrup (that's what my husband prefers) and it came out exactly what we had a taste for!

This really does taste like something you would find at an expensive coffee house. I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and fat free half and half, I also added about a tablespoon of Kaluha to my glass. since my blender is a quitter when it comes to crushing ice, I put the ice in a plastic bag and hit it with a mallet to break it up a bit, then I put the ice in the blender to finish the job. Thank you for sharing this recipe and saving us all some money!

I didn't use this recipe, but I just make regular coffee, pour the coffee into ice cube trays and freeze. then when I want some iced coffee, I make regular coffee (hot), add creamer of choice to taste, then the coffee ice.  It takes just a second to cool, and when the ice melts it doesn't water the coffee.

Since I have a new found coffee addiction, I was looking for a recipe I could use that gave a similar taste to Starbucks (to save money).   I came across this today and tried it.  It reminds me of Mcdonalds Mocha Frappe.  Its a little sweet for me.  I'll probably either try more coffee or less sweetened condensed milk next time.  But other then that it's a great recipe!

This is a pretty nice drink, but I give 4 stars because it was lacking coffee flavor for me. In comparison with other cold coffee recipes I`ve tried this was just good. After reading reviews I decided to cut back on sweetened condensed milk and the drink wasn`t very sweet.

Thank you for this recipe!  It is so good and meeting my coffee "needs" this summer.  I moved to an area about two years ago that does not have a starbucks within 35 minutes and I have been planning my trips to the city to include a stop there!  Plus, now that I'm pregnant, no one makes decaf iced coffee!  Now I can make them at home and pretend it's the real thing!  Thank you!!!

i am giving this 4 stars, but only because i revised it what i had. instead i used 1/2 a cup of already brewed coffee, around 20 ice cubes, 1 full cup of milk, and chocolate syrup, but i used the amount of chocolate syrup to my taste. goes great with warm, gooey, cinnamon rolls.

This is absolutely wonderful as is!  WARNING:  I don't think the calories are correct, which is scary since a lot of people use them to determine their dietary needs.  Two tablespoons of fat-free sweetened condensed milk is 110 calories alone and this calls for 10 tablespoons for two servings!  Whoever put in the calories....that's bad!

I made this on impulse and used a fresh brewed cup of coffee. The ice melted a little bit when I added it but I think it turned out fine. Next time I may use a little extra coffee. I'll be taking my blender with me on vacation so I can make this! *EDITED* I just realized I left out the milk and it was still very tasty!

Delicious! I was a bit skeptical when I saw the short list of ingredients but this was unbelievably good.  Tastes just like one of those drinks you'd pay $4+ for at an expensive coffee joint. As its on the sweet side, I tend to substitute evaporated milk for the sweetened condensed and then add sugar to bring it to my own desired level of sweetness. You can also swap out the chocolate syrup with caramel to turn it into a caramel frappe.  I am experimenting with using real coffee in this recipe as the instant doesn't have such a good flavor but in a pinch, this works great as stated.

Oh my goodness!  Tim Hortons' charges $3.99 for this same drink! I make with caramel instead of chocolate.  The best, refreshing drink when you want something icy.  I like to add a bit of Kahlua, too!

Wonderful! I can't eat chocolate, so I just flavor with about a 1/2 t. of good quality vanilla. Sometimes I add whey protein powder to give it some nutritional value. Sooooo GOOD!

I can safely say this is my fav iced coffee recipe. The condensed milk makes all the difference. I followed this recipe exactly except I didn't have chocolate syrup, so I used 1 tbsp. chocolate protein powder and used slightly less than 1/2 can condensed milk, it was sweet enough. Also, it says to use "1 tray ice cubes" which I assume means 12, but I only used 8, which was the perfect amount. This recipe makes 2 servings. It tastes just like Starbucks, I'm amazed! This is a definite must have, so simply & easy to make!

As my generation used to say "It's a blast." Simple to make. I only changed the order of ingredients---added the chocolate syrup and Nestlé's instant Espresso granules to really warm water so the syrup  mixed easily when stirred by hand. A new summertime favourite.

I think I've died and gone to heaven!!! This is the BEST iced coffee I have ever had! I've been trying to make it on my own for a long time and it just never turns out right.  I'm so happy to have found this receipe!  I did make a few changes as I don't use instant coffee.  I used 1/2 cup of the leftover  morning coffee, 1 cup ice, 1/4 cup sweetened condensed milk, 1/2 cup skim milk,  2 T chocolate syrup, and  1 T caramel syrup ( I tend to like my coffee drinks on the sweet side). Oh, then I added whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles!  YUM!!! Move over Starbucks... ha ha!

This iced coffee was amazing! If you like it sweet, like me, this recipe is perfect. If you don't like things too sweet, just don't add as much sweetened condensed milk and chocolate sauce. DELICIOUS!

My DD and I tried this one and it seemed to be missing something. So we doubled the Chocolate syrup and added a tiny bit more sweetened condensed milk. It came out a little better but we will still keep tweaking it.

This drink hits the spot on a hot afternoon.  I used decaf coffee (instead of instant), and I used half/half.  I then used Splenda and unsweetened cocoa - for a low carb version.  Can't wait to make again.

Really really good recipe. I used instant espresso instead of regular coffee. I'm not sure if it made much difference but it was totally yummy. Another good thing is that all the ingredients are commonly found in my kitchen to start with. This recipe is a keeper.

I just made this recipe and it was great!! I didn't have milk so I used some evaporated milk. Also, I added a tad more chocolate syrup and some vanilla. I had my dad try it and he loves it too. It tastes just like the iced coffee I used to get from the local gas station before it burned down and  finally, I have something that can replace it that isn't so expensive!

Tastes absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe pretty much as stated except I used 1/2 cup of leftover coffee. I guess some people didn't read the recipe right because it does say to use 1/2 of a 5oz can of sweetened condensed milk, not the WHOLE can. No wonder some people said it was too sweet. Next time, I'll try using ice cubes made out of coffee. My blender kind of sucks and the ice stays chunky.

WOW!  LOVE this coffee drink.  I made it for my children using decaf and they LOVED it.  Also, I had a bunch of friends over and they were all impressed!   I ornated it with whip cream, chocolate syrup and sprinkles of coffee!  It was a HIT!
Thank you!

This would be really good with regular coffee/espresso instead of instant. I'm not big on the instant coffee flavor. I used fat-free sweetened condensed milk and it turned out great. Next time I will try it using left over coffee/espresso.

I made this for me and my daughter tonight....Wow!! Loved it!! We both agreed that this is just as good as the coffee drinks you buy! We slightly heaped one of the teaspoons of coffee granules and I also added about a quarter tsp. or more of real coffee extract to the warm water/coffee mixture. I used a little less milk than stated and added some Hershey's chocolate caramel coffee creamer in it's place, and added a little less sweetened condensed milk. I didn't want to make it too sweet. Used about half a tray of ice cubes. Going to make it tomorrow with the whipped cream and dark chocolate shavings. Hmmmm...maybe I'll sit on the porch....

This is the iced coffee recipe that I have been searching forever for! This is such a creamy, sweet, delicious treat! I love the fact that it requires simple, easy to find ingredients! I did add a splash of vanilla syrup. Thank you so much! Saves me a ton of money by not running to the coffee house so much!

Very nice... I didn't use hot water like some other users did- used instant coffee we had lying around. I have to say that too much ice can make it a bit watery...... but other than that, great recipe.

Great pick me up drink.  A few suggestions......I used two shots of espresso instead of instant coffee, substituted condensed milk with half-and-half, added 1 packet of sweet-n-low, and went without the chocolate.  Tastes great.  I might add more ice on my next venture (12 cubes wasn't enough for me), but it will definitely be repeated.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is great!  I'm addicted to the iced coffees from McDonalds and now I can save $ by making these at home.  Instead of pulling out the blender I just mixed the coffee and everything together and then used crushed ice from the fridge...yummy.

I couldn't bring myself to use Condensed milk, way high in calories.  Evaporated milk and a big TBS splenda reduce the calories, so this review is based on that fact. I like it sweet and chocolaty, so I add extra chocolate syrup, actually squeeze the syrup into the blender for about 3 seconds.  If your blender leaves ice chips you just need a new blender, most newer blenders do a great job.  This is VERY smooth and creamy.  Sometimes I leave out the coffee.  Tried with strawberries and it was great, too. My husband HATES Coffee, but when he tried it he said the only thing wrong was he needed more- in a bigger glass!

This recipe rocks!!! Ever since I got my own automatic espresso machine, the trips to Starbucks for hot coffee became unnecessary. But every once in a while I really crave the frappuccinos!  This iced coffee is awesome. I use fresh brewed espresso instead of the instant coffee, but otherwise no other changes. It is a snap to prepare in my Magic Bullet. You've just saved me lots of $$, and I'm sure this will be a huge hit with my friends this summer. I will also change this up and make it with caramel sauce instead of chocolate. Thanks!

I am a coffee-holic and I thought this was delicious.  Exactly like Starbucks, if not BETTER.  I used half a cup of brewed coffee and reduced the condensed milk to 4 oz. Even then it was pretty sweet and I love sweet coffee.   I also added a little extra water.  I've never had condensed milk before, but it is very thick and sweet.  Next time I may increase the coffee a little, but if you're using fresh brewed, 4 oz does give a decent coffee flavor.  Try it!  I'll seriously never need Starbucks again (unless I get a gift card haha!)

It was ok.  I didn't find it too sweet.  I could taste the sweetened condensed milk above all flavors.  I might or might not make this again.  I am definately on the lookout for a better iced coffee recipe.  Thanks for getting me started, though.

15 minutes ago I found this recipe and now I am happily drinking my iced coffee! I was craving an iced coffee so I searched for a quick and easy recipe so that I could make one here at home. This was the first recipe I saw and it looked simple enough, so I gave it a shot. I thought it would just taste "ok," but I am blown away! Very deliciouso! After making this, I feel so proud that I could make something this magnificent!
I used caramel syrup instead of chocolate, and it's fabulous. It tastes just like a caramel frappuccino from Starbucks.
It's a bit too sweet, but I think that was my fault because I didn't measure out the sweetened condensed milk, I just eyeballed it. So I probably put in too much. But it's still really really good. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper!

Great recipe! A little sweet for my taste though. I cut back on the sweetened, condensed milk and the syrup
and it was perfect. The other change I made was to use leftover coffee but freeze it in ice cube trays. I use that instead of ice, so anything that melts becomes coffee instead of water.

Took into account my own taste preference as well as some of the reviews and used leftover fresh brewed coffee (actually made extra coffee just to try this recipe).  Also used fat-free sweetened condensed milk.  Will make again but will probably try to cut back on the sweetness - maybe use half the sweetened condensed milk and some fat-free half&half, to get it less sweet but still creamy.  After years of training myself to take coffee with little or no sugar, this is definitely taking two steps back!  Of course, I drank it anyway...and will definitely make again! :-D

I toned down on the milk only using a 1/4 cup instead of half 1/2. I also added extra coffee and omitted the chocolate syrup and opted to spike mine with a little white rum. My girlfriend and I loved it.

Wow! This is the first time that I have ever given a review on any recipe.  This drink was  so fabulous and I wanted others to know how spectacular it is.  Since I am the only latte drinker in my house, I poured the drink into freezer containers for later.  You could even scoop out a little and enjoy it slightly frozen with a spoon.  Yum!  Thank you for this great recipe!

I made this just like the author has written it and it was very good. Next time I may add a little less coffee as my own personal taste prefers it less strong.
I don't understand people totally changing a suggested recipe and then giving a review. I don't see how that can be an honest review of the authors recipe - wouldn't that be more of a review of the "reviewers" recipe?

My brother and I were home alone with nothing to do at all. We were seriously bored out of our minds. I had been browsing through each of my apps when my eyes landed on this recipe. After realizing I had all of the ingredients I got up from the couch and got to work. This iced coffee took no effort at all. You just put everything in the blender, mix it up, and enjoy. Since I don't really drink coffee I couldn't judge if this drink was good or not, therefore I made some for my brother(who is practically addicted to coffee...but picky) and as soon as he tasted it his face lit right up! The drink was officially delicious. Even though I made this drink on a cold and windy day, I'm sure that it would taste 10X better in the summer.

Great! Made it for my 50 year old parents. Loooove it. They said it is the best iced coffee. I tried some too and boy, they were right! I'm sooo glad I have AllRecipes. Add hot fudge and extra whipped cream on the top.

Absolutely lovely! I used a Magic Bullet to make mine and had to improvise a little. (1) I used 1tspn of Nutella since I didn't have chocolate syrup. (2) Since the Magic Bullet cups are small, I only put 1/3 of warm water, 1/3 of milk and used 1/3 can of sweetened condensed milk to make mine. (3) I used only a few ice cubes.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous! I have made it for the second time today & I really love it! This time though, I used ice cubes I froze using left-over coffee from this morning to give it that extra strong coffee flavor. Also, I did not have/use any chocolate syrup and it still came out yummie! I will be using this recipe frequently, thanks for posting!

I like my coffee thick, sweet, and a bit chilled. This was perfect for that and especially good for the summer, though I couldn't help getting into it during the winter too. :)

In my case, instead of the coffee syrup I added 1 tablespoon of choco mix. Still, it was very sweet. Sweet or not, this coffe is just delicious! Thanks!

I really don't see what's so great about this. It didn't taste anything like Starbucks or McDonald's like some people said. It was really kind of blah despite using extra coffee. I probably won't make this again.

Yummy and easy recipe to follow.  Loved this recipe.  Used Folgers instant, fat free sweetened condensed milk, and skim milk just to see how it tasted and it was wonderful!  I am making this tomorrow just like the recipe calls for and I'm so excited!  Thanks!

This is tasty!...I used french vanilla creamer instead of the condensed milk (didn't have any) and didn't put quite as much in..5 oz is a lot..am wondering if she meant half of a 5 oz can...anyway I used 2 cups of ice from the dispenser and it is yummy..will add more chocolate next time as I like mocha drinks the best!!!...thinking it would be tasty mixed and poured over the ice too...to me that is more of an iced coffee and this is a frozen coffee...This is gonna save me some $$$$ as the company I worked for closed this winter so I am going back to school and can't really afford my Mocha Latte habit from DD....THANK YOU!!!

Awesome!  I combine all ingredients ahead of time except the ice and store in the fridge.  Pull it out and throw in the blender with some ice when I get the craving.

Wow, this was so good!  Like others, I did make a couple of changes.  I used just 2 tablespoons of fat free sw and cond milk, skim milk, and added a little extra chocolate (my weakness).  The changes were great, and the recipe had only around 135 calories per serving with no fat calories!!!

This is SO delish!! I left out the syrup, just because we didn't have any. Tastes like liquefied coffee candies. Yummy.

This coffee is sooo addictive, it still tastes better when I get it at the vietnamese restaurant but that's probably due to the brand of coffee's I'm trying or just because things always seem to taste better when someone else makes it:0)

I made this for the rest of my family and they simply adored it!I made double the amount however I only used half a cup of milk for 4 people,as it was a little too milky otherwise.Also added a teaspoon of vanilla and some ground cinnamon.Instead of adding the iced cubes and putting all ingredients in a blender I made the Iced Coffee,chilled it and finally put in the ice cubes.With a blob of vanilla ice-cream or whipped cream on top this recipe has drink me written all over it!

This was great!!  We found the original recipe a little sweet though, so I used 1/3 of the condensed milk, and Ovaltine in place of the chocolate syrup.  I make this all the time, a couple times a week usually!!

AWESOME!  It was great.  I used a bit less milk than it called for because I'm not a fan of things overly sweet.  I used leftover coffee, and this is my new treat!  I can finally save money at Starbucks now that I have found a perfect substitution!

We make iced coffee often (with our leftover coffee during the day), and it is always just "okay". Today I thought I would try and see if there were any other ideas of how to make it better - and wow - the condensed milk did it. WE love it! I eyeballed most of the recipe (not much for measuring) and it came out terrific. Thanks for sharing the idea and looking forward to having it again and again and again and...

This is really good iced coffee^^ First time I ever made it and a success. I didn't have condensed milk so I used evaporated and added sugar to it (as someone had said in the comments). I added some extra ice cubes to make it less thick and everyone loved it!

This is a very good recipe. The only thing I would change is to add less sweetened condensed milk. 5oz is too much for me, very sweet. I would use maybe half that much. Otherwise a great recipe. Thanks!

We don't have condensed milk in this part of the world, so I used a container of plain yogurt and threw in some sugar to balance out the tartness. This was delicious and refreshing.
