This is a great recipe. I made this for someone who had it when they were very little but could not remember what it was called or the ingredients. After some searching, I found this and it was it! I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and had enough filling for two pies. Very sweet! I made sure I took the time to whip the egg whites properly, too.

good pie!  very rich and sweet, almost too much so.  it only filled one pie crust though, the recipe was a bit misleading.

My husband nor I cared much for this pie. It's so cloyingly sweet that neither of us could even finish one slice.
