Best Challah I have ever made in 20 years... The only thing I changed was adding 6 tbsp of sugar not 2. From the second I touched the dough in the bread maker I knew that I had Challah gold on my hands... will never use another recipe again. BEST EVER!

This recipe just came out on the site today & I decided to try it & I am so glad I did.  Wonderful flavor with a chewy texture that was exactly what I was looking for.  The dough is  very easy to work with & I turned out a beautiful, shiny, delicious work of art. Thank You for the recipe, I will be sure to share with friends!

I gave this recipe to my 10 year old daughter so she could bake challah for the family every Shabbat and have a recipe to call her own.  This is the best tasting challah.  She has followed the recipe exactly and it comes out great every time.  She recently made this challah for another family and they were asking for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a delicious bread and very simple to make. I would suggest increasing the sugar if you would like your bread a little sweeter. I sprinkled the braided loaf with a sugar and flour topping before baking. It came out delicious. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Came out very good.  I topped the challah with poppy seeds (my fave, over sesame).  I had to add almost 2 cups more flour than is written, I have no clue why.

It was okay, a pretty loaf, but kind of plain tasting.  Not bad, but have had better with less work. I used more surgar.

I thought this bread came out very well.  I have never had Challah bread before this, so I don't really know how it should taste.  It was delicious though.  It was simple and I had no issues with the dough at all.  It was very nice and easy to work with.

So good! I sweetened it up using 6 Tbsp. sugar (as another suggested) since I made this for Rosh Hashanah, added raisins, and sprinkled the loaf with sugar prior to baking. What a lovely, sweet (as I made it) loaf, that I will continue to use for Rosh Hashanah! FYI-it does need at least 1 1/2 c. more flour than recipe states.
For weekly challah, I use one additional Tbsp. sugar, 1 c. whole wheat flour for part of the flour, and occasionally add raisins when bread machine "beeps," then braid into 2 loaves.  Baking at 350 for 10 min., then decreasing temp to 325 for 10-15 more minutes works best for my loaves.

I made this and another challah recipe.  I didn't find this bread had as much flavor as the one that required all honey instead of sugar. This loaf had good texture however.  I need to revisit this recipe again as I now realize my mistake: I made two loaves instead of one. Doh!

I have been baking bread for years and this was the nicest loaf I ever baked. Tender, buttery flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, sprayed my hands with cooking spray while rolling out the ropes of dough and braiding and it looked and tasted terrific. The first loaf disappeared so quickly that I am going to bake another today.

It was/is awesome!  The bread didn't take as long to bake as directed. 28 mins, but that could mean my oven is hotter or I made it longer and thinner than what they said. My ropes were about 16 inches long and thicker than a thumb.  Next time I will take my time braiding it. I was worried I was handling it too much. I'm glad I kept an eye on it in the oven...not opening the door...I just turned on the light and looked in. I'm going to buy an oven thermometer. I can't think of anything to change about this recipe. It was great hot with honey and butter soon after it came out of the oven and it was great cold the next day.  I served it with some day aged 16 bean soup made in the crockpot. Delish....

Finally found a great recipe for Challah.  Even using 1 cup of w.w. flour and adding grains and seeds doesn't diminish the correct moisture to dry ingredients.

I liked the recipe, except I had a little trouble with it.  First, it was too soupy and I had to add about 1 1/4 cups flour to bring it to the right consistency/texture.  I also added a little more sugar as a few other reviewers mentioned, but I think I missed not having honey in this bread--an ingredient that all other Challah recipes I've tried have.  I will try it again, though, because it seemed to work so well for others.  Maybe I was just having an off night.
