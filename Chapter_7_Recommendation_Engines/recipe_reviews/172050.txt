FOR WARM QUINOA VEGETABLE SALAD: I do not like cold salads/hard veggies so I made warm version of this! All you have to do is heat some oil in a pan and fry the bell peppers and carrots. Once they are semi-tender add the corn and tomato until the veggies are as soft as desired. Meanwhile, add the cilantro, mint, oil and balsamic vinegar (I needed double oil/vinegar than what the recipe said) and let it sit until the quinoa is cooked. Once it's ready, add it all together and you have warm quinoa vegetable salad!

This recipe can be very forgiving. Quinoa  such a heathy, easy to use grain that is GLUTEN FREE. Toss in any vegetables using vegetable broth makes it VEGETARIAN. Omitting tomatoes and onions makes it safe for a GERD diet. Don't like cukes? Use zucchini instead or brocolli stem and all, or dress it up with asparagus. Coriander would make a nice addition. Herbes de Province or  basil works for me to vary the dish. Thanks.

It was so yummy! I brought it to work and they just gobbled it up :)  I accidently took red bell pepper instead of yellow one, but it was still tasty. My husband is not fond of vegetables, but he certainly likes this one!

Just made this and it's really great.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the saltiness of the dish.  I used the 2 teaspoons as instructed when cooking the quinoa.  Fortunately I tested it before adding more at the end.  Far too salty for my taste.  Will definitely make this recipe again, but will reduce the salt to 1 teaspoon at the beginning...and omit it all together at the end.  Otherwise, it really is excellent.

Excellent!  The bf and I really loved this one.  I didn't have any mint, so I used a little extra cilantro.  I also brightened it up with about 1 TBSP of fresh lemon juice and added a couple finely chopped jalapenos. I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth instead of water for a little extra flavor.  Defintely will make this again!

This was wonderful!!  I cooked the quinoa with whey leftover from making cheese.  I had no cucumber, so I used celery, no red onion so I used scallions, and substituted basil for the cilantro and mint.  This got 5 stars from my husband, who is"ify" about salads for supper!

Wow! I've had quinoa in the past - prepared very well and prepared very badly. This is the most flavorful recipe I've tasted. It was my first time cooking quinoa myself, and I was surprised at how easy it was. Don't forget to rinse it!

Loved it, so simple and delicious. I used fresh oregano instead of cilantro/mint and it was good. I also needed an extra half cup of water to cook the quinoa.

Yum!  This was my third attempt at making quinoa, the fist was a big flop, but this turned out great.  I served this at a community party where another quinoa vegetable dish was served but people liked this better.  A definate keeper!

My sister told me about Quinoa and I just happened to go onto All recipes and find a recipe to use it. I loved the salad! The only two suggestions i would make it Make Quinoa ahead of time so it can be really cold in the fridge by the time you mix it into a salad. And second, My own personal taste would probably NOT cook the Garlic next time. I would prefer the garlic mixed in raw, but that's just me! other then that Excellent recipe!

this is a wonderfully tasty recipe. Since I love to get the benefit of fresh raw grain I didn't cook the quinoa. Instead I soaked the seeds overnight in cold water. They will double in volume. In the morning I drained the seeds and left them in my salad bowl on the counter top covered with a wet tea towel. Later, in another bowl, I mixed together the chopped up fresh ingredients (omitted the corn) and added the vinegar to them. I added the oil to the quinoa that had started to sprout then folded in the fresh ingredients from the other bowl. What a wonderful salad, everyone really enjoyed it!

I really don't think the carrots worked with the balsamic, and that the recipe was overly quinoa heavy. Should I make the dish again, I'm definitely going to cut down on the quinoa, double the vegetables or so, and nix the carrots.

Excellent recipe! I used dried herbs instead of fresh ones, and still tastes great. I also ate it hot, just mixing the cold veggies in while the quinoa was still hot.

I don't give it 5 stars because I thought it was TOO SALTY! 2 tsb salt is too much! I'll happily eat this batch but next time I'll be much more sparing with the salt. And forget adding more salt when you mix in the veggies! No need!

I made this exactly as stated and even though I liked everything in it, there was something that didnt' "taste right". I decided it was the cilantro. Also I felt there was too much salt in the recipe. I would decrease the salt in the quinoa cooking by 1 tsp. With these changes, I think it would be 5 stars, but of course you would have to taste it in your own mouth! I did like it and plan to make it again. I served it to company and they didn't care for it, but I think it was the too much salt and cilantro that put them off. This is the first time I ever tried quinoa and while I find it pricey, I plan to try other recipes using it.

This was my first time cooking with quinoa also and this recipe has made me a fan of this healthy little grain.  Everyone enjoyed the salad the day I made it, but I preferred it the next day.  The flavors blended nicely and changed the taste (for the better). In my opinion.

Delicious! First time making quinoa and it turned out fabulous. I had to compromise on the ingredients based on what I had in the cupboards and fridge. I put carrots, red onion, tomatoes, peaches n cream corn kernels, dried parsley flakes, onion salt, sesame oil, balsamic vinegar, turmeric cumin, salt and pepper. Turned out great!!!

I love this salad. I have made it for several family gatherings and everyone loves it. We have several family members who are vegetarian and this is an ideal addition to any meal. 
I have added additional vegetables and larger amounts per personal preference.
Simple and easy to make.

Holy "use up all those leftover veggies in your fridge" salad, Batman!  This totally took all the vegetable remnants I had taking up space in my fridge and gave them a tasty, tasty home.  I used red quinoa (someone gave it to me and I needed to use it up) but other than that, I followed directions, save for the cilantro.  My husband hates cilantro.  The part about him not liking cilantro makes me sad, but this salad makes me happy!

Pretty good. I sauteed 1 jalapeno, 1/2 onion & 2-3 garlic cloves in olive oil for 5 minutes, added 1 cup of chicken stock and s&p. I had to add water several times to cook the quinoa (~2/3 cup) completely. The vegetables I used were carrots and cherry tomatoes. No cilantro, but I added chiffonaded mint. Then a splash of balsamic vinegar, a couple fresh mozzarella balls (from the tub I got at Trader Joe's) and some marinated oil from that as well.

4 Stars only because, like with grits, I don't like getting the little grains stuck in my teeth.  I made minor veg. substitutions and cooked the quinoa in low-sodium chicken broth, and used half the salt.  When I tasted the quinoa I almost gagged on the salt so I didn't add any additional when I added in the vegs.  That made it just about right.  We enjoyed the cilantro and balsamic flavorings and made a very refreshing salad.  This was my first go at quinoa.  Not so sure I'll do it again but it was a good introduction.

I read other reviews that said there wasn't enough water so I went a little overboard and used 4 cups of water which made the quinoa a little too mushy.  I'd try 3 1/2 cups next time.  Like other reviewers, I used only 1 instead of 2 teaspoons of salt.  I doubled up on all the veggies as it was a lot of quinoa relative to veggies as stated.  I also thought the finished product was missing something so I crumbled feta over the top which made it excellent.  I cut fresh corn from the cob and I thought that this plus the carrots and cucumbers (unpeeled) added a nice crunch.  Many more additions could be made to this like sunflower seeds, nuts, diced chilies, avocado and any fresh herbs you have on hand.

Do NOT put 2 tsp's of salt in this recipe. 1/2 to 1 tsp would be plenty. It's really hard for me to comment otherwise. The salt was pretty overpowering.

This was pretty good as a side. I used chicken broth instead of water for the quinoa and used grated carrot instead of diced. I went a little heavier on the veggies and also added sliced black olives, but I still wished I had more veggies. Might try reducing the amount of quinoa next time. Overall, a nice light dish. Probably best during the summer months.

I love that it's simple enough to edit to your liking.  I avoid the carrots and corn and reduce the salt a bit, and it's perfect.  I bring this to all potlucks and people love it!

An easy, forgiving and delicious recipe. My skeptical boyfriend ("What the heck is Quin-Oh-Wah?") asked for more. Easy to adapt to whatever veggies and spices you have around. I tried to scale down the recipe, but still made way more quinoa than I expected - it was fine. It kept fresh for a full week - I just added a little more vinegar when we served it. Adding this to the permanent menu at my house!

I love this recipe. Always a popular dish. I leave out the mint, as I don't like the texture. If you plan to eat it right away, I would use about a one to one ratio of balsamic vinegar to olive oil (otherwise it tastes too vinegary). If you plan to let it sit overnight before eating you the ratios listed above work well.

I was a little weary of the mint and balsamic and lack of cheese, but it was delicious.  Made a huge bowl and I was able to eat almost the entire thing by myself over several days.  Will definitely be making it again!

i had bought a salad like this at Central Market so i thought i would try it at home. The store added avocado but basically it was the same recipe. no garlic either. easy recipe to add to according to your own taste. this is my first experience with quinoa.

This is an awesome quinoa recipe.  I substituted the water for homemade chicken broth and used only fresh mint, fresh cilantro, and sea salt plus a really good olive oil.  I also didn't use the seeds from the cucumber or tomato.  Don't skimp on fresh, quality ingredients when making salads like these.  

While the quinoa is chilling, you can chop all of the veggies and store in the fridge until ready to assemble.  This does not need to sit before serving in order for the vinegar to soak in.  It was just as good right away and the next day.

I didn't add cilantro or mint (because I don't like either), but the garlic and balsamic vinegar combined with fresh garden veggies made this plenty flavorful.  Since I was the only one eating this, I kept it in the fridge and took some to work each day as a side.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was a light refreshing yummy salad.  I've never cooked quinoa before but it was delicious.  I did need an extra 1/2 cup of water to cook the quinoa.

I added more balsamic vinegar and cilantro than the recipe stated. Next time I think I will cut down on the Quinoa quantity, add lemon juice and substitute chicken broth for the water.

I substituted fresh basil and oregano for the cilantro and mint and it was delicious. It made A LOT, but that was fine because I took it to a BBQ. In the future, if I make it for home for my family of 5, I'll cut it in half.

I use chicken broth to cook my quinoa. I mince all my veggies  and fresh herbs small but by hand bc the food processor can mush them. I use canned rinsed whole kernel corn and a fresh Anaheim pepper for a little kick. I cook the quinoa with red onion but stir in green onion. I don't stick to the measures of veggies either, I like lots of veggies in mine, and it turned out great! My kids didn't really 'get it' 4&7 but I'll try agin anyway. :0)

I used all of the ingredients listed, but changed the method of preparation to make it a warm dish. basically sauteed all the veggies in olive oil and garlic, folded them into the cooked quinoa, and topped it off with the balsamic vinegar. Delicious, healthy, and perfect for lunch. thanks for sharing!

This salad is GREAT! I used asparagus instead of corn and added chunks of chicken.  Very healthy, very tasty.  My kids loved it.  I made a big batch and sectioned into containers for lunches.  This will be made a lot at our house.

This is a great salad. I prepared the directions up to completing the quinoa and adding the balsamic and olive oil a day before serving, and refrigerated for a day. The next day added the fresh produce having on hand, I did not have cilantro, but did have mint (growing in my yard), I was surprised at how a little mint went a long way in flavor. I used fresh parsley I had on hand. Also having a lot of green onions- and cut up a small green tomato too, I may add more next time. This is a delicious salad. Will be making it again SOON – will make a point of getting fresh cilantro.

Lovely recipe as is (with no changes) and worth the 5 stars. Using the raw vegs makes for a healthier salad instead of cooking all the nutrients of the vegetables. Fresh and light for a summer day.

I love this recipe!! I added 1/4 cup of feta cheese and 1/4 cup of pinenuts before serving. I used rice vinegar instead of balsamic because it has a lighter flavor and didn't chill the salad, but served it at room temperature.

This salad was great, but I added a bit more balsamic vinegar than was called for to punch up the flavor a bit.

This is my favorite quinoa recipe!  I actually omit the olive oil and vinegar at the end and it still tastes great!

Because of a known food allergy, I substituted steamed fresh beets for the corn.  It turned out really well as the beets have a good amount of sweetness and I think the texture added something to the salad.  I agree with another of the people who made this about raw veggies.  I added the raw carrots to the quinoa after it was done and that softened the carrots just enough.  Good recipe.

So yummy!! I could not get mint at the store but it didn’t matter. Delicious!! I also did not chill the quinoa as stated. I just let it cool down and mixed with raw veggies. So good!!

Really great recipe but I used garlic salt after to flavor instead of table salt. I also added garlic powder and quite a bit more black pepper. I also found I had to double the olive oil and balsamic vinegar to really coat the quinoa.

A very good salad. I liked the way the quinoa was prepared. I've never tasted such good quinoa. I'll definitely make this again. I don't always add the dressing, it can go without.

I didn't like the mint with the balsamic. If it just had mint then it would be refreshing.

Followed recipe and it's perfect! I've never eaten quinoa before, much less cooked it, and was pleased with the result. Very healthy, easy, just takes a little time to make. Well worth it and great to know how healthy it is!!

Very fresh tasting. I cut the olive oil and balsamic vinegar in half because I don't like my quinoa to be too moist. Great ingredients.

My daughter asked for a quinoa recipe to bring for lunch. Well, we had it for a side dish with dinner and then the leftovers went for lunch, several days in a row. I also doubled the amount of vegetables
I can't say I made it exactly according to the recipe and in fact, we enjoyed it warm but overall, it was tasty.

4 stars, but that's because I had to cook with what I had. I cooked the quinoa with 1/3 low sodium chicken broth, 2/3 water, and 1 cup diced onion.  I used frozen steam bags of corn, peas, and carrots, and seasoned with 1 tsp lemon-pepper mix, 1/2 tsp each of dried sage and oregano, and some black pepper.  I didn't add any extra salt, either.  So simple, so filling, and a complete protein with the quinoa.

This was my first try with quinoa.  I enjoyed it, but I agree with other reviewers that it's too salty.  Also, the balsamic flavor was a little strong for me.  I think I will cut both in half next time I make it.  Basil instead of cilantro was good.

Made as stated, but something was missing.  I decided to double down on the mint and up the tang by adding 1 T + 1tsp. lemon juice.  Now it is the summer salad I was hoping for!  Definitely a great starter recipe that you can customize for your taste.

Very yummy!  We did not add the Cilantro (we just don't like it), I used a mix of herbs and extra garlic, omitted most of the salt and kept the rest the same.  Thanks for the healthy recipe!

It was yummy!  I do have to say that 2 cups of dry quinoa was too much.  I had to add more water to get it all cooked.  So then, the ratio of quinoa to veggies wasn't right.  Next time I'll use just one cup.  Other than this, I really enjoyed it.

Made it almost exactly as written, used less balsamic because I like the fresh taste of the cilantro and mint. I think you could use whatever veggies you have on hand if you wanted. This makes A LOT, so good for a pot luck or a party, or if you have a large family.
