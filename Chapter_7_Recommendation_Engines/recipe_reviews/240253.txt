Made it exactly as the recipe called for, found it very salty, made a smaller version the next night and dropped the chicken bouilion out of the recipe and enjoyed it much  more. Will be making it again down the road.

I normally don't eat brussel sprouts and I thought I would try something new. This dish was great and I even got my kids to eat them ;) Thanks Chef Kim.

A pretty good and different take on brussels sprouts. I didn't have chardonnay on hand, so I went with a sauvignon blanc.

I was not a fan of Brussels Sprouts but this recipe was AWESOME. I substituted "Dry Vermouth" for the Chardonnay and is did wonders.

The best Brussels sprouts recipe ever. Definitely a keeper.  This will be a nice side dish with any meat, especially during the cold winter. I made it with pork tenderloin, awesome!

Made it for a dinner party, and everyone loved it.  In fact, at a party where everyone brought something, it was the only dish that got rave reviews from everyone.

Substituted chicken broth for the white wine, and it was delicious!

I was dissapointed. I love brussel sprouts and thought by the reviews this was going to be extra tasty, it wasn't. I could have gotten better results by steaming them, adding butter, then crumbling the bacon over the top afterwards. The sprouts were tender, but after cooking the onion and garlic in the first step, they got bitter, in my opinion,when cooking the rest of the way until the sprouts were tender. I even used very small sprouts. I will not be making this again.

I found this recipe way too salty.   A combination of the bacon and the chicken bouillion.  I would eliminate the bouillion the next time.  Or the bacon.

Delicious!  Made it for a Thanksgiving side dish.  Doubled the recipe, but did not double the amount of chicken bouillon powder (used 3 TBS.) or pepper (used about 3/4 tsp of pepper).  Also, used probably 1 1/2 cups of bacon.  I think everybody who tried it liked it pretty well.

Great! I made a half recipe though, and started sauteing the brussels sprouts from frozen. That way, they were cooked crisp.

Excellent!! I typically roast Brussels sprouts but my oven was unavailable due to the amazing Perfect Prime Rib by Chef John (On this site.). My family loves sprouts and Iâ€™m so glad to say they loved this preparation as well.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving dinner.  I always judge a recipe by taste and by compliments received.  Let me just say that no one commented on it at all.  I thought it was good, not wonderful.  The next time I make it, I will reduce the amount of bacon drippings.  It was pretty but just a little too oily for my taste.

I used only 2 tablespoons of bacon grease and no oil. Excellent. I served them with broiled trout with lemon, dill, & white wine, and wild rice pilaf.

made it simple.  fried the bacon, removed.  added halved Brussels sprouts, garlic, onion powder, red pepper, salt/pepper and some balsamic vinegar.   OMG!  really good!  it probably would be better with the whole recipe but we are trying to watch carbs & sodium and I was in a hurry... so this worked and I would definitely make it again!  (I think the key is starting with good quality bacon.)

This will be my 6th time making this dish and I have to say my family and I can't get enough of it! We love it. The dust time I made it exactly how the recipe calls. The second time I only had turkey bacon so, I used the turkey bacon...OMGOODNESS! It is amazing. Everyone goes back for seconds.  Our favorite side dish for sure.

I have tried Brussels sprouts in different ways my entire life, and NEVER liked them.  But, I am quite stubborn, so I tried this recipe....... and it changed my opinion forever!  OMG!  Even my spouse liked them!  This is a new favorite in our kitchen, so all I can say is give it ONE try.  Totally worth it!

I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients "on hand" and because it said "even those that don't care for Brussel sprouts will like this recipe. To me, Brussel sprouts are just okay - I'll eat them but there are many other veggies I like better. Well, this recipe made a believer out of me - both my hubby and me absolutely LOVED these!  I followed the recipe exactly and used real bacon pieces instead of frying up a few pieces. This recipe is simple to make and everything comes together very well. If I were to make a change, and it would be slight,could be to reduce the red pepper flakes from 1/2 teaspoon to 1/4 teaspoon. The 1/2 teaspoon (to me) gives it just a tad more "bite" and than I like, although hubby thought it was just perfect the way it was. I highly recommend this recipe - it's delicious and good enough for company!

I followed the instructions to a 'T' except substituted the bouillon for chicken stock and used 1/2 c of panchetta over bacon. This was a huge hit; the wine was a great idea!
