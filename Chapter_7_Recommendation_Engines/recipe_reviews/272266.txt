This was OK, it was certainly easy.  The steak stayed kind of chewy though at the stated time/temp.  I'll try it again and maybe cook it a shorter time.  The mushrooms were awesome seasoned like this!

Made this one a couple times now just as described and it came out really good in my air fryer. Will make it again.

Sounded so good but was a let down.  Cooking at directed temp/time left the meat fairly tough.  Not a whole lot of flavor pops out in this one.  Rating it a 2 for ease of prep and method of cooking.  Believe I'll stick with pork, chicken and fish in the air fryer.
