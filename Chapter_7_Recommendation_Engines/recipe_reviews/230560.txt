I took them to work and everyone loved them.  They were very mushy and we had to stick them back in the fridge half way through the day, though.  I probably would go ahead and make actual buckeyes next time because they got a little messy, but the flavor was good.  Maybe a little more powdered sugar would have firmed them up.

This recipe just needed alil tweaking in my opinion........31/2 cups of sifted powered sugar and they came out perfect ! They set up nice and came out of the pan intact :-) I gave them a 5 star after i tweaked the recipe of course......

This was much easier than normal buckeyes. I did use an extra cup of powdered sugar (like another recommended) to prevent stickiness of the peanutbutter and it worked well. They are good, but they don't have the same impact as the round buckeyes. If I am making just for me this is fine, but to take to a party the round balls are better.

Not a good version of this recipe. I had made these several years ago and was trying to find a recipe for "buckeye bars" that was similar to what I remember making in the past. The chocolate became brittle and cracked after refrigerating them. Looking back I remember having a little bit of butter mixed in with the chocolate so that they cut easier after being refrigerated. Look somewhere else for a recipe!

Easy great quick recipe. I didn't have enough chocolate so I used white and dark chips. My boys love it.

A jelly roll pan is MUCH to large for this recipe.  The peanut butter mixture had to be spread so thin (used wet fingers to do this) and never set up enough to be cut and the chocolate was brittle and broke when I was trying to cut it.  Ended up putting two pieces together such that the peanut butter portion as sandwiched between chocolate, otherwise an absolute mess. 
 Will not make these again.

I made exactly as written, except I put it in a 9x9 square pan. I do not see how 12 oz. of chips would be enough to cover the larger pan. I also used white chocolate chips, and the combination was divine.

Good and easy recipe.  I halved this and used coconut sugar instead of the brown sugar and crunchy peanut butter because I didn't have enough smooth and it turned out fine.  It's nice to have the scrumptious taste of buckeyes in a quick and easy method.  Thank you!
