This was fantastic! I could not find Bison so I used skirt steak. I also added 1 tbsp of sesame oil, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, and cracked black peppercorn into the soy for the steak and added mushrooms with the veggies. The family love love loved it!

Oh my goodness, this was exactly what I was looking for.  Great flavor combinations.  I have used this recipe so many times because my family loves it so much.  I have to make larger batches because they insist upon left-overs.  I tend to add more vegetables than suggested and upon serving I add some bean sprouts and lettuce to the bowl (on top) and then sprinkle with a sweet chili sauce.  This is a super recipe and very easy to make.  Thanks!

I did make a couple subsitutions based on what I had in the fridge,but that is the beauty of stir fry sort of stuff. I used chicken instead of beef, sugar snap peas for the broccoli and added mushrooms because I had some in the fridge that needed to be used up. The only flavor changer was to also add 1 tb of dark sesame oil. I just love the taste of seasame in Asian food. I did use 2 tb siracha sauce since I like spicy stuff.

I can not say enough good things about this recipe...I used sugar snap peas and shiitake mushrooms, but the Bison skirt steak was the highlight of this dish!!!

Well I found out that I do not like peanut sauce. Surprised me really but there ya go. I did think the sauce needed more heat. I shared this with my mom, aunt and cousin. They all thought it was good so I'm overruled with the peanut sauce. Although I will say I had to make jmy own peanut sauce so maybe that had something to do with it? The bison was delicious, I did add some sesame oil to the meat.

This dish was really good. I was unable to find bison meat but used a flank steak. Would like to try it with the bison because the steak was flavorful but a little tough. Also added daikon, Asian pickled radish, which was great with this dish. We served with homemade sushi and potstickers. Yum yum!

The only thing that tasted good was the meat. The vegetables didn't cook much and the sauce or soup tasted revolting.

This was so good! I used sugar snap peas instead of broccoli and beef in lieu of bison.  The veggies have a nice crisp when you follow the recipe.

We loved this recipe! Since I'm allergic to beef this was a perfect recipe for me and my family enjoyed it equally as well. I doubled the amount of broth and used chicken broth due to my allergy, and used 3 cups of water. Everyone likes a lot of broth with their soups here. I added about 3 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1 1/2 tablespoons of sesame oil to the broth to give it more flavor. It is now a rich and delicious accompaniment to the rest of the ingredients. Make sure you get a good cut of bison for this recipe. My local health foods store has a bison 'event' every three months, but otherwise just has ground or an inferior cut off steak in their frozen section. I will be sure to stock up the next time their event rolls around just for this recipe! I could eat this on a weekly basis-its that good!

This recipe is amazing! I used regular teriyaki marinated steak and added mushrooms. But even without the steak, just the noodles and such, fanstasic!

Peanut sauce was not available in my small town. I had to make some using a recipe from this site. My boyfriend had 2 huge servings (I'm guessing he enjoyed it. LOL) My son gobbled his down as well. I on the other hand, didn't care for it. The bison was delicious though!! I think I had trouble accepting the peanut sauce (purchased may have been tastier). Once I added sriracha (love that stuff) and even a bit of sweet and sour *gasp*, then I enjoyed it more. I personally would've enjoyed the dish more minus the peanut sauce, but I was the minority. Majority rules and my guys really liked it! :) For my first bison tasting experience, I will definitely be cooking with it again!

My skirt steaks (I used beef) took 15 minutes longer to hit the right temp. I put them lower in the oven during the extra time so they didn't burn. I added Shitake mushrooms to the veggies as another user suggested and some sesame oil and ginger to the marinade. The meat turned out great! If I make this again I'll omit the green onions as they are too overpowering in this.

The peanut sauce didn't work they way I imagined. I added more chili garlic sauce to offset the peanut sauce. It helped but not something I will try again.

I did not care for the sauce. Luckily the beef was separate and it was delicious, so I quickly made some white rice and random asian sauce to go with it and salvaged what would've been a disaster.

It was a good way to use up some Thai peanut sauce that I had made, but not great enough to say that I'd make it again.
