This recipe is amazing!!!  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  I cook my quinoa in chicken broth because I think it gives more flavor,but there are so many amazing flavors in this salad that it would probably be fine just in water.

I added 1/4 teaspoon salt to boiling water. I also used 1 cup chopped cilantro, 1 cup chopped walnuts unread of almonds, and 1 1/2 chopped garlic clove. I used 1/4 cup lime juice and no onions. It was superb. My neighbors loved it too!

Whoever came up with this combination of ingredients is pure genius.  I halved the recipe to try it and now I wish I would have made the whole recipe.  This is a flavor explosion in your mouth.  Every bite tastes different.  Next time, I'm going to add more almonds and craisins.  Paired this with the "pretty chicken" also from this site.

Thank you - delicious! Served this at a party and everyone wanted the recipe. I have one suggestion for those who find that quinoa can be bitter - soak the uncooked quinoa in cold water for 10 minutes, rinse thoroughly in cold water and then cook. Should take about 10 minutes to cook and no biiter flavour!

Oh dear Lord!   This was the best meal I ever made!!!!  I never write comments on here, but I am so inspired.  OK, I made a couple changes because I had already thawed some salmon fillets and wanted a one  dish meal.  I made the recipe almost as called for except I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth, I added a bag of fresh spinach at the end, a bit of low fat feta, and crumbled the cooked salmon on top.  I also added a bit of olive oil while I mixed it all together.   Seriously, like something you'd get at a five star restaurant.  I will make this again and again, especially when I want to make a good impression.

I think for 5 stars, no adjustments should have to be made, but with my adjustment it turned out to be a very nice salad.  I agree that the salad was pretty dry (is it supposed to be?  I've not had quinoa before like this - and just learned tonight that quinoa is a seed, not a grain); but with the addition of at least 1/4 cup Newman's Own Light Lime salad dressing, it was much improved.  TIP - in case you are short of time:  I read the instructions and knew the quinoa had to be chilled before adding the veggies.  However, it took much longer to chill than I expected.  So, I put it in my medium aluminum bowl, filled my large aluminum bowl with ice water, put the medium bowl into the large bowl and stirred the quinoa until it seemed cool enough to mix everything else into it.

Liked this very much.  I did drizzle it with some olive oil and used cumin not curry.  Also used walnuts as I didn't have almonds.

I made this and all my children ate it up. Both my husband and I agree the cilantro taste was too strong so in the future I will use less cilantro. Other then that it was easy and tasteful.

I am trying to like this.  I had added more lime because at first taste, it seemed as there wasn't enough, but now that it's sat, I can't even sense it.  Like many, I'm rather new to quinoa and I haven't been a fan.  I really was hoping to like this recipe, so I would at least use what I have, not to mention all the benefits it has to offer.  I will say that the bites that contain the cranberry are my favorite and I added a bit of garlic in hopes of improving the taste.  I am not sure if it is just me or the flavors.  I am going to add more lime and let it sit a bit longer and see if it improves for my tastes at all.***Update:  after sitting overnight, WOW!! What a difference.  I also added a bit 2 cloves of crushed garlic and a chopped up some organic cucumbers.  I don't think this made the difference, but I can't believe it was the same salad.  I would rate this recipe 5 stars if the submitter specified that it needed to sit more than 6 hours, my guess is it probably needs around 10-12 minimum, for the flavors to really take over the quinoa and meld together.  I am so happy I found a quinoa recipe that I truly am able to enjoy.  If you are not a fan of the quinoa, let it sit overnight and try it for lunch the next day.

This was a great salad.  I cooked my quinoa with a chicken bullion cube and didnt add the salt and pepper.  This salad is so beautiful and colorful
There is so much flavor going on in this dish my husband ate most of the batch.  The only thing I would do differently is cut my onion supper thin and put less in it.  My onion was strong and spicy.

This recipe really surprised me!  It was really good.  Lots of flavor and texture.  I did add a little more lime juice, a little garlic and used a hot pepper from our garden.  I served this with grilled salmon....Yummy!!

This is delicious.  I've made it 3 times now & it's always great.  I've varied it some, leaving out bell peppers, adding some red quinoa.  It's always good & everyone who tries it seems to like it.

I accidentally omitted the cilantro and didn't realize until it had already been served.  It still turned out quite awesome.  In addition to the listed ingredients, I also added two fresno chiles and two serrano chiles (seeds/membranes discarded on the serrano variety).  It turned out pretty spicy, but not overtly so.  If I make again, I will reduce the chiles by half to make it a more comfortable eat for everyone.  Oh yeah, and I'll also remember to add the cilantro!

I LOVED this and so did my husband who is pretty picky. Made it 2 days in a row in fact, when I had my friends over the next evening. I made exactly as directed the first time, second time I added a bit of cayenne and some cumin to offset the brightness a bit.  Amazing both times.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Love quinoa and this was tasty!  Swapped out the cilantro for parsley (we don't like cilantro!) and used raisins as I was out of cranberries.  I found that leftovers did need some additional lime juice squirted into the salad as it gets absorbed once it sits overnight.  Yummy though!

This was a good recipe, however we felt that there was too much curry powder.  The only variation I made was to use raisins instead of cranberries because I didn't have any on hand.  I'll make this again but will use less curry powder.

It's a KEEPER!  Especially liked the unique flavors, textures and colors, the marriage of sweet/sour, crunchy/soft, garden colors of greens/red/yellow - gorgeous. As others have mentioned it was too dry for me so I drizzled with EVOO.  But w/wo, it's a wonderful nutritious salad.

I've made this recipe several times now for potlucks and parties and it always gets great reviews!  Definitely cook the quinoa in chicken broth rather than water (the one thing this recipe could stand is a bit more salt and pepper to it) and DO NOT leave out the cilantro or the curry powder--it really makes the dish!  I like to garnish with some green onion as well for a little extra kick.

Loved it. I used 1 whole red bell pepper, and celery instead of carrot, and fresh cranberries. I had to bowl the cranberries to soften them, only for about 3-5 minutes. I also roasted my own almonds, preheat oven 350 and bake for 8 minutes on a small cooky sheet. It was my family's favorite  thing I made for thanksgiving.

Such a wonderful combination of flavors here, fresh, tasty and healthy too! We love this salad. Adding a teaspoon of sugar or splenda really brings out the flavors even more. Thanks for posting this excellent recipe!

I've made this twice in the past week.  It is very tasty and healthy.  I think there are endless possibilities for adding other vegetables.  (Corn, peas, etc.) I cheated and used a wonderful mix of chopped vegetables that Trader Joe's sells.  I put the lime juice in a small container with minced garlic and a little olive oil and shook it well.  I loved that there is no real dressing on this salad.  It might be a little dry, as the quinoa seems to absorb the moisture.  It looks lovely on a plate--some people have never met quinoa, so it's good for them to learn about it! (I cooked the quinoa in chicken stock the first time, not the second. Both were fine.)  It's filling and good for you!

This recipe was outstanding. It was my first time making quinoa, so I was a little unsure what to expect. My only change to the recipe was adding the juice of two limes, not just one. The flavors went together so well and were very complex. It was the perfect summer side dish- refreshing, healthy and no oven required! Next time I may add some chicken and make it a main dish.

Have made this 3 times now.  Once to take to a pot luck.  I love it.  My sister took it to her restaurant and sold out.  Have made it as is and also with a few changes.  Great both ways.  Not a lot of difference using chicken broth instead pf water.  I used walnuts second time as ran out of almonds.  I like the walnuts more than almonds.  Cut out the canberries when serving to my niece wha has a big yeast poblem and is on a no nonsence diet.  Quinoa is one of the few things she can eat.  Love the recipe.  Thanks.  Am looking for more recipes using grains I have never used before to expand my healthy horizons.

I will be making this again. The only changes I made was to use the juice of two limes and I used 1 teaspoon of curry and a half a teaspoon of cumin. This is a delightful salad with a taste combination that wakes up your taste buds. It looks lovely on a bed of spinach. Thank you Alison.

I made this exactly as written.  I thought it was good and my husband completely raved about it.  The only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that i thought the onion sort of overpowered it.  Next time i would reduce this to 1/4 cup just like the peppers.
Update: I have continued to make this dish for our family and for almost every gathering where I am slated to bring a dish. With only using 1/4 cup onion it is absolutely perfect. I have had so many people ask for this recipe and then say that they had people asking them for the recipe. The recipe author really was genius with this one!

Excellent flavor in every bite!  I doubled the recipe using chicken bouillon to cook quinoa. Substituted  cumin for curry, increased lemon juice and cilantro amounts and drizzled olive oil over it.  Also added a handfull of feta to top.  Perfect!

This is the best quinoa recipe that I have tried. I have made twice so far. The next day it tastes even better.

On the advice of another reviewer I added EVOO as well as garlic salt as I thought it was a bit dry.  Otherwise a terrific taste.

This was a good salad. I think my rating comes down to personal taste preferences. I love curry powder in Indian food, but I did not think it was the right taste here. My family ate it and liked it, but we agree that we would like it even better with cumin instead of curry powder, avocado chunks, tomato, and lose the cranberries and almonds. I agree that it tastes much better the second day after being in the fridge overnight. So, from now on, I will make the day before. I also tried adding about a tablespoon of EVOO. Wow! That made it fantastic! I think it made it less dry and smoothed out the taste. Delicious!

LOVED IT! 
Made this for 30+ people at an event. So thankful for that feature of adapting to serving sizes. 
I preferred a vinaigrette dressing (only lime juice & olive oil) mixed the spices w/the dressing - delish. 
I needed to add to this recipe since i was cooking for 30, i included: chopped kale, chick peas, black beans & feta cheese. 
Quinoa is so good, you could pretty much use whatever veggies you need to use up - love it!

Be careful not to put too much onion in this. A small onion is 1/4 cup roughly. I think I put way too much! I ended up having to put another 1/2 cup carrots, cranberries, juice of 2 lemons and some more cilantro to counteract it. I hope it works! We will see tomorrow after it chills.

I love that this salad contains no oil.  Great flavors and interesting textures!  I used half of a medium red onion, but it was a little strong.  Next time, I will use less onion.

It was just all right for me - nothing that I would make again. It was missing flavour ... something ... but that something definitely wasn't in this recipe. That being said, it wasn't awful.

I'm not one to be negative, but I found this dish absolutely atrocious.  All sorts of flavors fighting over each other and not blending one bit.  I followed the recipe to the tee and I couldn't find anything about this recipe that I liked.  I can see many others liked it, but I didn't.

It had a very strong red onion taste and bitterness.  It's good because of all of the vegetables, but it has more of a bitter taste to it.  It needs a dressing or the vegetables need to be cooked to make the flavors better.  I think I'm going to make the dressing from the Quinoa Beet and Arugula salad from this website.  That was GOOD!

Great recipe ~ I pretty much followed exactly, although I did use hot curry powder.  Next time, I will add extra fresh lime juice.  Love the colours of this salad ~ would make a great picnic side.  Thank you for sharing

This was fantastic and delicious as it was beautiful. I cooked my quinoa with veggie stock (and therefore omitted salt), used green onions for a milder onion flavor, and shredded the carrots instead of mincing. The next day I did end up adding some olive oil for dryness and extra curry and lime the for a more intense flavor. This would be great as a side dish or a great vegan/vegetarian dish.

Everyone said they liked it, but everyone thought it had either too much cilantro or too much onion, and I used the amounts called for in the recipe. Next time I'll just use a bit less of each and hopefully it will be even better!

I'm giving this 4 stars as written. I did make it as written the first time. My changes are more personal preference, not because the original recipe is bad in any way. Didn't like the idea of curry in this recipe so I substitued1/2 teaspoon of ground chipotle and 1/2 teaspoon of ancho chili powder. I also added sliced avocado and chopped tomato and omitted the cranberries. My favorite way to cook quinoa is the rice cooker. 1 cup quinoa to 2 1/2 cups of water or other liquid (I like better than bouillon vegetable broth base) Set the rice cooker for white rice. Perfect and fluffy every time

This was a great salad! Per suggestions, I used Cumin instead of Curry (not a curry fan), added 1/2 Tsp. minced garlic, used chicken broth, used 1/2 cup chopped green onion(instead of red/yellow onion)and added 1 TBSP Olive oil. I put the minced garlic & cumin into chicken broth to cook with the quinoa. Everyone I have shared this with loved it!

This recipe gets 2 stars for having fresh, healthy ingredients.  I would give the taste one star. I used only half of a small red onion and it was overwhelmingly onion-y.Less onion and some tomato would make this recipe better. Try the black bean and quinoa salad from this site, it's amazing.

This was delicious.  Have not done much with qunioa in the past but will certainly make again.  The only complaint I had was the onion was a little bit too much.  I did use slivered almonds and added just before serving so it added a nice crunch.

This was absolutely delicious!  I do think the onion needs to be cut down quite considerably, as I only used half and still thought it was almost overkill (then again it was a particularly potent onion) -- but I'll be making this a lot.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I went to the store to purchase the quinoa, but did not get because couscous was less expensive. I figured it was not to much difference between the two. I cooked with beef broth did not add curry, lime juice nor cranberry used pine nuts and cranraisins instead. My family enjoyed and it will now be one of our go to sides.

Great way to enjoy quinoa! Flavorful, and tasty! Enjoyed by everyone. This recipe is now my family's favorites! Thank you, Alison, for sharing!
I cooked quinoa in water as the recipe calls for, but added a handful more of cranberries...

I just didn't care for the flavors here. I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth not water, and I didn't have fresh cilantro so I sprinkled in some dried. Other than that I followed the recipe. But all I tasted was the curry powder, it was overpowering and one-dimensional. I ended up throwing it away.

This is a great way to use quinoa.  I love all the colorful veggies, and with the variety of ingredients, it's easy to customize.  I cut back the curry to 1 tsp., and added about 1 Tbs. of olive oil, because I thought it a little dry.  I doubled the cranberries for extra zing and added about 1 tsp. sugar.  I will try cooking in chicken broth next time.  Thanks for the idea!

i think i just found my new favorite summer salad!  delicious!  i made as written except i did not use any curry powder. there are so many different kinds of curry, not sure of which one to use.  so, i tasted it without it and loved it and decided not to use any.  a keeper for sure.  thanks for the post Alison!

I make it with red Inca quinoa, and it makes a lovely salad for a pot luck.  The box says there is no need to cook the quinoa, just add the boiling water and let it soak up the water. I toast the almonds. I also add feta, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar.  It is a meal in itself and always a hit. Be prepared to explain to admirers what it is!

Made as directed (no deviations).  It was good.  Some people don't dig quinoa, but for those with refined taste buds - this was very tasty.

It was pretty good.  I just wasn't a total fan - seemed a little dry and lacking some punch.  COuld it be that I didn't mix the curry into the quinoa?  I prepped veggies ahead of time so all I had to do was mix it in the next day after the quinoa was cold

Excellent salad!  I had to sub lemon juice for the lime, and added a bit of zest.  I also chose not to use cilantro (not a fan) and put in parsley instead.  I love how the flavours blend and that there is a touch of sweet (carrot and cranberries) sour (citrus) savoury (curry) and that it's healthy!   I have been searching for a quinoa salad to try and I am keeping this one for sure.  Thanks for posting!

This salad was delicious! I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth, used grated carrots in place of minced and served it with BBQ'd Tandori chicken breast. Everyone loved it!

First time using quinoa, fantastic! This salad is so fresh tasting. Great combination of flavours and textures. I added 1 minced clove of garlic and a drizzle of EVOO after tasting. This will be made often.

I used chicken broth to cook the uinoa instead of water. The only other alteration I made was to add a little cyanne pepper. Nice flavors, next time I will remember to start with half of a lime then taste before adding more. My lime was pretty big and it ended up having more lime flavor than I wanted.

I am on a Quinoa kick, and this recipe was great.  The only things I did differently was use cumin instead of curry (not a fan of it) and I didn't have any carrots.  This was delish cold, I ate it as it or I added about 1/2 cup to an Asian Lettuce salad.  I also heated it and put a cube of Laughing Cow cheese and some steamed califlower and brocolli.  Love it both ways.  My only lil diss would be that it was slightly dry, which was why I probably loved it with the Asian Dressing best.  Quinoa Rocks!

Delicious! Such a good combination of flavors, colors and textures. My limes were sort of dry since I didn't actually plan to make this salad and just used what I had on hand. It took two of my dry limes and half of a very juicy lemon. I will be making this again soon!

I made it exactly as written and it was a big hit at my dinner.  The oil-free, low salt recipe means that more people can enjoy it.  People took the curry spice to be a bit middle eastern, which is fine.  It takes a little exotic without being too outside of anyone's comfort zone.

I've made this salad twice, and everyone compliments it.  I followed the recipe as written, except I did not add the curry.  The lime juice was added, but I also made a balsamic vinaigrette for a dressing.  It's delicious, and tastes even better after a day or two when the flavors mingle!  I recommend making it the day before for best flavor.

Excellent salad. I especially liked how the quinoa turns out cooked by this method.  Instructions tell you to lace it in the pan with water then boil.  It turns out nice and fluffy letting the water boil first.  Delicius

This was great. I made a few modifications. Didn't have bell peppers, onion, or cilantro so eliminated those. Had some extra veggies in the fridge so added tomato, cucumber, fresh mint and a tablespoon of olive oil. Fantastic!

Very good!
I used cumin instead of curry and shredded carrots instead of minced. 

I put minced onions in lime juice for a few minutes before adding to the rest of the salad; then  a little touch of Olive Oil.

Not bad, but not overly impressed as-is. It is delicious topped with avocado. In the future I will try this with coconut flakes. 

Other than toasting the almonds in 1 tbsp olive oil, I didn't change the ingredients, but I did cut the cilantro and onion in half after reading many reviews.  I also cut the onion very thin so it wasn't overpowering.

Super yummy! It was better the second day.  Initially I would have used less red onion, but after the second day is wasn't as over powering.  I also used some bottled lime juice in addition to the juice of one lime since the lime didn't give off a lot of juice.  This was great as an entree, especially for a warm day, but could easily be a side dish for a party, etc.

Made this recipe EXACTLY as written and it was delicious!  That said, it is also a very versatile recipe and I am looking forward to experimenting with other fruits and vegetables.  A great recipe for using up your garden produce.

This is a great salad, very tasty and crunchy. I had to substitute some things I didn't have on hand and it still came out great. I used lemon for lime, green onion for red and cumin for curry as I didn't have those things.

I agree the cilantro was very strong so I used less and still took some out. And I thought it was a bit dry so I added the lemon and cumin, salt and pepper to olive oil along with a tablespoon of honey and it had the perfect blend of sweet and sour.

This is such a versatile recipe and I will be making it again. Thank you Alison for sharing it.

I added extra veg. Also added one diced seeded jalapeno and walnuts instead of almonds. I like the idea of adding some olive oil to moisten a little.

10 STARS!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 

This was my first time making quinoa.  I used red quinoa and cooked it in vegetable stock.  Since we didn't have cilantro, we added cumin and adobo to step it up a notch.  

Many thanks for sharing this recipe.

Delicious - an easy and colorful side dish to any meal. I skipped the red onion (not a fan of them raw) and added some green onion instead.

It was my first time to cook and eat quinoa and i must say, this recipe had me floored! The curry powder, the cilantro and the red onions make for a powerful and delicious flavor. I followed some reviewers' suggestions of cooking the quinoa with chicken broth or bouillon cubes. I used chicken-flavored vegetarian bouillon powder. Other than that, the only thing I did differently was to lightly roast my colorful peppers together with some zucchinis and yellow squash, chopped them up and tossed them all in the mix. I loved this recipe so much i don't even feel like looking for other quinoa recipes :)

It was too strong on the onion taste and bland on the other flavors. I tried to add more lime for more flavor. It tasted a little better, but the onions were still too much for me (and I love onion).  
Tried to eat it the next day. Onions were still too overpowering.

Delicious - especially loved the fresh lime.    Replaced the yellow and red pepper with celery since my daughter is not a fan of peppers,  but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.     Shared with the daughter's 20 something friends - it was a big hit

When I'm on the go, I buy a small container of something similar at Starbucks for $5. Make this, save the money and get more flavor! This doesn't have the olive oil, like $tarbucks. I prefer this version because it's extremely easy to take on the go! I used red quinoa, added some green peppers, and a madras red curry (that's what was around.) Great recipe, thanks for posting it, Alison!

I've tried several quinoa recipes and never liked any of them enough to make again, but this was really good! I skipped the peppers because my kiddo doesn't like them (and because I was out), but this was very good anyway. I love that there's no oil in it, and yet it's still very flavorful. Will make again, thanks!

Really enjoyed this recipe, and I will definitely make again.  I didn't have curry, so I used a generous amount of cumin. Based on personal preference, I will likely cut back a bit on the cranberries and add more of the almonds.

This recipe is fantastic! Although, I didn't care to much for the carrots. I am just not a fan. I left them out of the recipe and everyone loved it. The dried cranberries really do make it! I went a little heavy on them and used 3/4 of a cup instead of 1/2.

Cooked the quinoa in chicken stock for a richer flavor. Added a bit of lemon juice with the lime because I had it. Used frozen cilantro cubes because that's what I had. Everyone RAVED about it and asked me to bring it again to the next potluck. I'm glad I made a double recipe of it.

Oh, also, I served it hot because I didn't have time for the quinoa to cool. Since I did that, I sauteed the veggies in a bit of olive oil. I put the veggies in with the quinoa and then the lime juice and curry. Toasted almonds on top just before serving.

This was the first time I tried quinoa, but it won't be the last! Really liked the crunch of the almonds, and the sweetness of the cranberries. I used dried cranberries sweetened with apple juice from the health food store. The salad looks pretty, and is good for you. Gotta love that! I did drizzle a little olive oil on top of my serving...perfect!

This was my first time cooking with quinoa.  The salad was ok.  The red onion was over powering for me.  I might try a sweet onion.  I also drizzled some olive oil and flavored balsamic vinegar over my salad.  The salad was dry to me.  I will probably not make this recipe again but if I was entertaining vegetarians, I probably would make it for them.

I served this to company and they loved it. The only change I made is that I used golden raisins instead of cranberries, because cranberries have added sugar on them.

There didn't seem to be enough water - some of the quinoa was still crunchy.  I increased the water to 2 cups and it was better.

I was looking for a new quinoa dish and this was perfect.  We love all of the ingredients EXCEPT the cilantro.  I think I will leave it out completely next time.  It was far too strong and overpowered the rest of the salad.

Quinoa was a little bitter, I'm not sure why.  Used as a side dish with lemon pepper talapia.  Thought I would prefer it hot vs cold.

This was so beautiful and yummy! Like another reviewer, I decided to add cumin, rather than curry, since I thought it would pair nicely, with the cilantro. When I tasted it, though, I thought it lacked a little flavor and sweetness. So, I added a little curry, and it was fantastic! I should have prepared it, as stated, from the start! I added a few more craisins, for sweetness, as well. Easy, pretty, healthy, and delicious...what more could you want? Thanks!

The combination of flavors & texture is delightfully tasty and fresh. Our adjustments: cooked the quinoa in chicken broth (i'm sure this isn't necessary and I might try it without the broth next time). Also, I put the minced onions on the side. Those that wanted them mixed them into their serving. This recipe got rave reviews from the family, and we will definitely be making this again.

I have made this recipe many times and LOVE it. My vegan friends love it, too! My only tweaks were to add the curry to the water when cooking the quinoa (I dislike "raw" curry powder) and omit the cilantro (I'm not a fan). I always get asked for the recipe!

Love the list of ingredients (minus cilantro).  I kicked this up a bit by increasing curry to 3 t.  Added 1 t cinnamon and 1 t cumin. Since I planned on having this as my lunch vs a side dish, I added a can of rinsed and drained black beans.  Not only was this a delicious meal, it was so colorful as well.

This was awesome! A great way to use up a lot of things left over in the fridge. I am not super huge on onions, so I only used about 1/4 a cup and minced them. Turned out great.

I made this salad for a potluck at work, following the directions as written.  This worked well for both the vegan and gluten-free co-workers, and it was very good, too!  It went over well with the crowd, and many asked for the recipe.  I would definitely make this again.  I toasted the almonds in the oven for a few minutes.  This was easy to prepare.

This is fantastic! Made it as a salad, but it makes a wonderful, lighter main dish too. I used a lot of lime juice ( to taste) and cooking the quinoa in chicken broth added enough salt for us. I added some white pepper to the seasonings for a little extra kick.

First time at trying Quinoa and this was a simple recipe without adding salt!  The flavors really worked well although the red onion was a little bit strong for me so I may use something else next time, but very good recipe thanks!

I LOVE this recipe!  All the recipes I have found that call for quinoa don't appeal to me.  This one has all of my favorite veggies and ingredients.  I followed as written and the only change I would make is to add more lime juice, but my lime may have been a little dried up.  I love the taste of this recipe and how filling it is for such few calories!

Super easy and quick, and only requires a few ingredients to make an amazingly tasteful salad! I made it for the first time for a family dinner and it was quickly gobbled up. 

**UPDATE** - I've made this many times now and I've added/minused ingredients depending on what I have on hand. Instead of peppers I like to use chickpeas and diced celery, and instead of red, green onions can be used for a less intense flavour. I brought it to a potluck and got many requests for the recipe. Definitely a keeper!!

Wow! this was my first experience with QUINOA and I have to say..."where has this little nutty grain been my whole life"  changes I made were: added walnuts (its what i had on hand) and edamame (for added color and texture) and i peeled the carrot the chopped it into confetti.....this side is tasty and GORGEOUS

This is such a terrific dish. My entire family loved it. My husband said Whole Foods could sell this and get all the money! I've made it twice already and am going to make it tomorrow night-yum.

Very delicious! Served for our Christmas party and even those who didn't typically like quinoa or cilantro loved this one. you can be pretty flexible with how much of the peppers, cranberries, etc... you'd like to put in. I used green onions instead of the red and instead of curry used coriander.

I made this for two Thanksgiving gatherings and everyone liked it! I chopped the dried cranberries a little smaller. Added 1tsp. of coconut sugar to 1/4c. Lime juice along with 1/2tsp. Cumin and 1 tsp. Curry. Cut the onions to 1/4 cup. Added 1 clove of garlic. And a few extra sliced toasted almonds.  I made these changes based on some of the reviews.

This salad is really good.  I have made it twice now - one time with nuts and one time without and I prefer without.  The changes I made were very slight - I cooked the quinoa in chicken soup base, I used less onion than called for, substituted cumin for curry and I drizzled some olive oil on the salad when tossing.   This salad is very colourful and delicious.

Very happy with this mixture! I substituted cumin for curry powder. I used 2 scallions in place of red onion (because that’s what I had). I also added diced celery for extra crunch. I will definitely be making this again!

We really enjoyed this dish.  I might have liked a little more seasoning, but otherwise, it was tasty, particularly with all the different textures and flavors in it.  It was also very colorful so I think it would make a fun dish for a party.  It took some time with all the chopping, but the fact that it's served cold makes it easy to prep it in advance.

The chopped onions were overpowering for me, so next time I'll leave the onions out. Everything else is SO GOOD! I added a little extra lime juice for more flavor. Def will make again.

Excellent recipe...I lucked out and found an aloha pepper which is a red and yellow striped bell pepper so I didn't have to buy both. I also substituted a large shallot for half of a red onion.  I love the crunchiness of this salad.

The flavors are incredible! Every bite is fascinating! I wish I could give it more stars and I’m going to make it for everyone. Perfect in a hot summer day.

I did make some changes: I used Farro instead of Quinoa because I already had it made. I replaced the peppers and the onion with frozen chopped red pepper, green pepper and white onion mix because I was super lazy.  It was still amazingly good. Don’t leave the sliced almonds out... the crunch is important

This was absolutely delicious . so very fresh . I really like to read the reviews . I only put in 1/4 tsp of  curry  powder  as if I had added as much as they say it would have changed the fresh taste.  Followed the recipe with the exception of the curry.
For thee quinoa always rinse& instead of water  use vegetable or chicken broth

I used low sodium vegetable broth instead of water and followed cooking instructions on the bag. I used pecan pieces and just served lime wedges with it because I have a citrus allergy. Most of my family had never tried quinoa before and it was a huge hit! Lots of them wanted the recipe. Looking forward to using this at other potlucks.

Onions where too strong, maybe next time omit the onion or use a sweet onion. It was surprisingly filling. This was my first time eating quinoa.

Very good! Kind of a unique salad for me. Not having enough dried cranberries, I added raisins, and simmered both in with the quinoa, per suggestions here. Unfortunately, my cilantro had gone bad so I lost that flavor, and almonds just don't appeal to me. I'm going to add some pecans to the rest of it, and few tiny orange segments as a garnish. Actually, with a few small cooked chicken pieces, (maybe leftovers from a rotisserie chicken.) you would have 
a complete, one plate meal!
I really like this!

This recipe is fantastic!! The blend of flavors make it so delicious. After reading several reviews, I made a few adjustments. I cooked the quinoa in vegetable stock and added a little cumin and less curry powder. And lots of lime juice which enhanced the combination of tastes the next day. I will make it a constant in my house.

I’ve actually switched cranberries to fresh blueberries, instead of white quinoa i used red kind, ‘cause those are only sources i’ve gotten on hand, guess what, it still worked, tasted juicy, may not be the bright color as the original receipt showed, but the crimson color after adding blueberry and red quinoa gave it the different look feeling exotic. Inspiring and big thanks.

This was good, but it lacked something.  Maybe a bit of oil and I will definitely shred the carrots next time, dicing them seemed to have an over-powering effect.  The blend of ingredients are tasty though.  Not exactly what I was expecting.

Followed the recipe to a T, and I loved it and so did my husband. Perfect blend of flavors the curry isn’t over powering and I love that it’s chilled. So refreshing. This is my favorite side dish, would also make for a nice lunch. Can’t recommend this enough!!!

I love this recipe.  Sometimes I use cucumbers instead of peppers and/or diced tomatoes.

Made as written; didn't change a thing. It was wonderful! Wasn't sure if I'd like the curry, but it adds flavor and depth. Healthy recipe; nice change from my usual fare for work lunch. Thanks.

Alison- Thank your Dad for me. This dish was amazing. The prep time took a little bit as it was the first time I made it. However, I know I could do it without the recipe as it was so easy to make. I used tri-color quinoa as I wanted to give it some additional color. It was healhtful, beautiful and just delicious! If you have never tried quinoa or have only tried ot with butter and salt, I highly recommend this. We had this with baked chicken and artichoke hearts! Fabulous!

Made it for the first time and loved it! Only change was less curry powder but made up by adding cumin power and turmeric. Also used another half of a lime. Will definitely make it again. Thanks!!!!!

Texture on this specific salad is Squeaky whereas other quinoa salads are not. - I think it might be the lack of oil. Nice flavor, but it's not the same recipe as Harmon's grocers in Salt Lake valley. Am leaving this note to remind myself not to make again.

I dislike curry and don't care for red onion but gave it a try anyways.  Loved it!  But did these changes:  only added about 1 1/2 t of onion which was plenty and still gave it enough flavor.  Used only 1/2 t curry and added 1/2 t cumin. Added 1 t of Olive Oil to moisten up a tad. Was fairly easy to make. Served on a bed of spinach.  Also, I found that toasting quinoa with 1 T butter for a few minutes, until it is popping for a while, then adding chicken broth instead of water gives it a more mellow flavor.   I made the quinoa in mid day and put in the refrigerator for a couple hours .  Then at dinnertime I added the veggies and everything else.   We will make this again and again!

Made as written, but I thought the onion was a little strong.  I would either use a little less or maybe lightly cook the onion to calm it down next time.

I love quinoa and the ingredients listed but I doubt I would make this again even if I altered the recipe. To begin the red onion was overpowering as was all the cilantro. 

I struggle when other reviews give it 5 stars but say they added 2-3 ingredients, swapped other ingredients and removed the onions or cut way back on the cilantro. Isn't that a different recipe???

On a positive note I liked the texture of the salad.

This is my "go-to" salad, and my family requests it for special occasions.  It is truly delicious.  The only modifications I make are to increase nearly each ingredient.  
I am particular about freshness and I wash, pat dry, and hand chop everything.  I carefully rinse the quinoa, and toast the almonds in the toaster oven.  It takes a lot longer than 10 minutes for me to prepare this colorful salad.   But it is worth the trouble.

I added a little sugar and extra lime to give it a bit more flavor. I wish I'd left out the red onion because it was too strong a flavor. I used multi-colored quinoa and the dish looks pretty.

This is a really good salad. Special bonus ... I had about a cup or so left the next day so I added a little more toasted sliced almonds and about 1/4 cup of feta cheese.  I used that to stuff a bell pepper and the taste was fantastic.  I had been a little concerned about heating it with the cranberries in it, but no worry. As the curry flavor was slightly more pronounced it was totally different from the way it tasted as a cold salad, but the cranberries balanced it all out perfectly.  This was a great way to disguise "leftovers"!

Liked it, but I like the Zesty Quinoa salad a little better.  Had a problem getting my head around the curry powder in it, but you couldn't taste it anyway. We will make this again. I diced the carrots but will shred next time so they can pick up the flavor more.  Also, I didn't measure the almonds or cranberries cause we love those & I just tossed in what "looked like enough" since I knew what was listed wouldn't be for us. This salad is very colorful which looks attractive on plates.

We really enjoyed this salad... I made it as 'all fruit' quinoa.  Used raisins, mandarin oranges and cranberries, with  walnuts. I tied up some Rosemary for flavour in the water... . and used a balsamic / oil based dressing.  This is definitely a winner.

Made the recipe exactly as printed and took to some friends. It was a big hit. Everybody loved it. Had enough ingredients left over so making another batch right away.

I love this recipe!  The only tweak I make is to add diced mango for a little more sweetness.  This can be eaten on its own, or I'll toss it with some leafy greens to make a salad.  Delicious!

This is so easy and delicious! I left out the cranberries and almonds and used it as a taco filling with some yummy baja cream sauce (hot sauce, lime juice, and sour cream). IT was delicious. This also makes an easy chip dip as an appetizer like a cold salsa. 
So many options with this one!

Took this to a dinner party last night and it was a big hit . The changes I made which made this extra special  was to replace the cranberries with pomegranate and added some pumpkin seeds. I had everyone ask for the recipe .

This recipe is excellent! It's super easy and delicious. The only thing I changed was I substituted in low sodium vegetable broth for the water. Good idea if you want a little extra flavor :)

The raw onion is a little strong; I will use half of the recommendation next time. Beautiful colors and flavors in this salad -- a great way for non-plant lovers to get their veggies!

Made it without the lime and almonds due to family sensitivies, and it still tasted great. I'm sure it would be even more flavorful with all the ingredients :-)

Love all the flavors together!  I used dried cherries instead of cranberries.  The second time I made it I used more cilantro, minced jalepenos and more curry powder.

This recipe just had an odd combination of flavors and textures. I definitely would eliminate the onion and carrots if I were to make it again. I'm going to keep searching for my go-to quinoa dish because this one isn't it.

A lot of flavor going on here. I don't like raw onions so I made a quick pickle by putting apple cider vinegar, some salt, sugar and water and boiled it for a few minutes which seem to bring the whole room together

Do not like cilantro.  Also, the dressing is missing something.  I have made it a couple of times trying to change it up a bit.  Still trying because I love the ingredients.

Delicious, with a few changes.  Upon first taste, the salad was dry and the curry taste too strong.  My lime was small, so I adjusted a bit by adding a fresh orange, sections chopped small and juice added to lime juice.  I drizzled a small amount of olive oil over the top prior to tossing.

This salad rocks..! I took it to a get together and the bowl was cleaned up in few minutes..! 
The only change I made was to add some olive oil. I just can't imagine any salad without.

This is probably the first time i ever comment on a recipe on this site.  Why? Because i have been looking for a really good quinoa salad and FOUND IT! AMAZING! Seriously! I could eat this everyday and not get tired of it.  I finally have a side dish (or even a meal on its own for that matter) that i will always be making and not feel guilty as it's super healthy! I have however made a couple adjustments simply because i didn;t have the exact ingredient.  I used shallots instead of red onion, and omitted the nuts because i had none at home. i did add a few thin swirls of extra virgin olive oil just to keep it from drying, probably not necessary though. Honestly i have read reviews on here with very little changes and because you really do not need to change anything on this recipe. Definitely a must try if you love quinoa, i love it even more now because of this recipe. What are you waiting for, go for it!
I made it a second time and added yellow raisins cause i had little cranberries, and may try doing half cilantro and half parsley or parsley alone because hubby not a huge fan of cilantro...but i adore it! good good good!

This was very good and different. I follows the recipe exactly with the exception of cooking the quinoa in chicken broth and adding a little olive oil to the finished product. I felt it was a little dry without the oil. My red pepper went bad so I used a whole yellow one instead. I would definitely make this again.

I also made with parsley as we don't prefer cilantro and used cumin instead of curry for same reason!  To help out with the lack of liquid, I doubled the lime juice (total 4 Tblsp) and added 1 Tblsp. of olive oil and this was amazing the next day and the day after that!!  Toasting the almond slivers I used was the final touch!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was perfection. I did not change a thing.  The sweet of the cranberries with the tart if the lime, the subtle but distinct curry flavor and the crunch of the almonds are a perfect combo. And so healthy!

This dish is definitely an aquired taste because of the texture of the quinoa. All of the different ingredients were delicious! The dried cranberries really brought the whole dish to life with the touch of sweetness.  I would probably take out the onions next time. Over all I liked it.

I made this and it was not even cool yet and could not stop eating it.  Didn't have enough lime so used 1/2 lemon too and some EVOO and used some chopped dates in it too along with the craisins.  It is sooooooo good.

Very good flavor combination.  I loved the curry in it.  However, too dry.  I'd add more olive oil and lime juice next time or someone suggested Newman's Own Lime salad dressing.

I really wanted to like this recipe.  Didn't like it initially so tried what others suggested.  I let the flavor blend overnight.  I added some extra cranberries to make sweeter. I added some olive oil to give it more moisture but nothing helped.  It was at first a bitter bland taste and never improved.  Won't make again.

I'm a fussy eater but this is worth it! Simple recommendations: go easy on the cilantro and double the cranberries. For next time,  I will be adding tid bits of brocoli, sunflower seeds, and even mango ;)

Bonne Appétit!

I added some chicken and vegetable bouillon to the water to make the quinoa.  I used roasted walnut pieces instead of almonds.  I added a lemon and some red cayenne pepper.  The lemon brightened it and the cayenne gave it a kick.  It would have been excellent as is, but for my taste, the walnuts marry with cranberries better.

I really liked it.  I doubled the recipe as we wanted to eat it alone as a no meat dinner.  Added a diced jalapeño and a little extra on the cranberries and toasted almonds.  We also sprinkled with olive oil on individual servings and some feta cheese on top.  We are a household with Celiac issues so we are very glad to have such tasty recipes. Thanks AllRecipes.com.

Love love love love love. I made it hot rather than cold (sauteed all the veggies) and used cashews instead of almonds (because I'm a cashew freak). Did I mention I love this recipe?

I made this and thought it was very good with a few modifications: I always cook my quinoa 2 parts liquid to 1 part quinoa, and did so for this recipe with chicken stock. I didn't care for the carrots in this recipe. I also added olive oil. Next time I make it I will make a lime vinaigrette with garlic so the salad isn't as dry. Love the combination of the cranberries with the quinoa, veggies, almonds and cilantro.

Amazing! I've been looking for a recipe like this for a while! I changed the ingredients to what I had on hand and the proportions were probably different because I kinda just threw  the ingredients together and adjusted the taste to my preference but that's part of the beauty of this recipe, you can adjust the ingredients easily. I had raisins and crunchy mango instead or cranberries, and just used red bell pepper instead or red and yellow. I also used a lot more curry powder and added olive oil and apple cider vinegar to make it a bit richer.

Made a quadruple batch of this for a party and everyone raved about how good it was. It was perfect for the 90F degree day and tasted so light and fresh.  I didn't add quite as much Quinoa as stated but opted for a bit more veggies and nuts. Turned out amazing!

A friend of mine is a private chef. He had a party that he was cooking for and a few of the people were vegan. I helped him out and made this as a side dish.  It was the hit of the 28 people dinner party. Definitely make it the day before.

This is great salad. Quick and tasty. Made it already 3 times, and getting ready to make it for New Years party. 1st time made it as called for, it was delicious. Next time I have added extra veggies, or protein like shrimps or grilled chicken. May family loved it, also great for those who are watching their calories intake.

I loved the mix of flavors and how healthy this dish is. I forgot to buy the almonds so had to sub pecan pieces and it still tasted great. It is also a very pretty and colorful dish that I am going to keep in mind to bring to next potluck!

Whst a find! Took it to a party last night and got tons of compliments. The host asked to keep the leftovers, and my boyfriend asked me to make it again asap. I followed some of the advice and made a few minor alts: used half the red onion, 1 tsp curry and 1/2 tsp cumin instead of all curry, added 1/4 cup olive oil, and added 2-3 Tbls cider vinegar.

Made this for a pot luck and everyone loved it, along with requests for the recipe. I made only a few changes: omitted the onions, used 1 tsp of curry rather than 1.5 tsp; added the zest of the lime and 2 tbs of olive oil. Would definitely make it again!

I made dinner for my girlfriend and we all really enjoyed this recipe. The only change I made was adding shredded chicken (from a store bought roasted chicken). It served beautifully as the main dish and I accompanied it with the avacado and cilantro salad.  This dish is very colorful and I think it would make a great addition to a Thanksgiving table.

Made this for 24 servings for a camping trip and it was definitely a lot of work! With that being said, the hard work paid off and was well worth it!! Everyone loved this salad including myself. I'd never had quinoa before and what a wonderful introduction! Just a beautiful salad full of color and lots of flavor! Perfect!

This is delicious when prepared as written. I prefer it with a little bit of olive oil. I mix together the lime juice and curry with about a tablespoon of olive oil and then mix into the salad. I have also made it with 1/2 cup crumbled feta, which is yummy.

Less cilantro. I made this for a party quadrupling the recipe. Overall it was good but the cilantro overpowered the flavors. I would make it again with a fraction of the herb.

I really liked this one. You can adapt the base recipe to what you have on hand. I used toasted pine nuts and didn't have the peppers and it was still great!

For everyone who has commented that it is too dry - cook the quinoa in 2 cups of liquid. I'm relatively new to cooking quinoa but every other recipe I've seen, and the directions on the back of the bags, say 2 cups liquid to 1 cup quinoa. Otherwise, I followed the directions, except I didn't have a red onion so I sliced a couple of leeks very thinly and added them when I cooked the quinoa.

My family thought it had too much cilantro, although I liked it. You might want to cut back a little if you aren't used to raw cilantro. Next time I'd double the almonds (I like the crunch) and double or triple the cranberries. The latter really give the salad sweetness.

I added more bell pepper, almonds, and cranberries than called for but left out the carrots as I didn't have any. Totally loved it, though next time I might combine the lime juice with a little walnut oil and seasonings for the dressing.

I'm so in love with Quinoa and its versatility. I like everything in this salad except curry and cilantro, so I went light on both. Still it didn't appeal to my palate. Just can't put my finger on why. Looks gorgeous in the bowl.

I love this recipe. I didn't have carrots or almonds, but it was amazing without it. I love the curry flavor with the craisins and cilantro. I would have never thought this combo would be so delicious. I'm a big cilantro fan, so there was not too much for my taste.

this.is.phenomenal. I doubled all of the veggies, except the onion. the only thing i think that could have made it better is if my lime wasn't so bitter...even with a bitter lime, it was wonderful!

Loved the taste.  Forgot the curry.  Not sure if I'll even add it next time since the taste was so good.

Make sure you chop everything very fine or you don't get all the flavors in one bite.

Wow, this is good. I used cilantro mini-cubes in the water in which I cooked the quinoa instead of fresh cilantro (which I didn't have). It was quite de-lish!

I got many compliments on this and requests for the recipe. Reading the reviews is always helpful. I rinsed the quinoa as suggested first, cooked it with chicken boullion, and left plenty of time for it to cool. Wish I would also have toasted the almonds ahead of time, so they had a chance to cool. I also used about 1/4 of the onion. It was plenty flavorful. Next time I think I will cut back on the curry a bit as well. Great way to sneak in some healthful fruits and vegetables.

I loved this recipe!  I think the blend of flavors is just perfect.  I had Turkish curry that a friend brought back from a recent trip so that was such a treat.  I no longer each pasta or rice -- quinoa is now my staple and this recipe will be repeated over and over.  Thank you!

This is an amazing recipe! The flavors all work together perfectly and it was a hit with my family! The cilantro, cranberrIes and almonds are delicious. I omitted the curry since we are not fans of it and it was still wonderful. I will make  it for company as well!

I took out the carrots, cooked the quinoa with chicken bouillon, and added olive oil. One of my favorite quinoa salads!

I will decrease the lime juice next time - it was a little overpowering. Also, I added a dash of sugar and cayenne pepper

This is a refreshing salad that is great for the summer. I left out the carrots (I dont like carrots) and only used red pepper because it was the only pepper that was reasonably priced at the grocery store. I also used lemon juice concentrate that I had in my fridge and the store did not have toasted almonds so I used the regular sliced almonds instead. I also mixed all of my ingredients together while the quinoa chilled (which didnt take very long at all). This salad is wonderfully refreshing. I think it would taste great with some lemon grilled shrimp but today I plan to grill some tilapia, which I think will complement this recipe quite well. I will definitely make this again.

This is the second time I've done  this recipe and my husband and I love it.  The only thing that I've notice is that is very dry.  The only liquid for all these ingredients is the juice of one lime.  Has anybody added any additional liquid ingredients, like maybe olive oil?

This is delicious!  I used less than half a small red onion and it was almost too much!  Start with less and add more if you like.  Definitely must sit in fridge for a while to get full flavor.

Loved it! Will make it again for sure, I would suggest to add a bit of sugar which will balance well with the hotness in curry powder.

I love this recipe.  I've made it several times now.  It is always a huge hit at my dinner parties.  The flavours are amazing.  If you make it the night before and chill in the fridge, the flavours are even better the next day. Thanks for sharing!

Love it.  I added more lime. I like to juice my lime with a garlic press and some of the lime pulp adds a nice pop of flavor.  Added some cinnamon and cumin.  I added more almonds and cranberries also.  Fantastic flavor.

I made this recipe this morning. I LOVED it and cant wait to tasted it again tomorrow.  Most of the comments suggest that it improves with age. After trying it out I decided to use this as tonight's evening meal. I added a cup of cooked black beans (to increase to protein and mineral content) that were in my fridge and awaiting a home. It looks great and tastes wonderful. Added a little ( one scant TBSP) grape seed oil and I am good to go!
Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe. Having the video helped me not skip steps or ingredients. 
Thanks again!

I must have done something terribly wrong with this recipe, although I followed it to a "t"?  The curry powder and red onions ruined it for me (and I am a huge fan of both). I would halve both of those ingredients if I decide to try this recipe again. I had to throw the entire bowl away.  Dissapointed!

Fantastic, made it exactly as written, loved the flavors, I'm sure you could mix up the veg as you like as long as you keep the lime, cilantro and curry powder. Very healthy too, big hit with everyone!

This is one of the best quinoa recipes out there. Something about the mix of cilantro, fresh lime, cranberries - really all of it - makes it so yummy!  I've made it for staff at my work and they ADORED it.  Many asked for the recipe. This will be a staple in my lunch.

This recipe is awesome! This was the first time we have ever prepared quinoa, and I must admit I was skeptical because I had never eaten quinoa either, but this will no longer be the case.  It has now become one of our top rated recipes at home.  I will be making this again!  Thank you for sharing!!!!

I like this recipe as a unique, healthy and bright side dish. As others suggested, I used vegetable stock instead of water. I also cooked the quinoa in 2 cups of liquid (according to package directions) instead of 1 1/2 cups. I think that might make a difference in the moistness.  I agree that it tastes better after 24 hours, except that the almonds get mushy.  I would suggest that you let it sit, refrigerated, at least overnight, but hold the toasted almonds until serving.  I used celery instead of carrots, only because I don't particularly like carrots.

Wonderful variation on a cold quinoa salad.  Had to use dried cilantro :( instead of fresh, matchstick carrots and slivered almonds.  Used far less curry (about half if that) and ended up adding feta cheese which may have helped fill the flavor void left from the lack of fresh cilantro.  This is an outstanding and different dish for potlucks, luncheons or summer picnics.  Thank u for sharing!

Very delicious! I use this as a lunch salad with chicken breast or albacore tuna. I omitted the cilantro and used chopped black walnuts & sliced scallions instead of the sliced almonds & red onion. I also added some extra Madras hot curry powder to my taste and steamed the quinoa. Otherwise, I didn't change a thing. I really like that it is low in sodium and fat. Thanks for sharing.

Very nice, but most definitely must be served the second day to fully appreciate the flavours.  Just looking at the ingredient list told me olive oil would greatly improve this recipe, so I added chopped garlic and fresh mushrooms to olive oil in a sauté pan, threw in the peppers and carrots, and heated just long enough to make the vegetables sweat.  A dash of Greek feta dressing tied it all together.  You are missing out if you omit red onion, cilantro, or curry.  Not just healthy and flavourful, but also beautiful on your plate.

This was good for a change of pace and a perfect side for work (where I took it as a side to BBQ pork sandwiches).  I would try another quinoa salad recipe the next time, though I did have a co-worker rave about it and ask for the recipe.  A great healthy alternative to the typical heavy side salads.

I made it cutting in half the cilantro... I'm not a big cilantro fan, and doubled the lime juice. Made it for a potluck, many asked for the recipe.

Excellent recipe! I took some of the other reviewers' recommendations and used half an onion instead of a whole one and used some olive oil to moisten everything. What I did was mix the veggies and almonds with the quinoa. In a small bowl, I whisked together the lime juice with 2 tbsp olive oil, curry powder, salt and pepper and poured it over the quinoa mixture. All the ingredients go so well together. I will be making this one often!

this was delicious for my first time with quinoa, second time I omitted the carrots and added celery instead. the celery gives it the crunch and a little different flavor, outstanding. the cranberries and the almonds (I toasted them first) put it over the top. Don't omit those, you'll lose a lot.

super nutritious dish with good flavor....but it seemed like it needed a little "something".  I added a couple tablespoons of olive oil and a bit of garlic powder.  That made it perfect for us! Even my finicky nephew liked it.

This is SO good!  It's even better the next day.  The only thing I changed was to add the curry to the water before boiling. It really infused the flavor of the curry.  I'm sure I'll be making this again.

I made it just as it was in the recipe and it was fabulous! Lots of flavor and great taste. I found myself trying to stop eating it before my guests arrived... and failing miserably! :-)

Fantastic.  Omitted cilantro b/c I didn't have any, and was delicious without it.  SO healthy, too.

I cooked as stated and it turned out amazing! My fiance isn't a huge fan of onions, so he requested less onion next time. Other than that, I will cook it the same next time I make it.

Fabulous! Many asked for this recipe and had wondered how to use Quinoa. Definitely a healthy keeper. Love the cilantro and cranberry interplay. I did add more lime juice as it seemed to absorb the original amount.

YUM!!So fresh and can be varied in so many ways. I too used chick. brother instead of water. Used red pepper, celery, carrot, garlic, had no cilantro on hand, but used a few green onions, some cuke, cumin, cayene pepper and curry powder. I omitted the cranberries. Instead of almonds I browned some pumpkin seeds. Bit of s&p at the end and juice of one lime:) Wil make again for sure. So many ways to fix this one.

A real keeper!  I added about three Tbsp. of mayo as it was a little dry (I may have cooked the quinoa a bit too long) but we all loved it.
