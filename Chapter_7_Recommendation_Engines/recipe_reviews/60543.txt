This is the type of tzatiki that I get in resuarants.  I have tried the other recipes, and even thought they are more authentic, they don't taste as good.  This recipe is simply incredible.  I am a garlic lover and have been in heaven for the three weeks since I discovered this recipe.  I personally recommend Romainian feta, if you can find it.  I get it at a cheese speciality shop, its a little creamier, and cheaper.  I also add two cubes of frozen dill weed, available at most grocery stores.  The first time I made this I used 8 cloves of garlic, after all I have a very high threshold.  That was tooooo much, even for me, although I ate it all!  I am good at four cloves.  The processor seems to magnify the garlic taste, as does letting it sit overnight. I started with the "pulsing" mode in the processor, but I like the smooth texture, so now I use the "high" position. This is the perfect compliment to the "pork souvlaki" recipe on this sight (substitued with chicken breast though).  I have now completed my search for the perfect chicken-souvlaki with tzatiki combo, and I don't care about authenticity.

This was a great recipe, I think people are complaining because they expect tzatziki, but it's a completely different sauce.  I made it as is (minus the blender)and it was delicious.  I used it as a marinade for boneless, skinless chicken breasts and drumsticks for the kids.  I baked the chicken and put it under the broiler for the last couple of minutes to improve the colour, it was delicious.  I reserved some to use as dip with pita with the supper and topped the whole meal off with greek salad.  What a meal!  The kids and I finished the chicken and the dip off today with pita sandwiches, this is a keeper.  I'm giving it a 5 star for it's taste, easiness and versatility!

As a modification, I used 1 cup of sour cream instead of using the yogurt.  I used Mediterranean Feta cheese that has some extra flavors and 2 cloves of garlic.  I use a hand mixer instead of a blender and it is just as good.  very easy!

Excellent dish!!  note: to cure the "runny" aspect. you must drain the yogurt before blending it.  Just simply keep it in the container in comes in from the store, put paper towels on the top and turn it upside down.  The liquid will drain on the paper towels and magic magic you don't have anything "runny".  thanks for the great dish!

This dip is amazing and addictive. I brought some to work and all my co-workers lovved it.  The only thing I did different ( and I highly recomend it) was omit the salt & pepper and add lemon juice. I squeezed about 1/2 a lemon in the dip and it was fantastic. It really enhances the flavor of the garlic.

Oh my goodness, this is so good!  I can't eat sour cream right now, so I used a full cup of yogurt instead of half sour cream and half yogurt.  This makes it healthier but it's still creamy and delicious!

WOW!! I like garlic but I only used the 2 cloves as the recipe calls for and boy that is plenty. I am a Feta lover!! Can eat the stuff all by itself so that is why I made the recipe. I hate to say it but unlike most of the reviews I think next time I will use one garlic clove, I am more into the feta flavor. Very good though! This is already a favorite and I just made it today. I like it to because it's low carb and I eat it with veggies.

I took this to a family and friend gathering on the 4th of July.  The young adults especially  raved about this dip.  I served it with pita chips.  I used crumbed bleu cheese, crushed garlic from a jar, and just non-fat sour cream since the store where I was shopping had no unflavored yogurt.  I just mixed with a spoon--didn't get the blender out.  Very easy and very quick.  Thanks for the recipe.

This dip is GREAT!  I added the juice of 1/2 of a lemon as I saw others did.  I also read about it being runny so I put slightly less yogurt in it and the consistency was fine.  I also added a handful of fresh cilantro which gave it a really fresh flavor.  There were a couple people taken aback by the amount of garlic though.

I thought this was spectacular!  Dresses up veggies in a great way.  I used tomato basil feta and all fat-free sour cream (omitting the yogurt altogether).  I didn't experience the dip being too runny as others have commented on.  Made both assorted slices of bell pepper and Fritos taste amazing.  Thanks.

Delicious, and very garlic-y.  I served it at a party.  Good on Triscuits, veggies, pita, chicken . . . probably just about anything.

I originally rated it 4 stars because I forgot the garlic (duh). Now with the garlic, I can honestly say I love it! It's also so easy to make, and it makes a great snack!

This is an awesome recipe...whenever I make it, it's gone within the hour.  I do however add some green onion in it and sprinkle some on top for some color, for some reason it just looks unappetizing if it's just all white...other than that, I love this stuff and always save some for me when I make it, it makes an awesome sandwhich/pita spread...

Really simple and delicious (awesome with pretzel crisps!).  I more than halved the garlic and it was still garlicy!  Added 1 teaspoon of lemon as others mentioned and used light sour cream and fat free plain yogurt - seems pretty healthy!  Threw a few shakes of dried dill the next day for a different flavor - that was really good too.  I was super psyched to find all of the items already in my fridge!

I made this dip as is except added minced garlic instead of putting everything in a food processor.  I love that this dip includes things I usually have on hand, is easy to make, doesn't take much time AND tastes impressive.  Would be great as a dip for a veggie tray.  Will make again, possibly for an upcoming baby shower.

Delicious flavor. I did not use yogurt - only sour cream so it was a little thin. I had a lot left over so I sauted some bacon and mushrooms and added the left over sauce and combined to a simmer. Served it over pounded, sauted chicken breasts and mashed potatoes with a green side salad. Yum.

I personally did not care for this. It was way too strong. I added chopped parsly and minced cucumber like others suggested, which toned it down. I still did not care for it though.

Half the recipe is plenty!  I still used 2 garlic cloves.  Also used low gat yogurt, fat free sour cream and 25% less fat feta for a more healthy dip.  I added 1/2 the salt but would leave it out totally next time.  Cooked up kabobs of chicken and used some for basting and served the rest as a dipping sauce and served as an appetizer.  Also made some baked pita chips and these were great with the dip as well.

I made this for New Year's Eve and many guests wanted the recipe.  Don't change a thing about it.  If you love garlic, you will love this dip. I served it with pita chips and pita bread wedges.

This is the second holiday that we've had used this dip and it's a requested hit now... my son, age 20, even called me to get the recipe... which may be only 1 of 5 total recipes in his recipe box as of now.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good.  Didn't have any problems with it being runny.  I used non-fat yogurt, light sour cream and low fat feta cheese.  Served with pita chips, carrots and cucumbers.  Very tasty!

I'm addicted, Give it 10 stars. I was afraid of it being runny so I changed it a little.  I used 1 block garlic cream cheese, 1/2 cup mayo, pepper mixed all together then folded crumbled feta in so it still had chunks in it.  Stuffed little pitas that were cut in half.

I thought it tasted ok but was too runny. Maybe it would be better if it was not put into the blender and just mixed together.

The taste was good and everyone liked it (I served it with a veggie tray and white tortilla chips), but I thought it was a little too runny.  I used a fat-free creamy yogurt, so maybe that was the problem.  I ended up adding more feta cheese to compensate, but even so, the texture was a little too thin. UPDATE: I recently made this again using fat-free Greek yogurt, and it was great. 5 stars this way. :)

Had to bring a last minute appie to friends, but because of snow, didn't want to venture to the grocier.  All ingredients for this dip are staples in my house, so whipped it up, adding a touch of minced basil.  Fabulous!  Gobbled up at party, and three people asked for recipe.

This recipe is so good. I sub Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and sometimes add more garlic.

Very good! I used greek yogurt for a thicker consistency and upped the garlic to a little more than 3 cloves and it came out great! Served it as a dip with carrots and crackers at a party, then used the leftovers to top chicken gyros at home. If you like a lot of garlic and feta- you're sure to love this!

I made this recipe to take to a girl's night potluck for about 20 women. I was looking for something inexpensive using what I had, which included a large tub of feta from a wholesale club. I omitted the yogurt and used 8 oz. reduced fat sour cream. To spice things up a bit, I added a small seeded jalapeno, the juice of one lemon, and a handful of the last herbs from the garden (basil, oregano, etc.). Mixed everything with an immersion blender and served with crackers, red bell pepper strips & baby carrots. When I tried it, I thought it to be a bit bland, but everyone else RAVED about it. I served this right after making it but think it would be even better after refrigerating for a few hours to meld the flavors.

Awesome dip, great with vegetable slices or crackers, or spread on bread. Next time I'm going to put it on Italian bread slices and broil it for a couple minutes.

Fantastic!  Made this by putting everything in the food processor and processing until it was the constancy I wanted, super easy and I made in a few days in advance to let the flavors blend!  Great with veggies, crackers and pita chips!  Will make again!

Yum! Used twice as much garlic and advice watching the salt if your feta is salty. I added some hot pepper flakes to liven it up. Great dip for veggies or pita, or if you're worried about vampires.

I've made this for several different parties, always to rave reviews.  Love how simple and relatively healthy it is.  It doesn't taste super garliky as you're making it, but the garlic flavor really comes out after it has rested for a bit.  Don't make the same mistake I did the first time I made this and add extra garlic because it doesn't seem strong enough - just be patient; it will come!  I've also added a little basil and cilantro, and a few red pepper flakes when making this a couple times - that seemed to really kick it up a bit.

Made it exactly as written and loved it!  It's got all the flavors I love and is so easy to make. I used this to line some pita pockets and filled them with veggies, but of course it would be fantastic when used as a dip as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!! I doubled everything but the garlic, and added some Greek seasoning, parsley and dill.  I also strained my yogurt with coffee filters and a wire strainer the night before so it was nice and thick.  I served with crudite veggies and pita chips.  Everyone raved and asked for the recipe.

So many things you can do with this and its quick and easy!    I doubled the yogurt and omitted the sour cream.  Consistency was fine but I had drained on paper towel as another poster suggested.  I used 3 cloves which was a bit too strong for me.  Still the extra flavor "bite" was addicting.  I also added fresh spinach, cilantro, and green onion.  The spinach and cilantro gave it a beautiful green color.

Words can't describe how good this is.  I only used a cup of plain, low fat yogurt and skipped the sour cream all together - also I reduced the feta to 3/4 cup.  I'm guilty of loving dip with my veggies but I don't even feel guilty with this.

I made this recipe and I was quite suprised to find that the result tastes like another dip we make in my country (Greece), known as tzatziki. It is made of yogurt, cucumber (cut in small pieces) and garlic. It seems to me that garlic covered the taste of feta, making the two dips taste so alike. Still, good recipe!

I made this sauce as a side with pork souvlaki and rice pilaf.  My wife and I absolutely loved it.  It was a perfect marriage in flavors.
We also sliced up some cucumbers and tomatoes and dipped them for a spectacular and somewhat healthy appetitzer.  Great recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I really rate this at 4-1/2 stars. I love garlic and used 3 cloves but maybe that was a bit much (they were on the large side). I also strained my plain yogurt (to make yogurt cheese) before using, which I believe made this thicker then others reviews. I also added 1/4 of a minced/seeded cucumber and juice from half a lemon. Due to liking things spicy, I also added about a tsp of cayenne pepper & added some dried cilantro & snipped fresh chives. I think this would be great on Gyros sandwiches vs the cucumber sauce you get. I used a stick blender to incorporated everything but think it might be good too if crumbled Feta is added last for a more chunky result. Also, NO salt necessary as Feta has quite a salty taste as is. I've been eating it with toated pita bread chunks but this would make a good greek salad dressing if it's too thin for dip. Thanks for the great idea and something you can play with to your liking!

It had great flavor, but no one touched it at my party. It was way too runny & thin & didn't make a great dip. I would probably try it as a sauce to some Greek pork or chicken entrees, as recommended by some others. As far as a dip or appetizer goes, it was a flop, at least for me.

I used low-fat feta and was a little worried how this would turn out, but it had a nice creamy texture and made a great dip for raw vegetables.  Next time I'm going up to four cloves!

i omitted the salt and pepper and used the juice of half a lemon. i chopped in lots of fresh dill, and voila:  it was delicious.  served with cherry tomatoes, cucumber sticks and plain ruffles.   would be amazing as tzatziki too.  great recipe.

Good.  I added 3-4 garlic cloves, can't remember exactly (was drinking wine)  :)
Very garlicky, I think I prefer something thicker. Probably will make again but will try others from this site also.  Thanks,

I used drained Greek yogurt and  bottled chopped garlic as suggested. I also omitted the salt and pepper and instead added the juice of half a lemon and fresh dill. This recipe was a hit and I have been asked to bring it to meetings and get togethers frequently.

I agree with the other posters. Dont need extra salt, its salty on its own. I'm going to add some chopped cukes to tune it down, and am serving it tonight with chicken gyros. It is runny, but I'm not using it as a dip, more like a sauce, so its ok.

This dip is fantastic with fresh vegetables! I made one small change which is that I had a whole head of garlic to use so I roasted it in the oven which made the garlic a little sweeter and more mellow. If you want more feta flavor that's a good option.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was I thought it was pretty salty.  I think next time I definitely will omit any extra salt since I think feta is salty enough on its own. Overall, delicious though and gets better after sitting overnight.

This recipe is amazing. I would have been happy to sit down and eat up the entire bowl. I made it as a dip for pita chips to have on Easter Sunday. The only changes I made was to drain the yogurt in a coffee filter over night and also to add a tablespoon of dried oregano. The result was yummy!!

This is awesome! Took other reviewers advice and used to marinate chicken then grilled. mmmm! Did use less garlic to suit our taste and added a little dill. Also served with toasted pita and cucumbers as others did.

I don't know if you would say I used one or two cloves.  I used one, but it was the size of my thumb.:)  I used 1 cup of sour cream, no yogurt, and added 1 tsp of italian seasoning.  Excellent is all I can say.

This was incrediably tasty. I used lowfat sour cream and yogurt and halved the recipe, but kept the 2 cloves of garlic. That was the perfect amount for me and my hubby. Served it with the Pita Chips off this site and cucumber rounds......... fantastic! It would pair really well with some falafel and I can't wait to try that.

I made this dip because I love garlic & I love feta! I enjoyed everything about this recipe. However, my roommates & my fiance didn't care for the flavor of it at all. I easily could've eaten all of this, but thought better of it. Instead I used 3/4 of the dip as a marinade for chicken breasts. Left them in the dip overnight & had my fiance grill it up for dinner. Everyone else seemed to enjoy the dip much better that way! I will make again to use as a dip for myself & a marinade for anyone else!

I took this dip to a party tonight and listened to a lot of "Whoa, there's a lot of garlic in this" comments.  People ate it and enjoyed it, but I'm going to roast the garlic next time to mellow it out or use just a single clove.  Easy and fast to whip up as a last minute offering to guests.

I didn't have yogurt on hand so I used all sour cream instead.  I replaced the salt and pepper with an all pupose Greek seasoning and it was perfect. I made this as a dipping sauce for  chicken kabobs, and it was the perfect thickness for that.

Just made this for the first time--it was an instant favorite.  I omitted the sour cream and a full cup of low-fat yogurt.  As other reviewers suggested, I added some lemon juice (1 Tbs.).  This is SO good!

This was excellent!  I did not use a food processor for this, so mine has a bit of chunky texture (which I love), and to get a stronger garlic flavor I grated the garlic.    I added a bit of dried marjoram, Greek oregano and basil as I thought it could use a bit more "herby" flavor, but this was delicious as is, too!

A treat! I used about 3/4C Greek yogurt (no need to drain as it's thick enough) in place of yogurt/sour cream, then a good amount of dill. The 2 garlic cloves really overpowered the dip over time. Next time I'll reduce to 1, and also press before adding to the processor. The blade didn't do a good job of pulverizing.

I would like to share one tip about the garlic. I am a garlic lover too but recently found out from a mexican friend that if you slit the garlic in the middle and take out its "heart" that greenish lining and than use it, it doesnt taste that strong and I have tried it you dont even have that aftermath of garilc. Loved this recipe. Thanks !!!

GREAT recipe!  Espcially when you are looking for something different and low-carb.  The only suggestion I have, make sure you have some gum handy for afterwards!  Ha!  Def gives you the garlic breath!

this was okay. feta was a little too strong and i didn't feel like it had much garlic flavor.

also - makes a big portion, could probably cut in half. probably won't make again.

Very good, especially for a healthier dip!  It reminds me of fatty parmesan peppercorn dressings I have had - I could use it as a dip, condiment, or as salad dressing.  I used lowfat feta and nonfat yogurt and it was still great, I added a tsp or so of greek seasoning though.

I thought this was a great dip for a warm summer day. It was very refreshing and light.  I wish it had a bit more zip so I added tomato basil feta and a few extra seasonings.

This was delish!  I was afraid of the "runnyness" so I added a bit more sour cream, and also added the juice of 1/2 a lemon.  I enjoyed this more with the pita chips, but it was also good with fresh veggies.  Definitely a keeper!

I add a least 1 T. of dill weed to give this more color. I think next time I won't blend the mix so that the feta chunks are more visible. I served with cucumbers, carrots, broccoli and crackers.

Mine was a little grainy, maybe because I used low fat sour cream and yogurt.  It was good with souvlaki.
