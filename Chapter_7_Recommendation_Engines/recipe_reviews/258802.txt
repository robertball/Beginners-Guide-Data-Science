Opps! First review got cut short. I was about to write that I add a bit of minced grated ginger to the tea. And the pepper is a must to give the best of turmeric s healing properties to the drink. Great hot or cold.

This was interesting. I could taste the black pepper at the back of my throat nice little kick.
