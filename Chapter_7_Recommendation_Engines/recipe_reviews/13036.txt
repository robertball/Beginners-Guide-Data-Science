You know, I've been visiting allrecipes.com since I was a wee lad of 17 years old. Currently, I'm a wee lad of 22 years old, heh. However, never ONCE have I felt the urge to rate/review a recipe (even become a member) until I tasted this. I'm from the good 'ol South, so I've made PLENTY of split pea soup. It replaced Ramen noodles during my college years. I've recreated almost every split pea recipe on this site; I even created a few variations of my own. THIS recipe, though, beats the split peas outta EVERY recipe I've made. I followed the recipe verbatim, except for a few small changes. I used one stalk of celery instead of leaves and real garlic instead of granulated. I also whisked in the cream cheese instead of blending it (no ugly color, just magically delicious green-ness). All the reviewers who have stated this recipe isn't for them, well, they just didn't make it correctly. MAKE IT. EAT IT. You won't regret it.

I've used this recipe several times and am never dissapointed.  I have been asked to share the recipe many times.  Thanks for posting it!  FYI to all - the recipe calls for 2.5 cups of peas - that's a 16oz. bag.

Very Good!  I liked this recipe because of the cream cheese--I was looking for something creamy.  I omitted the ham, just because we didn't have any.  I used 5 c. chicken stock & 3 c. water to add more flavor (instead of all water).  And I sauteed the garlic and onion (white onion) in olive oil while I chopped up the carrot.  I like the flavor of sauteed onions and it also is easier to digest.

In the end it was delicious and very cheap.  ;-)  I will make this again, especially during the winter.

This recipe was just O.K.. The flavor was traditional pea soup. The problem was after pureeing, it was so visually unappealing. It might be pretty good with just stirring in the cream cheese without blending the soup. I think there are better pea soup recipes out there. I'll keep searching.

My husband said that this was the best pea soup he's ever had and I think I have to agree. What I did was after I heated the first set of ingredients to boiling, tossed it in my slow cooker and let it simmer to perfection when it came time to eat!

My husband kept asking me to make split pea soup and I never have because I have never made a soup from scratch.  This soup was easy and terrific.   My husband loved it and said that this recipe is a keeper.

hi- we tried this recipe, it was pretty good. I used a smaller bit of cream cheese - roughly one third of the eight ounces, cause I'm skimpy when it comes to things like cream cheese. Actually i'd rather use the cheese on crackers with salt. So, to compensate, if you want creamy, add two TBS of cornstarch mixed in 1/4 cup of water. Add hot soup to the bowl of cornstarch water and stir well. Then add to the hot soup. This makes the texture of the soup much smoother and refined. It doesn't end up looking like cement sludge, if you catch my drift. It actually has a sheen like restaurant soup. And old family tradition- we add a tbs of ketchup to serve, but not mix in. All in all, a decent soup!

Pretty darn good!  I substituted some water with chicken broth and only used half the cream cheese.  Also didn't put it in the blender, I like it a little chunky.  Very good for someone who always ruins pea soup!

This soup is wonderful.  I blend about 3/4 of the pot and leave the rest.  I'm the only one in my family that eats this soup so I usually give some to friends.  They're always asking when I'm going to cook another ham so I can make more soup for them.

I am not a pea soup fan but this is one of the best soups I've ever made (and I have made lots of fabulous soups).  It is a perfect harmony of flavors.

This soup was exceptional, tasty and delicious. The only changes I made were to omit salt, put it all in a slow cooker from the start, use ham stock (leftover Easter ham bone, thanks Mother for boiling the bone for me), and gently saute the garlic, onion, and celery before putting it in the pot. Also, no pureeing required... it cooked overnight on low and was perfect, we just put the cubed cream cheese in an hour before we turned off the slow cooker. As a spring meal with miniature sandwiches, a small bowl is plenty. Great way to use up extra ham as well. )

Wonderful on a cold blustery night. Its comfort food at its best. I know its good when my daughter wants it in her lunch for shcool the next day. However d onot make the mistake of using low fat/fat free cream cheese, it changes the taste for the worse. Also make sure and use quality ham hocks, I have used pre-packaged and i tturned out bland. I do try and always make it a day ahead to let the flavors marry, it is even better a day or two after the cook day.

This is "thinner" than other split pea soups I have made before, but it is smoother and creamier where others are much thicker.  I'm thinkng it will be the perfect consistency on the second day.  We shall see. I didn't have any carrots or celery so I substituted frozen carrots and peas from a bag and celery salt.  I also tossed in one chicken bouillon cube 'cause I like to live life on the edge. Turned out yummy!

This was the best pea soup EVER!!  I blended only half the soup and it was fantastic.  I will make this again and again.  Even my husband who doesn't really like pea soup told me not to bother freezing leftovers as there wouldn't be any left, and there wasn't!!

Substituted pork roast for ham bone and neufchatel cheese for cream cheese. Was runnier than we expected.

I liked this soup, after reading the other reviews I decided to only puree about half of the soup and then add it back in to the pot. It had a very nice flavor and I liked the addition of the cream cheese.

This is the best split pea soup ever!  Very easy.  I used 7 cups water and 1 can of chicken broth, cut the cream cheese into the soup and let it melt there.  It is sooo creamy and smooth.  Nice looking too.  I would add more carrots next time too.

This soup was yummy but it is better if you do it all the day before, it's very time consuming, having to cook and then blend in the cream cheese.  It was also very heavy.  I agree with the light cream cheese.

It tasted ok, if you like cream cheese.  It's almost too creamy though.  It's not a pleasant looking dish. You should use low cal cream if you intend to cook it, since there is so many calories in a serving.
