This dip was such a hit at our last get together!  Based on other reviewers comments about it being a little oily, instead of the 2 cups of mayonaise, I put a block of softened low-fat cream cheese and 8-oz of low fat sour cream into a 2-cup measuring cup and topped it off with mayonaise to make 2 cups.  I also used sweet Vidalia onions.  This was so-o-o good!!

AWESOME - AWESOME!  JUST TASTED THIS DIP AT A NEIGHBORHOOD OUTTING, BUT IT WAS MADE WITH 2 CUPS EACH OF VIDALIA ONIONS, MAYO AND SWISS CHEESE.  PAPRIKA ON TOP FOR COLOR. I DON'T LIKE SWISS AT ALL, BUT YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED IT.  SERVED WARM WITH TORTILLA CHIPS.  :-)

I have made this dip for several gatherings and it's always well received.  I've experimented with how big to cut the onions and a medium chop seems to work best.  I've found that the dip doesn't really reheat well--tends to separate.  A great recipe though.  Very quick and easy to make and absolutely delicious!

This was great Noreen! - The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars, what that the onions were a little 'undone'...

I did make a 2nd time and sauteed the onions on medium heat for about 10 minutes. I also added red pepper flakes.

RAVE REVIEWS!!! So easy, so delicious! Definitely a pleaser!

A bit on the oily side for my taste. However it was very tasty. I used Vidalia onion and green onion. I think I'll try this again to see if half mayo and half sour cream cuts the oiliness. Thanks Noreen.

JUST A LITTLE TIP: if you over cook any dip that is creamy and cheesy the oil will seperate, so keep a close eye on them when there almost done

Oh my goodness! A recipe couldn't be more delicious or simple.  My guests almost licked the bowl clean....... I mixed it up the day before a dinner and just popped it in the oven before my guests arrived.  Thanks for sharing.

Dont you just hate when people say... "Well, I changed this and I changed that and it was just okay for me - then they give it a bad rating?" Yeah, I hate that too.

This was a great dip! Simple, quick and delicious. Thank you so much :)

I made this as a Thanksgiving appetizer.  I used 1 c. mayo, 8 ounces cream cheese, 1 c. parmesan cheese and 2 c. onions.  I didn't have enough parmesan cheese and the recipe turned out great!  Everyone loved it and could not stop eating it!

This is such a hit! I am asked to bring it back over and over. I like to carmelize the onions before adding to the mayo. & cheese & then bake the dip in a crusty bread bowl.  Don't overcook and you'll have virtually no oil!

This is so easy and can be changed easily by adding any of the following:  crab meat, copped artichokes in water or chopped sun dried tomatoes.  All are great additions.

We've used this recipe to demonstrate the family farm's sweet onions at markets and trade shows. The recipe really needs very sweet onions, such as Vidalia, WallaWalla, PA Sweets, etc. The recipe takes well to low-fat mayo, and we often use grated low-fat Jarlsberg mixed with a little Parmesan. A teaspoon or more of a no-salt herb blend (such as Ms Dash, Spike, etc) really jazzes up the flavor. Just blot off any fat that rises to the surface. We've had people ask to buy the extra pans of dip. Sells a lot of onions!! And if there are any leftovers, it makes a great scalloped potato casserole addition.

I used Jarlsberg cheese instead of Parmesan, and it was fantastic!  I only heated it for 20 minutes until it was soft and gooey - perfect!

This was a HUGE disappointment.  Because of the obvious fat content, I used low-fat mayo and low-fat swiss. I still ended up using a good 12-14 paper towels to soak up part of the grease it produces.  (Not all, just part!)  After all that effort, the flavor is NOT that great.  It was a terrible disappointment, and I certainly will not make it again!  Sorry.

I have made this recipe many times but on a loaf of french bread split in half, then cooked in the oven until bread is toasted and spread is melted and golden. Never thought to use it as a dip ;-)  Great on bread too!!! Always a favorite at any get together!

This is awesome. I was looking for the actual recipe of something my sister-in-law makes. However, she uses red onions instead of vidalia. Also, she mixes the ingredients, puts a dollop onto sliced french baguette bread and then bakes it. This solves the grease problem because the bread absorbs the oil and it makes the bread extra crunchy and tasty. YUM YUM YUM!

This is good, but as previously mentioned it is an oil producer.  That doesn't really detract from the taste, but I might try cream cheese instead of mayo next time.  Plus, I only had a white onion, so since I used 1 cup of the other ingredients I used 3/4 cup of onion.

I made this for a "couples" shower.  Everyone loved this.  I served it with crackers.  I chopped the onions in medium-sized bits (as was recommended in another review).  This recipe is very quick and easy to make.  I definitely plan to use this recipe again!

We loved this although we did make only enough for six people it was still amazing. I used the exact proportions for fewer people and cooked for 20 minutes. Even after that short a time there was a ton of oil. I just poured off as much as possible. Because of that I'm not sure I would make it again. Thanks.

While this dip is a little on the greasy side, my friends sure didn't mind!  It disappeared while other appetizers went half-eaten.  Will definitely make again!

I made this for a holiday party...it was a big hit!  Tastes great hot or cold.  I made a full batch for the party and a small single-serve batch a few days later...very easy to make both times.

I halved the recipe for a small group and used reduced fat olive oil mayonnaise.  I also found I was out of parmesan, so I used cheddar.  It was still wonderful, gobbled up by everyone, and not greasy in the slightest.

WOW  Is this stuff heaven or what?   After the first time I added a teensy pinch of nutmeg that helped make the flavors even better.  I do catering, and this has become something that I will make often.  Easy.  Make to come out of the oven just as the party starts and keep warm in a chafing dish as long as it lasts. (always gone, no matter how much I make).

This is an easy dip to make with few ingredients that are usually on hand.  I recommend cutting it in half if there are just two of you. I also used half fresh, grated Parmesan half Kraft Parmesan. My husband and I felt pretty guilty after eating the whole batch.  It is a bit greasy.  But, it is very, very good.  Next time, I might try to add some cream cheese to the mix.  I think you'll like this dip if you love onions.

I made this when trying to get rid of several pounds of onions.  I used 2 large sweet onions, which was probably more than called for, but it was still pretty good.  I also subbed a cup of sour cream for one of the cups of mayo.

Not the flavors I was looking for.  It lacked something.  I found another recipe with swiss cheese in it also and THAT was what I was looking for.  So I won't be making this one again.

This is great as a dip but I took it and added imitation crab meat plus a little Tony Chacherie's.  Then I baked some fish coated with Italian bread crumbs and served the fish with the "dip" on top.  AWESOME!

So yummy!!  I did a little variation to utilize the ingredients I had on hand.  I halved the recipe, used yellow onions (finely chopped) rather than sweet onions, and replaced a 1/4 of the mayo with cottage cheese.  Instead of all parmesan, I used half parmesan and half shredded cheddar.  I baked it in a pie pan, and my husband and I ate ALL of it with saltines.  Yum!  It was a bit greasy, but not swimming in it.  I think you just have to expect some grease when you're dealing with any baked mayo-based dips.

I love simple and flavorful dips!  Three ingredients with simple measurements makes this easy all around.  Some reviewers said they used the powdered parmesan, but don't do that.  Use real parmesan and grate it yourself or buy the shredded.  Wheat thins were great for dipping.  The only thing I disliked was the grease.  I will make it again (and might even add a little swiss as well).

I have made this dish three or four times. It is so tasty it gets devoured when I make it for guests. I know it has a ton of calories, so I tend to make it when I know others will be eating it, otherwise I would eat most of it myself.

My guests really like this, but I thought it was AWFUL. It was swimming in grease. I used half the amount of onion called for, and to me the onion flavor was just right. I will not make this again.

After reading most reviews, I to made changes. I used (1) 8oz cream cheese, 1 cup sour cream, and 1/2 cup mayo.  I made this for a birthday party. Most people were reluctant to try it, but once they did, they couldn't stop eating it. Some even put it on their hotdogs! A big hit, will make again!

Very tasty and sweet. I chopped the onions in a hand crank food processor to get the peices small enough. They cooked right through in the oven and weren't crunchy. Makes for bad breath, but I would make it again for sure.

I followed the earlier advice given and substituted 8 oz of cream cheese, and then added a little paprika on top when it was done.There was nothing left ! A tip - put the onions in a food processor for a perfect consistency! Can not wait to make this again!!

Excellent appetizer recipe!  Fast, delicious and I have received more requests for this recipe than any other when I've taken it to parties.  I have even zapped it in the microwave when I was short on time.

This was TERRIBLE!!!  The mayo just left unseasoned (with the exception of saltiness from the parmesan) baked onion sitting in a huge pool of oil.  I can see playing with this and using cream cheese instead of mayo, maybe adding crab or something.  This was a waste of time and terrible.

Needed a few changes for my tastebuds but overall delicious. Too salty with the parm and mayo. I’ll try half cheddar, less mayo and a bit of water, and add some poultry herbs for more flavour next time.

Now who doesn't have onion, mayo and parm. cheese  in their kitchen.  So no excuses for making a simple and delicious appetizer!  I always use sweet onions, preferably Vidalia.  Every time I have made it, the whole dish disappears.  It is so good and easy.  Be sure to serve it while it is hot.  Goes well on crackers or toasted baguette  slices.

I make this with shredded cheddar. It's fabulous. Always a hit at a party.I dice the onions into small peices and I don't spray the pan. As for being "oily", I think that's what keeps it nice and smooth even after 2 hours out of the oven, if it lasts that long!

There is a good recipe in here somewhere, but this isn't quite it. I used grated parmesan cheese from a container, and the dip had a grainy texture and was also very greasy. It did taste good though. I tried the same recipe using swiss cheese, cutting back on the mayonnaise--texture was better, but was still very greasy. I may tinker with this some more--perhaps a mixture of swiss cheese and cheddar cheese with a sprinkling of parmesan on top, more onions, cutting back still more on mayonnaise and substituting sour cream or cream cheese?

I made this dip using the 8 oz cream cheese in exchange for 1c of the mayo. Also used only one cup of onions.  Turned out great.  Didn't take long to disappear both times that I've made it.

I thought this was a good tasting speedy dip to throw together. It had a nice mild onion cheesy creamy taste to it. I used all mayo before reading reviews and it is a little greasy. I blotted some up with a paper towel but I think next time I will do the 8oz of sour cream, a brick of cream cheese and enough mayo to equal the two cups. I used jarlsberg cheese for mine and it gave it a slightly sweet nutty flavor. I added a tiny bit of garlic salt and some cracked black pepper for more flavor. Good recipe! Thanks :)

Like many reviewers, I substituted 8oz of cream cheese for 1 c. of mayo.  I used fresh shredded parm from our deli, but I found the dish very salty.  I wonder if just using Kraft grated parmesan would be less salty.  Next time I might try substituting some swiss or provolone for half of the parmesan.  I liked this and while I wouldn't say it was a huge hit at our party, it was mostly gone.  I will  make this again, but I'll make a few changes to try to control the saltiness.

I was looking for an "easy" out for an hors d'oeuvre.  After planning and preparing a meal for quite a few, this was PERFECT!!!!

I did read the other reviews and tweaked the recipe a bit.

I cut the mayo in half and substituted cream cheese (8 ounces).  I also went a bit heavier on the onion as I am a sucker for onions.  

I also used fresh grated parmesan and romano mixed.  

Needless to say, this was D-LISH.

My guests loved it and I could have eaten the whole bowl myself..Thank God I didn't!!

Very few of my guests were thrilled with this dip.  I think I will try it again leaving out the mayonnaise and replace it with cream cheese and sour cream.

Yum!  I made 1.5x the recipe for a party.  Instead of all mayo, I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo (both FAT FREE).  Sprinkled in a little minced garlic because we like the flavor.  Served with scoop tortilla chips.  Good stuff!  Thanks for the recipe!
