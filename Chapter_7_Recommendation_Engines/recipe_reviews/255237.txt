I'm going to start this off with a disclaimer I'm more of a cook than a baker. That being said it would be helpful if the recipe indicated that butter should be softened or melted before mixing. I added a little water to the batter because it seemed really dry and that led to sticky cookies that burned on the bottom. I would say the amount of sugar in the recipe could be decreased as well. In short don't make the mistakes I did!

Our cookies turned out great. They were soft and they had crunchy edges. We decided to add chocolate which wasn't the greatest idea because it was too sweet. Other than that it was great.

I make these all the time for events and to bring to work on holidays. I only add a pinch of salt instead of the two teaspoons though. But people rave about them!

Recipe is simple. Cookies are soft with crunchy edges. 2teaspoons of salt is too much I will change it to 1 teaspoon next time to cut the salty taste (especially when dipped in milk)

Great recipe except there is a typo in the instructions. Tells you to add eggs twice instead of butter. 
Really easy and quick to make.
