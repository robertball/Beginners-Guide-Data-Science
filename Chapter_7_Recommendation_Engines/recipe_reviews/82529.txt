This has potential but if you make it as the recipe states, you will have a soggy, watery, unappealing dish to contend with.
I will try again but will not add the zuc. pulp back into the stuffing and will bake uncovered in the oven, finishing under the broiler.  The foil packet retains too much moisture.

I did this in the oven, and topped it with pepperjack cheese and bread crumd. Even my husband who doesn't care for stuffed squashes or vegatarian dishes really likes this.
