The dough was very difficult to work with. I tried putting in freezer for a while. Also, needs some other flavoring. Very bland. I tried lime jell-o for st. patrick's day. Maybe that was the problem.

Skip the egg white, but do sprinkle with sugar before baking or frost after cookies have cooled.  Strawberry gelatin makes a delicious cookie that tastes much like strawberry cake!  I'm in love.  :)

It was a great idea but the gelatin did not go well with the cookie. Also, putting the egg whites on top with the sprinkles was not good tasting.
