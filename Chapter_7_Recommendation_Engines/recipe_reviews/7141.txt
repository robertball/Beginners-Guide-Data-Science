My Breadman machine has a "batter breads" cycle...which means you can use this recipe without premixing ingredients...the whole cycle is 1 hour 40 minutes and does the mixing and baking.

I only bake with butter, and this bread was so yummy, I may have eaten half of it myself!!!  Great recipe and so much more moist than conventional loaf-pan baking.

Yum!  I substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce in place of the margarine to cut down the fat content & it still turned out great.  My husband & I have already polished off one loaf & I made a fresh one today.  Very good, very easy.

Excellent recipe. Used a Welbilt (ABMY2K1) with Quick cycle that
consists of a 3 minute Knead1, a 5 minute rest, a 5 minute
Knead2, and a 90 minute bake. Did not have to pre-mix, just
dumped in all of the ingredients. The bread cooked thoroughly
and was delicious.

Great, moist (with not too much fat), but my quick bread/cake cycle was over 4 hours!!!  Unlike the other reviews, it DID bake all the way through perfectly.  I might try just dumping it all in the machine next time.

The taste was good but cake sunk in the middle. It was probably not completely done.  Also, it was very crumbly and messy.  Any suggestions?

We used three defrosted overripe bananas (we store them in the freezer) and a cup or so of chopped pecans in this recipe and the bread came out delicious.  Our bread machine doesn't have "quick cycle/cake" so we baked at on "Bake" setting for about an hour and a half.  Enjoy!

We used unsweetened applesauce in place of the margarine and added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  It was well received at our dinner party!

This was rich in flavor. I made two minor changes to the recipe, just in case you wanted to try it. Instead of 2/3 cup of bananas i added two whole bananas... more banana flavor. I also changed 1 cup of sugar to 3/4 cup, and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Came out so good! Thanks for this recipe and take care.

this bread was pretty good.  i'm not sure yet whether i like it better than my aunt's recipe, but we still enjoyed it.  i used pecans instead of walnuts.  much more like a cake than bread, but still very delish.  i did not premix this before putting it in my bread machine.

Turns out perfect every time! I use it often and throw in whatever goodies I have on hand, too; coconut, flax seeds, sunflower seeds, dried fruit, PB and chocolate chips. Always yummy!

I did not pre-mix ingredients. The reason I use my bread machine is for quick and easy preparation and clean up. It still turned out great. I cut down on the sugar by about a 1/4c and next time I think I'll cut down on the salt, too. What a great way to make banana bread without heating up the kitchen in the summer!

I made this in my Breadman machine.  I used real butter instead of margarine and bread flour instead of all-purpose flour.  And I omitted the walnuts.  This is more like a banana cake and it is DELICIOUS! And So easy. If you are using the Breadman be sure to spray the inside with Pam first, to prevent sticking.  And I used the Bread Batter setting, put the wet ingredients in first and then the dry.  My kids love it and I had a hard time stopping myself from finishing the whole loaf!

I don't think I would use the bread machine for this next time. It wasn't done and I had to take it out and finish it in the regular oven anyway. Tasted great though, once it was done.

This bread was really delicious in the bread machine.  I tried 1lb first for testing, but there was not enough to go around because everyone loved it, so I ran out to get more bananas and will be doubling the recipe this time.   I didn't premix the ingredients as stated, I just mashed the bananas before putting them in, then placed all the ingredients as listed in my machine and it came out great. Also I added raisins instead of walnuts, but I'll try the walnuts next time. Very yummy.

I just wanted to make a note about Banana Breads not tasting banana-y enough. This usually has more to do w/ how ripe the bananas are not how many are used. They must be completely ripe, if not somewhat overripe, to get the appropriate flavour. 

I buy a couple bunches at a time, let them sit out until they're brown, not rotting, then break them into chunks and freeze the chunks. Then they're handy for everything from bread to smoothies to milkshakes.

My first bad review ever...I thought it was really to heavy and dense, took almost 2 hours to cook in my bread machine, even then the flavor was off, I think it's missing vanilla, didn't care for it at all, I also think the other recipe I use that calls for 1.5 cups of flour is better, not so brick-heavy...sorry, didn't do it for me..

I am a bread machine novice.  But this recipe was so fool-proof, I couldn't even manage to mess it up.  Like many others, I didn't pre-mix.  The bread machine took care of that and it turned out great.

Tasty banana nut bread recipe.  I don't have a bread machine so I mixed all the ingredients by hand used a large bread load pan and baked at 350 for 55 minutes.  

The only fresh nuts I had in the pantry were a trail mix that I got from the bulk aisle bins at the Whole Foods Market.  It had dried cherries, raisins, pecans, and almonds.  Measured out a 1/2 cup of trail mix, throwing in a few more cherries ;) seperated the mix out by hand and used heavy knife to coarse chop the pecans and almonds.  Then blanched the dried cherries and raisin in water for a few minutes so they could rehydrate, drained through collander, and then incorporated them into the batter towards the end of the mixing.  

Make sure to toast your nuts in a sautee pan over med high heat for about a minute first before mixing into the batter.  It brings out the oils in the nuts and intensifies their flavors.  You'll smell it.

Also I used 1/4 cup of margarine and a 1/4 cup of apple sauce to cut down on the fat without losing the buttery flavor. 

Lastly I used a Pillsbury Better for Bread flour instead of all purpose flour, gives it a good bread flavor with a cake like consistency in this recipe.

I love the heavy consistancy of this bread. I put my bread on quick cycle in my Oster Bread machine and just add all the ingrediants. except I use melted butter instead of margerine. If I have thawed frozen bannanas I can just add them in, if they are just over ripe I have to mash them first of the bread machine will not fully do the job. I also dont like nuts so never add them.

I added more banana then it called for so it needed to cook longer then my Maker setting.  Came out heavy but very moist and flavorful.

DO NOT USE WITH A PANASONIC YD250. My quick bake cycle is 30 minutes, which was not nearly enough time to bake the bread. I was going to run it for another cycle, but my machine will not run again until it has cooled. 
So I am sure this is a great recipe, but my machine has left me with  a half cook loaf :(

I made this recipe in my William-Sonoma machine on the "Quick Bread" cycle, and it came out perfectly cooked.  I didn't have quite enough banana (just one), so I mashed that with about 1/3 cup applesauce, and the result was fantastic!  Very moist without being sticky and not too sweet.  I also didn't find mine to be too cakey, as others have mentioned, perhaps because of the extra bit of applesauce.

This banana bread recipe was very good and very moist.  After I had mixed the ingredients, I realized my bread machine did not have a quick bread setting, but it did well in the oven at 350 degrees for approximately an hour.

Absolutely awesome!!! However I did have to substitute some things, due to me not having the proper ingredients on hand (my stupidity - thought I had the proper ingredients).

I used water instead of milk; 3 large over-ripe bananas (mashed), instead of 2/3 cup; and used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. When cooking the above, I used the full bread setting (Basic, Bake 3:20). With my machine I should have increased the time by 20 minutes; that way I wouldn't have had the doughy core (approx 2 1/2 inches). Still, it does taste incredible! You can substitute honey instead of the sugar (same measurements) that way it will have a cleaner, more natural taste. I left the walnuts out - I'm nuts enough! :-)

Very good recipe, my Breville breadmaker needed an additional 25 minutes to complete the bake cycle.  It's not explicit in the manual but the collapsible paddle should be down before starting.

Tasted great! I wasn't sure how it would turn out in my Breadman bread machine. It came out perfect. I used BatterBread setting and 1 pd loaf. I put the ingredients in order. The machine mixed everything for you and baked. It was so easy. I will make it again.

Awesome . The first thing i've made in forever where there was absolutely no complaints. My family and my friends loved it and so did I. I did have to bake it for about 3 hours in the bread maker though because the quick setting for 1 hour and 43 minutes wasn't enough. I just baked it for one more hour and it was well worth it. I will try it in the oven for 1 hour like the other reviewers suggested but i just hope it turns out just as soft, chewy and beautiful as with my bread maker.

I don't like bananas and don't buy bananas.  My 80 y.o. mother gave me 3 blackish-looking bananas yesterday and told me to, "Eat these."  Instead, I located this recipe and baked it (using all 3 bananas instead of the 2/3 cup as called for.)  This bread is delicious! (Mom thinks so, too.) I baked it in my Oster bread machine on the 80 min. ExpressBake cycle.  This wasn't long enough so had to add 25 minutes of the Bake cycle also. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This ended up coming out pretty tasty, despite my mistake of overcooking by having judged the doneness of the bread by the appearance of it's top after it had been cooked ont rapid bake cycle (I didn't have a quick bake setting).  I set it to bake for another hour in my machine.  The top was still pale in color, but I checked for doneness with a knife.  Came out clean so I decided to further inspect it by.  Aaaah!  There was my beautiful cinnamon color!  It tasted very good too.  I had added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla used 3 bananas.  I think it would have come out more moist had I not cooked it the additional hour.  Also, next time I will make sure to use overripe bananas.

Great recipe my family pigged out on it.  I even used bread flour and it turned out great.  Plus I added 1/4 extra banana.  It's the best bread machine banana recipe I have tasted!!

Very easy recipe and delicious results!  I did not premix the batter - just added the ingredients to the machine starting with the liquids, and it turned out just fine.  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 c of frozen bluberries to jazz it up a bit, and the family loved it.  Like any quick bread, it becomes more moist and easier to slice the next day.  I will definitely make this again.

It certainly doesn't get easier than this.  All the ingredients at hand, no bowls to clean up and you get a wonderful banana bread out of it! My son is allergic to nuts, so I used ½ a cup of milk chocolate chips.  I also used 1/3 of a cup of milk and 1/3 cup of sour cream, since I had some in the fridge.  I also let it bake for the entire bake cycle, which on my machine is 87 minutes, and it was just baked through.  Simple and delicious.

This recipe inspired me to drag out my breadmaker. Much to my dismay, I realized the mixing paddle was missing! Not to be deterred, I mixed the ingredients with a handmixer then poured it into a greased 9x5" loaf pan. Baked at 350 degrees per another user's suggestion for a little over an hour and voila! Delicious banana bread that my husband says is as good as his mom's (this was my goal!) and I'm happy because it is soooo much easier to make, even without the breadmaker!

Amazingly easy!!!!!!! I threw all the ingredients in the bread machine pan (Williams-Sonoma machine), pressed the quick bread cycle and presto!  I put it in the regular oven for 15 more minutes.. thought the top looked a little undone. I used a cup of pecans in place of walnuts... delish!!!! Will definitely make this one again! Thanks for sharing Susanne!

Excellent bread, easy and very moist.  I did have to use a longer baking cycle
than what was stated....70 minutes was perfect.  I also added a teaspoon of 
vanilla to the recipe.

Just made this for a chilly football Sunday! I made a few tweaks, I used 3/4 c. sugar w/ 1/4c.brown sugar. I also added a 1/4 cup of oats (oat grains) I mixed vanilla in w/ my bananas and that's it! Put them in the bread machine, mixed for a few minutes then baked. I had to bake my a few minutes longer, because the top of the loaf was still a little wet. This was viola, delish!

I cooked this in a Zojirushi Home Bakery Supreme on the quick cycle, and I was a little worried because I saw on some of the reviews that it didn't cook all the way through. When it beeped finished, sure enough, it was still a little too damp in the middle. My machine has a 1-hour keep warm cycle, which I know not to use because it it too hot and continues to cook. Well, I left the bread in through this cycle and it came out completely cooked without being overdone. I'm going to have to work out how to change the banana ratio for next time, as we like a stronger banana flavor though, and instead of walnuts I dumped in about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips that I had leftover from something else. I'll definitely make this again, but I'm going to have to play with it to get it just right for us.

I love this recipes, it's delicious. If you're having problems with it cooking all the way, try a different setting. On my machine on quick bread with a light crust it comes out not fully cooked, on a medium crust it comes out too cooked. I have to put it on the cake setting and it comes out perfect.

This is delicious, it's just the recipe has SO MUCH butter.  I cut the amount in half and added a tsp of gluten. I used 3 small bananas plus changed the crust control to dark so that it cooked a little more.

It turned out great! I only had one large ripe banana, but the bread had enough flavor from it. I used 1 C all-purpose flour and 1.5 C whole wheat flour; the bread still turned out moist. Used the "Batter Breads" setting on my Breadman and added about 1/3 C mildly sweet chocolate chips when it was mixing. Husband called this a win.

Very good! I followed the recipe for the most part, but made the following changes: did not add nuts (my husband doesn't like them), I used 3 bananas which ended up being more than what the recipe called for but I wanted more banana flavor. And lastly I did not premix. I did have to open after the first mixing cycle and scrap the edges a bit though. Also I don't have a "cake" setting on my bread machine so I used the "sweet bread" setting, the only thing with that is I had to bake for 10 more mins. as it wasn't quite done in the middle. So over all great recipe!! Will definitely make again.

This would be a good recipe for the right bread machine or for the oven.  It did not work at all in my machine.  I thought my "Sweet" setting would be equivalent to this recipe's "Cake" setting.  Not the case...it was only 1/2 cooked when the machine cut off.  I placed it directly in the oven at 350 for another 30 min (still inside the bread machine pan).

I just received my bread machine (Black & Decker All in One Model B2200) as a wedding gift. And I LOVE it. I think this will be the way I make breads from now on. =)I've always made banana bread in the oven and they've never turned out right (burnt outside, gooey middle). I just threw everything into the bread machine (liquids, then dry ingredients). I did beat the eggs and mashed 2 bananas before adding it to the mix. And added a tsp of cinnamon and omitted the nuts since I didn't have any. I didn't have to grease the bread pan either. Used the Quick Bread mode. It came out perfect. Nice golden crust. Moist center, not gooey. And the flavor was good. I think I'll vanilla extract to it next time.

This bread was not done when the bread machine was.  I had to put it in another pan and bake it in the oven :(  Not what I expected to do.  When it's done, bread has a very good flavor and texture.  Bread baked in the oven takes less time.

I successfully baked this in my Oster on the Expressbake 80 cycle. I liked the texture a lot, but the flavour was really bland for banana bread. Maybe I'll try apple sauce and more bananas next time.

The recipe doesn't say if it's for a 1lb bread machine or not, which is what  I have.  It seemed like alot of ingredients for a small loaf, so after reading the other reviews, I decided just to bake mine in the oven.  It came out perfect!!   I also added a 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, it was delicious!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  :)

This turned out as a five star for me. I mixed the ingredients really well before I put them in the bread machine, and after reading the previous reviews, I just cooked it in the bread machine at the regular (basic) setting. This way it cooked a lot longer and was done all the way through. My kids loved it! This will be the banana bread recipe I always use from now on.

This recipe is good, but not pop my eyes out, blow steam out of my ears GREAT!  I followed the directions exactly, except for substituting applesauce for margerine/butter and we used pecans instead of walnuts.  Applesauce was in the same measurement as the margerine, except it is more heart healthy and makes for a moist recipe.  We used pecans instead of walnuts because pecans are one of the top 20 antioxidant foods.  The bread was moist and chewey, it looked good, but it just didn't have that fruity, earthy, banana type taste my mother & grandmother's had.  I could taste the bananas, but they weren't strong enough and left me longing for that taste.  But it was plenty moist and chewwy so we compromised on a 3 rating.  I may make this again, only until I find a better recipe.  Maybe it needed more banana and some vanilla.  Just not up to my expectations.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! It is a favorite at my house! I found it really easy to mix the ingredients in the bread maker, and just before it starts to bake, to remove the mixture and add it into a bread pan and bake at 350F in the oven for about 20-25 minutes. This makes the bread rise perfectly. Add some butter on top and its ready to serve!

Not as good as Fannie Farmer's recipe.  I let it go through the quick bread cycle and it was underdone and did not crown.  Hubby gives it a three star rating and I would give it two stars tops.

Great recipe. I added cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and brown sugar to give it some color and spice. The recipe yields more than a 1 lb loaf as stated. My bread came out completely doughy on top. Increase cook time, or slightly reduce ingredients and it will come out perfect.

Pretty good.  Added cinnamon and vanilla.  My only problem was that the loaf did not fully cook through.  I play with it a little.  Tasted great.  Good toasted too.

Very, very good!  I used applesauce instead of margarine, buttermilk instead of milk, and 3 over-ripe bananas.  I also added about 3/4 cup of raisins.  I didn't mash the bananas or premix, however, I did stop my machine during the mixing cycle and re-start it again.  I have a breadman deluxe rapid breadmaker, and I used the batter bread setting.  When it was finished, I checked for doneness with a knife, and it wasn't done, so I reset the machine for 30 more minutes on the bake only setting.  After checking again, it was done.  This would probably be quicker in the oven, but I prefer convenience and less dirty dishes over time.  I will definitely make this again, because it really does taste wonderful, but I may try a differant setting nest time.

I made this bread because I had 2 bananas and all the ingredients in my pantry. Though I have a bread machine, I wanted to make a big oven loaf in a regular bread pan. I was a little concerned that there was so much batter, and thought it might overflow the pan. I used a glass bread pan at 325 degrees for an hour and it is perfect. Lovely golden color, incredible flavor, without adding any other flavoring. Freezes well, too.

I mashed up my bananas and added everything to my bread pan and let the machine mix it up...I had to use a spatula in the corners during mixing cycle, but it mixed up good. I used 3 VERY RIPE bananas. I also added some cinnamon and vanilla and pecans instead of walnuts.  The bread tasted amazing, however it didn't get completely done in my tall bread pan in the machine, so I stuck it in the oven for 10 or 15 minutes more.  As far as flavor goes, this was delicious, however I think that I will bake it in the oven next time...waiting over 3 hours for one loaf of banana bread, A QUICK bread...lol...is a little silly.

Really good.  I used strong white bread flour and baked it in my Panasonic SD-253 bread machine for about 65 minutes using the Bake option.  Used 2 overripe bananas and the bread came out with a great 'banana-y' taste.  Used slivered almonds since I didn't have walnuts.  I'll probably try wholemeal wheat next time with a little less sugar for a healthier version.

Well, I was a little worried because I've had my bread machine for several years and it does not have a cake cycle. It does however have a 3 hour "Bake Rapid" cycle, which is what I used and this bread turned out BEAUTIFUL. It smelled wonderful and had a nice brown coloring. I dropped it out of the pan and let in cool for about 20 minutes before I sealed it up. It looked so moist this morning and tasted amazing.

I must've messed this one up somehow; I'm not at all impressed, and I won't be making this one again. Perhaps my first mistake was using butter instead of margarine, though I've never had a problem with this sub before, and other similar recipes called for butter. Second, I had such a hard time 'pre-mixing' it all, I had to move the whole batter into my KitchenAid to get it all mixed up (so, two bowls, a whisk, 2 forks, a spatula, and the mixing attachment all got dirty.) The batter cooked up just fine in the machine (79mins on med,) but I would set on dark crust if I _were_ to redo this one (89 min,) because the top was not browned at all. Very little banana flavor, so I would consider a third mushed banana. And, I guess I would suggest using margarine instead of butter, as it just didn't turn out good at all... Also, perhaps following one of the other comments which suggested just throwing in all the ingredients and letting the machine do the mixing... I don't think that would have worked for me because I couldn't get this stuff to mix together without serious mixing power behind it. Good Luck.

Delicious!  I have been baking Banana bread for a long time.  This recipe is the best because it's so simple.  There is very little to clean up - just the bread pan!  I premix the batter by hand using a spatula right in the bread pan.  The timing is perfect.  I have the old William Sonoma bread machine.  I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made the mistake of reading the reviews that said that it didn't get completely done.  I put it on the darker setting and the outside got WAY too done.  Once you cut off the crust, it tastes great though.  I will make it again this week on normal.  I think it could use a little more banana.

My whole family loved this bread. I left the nuts out, but it was still great. Also, I used 3 bananas, I am not sure if that is the right amount according to the recipe, but it was great.

The flavor is excellent, but it took WAY longer to bake than just the quick bread cycle.  Next time I'll just bake it in the oven :)

The banana bread was probably the most moist and tasty bread ever made by me . There was only one problem -  After it was done in the bread machine it hadn't quite cooked all the way through. So I put it in a bread pan for about 15 minutes in a pre heated 350 degree oven. It turned out great.  Will make it again. 
Thanks, Joanne

I made this tonight and it was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly ..The only thing I did different was put the ingredients in the bread maker without mixing them together. It came out perfect! We ate the whole loaf and I will be making more tomorrow

Chocolate chips instead of walnuts. Even with wheat flour instead of all-purpose, it's an awesome bread, especially with a little butter.

I made this in the Breadman bread maker but i substitute margarine for Butter. I  add 1/2 cup of shredded coconut and Cranberry raisins or the Cherry infused Cranberry Raisins. I also use milk for buttermilk and a dash of Vanilla Extract and 12 teaspoon of Mccormic's Banana flavor. Set the machine on DARK crust and 2 pound loaf size. Makes a unique delicious bread.

Fantastic!  I didn't have margarine, so had to substitute butter, but otherwise I added a teaspoon of vanilla and some cinnamon and nutmeg (someone gave me a ton and I had to use it up).  No problem cooking, came out toothpick perfect each time I made it.  I'll be buying extra bananas just to make this!

I suggest not making this recipe in a breadmaker.  It would be fine to
bake it in an oven.  Here is what happened to me:

1)  the breadmaker didn't completely mix the ingredients.  There was a
    bunch of flour left on the bottom and corners when the bread was
    done.  Also, the stick of margarine wouldn't get mixed--it just
    floated on the surface as the breadmaker mixed the other
    ingredients.  (I'm aware the instructions say to mix completely
    before adding to the breadmaker, but if you are going to do that,
    why not just put it in the oven, too?)

2)  the breadmaker sloshed ingredients onto the sides and this burnt.
    If you stopped the breadmaker before this burnt, the bread wasn't
    half done.

3)  My breadmaker had no setting for cake/bread that doesn't use
    yeast.  All of the settings had a rise stage.  This is certainly
    unnecessary and possibly bad for this recipe.

4)  My breadmaker didn't bake this nearly long enough.  Most of the
    middle was completely liquid, so I had to reset the breadmaker at
    a "bake" setting.

The bread thus had burnt stuff on some edges and unmixed stuff on
others.  The bread tasted great, however.  It is just that a
breadmaker is the wrong tool to make it.

Absolutely the best banana bread!!!! I basically followed the original.  I did as others did by adding all the ingredients in the order listed into my Welbilt bread maker.  I added a dash of vanilla, but everything else I kept the same.  When the maker was done with the quick bread cycle (1hr 43m) I took the pan out of the maker and let the bread stay in it until completely cool.  This helped finish cooking the bread.  SUPER moist and it even has a bit of glaze on it.

This made a very delicious banana bread, though I did make a few minor changes. I substituted 1/2 cup bread flour from the all purpose and mixed walnut with pecans. It is now a family favorite in our home :)

This is simply delicious! I made this twice.. the first time I pre-mixed the ingredients. The second time I just dumped them all in (since other reviewers recommended this). It turned out WAY better when I premixed the ingredients. I don't know if it's just my brand of bread machine. I will definitely make this again and again, only premixing the ingredients every time.

I made this with a little trepidation due to the fact I've tried several other recipes in my bread machine and none of them came out!! Except for this! It was almost like my mothers homemade bread I remember her making every Sunday! Absolutely delicious! The only changes I made where that I left out the nuts and actually added one cup of bananas and reduced the butter to 1/3. Otherwise...great recipe. Thanks!

It just came out of the bread machine.  Excellent. Very moist. I did make a few adjustments out of neccesity.  I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  1/4 cup of vegatable oil and 1/4 cup of butter. I added more bananas up to 1 cup. I have a Breadman machine and used the batter breads cycle; did not premix.  I had to switch to the bake only cycle for an additional 15 mins.  It taste wonderful. Working on the second one now.  My co-workers will love it.

Delicious!  I made this and it was gone in a matter of hours.  My whole family loved it.  It was so easy to do in the bread machine.  I used my rapid loaf setting, did not premix the ingredients, but did have to bake it about 15 extra minutes.  My family will be wanting me to make this quite often!

This was pretty good. I made it my Oster ExpressBake on the Sweet setting. I had to cook in it in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes afterwards. I am going to try the ExpressBake Setting next time.

I made the following changes - used 1 cup whole wheat flour in place of one cup of white flour, used brown sugar instead of white sugar, added dried cranberries, some cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg and a handful of coconut flakes.  Also, I used soy milk in place of milk.  I used the batter bread setting on my bread maker.  I needed to add an extra 10 min of baking time.  Bread came out very nice, the cinnamon and nutmeg gave it a nice added flavor.

Yummy...I used 2.5 bananas, half whole wheat flour, and only 2/3 cup of sugar, 1/3 cup of oil instead of marg. and it still turned out great.  I think next time I'll use even more banana.

We love this recipe. I've been using it for a couple of years now. Recently I started making it a little healthier by substituting 1 1/2 c. of the flour with 1c. whole wheat flour and 1/2c. wheat germ. Our whole family loves it!

Ok, well I obviously don't have the right breadmaker for this recipe. I pre-blended it, as instructed, and put it in my breadmaker, which doesn't have a sweet bread setting. I put it on the fast bread setting, that has lots of rise time and takes 3 hrs 10 min. During all this time, the bread didn't rise (I don't know how it was supposed to, since there's no yeast). When it finally got to baking, and finished, it was uncooked in the middle. I tried to finish it in the oven, but it was still completely inedible. It is extremely dense, and didn't rise at all so it was the size of half my bread pan. In my breadmaker, this was an utter failure.

Pretty darn good, especially for how little work it took. Not 'The Best' I've ever had but still fairly wonderful.

This is the first and last time I will try a sweet bread in my maker.  It was just as much work as regular banana bread, took 3 times as long to bake, and the chocolate chips (a must have) were stuck to the bottom and the crust was too hard.  Nevertheless, my kids will eat it.

Very good banana bread.  I usually use more bananas and turns out very moist!

I felt like this was a waste of my time to mix in advance only to essentially bake it in the breadmaker. The bottom part was burnt, the middle was dry but edible, and the top never finished cooking and was actually raw. My breadmaker is fine, so maybe just the setting I chose. But next time I will just make it in the oven for the same amount of mixing hassle but better results.

This recipe did not work for me. I read the other reviewers and was expecting to cook for longer than the recipes states, but I ended up have to cook an additional 2 hrs in the oven in order to be sure that the center wasn't mush. After that, there was a thick black crust, and the center was still not quite done. 
It also didn't rise, making it very dense.. not in a good way. 
Don't waste your ingredients on this recipe.

Good taste but a little soggy. If you make this it would turn out better if you baked it in a regular bread pan.  UPDATE... I downgraded this from three stars to two stars.  Good taste but way too wet.

This bread is so wonderful!!!  I love banana breads, but am always looking for a new recipe.  This one just came out so wonderful, right out of the machine I had a slice and it was incredible!!

I did scale the recipe up 50% more and it still turned out great.  I had to bake it a little longer than just my Expressbake 80.  But I knew to check from reading the other reviews.  I substituted about half the flour with whole wheat flour.  Next time I'm going to replace some or all the margarine/butter with applesauce and add a little vanilla as recommended by several other reviewers.  My 18 month old twins LOVE this stuff, one of them has her mouth stuffed full of bread right now!!!

I made this bread over the weekend and it did not turn out so well. I think its because my breadman is an older model, and the "quick bread" cycle is not the same as others. The most important thing for this bread is to put it on a cycle that would bake it for at least 55 minutes. Mine baked for only 28 minutes, and was still "oozy" when I took it out of the bread machine and put it in the oven for 40 more minutes. The flavor was incredible though, but because of the disruption during baking, the middle of the bread was quite eggy, like quiche.

Not what I was expecting. After reading that people cooked it in the oven I tried it instead of my bread machine. Not too impressed. Came out with the bottom of the bread still super doughy after an hour and half cooking at 350. Might try again not sure. 

The part that is cooked tastes fabulous though.

I'm sorry but this just did not turn out. The outside was cooked and it looked great, but it did not cook all the way through.  Not to cry over spilled milk, I sampled the part that did bake through and although moist, it had no flavor.  I had even added cinnamon and vanilla (and an extra banana).  Sorry. Will go back to the Banana Banana bread recipe on this site.

Great tasting! The bread crumbled and fell apart when I tried to slice it. Must have done something wrong on my part. Will try it again to see if it turns out better because the flavor was wonderful. Also I did add one tsp. vanilla as one reviewer suggested.

Excellent, moist bread and sooo easy to make. I added 1 tsp of vanilla essence and gave the ingredients a quick mix first as I was worried about pockets of flour as one reviewer said. Am gonna make this for my friends last day at work on Sunday - mmmm.

This recipe was wonderful.  I used 2 bananas instead of the 2/3 cup it calls for.  I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla.  It came out very moist, and it had lots of flavor.

Delicious.  My breadmaker didn't have a quick setting, so i manually set it to mix for 5 minutes (in addition to the manual mixing i did), and bake for 80 minutes.  It came out good, but the sides were a tad brown - next time i will try 75 minutes.

I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla extract, and used slightly less than a cup of sugar -- one cup just seemed too much.

Great recipe for the bread machine! I added pecans and chocolate chips. It did take longer than the 1 hour baking cycle on my bread machine. I had to take out the pan,cool down the machine and restart the bake cycle for about another 20 min.(but it was worth it!). I just mixed it in the bread pan stirring it off the sides occasionally. Even with the extra bake time, it was still easy and came out nice and moist.  Try it with the cheesecake flavored cream cheese from the dairy isle of grocery--Awesome!

My family loves this bread!  It tastes even moister the second day after baking since the flavors have blended.  I usually put all the ingredients in the bread pan and help mix them with a spatula while the paddle is going.  This way I don't dirty another bowl by pre-mixing.  My 2 yr. old loves to help make this!

Made it for the first time ever followed directions but part of the bread at the bottom didn't bake all the way. Will definitely make it again soon for sure.

This recipe is wonderful with following changes:  a dash of cinnamon, dark brown sugar mixed with the white sugar, a little vanilla extract, at least a full cup of mashed bananas, and at least a full cup of roughly chopped English walnuts.  Done in the Breville Custom Loaf machine on the yeast free setting, it turns out moist and very flavorful.

I made some changes which improved it. 
Use whole milk 
Use butter
Use 6 ripe bananas
Use a cup of walnuts add half of them on top once its cooking. 
Add cup of chocolate chips if desired. Stir in from the sides when done mixing in the machine otherwise the chocolate chips all come out on the sides.

It did not say loaf size setting so I put it on 2 lb loaf and I cooked it in sweet setting , not cake. The kids loved it! They said it was better than the old fashioned Sicky  and sticky loads we grew up with. And I had to agree. It was perfect for our family! Thank You for helping me find something special for my picky and dearly loved children to enjoy! ??

I need to pay attention more often to the whole receipe as I prepared it for the oven. Turned out great between 50min-1hr at 365 farenheit. I also used butter to oil my pan.

Made it in my bread machine. Overall flavor was good, crust was a lil rubbery and the top didnt cook all the way. Had a volcano top of raw bread dough. Pretty sure everything was done correctly lol but not a bad recipe. I just think it would bake a lil better in the oven.

Used unsalted butter, so added a bit more salt. I use a tsp or so of vanilla extract. I’ve used both walnuts and pecans: they’re both delish!  EXCELLENT banana nut bread recipe.

Altered recipe as 2/3 cup banana isn't nearly enough. 2 sm/med bananas did the trick. Bread came out flavorful, moist and dense, much better than the light and fluffy recipe that came with the Sunbeam machine. Will use again!

Changed from margarine to butter on Quick Bread setting, and it didn't cook well; still raw in the middle. I don't think it really rose either...

Put this recipe through my Zojirushi BHAC10 on the "cake" setting, and it turned out really well. The top was a little floury--I only very roughly mixed it before putting it in the bucket, and had the walnuts in the initial mix instead of adding them at the chime. Distribution was a little inconsistent, so I think I'll try adding them at the chime next time to see if that makes a difference.

I made this yesterday, it was descent but seemed to be missing something. I have a second loaf going in the bread maker as I type lol  The only change I made was the addition of a tsp of vanilla. I will report the  results of my minor change, fingers crossed hehe EDIT: The addition of a tsp of vanilla did kick it up a little bit :)

YUM.. I just got an older model barely used Breadman machine. I'm not a believer in this machine as I haven't had much success.
This recipe is a winner. I had 3 medium very ripe bananas that I had to use so, I increased the bananas to about 2 cups. Also, I only had light brown sugar to use.
I used the fruit and nut cycle and it took 3 1/2 hours. I turned it off immediately after it was finished and left it. There was a definite ring of underbaked..but the texture was fine and it tastes good. I know that was from my extra bananas. I'll definitely make this again and maybe leave it on warm for another 30mins or so.
it had a lovely crust and flavor.

This was so easy to make!! I thought at first it was going to be way to thick and heavy because the ingredients mixed together were hard to stir and a very thick consistency . But once it was in my bread machine it was awesome!! I think premixing  isn't needed. I wish I had taken a pic before my kids devoured it lol. Will definitely be making it again!!!

I made this without nuts and added 3 bananas (have to many bananas!). I did premix, so that they kids could help cook. Bread turned out awesome - even my picky kid (who declared to hate bananas) loves this bread. Thanks for the recipe - I think I'll replace the bananas with carrots and zucchini next time.

This is a great bread machine banana bread recipe.  I did change a few things however.  I used real butter instead of margarine.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I experimented with the different cycles and found no difference between the regular cycle and the batter cycle except for the time factor.  In one experiment, the dough was not quite cooked so recommend a tablespoon or more less milk and the equal amount more flour.  It worked for me.  Never did I premix the batter and as long as I watched it and used a spatula to make sure it mixed all a the sides, it was fine.  My family raves each time I make this.

I would say this is more banana cake type bread, but definitely in a good way!  Moist, delicious, and yes, it's more dense.  I kept the recipe as is, mixed everything together, and poured it into my 1-lb loaf bread maker after greasing the sides with coconut oil.  Cooked it overnight (quick bread setting on my Zorijishi, about 1 hour 53 minutes, then warm setting) and woke up this morning to warm, delicious nana bread!  This is a keeper!

Followed directions perfectly.  At the end of the quick bread cycle, the bread wasn't done. I had to bake it 20 minutes longer. After baking longer it was beautiful & tasted delicious, but as a bread making novice I had to call my aunt for help. I didn't know what to do when the bread wasn't fully done when the machine wasn't done.

This is the first quick bread I have made in my bread maker, and I'm very happy with the result. I increased the recipe by 1.5 since my bread machine has only a 1.5 or 2 lb option. I used butter instead of margarine and decreased the amount slightly, increased the banana slightly, and cut the sugar by about 2/3. I threw everything into the bread machine without pre-mixing, but it did not mix well on its own, so I did have to mix it quite a bit. The result was moist and very tasty; great recipe!

I like to add three bananas when I make this.  I mix in my bread machine,but bake in the oven.  I use a cinnamon brown sugar mix swirled in the middle.  It is now an "in demand" snack.  (You can also add 1/2c. wheat germ for a healthier kick.

I made this almost exactley as stated.
I used whole wheat flour, as that is all I had.
I selected the 1 loaf size, and the crust was selected as light. I did have to add 15-20 minutes more cooking time, after that it was cooked just nice, great colour too. The flavour is a little bland for me, but I think that can just depend on your mood and whad degree of flavour your looking for.

Made it three times.  First time exactly. Very tasty! Second time I substituted 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and it was still tasty but did have a bit of the wheat taste that brings. Third time I made it with only 1 cup whole wheat and I used probably 1/2 again more banana.  More moist, yes, but also more dense, and it didn't raise as much.  But I loved it.  I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Very good.

Very good banana bread. Changes I made: 1 cup whole wheat flour + 2 cups all-purpose. 1 cup milk, some honey instead of white sugar. Thanks!

Best banana bread EVER!!! The kids and I ate the whole loaf in one sitting. We did not use the walnuts and I added 1 1/4C of sugar. Next time, we will try it with chocolate chips. :)

I didn't try this one, but made it and sent it to work with my husband.  He said all of his co-workers loved it.  The cake cycle on my bread machine took 3-4 hours, so next time I may just mix it in the machine and then bake it in the oven.

This bread was great!  I did change it up a lil and  it was fantastic!  I used 1 1/4 c of sugar, 1/2 c of buttermilk instead of milk, 1 tsp of vanilla and just 1 tsp of baking soda..  I also add more nuts and  use 2-4 mashed bananas depending how many I have..

I made this last night, and it was okay but not great.  It definitely needs more banana flavor.  If I make this again I'll double the amount of banana.  I should have known before it was even done because while it was on the "bake" cycle, I smelled "bread" and not "banana".

Quick and Easy. I used cinnamon apple sauce, and eliminated oil all together. Bread came out great and heavy, the crust was perfect! It was a little sticky in the center, next time I will do as the directions say and try and wait until its completely cooled to take it out to eat :p

I added buttermilk instead of milk...turned out very good and very moist BUT next time I make it, I will add more bananas. I used 3 medium but 4 med or 3 big large ones would be better. I also mixed walnuts and pecans...Mmmm Very tasty!

This was still not cooked after a full cycle. I had to bake it another 40 min so the outside was too hard and the inside was just done. I will try a different recipe next time.

hmm... i followed this recipe exactly, even adding the walnuts, but it just didn't taste good. When i mentioned to my brother that it was banana bread he said, IT IS? he couldn't even tell that this was banana bread, that's how bland and nonexistent the flavor was. It's really disappointing because i had high hopes for this recipe considering there's only about 4 recipes for banana bread for a bread machine on this website. It just wasn't a strong enough banana flavor for my family, sorry. Oh , and i used 2 bananas so I even used a little extra.

pretty good! subbed applesauce for margarine and used 2 bananas... i think with both of those it made the bread a tiny bit too moist (didn't cook fully on the very top) will play around with ingredients but plan to make again! (also just dumped mine in the bread machine in the order written)

I loved it and so did all my family and friends. I am allergic to dairy so i substituted the milk for Almond Milk and the butter for dairy free butter. Nobody could even tell that it was almond milk. It turned out great. The only thing is that it took a little longer for it to cook then the cake setting cooks for. I had to put the bread machone on the bake mode for an extra 30 minutes.

Love this!! I did a few changes; applesauce instead of butter, brown sugar instead of white, and used macadamia nuts instead of walnuts (my fav!!!) was sooo good that me and my bf at almost half the loaf in one sitting. didn't seem to do well next day, had dried out a whole lot and became unbearably chewey. that might have been the way i stored it but other than that, was awsome!!!!

I have made this several times over and we just love it.  I do premix this before putting it into the machine but have never actually tried it without premixing.  This bread is moist and has a nice texture.  We just love it.  thank you for this nice easy bread machine banana bread. FYI  I have used non ripened bananas smashed them alot and they also give it a great flavor!

1st time making non-yeasted bread in bread maker.  Take note - the mixture is a lot more fluid than yeasted breads during/after kneading cycle.   Bread is DELICIOUS and moist; followed recipe exactly except subbed lite brown sugar for white.

Awesome! I used 3 bananas instead of 2/3 cup and had to cook the bread for another 30 minutes, but this was the yummiest bread I've ever had.  Next time I'm going to try the applesauce instead of the butter.

I really like this recipe. I did not add any kind of nut, and used 1 over ripe plantain instead of a regular banana. The bread came out perfectly cooked, although it really does seem more like cake. Not that anybody minded. I wonder, does it freeze well?

I don't normally like banana bread, and made this only for my toddler son who will eat himself silly on any kind homemade bread at all. It's really quite good! I was LAZY and just threw two full-size over-ripe bananas into the bottom of the breadpan, instead of mashing and measuring. I also used applesauce instead of margarine or butter. It turned out GREAT. I'm trying it today with butter for a neighbor, and I am sure it will still turn out fine.

Dry & bland - not the old fashioned banana bread recipe I remember.  I am new to using the bread machine, so maybe I just have to accept that the bread will be dry.  I used the 58 minute quick bread setting on my sunbeam and had to put the bread in the oven to finish baking. Plus there were just too many ingredients.  I also tried the "Banana Bread - Quick Bread for Machines" and that one is a little better, but still not satisfied.

Absolutely delicious but didn't quite bake through. I'm going to try again with a little bit less moisture. Only the very top and center was not done. The rest was pretty dense, but still kind of fluffy. The flavor was perfect and I didn't have to pre-mix the ingredients or even grease my bread machine's pan. Very easy and tasty, will definately try again with slight modifications.

Great recipe for a yummy, moist banana bread! Easy to follow and bakes up beautifully! I used chocolate chips instead of the nuts and the kids LOVED it!
Thanks for sharing.

Very good taste and texture! I followed to a T except for addition of a couple sprinkles of cinnamon. It didn't cook all the way through in my bread machine though, middle was runny. I had to finish it off in the oven. I think i'll stick to my recipe, but overall really tasty bread! Thanks!!

Amazing. Moist. Yum. I was a little concerned because it was such a runny batter but it rose up nicely. I'm not sure if I'll ever just throw it all in the bread maker and not pre mix. I didn't have any uncooked parts in my bread maker, mine is a newer black and decker. Give this one a try, its my go to recipe now. Thanks so much

This bread is very good and stays moist for days.  Our bread machine broke the night we made it and we just popped it into a casserole dish and cooked it that way.

This is a good banana bread recipe, although fantastic.  I used butter instead of margarine (of course), sunflower seeds instead of walnuts and whole wheat flour.  The only thing you are doing with your bread machine is to bake the bread -- it is entirely mixed by hand and so you are not saving any time or cleanup.  However, I did like being able to make a loaf of banana bread without heating up the oven, so I will definately make this one again.

I thought that this was great. The family loved it and it was gone within the same day. I am making another today. The four stars are only because I added more banana and 1/2 c of chopped pecans instead of the walnuts. This recipe is really easy though for anyone making bread for the first time.

very good! My machine has a 58 minute express bake, and i let it sit in there for another 10 minutes before opening the lid, very golden......unlike the usual denser brown color. A really moist cake, great with butter!

I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 white flour and the bread turned out great.  I didn't use nuts so my version was a little healthier because of the whole wheat and had a little less fat in it, too.  Yum

Perfect! I made quite a few changes and it turned out GREAT!! I used kamut flour instead of wheat, egg subsitute, brown sugar instead of white, and olive oil instead of margarine. Once out of the bread machine, I put it in my oven at 350 for another 10 minutes. Beautiful flavour!

Awful recipe!  After cooking in my bread machine, the insides were runny and I had to finish cooking in my oven.  After it was cooked, the bread was dry and not very flavorful.  Will stick with my traditional recipe and skip the bread machine next time!

This was really good and really easy. I used butter not margarine, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, and about a teaspoon of cinnamon. I think next time I will use half white sugar, half brown sugar. Oh, and I omitted the nuts just because I didn't have any. Hey, and if you want more banana taste, wait til they are really ripe, or just add an extra one. Try it, you will like it!
