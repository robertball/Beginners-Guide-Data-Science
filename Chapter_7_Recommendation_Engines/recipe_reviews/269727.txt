Wow- A LOT of work, it would have been So. Much.Easier just using the stove top. As you can see from my pics, the bell peppers fell apart and I could not lift them from the pot. The flavor was good- The recipe calls for random Italian spices so I used my imagination  and the blend turned out nice! I used thin sliced rare  roast beef from the deli counter - I would definitely put this on some crusty French bread as a sandwich- the flavor is delish- the recipe “as-is” does not work.

I didn't have provolone slices so I used shredded mozzarella. Slices would have been better - it needed more cheese. The peppers were also overdone. We are going to try it again with different cheese and cooking for less time. I used the time in the recipe and let it sit for a while - that was too long. Otherwise very tasty.

Tasty but the time was much too long for peppers...they literally fell apart in the pot when trying to remove/ unwrap.  If we try again will start with half the time
