I followed the recipe but I topped it with a mix of equal parts confectioners sugar & cocoa powder. My family is partially Mexican so I took it to our Christmas Eve party. It was a unanimous hit & my little sister asked me to make them again for her birthday. I’ll keep making these.

We followed the directions to the “T” and these came out awful.  They rose in the center with a big lump. We let them cool, cut and tried them. They felt like rubber and tasted like leather.

My boyfriend is gluten free so I find myself buying different types of gluten free sweets. Instead of spending anymore money I decided to try a recipe that will utilize things I have at home already. Needless to say he LOVED them and also did my family members who eat gluten. This recipe is perfect. I think if I swap out the chocolate I can make gluten free blondies! We shall see!

At first I was confused about the word tablet, so I figured that it must mean a whole disc. I used 3 discs of Abuelita mexican hot chocolate. I didn't have coffee so I just added the 1/4 c of boiled water without it. 
     It's a bit cakey rather than dense like regular brownies, but it has a good flavor and smell. This recipe is a great way of getting rid of the mexican hot chocolate discs that tend to stick around in the cabinet for years.
