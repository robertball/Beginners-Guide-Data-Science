This is basically how I usually make my pierogies. I always make them to taste. So I decided to try this with exact amounts. I doubled the recipes and made 12 pierogies and used 1/2 whipped butter and 1/2 lite margarine to lighten it up. The best unintended part of the recipe was I made a couple steaks yesterday I made on the grill. I took them out of the fridge and sliced them and sauteed them in the pan after I removed the pierogies and they got a nice flavor with the butter onion garlic parsley combination left in the pan. So it made an easy complete meal in one pan today.

This is pretty much just how I make my pierogies, except I make more than six, and, therefore use more butter and onions and such. I do have to admit, 9 times out of 10, I do boil them slightly first (just the way we always did it), but if I'm in a hurry, or just don't feel like it, I cook them like this from frozen...either way, they turn out perfectly delicious, buttery, yummy goodness! :)

Oh now this is comfort food at it's best! Rich delicious and very filling - not for those counting calories or for those of us like myself who made their New Year's resolution to get healthy LOL! I made this for my husband and this is pretty much the way my Mom used to make them for me as a kid. The only exception for me was I got my hands on homemade church pierogies thanks to my mother-in-law! And for those of you who've had a "church" pierogi you know what I'm talking about. Perfect topped with fresh chives vs. parsley and a side of sour cream - YUM!

These tend to be not as creamy on the inside and crisp on the outside because you did not cook the pierogies in hot water first. Bring the water to a boil and add pierogies. When they float take them out to steam dry. Saut√© butter onions & garlic until semi translucent and add the pierogies. When they are slightly golden they are perfect! Yum.

This was a tasty and satisfying side dish. I found a great quality brand of frozen pierogies and followed the recipe exactly. My husband loved it.

7.1.18 This made a really good quick and easy side dish served last night with Crumbed Chicken Tenderloins (Air Fried) and Summer Corn Salad. I did put the frozen pierogies in a bowl of hot water to soften before frying and did add some diced bacon to the onions and garlic.

I think pierogies are bland.
