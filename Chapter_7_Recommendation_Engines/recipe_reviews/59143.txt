I am Persian also, and I agree that Maast-o-Khiar can not be forgotten in any meal. 

A tip for anyone making this is if don't use garlic. Garlic makes the dish taste a little less tasty. Also, the tradition is to use a grater to grate the cucumbers, not to cube them! Just thought I would share with everyone.

In Malta this is called Tzatziki.  Seems its popular all over?  Very good,  and a grat cool summer side dish.  Its also versitile,  I play around with this recipe depending on whats available.  Its really good with a few sliced black olives.  Sometimes I add chopped nuts too!  No plain yogurt?  More than once I have used sour cream and cream cheese mixed.  Great with Gyro's !

My husband is Persian and he just loved this! He said it was better than his mother's=) From having eaten this before, I did leave out the garlic as I don't remember it having garlic in there and it was the exact flavor I expected. We ate it with lavash(flat bread) and Kabob...YUM!!

Great. Very reminiscent of tzaziki, just a little more mellow. I skipped the shallot because I didn't have any. Served with kabobs that were pretty oniony, so I didn't miss it. Thanks for the recipe!

Refreshing on a hot summer day.  My husband said it was just like the stuff they serve in Turkey.  I added a little celery seed because I like it--but the recipe is perfect as is.

We just did not care for this as written...WAY too much cucumber (we used 3 english) and dill for the amount of yogurt.  We started over - vastly reducing those items and maintaining the other ingredients as written and it was much more to our liking.

I have returned to this recipe over and over again for the past 5ish years.  I rarely put the full amount of cucumber, and never full amount of dill, but we love this tasty condiment.  If you have trouble with wateriness, be sure to seed your cucumbers.

Grated the cucumber as others suggested and substituted a tablespoon of chopped red onion for the shallot.  We loved it with the "Middle Eastern Rice with Black Beans" on this site.

I make this every other day for my husband who is Persian.  This stuff is so good for you and very flavorful too!  I'm glad I found a recipe for it.   I also make it into a dip for chips or veggies, but when I do that I puree the cucumbers and it makes a great tasting yogurt dip.  Thank you for posting!

Absolutely gorgeous!  I ate mine with celery sticks for a light snack but would definitely serve it with lamb or spicy chicken and rice.

I didn't have any shallots so I used a half a tablespoon of dried onion flakes instead, and chilled it overnight.  I also used 2% fat plain yogurt from Sainsbury's.  

I am going to serve this with the brisket during Passover for a real Middle Eastern meal.

YUMMY! my only suggestion is to use a shredder and shred the cucumbers instead of cubing them. it's a little too chunky with the cucumbers cubed. but otherwise great!!

I feel the recipe calls for too much cucumber. Also, I guess I have to thank this recipe for teaching me that Im not a fan of dillweed. I never tried it but now I know. I prefer another tzatziki recipe thats simpler; it is mostly yogurt, garlic, salt. No offense, just not my taste.

Used regular cucumbers and minced vidalia onion instead of the english cuke and shallots (locally grown produce is ALWAYS best), and didn't measure exactly for any of the ingredients, and this was FABULOUS. Who knew that this simple recipe could be so tasty? The better your ingredients, the better your final dish, so I'd advise using a really good gelatin-free yogurt with live active cultures, like Stonyfield Farm. We licked the dish on this one. Thanks!

This is one of the VERY few ways I will eat cucumber, or yogurt, for that matter.  Great with falafel breaded chicken, and with fat free yogurt it's an awesome healthy substitute for tarter sauce.  A dash of sesame oil gives it a tahini taste, too.  Thanks for sharing!

This wasn't exactly the taste I was looking for. I was trying to copy the maast o khiar that I love from a local restaurant. I did substitute sour cream for teh yogurt, perhaps this is where I went wrong.

This is so easy and quick to make.  I added a few chili flakes, and diced my cucumber in small cubes as preferred it chunky, also some raisins but this is such a light refreshing snack and you can adjust it in several ways.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  I didn't have any dill on hand but it didn't detract in any way.

My In-laws (from India) LOVED this! I'm the new star in the family. I made this to accompany the "Moroccan Lamb Kabobs" (see my review on All-Recipes), and there was none left. I followed the recipe for a serving of 4, grated the cumber to keep this as a dressing for the kabobs and followed the rest of the recipe as is, garlic and all, it was perfect. The only thing I might do is add a bit more salt. Oh, and I used low-fat yogurt because that's what I had on hand. My in-laws want me to make some to keep stocked in their fridge.

This is a really great and refreshing side dish.  My mother-in-law always made it with ground mint, and as stated in another review, the cucumbers were grated.

I liked the flavor, overall.  I julienned the cukes on my new mandoline.  The flavor was good but I didn't care for the texture of the dill.  Maybe just the dill I used?

I might use less shallots, but this was an easy and tasty side dish to cool down a meal.  It will also be fun to experiment with.

Very tasty and great with bagel chips, naan, pita, or practically any starch. I make mine extra garlicky and need something to buffer the intense taste! 

To make it a bit thicker, I strain the yogurt for ~6 hours - just line a strainer with mesh fabric or cheesecloth and place over a bowl. Pour the yogurt in, stir after a couple hours and wait some more. You end up with a really thick and creamy greek style yogurt that really compliments the cucumber and garlic flavor.
