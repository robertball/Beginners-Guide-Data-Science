Good for a quick weekend lunch. Will not waste chicken on a dinner to make this. Double the ham and cheese (my opinion).

4 stars as written.  5 stars with the following changes:  1.  On bottom crust mix 1 tbsp. mayo plus 1 tbsp. stone ground mustard.  2.  Double the meat and cheese.  3.  No mayo/mustard on the top crust needed.  
You can also serve with heated strawberry preserves to give this a "monte cristo" twist. 
Love it.
