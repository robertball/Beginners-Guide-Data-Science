Super easy.  I used two boxes and 2 1/4 c. milk as another user suggested.  After it was mixed, I saw on the pudding box that for the "traditional pudding pie" version you should use two boxes and 2-3/4 c. milk.  I think I'll increase the milk next time.  This time around I'm not sure if all my pudding dissolved.  I tasted the spatula after I was done and it was gritty... :(

This was simple, fast, and cured our chocolate craving.  I had some graham crackers on hand, so I made my own crust.  I used 2 (1.34 ounce) boxes of instant chocolate pudding and 2 1/4 cups of milk.  This made for a thicker, richer "pie" like filling. It yielded   enough to fill the whole pie crust.  After chilling, I topped it with a layer of whip topping and garnished with chocolate shavings.  So simple, but so good.

This recipie was great! I made it for my little sister's birthday party, and the children ate all ten pies. I also put chopped walnuts on top of the whipped topping. I also made some with vanilla, and put chocolate chips on the whipped topping instead of chopped walnuts.

I have made this pie a few times, if I'm pressed for time. I use instant pudding for the filling and Cool Whip for the topping, but GUMMI WORMS??? I don't think so. I have found that a "cooked" chocolate pudding,  using evaporated milk instead of regular milk, will result in a much richer and better tasting pie.

Such an easy recipe. I use Sugar Free Instant Pudding and put a thin layer of banana slices ontop of pudding layer. Let it set then spread with cool whip and then drizzle with chocolate syrup. MMMMMMMMMM!!!!

I changed some things. I made my own crust. (How hard is it to make a graham cracker crust?! Graham crackers (make into crumbs), margarine (or butter), and a tablespoon of sugar.) I used 2 large boxes of "Jello" brand chocolate pudding. 6 cups of milk as suggested on the packages (3 for each). I also whipped my own whipped cream. A small container, 'til soft peaks formed, added 1/2 a cup of powder sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and mix 'til you have stiff peaks. I always go a little over, but don't make it into butter! I made the crust first, poured in the chocolate pudding, and topped with the whipped cream. I added small chocolate chips for presentation, and they taste yummy! I didn't use gummy worms.. That just sounds awful!

This is one of the easiest, quickest desserts that pleases everyone.  (Especially my Dad!)  I mix this up for him, using different puddings - including combo's of flavors.  No garnish necessary!  I also leave off the whipped topping, so people can add their own.  *Lately, I've been using the reduced fat crusts and Sugar free puddings and no one has even noticed!!*

simple. #4 on these directions say to refrigerate until not too gooey.  the pudding should be made by reducing milk to 2 1/2 cups, and not as directed on the package.

Very easy. I made a homemade graham cracker crust to go with it. I didn't use the whipped topping or gummi worms. It is a simple easy weeknight dessert.

This is my husband's favorite.  Just made two for Thanksgiving tomorrow.  I use pastry pie crusts and cook and serve chocolate pudding made with whole milk.  Instant pudding does not set up for pies and fat free milk makes it worse. I put Cool Whip on pieces unless taking to a gathering.

I did NOT prepare the pudding according to the box, I actually cut the milk back by almost a cup to get a thicker pie filling. After the pie had time to set, I then spread the whipped topping over the top. Very full pie but the whole family enjoyed it. NOTE: I did prepare this with sugar free pudding, 2% milk and "light" whipped topping and noone even noticed.

very simple kids favorite pie.  i use less milk than the pudding box calls for so the pudding is thicker and holds shape better (to make it more of a pie and less soupy).  i've made it in individual tart pans and crumbled some extra graham cracker crumbs on top, looks like worms crawling in dirt... dirt cups as my mom called them when we were growing up!

I'd never liked chocolate pudding, needless to say, chocolate pudding PIE, but my bf LUUUVS it, so i reluctantly made it. I don't know why but it turned out that pudding had never got hardened enough to keep the shape. We thought we should wait more time, but a couple of days later in the fridge, it was still the same. The taste was good though. My bf even said the taste is the same as he used to eat when he was growing up but not this much WATERY (too soft) texture... i don't know why... i followed the direction on the box, to make the pudding itself...

I thought this was simple recipe that satisfied my chocolate craving.  I realized while I was at the store that there is a recipe for pudding pie on the box and I actually followed that recipe.  And gummy worms???  Chocolate chips sounded much better!

I  have been making this recipe for several years. My family prefers pastry crust. Sometimes I will mix 1/2  of prepared pudding with 1/2  of whipped cream and make in 2 layers, one dark and one lighter. Just a little fancier and goes a little farther.

This is SO much better if you use Royal chocolate pie filling and use the kind you cook rather than instant. Try it - you'll be amazed at the difference. I have made this for years and my mother before me.

My Dad has made this for my family for as long as I can remember. It's absolutely delish! We use reduced fat Cool-Whip and low-fat Jello pudding and it still tastes great! You can garnish it with virtually anything sweet and it'll be wonderful!

I have made this for years but without the gummies. The simplest things make people the happiest. Everyone goes crazy for this. Good and practically no work involved to make.

We make this at Thanksgiving in addition to a Pumpkin Pie.  My 4 year old loves it, and it's lower calorie than most desserts.
