The variation that I grew up on included sauteing the onion and 1 small green pepper (adds beautiful color) in the butter; 1 can creamed style corn and 1 can whole kernel corn.  I'd encourage you to try these modifications.  This is quite the Thanksgiving side dish!  Note: start sauteing in an oven safe pan so you can bake it without having to dirty a casserole dish!

I am not fond of corn; I was forced to find a corn casserole recipe for my husband. I chose this one because it is effortless.  I used real butter in place of margarine.  I was shocked how wonderful this tasted!  It is almost like cornbread stuffing without the hassle.  I will make this every Thanksgiving- a new tradition...I might add some green chilies to give it some zing next time, but then again it was so tasty and easy the 1st time!

Very easy, but you really have to love corn to love this dish.  Less butter is a must.  1/2 cup is enough.  I used low fat sour cream and one can of regular corn and 1 of creamed corn.It was a bit bland.  I will probably not make it again.

This recipe was great; very easy to make and delicious.  However, I would make it with just 1/2 cup of margarine instead of a full cup -- it was a little greasy.

I've always made this recipes for holidays and it's SO good! The difference between mine and this recipe is that I add some *sour cream* to the batter before I bake it..which makes the texture nice and moist! Also, I don't use quite as much onion. But great recipe overall.

My wife and I loved this recipe. The kid didn't but she's picky.. I used a deeper casserole dish, Jiffy mix and cooked it uncovered for about 30 min. longer until it was more solid. Turned out great!

Delicious and easy to throw together.  I had to cook mine for close to an hour before the center became firm.  I ended up removing the foil for the last 15 min.  Next time I'll reduce the amount of butter as others have suggested.

I used only a few tablespoons of margarine. I also doubled the cornbread mix. It was delicious. Next time I also think I will try adding some peppers to make it a little spicy.

Love It!!  My mother-in-law has a similar recipe and liked this one better.  super easy and great with any Sunday dinner.  Onions and creamed corn make a sweet treet without being too sweet for a side dish.  Gotta try it!!  This will be one of those recipes you are going to pass on to YOUR future daughters-in-law.

Love this recipe; I've been making it for years and it's always a hit at holiday parties. I make a few changes to it, however. Instead of 2 cans of creamed corn, I do 1 can creamed corn, 1 can sweet corn. I also add 1/2 cup of sour cream to the mix. Gives it that extra kick that really makes the recipe.

I had to find a corn recipe for my daughter for school and i chose this one. This recipe is totally awesome. The students and teachers loved it. The only change i made was using two boxes of corn muffin mix instead of one. A simple, quick wonderful recipe.

Very good. However, I would recommend baking it about 10-15 minutes longer than suggested. Also, like everyone else, I did cut the margarine in half. One cup was just way too much margarine.

This is very good and an easy side dish to put together. I modified to 1/2 c margarine and used one can of whole kernel corn and 1 can creamed corn and 1/4 c chopped onion. I served it with meatloaf and mashed potatoes and salad.

I loved this dish.  Definitely need to cut back on the margarine.  I don't even think I used 1/2 cup and that was plenty.  My cornbread mix was smaller than called for because that's what was available.  I sauteed the onion so it would be soft and sweeter. I forgot to put the foil on until the last 10 minutes but it turned out beautifully.  Served a scoop of it in each bowl of Black Bean Chili (from this site) and it was delish.  Thank-you Tracie.

I made this with one can cream corn and one can whole kernel corn, and worried that it wouldnt come out right, it looked really runny. But it baked up with a nice fluffy cornbread texture. This one is better than a lot of the other recipes on this site that call for a lot more ingredients too.  The onion gave it a great flavor. This is comfort food! And I will search no more for a corn casserole recipe!

WAY too much butter here. Came out greasy. Tried it again with 2T butter, added a cup of grated sharp Cheddar, much better. However, I like some of the other similar recipes on this site better, ones with sour cream and one can of regular corn.

This was sooooo easy and it tasted so good! I only made a couple of changes. I uncovered it and let it bake for about 1 hour and 30 minutes and about 20 minutes before it was done I sprinkled the top with cheddar cheese.  Definitely will be a family favorite!

This recipe is SO good and super easy to make.  The only thing is it takes MUCH longer than 45 minutes.  The two times I've cooked it it's taken about twice that (and it was in two different ovens).  Just be ware when you're preparing for guests, give plenty of time for this dish to cook!

I made a few modifications, but this was excellent! I was trying to cut back on fat, so I cut the butter down to a half cup, and because of personal preference I also substituted one can of whole kernel corn for the creamed corn. This was my first time making corn casserole and it turned out great! This one's a keeper, thanks!

I definitely modify/cut some ingredients.  I make it with 1 can creamed corn, 1 can regular corn (drained), 8 oz. fat-free sour cream, 1/2-1 stick butter (based on preference) and 1 box corn bread mix. Mix, pour, bake, enjoy!

This was very good!  Nice change from the ordinary sides.  Everyone here enjoyed this dish, espically dh, who doesn't even like cream corn went back for 5 or 6 helpings.  I lose count on his return trips.  My only change, was that I left off the cheese and brushed the top with butter and sugar a few minutes before taking it out of the oven.

This was very tasty. Unlike the other reviews that said to use one can creamed corn and one can kernel corn, we decided to stick with two cans creamed corn. We specifically did this because we only had polenta in our pantry, no corn muffin mix. We used 1/4 cup polenta and mixed it in with the corn mixture. The taste and texture of the polenta with the sweet corn tasted just like a corn muffin mix. Worth a try!

Yum! I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 square glass dish. I added some diced green peppers and some sliced cheese on top 5 mins before it was ready. Delicious!

This was an absolutely AMAZING recipe! I have never made corn casserole before and this was loved by all of the family.  I did follow some of the other reviewers advice and decreased the butter to 1/2 cup; I also added a dollop of sour cream, some shredded colby jack cheese and garlic/onion powder to taste.  This will most certainly become a recipe that I use often!

Very eary to make, but I was looking for something with more flavor, and the texture was a little too loose for my liking. However, my family liked it.

Easy and outstanding!  Definitely not lo-cal, but a great dish to take to covered dish or for Thanksgiving dinner.  I made it once for Thanksgiving, and from that year on it was considered a "must have" for my family.

I love this recipe!  I made it yesterday for Thanksgiving and it was everyones favorite.  It doesn't have a real harsh corn taste, and its very creamy!  The only thing I changed is that I baked it a little uncovered for about 10 extra minutes.

I love, love, love this casserole.  I would eat it everyday if my waistline would allow it.  The prep was very easy and it is a kid friendly dish.  I add a can of regular corn in place of one of the cans of creamed corn for a different texture.  I plan to take this to every funtion I go to from now on.

This recipe is awesome and there never is leftovers even if you double it. you can also try substituting 1 can of whole kernal corn fot one of the creamed corns. it makes it stick together a little more but still tastes delicious.

Wow! What more could you ask for of a recipe? This one's got it all: inexpensive, simple ingredients; fast, low effort preparation; and delicious, people-pleasing result. This Thanksgiving favorite will easily become a family dinner staple! Since it keeps well, it would also make a great potluck choice. Use of real butter as opposed to margarine gives this casserole a rich flavor. Can't think of anything else I would do to change this gem! My mom used crackers in hers and was intrigued when I suggested she try cornbread mix instead as hers tends to be a bit on the dry side. No offense, Mom! Kudos, Tracie!

Great!. Fast and Easy to make. Real comfort food. I used butter, not margerine. You could probably use less, but I didn't. You could also add, chopped red peppers or a few jalapenos if you wish. Real Good!
My husband loved it and so did my young children.

This is a fast and easy dish. Adjustments made - I melted the margarine in the microwave and mixed everything in a bowl first. I took the aluminum foil off for the last 10 minutes of baking to brown the top of the casserole. I had a 16-ounce package of cornbread in my pantry and used the whole box (instead of the 8-ounce package suggested in the recipe) and it came out just fine. My 3YO twins helped me put it together. A great and simple dish to serve with as a side to chicken, turkey, or pork.

I haven't made corn casserole before, flavor is very nice. I'm a big cornbread fan, I think I would add more cornbread mix? or maybe I should just make cornbread ?I'm saving the recipe though, it tastes very good and I'm ever asked to make a corn casserole I would make this again.

When I was told how this was made, I was very sceptical.  When I tasted it it, I was pleasantly surprised.

I only used 1 stick of butter, a small container of plain Greek yogurt, 1 can of cream corn, 1 can of regular corn and the rest of what the recipe called for.  My husband isn’t a big fan of cornbread because he says it’s dry, but we ate the whole thing with our black eyed peas!  It was so moist and delicious.  I will make it again. It took longer to bake than the recipe says.

Delicious. Made it twice. I think the recipe should call for one STICK of margarine instead of one CUP. Had to cook it longer the first time because there was too much butter. It turned out a little greasy, but the taste was excellent. The second time, I only used one stick and it turned out according to the directions. And yes, based on personal preference, I use real butter instead of margarine.

Love the ease of this recipe and the great taste !!  I, like most others, substituted one can of creamed corn for one can of whole sweet corn.  I did add diced chili's and I sautéed the onion in an oven safe pan, then transferred the whole thing into the oven with an oven safe lid.  Went a little longer on the cooking, and I used the 1 cup of butter.  I liked the moistness the extra butter gave the dish.  I think it would have been dry otherwise.  Which for some, is what they look for in a casserole.  For me, I was looking for moist and tasty.  I got it.  Will use this recipe again, and again...

I liked it. It wasn't impressive enough to make again. My husband said the consistency grossed him out. It was very sweet. I'd prefer it not so sweet. Maybe next time I would make my own corn bread mix.

I followed the recipe as written. Though it looked like the picture, it was'nt that good. I thought the flavor was so-so. My two sons didn't like it at all. My wife thought it was mediocre. I'm sorry, but this recipe goes to circular file (trash).

Made a few adjustments used a whole can corn and a less onions. We all love this recipe. It is away from the normal cornbread. Will hand this recipe down to the next generation. Teaching this to my daughters already.

This recipe tastes great, but I agree that less butter is important.  A layer of oily butter was left on top and didn't appear very appetizing.  I will make again, but with less butter.

This is a really good casserole- very easy to prepare and great taste - BUT - way  too much butter - next time I'll only use 1/2 cup - maybe less - cheese might be a good addition, but it is good without it.

This wasn't too bad...my husband really liked the flavor, but not so much the consistency.  I personally thought it was a little too oniony & maybe that was becase I didn't chop them up finely enough.  Nice side dish.

This is my favorite dish and has been for years.

I use one can creamed and one can kernel corn.

I also like to pour this into muffins intead of the cassorole so it's easier for  people to grab at functions.  

Other recipes sometimes call for sour cream but i haven't been able to get the dish to cook right with the sour cream.

the first time I ever had this dish was at a work potluck and I scared off a co-worker for the last piece (my third helping). 


Great Recipe.  thanks

This recipe was a little mushy.  I used Jiffy cornbread mix and this made the casserole very sweet.  If I make this again I will use a 16oz pkg like ginny did before me.

My husband and I loved it.  My son wasn't too thrilled, but that can be expected of a 3 year old.
