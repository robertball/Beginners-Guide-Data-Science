This is a classic French dish.  You will get the same affect if you use 20 cloves of garlic, cut in half.  The smaller you make garlic, the more potent it becomes.

Yum! Used cut up chicken for convenience and chicken stock for the baking liquid which I then thickened at the end to make a velvety sauce to coat the chicken. This is easy, inexpensive, and very tasty!

I found this similar recipe on the garlic bag.  It used only olive oil, 1/4 cup.  It included also, 1/2 cup white wine, 1/4 cup dry vermouth, juice of one lemon, 1 tsp of dried oregano, and minced fresh parsley.  After putting all the ingredients on the chicken, place in a covered roasting pan 40 minutes on 400, then uncovered for another 30 to 35 minutes, and it was delicious.  Thanks for providing this recipe, and I hope you try it with the extra ingredients.

The first time I made this, even with all the garlic, the chicken hadn't picked up much flavor. I made it a second time, rubbing the chicken with more herbs and such. Then, after it was baked, pulled out the garlic to puree together with just a touch of melted butter - to poor over everything. Amazing. And perfect to sop up with a big fluffy roll.

I received a dutch oven for Christmas (thanks mom!) and this recipe turned out wonderfully in it.  I used about 30 cloves of garlic, minced.  After browning the bird, I tossed in the garlic, returned the bird to the pan, then added halved white potatoes, a yellow onion quartered, and two carrots cut into large pieces.  I then added the remaining ingrediants for the original recipe, topped the pot with the lid and put into the preheated oven.  This chicken as small, so it cooked in about an hour, and the aroma that filled the house was amazing.  I let the bird rest for ten or so minutes before removing from the pan.  I put the veggies in another bowl to serve alongside, and to make a quick gravy, added a can of campbell's wild mushroom condensed soup mix to the butter/garlic/olive oil drippings.  My husband loved the meal.  Thanks!

This recipe was very good and very easy. One of the few reliable one-pot wonders. The only difference is that I used minced garlic since my family LOVES garlic. Minced garlic is much more potent. I would have like the skin to be a bit crispy, but with the amount of liquid that's released, I would have had to taken the chicken out of the dutch oven and crisped it on a cookie sheet. Nevertheless, this was very good.

I've been making this for years. It's great and the garlic gets nice and sweet. I've also just used thighs with 20 cloves and that works great as well.

This was a huge hit for me and my girlfriend. I used a roasting bag with the chicken. I browned the chicken in the pan with the butter and olive oil, then just added the spices and the lemon juice and water straight into the bag with the chicken, then added the garlic to the pan to start extracting the flavor and then added that to the bag  well. After the chicken was finished cooking, I took the bag out and dumped the contents into a bowl and mashed the garlic and mixed that up. It made a perfect sauce for the chicken. It is my new favorite recipe and I will sure be making this again for my parents.

SO so so so GOOD!  Loved this!  This recipe was suggested to me and I adapted it for drumsticks.  I did it just as the recipe calls for and it was delicious!  I had the table all set, platter fixed just right so I could add my photo BUT I went to get the camera and by the time I got back to the kitchen the hubs had already filled everyones plates! Arghhhhhhh!  LOL there went my perfect shot.  Thankfully I will make again and get my pic up there too!-*-*-* Made this AGAIN, for my brother cuz it was THAT good!  Got a pic this time.... also again, adapter for drumsticks.

Good!  Instead of adding water, I squeezed a whole lemon over the chicken and put the rinds into the chicken cavity. Had to uncover the pan and cook a bit longer than 90 minutes. Forgot the thyme.  Pre-browning makes chicken look good!

I made this recipe for my family I served it over a bed of creamy rissoto. Although I did not make it exactly to specification I did not stray far from the original recipe. I seasoned the chicken prior to searing and instead of using 1/4 cup water I substituted with almost 1 cup of good Chardonnay wine. I also added the zest of the lemon with the thyme on top of the chicken. This was a superb recipe. You can never go wrong with the combination of lemon, chicken, butter, and garlic. I fell my addition of the wine added another dimension of flavor to this already wonderful idea. Thank you!

Wow, roasted garlic and super moist chicken. This was very yummy. I had this recipe recommended looking for recipes to use up a 1.5 lb bag of peeled garlic. No way, I would have sat and peeled that much garlic. It almost got my bag to half. If making this recipe that is the way to go. The bag is between $2-$3 dollars at a whole sale club. When the recipe says to remove part of the cooking fat make sure to do that. The garlic produces plenty of liquid as it cooks down. I had my chicken in the oven 90 minutes, but it got left another 30 minutes due to being busy. The one I used was around a med-lg size. After I took the foil off I thought the skin needed some crisping. I set the oven to 420 and put it back in the oven uncovered about 15 more minutes. I planned to take a pic but when I lifted it all of the meat fell right of the bone. For some that is a problem, for me that equals super moist chicken. I think this will make good sandwiches with a piece of chicken and some of the smeared roasted garlic. It was tasty too. ty

This was really good and very easy.  Next time, I will really drain most of the oily base (as prescribed), and make sure that the seasonings are evenly spread over the chicken.  I cooked two 5-pound birds at 375 degrees convection and they were done in less than 90 minutes.  Garlic was mellow and fragrant.

The first time I made this I was disappointed with the lack of flavor. The next time I crushed 10 of the garlic cloves and that added a lot more flavor, also used chicken stock and wine for the liquid. Yummy! Now I love it!

Good but not what I was expecting! With 40 cloves of garlic, I was expecting FLAVOR! Little disappointed. I will try making again, maybe, searing the chicken more, adding more herbs, I will find a way!

Very flavorable. The smell was terrific while it was cooking. I only had about 10 cloves of garlic and did not realize it until prep time, but the chicken did not seem to suffer as far as flavor goes! Will make again, but next time, I will just put in already cut up chicken pieces as this was a lot of work and I have never cut up a chicken before and some went to waste.

Really, really good. I leave the step out where you remove the chicken to a cutting board and drain liquid. I just lift the chicken up a little after browning and throw the garlic cloves in. This smells wonderful while it is cooking. I make this once a week!

Delicious!  I did 2 chickens cut up.  I added 1 1/2 cups Pinot, 4Tbsps honey, fresh thyme, rosemary, olive oil and 40 cloves of garlic.  I put a garlic clove under the skin of each chicken piece.  This was out of this world.  Try it you'll love it!

Best chicken ever!  Added quartered onion and lemon wedge along with two chopped garlic cloves to the chicken cavity.  Browned all sides of chicken and drained excess chicken drippings prior to roasting, seasoned as prescribed and removed lid for final fifteen minutes of cooking time to make for crispy skin. The added bonus was a beautiful gravy made from the chicken drippings, combined with one cup of homo milk mixed with three tablespoons of blending flour, a dab of butter and the garlic cloves after mashing them with potato masher.  So good.  My dinner guest rated the meal an enthusiastic 10/10.  WOW.

Incredible Awesomeness!!! Followed the recipe to a tea, except to peel and quarter an onion and stuffed it in the bird, and I only had 32 cloves (only, lol!) Afterwards I used the pan juices (plus the juices I had saved from the beginning) with some corn starch and milk to make gravy. I had planned to puree the garlic into the gravy, but the were not soft enough - so sad. I will try to notice next time and cook them further even if the chicken comes out. Served with rice and some cubed butternut squash I tossed in olive oil, brown sugar, and a bit of cayenne. Truly memorable meal. Timing was just right!

Really good! I made according to the recipe, but I added red potatoes to the Dutch oven with the chicken & sprinkled fresh, chopped parsley on top before slicing & plating.

So flavorful! I didn't have the patience to properly brown the chicken on all sides, and I forgot to remove the juices from the Dutch Oven prior to adding the garlic, but this was super moist and delicious!

Personally I prefer to lightly coat the chicken in a bit of flour before browning it.  Also include 1-3 stalks of celery (depending on how large/intense the flavor), prefer rosemary with chicken, but thyme is fine; add a good sized splash of cooking sherry, use chicken broth instead of water, and well, we prefer to serve this dish with pan-toasted slices of French or Italian bread rather than the rolls one pinner enjoys - - - the garlic spreads so well and meshes so well with toasted sliced crusty loaf types of bread....... yum!...... We've *never* been low on flavor, though, in our estimation, the flavor of the garlic is best used on the bread..., and no, it is not intense garlic in the chicken - just great eats!

Excellent. Only hard part was turning the whole chicken. Served it with roasted brussels sprouts.

Very good. I followed another commenter's advice to add wine.

The one thing this needs is more water! The pan went dry in the oven a couple of times, leaving crunchy garlic cloves.

Chicken was good, flavour was nice, chicken was moist and fell off the bone. Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I didn’t like the way the skin was. I like my skin nice and brown and crispy. With this recipe is came out very light brown and the skin was soft and mushy. Wont make it again but thank you for the recipe was worth trying out.

Okay, I really deviated from the recipe. I'm not a huge fan of garlic so I cut that to about 1/4, I used chicken stock instead of water and stuffed the chicken with onion before baking- oh, and used lime instead of lemon juice.  It was really moist and delicious.  I like to get ideas from these recipes and go rogue. Hope you enjoy

This is a great starting place. Wonderful flavor. I used Marsala, and chicken stock as well as the lemon and dried thyme. When done we use the garlic cloves to spread on a crusty Baggett.

I made this once and now every time I see a whole chicken, I think of this recipe.  Make this one time, and you will never go back to just baked chicken again.  Moist and Juicy and delicious.

This is really good, and I like it cooked down to get it a little crunchy from the pot.
