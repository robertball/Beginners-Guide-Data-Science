Absolutely delicious! I was searching for a recipe that included butternut squash and chicken and decided to try this one. I did not know what to expect, but after one bite, I felt like I was in the Caribbean! The bananas were a pleasant surprise!

Was intrigued by the ingredients so decided to give it a whirl.  Itâ€™s a fantastic recipe. Really easy to make.  I used boneless thighs instead of breasts. This one is a keeper.
