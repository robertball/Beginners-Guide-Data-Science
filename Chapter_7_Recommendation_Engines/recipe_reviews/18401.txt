This is a superior Tiger Butter recipe.  Not only were the butterscotch chips far more flavorful than the white chocolate used in other recipes, but the appearance was outstanding also with the chocolate chips swirled into it.  Great recipe, extremely easy, and highly recommended!!  Helpful hint: Line the 8x8 pan with waxed paper first.  After candy is hardened, lift waxed paper out.  This makes both slicing the candy and clean-up easier.

I made this for my sons cubscout banquet.  It was extremely easy to make, and my son and husband loved it.  It looked very nice.  I do recommend using wax paper.  And cut into small pieces, as it is extremely sweet.

I used a little less butterscotch chips and 1 1/2 cups of rice cereal.  I didnt cut the cooled candy, I just broke it with my hands.  Very yummy!  Thanks!

This was a good start, but needs at least 1/2-1 cup more of the crisp rice cereal, and probably more peanut butter to butterscotch chips. Like other reviewers, I thought they were too sweet, but I think with these changes they would be great. Also, I forgot the wax paper tip (line the pan with wax paper before spreading the mixture) and deeply regretted it. Next time!

I made this for Christmas to give as gifts, but there wasn't any left, so I had to make another batch.  It's really good.  I added some peanut butter chips along with the butterscotch chips and it turned out great.  I think I'll be making this throughout the year.  Thanks Mary Ann.

This was quick, easy, and had good flavor, but was way too sweet for my taste.

I used one and three-quarter cups rice cereal and it is still too sweet. Tasty but very sweet.
