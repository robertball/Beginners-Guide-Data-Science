I don't remember ever having a knish as an adult,, maybe I did but cannot remember. This definitely is my first time making them.  I wasn't sure what "very thin" really meant so I googled it. Anyone coming after me, it really mean paper thin. I know I didn't roll this out thin enough but I think I did okay for a first timer. It seemed the preferred topping on this was spicy mustard so that's what I used. Really tasty.. I liked them both hot and cold
