Excellent recipe and easy to make. I grilled(instead of fried) the pork with a dill sauce and pickle juice marinade and added a tablespoon and a teaspoon of dill sauce to the sauce mixture. It was unbelievably good. It's now one of my favorite recipes!!

I followed suggestion of a previous reviewer and pan-fried chops seasoned with bouillon and seasonings.  Then removed the chops and made the sauce in the same pan.  Didn't have yogurt so substituted sour cream - rich and yummy!  Served the sauce on the side and also used it for dipping cooked veggies (broccoli and asparagus works great!). We loved this one.  A really easy way to dress up ordinary pork chops and quite a treat for low-carb diets!

After growing up on breaded pork chops, I am always looking for a variation on pork chops.  This was a unique, quick and delicious recipe. I liked how light the sauce was.  I will make it again!

Made this recipe for  my husband. It was quick, easy and delicious! I butterflied the pork chops and fried them. While I fried them I seasoned them with the bouillon and garlic salt. Then when I removed them to a plate I took the pan and poured the dijon-dill sauce into it scraping off the sides and bottom. After about a minute I served the chops with corn and the sauce slightly warmed from the pan. FANTASTIC!

Good recipe when you are tired of another grilled chop.  The sauce on the side was a nice and different taste.  I also dipped my steamed brocolli in it.  Made half of the pork chops with Emeril's Original Essence instead of the chicken boullion.  Really tasty both ways.

This was OK--not exceptional, but tasted good enough.

Pretty good.  I used chopped garlic and some salt instead of garlic salt because that's all I had on hand - fast, tasty, and the sauce was delicious and easy.  I would definitely make it again.
