Outstanding! I love horseradish and I could kick myself for not trying to create this myself - very simple to make and enjoyable for everyone whether they like the heat or hate it :) I use it on nearly everything! I do think I'd like to experiment with it as well... a little teensy bit of garlic....

This is the best, most elegant horseradish sauce ever!  I whip the cream to the soft peak stage then add the horse radish and remaining ingredients to taste and continue whipping to firm peaks. It stiffens very quickly, so watch that you don't over beat!  Great addition as a condiment on roast beef or cheese steak sandwiches, too.  Mmmmm, good!

This was delicious. I made it for our Sunday Roast and had compliments all around. It was easy to do while the Roast was resting. Will definately make again and again.

Fantastic!  I made a double batch for Christmas dinner.  I didn't add the hot pepper sauce and increased the amount of white pepper.  I used prepared horseradish and it turned out great!

This is pretty good. I prefer the way I usually make it though- equal parts whipping cream and horseradish...and I only whip it to the point right before it holds peaks.

A little mild for the tastes of my party. I used fresh horseradish and doubled the amount.

I made this for a Christmas Day Roast and it came out Fantastic.  I made it exactly as the recipe called  for about three hours before dinner and tasted it as I put in the fridge.  The taste of the Cider vinegar seemed very strong.  When served the Sauce was smooth creamy and the blended ingredients complimented each other perfectly.  Even those who cannot take a lot of "Heat" enjoyed it!

Great foundation for a twist on horseradish sauce...we of course took the recommendation to add hot sauce, the white pepper and horseradish to taste. So the final dish was a zesty and zingy sauce! TY!

Made as written and it was good, but not great.  To me, it lacked enough kick, so the next time I make this, And I will make this again.... I will make a few adjustments.  All in all though, it's a good base and very light and fluffy!

This is really good and elegant.  It is a mild sauce, even after adding more horseradish.  But if you are looking for a little something to add this is perfect.  Those who want more zing can always add more!

Excellent!  I don't have white pepper in the house.  I just whipped the cream, added a lot of horseradish and 2 pinches of salt.  Tastes just like in the restaurants. A+

Sorry to disagree, but I found this really bland. I added a lot more pepper and horseradish, but it still lacked flavor. I will stay with my trusty recipe; five to one ratio of sour cream to horseradish.

I am not a horseradish fan but my family loves it so I gave this recipe a try and I loved it! SUPER! It made a LOT of sauce and no it does not last indefinitely but well worth making it!

Yes, I have made it several times and I increased the horseradish to 4 tbl.  It could still use more.

I really liked this with the one exception that I should have added at least 1 more tablespoon of horseradish...if not more. I like it to be spicier

I have not tried this recipe, but love this concoction.  At a local steak house they serve it with Prime Rib and call it Tiger Sauce.  I make my own with heavy cream, whipped to soft peak, salt and prepared horseradish.  YUM!
