I made this Recipe exactly as listed and they turned out delicious! 
Nearly the same as the Funnel Cakes you buy at the Fair and oh so easy to prepare.

Just like the county fair. Added two more TBS of water to help thin it a little. Also added Strawberry sauce on top. SO yummy everyone is already asking me to make them again.

This was the best funnel cake recipe I tried! I did add about 2-4 tbsp more flour in the end though. It was perfect! I would make it again.

So good, oil must be about 375, and I used slightly less vanilla. My friends beg for me to make these all the time

These came out great!  It took me a little to get the size of the batter stream right but they fried really nicely. I used peanut oil because it has a high smoke point, and I flipped them by just dragging a skewer across the pan, flipping and stretching them back out.  Delish!
