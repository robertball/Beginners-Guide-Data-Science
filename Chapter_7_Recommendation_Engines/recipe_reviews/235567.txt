We loved this recipe; I had sambal chili paste on hand and used that. The chili, orange and garlic gave great flavor while the vinegar in the marinade made the chicken oh so tender.  This one is a keeper.

While I had a hard time finding Calabria Pepper Sauce, I finally found it and made this recipe to original "specs". It was excellent. I'll put this into my grilling rotation.

It was incredible! I started chicken on grill with bricks on it. After it got some char, I moved it to the kitchen. I finished them on 400* on a cookie sheet basting every 10 minutes. This was one of the best chicken dishes I have ever made. It was incredible and juicy. The flavors were like nothing I've ever had. We heated the marinade up, and drank it like soup. =) Don't be afraid to cook a little longer than normal (maybe to 170*). It is so ridiculously juicy; it can handle it. Thank you, Chef! I am a better cook because of you!

Easy to do and very tasty! I have added some ginger to the marinade and marinated for 24 hours. Grilled both sides for 15 minutes and then completed by roasting in the owen. Served with roasted potatos mixed with rosemary and garlic oil.

Made for  a graduation party and the guests raved!  It is simply grilled chicken but there seems to be something really special about this recipe.   I made a double patch as it was a big guest list.  I accidentally purchased whole calabrian chilies from Amazon, but it didn't seem to be a problem.  I wanted to try a dish that had calabrian chilies in it, as Bobby Flay is always using them.  It was a fun and successful experiment!

We loved this recipe even though I didn't have Calabrian sauce and I forgot the egg (I was distracted by a kitchen full of noisy adults).  I used Texas Pete hot sauce instead of Calabrian but I will find the "right stuff" next time.  I cooked two small chickens instead of Cornish hens since we had four adults eating.  I cooked the birds on a Green Egg  running about 500 Â°F.  This caused the chickens to be somewhat overdone but I like mine to be right at the point of falling apart.  The chickens looked and tasted great .

Very moist and flavorful. I made it with game hens Needed to substitute sambal oelek for calabrian chili sauce.  Will add more next time,not spicy but the citrus shined through with a new flavor combination that we enjoyed!  Not the same old stuff.   Thank you Chef John

Never again.  The marinade was a total flop.  It added nothing to the flavor of the chicken and merely resulted in wasting some fairly expensive ingredients.

we enjoyed this dish and actually used the cornish hens.. as always i deviated a little using what i had on hand.. subbed red wine vinegar for the white.. mayo for the veg oil and omitted the egg all together.. used dried rosemary (1/4 the amount).. subbed garlic chili sauce for the calabrian.. and used regular table salt for the kosher.. we used our Marinator to speed up the marinating process as we only had a couple of hours.. i'm sure it would have been better with more time.. we heated the leftover marinade and basted throughout.. very tasty.. i'll definitely try this again on chicken pieces.. ty for the recipe

It was delicious!  Deboned the thighs before cooking. Poured some of the gravy on some gnocchi and topped it with the chicken.
