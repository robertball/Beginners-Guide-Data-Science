I was a little worried about this recipe because there were so many conflicting reviews. I made them exactly as the recipe called (except I used regular butter instead of unsalted, I like the extra bit of saltiness if it is noticable at all!) I added about 1 1/2 cups of mini chocolate chips. I got impatient and stirred them into the warm butter-sugar mixture and got a little marbling. They came out PERFECT! My fussy family could not get enough and gobbled them up. I noticed that by watching them very, very closely and taking them out the moment they were done, I completely avoided the hard, inedible edges that usually accompany brownie type bars. I am making these again!! This time with nuts and chocolate. Mmmm...heaven!

Oh man, so delicious! As someone who doesn't really care for chocolate it might come as a suprise that I've never actually had a Blondie. I made 1/3 of the recipe in a 9x9 square pan and used dark brown sugar instead of light. They are super chewy, almost caramel-y in flavor and really satisfy the sweet tooth. :)

Waaaaaay too greasy.  I was looking for the kind of blondies that the old ladies used to bring to covered dish suppers at my grandmother's church, and this isn't it.  Instead of a brownie-like consistency, these are very dense and heavy.  I followed the recipe exactly (I hate it when people here give negative reviews and they've made changes to the recipe!) and although I questioned using THREE STICKS of butter in this recipe, I still did that...and now I wish I'd left one of them out.  Not your grandmother's blondie at all!  Sorry Pam, but I won't make these again.

I was torn on to give this 3 stars or 2. This is not all THAT great. Nothing to be excited about. They were OK and I really don't care for them. What really made me give this rating was the hardness. It took me a long time to get onepiece out of the pan.

These blondies are really great. I made them almost exactly as this recipe called except I made a smaller batch and used Dark Brown Sugar (didn't have light). They are great. Very moist, buttery and delicious! I have no idea what all of these bad reviews are about. It is possible that the directions are a little hard-to-follow.

I reduced the sugar to 2 cups and the butter to 2 sticks after reading other reviews about this being too greasy and sweet.  It turned out as a very flat and dry cake.  It was in no way like a blondie.  Neither my husband or I liked it.  One positive note was that it did make the house smell very nice while it was baking.

Wow, that's what a blondie should taste like--  gooey and sweet.  I didn't add nuts or chips, but next time I think I'll add toasted pecans to the batter.

I have been making this recipe since May 2006 when I ripped it out of the Sunday USAToday, and everytime I make it, it gets rave reviews.  My add-ins are 1C dried cranberries, 1C ch pecans, and 1C white choc chunks.  Be sure to let the batter cool before adding any chocolate, or you will have a melty mess.

I did not change the recipe at all, I've made these twice already because they are absolutely delicious. Fatty, but delicious. They bake better in a glass baking pan then metal one. I threw in some semi-sweet chocolate chips and covered the batter with sprinkles before baking and it was like tasting heaven. Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic recipe - I added chocolate chips during the blending of ingredients which marbelized perfectly.  The only change I'd make is maybe 2.5 sticks of butter, but they were great with the full 3!

No complaints about these blondies, very sweet, very moist. I like mine a bit gooey so I removed a tad early. A note for those afraid of butter, there is a noticeably large amount in this recipe, cutting down probably wouldn't hurt... but wasn't enough to seriously bother me.

Oh Yum. 

This is a very fudge-y brownies. If you prefer cake-y I recommend looking elsewhere. I was a little nervous about pouring hot/boiling sugar into the eggs so I let it cool slightly and the whisked constantly and the eggs did not scramble.  I added mini chocolate chips (half a bag) and Butterscotch chips (again about half a bag) Make sure to let the batter cool a lot if using mini chips! Mine melted a bit. But all in all a SUPER RICH Blondie. Yum

Very good.  First time Blondie baker/eater.  Taste like chunky, gooey wonderful chocolate chip cookies.  I put 100 grams of semisweet chocolate and a cup and a half of walnuts/pecans.  There is a great deal of both sugar and butter but keep in mind this is a very large recipe and there is no frosting.  This delicious as is but with ice cream and a salty caramel sauce, well you can just imagine....
In order to not cook the eggs, I mixed about half of the flour with them before putting the hot butter/sugar mix, then the rest of flour and lastly put unchopped nuts and chopped chocolate into my Kitchen aid.

These came out dry and needed more sugar (I used 2 cups instead of 3) and had the consistency of corn bread. I wasn't impressed.

Mmmmmm, these are very good. I added 1/2 c chopped pecans (should have added more) and they were delightful! I can't eat chocolate right now (nursing mama!) and with these around, I don't mind! I think i will try adding white chips next time too, for more crunch and texture! Soo good!

These blondies tastes fine, not too sweet, but kind of unremarkable. They were definately done ten minutes early, and a bit too cake-like for my liking. I like my brownies and blondies more dense.

This was certainly edible, but really was without flavour. I'm glad I tried a piece before attempting to feed it to others. I am going to try adding a chocolate topping or frosting that I think might help. I also used demerara brown sugar, which I assumed would add more flavour, but the end result was that the blondies weren't very blonde. Maybe light brown sugar would have made it sweeter. I also found them to be a little thick, so if I were to make it again, I would probably use two 8" pans as opposed to a 9x13.

Proportions yielded a far too sweet blondie. Have not tried with less sugar, so please comment if you have success.   Most other blondie recipes have much lower sugar to flour ratios, generally less than 1.

This is an amazing recipe!   Do not substitute all purpose flour for the cake flour (You can use all purpose and take out two tablespoons per cup out and replace with equal amount of corn starch and sift)   

I have made them plain (my husband prefers vanilla to chocolate) and I have added two bags of apple chips and a bag of caramel drops for caramel apple blondies that are out of this world!

Followed the recipe exactly. Only difference was it was in a 8x11 pan so I added time since they would come out thicker. Edges are good but middle is like fudge. Had to cut into super small bites for everyone at a party. Everyone tried, thought they were okay and didn't have another. Sorry. Won't make this again.

These were awesome! I halved the recipe, since I was only looking to make dessert for a few people. Because it called for three eggs, I used two. I suppose I could have used 1.5, but that seemed impractical/wasteful.  I also used a little less than half the amount of butter it called for.The flavor is exactly what I was looking for, though. I'm now eating more of them for breakfast. They are great with coffee.

This is great, if you want a cake. It wasn't very sweet and it was dry and crumbly. I followed the recipe exactly. It was better with ice cream on top

Big hit at the office Christmas pot-luck.  I only had dark brown sugar and didn't let the batter cool enough when I added a cup of chocolate chips, so they came out more like "Brunettes"  That said this is not the recipe for the light/fluffy blondies (my mom called them Congo Bars) that you may be expecting.

I dont understand the mixed reviews.  I have made these blondies several times, usually for family functions when my sister is attending......she gets  migrane's, so she stays away from chocolate.  I get rave reviews every time!  Today I am trying something a little different.......replacing 1 stick of butter with 8 ounces of applesauce, and using only 2 1/2 cups of sugar.   I will update with the results, but so far they smell delicious while cooking!

Yummy! I added chocolate chips but did not wait for the mix to cool enough, so the were a bit more like dark blondies... Lol

I have made this recipe with the chocolate chips several times now.  Everywhere I take them, people want the recipe.  They are so easy and so good!

These are quite good!! esp. to satisfy a craving for something gooey and sweet. I made 1/4 plain, 1/4 with dried cherries and 1/4 with cashews.  The nut ones were my favorite but my kids liked the plain ones better.  I was craving Blondies after watching a Bobby Flay throwdown episode with Blondies! I didn't find them too sweet or buttery for our tastes.
