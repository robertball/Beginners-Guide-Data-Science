Thankfully, I made this recipe the day before Thanksgiving and was able to redo everything before we had to eat the pie.  It was horrible!  The desert needs alot of sugar to sweeten it up.  I suggest adding about 2/3c. of surgar and 1/3c. brown sugar to the recipe.

I am such a poor baker and this recipe was so easy to follow...and I got to recycle my Halloween pumpkins!  The pies were delicious.  I added 3/4 cup brown sugar to the mix to sweeten it up.  It made two great Thanksgiving pies and I'm making one for Christmas!

Its a great recipe. My pies ended up very good and tasty, everyone loved them.  Other reviews give this pie a low rating because its not sweet enough, but thats because the recipe ask for a SUGAR PUMPKIN. If you sue a regular pumpkin then you need to add a few cups of sugar to compensate.  Seems like people don't like to read things through and complain when the result is not what they wanted, even tho its their own fault.

The recipe was short & sweet! The pie however was not sweet enough. The great thing about it was that it is perfect for diabetics. Other than the time of cleaning, cutting & cooking the pumpkin, it was easy. My kids loved it!!!

Sorry, but I just don't understand the high ratings for this recipe.  Thank goodness I read the reviews before I made the pie, because, call me dumb, but I probably would have completely overlooked the lack of sugar.  Along with this omission was the fact that no approximate measurement was given for the amount of pumpkin puree a "medium" sugar pumpkin would yield.  It seemed to me that 3 cups of milk was waaaaay too much, so I added 1 1/4 to what was about 1 1/2 cups of puree, and this created a very soupy mixture.  It's still in the oven as I write this, but I'm sceptical as to its outcome.  Luckily I have a can of pumpkin puree in the cupboard!

I was so disappointed in the waste of my time this recipe was. My spices were wasted, my pretty pumpkin was wasted, and these milky, bland pies were wasted.  I did add sugar, more then the advised spices and less milk and the pies still tasted like a big nothing. Please take this recipe off here so other poor little pumpkins won't be sacrificed for NOTHING.

Great recipe. However, yes, sugar is needed. I figured this out when I tasted the filling before baking and saad, hmm.. needs sugar. Also, maybe cut back a little on the milk. 2 cups, maybe 2 1/2, 3 is a bit too much.

This recipe calls for A SUGAR PUMPKIN. I bake my own pumpkin in the oven for my pies. I add sugar because I use a regular pumpkin. If I used a sugar pumpkin then I would not add sugar.

Me and a girlfriend of mine were having one of our GIRLS nights ... you know, a bit of wine and baking ... Well I was soo tired searching for the best homemade Pumkin pie recipes I could find. Finally I got tired and this is the one I followed.  We made one pie  from scratch and one from Libby's Pumpkin Recipe. We realized that Libby's pie called for sugar and the homemade didn't!! What? A Pumpkin pie with no sugar!? Too late! the pies were already in the oven. There must be a typo in this recipe posting. We were at this all night and had nothing to show for it except one great tasting pie.

I always buy an extra pumpkin so that I can make "fresh" pies before Halloween. This was different than my usual boil method & my boyfriend really enjoyed it! Thanks for sharing!

I have mastered this recipe.  I've been using it for years! I use only 1 can of evaporated milk. (12 oz) I add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I add 1 tablespoon of vanilla.  I use 2 eggs instead of 4 and I use 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  (1 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown.  Sugar in the raw works best)  The key is to put ALL of the ingredients in a food processor and pulse until smooth.

This was a wonderful recipe I used it to show my four year how foods are created and made. It was simple and the taste was very good the only thing, I might try next time is fresh ginger,to give it a more bold taste.

Classic fresh pumpkin pie recipes (be sure to compare ingredients as there are several others here on AR) use 2C pumpkin/2 eggs/spices/ 1C brown sugar to make ONE deep dish 9 inch pie.  The spice mixture is off compared to other similar recipes which yields the bitter taste some are referring to.  Also appears this recipe forgot the sugar (and YES you still add sugar when using a 'sugar pumpkin') and attempts to stretch the ingredients to make 2 pies by using perhaps eggs/milk and shallow pan pies.  The volume of a deep dish pie (tradionally used for this) is considerably larger then the shallow pie pan.

I had a hard time giving this recipe even a one star rating. I followed the recipe exactly. The pie was not sweet at all, didn't taste like any of the spices I used. The amount of eggs and milk made it taste like a pumpkin quiche with no flavor. I ended up throwing the pie away, it wasn't even edible. I will NOT use this recipe again

Not hard at all just time consuming. But worth it. My family really enjoyed it. I did add a few of my own little ingredients like vanilia to get the spice flavor out but the rest was all yours. Thanks so much.

This is the second recipe I have used from this site....I wish I used Cindys Pumpkin Pie recipe like before..This recipe was a waste..I spent ALL day making 4 pies and was disgusted after I tried it.. If you want to make this pie add SUGAR..I wish I read the reviews BEFORE I made the pies.

I made the mistake of using this recipe to try my very first homemade pumpkin pie and I'm so terribly dissapointed. 

I had no idea how big a medium pumpkin should have been and I ended up having too much.

And of course, where on earth is the sugar?

Ingredients in the Real Homemade Pumpkin pie is so appealing, I am going to add them to my shopping list.  However, I am no a sugar nut, but this recipe has No sugar, white or brown.  I wouldn't touch a thing, but will add 1/3 cup dark and 1/2 cup white sugar.  Other than the sugar, this recipe is a hit and I am adding it to my Recipe Box.  
Keep Cooking...

I made this recipe for my Thanksgiving dinner and am sorry to say it was a big flop. I had my brain in park from doing so much and followed the recipe to the letter, not realizing there was no sugar in it. My Mother in law and My Mother had to point it out to me. How embarrasing!  The pie looked beautiful but was not sweet at all!

A sugar pumpkin, regardless of quality does not compensate for the complete lack of additional sugar. An additional 1/2 cup of brown sugar should suffice.  Next time, include the yield on your 1 medium sugar pumpkin.  Medium will vary between people and as spices are easy to overuse, especially in baking, a yield of 4 cups of puree and 6 cups of puree will make for incredibly large differences in taste.

Very good consistency and it looked flawless, but it just tasted like squash, that's it. I added brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and nothing made made it better.

ADD SUGAR.  So I read the reviews before I made the pie and added ~3/4 cup of sugar (for 1 pie). I used about 2 cups of pumpkin puree (for 1 pie). So delicious!

I think the omission of the sugar in this recipe has got to be a mistake.  All pies are made from sugar pumpkins or other sweet varieties intended for baking - search around for other fresh pumpkin recipes and you will see that. You either need to add sugar if you are using evaporated milk or you can use sweetened condensed milk in place of the two.

Just a tidbit of info I found. Most pumpkins commonly sold are large, grainy squash, they're not really intended for human consumption. Pie pumpkins are smaller, sweeter, less grainy textured pumpkins. This is likely the explanation for your need of extra sugar.

I should have read the reviews first!  This is not sweet at all.  Perhaps the original recipe was for "sweetened condensed" milk, not evaporated, or else someone forgot the sugar.

Just a note before you make it...the recipe should specified SWEETENED condensed milk.  That's where the sugar comes from.  My guess is that the folks who hated this pie bought the unsweetened kind unknowingly.  Otherwise, the recipe is good and simple.  Specifying how much pumpkin (in cups) should be used would also help.

Yup, much like the other posters said, I was hoodwinked. I didn't notice the lack of sugar in the recipe. The pumpkin filling was watery, but I threw it in the food processer and it incorporated very well that way. This is a good recipe if you're trying for an American indian or pilgrim kind of approach, where they probalby didn't have sugar, but we salvaged it by dribbling a mess of caramel ice cream topping on it. Maple syrup would go really well too, I think. Otherwise, this stuff isn't much good.

I read on one of the reviews that this was perfect for a diabetic. Guess what! I am a diabetic and I honestly wish I would have read the reviews first... This was my first pumpkin pie and it is horrible... I used a "medium" pumpkin (I know bcs thats what it sd when I bought it) but there was no taste, the milk was tooooooo much as the mixture was too soupy. Although I did add more pumpkin, some sugar, cinnamon and more of the spices; I came out with 3 pies that tasted like evaporated milk.

This was such a disappointment! It was my first pumpkin pie and when I went to take a bite I was literally too scared to eat it. When I finally did, it was just a salty blob of nothing. Dont waste the time with this pie.

I didn't look at the reviews or the rating before I made this pie which is unusual for me. I'm very glad that I tasted the mixture before I put the pie in the oven. Skip the salt, or, only use 1/3 of what it calls for. Also, add a half cup of brown sugar to the mix, or more if you like. Overall, the recipie was very easy, just had to modify it a bit for taste.

I had low expectations & was happily surprised... it was perrrrfect!  I added a cup of sugar, only used about 2 cups of milk & eyed the spices.  It was tricky mixing without a blender, but I didn't mind it a bit stringy.  It was a bit too sweet for me but just fine for my man. I will make this again. I took a photo of my pies for this page...

I think this recipe was easy & delicious, Of course there's no sugar...It calls for a sugar pumpkin which it naturally sweet, I added sugar gradually until I got the sweetness I liked..The milk was perfect, my pies came out wonderful..great recipe and great tasting!! Thanks!!
