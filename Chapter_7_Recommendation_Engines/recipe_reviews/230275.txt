This is one of my favorite soups to make for "comfort food" meals. I do increase the basil quite a bit (I throw in a HUGE bunch) and I usually do not use the full amount of milk. I add just enough to give it a creamy mouth feel without adding too much fat.  When I make this, I pair it with Italian Grilled Cheese sandwiches.

Wow! This recipe is delicious. The consistency is just right, cafe style. I used 5 cloves of garlic, a lot more basil (nearly half a cup), and only a cup of heavy cream. Turned out fantastic. Thank you, Sara, for this great recipe. We loved it and will certainly be making it again and again. Great with garlicky grilled cheese!

Canning!! Why didn't I think of that???? Midwife Jen, I think, suggested that and take her advice and mine. Double, triple or quadruple the recipe and can it. You'll love it on those cold rainy evenings, like tonight. I paired it up with an upscale grilled cheese. Now I'm fat, dumb and happy! Excellent soup and I'm just not a soup lover so these five stars are definitely worthy of this one! Thanks for a great recipe Sara!

This was amazing using all ingredients exactly as listed.  I've made good homemade tomato soup before with other recipes, but this will be my new "go-to" with no need to try others.  The flavor and creaminess are simply unsurpassed.  

By the way, for easiest prep, I did all of Step 1 in the morning and refrigerated.  In the evening, I started with Step 2 and dinner was on the table (along with grilled cheese sandwiches) in about 15 minutes.  At this point, I was dealing with cold soup, so blending was not nerve-wracking.  I'll be making this often!

Really nice soup. I sauted the veggies in stock and used non fat milk instead of cream to lighten the calories. It is still very delicious and tomatoe-y. I did add more basil. I liked rthis had ther veggies in it as well as the tomato sauce. Very easy and also tasted good cold

Loved this recipe!  I kicked up the basil and garlic for added flavor and added another small can of tomato sauce. Using a stick immersion blender made the process much easier and surely less messy. Served with grilled gouda on sourdough.  Perfect comfort meal on a rainy night.  Thanks for sharing, Sara!

Very good soup but there is an easier way. Hot tomato based liquids in a blender = stained lids and possible explosions. In the future I will puree all the veggies with the chicken broth and all the basil oregano in the blender. Place in the pan to warm/soften then add remaining ingredients. Same results, less work! Otherwise good recipe. Def needs more basil and maybe a bit less carrot.

This was great!  Best tomato soup recipe I've ever made.  I halved the butter and used canned unsweetened coconut milk in place of the cream to reduce the fat and it turned out great!  Very creamy and rich.  Delicious!  Will be a regular at our house.

I have gone 5 years on AR without leaving a review. With a family of five you just don't hit the nail on the head very often, really if ever, when it comes to dinner. This soup ROCKS! Everyone sucked it down. Made it just as directed, my son walked by and wrinkled his nose asking "what's with all the vegetables?" I assured him he would never know they were there. He had seconds! Thank you

The tomato sauce seems to be duplicated in the recipe - what is the correct amount of sauce?

Love the flavor the carrots add to this recipe.  I added a 1/2 cup or so of Parmesan cheese to the recipe at the end which I think added some needed salt and tang.

I made it with just a tad less heavy cream 3/4 C and 1/4 cup  of 1/2 and 1/2.  It was still delicious! I also used 2 carrots sliced instead of 15 baby carrots. I added extra Basil. I believe it is company worthy!

Thanks for sharing your recipe, Sara, this was a hit for lunch today, my hub's favorite.  I had veggies & fresh basil to use up from Christmas, this was perfect use of it.  Had to take some liberties with the recipe to use what I had on hand.  I sauteed the veg in 3 tbsp butter and a drizzle of oil, then added a 28 oz can crushed tomatoes.  I used a tomato/chicken broth and ended up using two cups, as my sauce/veggie mix was very thick (probably the crushed tomato sub).  I used a whole pack of fresh basil on it's last legs and a sprinkle of dried oregano.  I just pureed that mix in the blender, back in the pot, then added half and half to the mix until a nice consistency, about 1 1/2 to 2 cups.  I also added some white sugar, asd I like a little sweetness to counteract the acidity of the tomatoes.  Very good soup!

Wonderful!!! I used about 7 fresh tomatoes blended up in the blender instead of sauce and added extra garlic salt.  So good!

This was a wonderful soup! I shredded carrots, celery and sautéed in butter with onions and 4 chopped up plum tomatoes. Once veggies were soft I added 1/2 cup of white wine, once reduced I added the other liquid ingredients and used 1/4 cup fresh basil. I slow cooked for 2 hours, no need to puree, the veggies fall apart  to a wonderful consistency. I then added 1 cup fat free half and half instead of cream, simmer for an extra 20 minutes on low.Topped it with homemade croutons and fresh shaved parm, hubby said it was the best tomato soup he's ever had.

I swapped out items based on what I had on hand: McCormick dried onions instead of fresh, dried herbs instead of fresh, and Knorr bouillon cube instead of chicken broth. I also reduced the butter and the cream by half. Still delicious despite my inferior substitutions! It turned out a little salty for my taste buds--probably due to that bouillon cube and less cream added--but no one else thought so. I'd make this again.

I loved it; I knew I would, since I'm so fond of tomatoes and fresh basil.  I'm an experimenter, in the kitchen, and rarely follow recipes precisely.  Since it was just for me, I cut it down to two servings, used a can of tomato sauce with Italian seasonings, and since I had some ricotta leftover from making lasagna, I creamed it in the food processor and used that with a bit of whole milk in place of the whipping cream. It probably had a slightly more grainy texture than it would have with whipping cream, but it was fantastic and I'll make it again. Whether I make it the same, next time, will likely depend on what I have in the kitchen.  As I was making it, it occurred to me that it would be great made with a homemade vegetable broth instead of prepared chicken broth, and I'll likely do that next time.

This is a great recipe!! Loved it! I used much more basil than suggested and i used half cup less heavy cream and i also added a lil sugar to combat the acidity of the tomatoes. Great outcome!! I will be making it many more times in the future.

This is an amazing recipe! I'm definitely keeping it. I did increase the amount of basil a bit, added a small dollop of cream cheese, and added a dash of Parmesan cheese. Really good recipe and I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes tomato basil soup. (Or just anyone in general.)

Wow! This is a fantastic, and simple recipe.  I multiplied the recipe by six times, and made it pretty much as written, except I used fresh tomatoes from my garden (which is why I made so much).  I just used an identical weight of garden tomatoes to equal the weight of canned tomato sauce.  I bagged quarts of finished soup using my Food Saver and froze them.  I used a food processor to purée the reduced mixture in batches after I allowed it to cool, and probably added more basil than specified, again fresh from the garden.  I will keep this one for future use, to handle large tomato harvests. Thanks for sharing! UPDATE: I have now removed a couple of the quarts from the freezer to enjoy over winter, and this soup is even better than I remember it after the harvest. Wow, I can't get enough. EDIT2: Made this same recipe again, now that it's harvest season 2017.  Terrific again multiplying the recipe by five times this year.  The base recipe is getting easier every year, but my back is sore after peeling, coring, and chopping 12# of Roma tomatoes.  I found a hybrid Roma at burpee seeds though, and I'm getting tomatoes that are nearly 1# each (and they're Romas)!! Thanks again! 2019 EDIT: I multiplied the recipe by 6X again, and measured my output at 12 quarts, after reduction.  So, 2 quarts as written.

SUPERB!!! 10 STARS! I did make a few subtle changes only based on what I had on hand. I used 5 med. carrots, 1 lg. clove garlic, 3/4 cup of more chopped basil, 1 tsp. dried oregano, 2 tsp. salt & only 1 cup heavy cream. I did not use any tomato sauce only 2 qts. of home canned tomatoes. Thank you, thank you for the WONDERFUL recipe!

Made this yesterday.  Delicious!  Only change: after cooking veggies in a large pan, I set them to the side to cool.  Then put them in the food processor to puree.  Added 4 oz. of tomato sauce while pureeing.  Followed the rest of the directions as written.  I will make it again, substituting veggie broth instead of the chicken for lent.   Love this recipe.

Very good, although next time I'll cut back on the carrots.  I used 15 baby carrots from my garden and they added too much sweetness, but that's how my carrots grew.  Maybe with regular carrots it wouldn't have turned out that sweet.  Great anyway.

I just made this today exactly as directed and it was awesome!  I tripled the batch (having faith on the 5 star ratings) and everyone in the family loved it plus there's some left over to can for later.  Thanks for this recipe!  I'll be recommending this and making it again!

I doubled the recipe, adding more herbs and subbing shallots for Onion,  using substantially less cream.. Delicious.

Oh My!   This has got to be the BEST tomato soup ever!!!!   (And I detested tomato soup when I was growing up and as a  young adult.)  My  son always says that I did not make enough, even though I always double the recipe for leftovers the next day.   It is worth the trouble of chopping all the fresh veggies.  I do use only crushed tomatoes instead of the paste/sauce.  Sometimes I use fresh herbs and other times I have  used dried.  I like it with mor e herbs than it calls for in the recipe.  I also  use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream, and not as much as is called for in the recipe.  This is a keeper for sure.   So yummy.

My family loves this soup!  We chopped the veggies with the food processor and cook them with the chicken broth (adding water when needed) and then use the stick blender to puree.  I also made this and substituted the tomato sauce for pureed tomato, added italian seasoning and extra garlic.  I served over angel hair pasta and it was a huge success.  And the kids didn't even know they were eating veggies - don't tell!

I made this last night for my brother and I. The recipe is amazing. The soup had the right balance of sweetness/creaminess/flavour. Thank you for sharing it!

This was very easy and a hit with the hubby.  Took leftovers to work and co-workers were asking for the recipe.  I only blended 3/4 of the soup in blender to give it a little texture.  Definitely making this again.

This is one of the best soups I've ever made! I didn't change anything, but for shortcuts I'd suggest doing all of the chopping in a food processor and using an immersion blender if you have one. It made it a really quick meal!

Loved this recipe! Quick and easy, and downright delicious. I made a few modifications as recommended from other reviewers that really made the recipe suit our taste better.  I used 1/2Tbsp Dried Oregano, cut down on the creamer and only used 1/4c, used 3 Tbsp of Basil rather than 2.  The best tip from a reviewer was to blend the veggies after softened w/chicken broth, oregano, & basil, and then add to tomato sauce. It certainly made less of a mess and less hassle with same result.

I used 1tsp dried Oregano and 2tsp dried Basil, and simplified the whole purée process by using my immersion blender in the same pot.  This soup had great flavor, was filling, delicious and so EASY.  Paired it with grilled cheese triangles for the most perfect winter comfort food!

I had a large can of Tomato sauce sitting around and wanted to use it.  I tried this recipe and so far everyone who has tasted it loves it.  From 2 year to 67 years old.   I made grilled cheese sandwiches and grilled ham and cheese sandwiches to go with it and it made for an amazing meal. We are making it again tonight for a fried recovering from surgery.

Yum! Made this creamier by adding some cream cheese and also a little bit of crushed red pepper. I also went a little heavier on the half and half.

Definitely a family fave! Be prepared to double or triple. Great as is. If tomatoes sometimes upset your tummy, try replacing the celery with chopped fennel instead! AIDS digestion! No heartburn! You won’t tire of this one.

Fantastic as is & a great source of vegetables. I like that it’s not just tomato sauce and cream - the onions, celery, and carrots add so much depth and flavor.

The is absolutely fantastic!!!  We loved it and will definitely make again.  I added more basil -- a 5 ounce container of basil leaves (bought at Publix).  The only other change I made was putting it in the blender with everything except the tomato sauce - much easier and less messy.  Great recipe!

I’m actually sitting in front of a bowl of this amazing soup right now. It is one of my absolute favorite things to make and to eat! (I used dried herbs this time because that is what I had on hand and went a little overboard.  Be careful when using the dried ones, you’ll need a lot less. Also, don’t skimp on the cream. It really rounds it out. So nice!)

First time making tomato soup! I replaced heavy cream for 16 oz of coconut milk. Next time I would use more broth and maybe a little less tomato sauce to make it thinner.

Tasty soup. I normally don't like to review a recipe if I didn't make it as written. However, I simply didn't have all of the ingredients needed. I subbed one can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes for the 28 ounce tomato sauce. I used 1 1/2 cups of water with a tsp of beef Better than Bullion. I also used dried oregano and basil. I used one eight ounce container of shelf stable whipping cream instead of 1 1/2 cups. All of those changes still resulted in a delicious soup.
I used my immersion blender and will make again and try to get it a bit smoother next time.

Hands down THE BEST tomato basil soup I've ever had! and I did not even have fresh basil or oregano on hand. I didn't have the celery either. I used home canned tomatoes and added a little bit of tomato paste to help make it a little more rich. I only did one cup of cream as others suggested. It is so good! I will be making it over and over  LOL no need to ever buy it again

This is a 5 star as written.  I've made many times and have changed a few things. I use regular carrots (chopped). Roasted tomatoes and just a little tomato sauce. Vegetable broth (to make it vegetarian)  I don't puree it (I like it chunky) and there is no need for the cream.

The hubs loved it. I didn't use all of the heavy whipping cream the recipe called for but I think it's needed to cut the acidity. It wasn't sweet at all so if you want a sweet soup you may want to add some sugar. It was very good!

I used an immersion blender, and I love the consistency! I used a large bunch of basil, and it is so fresh and great. I also don't use the whipping cream, and it is great.

My new go to.

Was looking for a quick soup for a grilled cheese bar for my girls.  Made as described, although I used more basil as I had quite a bit to use up.  It was excellent.  Girls asked for seconds, and it made great leftovers the next day.  This is a keeper and I’ll make again.

I used olive oil instead of butter and less probably 3 table spoons, i used about half a cup of heavy cream, and used diced tomatoes with basil and oregano in place of the regular tomato sauce was very good

Absolutely perfect! I made it exactly as written with the exception of using dried spices (half the amount shown for fresh spices). I served it with garlic toast and everyone loves it.

This is a delicious soup!  I increased the basil (as suggested by others... pretty much doubled the basil).  Also, as suggested by another reviewer, I cooked the veggies, added the broth, then pureed.  Then put the puree back into the pot, and added the tomato sauce... much easier and less messy than pureeing with the tomato sauce in.  Turned out fantastic!
The heavy cream makes the soup satisfying with just a small amount... delicious!

Totally scrumptious!   The best we have found yet!   We added a bit more fresh basil, as we require a great strong basil flavor.

Awesome, I will not buy store bought again! I used 2 regular carrots instead of baby, and I used whole milk instead of cream. You use what you have, and it worked. I will make this again and again and again...!

I made this for my Christmas dinner appetizer and enjoyed it very much! I thought about omitting the carrots due to other's reviews but decided  at the last minute to include them anyway and I'm glad I did. I followed the ingredients as written except for adding more basil which I increased to 1/2 C (I love basil!) and reducing the whipping cream to about 1/2 C. 

No judgement now...I don't own a standing blender, but I do have an immersion blender . To make that work for me with this recipe, I sauteed the softened veggies and added 1/2 cup of the broth and pureed those. Then I added the sauce, the rest of the broth and the whipping cream before serving. The result was a wonderfully flavored and slightly textured soup. It was delicious and one I'll make again exactly the same way.

The soup was an orangy reddish color and carrot flavor was too dominant. I doubled the recipe and used 20 baby carrot pieces rather than the 30.  Still too many carrots! I added one 6oz can of paste and then a second one to make tomato the primary flavor of the soup.  I do think the basis of this recipe is good and intend to try it again, but with only 2-3 baby carrots per batch and think light cream rather than the heavy cream would be good.

Amazing recipe! I feel that it is important to comment that this soup is not safe to home can unless you omit the cream, though. Without the cream, I would pressure can since there are many non acid vegetables in the recipe. The cream can be added when the soup is opened and heated.

I made this in the crock pot!  threw in all the veggies, seasonings, basil, etc,  and the broth.  When the veggies were soft enough, let it all cool a bit then blended it.  Put it all back in the  crock pot and added 28 oz canned tomato puree and one can of tomato paste diluted with one can of water (we never have canned "tomato sauce" in the house so this was to replace that part of the recipe).  After it all came to a boil, I added lactose free milk since my family cannot have  heavy cream.  It was  delicious any way and lactose free.  Will definitely make this again.

Followed the recipe, except added more basil and a little thyme.  Best tomato soup I've had.  Combined it with a grilled cheese, tomato and bacon sandwich for an easy weeknight meal.

I thought with the basil and oregano this was too much like marinara sauce. Next time i will either omit these herbs or lessen the amount. How I made it: I blended the chopped veggies in my nutribullet &  then pressed out the water. I added the chopped veggies to a hot sauce pot. I stirred until remaining water was evaporated from the veggies. I added the sauces & broth w/dried gerbs since I didn't have fresh. I simmered for about twenty mins. Since I didn't have heavy cream, I used evaporated milk to tone down the tomato and thicken.

It made a good tomato basil soup.  I used Imagine Creamy tomato soup and didn't add the heavy cream. This was a delicious way to use the soup.  We will probably use this recipe again.

Absolutely delicious! I used more basil than the recipe and I used about half lemon basil which gave it a faint lemon undertone. I served it with toasted cheese made with rye bread. My husband raved! Has anytime tried substituting half and half for the cream to reduce calories?

Very tasty. Used a jar of strained tomatoes plus a can of tomato paste for the base, a teaspoon of chopped ginger instead of the garlic, a can of coconut milk instead of the heavy cream, some dried  basil for half of the fresh, dried oregano, 3 regular carrots. Really enjoyed it.

I've made this twice so far, each time substituting 2% milk for the cream, as we don't keep cream in the house. Complete winner here, and my husband has asked for this to be kept in rotation. Great recipe!

I started out following the recipe but got sidetracked by finding odds and ends in the kitchen that just screamed to be added. So, I didn't puree but left chunky and added chunks of tomatillo and slivers of bacon. Also just a little fresh minced turmeric. I used way more basil and way, way more garlic and onion but less cream. I added a bit more salt as well because I used tomatoes from last summer's garden I had frozen instead of canned. It turned out phenomenal and I served it with garlic-grilled smoked gouda on sourdough. Heavenly!

My husband used to scoff at the thought of tomato soup.  He had never tried any (go figure), but just thought is was pretty gross by the look of it.  

Then one day, I made this recipe, about 2-3 years ago.  He tried it, loved it, and even hoarded the leftovers to himself.  Now he asks for me to make it for him because its one of his favorites.

This is a wonderful recipe, exactly as shown.

I have made this so many times, I've lost count! I make a double batch for the meal our school PTO provides during conference time and get many recipe requests. I always use basil and oregano fresh from the garden and don't change a single thing about the recipe.

Excellent soup. Tweaked it a bit by caramelizing one whole Vidalia onion first, which added some extra sweetness and using diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. Added some Adobo sauce and increased the garlic to 5 cloves. Also diced some roasted red pepper (2) and threw them in while the soup simmered. I used an immersion blender instead of transferring the soup. Reduced the cream by half. These changes really added a zing and a richness to the dish, although this recipe is very good as it's written.
Served it with shaved Parmesan and garlic bread.

Delicious and sooo easy!!  Would definitely make again.  I rarely find a five star recipe that I consider five stars but this has both taste and convenience.  I made it the night before while my dinner for that night was warming up in the oven.  Next night just had to reheat,  add the cream and make some grilled cheese sandwiches.  How easy is that.

I had a tray full of roasted Roma tomatoes sitting here, frozen tomato sauce from previous garden, chicken broth in the crock pot from leftover bones, an abundance of basil in the garden and a bunch of veggies to use so the ingredient search brought up this recipe.  Ran it through the blender so it already looks creamy and the taste is amazing.   I am not going to add much cream.

I have made this soup a few times, always love it. I add extra garlic and basil because, YUMMY! We use vegetable broth and just wing it on the milk depending on the constancy.   I normally  simmer longer, and use an emulsifier vs a blender.  Diced tomatoes at the end for texture! Thank you, Sara

What can I say that hasn't been said?  Delicious.  I made half the recipe in case hubby didn't care for it, but I could have made double.  We both loved it.  I added much more fresh basil than called for, extra garlic, and a bit less cream.  I may try coconut milk next time, as suggested by another reviewer.

This soup has replaced my other tomato soup recipe.  You don't really even need to add cream at the end.  Maybe a half cup or so to give it some color and richness, but it's already pretty full bodied.

Awesome soup!!  This will now be on our list of favorites.  We used an immersion blender which was really easy.  I used 2% milk instead of cream and added a scoop of cream cheese.  Also didn't have that 2nd can of tomato sauce so used a can of diced tomatoes.

Very good  soup, i made it for a soup exchange at work and everyone loved it, asked me to make it again for this year's exchange, the only thing i changed was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken since i am vegetarian.

Really good! I made this for lunch on a cold Sunday and it was perfect with grilled cheese sandwiches. I did make a few adjustments, though -- I doubled the garlic and added a little more basil and oregano as well as a 2 tsp of sugar.

I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and one small can of tomato sauce.  One of the cans of diced tomatoes was spicy so it gave the soup a nice kick!

I made this with a few alterations.  Instead of celery and carrots I used frozen corn and okra.  I also used 2 Tablespoons of vegan cream cheese instead of whipped cream, about 1 Tablespoon of red cooking wine, and 1 cup of veggie crumbles.  It was great.

This was really good for dipping grilled cheese sandwiches; it was perfect!  !  I was in a hurry, so I omitted the celery & carrots.  I chopped the onions very thin so I didn't need to puree it.  I did add a little onion and garlic powder because it was a little twangy, which could of been from my brand of tomato sauce.   I would make this again!

The two year old vegetable-avoider ate it!  Enough said ??. Really this very good. I only had about 4 oz tomato sauce so I also added two fresh tomatoes and a can of stewed tomatoes- color wasn't there but the tomato flavor was. I also made this in the slow cooker after sautéing the veggies (and made crustinis (sp?) in the pan with the leftover buttery oils). So so good!

If there was a higher rating, I would give it a "10". But as usual, I have to use what I had, and that was a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, 28 oz. can of tomatoes (put in a blender) and instead of heavy cream, I had a box of the Swanson Cream Starter. Put in about 1 1/2 of that and instead of using a blender, I used a hand blender and pureed it in the same pot. Came out BEAUTIFULLY!!! A little rustic, but with my homemade garlic croutons, made from leftover hamburger buns,  all I can say is WOW!

I didn't have any celery so I used a whole Zucchini instead. Put everything but the cream in the crock pot on low for 8 hours. Added the cream and cooked on low 30 minutes. Whole family ate it up.

I have made this and it's so simple. The trick with not having the soup all over you and kitchen when you start pureeing it is start with a ladle-full of the soup in the blender. One you have the blender going, remove the little circle in the middle of the blender's cover, then add a ladle-full of the soup at a time through the hole on top until you have all the soup in the blender.

Awesome! I added a pinch of nutmeg and rosemary. Added a cup of basil. I food processed the veggies cooked them as suggested then put in blender with some of the chicken broth. Then finished as written. I took the soup to my daughters for dinner. My Son in-law cleared the table and was packing up the leftover soup for his lunch before I left.

This is one of my all-time favorite family recipes!  With cheese toast or grilled cheese sandwiches, it makes a very economical family dinner (and 1/2 and 1/2 works just fine as a substitute for the cream).  I planned it the first time when my husband was supposed to be out of town, because he doesn't like tomatoes, tomato soup, ketchup, etc.  Things changed, and he wound up being home to eat it, and he grumbled but decided to set a good example for the kids. ;-) We were all amazed - he loved it!  He had three bowls and invited his mother to try some when she stopped by.  Thanks, Sara!
Update: We're having this again tonight.  The picky 7yo said "Is it the tomato soup I like?"  Then the picky 4yo said "I love this soup!"  The not-so-picky 2yo was already digging into hers!

This is a very good, flavorful tomato soup!  The only change I made was to use an immersion blender in lieu of transferring the soup to a blender to puree.  Next time, I think I will try reducing the amount of cream, as I honestly feel this soup has great flavor and consistency without it!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Sara!

This soup is delicious. I slightly changed the recipe and skipped the small can of tomato sauce and celery as I did not have them. I also reduced the butter to two tablespoons and used regular whipping cream which made the soup healthier. It's everybody's the favorite soup.

Awesome recipe!  Very tasty!  Very adaptable to ingredients on hand.  I used Lactose Free Milk and it was still great.  Only had shallots not onions.  Added Sun-Dried Tomatoes for fun.  Highly recommend!

Sara, you hit it out of the ballpark!  This is full of flavor. I made it exactly as printed but added bleu cheese crumbles as garnishment. Oh so yummy! My taste buds are happy! Thank you! :0)

LOVED this! (tried to give it 5 stars but wouldn't let me??)  I did lower the calories A LOT by using unsweetened almond milk instead of the cream.  I also tripled the basil, double the oregano and added a couple extra cloves of garlic. (my personal taste) I will be making this again for sure!!!

Although when I made this it looked nothing like the pic, My family LOVED IT! So creamy and thick, the kids couldn't finish their sandwiches because they got full really fast on the soup. It tasted even better than the tomato soup they have at Bistros! Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

Ooooh my gosh this soup is completely off the hook!!! I'm a major garlic and basil hound so 6 cloves of garlic and 1whole bunch of basil. If it wasn't so expensive in calories I would eat this everyday. It's hard not to have  a second bowl, but I have to stop myself ; }
Fantastic recipe!!!

Very rich and creamy! Lots of butter and heavy cream!
I found it a bit thick so added at least two-three more cups of my own tomato soup/sauce.
Also...didn't have enough 35% cream so topped up to one cup only with 10% cream.
Plan to serve it with bacon-cheddar pinwheels.

If it was any better it would be a sin. Will add or omit items the next time , But first tried it your way.
Thanks

Used 2/3 of an onion, no celery.  Used half butter, half olive oil.  28 oz tomatoes, 2 tbs tomato paste, leave out cream if desired or swirl in at the end to cool it off.  Delicious either way.

Tomato soup just went from lowly to divine.  Loved this.  Tripled the basil, I think.

I have one word AWESOME. One thing I did different I used the off brand of tomato sauce BC the name brand tasted a little to much like spaghetti soup.

Great combination of flavors. But fortunately I read it wrong and used chopped tomatoes instead of sauce, and it was delightful.

All my kids loved it!!! I added 1 teaspoon salt. I'll sauté the vegis longer next time and try and blend it longer.   It was a little chunky. We've been trying to find one we like as much as Zupas and this is it!!!

Delicious.  My family loved this just the way it was.  I did cook some tortellini to go in the leftovers, though, to change it up a bit for round 2.
