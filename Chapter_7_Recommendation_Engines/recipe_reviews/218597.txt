Stunningly good! The crispy edges on the chard really make this dish. I added a chopped up red bell pepper to the bottom layer and the flavors blended together nicely. I also used fat-free feta. I had to keep myself from eating the entire pan!

Edited to add: I tried this again tonight, using kale instead of chard and goat cheese crumbles instead of feta. Gonna have to give it 5 stars as well. Served it on top of a lemony pasta. So good.

Yummy!   Really mellows the swiss chard. We're eating it right from the pan.  When adding your salt "to taste," don't forget that the feta is salty, too. Next time I might sprinkle some walnuts on top.

I've never had Swiss Chard before, so decided to try this.  What a nice surprise!  I substituted parmesan for feta because of my boys preference, added a splash of balsamic vinegar, and cut the olive oil in half.  My 16 yr old son really like the leaves, but not the stems, and my 10 yr old son said "yeah, its okay".  I loved it!  Just waiting for my husband to try when he gets home from work.

Fantastic dish! My husband was dubious and announced he wouldn't be having the chard dish. He then ate half the pan! 
I used the leftover to make a quiche the next day and it was wonderful. (quiche with 2 eggs and 2/3 of a small 35% cream container)

Wow, so delicious!  My garden has been producing lots of swiss chard, and it has been ornamental thus far, since my husband doesn't like the flavor... or so we thought!  The top layer of chard got crispy, almost like a kale chip, and the bottom cooked perfectly.  Can't believe how roasting the chard changes it flavor (from my usual cook in bacon and onions on the stove flavor.) I love this recipe, also devine when you throw in a couple cloves of crushed garlic.  I can't wait to try some red bell pepper or walnuts in this as other reviewers suggested.  Also, I made the mistake of oversalting the first time- feta alone is enough salt for us!  Drooling still, thanks for sharing!

Oh my goodness, I actually DREAMED about this last night after I ate it (and woke up wishing I had some leftover!)  This was so, so good and easy.  I had less chard than the recipe called for, so I adjusted the ingredients accordingly.  I used some green onions from my mom's garden, plus I added some green garlic that I also got in my CSA box with the chard.  I didn't really pay attention to how long I cooked the stems, but I popped in the leaves after cooking them for a while and they were perfect after 15 minutes (but I had way less chard than called for.)  Roasting the feta really brings out the flavor and complements the taste of the chard to perfection.  I'm already hoping for more chard in my CSA box, but will go buy it at the store if I don't get any.  Already craving it again!

I really enjoyed the crispy chard leaves, but disliked the rest of the recipe.  Chard stems taste like beets to me (which I never had a taste for) and 4 oz of feta was way too much.  A little goes a long way.

We got 2 giant leaves from a kids event at a local farm today. Not having the heart to toss them and wondering what they would taste like I deced to try this dish. 2 large leaves was enough of a side for a family of 4. My 7 and 9 yr old LOVED it. I was so excited they liked another green veggies. WIll be making this again for sure. Followed exactly.

YUMMMMMMMMMM! I got a bunch of chard from my CSA, and never having it before, I was at a loss as to what to do with it. Throwing it in a soup seemed lazy, cooking it with vinegar and bacon like many recipes call for just isn't my style, and I really wanted to let the chard shine for itself for my first encounter. This recipe was perfect! I used 2 small sweet onions, and a bit of freshly grated parmesan to supplement the feta, as I didn't quite have enough to make the recipe as written. I WISH I would have used less oil. This was way too greasy for me, but I will simply reduce the oil next time and I know it will still be delicious. My husband and I just gobbled this all up and I know I will enthusiastically purchase chard in the future to make this recipe as a side dish for future entrees. Joining a CSA has been the best decision I have ever made. I'm a chard fan!

This was surprisingly good.  Like some others, I substituted parmesan for the feta just because that's what I had on hand.  The stems were a bit "earthy" (even after a thorough washing), but the leaves were magnificent :)  Beats the kale chip recipe hands-down.

Absolutely the BEST Swiss Chard recipe ever!!  Only change was that I used 1 tbsp olive oil with the leaves instead of 2 tbsp.  It's plenty and if you toss the leaves with your hands, it spreads nicely over all the leaves. Sometimes I even eat the whole thing as a main course, on my own, when no one else is around. Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!!

Yum!  Used 2 bunches of rainbow swiss chard.  Did not have feta - used parmesan instead.  Will make chard this way again.  Delish!

Wasn't sure if I was going to like this and wound up LOVING it. Actually liked this better than baked kale chips. My husband and I fought over the crispier pieces. Included a picture but it really doesn't do it justice.

this was surprisingly, amazingly wonderful! probably used too much olive oil, but the feta was half fat, so that makes up for it, right?? A++ will make again.

This recipe is amazing.  This is only the second time I have made chard and it is now my favorite vegetable thanks to this tasty treat!  The flavor from roasting was great and the tang of feta was the perfect match.  I did omit the onions because we don't like them and threw in some garlic with the leafy parts instead.  Also I was trying to cut back on calories so I used only about half the olive oil called for.  I had a few leaves sticking to the pan in the end, but it was not too bad.

Before making this the first time, I read all the reviews and followed some of the suggestions.  I added walnuts and a little garlic.  I think the walnuts especially added just the right touch.  This seems like such a weird combination of ingredients, but it is amazingly good!  It's a great way to eat giant bunches of chard in one fell swoop.

This was great! It was my first time making chard. I followed the recipe exactly. I loved the crunchy edges. My husband ate 2 helpings and was picking it off the baking sheet to eat as he was putting it away. We'll make this again. I'm thinking it would be really good with goat cheese also.

Really great way to cook chard! Slightly nutty tasting, and the onions and feta really give it a great flavor.  I have cooked this recipe twice now, once plain on it's own as a side dish with stuffed pork chops and sweet potatoes, and again this morning, layered on buttered toast with a couple of over easy fried eggs on top. Delicious!  Even the hubs, who is skeptical about cooked greens, loves it! Added some sliced mushrooms to the mix -- GRRRREAT!

I made it with Lacinato Kale instead of chard and it was delicious.

Delicious!  First time trying chard and love the flavor.  I like the combination of softer stem with the crunchy leaves with the feta bonus.  Trying to accommodate my vegetarian daughter and love it when we both like something:)

Seriously the best new recipe I've made all year.  I made it exactly as written and it was outstanding.  I could have eaten the whole pan myself but I had to share it with my husband!

This was amazingly good! I have a ton of chard in my garden, and have been seeking out recipes. I used the rainbow chard that I have, so it was not only delicious but beautiful as well! Have never roasted chard before, and was surprised how good it turned out. Even my husband, who hates chard served as a side dish, loved this. I will make this again for sure, and am inspired to experiment with other roasted chard dishes. Thanks for sharing!

By the time most of the feta was melted and beginning to become golden as the recipe says the leaves were burnt.

I got a bunch of Rainbow Chard in a delivery of vegetables and had no idea what to do with them. I found this recipe after a little search on Google and made it for a potluck. It turned out great! The recipe tasted delicious, though the instructions were a little bit unclear. 

Also, for the amount of Chard I used (3 large pieces) I only got enough for 3 people to have a small amount, so I would use 4 for side dish serving size and up to 6 or 8 if you wanted to make a fully meal out of this for 4+ people.

This is really a great recipe!  I have used gorgonzola and bleu cheese also as the topping and like them better than the feta.  I have made this recipe many times using the abundance of chard from the garden.  I've served it to friends and family who ooh and ahh over it and I often prepare it just for me for lunch when home alone.  Always yummy!

We love this method.  Try it with any combination of chards, kales, arugula, etc.  Also try different cheeses - goat cheese, even hard grated cheeses.   Go to way to use our winter garden greens.

Absolutely wonderful! This is the first time I have ever made swiss chard, and it was a total hit with both my fiancé and I. You don't need to grease the baking sheet, as the olive oil used to coat the chard is more than enough to keep it from sticking. I didn't have any feta cheese on hand, so I grated some cheddar cheese over it instead, and it was totally amazing. Next time I'll have to try the feta!

I just made this and it was excellent.  I added a little balsalmic, garlic and pine nuts to the original recipe.  Everyone loved it and it was a great way to use up all of the swiss chard in my garden.

Excellent side dish.  We especially loved the crispy chard leaves and tang of the feta.

I'm never a fan of 'salt and pepper to taste' as you can really screw up a recipe by adding too little or too much.  I added a healthy pinch for each step, and the it turned out perfectly for us.

Great recipe.  It's hard to get my family to eat "green stuff".  But this recipe was a hit.  I added carrots to the onions and stems.  I don't think it added any thing.  I will definitely be making this recipe again, sans carrots.

We really liked this! My first time cooking chard and it was easy.  Only thing I would change is cutting WAY back on onion.  I probably had too much onion to size of the bunch of chard I used and it was rather overpowering.  I most definitely will make this again.

Making for second time tonight and going to use goat cheese instead of feta (no feta in house) and also going to add walnuts.

Definitely a yummy way to prepare Chard. I have never really enjoyed any type of chard but I liked this ok. I did make some changes. I added about 1-1 1/2 teaspoons of chopped garlic to the olive oil before coating. To go with this I pan fried some chicken with lemon juice, dried basil and a bit of mint. The dishes really complimented each other. My husband and I didn't finish all of it so the next night I made a simple white sauce and added the leftover chicken and chard to go over some noodles. It was delicious!

This was delicious. I did use les oil than specified and substituted a blend of cheeses, Parmesan, Asiago, and Romano, for the Feta.  Also used a red onion instead of yellow. I would adjust onion according to amount of Swiss chard. I used the first batch of Swiss chard from my garden!

We like spicier flavors so I added 3 whole peeled garlic cloves and 2 Serrano peppers quartered lengthwise to the stem mixture. I also cut the roasting time by 1 to 2 minutes on each step to avoid burning.. To make a one dish meal, when the chard was done, I put it in a covered bowl and bumped the oven up to 400 and roasted 1 lb of jumbo shrimp tossed in more olive oil. When done I mixed the shrimp and Swiss chard and had a delicious one pot meal that I will definitely make again. The 4 ounces of feta was the perfect amount, but I did break it up into smaller chunks. I also tossed things at the 1/2 way point of each step (except roasting the shrimp).

This is the best swiss chard recipe I have ever had--so delicious, healthy and EASY!  The leaves have an almost kale chip like texture, while the stems have a delightful sweet chewiness.  I used a sweet, farmer's market onion and it was awesome!  My dinner guest also said that he had never liked chard before this recipe.

This was really good but my husband didn't like the bitterness (he doesn't like Brussel sprouts or kale either). I devoured 2 big servings of it, skipping the pork chop I grilled in favor of the chard. I used grated Parmesan because I don't care for feta and it was excellent. Next time I'd use half the oil and less salt (a splash of basaltic vinegar would be nice too).

Wow, this is beyond amazing! So simple, but so good. I left out the onions so it would be more palatable to my kids (didn't work) and the flavor was fine. Do be very careful adding salt though--mine got a bit too salty with the feta.

Fantastic!  Follow the directions exactly, as it really does take 15-20 minutes for the feta to melt.

Absolutely awesome.  I didn't season the onions and stems, and I added a lot of minced garlic to them. I seasoned the chard leaves with a little garlic salt and pepper only.  I only used half the feta cheese but could have used more. I love the little crisp to the leave.

Awesome exactly as written!  I was dubious after getting chard in our CSA, but loved this recipe.  The textures and flavors went perfectly together.  We enjoyed this with grilled pork chops, applesauce and a nice pinot noir - wonderful meal!

Wow. I've never had Swiss chard before so I wasn't sure how I would like this.  I used 4 leaves and a large Visalia onion and cut down the olive oil to one tbsp. I tossed it with pasta and it was amazing. Just enough for two and no leftovers.

Ever since I discovered this recipe, I crave it year round.  I've mixed kale with it and used Parmesan when I didn't have Feta.  This is an all-around good recipe.

We love this dish!  Best right out of the oven and on to the table.  I recommend using Rainbow chard, the stems have a brightness that goes great with the lemony ricotta!!

WOW ... This is the first year I grew my own Swiss Chard and was looking for something different from what we had when I was a kid. I followed the recipe to a tee the first time and the second time added garlic. Just wonderful and I used the left over Chard in a ad-hock oriental soup ... AWSUM

Wow, this is the first time I had Swiss chard, and it is one of my new favorites! I did not follow the recipe exactly and I just eyeballed the proportions. I used half an onion, which was just right, but next time I will use less salt and oil--as the greens wilted down, there was too much salt and oil for my taste. I added pine nuts and garlic, which were great, and substituted the cheeses I had on hand: mozzarella and brie. I will skip the cheese next time unless I have feta.

This was a really neat way to eat chard.  The crispy texture was pleasing and the salty cheese complimented it well.  I used a fistful of chard and it covered my medium baking sheet (I used one with sides).  Made probably 4 servings.  I was cooking just for myself and ate half of it.  The leftovers did not microwave well.

This was truly outstanding! It never occurred to me to roast a leafy green vegetable like chard. What a delicious surprise! I followed the recipe except for using a sweet (not yellow) onion. Given the 30-35 minute cooking time, I don't think it really made a difference. The feta worked very well, although I think the chard would be almost as good without it. Will be making this again and often.

AWESOME! I've never tried swiss chard and neither had my family. I made this exactly as instructed (except I added a touch of minced garlic, and a few slices of cooked bacon, it had to be used!) and it was amazing. Not one single piece of anything was left in the dish. Try it, you won't be disappointed! :)

Wow. This may be my new favorite vegetable.  Read the comments and used some chopped shallots and garlic.  Tossed a bit of balsamic on at the end.  The family loved it.  My husband was REALLY skeptical until he took a bite.  My 11yo asked for second helpings and I had to tell her there was none left.  Will keep this is my repertoire!

This is my go-to Swiss Chard recipe. I absolutely love it! I serve it on top of quinoa, and it's the perfect side dish. I use lemon olive oil every now and then, and it's a nice variation as well.

This is now one of my go-to chard recipes. Love it! The only change I've made is decreasing the feta to about 2 oz. That seems to be plenty every time.

We had this as a side, wonderful recipe. We used a good Parmesan instead of Feta but otherwise cooked as directed. My husband cut up his BBQ chicken and mixed it up with a heap of chard. Be sure to use quality cheese and quality olive oil. Yum!

Thank you for the great recipe, we loved it.  The slightly caramelized onions gave it a touch of sweet with the salty feta.  Next time I'll try the addition of garlic and nuts just for fun.  I will also try it as a way to use up our two rows of kale - what was I thinking, two plants would have been enough!

Delicious!  My family doesn't like feta so I did what others recommended and used a herb goats cheese as well as 1 clove minced garlic.  So lovely tasting!!

We have been looking for some flavourful lo-carb vegetables to add variety to our diet - we really enjoyed this one - wish I had read the other reviews before we made it because I think the addition of garlic would have added to an already great side dish.    We served with pork chops (barbequed) and mashed cauliflower.

I have made this many times. It is one of my favorites. I have added pine nuts to this on occasion and it adds a nice nutty flavor.

I received Swiss Chard through our CSA today and, having never cooked it before, turned to allrecipes.  This was delicious and easy, other than the basic washing and chopping.  I used goat cheese instead of feta and rather than salt and pepper, sprinkled the cooked dish with balsamic vinegar. I will definitely cook this again and love that it is full of nutrients.

My only change was to add garlic to onion and stems! It was a hit with all 3 boys in my house. Cook time was pretty accurate - I just upped it to 375 to speed things up a little on my pampered chef pan.

I don't normally go to the trouble of reviewing anything (this is actually my first on allrecipes), but I really loved this.  I grabbed the lemon, garlic & oregano feta, since it was on sale this week at my favorite store and otherwise followed the rest of the recipe verbatim.  YUM!

My new favorite vegetable!  Comments on the crunchiness made me want to try this recipe, because it seemed so strange.  It's great!

The recipe is wonderful just as it is.  I like to add a couple of cloves of chopped garlic (makes the house smell even more wonderful) and a pinch of caraway seeds.  I also add match-stick carrots if I have them.  They add a little sweetness and lovely color.

This is a fun dish to bring to a get-together, because most people won't know what it is.  Even my veggie-fanatic friends said, "really?"

Great way to use Swiss Chard from the CSA box!  I took the advice of other reviewers and did not add any salt - the feta cheese was salty enough.

My husband and I are on a mission to eat more and a wider variety of veggies.  Neither of us has ever had Swiss chard, but I know a lot of people like it.  This is a very good recipe and I will definitely make it again.  The only reason for the four stars is that it was not an instant, "Oh, I want more!" but that may just be because the flavor is new to us.  We both liked it and are very happy that this was our first exposure to this vegetable.

Delicious!  Squeezed a little bit of lemon juice on it which complimented it nicely. Would hold off on adding salt next time, though. I think the feta gives it enough salt.

Delicious!  Have been trying to incorporate more leafy greens into my diet- this was a great one!  The chard came out perfectly- and the feta was a great garnish to bring it together.  Even my boyfriend, who despises all things vegetable, liked this! :) Will save in my recipe box

Just made this tonight - delicious! I get swiss chard in my CSA box and have tried several recipes but this is definitely my new fav. I made almost as written but added a sprinkly of garlic to the olive oil with the onion and stems. Also, only had about 2oz of feta, which was about perfect for us.

An interesting change, especially when trying to use up a bumper crop of chard.  Family reviews were mixed - some liked it, others turned up their nose.  Not something I'd make again.

Wow!!  This dish is so simple and so delicious.  I had no idea crispy bits of chard could be so addictive.  I left out the onion, so this was basically just lightly salted chard with some feta.  It would be fabulous even without the feta.  Really deightful way to prepare this!

OMG! This is incredible!  I found a huge (18"x14") chard leaf and discarded the main vein.  I used the finger veins but first roasted the onions for 15 min then added those veins for another 5 min then followed recipe.  I use a spray avacado oil (higher heat point) instead of evoo so just sprayed the cookie sheet then spray the veggies, add spices and toss a bit.  I didn't use salt because of the feta and did top with walnuts.  so yummy!!!!

Surprisingly delish!  I grew up with over steamed chard and had low hopes when I received a beautiful bunch in my CSA basket.  This recipe redeemed the leaf and will forever be a favorite.  I will say---as a left over, NOT (but maybe that is just me) so you better enjoy it all the first time!

Excellent recipe. Be careful not too add too much salt, especially if your feta is a higher quality (and saltier) type.

This was a great veggie dish for company as it's so colourful! Don't be wary of the chard stems - they caramelise so nicely, and really give this dish a sweetness and great depth of flavour. I made a few adjustments, making a combination of red chard and green kale and mixed it up with some  roasted sweet potato I had on hand (added this later as the cooking time's a bit longer). I also served it up with roasted pine nuts on top. Next time, I'll add a touch of balsamic glaze on top and it really will be 5 stars!

Not impressed. I grow Swiss chard and I make it all the time. The feta did not melt it just dried out.  Was ok but will not make again.

I liked this new way to use up the chard growing in my garden.  My chard leaves got a little too crispy.  I generally followed the recipe but didn't measure anything.  Perhaps I overcooked or didn't put enough feta.

My husband loves Swiss Chard! I made this  with Rainbow Swiss Chard and he thought it was the BEST swiss chard he's ever had.  The feta balanced out the chard and roasting the onions and stems first really softened the flavors.  This is definitely going in the rotation.  Super easy to make with minimal ingredients.

I never tried Swiss Chard.  This was easy and delicious.  I added it to roasted squash and put over pasta.  Drizzled a little fig vanilla vinegar (just a touch).

Better than I expect. I followed the recipe exactly except I used shredded parmesan, and I added that 1 1/2 minutes before the end. Added a couple garlic cloves chopped into thirds which I definitely recommend.

This is probably my favourite chard recipe. Read some of the reviews and added some balsamic and walnuts like recommended. Definitely a nice addition for some added flavour. Great recipe and will definitely make it again.

We eat a lot of chard but I forget about this recipe and I'm always excited when I find it again because it's something different.  It's a pretty simply combination of flavors but it's a big hit in this house!  I have learned that not all feta tastes great so if you find this bitter, you might try it with a different brand of feta because I used one this time that was a harsher flavor than I'm used to.

yum! first time chard preparation. Will make again for sure.  My husband thought the feta made it too salty,  so do heed other reviewer's advice not to salt the onion chard mix,  or use a less salty cheese.

Wow!  This was so good!  I've had rainbow Swiss Chard growing in the garden all summer, and finally got around to using it.  I think walnuts would make a nice addition, especially for a vegetarian meal.  Hubby and I are thinking of having the leftovers for breakfast with with an over easy egg on top.

I made the recipe as stated, but used a little less oil and feta.  It turned out fantastic!  Like others have said, the crispy leaves on top are the best part.  You won't be disappointed...so easy and so delicious.

This recipe is very good, picked some fresh swiss chard from my garden and sauté it up (without the stems), some red onion and finished it with some goat cheese, and a touch of Balsamic vinegar. (I didn't have any Feta cheese) It turned out great.    Very easy.

Followed the recipe almost exactly and it is absolutely delicious. I even made it in a deeper dish in my toaster oven, so as not to heat up the house, and it turned out great. My only change is no salt on the chard leaves - the feta has plenty of salt.

Delicious! I only had half of a large onion available but the proportions still worked for us.

I didn't know I could go bananas over swiss chard, but this is seriously delicious.  Even my veggie-skeptic hubs thought so.  Thankful to finally have a way to use all that farm share chard that shows up in my kitchen every summer!

Beautiful in appearance, this salad was a real crowd-pleaser.  Very simple to make and the consistency is perfect, something hard to obtain with cooked vegetables.  The feta cheese was a beautiful taste touch and my son, who refuses anything dark green, ate this completely because the cheese made it so great!  Definitely a keeper...

Delightful taste and SO simple to make!  Just be aware of how much they cook down and increase the weight of greens according to what you need.  Popular with everyone, even those who aren't green veggie fans-

This was more time and work for not much difference in flavor, compared to just sautéed chard. I tossed some red bell pepper and balsamic vinegar with the stems, onion, and oil. Then I followed the directions. I didn't have enough feta so I also used some Parmesan. It came out with three different layers of texture: the stems, a middle layer of leaves that basically wilted to soft, and the top layer with slightly crisp leaves and chewy cheese. It was good.

This was excellent!  My family loved it and I'm looking forward to eating it again, trying it with other greens, like kale.
Like others, a much smaller  amount of feta is necessary along with no additional salt as the cheese provides it.
I did raise the temp to 400 as I needed this dish to cook quicker.  Since I have cooked greens at that high of temp, I knew it would be okay.

First go was awesome although I did halve the onion. Second time my batch of chard  was earthy and I shouldn't have included all the stems. I'll make again!

This was a fantastic dish, and so simple to make. After the roasting was completed I added chopped walnuts just before serving - though any nut could work.

Really good.  Make a lot more than you think due to the leaves decrease in size while cooking.  It reduces to 1/4 of what you start with.  MAKE LOTS.

This was absolutely delicious.  I sprinkled a bit of grated Parmesan over it when it was done, but it didn't need it.  That made it a bit too salty.  I would recommend preparing it according to the recipe given.  Delicious!

Very good and very simple!!!! We have joined a CSA and in our box last week was chard, kale, beets, onions and feta cheese. Perfect! I followed the recipe exactly except I also added the kale and the beet greens. I  added some minced fresh garlic as well. Very yummy and a great use of all those healthy greens! I will be making this again!

Ummm delicious!!  I had a very large red onion and was worried that it would be too much but it wasn't.  When it cooked I thought it seemed mushy on the bottom but it was fine gone really fast.  It was great!

Made this exactly as recipe states. Very tasty with a beautiful blend of flavors. The crispy edges of the chard, the slight crisp of the onions and stems made this recipe  delicious. Easy and quick to cook up and serve!

Loved it, and oh, so easy.  I'd use a bit less oil, as it was A LOT.  I'm not sure how that will affect the flavor, however.

I really love this! I tried the Sauteed Swiss Chard with Parmesan Cheese which is also very good...so I wanted to try roasting the Swiss Chard. Very good! The only thing I did different was that I added Chick Peas. So yummy!!!!

This was terrific!!! I've made it three times now, with my only change being the addition of a chopped sweet yellow pepper to the bottom layer. Got the chard in our bountiful basket- so glad I tried cooking it this way.  Now I go out of my way to buy chard at the supermarket!
While the pre crumbled feta is okay-try this with a high quality sheep milk feta!

I modified the feta by adding some cream cheese, minced garlic, chives, olive oil, minced sweet onion, and fresh ground black pepper and mixing it all up. I used less olive oil for the chard as well, probably about 1/2 of what the recipe called for. It turned out delicious!!

Wasn't as good as I'd hoped...maybe I should give it another shot? Such a good concept.

Never had heard of Swiss chard before looking at healthy eating. We have this often with seafood and love it!

This is the first time I've cooked chard.  I got it in a local produce box from a grocery store and wanted to use it but didn't know how.  I definitely could have eaten the entire pan myself.  I had to make some extra veggies to ensure there was enough food for the rest of the family.  Wow.  Can't wait for the kids to try it.  The combo of crispy and salty is amazing.

Nice recipe, but I felt it needed more flavor, so I added some lemon juice, garlic powder, and tarragon to the finished product and it was much better.

Good! Next time I make it, I might try another cheese...or at least less of the feta.  The onions (and I used a really big red one) were sweet and wonderful.

Awesome! Swiss chard really shrinks down once roasted.  Added 2 cloves of minced garlic, it was excellent!

This recipe was excellent! Like others I was looking for a way to use my rainbow swiss chard from my CSA box. There were so many flavors for such simple ingredients! Next time I'll use more chard so the pieces on the edge don't dry out as much. I may also try using red peppers or carrots on the bottom later as well.

This was good. I made exactly as is for the first part but noticed that 1 bunch of rainbow chard wasn't sufficient. I added another bunch of swiss chard for the second half of baking and it turned out great!

Delicious!!! I didn't  use onions and stems. Also I used gruyere cheese. Loved the flavor from roasting very different than sauté.

absolutely loved this recipe.  I had ever cooked chard but have read about its nutritious value.  I made it just as the recipe stated but I believe I put too much feta cheese on top, therefore, I didn't need much salt in the dish because of the saltiness of the feta.  I tasted the raw chard and was a little concerned about its bitterness, but cooked combined with the other ingredients makes this dish one I'd serve to guests.

This was so wonderful! After the first couple times trying it, I found that half an onion works just as well. I enjoyed this very much and have enjoyed serving it to people as well as eating it myself!

I love the swiss chard roasted!  This was a very good recipe.  I followed a couple of other suggestions and just eyeballed the oil and only salted the stems.  Next time I will half the feta, it overpowered everything.  That may have been because of the number of stems in my "bunch"  I had 5 or 6 stems.  Will definately make again and try with goat cheese, kale too.

I had an overabundance of Swiss Chard from my farm share and this was the only recipe I could find to use it up.  Good, but not something I want to eat every night.

Delicious!! I had already discarded the stems before finding this recipe but cooking the leaves for about 15 minutes was perfect! Also used feta AND parmesan. Amazing!

I personally give this 5 stars but the rest of my family was not impressed so I am giving it 4. My husband and 7 year old kindly finished their servings to please me, my 5 year old (not much of a cooked vegetable eater) tasted it but did not want to eat it. I ate 3/4 of the pan myself and loved it. In defense of the recipe, I over salted it quite a bit. I will try this again with very little salt and leave the shaker for individuals to use. I did add parmesan with the feta and then pine nuts in the last 5 minutes. My 7 year old liked it with a little lemon juice (I did not).

Overall, this is a really good basic recipe.  I will definitely be cooking it again but with a couple of tweaks.  I only had a tiny bit of feta cheese on hand so I will try it again with the correct amount.  I would also like to try it with garlic.

Wow.  Swiss chard is d-i-r-t-y! I cleaned it up and ran it through a salad spinner several times.  The drier, the better if I'm going to roast (and not steam) them.   I mixed it in a zip lock bag instead of dirtying up a bowl.  I used fat free feta.  It could have used a little more time in the oven.  But tasted great!

This was my first time eating swiss chard and this recipe is delicious.  I followed some other reviewer's advice and added garlic and substituted goat cheese for the feta.  Wonderful.  Even my husband went back for seconds!

This was good, not great.  My daughter, who usually loves swiss chard, didn't eat more than a bite due to the crunchy consistency.  I thought the flavor was good with the roasting but the feta (i love feta) didn't compliment it as well as I thought it would.   I will stick with Sauteed recipe with parmesan cheese, best so far.
