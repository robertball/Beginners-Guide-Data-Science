This is a great chowder for a cold fall/winter night!  To make it quicker I got the frozen angle cut carrots, red potatoes (frozen then quartered), precut red onions (frozen), replaced one can regular corn with one can sween creamed corn, 2 cloves garlic, and replaced the water to cover the veggies with chicken broth, 2 bay leaves, replaced 1 C of milk with 1 C 1/2 & 1/2 (I used fat free milk and fat free 1/2 and 1/2), 1 teaspoon worchester sauce, 1/8 tsp red pepper powder, 1/4 tsp white pepper.  

The red potatoes and red onions add beautiful color.  The oriinal ingredients while good, where a bit blan.  This was a huge success and everyone wanted the recipe and got seconds. 

I also put a side of crispy bacon bits to sprinkle on the top after spooned into the bowls!  PERFECTO!

Yummy Soup! My kids gobbled it up and asked for seconds. Before adding the butter/milk mixture I put half of the cooked veggies in the blender. This made the soup extra creamy. Next time I will use chicken stock instead of water for a little fuller flavour. Easy recipe - I will definitely make it again!

Wonderful creamy soup.  Making it with low fat cheese and low fat milk reduce the fat and still keep the flavor.  Would probably be good with diced cooked chicken or pork as well.

I just finished preparing this soup.  bland, bland ugh.  Added salt, pepper, italian spices, basil nothing seems to help.  Won't be making this again.  Hello again...looked up another potato chowder soup and reviewers recommended rosemary.  I ground the rosemary finely and added it to the soup.  Yummo!!  That did it..I'll be making this again and again.  DH had two bowls..he loved it.  He's a big soup eater.

I could not believe the wonderful flavor this soup had! I didn't add the corn or the celery because I didn't have any but this soup was so good! Put the carrots in the water so that they can get a head start on cooking. Carrots cook quicker than potatoes and the potatoes will be too soft in the soup. Thanks!

This soup got great reviews from everyone that was fortunate enough to get a spoonful!  I used all chicken stock to cook the potatoes, it really did make amazing flavor.  I also used much more potatoes and veggies, as I was really trying to maximize the recipe.  Instead of 2 cans of corn, I took a previous reviewers advise and used one can of creamed corn and one regular (Del Monte Summer Crisp).  I also used 1C 2% milk and 1C half and half in order to add to the creaminess of the chowder.  I think the most important step was that I removed about 1/3 of the potatoes after they were cooked, as well as a handful of other veggies, blended them with an immersion blender, and added them back into the soup.  It made a super amazing texture.  I will be making this again, and am already taking requests from my family and coworkers for another batch!

Very thick and cheesey soup. I took the advice of the others and used chicken broth (instead of water). Very easy, quick, and tastey recipe. Thank you for sharing this.

Superb!  All I did was throw in a couple chicken bouillon cubes while the veggies were cooking.  This soup had great flavor.

I thought this soup was pretty bland. I added quite a bit of garlic, pepper, and salt. My husband thought it was pretty good though.

Easy, fast and tasty. Going in my "keeper" book. I used homemade chicken broth instead of water. I also used 2 cans creamed corn, 1 can whole kernel corn and added black pepper.

My son eats bowl after bowl of this soup. Every time I have made I am out of Celery but even without it's still good. I also double the cream part to make the soup extra creamy.

This was a wonderful soup for some very cold days here in PA lately! Didn't change a thing except triple it to share with some older neighbors. Thanks for a great soup recipe!

The only change I made was a slight increase in onions but other than that, left the recipe as is. THIS SOUP IS VERY BLAND! I added some spices to my own portion but couldnt fix it much. I cant even see how chicken stock could make it better. I would definitely try a different recipe. Rated 2 stars instead of 1 because the potatoes were cooked the way I like them (very soft) and they were slightly flavorful.

I've made this twice now; both times I used chicken stock instead of water, and the second time I added chopped heat-and-eat Italian sausage.  It's very good without the sausage, but my fiance and I like it even better with the sausage!  This is definately a new comfort food, and comparably healthy when you use 1% milk and Promise margarine. :)

I added more potatoes and tons of seasoning to this soup and we still didn't like it.  I also boiled the vegetables in broth, but this is not a keeper for my family.  We each finished our one bowl, because we were hungry and that is what we had for supper, but I wouldn't make it again.  The corn made the soup sweet and I imagine without adding the stuff I added, the original would have been very bland.

Very Good- thought it needed more seasoning so I cooked vegetables in vegetable stock and then used my immersion blender to puree about a third in the Stockport.  I doubled all the vegetables, but didn't need to double butter/flour/milk thickener.  Added dried thyme and oregano before thickening and used frozen sweet corn.  Saved this recipe for future use.

Very Yummy! I'm so stuffed from it right now! For more flavor, I cooked the veggies in fat-free low-sodium chicken broth, added some onion/herb seasoning blend and ground white pepper. I didn't use the full 2.5 Cups of cheese because it seemed like too much to me, but I bet it would've been fine, since I didn't drain the broth from the veggies. Regardless, 4 out of the 6 of us LOVED it. The youngest (4 & 5 yrs) were OK with it and they are REALLY hard to please. Winner!

Great soup! I used half and half, cream corn, and pureed some as other users did. Also Lawry's seasoned pepper really made the difference. It's my boyfriend's seasoning for everything he eats! Not really spicy, but brings the flavor way up!

Delicious! This was my first time making a potato chowder and I'm so happy with how it turned out. Like others suggested, I almost double the veggies, used one can of creamed corn, and put half of the vegetable mixture in the blender to thicken up the soup. So great with french bread.

Very easy to make & tastes great! Very nice comfort meal. Can't wait to serve tonight for dinner. I used skim milk with prepacked finely shredded mild cheddar. This will help for the real creamy texture. Working on the bread bowls while this sits and I'm sure gets more savory!

I'll admit, this was pretty good. After I read the other reviews, I also cooked the potatoes, carrots and celery in chicken broth. Yummy!  I think I might have slightly scalded the flour mixture, but thats my own fault. I'll try and be more careful next time.  I also added some pepper to the soup. Mmmm.

My husband and I love this chowder!  Also, added small amount black pepper and a slight sprinkle of a flavor- enhancer, added after all chowder complete, before serving.

Used all low fat or fat-free products. Fat free milk used, and low-fat margarine, and  cut back on amount of cheese, and used only 2 cups of  a 2% fat Cheddar cheese, that is shredded. 

It is an excellent chowder. One could leave out the cheese if desired.

Excellent recipe!  I wanted to have left overs so I doubled the recipe.  Substituted chicken broth instead of water to cook the veggies.  While I was waiting for the vegetables to cook (and before I put on my milk and butter), I fried up 1/2 lb of spiral ham pieces that I had diced.  After the ham pieces were done frying up, I removed them from the skillet onto a paper towel then poured the frozen corn into the skillet with no heat (just to defrost the corn) because I didn't have any canned corn in my pantry.  It turned out just fine.  After I added the milk mixture to my vegetables and added the cheese, I then added the corn and the ham pieces to the soup and it was perfect!

A wonderful soup! I make this without celery and add a dash of "liquid smoke" (you can buy it at the grocery store in the cooking isle).  I use veggie stock to boil the vegetables while I make a roux in a separate sauce pan: heat the butter, add the flour, then slowly add in the milk until it's a nice thick and creamy sauce-- then add in the cheddar and combine with the veggie stock mix. The whole family loves it and even my little ones will finish a whole cup (2, 4, & 6yrs old). I serve it with some buttered french bread and a side salad. An easy dinner fit that heats up well for left-overs.

Good chowder but I made a few changes. I doubled the recipe but cut back the butter to 3/4 stick and only did one serving of cheese, about 2.5 cups. I also only added 15 oz of corn. The recommended amount would have been way too much. I saw several reviewers added chicken broth, so I threw two chicken bouillon cubes into the water while the veggies simmered. I also added 1/2 tsp rosemary. Turned out great this way!

I made it for a crowd (triple recipe) and got many compliments. The taste was awesome!! Changes i made included adding 1-2 garlic cloves, 1/2 tsp rosemary, and using part skim evaporated milk. I only used 1/3 salt in recipe but it was perfect with cheese and bacon . Served these on the side due to guest needs. I prefer a more hearty texture so would easily triple the vegetable amounts (potatoes, carrots, celery).

YUMMY!! I made this for company & got rave reviews! Can't wait to make it again. I tripled it, so instead of using 6 c. milk, I used 2 c. half-and-half & 4 c. milk. I have a friend who uses evaporated milk so I'll probably try that next.

This was a good base for a soup but I thought it was pretty bland.  If nothing else it atleast needs some salt and black pepper.

Excellent if made with chicken broth in place of the water! Probably fine with just water, too, though. Great combination. So yummy!

Easy and very satisfying on a cold night.   I did make changes per others reviews. Changed 1 of the cans of corn to a can of sweet creamed corn Used 1 cup 1/2 and 1/2 with 1 cup of lowfat milk. Used "No-Chicken" broth (vegetarian chicken broth) instead of water. Although I am not sure if it matters, I also sauteed the onion, celery and carrots in 1T of butter before adding the broth.

yummy delish . . . with some changes.  i'm a vegetarian so this soup was perfect and tasty.  i added vegetable bouillon cubes when cooking the veggies instead of just water.  and i added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes - it gave the soup a nice kick without being spicy.  i used half velveeta cheese and half cheddar instead of all cheddar to the white sauce - velveeta melts better, stays creamy and doesn't separate like cheddar.  finally i added fresh ground black pepper to taste.    my family - who are not vegetarians loved it.  then i gave some of the soup to friends and they raved about it.

Delicious and very easy.  I, too, used homemade veggie stock--and used the veggie scraps to make more soup stock later.

this is definitely my favorite creamy soup i have made.  the only reason i gave 4 stars and not 5 is that without a couple additions i think it would be a little bland. i added chopped garlic to the simmering veggies as well as some crushed bay leaves. you could also use chicken broth instead of water and that would kick up the flavor too. this is a really excellent chowder and while its not completely healthy with all the cheese its a great way to get my son to eat carrots and celery (i added more than suggested) sooo good on a cold day, thanks!

This is great! I didn't exactly follow it, so I don't know if it would be too bland. Since I didn't give it a chance as is, I didn't want to take away a star.  I would suggest starting the milk mixture about 10 minutes into the simmer and adding a bay leaf to the veggie pot. I ended up standing at the stove for ten minutes stirring because I didn't want globs in the soup.  I also used chicken broth. Put the veggies in first (added a few cloves of garlic)and added chicken broth to cover. I cooked them for about 5 minutes or so--just until tender crisp. Then I added 6 medium potatoes and proceeded as written.  Oh, and I forgot the cheddar cheese but it was great even without it!  Thanks for sharing!  (I plan on adding cooked chicken to it tomorrow. Yum!

Made this for the first time tonight. What I love about it is that the ingredients don't have to be exact - for example, one potato yielded more than 2 cups chopped so I just threw it all in anyway. I also added two baked chicken breasts (unseasoned.) I'm not sure I got all the cheese because I grated it right in the pot and didn't bother measuring. After we had some, we decided it was still missing something. So I tossed in a capful of bacon bits and will probably add a little more cheese when I reheat it for lunch tomorrow. All in all, a great recipe considering it can be altered based on what you have available!

The whole family loves this!  I don't peel the potatoes and I use a lot more than 2, but then again, I never measure anything.  I thought I'd have leftovers the first time I made it, but they finished it all!  Now I at least double the recipe.

This was a little bland, so we added some habanero pepper sauce to induvidual servings and that brightened up the flavor. I still prefer a corn and potato chowder without cheese, though.

I give this recipe 3 stars because I change a lot, but it is a good basic recipe. I sauteed my potatos and onions first with oregano, pepper, garlic and fresh garlic. I cooked the chowder in my slow cooker. I added water with a chicken bullion cube. Addedd the potatos, then cooked some frozen vege mix with some maragine and salt on the stove and added to the soup. I let it cook a few hours and then cooked fresh mushrooms on the stove and then added. did the flour, margarine and milk mix the same and just added some pepper. came out really good! i'll be making it again.

Bomb recipe. Super easy to make. I add a tablespoon of sour cream and paprika. I used vegetable broth instead of water. I also grilled the corn with jalapeños and red peppers on the skillet before putting into the mixtures. Super yummy!!!

I used lots of extra vegetables.  Double rue needed more milk.  I actually left some water in the  veggies before mixing.

Very creamy soup without using cream. The only changes I made were to use chicken stock instead of water to cook the veggies and added some black pepper close to the end. I used jalapeno cheddar cheese. The step to heat the milk with butter and flour is essential to the creaminess in the final product. I've made various chowders and haven't seen that step before - great addition.  Very easy to make.

Great soup. Easy recipe. I switched out one of the canned whole corns for a creamed style corn. Kids loved it. Will make again.

Me and my family loved this chowder! To make it thick and creamy,  I used half and half for half of the milk the recipe called for. I also thought one can of corn was enough. I will definitely be making this again!

As others have said this is a bit bland but I did not boil all the vegetables just the potatoes.  I cooked the other vegetables in a large pot in olive oil with salt and pepper, you are going to need quite a bit of salt the potatoes absorb lots of it that is way many of you thought that it was bland.   The milk Roux I thought was not enough when I poured it so I added a cup of cream that I heated up on the stove top and it came out great,  I did not mix in the cheese that is for when I serve it into the bowls.

This was a great base recipe! I made several additions, which turned out delicious! I doubled the recipe ( my boys are hungry guys).  I added bacon.  I used a packet of Simply Organic Chipotle Ranch dip mix, smoked paprika, dried parsley, and some other spices. I sautéed the  onions, celery, carrots, and some garlic in the soup pot for a bit.  Added the diced  potatoes. Filled with one box of chicken broth.  Topped that off with potato water, and cooked.  I fried a pound of thick cut bacon in a saucepan in batches. Removed bacon.  I put the flower in the bacon grease and cooked for a few minutes.  I added milk, half and half, and chipotle dip mix.  Added chopped bacon to potato mixture. Cooked the flour mixture until thick and smooth.  Added that to the potato mixture, as well as 2 cups of shredded cheddar, and simmered until the crescent rolls were done. I served with chopped fresh parsley on top.  Delish!  Next time I think I'll add a couple of cans of baby clams. I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe! Oh, this was the first time I ever made potato soup. I did not use butter, as I used the bacon fat instead.

Unfortunately this soup was very blend as there are no spices nor stock added to it.  I added chicken stock (about 4 tsp) and bacon. Now it tastes good :)

I skipped the cheese so this soup came out very bland.  But after adding another tsp and half of salt and a teaspoon of stevia sweetener, it was fantastic.

This is a very tasty chowder. My family loved it. I used white pepper to give it a kick and I used celery seed instead of celery as I did not have any celery.  I will definitely make it again.  Very easy and quick to make.

I know some people don't like it when people change the recipes and then review it, but I like reading the different variations and suggestions in the reviews and making it to my taste.  So I started with this as my base recipe and made a few changes. I added my normal seasoning of salt, pepper, garlic salt, celery salt and Lowrys. I cut back the corn to just one can and I also used a little less than 2 cups cheddar cheese. I sliced up and fried about 4 precooked style brat-sausages (like johnsonville) and I added them at the end, just to heat before serving. Unfortunately the sausages I had on hand were a spice anduoille sausage style and I think it could have been better with more of a traditional sausage or beer brat. Ham would have been good too.

Was looking for a vegetarian potato soup recipe since I'm allergic to chicken and I thought I'd never find one! This one fit the bill.  When I made it I omitted the carrots and the celery because I had none and was snowed in so I couldn't go to the grocery to get any.  Only thing the recipe wasn't clear if you should drain the water off the potatoes and onion once they are boiled.  I did but after reading reviews that was an "oops" because apparently you're not supposed to.  My soup was thick so I added a little more milk.  I also added fresh garlic and some other seasonings.  Perfect!  Will repeat.

I used 1 c. of frozen corn instead of canned corn and only 1 c. of cheese, plus I added a little celery seed and fresh ground pepper. I also diced my potatoes and carrots to about 1/2", which really sped up the cooking time. Great recipe. I'll definitely make it again soon.

I made a huge pot of this, thinking I would have some for leftovers... boy was I wrong! My family couldn't get enough! I used frozen corn instead of canned though, so it would be healthier (canned veggies have NO nutritional value!) and taste better. I think I might add some ham next time, but it's good without it too. All in all, VERY GOOD! :)

This is a wonderful chowder and easy to make. I did cut up and cooked 5 bacon slices then drained the grease off and set aside to use later for garnish before I added the vegetables. Shared with a friend who loved it.

I added a cube of chicken bouillon to water while veggies were simmering. In the end it tasted very bland to me, but with adding crumbled bacon, a couple pinches of dried rosemary, a dash of creole seasoning it was Delicious! The recipe has a good base but definitely needed some key flavor components added. The good thing is that you can be creative & add what you like to make it taste good.

My boyfriend and I loved it. Very delicious and easy to make. I made two small changes by using vegetable broth instead of water to boil the veggies in and then replacing the can of corn with a Midwestern mix of corn, blackbeans and red pepper! I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe provides a great starting point.  I added 4 vegetable bullion cubes and six cups of water to make a more flavorful soup.  I also added asparagus and mushrooms toward the end of the boiling process to make this more of a spring vegetable chowder.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. Great soup for a cold snowy day in WI. I will be making this again, the only changes I made was add a little extra veggies and that was it.

This was the first chowder I ever made and it was so easy and delicious!  The only change I made was using chicken broth instead of water to cook the vegetables.  Rich, creamy, savory - perfect on cold winter nights.

I loved this soup. I took someone's advice and added two chicken bouillon cubes to the water that covers the veggies.  It was amazing.

This soup is great! I added some cubed ham pieces and garlic powder. Made this for a fall camping trip and everyone thought it was awesome.

This a great basic recipe but I added a lot of different items because it was a little bland. I added Fresh sage, thyme, oregano and garlic powder and fresh jalepeno. I don't particularly like cooked carrots so I left them out.

No flavor. I fixed it up with chicken granules, bay leaf, celery salt, worstershire. Better. More of a soup than a chowder (watery). But a good basic start.

This was very good and hardy.  It was a little bland but I think it would have been more bland if I had not made some changes.  I cooked my veggies in 30 oz of chicken broth + about 1 cup of water and a chicken boullion cube.  I added about 1/4-1/2 tsp of garlic powder and I added black pepper.  Instead of cooking the butter, milk and flour separately, I added the butter to the veggies and in a separate bowl, I whisked the milk and flour and then added that to the pot. It came out really good and I'll make it again.

This was very easy to make. I used only half of the corn suggested and threw in more carrots. A great veggie soup.

I tried this for lunch today for me and my husband. The first mouthful my husband took made him say, "This is delicious." He ate two helpings and so did I. I am sure that the way the recipe is written will make a great soup, but I did add a tiny bit of Old Bay seasoning, a little Morton's Nature Seasoning, and a packet of chicken bouillon plus some Worcestershire sauce. I really don't like to deviate from a recipe, but it seemed to need a bit more seasoning than called for. What I don't like is when someone changes a recipe, then complains about the original recipe. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful soup.

This was pretty darn good.  I used vegetable broth instead of water, and added some garlic and a little cumin to help add a little flavor. My 4 year old enjoyed it also.

Great chowder.  I substituted green onion for the celery (don't like celery) and added broccoli.  I also followed the advice of other reviewers and added a chiken broth cube.

Love this soup!  The only reason for 4 stars is that this recipe calls for too much corn - in my opinion.  My fiance thought it was the right amount.  I'll meet in the middle somewhere when I make it.  Great flavor.  I took other's advice and added chicken stock in place of some of the water.

Good recipe.  Very filling, it would make a good meal on a cold day with a nice crusty roll.
