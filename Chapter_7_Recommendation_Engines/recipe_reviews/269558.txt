This was amazing. The whole family loved it even better than regular Lasagna. It is a little juicy as the cabbage adds moisture instead of soaking it up as noodles do but so delicious. I may use a little thicker sause or add a couple eggs to try to thicken it up slightly. I will make this again for sure.

I'm confident I will enjoy this dish (still cooking at this writing). I omitted mushrooms (don't really care for) and carrots. I discovered that I didn't have any Parmesan cheese on hand, so that was also omitted. I most definitely will make this dish again. It was easy to prepare.
