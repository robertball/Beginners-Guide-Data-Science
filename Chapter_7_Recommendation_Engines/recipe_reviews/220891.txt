An old favorite.  Easy to make and always a hit at a pitch in dinner.  My personal preference is for less sauce, so I halved the mayo and pickle relish.  Or add a second can of beans.  Or some pasta.  Or diced ( cooked) potatoes.

Delicious and couldn't wait to have it! I'm sure it will taste better later after longer in the fridge. Left out the onions, but kept everything else. Exactly what I was looking for!

Just like the one served in the Wisconsin "Supper Clubs"! Wonderful taste in a classic salad. Sometimes this salad also had shredded cheddar cheese mixed in.

I made this recipe, it reminds me of an old favorite that my mother made us as a child. I made it just as the recipe states except I did add some small cheese cubes.  I am already planning to make some more this weekend.   It is a great way to get some fiber in your diet while tasting delicious.

This is similar to the New England Bean Dip (which I love) but has a milder flavor.   I cheated a little by using a pickle relish instead of chopped pickles, which added a little more liquid, but it was still really good.
