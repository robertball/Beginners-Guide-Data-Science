I was looking for a good chili bean recipe to make for the family. I came across Grandpa Ron's and I'm so happy I did!!! My family loved it. I am definitely pleased with the outcome. Thank you.

My husband liked this more than I did; I'm not real fond of sweet chili. I think 1/2 tablespoon would have been plenty of sugar. My daughter loves chili, and she only ate a few bites of this. We felt it was a bit too saucy also. My husband thought it was seasoned nicely. I made my own chili seasoning instead of using a packet. If I had to remake this, I would drain the beans (not rinse them) and cut the sugar down to no more than a tablespoon.
