This is the most wonderful pizza crust I've ever made (and I've tried quite a few)!  It's crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside!  It's a weekly favorite with my pizza loving family.

This is one of the best pizzas I have ever made.  It came out crispy and chewy.  The sauce has a nice flavor, and the instructions are very easy to follow.  For someone just learning to make pizza this is a great recipe.

Excellent. The crust was great, although I definitely recommend making two pizzas with it. It was really easy to work with and tasted great. The sauce was similarly great. I think the key is that initial baking before putting on the cheese, it keeps it from getting soggy like other homemade pizzas. However, I prefer to cook it for just 10 minutes initially and then 13 minutes after it's topped. That way it doesn't burn and the cheese gets bubbly.

Yummy!  This recipe was a big hit at our house tonight.  The dough was perfection to work with and baked very nicely.  The sauce was wonderful - my husband is very picky about pizza sauce and he loved it.  Definitely a keeper!

This is by far the best pizza base I have ever made.I did find that it was quite thick though, one large piece was quite filling.It was a lot like a delicious focaccia because of its thickness, but it was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. It is good to freeze and eat later and the sauce was better than any shop bought one. I encourage everyone to try it!

OMG!!! I have been looking for a homemade pizza sauce for a while without any luck.  Smells and tastes like something granny used to make. The yield of the sauce is enough for 2-12 inch pizzas. Thank you.

I can't say enough about this fantastic pizza. We made a standard pepperonni pizza. It was the best homemade pizza we have ever made. My husband couldn't get over that it was homemade.I baked it on my pizza stone, preheated the oven to 375 then after putting the pizza in turned it up to 475. Baked for 30 minutes. Turned out great. Thanks.

Yum!  I added a little bit of sugar to the dough and the sauce.  I also spiced the sauce up with 3 garlic cloves, extra EVO, and lemon juice.  It would have tasted great just the way the recipe state though.  My cheese started getting really brown half way through cooking.  I just covered with some tin foil and that stopped the browning.

This was my first homemade pizza and it was a hit! The sauce was fantastic and the crust had a nice flavor. The only negative on the crust would be that it was alittle crispier than our liking but I think next time I will cook it 10-15 minutes rather than the 20 minutes suggested. I followed the recipe but did top it with proscuitto, green pepper and mozzarella cheese. Garnished with fresh rosemary. YUMMMMM!

I'm only rating the dough, and it was so yummy. We made it pretty flat, so it makes for a nice thin crust.

This is really great!  I divided the dough for 2 pizza's and used my Pampered Chef baking stone.  I did one with cheese and pepperoni for the kids and Italian sausage,pepperoni, mushrooms, black olives and cheese for the adults. Eveyrone loved it and I wish I had some now!  I also used the petite diced tomatoes as I didn't think my kids would like the chunky tomatoes and I added a little sugar to the sauce.  I doubled the sauce recipe and used the remainder with some homemade fried mozzarella sticks.

The dough had a good flavor, but was REALLY dense.  Maybe it is something I did though (not allowing enough time to rise).  I think I may try it again.

I bought the dough at my local Italian deli ($1.00) to save time but the sauce was great.  I love the chunkines of the chopped tomatoes.  I think I would add just a few red pepper flakes next time to boost the spiciness.

I fixed the pizza on a cookie sheet. The crust was light and slightly thick.  The sauce is pretty good too.  I added hamburger cooked with onions, added mushrooms, black olives and alot of cheese.  It wasn't bad but I don't think I'd go to all the trouble to make a homemade crust again.

The best homemade pizza I've ever made!  I FINALLY have an excellent reason to use this baking stone I bought from Pampered Chef.  The crust & sauce are both excellent.  I made two pizzas out of this recipe, one on my 15" round PC baking stone and the other one in a 9" pie pan.  Plus I had enough extra dough to make 4 little bread sticks.  The pizza is delicious!  I topped mine w/ mozzerella cheese, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives and pepperoni.  It was also BEAUTIFUL!  Loved this & will be making it again & again!

This was incredible!  It was my first experience making my own crust.  A bit of a challenge, but fun.  The sauce was delicious.  Very robust and aromatic.  Can't wait to make this one again!  Even if you don't want to make the crust yourself, make the sauce and use it on a pre-made pizza shell.  The longer you cook it, the better!

The consistency was perfect, but we thought it was a little lacking in taste.  Maybe needed a little more salt?

this was pretty good. 
i definitely recommend splitting the dough in 2.  i made it as one thinking it would just be the regular sort of crust (and assumed that if split in 2 it would be too thin) but it was WAY too thick.
the sauce seemed a little more watery than i would have liked though.

Could use a little more flavor, the 2nd time I made this, I rubbed the cooked crust with ROASTED GARLIC which made for a deeper flavored Pizza!

The sauce on this pizza was fantastic -- best I've ever tasted! In all honesty, I didn't use the crust recipe provided. I have a pizza dough recipe I like that I can make in my breadmaker. But everything else I followed to a tee. Delicious!

I sped thing up with rapid rise yeast using warmer water and a first rest of 15 minutes.  I also used 9x13 pan which is closer in area to a 12 inch round pan.

Up the garlic in the sauce to about 6 cloves and top the sauce with mozarella and veggie pepperoni - YUM!!

I hate homemade pizza, especially their crusts but this was really very good.  Now I make it all of the time.  I like the change the toppings though.  Like a garlic chicken or artichoke with alfredo sauce instead.

Yes, I use convenient things. Made it with premade crust. Loved it. The sauce and toppings were perfect. Will try baking the crust myself also. Thanks a lot.

Very, very, very good. We made one big rectangular pizza in a 15x10 jelly roll pan and it turned out great. Good sauce, and can easily modify cheeses to top it with. Also very easy to make. 5 stars. Try it. If you like Sicilian Pizza, this won't disappoint you.

Was a wonderfull sicilain pizza.  The dough was amazing, the sauce was great, we did not have mozzerella cheese, so we used romano and parmesian and some chedder instead.  It was not the same without mozzerella, but still good.
