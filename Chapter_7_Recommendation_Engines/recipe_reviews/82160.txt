Excellent!  I divided my recipe in half initially as I was afraid of investing so much into something that I may not eat.  Even by cutting it in half, it made a lot.  I used 1.5 lbs of hamburger. Had a bag in the freezer of some left over spaghetti sauce so I put that in there, added a little more cumin and chili powder....and it was really good.  Have enough for about 4 more meals - so in the freezer it goes....awaiting a chili cold night.  I have made the other kind before where you add the ranch dressing mix and this recipe is so much better!  Enjoy!

My husband actually saw this recipe first and asked me to make it for him.  It did not disappoint!  We have a big family (five kids) and this recipe makes enough for two dinners and a lunch.  Great value and great taste all in one.  We've also served this for guests who've loved it too and always ask for the recipe.  I can't say enough about how much we really love this recipe.  It's definitely a family favorite now.

Delicious and filling. I followed the recipe, for the most part, and will use this recipe again and again. Here is how I tweaked the recipe to suit our tastes: I used beef kielbasa, 4 large cloves of garlic, 1 very large onion, 1 small can of tomato sauce to give more body, and I used chicken broth instead of water. I skipped the mixed vegetables as we had enough veggies with the potatoes, onion, corn, and pinto beans. I did not use the cumin and used just the chili powder--regular and ancho. I think next time, I will skip the potatoes. Yum!

This recipe makes a lot! It was fun to make--quick and easy, too. I browned and drained the beef, then browned and drained the sausage. I set both meats aside while I sauteed the onion (in a clean soup pot) in two tablespoons of oil. Then added the spices and cooked for a couple minutes more before putting all of the rest of the ingredients into the pot. Because I had an open can of chipotle peppers in adobe sauce in my fridge I diced up a couple of tablespoons and added that as well.

Wonderful! I didn't have regular pinto beans so I used pinto beans in chili sauce and just nixed the chili powder. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and halved everything with the exception of the beef (my husband likes a little more meaty stew) and overall I am very pleased with the result. Hearty, filling, and I still had tons and tons left over. This is the perfect stew for a cold night.  But next time I think I will be adding a little bit more heat as I like a little more spice/heat in my food.

This was really good! Halved the recipe yield and used ground venison and homemade venison sausage. I left out the frozen veggies as it was already a lot! My fiance really loved it. Had just the right amount of "kick". Will make it next time with cornbread. Thank you!!!

Nice hearty stew. Added cayenne for heat. Only thing I would change is that I would drain the corn next time. I don't really like sweetness in my savory foods and the liquid from the corn made it alittle too sweet for us. But other than that, it was great.

Our family absolutely LOVES this recipe. Even my teenagers' friends have requested it! I did decide, though, to withhold the extra cans of corn. The corn gave the stew a little element of sweetness that I could do without. I added 2 more cans of various types of beans instead. You could also add a bit of of "Tony Chachere's" seasoning for more kick as well!

This is easy to make, very hearty soup. It makes so much I freeze half. I use fresh veggies instead of frozen package. And I add more salt and more spices to for my personal taste.. Overall great comfort food. Usually make with Mexican cornbread.

Made half a batch of this stew, and still made gobs.  This was an okay stew, (soup), but just not much flavor.  Does need something else, not sure I'll make this again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe GTEACHERCOOK!!

This is so good! Used low fat ground beef (95%) and reduced fat kielbasa and worked fine! Added 4 chopped jalapenos. Did not peel the potatoes. Used kidney instead of pintos (it's what I had). Great for using up those partial bags of frozen veggies. Halved the recipe and still made a ton, lots for the freezer. Used the slow cooker and started it on high to get all that volume up to temp, then turned to low and cooked about 6 hours. I was worried the potatoes would get too mushy but that did not happen. Love it!

Pretty Good Stew! It sure does make alot, I thought I was going to have to open a soup kitchen..I had so much stew. Next time I will half the recipe. The recipe says "salt to taste", I ended up putting 3 teaspoons for this large batch of stew. Good flavor, my family enjoyed it.

This recipe was so easy to make & delicious too. For the "salt & pepper to taste" I used 1 TBSP of Goya Adobo & 1 Packet of Goya Sazon Flavor Packet With Coriander & Annatto. I changed the serving size to 5 and this still filled my crock pot to the top! For some heat, I added Cholula Hot Sauce to the adult servings. I will definitely make this again as it was so easy to throw in a crock pot and the whole family enjoyed it :)

I made a few minor changes -- halved the recipe, but used a whole onion and 12 oz bag of mixed veggies, 1-1/2 tsp each of cumin and chili powder, substituted black beans for pintos. I used Rotel Hot tomatoes for more kick. The end result was quite spicy, surprisingly. I drained the beans and corn and only used a cup of water to cook in a slow cooker for 6 hours (but browned the beef and sausage and cooked the onion in the meat until transparent). I'm not sure what the point would be of cooking the full recipe unless you're feeding a crowd -- this was a packed crockpot at half a recipe.

We really liked this recipe too, but I'll admit I made a few changes because we like it spicier.  Increased the garlic to 4 cloves, used 1 1/2 onions and doubled the cumin and chili powder, and added a 16 oz jar of green salsa.  Also I was running out of time and didn't want to chop potatoes, so I subbed a bag of hashbrowns (the cubed kind) that I thawed in the microwave, which worked beautifully.  It did make a lot, so much so that my crockpot was almost overflowing, but it was so good!  Definitely give this one a try!

I'm a real Texas girl and I can tell you my whole family loved this recipe- It made enough for an army! I hardly had a pot big enough, which is something to say! I'll half the recipe next time and it'll still be plenty, I'm sure. My family told me that the next time I make it, since I WILL be making this again, to half the amount of sausage, so I'll do that as well.  10 stars, thank you so much!

This is a meal everyone will love! First I cut the servings in half, then I used ground turkey instead of hamburger, light red kidney beans instead of black eyed peas, & canned potatoes so i wouldnt have to do all the work! It was still great. Also, i was out of chili pepper so i used a teaspoon of chili seasoning instead & it worked just fine. I think next time I'm up for the work I will use real potatoes & leave the skin on! This recipe is a must try!

I changed the serving size to 6 and it still made a ton of stew. I didn't care for the kielbasa sausage but it was a nice meal on a cold day.

I made this with Andouille sausage as that's what I had on hand. I also threw in some finely-diced jalapenos. By the time I'd added the pinto beans and canned corn, I already had way too much for the both of us (including leftovers for lunches) so I didn't bother with any additional veggies. I also added some onion powder for a little more flavor. I served it with corn bread as suggested, and it was a hearty meal for a chilly Winter night. Thanks!

This was an easy recipe that turned out really well.  It makes a HUGE batch though.  You'll be eating off of for quite awhile.  I used turkey kielbasa and didn't add the bag of veggies.

I adjusted the amounts to suit my personal taste.  Took it to work and everybody loved it.  But it makes a lot.  We've been eating on it all week and I cut the recipe in half.

It was good but not what I expected. Seemed like an awful lot of corn. Really was nothing more than a beef stew. Enjoyed the taste but probably won’t make it again.

This is really comfort food at it's best!  You get to smell the wonderful aromas while it's getting better and better.  One of my husband's favorite meals with corn bread or tortillas and a green salad.  I love that it makes a lot because it's even better the next day.  I don't use frozen mixed vegetables.  I prefer to add fresh veggies like zucchini, green beans, whatever I happen to have.  Also great using sausage with the ground beef, or instead.  Just a great recipe, and so easy to make your family's favorite. :)

Loved this and it made a ton of leftovers which was perfect. I made this in the crockpot and used stew meat instead of ground beef, turkey kielbasa and canned vegetarian beans. This was very hearty and filling. Made this the day of hurricane Sandy and hence my power going out that night....I was able to reheat on my gas stove top the next day. Everyone enjoyed this all in one meal. Thanks!

Changed the recipe as follows: for meat used 1.5 lbs ground beef & 1 pound hot breakfast sausage roll, used Bush's chili beans instead of plain pintos, 4 tablespoons chili powder, 1 tablespoon Tabasco sauce, left out potato & mixed veggies, used a can of green beans, left out the diced tomato with chile peppers, added a small can of tomato paste, added a tablespoon oregano. Turned out awesome this way!

Very, very good - I cut the recipe in half, but still used more onion, garlic, beans, and potatoes than the recipe called for. I added more chili powder, garlic powder, and onion powder as well. Tasted awesome when served with cornbread - leftovers should be yummy!

It is one of those comfort dishes that people like. Made it for our mid-week church dinner. Lots of compliments. One man had 3 helpings. Unless I mis-made the recipe, you'll need a BIG pot. Which is a good thing.

I don't usually comment if I highly modify, but this was fantastic.  I halved the recipe and used what I had on hand for vegetables and beans (black beans, kale, fresh tomatoes, red potatoes, part of a habanero pepper), and added Worcestershire sauce.  Great comfort food for a cold night.

Super flavorful! This stew was awesome and easy to put together. I omitted the beans because my father does not care for them and we did not have any potatoes in the house but was still great. Followed the recipe and ended up with three containers of leftovers! Definitely a keeper!

This should have a warning about how much it makes. My 6 1/2 quart stock pot wasn't big enough for it. I followed the recipe exactly but will vary it if I make it again. Neither my wife nor I was crazy about the kielbasa. So will try a firmer, spicier sausage and will use no more than a pound. I will also add cayenne and maybe dried ancho chillis. (wasn't spicy enough for my taste) .The potatoes didn't get close to done in the recommended cooking time. I ended up simmering it all for around 6 hours. Overall though I liked this dish very much. Which is good, because I have a ton of leftovers

Skipped the ground beef and one can of diced tomatoes because I was missing them, but those were the only substitutions. Excellent! Delicious, quick, easy, cheap, perfect for tiny taste buds (10 month old, and twin toddlers), and hungry men! Definitely passing this one along to friends.

I halved this recipe and it still made quite a bit. I used the full can of tomatoes with chili and the full amount of spices (no salt). This was very hearty and tasty. DH said 'could go into the rotation.

The recipe seems to call for both 2 cans diced tomatoes (in the left hand column followed by the Rotel advert) plus one can of diced tomatoes with chilies (in the right hand column without a Rotel advert).  On this point could be clearer.  Are three cans of Rotel recommended or is this an unintended duplication? Three with chilis?

I follow this recipe exactly and my whole family loves it! I've made this at least 6 or 6 times a year in the last 5 years. It is the best stew I've ever eaten. The smoked sausage is excellent in this. I always make sure to use the skinless smoked sausage.

I've made this recipe a dozen times or more. This is great for tailgating and is a huge hit every time.

I like to add 4 beef bouillon cubes to enhance the broth flavor (or beef stock instead of the water). Also for a more southwest flavor 2 tsp of mesquite liquid smoke and 2 tsp of Texas Pete hot sauce. I make sure to have bread along side it to mop it up the yummy broth. I prefer potato rolls but any bread is great.

Husband and two adult sons love this!  Used frozen stir fry veggies and larger size worked well.  On another occasion was having a beer and used one cup of beer for one cup of the water, that too was a hit in our house.  Enough left over for weekday work lunches.  Sons ask for cornbread with this.

I have made this a couple times now and my family really likes it. I usually make it with ground turkey to make it just a tad healthier though.

I'm happy I read the reviews and only made half... kinda. The leftovers would've been great, tho!! Everyone loved it and my daughter put dibs on the leftovers before anyone even finished their meal. High praise, let me tell you!!

I cut this recipe in half and it was plenty for 4 of us.  I also left out the mixed veggies but otherwise made it according to the recipe.  As other reviewers said, this is really good!

These ingredients have been doubled already.  This will serve 20 easily with cornbread.  All the ingredients would not fit into my crockpot.  Easy and good!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I followed it to a "T" and it was SO bland. I kept going back to it and adding more chili pepper and more garlic, salt and pepper and it still was so bland. I don't think I will be making it again.
