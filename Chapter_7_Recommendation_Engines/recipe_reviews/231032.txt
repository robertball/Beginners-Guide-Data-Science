2.17.18  I had no fusili pasta on hand, so I used fiori.  We don’t like canned mushrooms, so I substituted some sauteed sliced baby bellas, otherwise, followed the recipe.  There’s a nice contrast between the peppery arugula and the nutty gruyere, and the fresh dill adds  yet another layer of interesting flavor.  Liked it, would make again.
