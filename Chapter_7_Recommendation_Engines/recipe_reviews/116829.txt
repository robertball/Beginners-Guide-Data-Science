This was pretty tasty--it actually should be 4-1/2 stars. I think I was looking for something a little more like the restaurant versions I've had, so next time I'll coat the pork in some seasoned corn starch before frying. I also added chopped celery and a lot more carrots than it called for. I think I'll add some cornstarch to the sauce next time, too, to thicken it up a bit. We ate this with lo main noodles (not really, just some ramen noodles mixed with soy and teriyaki sauce) and it was a very filling meal. The kids seemed to like it (they ate it!) so I'm sure I'll make it again in the future.

Very good and relatively easy.  I used rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar, as that was all I had on hand, and doubled the garlic.  We did use a large wok instead of a skillet.  My husband and children all ate heartily. It is definitely a "make again" dish.

Good, simple.  I used left over cooked pork and would use 1/2 the vinegar next time.  I added 1T cornstarch and used all the marinade (since my pork was already cooked) and lots more veggies.

I used the juice from the pineapple too and it was great, i would not recommend using regular soy sauce.. it makes it a bit salty. Other then that it was very good.

This recipe is delicious!  After reading other reviews, I decided to only use half the vinegar the recipe called for and replace the other half with pineapple juice.  The resulting sauce was sweet and tangy but not over the top.  I saut√©ed the garlic in the oil before cooking the meat.  I then added the sauce and boiled it until it thickened up before adding my veggies and cooking just a bit longer.  Didn't have any peppers on hand so I used snow peas instead. Would definitely make this again!

My husband and I thought it was good, but maybe a little too much vinegar flavor.  I might make it again.  Don't forget to include the marinade time in the prep.

Very tasty sweet and sour pork recipe!  I substituted 1/3 cup of agave nectar for the brown sugar, only used 1/3 cup vinegar and 1 teaspoon soy sauce.
At the end sprinkled some corn starch on top to firm up the sauce. Also added a little pepper to the meat.My husband said it was very tasty!

This recipe is pretty good...it has good flavor.  However, I would suggest coating the pork in flour or cornstarch.  Also the sauce is pretty watery, I suggest adding some cornstarch to help thicken it.  I was worried the vineagar would be too strong (based on smell) so I included the pineapple juice..I can't imagine in without it.  I will try this again...hopefully the fry on the pork and the thicker sauce will make this 5 stars

I followed the recipe exactly. I think it ended up with too much of a vinegar taste. Maybe next time use 1/2 the vinegar, and definitely add some more garlic. Will be searching for a better recipe.

This was amazing! I used regular vinegar, because it was all I had. I halved the amount, and it tasted AMAZING!

My family really liked this. I didn't have any cider vinegar so I just used regular vinegar but not quite as much as the recipe called for. I also added the juice from the canned pineapple to it.

This recipe was great.  For those of you who said it's too vinegary, I think the sauce might not have simmered long enough.  I used Heinz chile sauce instead of ketchup and rice wine vinegar.  I cooked it for a good 25-30 on low or until it was thick and the consistency or real sweet and sour sauce.  The balance was perfect.  I recomend not changing a thing :)

I had leftover pork loin I wanted to use up and this was PERFECT for that. I skipped the first step of cooking the pork and I divided the sauce mix in half (since I skipped the first step). I added 1/4 c pineapple juice and there was plenty of sauce and plenty of flavor. I started out by sauteing the pepper and onions until they had a soft crunch. Then I added the cubed pork, ginger, garlic, and sauce. I didn't have any carrots but this was still DELICIOUS!

I'd actually rather rate this a 3, but I liked not frying the pork.  The ketchup was too much.  I know others said 1/2 the vinegar, but even cutting the vinegar didn't work.  I'd leave out the ketchup.

Made this for supper tonight and it was fabulous!  Only thing I missed was the carrots which we were out of but it was wonderful even without them.  Thanks for the great recipe!
