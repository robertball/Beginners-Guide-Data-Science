This was a miss in my house. The kids did not care for the texture of this or the taste.

I made this for my kids, and none of us could get past the texture. The flavor isn't all that bad, but I agree it might be better with caramel or butterscotch chips.

This was a no go for us. The texture is just off even though you know there is applesauce in it it still is kinda surprising and off putting. We will not make this again.

I didn't think this was so bad as everyone else does. We really like to eat a lot of food with fruit and veggies, as a "healthier" dessert, and this was a great after-dinner dessert. Would I serve it at a dinner? Nope. But my kids liked it and ate it.

This was far from a hit at our house.  The texture is very different and hard to get over.  The flavor of the apple and chocolate just wasn't to our tastes and was disappointing.  I was hoping the kids would like it but it was asked that I not make this again.

Made as per recipe.. not very good. I added a bit of xanthan gum which improved the texture and made it a little fluffy and mousselike. I just dont think the apple and chocolate worked together well... now if there were caramel chips...perhaps?

Curiosity got to me so I made this recipe. My second son said he wanted to try it and he was the only person who liked it. The texture was off and it tasted like chocolate pudding and apple sauce mixed together.

I so wanted to like this but the texture is off. It tastes like chocolate flavored applesauce.

I have to agree with the other reviewers...this just doesn't taste like pudding. I tried to make some adjustments too. I used 3T. of powdered sugar instead of regular sugar to help with the consistency. I added about 1t. of vanilla and I also folded in some whipped cream but in the end it still tasted like chocolate applesauce. I'm going to try freezing this in cubes and use them to flavor some chocolate martins, otherwise I wouldn't use it. I will say my 2 year old liked it, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.
