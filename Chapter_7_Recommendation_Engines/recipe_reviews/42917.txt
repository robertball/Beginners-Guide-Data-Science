Hubs liked this better than I did, but then he was unaware of what I perceived as its flaws. I thought it was good,  but I think it could be better.  First, don't beat the eggs with an electric mixer. A lot of air is beaten into them that way and the resulting air bubbles will be evident in your omelet. I just use a wire whisk and whisk them until thoroughly combined.  Second, I'm not sure I like the addition of the tomatoes and I would saute the mushrooms first. Both release so much of their juices that it sort of pooled in the center of the omelet, more or less forcing me to bake the eggs longer than I would have liked to just so the juices would be absorbed. And I even seeded the tomatoes first! I can't imagine how much longer I might have had to bake this if I hadn't.  And I would definitely recommend sauteeing the mushrooms before adding, along with any other vegetables you might choose to add like chopped peppers, onions, or zucchini.  Finally, I didn't cover this.  By doing so you prevent the omelet from turning a nice golden brown.  Given my criticisms I would rate this only average, three stars, but since Hubs gave this a solid four (not knowing, of course, its challenges), I'll leave it at that.

We omitted the olives and bacon, cooked uncovered 25 minutes (instead of covered for 40), shredded the cheese right over, melted it back in the oven, and it was perfect. Light and fluffy. Very tasty.

I love this recipe, it's easy and good.  I made this for the men's prayer breakfast at our church.  Everyone seemed to like it.  I made two with just bacon and cheese for the kids (they're picky) and one with everything.  The only thing I changed on the one I made for the adults was I added green peppers and regular onions instead of the green onions.  I also did 1 1/2 times the recipe so I could use a 9" x 13" pan.  I cooked each at 400 degrees for 24-25 minutes.

Delicious for breakfast or brunch, but be sure to sautee your veggies first before adding.  Also, I didn't bother with an electric mixer - an unnecessary step in my opinion. Other than that this is very easy and very tasty - perfect to adjust to your our tastes by adding in your own assortment of veggies, meats or cheeses. Great with a side of toast and fresh fruit!

Great recipe - we enjoyed the flavor, the texture, the color.
To make it a bit healthier we used Egg Beaters rather than whole eggs. Fluffy and yummy!

Made this for Sunday brunch for my boyfriend and I. It was VERY GOOD! I added some pepper jack cheese and a some chopped green bell pepper. Also, I baked uncovered for about 10 minutes at the end. Light and fluffy but full of good veggies. Went good with our waffles!

This was wonderful!  I used bacon and ham, green pepper and picante sauce in place of the tomatoes and olives. So easy to make!

My husband and I grilled some shrimp shish-k-bobs on labor day and we substituted some of the left overs.  Our ingredients included shrimp, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, black olives tomatoes, colby & montery jack cheese and some hot pepper flakes.  Preparation was a lot of fun and the outcome was scrumptious!!

I made this with extra-sharp Cheddar cheese along with some bagged Five Cheese Blend, and used regular onions instead of green. Thirty minutes in the oven was enough. This was so quick and easy. Thanks, Kate!

As with so many recipes I felt this needed my own twist.  I used ham pieces instead of bacon. Neither my husband nor I like olives, so we had mushrooms. And we definitely added cheese!! The result was terrific! We are big "breakfast for dinner" fans. And I am sure this will be a family favorite.

This was a great recipe - I don't think I've ever made a baked omelet before. I had exactly 10 eggs I needed to use up, and this recipe fit the bill. I made it pretty much as written. For the hot pepper sauce, I used 1/2 tsp. (about 4 dashes, I think) of Tabasco sauce, and for the olives I opted for sliced ones (a 3.8 oz. can) instead of whole, so they'd disperse better in the dish. At 40 minutes the eggs didn't look quite set enough in the center, so I went the full 50 minutes, and the dish was pretty near perfect. I had it for 3 consecutive breakfasts, and I should note that the leftovers were able to be refrigerated and reheated just fine. I enjoyed this a lot - the ingredients were a lively, tasty mix. I personally would always prefer even more bacon (and/or other meats) and cheese inside an omelet, but I'll still give this a 5-star rating.

I  modified this to a healthy version..I used egg beaters (southwestern style is really good!)..I use Kraft fat free shredded cheese, I used pico de gallo in place of veggies, and I used real bacon pieces in the package, as they are lower in fat, I added a hint of JD's bacon salt!  And used sea salt, a little lower in sodium!  Still protien packed and yummy!

My hubby also preferred this more than I did but I'll make some changes next time.  I had too much juice which pooled as someone else mentioned.  I had to bake for 1 hour.  The reviews said to saute the veggies first.  I'm sure that will fix the problem.  I used Southwest Egg beaters since hubby has a cholesterol problem. Since I've not used them before I thought maybe I should not have added the milk but will try again with milk and SAUTED veggies.  I added ham but bacon will be good too.  I added red and green peppers which I'll saute next time with the mushrooms.  The recipe is easy and made a nice dinner with a ham slice.  I will make this again.  Thanks for a great way to make omelets easier.

Just what the doctor ordered! Was looking for a quick breakfast dish that didn't require overnight prep! I used recipe proportions but took the advice of several reviewers and saute'd the veggies and threw in brocolli, cauliflower, red & green peppers and a layer of spinach near the bottom! Used a Mexican blend cheese (co-jack, cheddar, asiago) and baked for 50 minutes covered. It should have come out at 45 but still moist and firm. Definitely on my "make again" list!

I agree the flavor & presentation is nice.  I also agree w/others that sauteing vegies is a must as well as baking uncovered.  Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used a few sundried tomato slices in oil. Yum!

Omitted olives and mushrooms.  Used 2/3 pound of bacon, but it could stand the entire pound.  Serves 4 rather than 6.   A very easily prepared and tasty dish.

Im a mother of 3 and own my own laying hen's, so this a an easy, fast , healthy way to feed the family and use up the over abundance of eggs I get from my hen's(They take thier job very seriously :) I change the recipe a little too. I used 1/2 cup half/half and used cooked ham and 1 1/2 c. medium cheddar cheese...Turned out great! Thank you! I didnt add olives due to to many family members not liking them :)

I served this as a special brunch for my wife on Christmas day. I screwed the recipe up a little... I guess. I like to eat picante sauce on my eggs, and so does my wife. I thought it would be okay to chop up some jalapenos and throw them into the mix. Well, the peppers were not a hit. I thought it tasted pretty good, so I ended up eating most of it myself. Anyhow, I guess you shouldn't mess with perfection. ;) I will definitely try this again, and next time I won't change anything. Otherwise, I really like lots of "stuff" in my eggs (and omelets)--this was great.

My guest and I enjoyed this dish. I made a meatless dish with egg whites. I used spinach and left out the tomatoes as one reviewer indicated. I also waited until the dish was done before putting in the cheese. I don't like olives, this dish was easy and exciting. We will make this dish when we are on our vacation, great dish for large company.

Plan to make this very soon.  As for the picture, to me it looks like the omelet was folded double, as it should be, and was decorated with avo and not sure if it was grapes.  Anyway, avo could be quite nice with this dish!

I give it 5 stars as it sounds delicious and easy, and I am always looking for egg recipes like this one for a big group for breakfast!

Wow - some of these reviews are quite old.  In all that time, did anyone discover whether it could be frozen, e.g. eat half, freeze the rest ??? Thanks !  To get this question posted, I'm rating a 5 (benefit of doubt)

This was awesome! It was aromatic in the oven, the tomatoes were not overcooked and I added a can of green chilies and left out the bacon and the olives as I had none. I have chickens too and this is a great way to cook eggs for dinner:)

I can't rate this recipe because I altered it so much. I omitted the mushrooms and peppers because I didn't have any. I used yellow onion instead of green, and mozzarella instead of Colby Jack. I added some canned corn to make up the veggies I omitted. I didn't bake my omelet, but used a burner. I also cut the recipe in half. It was really good! Thank you for giving me a stepping stone!

I did this as a stove top omelet instead of an oven baked. I didn't use the olives or tomatoes. Instead I used green peppers, and I added a little cream cheese just for fun. So good!

Supper nummy! I added some cubbed ham and 2 more eggs. The whole family (including my picky eater) loved it! I also like that it’s baked in a casserole dish instead of a cupcake sheet, I can never seem to get it so it doesn’t stick to the cupcake holes, this came out super easy with no fight.

This is a great recipe. For two people I used one cup of egg whites and loaded it with vegetables including spinach, mushrooms, bell pepper, green onions, and Turkey bacon.   I also added the cheese 15 minutes at the end of the cooking time which was perfect. This saved me the fiddling of frying two omelets and can be a nice dinner with a salad!

I swapped out the mushrooms for diced bell peppers and added a whole pound of bacon instead of the half.

Excellent!  I reduced the Serving Size to 3 as we only had 2 people and 4 eggs and we still had a little bit left over. I omitted the mushrooms and olives only because I didn't have any on hand.  Used cream and half n half instead of milk, (I know, I know), and a little mix of sharp cheddar, Swiss, and mozzarella - basically the last of the cheese on hand.  It was delicious.  Will make again for sure. Now I must walk 2 miles...maybe 4.

Three stars for ease of recipe.  Not a mess to clean up after too.  Which was nice.  We used ham instead of bacon and red bell pepper instead of olives due to personal preferance.  There was almost too much stuff mixed in and not enugh egg.  Watch cooking time because ours was a little dry.

I used drained stewed tomatoes and light creme cheese with chives for the cheese.  Tasty, fluffy and delicious.
