A very flavorful fresh Panna Cotta. The recipe was quick & easy to make! The only thing I would try different is add more gelatin. It could have been firmer, perhaps it is a difference in gelatin brands. I used Knox.  When I topped it with the blueberry sauce, it fell. I will double the gelatin the recipe calls for next time. For simplicity, pie filling could be used for the sauce.  I enjoyed this recipe. It was a nice change & could make an elegant finish to a meal.

I’m pretty sure that I made this last year and it came out great.However I made it twice already the last couple weeks and it came out very liquidly. One thing I did do was make my own buttermilk which consisted of 1 cup of milk and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice I’m wondering if that’s why it’s not setting correctly. I changed the recipe for four servings so I’m only using 3/4 teaspoon of the gelatin I wish that when you broke down the recipe that it would also break down the in the directions as well.

I've made panna cotta so many times I've lost count, and this is a particularly good recipe.  I've made it flavored (chocolate, lemon, coffee, etc) and I've made it without buttermilk.  This is the best.

Doesn't matter if it's a simple meal in the summer or something more heavy and time consuming in the winter, this dessert works great - and I've never had anyone who said they didn't like it.  So easy!  So delicious!  So perfect!
