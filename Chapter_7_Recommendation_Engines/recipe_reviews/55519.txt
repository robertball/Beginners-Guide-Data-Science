If you like the Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies, you will like these snacks.    People at work loved them!  You don't even taste the cracker!  Easy for kids to make on their own!

I definitely liked the, but I was expecting more of a "thin mint" taste.  I wasn't used to having the salty of the cracker with the sweet of the chocolate.  I used Ritz, and in the future I will try to brush off some of the salt, or see if they have a low sodium version!
