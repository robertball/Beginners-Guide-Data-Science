My husband and I loved this recipe! It is best when served immediately after adding the dressing, but is also good as a leftover (unlike most lettuce salads).  My children weren't crazy about it.  But then, they don't like many veggies that aren't drenched with ranch dressing.

This was a very interesting combination of flavors and textures: sweet and savory, crunchy and chewy. I made quite a few changes, but they were all minor: I subbed olive oil for vegetable, pure maple syrup for brown sugar, fresh herbs and garlic for dried, and cashews and pistachios for peanuts (I don't eat peanuts). I also left out the celery and carrot because of personal preference. I used dehydrated banana, which has more of a chewy raisin texture. As unusual as the banana is in this dish, I wouldn't be afraid of it--it blends in perfectly with the rest of the flavors. Next time, I'll increase the herbs, peppers, and onions, because they add a great flavor.

THIS WILL BE A REGULAR AT OUR HOUSE. I LIKE TO MAKE THINGS FROM SCRATCH SO THAT I KNOW WHAT WE ARE REALLY EATING...NO HIDDEN INGREDIENTS.  DELICIOUS!  SURPRISING COMBINATION OF FRUITS, NUTS AND VEGETABLES, BUT IT DOES ALL WORK OUT WELL.  I EVEN ADDED CAULIFLOWER.  I HALVED THE RECIPE AND ENDED UP WITH A TRANSFERRING EVERING THING INTO AN 8QT STOCK POT...WITH TWO ADULTS AND 5 CHILDREN 6 AND UNDER...WE ATE IT ALL UP EXCEPT FOR MAYBE 4 CUPS OF IT...NOW THAT SHOULD SAY SOMETHING...I THINK I WOULD EVEN ADD MORE NUTS TO THE SALAD NEXT TIME...JUST CAUSE I REALLY ENJOYED THE NUTTY FLAVOR AND HAVING SOME PROTEIN IN THE SALAD.

Vinegarette (used balsamic vin) was great! Made the recipe as written minus the banana and celery.  Love the combo of flavors!

This is an excellent salad!  I have made it many times.  It is a great salad to take to a potluck because it stays well and makes a lot.  Everywhere I take it, I get requests for the recipe.The only thing that I change every time I make it is to use banana chips in place of fresh bananas.  Fresh bananas get mushy when they sit.  This salad is also good the next day and even the next.
