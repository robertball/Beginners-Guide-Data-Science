This was a 5 star recipe without the 1 cup white sugar, just like everyone said.  I made this for a catered wedding and it got rave reviews.  I added summer sausage, olives, cubed cheddar cheese and substituted the one green pepper with half of a green and half of a red pepper. The sauce makes enough for 2 lbs instead the one in the recipe (which worked out great since I had a boat load of pasta to make).  I loved the tangy sweetness of the dressing.  I will definitly be making this salad again!!!  Thanks so much for the recipe, it's just what I was looking for!!!

This pasta salad is great as is , my grandmom has made it for years but the key is ....to make it and then let it sit for 24- 36 hours or it will be to sweet and too thin.

This makes a HUGE bowl of salad that is sure to be a crowd pleaser!  Thanks, Jan for a quality recipe.  I made this last night, following others raters advise, I did not use the cup of sugar it called for.  I'm so glad I didn't use it as the sweetened condensed milk is sweet enough.  I also added broccoli and grated sharp cheddar cheese.  Refridgerated overnight, and had it for lunch today.  Very good, though very sweet.  The dressing was just right, not too much, not too little, not too thick, not too thin.  My only complaint is that I could have used more broccoli since we love broccoli salad.  Update:  This made so much that I had my son come by to get a big bowl for his supper.  He rated it a 4...said it was too sweet.  My hubby rated it a 5. So there you go..it's up to the taste buds.  I will make it again though, thanks again for the recipe.

After reading other reviews I omitted the cup of sugar and am glad I did. It would have been WAY too sweet with the sugar. I made half the dressing, it was plenty, and used fat free sweetened condensed milk and light mayo to reduce the calories. In addition I added two Tble of dijon mustard to balance the sweetness. You can add a lot of veggies to up the nutrient value of this dish.

I have been searching for this recipe! A local grocery store sells a similar salad with the addition of brocolli florets and shredded cheddar. It is quite pricey as well. I tried this recipe and was delighted that it is EXACTLY like the one at the store.  I did add the brocolli florets and cheddar and it was wonderful  Thank you so much!

I was looking for the sweet-tasting pasta salad like they have at the deli. But this one turned out a little too sweet for me. I adjusted it a little by adding less sugar than the recipe called for and mixing in buttermilk to add some tartness. The buttermilk added a wonderful creaminess and balanced out the sweetness! I would definitely make this again.

Yum! My family really liked this recipe. Adjust the sugar to your taste. I throw in some leftover chicken to make a cool, main dish for dinner or a great lunch.

Someone said it's the mayo that makes this sweet. No. It's the sugar and the sweetened condensed milk. I did not care for this recipe. Way too sweet and you end up with soup for a dressing. Flavors should be subtle not overwhelming, and dressing should be just enough to coat the ingredients with just a dab of the dressing. It shouldn't be dressing with salad. It should be salad with a dressing. Dressing should complement the salad.

This is without a doubt my favorite pasta salad!  My mom makes this all the time and it was the first time I have made it myself.  Before I started making it, I called her for a couple tips.  Tip #1: Do NOT add all the vinegar at once.  It all depends on how soupy you want your pasta salad.  I was fine with 1/2 C. vinegar total.  Tip #2: Despite other reviews, Do NOT omit the sugar!  Did you guys not see the title of the recipe "SWEET Pasta Salad?"  The sugar makes it all the better.  Also, this makes ALOT of pasta, I wish I would have halved it but hey-more for me, right?  I'm literally inhaling this stuff as I type.  Yum!

I have to give this one 5 stars for the simple fact that I took this to a work luncheon and everyone RAVED about it.  It was a bit on the sweet side for me...but I still thought it had a good flavor!

I've made this several times now and people always ask for the recipe.The only modification I make is to use only 1/4 cup of white sugar as the condensed milk makes it sweet enough.Thanks for a great recipe!

This was great, a little too sweet though so I also omitted the sugar. Next time I made it I was out of the condensed milk, so I left it out and added the sugar instead. I liked it better that way, it's still creamy enough with the mayo, and still not too sweet.

I recommend not adding the sugar. The condensed, sweetened milk makes it sweet enough. This was very tasty... I added chicken and small cubes of tangerine to it, too. I also opted for a red bell pepper instead of green. My husband said he would have liked pine nuts in it. Next time. :)

I made this for a Father's Day BBQ at my in-laws.  They all LOVED it!  Not too sweet, not too sour (which I thought might happen with the vinegar/mayo/milk combo).  Anyway, I took the suggestions of other reviewers, and made the recipe this way:  I shredded about 2 carrots (amount to taste), 1/2 chop green pepper, 1/2 chop sm onion, 1/2 c white vinegar, NO sugar, 1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk, 1/2-1 c light olive oil mayo, salt and pepper to taste (about 1 t each).  Mix, chill, and enjoy!  EDIT:  For July 4th, was asked to bring to a friend's house for their BBQ because they heard  my husband rave about it so much.  Thanks!

Great recipe!!! I've already passed the recipe on. You could add grilled chicken or shrimp  tossed salad and bread to make a simple meal.  It reminds you of Amish macaroni salad.

Used others suggestion and left out the sugar. Used 1/2 cider vinegar and 1/2 white only because I ran out. Still tasted awesome. Used up some fresh broccoli and added some chunked cheese. ALSO, used elbow macaroni because it just seems to make more although it probably doesn't. Added the dressing a little at a time. Had about 3/4 of a cup remaining. Added part of that 2 days later with some more veggies. Unique and that's exactly what I was hoping for - Thank you!

This is sooo good!  I did make a few changes.  I left the sugar out after reading other reviews and used Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  I used tri-colored rotini pasta and added a cucumber, some broccoli, some grape tomatoes, and used red and green bell pepper.  You can buy shredded carrots in the produce section, so I saved myself a step and bought those instead.  My salad is so pretty and colorful!

I added a cup of shredded cheese, frozen peas, and left out the pepper and sugar.  It was so delicious!  I added another pound of pasta because there was so much dressing, but by the next day it was dry.

very good but I did some tweeking myself. Left out the sugar like suggested, and  left out the mayo altogether. I added a shot or 2 of hot sauce and added the bacon,broccoli in the mix.  My daughter who Hates bacon loved this even though I had to tell a fib and tell her it was bacon bits (soy)

I too omitted the sugar. I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and fat free Miracle Whip. I think next time I will halve the dressing recipes since it made A LOT and I had to toss about half of it. I added about 2 tsp hot sauce to give it a little zip (I love sweet/hot) and about 4oz mild cheddar cut into small squares. I used half a green pepper and half a red. It was a GREAT pasta salad!!

I took this to a family gathering. I left out the sugar after reading some of the reviews. I threw in a red pepper. Everyone loved it.

This pasta is absolutely wonderful!! I used a red pepper instead of green, omitted the sugar b/c from previous reviews they said the sugar would make it too sweet and I'm so glad I did b/c it was perfectly sweet w/o the sugar! And I added black olives and shredded cheese. I made it the night b4 and let it sit overnight, and it turned out so good!! Everyone loved it, and asked what all was in it! And it was even requested at my friend's graduation party this weekend so I'll be making it again! Loved it! Thank you so much!

I made this for Easter dinner. It was fabulous. I left out the sugar completely and only added about half a can of the sweetened condensed milk and half a cup of white vinegar. I also put in about 1 cup of mayo too. It was perfect and was the right amount of sweetness. Yummy!!

I like the idea of adding the sweetened condensed milk but I only added 1/2 the can and still it was too sweet and runny for my family. I added 4 boiled eggs to try to absorb some of the liquid and that worked pretty good. I will make again with less mayonnaise. And probably add more pasta too.

I made this as a side for my birthday dinner.  I really liked it and will make it again (but not too often, too much sugar content).  Cut the recipe in half because it was only my husband and I.  Omitted the sugar, can't imagine adding that on top of sweetened condensed milk! It was plenty sweet, maybe a bit too much for some. Used fat free milk and  Miracle Whip not mayo. Also added some shredded cheddar cheese. Will try it for my church luncheon one of these days. Good if you want to fall off the "diet wagon" once in awhile! LOL

Everyone loved it. I also eliminated the sugar and it was great. But many reviewers said to cut the dressing down.  I did that and after 24 hours had to add more as it was really dry. So next time I will do all the dressing and wait at least 24 hours before serving.

This is an okay recipe.  Overall, it has a good taste, but it's a bit too sweet which can make it hard to eat more than a few bites.  I made it the night before and followed the recipe exactly.  It looked a bit slimy but did dry up quite a bit overnight.  I'm not sure if the condensed milk put it over the top, but I will might leave it out next time and just add more mayo if it needs more moisture.  I think that will be a nice mix of traditional pasta salad and the sweet pasta salad because I'll keep the sugar in.

I didn't add any sugar and it was sweet and tangy. Next  time, less sweetened condensed milk and less vinegar. I only made half of the dressing and it was more than enough!

Definitely not my favorite pasta salad.  I thought the kids would like it because it was sweet, but even though I didn't add all the sweetness (see other reviews), it was still too sweet.  I ate it because I didn't want to waste it, not because I particularly liked it.

Read other peoples reviews, and decided to use evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed milk.  Added the one sugar, and it was perfect.  Added a package of steamed brocolli as others did, and cut up a jar of whole roasted red peppers, since i did not have any bell peppers.  Also had a jar of calamata olives on hand.  Added those.  Used another reviewers idea of using balsamic vinegar for 3/4 of the vinegar......this recipe came out excellent, the only thing i would have liked to add was a little grated cheddar cheese, and maybe a few boiled eggs when serving.  With the minor changes, this recipe was excellent!

For those people who thought this was too sweet, use Miracle Whip instead of the mayo. I have loved this salad for years, but always use rotini.

I just tried this recipe with the following changes and additons:
1) Used 3/4 cup Balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar instead of all distilled white vinegar.
2) Only used 1/2 cup of white sugar.
3) Substituted large red sweet pepper for the green pepper.
4) Added 1 16 ox bag of frozen, mixed  vegetables ( a combination of carrots, broccoli, white beans, garbanzo beans and green beans with red peppers) that I "nuked" in the microwave for abt 6 minutes. Very yummy!

Pretty good.  I halved the vinegar, sweetened condensed milk, and mayonnaise.  I left out the white sugar completely.  It was still very sweet.  I added a little cheddar cheese and some chopped black olives.

Really yummy! I added broccoli and snow peas and water chestnuts and pretty much anything else I could think of in one or the other of the times I've made this and it always turns out great! This it the best pasta salad I've ever made. I think the dressing would make a great coleslaw dressing too.

We enjoyed this pasta salad, however we did make changes. My husband and I tasted this without the sugar added and it was perfect. The sweetened condensed milk made the salad sweet enough for us. This is so versatile, we added lots of veggies and shredded cheese. Thank you.

This made a lot, so I had leftovers. I can't stay away from the bowl, and with all those grams of fat, that's not a good thing.  To me, it tastes exactly like KFC slaw, but in a pasta salad.  It was a little too soupy for me, though, so next time, I'll reduce the mayo/evap milk/vinegar and then add them back as the texture requires.

I really enjoyed this salad!  It was very unique.  It was perfectly creamy and sweet.  I did cut down on the sugar though.  My husband loved it too.  It's a perfect salad to make ahead for company or potlucks.

Loved the sweet sauce with this pasta salad.  I did add bacon & cheese. I made all the sauce but only mixed about 3/4's of it in with the pasta.  I found all the sauce was a little to much.  I probably will cut the sugar in half next time.  If you like a sweet pasta salad this is a great recipe.

I modified this recipe.  I skipped the sugar and added a can of black olives that I sliced.  The black olives added some color to the salad.  This recipe does not need the cup of sugar.  It is sweet without it. 
  I did not have the problem others have mentioned with the excess dressing.  I followed the directions and refrigerated it for a few hours before serving.  The dressing soaked into the pasta.
  I will definitely make this recipe again.  It is a keeper!

I just made last weekend. My family really like it. I didn't put any sugar in the salad at all. It was just right. I will be making this alot this summer.

This took awhile to make, but it was well worth the time.  I had a house warming party and had 30 people here, ran out of this early!  Will be making this again

I don't suppose it is really fair to rate this recipe since I made so many changes to it. I halved the recipe and made it lighter.  I cut everything in half except the shredded carrots, of which I still used all 4, and I substituted frozen petite peas for the green bell pepper since they don't agree with me.  I used low fat sweetened condensed milk and fat free mayo.  I only used about 3/4 of the dressing (even when halved) and it was still too much.  Next time I will cut the dressing in half. I will also cut the amount of onion in half. Next time I will use broccoli rather than peas since I think this dressing will go nicely with broccoli.  But the sweet dressing was a nice change, and I will definitely make it again.

From other reviews I cut this in half and it was plenty for 1 box of pasta.  It turned out good, different, but no one complained.  I will add it to my summer salad mix.  Thanks

This is one of my favorite pasta salads.  I use the Cremette Large Ring Macaroni noodles.  It makes ALOT so I often make it for potlucks at work and save half for home or serve at parties and gatherings.  Make this the night before and serve the next day and DON'T OMIT the sugar!!!

I'm glad I read the reviews advising not to add the sugar, that would make it sickeningly sweet. I added broccoli and substituted red and orange bell pepper.

Ok...so, I can't really complain that this was too sweet - what, with "sweet" in the title and all. I just wanted to try it. But... yuck. It was way too sweet for my taste. I won't be making this again.... ever. I should note that my two kids DID like it. Go figure. :)

This was a great recipe, but really quite sweet. I may cut the sugar in half next time. My family is vegetarian, so we added some fake chicken, which turned out wonderful. Thanks!

I was looking for something to take to a BBQ on a very hot summer evening.  I followed some of the suggestions and found this recipe was nice for a change but probably not a new family favorite.  I didn't add any sugar and cut the dressing in half.  It was plenty sweet and I thought the amount of dressing was right for about 15oz of dry pasta.  I include grape tomatos, carrots, black olives, and bell pepper.  Several people complimented me on the salad.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I did not add all the dressing to the salad (keep out about 2 cups) and the pasta salad was still swimming in dressing.  Definitly very very very sweet, will make again but will definitly cut down the recipe for the sauce and cut the sugar at least in half.  Next time will also try what others have suggested i.e. chicken, cheese, brocolli etc.

This recipe is WAY to sweet.  I didn't even use any sugar at all!  My 7 year old who loves candy said that it was making him sick becuase its too sweet.  My 1 year old won't eat it even.  It is just going to waste in the refrigerater.  If you decide to make this, leave out the sugar and don't use all of the amount of condenced milk.  That might be better.

A fantastic sweet pasta salad.  I added broccoli, sliced cherry tomatoes & cheddar cheese to make it scrum dilly iscious!  Next time though, I'll probably cut the white sugar down to a half a cup!  A definite keeper!

We loved this dish! I used 12 ounces of the tri-colored rotini instead of a pound. I halved the dressing as some suggested in other reviews, but wish I had made it all or maybe cut it by one-fourth. It was a touch on the dry side, but that was probably because I added broccoli florets and cheese cubes, AND because I reduced the amount of sauce. Next time, I'll keep the broccoli and cheese and make the dressing just as the recipe suggests. Will be cooking this again, but only on special occasions...it's not for everyday eating for anyone who is watching their weight.

Love this and so did all my guests!  I made it for a New Years eve party and it was a huge hit.  I cut all the ingredients in half except for the pasta. I originally only made 1/2 pound of pasta, but there was too much sauce, so I made the rest!!  I will always make this pasta for parties and for my own special treat!!

I am not a big pasta salad fan, but my husband is and he liked it very much--I quite liked it too!  I left out the cup of sugar and found it to be plenty sweet enough and very tasty.  Took a big bowl to a company luncheon and two of the GUYS liked it so much they requested the recipe (a GUY?--never happened before).  So I believe it deserves a true five-star review!

I typically frown on reviews where people alter the recipe but so many folks said leave out the sugar so I did and now that I tasted it im glad. It's perfectly sweet without sugar and I can't imagine it any sweeter.  Also a local grocery store has a similar salad in their deli which has hunks of cheese in theirs so I cubed some Munster and cheddar which is a nice addition.  I feel like something is missing but not sure what.  With some slight alterations this is quite good.

I followed the advice from other reviews and did not add the sugar. I was sooo glad I didn't because the dressing is very sweet without it. I only used half of the dressing and it was plenty. Now I have enough dressing for another whole salad. I also used diced baby carrots and added broccoli. It is a pretty salad; very colorful. But it was just okay to me. Doubt that I'll make it again.

A little too sweet for my taste... and it makes a VERY large batch.  I'd 1/2 it if I make it again for a family dinner.  Perfect size for a party though.

I normally like sweet pasta salads, but this is just too sweet, even though I left out the sugar.  I think a big part of the problem is that there's just too much sauce.  It would probably be a lot better with the sauce halved or the pasta doubled.  I decided to try to salvage it.  I added dijon mustard and cheese and that cut the sweetness, but it still wasn't very good.  (I didn't try adding pasta)  After several days in the fridge, the sauce dried out enough to make the salad edible.  But I won't be making this again.

Wanted a different "pasta salad" for a Christmas Eve party & this was a success.  Only used 1 cup sugar, & fine chopped red, green & yellow bell pepper, minced half a red onion, small can drained sliced black olives, & grated carrots...had a lot of left over dressing though.  Best to make a day ahead for flavors to marry & to adjust dresssing. Yum.

This is really yummy!

Omit the sugar.  It doesn't need it at all.  I added LOTS of fresh broccoli, and also some shredded cheese like others suggested.  I also used sweet onion.
It is a 5 star salad this way.  YUMMY!!!

Bleh. WAY too sweet. I even doubled the amount of pasta and had to throw out a lot of the sauce. I followed the recipe exactly (except for doubling the pasta) and it wasn't very good.

I halved the recipe and there is still half of that left.  Tasted it before it went in the frig. and was pleaslantly surprised.  Didn't expect it to have so much pizazz so fast.  Used probably twice the recommended pepper. And Fat free SC Milk to ligthen the sugar taste. As stated in other reviews, tastes a lot like a good cole slaw sauce.

i loved it.  i followed others advice and halved the ingredients except for pasta and it wasn't nearly as sweet as i would have liked so i think i would have thought it was perfect the way it was intended.  but even halved it was wonderful.  made it for easter and everyone loved it.  got many compliments as everyone went for 2nds.  thank you!

This recipe is ALWAYS a hit. I usually use a tri-colour rotini noodle to add a little flair, and some cubed cheddar or havarti. You can really modify it however you like by adding your own touch.

Great salad. Knew it was going to be sweet, but next time I will cut the sugar down. Used red pepper instead of green, because I don't like green pepper. keeper.

Everyone loved this salad. I used 2 pounds of pasta by accident, so my salad wasn't heavy with sauce. The longer it sits, the better it is.  I made on Friday and had some Monday was super good.

First, the title says it's sweet so I knew what I was getting into.  Second, this tastes like the pasta salad we get from a little deli some Mennonite ladies cook for, "up north".  Third, everyone raves about this pasta salad and was requested for our Superbowl party today.  
I didn't completely read the directions as I added a 2 lb box of elbow noodles to this recipe and it turned out just as good as when I added the 1 lb box of noodles the recipe actually calls for.  It's very versatile!  Oh and we like to add ham, cheese, black olives, green onions, sometimes broccoli,  zucchini and whatever else our hearts desire or is in the fridge.  It's a pasta salad, have fun!  And it tastes even better the next day!

Yum!  But making it a day before eating is a must.  My pasta box was 12oz. so I cut the dressing in half.  I left out the carrots but also added broccoli and cheddar cheese as suggested.  So good and it reminded me of a deli pasta salad bought from my favorite super market.  Will make again!!

Yuck!! Sorry, but even with NO sugar, the condensed milk made this way too sweet. Just a wierd flavour altogether
