For those of you who are having a problem with the baking powder taste it is probably because you are using baking powders that contain aluminum.  Baking powders that don't contain aluminum sulfate in the ingredient list usually don't have that after taste.  Rumford is the only major brand that I know of that doesn't contain aluminum.

I also changed the recipe as others - reduced the baking powder to 2 tsps.- changed the shortening to butter and increased it to 1/2 cup - increased the sugar to 1/4 cup and added 1 tsp. vanilla extract. I also used half&half milk for a richer taste. This recipe is the old-fashioned version of short cake. It has a taste very much like scones. I hope these suggestions help others - put all your dry ingredients in a bowl and use a whisk to blend the ingredients. Have your butter at room temperature. I used a wired pastry blender to mix - the texture will be "fine" & feathery - not coarse. Make a well and add your wet ingredients and combine just until they come together. As with any biscuit recipe you don't want to over work it or your dough gets tough. I "floured" my hands with confectioner sugar and separated my dough into 8 equal mounds -then rolled each mound in the powdered sugar and fashioned into a biscuit. I allowed an inch around each biscuit as they will get larger as they bake. This recipe will make 8 "catshead" (large) biscuits. For the BEST whip cream - use heavy (or whipping) cream - to 2 cups heavy cream add 1 tsp. vanilla ext. and during the whipping add 1/2 cup powdered sugar. I made 55 shortcakes for a ladies lunch - Big Success!

Do reduce the baking powder to 2 tsp.  This is a dry shortcake, but I think many of the people who were disappointed in it expected a sponge-cake-like shortcake, instead of the biscuit variety.  These are supposed to be dryer, and get their moisture from the strawberry juice and whipped cream served with them.

This was AMAZING!!  I did deviate somewhat from the recipe though.  I took the advice of some other reviews and used 1/4 c. sugar in the batter, used 1/2 c butter instead of the shortening, added vanilla to the batter, and used 2 1/2 tsp instead of 4 tsp of baking powder.  Instead of a whole cake, I made individual sized cakes (like big biscuits) and baked them on a greased/floured baking sheet for 12-13 minutes.  I even sprinkled each of the mini cakes with a cinnamon & sugar mixture!  We then prepared them as the recipes says!  Such a hit and so easy to make!

Out of this world! I made this for my wife's birthday and it was a huge hit. 

I cut the baking power to 2 tsp like other folks, and upped the shortening to 1/2 cup, as I wasn't getting the "course crumbs". A local farm makes and sells terrific shortcake bicuits when their strawberries come out in June. This cake is exactly like those biscuits and I can have them anytime! I had no problem with crumbling, maybe because of the increased shortening. As for folks substituting butter and adding vanilla, try it according to the recipe first. The problem I've found with many "shortcakes" is that they try to be center of taste and just end up overpowering the finsihed product.

Also, I have no 8" pie pans, but I do have an 8" spring-form pan. Worked out great.

This is a keeper! Enjoy!

Anyone who is the slighest bit interested in eating shortcake, had better eat this CAKE!!!  It was almost as if heaven itself entered my mouth upon every single bite.  Not to exaggerate, but Denyse is either a Goddess, or this recipe was personally hand delivered to her front door step by Hermes himself.  If it were possible to give this recipe a 47 out of 5 star review, believe me, I would have jumped at the chance.  Please let me know if there are any other recipe's on here by Denyse because frankly....I would live in her kitchen and never leave if I knew her.  I believe I speak for everyone with functioning taste buds when I say 3 Cheers Denyse!!!

Best ever Strawberry shortcake Recipe!!!  I used 2T instead of 4T of baking powder, 1/4cup sugar instead of just 2 spoons of sugar, and a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I still can't make it uncrumbly but this is still good.  I prefer this over some imitation overly sweetened version.  The texture is thick and dense against the sweet soft strawberries and whip cream.  It's perfect.       If someone was use to the imitation version or not use to the biscuit style that would explain the "anything but 5 star rating". You have to bake this!!

What a great recipe!  Made a couple of changes:
Instead of shortbread, we used mashed potatoes.
Instead of strawberries, we used some braised lamb shanks with a delicious gravy.
We added a layer of creamed spinach and some boiled carrots, and baked the whole thing together for about 45 minutes.
Everyone agreed that this was the best strawberry shortcake ever!

This is very delicious!  The cake is like a sweet biscuit, but that's how old fashioned is!  It's got such a "soft" taste - not overpowering!  I will be making this over and over and over.  My brother, son and husband loved it!!  And it's pretty easy too!  I did add about 3 tbs of sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla to the whipped cream when it was just about fully whipped.  Delicious!

I used an angel food cake instead to make it easier. I also mixed sweetened condensed milk with the whip cream to make it thicker. This is a great recipe and everyone loved it.

I altered the recipe as the other users suggested, using 1/4cup sugar instead of 2tsb and 2tsp of baking powder instead of 4. The cake smelt great and had a good spring to it, but tasted really bland. Could be the shortening, I'd try this with butter the next round and maybe a little vanilla.

I just made these, following the advice of previous reviews.  They are perfect!  I had to try one before our dinner guests arrive.  I improvised with 1/2 cup room temp. butter instead of shortening, reduced to 2 tsp baking powder, increased to 1/4 cup sugar in batter (left all rest the same).  I sprinkled each with a mixture of sugar/cinnamon before baking and they are delicious, flaky and don't taste "doughy" or like baking powder.  Baked at 425 for 20 minutes on parchment paper.  I will definitely make these again!

This was excellent shortcake!  My mom always made it from Bisquick and I hated it because it was so hard and tasteless.  This was so soft and flavorful.  I only used 2 tsp. of baking soda as recommended by some of the other reviews, and about a 1/3 cup of sugar since I prefer mine sweet.  I also used heavy cream in place of the milk since I didn't want the leftover cream sitting in the fridge.  I baked mine in an 8X8 pan so I could cut it into squares and it worked great too.  The kids loved it and so did I!

This was excellent. It's a true shortcake,  I chose to cut individual slices and split them for serving and this worked very well.  I used butter flavored shortening and cut the baking powder to 3 teaspoons.

we made 2 layers, the first we followed the recipe to a T and used an electric mixer (not that we really used it that much) It turned out good, but slightly dense and not sweet enough. 

On the second layer/try we doubled the sugar and halved the baking powder as well as hand mixed it. It turned out much better!

We had everyone taste test and everyone agreed.

I also baked it with a second cake pan filled with water below it to keep it more moist.

I made an organic version, and used butter instead of shortening in the shortcake.  The shortcake was very moist, not dry like the other reviewer mentioned, and had a sweet buttery quality.  I love this recipe, and will use it often!!!!!

This is SOOOOO good.  Admittedly I did not read all zillion pages of reviews however, of the ones I did read I did not notice anyone mention how thick this batter turns out to be, I thought I'd done something wrong.  So be warned, this batter is T-H-I-C-K!!!  But WOWOW!!!  Is it good!!  The only changes I made were, as others suggested, used 1/2 cup butter instead of shortening, added 1 tsp of both vanilla and almond extract to the batter.  My family has already asked when I'm making this one again!!

This is one of the best strawberry shortcakes that I have ever had. I usually make one at least once a month (sometimes 2 or 3 times a month) and my family loves it. The recipe is simple to make and it will taste good when without any modifications.

As other people suggested, I made the following changes: decreased baking powder to 2 tsp; increased sugar to 1/4 cup; instead of shortening I used 1/2 cup of butter; added 1 tsp of vanilla extract when mixing-in the egg and milk; and I also added some sugar and vanilla to the whipping cream.  I wanted to make individual cakes, so I divided the dough into 8 biscuits. I baked them for about 15 and they turned out perfect! My guests LOVED it!  One of them actually used his finger to clean his plate. (Sooooo not attractive.) This recipe is definitely a keeper!! =)

This was beautiful to present and tasted amazing.  I like to try the recipe as directed before making any changes, and in this case that was a good choice.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfect!  I had a gorgeous biscuity shortcake that was excellent with the whipped cream and strawberries.  2 notes: 1) Some reviewers added more shortening when their mixture didn't really resemble course crumbs.  It's true, there isn't really enough shortening for the whole thing to be very crumby - it almost just mixes in, and there are just really fine crumbs.  But that's okay, it turns out great. 2) After cutting the cake in half, I spread whipped cream between the halves and put 2 layers of sliced strawberries on top, and then added the top half.  I piled some strawberries on the top and put a huge dollop of whipped cream on top of that.  Then I spread the rest of the strawberries all around the edges of the plate around the cake, so they encircled the cake.  It was really showy, but this is actually a fairly easy dessert to make.

The cake isn't too sweet; enhancing and absorbing the sweetness of the strawberries just like it should.  I didn't modify the recipe at all.  I think a lot of people are expecting cake and not shortcake.  I LOVED IT!  It was a trip to memories at my aunts house...

Absolutely fabulous.  I made this recipefor my father's birthday and he and I both loved it.  Substituted peaches for the strawberries as I am allergic to strawberries.  I might add a little bit more sugar to the batter next time as I would have liked it to be a hair sweeter.  And be warned, when finished mixing, this is more like a bread dough than a batter; it will need to be spread into your pan, it will not pour like cake batter.

This was excellent!  I didn't have any shortening so I used butter instead and made about 8 small shortcakes instead of 1 large one.  They were delicious, no baking powder taste at all!

WOW! I was looking for a REAL Strawberry Shortcake recipe, and found it right here. Strawberry Shortcake is supposed to have a biscuit texture, so the berries don't get sloppy and gooey, and this is it. In the mid-late century, convenience processed foods came along and before anyone knew it, there went most of the great homemade cooking - in this case, one of the mass manufactured treats included single serving sponge cake in portions of six or eight which quickly took over the traditional flavor, texture and density. The Strawberry Shortcake then soon became a sticky, over soaked mess which had the texture of pudding with strawberry seeds in it providing the only discernible texture. All it took to accomplish this atrocity was a quick trip to the grocery chain store, pick up a six pack of single serve sponge cake, grab a can of processed whipped cream in a can, and some frozen strawberries. GACK. It might have made your kids quiet for awhile, but it was a lame excuse for the real thing. And the kids knew it. This recipe is for the real thing. The cake serves mostly as a structure; if you serve it warm (like most people do) it's strong enough to keep it's shape, but soft enough to absorb the taste of the fruit, which in turn supports the whipped cream. The end result is the cake getting it's flavor - strawberries and cream, without turning to mush. If you are looking for a strawberry cake, this isn't it. Google that recipe instead. This is the authentic Strawberry Shortcake.

This makes an excellent shortcake--This is the only recipe I'll use for shortcake from now on.  Because I wanted it to be sweeter, I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a few extra tablespoons of sugar.  Margarine in place of the shortening worked fine.  And I used 1 less teaspoon of baking powder than what was called for; This way the cake was just a bit softer than the standard shortcake.  Anyway, this is a fabulous recipe for a classic dessert.  :)

I loved this after I made some very slight changes. This is better like this:  cold butter shortening cut up (do not combine this entirely it is ok to leave some small pieces)  , 4 tbs sugar, 1 tbs vanilla. Do not overmix. It is best just to use your hands and stop as soon as all the ingredients are moist. I found that spreading it in a pan made it tough. I greased a pizza pan and just dumped the shortcake in the center of the pan, then I sprinkled the top with sugar before I put it in the oven.

Here are my changes: used 2tsp baking powder, 1/4 cup sugar (i think it'll require 1/2 cup for sweeter taste), 1/2 cup shortening & 1/2tsp Vanilla, baked for 10-15min on middle rack in a muffin tray (good for 8 individual servings). It turned out very moist, fluffy and it solved the cracking problem. It was soft and easy to cut, not a single crumb. I also sprayed pam on the surface of batter before baking and sprinkled with sugar. This is my first time trying a shortcake, maybe there is better but so far this is good enough for my taste. Hope this will be of a help to others. Next time will experiment with less shortening.

Excellent!  Made it with butter instead of shortening, very thick batter that I pressed into the pan and it came out light and delicious.

Excellent!  just like my grandma used to make!  After making this a few times i did make a few changes.  1)  cut the baking powder down to 2tsp. 2) increased the sugar to 1/4 cup  3)  used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortning 4) added a few drops of vanilla extract to the egg/milk mix.  I also found that this really didn't rise much - so i make double to use as the "top" and "bottom" as the display pic.  Otherwise i prefer to make "biscuts" as individual servings.  I also add 1/2 tsp vanilla and powdered sugar to the homemade whipping cream.

This was great!!  I only changed the shortening to butter and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I baked the cakes in my muffin pan (15mins at 425), and got 10 cakes.  It tastes just like the ones my grandma used to make...even my husband thought it was fabulous, and he was dubious at first because he is used to the ones made with angel food cake.  This is definately a keeper!!!!  Thanks Denyse!!!!

I love this recipe! It's one of my favorites and I use it all the time! Whether or not you listen to other people and change the recipe, it's still delicious. I myself have made it both ways (The most suggested being decrease to 2 teaspoons baking powder, increase sugar to 1/4 cup, butter instead of shortening and add vanilla)There is a difference, but not enough to throw a fuss about. Thank you, Denyse, for an awesome recipe!

This was delicious! I replaced the shortening with butter but I actually liked that the cake was not as sweet as the rest of it. I put sugar in the whipped cream and dusted icing sugar over the top before serving, which provided some more sweetness. I also experimented with putting a layer of good strawberry jam (like Bon Maman or something homemade) in between the two layers of the shortbread, which added some more sweetness as well. Will definitely keep this in my recipe box!

I love the slightly sweet, biscuit-like texture of this shortcake. In addition to being delicious, it has an old-fashioned, wholesome feel that makes me really enjoy ending a meal with it.

This was perfect - it was exactly what I was hoping for!  I prepared this for dessert after Easter dinner and it went over very well.  Others have complained that the cake is not actually cake, which is true - but this is what REAL shortcake is supposed to be - more like a biscuit than a cake.

I made homemade strawberry sauce (3 cups strawberries pureed in a blender, 1/3 cup of sugar and 1 tsp. of cornstarch mixed together and heated on the stove until warm) to serve on top of the cake.  I added the strawberry sauce and fat free whipped topping to each individual serving rather than dousing the entire cake with it.

I will be making this recipe often!  I can't wait to have another serving this evening!

Maybe I should have baked this just a bit longer because it was a bit gluey but it was good. I did reduce the baking powder because it did have that metallic taste. Not the best but not the worst.

Perfect! This was exactly the kind of short cake that I was looking for! Its not like the sponge cake that you would buy pre-made @ the store to use but more of a crumbly biscuit type. I altered nothing from the original recipe and found it plenty sweet and tasty. More sugar imo would have been overpowering.

Very good.  Although, I did make a few adjustments to suit my own taste.  I sifted all my dry ingredients together, used a combination of buttermilk and reg milk, only 2tsp of baking powder, 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 stick of butter and 1 tsp of vanilla.  Would this be considered a new recipe...lol.  It came out very good.  I was very pleased.

Not bad at all, but indeed reduce the baking powder a bit.

To all those who wrote 1-star reviews, complaining about this not being a "pound" or other plain white cake -- take note: It is not supposed to be.  Shortcake is a very specific type of batter, which is much more like a scone or biscuit.  It is supposed to be that way!

Very tasty! Used buttermilk instead of plain milk and added a tsp of vanilla extract. and sprinkled course sugar on top before baking. Turned out very moist on the inside, yet crunchy on the outside.

This was probably the best shortcake I've made so far! I took some suggestions from the other comments:  I reduced the baking powder from 4 tsp. to 2 tsp., I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of the 1/3 cup of shortening to avoid crumbling, and I added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract to the mix. The reason I only gave it four stars was because when I made the cake it was very flatish, so I was unable to cut it in half, might have been just me doing something wrong. If I wanted two layers I would have to make two cakes, and with no time I just made a one layer strawberry shortcake. All in all: amazing. I will definitely be making this again, very soon!

Mmmm, this was good! I liked the simplicity of the cake but I used the suggestions (butter instead of shortening, 2tsp baking powder, 1/4c sugar in mix) and it turned out well. I prefer a cakier texture and this was definitely it

AWESOME!!!!! Do not worry about making this recipe because of a couple bad reviews, those people have never had the original "shortcake" they probably always have it on pound cake or angel food cake, which is also good, but I was looking for the old fashioned short cake like my mom and grandma made and I found it!!  I did not change a thing with the recipe itself, but I did take the advice of a couple reviews and put in a 8" round cake pan, sliced it like a pie when it was done and opened up the slices in a bowl, put a little butter and sprinkle of sugar on top then poured on the strawberrys(I mashed mine with sugar) YUM YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!
Also it was very easy, I didnt even have a pastry blender and just used a fork and a wire whisk and it was great!
THANK YOU for the great recipe!!

I used this recipe primarily for the biscuit part because I like to do individual servings vs. having to cut up one big one.  So as for the biscuits, they were great!!!!  I took the advice of some other members and cut down on the amount of baking powder (I used about 2 1/2 tsps instead of 4) and then I just simply separated the batter into 6 pieces and dropped them onto a cookie sheet and baked for about 10 minutes, or until brown on the edges.  They came out lightly crunchy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside.  When topped with the sweetened strawberries and homemade whipped cream, it was the perfect mix!!  I'll definitely use this recipe for my biscuits again!

Excellent recipe. I added some vanilla and some extra butter. The baking powder wasn't overwhelming to me but I could taste it a little, so I will decrease it by 1/2 a teaspoon next time. This is very good and a nice change from the cakey strawberry shortcake!
I also used a muffin tin instead of a cake pan. Came out in nice individual servings!

this recipe was fabulous!  i was a little nervous after reading the reviews to make it, but i'm glad i did.  it is not your light cake that most people think of.  i followed the recipe exactly.  there was no baking powder flavor.  USE your strawberry liquid on the cake when you cut it in half.  FABULOUS!

Good recipe. I added an extra tablespoon of sugar, and next time I think I'll even add another (so there are 4 tbsps altogether). Also, I'd add about a tsp of vanilla next time. Overall, pretty good!

Oh my. This recipe is dangerous, especially if it's only you and one other person in the house. I got a deal on strawberries so I was trying to find ways to use them up. Came across this recipe and now there's no turning back! Was worried that it may not keep very well because I had already added the strawberries and wasn't sure if it would get it too soggy but it was even better the next day! The shortbread infused with the syrup-y strawberries was exquisite! Thanks for the recipe!

Some people may say that the shortcake isn't sweet enough. But you know, with the strawberries and whipped cream, it's pretty darn good!  It's cool because you can have it plain and  have it as a scone  with butter and jam or something for breakfast.  Either way, it's DELICIOUS!  But I thought the batter was a little dry, so add a little milk. Just a little.

This is amazing, the best shortcake I've ever had.  I have no idea how someone could make this wrong or in such a way where it isn't ideal!  I am making it again tomorrow for a family event!

SOOOOO yummy!!  Definitely reduce baking powder to 2 tsp, increase batter sugar to 1/4 - 1/2 cup depending on your sweet tooth, and add 1 - 2 tsp of vanilla.  THIS IS YOUR BEST BET FOR OLD FASHIONED STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE!!!

Wow.  Just... wow!  I am in love with this recipe.  I changed 2 things: cut down the baking powder to 2 tsp like others suggested and used butter rather than shortening.  For the first time, I really enjoyed strawberry shortcake and didn't feel like I was eating my berries on a damp sponge.  Never again will I buy the grocery store "shortcakes" if I can help it!

I decreased the baking powder to 3 teaspoons and added 1/4 c sugar - I wouldn't do that again.  The sugar from the strawberries and the whipping cream plus the cake - made it too sweet.  The "cake" was sort of crunchy on the outside and very moist on the inside.  I used butter instead of shortening.  I would make this again.  Mahalo!

followed the advice of 2tsp baking powder and 1/4t salt.  Used butter rather than shortening and cut it all in with my Cuisinart dough blade.  It was simple and amazing.  Fresh whipped cream is a MUST, made with vanilla bean and powdered sugar.  PERFECT

Made this recipe as is.  It's a staple in my home, especially now during strawberry season.  

When I tell people I'm making/bringing strawberry shortcake, they are often expecting sponge or angelfood cake, so I'm on a little mission to educate people on what SHORTCAKE really is.  Nothing like it and everyone always raves about how yummy this shortcake is.

Didn't have any baking mix, so I decided on this recipe instead of my normal, easy shortcake recipe.  Glad I did!  Just as easy and yummy!  I didn't follow the directions for layering.  Just baked and cut up; then poured sweetened strawberries all over.

Wonderful!!  I followed the suggestions by others.  2 tsps of Bp, 1/4 c sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla.  I wanted it to be a large shortcake like the pic, to instead of baking it in a pan I freeformed a large biscuit about 8 in and baked it on a silpat.  It was wonderful, cut beautifully and was not dry or crumbly.  i will definetly make this again.  I also added vanilla to my whipping cream and sugar.   I also dusted the top of the shortcake with red sanding sugar, this added a nice sweetness and crunch.

This was good.  Don't be expecting a pound cake type dish though.  This is a shortcake which is supposed to be biscut like.  The sweet comes from the berries not the cake.

I followed the advice of others and used 1/4 c sugar, less baking powder and some vanilla and I really liked how it turned out. It is a traditional  shortcake recipe (biscuit style)which I prefer not a fluffly sponge cake. So if you're looking for angel food cake this isn't for you. I also found that it will serve about 12 rather than 9 just because it is more dense and filling. The dough is supposed to be thick so don't worry when you see it. Also, I used a square pan rather than a round one as it makes for easier slicing and serving.

If you want a super sweet dessert, this isn't the best dessert for you.  However- I think this came out great.  I did add vanilla to the batter... and I used Cool Whip Lite with it.  Its a sweet treat without all the extra calories.  I think it has a great contrast between the cake and the whipped cream and the strawberries.  Each have their own unique taste and the cake isnt overly sweet- which as I mentioned is a good thing!

This was excellent!  I did, however, make the recommended adjustments:
To the shortcake:
-decrease to only 2 tsp of baking powder
-add 1/4 cup sugar
-add 1 tsp vanilla.  

I also added 1.5 tsp of sugar to the whipped cream.

This was delicious, and people raved about it all night.  It was gone in about 7 minutes!  I will definitely be making this again!

the first time i made this recipe i screwed up and put in the 1/2 cup of sugar in with the dough instead of the tablespoonfull, but it turned out great anyways. i'm a college student and for a while i had no money for grocceries so i would bake one of these every second day, sometimes i would put in cinnamon or other spices, sometimes i would eat it with jam. and i never got sick of the recipe. i even have two sitting in my freezer right now insipte of the fact that i have grocceries.

Strawberry shortcake was requested as a birhtday dessert.  Everyone raved about the cake- it was very authentic.  I sampled a little bit of the cake, as I'm allergic to strawberries.  What I was able to taste from the few crumbs I could get, it was delicious!  I look forward to trying this with raspberries or some other fruit so I can enjoy it, too.

I thought that this was really good!  I cut down the baking powder to two tablespoons and didn't taste it at all.  I also used butter instead of shortening.  The cake did fall apart a little when i cut it (which is why it gets four stars instead of five) but it still tasted really good!

A M A Z I N G! This was so good. I made it for dessert after Easter dinner and it was great.  I read a lot of the reviews and did the following: reduced the baking powder to 2 teaspoons, increased the sugar to 4 tablespoons, added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  I made biscuits instead of the cake and served it with vanilla ice cream & whipped cream.  The shortcake was very dense so if you like something lighter this is not for you but it was for me. YUMMY!

What a fast, easy, and great tasting recipe!  It was a hit!  Instead of using a pan, I just dropped the batter into even portions on a cookie sheet and baked for 11 minutes.  To make the batter a bit sweeter, I added 1/2 cup of sugar and sprinkled the batter with splenda while on the cookie sheet.  It was amazing and I will always use this recipe!

After reading a few reviews I decided to modify the recipe by using only 2 1/2 tsps of baking powder.  

I also used 1/4 c. sugar instead of 2 tablespoons, butter instead of shortening (didn't have any shortening in the house) and lowfat buttermilk because I had some I wanted to use up.  I used just a pinch of salt.   The result was more like cake than like biscuit crust and was tender and moist.  It didn't rise enough and was too crumbly to easily cut in half, so I just topped it with the strawberries and whipped cream.  Adults and kids gave it a huge thumbs-up.  This one is definitely going to be a family favorite!

I plan to take it to a potluck in a couple of weeks by bringing the shortcake, the strawberries, and the whipped cream in separate containers and assembling them when I get there.

I know other reviewers said it was too much like a biscuit but that's how I've always had it and I prefer it to cake versions! I've always used Bisquick but thought I'd try scratch this time and I defintitely prefer scratch now.
The only things I would change is to make it a little sweeter the amount of baking powder. I did only 2 tsp per other reviews and that was plenty.
I also mashed my berries so as to have lots of juice for the biscuit to soak up. And I substituted almond extract for vanilla in the whipped cream and that gave it a little something extra. 
All in all a very yummy shortcake - no one here is complaining!

I was looking for a tender, pound cake-like cake. The description is misleading, and next time, I'll be sure to read the reviews before trying it.

I really liked making this recipe! It was quick and easy and by far the prettiest looking cake i've ever made. My advice is that you should cut the crusts off the baked cakes.

We didn't like this at all. Way to dry and taste like a cross between cardboard, nothing and baking powder. Turned out like shortbread, nothing "cake" about it.

Fantastic recipe, I did however substitute the shortening with butter (~1 1/2 cu.).  Also almost halved the baking powder.  Then baked it at a lower temp (around 400).  Needless to say it came out amazing.  I hesitated to use more butter, didn't need Paula showing up to my house.

A great result overall, but a bit of tweaking was needed.

1) reduce the baking powder to 3 teaspoons (some other reviews suggest reducing to 2),
2) I would definitely recommend making this at least 12 hours ahead or even the previous day. The strawberry juice and moisture from the whipped cream soak into the shortcake and it is improved, IMHO, at least ten fold!

For the impatient, not bad, but to my taste, a bit too dry.
3) personal taste again, but this recipe produces a pretty skimpy shortcake for 9. I would increase the amounts by 1/2
4) I added the grated rind of one lemon for a hint of zip. 

Enjoy!

Everything was good and edible. But I am looking for the cake part to be a little bit softer and sweeter. I also, want the cake part to be more neater. Meaning, not like a cutting a cake in half to make layers. Usually, recipes you get are not edible. But this tasted very good.

the shortcake was perfect! since the supply of strawberries is limited here, I used canned strawberry toppings instead of fresh strawberries, but still tasted good. this works really well with some scoops of vanilla ice cream. perfect!!!

These were just okay- a little dry.  Maybe its the egg or too much flour, I don't know.  I made individual biscuits and made sure I did not overbake (15 min.) 400 degrees.  There are other shortcake recipes I have liked better.

Personally I do not care for biscuit type shortcake but my husband loved it.  I sprayed mini buntcake pan and sprinkled with sugar, rolled small logs to just fit the the bottom of the pans. They rose slightly and looked great as individual shortcakes. The family love them for my husbands birthday.

I made this shortcake last night following all of "Luv to cook's" advice. This is another winner. I'm only giving it 4 stars because the reviewers suggestions is what made the shortcake. I made six bisquits. I just spooned it out onto a cookie sheet which I had sprayed with Pam. Didn't need to dust with flour. Wonderful recipe with the tweaks. Will make again and again.

I attemted this cake a while ago. I don't know if it was my measuring, or the fact that I followed it to a T, and used 4 tsp of baking powder, I don't know, but it was very, dry. It crumbled so much I couldn't even cut it in half. I will try it again, but be sure to measure carefully, and only 2 tsp. baking powder the MOST!

This recipe is incredible! I made it yesterday for a B-B-Q and the taste was just lovely. I made some slight changes as noted by other users (1/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp. of vanilla and almond extract) and the two extracts gave such a nice flavor to the shortcake. It wasn't too crumbly or anything. I'm definitely making this again soon!

I used 2 tsp baking pwd as recommended by other reviewers.  I added 1/3 cup hot chocolate mix to the biscuit to make a chocolate strawberry shortcake and it turned out great.  The better your strawberries the less sugar they need.  I used 1/4 cup sugar for the strawberries.

This cake didn't turn out too well.  And although I don't like giving out bad reviews-  I have to with this cake.  The cake turned out extremely dense and didn't taste good at all.  It was almost like a biscuit and unenjoyable.  Everyone wound up having strawberries and cream.  I wouldn't make this again.

This is as close as you can get to old-fashion shortcake without the extra work of rolling it out. I used a 8x8 baking dish instead of a 8" round. I also did not split it in half. Just cut the size piece you want, split it then and add the strawberries and the cool whip[ that's what I use instead of whipping cream] One more thing, I used 4 tbls of sugar in the batter and a little more milk,[maybe 2-3 tbls] & less salt. This all takes about 25 min. to bake.

This was sooooo good. Since I read the reviews first, I knew it was going to be a biscuit-y cake. It was heavenly! A thick, slightly sweet biscuit cake topped with sugared strawberries and homemade whipped cream (I like mine sweet, so I added sugar and vanilla) was amazing. I've never had "real" strawberry shortcake before.....and I'll never go back to the spongy packaged-cake kind. Delicious. I can't wait to serve it to friends and family!

This is the type of shortcake--real shortcake--that I love.  None of that store-bought spongey stuff!  I did a few things differently than the recipe calls for: 1)I made nine individual shortcakes by rolling out rough ball shapes and flattening them with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar, 2)I used 2 t. baking powder as suggested by some reviewers, and 3)I used Cool Whip instead of real whipped cream just to save time and calories (tastes good as long as you're not used to the real stuff!)  I also used butter flavored Crisco and 1% milk.  They turned out exactly as I hoped. I will definitely be making these again.  It's a keeper!

This is a very good, biscuit-like shortcake. I used Rumford baking powder and it tasted great. It came out fairly crumbly, so I didn't bother trying to split it. We cut it into wedges and served the berries and whipped cream over the top. I also sprinkled a little sugar over the top before baking and that gave it a nice, pretty crust.

I was quite disappointed by the results of this recipe. I thought that the cake part, which is really more of a biscuit, was simply too dry and very salty. My advice would be to reduce the amount of baking powder to maybe two teaspoons and eliminate the salt altogether. I knew this would be more biscuit-like when I was reading the recipe ingredients, since I have successfully made biscuits before, but this didn’t quite work for me.  It just tasted awful and seemed to be a waste of good strawberries and cream. Since strawberries are so expensive at this time of year, especially in Chicago, I’m glad I used just frozen strawberries and allowed them to thaw before applying to the cake. So in my honest and humble opinion, this is just too salty and dry, and not even strawberry juice or whipped cream stand a chance of helping it. Whether or not I’m making it again, only time will tell.

Not bad. A little dry, but so quick and easy, I'd definitely make it again in a pinch. Perhaps I will try mixing a little vanilla yogurt into the batter next time.

This recipe was so easy to make. I have made it several times now and will NEVER EVER make another shortcake recipe other than this one. This is the real old fashion recipe like Grandma used to make. I added about 1 more Tab. of shortening,(used butter flavor crisco) to make it a tad bit richer, either way it is perfect. Very tender and rich.  As another member stated--this is not like the pound cake,or angel food cake the store will try to tell you is shortcake. Just try it once, you will see the difference between "just shortcake" and SHORTCAKE!

If you are looking for the sponge cake, angel food cake, or pound cake knock-offs to strawberry shortcake, this recipe is NOT for you!  If, however, you are looking for a delicious version of a traditional shortcake, don't pass this up!  Unbelievably easy to put together (I did use only 3 tsp of baking powder as suggested) and received rave reviews from all my coworkers.  My boss even said it was just like the shortbread his mother used to make for him as a kid.

The shortcake was very dense....almost Bisquick-like. I was looking for more of a tender texture, and this was very heavy and on the dry side.  I'll keep looking for a perfect old fashioned shortcake recipe!

Overall, this recipe was pretty good. However, it was a little dry. I'd suggest adding more shortening or milk...something to add moisture. Add also follow the recipe on the whipping cream box to sweeten it up a bit (add sugar and vanilla). I fixed more whipping cream than was called for and spread it all over the shortcake. Everyone seemed to enjoy it at Easter. Thanks!

I "second" luv2cook's review! I cut dough into 8 pieces and rolled and shaped into biscuits with the confectioner sugar and they are fabulous!  Am I the only one to top my strawberry shortcakes with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream?

I tried the recipe yesterday, since we are only 2, an older couple and need to watch our starch and sugar intake, I cut the recipe in half for all the ingredients except the egg, since the dough was slightly wet, I added a touch of flour as I turned it into a ball. The secret is in not overworking the dough, very little kneading, shaped it in a rectangular shape and cut 6 pieces. Baked in 400 degrees oven and basted with a bit of butter on top. 
It turned out flaky and very light, absolutely delicious, the best I've had so far.

These were amazing! I followed directions exactly for the shortcake, and they came out great! I did, however, put the dough into ramekins for smaller (individual) portion sizes. I thought it would take less time in the oven because of their size, but they still took 20 minutes. At 15 mins, they (the larger ones) were still gooey in the center. The recipe made 2 large ramekins and 2 small ones. I only made enough strawberries for one serving (myself), I didnt measure the sugar but I eyeballed it to my liking, and I added a dab of vanilla, and used a potato masher to lightly squeeze the juices from the strawberries. It sat for the duration of the baking time, and all in all it was delicious!

This is a great recipe.  I agree with the others about reducing the baking powder to 2 tblsp.  I also added a tablespoon of cornstarch with the strawberries and sugar to thicken the juice a bit.  Delicious and easy!

The texture was very good but not sweet at all. With good cake and strawberries you should not need to put sugar on the berries. I did add the vanila and cinnamon as suggested and it helped some.

I made this strawberry shortcake with a 7-year-old and it turned out beautifully. He was able to do everything by himself (of course with a little bit of direction from me) and the shortcake turned out beautifully! There was a lot of great homestyle flavor in the shortcake itself, then the strawberries just added the summer tang. Great recipe, especially for making with kids!

Fantastic biscuit-style shortcake.  This was a huge hit with the whole family.  I made it exactly according to the recipe, except that I used unsalted butter instead of shortening.  It was delicious - no baking powder taste, and quite sweet enough with the berries and whipped cream.  This is definitely a keeper!

Made this for company last night...had an incredible wow factor when I brought it to the table!  I would definitely reduce the baking powder to 2 T. rather than 4 T...was a little bitter.  Also, the whipped cream needed some sugar and vanilla beat into it for additional flavor.  Incredibly easy and wonderful.

Here are some pro tips, straight out of MY hood: 1. This is best served right away, as everything tends to get slimy after too long. 2. I didn't have a pastry blender so I used a whisk and it worked OK. The whip't cream was OK but not as easy / cheap as Whipple Top or whatever the storebought brand is. Kind of hard to cut/serve.

Shortcake was delicious.  I did substitute 1 cup of wheat flour in and used 10 oz of evaporated milk so it was not so dry.  Great tasting and holds up well!

I added a little extra sugar (I like mine sweet!) and left everything else the same. YUM! Turned out PERFECT for my Mom's birthday! Note to everyone else saying its like a biscuit, dry, and crumbly: Its SUPPOSED to be like that!! It soaks up the strawberry juice better.

Fantastic!  I actually dosed it to an ice cream scoop and made mini "strawberry burgers" as we called them.  Soo good.  If you make your own whip cream it's highly recommended that you add some strawberry extract to it (from real strawberries of course) and use that.  Super delicious!

Thank you Rebecca for the info on aluminum in baking powder. I wasn't aware of it before. I'm sure it makes a huge difference. This recipe is so much like what my mom always prepared except that she always made individual sized cakes rather than one large one. Either way it's delicious.

One of the best recipes for Shortcake I have used! I added a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 cup fine sugar to whipping cream as I made it. This was a wonderful touch! My mom loved it as I made this mothers day dinner!

From this recipe I made the shortcake, very good! I didn't change anything and they turned out wonderfully. The second time I made them I thought they could use a bit more sugar, so I added another tbsp (we like to eat them on their own too!). I also made hockey puck sized individual shortcakes instead of a whole one, they take about the same time in the oven and I ended up with about 8 using this recipe. Thanks!

Absolutely  Delicious!!!!
everyone was saying to cut the b/p in half, and then someone said not too...so i used 3 tsp instead of 4 or 2! turned out great!! my oven bakes HOT and FAST. so i put it on 350 degrees for about 22 minutes, turned out perfect! and i had to use dream whip instead of real whipped cream, but it turned out great anyways, will make this again!! thanks so much for the recipe!

Very good recipe.  I used half the baking powder and doubled the sugar as suggested by others.  My only other change was that I added some Amaretto to the strawberrys.

I was a little (lot?) disappointed in this recipe.  It looked great and had a wonderful texture but did not have enough flavor and was NOT SWEET ENOUGH for my taste.  Next time, I'll add some vanilla and a little sugar.

I just made this recipe and served it to my inlaws as a special birthday request. I have never made a strawberry shortcake before, and was really impressed by how easy this recipe is. The results were awesome, and although we didnt have room, we devoured this light but heavenly dessert between only five of us. Mom-in-law says thanks! Oh, something to keep in mind; I was worried about making this, it not being strawberry season, but letting the strawberries sit in the sugar seemed to ripen them up beautifully...

AN easy to make recipe that reminds that is similar to the shortcake grandma made. I cut the baking soda in half and added a very high quality vanilla. I used real butter for the shortening. Very pleased !!

I have made this recipe a dozen times! It is easy and loved by all. I lowered the baking powder as one suggested and preferred the biscuit type to sponge-cake. This has become a family and friend favorite. Thanks for sharing.

My family loves this recipe.I read other comments and expected it to be very dry, so I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and reduced the baking powder to 2 tsp as suggested by others.
 
I substituted 1/2 cup sugar with 1/3 cup of splenda baking sugar in the strawberries, but I didn't substitute the sugar in the cake. 

Second time I made this recipe I only had Butter flavored Vegetable shortening on hand. I used this and the cake came out moist but heavier. The bottom of cake was crispy almost deep fried texture but the middle was heavier but moist. 

Both times making this recipe my family loved it. Some liked the regular shortening better, some liked the butter shortening.

My husband and I are stationed in the UK.  My British friends asked me to make them a strawberry shortcake because it is something they have seen on tv and wanted to know what it was.  I followed the recipe exactly and boy did they "flip".  Now that is all they request for me to make...thank you

I actually liked the biscuit-like texture as it reminded me of my mom's shortcake.  However, the overwhelming baking powder aftertaste was not too palate-pleasing.

Great recipe.  Might want to consider makeing some kind of liquid strawberry syrup to pour on top or on top of each serving so that it won't be too dry, if not, have an extra can of whipped cream on hand.

This was really good, however I will cook a little longer next time as the middle was still a little doughy and maybe try to make individual sized short cakes.

Excellent shortcake. Not as "crumbly" as old-fashioned shortcake, but I enjoyed the texture and the flavor. For some reason, mine collapsed in the center while cooling, but that did not affect the taste or texture. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

I made this EXACTLY as the recipe states, and the dough turned out like bread dough.....having never made it, I thought hmmm...maybe shortcake should be like this? I pressed it into the pan, and baked it. It came out looking like a big tea biscuit!! and tasted like flour. Gross. Researching some other recipes online afterwards, I realized that this recipe FORGOT to list that there is heavy cream IN the batter, as well as heavy cream for the topping. I have no idea how much you would want to add to this batter, but I definitely know that if you make this recipe this way, it will flop.

I added sugar and reduced the baking powder, and it was soooo good. Wondering if I could make it a day ahead. Would the shortcake dry out do you think?

This was made for my father-in-laws birthday.  Very yummy but must be eaten right away or it becomes to soggy for our liking.

Excellent shortcake that melts in your mouth. I used 5TB of butter because I was out of shortening. Still turned out great!

With the exception of (as others mentioned) a terribly strong baking powder taste (and I only used 3 tsp), these were fantastic.  Next time, scale bp down to 2 tsp or use alum free stuff.  I had no problem whatsoever with excessive crumbing - mine were pretty much perfect.  I used mini 4" cake pans (with a little over 90g dough in each pan) for 12 minutes.  Came out with 6 lovely cakes.  Which we devoured.  Thanks so much for recipe!  Oh - note to self:  these really are just like biscuits (would make a nice basic recipe).  If making again, either add a tad more sugar and/or sprinkle some sugar on top before baking.  If I want to.  Because they really were just fine as is.

Great blueprint for strawberry shortcake! I used a gluten free flour and sub'd shortening with coconut oil. Also added about 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Wonderful texture and flavor!

Made this with all the same ingredients and measurements, despite all the alterations I saw in the reviews, but to combat the dryness of the cake, I divided the batch of strawberries in half, mashed one half so that it would be juicier, and used this to cover the bottom layer. Then I used the other un-mashed half of the strawberries for the top half of the cake. I didn't want to mash that part so as not to ruin the look of the cake. It came out great! Giving it four stars though because I think the instructions for this recipe could be better.

Absolutely loved this! Replaced shortening with butter (Earth Balance) and only used 2  tsp baking powder and it turned out perfect! Also used only brown sugar to sweeten strawberries and cake. This cake was gone in a matter of minutes :).

This recipe tasted amazing!
Everyone loved it
the only thing was that when i put the whip cream on a few mins later it started to melt like all whip cream does.
So the cake was amazing but a bit messy must be quicker next time.

I didn't change the recipe at all and it came out quite good but a bit hard and crumbly like I've heard from other reviews. Next time I will alternate the recipe to what others have suggested.

I followed the luv to cook version and doubled the recipe. the first pan came out beautiful but once I had handled the dough for the second pan my body heat had started to melt the butter and the batte became very sticky. this pan spread out too much. I think I will throw it in the refrigerator for 10 -15 minutes next time before I bake it. Delicious!!

I liked the texture and flavor of the shortcake. I stuck with the shortening, but only used 2tsp. of baking powder and increased the sugar to 1/4c. as others suggested. I divided the dough into 8 mini shortcakes instead of 1 big one. Next time I will cram them into a 9" cake pan so they can rise against each other and the sides of the pan. Hopefully that will give them a little more loft.

I made this after reading the hints/tips from other commenters.  I was really looking for the "cake" part of the strawberry shortcake to go with my frozen strawberries, ice cream and cool whip.  This recipe looked good and it was.  While I don't know exactly what the original would have been like, I decided to take the advice of others to decrease the amount of baking powder (2 tsp instead of 4 tsp) and I doubled the sugar in the cake/biscuit part.  I made individual biscuits in a 9x9 pan, baked for 15 minutes.  After they cooled for 5 minutes I layered half the biscuit, frozen sweetened strawberries, cool whip, vanilla ice cream, and strawberries.  I had forgotten to add the other half biscuit so I broke it up and put it around the side of the bowl.  These were delicious.  I worry about how they would have tasted with the original recipe so I only gave it 4 stars.

The cake came out great. I made it for the little girl I'm babysitting and she absolutely loved it. She ate a almost half of it herself. I did it exactly as the original recipe directed. I might change add a little bit of my own touch in there next time i made it. But overall great.

Delicious!  You can substitute butter for shortening and cut the baking POWDER in half to 2 tsp.  I am guessing that this recipe is for what is commonly called "soda biscuits" for making strawberry shortcake, and would taste better if you used 4 tsp of baking soda, which is 1/2 as strong as 'double acting' baking powder.  Using baking soda will give this a slightly different flavor.  Although making it as a cake is a great idea, I made 8 biscuits, my wife and I ate one each and froze the others in a ziplock bag for dessert on another day.

I found it not soft enough to spread in the pan so I added more milk. It was bitter when I served it. Too much baking powder? I threw it out this morning....

What I learned from this recipe is that I cannot bake  :) It tasted good, but the cake was hard like a rock.  Apparently I don't know when to stop mixing! I doubt I'll make it again.

I followed this to the tee, and what came out was more like soda bread than shortcake.  I believe this recipe calls for way too much baking soda.

I made this this weekend and they came out great.  I took some of the suggestions and substituted butter for shortening and decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup and the baking powder to 2 tspns.  It was delicious.

The end result is delicious.  Getting there is a little tricky.  I've made this two or three times, and each time the shortcake seems to be really dry.  I may make this recipe x 1.5 next time so the cake is easier to split into two layers.  It tastes great though!  Once everything is layered, the combination of the not-so-sweet cake, with the tart & sweet berries and the creamy whipped cream is DELICIOUS!

This recipe is great! I need recipes that are flexible with limited ingredients, and this one was great. I did increase the sugar, but I don't have measuring spoons, so everything is a little bit of a guess. Finally, I didn't have ice cream or whipped cream, so I used plain yogurt sweetened with honey. Turned out great!

Fan-flipping-tastic!!  I followed the advice of many others and did only 2 tbsp baking powder and increased the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I mixed the white sugar with brown sugar (half parts) and substituted 1/2 cup butter for the shortening.  Also added a dab of cinnamon and vanilla to the mixture and then topped it with both vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream.  YUM YUM YUM.  Having leftovers for breakfast!!!

My mom passed away 3 years ago and I have been searching for a strawberry shortcake recipe like hers.  This is it. Thank you for bringing it back to my family. We like the heavier type shortcake rather than the "cake" like.

Made this for Mother's Day and my Mom's Birthday.  Strawberry Shortcake is her favorite dessert.  I doubled the recipe as I was having 20 people over and used two round cake pans.  Didn't change anything but the cake tasted a little off and I couldnt figure out what it was, it was a bit sour not quite sweet enough.  I made sure the berries were plenty sweet along with the homemade whipping cream so that it would take away from the tartness.  I also just cut the cakes into pie type slices and put in bows and had everyone top their own as to what they wanted and how much.  Most people said it was good but nobody raved or asked for the recipe or even where i got it from so I didn't take that as a huge success.  Next time I'll try another from this site and see what happens.

Awesome!!! I made it with strawberries, blueberries, and black berries. It would look very pretty at a 4th of July party. It tasted great. No more grocery store shortcakes for me! Thanks for sharing this new summertime staple at my house.

I was quite skeptical when I saw the dough. It was hardly spreading and it only looked worse while baking. However, in the end, when you put the whole cake together - it's just wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly.

I've never made shortcake before, but this seems really good to me.  I used the alterations as recomended, since it sounded more kid friendly that way.  Its quite good- even my 3 year old loved it.  This morning I had some of the shortcake with honey and leftover whipped cream.  It was too sweet, but I can tell it would be lovely with the original recipe (or maybe if I hadn't sweetened the cream).  Worth trying if you find yourself with leftovers.

This was good, but I perfer my shortcake a little sweeter, so next time I may add more sugar. 
This was so simple to mix together and quick to prepare, I will be making this again!

Was very pleased with this recipe.  The biscuits were perfect for my taste because I have always preferred them to the actual sweeter shortcake versions.  Next time will try using just 2 tsp of baking powder instead of 4.  Otherwise I loved it!  Thanks!

This was good, but not quite as good as Cracker Barrel's, which is my all-time favorite (if anyone has this recipe, please share it with me :).  It was pretty close though,  I loved that it was cake-like.  I did make a few changes based on others' comments.  I used about 4 T sugar into the batter.  I used 1/2 cup butter in place of shortening.  I also made it in an 8 X 8 pan so I could make individual servings by cutting each square piece in half to put the toppings in the middle.  For the whip cream I added in some powdered sugar.  I served it warm with ice cream, strawberries & whip cream on top.

This came out absolutely perfect.  It wasn't too dry or too moist.  Perfect for my taste.  I also used 1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening, 2tsp. of baking powder and 1/4 cup of sugar for the shortcake mix.  I did use 2 pounds of strawberries and would have used more.  I like it to have alot.  Also, more whip cream would have been good too.

not quite a 5 star but pretty darn close. This is a biscuit recipe so it's supposed to be a bit dry to soak up the juices. THE REAL KIND OF STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE!!

It was good, not fantastic.  Cake needed to be a tad bit sweeter; also I wasn't expecting it to be so heavy - like a biscuit.  Reduce the baking powder in half, and add a tablespoon extra sugar.  For what I got, it wasn't bad.

I served this for a 71 yr birthday.  The guest of honor said it was just the way his mother used to make it!  Everyone ate every last crumb.  I made suggested modifications (decreased baking powder to 2 tsp and used Rumford brand, increased the sugar in the mix to 1/4 c, added 1 tsp real vanilla, and used closer to 1/2 c real butter instead of 1/3 c shortening).  I also sliced into individual wedges while still warm, sliced these in half and put pats of butter on, returned to the pan and covered with foil in a warm oven till serving time.  Yummy!

Good recipe, but I'd have to make many adjustments when I make it again. Next time, I will add some vanilla or more sugar to the cake batter. I didn't halve the amount of baking powder, but will do so next time. I think I could have used about another cup of whipped cream. Also, I omitted the sugar (in which to toss the berries) and they turned out fine.

Wow!  This was so good! My dau is having a Strawberry Shortcake party for her birthday but this made a wonderful dessert for her actual birthday!  I did decrease the baking powder to 2 t , sub butter for shortening and added @ a T of extra sugar to the dough.  I formed it into about 6 individual cakes.

I defaulted to this recipe since I did not have the right ingredients for a "sponge" cake strawberry shortcake recipe.  I wasn't horribly disappointed but neither impressed with it either.  I think maybe because of the "biscuit" type cake.

I made this for my boss for her birthday and I am only giving it 5 stars because everyone really liked it; but it did not rise at all! I expected it to be much more full and it stayed very flat. Everyone liked it and said it was really good, but I am going to try again and see if it will rise.

This didn't turn out so good for me,maybe since I used the whole wheat flour instead. Like the previous member I found it a bit doughy still and need to bake it longer.

I added sugar and vanilla to the "cake" and it was still bland and had a weird consistency, like a biscuit. If that's how old-fashioned strawberry shortcake is supposed to taste, then i don't like old-fashioned at all.

Yummmm... but I only give it a 4 because I added an extra 2T of sugar to the batter, and an extra 4T of milk. I also made it in an 8 by 8 dish and just sliced it thin and topped with the strawberries and whipped cream (I took 2 cups heavy whipping cream and beat it with 1/4 cup sugar).  Got raves. Much better than storebought.

This recipe was OK but, I felt like something was missing so, I asked my mother how she made hers. It's almost the same except she always cuts it in half while it's still very hot and slathers all sides with butter and lets it melt then she sprinkles it with sugar. It makes all the difference in the world.

This recipe was excellent! I used 4T sugar, as suggested, and frozen strawberries b/c they are a lot cheaper and always available. I also sifted the baking powder to ensure there weren't any bitter spots in the cake.

This turned out fairly well, just wish the cake part was not so crumbly. The only thing I changed was that I used 4 tbls white sugar instead of just 2, which gave it just the right sweetness for my taste. Anyhow, everyone at the party loved it. It is definitely worth making again. However, I will experiment with ways to make it not so crumbly. Thanks!

This recipe turned out perfect. I bought strawberries from a farm (much sweeter) and not the supermarket so I think that made a big difference in taste.  I added a couple extra tablespoons of sugar to the dough and only half the baking powder that was required.  Everybody loved it; my mother in law (the dessert baking queen) had two pieces. I don’t think I ever saw her eat two pieces of any desert she loved it.  It was a hit!!! This was a great simple recipe.

Same consistency as my mom's, very moist; however, the flavor was lacking. It was somewhat bland, even with berries, sauce, and whipped cream.

This was pretty tasty. My only complaint was the "shortcake" was a little crumbly, but that was probably my fault; I dropped 6 mounds of dough on a cookie sheet and baked them that way so I'd have individual servings. Even though they did fall apart a bit once they were cut, they still tasted very good. I'd make this again. Thanks!

This recipe taste good--though I also did some changes to it. I added some extra sugar cause I think it was a bit tasteless the first time I did it. Then, I also add a wee bit more of shortening and some cornmeal. It turned out great! Plus, it even tasted like cornmeal muffins~ yummy~ and oh yeah, I did loose some of the baking powder. Perfect!

This is good!!  The biscuit part is very flavorful and easy.  A few changes I made--I liked sweetened whipped cream, so I did add sugar.  I used frozen, sweetened strawberries.  Also, for presentation, I used heart shaped cookie cutters after I baked and split the cake for a great presentation.

EZ and really good.  The first time I made this was for a bridal shower, as the main dessert.  It went within minutes-all to women who were "stuffed", there was not a drop left.  I put it together at the shower, it looked lovely. I think you have to be careful of crumbling when you cut it.  It reminded me of the Betty Crocker recipe from a long time ago.  I loved it.

This was OK.  The taste was nice but not out of this world.  I found the top layer was a little dry so I poured some of the strawberry juice over the inside of top layer before I placed it on top of the bottom.  That helped with the dryness but then the cake wanted to fall apart, which the cake was craking even without the juice.  It was good but I would not recommend taking this one anywhere, mine did not travel well.  It ended up looking more like a strawberry volcano.  Everyone liked it, or they were just being nice because over half was eaten, but then again how can you go wrong with strawberry, sugar and cream!?  I don't think I will try this one again simply because it was too much work, it was really messy and it was just OK tasting.

This turned out very tasty.  The cake is not very sweet, but is perfect for the sweeter berries.  I made one little change and added a couple splashes of Grand Marnier to my strawberries.

Great dense cake, great crumb IMO.
As others, I reduced the baking powder and increased the sugar in the cake. I did something that wasn't mentioned, I made two cakes instead of cutting one in half and layering. And also pouring the leftover strawberry syrup on the bottom layer of the cake.

I loved it! i made it in honor of Melanie Martinez while singing Strawberry Shortcake.  I was a little concerned when it smelled like a biscuit, but after it cooled, It was amazing. 
10/10 would bake again.

Awesome, everyone loved it! It baked to a beautiful golden color! I added lemon zest on top for garnish. It was light but dense enough to soak up all that strawberry juice, delicious!

Great recipe!  I loved the moist texture.  The only thing I would change is it could be sweeter and I had to bake it about 10 min longer.  Otherwise - it was exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you!

Made it today for after dinner and everyone loved the shortcake. It was quick and easy to make. The only change was to bake in a square pan and cut into 8 pieces. Can't wait to make again.

Wonderful! I don't need to try any more shortcake recipes; this one is easy quick and delicious.
I accidentally  put the 1/2 C sugar in the mix instead of in the strawberries, and it was still good! Read more carefully than I did - only 2 TBSPS!

This is a great shortcake! I used 1 tablespoon of baking powder (which is 3 teaspoons) because I live in a higher altitude and I did use 3 tablespoons of sugar but other than that I followed the recipe and it came out perfect. Also, I used an 8 inch square glass pan instead of round. This shortcake tastes wonderful and the texture was not dense and dry like some shortcakes but light and just right! I will make this shortcake over and over!

As written, this recipe is a bit dry and bland.  I added an additional egg, well beaten and a teaspoon of vanilla.  We prefer these changes to the recipe.

I made the following modifications:just a few tsp of sugar with the strawberries to start. I added 1/4 cup of sugar to the batter as many other bakers did, as well as reduced the baking powder to 2 tsp. I also used butter instead of shortening - the shortening honestly did not taste good to me and since it has more fat than butter - why not use butter?!  It's almost impossible to cut the cake in half with the recipe as written so I split the batter and put them in two dishes. 

I also added a few tsp of sugar to the cream. (Hey - if you aren't adding sugar to the strawberries you can add it elsewhere =) 

Overall a decent recipe but required a lot of modifications to get it to where I wanted.

This shortcake turned out just like the shortcake my 93yr old Grandma Peacock made. I was thrilled to find a recipe that replicated the taste of hers. The only change I made was to add a couple more tablespoons of sugar to the cake. It was fabulous!!! The entire family raved about it. I've actually made it three times already this strawberry season. I will definitely keep the recipe and make it every time strawberries are on. My Grandma would be so proud.

I used the suggestions of adding one tsp vanilla and 1/4 cup sugar, as well as using 1/2 cup butter rather than shortening and it was still bad! The batter was too heavy and dry. It also cooked on the outside much faster than the inside, partly because I imagine there was still too much baking powder (I used 3 rather than 4tsp and it still rose a lot!). The batter was too heavy and dry. I would not make this recipe again.

I like the old-fashioned crumbly texture, but mine came out too dry. I think I will use half butter/half shortening next time and remove it from the oven when it is just barely golden.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this for Father's Day dessert and it was absolutely delicious. Before I started I read through some of the reviews and followed the  revisions that luv2cook shared and I'm glad I did. The shortcake was a good texture, like scones with a slight sweetness on the outside. This was the first time I've made shortcake from scratch and they are so worth the effort. This'll is a keeper.

I made it exactly like the recipe, but before throwing it in the oven I read so many adaptations for the sugar, so I mixed in a little more. I was expecting a cake consistency, but this was more like a scone/biscuit texture and I wasn't a big fan of it. I know a lot of people like it, but I wasn't one of them. Thanks anyway for the recipe!

It tasted great. But I don’t suggest throwing the strawberries in sugar, if your using a sweet whipped cream such as cool whip. Also I would put a bowl of extra strawberries and a bowl of extra whipped cream on the side for anyone who wants more of either of these. It’s great fora picnic or Mother’s Day, or a Birthday for that matter.

There aren't any changes i would make for this recipe. Though, I do suggest using aluminum free baking powder so you don't have that after taste. I would make this again.

My husband and I gave this an A+.  It is a great hybrid of a biscuit and a  pound cake.  I made it with the 1/2 c. butter as suggested.  I did need a little more milk to get the drop biscuit consistency necessary to smooth it into an 8x8 dish.  I cut it into squares and then split the squares for filling with strawberries.  The second time I made it I added some whipped cream to the top of the strawberries before adding the top and more whipped cream.  Not too sweet, not heavy...just right.  Close to the best we've had.

I'm rating this recipe as it is written. It's inedible, with an overwhelming bitter taste. Once you drop the amount of baking soda and increase the sugar, it tastes okay. But that isn't how the recipe is written, so 1 star it is.

I followed the recipe as given, and it turned out just great! Since the type of “shortening“ was not specified, I did use butter, which was quickly mixed in using my food processor. To avoid the off-taste created by the aluminum content in most baking powder, I used Rumford baking powder.

This recipe was easy to make and came out looking  just like the picture. The problem is it was very dry and ,in my opinion, not sweet enough. If I were to make it again . well I will not be making It again.

For what this recipe is designed to be this recipe delivered. This recipe is not designed to be the sweet and light angel food cake that some users may be used to having as strawberry shortcake. For me I was looking for a way to use up some strawberries  and make an attractive dessert for some guests. Growing up my grandmother always made buttermilk shortcake biscuits that we would place strawberries over. I wanted something a little prettier so I decided to make a trifle but found that all the trifle recipes on here call for angel food cake (which I've never been a fan of). I decided to use this recipe to make up the layers that would be angel food. I modified the recipe by using bread flour, stevia instead of sugar, 1/6 cup of unsweetened applesauce and 1/6 cup of butter in place of the shortening, almond milk, and 1 tsp vanilla. To make the trifle I made layers of shortbread, light Greek vanilla yogurt, and strawberries and left refrigerated overnight. I love the flavor of this shortcake. It's more scone like and milder than the buttermilk ones I grew up on.  Yes it is dry but it is made to be. This should be your base that derives its flavor and moisture from its toppings.

This is a wonderful TRADITIONAL shortcake recipe. Not the sweet spongy version you buy at the store. It's very closely related to shortbread. So it is bland by comparison. But if it is the height of strawberry season and you live in a strawberry growing area this makes the best backdrop to those wonderful berries. The recipe was accurate and I tasted no baking powder after effect a lot of folks complained about. They rose perfectly and were flaky and had less ingredients than other shortbread  recipes.

I should have read the reviews first. When I mixed it all together, it was dry, not batter. I added another egg and then milk until it was closer to batter. I also added vanilla, because I knew this was going to taste bland. I basically made cornbread. It is super crumbly. I tried it with strawberries and whipped cream. After a few bites, I couldn't eat anymore of the cake part. Too much flour and baking powder flavor.

I would try again with the adjustments recommended by others here, but I don't see how it would not just be dry instead of batter again. I am going to search for a better recipe.

I made this in hopes I'd love making strawberry shortcake with a biscuit / scone instead of cake which I prefer. I used half butter and coconut oil in place of shortening. I used 1/4 teaspoon ground vanilla bean for extra flavor after reading reviews that this shortcake was bland tasting. Smelled terrific baking and I layered strawberries and real whipped cream. My husband liked it,I thought it was just okay. I prefer an actual cake,as opposed to a biscuit / scone type of shortcake. If you like a biscuit texture,tasting stawberry shortcake then this is the shortcake recipe for you.

This recipe was wonderful and so fun!  We followed it just as the other reviews that said to reduce the powder.  But, next time I would just follow it as written to see what difference it makes.  It was a centerpiece to our dinner table and a real showstopper!  People have known about small shortcakes as a common dessert, but having it be one BIG shortcake was so cool!!  Cake was perfect and directions were great!

DTD 3/20/2017....I really like this recipe just as is!  The dough was like a cookie dough and I used a tart pan with a removable bottom.  I greased the pan and then patted the dough into the pan.  It didn't raise much so don't be worried about it filling the pan to just about to the top.  The compliment of the sweetened strawberries and whipped cream with the very low content of sugar in the shortcake was a game changer for me!  Loved it!

I followed some other reviewers advice and increased the sugar to 1/4 cup and decreased the baking powder to 2 teaspoons. I also just used fresh strawberries without adding sugar to them. It turned out great - a lighter, not too sweet dessert that tasted very fresh. Make it for my husband's birthday and he loved it. I added some whipped cream in the strawberry layer and then frosted the whole thing with the whipped cream as well to create a more cake like look and to decorate.

It was probably my fault, but the cake was dry and tasteless. I probably overcooked it. It looked done at 12 minutes but was not very brown, so I left it in the full 15. Big mistake! Still, with the juicy berries and whipped cream, it did the job and was not soggy. 
I also made the same modifications as others, substituting  1/2 c. butter for shortening, reducing baking powder to 2 t. and increasing sugar to 1/4 c. It was still not very sweet, which was fine.
I added a few drops of a very intensely flavored aged balsamic vinegar to the berries shortly before serving. It was the consistency of a syrup. They were "over the top" great!!

I wish I would have read the reviews before I made this. I followed the recipe TO A TEE and it was AWFUL. It didn't resembled any strawberry shortcake I've ever seen before. It crumbled and was messy.

I followed the recipe except used butter instead of shortening, as I always do.  It was delicious. My husband loved it. I would definitely make it again and it  would be a perfect dessert to bring to a party. 

I used the 4 teaspoons of baking powder as directed and it was fine. I always buy Rumford  Aluminum-Free baking powder so I had it on hand. 

Enjoy!

This is the best shortcake. It is so flavorful and not dry, even after four days. I made it for friends and they liked it too. I did use butter flavor crisco because that was all I had.

This turned out very well and I will definitely make this recipe again. The only thing that should be changed, is the biscuit. If a small amount of vanilla extract, and some butter were added, it would make the biscuit much better. Overall, this is a pretty good strawberry shortcake recipe.

This was... okay. When added with the strawberries and whipped cream, it was delicious, but by itself it was... bland. My cake did not rise AT ALL. I know that it isn't supposed to, but I used a square cake pan because I did not have a circle one on hand, and you could see the holes down to the bottom of the pan. When I took it out it was far too thin to cut in half so I had to omit that step. I would make it again with some changes. All in all, it was okay.

I made this tonight with whole wheat flour and some homemade whipped cream (always better and better for you than store-bought); also added some kiwi with the strawberries in the fruit topping. It turned out great and served 8 people quite well for a light and delicious dessert! I highly recommend to any looking for a nice fruity treat.

These are so easy and make a perfect amount. I used 3 teaspoons of powder and 1/2 cup butter instead of shortening. Perfect for all those summer strawberries!

This was the strawberry shortcake I made for my family on fathers day. It was not a success, my family agreed that it was all very needing of sugar. The shortcake itself was delicious but the rest did not compliment its taste. The heavy whipping cream also needed added sugar to it. I would not make this again.

I thought this recipe was fantastic!  The shortbread, I did with butter, but I'm betting that shortening would be just fine.  I made it to the letter, with one exception - I didn't add the softened butter to the layer of cake.  Next time the only change is I would cut down the sugar to the strawberries to half.  That's the only change I'd make.  GREAT recipe - love the shortcake - so easy and super yummy.  Thanks for posting!

Also you might want to try reducing the amount of baking powder.

In my ignorance, I expected this cake to be like the little round, yellow cakes sold in the groceries near me (in California in strawberry season.  I was wrong. This recipe makes a sweet cake like a biscuit. I'm not saying that's a bad thing. It's probably more authentic than what I am used to. But just be aware that's what you are making.

Strawberry season here, near Plant City Florida.  I love shortcake made with old fashioned shortcake (basically a biscuit with extra sugar added).  I increased the shortening and added more sugar. I could eat the dough raw! Did my own thing with the berries (I boil some in sugar and use about triple the amount boiled strawberries fresh with confectioners and balsamic vinegar.  I prefer to make the shortcake with cold butter but am out of it.  I do not feel the recipe is perfect due to needing more fat and sugar in it.

I made this last night and it is excellent. After reading the reviews, I adjusted the baking powder to 3 tsp and added a bit more shortening plus a dash of vanilla. And while I used 2/3 cup of whole milk, I also added an additional 1/4 cup of cream for added richness. I baked this in a 7X7 square pan for 25 min. The result was a puffed, golden brown shortcake with a rich, slightly sweet flavor. The texture was a poundcake/biscuit hybrid - the perfect base for strawberry shortcake. The shortcake is so good I'm going to have it toasted with butter and a cup of coffee in just a few minutes. Can't wait!

After readingbthe reviews, I also went ahead and added a bit more shortenning, I did keep with the 4 tsp on baking powder and it was perfect, our baking powder "Magic Powder" doesn't contain aliminum.  I had in  my freezer frozen sliced strawberries, so I used them.  This recipe is realy good, it's not too sweet, and just perfect for a nice summertime dessert.  I will make this again.

This recipe is great!! I was so nervous because not only was I making it without prior testing, I made it for a group of family members, but serious critics :-) The cake isn't sweet when cooked but I'm told it's not supposed to be.  It was a hit; nearly everyone came back for second or thirds!! I followed some of the changes other commenters suggested and assembled each serving using one layer with a few teaspoons of strawberry juice drizzled over a cake square before adding strawberries and whipped cream.  Sorry no pictures (for right now), they rushed into the kitchen before I was done assembling them!

Excellent!  I loved the way the shortcake turned out; not so dry, allowing it to absorb the juice from the strawberries.  Yum!

To be honest, after fallowing the recipe to the teeth, and baked the cake-i go in for the taste... Lets just say, had I eaten it, i would probably be in the ER right now,,Too salty, too much baking soda, it smelled like pure egg and baking soda, completly unetable.  I had been looking forward to this all day, and what a dissapointment... Deffinetly never again...

This is a nice biscuit-like shortcake recipe.  That is how I prefer my shortcake, but the previous recipe I had used took 1 c of butter - which is a bit much for me.  So, I used 1/2 c butter instead of the shortening (I don't usually add fats; in fact I generally cut back on what a recipe says but this is biscuits.)  I used 3 T demera sugar instead of the white sugar - I think demera adds a nice crunch.  I also added about 3/4 tsp cream of tartar - I think it really enhances the flavor of the biscuit.  My baking powder is rumford - so no tinny taste - so I used the full 4 tsp.  I finished mixing by kneading a couple strokes on floured surface, then patted the dough out and cut circles with a biscuit cutter.  Baked for 10 at 425.  I do not sugar my strawberries, but I do add some to my cream, although we ate these with icecream instead.  They were perfect!  Dense and soft and flaky!  I will be using this as my strawberry shortcake recipe from now on.

Everyone needs to know that I do not consider myself an expert at all. So I followed the recipe carefully. I have found the batter being tooooo dry, and I added extra milk. I think I added tooooo much milk, because after "cooking" it. The inside did not cook at all, and the outside came out to hard that you can not even cut through. I wish this recipe describe how the batter should be before putting it in the pan. To me it came out an disaster.

This was an easy recipe to do.  In fact, I had my daughter help me.  I did mess it up, but I liked it like that...I added all the sugar to the dough.  Why did I rate it a four?  I was hoping it wasn't like a biscuit recipe, and it was.  Otherwise, quick easy, and tastey.

I love this recipe! I've made it a couple times now. The shortcake is fantastic. It is not super sweet, it is moist inside, but crumbly like a biscuit. It gets PLENTY of liquid and sweet from the strawberries and whipped cream. A family favorite!

I also changed some of the measurments using luv2cook's suggestions of less baking powder, more sugar, butter instead of shortening and vanilla. However i measured the butter wrong and put less than she recommended so the cake was dry. It didnt seem to have much flavor on its own but with all the strawberries and juice that wasnt an issue. Im not sure if id make this again. It was easy and quick just not exactly what i was expecting.

This was a great, old-fashioned shortcake and a big hit at my BBQ last night!  I did follow the suggestions of others by reducing the baking soda to 2 tsp & used butter i/o shortening...thanks for the suggestions!

Afer reading reviews I too reduce the baking powder to 2 tsps. - which is ample. Also, for more flavor and a slightly moisture texture I use all butter. Should be eaten fresh and really soaks up the wonderful juice from the berries.   Also works well with raspberries or blueberries.

Cake was dense & dry. Made the 10 serving, 9"pan. Had to add 2 more tablespoons milk. Would be better in small molded shortcake nests(NordicWare mold pan). The cake will still be dry no matter what. At least the cake doesn't get soggy. I'll make it again, but will look for a better recipe. (Husband liked it though)

I don't know if it was the 4 tsp of baking powder but it came out looking like a big biscuit and it turned to dough when you ate it. Won't be using this one again.

This recipe was AMAZING! Two of my coworkers came over for dinner and were so wowed with the presentation that she took a picture of it! I also used only tsp. baking powder. For the whipped cream I added 3 tablespoons of confectioners sugar and a tsp. of vanilla. My friends couldn't wait and began eating it from the bowl!!! FANTASTIC!

I made individual shortcakes and cut the baking powder in half like many of the others. I also added some sugar to the recipe just to sweeten it up a bit. These can be made with a whole wheat/white flour mixture as well and they still taste yummy!

I don't know what went wrong with this cake. I followed it as best I could (more precise instructions would've helped!) and it came out looking dreadful. It's all slopped together, the cake part is way too crumbly and absolutely fell apart when I had to cut it in half. I tried to salvage it, but it honestly looks like a two-year old made it. It may taste fine, but I can't serve this to my sister-in-law for her birthday. I'll have to buy something at the store for her instead of this.

I tagged it at five, because I made it with Cool Whip. . .and I will never, ever use Cool Whip for strawberry shortcake again! It would have been MUCH better with real whipped cream, and since that is what you call for in the recipe. . . This was really good!

This was too dry for my taste, and I usually like the old fashioned shortcake best.  I made this for a large group and it was barely touched.
