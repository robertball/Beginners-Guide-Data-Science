Snickerdoodles are my favorite cookie! When I saw this recipe that used whole wheat flour, I knew I had to try it. The dough was very easy to handle and hardly any difference (from the original)in the cooking time. My whole family loved these cookies! The whole wheat flour gives this cookie a wonderful nutty flavor!! YUMMY!

Great cookies. Light tasting, sweet, and they look great. I am not a baker, and they were pretty foolproof for someone like me! I used entirely whole wheat flour, and they were delicious.

These cookies have an intriguing cinnamon aftertaste that will make you want to try another right away!  I added 1 tsp cream of tarter as per other snickerdoodle recipes (therefore approximating adding baking powder) to give the cookies a nice rise before they fall into their familiar crackle-topped shape. They're warm and soft right out of the oven and become more crisp/crunchy after they cool down. Very good!

The whole wheat flour adds a new twist to an old favorite.  The only trouble was baking time, they only took 8 minutes at the most to brown on edges.  Good cookies!

I can't figure out why this recipe got such high ratings. They did not turn out for me. I did make a few changes, but they were very very slight, and shouldn't have effected the turnout much at all. These were crumbly, taste like flour even after adding a full teaspoon of vanilla, and adding cinnamon right to the batter. They never flattened, and you cannot even pick them up. I was going to take these to my grandmother's 90th birthday party, but taking these would be an embarrassment. I'm not even going to bake up the rest of them. I am known in my family as a great cook, and cookies are my specialty.  I was interested in these because they don't use cream of tartar, which I'm out of at the moment. I'm going to make my peanut butter oatmeal cookies instead. They are a trademark of mine and foolproof. Don't waste your time or your ingredients on this.

These cookies were a huge hit at my house. My mom had friends over and EVERYONE was asking for the recipe. I cheated though, i forgot to put the all-purpous flour and just used the same amount of whole wheat flour. I completely reccommend you to try this also but with my little twist!!!

Mmmmm, these are so good.  I love them.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and you can hardly tell that whole wheat is in there.  I baked at a lower temp- 375- for 8 minutes and they turned out perfectly.  Crisp edges, chewy centers.  They are buttery, sweet and cinnamony.  Per other reviews, I added 1/2 tsp cream of tartar, and some vanilla.  I also used my own vanilla bean sugar for part of the sugar.

These were sooo DELISH! They are healthier without shortening and less white flour and they are even better than regular ones! I made these while I was babysitting and the little girl (2 yrs.)  and the little boy (1 yr.) loved helping me roll them in cinnamon and sugar ans they both thought they were super yummy! Great recipe! Thanks Nan!

These cookies are fantastic! I was looking for a snicker doodle recipe and was frustrated that most seemed to use cream of tartar, which I did not have. I was so happy to find this recipe! Also because I usually cook with whole wheat pastry flour-bonus! I made this recipe exactly as written (which I don't always do) and would not change it. I did runout of cinnamon sugar so had to make an extra half batch of that-no biggie. I wanted lots of cinnamon flavor. I made them a little bigger, 9 cookies per sheet and it made 25 gorgeous, perfect, tasty cookies. Crispy on the outside/edges and soft on the inside.

Great!  I did add about 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg to the batter and that jazzed up the cookie quite a bit.

This cookies are perfect as is, using all white-wheat flour, or using all white flour. I've made them each way and everyone has loved them each time. I appreciate that this recipe doesn't call for cream of tarter which I don't have. Very addicting, easy to make, and DELICIOUS. this is forever my go-to recipe for snickerdoddles!

Great recipe!  I made a tiny change after the first batch.  I replaced the all-purpose flour with whole wheat and they came out heartier and delicious! Makes me think I'm eating a healthier cookie!  These are so good even a week later.

My daughter and I just made these cookies and are having a hard time leaving them alone!  Totally delicious!  Since we didn't have any whole flour on hand, we just used all-purpose flour.  Still turned out awesome.  Will try with the WW flour next time!! :)

I added almond extract, 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar, cinnamon, and a touch of nutmeg to the batter. Also used all whole wheat flour. They came out delicious, a little puffier but still with that chewy feel. Bottom rack burned, but 9 minutes on middle rack seemed to do the trick. Next time I might use a little less sugar because they are so sweet, but otherwise they're delicious... I'd definitely recommend the nutmeg addition for the holidays.

I was craving something slightly sweet and these hit the spot! I scaled the recipe down by half, and followed the recipe exactly except that I used one whole egg. They're light but satisfyingly rich. You can't tell it's made with whole wheat -- next time I'll try it without the AP flour!

I made these at my boyfriend's place so I was using limited resources. I used white spelt flour and rolled them in just sugar - AMAZING ... and easy! I made the full recipe and only a couple made it to morning ;) I still get requests for these but I'm waiting until Fall before I heat up the kitchen again.

These cookies were really good! I brought them to a sleepover party and all the girls loved them. I especially like like use of whole wheat flour. Way to make a great-tasting, healthy snack!

The best Snickerdoodle I've ever had and good for you too.  Did not mention there was whole wheat in them and my son raved about them. Used the "small" scoop by Pampered Chef produced 57 cookies.  Do not flatten the ball or they come out too thin and crispy.  Leave in a ball, bake 8 minutes, and they come out with a soft center.

These were great!  I didn't make any changes what so ever.  I suppose I did end up needing a little more of the sugar and cinnamon mixture in the end, but that may have been my fault ;)  Really good recipe though, so happy I fell across it.

Its very rare that my homemade cookies come out perfect and tasting great and these certainly did! I used all whole wheat flour and added a little vanilla. Other than that I changed nothing and these were VERY good. I will definitely be making them again.

I tried cutting the recipe in half and my snickerdoodles taste like sugar cookies. And a tad bit salty...maybe it had to much butter. The Snickerdoodle I recipe is better. And there is a list for white flour on here twice...why I don't know. I think one is supposed to be brown sugar? I put brown sugar in mine due to lack of white sugar. I don't think it affected the sweetness. It DEFINITELY needs more cinnamon.

excellent Recipe!! Used all wheat flour, 2 whole eggs, and extra cinnamon and sugar in the dough (doubled).  Family gobbled them down and has no idea they are full of WHEAT flour.  Thank you.

Excellent. We always made snickerdoodles growing up, and these are reminiscent of the ones we made...but healthier. They were gobbled up quickly. Will make again.

I'm always happy when whole wheat cookies recipes turns out good. I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup all purpose flour, two whole eggs (by accident), added a bit of cin to the batter and only used sugar to coat the cookies before baking. I made regular snickerdoodles for the first time last week and the kids loved them. These are just as good and so much better for them.

I did not really care for these, the kids thought they were okay but my husband really liked.  I felt they were missing something.  In my house if there are cookies leftover within a few days, then I probably will not make again.  Sorry

These turned out AMAZING!  You can't tell that it has wheat flour in it! I used egg substitute instead of 1 egg and 1 egg white (3/8's cup), and it turned out just perfect.  Since my oven cooks super fast they only took about 4 minutes to bake a tray!  I definately will be putting this in my recipe file!

These cookies are amazing. They are the best snickerdoodles I’ve ever had. I did add cream of tartar because I like the zing in the flavor. Otherwise I followed this recipe exactly and it was perfect!

the oven temperature in this recipe was way to high I would turn it down to 350 also the size of the cookies balls they say is way to small I would recommend making them bigger and pressing it down before baked

Recipes results can vary drastically from one person to another based upon how each individual followed directions and whether they changed ingredients. I did use coconut sugar and entirely wheat flour. This cookie is definitely more of a bread like texture. I have made them twice, first time not changing anything. The flavor was fabulous and if you can just accept that this cookie will turn out a bit more crumbly and not your typical soft and chewy cookie then I'm sure you will enjoy it. Mine did not quite flatten out either . They puffed and kinda stayed that way.

I used all all-purpose flour for this recipe because I couldn't make a trip to the store and it still turned out fairly well. Word of caution: make sure that you blend the butter very well or the cookies will slide off the sheet! Would definitely bake this again.

I just finished making these cookies and they turned out fantastic!  I followed the recipe to a T except I added 2 tbs of cinnamon and added it directly to the batter.  I rolled the cookies in plain sugar before baking.  My 3 year old loves them and so do I.  They are for a bake sale so they will be donated, but I would definitely try this recipe again for my family.

I have never enjoyed snickerdoodles, but this recipe is amazing!  They are buttery with a crisp edge and soft chewy inside... so yum!

I added a bit of Cream of Tartar to give them that tart kick, used 2 1/4 c. flour and I baked at 350 for 11 minutes

Another one of our faves! So easy and healthier than the typical white flour/shortening version. I use only whole wheat flour and instead of rolling the ball in the cinnamon/sugar mixture- I just sprinkle some over balls before putting them in the oven and they turn out just mah-velous!

This recipe is perfect.  I made a slight alteration on the last batch by adding chai tea spice to the sugar& cinnamon mixture (1/2t).  The chai cookies were inhaled and these are our new favorite!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I tried making these cookies twice and they turned out horrible both times. The first time the dough was so sticky that the cookies ran together into a sugary mess. I tried again and refrigerated the dough for an hour and the same thing happened. I can make all purpose snickerdoodles perfectly fine, so I'm guessing the whole wheat is the issue.

For wheat snickerdoodles, these were pretty good. I made it, as is. Everything seems to work out well except the cinnamon flavor.  The wheat over powered the cinnamon coading. These were yummy but if I want a snickerdoodle, I think it needs more cinnamon. Mayby ill try to put it in the dough as well. Great cookies, thanks.

This recipe is delicious.  The cookies are soft and chewy and light.  I added a smidge of cream of tartar as per people's suggestions, but i think it probably wasn't necessary.  The main thing i did differently was use McCormick Chai Spice Blend instead of cinnamon - it gives the cookies a bit more of a kick!

These are great! I had whole wheat flour from something else and couldnt figure out what to do with it.  I too added 1tsp vanilla,and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  I even had to substitute for the butter and the eggs (I have allergies) and they still turned out great!

I thought these were only alright, but my husband loves them and they are made with whole wheat (and he HATES whole wheat), so I'm giving them 4 stars.

OMG! This is my new favorite cookie. My husband could taste the difference from the original recipe, but loves this one too.

Mhmmm...these cookies were very good.  Crunchy on the outside and soft&chewy inside.  I added more cinnimon into the batter and it turned out delicious!  One of the best soft sugar cookie recipes I have tried!

Absolutely wonderful, maybe the best snickerdoodle I've ever made!! I think the secret to this recipe is to make them by hand instead of using a mixer.  If your butter is room temp this isn't too hard. Also, I used two whole eggs--just didn't feel like separating them; 1t cream of tartar; and pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  I also added 1t vanilla after the eggs to the batter. Definately cook 8 or less minutes.

These are so good.  I used real butter & you can definitely taste it.  I used the medium Pampered Chef cookie scoop & baked for about 8.5 minutes on my Pampered Chef stone cookie sheet.  I got 34 cookies.  They are crisp on the outside and soft & chewy on the inside.  I really think the key to these cookies is to not bake them for too long.

These cookies were delicious!  I was very excited to find a recipe using whole wheat flour.  As other reviewers suggested, I used 2c. whole wheat flour and only 3/4 c. all-purpose. I also added a dash of vanilla extract and cinnamon in the dough before baking it.  I will definitely make these again!!

This was horrible! They were like hockey pucks going down. I did the recipe to a T but something went wrong. The smell was great -- the cinnamon/sugar combo was delicious but they didn't rise and fall like was described and I had to flatten them myself -- about 12 minutes in I finally took them out and they still weren't done. I don't know what went wrong!

This is a good cookie.  I substituted 1/4 cup Splenda for 1/2 cup sugar.  Also added 1 teas Cream of Tarter.  They turned out great.
