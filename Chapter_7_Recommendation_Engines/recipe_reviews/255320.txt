This was really nice! I made exact to the recipe except for adding more garlic to everything. Beautiful colors on the plate! Will make again.

This meal came out quite well and so colorful! Everything cooked up as written. I hade to keep it gluten free, so I used tamari instead of soy and had to use brown miso instead of white. I also used a piece of firm tofu, cooking it like the salmon, and it was delicious! The amount of marinade could be reduced because it makes a lot.  Thank you for the recipe.

A perfect marinade for salmon. An impressive meal with purple potatoes and green bean. For those that are wondering, purple potatoes taste just like regular potatoes.

The miso glaze added just the right amount of flavor to the salmon. And the green beans were perfectly tender and added a nice color to the plate.
