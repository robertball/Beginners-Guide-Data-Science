This is my first try with indian seafood and it was liked by all, the only tough part is grating a fresh coconut.

I made a few adjustments and it is now one of my favorite meals!! I substituted the sword fish for salmon which worked wonderfully. I also used about 1.5 tablespoons of finely grated fresh ginger root instead of 1/2 c. chopped ginger. I also used less chilli powder but that was just a personal preference. EXCELLENT!!!!!! I served it with coconut rice.

This is a fabulous recipe my husband made using Tilapia instead of Swordfish. It turned out restaurant standard!

It smelled really good, but I messed it up because I can't do anything right. First I pureed the ginger and onion cause according to my wife, I used the cheese grater then i cooked it for a little too long. but it smelled great. the beans and rice i made were not a good fit either. they were new orleans style. but what do i know....monkeybars

This was very tasty.  We reduced the fresh ginger somewhat (1/2 a cup of fresh ginger requires a lot of ginger root!), and substituted tilapia for the swordfish (we just couldn't justify the $17/lb for a curry) and it was still very good.

I like this kind of food, but this had very little flavor and the mango got all mushy.

This dish was very tasty, but I would not call it "spicy".  Flavorful, perhaps, but not spicy.  The coconut and mango were very nice together!

This was excellent, I followed the recipe almost exactly and I wouldn't change a thing. It made a very nice change of pace from our usual dinners, and was surprisingly quick and easy to prepare.

I used chives instead I’d red onion and served over riced cauliflower. Yummy!  Use let red pepper if you don’t like super Spicey.

This recipe is relatively easy to prepare and quite delicious!  However, it lacks visual appeal.
