I feel kind of bad for only giving this recipe a 2, because it wasnt horrible, but it was WAY too much work for little reward. The directions were also a little bit hard to follow, so having had no experience with this dish, it made it even more difficult. Way too many dirty dishes, prep work, and I felt the tomatillos were overpowering. It isnt bad, I just feel like something that takes this much work should taste amazing.
