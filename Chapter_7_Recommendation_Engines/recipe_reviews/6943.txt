I too made this into muffins, and it was great.  I omitted the candied peel and instead added raisins to half and dried cranberries to half.  I used more nuts and fruit than the recipe called for.  It made twelve big regular-sized muffins and probably would have made seven or eight large muffins.  We liked them a lot, cold or warm.  Very hearty and a great way to use up cottage cheese that's getting old.

Another winner, Carol! I made 12 muffins out of this, six with raisins. I baked them for 35 minutes. Sweet and yummy.

Not bad.  I'd like a bit more flavor to this--maybe some cinnamon, or nutmeg.  This is a heavy, dense quick bread.  I see why the other two reviewers made it into muffins--they'd be good that way.  I don't have mixed fruit peel, so I just put in the same amount of lemon peel.  It worked just fine, although I suppose it would be better with mixed, as there'd be more flavors that way.  An hour at 350 was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a hit!  I swapped out all-purpose flour for whole wheat, added a 3rd teaspoon of baking powder (due to the flour change), omitted the salt, and in place of the candied mixed fruit peel I just used a teaspoon each of dried orange and lemon peel, plus a teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and a 1/2 cup of raisins.  Great stuff!  Thanks so much!

Instead of putting mixed fruit peel, I put dried raisins and blueberries. When this loaf was ready, I cut it in half (between the hot dog style) and spread cream cheese on the insides of the loaf. It tasted soooo good.

I made the loaf into fifteen muffins and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter as others suggested.  Unfortunately, I found the muffins to be quite plain, so I won't be making them again.

I read the reviews before making this so I did the following: added cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg. I toasted the walnuts before adding them. I used half a cup of whole wheat flour as well.  For the candied fruit, I had some candied ginger on hand.  I as well made them into muffins as I have a hard time using a loaf pan (it never seems to cook in the middle and it gets thrown in the compost!). These turned out excellent.  My teenage son ate 5 of them at once!!

Lovely, I have made this twice, second time using 3/4 cup of sugar instead of a cup and used home made candied orange peel.
Delish will definitely make again.

I found the texture to be rather strange - chewy and slightly spongy, perhaps due to the extra egg and lack of any fats.  The flavour is nice though, and it's good warmed up with a bit of butter.

I substituted raisins for the candied mixed fruit peel and baked as muffins, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  My children really liked these and I did too, but...  I think they are missing -something, perhaps spice.  I'm thinking nutmeg or cinnamon, maybe chinese five spice.  They definitely have a beautiful texture and sponge to them which would be a shame to pass up.  I will most likely make these again, but add some spice to help them fulfill their potential.
