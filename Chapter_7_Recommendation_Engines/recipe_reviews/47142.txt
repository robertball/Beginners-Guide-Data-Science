I scaled this down considerably to feed 20 people for a party at a friend's house.  Even though there was other food there to eat, my dish went fast!  People were getting seconds and one guy even took a third helping!!!!!  I ut up carrots, potatoes, rutabagas and cabbage to go with it.  I left that party with an empty dish!  I think that calls for the highest rating I can give it.
