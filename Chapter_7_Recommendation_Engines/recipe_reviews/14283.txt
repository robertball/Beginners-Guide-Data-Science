I made this for a group of 20 people at work and it was a total hit!  Several people had never had artichoke hearts before and loved it.  I will definitely make this again and again.  The author it is right - it stays crunch and very tasty after 24 hours.

Was good immediately upon serving, but doesn't hold up well.  If I make it again, I'll cut dressing.  It was a little too soupy for me.

This is similar to my mom's broccoli salad but we add the following:  kidney beans, Good Season's Zesty Italian you make yourself (much better than the bottled kind), garlic salt.  Right before serving we add grated cheddar cheese and halved cherry tomatoes (makes it less soupy).  Better after marinating for 2 days. Always a requested dish!
This recipe is good with the artichoke hearts.  Costco now sells jarred hearts of palm and that may be a good addition as well.

Made this for a party and everyone loved it.  Very simple.  I did cut back a bit on the onion and olives.

Delicious. I made it with 1/2 broccoli and 1/2 cauliflower and it was better the next day. I used   Newman's Own Olive Oil & Vinegar Dressing.

Awesome!!  Instead of the italian dressing, I did the standard olive oil / balsamic vinegar vinaigrette, with the marinate from the artichoke.  Hummm humm...

Have made this several times. It is very good. Even very crisp and tasty next day packed in my lunch kit. This is a keeper.

I will include on the menu for our next  Fathers' Day  cookout. I only had red onions and used it generously. I had marinated artichoke quarters on hand.  I used a leftover dressing from a spinach - strawberries salad found on this site (which I veganized) comprised of balsamic vinegar, agave nectar,  olive oil, & salt and ground black pepper.  I sprinkled sunflower seeds for a little crunch.  It was delish!

We really enjoyed the combination of veggies, but I wish I had steamed the broccoli quickly first and we thought the dressing left a lot to be desired in the flavor department.

I liked it and so did my family, it is a keeper with a few minor adjustments, had to make the adjustments so my family would even try it. For starters my family doesn't like raw broccoli so I steamed mine. Next time I make this dish, I will not pour dressing all over the veggies to coat and let it sit, I will make this and plate it and then pour dressing on top and the individual can stir it on their own plate. All in all this was a good recipe, I will make it again, it is a keeper with a few minor adjustments for my family, Thanks for a great recipe.

I love this recipe. I love that you don't have to even blanch the broccoli and it softens up enough in the Italian Dressing. Still crunchy,though. I made this for the end-of-the-year teacher pot-luck at my school and it was very well-received. I made it again for home and love having it in the fridge. Gets better with age. Great recipe.

Very tasty salad. I used a vadalia rather than red onion, un-marinated artichoke hearts(only because those were what I had on hand) and added fresh button mushrooms. This is definately a keeper - thanks for the posting.

Excellent.  Extremely easy, and adaptable to what I have on hand.  I always get asked for this recipe.
