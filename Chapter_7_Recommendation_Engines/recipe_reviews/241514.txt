Very easy and delicious. Not dry at all.  My only quibble is that the recipe states that the marinade is a paste. Mine was not - it was a sauce, although I followed the directions to the letter. Nevertheless, a delicious , moist roast enjoyed by all the family! (I used a 4 lb. boneless leg of lamb from Costco, and the ingredient proportions were perfect.)

First off,  I had an almost 8lb leg of lamb w/bone. I seasoned all sides w/salt & pepper and seared on all sides before rubbing "juice" mixture (not paste) all over meat before placing in crock w/wine (red & a bit of white cause that's all I had) already cooking on low. I tripled ingredients except thyme as I'm not a big fan.  I did add oregano (because I LOVE oregano w/lamb). Used stoned ground mustard w/horseradish and everything else listed. I only gave a 4* because I feel that it was not a "paste" but a juice and I cooked my almost 8lb roast for 3 hours on low and it was done! If I left it in longer it would have been ruined.  I added cut up potatoes and carrots into the juice while my lamb rested approx. 30 minutes then carved.  I removed some of the juice to a pot and thickened to make a gravy for lamb and veggies.  It was just AMAZING!!!  I was a bit leary as to cooking a lamb in the crock pot but it did work.  It was OH SOOOO GOOD.  Thanks for the idea.  HAPPY NEW YEAR!

This is phenomenal. The only thing I did differently was to rub thyme, rosemary, garlic and pepper on the lamb 24 hours ahead of time and let it sit. This lame is fall apart tender and full of incredible flavor. I will make this again for sure.

I made this with a boneless leg of lamb that I purchased at Trader Joe's.  The meat was still a little pink inside but was dry and not enjoyable.  I wish I had oven roasted it instead.  I had expected it would come out tender and was disappointed.

Delicious.  Other reviews are right -- the "paste" is pretty liquid-y, but I rubbed it on it anyway and it was delicious.  I added Cumin and Coriander to the rub, and added more salt and pepper.  I also used at least a cup of red wine and cooked it on low for 8 hours.  The result was incredible!  I took the juices and made a gravy from them with butter and flour in saucepan, and poured it over.

Used boneless leg. Made stuffing to pack hole nice and full, holes can cause trouble with over cook fast. Added 5 drops of siracha to paste. Made sauce into paste, on low heat stir in some quick tapioca, or bit of minute rice. Not harm flavour, careful with rice, gets thicker fast! Will make again for sure!. Found 5 hrs lil long. Use thermometer earlier is all. Enjoy!

Will definitely make this again.  I was hoping for the best when I searched for leg of lamb in the slow cooker but am delighted that I found this,  Did exactly as written except used bottled lemon juice instead of from a fresh lemon.  And I shorted the amount of thyme since that is not a favorite flavor.  The roast smelled great while cooking is extremely moist now that it is done.  Sample tasting is delicious.  Just making the potatoes and veggies now but promises to be a great dinner.

I made this with a few alterations. I didn't have wine, so I cooked it in broth and water. Also, instead of dijon, I used ground mustard seeds. Also, boneless lamb. It was very good. I'll try with wine another time, but this variation was phenomenal. These spices are so suited to lamb.

Used this recipe for lamb chops (organically fed) and they were delicious.  Let them cook for 5.5 hrs.  They were tasty, tender, and the meat fell off the bone.

Going to use it again for leg of lamb but this time sliced onions will be used.  They will go well with the sauce that the liquids made.

This was great! I’m never sure how to cook a lamb roast so as to keep everybody happy. We like it well done but not dry.
I bought the roast at Costco and used my Instant Pot on the slow cooking function for the first time. I had read that this is slower than a regular slow cooker, and it was. So I made allowances and cooked it for 7 1/2 hours.
It came out very tender and flavorful. You couldn’t taste the individual ingredients in the “rub/sauce. It was just tasty. 
This will now be my go-to recipe. Glad to be able to use my Instant Pot for this.

Currently in my slow cooker but I'm confident. Note about the paste - Don't mix the wine into the other paste ingredients, the recipe says the wine just goes into the bottom of the cooker, then mix paste and rub it on the meat, then into the wine in the slow cooker. No wonder everyone's paste wasn't pastey!

This turned out well. The cooking time made it come out at 170 degrees (which was fine with me because I don’t like pink meat). I did end up changing the spices. My husband doesn’t like thyme and when I got home I realized I didn’t have any rosemary!  I used tarragon, parsley and some chives.

I know nothing about wine so a specific grape would have helped - used a fairly cheap Marlot. I used a 2.75kg leg with bone in a 5.5L slow cooker, so I doubled all ingredients - didn't use lemon and added carrots and celery. I'll repeat what others have said: The paste was a thin sauce. Watch your temperatures closely! At 5 hours mine was pushing 170F (well done for lamb and overcooked for my taste). Because it was overcooked it was not very moist or tender. I will definitely try again because the flavor is nice.

absolutely gorgeous. I used a large leg and froze the leftovers.
