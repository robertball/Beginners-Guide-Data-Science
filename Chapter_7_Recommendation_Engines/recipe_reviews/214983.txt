People asked for the recipe when I served this. Loved the flavors and the textures. I sliced the snap peas diagonally instead of snapping them in half.The salad kept it's crunch for several days and was great served as leftovers.

This was SO GOOD!  I loved all these flavors together!  Next time I will use fresh ingredients just cause I usually have them on hand...but for a quick easy side....perfect!  I did use some yellow tomatoes too!  Thanks!

I made the salad exactly as printed.  Combination of veggies was wonderful and fresh, but felt that the mayo and cheese was a bit overpowering, almost as if I was "killing" the freshness of the veggies.  Since I am not a big mayo lover, I will either reduce the dressing ingredients in the future, or use some other dressing as I believe this can be tweeked to ones personal preference.

Thanks for this great recipe!  I needed a quick, fresh salad with the peas from my garden.  I used my own onion, peas, basil and oregano along with tomatoes and mayo and lemon for dressing.

Better the next day.   Added a bit more carrot because it was left from the shredding.   Would make again.
