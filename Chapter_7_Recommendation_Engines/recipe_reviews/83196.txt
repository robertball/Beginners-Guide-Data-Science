My family loved it.  I modified it by adding onions, bell pepper and a couple dashes of worcestershire sauce as well as using minute rice.  I also went the mega easy route and made it a one skillet meal by melting the cheese on top of the dish on the stove.  I did not use the oven.  Even better "left-over"!

Great quick meal.  My brother even likes this.  Every now and again I will add a can of Rotel instead of plain diced tomatos.  I also add one chopped onion.  I don't put into the oven.  I cook on top of the stove when it's done I put some cheddar cheese on top put the lid back on and let it melted.

we had this a few nights ago, and I loved it.  My husband said it was basically like hamburger helper, and was a little too tomatoey.  But, I like that it was home made and not from a box.  I will definatly make again.

This recipe was really good, the only thing I had a problem with was the rice.  It didn't cook in 15 minutes, or 30 either.  Luckily I had some  chicken broth to add so it wouldn't boil down.  I've made it again since then, and made the rice separate.  We love it.

I had to make dinner in a hurry and I found this recipe and even though I only browned ground meat with pepper and put in a can of celery soup and let it cook for ten minutes and poured it over rice, it was really tasty and only took about 20 minutes. I had cooked the rice in the rice cooker previously. I would never have thought to use a condensed cream soup with hamburger meat. I was really surprised how good it was and I skipped most of the ingredients and most of the steps. Hamburger jazz rocks! :)  When I have more prep time, I will make it the correct way. Thanks, for sharing an easy and tasty recipe! ;)

This was very good. Had hamburger out and left over rice to use up. Used canned tomatoes with chipoltle and added minced onion, garlic powder and a can of diced green chilies. Used the whole bag of mozzarella cheese (2 c,), we love cheese ! Cooked it all in an electric skillet, as I dan't have a stove, Turned out great ! Thank-you for sharing !!!

I would give this a 5 star rating for taste.  I used Rotel diced tomatoes with chilis to give it some kick.  My husband liked it, but I have to say it was not appetizing looking.  I turned off the lights and used candles.  That was better.  I think if I make it again I will drain the tomatoes, add an onion, and cook the rice separately.  Would help the look.

Made this dish last night...fast, easy and yummy.  I did makes some changes to the recipe. 
1 substituted a can of ro-tel + 1/4 of diced tomatoes instead of JUST diced tomatoes. 
I had left over Pillsbury flaky biscuits so I cut them half and soaked the open part in melted butter...layered the biscuits (butter side up) on the top of the hamburger mix and layer of cheese. Baked at 450 degrees for around 5 minutes, then hit it on broil in-order to brown for about 2 minutes. YUMMY!!!

Awesome dish. My hubby had 2 large servings and said that it was a keeper. There were a few additions.  I added chopped green pepper, one garlic clove and onion while the hamburger was being browned in skillet. In addition added corn and black beans. I also added dash of Worcestershire sauce. I also prepared the rice separately and added it at the end. I added additional shredded cheese to my large skillet and put lid on it until cheese melted. When serving I plated and placed a large dollop of sour cream and salsa. Bon appetite!

Made this for the second time tonight and decided to "jazz" it up a bit more by adding black beans and taco seasoning. I also use the Rotel (mild) and it adds more flavor than just plain diced tomatoes. I also melt some shredded sharp cheddar on top of the mozzarella.

I seasoned my ground beef with some onion salt, pepper, garlic salt, and garlic powder and added chopped onion and green bell pepper to the ground beef as well. I added some milk (about half a can) which helped cook the rice and used about 1 cup of minute rice. I did not use diced tomatoes. I topped with medium cheddar cheese rather than mozzarella. This turned out to be a convenient delicious dinner that the whole family loved!

I rated this with 5 stars for speed and appeal to the whole family.  The cheese is what makes it, according to my husband who enjoyed this dish even though he isn't a fan of rice.  I, too, cooked the rice separately but other wise changed nothing.  My only criticism is the taste of canned soup, so I'd like to try it with the mushroom soup recipe on this site that another reviewer suggested.  (Of course, that would affect one of the most attractive features of this recipe:  the speed.)  I filed this under Quick and Easy recipes that I'll go to time and time again, I'm sure.  Thanks for such a good recipe.

Made this tonight. It was easy, quick and all in one. I added celery, onions and some garlic powder. Husband and 15 year old son loved it. I did put it under the broiler. It gave the cheese the brownish yummy looking aspect. Thanks for the a quick and delicious recipe!

Very easy & flexible recipe! I needed to put together a meal with minimal ingredients (week's-end budget) that my toddler would actually eat. I modified slightly - sautéed 1/4 cup diced yellow onion, a tad minced garlic and 1 cup chopped baby bella mushrooms for a fuller flavor. I also mixed in   1/3 cup shredded mozzarella to the mixture during to transfer to casserole dish. It was a hit... No leftovers.

We really liked this recipe.  I followed other suggestions and substituted a can of mild Rotel instead of the diced tomatoes.  I also substituted pasta shells instead of rice since that's what I had on hand.  It was great!  Family loved it.  Thanks for sharing.

Turned out great. Reminds me of stuff that was my go to when the kids were small. I did use Rotel instead of just diced tomatoes, added onions, just enough kick. Brings back good memories.

It's rather bland as is. Adding a sauteed onion and celery and spices did make it better.  I guess it's a good family style meal with children.  I might make it again if I have children over.

My husband & I really liked this.  I had leftover rice so it was even easier to make.  I didn’t have canned tomatoes so substituted with salsa.  I added extra garlic, pepper & a bit of curry.  Mozerella cheese on top. 
Definitely make it again

This was pretty good. It ended up being a little blander than I had wanted so I added a homemade chili seasoning mix to the finished mixture before putting the cheese on top. I made this as a one-pot meal on the stove and did not put it in the oven at the end.

Very tasty and easy. I did like some of the reviewers and added chopped peppers and onion and a pinch of Italian seasoning. The rice was a little chewy after 15 minutes but I didn't notice until I took it off the stove. Next time I'll do 20 minutes.  Didn't spoil the dish.

Well, I got burned again. I will never again use uncooked rice when it is added with other ingredients & cooked together. Rice should be prepared on the side & added at the end. (unless you enjoy crunchy rice) Other than that, we really enjoyed the recipe and it just may become a family favorite.

Very simple.  Fancy it is not but everyone ate it and liked it. I used Italian herb tomato which I think helped with the flavor.  Yum!

Really turned out well. As per some reviews, I prepared rice separate from dish. I did add some peppers and onions to browned ground beef, but stuck with recipe otherwise. Husband said much better than any packaged hamburger helper. It’s a keeper. Really can switch it up as you want too!

This was yummy, but I added garlic, onion powder and chili powder. I also cooked onions and sweet bell peppers in with the hamburger. I used minute rice because of the cook time. To cut the acidity of the tomatoes I added a little sugar (but you can’t forget salt if you add sugar). After cooking I let it sit with lid on for 20 mins so all the flavors could mix in together. Happy cooking :)

Turned out great! I added a dash of A1 Sauce, green Chile’s, and cheddar cheese.  Could use a little more spice. But an easy make and smells great while cooking.

Delicious and easy!  I made the whole thing on the stove instead of using the oven,  added an onion chopped, and then used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. My 11 year old dipped in through some salsa and said it's amazing. Will make again!

Used mozzarella cheese and only about 3/4 can of tomatoes because my daughter doesn't like them. Added a beef bouillon cube to rice. I cooked rice first and then combined it all in casserole. Delicious and easy!!

On a cold, winters day, I was looking for something quick and hearty, and this is it! I left out the rice to make it lower in carbs. I used Red Gold Chili spiced tomatoes. The cream of mushroom soup makes it creamy but you don’t taste it. I just used a single skillet and covered it to melt the cheese . Soooo good! I wanted to eat it all myself, but I shared. Not a fancy company recipe, just a great, basic, easy dish.

Family really liked this dish. I added a bell pepper and 1/2 a cup of low sodium tomato juice to the mix. I cooked the rice in a separate bowl and then added the rice after it was cooked. I wanted the rice to be tinder. We served it with Amish cornbread.

I made this with a few different ingredients, cheddar,broccoli and potato soup, and fresh tomatoes chopped, I Used American cheese too. My son actually ate it and he doesn't like veggies. It was very good. I would make it again and recommend it to others.

Really good. Browned the beef with half an onion,  half a green pepper and 2 crushed garlic cloves. Added the soup and drained tomatoes along with a bit of Worchestire. Cooked the rice separately and then let it all simmer together for about 10 minutes.

I used a can of diced tomatoes with chiles and added garlic powder, minced onion, black pepper and pink sea salt. The rice came out a bit undercooked and I was afraid it would; just didn't seem like enough liquid in the pan. I made it in the cast iron skillet and broiled in the oven instead of using a casserole dish.

I was surprised how tasty this dish is. I precooked the rice partially to make sure it would be tender, and added some taco seasoning to perk up the flavor a bit.

I had to add about a cup to a cup and a half of water to get the rice to finish cooking but it was worth the extra time. I added garlic salt, garlic powder, onion powder, a couple of tablespoons of Worchestershire sauce and one package of Lipton beefy onion soup as well as marjoram and oregano. It was wonderful!

Changed it a bit.  The rice would not cook up in the time it says, I needed to add 1/2 cup milk to coax it along.  It may have altered the original flavor enough that I didn't care much for it.

Very tasty. I needed something quick and easy and this fit the bill. It was good and provided a little bit of leftovers for the next day, too. I followed the recipe, and then through in some onion that I needed to use up. This definitely is on my go-to list.

I made this last night and everyone loved it!  Husband, 17 year old son and 10 year old daughter.  I used fore roasted tomato by accident, but it was really good.  Next time, I think I will cook the rice first, then add it as it seems to take forever to cook the rice through.  Great recipe!  Quick prep time.

I sautéed an onion and green bell pepper then added the ground beef. The rice didn't cook but I added more cream of mushroom soup. I'm going to cook the rice separate next time. I also put about a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce. I didn't put any cheese on it nor did I put it in the oven. It was very filling and easy to make.

I found it to be bland and boring. My rice took way longer to cook and I ended up with a gooey mess.  I hate to rate a recipe this low because it takes talent beyond mine to create them.  I just cannot honestly recommend this one.  Thank you anyway though.

This is good ol' comfort kind of food.  We cooked the rice in the rice cooker and not with the meat.  Since we doubled the meat, we doubled everything but the tomatoes and drained them.  It has plenty of tomatoes.  Added Worcestershire, onions, black pepper (about 1 tsp. for a double recipe) and a few drops of harbenero sauce to brighten it up just a bit.  Layered the rice on the bottom, then the meat and Monterey Jack on top.   Only had to broil the cheese in the oven.  Very nice family dinner.

We loved this, that being said, I did (as I always do) read the reviews "before" making it, and adjusted accordingly.  For those who thought this was bland, you might want to read reviews before making also, it makes a huge difference in most recipes.  I treat every recipe as a "guide".  This was delicious, affordable, and quick ... FIVE STARS!

Didn't really like this at all.  Texture was fine, presentation was just like the photo, but this was rather bland for me.  Was looking for a way to make more creative hamburger type meals.  We didn't even eat the leftovers.  Not sure what I missed on this one from all the great reviews.

My family absolutely loved this recipe. But I did make a few small changes. I used a can of cream of tomato soup instead of the mushroom soup. Also added the minced garlic, recommended by others readers. We really loved the mix of these flavors. I topped with 2 handfuls of shredded mozzarella cheese and 1 handful of shredded cheddar cheese. Super tastey !!

I used wild rice instead of white.  Worked great, but had to cook it a bit longer.  Another reviewer added a little green bell pepper and worcestershire sauce so I tried that as well.  Also, I used cheddar and Mexican Style cheese (didn't have motz on hand).  The guys really liked it and went back for seconds.

Pretty good.  I used the called for can of diced tomatoes and then added a can of green chilies.  Also added corn.  We liked it and I would make it again.

I added some peppers and onions and about 1 1/2 cups of green beans.  I substituted 2 cups of instant rice that I cooked separately and added to the hamburger mix at the end along with 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.

Was very nice. The only issue is that the rice did not cook in 15 minutes, it took about 45 minutes.

I tweeked it just a bit. I decided to pan fry some onions, then i put them aside and steamed my rice. I pan fried my hamburger, added the onions, cream of mushroom soup, celery soup, salsa and tomatos. Then I added some pizza blended cheese to the rice and served the hamburger mixture over the cheesy rice. My kids loved it!

My picky son loves this...we dont eat meat so we use "fake meat" crumbles instead of the beef.  We add to it by saute onion and mushrooms before adding the "meat" and use tomatoes with green chlies and use chedder jack cheese..  We make steamed rice and put it on top...never seem to have enough for my crew

It was good.  I added garlic, salt and pepper seasonings and I think next time I will add some jalapenos to spice it up.  I served ours with tortilla chips to make it heartier or more filling. My husband seemed to like it too.

Quick and easy recipe. I used Rotel instead of the canned tomatos and used american cheese instead of mozzarella because I used what I had on hand. It's not a glamorous dish, but it is cheap to make and very filling.

My kids (4 & 7) loved it! This is a great way to use up leftover rice! But I changed the recipe quite a bit. I added chili powder & onions to give it a little kick. I also served it on tortillas and called them enchiladas. I did not put the cheese on the mixture. I added the cheese when I put it in the tortilla shells. I also used a Mexican cheese blend instead of mozzarella. After changing the recipe it was very good!

Going by other reviews, I didn't follow the the directions as written and precooked the rice.  Since I didn't have canned tomatoes on hand I used spaghetti sauce, it was great!  I also cooked it all stove top, I imagine it would look so much better popping it into the oven so the cheese gets a little browned and bubbly!

I made this with cream of mushroom soup 1 from this website. I also cooked the rice separately in beef broth. It made a LOT and it is very filling. Next time I'll add something green like bell pepper, because while it tasted good, it didn't look very appetizing.

this is a great last minute dinner! it does not look good before it goes into the oven but the taste is amazing! my 2 yr old, who never eats the meat in any dish, cleaned her plate tonight. i am so happy to have found this recipe!

the reason why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because i decided to cook my rice for a few minutes separately so it wouldn't be hard. i also used diced tomatoes with basil and oregano it it and mixed mozz cheese with cheddar. YUMMY!
