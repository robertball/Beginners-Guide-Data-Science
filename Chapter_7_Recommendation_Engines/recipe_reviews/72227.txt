These were delicious - but I made a couple of changes.  I used crumbled garlic & herb feta instead of goat cheese and I also added some shredded Italian-blend cheese.  Additionally, I sauteed 2 cloves of chopped garlic with the asparagus.  I substituted green onions for the cilantro as well.  Will definitely make again!

These were great! I actually used some flour and some whole wheat tortillas and served them as an appetizer at a party. I also made the Zesty Black Bean Quesadillas With Cilantro Sour Cream from this site and the Colantro Sour Cream tasted really good with these quesadilla as well. Very easy to make.

This is such a tasty snack! I added pine nuts which really kicked it up a notch. It is quite rich due to the goat cheese, but still bursting with flavor!

These were great and hardly took any time at all. I had done the pan-fried asparagus from this site the night before and chopped up the leftovers for this. When I told my husband what we were having, he was skeptical and accused me of feeding him "hippie food" since it has no meat. But he even made a second one for himself! Definitely a delicious, fast, and easy meal! Thanks for the recipe!

I give this 5 stars, making this recipe exactly as shown here. It was fabulous and the whole family loved it. For those of you who do not know, Goat Cheese is very tangy (not sour) with a almost feta cheese quality/flavor/texture, minus the "parmigiano reggiano" notes and nuances. I sauteed the asparagus as stated the first time, but the second time I sauteed it under very high heat with crushed garlic that was browned to a sweet crisp. It brought out the depth of the cheese and allowed a full flavor combination to be experienced as an explosion of varying yet satisfying flavors.

Make sure you really love asparagus,cilantro, and goat cheese! The flavors are really strong. I loved this recipe, but my family wasn't happy with it at all.

This recipe was very easy, very fast, and was easily made into a single serving lunch dish. Since I had regular goat chesse, I added dried basil chopped tomatos to mine to give it more flavor.

This recipe would also be great with spinach.

My family really liked this. Used as a side dish, with a few changes.  I used 4 tortillas, and had plenty of filling. Also had to use pepper jack cheese, which had a great spicy flavor, and didn't need the cilantro.

My family absolutely hated these.  My two year old - who will pretty much eat everything ate them over a couple of days..but as for the rest of us - we ended up throwing them all on a combined plate and going out to eat.  I suppose I am missing something here..but no thanks!

this was delicious! the asparagus took longer than I expected to cook and goat cheeese is tricky to spread (depending on which brand used of course) but the 2 together was yumma! I heated up the tortillas in microwave 11 sec to make spreading the cheese easier. I served it with a small side salad.

This combination of flavors is awesome.  I mixed some chopped cilantro with sour cream and used it like you woul use plain sour cream or salsa with regular quesadillas.  I served it with a small side salad.

Really good! We are big goat cheese fans and this was a great way to use the rest of the asparagus I had on hand. I also used a little bit of mozzarella to make sure that the tortillas would sick together. Ate it as a main dish along with salad. Will definitely make again!

I altered this recipe but it was DELICIOUS! I used goat cheese, but I added avocado, sauteed mushrooms, tomatoes, yellow peppers and onions and omitted the asparagus (didnt have any). I also topped it with a little bit of mozza cheese. OH MY Yummy! Will definitely make this again!

This was really good. However, we did add just a bit of cheddar cheese. Without the cheddar I am not sure it would have been cheesy enough. The asparagus and goat cheese are perfect together!

WOW! These are sooo good. Excellent Springtime meal. Did not use "herbed" goat cheese since we'd just bought fresh plain goat cheese from a local farm.  Tips: Make this when asparagus is in season. Use fresh cilantro (dried just won't cut it).  Use the extra cilantro and goat cheese in an omelette the next day. SO GOOD.

I modified these with what I had on hand.  I stir fried the asparagus with 1 teaspoon fresh minced garlic, a bunch of fresh black pepper, and a couple shakes of salt.  I used Lavash low-carb bread wraps (flax, whole wheat, oat bran), colby cheese (instead of goat cheese), and spinach (instead of cilantro).  I folded the wrap over once I filled it and placed a medium-sized sauce pan on top to press it (like a panini).  YUM!!  These would be good with the goat cheese and dipped in sour cream too!

I only had frozen asparagus, so I boiled mine instead of pan-frying.  I also snuck in some mushrooms and served with a mound of diced tomatoes, lettuce, salsa, and a tad of sour cream.

This was the first dish I've made from allrecipes and it turned out great. I bought the goat cheese from our local farmer's market, along with some fresh asparagus. I'll definitely be making these again soon.

These were so good I wanted to SLAP myself and everyone else at the table. LOL. Yes, it was that tasty and rich! You don't even taste the asparagus because of the goat cheese. Now I finally have a dish that I can make with asparagus that isn't too bitter or slimy to eat. I did change the recipe a bit. I made two of these with Naan bread. I sliced the Naans in half and layed the ingredients on the bottom piece, then put a wheat tortilla on top and layered again. Buttered the top piece of the Naan and finally placed that on top of the wheat tortilla - so it had two layers of cheese mix and three of the bread (see pic). I also added chopped tomatoes and onions seasoned with basil to the dish, which really made the dish more flavorful and kept the herbed goat cheese from overpowering everything. Again, we all loved this. I made it for the family but it'd make an excellent dish for a party.

These are fantastic.  I was concerned about the combination of asparagus and cilantro but WOW was it good.  I made these with corn tortillas and it was still really good although I think flour would be better.  Highly recommended and of course so easy to prepare!

These were really good, but I need to try them again. I used the entire 4oz of goat cheese as the recipe calls for. This was way to much as goat cheese very easily overpowers other flavors. I love goat cheese, but I couldn't even taste the asparagus, which I had sauteed in garlic. So I will definitely try again but use way less of the goat cheese per quesadila.

I never thought to put goat cheese on a quesadilla. Trader Joe's had the herbed goat cheese at a good price. I completely tweaked this though. I left out the cilantro and subbed the 1/2 lb of asparagus with the garlic spinach recipe from the site. I used Trader Joes tortillas, my favorite. I will try the asparagus the next time. The only thing is, I am not sure how 2 tortillas feeds 4. I guess I was hungry, I ate 1 and a half.

Tried this as a culinary adventure, and it was delicious! We did add garlic to the asparagus and oil, as well as dipped it in a Balsamic Vinaigrette -- made it delicious!

Sorry, we love goat cheese and asparagus, but the herbed goat cheese didn't do it for us...perhaps without the herbs...

This was a fantastic and very easy recipe. My husband is not a vegetable eater, let alone asparagus, but I finally got him to try it and he absolutely loved it. He loved it so much, he was asking for more! I will definitely make these again!

This recipe is DELICIOUS!! We tried this recipe just tonight. Excellent. We used herbed goat cheese with chives & onions. We also used, mexican cheese to sprinkle on top. And also added chopped green onion. I would recommend this recipe to anyone that likes asparagus.

Delicious; wonderful way to serve asparagus! Made these for lunch for hubby and me. I made his on flour tortillas and mine on corn tortillas. For the mix, I used feta cheese instead of goat cheese, and sauteed some minced garlic and onion together with the asparagus.

This was a great lunch fix! I didn't have any cilantro but I think the herbed cheese was great on its own. I steamed and shocked the asperagus before doing it in the pan with salt & pepper. The only thing I would do differently next time is cut the asperagus into smaller peices! Boyfriend LOVED it.

I really thought that these would be good.  Unfortunately, they weren't.  I'm not even sure what could be added to help them!  I love goat cheese and asparagus. Combo was dry.  Really dry.  I'd recommend skipping this one.

Nice way to work asparagus into a meal!  I only had plain goat cheese so I was liberal with the cilantro, salt and pepper.  Instead of brushing olive oil on the folded tortilla, I just sprayed each side with canola oil and they browned beautifully. My daughter asked for seconds!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It tastes really healthy (not sure if it is since it is full of goat cheese), and the mixture of asparagus, cilantro and feta is awesome. 

I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, and was impressed.  

When I'm looking for a vegetarian meal that is not greasy, I will make this again.

I really enjoyed these.  They were delicious and pretty easy to make.

But I can't give them 5 stars, because my husband really did not like them.  

I followed the recipe exactly, but if I make them again, I think I will try plain goat cheese rather than herbed.  They have so much cilantro in them that they really don't need the additional herbs.

I used feta instead of the goat cheese...  the flavor was wonderful so it gets 5 stars but my cooking abilities are lacking so it's my own fault that they didn't stay together when I flipped them in the skillet.  I will try this again and hopefully master the art of flipping quesadillas in a skillet.

In the words of my 4 year old..."Double Yum!"

Very good.  Made a few adjustments:  While I love cilantro, I was a bit dubious about putting it with asparagus, so I replaced it with some fresh rosemary.  I also substituted brie cheese for the goat cheese.  The result was a wonderful, subtle blend of creamy flavors.  Mmmm!

Went well with a glass of Moscato.

This recipe was my inspiration but I roasted the asparagus at 400 for 10 min.  The asparagus was put in a glass 9X11 pan and tossed in EVOO with salt, pepper , garlic and grated parm...I used used Kraft.  Once done I spread the goat cheese on the tortilla and added the chopped asparagus with the drippings from the pan it was roasted in and added green onions.  It was delicious.  Next time with add mushrooms for a delicious healthy meal.  Thanks for the idea!

These were so great. We each ate a whole quesadilla, and I honestly could have eaten two. Big fan!

I really liked this recipe. If you don't like goat cheese this isn't for you. I made it once with herbed goat cheese and once with plain goat cheese which wasn't great.

Added garlic to the asparagus as cooking.  Did not fold over just used 6" tortillas and put goat cheese on both tortillas.  Excellent.  Loved the flavours.  
Served with Waldorf Salad II from this site.  Nice compliment.

Recipe was easy, flavorful and tasty!  Perfect for a simple,  quick meal.  You definitely have  to love goat cheese, though.

I added mushrooms and used whole wheat tortillas to make it a bit healthier. Also I cut the asparagus smaller and cooked them longer because if they're too crunchy it ruins the whole quesadilla. Great recipe!

These were very easy & quick to make & tgey gave me a little something to make with leftover goat cheese. I copied recipe as stated and my hubby & even 1 1/2 year old loved them. Good, strong flavors, so make sure you're a fan of goat cheese & asparagus. Also, I have to admit, I wasn't sure about the cilantro, but it helped balance out the flavors & went very well with it.

My husband even had seconds, and he's a meat & potatoes guy! I did add tomatoes and a small amount of bacon.

Pretty good. I used too much goat cheese; a thin layer with an added layer of cheddar made these phenomenal.

This was a delicious recipe, although I added 4 cloves of minced garlic while satueeing the asparagus, skipped on the cilantro, and used less goat cheese than called for in the recipe.  I created my own herbed goat cheese by adding an herb mixture to regular spreadable goat cheese.  My whole family, including two young kids will eat this, and my hubby and I absolutely LOVE this dish!
