This is a great way to utilize a turkey breast.  We cooked it this evening, and it was plenty for our family of three.  The spices were perfect, and the gravy was an excellent compliment.  Throw in some chopped root vegetables to roast at the same time, add a green salad, and you've got a fantastic Fall meal!!

This was great and really easy to do.  I have never made gravy before, but using this recipe it turned out good (I did not use the half and half in my gravy, although I may try it in the future).  I could not find the exact cut of meat called for, so all I had was a 2 lb boneless, skinless turkey breast.  I did make the same amount of butter mixture and rubbed it all over the outside of the turkey breast.  My turkey did not take very long at all to cook, only about 40 minutes or so.  I used the leftover turkey and gravy in a pot pie the next day.

I made this tonight. Without any prompting, my husband said he really liked it. Huge! I followed the recipe exactly.  The gravy was great too!  I would like to say that if you have the 3 lb turkey breast (Mine was Butterball brand) that comes with the netting wrapped around it, if you take the netting off, the breast loses shape. I had to re-tie with string and while it did not look as good as the turkey breast usually looks, it cooked great. It was very moist and tender and tasted wonderful too. Next time, I will not remove the netting and will just rub the outside and maybe inject the butter mix inside under the skin with my injecter set.  My injecter needle is large, so I don't think it will be clogged using my jarred minced garlic. Since it is only the 2 of us eating, I will use the lefover turkey and gravy to make a turkey pot pie this week.  I saw several good recipes on this site for that. (I served with rice and salad.  The gravy was great on the rice too!) Thanks for giving us a recipe that adds flavor to an old favorite!

This was the best Roast Turkey Breast recipe I've ever tried. I used exactly what the recipe stated but doubled the amounts because the breast was almost 6 lbs. It took about two and a half hours to cook, and I kept the tented foil on for the first 2 hours. I basted it probably 3 times during cooking, and kept most of the drippings, (not just 1-2 Tbsp), to make the gravy. 
   It turned out fantastic-juicy, tasty, and an incredible gravy, which I used the next night for Turkey and Gravy in pastry shells. So much easier than cooking the whole bird, and not a scrap was leftover.

The 3lb bone in breast took about 1.5hr at 350. It cooked it perfectly. I wasn't going to make the gravy because I had to open a bottle of wine and I bought pre-packaged gravy, but I made it anyways. This is some of the best gravy I ever tasted, and I made it.

Perfect!  I added an extra clove of garlic and used smoked paprika instead of regular paprika (smoked paprika is the BOMB).  I also roasted it over some veggies: an onion, celery and parsnips.  Everything including the gravy was delicious!!  Note: I cooked the turkey for slightly longer than 1 1/2 hours to brown the skin.

I had 2 turkey breasts about 1.7 lb each, since I couldn't find a 3lb breast in the store.  I replaced the paprika, italian seasoning and Mrs. Dash with 3 sprigs of thyme and 1 sprig of rosemary, all finely chopped.  I didn't save half the butter for later, but put it all on at the beginning and just basted with pan juices.  I also used the shallot at the beginning in the butter mixture.   The times provided in the recipe was perfect for me, and the meat was wonderfully tender. For the gravy, I used almost ALL the drippings, and I used chicken stock (not cream), which gave me a lot of delicious gravy.  (And today, I used up the gravy, along with leftover turkey and leftover stuffing, to make a turkey pot pie.)

I made this recipe tonight for dinner and it was fabulous.  The gravy was especially good - I did use all the drippings instead of just a tablespoon and that was a good thing as my family finished it all! Also, I am gluten free so I used cornstarch instead of flour (1.5 tlb for instead of 3 tlbs. My turkey breast was still slightly frozen so it took about an hour longer.  I removed the foil for the last hour to brown the breast.  Great recipe.  Will make again.

Just made the turkey without the gravy; it was a very moist turkey breast.  Great for a weeknight meal, or sandwiches.

Fabulous!  So moist and tender.  I cooked this turkey breast for Thanksgiving.  Very easy recipe.  I will use again.  I baked the turkey in my cast iron pan, and when turkey reached 165*, I removed it from pan and made gravy with drippings.

This was so delicious. I used a 6 pound turkey breast so I pretty much doubled the recipe. I used all the pan dripping though, but did scoop out as much excess oil as I could. The meat was tender and so flavorful. I can't wait to use the left overs for sandwiches.

Very good! Made this for a Pre Holiday fix, now that the time of year is here. And I was looking for something to go with the Squash Gratin I had made (Kabocha snd Butternut) Perfect together! only four stars because I cooked to instructed time and temp and it could have been cooked a little longer for tenderness purposes.

Being Easter week, everyone has ham and turkey breast on sale, so I made one of each to portion out & freeze.  I came upon this recipe for the turkey breast and really love it.  The mixture of spices plus the wine plus the cream makes a very flavorful gravy.

As others suggested, I roasted a quartered sweet onion and some celery in with the turkey breast (I left them in large chunks so they would not burn or overcook during the long roasting time).

When done, I cut up the roasted onion and celery, and sauteed them in the butter and fat before starting the gravy.  I used all of the fat and all the drippings, and up-sized the recipe so I would have plenty of gravy to freeze for later.

This is definitely a keeper.

I have never made a turkey before so I was a little nervous at first. My husband says this was one of the best turkeys he has ever eaten and insisted that I save the recipe.

This was an easy recipe.  My turkey was moist and beautifully browned.  I discovered that my turkey was a 5 pound breast so I followed the timing on the packaging.  I only basted once at 1 hour and kept the breast on a roasting rack, covered loosely with foil.  As my bird was larger, I used a whole stick of butter and did not measure the seasoning. I just did it by taste.  My Mrs. Dash was old so I added some Sazon Completa by Badia.  I minced a few tops of a green onion instead of a shallot and I used a splash of a dry red wine.  The gravy was thick so I added the half and half which helped. My family really enjoyed the turkey.

Turkey breast came out moist and delicious; my personal best. The seasoned butter under the skin must be the trick. I used regular unsalted butter, no Ms. Dash; just increased the other spices, and white onion rather than shallot for the gravy, which was very good and easy to make. Will be making this again.

this is fantastic! i recommend moving your thermometer to a few different spots to make sure that your turkey is completely cooked through!
i laid my turkey breast on top of diced onion, carrots, and celery in a shallow pan. i rinsed and dried the turkey and then coated under the skin and all around the turkey with the butter mixture.
i cooked on 450* for 30 mins then turned it down to 350* until the internal temp was 160*. i let rest for about 15-20 mins then carved and it was delicious!

Juicy, tender, delicious!  Only thing I changed was using fresh rosemary and parsley with garlic as the only herbs from my garden.  Because turkey breast I bought was five lbs., roast time was 2.5 hrs.  Looking forward to leftovers this week for my guy and me.  Thank you for posting this recipe. Will definitely be making this again.

Excellent start. Changed herbs to sage thyme and made an under the skin compound butter. Gravy easy and full of flavor. Better yet the cooking time and temperature are right on point. Would recommend this recipe for any new to the kitchen cook.

I was pleased with how this recipe turned out. The sauce was more bland than I expected, but I also forgot to add the wine and didn't use cream. Will definitely try again but will tweak the seasonings in the sauce.

As I suspected, adding the flour to the gravy as described led to clumps of raw flour throughout. You are better off making a roux with the  butter/turkey grease first then adding in wine (I was much more generous than a splash) followed by the broth or stock. The taste of the gravy was however very good. I boosted the flavor by adding in some of the baste mix (that had not touched the raw turkey) to deepen the color and make for a complex gravy taste. The turkey was quite delicious with these seasonings.

De-lish! I made a 4#11oz turkey breast (1/2 breast) with wing on. While I did not measure the exact ingredients, the flavour was incredibly good. I did rub the seasoned butter under the skin and over the entire top and loosely covered with foil. After 30 minutes, I added a couple of spoonfuls of the season butter over the top and then poured over 1/4 cup straight orange juice, retented with the foil and back into the oven. After the second 30 minutes, I did the same thing but left the the turkey breast UNcovered for the rest of the cooking time. I repeated the butter mixture followed by 1/4-1/2 cup of orange juice one last time. Total time roasting was 90 minutes which was perfect. As for the gravy, I prefer 'au jus', no thickening agents at all, adjusted the seasoning and reduced slightly on the stove top.
I loved the flavour of the seasoned butter with the orange juice, which was a very slight flavour and did not overwhelm at all.

My husband is the only meat eater here, so for holidays, he misses out on a turkey feast.  I made this tonight and he loved it, and it can be modified down to a small turkey breast that he can handle over a couple meals.  He loved it, made it just as it read, now food coma for him!

While the turkey was wonderful no one would eat the gravy. I think that a better ratio would be 2 tbs fat, 2 tbs flour to 1 cup of chicken stock, as written its just too thick. In the future I would cook the shallots in a skillet then make a roux, deglaze the roaster with the wine  while scraping up all of the flavour bits from the bottom of the pan then add the roux mixture. Thanks for sharing.

My turkey turned out delicious! I make a great turkey anyway but was looking for something just a little different so I thought I'd try this and am glad I did. I used a 7 lb. turkey breast and the only thing I left out was the paprika. Also, I didn't make the gravy because I made my own tried and true recipe but as for the turkey it was wonderful!

Followed directions then lowered to 325 til the thermometer indicated 170 and the temperature indicator poped. About 40 more minutes. I forgot the wine for the gravy so I drank it with the meal. I did not have shallot so used onions. Gravy was better on baked potatoes than on turkey. It seemed like a lot of work. Possibly because of all the pans, bowls, dishes, utensils I used.  Turkey is always work for me but tastes good. If it had been a whole bird I would have used a Reynolds turkey bag.

I had a 7 lb turkey breast, so I doubled the ingredients.  I just used water instead of chicken broth and wine.  I didn't have any shallot, but I used the remainder of the ingredients listed.  I cooked it one hour on high and 7 hours on low in the crock pot.  Very delicious and  very tender.

Since there is only 2 of us, yet even when others come calling over the Holidays, this recipe is so adaptable!  I made it following the directions yet cutting the salt to 1/4 of the amount, as I also placed a chicken bullion cube under the chicken breast while roasting it.  I also cut the paprika to half the amount, not being sure how strong it might make it.  I had no shallot, so I used a small sweet onion instead.  I wanted a clear gravy so I did not use the half and half.  

Otherwise all the other ingredients and methodology was used.  OMG!  It was so tender and juicy...so flavorful.  The results of this recipe were the best turkey I have ever done!  I did have to double the cooking time as it was a larger turkey breast.  The amounts of the other ingredients were fine.   I also was surprised over the juiciness of this recipe...I am convinced it rates even higher than a five!

This was great!   I did a  bone in Turkey breast. I made some of the paste butter fresh or salt pepper as directed  & rubbed it all over and under the skin of the bird.  Gravy came out wonderful because of all the great flavors. Thank you again allrecipes.com 
 Happy Thanksgiving to you all!

This was good. I had to change it up a bot because we decided to  go to a movie so I put it in the crock pot on high for 3 hrs, then put it in the oven at the recommended temp. I was very moist and had a good flavor!

Delicious and we're not huge turkey lovers. I changed up herbs according to what I had in the pantry, but on a general basis it was close. I had a 1.79 lb bone-in half turkey breast and had to roast for 1 hour 15 min. The gravy was really good and worth the extra effort. However, I only had to use about half the flour and didn't use the half and half. It doesn't need it. Next time....a BIT more than a splash of wine.

This was phenomenal. Increased seasonings by half for a 7 lb breast to keep the flavors “light” for the little ones. Used smoked paprika and a rotisserie chicken seasoning for the garlic herb blend because that’s what I had. Subbed a mix of garlic and onion for the shallot for the same reason. I can’t say enough about this recipe. Husband and daughter had seconds and the grandchildren cleaned their plates. Had to thin out the remaining gravy with some broth to extend the gravy to have with leftovers. Yes, it was that good. This is a new favorite!

First time making just a turkey breast for my Hubby and me.  Made it exactly like the recipe (always have Mrs. Dash on hand, just added a little extra Italian seasoning for our personal tastes )...SO tasty and juicy...definitely not dry.  Made the gravy, too...again, very tasty.  Will make again!

It was all right. Nothing to write home about. Overall, it was kind of plain. I was surprised, because it is rated so high, but ultimately, beyond the basic turkey  flavor, there was but much more beyond that.

The turkey breast came out moist and tender, but there was less than one tablespoon of drippings, not nearly enough to make gravy. Luckily I had some packaged gravy on hand. I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, being alone this year I used a !/2  fresh turkey breast, not a full one. I'd make it this way again.

Yes, I will make this again!!! I did make some changes due to my dietary restrictions. Which consist of no salt and using Mrs. Dash instead :)

This is now my go to recipe for bone-in turkey breast. It is amazing how juicy and tender the meat is. Just wish the skin would be crispier.

My turkey breast is in the first part of cooking now.  I am writing to ask for hints on how to actually get the seasoned butter to STICK to the turkey breast skin.  Not sure if my bird or my hands were too cold but all I succeeded in accomplishing was to get the seasoned butter all over every single finger, my mini spatula and numerous paper towels as well as my microwave door and controls when I finally decided to melt the butter slightly so I could brush it on. I made a second batch of the butter.. will "baste" with it in 20 mins.   This is a trial run for our Thanksgiving dinner. in two weeks so I really want to get this right.  I am using a 7.4 lbs breast and doubled ingredients (for each batch of butter spread I made) THANKS for any TIPs anyone can provide.  jgcorpex4@yahoo.com

I made it pretty much to the recipe but was missing shallots and white wine.  Turkey was very moist and the drippings made a very flavorful gravy .

Definitely 5 stars as well as something you can make year round … essentially followed recipe adding a little more chardonnay, roasted garlic and homemade “mojo” … Major crowd pleaser. Outstanding pan juices for the gravy!

The recipe was great, but a little more involved than it needed to be.  Previously I have done turkey breasts by seasoning with salt, Pepper and other basic seasonings along with a rub of olive oil and butter. Those turkey breast have turned out pretty much the same as this more involved recipe

This is a delicious & easy recipe! It's wonderful as is, which is how I make it for my family. I have easily modified it when hosting dinners where some attending is gluten & dairy free and it was just as delicious.

This was wonderful. I had a 8.5 lb bone in turkey breast so I doubled the other ingredients but used less butter to cut some fat. I baked it in my cast iron dutch oven with the lid slightly vented. It turned out delicious. This is one of our new favorites.

3.5 Stars - only because my 7.5 lb turkey breast was done in less than 3 hours which put me at a disadvantage since none of my side dishes were ready.  Still very tasty and moist.

Cooking time was perfect.   Didn't use salt substitute as they are bad for people with kidney disease.   Also mad our own usual gravy with drippings, chicken stock, corn starch, Worcestershire, and black pepper.

So great! Easy to make with loads of flavour. I reserved about half of the au jus for the next night, thickened it with some corn starch and made hot turkey sandwiches. Most amazing turkey sandwich. I will definitely make this again.

Made the turkey breast exactly as instructed and it turned out fantastic! The best turkey breast I've had that wasn't brined! I used turkey fat instead of butter for the gravy and I added the 3 tbspns of flour directly to the pan once the onions were translucent, creating a roux before adding in the turkey broth (which is subbed for the chicken broth). I added some salt to taste after the gravy was off the pan, which turned out just fine. Next time I'll add the salt and pepper to the pan after I add the broth. Overall an excellent recipe!

The family loved it. Had a 7lb breast and used a Thermapen for cooking accuracy. Took three hours to cook and basted with the leftover butter mixture allowing for it to be Beautifully browned and everyone commented on the flavor and how tender it was. Unlike most cooks I went totally by the recipe but did not make the gravy. Definitely recommend

Thanksgiving food is great and all, but I was always underwhelmed by the turkey. That is, until we tried your amazing recipe. Aw, man, it is so good. We didn’t have Mrs. Dash so left it out, and I have to admit I was skeptical about putting Italian seasoning on

This is the perfect herbed rub! The Turkey breast was one that I raised. What a tribute to it using this recipe.  I followed it to a T. The gravy was perfect and full of flavor. I raised the herbs also. Thank you for this recipe as I will use it for the rest of the bird also. The Turkey was 40#'s so I cut it up and froze it in several packages.

Amazingly delicious — but abandoned ship on the gravy portion of the recipe. Turkey breast was fantastic. I did brine the turkey breast overnight using vegetable stock, kosher salt, herbs, that I also found on allrecipes. At the last minute, we also decided to add more garlic by inserting into small slits on top. Yum.

The turkey was delicious! I used a boneless turkey breast and the cook time was less than indicated in recipe. We just did the baste when the breast reached ~125-130F (used a meat thermometer). I didn’t realize the recipe called for garlic & herb seasoning and googled Mrs. Dash to see what’s in it—only ingredients I left out were the fennel, coriander, cumin, mustard, carrot, and whatever spice extractives are. Very moist and just enough flavor from the seasonings for the turkey breast. Heck, we’d make this turkey for dinner any day of the week! Gravy instructions were confusing to me, but I tried to somewhat follow it. It definitely is going to be too thick as written though. I deglazed the roasting pan with a little chicken stock as a substitute for the white wine. Strained into a saucepan and rapidly whisked in 2 tbsp flour just until it was smoothe and no flour clumps, over medium-low heat. Slowly stirred in the 1 cup chicken stock; reduced heat to low and it continued to thicken a bit too much for my liking, but is easily remedied by adding in more liquid to thin out more as needed. Next time, I would just saute the shallot in 2 tbsp of the fat (no butter; use a separator); then whisk in 2 tbsp flour; add in remaining drippings after deglaze (don’t waste those brown bits and goodness) and 1 cup stock or more as needed to reach desired gravy consistency. Overall, great recipe for the turkey, but the gravy or directions for it needs some work.

I made the mistake of using the Italian seasoning, garlic, shallot, herb seasoning salt (that had salt within), paprika and 1 tablespoon olive oil. I brushed this over the skin, inside the cavity. I texted and refrigerated overnight. When I prepared in the oven, mixed all of herbs I used above with 1 tablespoon butter for basting. I never made gravy, used flour, cooking wine or broth. It was absolutely flavorful through and through. It was moist and extremely tender. It didn't brown as much as I would have liked, but my turkey and chickens never do.

I highly recommend this. It will be my go to way of preparation from this point forward.

This was SO yummy! I think I’ve only ever made gravy two times before and it was never as good as this one! I used a boneless turkey breast and it cut the cook time down by 20 minutes .It was a big “Thanksgiving in July “ hit!!

Made this recipe yesterday and followed direction as written except my turkey breast was only 2 1/4 lbs.  so I lowered oven temperature to 340F. Oh, I also didn't have a shallot but I did have spring onions so that is what I used (white parts only) Flavours were wonderful and recipe was very easy, including the gravy. I will make this again when I get the next hankering for turkey without all the big turkey fuss. I also used the bone to make a small amount of turkey broth by adding water, celery, carrot, garlic and onion tops. Thanks for sharing.

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly. My son begged me to make 2 of them next time.  With the left overs I made him a sandwich to take to work and he wished I would have made him 2.  The turkey was so flavorful and the gravy was perfect!

I didn't have to make any changes at all. The turkey was amazingly moist and even my gravy came out great for one of the first times ever. It couldn't have been easier or any more stress free. I will make this again for even a non special occasion.

Very moist turkey breast. Took about 1 hr 50 minutes for a 3.5 pound breast. Gravy was good, but  to us not the "best ever" as some other reviewers claimed. Made it with commercial turkey broth instead of chicken broth, so that may be part of the difference.  Easy to prepare.

Made this for our annual Christmas Dinner Buffalo Bills tailgate meal. Substituted Adobo for the salt, added a teaspoon of dried chopped onion, and I heated the basting solution during prep, adding 3 TBS of butter to stretch the basting solution for the 1 hour mark. Very quick prep and the cook time for the two breasts I prepared was perfect.

My family and I absolutely loved this recipe. The turkey breast  had was close to 6.5 lbs.  I doubled the recipe, basting several times throughout cooking. I cooked it about 2.5 hours. I took the cover off of the pan for the last half hour. I used all of the drippings  and followed the rest of the directions for the gravy. I did leave out the extra butter because I had more than enough from the basting The turkey is so moist and delicious, and the gravy is amazing! I will definitely make this one again.

I brined  deboned the turkey breast overnight. From that point forward I followed the recipe am disappointed the end result was a succulent meal we greatly enjoyed. In fact we had turkey club sandwiches the following evening with the leftovers.

Absolutely delicious! Wow, this recipe is amazing. I did change only one thing, and that was the wine in the gravy. Replaced it with white grape juice with lemon for a non-alcoholic dish, and tastes really good! Will definitely use again!

One of the moistest and best flavored turkeys I've ever had and quite easy! Used fresh rosemary, thyme and a bit of sage, and mixed with the butter ahead of time. Roasted in a coq au vin pan with onions and celery, which added good flavor to the gravy and probably helped with the moisture. 5.8 pound bone in was done in 90-105 minutes and fed family of four with about another meal leftovers. Next time I need to watch a video about how to carve it, mine was a mess!

Salted turkey breast for two days, then cooked it on a broiler pan with water in the bottom.  One of the most  flavorful and juiciest I've had.

This came out terrific! I did add about 1/4 c white wine to the roasting pan to help keep turkey moist & kept breast covered with foil until the last 45 minutes of roasting. Loved the gravy! I made it without 1/2 & 1/2 & it was a hit. I will definitely make this again.

Usually I make turkey breasts in the slow cooker, but I wanted to try making one in the oven. I followed this recipe pretty closely. I added carrots, onion and celery to the roasting pan. I also used Sherry instead of white wine for the gravy. This turned out great. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for Easter dinner and it turned out great! Cooking time was spot on and it turned out perfectly. I served it with roasted potatoes, steamed vegetables and croissants, so the meal wasn't super heavy. Would definitely recommend this recipe!

Very delicious. I think there are a few mistakes in the original recipe listed...should be that shallots are sauteed until translucent, not opaque.  I added fresh thyme sprigs under the skin (would have also added fresh rosemary if I would have had it), used a bit less paprika than was called for, and used corn starch for the gravy instead of flour.  Very moist and flavorful.  Will definitely make again!

I made the turkey breast only. Did not make the gravy. My husband and I loved it! It was moist, juicy, and flavorful and sooooooooooo easy, no brining. I think the key is having an instant read digital meat thermometer, and check temp often. Take out of oven as soon as it reaches 165 F, then let it rest.

I loved this. The turkey turned out very moist and delicious! I used 1/4 tsp of seasoned salt instead of Mrs Dash, mostly because I didn't have any Mrs Dash. Everyone was really pleased with the flavor, we will definitely have this one again.

Made for Thanksgiving instead of a traditional big bird.  Was absolutely fabulous.  Moist, tender, um.  Only thing different is mine took 1:45 instead of 1:35 to reach 165 temp (no bone) but could've just been my old oven.  I will definitely make again.  Who says turkey has to only be for Thanksgiving?  Also depending on your side dishes, 3lbs of Turkey which has virtually no waste can feed up to 4 or more people.

I roasted a bone in breast. I didn't make the gravy as a packet was included with the turkey. This turkey was moist and delicious. I brined my Thanksgiving turkey last year and this better and much less work!

I had a 6 LB bone in turkey breast... pretty much just doubled seasonings and added extra pepper! Used a meat thermometer to make sure it was done. I was out of tin foil so I used a covered roasting pan, took lid off for the last hour. Amazingly juicy, tender and full of flavor. Will use this recipe again! ( oh, forgot to mention I didn't make the gravy, just the turkey)

Delicious! My store didn't have a turkey breast with skin so I made this with a skinless piece of meat. It was still very moist and very, very tasty. I added a few extra minutes to the cooking time. Next time, I won't baste after an hour unless my next piece of turkey breast has the skin. The butter melted and essentially slid right off the meat. I'll just cook the meat for 90 minutes straight if I use another skinless piece of meat. Great recipe! The leftovers made for awesome sandwiches too!

I used turkey tenderloin (no skin) because the store did not have any bone in. The three pounds cooked in an hour. It was delicious .

Disappointing.   Followed recipe exactly and turkey was dry and kind of gummy.
