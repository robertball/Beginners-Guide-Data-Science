This dip was a great hit!!I was in charge of snacks for our Lions club meeting and since St Patrick's Day is this weekend thought we should have food celebrating it.  I remembered a friend making a dip with sauerkraut.  My search lead me to this recipe.  It was easy to shop for and quick and simple to prepare!  For heating, I chose to microwave but would also consider using my small crockpot.  I served butter and wheat crackers since I had them on hand.  Several members asked for the recipe.  I would definitely make this again!!

Good.  I also rinsed kraut with water and drained.  Helps reduce sodium a bit.

So easy and absolutely delicious. Heated in microwave as recommended by another reviewer and it was perfect. Used a mini-chopper to chop the corned beef and cheese, worked beautifully. After heating, put mixture in mini--crockpot (2 quart from Target) to keep warm during the party.

Loved it - didn't change a thing.  I didn't have the salad dressing so found a recipe on All Recipe which was great.

First I've made this and it was really good!  Only added a little more Thousand Island dressing, otherwise followed the recipe as it is written.  Will definitely make this again!
