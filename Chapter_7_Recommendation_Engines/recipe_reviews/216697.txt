Great!  Here in Western PA, the cabbage, onions & noodles are usually called haluski.  The addition of kielbasa makes this a one dish meal.

Easy to make, love one dish meals, but it was a little bland. I expected this so I added some freshly diced garlic, and a little bit of Lawrys. Like another reviewer I boiled my egg noodles in beef stock. Also, as I was eating it, it occurred to me that with the egg noodles and the pierogies (which I lightly browned first) it was a little too noodley. I think I'd like it better with some baby red potatoes instead of pierogies, and some more seasoning.

Love it.  I cooked the noodles with some Beef bullion,  and added broth to the cabbage as suggested.   I can't wait until next seas on to cook it for my next steelers game at my house.  Go Steelers!

Really good! I knew this would make a lot so I cut it back to 1/2 bag of noodles, 1 box pierogies, and 1 LB cabbage with the smoked sausage. I didn't have a skillet big enough- so after frying the sliced smoked sausage, I combined that with the cooked noodles in a large crockpot. I then fried up the cabbage and onions in the sausage drippings-- gave the cabbage a nice flavor, added boiled pierogies until heated through. I combined everything in the crockpot & left it on keep warm until it was time to eat. My husband said it didn't look like it would be any good but then RAVED about it! Would be good to take to a potluck as written.

Just finished it. Love it I added a little olive oil in with the butter. It seemed like there would be no sauce, but it was perfect. I had to sub chantrelle mushroom ravioli,  my local store doesn't carry perogies. Looking forward to using the perogies.

This was a quick meal for supper, this would be good on a winters day in a roaster pan for a tailgate party. I used ball park franks and andouille sausage, it's what i had on hand & worked great, I just grilled them first then added to my pot of noodles, cabbage, and small red potatoes that i par boiled first.

This made a lot! It was really good. I had a big head of cabbage to use up and was looking for something different. I loved all of the components and it was very easy to assemble. My only oops was that I should have browned or boiled the pierogies first because they were fresh and just came out mushy in the pot. Next time I won't do that! Thx susiets & thanks to my buzzer friend Molly for the recommendation!

I was looking at recipes, and saw the title of this one. My son is a HUGE Steeler fan so I thought, what the heck Ill try it. I told my husband what I was making and he was less than impressed when he heard what it was. Once I finished cooking it, and we were seated down watching FOOTBALL eating this dish, my husband said. Ill have to get some more of that., he went on to say, I wasn't too sure about it BUT its REALLY, REALLY good. SO HUGE success. LOVE this recipe WILL MAKE IT AGAIN.  I added a can of beef broth to it. Only alteration I made. Simply FANTASTIC.

If you need a delicious meal that feeds a lot, this is your recipe.  I made this as written with the only addition being that I cooked the noodles in beef stock.  I knew from the ingredients that this was going to make a very large amount.  I decided to use the wok as it is very wide and I knew it would accommodate everything, it worked perfectly.  While cooking I did add about ½ cup of the beef stock that I cooked the noodles in to give it a little more moisture while the meat and pierogies were browning.  I served this with fresh diced tomatoes and sour cream.  We loved it and I MOST definitely will be making this one again.

Just finished eating it.  My husband loved it.  I added a little extra butter and had to use full size Pierogie since that was all I could find in our southern grocery store.  (I am from the Pittsburgh area and thought this sounded scrumptious.  It was!  We will have it again.

This recipe made very large amount of food. Good flavor, the only thing I might change is adding more meat and cooking the pierogies prior to placing them with the rest of the food to get a crisp shell. Most certainly making this again.

This was delicious!!! I used regular sized pierogis and boiled them according to package directions before adding them.  I think sauteing the onions in bacon grease would add a good flavor and a little saltiness, which would be good.  Even our picky kids liked this, and we will definitely add it to our regular rotation!

I substituted kale for cabbage, whole wheat pasta for noodles, hot links for kielbasa and meatballs for pierogis. Was limited by what they sell at Trader Joe’s. And then added sour cream, smoked Gouda and feta. Had some in the fridge. Probably made it a completely different recipe but it was sooooooooioo good.

I just made this.  It was pretty good.  It did lack flavor.  Next time I will do as suggested by others, and cook the noodles in beef broth, add a little Worcestershire sauce and add some bacon. It makes a lot of food, I need a bigger pan!!

This is a stellar recipe! I didn't use perogies, but I definitely will next time. I've made this now every week and has been added into a weekly menu. This was a smash hit, family and friends loved it. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My boyfriend is from Pittsburgh and die hard Steelers fan. I made this to surprise him, yet he, his family or friends (all from Pittsburgh) never heard of this recipe. We were not amazed with a big mush this was. It was edible but not something  that's presentable.

Loved this! I used a wok and kept things warm in the crockpot as I cooked them. I browned the kielbasa in butter, removed with slotted spoon then browned the pierogies in the remaining butter. Removed those then added more butter and sautéed the onions until soft. Once they were cooked I mixed in the cabbage and cooked about 15 minutes until tender. Like other reviewers I added about a cup of beef broth to the cabbage onion mixture. I also boiled the noodles in beef broth. It was very flavorful!

This was a good, inexpensive, quick meal. My grocery store doesn't carry mini perogies so I had no choice but to omit them. It's a tad bit bland, but I added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce and a clove of chopped garlic. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe so many times, I am starting to loose count.  It is a great lunch and keeps well.  Follow the recipe exact or don't it still comes out well.  I have added extra cabbage, I have gone with both mini and full sized pierogis (depending on what the store has on sale), and I have used multiple versions of kielbasa, brat, or cooked sausage.  VERY versatile and always great!

The only thing missing is bacon! Halushki (at least the way I was taught) is cabbage, bacon and noodles.

I was excited to try this recipe . . . first problem was that I cut the heck out of my finger cutting up the cabbage.  Second problem was that I didn't read the recipe correctly and used a whole bag of noodles instead of a half a bag and I only used one box of pierogies.  Oops!  I also didn't have a big enough pan to mix it all together, so I ended up putting it in a large baking pan and finished up cooking it in the oven.  I also made a few other changes: I used Bratwurst instead of Kielbasa and I added a bag of shredded Colby Jack cheese.  The overall result was very good, but seemed a tiny bit dry and was way too much food!  I ended up freezing a large batch and hopefully it will reheat ok another day.  I still have another container full for leftovers for tomorrow.  I'm not sure what I could have added to make it more moist . . . maybe some milk?  Obviously, if I had used the right amount of noodles it would have been less dry.  Oh well . . . that's what I get for cooking at home on Valentine's Day instead of going out to eat!
