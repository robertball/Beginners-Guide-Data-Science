Bowties & Italian Sausage Haiku: "Taste was way too 'beige', no sauce to cling to pasta, would need additions." I made this as directed (except used a frozen bag of tri-color bell pepper/onion blend), and we felt that the bowties tasted just like ... bowties, they didn't really absorb flavor, or allow any of the flavors to adhere to their surface. And cutting Italian sausage links into bite-sized pieces is very time-consuming; I would recommend browning the links whole, then removing to cut, b/c I think it took me longer than the suggested prep-time to cut them, even having removed the casings as well. The 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning and sausage just didn't provide enough flavor for us, so we used crushed red pepper, parmesan and salt at the table. My husband said "this 'feels' like a healthy meal, but I don't think it really is, so it's fooling me into eating more than I should", whereas my daughter said "it needs tomato sauce." I think I agree w/ both of them. Enjoyable to try, but not necessarily one that I'd make again.

Definitely a good beginning for a nice meal.  But....seems like nothing adhered to the pasta.  I made it a second time and added 2 Tbsp of tomato paste, some parmesan cheese, 3 chopped garlic cloves and some capers to add a little zing.  Turned out better than the first go round.  I think the oil and the fat from the sausage keeps the remaining ingredients from mixing well.  Also, I used diced tomatoes with italian seasoning.  Play around with this recipe.  It's a "saving beginning."

I've made this with the following adjustments:
*omitted olive oil: you don't need it b/c the sausage creates its own oil as it cooks. The extra oil just adds more grease.*add pepper. Personally, I prefer to use individual seasonings instead of the Italian seasoning mix...but that's just me. *add fresh garlic or garlic powder. *add oregano. *add parsley. *add a bit of fresh grated Parmesan at the end.

I also drained most of the water from the tomatoes b/c you don't need that much water, & as the tomatoes cook they release water.

Once you add your personal touches it's a great recipe...fast and delicious.

Quick, easy, good flavor, and the kids loved it!  I used Primo sausage and Hunts diced tomatoes with basil, oregano, and garlic, and didn't add any additional Italian seasonings.  Didn't have any fresh bell peppers in the house, so I pulled out a few jarred roasted peppers that I had.  Since I used a 16oz box of pasta, I added a little extra water to help cook the pasta after I added it to the broth.  If I had more broth, I would have used that instead.

Great flavor, colors, textures.  I added grated garlic, capers and black olives.  We liked the lighter sauce and the technique of simmering the half-cooked pasta in the sauce.  Other additions could include mushrooms, spinach & dried tomatoes.  This is a guest worthy dinner that's easy to prepare.

We've been making this for years... only difference is that we do not use peppers - and will sometimes add slices black olives to the dish.

I haven't been in the mood for traditional tomato/ pasta sauce, so I decided to try this. I really enjoyed it made as directed, but will make a couple of changes next time I make it. First, I felt that 2 red peppers were a bit too much. I'll stick with one on the next try. Also, I might cook the pasta a little less than 5-6 minutes before mixing with the rest. It got a little overcooked. Also added some grated Parmesan cheese to each serving. Other than that, it's a keeper.

Very good, I cooked my sausage links slightly first just to make it easier to slice I always struggle with cutting raw sausage no matter how sharp my knife is. I added some chopped garlic once the peppers and onions sweated for a min so that it wouldn't burn. And all I had was crushed tomatoes and chicken broth on hand so I had to boil away a little liquid before I added my pasta, I didn't realize how soupy it was going to be, but it made it more of a sauce which is preferred in our house. All in all it was a good quick dish that I would make again

I started with the basic recipe but had to use what I had on hand. I didn't have IT sausage links so I used ground.  Based on the reviews I omitted the beef  broth and added a jar of spaghetti sauce and 2 cloves of garlic along with the peppers and onions and a half a block of cream cheese. Turned out great!

I made the recipe exactly as written. It was very tasty. 
My husband requested "something with italian sausage" but I didn't want a recipe with spaghetti type sauce. He enjoyed this dish and called it comfort food. Perfect for a cold and snowy night.
I hope it reheats well as it makes a lot and my children refused to even try it. Ah, well more for my husband and me!

After reading the reviews, I did make a couple of changes.  I added a splash of balsamic vinegar to enhance the tomato flavor.  I also boiled the pasta the recommended time and left out the beef broth.  I did that because I didn't want it to get too soggy since I prepared it to take for lunches and it was basically going to be "leftovers for lunch." I'm going to make this again with the same peppers, tomatoes, etc. and instead of sausage, I'll use Italian meatballs, thawed.

The only thing I did that was different I used Hot Italian saugage. If this is made right the bow ties absorb the liquid and the only thing left is the  pasta vegies and big flavor.

This is very good.  I made some modifications for personal taste only. I used one 10 oz can of diced tomatoes with green chilies for a little heat.  Approximately 2 tbsp of sugar.   One  8 oz can of tomato sauce, and rinsed and added about two 8 oz cans of water.  I dropped the beef broth.  Topped with some Parmesan before serving.   This added plenty of flavor and everyone loved it.

Made this for supper tonight as I was looking to use up the few Italian sausages I had left.  I didn't have any peppers so I omitted them and didn't use the olive oil but other than that I followed the recipe as written.  I used 3  colored fusili instead of the farfalle.  Got thumbs up from the family.

For all the people who bag on chefs that change the recipe, stop reading now... Ok, for those of you who dont mind some renditions... I pulled this recipe up and decided to make it because of the time it says it takes.. I think the time would be rightish if you use pre-cooked sausage. I did not. It takes 20-30 minutes to properly cook sausage, which is what I did. Then I started the pasta. I pulled the links out of the dutch oven I was frying them in and cooked 4 garlic cloves for a minute or so. Then I added red onion and the peppers and added a little salt and pepper. I cooked them on medium heat for 7 minutes. About this time the pasta was done and I put it to the side. I added the beef stock, 28oz diced tomatos, 14oz tomato sauce and seasoning. I brought it to a simmer then added the cut links and a handful of fresh parsley. I added a little more salt and pepper and 1/4 cup of grated parmesan. Then I tossed in the pasta (rotini) and mixed it until it was warm. I ended up with a delicious soupy meal with plenty of leftovers. Thank you for the very forgiving recipe. I will make several variations of this in the future!

Great and easy! Only thing I changed was switching to chicken stock rather than beef...just a personal preference, makes it a bit lighter and the sausage taste comes through just fine. Reheating adds to the flavor as well.

iIt was very good.  I didn't expect  it to be more of a soup.  I was expecting more like a hamburger helper type consistancy.  It was still very good.

With me and my husband's busy schedule we are always looking for tasty fast meals and this was one of them. Cutting the sausage really didn't take much time at all. It was light and delicious and the beef broth added a different flavor then traditional tomato sauce. I will make this meal again!!!

It is delicious and easy to make. I changed the tomatoes to petite diced with garlic and olive oil. It was super!

I really liked this recipe.  The red peppers appealed to me, the large quantity seemed to be my taste and I was right.  I've made it twice so far, once as directed and the second time I added some sautéed baby portobello mushrooms.  The recipe produces a huge quantity, but I noticed that each time a portion is reheated it tastes even better.

Everyone one liked this. Did not use olive oil and added zucchini. This is a great base recipe that I will use again but will always add a variety of veggies.

Made  a few changes:
Used spaghetti.  Shaped pastas perform best with thicker sauces.  While flavorful, not a thick sauce. 
Sprinkled a little bit of crushed red pepper.  A wee bit!  Little does a lot.  
Garnished with fresh basil and grated Parmesan.  
Beef broth not necessary.  Vegetable or chicken will work just fine.

I made this and the only change I made was adding in some grape tomatoes that I had. It was yum. I think it would taste good with added summer squash too. Planning to make it again soon.

I did break my rule of following the recipe strictly the first time. Took another reviewers advice to add some tomato paste. Also fresh garlic. It was very good and I'll make it again. Will drain a bit of the fat after browning sausage next time just because it seemed a bit oily.

I halved the recipe as just for my husband & myself.
I added 2 tbl tomato of tomato paste and 2 garlic cloves sliced to the recipe as suggested by many of reviews. Next time instead of cloves I might try garlic powder. It was very good.  Will make again.  I had enough extra to prepare another meal.  I had some extra tomatoes left from the can & will see if I need to add some to my extra meal.

QUICK & EASY TO PREPARE. MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH LIKED THIS. WHEN I MAKE THIS AGAIN I AM GOING TO USE FIRE-ROASTED  TOMATOES, INSTEAD OF THE PLAN  TOMATOES, JUST TO GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE SPICE.

Cooked as written, except I added some hot pepper to balance with the sweet sausage. My boys tore it up! Thought I'd have enough for lunch the next day, but that didn't happen. Was told to add to my meal rotation.

This was a great dish and easy to make. I made it with 1 lb ground sausage and 1 lb ground turkey meat. I added garlic to the meat while it was cooking. I also substituted the beef broth for low sodium vegetable broth. Then topped it with grated Parmesan cheese. Came out great!

We loved this dish.   I added 1 tbsp of Tomato Paste to thicken the sauce.  Also stirred in fresh basil for flavor and color.  Topped with fresh grated cheese.   Will make it again.  Big hit.

We loved this!  I cut the original recipe in half as there is just my hubby and I and added a few things we love.  I know, I also like to read a review of the recipe as is written but some reviewers said that it didn't have enough flavor for them.  So, when the bowtie pasta was done with the boiling step, I drained it and added 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter and a good shake of garlic powder to it as well as some freshly ground black pepper.   I sliced some fresh grape tomatoes instead of canned, diced tomatoes as I had them ready to go and they added a lot of nice fresh tomato flavor.  I used  7 oz. of a can of Campbell's Consomme for the beef broth as it has a really nice flavor and I used the HOT Italian sausage instead of the sweet as that's what I had on hand.  The red pepper and onion added great flavor and I had added the Italian seasoning to the sliced grape tomatoes.  At the very end, I added a good handful of fresh baby spinach leaves to the pan and once they started to wilt, pulled it off and served with a topping of freshly grated Parmiaggiano Reggianno cheese.  My husband said it was the best pasta he has EVER had!  It was full of wonderful flavors and I will definitely make this my number one pasta dish!

Very good dish.  Just made a few additions, chopped green olives, garlic & topped with feta cheese.  Very popular, will keep making in the future - Thanks

Just a note for everyone who precooked sausage so it sliced easier, just sub ground sausage meat & brown it up in a big pan and add everything to the same pan

Love love love the simplicity of this recipe! It's was very good! I only made a couple changes, I added fresh garlic, more Italian seasoning and a can of tomatoe sauce. Easy and delicious, I will definitely make again.

Excellent, quick and easy - I used Alymer's bruschetta style diced tomatoes - it was a huge hit

I thought it was good. The red pepper really gave it a nice flavor along with the other ingredients. My husband who is oblivious to food most of the time, said it was good. I made it  but we  wanted more sauce so I added some Italian cheese and some spaghetti sauce to thicken it up a little. I will make it again. Thanks.

Haven't made it yet, but when cutting Italian sausage into bite size pieces always easier if sausage is a little frozen... Will try this receipe, but have to go to Italian speciality shop for sausage...read reviews & sauce not sticking to pasta would b an issue....
