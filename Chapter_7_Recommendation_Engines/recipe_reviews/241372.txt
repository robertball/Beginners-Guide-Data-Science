Quick, easy, spicy, delicious!! I "may" have used a bit too much cayenne pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe as written, and we really liked it.
One tip - Put it under the broiler for the last five minutes or so!!

I followed the cooking instructions, although instead of 6 thin chops, I had 4  3/4" chops.  Cooking thin chops for 30 min at 440 degrees seemed really odd to me, and even though mine were thicker, I set timer for 20 min to check.  Sure enough they had an internal temp of over 200 degrees!

This probably would have been good if the chops didnt turn out  like jerky.  Thin chop at 440 degrees for 30 minutes was over kill.

I did make one change which was using Sweet Baby Ray's Hawaiian BBQ sauce.  I also used the tip about putting it under the broiler for the last 5 minutes.  Served with Coleslaw, Baked Pineapple, and Baked Potatoes.  Yummy!!!

This recipe is SO good! I reduced the amount of cyenne pepper and had to use red wine instead of white but the results are so good!! My mouth was watering just from the smell while it was cooking and the taste was oh so divine!

Absolutely flavourful. Used homemade red wine vinegar, french dijon mustard, and instead of topping it with 2tbs of sauce i topped them with 1 and flipped them 15mins into cooking and then topped them with the other. Next time will add 1 more spoon of honey to add consistency and counter act with the cayenne pepper.

I used 2 bone -in pork chops and made the sauce as directed. I used directions from another recipe that I have that bakes the pork chops at 325 for 15 minutes on each side and they were PERFECT! Very flavorful! I will say that if I make this with more pork chops I would make the sauce accordingly to the amount. I feel it was just enough for two chops! So good & I will definitely make this again & again!

I really enjoyed the simplicity of this, except I hadn't all the ingredients. I had no vinegar, honey, or ketchup, but I had everything else, and substituted Classic Open Pit for Ketchup. Made it two nights in a row and great consistently. Definitely worth a repeat!

This was excellent!  Everybody loved it at dinner tonight. I used red wine vinegar because that's what I had and only 1/2 tsp of cayenne but those were the only changes I made.  I baked it a full 30 minutes at only 400 degrees, by mistake, and it was perfect!

Fab-a-mundo. One of my favorite pork chop recipes on Allrecipes! I did halve the cayenne and strong recommend. I did change the cooking temp and time to 450 for 20 minutes for thin chops. They were so moist, with a detectable heat.  Thank you for the great recipe! Highly recommend!

Followed exactly as written. Very spicy. Will reduce cayenne pepper just a bit next time, but a keeper for sure.

This was so good.  I did caramelized the onions first and instead of a cup of ketchup I did 1/2 cup of ketchup and 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce.
