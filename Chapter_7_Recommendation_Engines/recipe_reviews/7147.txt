I Have made this every week, since I found the recipe, I added 1 tsp. fennel seed and eliminated the almonds, and I have given the recipe to so many people.

I found that they needed much more pepper, I now add about 2 tablespoons of pepper to get them spicy enough. It is a time consuming recipe but well worth the effort.

We grew up on Mulberry Street years ago, and these pepper rings were a staple in our family, purchased at the local bakery in 5 lb. quantities. Over the years, my brothers and I moved in three separate directions, all far from NYC. I happened upon this recipe a few years ago and tried it out. OMIGOSH, It was like stepping back in time! I've made the tarradls for my brothers and shipped them to Florida and North Carolina a couple of times a year. They rave about them and actually hoard them! Vince, this recipe has given me so much pleasure in being able to revisit the past and especially treat my good bros once in awhile. Thanks so much. LOVE THIS RECIPE!

Tarralles are great. Also good to make some with fennel or caraway instead of black pepper and plain ones to later coat with a bit of simple icing.
