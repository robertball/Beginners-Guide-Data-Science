This recipe yields a very good dirty AKA "filthy" martini. If you can't find the Stirrings Dirty Mix, you can simply substitute with olive juice. Add a bit of dry vermouth if you like it. Also, don't forget to chill the martini glass before straining the cocktail out of the shaker. 
When the martini is in the shaker, shake it hard! You want it to come out with a whitish/ slightly cloudy appearance to it and a very thin ice "skin" on top. This will MAKE the martini! 
One last piece of advice, the better the vodka used, the better this martini will be.
