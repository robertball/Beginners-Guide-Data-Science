Just used regular red chili powder instead of Ancho, and added Paprika instead of Cayenne. Marinated the meat in refrigerator overnight but something can up and was not able to cook until the next day. Even after 48 hrs. of marination the meat was not mushy but a little too tenderized for me. So even with Kiwi fruit the max marinate time should only be 24 hrs. 
Grilled over charcoal and came out deliciously!
