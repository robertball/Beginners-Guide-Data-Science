Good recipe; I cut it in half for only one pizza pan.  This made a nice cakey cookie.  I think it needed double the salt to bring out more flavor.  My son doesn't like cakey cookies, so he wouldn't eat this.

I was scared about making this recipe, but it was wonderful! I had to make two batches and used bigger pans to accomodate teenage boys, but they loved it. Awesome recipe, thank you!

this recipe was okay, it was a fluffy cake-like cookie, but the taste was a little bland, I thought.

I was surprised by this cookie/cake, I was expecting more cookie but got more cake.  It was very nice though.  I took it to a party with adults and kids and everyone loved it.  Next time I might frost it too!!

I know a lot of the reviews said that it was too cake-like but my guests loved it. They loved that difference.

This recipe is awesome! I used a cookie sheet instead of a pizza pan and my mom's mouth was watering. I have to get a new pizza pan for next time

After serving it to my family, they were amazed at how flufffy the Pizza Cookie was. It came out very different then the one presented in the picture. It was is taller, and a lighter color. I believe this was because I filled the pan a bit more than halfway.  THANK YOU, FOR THIS LOVED RECIPE! I will be making it again!
