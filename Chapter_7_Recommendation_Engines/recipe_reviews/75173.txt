I used instant mashed potatoes to save time, and subbed cheddar cheese for Jack.  Also added 4 tbsp of sour cream to the mashed potatoes so they wouldn't dry out.  Pretty good twist on instant potatoes.

the only thing imho is if you beat the potatoes with a mixer you have whipped potatoes (aka mud) and with that texture the flavor goes bye bye too. mashed s/b as it says  and it should have some lumps and texture and with the lumpier texture there is more flavor

Made lots of additions - sauteed onions, sauteed bell peppers, mushrooms.  Made this for a tailgate party - I would probably make it again for the same type of occasion.

Very good. Also tried sour cream in potatoes, cheddar(instead of jack), ranch bread crumbs, and sprinkled with chopped bacon and chives. Big hit.

Excellent recipe. I didn't have garlic seasoned bread crumbs so I just added some garlic powder to some store bought seasoned crumbs and it turned out perfect. Make sure you don't add too much milk at once or it may turn out a bit runny. If this does happen feel free to thicken it up with some potato flakes. Recipe is perfect as it stands. I will make this again.

This was pretty good, but I'm thinking perhaps a bit less bread crumbs for me next time and a little more cheese. It was just a bit too funky for me. Thanks though! :)

Good recipe idea with probably hundreds of variations. Omitted bread crumbs, used feta cheese, topped with sauteed mushrooms and green onions.

Great alternative to regular garlic mashed. For the bread crumbs, I melted margarine and mixed in regular bread crumbs and garlic powder. I find the garlic mashed potatoes in restaurants are often too garlic-y for me, so I like having the garlic taste in the bread crumbs instead of the actual potatoes. I mixed some of the shredded cheese in with the potatoes and also added a layer of shredded cheese in between the potatoes in the baking dish. (potatoes - cheese - potatoes - cheese - breadcrumbs)

I think the measurements are all off. 1/2 cup of milk and butter are way to little for the amount of potatoes - ended up pretty dry and having to mix more in. also, just spreading breadcrumbs on top gives you just that, crumbs on top. think you need to saute em in some butter first so they can brown more and get crispy. all in all kinda just blah.

This mashed potatoes recipe is OK. Instead of using an electric mixer, I used a normal potato masher to give it a better consistency. In addition, softening the potatoes in a sauce pan took a long time and a very large sauce pan was needed (I suggest using a spaghetti pot instead).  The mashed potatoes had very little flavor alone so I would advise using more spices mixed in with the potatoes in addition to the cheese and bread crumb toppings.  The general idea behind this recipe could be good, it just needs a few adjustments.

These were just ordinary, I would make them again, but nothing I was fanatic about. Next time I think I would add some ground beef or bacon and serve it as a main dish if anything...

Delicious! The only thing I added was some garlic to the water while the potatoes were boiling.  Forgot the salt but it didn't matter, the flavour was wonderful.

Excellent recipe. Added cubed ham, rosemary, fresh garlic (instead of garlic bread crumbs), parsley and used kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. It was divine! :)

This turned out ok....for a more crunchy topping I used Panko break crumbs mixed with 2 tsp garlic powder and while potatoes are cooking, toasted 5 min in the oven to a light brown in the same baking dish used for the potatoes.
