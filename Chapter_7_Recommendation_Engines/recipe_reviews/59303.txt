This was a tasty, easy and simple recipe for eggplant. I followed the recipe as directed, using maybe slightly less cheese than called for and italian breadcrumbs rather than plain, and adding salt and pepper. I would agree with a previous comment that suggestes to start baking the eggplant skin while chopping and cooking the other vegetables. The skin came out a bit tough for us, though not inedible. Cooking the skin a bit longer before stuffing should solve this. I'd also add the cheese topping about ten minures into baking the stuffed eggplant, to make it melty and gooey rather than hard. This was the first time I've ever cooked an eggplant dish and I'll make this again!

We really enjoyed this rec. I baked eggplant skin by itself about 7-10 min, then filled with mushroom mixture and baked for 15 min, then added cheese on top and cooked another 10 min. Next time Im going to add some seasonings/spices to mushroom mixture. Overall very good. I agree with other reviewer who said that if you like stuffing you will like this rec.

Made this last night and we LOVED it.  I altered it a bit, so I can only give 4 stars. I added 1 T each parsley and lemon juice, reduced the bread crumbs and added half a chopped bell pepper.  I pre-baked the eggplant shells 10 minutes.  I covered the stuffed eggplant with foil for the first part of the baking and did not add the cheese on top until the last 10 minutes, baking uncovered.

I enjoyed this recipe and would make it again.  I added one red pepper to the mixture and had a little of it left over for a sandwich the next day.  Next time I would really try to scrape the eggplant flesh out as close to the peel as possible b/c it didn't cook it all the through for me. Another thing you could probably do would be to cook the eggplant skin in the oven will everything else is getting chopped and cooked.  Although I wan't able to eat the skin it was good.  I would make it again.

Fantastic! I made just a couple of modifications to the original recipe: As per other suggestions, I pre-baked the eggplant shells, added two cloves of garlic to the sauteed veg, only used about a 1/3 cup of Italian breadcrumbs and added a 1/4 cup parmesan and 1/4 cup shredded cheese in the mixture for a delicious consistency - topped with a bit more shredded cheese in the last 10 minutes of baking and it was absolutely delicious - the garlic and parmesan made this dish reminiscent of an easy eggplant parmesan-type recipe!

This is right up my alley.  I'll have to share it with my vegetarian friend.  I used 1/2 c cheese in the mixture and sprinkled 1/2 c on top and found that was plenty for my taste.  I made the mistake of using loive oil to fry the veggies and the eggplant sucked it all up along with the oil taste so next time I will use butter like it calls for.

This was very good. I used a smaller eggplant and halved the ingredients. If you like stuffing you will love this recipe.  The only thing I would do a little different is to add the cheese on top during the last 10 minutes. It was a little too cooked for my taste, but this is certainly a great recipe.  I made a meal out of it and was quite full.
Thank you for a great idea.

If I followed recipe as directed, it would be BLAND!! First I salted the egg plant while preparing the stuffing. Than i bake the egg plant for 15 min, I find the shell is less chewy & not bitter when doing this.To stuffing mixture.  I add portobello Mush& Green pepper & shred carrots. For seasoning I add fresh basil & oregano, crushed S/P, 1 more clove of garlic.I disregard the bread crumbs & and + crushed seasoned croutons. as well at the end I add Parmesan cheese & Havarti cheese. WITH MY ALTERATION IT WAS A FIVE STAR. but if the original recipe is only a 2 star.

This was pretty good - even the picky eater in the house thought it was OK.  Would be a good main dish if you added some sausage.

This was very good. I cut the eggplant in half and layed the 2 halves cut side down on a plate, covered with a paper towel and microwaved for 5 minutes. The center scooped out nicely and the shell was partially cooked. I stuffed mine with onion,garlic,mushrooms,roma tomates,a handful of leftover spinach,the eggplant pulp,breadcrumbs, and fresh grated parm cheese. I sauteed all of these together in 1tblspn. of evoo. Stuffed the boats and covered with more grated parm. and drizzled with a little more evoo. Oh, I forgot to mention the fresh basil I added. Fresh and so healthy. Will make again, there are so many variations for this tasty dish!

This was an excellent meal and deserves 5 stars but I messed up and I added other ingredients.  I forgot to add the breadcrumbs so I did it when I added the cheddar cheese to brown at the end of cooking.  I also added parmesan cheese.  I did not have any mushrooms so I used tomato.  It was delish!  My veggie husband was pleased.  Looked good too.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought that this was only so-so.  It was missing something; it was bland.  I agree with previous reviews that it did remind me of stuffing on Thanksgiving, but still, it was too bland.  What I would recommend is that you mix in some cooked sausage with the "stuffing", replace the cheddar with a more flavorful cheese like pepperjack or something, and add more herbs, like fresh basil or rosemary.  Regular mushrooms in this recipe didn't shine through.  Perhaps using a more flavorful mushroom, like Baby Bellas, would help.  Also, you need to precook the eggplant "shell" before stuffing it.  When I followed the recipe exactly, the shell was only half-cooked.  So, I'd say throw the shell in the oven for fifteen minutes, take it out, stuff it, then another fifteen minutes in the oven.  I might use this recipe again as a base for a greater dish, but was not impressed with it as it stands.

This was delicious. I followed some of the other comments and baked the eggplant shells. I sprayed some vegetable oil on the cut side of the shells in order to keep them from drying out. I alsoI lowered the temperature of the oven to 350F and baked the shells for about 20 minutes. They were done if I could cut them with a fork. I added 1 green pepper to the stuffing mixture and reduced the amount of bread crumbs to about 1/3 C.  I baked the stuffed eggplants in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes.

I was surprised how much this tasted like the turkey stuffing I eat on Thanksgiving!  I used this recipe as a guide, but I made quite a few changes.  I baked the eggplant shells while I was cooking the filling.  I used oil instead of butter, I added spices (garlic, lemon pepper, parsley, seasoned salt), I used fewer mushrooms and added a bit of orange bell pepper.  I also left the cheese out of the main part of the stuffing and just sprinkled some on top about 5 minutes before I removed the stuffed eggplant from the oven.  I liked this, but I think I'll experiment with it some more to see if I can make it even better.

I looked at this recipe for ideas but modified it considerably since it was *very*  high in fat...  I used whole wheat breadcrumbs  1 cup of low fat cheese (instead of two cups cheddar cheese 3 tablespoons rice bran oil (no butter) 1/4 cup of skim (trim) milk  I also added 2 chopped zucchini and 1 cup of chopped cabbage to the mix in the pan.  Add the milk just before the cheese (after the bread crumbs) to help bind it all together and then put into egglplant skins as directed. I sprinkled a little bit of grated edam over the top (literally a tablespoon on each side) and it was divine.  I served it with saute chicken breast with broccoli and sweet soy sauce

This was sooo good! I halved and microwaved the eggplant for a few minutes. Sautéed onion, eggplant, & garlic in olive oil. Added a bit of tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic salt & basil. I did not add any bread crumbs or Cheddar cheese, but instead added Parmesan cheese to taste which gave the desired consistency. It was delicious, thanks for sharing such a great recipe! :)

This recipe was pretty good. I ended up adding green peppers into the stuffing and it was really good. I would recommend cooking the eggplant a little longer than it says, just because it was still a little difficult to cut into. Overall was a good recipe!

This is a really excellent recipe that tastes good and also looks very apetizing.  I didn't use mushrooms, but added red peppers.  I would maybe add a bit less bread crumbs next time.  I will make this again. I also followed some advice from other reviewers and put the hollowed out shell in the oven for about 15 minutes while I was frying the eggplant to make sure it was softened.

This was delicious, and like others said, really did remind me of stuffing. I didn't quite use all of the bread crumbs, and I used less cheese as well just to cut back a few calories. But it was still tasty!

This was a great, easy, healthy dish. We added Kale for a little saltiness and red pepper for a little sweetness, garlic, some classic warm spices (coriander, cumin, paprika, curry powder, dash of nutmeg) and used enoki and shiitake mushrooms satueed in olive oil. We used the suggestion and once the eggplant was pitted out, i made shallow slices in the remaining flesh, lightly brushed with olive oil, and threw it in the oven while the rest of the vegetables cooked. We substituted Wheat Germ for the bread crumbs and with the added spices, we cut the cheese in half and didnt miss a thing. Definite addition into the recipe box.

I read all of the suggestions and added garlic, 1/2 orange pepper, 2 cloves garlic, added garlic salt, oregano, basil and used 1/2 fat free garlic and onion croutons and 1/2 plain bread crumbs.  I baked the skins for about 15+ minutes and then stuffed w/mixture.  The entire dish was delish! The skins were fantastic cooked but having also soaked up the juice/butter gave them an excellent flavor.  I also agree w/the reviewer who said sausage would be good in them or Morningstar meat substitute.  But I'm happy with it just like it is too!

Okay, but there was way too much cheese.  I think we like the roasted eggplant by itself better.

We grew some lady finger eggplants and didn't know what to do with them.  Tried this recipe - it is fantastic.

I've made this recipe before, and it is always delicious. The texture is a little strange, though. It's mushy, and it's not something I would serve guests because of that. Also, scooping out the eggplant is time intensive. When I've made the recipe, I have reduced the bread crumbs and cheese, and substituted olive oil for the butter (to make it a little healthier). Today, I altered the recipe even more to make it easier - first I chopped the eggplant into cubes and sauteed it with the onions. Then I added the mushrooms and some sausage. When those were ready, I added the bread crumbs and cheese and then baked for 15 minutes (adding more cheese during the last 5 minutes). The sausage was an amazing addition!

This was a very good vegetarian meal--very filling and tasty. I can't give it 5 stars because the skin of the eggplant was an issue for us. I tried to bake it on a bed of spaghetti sauce, and that did make it more tender and easier to eat. I have a suspician that adding some curry and/or chili powder (i.e., some Southwestern flavoring) might be a really good spin on it. Also, some sausage could be great, especially if it was a bit spicy.

This recipe is worth ALL 5 stars!  I was pleasantly surprised.  I though how great could this be...not really any spices, etc.  I added Italian style breadcrumbs, a bit of oregano and salt & pepper (cound't help it...had to spice it.)  I also took the other reviewers advice & precooked the eggplant shells, & added cooked crumbled chicken sausage.  We will definitely make this again!!

I made this according to recipe. I love eggplant, but the bread crumbs in this are just too overpowering, they absorb too much of the flavor. I would remove them completely, replace with diced tomatoes or rice, or both. This was just not a tasty recipe at all. Maybe it just didn't appease my palate and would be good for others...just not for me.

This was very good. Based on others' suggestions, I baked the eggplant skins while the eggplant and mushroom mixture was cooking on the stove. I left out the onion because my husband doesn't eat it, but I added in some minced garlic and about 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning. I'll definitely make this again!

I saw this recipe and wondered how it would work with zucchini (they're coming out of my armpits).  At any rate, I followed the directions, as printed, and I'm here to tell you it was absolutely delicious.  I did use Cabot's Seriously Sharp cheese to give it a little extra kick.  So, if you have a lot of zucchini in your garden to get rid of, this is a great dish.  Thanks for sharing.

I don't like eggplant but I made this dish for my husband.  He said it was one of the best eggplant dishes that he ever ate.  I have actually never made anything with eggplant in it before and I picked out all the seeds.  Apparently that wasn't necessary.  Live and learn!

Quite a treat! Made this last night and the hubby was very impressed (as was I). Cooked the skin longer as recommended by other reviewers, added some yellow pepper and squash to the mixture and put the cheese on top in the last 10 minutes. Next time will use half the butter though, 3-4 spoons would've been plenty for our taste.

My family LOVED this recipe. Its really fast and easy. But do follow the advice to bake the eggplant hulls for about 10 mins before stuffing them and baking it again. I added garlic powder, diced fresh mushrooms,diced green bell peppers and diced onions. It was amazing!!! Thanks so much for this awesome new way to cook eggplant!

This was really really good.  I didn't have much cheese so I used very little and didn't have much on top but that didn't matter.  It was still great.  I would make this again.

This was wonderful. I followed advice of others and baked eggplant shells for about 10-15min before stuffing. I reduced the amount of butter by half. I also subbed crushed gluten free pecan crackers for the bread crumbs. This is a keeper.

Tried this recipe for the first time last night...it was very good, but also very rich in taste.  I served it as a main dish with a salad and between the two of us we were almost able to finish one of the halves.  Still have another half left over in the fridge.  If I make again I would prob. cut down on the butter and also use a smidge less cheese - I don't think an entire cup needs to be used on top.  I also used 1/2 the amount of breadcrumbs and the other 1/2 ritz crackers finely processed.  Overall, It was a nice alternative to the abundance of eggplant I get in the summer so I recommend giving it a try.  Thanks for sharing!!!

This was a delicious surprise. I don't cook often or well, but I was given an eggplant and I had all the ingredients on hand. I left out the mushrooms and I did bake the skin before filling it (per others suggestions) and it was wonderful!! Easy and very delicious :)

I thought this was pretty good. My husband gave it a "4.75". He's very punctual like that. I'd give it a 4 b/c it was good, just not the best. It's very filling. I could only eat half of a half. I added a minced garlic clove, some oregano, salt and pepper and cooked the shell longer, as recommended by others. Next time, I will put more garlic, and I'll put the cheese on top in the last 6/7 minutes of baking. Even ten minutes was too much in  my oven... and btw, it's such a pain to scoop out the eggplant in the beginning. Blah... scooping and chopping took me like thirty minutes (but i'm a beginner).

This was a very good recipe.  I'm always looking for new things to do with eggplant.  I did, however, make a few changes:
I peeled the eggplant and breaded it by dipping it in egg and rolling it in Italian Bread Crumbs.  Then, I placed it on a cookie sheet and broiled it for approximately ten minutes (until the bread crumbs turned brown).  Next, I stuffed and baked them according to the recipe.  A great side is dirty rice with a spinach salad.  It turned out very well, thanks for the recipe!

The mixture its self was good, however i WILL NOT add the bread crumbs if i make again. Definitely start the skin while the mixture is cooking and make sure you get all the pulp out of the eggplant!

I adjusted this recipe based on what I had on hand and it turned out great.  I didn't have mushrooms or cheddar so I used red pepper and mozzerella instead.  Can't wait to try it with mushrooms.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this recipe a few times now and it comes out great every time! It's such a delicious way to eat eggplant, or "aubergine" as we call it here in England. It's so easy as well!
