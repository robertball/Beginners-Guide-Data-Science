This works with just about any cream-of soup you have on hand. I like to double the amount of tuna and use two cans and add a little more milk than asked for. Using canned milk gives it a creamer flavor. If you don't have bread crumbs, crushed croutons or butter crackers are a good substitute.

Great recipe as a starting point. One you can tweak or leave as is. I made a few changes. I used 350g bag of egg noodle. I can of cream of celery and 1 can of cream of chicken.  I also added carrots, peas and added a second can of tuna. instead of the cheddar I used Kraft Habenero Heat cheese for a kick.  Enjoy

I used this as a basic recipe for my canned salmon recipe. My son chose Rotini noodles (which I prefer over egg noodles) & can of mushroom. Some people said it was missing something, was definitely veggies. Added peas & carrots (frozen). I seasoned the fish mixture with garlic salt, onion powder, old bay, S&P, for a little change up, curry & ginger (just a little was enough). Mix together with noodles & baked for 35 minutes. Amazing.

I really liked this recipe but only after I made some changes to the ingredient amounts.  I cut the macaroni down to 8 oz. (2 cups) and made it with small elbow macaroni.  I increased the shredded cheese to about 3 cups and increased the tuna to 12 oz.  I also decreased the bread crumbs to 1/4 cup.  You could add some salt but I just salted it when served.  I left the remaining ingredients as is as well as the cooking time and while it doesn't specify, I baked it uncovered.  It would serve about 3 people.  If I want to make more then I'll just take the changes and those unchanged and double it.  It came out nice and creamy, flavorful and perfect!  When I made it with the original measurements it was very dry and not very flavorful, hence the 3 stars.  But with the changes, it's 5 stars!

This recipe is what it is---comfort food.  I made it as written except for needing to use two kinds of pasta (elbow macaroni and whole wheat rotini).  I went short on the pasta, and I did think one more can of tuna could have  been used (I used Costco's 6 oz can, but most of the regular brands now are only 5 oz---so definitely two cans needed there).  This was just a good easy meal!  Thanks for the recipe!

I added a second can of tuna, butter with sea salt and a couple more shakes of sea salt. Should have added a little more cheese for my taste but it’s a good baseline recipe to go from.

Added a lot more spices, including paprika, chili powder, and nutmeg along with peas, spinach and onion. Also added a little thyme. Needed to add more milk before baking in the casserole dish. But great foundation for a delicious tuna casserole!

Easy to make. None in our extended household turned it down.  Next time we'll add a little more milk, maybe cheese.

Such a great starter recipe. I used the garden twirl noodles and cream of mushroom soup. Didn’t have cheddar so I used Parmesan. Threw in some frozen corn, pepper and smoked paprika into the mix. Topped with Panko bread crumbs and a little extra Parmesan cheese. Turned out tasty.

for a slightly healthier version, I added a cooked sweet potato or yam to the mix and some stemmed broccoli. also I used vegetable pasta and only 1/2 of a can of mushroom soup.  I added a bit of sour cream to make up for the lack of soup.

Was good, but there weren't many bells and whistles, this recipe would be a good base for adding veggies and maybe more tuna.

This is good but lacks any luster...I added Salt and Pepper and a little onion and it was far better that way.   Very good then.
