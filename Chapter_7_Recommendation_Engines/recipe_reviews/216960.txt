Great recipe! I didn't have "Lime Ponzu", so I found a recipe on AR for "Orange Ponzu" by The Sushi Guy and subbed in lime for the orange. It worked out pretty good.  This was a great way to perk up grilled corn - very tasty with a nice citrus flavor!

Couldn't fine Lime Ponzu in my store so I made if from a recipe here using lime instead of orange. I always wrap my grill corn in bacon keeping it moist and the rule holds true everything is better with bacon!  This was very good but had hoped for something more and different.  Will made again.

I also couldn't find the special Ponzu sauce but what I did find was a lime flavoured salt shaker so I sprinkled that on after spreading on the butter.  Loved the flavour of this!
