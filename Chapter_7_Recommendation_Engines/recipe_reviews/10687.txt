Best snickerdoodle ever!!! If you're having a problem with flat cookies, there could be two reasons.  Check your baking soda and Cream of Tartar to make sure they're fresh.  Baking soda goes flat pretty soon after opening the box.  I start a new box almost every month.  To test it, just put a tiny bit of the soda in some water.  If it doesn't start fizzing immediately, it's not any good.  Also, if your eggs are too big the dough will spread too much.  Most recipes call for large eggs, not extra large.  When I make this recipe, I usually pour off just a tiny bit of the egg white, because I like my cookies puffy.  Hope this helps, because I've tried a lot of snickerdoodle recipes, and this is by far the best.

HELPFUL TIPS: Bake for 8 min exactly! ...and you can even wait a few min. for it to cool on the cookie sheet just get it out of the oven!  Either way, the critics (my family & friends) RAVED about these yummies, and I've never left w/o someone asking for the recipe!  1st: Use butter AND eggs that are room temp. I've used all butter w/excellent results. 2nd: Mix dry & wet separately. 3rd: Hand mix or you'll get a different result.  Do not overmix.  I never have cream of tartar, so I use 2 tsp. of white vinegar OR lemon juice.  Lastly, I used a medium scoop. For the topping, I used 3T. sugar & 3.5 tsp. of cinnamon dumped in ziplock bag.  Do not be afraid to over coat.  It will NOT turn out too sweet (and I'm not a fan of sweets)!!!! Coat well. :) If your cookie turns out flat, I'd check to see if your baking soda has expired.  To test, it should fizzle the second you place it in water.  I've never had issues w/these turning out flat OR dough being sticky (which was really confusing to me to hear from others); just keeping them in our lock n lock container long enough before husband comes home.  They store great, & I didn't have any of the problems many others did!  I never need to put these in the refrigerator first either!

Yum--love snickerdoodles. I am only giving this recipe 4 stars because I do not like the acrid cream of tartar taste and the way the cookies completely flatten out (I like them puffier).

For puffier cookies, I modified the recipe to use 2 tsps of baking powder instead of 2 tsps of cream of tartar, I roll the dough into 1.5" balls and bake the cookies at 375F for about 8 minutes. I also take the cookies off the baking sheet asap so they don't have time to heat up and lose their puffiness. Just the way I like them--big, chewy and puffy!

This is THE best recipe for making snickerdoodles!  I've made it at least a dozen times, and I've learned a few things along the way:  1) For cookies that are crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, bake for only 8 mins. and remove from sheet immmediately to cool on wire rack. You may even want to lower oven temp. slightly. 2) I agree with a previous reviewer that cinnamon/sugar mixture should be increased to 3T white sugar, and 3tsp. cinnamon. 3) For a REALLY quick and mess-free method of rolling balls of dough in cinnamon/sugar mixture, place mixture in a sandwich baggie and drop one ball in at a time to coat. (Thoroughly-coated makes for a tastier snix). Enjoy! And thank you, Beth, for another wonderful recipe! ...Got any ideas for a good sugar/cut-out cookie? ;-)

these cookies are great.  maybe this is something all you cooks know, but i'm still sixteen and i figured out that if you cream the butter and sugar with an electric mixture, you get a totally different result in texture then when you mix it by hand.  They taste the same but look way prettier if you do it by hand.

FABULOUS recipe.  I have made these before and they were a big hit!  I'm not a big cookie fan, but these are irresistable.  Made a double batch last night in my Bosch, and saved some dough in the fridge to make some more over the next few days.  I forgot to buy cream of tartar after I made them last time, so got to that step & was trying to figure out what to do...when allrecipes.com came to the rescue: I went to allrecipes.com/advice/ref/subs/ and found out that you can substitute 1 t. of cream of tartar with 2 t. of lemon juice or vinegar.  I opted for the lemon juice, and WOW, you'd never know the difference between the recipe with the cream of tartar and the one with the lemon juice!  Just a hint for anyone else in the same predicament :)  Thanks for this awesome recipe, it will be a favorite forever.  Also, to keep your cookies soft, you can add the heal of a loaf of bread to your container of cookies/cookie jar.  Or else lightly spray with water the tops & microwave for 10 secs. or so (time depends on your microwave) to give it that fresh-from-the-oven taste.  Just a tip :)

This is a great recipe.  I added a 1/4 cup more flour because I know snickerdoodles can be very sticky.  I used a small ice cream type scoop (size 100, the size is on the scrapper bar inside the well of the scoop) and got about 68 cookies.  I baked them at 375 for 8 minutes.  Use parchment paper on your cookie sheets and just slide the parchemnt and all off the sheets to the cooling rack.

Another hint is to scoop out all the balls first then roll them in the sugar/cinnamon.  One way to keep them from making a mess of your hands is to wet your hande first.  The dough will not stick to your palms as you roll them.  

These do flatten out but are definately a great cookie.

this was an amazing recipe! incredibly easy.. I needed a little more of the sugar/cinnamon mixture than the recipe called for.  When I mixed up the second batch of mixture, I substituted half of the cinnamon for powdered cardamom.   yum!! very tasty as well.  Also, to the people who thought the cookies were too hard:   when the cookies start to look cracked, but the dough still looks wet in the cracks, pull them out -- otherwise, the cookies get too hard.

This is a good recipe, BUT it says to remove cookies off pan immediately--that is impossible unless you overcook them.  I learned this the hard way.  So, cook for the 8 minutes, even if they look underdone, let them rest a couple minutes then remove to cooling rack.  I will make these again.

My son loves the Snickerdoodles from our favorite restaurant and I decided to give these a whirl.  Boy is he glad I did!!! They were gone so fast & he's been begging for more.  My husband loved them too, but he only got to eat a couple cuz my cookie monster ate them all. Awesome recipe!  Note...I didn't have cream of tartar, so you can substitute with white vinegar or lemon (look at the substitutions list on All Recipes).

I've made these a number of times, always with great results. I found I needed more of the cinnamon/sugar mixture, so I increase it to 5 T. of each. As for baking time, it all depends on how you like your cookies! I prefer mine a little crispier, so 10 minutes is great for me, while hubby likes his softer, so 9 minutes is perfect for him. So there is no "perfect" baking time for everybody, just experiment till you get them to your liking.

Excellent! Here are some helpful tips: 1) Add a little bit extra flour, maybe a tablespoon or two 2) If you don't have cream of tartar, react your baking soda with lemon juice until all fizzes and then add that to your dough. Trust me, it works great!  3) Add 1/8 teaspoon baking powder to make them puffier! 4) HAND MIX! 5) Bake on parchment paper 6) Chill dough before baking

Turned out perfectly!  Thanks to all for your tips.  Here's a recap of the suggestions to get it to work for YOU:  1) Bake for 8 min, not until they look done.  2) For easier clean up, and for immediate removal from cookie sheet to wire rack, bake on parchment paper.  3) Increase coating mix to 5 T white sugar & 5 tsp cinnamon.  4) Put sugar/cin mix in baggie & ROLL cookies in it (do not shake...too much cinnamon gets on cookies)  5) You might need to refrigerate dough...although, it will be sticky either way.  No worries, they spread out nicely.  I gave a tin of these to my grandfather for Christmas; they were so good, he only shared one cookie with my grandma.  :)

These cookies came out perfect...the second try. The first time I sifted all the dry ingredients. Big mistake, DO NOT SIFT the flour. They came out really puffy and stayed that way and were just dry overall. They did not flatten as shown in the picture.

 How my second batch came out perfectly:
-let butter and eggs sit out till room temp,  I think it took about 90 minutes.
-beat first five ingredients with electric mixer on medium high for about two minutes, or less. Less is more. If you taste it, it will be grainy/gritty. Don't worry that the sugar is not dissolved.
-mix all dry ingredients in a bowl (flour, cream of tartar, baking soda and salt) then add to the wet mix. Fold back and forth with a spatula or with your hands, not the electric mixer, until everything is incorporated. Again, less is more. Over mixing will make your cookies worse not better.
-bake at 375 degrees for 7-8 minutes

The cinnamon seemed to stick better than the sugar. I started out plopping the little cookie balls in a bowlful of cinnamon sugar and coating by spooning the mixture on top. They were too cinnamon-y this way. Rolling the balls remedied the situation. I imagine the ziploc bag idea others spoke of works nicely. I will try it next time. These cookies are incredible when cooked correctly. I hope my mishaps will help the less seasoned baker. Good luck!

I've definitely found my master recipe for Snickerdoodles.  Only change was I used ALL butter, no shortening.  Other tips about baking exactly 8 min. is right on.  But this also depends on how large your dough balls are.  I use a heaping tablespoon (used a measuring spoon) of dough, about the size of a large walnut at 8 min.  Nice, chewy and very moist and gets even softer the next day.  Also, I agree on increasing the sugar in the cinnamon mixture.  I use 4 to 2 ratio of sugar to cinnamon.  A nice classic cookie and easy to make - just don't overmix once you add the flour.  Bakery quality and the ease of preparation makes it ideal to make with kids.

I have been making Snickerdoodles for years with the recipe from my 8th grade home ec class.  This recipe is exactly like that with the exception of 1/2 cup more flour.  The extra flour helps the dough from being so sticky when you roll it in your hands.  The dough has to be chilled for best results, too.

Oh my gosh.  I love Snickerdoodles and I'm sure that these are the best I have ever, ever, ever had!  Beautiful color.  Soft, light, buttery taste.  You can tell just by looking at the dough that it is going to be a good cookie.  The only thing I changed was that I used all butter because I didn't have any shortening.  I'm the only one that's tasted these so far, but I know they will be gone before the end of the day.  As the others here, I cannot say enough about this recipe.  Perhaps the finest cookie.

Perfect Snickerdoodle! Cookie dough with flavor, lots of cinnamon in the coating, crisp outside chewy inside.  Hints: - do NOT "cream" the butter/crisco/sugar like you would for a cake. "Creaming" is a method we use for cakes, waiting for the sugar to dissolve in the butter by whipping the  outta it in something like a KitchenAid. - I used my KitchenAid on the first setting, STIR. I mixed the softened butter and crisco til it was homogenous, then added the sugar and let it go for a good minute til mixed on the LOW setting, then the eggs and vanilla. I added the flour mix gradually on low and finished the last bit by hand. DO NOT OVERMIX. - I let it refrigerate for 1/2 hour, then used a cookie scoop for making the balls even. - If you have a dark cookie sheet, you'll want the oven at 375. If you have a light colored one, go ahead at 400. I use parchment paper, and I have an oven thermometer to make sure the temperature is correct. That is VERY important. - I baked a batch at 10 minutes at 375F on a light colored aluminum sheet pan.  Then I baked a batch at 400F for 8 minutes. - Wait for the cookies to "crack" through the coating, happens around minute 6.5, then bake another 1.5 minutes. - They were very "fall apart" while warm, so I kept them on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before moving to a cooling rack, lined with paper towel.  These are a really good traditional Snickerdoodle. The vanilla gives the dough a good flavor, don't leave it out!

Yum!  And I have a small cookie business, too.  I was out of cream of tartar, so I googled the substitution.  USE 4 TEASPOONS baking powder instead and NO baking soda (or cream of tartar).  Used extra cinnamon-sugar for rolling.  Gotta run some warm cookies to a friend's home!

These were the best snickerdoodles I've ever had!  It took me one sheet of cookies before I perfected the timing and size of the balls to make the 'perfect' snickerdoodle (crunchy edges and chewy but not underdone center), but once I did they were absolutely and exactly perfect, and I'm thrilled! I used the suggestion from "LIZA CAUTIVAR" (sort by most helpful) and used a ziplock with 3T white sugar and 3tsp. cinnamon to coat the balls, and flattened them on the baking tray with the bottom of a glass.  I ended up making slightly larger cookies (~1.5 - 2inch diam. balls of dough, baked for 11-12 min - until cracked all over and a little browner on edges). I really want to make another batch right this second and try adding cardamom (as per "SCHWA's" suggestion).  Fantastic cookies, thank you so much!!!

Good recipe after a few changes. I used 1 cup butter, omitted shortening & used 2 tsp. baking powder, omitted cream of tartar & baking soda. Also flatten with a fork before baking.

Excellent cookie. The only change I made was adding a bit more cinnamon to the cinnamon sugar.  I used a tablespoon.  Just a side note, if you need to test your baking SODA use VINEGAR. To test baking POWDER, use WATER.  Adding soda to water will only create soft water.

My cookies came out very flat and thin.  I tried this recipe twice and just didn't love the results even when I tried some of the alterations.

My Gosh, can I give these cookies ten stars. They were by far the best cookies I have ever baked. I'm only nineteen but I've had a lot of baking and cooking experience,and I have to say this is one of my all time favorite recipes. One thing I would change is the baking time factor. I don't know if its because electric ovens are hotter than gas ovens but I found out that a 6 1/2 minute cookie came out perfect. I lovey gooey, chewy cookies. They dissapeared so fast and were such a demand in my family and friends I ran out of most of the ingredients by the third day.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!! And so did all my family.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  I like softer cookies so I only cooked them for 7 1/2 or 8 min.  I followed someone elses advice and wet my hands with water before rolling the dough. I found the cinnamon-sugar coating stuck to it a lot better when I did that. Also, after coating the balls of dough and setting the balls on the pan I sprinkled a little bit more of the cinnamon-sugar coating on the tops of the dough balls to give it extra flavor before baking them.  The recipe says not to grease the pan but I did anyway because the cookies stuck to the pan. You don't HAVE to take them of the pan immediately but I think you should try. It helps. trust me.   I will most DEFIANTLY make these again.  Amazingly delicious. :-D

Splendiferious!  Because of a previous review I substituted 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice for the cream of tarter, mixing it together with the salt and b. soda before adding it to the rest, because of a life long adversion to the "after taste" of cream of tarter in Snickerdooles, these cookies were perfect perfect perfect!!! 
I also practically "double" rolled them in the cinn/sugar mix, and used a small meat baller to get the uniform size. I agree about the "air bake" sheets, I am starting not to use mine more and more.

Eight Snickerdoodle recipes later, THESE are the best!  Crispy/Chewy.  The key here is to make them big so the centers stay soft.  No little hard balls, alrighty?

Great recipe! All those who recommended
cooking the cookies for 7 minutes were
dead on. Perfect time. This is the 
first snickerdoodle recipe I've made that
hasn't spread. The shortening/butter 
mixture was perfect.

I double coated my cookies in the cinnamon-sugar mixture for extra flavor.

Holy Smokes!!!! This recipe is AMAZING!! I was never a Snickerdoodle girl until I made this last week - and forced again last night by my husband and son to make more (they don't even like baked goods!). They refused to let me bake Christmas cookies until I made more of these!

This is a compilation of the advice I've cut and pasted from others here and put in "my notes" section of the recipe so it prints out with it: "Bake for 8 min exactly! For the topping, I used 3T. sugar & 3.5 tsp. of cinnamon dumped in ziplock bag. Do not be afraid to over coat. It will NOT turn out too sweet - I'm not a fan of sweets!! If your cookie turns out flat, I'd check to see if your baking soda has expired. Also, if your eggs are too big the dough will spread too much. Most recipes call for large eggs, not extra large. When I make this recipe, I usually pour off just a tiny bit of the egg white, because I like my cookies puffy."

Regarding this advice: I did buy brand new Baking Soda just for this recipe since my soda is usually a few years old. I have not tried ridding some of the egg white yet since they seem puffy enough for me.

You MUST try this recipe! Literally, will change your life for the better!! OH - btw - the raw dough is so yummy!!!

Just baked my first batch and having my first cookie now (still warm-OMG)!  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 regular flour, and 1 cup butter because I didn't have shortening; they turned out perfectly.  I followed others' suggestions and increased the rolling sugar to 4 T and cinnamon to 1 T (we LOVE cinnamon). YUM, thank you!

oh my word! this recipe rocks! The only change I made was I set the oven at 375 instead of 400. I did not want the insides to be too chewy. They came out perfect. Only slighty chewy on the inside but nice and crisp on the edges. The dough is very soft and sticky after mixing and so I placed the whole bowl of dough in the freezer for awhile before I rolled the dough into balls. The mixture of cinnamon/sugar that you roll the balls in was purposely a little sugar heavy for my cookies because I started out with the suggested amount of cinammon but my small children did not care for it much.  They loved the cookies after I upped the granulated sugar. My mother is crazy about snickerdoodles and has made them since the 50's and she absolutely loved this recipe! It's a very simple recipe and extremely tasty. I've made many different snickerdoodle recipes and this is definitely the best. It did not spread alot for me (like one reviewer mentioned) but I think that might be because of the freezer.  I don't like it when cookies spread too thin so I'm glad that I decided to thoroughly chill the dough first. (I did not leave the dough in the freezer until frozen - only until cold. I would have used the fridge except that I was in a hurry!)

I was looking for a good Snickerdoodle recipe and tried this one.  I also tried one of the others listed on this site that use all shortening instead of half shortening and half butter like this one.  The butter does make a difference, because these cookies tasted better.  They had more "body" and better flavor, so this is the recipe I will use going forward.

Hubby said, "4 1/2 Stars add more sugar to the dough" Kids said "5 Stars"! I followed the other reviewers suggestions and did 3 teaspoons of Baking Powder (no Tartar in pantry). Took the great suggestion of putting Cinnamon/Sugar Coating in a gallon sized baggie (you can put your whole hand in to retrieve) - that worked fantastic! I scooped the dough with the melon baller and dropped on parchment. When I was done scooping, I made little balls and filled the Cinnamon Sugar Baggie with a batch of balls and then removed and put on the tray. Everything else was the same as stated in recipe. 8 
minutes cook time on parchment paper and immediate removal from pan to cooling on tile counter and they came out great. Melon Ball scoop netted 60 small cookies. The family is eating them so fast I would double the batch next time! Good cookie. Smells amazing and would make it again! 16 year old asked that I make them "bigger" next time. One other suggestion from a reviewer - I only buy XL Eggs. I cracked one egg and only used the yolk and used 1 whole other egg. I think that is why some of my other cookies have gone flat. Never thought about the size of the eggs. I learn from this site everyday! Thanks everyone!

Cookies tasted like nothing, if anything flour and maybe the cream of tarter. I've made this recipe 3 times already and each time they turned out to be crumbly and have no flavor. I've had snickerdoodles before and they were wonderful and didn't taste like these at all.

Crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside--all around perfect. I substituted butter for the shortening and they came out just fine.

I love this recipe.  I originally found it almost 5 years ago and my husband and friends have been begging for them ever since.

Be sure to cream the sugar and butter together first to make light and fluffy, then add other ingredients.  Also, only cook 8 minutes, then let them rest on the pan for 2 minutes before moving cookies to cooling rack.

Very yummy.  Changes: only used butter and added a dash of cinnamon to the dough.  Despite everyone saying only to leave them in for 8 minutes, the ones I did were way too under-cooked.  The ones I cooked for a minute or two longer worked better, and were still chewy.  I know it will depend on each person's stove so here's my advice:  Cook until the outside is set up and the inside is slightly undercooked.

Cookies baked up picture perfect and were chewy in the middle and crispy on the edges. Taste was much better than the other Snickerdoodle recipe I tried on this site.I would have given 5 stars if not for the very slight bitter aftertaste.

This is the best snickerdoodle recipe...I did make two changes to the recipe.  I didn't use the 1/2 cup shortening.  Instead, I used 1/2 cup of light olive oil.  I cooked the cookies at 350* for 8 minutes.  This made a cookie with a chewy inside and a crisp outside.  The cookies also freeze very well and when defrosted taste like they were just baked.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent!  I froze the dough in balls and bake for 6 min at 400* then 8+ min at 350*.  They are crispy on the outside, perfect in the middle.  Plus I only bake what I need - rather than baking and eating them ALL!

I know this is a winner, it is the same recipe my grandmother passed on to me 14 years ago. Myfamily and friends love these cookies and I have to make about 50 dozen or so at Christmas because of all the requests I get. If you have never made these try them, they are incredibly easy to make and the taste and texture is to die for.

These cookies turned out very good. I love cinnamon and sugar and these were so light in texture.  I really enjoy the ooey gooey stuff but these were a nice change of pace.  Thanks Mrs. Siggs.

I made this recipe with gluten free flour and it turned out really well.  I used Namaste gluten free flour which I bought from Costco, and followed the recipe just substituting the flour cup for cup.  I followed the other reviewers suggestions to take the cookies out at exactly 8 minutes.  I had placed them on parchment paper so after I pulled them out of the oven, I just slid the paper and cookies onto a cooling rack.  I also used the suggestion of putting the sugar and cinnamon in a large zip lock bag and tossing the balls of cookie dough in there to coat before placing on the baking sheet.  Wonderful taste and a great texture.  They are disappearing quickly because they are so yummy!

These are pretty good, but honestly I'm not sure what the big to-do is. It was my first time making snickerdoodles, so this very well might be the greatest recipe for them but I just wasn't blown away. I followed other reviewers' advice to increase the amount of cinnamon sugar and had way more than I needed, so I think sticking with 2:2 on that instead of 3:3 would be just fine.

Awesome recipe!....perfect as written, but once when I wanted to make them, I did not have some cream of tartar so decided to try doubling the baking soda and they turned out just as good... so please don't let not having cream of tartar deter you from trying this great recipe.  I also bake at 375 degrees for 8mins.  Thanks for submitting this great recipe.

It's a dependable "old chestnut" that will never fail to please both young and old. Slightly crispy on the outside from the sugar coating, yet delightfully soft and chewy on the inside. You will never go wrong with this recipe. I've been making it for more than 40 years from the Betty Crocker Cookbook, and there are never, ever enough. If I double it, my family just eats twice as much!

Good cookies! I didn't overmix, first cookie sheet I rolled the balls after I coated them and they flattened out, the next 3 trays I scooped and just gently rolled around in the sugar and placed on the sheets and they were nice and plump, didn't spread out. These were great! Some I let rest a minute before taking off tray, some I didn't, were fine both ways.

Best snickerdoodle recipe, and have tried a lot.  I used all unsalted butter instead of shortening and also added a tablespoon of cinnamin mixed in the dough.  Turned out awesome, have had many ask for the recipe.

Maybe I didn't make these cookies right, but I found this recipe to be too "Eggy". It could be the taste of the shortening, but I won't make these again. I also used a cookie scooper to form the balls, and I found the cookies did not spread at all.

So, my 3 year old ate my Dad's Angel Food Cake, and I needed a replacement FAST! I chose to make a batch of Snicker-doodles to try and smooth over the pain of a lost Angel Food. Instead of using my Mum's tried and true recipe (I didn't want to hunt it down), I used the best rated one on here. My cookies have been in the oven for 15 minutes and are still smooshie sponges! I have no idea what I did wrong, as I am a seasoned cookie baker. :/ Hm. Lesson learned: 1.)Put the cake higher up next time. 2.)Use the recipe you KNOW works best.

I made these yesterday and they are simply wonderful! Without a doubt the BEST Snickerdoodle recipe I have ever tried or eaten. I made them exactly as directed with just 2 exceptions. I omitted the use of shortening and used all butter instead and I baked them for exactly 8 minutes as another reviewer recommended. The result was excellent. This recipe is a keeper and will be made at my house for many years to come!

Several people said these were the best sugar cookies they have ever had!  I used all butter instead of shortening and since it was salted butter there was maybe a tad too much salt, but no one but me noticed.  The cookies were very chewy and even better the next day!

This recipe is great! Make sure you have fresh baking soda and also refrigerating the dough for an hour before scooping and baking helps keep them from falling flat. I actually made a pumpkin spice version, replacing the shortening with 3/4 cup pumpkin puree and using pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. They were great!

This makes gorgeous big chewie cookies! Just like a snickerdoodle should be both in flavor and texture. These remind me of home, so thank you for the recipe! I live in a hot, humid climate, and most of the time any dough I make starts to melt before I can get it onto the cookie sheet. These were no exception, and I think they turned out flatter due to this, but I kept the dough refrigerated between batches and it was easier to work with. I made some smaller cookies too, to sandwich with eggnog-flavored frosting for Christmas! But must cook small ones for more like 7 minutes or less, or they will be too crunchy. (fill with buttercream, flavored with 1 tsp vanilla, 1.5 tsp cinnamon, .5 tsp cloves and 1.5 tsp nutmeg! sandwich cookies and refridgerate for a couple hours to set)

Hands-down the best snickerdoodle recipe I have tried.  Due to personal preference I used all butter instead of half butter and half shortening as the recipe calls for.  The cookies still came out thick, tender, and chewy.  I recommend mixing only until just combined (including the "creaming" step; creaming for too long turns a chewy cookie into a cakey cookie) for the best results.  I was wary about the high baking temp, but it worked well.  The cinnamon in the coating makes it hard to tell by sight when the cookies are done, so I took mine out right at 8 minutes; they were done just right.  My search for the ultimate snickerdoodle is complete!

I don't think these cookies are sweet enough, and I can taste the cream of tartar which is very bitter and leaves an aftertaste.

These cookies are perfect.  Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  Followed the recipe exactly except increased the sugar to 3 TBSP and cinnamon to 1 TBSP to roll the dough.  They took 12 minutes to bake in my oven.

I just finished making these. Delicious! The first attempt, I accidently used too much flour and not enough sugar- my fault, no the recipes'. The second time, it came out perfect. They look and taste amazing, and my family won't stop picking! I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 3 tbsp. of sugar and 3 tsp. of cinnamon. I definitely feel that the extra was needed. It's the perfect amount. Follow this recipe to the letter and you can't go wrong! I can't wait to share these with everyone in school!

Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, perfect recipe!  Followed the recipe exactly and I cooked them for 6 minutes, turned them around, then another 1 1/2 minutes.  I rolled them in a bowl of cinnamon and sugar instead of a bag, it just seems to work better for me!  Very delicious!

Delicious!!  These are so easy to make and so absolutely delicious.  This recipe is a keeper.  I halved the recipe since there were just two of us and kind of wish I'd made the whole batch-- they were gone in minutes!  I followed the advice of others and took the cookies out at 8 minutes and removed them from the baking sheet immediately.  After cooling, they were crisp at the edges, chewy in the middle.  Perfect!  Oh, I also took the advice to only roll the cinnamon-sugar mixture on top of the balls of dough.  Good advice.  The two cookies that I rolled completely in the cinnamon-sugar were burned a bit on the edges & bottom.  Better to just coat the top.

Excellent, it will replace my trusted old Betty Crocker recipe.  I learned 30 years ago to not roll Snickerdoodles in the cinnamon/sugar but just dab the ball on top side in the mixture, no dark bottomed cookies.

WOW.
These were the best & funnest cookies I have ever made. I am 15 years old, and made these so easily. I already had everything that I needed except shortening, which i went out to the store and bought.

Theses are the only things I did different: 
[thanks to all the reviews]

1.Baked for EXACTLY 8 minutes, don't do it any longer.
2.I mixed about 4 tablespoons of white sugar, and 4 teaspoons of cinnamon.
3.I put the cinnamon/sugar mixture in a baggy, dropped the ball of dough in and coated it by shaking it up.
[thanks Joy, it was ALOT less messy]
4.I realized that i was making dough for 48 cookies when i finised mixing it. Lol, i didn't intend to make that much, but my family gobbled them up anyways. I made them a little bigger, and came out with 36, still just as tasty but softer in the middle..yum. ^-^

*Coating it FULLY makes them much tastier!

My whole family LOVED them and they were gone quick! Hope you have a much fun making these as i did! :]

These are simple cinnamon sugar cookies but they are fantastic!  The flavor and texture are wonderful. Don't bake more than 8 minues unless you want them more crisp than chewy.  They won't look done at 8 minutes, but take them out of the oven anyway!

I've been making this recipe for quite some time now and have been meaning to rate this...they are absolutely delicious and are everyone's favorite! From adults to the teens and right down to the little ones. A sure pleaser to bring anywhere. Just be sure not to bake too long... As soon as you see a crack in the top take them out...they will finish doing what they need to do while cooling. I find if I keep them in too long they fall apart if you take them out around 9 min. they are soft and chewy. You won't be dissapointed!

These are on of my family favorites and a standby cookie recipe. Roll in red and green sugar for Xmas time. I keep them in a plastic container with a slice of bread to keep them moist. Works like a charm. People ask me for these every year.

I am very perplexed by the previous ratings on this cookie- I needed to take cookies to a reception, and this recipe got so many 5-star reviews that I thought it would be a "can't miss". WRONG! I was too disappointed in these to take to the gathering. I followed the recipe to the letter, with the exceptions of chilling the dough before rolling, lowering the oven temp(375) and baking on silpat-lined cookie sheets (if I had not, I am certain they would have been burned on the bottom.)The finished cookies were not attractive (no crackling like you expect on traditional snickerdoodles) and had no flavor other than a strong cream-of-tartar aftertaste that stayed with me all day (I used a brand new bottle). My taste-tester husband and daughter (who NEVER turn down a cookie, each ate one, and the rest have sat in a container untouched for 3 days- unheard of in this household!)I'm afraid the rest will get tossed, and I will continue searching for a better recipe.

They were good cookies, the typical recipe for snickerdoodles. No special ingredients. Be careful not to overcook. Better texture was achieved by chilling the dough

I made these tonight for Thanksgiving.  I will probably have to make another batch since my family loved them so much.  I may not have enough to take to Grandma's House.  I stirred it by hand, and added more cinnamon and sugar, just as suggested by other reviews.  I also made them bigger than usual, making the outside crunchy and the inside soft.  Thank you for sharing!

Absolutely delicious!!!  My daughter wanted a cookie so I made these up in only 1 hr start to last cookie out of the oven.  Quicker than running to the store and oh so much better.  These were my favorite cookies growing up.  Thank you for submitting this recipe!!

I tried this recipe because for years I've been making Mrs. Sigg's Peanut Butter Cookies and LOVE them.  This Snickerdoodle recipe is so stinking good!  Tips for beginning bakers:  Use parchment paper.  If your cookie sheets are dark, reduce baking time.  LOVE LOVE LOVE these!

Perfect Snickerdoodle recipe!  The cookies are soft & delicious.  8 minutes was just right.  I used my one tablespoon scoop for perfect portioning.  No changes needed to this recipe.

Just made these and they came out perfectly—crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. However, I used butter instead of the shortening. Because of this, I had to chill the dough as it was otherwise too soft to handle.

This is the best recipe I've found for these cookies so far.

Great recipe, I followed it exactly.  The cookies were flavorful and the perfect amount of fluffy.  I wouldn't bother reading the least positive reviews, they're written by people with expired cream of tartar and no idea what this cookie should taste like.  Also, there is no need for parchment paper with a butter cookie, that's just silly.

Great recipe! I put the cinnamon-sugar mixture in a paper sandwich bag and gently shook about 4 cookies at a time in it. It saves time rolling each one. Eight minutes produced a perfect cookie.

OMG! FAB! I followed the recipe exactly and they were PERFECTION. I decided to double the recipe and had cookies all over the place. They do freeze well, although they tend to get a little crisper after freezing. Great with a cup of coffee! I also went a little overboard on the time. I think the 8-10 min. is just right, and the cookies can even cool on the cookie sheet without a problem. I did mine for 10-12 min. and while still good, they were firmer. Another home-run recipe from Allrecipes.com...my husband is happy, and so am I!

Cook these for exactly 8 mins and they are perfect. They seem really soft at first, but once you cool them for about ten minutes they are perfectly heavenly. One of my friends told me they were the best cookies she'd ever had. Amazing when warm!

So easy and they come out perfect every time!  The only change I make is to use 3 tablespoons sugar, one teaspoon Chinese cinnamon, and two  teaspoons regular cinnamon. Gives them a little extra kick of spice.

I prefer a flat and crisp snicker doodle.  So after rolling the dough balls in the cinnamon/sugar, I use a smooth glass bottom dipped in the cinnamon and sugar to pre press the cookie dough prior to baking  and bake for the full 10 minutes.

I really wanted these to be the best ever, but, alas, I appear to be one of the people whose cookies spread out over the pan.  Before you ask, all my ingredients were fresh from the grocery and I don't live in high altitude, so, I'm unsure what the heck I did.  They are tasty though not very pretty.  I'm going to use them as a crumble topping for homemade cinnamon ice cream...no one will ever know I messed them up! :)

Very tasty cookies but mine came out crispy rather than chewy, so not exactly what I was expecting but still very good.  I only baked for 8 minutes but perhaps this was too long in my oven, or maybe it was the all butter instead of recommended 1/2 shortening?
2nd time around, I added lime zest and exchanged 1/2 the cinnamon for nutmeg, and baked at 375 degrees, and they were chewy and delicious!

Awesome cookie! They were nice and chewy. I followed the directions exactly, except that I used butter in place of shorterning (I do that in all baking recipes). The only complaint I have are that they weren't visually appealing. My cookies didn't crack like a lot of the other users' cookies did. they were nice and round and chewy. Yum! They reminded me of the cracked sugar cookies on this site. I know another user mentioned the overpowering cream of tartar taste, but I didn't taste it at all.

400 was WAY to high a temp to bake cookies at!!! My first batch burned and didn't spread out at all.  I lowered the temp to 350 and the rest turned out perfectly but I was upset to have ruined the first batch.

This is my go-to Snickerdoodle Cookie recipe.  I did make two changes to the original recipe.  One was to up the cinnamon/sugar mixture to 1 Tbl. ground cinnamon to 3 Tbl. sugar.  Secondly, I baked these at 350* for 9 min. in my convection oven.  This resulted in a cookie that puffed up while baking, but did flatten out while cooling which resulted in a crispy cookie on the outside, but tender and a bit chewy on the inside.  Perfection!

PERFECTION.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Used parchment paper.  Took out of the oven excactly at 8 minutes, and then slid the parchment paper off the hot cookie sheet and let the cookies cool.  SO, SO GOOD!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe, I follow the recipe and never have had any problems (except the occasion that I don't have shortening I will use all butter). One thing I do different is I double the cinnamon/sugar part, that is so I won't run low on it, and the extra I just use for cinnamon toast  :)

For those of you who have trouble with flat cookies it is probably because you mix the dough to much. Try just barely mixing it and the cookies should turn out great, that is what I do and my cookies turned out fluffy even when using a mixer  :)

I have tried many snickerdoodle recipes trying to find one that makes them the way I love them. This is it! I made very few changes, and the ones I did had to do more with trying to make it a bit healthier, what I had on hand, and the fact that I live in high altitude. I used margarine instead of butter, and subbed unsweetened applesauce for half of the shortening, and brought these and the eggs to room temperature before mixing. I used splenda for about 1/4 cup of the sugar. I added 1/4 cup of flour and made that addition whole wheat. I didn't have any cream of tartar, so I just left it out. I increased the baking soda to 2 tsp because I was concerned with the age of my soda. I increased the amounts of sugar and cinnamon for dipping to 3 T and 3 1/2 tsp respectively. I baked on foil lined cookie sheets for 8 minutes at 375. The foil made for easy clean up as well as easy transfer to a cooling rack. I got 3 dozen cookies, so I think I roll mine a little larger than Mrs. Sigg, but they are perfect. They are not dry at all, and not flat (something that happens a lot at high altitudes). Puffy, soft, chewy, perfectly sweet without going overboard. The only thing I might do differently next time is to add some cinnamon to the dough, but that's just because I'm crazy about cinnamon and has nothing to do with the recipe itself. This is my new snickerdoodle recipe, and I will continue to tweak it to make it as healthy as possible without compromising how delicious they are.

Delicious! They turned out perfect for me. I only baked them for 8-9 minutes. With 10 they got hard, but with a bit less (right before they brown on the edges) they stay nice and soft.

SO DELICIOUS! I've never had a snickerdoodle before (*gasp*), so I didn't know what to expect, but I love cinnamon so I knew it would be good either way. I was not expecting this! They're crispy on the edges and chewy in the centre. I halved the recipe and used all butter. I baked them at 375 for 8 minutes, as recommended in other reviews. I don't think I'll ever use another snickerdoodle recipe!

I'm joining the Mrs. Sigg's bandwagon! Like others I used all butter and added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the batter for extra flavor.  Chilled batter for 1 hour before baking. Took the cookies to work and they disappeared in minutes......  these are my go-to cookies in a pinch to please a crowd.

1. Dough may spread too much if eggs are too big  2. Bake 8 min, not until they look done.   3. Use butter AND eggs that are room temp. All butter OK.   4. Mix dry & wet separately.   5. Hand mix. Do not overmix.   6. If no cream of tartar, use 2 tsp. of white vinegar OR lemon juice.   7. Use 1:1 ratio of cinn & sugar (a little more cinnamon is ok)   8. No need to grease pan - it doesn't stick to newer cookie sheets  9. Chill dough if cookies flatten too much - shape is better too

I just finished making these...WOW!!! They are the best Snickerdoodles (I would say best cookies but I love chocolate too much!) I have ever had! The recipe is perfect and it made exactly 4 dozen cookies...and exactly the perfect amount of the sugar/cinnamon mixture to coat every cookie without any leftover! AMAZING!!!

They are delicious and very pretty, but I leave out the cream of tartar, I think it makes them taste too tangy. Overall an awesome recipe, they turn out perfectly every time (and the amount of sugar and cinnamon is EXACTLY what is needed -every time!)

sorry-they were as flat as a pancake and the aftertaste was nasty.  Followed directions to a T.  Now I have flat, square cookies to take to a picnic. Oh, and I used brand new, freshly opened b. soda and cream of tarter.

These, in my opinion are the perfect snickerdoodle.  The came out just right, not too crunchy and not too soft, just right.  THIS is the only snickerdoodle recipe I will ever use again!!  My little boy and I are going to surprise Daddy with his favorite cookies when he gets home.  We used butter flavor crisco for the shortening today and they are delicious!!!

Based on the many rave reviews, I decided stray away from my usual recipe to give this version a try. I DID end up having to double the cinnamon-sugar mixture. They were baked for exactly 8 min. and the texture was perfect: soft and chewy. The reason why I give this cookie 4 stars is because I didn't care for the aroma of the Crisco. Some may say that shortening gives cookies that 'old fashion' taste, but I wasn't too keen on it. The texture and cinnamon flavor are phenomenal though. Friends who are new to baking cookies: Parchment paper (to line your cookie sheet(s)) is your best friend! You can re-use parchment paper for several batches of cookies without having to wash each cookie sheet. This saves alot of time for those of us who bake several dozens of different varities of cookies during the holidays. It also makes for easier removal of the most fragile cookies. No need to grease the cookie sheets either. I also used my trusty "cookie scoop" to get uniform sizes before rolling into balls. I had many high praises from friends and family who received these snickerdoodles as gifts. Definitely worth a try!

Help! I have read reviews all morning for this recipe and my only major problem with this cookie is the after taste with the cream of tartar, ive never used it before and i do not like the nasty taste in my mouth. Can i just omit the cream of tartar all together?

I've made this recipe a dozen times and it always turns out fantastic!

A few tips:
Use 1 cup butter not 1/2cup butter & 1/2 cup shortening

Bake for exactly 7minutes (On a gas oven) & remove from cookie sheet immediately & transfer to a cooling rack

Dip the dough ball in the cinn/sugar (rather than roll it), otherwise it will slightly burn on the bottom

Also, this recipe freezes really well, so if you can double it!  It makes exactly 4 dozen (super-ball-sized in the raw) cookies.  Perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

I think that these were some of the best cookies I have ever made! They taste just like the cookies from the mall. One helpful tip is not to overcook. I like my cookies to have a soft chewy texture not the dry crumbly. 8 min exactly does the trick. The first time I left them in for 8 min I thought they looked raw in the middle. After a few minutes of cooling the cookies were perfect! If u like snickerdoodles these are the best ever!

Completely Delicious! I only added 1 tsp. butter flavoring to this recipe. Incorporate your shortening/butter and sugar well using a mixer. I used a smaller cookie scoop and got nearly 70 cookies out of this recipe. I baked at 400 degrees for 7 minutes only. And take off cookie sheet immediately to cool on wire rack! SENSATIONAL & SIMPLE!

This is the first time I've ever attempted to bake these (and only my second attempt at baking homemade cookies).  And boy did they turn out well!  I did it the old-school way, literally, I used a wooden spoon to mix it because I don't have a beater.  I bet mom's in the 50's had super strong right arms.

these were scrumptious! i tripled the cinnamon sugar coating, and used margarine because i didn't have any butter or shortening.
i baked the first batch at 375F for 10 min, they came out with a very light, cake like texture. 
the 2nd batch i baked at 400F for 8 min, the edges were crisper and centers were a little denser than cakelike, more chewy than fluffy. 
bake them at 400F for 10 min and they come out more crisp and less chewy. :) alter the baking temp/ time to your liking!

This recipe was FLAWLESSly delicious. I followed the recipe very closely with a few  changes. 

Note 1: Cream of Tartar leaves a very disgusting after-taste. My advice is to not use it. At all. In fact, throw it out if you are only using it for cookies. Substitute 1 tsp cream of tartar ALWAYS with 1 tsp. fresh lemon juice.
Note 2: If you don't want hard cookies, change the baking temperature to 375º. And bake for 7:50-8:10 minutes depending on the size of your ball of cookie. Mine were approximately 1.7 inches in diameter. 
Note 3: Hand beat. Looks better!

Also, instead of using just plain white sugar for the coating, try a little mix of brown sugar and cane sugar. The aroma and taste is much more interesting.

Good cookie, nice and crispy. However my mini sized apartment oven which is too small for my good cookie sheets I need to use my smaller dark coated ones. At 400 for 8 minutes the sugar on the bottom burns so I cooked for 7m. Maybe next time I'll bake at 375.

YUM!  I made these in a cookie bar pan.  I pressed the dough into the pan and sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar mixture on top.  I baked in 375 degree oven for 15-20 minutes.  These cut wonderfully and didn't take as long to bake in my already hot kitchen! Thanks

These were very good! I followed the recipe as is. My shortening was butter flavored, don't know if that makes a huge difference or not. I cooked them for 8 minutes, and they definitely didn't seem done at all when they came out, but I just gave previous reviews the benefit of the doubt and sure enough, they turned out crunchy on the outside, chewy in the inside once they cooled completely. I really think that I made mine a little bigger than the recipe called for because I only ended up with 30 cookies, however, they weren't huge. To me, they were average size. I put the cinnamon and sugar in a plastic bag and shook the cookies in it one at a time, worked great! Next time I make these though, I will only add 1 t. of cinnamon to 2 T. of sugar because I found these to have just a bit TOO strong of a cinnamon flavor. I mixed all by hand and they turned out very pretty and not flat. So, the recipe AS IS is great! Just needs a little less cinnamon for my taste. Thanks!

Excellent; I Loved this recipe! I followed the directions except that I substituted the lemon juice for the cream of tarter. The cookies did not get too flat (as some others said). if you combine shortening and butter as the recipe calls for and don't use all butter, they'll keep a nice shape.

My oven runs hot so I baked them at 375 for 7-8 minutes. Coming out they almost look like they need to stay in a minute longer, but once they cooled they were perfect--crisp on the outside and chewy and cakelike on the inside. They stayed this way for about 3 days then began to dry out.

I got 30 out of one batch and stuck the dough in the fridge as some others suggested to make it easier to form the balls. Then, I shook the balls in a ziplock with a 2-to-1 cinnamon sugar mix.

In our opinion, these taste just like the snickerdoodles at Mrs. Field's.

The butter/shortening combo is good...the butter gives yummy flavor and moistness  while the shortening helps to give the cookie a crispiness. So don't use all butter unless you are looking for a cake-like cookie. Anyway this recipe made a delicious cookie that I am going to use all year long!

Excellent cookie!!! I must admit that I did try them a couple months ago and for whatever reason they did not turn out. They flattened in the oven really badly. But this time they are perfect, not flat at all. I made 2 batches in the last 24 hours and they are flawless. I did make a few minor changes to the recipe but nothing major. For the shortening portion I used butter flavored Crisco. I reduced the cream of tartar down to 1 and 1/2 teaspoons per another reviewers suggestion. I froze the dough for about 30 minutes and baked them with an oven temperature of 375 degrees. Between 8 and 9 minutes cooking time worked the best for me. I also let the cookies sit on the baking sheet for a few minutes to set up a bit so I didn't have any breakage. I was only able to make 26 cookies from this recipe using a #40 size cookie scoop. They are a great size though. -Not too big not too little. For the cinnamon and sugar mixture I used 5 tablespoons sugar and 4 teaspoons cinnamon and had some left over but it was so much easier to coat the cookies if you have a lot in the bowl. Thanks so much for the recipe Mrs. Siggs!!! Look for my picture of my cookies.

GREAT recipe.  I had no intention of leaving feedback since obviously this recipe has gotten such rave reviews, but my husband told me that these were SO GOOD that I HAD to leave one, LOL.  Anyhow...I used a small ice cream scoop/large melon baller to scoop the dough, and I ended up with 6 dozen cookies.  Cooked on a stone for exactly eight minutes gave me the best results...crispy outside...chewy inside.  This one is a keeper!

wonderful cookie! I've made this at least 10 times and everyone absolutely loves them.  Of course, everytime after I make it, i swear that I'll start a new diet tomorrow...but i guess that's how you know something's really good!

This is the best Snickerdoodle cookie I have found and I have tried many. If you are having problems with your cookies being flat it is most likely your butter. The water content in butter varies so use european butter or better quality butter for baking.Use store brands for non baking purposes.

I have been baking professionally since I was a little girl because I am the daughter of a chef.  These are truly the best snickerdoodles I have ever tasted!  I baked them regularly in a cafe I worked at and they were everyones favorite--just be sure not to overbake them or they won't be chewy!  I always take them out when the center is still puffed up but the edges are set to the touch.  let them cool a few mins on the sheet and they will fall and crinkle beautifully.

Fantastic! I took the advice and suggestions of previous reviewers, as well as making my own modifications. Used a full cup of Earth Balance non-hydrogenated "margarine," instead of doing half shortening. Don't care for the taste of shortening. Second, in place of the 2 eggs, I used 1/4 c. water (add a little more if needed). Third, I doubled the cinnamon sugar mixture, because I ran out. Fourth, I baked the cookies at 350 F, and found that they were perfect at 8 minutes. Absolutely yummy. An added plus: those who can't have any dairy and/or eggs will be able to have some as well. My mum used the exact same recipe I used here, but added the 2 eggs instead of the 1/4 c. water. People couldn't tell the difference between the two! Thanks, Mrs. Siggs. :o)

Snickerdoodles are my absolute favorite cookie, so I was hesitant to try a different recipe than my grandmother's.  Sorry grandma!!  This is by far the best snickerdoodle recipe I've ever tasted.  11 minutes and they were absolutely perfect, chewy in the middle and crisp around the edges!!  I sprinkled a little cinnamon and sugar miture on top as soon as they came out of the oven too.  Also included these on my Christmas cookie plate for the neighbors, and got rave reviews!!  Thanks so much, will keep these in constant stock at my house!!!

Everyone loved these!  I only wished I had the original ingredients because I know it affected the overall outcome.  I didn't have baking soda, so I had to substitute baking powder and instead of rising, it spreaded out to a thin cookie, like chocolate chip cookies.  I also had to substitute vinegar for the cream of tartar (2 teaspoons vinegar= 1 teaspoon tartar).  And the sugar coating, you definitely need to double it, I ran out 1/2 way through the batch and had to make another.  Cookie tasted great, but next time, I'm definitely using the original ingredients.

I was disappointed.  I think the recipe calls for too much soda, caused a kind of bad aftertaste I thought. Also kind of eggy, and not cookielike.

I was looking for a 'school-friendly' (ie - no peanuts, chocolate, etc.) recipe for my daughter's preschool graduation party and these definitely worked!  Super easy to make and everybody loved them (kids and adults alike).  I baked them at 375 for 8 minutes and that was just enough to keep them crispy outside but chewy inside. These will definitely be made a lot at my house from now on.

I can't believe how boring and bland these cookies were after seeing such a high rating!!  I could only eat one cookie.  I tried to give the rest away but was still left with a few that I will throw away.  I bake (and LOVE) cookies several times a week.  These were BORING.  What it is about these that appeals to people?  I'm dumbfounded.

I love my snickerdoodle recipe but wanted to try something new.  I followed this recipe to a tee with wonderful results. The cookies came out beautiful, nicely raised, crisp on the outside and perfectly chewy inside and although I love the soft texture I still like the taste of an all butter recipe, hence the 4 stars.

Worked perfectly.  I did the baking soda test (after reading reviews) and it didn't fizz, so I added the 1/8 tsp baking powder to get it to rise.  Followed reviewers' advice.  Mixed by hand instead of electric mixer.  Rolled in sugar/cin instead of shaking.  Cooked 8 minutes on parchment paper and slid off the pan immediately upon removing from oven.  Perfect.  I froze them and am going to hope they taste freshly baked Friday when I have to use them for a cookie bar!!!  Thank you for the suggestions.  Great recipe.

FINALLY!! I have been searching for a good snickerdoodle recipe for years - the last one I tried was terrible, they were hard and dry and ended up as food for the birds outside. These are tender and crisp and chewy, I will DEFINITELY make these again!

Excellent cookie recipe.  Buttery, vanilla-cinnamony goodness in every bite.  Use the smallest ice cream/cookie scoop, bake for 8 minutes.  Perfect every time!

This Recipe was wonderful. I didn't get any of the supposedly awful aftertaste, even in the uncooked dough. . . :D They were a hit all around. Great cookies.

I love this recipe. Make sure you use fresh baking soda. If you want a cookie that doesn't spread out make sure you put the dough in the fridge for a bit. They will come out puffy. You will still get the crunchy and chewy yumminess! Make sure not to over bake though! :-)

I thought these tasted pretty good. Although, I have nothing to compare them to as I don't recall ever having a snickerdoodle. I was a little let down as I had planned them as an extra dessert to cheesecake I was making for 4th of July. These just kind of scream Christmas! Only change I made was making 1/2 a recipe, which yielded 26 cookies with a cookie scoop. I also just used all butter. FOLLOW the directions at the end regarding not over-cooking! If they seem like they only need about 1 more minute, to bake, let them rest on the sheet out of the oven for that minute. I did 2 batches. One I baked until exactly done, because I was busy. They became hard and more flat when cooled. The other I took out early, as insinuated. Have a rack handy, because after no more than 2-3 minutes I would transfer them to it so as to not over-bake. My second batch stayed nice and soft in the center, and had a thicker texture, following the last step more precisely.

Friendly tip for newbie bakers like me - if you don't have cream of tartar, baking powder is the combination of two parts cream of tartar one part baking soda, so just use 3 tsp. baking powder. I feel like this recipe almost deserves losing a star for not mentioning it.

This is a great recipe. Definitely bring butter AND eggs to room temperature and also hand mix this dough. Huge difference. I've been using this recipe for over a year now, my husband is addicted to it!!

These are delicious! The texture is nice but they do need to be puffier:  try taking them out right at 8 minutes and see how they are.

Fantastic! The only change I made was switching out the shortening for butter (used all butter). I don't use shortening, wont allow it in my kitchen, but I find butter always works just as well. I bake a lot and this recipe was up there with the best! The dough tastes amazing as well, my kids and I had a hard time not eating it all before baking them ;) I used a 1" scoop to make easy and even balls of dough. Mixed the cinnamon sugar to my liking. Making 1" balls, they baked to perfection in 7 minutes. The dough does spread a lot more than you'd expect, so leave extra room. Even though they spread a lot, they were still fluffy, not flat at all. They haven't even cooled yet, so I cannot say whether or not they'll be chewy cookies tomorrow, but I sure hope they will. I don't like crunchy cookies.

This has been labeled as crack cookies by everyone who tries them. The only change I made was to switch the shortening to butter as well to keep it all butter, and go to the shorter time period for cooking to keep them soft.

I do not see how this recipe could be improved on in any way. They are perfection! I used a hand mixer to do all the stirring. I used a little less cinnamon than it called for. The cookies turned out crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside! The entire batch was devoured. Thanks so much!

These are probably the best snickerdoodles I've ever made.  I didn't have shortening, so I went straight butter and I didn't have cream of tartar, so I used 3 tsp of baking powder instead of the tartar and baking soda, but they were still fluffy and soft with a cinnamon-sugar crunch on the outside.  So amazing.  Thank you for this recipe.

I may have tripled the amount of cinnamon /sugar mixture these were rolled in. One thing I find with snicker doodles: you can never roll them too much!! Next time I will make these a little smaller. Otherwise they were absolutely DELISH. Watch your time!! Timing is crucial to a good snicker doodle. These are my sisters favourite and she said they were the best she's ever had. Thanks for submitting!!

I love this cookie! Everyone at work kept nodding in approval as esrly as the first bite. They said the texture and taste was perfect. I baked this in the morning before my kids woke up for school and while i was preparing myself for work. It was do easy to make. My daughter woke up early to the smell of cinnamon and was more than happy to roll the balls in the cinnamon mixture. She devoured piece after piece and also asked me to put some in her lunchbox. A keeper! Thanks for sharing.

Yum! I have never made these cookies before but good grief they are special! My husband hates cinnamon with a passion so I  rolled a third in nutmeg sugar, a third in ginger sugar and a third in cinnamon sugar. I have only tried the nutmeg one so far but it's delish! We have a yard sale coming up and my son is doing a lemonade stand - these will be awesome for that, if I can stop the grabbing after school hands from "trying them to make sure they are good"!

Best snickerdoodle i've ever had! I made a few slight adjustments based on other reviews. I suggest you try these changes, as I had perfect cookies! 1. Bake EXACTLY 8 min. no more no less. 2. Hand mixing is a definite must. 3. I put the cinnamon/sugar topping in a ziploc bag and used 3T sugar and 3.5tsp cinnamon. I then put each dough ball in the bag and shook it. So much easier! 4. YOU MUST take the cookies off the baking sheet immedietly after they come out. 5. Pour off some of the egg white to make the cookies fluffier.  Good luck!, and don't be afraid to really coat the dough in the cinnamon/sugar.

I love snickerdoodles :) especially these, but a quick tip.. if like me you never have cream of tartar on hand: replace the baking soda and the cream of tartar in the recipe with baking powder. One teaspoon of baking powder replaces 1/3 tsp of baking soda and 2/3 tsp cream of tartar  - this generally works :).. Now I'm back to eating snickerdoodles! :) Thanks for a beautiful and yummmy cookie!!!

They were ok! I guess they taste how a snickerdoodle ought to. I guess I'm just not a fan of snickerdoodles.

I came across this recipe years ago and the first year I made them they were a hit.  Now every year I have everyone asking when I'm making them.  My kids alone ate 6 dozen this past weekend!  These are definitely the best cookies I've ever made!  I am able to get a few a more cookies from the recipe by using the pampered chef small scoop to measure the dough!

Excellent recipe that yielded gently crispy edges and a pillow-soft center. I will be serving these for a gathering tonight and they turned out just perfect. **For reviewers having trouble with flat cookies, it is likely due to how soft your butter is. Remember, when a recipe calls for softened butter, it means 'room temperature' - NOT melted. Even using the microwave to soften butter will cause it to become melted in the center. In almost all cookie recipes, using any degree of melted butter will result in a runny, flat cookie.**

Awesome! Be sure to cook for 8 minutes exactly! Also, make a mark on the cookie with a fork for decoration. I'm going to hand mix it next time.... to make it look pretty! (:

I love these and my friends do too.  I took the suggestion to lower the oven to 375 degrees and I baked them just 8 minutes.  Used a small ice cream scoop to make the balls and shook them in a bag with cinnamon and sugar as recommended.  Perfection!

They turned out great! Well, at least the first batch did. With the 2nd and 3rd, the wine I was drinking started catching up with me and I burned them. So I would suggest definitely trying the lower end of the time range for baking and checking frequently. However, these babies were positively delicious. Highly recommend!

I've made these several times and they always come out perfect and are a hit. This recipe makes about 40 mid-sized cookies. Make sure you don't leave them in too long! --I bake them about 8 minutes

If you don't have cream of tartar...just use 3 teaspoons baking POWDER instead of the tartar AND the baking soda (sub. the powder for both the tartar and the soda).  My turned out just as light.

I changed this up a little. I added about a tablespoon of cinnamon to the actual batter, and I think it made a big difference. I love cinnamon, and normally I hate snickerdoodles because I don't think the have enough cinnamon. But with my change these were amazing! I made them for my mom and dad and they both liked them. My dad LOVED them, which is rare. Highly recommend. They were pretty thick, and I'd bake them for EXACTLY 8 min. I put one in for 10 and it burnt. They were a little doughy, which to me is good, but that's personal preference.

Excellent recipe! I followed it 99% exactly as written. The only thing I did differently was I did not add all of the dry ingredients at once. I added in 3 increments, just mixing in after each addition. I used a melon baller to scoop the dough with. The cookies came out light & puffy, not flat at all. More like little domes that are exactly as promised: crispy around the edges and chewy in the center. The flavor can't be beat!

Tried to use a substitute because I didn't have cream of tartar and it came out with a weird aftertaste. Other than that, the outside was the best part and the cookies came out really soft and stayed soft. Very easy recipe!

Wonderful cookies! I don't know what the heck went on with actually baking them though because at 400 degrees and 8 minutes they were burnt completely black on the bottom. I had exactly 4 dozen balls so I know my size was correct. I went ahead and bumped the oven down to 350 and they were perfect at 350 for the recommended 8 minutes. My oven doesn't tend to run hot so you might want to do a test couple of cookies to check your temp and time. I added an extra tablespoon of sugar just as personal preference to cinnamon/sugar ratio. Other than those two adjustments though they came out wonderfully following the recipe exactly. Nice and crispy on the edges and still chewy in the center. Great flavor.

Great tasting recipe. 400 is too hot for cookies so crank it down to 375 or 350 for 8 minutes. Mine came out super puffy because I separated the egg yolks and beat the egg whites.

Make sure you make the recommended 40-ish cookies with this recipe -- If you make them too large, they take so long to cook through that the bottoms burn.  The second batch I made was perfect!

I've never been a really big snickerdoodle fan, but these puffed up perfectly fine, following the recipoe exactly. I did make sure to take them out at exactly 8 minutes and let them sit on the counter for a few minutes. These were so simple and taste really nice! packaging them up to take for christmas eve and christmas day!

very yummy!  had to make extra cinnamon sugar mixture bc there were so many! :)  make sure you actually spread them 2 inches apart bc they spread pretty well.  and I put mine on for 10 minutes and they were perfect.  not too crunchy and not too chewy, just a perfect combo of both. very pleased with this recipe, its a new staple to my Christmas cookies.  Thank you for posting it!

This is my go-to recipe whenever I need a batch of cookies for a potluck or party.  I've made it perhaps 30+ times now.  The recipe has never failed nor have I ever met someone who disliked them.  In fact, if I don't bring them along for any sort of food gathering, I get disappointed comments.

It was good.  However, it didn't knock my socks off like I would expect a recipe with 3000 excellent reviews.  It had a good, pleasant flavor.  My batch did go flat.  I think I probably over mixed it after adding the dry ingredients.   I will try it again sometime in the future.

Bitter aftertaste :(  I made it several times to make sure. Each time I got a bitter aftertaste. Bummer - how can a 3,000 user rating of  4.5 stars be wrong. . . oh well. . .

The BEST snickerdoodle I have ever made.  Use the ziploc method as one reviewer adds to really get the 'look' of the snickerdooble, helps coat the cinnamon.  OMG!!  Rolled a bunch into balls and put them in a ziplock with sugar and cinnamon and froze them.  Whenever we want them fresh we take a few out and back them at 350 for 22 mins ( adjust accordingly as I am at 10k ft altitude)  thanks a ton for such a great recipe.  it's a keeper

My goodness!  These are simply the most delicious snickerdoodles I've ever made.  I don't always have shortening on hand, but I find that the recipe doesn't suffer for using all butter.  Not sure who Mrs. Sigg is, but she deserves a huge hug for these family-pleasing cookies.  Great job!

New go-to recipe for Snickerdoodles.  Made as directed.  Softened butter completely on countertop, eggs direct from fridge, most likely old baking soda.  Still amazing.  Doubled the batch and froze half in balls covered in cinsugar.  Let come to room temp and baked 8 mins.  Still perfect.  Fantastic Snickerdoodles.  Thank you.

For me, these cookies came out flatter than flat.

I had read through the other reviews and bought a brand new container of baking soda to make this recipe. After the first batch came out as one flat monstrosity covering my entire cookie sheet, I decided to chill the dough overnight and make another batch the next day. And the same thing happened with that batch.

It looks from the reviews like everyone has their own theory about what makes a flat cookie, but the only ideas that could apply to my experience have to do with the butter and the eggs. They were not at room temperature when I made the dough. The (large, not extra large) eggs came straight from the fridge. And the butter hadn't softened enough, so I threw it in the microwave for a few seconds.

I might try this recipe again and adjust those two things, then report back to see if that solves the flat issue!

p.s. I still gave this recipe 3 stars because the dough was awfully yummy. :-)

best snickerdoodle recipe ever. the only thing i did different is i only rolled the TOP of the cookie in the cinnamon sugar mix so that the cinnamon on the bottom of the cookie would not burn during the baking process!

I thought these were ok. I was looking for a great snickerdoodle cookie recipe since they're my favorite and was looking forward to this one. I  made it exactly as the recipe called for and they still turned out someone bland in flavor. The texture and look of the cookie came out great though.

Followed the instructions almost exactly (cooked for 8 minutes, then let sit on the pan for 2 more minutes to set), but mixed in a bag of crushed Heath chocolate bits before rolling the dough into balls. Heath bits are what make Snickerdoodles, in my opinion. They came out delicious this way!

These are the best snickerdoodles I have ever had! Perfectly cinnamony, buttery yet airy... they melt in your mouth and keep your hand reaching back for more. 
Our cream of tartar was a little old, so we read through the reviews and substituted it with 2 tsp. white vinegar. Thank you for this wonderful recipe! It's definitely a keeper!

Really good cookies, soft but a little chewy.  The recipe doesn't say what size to make the dough balls and next time I'll make mine a little smaller.  Baked for 8 minutes, and the yield was 36.

Perfect & delicious snickerdoodles! This recipe makes a ton, though, so be forewarned. I halved the recipe and still got 3 and a half dozen cookies. But we love snickerdoodles, so they won't go to waste. My baking time was about 7 minutes. Had to watch them closely. The Hubster likes the puffier cookies and I like the flatter ones, so I baked half of them as the recipe directed as round balls; the other half I flattened the dough balls with the bottom of a glass before baking. Worked out great and everyone is happy! Thanks for the super recipe! :)

These came out quite well.  They spread a little more than I'd hoped but still were soft and chewy and were flavorful.  They also smelled wonderful.  I'll make them again but open a new box of baking soda to see if that helps keep them a but thicker.

The only change I made was to use all butter, instead of the butter/shortening mix. Don't let previous cream of tartar comments scare you, I used the full amount, and the cookies came out fantastic.

I love love love LOVE (did I say love?) these cookies!  The recipe is wonderful as written...The only change I made was to increase the cinnamon/sugar rolling mixture because I ran out too soon.  I used 3 tbs. white sugar and 3 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon.  I also found that 9 minutes was a perfect baking time for me.  I often make these cookies around Christmas..they are DEEE-LISH!!!   :~)

Solid - easy recipe.  Made them for our annual xmas cookie party.  Followed exactly and they are a winner.  Helpful hint: put cinnamon and sugar in gallon sized ziplock, drop dough balls into mix, seal and SHAKE.  Fast, no mess way to coat them.

Sooooo good!  I make cookies for my roommates all the time and thought I would give these a try.  They LOVED them.  One said they were her new favorite.  I tested my baking soda and it was bad and was worried the cookies would come out flat, but they were still fluffy!  I used all butter (instead of half shortening).  I will definitely be making these again! mmmmm

These were very very good!  I crave them  now and luckily I have some extra in my freezer to take out when needed.  The only thing I wish was that these were a bit softer.  Unfortunately I think Snickerdoodles are more commonly good just after they come out of the oven and when they're still soft.  These hardened up pretty quickly.  I'm still on the hunt for a good soft snickerdoodle recipe :)

I just finished baking these and they are already disappearing.  These are the best Snickerdoodles I've ever had and my husband and friends agree.  I made one change.  I didn't have cream of tartar so I substituted 1-1/2 tsp. baking powder.  Didn't make a bit of difference!

My 14 year old daughter made these cookies all on her own tonight to give as Christmas presents to her friends.  They turned out better than we expected and were easy enough for her to make all on her own.  I wouldn't change a thing!  :D

VERY good cookies.  I failed to see the comment about the baking soda and so my cookies were very thin and flat.  But still tasted wonderful. Great recipe!

This cookie is so delicious! All of my family members love it! However, if you have a problem with flat cookies, I usually add more flour. But, other than that, it's amazing!

Oh Heavenly Father...these are bliss!  I didn't even bother with the shortning, I just used Country Crock's Churnstyle butter spread.  It's basically butter and shortning mixed together anyway and you don't even have to let it soften since it's the perfect consistancy right out of the refrigerator.  I was pleasantly surprised how easy they cooled and set when I took them out of the oven.  They were ready to eat while still warm and were perfect with a tall glass of milk....completely fed the soul.  KUDOS TO THE CHEF!!!

These are spectacular!   I followed the recipe as given except that I substituted 2 tsp vinegar for the cream of tartar.  I allowed all the ingredients to come to room temperature before mixing.  The plastic bag for shaking the cookies in sugar/cinnamon was a great idea.  I also baked them for exactly eight minutes as recommended.  They were puffy, a little crisp on the outside, and simply delicious.  I will definitely be adding these to my cookie repertoire!

Absolutley delicious!..  I followed the recipe to a T with the exception that my cinnamon/sugar was already mixed.  Instructions were right on; I baked my first batch 9 minutes then I made the following cookies a bit smaller so I went down to 8 minutes!  YUM!

Delicious!  Very good recipe!  I did chill the dough prior to shaping in to balls.  Much too sticky not to chill first.

I've made these a couple times now.  They are THE BEST.  Soft, but crispy.  Sweet with a slight bite.  The last time I made them I added chocolate chips and pistachios.  I called them snickerdoodle surprises.

Outstanding.  I think the mix of butter/shortening gives it a firmer texture so these do not spread out while baking.  I was careful to cream the mixture slowly to get a good fluffiness.  I used a 3/8 inch size scoop that made the balling so easy and quick.  The taste was PERFECT with blend of chewiness, flavor, and sweetness.  Look no further, this is the best snickerdoodle recipe!

i was so excited to make these and they just turned out ok. the texture was great, crispy edges and chewy centers like described, but the taste was just a little bland. it needed something extra, but i dont know what. maybe salt, but i added that!

**UPDATE**: I made these again because hubby asked for them, and put in 1 teaspoon of lemon juice in with the wet ingredients instead of using the cream of tartar. Very good. Also you can use ALL butter instead of half butter, half shortening. They turned out beautifully.

Yum!  I made these on a baking stone.  It was the first time I'd used it for cookies.  It worked well!  I just had to bake longer than the recipe called for.  (I'm sharing my experience with the stone, since I have nothing to add about the cookies that hasn't already been said!)

Where have these been all my life???? I have never heard of snickerdoodles before!!! I made these on Saturday - one batch and it made about 5 dozen cookies, it is now Monday morning and they are all gone!!! :) hubby and Jr absolutely hoovered them up! Thanks for the great recipe! Didn't change a thing and very easy to make...although I wonder why the cream of tartar is in them...I can't figure out it's purpose....

These are so delicious! I have been making snickerdoodles for years and this is, by far, hands down, the best recipe I have come across! For Christmas, I jazz these up with red and green sugar crystals-Betty Crocker brand. Just recently, for our son's adoption party, I used the larger baby blue sugar crystals you buy at speciality store and placed three in a cellophane bag with a ribbon and mini-rattle for favors.

Delicious! They stay soft, even days later. 8 minutes was the perfect bake time for cookies exactly 1 tbsp. I had to chill each ball in the freezer for a few minutes before rolling them in sugar as the dough is quite soft. No biggie, though. Everyone loves these. Be careful not to overbake, because they get crispy fast if left too long! Thanks for an awesome recipe. :D

These are fantastic!  Whenever I bring them somewhere, I am always asked for the recipe!  A little crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside.  They only need about 8 or 9 minutes in the oven, even though they don't look quite done, they are.  I do make 2 changes: I use 1 cup butter because I don't buy shortening.  And, the cream of tartar taste is a little too much for me, so I've reduced that amount to 1 tsp.  Wonderful, wonderful cookie!

Very good cookie! I've never had a snickerdoodle before so I don't have any others to compare to but this is a really tasty cookie! My first batch did not look done at 8 minutes so I baked for two more minutes. I wish I had taken it out at 8 as I did with the second batch. They don't look "done" at 8 minutes but take them out anyway and let the sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes. They set up nicely that way. The ones I let go for the full ten minutes ended up being too crispy. In any case, wonderful recipe!

Made this today.  I used two sticks of Blue Bonnet butter and did not have any cream of tartar.  They turned out GREAT!  Thanks for sharing.

Of all the snickerdoodle recipes I have, this one is the worst.  I could not roll the dough to then roll in the cinnamon sugar, the dough was too sticky - worse than chocolate chip cookie dough.  Betty Cocker has a MUCH better recipe than this one that works!

Followed the recipe as written - not sure what I did wrong, but these cookies were bland. They cooked up nice and were chewy, but not what I remembered when I was younger.

I was looking for a texture improvement to my "butter" recipe. I don't usally like crisco only recipes, so the compromise intrigued me.  I tried it exactly as published and the cookies were chewy with crispy edges- just as the author stated and exactly what I was looking for. It's a keeper.

Followed it perfectly except I added a tad bit more flour to make it not so sticky, and the cookies still turned out soft. Didn't have cream of tartar so I substituted vinegar, I don't know if it made any difference =p. I followed other suggestions and used 3tbsp of sugar and 3tsp of cinnamon. Baked for 8 minutes.

I have never made snickerdoodles before and I was excited to try them, so I decided to choose this recipe based on the high ratings. They came out puffy, a bit dry in the middle, and kind of plain tasting. I did follow another reviewer's suggestion to increase the cinnamon sugar to 3 T sugar to 3 tsp. cinnamon, which was a very good idea. I also substituted 1/2 cup of the sugar in the dough for Splenda (which probably accounted for the texture in the middle of the cookies). I baked for 8 minutes, and I immediately removed them from the baking sheets. I think I would like these a lot if they were chewy in the center, as some others have said they turned out for them. Maybe I will use all sugar and no splenda, and cut the flour by 1/4 to 1/2 a cup? I might play around with this one.... Thanks.

Like this recipe needs any more reviews. These are fantastic, and they don't last long at my house. Although, we just recently moved to Florida from Oklahoma, and no one down here seems to know what Snickerdoodles are! Everytime I bring them to work or parties, people claim they've never even heard of Snickerdoodles. But they always love them! 

Make sure to hand mix these- they're so much more fluffy when you do!

I make these cookies all of the time and they always turn out wonderful.  I've started using 3 tsp of baking powder instead of the baking soda and cream of tartar just for ease of shopping (I live in the Bahamas and cream of tartar isn't always availible) but the cookies still turn out great.  
Just as a personal note, I have been experimenting with whole wheat flour in baked goods (to make the sweet treats a little better but these don't turn out well with it.

Mine turned out to be domed shape. It had a very nice and tasty middle, not to mention that it was very soft too. I just used a plate and added about 1/3 c sugar and mixed it with a few tablespoons of cinnamon onto the plate. I individually rolled each ball of dough into the sugar cinnamon. I will make this again for sure!

These tasted great, but I made the mistake of following one reviewer and dropped the cookies on a baking sheet and sprinkled them with the cinnamon/sugar topping instead of rolling them into balls.  This produced a strange result -- the cookies stuck to the cookie sheet (had to pry them off) and they did not hold together at all.  I will follow the recipe more closely next time.

If I could give these ten stars I would!  These were gone as soon as they came out of the oven.  My husband who doesn't get too excited over sweets couldn't stop himself.  I baked them for just 8 minutes so they were very soft I also needed more of the cinnamon sugar mixture for them than called for but we like them heavily coated. You can't go wrong with these.

Great cookie. I followed the comments by other reviewers and came up with a great cookie. Key points that helped me: baked 8 minutes, removed from pan almost immediately. Keep dough in the fridge, it really does make a better formed cookie. Used parchment paper, and the cinnamon-sugar baggie technique. Freezing the remaining batter in cinnamon balls to bake on a rainy day. All great ideas, you guys are great!! Thanks, i'll be sharing the cookies with my husband's co-workers.

Fantastic! This is the perfect snickerdoodle recipe! The only change I made was using all butter. I was able to get 48, 2-inch cookies out of the total mix. The cookies were perfectly sweetened and airy like they're supposed to be. I did find that 8 minutes was too long, but 7½ minutes was perfect. Delicious and simple; you can't beat that!

My daughter is heading up to Vermont with her boyfriends family, so I thought these would be nice to take along. They turned out delicious, perfectly shaped with no spreading, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I doubled the recipe, however, I found that I needed to keep adding more flour to the mix in order to get the right consistency. The next time I make these I'll follow Jodi's advice and use butter flavored Crisco as I could taste the shortening in the cookie. Maybe this is why E.Taylor found there was an aftertaste. Still, a great little cookie and I thank you Beth!

WOW! These are my favorite cookies . The dough freezes really well, too. I usually use a cookie scoop and freeze it in balls, then take 'em out , roll 'em in Cinn./sugar and bake...then we can enjoy them as often as we like!
thanks for the great recipe.

In searching for a new cookie recipe I stumbled across this recipe for Snickerdoodles.  They have a fabulous flavor, are simple to make, keep well in the cookie jar and appeal to everyone.  Eating them brought back memories of my first Snickerdoodles back in the 60s.  Thanks for a great recipe and memories of a cookie I had not thought about or baked in many, many years.

This is a fabulous recipe, and the cookies always turn out perfectly chewy and flavorful.  Sometimes I divide the dough in half, add about 3 tbsps of Hershey's cocoa to one half, and roll in the cinnamon-sugar mixture as usual for "chocolate snickerdoodles."  The black and white snicks look sweet on a plate, very harmonious (although they don't stay long on the plate at my house).  Thanks Mrs. Sigg! :)

I've made these several times (8 minutes, 400 degrees), and each time, they came out too puffy and dry. This time, I baked them for exactly 8 minutes at 350 degrees,and I got the soft, chewy texture I was looking for. 
TIP: Keep half of the dough in the fridge while you work with the other half, since the dough does get sticky. Use a tablespoon to scoop the dough, and roll/shape it on a plate filled with sugar/cinn. mixture to prevent it from sticking to hands.

What a wonderful cookie! I love snickerdoodles and was on the hunt for a great recipe - well I've found it! I must say that I normally ignore recipes that include shortening because I normally feel that it gives cookies a wierd taste, but these definitely did not. I was low on butter, had only a bit over half a stick, so I threw in a couple large spoonfuls of butter-type spread. I feel that the cream of tartar really helped. All of the cookies that I have made with it always taste great. If you don't have cream of tartar, you can use white vinegar in its place (with the same measurements). I only came out with 21 cookies, but they were wonderful and looked just like the picture. These will definitely be made again! :D

This is probably one of the better snickerdoodle recipes out there. The only thing I changed in the recipe was to use all butter instead of half shortening. I prefer the flavour and 'mouth feel' of butter over shortening which can leave a 'filmy' taste in your mouth.

Awesome cookies. I've made these according to the exact recipe a few times, and they're incredible! I also use this recipe for sugar cookies; it's the only one I'll ever use. The only change I made is scaling down the cream of tartar to 1/4 tsp. I roll the dough out on a surface lightly sprinkled with powdered sugar, and make cut-outs. Then I sprinkle them with granulated sugar before baking. They're perfect! Thanks for this amazing recipe.

Absolutely perfect, without a doubt!  They taste just like the ones my mom used to make (before she lost her recipe), these brought back a lot of fond memories! Thank you for a perfect snickerdoodle recipe!

I use this recipe all the time, and everyone loves it!  I will sometimes use all shortening and no butter (I think it's good either way) and bake 7 or 8 min for soft cookies.  I'll bake them for 9 or 10 and leave the cookies on the sheet for a minute after if I want them more crispy.  I also improvise with the cinnamon-sugar mixture and shake the dough in snack or sandwich bags thoroughly coat it without getting my hands sticky.  I also find it faster to use a small ice cream scoop and make all of the balls at once before shaking them in the cinnamon-sugar.  I DEFINITELY recommend this recipe.  I'll never use another (unless I manage to get the Diddy Reese recipe).

Amazing Tasty Cookies!! 
I always read reviews before I make a recipe on this website. I'm glad I did this time especially because they really helped. I never have cream of tartar around the house so I used lemon juice (a suggestion from the reviewers) and they turned out great. I tried these with cream of tartar one time and liked it better with the lemon juice! When cooking these cookies bake them for exactly 8 minutes. No more, no less. They do not look done at 8 minutes, but once you take these out of the oven they really harden up. I find it almost impossible to mess up on these. I forgot to put the baking soda in one time and they still came out good!  

I make these cookies quite often, I usually make half a batch, its just enough to share with a few peopple. These are great for kids, great for bakesales, and are wonderful for a dinner party!

This recipe is awesome. I've been on this site constantly looking for recipes and trying lots of them this holiday season. I've noticed with most recipes there are a lot of changes that need to be made, according to reviews and experiments. This is probably the only recipe I've found here so far that I havent had to change or edit in ANY WAY to get it to come out right. These cookies come out perfect, and make me look good. Thank you Mrs. Siggs!!!

I just got done making these cookies!!! Very good!!!!  The only thing different I did was 1 cup of butter flavored shortening, instead of 1/2 of shortening and 1/2 of butter.  They came out great!  Thanks a bunch!

I stumbled across this recipe and I thought I'd give it a try. I thought these cookies were great. I baked them for a cookie swap and my husband brought all of them to work. He said these were the big hit. I cooked them on a baking stone and the first batch I cooked them a little bit longer (10-12 minutes). But after the first batch 8-9 minutes was sufficient. The cookies won't look completely cooked but they turn out nice and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. If these cookies are cooked to long they are still really good but they will be really hard and crunchy. So watch the time and it will be worth it. These are one of the best recipes I've ever tried. I will definitely be making these again.

Very good! My husband and daughter said to give these five stars. I made them for cookie baskets to give as gifts and they were almost gone in no time, so I'll have to make a second batch. Only change I made was increasing the cinnamon/ sugar mixture. Thanks for sharing!

I make big batches of this dough, roll it into a tube shape in a sheet of wax paper, and store in the fridge for a batch of hot fresh snickerdoodles whenever the family wants them.  The dough stays good for about a month or so.  After placing the balls of dough on the sheet, I dip a glass in the sugar/cinnamon mixture and squash the cookie just a bit for a flatter crisper cookie.  Substituting half of the flour for whole wheat flour makes a chewier cookie with a slightly nutty flavor, but is more healthy and still tastes great.

Recipe worked well overall, but left a funny chemical taste in my mouth afterward. Also too hard--I'm looking for a softer cookie. My quest for the perfect snickerdoodle continues.

I've made these cookies a few times now and always get compliments for them! I really love how quick and easy it is to make these cookies, and the crunchy cinnamon-sugar coating is a great balance with the soft, buttery cookie. Delicious!

Its amazing that how long you cook these cookies can change the taste completely. First I baked the cookies just until the point where they looked done but not quite golden brown, when they cooled they were gooey and you could really taste the cream of tartar (This is just how I like them!)  The second batch, I cooked longer and they turned out to be slightly crunchy with a much milder cinnamony flavor.  (my boyfriend loved them this way)  Great cookies :) mmmmmmm

Let me first say that I used to work at Paradise Bakery several years ago, and I have been looking for a snickerdoodle cookie recipe that was much like their's.  I was hoping that this would be the one, but I just had to give it a low-fat, low-sugar spin.  I went to the store to buy a small container of Crisco, and I spotted their new product, a no trans fat Crisco.  I purchased the new Crisco, and I also found a low fat butter to replace the regular butter.  Lastly, I thought it would be a good idea to use one cup of Splenda to replace the one cup sugar in the dough.  My first batch didn't spread, so I flattened the remaining batches before baking and shortened the baking time to seven minutes.  I liked the cookies very much, and I was pleased with the results.  Although not a Paradise Bakery cookie, it was very soft, sweet, and satisfying.  My mother, however, was not so happy.  She didn't think they were sweet enough, and I can see her point.  They tasted much like shortbread, but who can blame the recipe with all the changes I made.  Next time, I will use one cup Splenda and one cup regular sugar to increase sweetness.  Maybe that will make it more like a sugar cookie and less like a shortbread cookie.

WOW! Finally, a great Snicker-doodle recipe.  Here are my baking details to ensure your cookies are perfect: use all unsalted butter (no shortening) at room temp.  Make sure eggs are also large and at room temp. Cream butter and sugar together by hand, then add eggs and vanilla. Make sure this is mixed well. For dry ingredients, decrease tartar to 1 tsp as others have suggested, but don't forget to then lower the baking soda to 1/2 tsp (the ration is 2:1). I mixed the dry into the wet in stages, not all at once.  Invest in a French Silpat to line the baking sheet...makes all the difference.  DO NOT flatten prior to placing in oven as some have suggested...they must have had the wrong tartar/soda ratio or too much flour.

This cookies were incredibly DISSAPOINTING.  Do not use the cream of tartar.  I listened to the other review that mentions the strong aftertaste and only used 1 instead of 2 teaspoons of the cream of tartar, and it STILL tasted nasty.  What a waste of time!!!!

What happened?  All I could taste in the batter was the cream of tartar.  The cookies baked perfect but I could still taste the cream of tartar as an aftertaste.  Can cream of tartar go bad?  Why was my dough so nasty to taste?

Excellent! I have been using this recipe for years (I first came across it in my Womens Club cookbook with a different author). I use butter flavored shortening. My original recipe indicated that you could also chill the dough before forming the cookies if you desired. I use a bit more cinnamon/sugar to roll them in as we like them smothered! This has been a favorite in our house for many, many years. These are my oldest sons favorite cookie and I can entice him into performing many chores with the promise of a batch of these wonderfully delicious cookies!

Oh my gosh, these were so yummy! My mom used to make these for us as a kid, so these cookies brought back delicious memories of my childhood! Like another review suggested, I used 3TBS of Cinnamon and sugar. I mixed it in a baggie and tossed each of the cookies.  When you're rolling the cookie, dab your fingers in flour to keep it from sticking to your skin.  Beth, you are one amazing cook!!  You should write a cookbook!:-)

These were fantastic, strangely though it left a tannic after taste, could be due to the baking soda.  It's definitely better to be slightly underbake, the slightest overbake will make the cookie taste quite normal

These are awesome!  I even messed up - I halved the recipe, but forgot to halve the baking soda, and they still turned out great.  Instead of making 24 cookies though, I made 15 bigger ones using a little ice cream scoop, then baked them for about 15 minutes at about 380 degrees.  They were soft on the inside, and crunchy on the outside.  The hardest part is to cease and desist from eating them!  Thanks for a great recipe.

These are plain, but addictive! I put the cinnamon-sugar mixture in a freezer bag and toss several balls of dough at a time to coat because I'm too lazy to roll them individually. It's better to underbake than to overbake - you don't want to miss out on the soft chewy inside.

The best snickerdoodles I've ever made!  I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla to mine.  Plus, I made my cinnamon sugar topping 4T of sugar and 2t of cinnamon.  Gives them more of a sweet flavor and lightens up the mixture a bit.  Thanks for the terrific recipe!

I made a double batch of these delicious cookies, which I suggest you do if you want to have them around more than a day. Used parchment paper, which makes the cookies just slide off. I baked mine a little longer as I like my a little crisper at 385 degrees. Also, suggest you make small balls of dough as they cook quicker. I used extra sugar and cinnamon mixture and mixed it in a plastic bag, placed dough balls in it and carefully shook the mixture over them. This was a big timesaver.

I got a new oven and decided to try these again.  They are really good. 

OLD REVIEW:
Gee, I followed the recipe and my cookies came out horrible.  The problem that I encountered was that the cookies kept burning on the bottom.  I tried a different cookie sheet with the second batch and they burned again.  With the third batch I lowered the heat in the oven to 375 degrees.  They burned anyway.  Then I tried setting the oven to 350 degrees and halfway through the baking process  flipped them over, like one would do with pancakes.  This resulted in a cookie that was only slightly charred on both sides.  In my last attempt I baked them at 350 degrees for 5 minutes.  They were raw. I tried and had such a bad experience that I don't think I will ever make these cookies again.

Very good recipe--I have used it for years, after finding it on a bag of Gold Medal flour.  Simple yet delicious.  Be careful that there aren't any tiny lumps in the cream of tartar though.

What a wonderful recipe. I'm not sure who Mrs. Siggs is, but thank goodness she made this recipe! When I told my boyfriend I wanted to make these snickerdoodles he kept insisting he disliked snickerdoodles and wouldn't touch one. Mrs. Siggs proved him wrong! He can't stop eating them and was amazed that there was a snickerdoodle alive that he actually loves! Thanks for the great recipe!

I loved this recipe. However, because I live at high altitude the cookies puffed up in the oven and then flattened. I would make these cookies again with some adjustments (from High Altitude Bakes)- 1¼ cups + 2 tablespoons sugar, 1¼ teaspoons cream of tartar and  ¼ teaspoon baking soda.

These were great!  I used the exact ingredients and followed the reviewers suggestion of mixing by hand and not to over mix.  The result was a perfect cookie, not flat and spread out. Crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I don't have to look any further!

This was my first time ever making snickerdoodle cookies, and they turned out amazing thanks to this recipe, and some of the reviews. I did everything as mentioned above in the original recipe with a few changes. First, I didn't have any cream of tar tar, so instead I used 2 tsp of white distilled vinegar. The first batch of cookies I baked only the minimum of 8 minutes, but I thought they tasted a little gummy, so 9 minutes was perfect for my liking. I thought they turned out very well, and my son and husband enjoyed them too! Thanks for the great recipe :)

These have wonderful flavor and come out gorgeous, just don't over bake as they are prone to be crunchy versus chewy!

These are good. I followed the advice of another reviewer and spooned out a little bit of the egg whites to keep the cookies from flattening out. I also turned down the temp to 390 (although I don't know that this was necessary), and I took the cookies out at 8 minutes. They seemed not quite done, but when cooled, they were chewy and perfect. The kids and husband liked these a lot.

I used extra butter instead of the shortening and I think it made the cookies even better!! These stay soft for days! Really tasty! Thanks for sharing :)

Great recipe! Chewy on the inside and crispy on the outer edges.  I read the reviews and found these to be most helpful:
1) Instead of shortening, substitute 1/2 Cup Butter
2) Allow butter to soften to room temperature
3) Use 3TBL Sugar and 1 TBL Cinnamon and mix in a baggie - shake dough in it
4) Wet your fingertips to form the balls - this was awesome!

Def ok but I agree lacking that push over the top. The cinnamon to sugar ratio is off I think, as cinnamon leaves a dusty feel to the palate in this amt.. Needed 2 tsp sugar to one tsp cinnamon. Also butter flavor crisco best option. Not a really sweet cookie anyway, but could do half light brown and half regular sugar.I think this helps

Best recipe for snickerdoodles! I tested my baking soda and it didn't fizzle so I added 2 tsp. of baking powder in place of cream of tartar as another reviewer had recommended. They turned out thick, didn't spread much, with a crispy outside and chewy center. Next time I'll follow the recipe exactly and be sure to use fresh baking soda.

This is a great snickerdoodle recipe! I had it bookmarked from last year, so it's definitely one I've used once or twice. Made them again this morning. The only difference is that I add more flour. Maybe it's the weather here, but I  had to use almost 3.5 cups. Also, I do add some cinnamon to the dough, to give a little more spice. Nine minutes is a perfect bake time. Thanks!

Wow did I really just eat 4 of these hot from the oven? Yikes-yes, yes I did. But they were amazing. I may cut back a little on the cinnamon as it overpowered the sugar a little but otherwise, awesome!

My husband is making himself sick eating, what he says is, the best cookie he's ever had!!! :)  Fast and so easy to make.  I even made my youngest daughter VERY happy by making a few covered only in sugar. She doesn't like cinnamon (that I'll never understand). 
I substituted two teas of baking powder for the cream of tarter and omitted the shortening and used all butter. It may be great the other way, but I used what I had! So glad I did!!

Very disappointing. I made these with my son and we followed the directions exactly. The cookies did not spread at all and were not very flavorful. My boys don't like them and I will probably try a different recipe tomorrow.

My husband loves Snickerdoodles, Seems that kids really like them, too, as they are simple and just plain good.  I used all butter, though, and 3 cups flour.  I always like to use butter in recipes if possible..

I doubled this recipe and it made 5 dozen cookies. For the sugar-y coating, I used Trader Joe's Cinnamon-Sugar mix, and then added in a little bit more sugar. I used my small scoop to make the balls, and then  baked them for 8 minutes and 20 seconds. PERFECT! Crunchy when you want them to be, soft when you  want them to be, and ALWAYS delicious!

I've been making this recipe for years - It's my daughter's favorite! I make them where I bake and they are a favorite there as well. I usually don't like using shortening, but it's a must for this recipe. Underbaking is key.

Delicious!  We have loved all of Mrs. Siggs' recipes, so far.  No exception to this cookie.  It baked up nice and airy, yet chewy on the outside.  I used my cookie scoop to form and drop in the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Worked perfectly.  Definitely will be using this recipe again, so, so good!

Delicious! My whole family enjoyed these snickerdoodles. One tip: since this dough is very sticky and hard to shape because of the stickiness, I put it into the fridge for approximately one hour before I shaped them. Then, the balls were less sticky and easier to form. And, conveniently, this did not negatively affect the taste or texture of the cookies in any way!
A++++ for this recipe!

Excellent! I used 1/2 unsalted butter and 1/2 BUTTER flavored shortening.  I also only used 3/4 tsp of cream of tarter and 3/4 tsp of baking soda. ( was running low on the COT). I think I made my cookies way bigger than the recipe stated. I used a rounded TBSP scoop so they had to bake 13-14 min to cook them through. (With this recipe,  I got 24 cookies, so yeah, double the size cookie) Baked them on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. They were the perfect combination of crispy and chewy.

These were amazing cookies! The soft was nice and chewy. Usually if i leave snickerdoodles out overnight they'll get hard as a rock but not these. My advice is that you should cook them for about 9 minutes instead of eight, they can come out a little bit too soft.

I have made Snickerdoodles with the same result, HARD and FLAT.  Not this time though.  They turned out great.  Followed the recipe as it said and baked for 8 minutes.

So, I made this recipe exactly as written, except I halved everything.  I thought 48 cookies was waaaay too many for just my husband and I. The dough was really crumbly and kind of dry, and in order to make half the amount (24 cookies) I had to make the balls really tiny! and then, they didn't flatten out, so we had "snickerdoodle balls".  They tasted really good, but were dry.  My husband still liked them and ate most of them, but I was a little dissapointed, .  Perhaps halving the recipe threw it off? Not sure, but I'll probably try this again, making the full recipe and bigger cookies.

This is the classic snickerdoodle recipe we've been making since I was a kid. If your cookies are too thin it's probably because the dough needs to be chilled before baking. That should keep them from flattening out.

I baked these with my friends and they were delicious and made a huge amount of cookies! I recommend to add more cinnamon though!  Do not over bake and make sure that no sugar is on the baking sheet or it will make a hard crust which isn't very tasty.

Oh my...how wonderful these are. I could have eaten them all by myself and very nearly did. LOL So moist and chewy. Be sure and sift your dry ingredients and hand mix everything...you'll be glad you did. I'll be making these a lot.

Everybody loved them! I thought the batter turned out a little dry so next time I'm going to add some grated apple, probably a sour kind to balance the sweetness.

Amazing! This is a great recipe, the only thing you might want to be cautious about is the cookies turned out better when i baked them for maybe 7 mins, they burned a little when i did 8+ mins. But tastes great!

I have received several requests for the cookies over the years. People request this recipe too! I have noticed over the years that the brand of cream of tartar matters. some of the cheaper brands leave a bit of a taste.

I have made these cookies about 30 times and they ALWAYS get devoured. They are perfectly soft in the center and crispy on the edges. I am always asked for the recipe or asked to make them. The only down side is they are messy so I place the dough in the fridge for 4 hours before rolling them and that helps. LOVE LOVE LOVE these

These are really good!  I used raw organic sugar, which is not exactly white, and the lemon juice instead of cream of tartar, and all unsalted butter instead of shortening. I also used the baggie with 3 T sugar and 3 T cinnamon. I left the last batch in for 9 min, for a more crunchy outer edge.  I got 47 cookies out of this, using about 1 T batter per cookie.

These cookies are amazing. I prefer to make these with all butter instead of butter and shortening. As long as I adequately chill the dough, they don't turn out flat. Really delicious. Make them, you won't be sorry.

These flattened as they cooked and turned out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I liked them this way. They tasted great except for the strange lemony aftertaste. I'm not sure, but I think this is caused by the cream of tarter. Other reviewers suggested substituting lemon juice or vinegar for the cream of tarter (substitute 2 tsp of lemon juice or vinegar for 1 tsp cream of tartar), and others recommended omitting it altogether (use 4 tsp baking powder and no baking soda or cream of tartar). If I make these again, then I will use extra cinnamon-sugar for rolling too.

excellent cookies! I live in a higher elevation and I was worried that my cookies would fall flat, so I added an extra teaspoon of baking soda. They came out perfect! and if you like a chewier cookie, bake for 7 minutes.

Excellent. I would take them out at 7 min because they burn easily.

I'm attributing my cookies' lack of "poof" to the fact that my baking soda probably was a bit older than it should have been.  The flavor was great, though.

Everyone knows I am an obsessed young baker at the age of 14. My friend requested some snickerdoodle cookies and I wasnt really sure what they were so I made this recipe. Turns out these are MELT IN YOUR MOUTH cookies! I LOVED them! I couldnt change anything if I have too!

This recipe is easy and delicious. This first snickerdoodle recipe I've tried over the years which truly results in a soft, chewy cookie. To help incorporate the butter and egg mixture better, I beat the eggs first, and then mixed in superfine sugar. I melted the butter, let it cool a bit, and then combined it and the egg mixture using an electric mixer. Taste is fresh and buttery underneath the cinnamon. Excellent!

Perfect snickerdoodles! I am giving the recipe a 4, however, because I believe the reason some others cookies aren't coming out is because of the way the recipe is written. This is exactly how I prepared them:

As I do with most cookie recipes, I made the dough ahead of time. Covered with plastic and put in the fridge until I was ready to roll/bake.

1. Combine flour, cream of tartar, baking soda (fresh, not older than a month or two!) and salt in a small bowl and set aside.

2. In a large bowl, cream together butter, shortening and sugar by hand for 3 - 4 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time until incorporated. Add vanilla. Slowly incorporate the dry ingredients just until mixed.

Used a small ice cream scoop for perfectly portioned cookies. I baked as the recipe stated, 8 minutes (exactly!) on parchment paper lined baking sheet at 400

I found out after several tries that if you follow this recipe exactly (but you can be generous with the vanilla and cinnamon - just be careful to use the equivalent of large, rather than jumbo, eggs) and if you don't overcook them, these are everything you want and hope them to be.  I didn't have to chill the dough, either. They are beautiful and irresistible, which, however, caused a major problem for my diet.

Love these cookies, perfect snickerdoodle flavor, crispy outside and chewy inside. Easy and always delicious, I don't have to change a thing! EDIT Mar 2014: well, I had my first failure with these cookies, and I think it was because I used my brand new mixer to do the creaming. I must have over-creamed; the dough was horribly sticky, even after 15 mins refrigeration, and in the oven the cookies flattened out like crackers! So from now on, hand-mixing for me!

5 stars with minor adjustments. 1st off I can taste any amount if cream of Tartar and don't like it at all. So of course I will always omit it and have a flatter cookie. 2nd I have a serious sweet tooth and substituted 1/3 of the white sugar to brown sugar and LOVED this adjustment. Baked for 8 minutes... tripled the cinn sugar (in ziploc bag) and had the best Snickerdoodle. Better than I could have ever expected.

GREAT snickerdoodle cookie!  I followed the ingredients and allowed the dough to chill for a few hours before scooping and rolling in the cinnamon sugar.  I also baked at 375 degrees for 11 1/2 minutes instead of 400 for 8 minutes.  If you are a frequent cookie baker I recommend purchasing a commercial quality portion scoop **#30 1 1/4 ounce scoop 
and I use it for all my cookies! Perfect size every time and they will bake evenly.

These are perfect snickerdoodles!  I never have shortening, so I use 1 c butter and add an extra 1/4 c of flour as a substitute.  This recipe provides cookies that are fluffy and moist on the inside, with the perfect amount of crunch on the outside.  When I make them during the holiday season, I mix red and green colored sugar into the cinnamon/sugar mixture to coat- they come out very cute and festive! 

My oven runs hot, so I decrease the temperature to 375 and cook for 8 minutes.

These turned out GREAT! I followed some of the other's tips and creamed the butter and sugar by hand and also made all the balls and then rolled them in the sugar/cinnamon. If anything the dough almost wasn't sticky enough for the sugar to stick too, but they turned out awesome.  I added some red and green coloured sugar to the second half for a christmas touch. I've never had snickerdoodles before in my life but I am a fan now!

Wow, were these awesome!  Best I've ever had!!  I mixed the flour, cream of tartar, soda, and salt separately, then added to the wet mixture.  I had to put the dough in the freezer for about 15 minutes before handling, then after each dozen on the cookie sheet, I put the dough back in the freezer.  Made them easy to handle!  I used parchment paper on the cookie sheet, and baked at 375 (dark pan).  I had to use 4 Tbl. sugar + 4 tsp. cinnamon to have enough to coat all the cookies.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really nothing to add-made exactly as recipe stated except only rolled the tops in cinnamon/sugar so the bottoms did not burn. Cooked at 400 degrees for exactly 8 minutes and did let them sit on cookie sheet a minute before I moved them to cool. My husband was disappointed when I told him I was making Snickerdoodles as he said he doesn't like.  He tried one and thought they were delicious. So thanks Mrs. Sigg!

The Snicker doodles were delightful in many ways. For one they keep a chewy and warm inside for a lasting great impression. They were quite easy to make me grin and will be an exquisite treat for other times to come. Thank you Beth for a truly amazing snicker doodle.

These were okay.  I like mine puffy and able to roll out right away.  These were really sticky, had to add extra flour and then put in the fridge to get it hard enough to roll out.  I don't think I'll use this one again, still tastes good though.

Basically, increase the baking soda to 1.5 teaspoon and add it to 1 tsp of water then into the liquid ingredients. Also, refrigerate the dough prior to cooking. Very good.

Super easy to make, and so yummy! I make my cookies a little big, so 12 minutes was perfect!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars, because it is just that - a 5-star recipe.  Although I am not a huge fan of Snickerdoodles, these bake up exactly as the recipe says and they come out perfect!  The dough is a bit sticky, but it was very workable to roll into balls and then roll into the cinnamon-sugar mixture.  I also thought the cinnamon-sugar measurement was perfect for the amount of cookies I made, but a little extra doesn't hurt, I was down to the last little bit at the end!  If you love Snickerdoodles, then you will love this recipe!

Hands down the best Snickerdoodle cookies I've ever had. Don't change a thing (just cook it less depending on the oven...7 minutes in mine).

These cookies are FANTASTIC! I bake cookies ALOT and these are my new favorite.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly - chewy in the middle and just a tiny crispness around the edges.  I also found a great way to keep my hands clean.  I put the cinnamon sugar into a small bowl. Then I used my medium sized Pampered Chef cookie scoop to scoop up the ball of dough and then dropped it into the bowl.  I used a large spoon to scoop up some cinnamon sugar and pour over the cookie dough ball.  Once the cookie was coated, I slid a fork under the cookie ball, tapped off the excess cinnamon sugar mixture and slid it off onto the parchment paper.  Perfect!  No sticky mess :)  I will definitely be making these again and again!

I made these around the holidays and my husband's coworkers are still asking for more!  The first time I made them they were perfect, the second and third times they fell a little flat, but last time they were, once again, perfect.  I'm not sure what I did differently, but even when they fall they're delicious!

I had old cream of tartar and new baking soda and these came out wonderfully.  I didn't have a problem with sticky dough and I did increase the white sugar to tbsp's rather than tsp's as per some of the reviews.  I mixed the dry ingredients before adding them to the wet.  I reduced the temp to 380 because my oven gets a little hot.  Baked for 9 mins until they looked cracked but wet and took them off the sheet within a minute of them coming out of the oven. Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Excellent.

I was disappointed with these, especially with all the high ratings. I thought the sugar cookie base tasted rather bland and even rolled in the cinnamon sugar once you got past that all you tasted was flour.

This recipe is amazing!
I followed the recipe exactly and used the tip on dropping the balls in the ziplog bag with the sugar and cinnamon mix. I used regular Crisco for the shortening. The mix didn't stick. It worked out great!

Having never made snickerdoodles before, I thought these turned out very well. They were absolutely delicious, although I placed too many on the cookie sheet and ended up with square cookies. lol

This recipe is what you would call perfection!  A paralegal at work gave me Snickerdoodles as a Xmas present & they blew me away having never had them before.  I searched allrecipes for the highest rated recipe.  Initially I used a few suggestions & made changes before even trying this recipe as is.  None hit the mark that I was looking for. I then decided to follow the recipe exactly as-is, no modifications & PERFECTION!  Crisp on the outside & deliciously soft on the inside!  Everyone that has tried them is blown away.  They last a day max.  Everyone wants more!  See my photos they really are perfect.  The most helpful suggestion I read, use Parchment paper to baked on.  That way it’s easier to pull them off the baking sheet immediately to cool. I also use two baking sheets, prepping one sheet with the scooped balls while the other is baking, alternating until entire dough mixture is gone.  Fast, orderly & ridiculously delicious!

Made as directed but doubled the cinnamon sugar as someone suggested and found that there was too much leftover.  These were crunchy on the outside, because the cinnamon sugar melted (yum) and the insides were soft! Delish!!!

Really good!  I used my 1.5 tbsp scoop for  these, needed to cook about 10 mins based on larger size (got 3 dozen rather than 4).  I added half a bag of cinnamon chips.  Great!  Hubby says its a keeper!

These are awesome!  I did not have cream of tarter so I used 2 tsp baking powder instead of the cream of tarter and baking soda.  I used a medium cookie scoop and cooked them at 375 for 9 minutes and they came out PERFECT!!

Finally a Snickerdoodle cookie that came out right, thanks for everyone's input. I'vee been trying for years to make this cookie and it never came out right and the #1 problem was that I over baked it! This is a keeper and I will make them again!!!

So good!   Thanks for the helpful reviews.  I used a hand mixer for creaming, but stirred the flour in by hand.  I turned them cookie sheet halfway through baking and took them out right at 8 minutes.  The bottoms were perfectly browned and the crisp-to-soft ratio is perfect!  I love this website.  :) Oh!  I followed the suggestions for testing my baking soda and am glad I did.  The box that was in the cabinet was 'dead'.

I've made these for my cinnamon loving husband. They turned out perfect. I took the first batch out at 8 minutes and they were still gooey. Mine took exactly 11 minutes to be done, every oven is different. You can almost tell by the great cinnamon smell that they are done. I also used butter flavored shortening instead of regular shortening. Nice light cookie, and buttery richness coated in cinnamon...how can you go wrong? Thanks Mrs. Siggs. I'll be making these all year long.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I tested this recipe out when I sent some care packages to some of my troops in the desert. I ended up with requests for this cookie EVERY time I sent out another package. I only baked them for 7 minutes because they were being shipped overseas and it took about a week. They were PERFECTLY soft after layering them in between paper towel, and stored in an airtight container which I also sealed closed with packing tape. From me and my troops...We salute you Mrs. Siggs!

These were great cookies once I got the timing right in my oven.  I have a gas oven and had to bake for 10-11 minutes to get the perfection of a soft inside with a crunch on the outside.  I tried to follow other's advice of 8 minutes flat, but my cookies were still wet in the middle.  So I say, know your oven and bake to your liking.

SO GOOD! I follow the recipe exactly EXCEPT for one thing...I do not use the cream of tartar, I use about one tsp or a little more of fresh lemon juice. If I do not have fresh lemons then I skip that step altogether. I find the cream of tartar gives it a very slight bitterness that I do not like. The cookies are AMAZING though. My husband, who is not a cookie fan, loves these! They are super cheap to make which is a huge plus too!

My husband used to say he hated snickerdoodles, and would groan every time I mentioned I wanted to make them.  I used this recipe the last couple times, and now he asks for them ALL the time, and says they are almost his all time favorite cookie now. :)

Not sure why people had trouble with these cookies turning out flat.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were VERY puffy.  The taste and texture are excellent...as good or better than any specialty cookie store.  Baked for 10 minutes, they came out crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. These will make it into my regular cookie rotation!

These were fairly easy to make and were a huge hit with my family and boyfriend. They really enjoyed them. I followed the other's advice to keep it in there only 8 minutes exactly and take the cookies off the pan immediatly. They were perfect :)

These are great.  The only thing I did different, was to use 2 tsp lemon juice, instead of the cream of tartar (wasn't sure mine was good still).  I took the advice of others and baked 8-9 minutes and then took out and put on the cooling racks right away.  Mixed them by hand and used parchment paper.

These are great.  Made them last night to ship to my Marine son.  They are supposed to be one of the best cookies for shipping. Definitely mix dry ingredients into wet by hand, without over mixing.  Perfect, chewy cookie!

This recipe was okay. It made really tiny snickerdoodles if you were following the suggested amount. Also, I think 400 degrees was way too high to cook these. The bottoms of my cookies started to burn after 7 minutes. I reduced the heat to 350 for the second batch and extended the cook time a little. I probably wouldnt make this recipe again. I've made snickerdoodles quite a few times and this recipe didn't wow me

With so many reviewers before me, there's really nothing I can add: these cookies are awesome! My boyfriend is a snickerdoodle-lover; therefore, he's extremely picky about them. Many are too eggy or just "ok" but he thought these were perfect! I found it interesting how much puffier these cookies were by using a slightly larger scoop. If you use OXO brand cookie scoop, it's the small one. But I went up a little in size (not quite medium...not sure exact size, not OXO...) and it made a puffier, beautiful cookie. The small scoop was still perfectly round and cute, just flatter. This one is a keeper!  **Two days later, my bf says these are the best ever and I have to remember this one (I like trying new recipes so I forget what I've made). Here's my note to myself to never forget this recipe!! :D

By far the best snickerdoodle recipe I've come across. I suggest using half brown sugar half granulated sugar and refrigerating your prepared dough balls prior to baking. Cook 7 1/2 minutes and get them off the cookie sheet immediatly. These tips will create an even more melt-in-your- mouth effect! They will seem slightly underdone but once they cool, you will have the absolute best cookie.

Great recipe, yummy tasting, and on their way to Afghanistan in a care package. Recommend recipe highly. Did add sour cream and cinnamon as modifications to the dough for moisture and taste respectively.

These cookies are great! Nice thick cookie with wonderful flavor. This recipe is a keeper! 

Note: I had to double the cinnamon/sugar mixture to get all of my cookie dough balls covered.

Fantastic...  I would really watch these in the oven... 7 - 8 minutes is better... if you are rolling them into 3/4" diameter balls.  DON'T flatten them... they bake flat. These are so addictive I can eat a whole batch!

These taste great! I followed the recipe exactly, except made more cinnamon sugar mix as other users suggested. My cookies were a bit flat, but I'm inclined to think that it's because of my semi-old baking soda. Next time, I think i'll made these cookies a bit bigger so the cracks can really show. They kept well for a few days, but not as long as some other cookies. By day 4 or 5, they were too hard and weren't really salvaged well by the ol' microwave trick. But overall a great recipe!

I cooked these cookies as a surprise for my husband. He wished they were fluffier so next time I am going to use less egg whites. They were pretty good fresh out of the oven but two days later they were even BETTER!!!

I thought this was a wonderful recipe.  I added about 1/4 cup more flour and refrigerated the dough before rolling as it was a little loose.  It was a hot/humid day so that could be why it was loose.  I will definitely make these again!

I loved these! I meant to double the recipe for the sugar/cinnamon mixture. But I accidentally put 4 tbs sugar and 4 TBS cinnamon. But, they still taste great! :) Snickerdoodles are just awesome that way. And, the batter definately was not too sticky. It's supposed to be sticky people! That's how the cinnamon sugar sticks! :D

These are absolutely fabulous!! Just follow the recipe - they are great as they are! Only problem is that they are "addictive". One batch dissapears in a couple days. I made a double batch and left half the batter in the fridge for a couple days before making the rest to "stretch" them.  A couple comments:

1. Using the half butter/shortening is critical. Don't substitute all butter or all shortening and definately not margerine!

Shortening has a higher melting point, less flavor and less moisture than butter - they will be dry and tasteless.

Margerine has a lower melting point, less flavor and more moisture than butter - they'll be too thin and hard and could burn.

2. I tried substituting 4-tsp Baking Powder for BOTH the Cream of Tartar AND the Baking Soda and they were a bit too crispy. The CofT & Soda was best.

3. Bake them for *exactly* 8 minutes and then right to the cooling racks. By the time the next sheet is ready to come out of the oven, the first batch is cooled enough to eat! (Big part of the "addiction" problem mentioned above!)

4. Finally, I made a few sheets where I made them like "Thimble Cookies", adding about 1/4-tsp Raspberry, Blueberry or Pineapple Jam into a "baby finger size" indentation into each cookie before baking. A nice variation on an already PERFECT cookie.

A simple and tasty snickerdoodle. I baked mine for 9 min. and then let them cool on the pan for 3 min.  They turned out perfect!  Not to crispy or too puffy.  A snickerdoodle is usually more flat because it does not have baking powder.  When they are puffy you don't get the crinkles in it to show the cinnamon and sugar.  To cut the taste of cream of tartar - use a really fresh jar and mix it well with the flour, salt, and soda mixture.

Easy, pretty and CINNNNNNNAMONY!! I love it...just like I remember growing up. I want to thank all the previous postings for their inputs as it helped me in baking these successful treats! I used all butter; creamed everything. I used 3T sugar plus 3 tsp cinnamon (in a sandwich plastic ziplock bag) to coat the rolled balls before placing them onto cookie sheet. It was less messy and easy clean up. I baked the cookies at 400 degrees for precisely 8 minutes, took them out and immeditely placed them on a cooking rack using a spatula. No problems transferring them at all.  I had 33 snickerdoodles, not 40 and it all went quickly! They were nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and full of cinnnnamony sugary gooodness. It was not overly sweet so that sugar/cinnamon coating was perfect! I also did not have a scooper so I used a TABLESPOON measuring spoon to scoop out the dough and roll into balls and into the sugar/cinnamon coating. My place smells so divine! Thank you!!

awesome! thick and soft. I added a bag of white chocolate chips, and I really liked that but this is a great recipe without. *Cook on the very top rack to prevent the sugar burning the bottom of the cookie.

Snickerdoodles are one of my favorite cookies, so I had to try this recipe.  It was easy to make - in fact, my 2.5 year old helped me.  It was her very first baking experience!  This recipe makes a large amount of cookies.  I ended up with 5 dozen.

Excellent recipe. I hate making cookies now that my kids are all grown up. So I patted the cookie dough in an eight-inch pan and then sprinkled on the cinnamon/sugar mixture. I baked it at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. Nice and crispy on the outside and moist and cake-like on the inside. Tasty!!!

If I hadn't eaten a few cookies as I was baking them, I wouldn't have gotten any!  All gone that same night!  I did not have cream of tartar, so I omitted the baking soda and substituted 2 teaspoons baking powder for the soda and tartar.  Baked for 8 minutes exactly.  The best snicker doodle we have ever had!!!

These cookies are amazing, but I will agree with a few of the comments:
You will need more than the recommended amount of sugar and cinnamon - probably 3 T and 3 t, respectively. 
I used baking powder instead of cream of tartar, and it was fine.
Line the baking sheets with parchment paper so you can remove the cookies immediately. 
Put the cinnamon sugar topping in a sandwich bag and drop the balls in one at a time - makes that step sooo much easier.

Finally figured out how to have successful cookies at high altitude! I lowered the butter and shortening by 1 tbsp. each and added an extra 1/2 cup of flour. Did not over blend. Chilled dough for 1 hour, can go longer if that's more convenient. I hope this helps for us that struggle with high altitude baking issues. The cookies are delicious!

I made several alterations and it still turned out wonderfully! I used mostly margarine (3/4 c) and only a little shortening (1/4 c) to keep the volume and texture, used 1c sugar and 1/2c Splenda, and 2 cups white flour, 3/4 cup whole wheat flour. They are absolutely delicious! I made mine a little smaller and baked at 385 for 7 minutes. I ended up with about 55, at only 65 calories a piece!

I've made these several times with consistently wonderful results! Follow the recipe exactly as written! I use real butter...no substitutes here, and Butter Flavored Crisco for the "shortening."  Helpful hint: I use my round Tablespoon measure...I even off the amount of dough so you get exactly 1 Tablespoon of dough per cookie. I bake these on my "air cushioned" cookie sheet for between 11 and 12 minutes, 16 cookies per pan. Took a little trial and error, but the results are approximately 50 cookies.

Absolutely wonderful!  Followed advice and made a little more cinnamon/sugar mixture, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly & baked 8-9 minutes (pulled them out when they started to crack).  My son was eating them right off the cooling rack!  Thanks for a heavenly recipe!

Delicious cookie. I used all butter, which made the cookies a little flatter but no less delicious. The incredible taste of butter in every bite more than made up for it. Such a simple cookie, but so good it's impossible to stop at just one.

I thought these were great.  The only adjustment I needed to make was more sugar and cinnamin for the coating.  I even used whole wheat flour and you couldn't even tell.  I had no trouble with flat cookies like others have said (and I'm not so sure about the freshness of my baking soda or cream of tartar!).  I chilled the dough a bit and used a cookie stone to bake on.  8 minutes at 400 was perfect!

These snicker doodles are aaaammazing!!  I will always use this recipe for my snicker doodle cravings!!  Stick to the 8 min baking..you don't want to over bake them or they'll turn out to hard.  I usually let them cool on the pan for a min or two before transferring to a cooling rack.

Turned out a nice fluffy texture, but needed a little more flavor. Maybe add more sugar. Reduced yield to 1 dozen. Used 1/2 tsp of white vinegar instead of cream of tar tar. Mixed wet then added dry and baked for exactly 8 minutes.

Delicious! I used 1 cup of butter, no shortening, and they turned out fine, nice and soft on the inside, crisp outside. I baked them for 7 minutes at 400 degrees.

Very good! Subbed margarine for the butter & shortening because that's all I had.  I did need to adjust the topping/rolling amounts, per other reviewers' suggestions.  I also had to cut the cooking time short to get the soft cookie these claimed to be, and at a slightly lower temp - again like others suggested.  But taste was good.  Just the right amount of sweet.

These are really good! Like the other reviewers I doubled the sugar and cinnamon to dip the cookies in. For me it was easier and less messy to mix the sugar/cinnamon mixture in a ziplock bag and coat the cookie inside the bag.

I don't like when people change the recipes in the review section, it always makes me think I need to change this or that. I followed these directions and had amazing cookies. Do not change a thing. I did run out of coating so I had to double that batch, but I did not change one ingredient and they turned out perfectly!!

Made this last night- once I got the baking times right (I use a pampered chef stone bake sheet) these came out wonderful! I had to bake for around 9 min on 400. Had 3 people already ask for recipe.

Awesome cookies made them exactly per the recipe. Baked for 9 minutes and cooled on tray for about 45 seconds. The first pan was gone before the second came out of the oven.

My cookies didn't come out having that perfect cracked look, but that's okay. They tasted awesome! I used all butter and since I didn't have cream of tartar I took another poster's suggestion and used 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice. And for the cinnamon sugar mixture to roll the cookie dough in, I would double the proportions.

I believe this is the same recipe I used to use that was in my old Betty Crocker cookbook.  The taste was very good, but I did have to make a change to the temp. of the recipe.  I baked the first batch at 400 for 8 minutes, and took them out when it smelled like they were starting to burn.  They were slightly overcooked on the bottoms and had spread out too much.  In subsequent batches, I turned it down to 375 for 8 min., and they were perfect - no burning, sticking or spreading.  My oven is only 3 years old and is usually right on for most recipes, so maybe someone else might find this helpful.

Delicious!  I read a recommendation on another review that suggested to mix the ingredients by hand.  So I put away my KitchenAid and worked up a sweat creaming and stirring and blending.  I used a 1/2 tablespoon cookie scoop and coated the little balls in the cinnamon sugar mixture using a Ziploc bag (4 at a time, using a 1qt bag).  I baked each batch *exactly* 9 minutes, and they came out beautifully!  I love that gorgeous cracked top and the wonderful soft texture.  I stored the majority of the cookies in my cookie jar with a slice of bread to keep them soft, and on the second day, they were still melt-in-your-mouth!

I have no idea what I did wrong but whenI completed making the dough it was so gooey I couldn't make it into balls. So I then set it in the fridge to give it a little time to set and 2 hours later I took it out and after 5 mintues it was back in its gooey state. When I got them rolled out and in the oven, I cooked them 8 mintues as instructed and they were very crispy when they got out. So then I made the balls lots fatter and got some good cookies out of  that. Next time I'm gonna let them set and make big balls.
*December 22*
As of today these are the best. I still have no idea what I did wrong then^ but they worked out today! They are still a little harder than I would've liked... but they were a lot better!

Loved this cookie. I am a huge fan of Snickerdoodles and was excited to make this cookie. I made the cookie per the recipe and my cookies didn't turn out flat but I felt they did need more sugar and cinnamon topping. I would recommend as others have doubling the cinnamon and sugar topping. Overall great recipe.

These are virtually the same as in Bettty Crocker's cook book, but that's okay because they are delicious.  There's something special in the texture of this cookie due to the cream of tartar.  Highly recommended!

Too sweet for our taste.  I fixed this by rolling the cookies in the cinnamon-sugar mixture covering just over half of the dough.  Very nice texture and flavor once the sugar was reduced.

We loved these snickerdoodles!  I've tried several different recipes and this is definitely the best one I've tried.  I did have to use extra cinnamon sugar to get a really good coating though.

Really yummy and easy. 8 minutes was the perfect cooking time. 9 made them too done on the inside, not chewy, like my family likes them.

A very nice cookie! Loved the texture and the mild flavor. I substituted a 1/2 cup of brown sugar for a similar amount of white as I like the added depth this gives. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee.

These are really delicious.  I am a big snicker doodle fan, and these are great.   I put cinnamon & sugar in a sandwich sized ziplock instead of rolling them in it. It was easier and less messy than rolling them.  I also took out a little bit of the egg white as someone else suggested (to keep them puffy).  They were too puffy, they barely flattened At all.  I ended up flattening them into disks before baking, which helped.  Next time, I will not reduce the amount of egg white.

this recipe is great with a few tweaks! if you like super fluffy cookies use 3 teaspoons of baking powder INSTEAD of the baking soda. It makes the cinnamon flavor more pronounced and the cookies crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. decrease the temp to 375 so the bottoms do not burn and leave in only for 8 mins!

I've never made Snickerdoodles so I decided to do this recipe since it had so many good reviews.  I followed the instructions to a T and made 3 batches of cookies (12+12+6).  I used a medium size scoop to make the cookies the same size (the Pampered Chef one) which I think it was a little bit bigger than the recommended size.  I baked the first batch for exactly 8 minutes, the second for 9 minutes and the last one for 10 minutes.  They all turned puffy (didn't flatten at all), I was able to switch them to a cooling rack seconds after taking them out of the oven without any issues (just handle with care) and they were all delicious.  The only difference was that the 8 minute ones were a little wet inside and not as crispy as the other two batches.  It was not raw just a little moist.  The 9 minute batch was crispier and to my standards perfect inside.  The 10 minute batch was the crispiest and I found no difference inside the cookie compared to the 9 minute batch.  So that being said I guess it will depend on your taste and your oven.  I did find that the 10 minute batch was darker at the bottom (more than I would've liked) but they were not burnt just very brown.  I think my perfect time is 9 minutes and remember you have to consider the size of your cookies as well.  But they were delicious and very easy to make.  I used a mixer for those of you who were wondering if it would affect the puffiness.  I did use the low setting to mix the dry ingredients in.  have fun eating!

Great recipe. Mine would have come out perfect had I not been too lazy and poor to go to the store and pick up some cream of tartar. Instead I substituted Baking powder in place of the baking soda and cream of tartar. They tasted fine, I just prefer the texture of traditional snickerdoodles, cream of tartar and all. Thank you, Mrs. Sigg.

Made these tonite.. They were puffier than I remember my Momma's. Any suggestions for a flat, chewy cookie. These were chewy, but puffy, which I didn't like. I might add: cooked at 375 for 8 min. used 2 Tbs. sugar 1Tbs. cinnamon

These were wonderful.  I baked for 8 minutes and allowed the cookies to cool on the cookie sheet for 2 minute before moving to the cooling rack.  I used butter and butter crisco.  Also the amount of white sugar to roll the cookies in should be doubled.  As written, you'll run out before you're done. I took them to work and several people asked for the recipe and my family loved them.

These snickerdoodle cookies are perfect. I substituted the shortening with butter bc of I personally try not to use crisco. Other than that, I followed the recipe and nbaked for exactly 8 minutes. Thank you for sharing!

I wasn't very fond of these cookies, but I haven't had many snickerdoodles in my life, so I don't know exactly what is usually expected texture/taste wise.  I thought they were too crunchy, not very chewy - even though I was very careful not to over bake them.  I didn't really want to eat any of them after my taste test.  Sorry, not my kind of recipe, but I wont rate it too low because of the reasons above.

These cookies were easy to make and yummy. I used lemon juice in place of the cream of tartar (because I didn't have any) and the cookies did not turn out lemon-y at all, as I had worried they would.

Mmm! These are fantastic. I took the advice of another reviewer and put 2 tsp of baking powder instead of the cream of tartar- I have always had a problem with the taste of snickerdoodles until I did this substitution. They are perfect and fluffy and I absolutely love them.

I'm eating my second one as I type.  Like others I used all butter and vinegar instead of cream of tartar (didn't have either).  To change things up a bit I added an equal part of cocoa powder- love the mayan chocolate/cin flavor.  I agree with one of the reviewers, these cookies are not too sweet so you can go heavy on the coating.

Great cookie! I haven't made cookies in a long time and my first batch of these turned out perfectly! I pre-made the dough and refrigerated it for a few hours, didn't have the time to let it warm to room temp,  and they still turned out perfect - crispy and chewy at the same time. Yum!

These are fabulous! I didn't have cream of tartar so I didn't add it or the 1 tsp. of baking soda. I just added 2 tsp. of baking powder.  To make it a bit more fabulous I added 1/2 package of Skor bits. Fantastic! Thanks for a great recipe.

Perfect! 8 minutes gave me perfect soft cookies. Mine were not flat either. You need your buttr and eggs at room temp to avoid the flatness.

These cookies are amazing. My boyfriend's little brother love these. (: I followed the recipe exactly. If you want a flat, soft cookie, bake it around 8-9 minutes. If you want a poofy, soft cookie, bake it around 10-11 minutes. I baked my first batch in 8 minutes and it turned out flat, soft. I baked my second batch for 11 minutes, and it turned out poofy and soft and crunchy edges. (:

These cookies are delicious!  I can't keep them in my house for more than a day because they are devoured so quickly.  If you utilize parchment paper, you can remove the cookies asap after 8 mins in the oven, plus start the next batch without as much wait time.  I also upped the sugar/cinnamon mixture to roll them in, but didn't have any probs with too flat cookies or too sticky dough.  Be sure to have butter (real is best) and eggs as close to room temp when you begin.  My DH and kids loved these cookies and  I love Beth's/Mrs. Sigg's cookie recipes, they make me look like a chef!

I am giving this a three based on how I made it.  I of course forgot the baking soda.  So it tasted good but didn't expand into a bigger cookie.  I will make this again because everyone says these cookies are amazing!!

Yummy!!! Very soft cookie with fantastic flavor. I cooked them 9 minutes exactly. The first batch I thought were undercooked but after they sat for a few minutes I decided they were perfect!  Definitely cook for 9 minutes and I make fairly large cookies. Make sure you space them out on your cookie sheet as these are flat cookies not small and compact.

This is a great recipe! Probably the best snickerdoodles I've ever made. My only complaint is that my cookies were pretty small and I only got
2 1/2 dozen, so the yield is a little off unless the cookies are supposed to be tiny. I'll still use this recipe, I'll just adjust the amount.

These turned out great! The only thing I changed was the temperature of my oven.  375 for 8 minutes worked for me.  My husband ate the first 12 to come out of the oven.  He loved them!!

I just made these cookies today (12-21-2009) and they are fabulous! I did make some changes as suggested by others. I used two sticks of better, no shortening. I used baking powder in place of the cream of tartar and I also poured off just a little big of the egg white. They came out DELICIOUS. They're soft and chewy and have such a nice cinnamon flavor that isn't overpowering. I also used a melon baller to get my cookies, relatively, the same size when I rolled them. I will be using this recipe for years to come. Thank you for it!!

Perfect every time. I use one egg, 2 tsp baking powder instead of cream of tartar, and I substitute 1 tsp vanilla for 1 tsp almond extract. Crisco butter flavored shortening works well with this recipe. They're delicious and go great with milk.

These cookies are extremely delicious and very little change is needed. The one problem was the cooking time. Just keep an eye on them and you'll be fine.

I just made these for the second time. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. This time, I followed some recommendations and used all butter instead of shortening. I also let the butter and eggs sit out until they reached room temperature. I also mixed the dry ingredients together before adding them to the wet ingredients.  Making those changes was the best thing I ever did. They went from tasting good to tasting AMAZING. They were fluffier, softer and more chewy. Overall just a better cookie. Oh, how I love snickerdoodles!

You really must chill the dough before making into balls and rolling in the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  The recipe is so buttery that it is hard to work with unless you chill it.  These cookies needed a little extra something in the dough, but I can't really pinpoint it--salt maybe.  They tasted a little flat.  I also increased the cinnamon sugar mixture from 2TBSP to 3TBSP.  Lastly, I used a tablespoon to measure out the balls and then flattened them a little with the bottom of a glass.

I gave these 5 stars because they are tasty, and they turned out fine. I've never had snickerdoodles before and thought they sounded interesting. These were far to boring for my personal taste.

These cookies were so delicious and so easy to make. It was my first time ever making cookies from scratch and I will be making these snickerdoodles again. I also used baking powder instead of cream of tartar never have it on hand but the substitution was perfect.

I took these to a cookie exchange and they got rave reviews. They were really good. The cookies were a slightly puffy. I did not have cream of tartar and used 3 tsp. vinegar in the first batch and 2 tsp. vinegar in the second batch and I think the second batch turned out a little better. I also baked them 9 minutes because the 8 minutes was a little too underdone for my taste. I will make these again for sure!

This recipe is great. It doesn't yeild many cookies, so I would recomend doubling. The flavor is great and the texture is even better- crisp around the edges and chewy in the middle. Thanks for a great recipe.

Oh my gosh Yummm!!! The only change I made was to use butter instead of shortening. I also used a previous reader's advice and took the cookies out while they were "cracked" on top and wet inside. Then, I immediatly put them on a cooling rack.  They were soooo delicious and easy.

After using so many recipes on this site, I decided not to be lazy anymore and sign up to review. The boyfriend asked me to make these. I don't even like Snickerdoodles, normally. Have always thought of them as toast in cookie form. Anyway, with just a couple alterations from other reviewers, these were awesome cookies! My boy said they were the best he's ever had. And I even had a few, and like I said before, I usually don't like snickydoos. Alterations I made with the help of other friendly reviewers: Only used about a half tsp. of cream of tartar and used 2 tsps. baking soda. Added about a 1/4 cup of flour after I mixed it because it was a little hard to handle. The only cookie sheet I have is this tiny child sized one and can only make 5-6 cookies at a time. Still, the dough balls, after they had been rolled in the mixture, stayed moist enough while they waited to be cooked. I also cooked them at 375 for exactly 8 mins and took them off the sheet right away. (I don't have a cooling rack but do have a big wooden cutting board that works fine, for any other rack-less people out there.) I stored the cookies in tupperware and thought they were even better the next day. Thank you!

I thought that these turned out great. My Mom, who is now 84 and can't cook anymore wanted me to make them for her.This recipe brought back some good memories for her. I found that if you cook them on parchment paper they are easir to remove from the tray.

Fabulous!  I hadn't had Snickerdoodle cookies since I made then in home-ec in high school over 20 years ago and they were just as wonderful as I remembered them to be!  I was careful not to overmix the batter and then I chilled the batter before scooping into balls and I bought fresh baking soda and cream of tarter to ensure that they wouldn't flatten out.  The cookies were puffy, slightly crisp on the outside and tender in the inside.  Delicious!  Family loved them...they were so easy...can't wait to make them again!

Absolutely addictive!  I have made these several times.  My kids love them, and I can't stop eating them!  Seriously. =)  I took a batch with me to our Christmas get-together last year (the hostess' favorite cookie), and everyone talked about how great they were and wanted more!!  They were gone before we knew it.

I had never had a snickerdoodle before making these so i didn't know what they would be like, but they were so good! I took some to school for my friends and they were all gone by second period. Now they all ask for snickerdoodles on their birthdays! Thanks for a really good recipe

These are a huge hit everytime I make them.  I substitue the 1/2 cup each of butter and shortening with 1 cup of margarine, but they come out just as good, and a few less calories.

These are amazing!! They do tend to spread a lot so make sure you use parchment paper. Like others have said "Pumpkin Spice" tastes amazing on them! As does nutmeg, which is one of the ingredients in Pumpkin Spice. Try them!

I absolutely love this recipe! I have been making this for a few years and I use it all the time! I always keep an eye on them while they are baking because you really don't want these to overcook, otherwise they won't be soft.

Use an ice cream scoop for more uniformity. We think it needs more cinnamon than it calls for. Really good cookies!

This cookie was delicous.  I made this recipe and everybody has loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and I baked the cookies for 8 minutes like the other reviewers said to and they turned out perfect.  My son asked me to make some more cookies so he could take some back to his college dorm with him!!  I think they went real fast there! This is a favorite cookie for the whole family!! It is a soft cookie which they all liked!

i had a special request for snickerdoodles from a co-worker.  my only experiance w/them were out of a box.  i chose this recipe because all of the high ratings.  they are absolutely delicious!  i used my usual cookie scoop and ended up w/24 jumbo snickerdoodles.  they are not too seet and the cinnamon sugar coating gives them that extra little "something".  i will definately be making these again and again.  very simple to make.  thanks for the recipe!

I have made these several times and can't seem to get a chewy center. The taste is great! I just reheat in the microwave for 5-7 seconds and they become soft in the middle again! Very good cookie!

I've never made snickerdoodles before (odd since they are one of my fav cookies!) so I was nervous but these turned out wonderfully! The first couple cookies I had some issues I think it wasn't mixed well enough. (No pastry blender) After that I just got in and mixed it better with my hands; they were so much easier to work with then! All were puffy and perfect. I plan to give these away so I have to keep restraining myself from eating them all! I'll definitely be making these again and keeping this recipe handy.

I have never used tartar before and I could taste chemical in the cookies little too much. But I like the general taste of this cookie so, next time I will subsitute tartar with vinegar as a leavener.  Thank you for the recipe.

I can't believe I am rating this low, but I have to. I sort through recipes by ratings to be on the safe side and will read through several reviews to get helpful hints, but this recipe did NOT work out for me. They were SO sticky I couldn't work with them. So I thought to add flour to my hands which worked out fine, but the sugar wouldn't stick to the cookie so then I read a review that said to wet the palm of you hands, well, I did that and the cinammon/sugar didn't stick. Sorry but I will not make these again unless someone can tell me what I need to do!

These were fantastic! They came out perfect on the first try. I didn't change a thing.  I pressed the dough balls down a bit with my fingers before baking them, and I baked them exactly 8 minutes. They came out just right.

I normally like to take a picture of the recipes I try on here. As soon as I set the plate down at work, they were gone, so I couldn't take a picture. Seriously. I brought them in on Monday and have had multiple requests that I bring them again next week. Maybe I'll get a picture next time... Probably the best snickerdoodles I've ever had or made.

These cookies are PHENOMENAL! They taste great as is but I think with a little alteration you could come up with a great variety of different flavors. Omit cinnamon in the sugar, put lemon extract in instead of vanilla and you've got a yummy, chewy lemon cookie! Add almond extract instead of vanilla and put a piece of chocolate on top (omitting cinnamon sugar coating) and there's a lovely cookie dying to be eaten. I can't wait to experiment with this recipe!

This recipe is wonderful!  Make sure you bake between 8-9 minutes, and instead of cream of tartar, I used baking powder (1 teaspoon) and vanilla ext.(1 teaspoon).  They turn out perfect!  My husband sneaks them all the time, so that says something!

I am so sorry that I found this recipe. I love snickerdoodles and now that I have this recipe, I'm sure I will be making them A LOT! I have tried every snickerdoodle that I have found (recipes and from cookie shops) and this one is not the best, but it ranks #2 and is easier for me to get my hands on. Very good recipe.

I sub the shortening for an equal amount of butter and then bake at 375 for 9 minutes. These are always outstanding, my sister says they are the best snickerdoodles she's ever had. I sorta hate making them as I can feel myself getting fatter...one is NOT enough!

Good recipe, my daughter even said she liked them better than some we had at a bakery recently.  I followed suggestions to 1) have butter and eggs at room temp, 2) mix wet and dry ingred. seperately before combining, and 3)mix by hand, making sure not to over mix.  I was very satisfied with the results.

Very good, turned out perfect. Make sure you watch them though. one minute over and they get hard, better to have them under done than over done.

These are outstanding Snickerdoodles!!! They are deliciously sweet and extremely soft. I actually used low fat butter and egg whites and added 2 teaspoons of artificial butter flavoring to make mine a little heathier- they still turned out perfect!! What a delightfull cookie!

I wish I would have read the reviews of this recipe before I tried it.  I baked the cookies for 10 minutes - next time I will cut it to 8.  I also used baking Splenda for 1/2 of the sugar in the dough.  MISTAKE!  All sugar next time...there was kind of a wierd after taste in these, and I think it came from that.  All in all, a good recipe - just don't try to change it!

Soooo perfect! These are the best! I did use all butter in place of Crisco and they still came out very yummy. I used the suggestion of others to up the cin/sugar mix and shake the balls in a baggie. I baked the for 8 min exactly and they were done! I would like to hear suggestions on how to get that cracked look on the cookies. Mine came out sort of one dimensional. Thanks!

I tried this recipe once as given, because I don't believe in modifying until you've tried the original.  The original is slightly bland and, if you roll the dough into balls, a bit time consuming and tended to be a bit crisp on the bottom due to the cinnamon-sugar mixture.  The second time around I did as other reviewers suggested and omitted the shortening.  I also did the cookies drop style and sprinkled the tops liberally with the cinna-sugar.  My boyfriend ate the first dozen before they were even cool.  Seriously, don't bother with the shortening and the ball rolling.  You will have an easy, dynamite cookie that you can't bake fast enough for your family!

I bake cookies every tuesday and bring them to my church group every wednesday, and we have them for snack. We made these, and at first though they were going to be too sugary. We tried them and and omgomgomgomgomgomgomg! The light cinnamon is great on these simple, yet delish cookies! Thank you Mrs Sigg for WONDERFUL cookies.

These were so good - I can't stop eating them!  I don't normally like using shortening but found an organic kind that doesn't use hydrogenated oils so I felt good about using it.   I added a small amount of brown sugar to the white sugar/cinnamon mixture.  These are soft on the inside and a little crunchy on the edges.  I baked for 9 minutes.

This was the first time I have ever made snickerdoodles, too.  I made a few alterations to the dough to ensure that the cookies would be moist and chewy - a lot of times snickerdoodles can be crispy.  I used 1 cup of butter and omitted the shortening.  I melted it and then added the sugar.  I subsituted 1/2 cup of white sugar for brown sugar and 1 cup of AP Flour for bread flour.  They turned out just like I wanted - nice and chewy with just a little crisp on the outside.  Will make again!

Very good! I doubled the batch and made larger cookies, so they took a little longer to bake. Took the suggestion of adding more cinnamon and sugar - glad I did. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This recipe is an all-time favorite of mine - I frequently use it to entertain friends. It can be easily doubled or halved.

The one thing to be aware of is that, because they spread out very much, they must be placed VERY far apart, and also they are very sensitive to overcooking. To get that perfect, still-light-on-the-bottom taste, I check them every minute beginning about 2 minutes beforehand.

I have used this recipe for several years now and it's ALWAYS a winner!  This is my husband's favorite cookie and when I used to work in an office it was requested on more than one occasion.  it's quick and easy and the best snickerdoodle you'll ever have.

Excellent recipe!  Very easy to make, looks pretty and tastes better.  The only changes I made were to decrease vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp (my husb. is not a huge fan of vanilla) and to use sanding sugar with the cinnamon for the topping to make it a little showier.

This was my first ever Snickerdoodle and now I see why everyone loves them!! They're wonderful! I had to reduce the oven temp. from 400 to 350 and not all of them cracked, but they were still very good. Thanks!

These are so delicious! I used all butter instead of half shortening, and used about a 1/3 less sugar in the dough, they were still sweet enough, just right. Left out the Cream of Tartar. I didn't have any vanilla flavoring, so I used the real stuff from a whole vanilla bean, and I think that made these sooo good. The inside is fluffy and light, outside is just a bit crispy. Made these with an electric mixer, they were so easy to make! Loved them! Will be making these again.

When I first pulled them out of the oven, they looked and tasted underdone despite cooking them for 8-9 minutes. I let them sit for half an hour and then re-tasted them and they were FABULOUS!!!
I made 3 dozen and was only left with 6 cookies but the end of the day. My DH couldn't get enough of them! Thanks for all the suggestions!

I have made the dough for Beth's other cookie recipes and frozen it to give as Christmas gifts for the last 3 years. Last year I added this Snickerdoodles to the list. It was a huge hit! I use a cookie scoop and drop into a bowl of Cinnamon & Sugar mix. Then place on a baking sheet and freeze 1-2 hours. Then put frozen dough in freezer zip bags. You can bake any flavor, mix and match right out of the freezer. Just place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, bake for 13 minutes at 375 degrees. I found you really need to sift the flour then measure. Especially when making multiple batches. I was asked at Thanksgiving by several family members "your still making cookie dough for Christmas right!?!?!" Thanks Beth

These are great! Really easy and straightforward. I didn't have any cream of tartar so I used twice the amount in fresh squeezed lemon juice. Turned out perfectly. Following some of the other reviewers tips on baking them for only 8  minutes, I found that they needed about 2-3 minutes more then that. They were way to gooey in the centre and LOOKED under down. I also couldn't get them off the cookie sheet without them squishing and changing shape. So 10 minutes is perfect. I also let them sit on the cookie sheet for a minute or two in order to release.

I remember these from my girlscout days when we use to make them which was a nice trip down memory lane. The addition of butter into the recipe makes them decadant. Such a simple cookie but so good and all of the ingredients were on hand so I did not have to make a trip to the store to make them. Yum! Thanks for thinking outside the cookie to improve them.

This is the best snickerdoodle cookie recipe I've made!!!  Not to crispy on the outside and soft inside.  My neighbor came over and wanted to know what I was baking.  I gave her a cookie to try and well, let's just say she took a plate full home!  measure the ingredients as listed and you shouldn't have any problem getting a great cookie. I did chill my dough for 30 minutes before rolling.  Note** it's important to remove cookies to a cooling rack when they come out of the oven and not let them set on the cookie sheet.  They will continue to brown. Happy baking!!!

Excellent cookie! These turned out picture perfect and the flavor was right on. These didn't spread much at all. I love snickerdoodles and these are deserving of 5 stars. Thanks Mrs. Sigg for the fantastic cokie.

My roommate is thrilled whenever I make these cookies. They're light, with just the right amount of cinnamon, and addictive. Even my mom--who's been baking for years--was impressed when I made these. Plus, they're so easy to make; I've only started baking and I got these right on the first try. Definitely recommended.

Even though the recipe said it made 4 dozen cookies, I was only able to make 3 dozen from the recipe. Maybe my cookies were a little on the larger side, I am not sure. Besides that fact, these cookies were wonderful. I followed others advice and only baked them for 8 minutes and I also used a ziplock bag to cover the cookies with sugar and cinnamon. I also followed the advice of using 3 T sugar and 3 tsp cinnamon, and that helped to ensure the cookies were coated well. I brought these cookies over for a get together, and they were all gone within 30 minutes, and there were only 7 people! I will be making these again soon. Thanks for this great recipe.

Take these out of the oven while they are still soft and very light colored - the cinnamon on the bottom makes them prone to a burnt taste. Also, store them with a piece of bread to absorb the air - they lose their chewiness quickly otherwise!

I don't like crispy cookies, so I used all butter instead of crisco and butter and the results were still phenomenal, so good! Also I split the recipe in half and it made about 8 palm sized cookies. Also, I baking for 7 1/2 with this modification was best.

These cookies were very good. They took exactly 8 minutes to bake, and my oven usually runs on the cool side! As recommended by a previous reviewer, if you don't want crispy bottoms to the cookies, just dip the tops in the sugar and cinnamon. Also, the dough is easier to work with if you chill it a bit before rolling into balls.

We're always enjoyed this recipe for snickerdoodles. If baked properly, they always turn out chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I always roll the whole ball in cinnamon and sugar, but often have to mix more by the end. I like the cinnamon and sugar taste! I also always use lard for these instead of shortening (no trans fat or hydrogonated oils, and some think better taste...since you get satuarated fat either way). Definitely enjoy making this recipe when I need a crowd-pleaser.

not sure why i'm bothering to tell you this but these are the best.  followed recipe exactly - but per others suggestions...used parchment paper/didn't put sugar on the bottom/refrigerated dough for a few minutes (although i felt it didn't need it - just don't overmix and you won't have a problem). best ever.

My family gave these three stars, but I wasn't impressed with them.  They were just OK...kind of flavorless, and I personally didn't care for the texture.  I tried using the baggie method someone mentioned to apply the cinn/sug. mixture, but I don't recommend that.  To me, it seemed to "dust" the outer surface rather than coating it.  I think the dough picked up mainly the cinnamon, and not much of the sugar.  They were edible, but nothing I'll make again.

This recipe is almost identical to the Betty Crocker Snickerdoodles Recipe I have been making for 30+ years. This recipe adds vanilla, which is the only differnce. All other ingredients and amounts are identical. I really thought that adding the vanilla would be a nice touch. However, we really don't like the vanilla flavor in these cookies. It takes away from the cinnamon taste. Needless to say, we are very disappointed. This batch will get eaten, but not in the speed the Betty Crocker Recipe does.

I've made 3 different snickerdoodle recipes, and I think my search is over!  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  Definately take them out of the oven at exactly 8 minutes if you want them nice and chewy once they cool.  Delicious!

I thought these had good buttery flavor.  I also used the butter flavored shortening and found that these were best when they were still warm.  They didn't turn out flat like the ones that they make at the Great Cookie.  If they would have turned out flat then I would have given them a 5 for.

These turned out great.  Be careful with the salt...make sure the mixture is blended well.  Also, don't let the dough sit and get warm; the cookies will go flat.  But even the flat ones tasted great!

These cookies were just "alright" nothing too special at all. I found that they became very hard after cooling to room temp and seemed rather dry. I even baked for the minimum amount of time. We love sugar cookies and thought this would be a nice change, I was wrong. No one cared for this recipe at all, sorry, but not worth 4 or 5 stars.

This was fantastic!  After reading many reviews and hints I ended up using Baking Powder instead of the Cream of Tartar.  They turned out soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. I also cooked them for 8 minutes. I took this cookie to a "cookie swap" and it was a hit.

Really good!  Next time I will do 3/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup shortening for more flavor.  Also, I only baked them for 7 minutes and they were moist, soft and didn't dry out.  Great cookie!!! Thank you!

This is an excellent snickerdoodle recipe.  The cookies came out chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside as promised, but I was careful and baked them for only 7 min. because snickerdoodles have the tendency to become hard after cooling if they are baked too long.  I only made one change and added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the cookie dough.  Another recipe to add to your box!

These cookies are really good. However, I did make some changes based on other reviews. I used 3 Tbsp sugar and 3 tsp of cinnamon powder for the topping. Also, I think it all depends on people's oven, I baked the first batch for 8 min and took it out right away, but it came too "set", crispy, and not chewy. So, on the later batches, I baked it only for 7 min and it came out perfect. Chewy, just the way hubby and I like it.

These were fabulous.  Follow the recipe exactly for a delicious snickerdoodle.  I like to take these out of the oven as they're just starting to brown.  They should still be chewy in the center when they cool.

Excellent recipe.  I made these for a road trip, and they were gone long before we returned home.  :)  Thanks!

Yum. I'm no snickerdoodle connoisseur, but these are quite good. Halved the recipe. Only change was to substitute the shortening with more butter. I recommend giving them a really, really good coating of sugar/cinnamon for the best flavor. You definitely don't want to overbake them, which would be easy to do; 8 minutes is plenty.

This is the exact recipe I have been using to make my snickerdoodles for the past 40 years.  It was passed down from my mother and Lord knows how long she had it.  You can not go wrong with these cookies and they are always in demand around here.  In fact, my hubby's nickname for me has been "Snickerdoodle" for the past 25 years.  The only thing I do different is use one cup of margarine instead of any shortening and cook for exactly 8 minutes.  You do not want to over bake these to get the full cinnasurgary goodness.  A classic cookie if ever there was one!!!

I have never had snickerdoodles before...and oh boy, was I missing out!  As per other reviewer's suggestion, I replaced the cream of tartar with lemon juice.  I made the cookies to take to a party, but only half of them made it there - my husband ate the rest before I could stop him!  I wasn't even allowed to take the leftovers home - they were an absolute hit.  Lovely slightly cinnamon taste, crunchy outside and soft in the centre.  Just delicious.

I had never eaten or made snickerdoodles before. The recipe came out great and they were pretty easy to make! Unfortunately, I got ho-hum reviews at work and from friends. They said the cookies were okay and everything, but nothing to write home about. People usually eat seconds and thirds of my cookies. I probably won't make these again. I'll stick to chocolate chip, peanut butter and the regulars!

The first time I made these cookies I followed the recipe.  When I tasted them something wasn't right.  They weren't like other Snickerdoodles I've had.  The flavor was to strong.  The second time I cut the cream of tartar from 2 teaspoon to 1 and 1/2 teaspoons.  The flavor was right on this time!  Yummy!

These are FANTASTIC. I use parchment paper, so I can just slide the paper off the cooking sheet, allowing the cookies to completely cool. Less breakage that way.

Just thought I'd give this recipe another 5 star rating, just in case you weren't convinced yet! I love recipes where I can just pick it up for the first time, make it and it turns out awesome. This is one of those recipes. Very quick and easy. It's fun for kids; they love rolling the dough in the cinnamon/sugar. This is a great classic that will have the young, the old and the in-between coming back for just one more!

BREAK OUT THE MILK!!!!!  This is the absolute best cookie recipe on this website.  Melt-in-your-mouth.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.  My husband is going to die when he eats these.  I have the last batch in the oven and they are fantastic.  They do need about 9 minutes to firm up just right, and it helps when baking cookies that the eggs you use are at room temperature.   This one is going in the FRONT of the Dessert recipe album.  A zillion stars.  Love you Mrs. Siggs!!!

awesome!  I got away with making them missing one egg and substituting the cream of tartar with lemon juice.  Delicious!  Must say, though, 8 minutes it is exactly.

This is the best snickerdoodle recipe ever! I undercooked the first batch because I was so paranoid about overcooking them. They still tasted good and the kids didn't seem to mind. They had fun rolling them in the cinnamon sugar. I didn't change a thing with the recipe. Great cookies! Thanks for sharing!

WOW!  I am NOT a big fan of snickerdoodles, but this is one I like.  I took these to a New Years Eve party...thinking the kids would like these, but more adults ended up eating these!  I will make these again for my whole family...they are easy and quick too!

Absolutely the best recipe for snickerdoodles I've ever made. These beat the ones I had growing up. Only baked for 8 minutes on an insulated cookie sheet and not a single one browned too much on the bottom. Just the right amount of soft and crispy and the flavor is truly excellent. Using good vanilla helps here I think.

These are great.  The dough is super sticky, as is normal with this cookie.  If you have a problem rolling them in a ball, try chilling the dough first and coating your hands in Crisco.

Excellent turnout each time. Followed to recipe to a tee except I put 1/4 cup maple syrup and decreased the white sugar to 1 and 1/4 cups. Took the cookies out after exactly 8 minutes and cookies stayed chewy for 3 days!

My boys loved this recipe.  I did however after the first batch got slightly dark on the bottom cook the remaining ones at 350. I also very slightly flattened them on the top. The results were great. I hope this helps you.

These cookies were beautiful, looked just like the picture....but there was a bitter aftertaste--is that the cream of tartar? I found it unpleasant enough to not want these cookies again. Also, bake at 350 for 10 minutes, if you want to avoid burning your first batch of cookies on the bottom.

PLEASE NOTE:  Normally, I would give this recipe 5 stars, since it is identical to my grandmother's recipe, which I have made before and love!!

However, everyone out there needs to know what NOT to do, which is what I  tried today...Splenda Blend for Baking.  Normally, I have very good results with it in other recipes, but this was a notable exception.  The flavor is no different, but the texture is VERY different.  The cookies did not spread out baking in the oven, turning into laughable hard brown biscuit-shaped cookies.  And they are very dry and crumbly inside.  On the last batch, I tried doing the peanut-butter-cookie-trick of criss-cross pressing them with a fork.  This is the only way that these turn out acceptable -- at least they have the correct shape and color, but still are dry inside.

So, in summary, Ms. Sigworth has a great recipe here, but wanted others out there who are considering Splenda Blend in these cookies to know my experience.

Oh my goodness these cookies were heaven--I baked them this afternoon and I'm sad to say they are all gone. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems with sticky dough or the oven temperature (baked them for 8 minutes and had beautiful puffy cookies)I am sure I'll be using this recipe again and again--THANKS!!

My kids really enjoyed these.....but bake at 400 degrees? Are you kidding me? My first batch burnt to a crisp on the bottoms after 8 minutes. I lowered the oven to 350 and baked for 10 minutes. MUCH better. Also, I refrigerated the dough for 1 hour before I rolled them into balls.

the cookies were great, the roommates and boyfriend love them. Though I really didn't like how it was too soft after mixing all the ingredients together.  I put it in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes before the first batch and put it back in inbetween the rest of the batches.  Other than that, super yummy cookies!

Shalom, these cookies were scrumptdiliumptious. However according to my speculations, 2 cups of butter are better than one due to the fact that we substituted the butter for shortening. It gives the cookie a more delctable taste and makes my tummy want more! P.S. my fellow scientists dig these cookies yo. Ciao and Bon Appetit! Cheerio until next time!!

I tried to make these twice, but they turned out very dry and puffy and eventually hard.  I'm hoping that this is because I substituted Splenda and margarine for white sugar and butter.  Other than that, I followed the directions exactly.

Very good and easy to make. To avoid the bitter aftertaste, replace cream of tartar and soda with 2 tsp baking powder.

Very sweet sugar cookie, turned out exactly as the recipe says, they were soft centered with crisp edges. Personally I didn't find they were cinnamon tasting at all, next time I may add more cinnamon to the mix or even just roll them in coloured sugar for the holidays and skip the whole cinnamon idea.

These required some extra work (I made a lot, so it took a while to roll them all in the cinnamon sugar) but they were delicious and make for a beautiful presentation.  Great for the holidays :)

I tried this recipe hoping for a soft cookie,
these were not. If your looking for a soft
cookie with great flavor I suggest using the 
'Soft Sugar Cookies IV' recipe on this site
and rolling them in sugar and cinnamon.

i wonder what i did wrong in making these cookies.  i was so looking forward to tasting them.  i read all of the other reviews and adjusted accordingly and the cookies just tasted horrible.   they were very sticky to handle even after chilling.  i wish that i hadn't wasted my ingedients on this recipe.

This is a quick and easy, great tasting cookie.  It's nice in a pinch, because you usually have all the ingredients on hand.  I have substituted stick of margerine for the shortening and worked just as well.  My stepfather loves these and they make an excellent addition to a holiday cookie tray.

I gave this four stars because the recipe, as it is written, may cause the cookies to burn. The time to bake was too long (at least in my oven with a thermometer). My first batch burned on the bottom which is easy to do with all the sugar on them. I would warn to watch the cookies carefully and place on a higher rack. They were delicious when not burned.

Beautiful cookies! I had never eaten or made Snickerdoodles before so i wasn't sure what to expect. I love them (I'm having trouble leaving them alone as a matter of fact). I don't think I would try flattening the cookies before baking, as others have suggested: I like the domed look of these cookies. The only change I made was to use all margarine instead of half butter and half shortening ~ but that was only because I didn't have any butter (which I prefer to bake with) and the margarine in my fridge was the cheaper kind. :-P great recipe Beth.

These are fantastic!  Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I can't stop eating them.  My friends think I'm a great cook--little do they know, it's really the great recipes like this one, lol.  It's going in my Tried & True recipe binder.

Look no further.  This is the classic snickerdoodle recipe.  The combination of butter and shortening, I believe, is what makes this cookie both crunchy and soft at the same time.  Just a note, I always use a cookie scoop to insure consistant size/shape for uniform cooking and I swear by the use of parchment paper, especially if you have coated a cookie in sugar like the snickerdoodle.

Thanks Mrs. Sigg for your wonderful recipe.  Here are some of my notes and advice I followed...
· Changed ingredients: used all butter, 1.5 tsp vanilla, .5 tsp almond extr., 3 C. flour, pinch salt.
· Refridgerated dough for a little while.
· Rolled 3/4" balls.  Shake inside bag of cinn/sugar mix – 2T/2t. mix is just barely enough.
· Placed them 7x5 on cookie sheet.  Flattened w/ cup
· Baked at 375* F for 7min. Nicely Crackled, puffed, but flattened out.  Made 150 x 2” cookies
· Froze some pre-rolled ones. Baked 6min at 400*F + 7min at 350*F - little too long, came out really crunchy, but stayed puffed w/o flattening - not very crackled, but still yummy! - will try to perfect this baking time, but such a good idea for rainy days when you only need a few fresh cookies :) Thanks for all the good tips everyone!

I have read all the reviews on this cookie and I'm amazed by how many people are saying to cut down the cooking time....mine came out perfect with the amount of time that was suggested by the recipe. I'm sure everyone will agree that each oven cooks differently; so a little adjusting may be necessary. This cookie is probably the best snickerdoodle I ever ate/made. They are absolutely fantastic and smell wonderful while baking. Thanks, Mrs. Sigg, for sharing such a great treat!!!!!

I've been making these cookies every Christmas (and in between) for three years now.  They are lightly crisp on the outside and chewy inside, and taste wonderful.  I only need to bake them for 6 minutes to have them come out perfect.  Don't change a thing with the recipe! Thank you "Mrs. Siggs"!!!

Love 'em.  Just love 'em.  Definitely double the cinnamon-sugar portion, you'll need it.  I used 1/2 organic (raw) sugar and 1/2 white...it made for a nice "crunchy" finish....  a foolproof recipe (make sure and keep to the time limit).....LOVE 'EM!

These cookies were not only very easy to make, but really delicious. I chilled the dough for 30 minutes before I handled it, and doubled the amount of cinnamon and sugar. Watch out - they're addictive.

YUMMY!  These are excellent cookies...they were gobbled up FAST!  I had to bake mine longer than 10 min...but it could be my weird oven or the new baking sheet.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing, Beth.

I never thought I would find a snickerdoodle recipe that could stand up to my mom's, but, guess what? This one did!! I was looking for a snickerdoodle recipe last night to make some up real quick for my granddaughters and they were fantastic! Sooo chewy in the middle and crisp around the edge. Perfect!! Thanks Beth. This is the recipe that I will use from now on. Glad I found it just in time for Thanksgiving and especially Christmas! I would like to add that I only left mine in the oven for 8 minutes.

These were the best snickerdoodles I ever made. My picky 17 year old daughter loved them. I made these a year ago for her high school band and they loved them. I did not have cream of tarter so I substituted baking powder instead. The cookie came out very soft and chewy. Great recipe will continue to make these/

Very good snickerdoodles.  Do not overcook them.  They definitely don't look done at 10 minutes, but any longer and they lose their softenss.  Even if they don't appear cooked, pull them out at 9 minutes for a nice soft cookie.

Do I really need to say these cookies are fabulous with all of these other reviews here?  I did the 3tsp/3T cin/sugar in a baggie per someone's suggestion on the site and it worked great.  I've made these numerous times and they are ALWAYS a hit.  I even messed up and put too much flour in one time and they were still great, just a little poofier, slightly less chewy in the middle.  Now I do it on purpose occassionally just to change it up once in a while.  I do tend to be paranoid about overcooking them so I think I might've pulled them out too soon a couple of times.  They have become my signature cookie because they are so easy to make in a crunch.

Very good cookie.  Made them about 5 days ago and they are still relatively moist from the cookie jar!  I accidentally put some of the cinnamon in the batter, removed what I could, but it was a nice addition!

Hey can I give this recipe 10 stars?  Absolutely delicious! This was the first time I've ever attempted to make snickerdoodles and it was just perfect. The kids gobbled them all up and asked for more. Will definitely save this recipe and make this again :-)

My dough was too sticky to form into balls, even with adding more flour and chilling.  So I just did drop cookies and sprinkled them with the cinnamon sugar mixture.  Delicious.  Everyone loves them, said they're "waaaay better than Fuddruckers' Snickerdoodles!"  Amen to that.

They were a big hit.  I have a gas oven and baked them for 9min.  Next time I will do less because they weren't as soft in the middle as I would have liked them.

I made these for a get-together and they were gone within minutes. Someone actually asked me if they were made at a bakery. 

Do not substitute for the shortening in this recipe. It's what gives the cookie it's texture and rich flavor.

Fantastic, soft, chewy cookie.  The only thing I did different was to only cook them 5 - 6 minutes. There are never any of these cookies left at the end of a party!  Thanks for this keeper

Excellent recipe!  I used all butter instead of shortening!  They were great, but I let the butter get too soft, so they were a little flat!

My family are snickerdoodle experts.  I try every recipe I can get my hands on and enjoy the slight variation of each one.  This is a great traditional recipe.  Snickerdoodles must be crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside - and these are.  Using a small cookie scoop I made about 40 cookies and they took more like 10 minutes per sheet to bake.  Use a silpat baking mat for extra protection.

thanks for the wonderful cookie recipe-a keeper!  My kids loved them and the whole house smelled wonderful while they cooked.  I used butter flavored crisco instead of plain shortening and they turned out fine. This is a great soft chewy cookie.

This cookie hardly needs another review, but I just had to rave.  These are very good, light and tasty, perfect with a cup of tea.  I had 60 cookies instead of 48 and mine weren't that small.  Basic ingredients, everything you would already have in your pantry.  Delicious little morsels!!!!!

These cookies were as good as any snickerdoodles you can get at the bakeries.  I was hesitant to use shortening (I prefer butter) but it made the cookies light and airy, and the cinnamon flavor was excellent.

Yummy!  Yummy! I have never been too fond of Snickerdoodles, but these are just unbeliveable! They are way better once they are completely cooled off and the taste has a chance to really come out.  My picky 3 year old just inhaled them.  Trust me, you'll love them!

Thanks to Beth Sigworth for the yummy recipe!
Loved these cookies.  Baked at 375° for 8-9 mins.  Used parchment paper, and cookies slid right off.  However, I use airbake pans, and I think they'll be fine without the parchment paper, so next time, I'll experiment. Thanks also to young cook, JANICE427, who suggested creaming the butter and sugar by hand.  Good tip!

I had never heard of snickerdoodles before I came across this recipe, so I wasn't sure of how they were supposed to turn out.  But they were VERY yummy.  I used an ice cream scoop to drop them onto the trays, and then sprinkled them with the sugar/cinnamon mixture (which kind of was concentrated in the middle of the cookie and sparser on the outside edges as it spread but oh well).  I also (whispers guiltily) melted the shortening and butter instead of softening and creaming it, but it worked out fine.  I'd definately recommend this recipe to others.

I was called to make snacks for my daughters pre-school class at the last minute (a couple of hours).  I didn't have a whole lot on hand to prepare anything, so I turned to All Recipes.com and found this wonderful recipe.  My daughters (3 & 5) even helped.  I only had egg substitute but they still turned out great.  Instead of rolling into balls and dropping in the cinnamon mixture, I dropped by teaspoons onto the cookie sheet and sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar mixture on top.  They won raves from everyone.  The kids loved them and the teachers even asked for the recipe!  I agree on the 375 degree oven for 8-10 minutes.  My husband agreed these were the best cookies ever.  Thanks for sharing the great recipe!

I made 13 dozen of these for a cookie exchange.  They were easy to make and delicious.  I made the mistake of making the first couple of batches of cookies too big and they didn't cook flat with the typical snickerdoole "cracks" on top.  I would suggest making the dough balls small- this way they cook perfectly at 10 minutes.

This was the first time I ever tried snickerdoodles.  My friend wanted to buy some at the mall and to me, they looked terrible and were quite expensive.  I made some and I was hooked.  I try to find a reason to bake them at least once a month . . . or more.  They are great.

Simply Delicious!  I gave them out at Christmas and everyone loved them.  Everyone wonders how they turned out so soft.  
I let them cook the minimum time. They don't quite look set up, but the turn out so soft and tasty.

These cookies were an absolute dream!  I used a cookie scoop, which made it fast and easy to work with the dough.  The cookies were delicious with a capital "D".  They were similar in taste to McDonald's sugar cookies that are sold individually.  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe.

A great recipe.  My husband is a loyal chocolate chip cookie fan and rarely wants any other cookie, but after tasting these, he asked why it took me so long to make them!

Wow, definitely some of the best snickerdoodle cookies out there. BUT there are some "musts" that you need to keep in mind:

Make more of the cinnamon and sugar than it calls for-- I doubled the recipe (including the cinnamon & sugar) and it was not enough. I recommend making 2X the amount it calls for. Keep in mind that I made my cookies a bit smaller. 

Cream the butter and sugar together ALONE before you mix the rest of the wet ingredients in if you are mixing by hand. It will create clumps of butter that are such a pain to get out otherwise. 

Also, be careful of overmixing the dry ingredients in the wet; do the least stirring as possible-- it's probably just easier to mix by hand. 

I cooked my cookies for 8:30min and it made the bottoms crispy and the insides soft. 8 minutes for me seemed like it was too moist on the outside (but it really is personal preference). 

For some reason, my later batches turned out flatter than the first ones. I don't know why, it could just be my oven, but just be aware that it is a bit difficult to get these cookies exactly uniform in size.

So I literally just pulled my first batch out of the oven and here are my thoughts and observations:  They turned out great! 

First things first.... I didn’t have on hand and didn’t want to spend money on shortening or cream of tartar so I doubled the butter and took the advice of other reviewers and mixed the baking soda with lemon juice and that worked great! It worked out better for me to roll the cookies in the sugar and cinnamon mixture on a flat plate rather than in a bag. I found that my bake needed to the full 10 minutes (maybe because of the altitude where I live?).  The most important advice I can give you is....  unless you are extremely talented or a baking gymnast, I don’t recommend trying to move the entire sheet of cookies from the baking sheet to the cooling  rack in one swift move.  Trust me when I tell you it’s easier to move them one delicious ‘doodle at a time. 

These cookies turned out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside and so yummy.  I’m not talented baker but this recipe is easy and a new favorite.

Made recipe exactly as described. I take them out at 8 min exactly. They will seem too soft, but by the next morning thet will have cooled and set into perfection. If you are eating them immediately you might do 9 min, but to take in to work or for events, make them the night before and take out as soon as possible. They will be perfectly soft and melt in your mouth with that soft tang from the cream of tartar.

I followed the recipe as is except did 1.5 times recipe and used 2 inch cookie scoop making 53 cookies.  I might just double the recipe next time!  I don't think there is a way to improve upon this recipe.  For my oven 7 minutes was perfect.

This is an awesome cookie recipe! If you don't have cream of tartar, you can substitute 1 teaspoon of baking powder for 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar (for this recipe, sounds crazy, 4 teaspoons). This recipe is so delicious and my whole family adored it! My younger brothers kept asking for some over and over!

Excellent recipe.  Follow the directions as written and you can't go wrong.

For those of you reading previous reviews for this recipe, please do NOT test for freshness of baking soda by placing in water and looking for the fizz.  Baking soda requires acid to fizz so test by mixing with diluted vinegar.   Using water alone only works with baking powder (it is a mixture of baking soda and acid).

Yes, yes! These were excellent. I creamed the butter, butter flavored shortening and sugar first, adding eggs one at a time afterwards, then added the remaining dry ingredients only after mixing them together first. I preheated my oven to 375 degrees out of intuition and baked for 8-9 min. Boy, did these goodies come out bangin!

Hands down the BEST Snickerdoodle recipe ever! I’ve been making these EXACTLY as the recipe states. I do usually make a bit more cinnamon sugar mixture than the recipe calls for- I always seem to run out half way through. This recipe makes about 3.5 dozen, 2.5 inch diameter (cooked) cookies. Cook them for exactly 8 minutes, keep on cookie sheet for 1-2 minutes after, as they are pretty soft (and will continue to bake). If you do that, you will have perfect, golden brown bottoms and slightly crisp edges and soft, chewy centers. Perfection!!

These snickerdoodles turned out perfect!  They look and taste fantastic.  My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter helped me measure so I probably added a little extra flour with her help :).  They rolled into balls with no problem and baked perfectly at 375 degrees for 9 minutes.   I will definitely make this my go-to snickerdoodle recipe.

Hi, I don’t typically review recipes, but thought this one warranted it.  I read a few reviews and wasn’t sure how this recipe was going to turn out (so many “must do this way” comments)... I followed the recipe as written with the exception of letting the eggs get to room temperature (not sure it made a difference).  I think the cookies came out perfectly. They taste just like snickerdoodles should and they look great too.

This is the BEST snickerdoodle recipe and the only one I ever use. My brother in law loves them and they are always eaten right up! But DO NOT over cook them! They will become hard and far too crumbly. I keep an eye on them and sometimes do a test sheet of cookies for the first round. You want them to be lightly (emphasis on lightly) brown. Sometimes when I take them out they still look a little raw, but worry not, they stiffen as they cool and make for one delicious and chewy cookie!

absolutely thee best!!! I made these two days in a row. the family gobbled them up so fast. I needed more cinnamon sugar to roll in and I found out that my cinnamon was too old by grabbing a different bottle to make extra. Wow...it's a significant tasty difference. So, in addition to checking your baking soda and cream of tartar...use new cinnamon.
this recipe is super easy using a wooden spoon and a small scoop and it makes a lot of yummy cookies. highly recommend this recipe. also I baked for 8mins only.

I modified the temperature to 375 degrees.  I tried 2 cookies at 400 and the bottoms burnt.   That is too high of a temp for cookies.  Mine turned out perfect at the lowered temp.

I had no cream of tartar so I used 3tsp lemon juice (all I had) and the cookies came out exactly as described--just like the picture!  Very good- a slight crispy edge, soft middle, perfectly round even though the balls i formed were not perfect.  Easy to follow recipe- great result!

I have made these cookies three times now following the recipe to a T.  The first time I made the cookies, I was really disappointed.  I was making the cookies for a coworker's birthday and The cookies turned out super flat.  I like my snickerdoodles to be thick and soft on the inside, so I was pretty bummed.  I opted to leave the cookies home and pick up a fruit tray from the store.  

My second experience was also for a coworker's birthday.  I felt like I needed to try the recipe again.  Once more, I followed the recipe to the letter, and my first dozen came out perfect.  My second dozen were flat again.  Confused, I realized the only difference between the two batches was the cookie sheet they were cooked on.  I placed the third dozen on the first cookie sheet and viola! Perfect cookies.

Now on my third time cooking these, I have switched all my cookie sheets to match the other and all my cookies are perfect.

The moral of the story, the cookie sheet may affect how your cookies turn out.  In my case, the aluminum cookie sheets I had used in the past created flat cookies, but the non-stick sheets (Wilson brand....not sure that matters) work wonderfully.

All in all, the cookies have great flavor and I will definitely make them again.

Fabulous.  I have tried many snickerdoodle recipes and my three children told me these were the best ever.  Not only did the cookies taste wonderful, they also looked beautiful (not flat at all).  I did not have cream of tartar so I substituted with lemon juice.  Baked for 8 minutes as other reviewers suggested.  Perfect!  Thank you for this delicious but simple recipe.  This also made a great sugar cookie.  Just roll in plain white sugar instead of cinnamon/sugar mixture.

I have made this recipe several times and they came out wrong once but were delicious the other times. I usually add chopped white chocolate though because I prefer them that way and everyone I shared them with loved them, some even too much. I used all butter as shortening is unavailable in the Netherlands as well as baking powder because cream of tartar isn't available either but they still came out great. I have even frozen a bag of dough - rolled into balls first - twice to get that fresh cookie awesomeness every single time.

There goes allrecipes again making me look good. I took these to work and they were gone in no time. I got complements all day about how good they were. My only suggestion is to list the dough ball size. I made the first batch too big and they took longer to bake, plus I only ended up with about 3 dozen. 1-1 1/2 inch size dough ball works better.

Didn't have cream of tarter on hand. Substituted 2 tsp of baking powder for the tarter & soda. I put the dough in the freezer for a few minutes prior to rolling it in balls so that it would hold its shape. Turned out perfect. Light & fluffy.

They turned out nicely. Didn't need to add more flour and cookies rolled with no problems as mentioned by some other reviewers. I made them fairly large and baked 9 minutes.  I rolled all the cookies and them dropped them into the cinnamon/sugar mix, using a baggie to keep the mess contained.

i have always loved my moms snickerdoodles, however i found this recipe and its pretty darn close to my mommas.  The only problem i faced making these is they are super chewy....Just the way i like them, I just dont know why they turn hard after they have cooled. should I add more baking soda? I have noticed that most of the time when I bake cookies I run into this issue. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

I tried these cookies and didn't really like it. The cookies are way to cakey for my taste. I prefer flatter and crispier cookies. If you don't like cakey cookies, don't try this recipe.

I think this recipe is amazing! I made 2 inch. balls that expanded into gorgeous cookies! I baked mine at 375 for 12 minutes. The edges became crispy and the centers stayed soft. I will make this for years to come. Yum!

Great recipe, I've made them before and we love them. This time I substituted cream cheese on a one to one ratio instead of the shortening. I added another 1/4 cup of flour to make less sticky. We love cinnamon, so I added 1tbs to the dry ingredients also. Crispy On the edges and very chewy with excellent flavor.

Love these cookies!  So soft!  The only thing I did different was substitute two things. I replaced baking with baking powder instead of baking soda and cream of tartar. I didn't have cream of tartar and decided to test my baking soda as suggested by the original poster and it was inactive. So I just doubled the baking powder to 2 tsp. I also used double butter because I had no shortening. They were still so puffy and delicious!

Not overly sweet. Great texture. I did use a larger amount of sugar and cinnamon for the topping. 3T sugar and 3 tsp cinnamon . Used a ziplock Baggie for rolling in topping.

These are by far the best! People are always impressed and think I'm some expert baker when I present these. Lol Took two plates, piled high to my friend's Halloween party one year, with the expectation she'd have some left over for herself. However, every last cookie was gone within 15 minutes.

I've made many batches of these cookies for friends and they're always a hit. I don't have cream of tartar in my pantry, so I usually use 6 tsp of white vinegar instead. So delicious!

Are amazing but I would be careful with the size of the ball you want for the cookie. They do spread out and I wasn't thinking about it but yeah

Perfect! I followed the recipe exactly, except for doubling the cinnamon sugar mixture. Baked for 9 minutes since I do like my cookies a little crispier but they centers stayed chewy. These cookies are wonderful and remind me of my own childhood.

THE BEST snickerdoodles ever!  Instead of 2t cream of tartar I used 2t baking powder and baked at 375 for 9 minutes.  I've made these dozens of times and get flooded with compliments every time. I've already made them twice this holiday season and expect to make them again for New Years.  You cannot go wrong with these cookies!!!!

I had never made snickerdoodles before, and these were easy and good. I reduced the sugar to just over 1 cup, and they were still plenty sweet. Very pretty cookie, too!

Perfect! I've tried many recipes for snickerdoodles and this is the easiest recipe and the tastiest. I didn't have cream of tartar on hand so I used 2 tsp of baking powder in its place and they tasted perfect! Before baking I used the bottom of a measuring cup and pressed down on the cookies and they came out just as they should.

Chilled the dough, Needed more cinnamon/sugar than recipe called for. My oven is calibrated 5 degrees cooler and at that, I cooked them for 9 minutes for a very light golden brown. Great recipe!

Fantastic recipe!  I'm on a holiday baking spree this week and this very simple cookie has been the favorite out of the assortment.  I followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception of using pumpkin pie spice vs. cinnamon and increasing the baking time by two minutes.

This was a really great recipe.  The cookies themselves are not too sweet but very soft and satisfying.   I didn't use the cream either and used the lemon juice in its place and that worked very well for us.  I set me cook time to 9 min which was gave them that perfect crunch.  Delicious.

Perfect snickerdoodles. Just as I remember from my childhood. Hard but not really crispy on the edges and soft and moist on the inside. I eyeballed the balls I rolled and the recipe yielded 4 1/2 dozen perfect!! snickerdoodles.

As a baker, I love to try new recipes from allrecipes especially with high rating. After following the recipe exactly, I found that the flavors definitely had potential, but there was too much cream of tartar that you can taste and the cookie itself was far too crunchy. I like my cookies soft and unfortunately this recipe as is didn't deliver. My mom, however,  will love this recipe since she prefers a biscotti-like crunch. But as for me, I wont be making this recipe again.

Just made these and they turned out great. I used a 1/2 cup butter flavored crisco and 1 teaspoon water in place of the shortening. I am definitely saving this one.

These cookies are divine! I followed the recipe exactly and leveled off my tablespoon for uniform size and cooking. At 8 minutes and 20 seconds they are a tiny bit crispy on the edges and chewy and tender inside. Im fighting off the husband and 4yo so I'll have some left for family care packages. Honestly, these are too good to make with anyone around lol Thanks for the keeper!

The snickerdoodle recipe to end all snickerdoodle recipes. Seriously, this is perfect. My main complaint about most snickerdoodles is they lack the "tang" they're supposed to have (otherwise, it's not a "snickerdoodle" to me). If you don't like the tang, you might want to drop the cream of tartar by a quarter to a half. But that's not a snickerdoodle to me. Perfectly soft insides, crispy outside, light and airy, with a tangy aftertaste. I bake cookies once a year--for Christmas--and this is the only cookie I bake. I can't get cookies like this anywhere. As for timing, ovens are going to vary. For me, at 400, 11 minutes works exactly right. Experiment with a few batches to see where it's how you like them with your oven.

So beautiful and so easy to make!   Thank you to everyone who suggested 8 minutes as the perfect baking time.  That turned out picture-perfect cookies for me.  My husband doesn't like snickerdoodles, but he loved these!  If people enjoy eating something they wouldn't normally touch, that's a great recipe!  This is going in my keeper file!

My family loves these cookies. They are soft and chewy. I took them out at 8 minutes and they were just barely under done so I put them back for 1 minute longer and that was perfect. I substituted margarine for the 1/2 c. shortening because I did not have any and I only had a 1/2 c. butter left. I also substituted the cream of tartar and baking soda with baking powder because I had no cream of tartar. I was worried those modifications would ruin the cookies but they came out absolutely fabulous. Best cookies I have made so far. Simple and delicious.

These are so GOOOD!!!!! I just made them omg! Only tip is i used 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening, used my hands instead of the mixer, and dont forget to use parchment paper or foil bc they will stick if you use butter. SO GOOD!!

Very easy cookie to make. The only change I made was 4 tsp. of baking powder. I have made other cookie recipes with baking soda and cream of tartar and didn't like the taste. Also tried varying the oven temp between 375 and 400, the cookies had to be closely watched at the higher temp. Other than that I was completely surprised at how easy the cookies were to bake. Unfortunately I has to make another batch of cookies. Couldn't keep from eating them!!!!!!! Thanks for the versatile recipe. Next time I am going to try lemon extract with lemon zest.

This recipe is a winner. Makes lovely, light-textured cookies that are crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Perfect! When I make them they are gone in less than 24 hours. I live at high altitude and I chill them for a few minutes and then bake them for 9 minutes at 375.

Just made these - used all butter, did let the dough chill for about 30 minutes prior to rolling into balls.  I put the cinnamon/sugar into a small bowl and just rolled the dough ball around until it was coated - worked great.  Once the cookies bake and spread (and they will spread!) the coating will not be so dense, so don't worry if it seems heavy-handed.  I used my Silpat baking mats, let the cookies bake for 10 min until set (but not wet looking in the center) then brought them out and let the cookies sit for about 5 minutes on the baking sheets.  They came right off the Silpats without sticking (once they had cooled a bit) and I put them on cooling racks.  For a few cookies I substituted Pumpkin Pie spice for the cinnamon - haven't tried them yet but couldn't resist a fall twist on these yummy cookies.  Oh and I was careful not to overmix once I added the dry ingredients.  My cookies puffed up nicely.

These came out really good. I wanted to make sure they were puffy, therefore even though I had cream of tarter and baking soda on hand I bought new just to make sure. They did not come out like in the video but they were chewy in the center and crunchy on the outside. My son was happy, so that's all that matters to me! I'll definitely use the recipe again ??

I tried this recipe as an end of the year snack for my culinary class and my teacher, who has a particular palette, fell in love with them. I will defiantly make them again. Thank You! :D

LOVE this!!  Live overseas and often bring stuff to the office to give local staff a "taste" of the US.  These are, by far, the favorite cookie!!  My only suggestion--add nutmeg to the cinnamon-sugar topping.

Great recipe.  Nice and soft.  I see some had issues with not coming out right.  Keep in mind how fresh/old your ingredients are, the temperature outside and inside your home, incorrect measurements.  Turned out perfectly.  The dough is really soft when you mix it so putting it in the fridge will make it easier to work with and shape the balls.  Like 10 minutes or so.

I've been baking this recipe for about 10 years now. It's the only snickerdoodle recipe I've used since I've found it. If you want PERFECT snickerdoodles, this is the recipe to go with. I've also tried it with it just rolled in sugar because I didn't realize I was out of cinnamon one day and they were devoured. They make perfect sugar cookies as well :)

I added 1t salt (since it seemed short) & 1/8t baking powder (for a little omph!).  These were fine.  'Didn't like this recipe any more or any less than other snickerdoodle recipes.  It made 3 dozen - using a cookie scoop - exactly the right amount of cinnamon-sugar.  The cinnamon-sugar itself was a little - well, cinnamony :/  Yeah, yeah, it was supposed to be.  'Think instead of 1 part cinnamon to 3 parts sugar, an increase of 4 parts sugar might be better.  It's just a little strong of not-sweetened-enough cinnamon with the first bite.  'Got a thumbs-up from E,17; 'Don't want more than one from K,15.

FIVE STAR!!Followed recipe to the T, and it turned out very well. This is the kind of cookie that you can't stop eating, I tell ya.  I formed larger cookie dough balls instead of the smaller on as shown in the video, if at that, I should say was the only step I might have altered though.

Followed to a T and they are perfect. Second batch in the oven now. I'm not a professional but I'm a pretty more-than-occasion baker so I've baked my fair share of a variety of goods and this recipe is spot on. Thank you for submitting it!

Very good cookies. The recipe was easy using ingredients I already had in my house. Cooked them for 9 minutes and they were crispy on the sides and chewy inside. Just perfect.

first time making snickerdoodles and these turned out perfect! definitely change the 2 tsp white sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon to 3 tsp sugar and 3 tsp cinnamon. I did what one reviewer wrote and put the cinnamon sugar in a baggie and dropped the balls of dough in, gave it a good shake, and had it perfectly coated. Also, my dough was initially very crumbly - but about 1/4 cup of water helped A LOT. my sister, who isn't really a fan of cinnamon, couldn't stop stealing them off my plate. :)

Loved the recipe. I used the 2 teaspoons of lemon juice instead of the cream of tarter. I also made the cookies larger as recommended in the comments and cooked exactly 8 minutes. My husband is the ultimate snicker doodle fan and critic and said I finally figured out the recipe and to not change one thing.

This is the first recipe I have felt the need to review- these are by far the best snickerdoodles  I have ever made. A little crunch on the outside, but perfectly soft on the inside. A keeper! I should add, if you are looking for another great cookie recipe- try the blackberry almond thumbprint cookies. Also amazing!

All I could taste or smell was the shortening. I'll just stick to plain butter.

My son made these and they were fab! We used  3/4 cup butter and no shortening and replaced cream of tarter with baking powder, since we didn't have those ingredients.  My son took them out slightly under cooked and let them sit on cookie sheet a minute before removing.

Very good cookie. However, the dough was very soft and sticky.  I added about 1/2 cup more flour and chilled the dough for about 20 minutes.  I also added quite a bit more sugar to the cinnamon/sugar rolling mixture.  I baked the cookies at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, and removed them from the pans immediately.  I used shiny insulated baking sheets covered with parchment paper and had no trouble with burning.  Beware any kind of dark cookie sheet! The resulting cookie was just as described, tenderly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I'll be making these again!

Still a favorite cookie. I use my 1.5 tsp scoop and it makes 72 cookies. I cook them for 9 minutes.   12/20/2013 I become very nostalgic when I think of Snickerdoodles. It was the cookie my grandmother always made when I would spend two weeks with her during my summer vacation from school. While these don't quite measure up (would any recipe unless she made them?), they are awfully good.

Great cookie! I add a little cinnamon to the dough too for extra flavor. If they are flat add about 1/2 cup flour more.

Every Christmas, I make between 15 and 20 different cookies to give away on cookie platters. Over the years, I have tried making snickerdoodles many times with many different recipes (including my grandmother's). But I never could get them to turn out right. These are perfect! I did not change a thing. Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!

I do not know what I did wrong but these cookies do not have any flavor I added extra flavor and baked another batch still not much flavor.

I give this a 3 1/2 stars..

Really good!  I didn't change the recipe at all and they turned out great!  But I put a lot in balls and put them on a plate, then dipped them as I needed them.  But one thing, if you don't like to much cinnamon I would suggest using only 1 tablespoon of cinnamon instead of 2.

So delicious. Never had snickerdoodles so poofy. They don't go easy on the calories, but they're worth it. They're also good with half-wheat flour.  Next time, I might take out some of the salt. Coconut oil can be substituted for shortening as well.

These are amazing! I just finished making these for my hubby since snickerdoodles are his favorite, but I can't stop eating them. They turned out just like they were described and look great too. I did have to sub self rising flour for the all purpose,baking soda,and salt. Turned out just perfect though! Can't wait til hubby gets home and tries these. Thanks Mrs. Sigg

So good!  Tastes like a delicious cinnamon sugar cookie and NOT like cream of tartar and shortening.  I intended to make a batch for my coworkers but between my boyfriend and my roommate and myself the entire batch was gone before the hour was even up.  Had to make a new batch for the coworkers.  They stayed soft and delicious and I had everyone BEGGING me to make them again!

This recipe was so yummy and worth making. I had to tweak it slightly since I didn't have cream of tartar. Instead of the baking powder and cream of tartar, I used 3 tsps of baking soda and just for good measure I added a small box of instant vanilla pudding mix. They came out awesome!! Thanks for this recipe!!!

Oh my YUM!!  Though it is fine on its own, I found that doing 50/50 butter and coconut oil really added a nice flavor. Also, I took another reviewer's advice and used a tad more flour. I don't measure the amount, but let's just say I'm more liberal with it.   Forming the balls seems easier and less sticky with the extra flour added.

Simply amazing.  Snickerdoodles are my husband's favorite kind of cookie, and after 10 years of marriage I had yet to make them for him.  I was a bit intimidated, as I wanted to get them right. After reading through several recipes and reviews, I decided to give these a shot.  They were perfect.  Flavor and texture both turned out exactly the way he likes them, and they were fun and easy to make. Thank you so much!

These cookies were almost PERFECT!  A little bit crunchy on the outside edges and chewy in the middle...YUM!  However, I thought the cinnamon sugar mixture that I rolled the dough in was a bit heavy on the cinnamon.  Probably just personal taste!  An easy fix nonetheless...I just added two more tablespoons of sugar (4T. Sugar to 2T. Cinnamon) and used the left over mixture for a cinnamon toast snack.

Perfect! I used a dark nonstick cookie sheet and set the oven at 375. Crispy on the outside with soft center, as promised. Yum. This is my new go-to recipe for snickerdoodle cookies.

My first batch of Snickerdoodles ever, and with a husband and 5 kids in the house the 4 dozen cookies this recipe yielded have numbered days! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the Cream of Tartar. I used 2 1/2 tsp. of lemon juice instead. I baked at 400 for 8 min, as others suggested. They turned out beautifully!

This has become my family's favorite cookie recipe!  I use coconut oil from the fridge for shorting & add a little more cinnamon to roll them in because we love cinnamon.  My oven must bake hot because they bake best at 375.  This dough keeps really well in the fridge if you want to bake some now & some later. Thank you for this great recipe!

Helpful Tip:Theses are really good cookies and a good recipe. But, just like with Cut-out cookies, the dough once you have put all the ingredients together, needs to be refrigerated for at least three hours. If you do not refrigerate first before baking them, they will be extremely greay and sticky when you are forming them into balls to then roll in the cinnamon-sugar mixture.Tip:they will still be sticky and gooey. when you are forming them into the balls rolling them in the palm of your hand however, does that just from your normal body temperature. After you have all of the balls on the cookie sheet, slightly wet the bottom of a rounded glass, and slightly press the balls down. Note:you do not want to completely flatten the balls, just slightly flatten. This allows the cookies to bake more evenly. Enjoy!

Always a hit. I had to use substitutions for both the cream of tarter (I used 3 teaspoons baking powder in place of both cream of tarter and baking soda) and shortening (vegetable oil) - and my picky, picky friend always devours them! People love them and since I'm not huge on snickerdoodles, I'm never tempted to over eat (though I do find them pretty good!).

This is the second time I've made these and this time they were perfect! I didn't add the SALT because I had salted butter. The first time I made them I added the salt and they were too salty. After I put the balls of dough on the cookie sheet I smashed them to about a little over half an inch thick and a inch apart from each other because I don't like flat cookies and i sprinkled some extra cinnamon/sugar on top then baked for 10 minutes. I took them out of the oven while they were still soft so they would not be too hard later. Everyone LOVES these cookies. Just made 40 and they are almost all gone!

Pretty tasty.  Did a few changes:

1) All butter, no shortening.
2) 3 teaspoons vanilla.
3) 3 teaspoons baking powder in place of soda and cream of tartar.
4) Baking temp at 375.

I added green food coloring to make them green for St. Patrick's day...and threw some green beads into the pan with them.  Taking them to the party...if I can keep my family out of them! Nope...not flat. Use NEW baking soda and you should have perfect one's...like I do. I uploaded a picture of them on here too.  Happy St. Patrick's Day from this Irish woman (who didn't make Irish cookies haha)!  ****UPDATE**** It's a year later and I'm going to the same party and those cookies have been requested!!!  They were GONE before the party was over!!!  The best recipe I've EVER used for these!

I made these one night when my boyfriend and roommate wanted something sweet. They came out awesome and were very easy. I sprinkled sugar on top when they came out of the oven and they ate all of them.

My only problem with this recipe is by rolling the balls of dough in the cinnamon/sugar mixture they were completely coated.  This ended up making the cinnamon way too strong.  I'm surprised that none of the other reviews I've read have mentioned this, makes me wonder if I did something wrong.  Also, be careful not to over bake, remove them before they brown or they turn rock hard.  I'll have to revisit this recipe.

These are so good! I used all butter. I must have made my cookies a little bigger because I got just over 3 dozen. Perfectly done at 8 min.  A reviewer said to test baking soda in water to see if it's good to use, but it should say to test it in vinegar. You test baking POWDER in warm water. Baking soda in water doesn't do much of anything.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I accidently used half a stick of butter instead of half a cup of butter and they still turned out awesome.  I also baked them at 350 for ten minutes.  I had to make second batch because I couldn’t stop eating them.

Hands, down, the best! Nice and crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. As suggested by some other reviewers, I used new baking soda and cream of tartar, and the cookies were nice and fluffy. Also only dipped the tops in the cinnamon/sugar mixture to avoid burnt sugar on the bottom of the cookies. Best snickerdoodles I have ever made.

This is the best cookie recipe! I love snickerdoodles and so does my family. This is also constantly requested since I started making them about 1 1/2 years ago. If your family loves snickerdoodle then this is the cookie for you!

I follow the recipe word for word and have never had a problem. If I have a problem it's usually my fault because we are all too busy eating the first batch to hear the oven when my second batch is ready to come out.

These turned out great! Did some swapping like others did, no cream of tarter I used baking soda instead and used an extra 1/4C of flour and chilled it for a few minutes and baked for 8-9m and they turned out perfect!

After all these years, I think I've found Grandma's cookie recipe!  These are just like I remember her making when I was little!  Cannot wait to surprise my family at Christmas with these!  VERY, VERY GOOD!

My friends and family love this recipe!! I normally have to add about 1/4 to 1/2 extra flour to firm up the dough to roll it in the cinnamon and sugar. I also drop the temp to 375* and bake for exactly 8 minutes and removed them immediately from the cookie sheet. It sets the cookie but leaves just a slightly "doughy", chewy center with a crisper outside that everyone LOVES!!

I love this recipe. It was so quick and the cookies turned out perfect. I followed someone's advice of adding 1/4c flour and baking for 8 minutes! I quadrupled the recipe and it still turned out great! Thanks!

Excellent!  I think the use of both butter and Crisco sets this recipe apart.  It was perfectly chewy with a slightly crunchy crust.  Couldn't have been better.

I used butter instead of shortening because that's what I had. I also baked them at 350 for 10 minutes. Everyone thought they were very good.

Been making this for several years now. It's a huge hit in our household. At first, I made about 36-42 cookies, but I noticed they get dry and stale really fast. So I decided to make BIGGER cookies (about 18 cookies out of this batch) and it is just like from a bakery. Large and moist. YUM! It just needed extra few minutes in the oven.

I have no idea why, because I have made snickerdoodles for years.  Tried this recipe and they turned out very cakey-high, and left a grainy aftertaste.

BEST. SNICKERDOODLE. EVAR. Seriously, this was freaking AMAZING! I followed a commenter's tip, and took them out of the oven after 8 minutes and let them rest on the cookie sheet for a minute or two. I also followed another commenter's advice about increasing the cinnamon/sugar powder to 3T sugar and 3tsp. cinnamon. I'm glad I did! because it was barely enough. I'm wondering if the poster ate half the cookie dough before baking the cookies? If so, I can't blame her! The cookie dough is delicious... but the cookies are even better! I wish I could rate this higher than five stars :)

This is an excellent recipe.  Here are the changes I made:

1. I didn't have shortening, so I used butter instead.
2.  I didn't have cream of tartar and my baking soda was old, so I used baking powder instead (which is basically cream of tartar and baking soda combined).  I used total of 3 tsp and it worked well.
3.  I baked the cookies for 9 minutes, as they did not look done after 8 minutes (I'm not sure if that made a difference though)

Overall, this recipe is a keeper.  Very yummy treat!

This is my go-to easy cookie recipe.  I use all butter (no shortening) and my secret is to add just a bit of freshly grated nutmeg in with the cinnamon-sugar mixture.  Otherwise, I follow the recipe as written.  People are always ask me for this recipe and tell me these are the best Snickerdoodles they've ever had!

These came out dry and hard when following the directions. The flavor was nothing to write home about either. Disappointing since my boyfriend loves snickerdoodle cookies.

i used all butter and it was very good.  I made the dough without rolling in the cin.sugar and put it into 24 muffin tins molding it up the sides.  baked for 8 minutes, let it cool and then add the ingredients for cream cheese blueberry pie.  very very yummy (liptons7/12)

Delicious! Mine did not turn out puffy and crackled, but the taste is awesome. My eggs may have been too big, so the dough was really gooey and they didn't puff up much...but I will be making these again soon and will try smaller eggs (my baking soda was fine and the cream of tartar was new). Definitely worth making (and sending to loved ones overseas!)

excellent very simple snickerdoodle cookie... a sugar cookie with a little cinnamon twist... I don't know why the other reviewer said it is best to use butter and eggs at room temperature... I tried that and my dough was very sticky and hard to work with... inbetween cookie sheets I popped it in the refrigerator and after 15 minutes it was so much easier to work with.. also I didn't have cream of tartar which can be substituted by using double the amount of lemon juice... I took out the cream of tartar and baking soda completely and used the equivalent amount of baking powder (because it can be substituted by 1 part baking soda to 2 parts cream of tartar) and a splash of lemon juice... mine did not turn out flat at all... the substitution seemed to do the trick... also I think the reason for removing them from the cookie sheet right out of the oven has to do with the ease of taking them off the cookie sheet the longer you wait the more they stick.. but be careful because they are soft fresh from the oven... great easy cookie!!

Great recipe. I had no problems with this recipe. I would recommend really stirring the flour and baking soda well before adding to butter mixture. Really helps remove the taste some reviewers have mentioned. Will be making this again!

amazing cookies! Never made snickerdooles before but these were great! I did as others suggested and removed them at 8 min and took them off the pans right away and put them on a cooling rack. Will be adding to my recipe box to make again! Also, I did as another reviewer suggested and put the cinnamon/sugar in a zip lock bag and put the cookie dough in one at a time, worked awesome.

These taste so good however if you use about 2 tablespoons of dough and only cook for 8 minutes they dont get done enough. Just cooked a little longer and they were AMAZING!!!

I liked these a lot.  I tried making Snickerdoodles when I was a kid, but they were a little too tricky.  

To avoid getting those HORRID cream of tartar lumps in the cookies, I subbed 2 tsp of baking powder and 1 tbsp white vinegar.  Skipped the cream of tartar altogether.  They came out REALLY good.  Bake the cookies for just about 8 mins on 350 degrees.  When the cookies settle, they are best with a softer middle.  Thanks so much to all of the people who left notes on here.  I used the tips and was very successful because of fellow reviewers.

This recipe turned out great.  Like others, I had no cream of tartar so I used 2 tsp. of white vinegar instead.  These were easy, they came out light, crispy and chewy in all the right places, and taste great.  

I agree - 8 minutes max.  FYI - my dough was quite light and sticky.  I thought I might need to chill the dough before rolling, but  I baked off a few w/o chilling first and they came out just fine.  So I just used my 1 TBSP scoop to make the balls and keep my fingers relatively clean.

Followed this recipe exactly. Cooked for 8 mins and then let them sit on the cookie sheet for about 5-10 mins to cool before moving to cooling rack. Very good!

Yum!  It's been years since I've had a snickerdoodle cookie.  I didn't have shortening available, so I used all margarine.  Maybe that's why the cookies didn't crack on the top like they usually do?  It doesn't matter, though...  the cookies were very tasty and the consistency/texture was perfect.

Brought back memories of when I was a kid and my mom used to make these.  Thanks for sharing!

UPDATE:  I just made another batch of these, and they're just as yummy as the first time.  VERY good recipe!

Delicious, though temperamental. They were underdone one moment, and burned on the bottom the next. If you think they're not done enough, don't leave them even one minute! Check again in thirty seconds. Literally. I left them in for LITERALLY one more minute.

The first time I made these, they didn't come out quite the way I wanted them to. The recipe is not to blame. They were all mistakes on my half. However, the cookies I made today were perfect! I will be using this recipe quite frequently. Thank you!

These turned out beautifully for me. I cooked them a little too long, so they were chewier than I prefer. I like soft, doughy cookies, so I'll cook them less next time.

These are the best Snickerdoodles ever!  I agree with the person who said that the key is to make sure that your cream of tartar and baking soda are fresh, though.  We made these the first time with old cream of tartar and they did not flatten out and get the crinckles on them like they are supposed to.

These are great cookies.  Fresh baking soda definitely is key if you want fluffy cookies.  I actually like these cookies the second day better.  They are so chewy and delicious.

This is my 13 year old son's rating and he's a self-proclaimed snickerdoodle expert. :)

They poofed up nicely and had almost a cake-like quality.  Very very tasty. We will definitely be making these again!

This is my first allrecipes review and I have to write in to share what a wonderful recipe this is. My delicious batch of snickerdoodles is disappearing very quickly!  I did make a couple of changes and followed some very helpful tips from some reviewers.  Here are the changes I made: 1) I used whole wheat white flour instead of the all purposae white flour.  The cookies turned out a little darker than using the white flour and they had a denser texture which was outstanding....and just a teeny bit healthier!  2)  I used butter in place of shortening since I don't use shortening.  Be sure to use slightly softened butter. 3) I used 2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice in place of the cream of tartar 4) I used large eggs, not extra large eggs.  If you have extra large, just eliminate a bit of the white  5)  I mixed the ingredients by hand and did not use a mixer at all  6)  I baked the cookies for 8 minutes only and removed right off the cookie sheet to eliminate cookie flattening.  These cookies are wonderful to dunk in coffee, too!  Bon appetite!!!

I have to be honest and say that I was nervous about the amount of sugar and the oven temp this recipe calls for, but I was wrong about both. These are awesome just as written! Now I wish I would have tried these before Christmas. Oh well, they will be added this year!  Thank you Mrs. Siggs  :)

Made these for this past Christmas season and they came out absolutely beautiful.  So easy to make and they taste great.  I always use a 1 inch cookie scoop which makes scooping a hundred times easier and perfectly proportioned.

After briefly chilling the cookie dough in the refrigerator, I used a small cookie scoop and dropped a few balls at a time into a gallon ziploc bag filled with the cinnamon/sugar and coated the balls gently.  8 minutes was perfect.  Cooled on the pan for a couple of minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.  They are the best snickerdoodles I have ever eaten, and ridiculously amazing while still hot/warm.

Before finding this recipe, I tried the Betty Crocker Snickerdoodle recipe and they turned out flat. However, Mrs. Sigg's Snickerdoodles are moist, fluffy and tasty.  !!!

never made snickerdoodle before wanted to try and make it to see what it tastes like, and WOW!
loved it.  I also made chocolate ones, reduce flour to 2 1/2 cup and 1/4 cup cocoa powder and it came out great too! Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe, this one will stay in the family for years to come.  I used some of the idea's from the other reviews. I didn't use the cream of tartar.  I used 2 tsp of baking soda, 2 tsp of lemon juice, 1/4 tsp salt mixed it together and put it in the creamed mixture and then added the flour. Thank you

These were okay, however, I prefer another recipe that I've been using.  I wasn't crazy about the vanilla taste and they seemed dry even though I baked them as directed.

Great basic recipe, but fairly plain. More spices could be added to enhance the flavor. I recommend only baking them for 6-8 minutes because the time designated made them a bit hard for my liking.

So good, so easy!  The only thing I'd say is to reduce the amt of cinnamon for rolling, or increase the amt of sugar.  I made these for xmas gifts and was sad that I couldn't eat them all!

Delicious!  Even though they may not look done at 8 minutes, it is best to remove them and let them cool a couple of minutes on the sheet pan before transferring them to the rack.

I won a bake off with this recipe!    My cinnamon and cream of tartar were newly opened.  I used a scoop to ball them up.  I got about small 60 cookies out of this recipe with my small scoop.  I had no problem with thin cookies.  I had never made snickerdoodles before!  Thanks Mrs Sigg - you rock!

I love this recipe! I used it for a cookie exchange today and got so many compliments. I'm now printing out copies for friends. I use more than 2 tbsp of sugar and cinnamon to roll them in but otherwise I follow the directions exactly. Thanks!

I have made these  few times.  While Snickerdoodles aren't my favorite cookie, it's a crowd-pleaser and this recipe IS my favorite for snickerdoodles.  Others don't add vanilla... but this is essential!
One adjustment: Add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the egg/sugar/butter mixture if you want the cookie to have more of cinnamon taste.  These normally come out as sugar cookies with a hint of cinnamon (which is also GOOD!)

Easy, simple recipe. maybe not blown out of the park, but still it was perfect for what i was looking for.
i used butter instead of shortening (which i didn't have on hand) and they still came out great. Love them!

YUM-MY! These are my husband's favorite cookies, and I have made them several times now. I have yet to justify buying cream of tartar just for this recipe, but have replaced it with equal parts white vinegar with great results. (Although I heard that baking powder is baking soda and cream of tartar, so you can use it instead to replace BOTH ingredients?) Other than that, I have followed this recipe exactly. I pull the cookies out at 8 minutes. They're cooked all the way through, but still have a great doughy taste!

These were fantastic! Instead of just plain sugar and cinnamon to roll them in, I used the same amount of Penzeys Baking Spice which is a mix of Ceylon softsick Cinnamon, rich Mace, Sweet Anise, and a hint of cool Cardamom. Same great taste, but the Anise kicks it up just a bit for people to ask "I dont know what else Im tasting, but I really like it".

Great texture and flavor - must be the combo of butter and shortening.  They were a little soft to roll, but if I had been more patient, some time in the fridge probably would have helped that. :)

I used almond extract instead of vanilla just because we love it, & oh my goodness - they are spectacular! I will never use another Snickerdoodle recipe, I have now found one that's perfect. 
The dough rolled easily into balls & was not sticky. I was able to remove them immediately from the cookie sheets without having to wait a minute or two. I do use silicone baking sheet liners & these may have made the difference for those of you who had problems with that. 
Such a simple cookie, but absolutely divine. I do suggest you trying these using the almond extract. I promise you will love them.

I used margerine instead of shortening and also relplaced the cream of tarter for 2tsp baking powder.  These turned out very soft and yummy!!  I dont roll cookies by hand, I put them in a round tupperware dish and shake the dough around in the sugar.  This way they are covered and rolled at the same time and my hands stay clean.  Also if you want very soft centers take the cookies out of the oven as right after they start to crack.

Good cookies.  Baked just as written and came out perfect.  I did put the dough in the fridge for about 45 minutes because I was too busy to bake them right away.  Came out puffy and chewy and just a bit crispy around the edges.

Great, easy recipe! I made these with 2 toddlers assisting me & they loved it! I used a store-bought cinnamon/sugar mixture, but only because it was in my pantry. I also took the advice of others & used 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I used a tb & tsp spoon to measure the dough out..baking cookies for 8 min & 7min respectively. You won't be disappointed!!!!

I don't like snickerdoodles honestly, but this recipe is very good, and fun to make. I would suggest less cinnamon for those of us who can't xontain so much spice.

The perfect snickerdoodle recipe!  I sifted the dry ingredients together before mixing, otherwise I followed the directions to a "T".  I made mine rather large, so had to bake for 11 min. and they turned out soft and delicious.  Thanks!

My favorite cookie, hands down!  I tend to adjust recipes to suit my own view of what something should taste like.  The only change that I've made from time to time is to substitute 1/2 C brown sugar for some of the white to ensure that I get a deeper caramel sugar flavor and a slightly moister cookie.  My  co-workers are always begging me to bring more of these cookies.  High praise, indeed.

wonderful recipe!! i cant stop eating them=]. i followed the recipe as written with no modifications and they came out beautifully. my ONLY critique is that since "a spoonful" isnt too specific, i was leary about the time it should stay in the oven. and even still, it wasnt that big a deal and 8-9minutes turned out to be good after all. these snickerdoodles were easy to make and left me a lot of cookie dough to store for later on. EXCELLENT!!

This is the only snickerdoodle recipe I will use.  I've been making these cookies for years now.  To keep the cookies from becoming too flat, I usually refrigerate the dough for an hour or so before baking.  If I don't have shortening on hand, I use a cup of butter instead.  Love these cookies!

Best snickerdoodles I have EVER tasted! Be sure to use new baking soda to prevent flat cookies. Mine were fluffy and perfect :) :) :)

I'm suprised this recipe has gotten such rave reviews.  The cookies spread out so much and they had a crunchy texture.   A really good snickerdoodle should be crunchy on the outside and have a nice soft slighty chewy inside.  I won't be wasting my time with this recipe again.

Awesome. Made these for Christmas presents last year, and everyone loved them. They're light and slightly sweet without being overly sugary, and the texture is so chewy and soft. It's a nice change from typical cookies.

the dough is easy to work with and the cookies stay soft in the middle. Be careful not to overcook. This is the best snickersoodle recipe I have ever made. I think the mixture of the butter and the shortening do the trick

Great recipe! Made subtle changes. Substituted cream of tartar with 2 tsps baking powder added 1 package instant vanilla pudding to flour mixture (helps cookie stay soft & moist) and used 1 Cup light brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. Mix wet and dry ingredients separately then add ry ingredients to wet in batches until fully combined. Baked for 9 minutes at 350 degrees. Cookies came out perfect! My son loved them as did my staff!

This is identical to an old Betty Crocker cookbook recipe and it is my go-to recipe for Snickerdoodles. Excellent as written, but I always double the cinnamon and sugar mixture as I always run out otherwise.

I used all butter for my cookies and I've never made snickerdoodles before so I'm new to using cream of tartar, but I did notice the bitter aftertaste other people had mentioned, which is why I gave this recipe three stars. Aside from the aftertaste they came out looking nice and my dough was just fine... I had no problems with it being too sticky. I know my oven runs hot, so I baked mine @ 375 and only cooked them for 6-7 minutes so I could make sure they came out chewy since my first batch I left in for 8 minutes and were a bit too crisp for me. I had fun making these but the after taste just kind of ruins the cookie for me.

We love these!!! I live at high altitude so have to make minor adjustments to make baked goods come out right. I add just a bit more flour and reduce the temp a bit. Make sure you pull then out when they flatten and start to crack. If you wait until they turn even a little golden brown, they'll be crispy not chewy. Either way they're delicious!!

These were great.  I agree with other reviews that this should be hand mixed.  I have a powerful Bosch mixer, and the cream of tartar and eggs will fluff up to much if you let it run to long.  Perfect texture with and hand stir.  Cream the eggs/sugar/vanilla/shortening/butter, then sift the rest of the ingredients and combine ingredents then Leave It Alone!  Leave the mixture nice and wet, dont give in and add more flour.  Put drops off it onto a plate with plenty of sugar and cinnamon, sprinkle and little on the top of the dollop then you can roll it with your hand without getting sticky.  If you dont overwork it, and you dont add more flour to make it easier to work with, you get the PERFECT texture.  Take it out after 8 minutes and let it finish on the cooling rack. it will seem really soft, but it stiffens right up as it cools.

Excellent.  Made for church coffee hour.  Crisp outside soft inside.  Followed recipe except used all butter and used extra sugar cinnamon for coating.  Perfect bake time for my oven was nine minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These were fantastic! They were easy to make, and disappeared just as easily. I made a batch yesterday and promised to make another batch today. That doesn't happen often, so I was surprised. Did use more sugar/cinnamon mixture than was called for, but that didn't hurt anyone's feelings. Thanks for a real keeper!

I had never made snickerdooles before, but this is what my husband requested.  These are so delicious!  Very hard to stop eating, and the dough is great too!  I followed the recipe exactly, baked for 8 minutes on parchment and did not over mix the dough.  I also made sure my butter and eggs were at room temp.  These came out wonderfully!  Slightly crunchy on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside.  YUM!

This recipe is flawless. I didn't change a thing other than halving the recipe and the cookies turned out terrific. Soft and chewy with delectable cinnamon flavor.  Flattens out nicely but not TOO much and taste delicious. Haven't tried any other snicker-doodle recipes but with this one as my first lucky try, I wont need to! Thanks to the submitter.

Really delicious, no-fail cookie, but I make a few tweaks to work for me: I use all butter; I live in a country where there is no cream of tarter, so I use 3 tsp of baking powder. I have made hundreds of cookies over the last few months using this recipe, and it never disappoints. I often will roll them all and dust with cinnamon-sugar and then refrigerate the dough balls and bake off as necessary.

I followed this recipe to a T. Everything was at room temperature, so that wasn't a problem and my baking soda is new. Maybe I over mixed, I don't know. I'm in high elevation so maybe that had something to do with it too. All I know is, they came out flatter than a sheet of paper and aren't even edible. Taking them out earlier didn't help either.

I love these cookies, I do make thema little differently though. I put the cinnamon in with the flour mixture and roll them in colored sugar crystals to make the occasion I am making them for.

Perfect snickerdoodles.  My kids eat these up.  I have made dozens and dozens as Christmas gifts.  I find leaving the dough in the fridge overnight makes it easier to roll out the cookies.

These are awesome! I accidentally messed up the recipe by adding the cinnamon to the flour mix so I didn't roll them in the cinnamon/sugar mix - but they came out so good! They are so soft! I don't really care that they "flattened" when they cooled. I had fresh cream of tartar so I don't know why they did that but it doesn't matter, they are so delicious!

These cookies were awesome!! Crunchy outside with a soft chewy inside.  I did not have butter on hand so I used 3/4c shortening and 1-2 Tbsp canola oil and they still turned out great.  I followed all other ingredients.  As other reviewers suggested 8 min was just the right amount of time in the oven.  Will definitely make again!

Pretty darn good cookie! I somewhat agree with other reviewers that there is a strong cream of tartar + shortening flavour. Next time, I will use all butter (I rarely bake with shortening anyway) and substitute baking power for the cream of tartar. Also, I ended up with a rather crumbly cookie mix as compared to other types of cookies (like my go-to chocolate chip recipe) but they still turned out as expected: crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy in the middle. I baked them for exactly 8 minutes. Good cookie!

A great recipe 'as is.' It's essential to use all white sugar or the edges don't get crisp, and very important to take the cookies out of the oven and off the baking sheet even if they don't look done. The only thing I was forced to substitute is baking powder for the cream of tartar and baking soda because neither of those ingredients is sold in the country I live. Same great results. My go-to recipe, which is identical to a famous red/white cookbook.

Amazing!!! Wonderful cookie.  

I didn't have cream of tartar, so I subbed the soda and tartar for baking powder.  So yummy.

Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome cookies.  Just added more sugar and a little more cinnamon to roll dough balls in prior to cooking.  8 minutes at 400 is perfect!!

Followed others' advice and increased sugar to 3T + cinnamon to 3.5tsp...also was sure to hand mix the recipe.  Cookies turned out wonderful after baking for exactly 8min and removing immediately from cookie sheet.  I also stuck the rolled dough in the fridge/freezer for a couple minutes before placing in the oven to help keep them from spreading.  Fabulous flavor, easy recipe!

This is a great recipe. Personally, I think the real trick is to A) make sure the butter is soft (not melted) and to B) really cream the sugar and wet ingredients. I let mine go until it was nice and light and then folded the dry goods in. The resulting dough was perfectly hydrated and just barely sticky, but very easy to handle. I scooped a healthy tablespoon onto 3/4 sheet pans lined with parchment paper and baked at 400 for 11 minutes (YMMV of course). The result? A wonderful cookie with mildly crispy edges and a nice, soft interior. I do recommend using a good quality cinnamon and, if you can get your hands on it, C&H Baker's Sugar.

I made these exactly as indicated and they turned out perfect!!  Crispy on the outside, chewy in the middle, and nice and puffy...mine did not flatten out.  Also, I just poured some sugar and cinnamon into a flat tuppeware, rolled the balls, tossed them into the tupperware, and rolled them around.  I left them in there until I was ready to put them in the oven!  Delish and easy!!

use all butter instead of shortening. Have eggs and butter at room temperature. Instead of 2tsp cream of tarter, replace 1 of the tsp with baking soda. This will make it less tart!

Great taste, texture, and size! This was my first attempt at making snickerdoodles, and they got gobbled up in no time flat. Had an awesome crunchy outer layer and nice and soft on the inside.

As suggested, I substituted 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom for the cinnamon and it was quite good. I could have substituted a teaspoon easily. The secret to a nicer "bite" was discovered accidentally. Half of the dough was refrigerated while preparing the first batch. The second batch was better.

I tried these and followed the instructions perfectly. I even read some of the other tips people left. Nothing worked. They were too sticky. They wouldnt cook at all the way through. Ever batch I tried doing somehting different like adding more flour, cooking them longer..i eventaully added more baking soda which made them even worse.

These cookies are awesome!  They have a wonderful flavor and stay fresh for days.  I thought the vanilla was too strong at 2 tsp. - kind of overpowered the snickerdoodle goodness - so I cut it back to 1tsp. - perfect.

every pregnant womans dream cookie right here!!!  I was a little skeptical about the cream of tartar due to other's reviews and the "after taste" but I am here to tell you this is one of the best cookies I have ever had.  I am an excellent cook but a TERRIBLE baker.  I followed others suggestions of hand mixing all the ingredients and they came out perfect!  8 minutes is the ticket, they are crunchy on the outside and perfectly gooey in the middle.  Not sure how old my baking soda was, but I know it wasn't "fresh"... however it didn't seem to make a difference.  I did not have shortening so I used an extra 1/2 cup of butter instead, no problems!

Absolutely delicious cookies!  I used 1 tsp baking powder, and 1 tsp lemon juice in substitution for the tartar.  This recipe is a keeper!

These were absolutely to die for! Cooked them so they were just underdone before pulling them out - meant a very soft cookie that melted in my mouth. This is my new stable snickerdoodle recipe.

Can you rate it 6 stars? I went the lemon juice route, no cream of tartar - everything was fine. I also used regular cheap margarine instead of the butter/shorting combo, again it was fine. And by fine I mean awesome. I think the ratio of sugar / cinnamon is fine, but you will need more then what it calls for. Will be making these again, SOON.

I followed the recipe as is and these turned out excellent. The only discrepancy was the cooking time, depending on the size of the balls. About 8 mins for small balls, 9 for slightly larger ones. Definitely take them out before they look done!

I've made these twice the first time they didn't come out right and i ended up with a hot mess.   After reading someones post that mentioned that baking soda will go flat and to test it by putting some in a little water to see if it fizzled, I realized that was my problem tried again and they came out perfect. This is an excellent recipe, and the cookies are delicious.

These are the best!  I had another recipe I used for years and now I'll use this one to replace it!  It's our new favorite cookie for Christmas.  I did have to make more cinnamon/sugar mixture, though!!

These turned out wonderful -- crisp outside, super soft in the middle. I used baking powder instead of baking soda because my soda was bad. They turned out so well, I'll likely use powder from now on with these. They were super easy to make too!

Made exactly according to directions and they came out perfectly.  I used the smallest Pampered Chef scooper and they came out in uniform shape.  I did double the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Next time will use all butter.  I also refrigerated the dough between bakings.

These were absolutely delicious!!  As recommended by others, I used 1C butter and baked for exactly 8 minutes at 375.  They came out perfect.  I also very lightly sprayed my baking sheet with Pam.

I've tried many different snickerdoodle recipes over the years and finally gave up.  Till today, I decided to give one more try and settled on this recipe.  These turned out pretty good, so far the best snickerdoodles recipe that I've tried.  Will be making again.

These were really yummy! Ours turned out puffy despite the fact that my little helper turned the mixer on high and made the flour poof out of the mixer!! We guessed how much was on the floor and replaced it and surprisingly they came out great!!! We used a little cookie scoop and had plenty of dough left over for later. Great recipe!

I am not myself a huge fan of snickerdoodles, but my family is. And they say this is the best one I have ever made. I personally loved how soft they were in the middle and not hard like all the other ones I had made in the past. I wouldn't change a thing about them.

Honestly the best I've ever made or eaten. Remove them from the oven while they are still puffy--they will set up just beautifully if left on the baking pan for a few minutes. NO ONE turns these down. (TIP: Use a cookie-scooper, much like an ice cream scoop, to produce uniformly shaped cookies.)

OMG- so good. My five year old and I just made a batch of these. They were very easy, fun (my son loved the rolling in the sugar/cinnamon), and most of all- DELICIOUS. Thank you, this will now be my go-to recipe for snickerdoodles.

Great cookie and so delicious.  I use 1 cup of butter and no shortening.  I just can't bring myself to use that stuff.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it is one of the favorities in my house.

Yum Yum.  I made the balls by heaping tablespoons, and maybe they were a little big, because they took the full 10 minutes.  They came off the cookie sheet just fine, and also I only got 27 cookies.... however... they were 27 yummy cookies!  I used the lemon juice instead of cream of tartar, although I am not quite sure of the connection.  But regardless they were scrumptious.  Thank you Mrs. Sigg.

Very Good Recipe.  I follewed it exactly, except I rolled my cookies into balls, froze, and then baked at 375 for about 8 minutes.  This made them soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  Would make again:)

Thank you, Mrs. Sigg! Snickerdoodles are my husband's favorite cookie, but I never made them before now.  This recipe was so easy and turned out perfect.  I didn't have shortening so I used all butter; otherwise followed directions exactly.

I'm sad that my cookies didn't turn out flat like in the picture...they were very puffy! I am 100% positive that is because I subbed vanilla yogurt for the shortening to save on some of the fat/calories. I also had to use a bit more flour than the recipe called for in order for the dough to be stiff enough to get into a ball and roll in the cinn/sugar mixture. I cooked at 400 for 8 minutes like several other reviewers said to and the bottoms of my cookies were still burnt black so I think next time I will lower the oven temp a little bit. These were really great cookies!

Made as written with the exception of cream of tartar - didn't have any so I used 1 tsp lemon juice - tasted great.  No lemon flavor at all.  Cracked, crispy outside, chewey inside. Good cookie!

This was a semi-hit with my husband (it is his favorite cookie) the only complaint he has is that they need more sugar so they don't taste so floury. Next time I will make it with 2 cups of sugar. Otherwise it probably would have gotten 5 stars. Overall a very moist yummy snickerdoodle.

The best snickerdoodle recipe I've ever made. Just the right balance of chewy and tender crumbly, with picture perfect crackles on the top. The recipe makes about 2.5 dozen. I baked them yesterday and they're already all gone!

These cookies were great, I've never made snickerdoodles before, this was a great place to start. I did add 1-1/2 tablespoons of baking powder to help them puff up. Everyone loved them.

awesome cookies! One thing I do differently is add a tbl. of fresh lemon juice instead of cream of tartar. It gives the cookies such a wonderful, slight lemon flavor. I find that the cream of tartar is sometimes a little too acrid for my taste. My husband is VERY picky but he loves these cookies and they are super cheap to make!

Delicious, replaced shortening with butter and it turned out great. Could definitely stand more of the coating, not super sweet otherwise.

This was a wonderful recipe.  The cookies were nice and crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, just like a snickerdoodle should be.  I decreased the oven to 390 degrees and baked for 8 minutes and they were perfect!  I increased the coating to 3 tbsp sugar and 3.5 tsp cinnamon like suggested in other reviews and they all turned out wonderful and not too sweet.  I also made sure to roll them well in the sugar/cinnamon mixture to coat the whole cookie.  Great recipe!!

These are the best snickerdoodles I've ever had.  The only thing I did differently is that I had to stick my dough in the freezer for a little bit to firm it up.  It was too soft to roll into balls otherwise.  This may have been due to the heat- Iowa summers are HOT!  It all worked out in the end.  My boys and my nephew all enjoyed them thoroughly.  Even the mister ate a bunch- and he doesn't generally like this type of cookie.  Thanks for the recipe, Beth- this is a keeper for sure!

This was phenomenal~  The only thing that differed was I used all butter. Everything else was exact.   I used electric beaters to cream the butter & sugar then hand whisked everything else and only mixed until just mixed as to not over-mix.   I have a wonky oven and only a dark jelly roll pan so I lowered the temp and baked them for 6 minutes or so till golden on the bottoms on parchment. PERFECTION! Turned out light, fluffy, a slight crispness on the outside and moist on the inside.

I wouldn't change a thing. These turned out perfectly. My son loved them. Fast and easy to make too. I was able to make 4 dozen in 45 minutes, by putting all 4 cookie sheets in the oven on convection bake.

I made mine with turbinado sugar and Earth Balance margarine.  I grinded the sugar in the blender a bit before using it. I'm not usually a big snickerdoodle fan, but these turned out great and the family loved them.

These were great and the recipe was very forgiving. I don't cook with shortening so I used all butter. I also ran out of white sugar so made them with 1/2 white and 1/2 brown. They were then rolled in cinnamon and brown sugar. I also subbed lemon juice for the cream of tartar and had no issues with them being too flat. I baked them 400 degrees for 9 minutes and removed them asap to a rack to cool. I stored them in a zippered plastic bag and now, 4 days later, they are still as good as they were the first day. Very good cookie!

With nearly 2500 reviews, my humble opinion seems redundant, BUT I just had to put in my 2 cents! I've been making these for years now and just realized I hadn't reviewed them yet. They are PERFECTION in the form of a cookie. Absolutely, undeniably and unanimously excellent. This is one of those recipes that deserves far more than 5 stars... try these out and you will not be disappointed. Just be sure to hide a few cookies away for yourself because they don't last long!

I followed the recipe exactly, but added a bit more butter and decreased the same amount in shortening. I will use all butter next time just cuz it's healthier. It came out really good. nice and chewy. It was a big hit at the family gathering which doesnt happen often enough! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a pretty good recipe. I ended up using 2 tsp of baking powder in place of the cream of tartar because that is all I had. I am not sure if that made a difference in the final product. And I just realized that I did not even add the baking soda - oops!  My cookies came out a little crispy around the edges and nice and soft in the middle. They spread out nicely and puffed up a little. The recipe is worth making again. Be sure to not over bake these.

Awesome simple recipe.  Cut down 1/2 tsp on the cream of tartar but I think you really need to use at least some b/c that's what makes them Snickerdoodles vs. just sugar cookies.  Kept everything else the same and they came out great.  Went over big even with those who said they generally aren't 'cookie people'.

These were sooooo good. I've made other snickerdoodles before that did not have the wonderful flavor these had. I also added two small boxes of vanilla INSTANT pudding mix to the flour. They did not last long at all......They were crunchy on the edges and chewie in the middle. I also only used butter.  I made them truely unweight watchers like by turning them  over and putting a dollup of canned whipped cream on them iust before eating them. Please .. don't tell anyone about the whipped cream.. lol

Wow, what a great recipe!  These cookies are superb.  Followed recipe exactly, except used all butter (1 C.) instead of butter and shortening and baked exactly 9 min in convection oven and removed immediately to a wire rack to cool.  Also, used KitchenAxd to cream butter, sugar, vanilla and eggs (room temp).  Mixed together sep. the flour, cream of tartar, bak. soda and salt and added to wet ingred.  Also used 3 T sugar and 2 1/2 t cinnamon to coat dough balls.  Easy recipe and the kids gobbled em up and mom & I did as well!   Thank you for a great cookie recipe!

Great cookie! I think?  :) lol  I have made this cookie twice and got very different results. The first time the dough was perfect and I rolled and cooked and had a blast. The cookie was flat,not that I minded but I thought that I would try again with new baking soda. The second time I mixed my butter and applesauce in a blender and then mixed everything. The dough was very wet and sticky. The baked cookie was a little cakey for my taste as well.  I was amazed at the difference fresh baking soda can make and also how preblending some ingredients can make the difference between workable and nonworkable dough. Great cookie!! Need new chef! :)

Excellent! And, I like others, replaced the cream of tartar with baking powder.  They cracked on the top and were chewy on the inside, crunchy on the outside just like they should be!

This was the first time I ever made snickerdoodles. They were fantastic! I did them exactly as shown and they are crispy and chewy. Exactly how a snickerdoodle should be.

I think these cookies turned out better then any cookie I've made previously. The looked beautiful and didn't flatten all out like my cookies tend to. I even used margarine cause it's all I had on hand. I also didn't use cream of tarter cause I don't usually have that in the pantry, I followed others advice and just used 2 t. of vinegar instead. These are some tasty cookies!

If I could I'd give this recipe 10 stars. What an awesome cookie. I only baked them 7 minutes because I like my cookies really chewy. They turned out sooo good. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I didn't have cream of tartar and replaced it with lemon juice. This is a GREAT cookie!!!!!!

I made these with my 10 year old, and they came out perfectly.  We followed the recipe exactly, baking for just 8 minutes.  When we took them out of the oven, the dough still looked slightly wet where it had cracked, but they do keep cooking a bit once they're out of the oven. The cookies ended up bein soft, chewy and thick, just the wayI like them.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The texture was great! It was chewy in the middle and crunchy on the edges. I'd give that 5 stars. But the shortening was too much. The cinnamon was drowned out by the taste of the shortening.

Visiting daughter and didn't have my recipe with me so I went by this one which is very similar to mine.  I used 1 cup of butter because we didn't have shortening and I really like the all butter recipe better anyway. We also didn't have cream of tartar so I substituted 2 teaspoons baking powder instead of the soda and cream of tartar.  The cookies turned out great...yummy, soft, chewy...but the tops didn't crack as much as usual, so that may have been from the substitutions.  I'm telling you this so if you want to make these cookies and don't have shortening and/or cream of tartar, you can still make them!

Very soft, tasty cookies.  But next time I'll bake them only with butter or margarine as the fat, NOT shortening.  You can really taste the shortening and it leave a filmy residue on the top of your mouth.

these were very yummy. i made the recipe as is, except omitted the salt because i used salted butter (all i had). the only thing i would recommend is maybe putting the dough in the fridge or freezer for a bit before rolling. my dough was pretty soft, but the kitchen was warm so that may have been why. otherwise these were perfect. thanks for sharing this recipe!

These were delicious, and two dozen cookies disappeared within half a day. I only had butter on hand, but it worked fabulously. Next time I make these (and there's already been requests for next time), I'll probably use a teaspoon less of the cream of tartar and a teaspoon more of the baking soda for a sweeter cookie.

I made these snickerdoodles yesterday, and they were fantastic! My family and I normally don't like snickerdoodles; they are too "eggy" for our tastes.  But these were perfect. They were very soft, (and even softer the next day), and their edges are crisp. I baked my cookies for 8 minutes and they were perfect; the second batch baked at 8:30 came out with burnt bottoms.  Also, I chilled my dough in the freezer for about 10 minutes, and increased the cinnamon mixture to 3 tablespoons of sugar and three teaspoons cinnamon. I didn't use shortening; I used all butter, and had excellent results!

Using the default recipe, I made 2dozen large Snickerdoodles instead of 4doz smaller, and they turned out to be amazing!! A few guests had never had a snickerdoodle before, and said that they were now among their favorite cookies. So easy to make, I threw them together while my guests were chatting after dinner.

This is a great recipe. . . not my favorite, though, because I prefer a chewier snickerdoodle. However, if you like a soft cookie, then this recipe is for you. I think next time I will leave them in the oven longer; heeding the warnings of other reviewers, I took them out at 8 minutes, and I think they may have been a bit undercooked. That being said, my advice would be to take into account how your oven behaves and judge accordingly. For me, 9 minutes was better, and I could have left them in longer. Anyways, the cookies were delicious :)

Delicious!! I had to leave in for 10 mins when I cut back to 375 as others had suggested instead of 8 mins. But this is wonderful, my family's favorite snickerdoodle dough always had to be chilled overnight. No more waiting!!

I guess I was expecting a lot out of this cookie after reading all the great reviews. I´m making christmas cookies for a bake sale and although they taste good, they did not make the final cut. My dad liked them ok, but he agrees they´re a bit too simple.

Just a little crisp on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside.  Perfect!  They also freeze very well.  Just wrapped 2 together in Freezer Saran wrap and placed all in a freezer bag.  They tasted just as good after a few weeks in the freezer as they did fresh out of the oven.

I've made these cookies quite a few times, as they are my husband's favorite, and they've always turned out perfect. He requested them a few nights ago, and I was out of cream of tartar (which I didn't realize until after I'd started mixing things!). I searched for a substitute and ended up using 6 teaspoons of vinegar. I was extremely nervous, but I am happy to report that they came out just as amazing as usual -- with no hint of vinegar after they baked! These are a keeper, all around!!!

FANTASTIC cookie!  So easy and delicious - my 9 year old son bakes these on his own.  My co-workers begs for these around the holidays.  Thanks Mrs. Sigg!  You did it again!

I substituted olive oil for the butter b/c my hubby can't eat dairy. They were fantastic! Between my 4 boys and husband they were gone within a few hours. I will def make these again.

I didn't have any Cream of Tartar, so I followed another reviewer's advice and used 2 teaspoons of baking powder. I think they turned out great! Will be using this recipe often.

I love these cookies! They are wonderful and a lot of fun to make. I followed the advice of one of the reviews and removed my first batch right at 8 minutes...DONT do that. I couldn't get the cookies off the sheet and half turned to moosh. The time to cook them depends on the size you make them, what kind of pan your using, ect. You're better off testing the times on your own. I ended up using more sugar/cinnamon mixture than called for too. All in all they are scrumtious! I will use this recipe over and over again.

Not that you need another 5 star review, but these were terrific - Thank you!  Just what my 5 year old requested!  They stay wonderfully soft.  I made one substitution:  2tsp of baking powder for the cream of tartar.  They turned out great!

I love these. This recipe is my first attempt at baking cookies that didn't come from a pre-made log out of the grocers refrigerated case. They are easy and fantastic. I did not have baking soda so I used baking powder and nixed the cream of tartar. They came out great.

WOW! This is the first time I've ever made snickerdoodles. I have to say, I am impressed by this recipe! I was reading through the  reviews when I found the mention of exchanging lemon juice for cr. of tartar. Thanks so much for that! I also just ended up using butter (no shortening). I've eaten snickerdoodles twice before, but they were always a little crispy for my liking. These are perfect!

Almost perfect! I followed the recipe exactly, but after reading the reviews, I did do the following: I bought brand new baking soda, just to be safe (mine was in date, but had been open for quite a while). I baked for 8 minutes exactly, and I pulled the cookies off of the cookie sheet after only a minute or so to make sure they didn't overcook. The result was snickerdoodles that were still nicely chewy even after three days! Pretty much my only disappointment was that they remained puffy. I've had bakery snickerdoodles before that flatten and get the nice crackled-top look, but still stay chewy, but every recipe I've tried has only been one or the other--flat and hard or puffy and chewy. Still, these taste great, so I'm not complaining!

These were delecious!  I used whole wheat flour instead and they still came out moist and fluffy.  I did not have any cream of tartar available and was happy to see another reviewers suggestion of vinegar in lue of it.  My baking soda did not fizzle, but they still turned out.

I live with the Snickerdoodle king, and this recipe was his favorite. Thanks for bringing our quest to an end. Oh, and it doesn't matter if you use new or older baking powder as others suggested...they come out with the same puffiness. Just FYI.

These are so delicious and moist I followed the advise of some of the viewers by not cooking them too long (around 6-8 minutes or less). I also found that 400 was too high and was cooking the bottom before the center so I reduced to 350 and it was perfect. My dough was a little wet not  like pie dough were it was firm but I was able to work with it (not forming perfect ball but close and the cookies still came out perfectly round).

Fantastic! These had a great flavor too them. I went out to the store and bought fresh cream of tartar and creamed the butter and shortening and egg by hand but they still weren't as fluffy as some of the pictures. Either way, the taste was the best of all the recipes I've used. Maybe I'll add a bit of extra flour next time.

I've never made snickerdoodles before and I've never been too big a fan of them.  But this recipe was great!  They are very addictive to eat.  I need to make sure I serve them when I have a get-together or else I might eat the whole batch myself.

I just finished making these and they turned out wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly and I think the one thing I would change is that I would cook them one minute less than the recipe states. It might just be my oven, but I think they were more crispy than chewy and my hubbie said they'd be perfect if they were just a bit more chewy.

Okay these were amazing..plain and simple. I didn't change a thing, I baked them for 10 minutes and they were very soft when I took them out, almost too soft. But after cooling for a few minutes they are downright delicious. Excellent recipe!

Followed directions exactly turned out so good. Nice and chewy. A good alternative to choc. chip cookies. Mrs. Sigg also has a excellent peanut butter cookie recipe on this site. Both recipes are my permanent go to.

These cookies were fabulous!  As suggested I hand mixed the batter, and the consistency turned out great.  I also added 3 TBS of sugar and 2 1/2 tsp of cinn in a ziplock bag and tossed the balls in (one at a time) to coat, it was a lot less messy then rolling on a plate, and coated way better.  8 minutes was the max to cook for!  The cookie should be cracked but still look wet on the inside.  Let it cool for a couple minutes on the sheet before transfering to a wire rack.  Really good cookie, with a nice mellow flavor and a nice chewy texture!

These are better if you substitute 2 teaspoons baking powder for the cream of tarter.  I've made them both ways, and the cream of tarter gives them a bitter taste.

The best snickerdoodle recipe ever!  I have been making these cookies for years now.  Instead of shortening I use all butter and roll my cookies in a brown sugar/cinnamon mix rather than white sugar & cinnamon.  Do not cook longer than 8/9 minutes or they will turn hard.  Cooking time is key, take out of the oven right after the little cracks appear and they will be perfect.  Amazing cookie!!!!

Loved this recipe.  I've made it twice this week and the cookies are great!  Nice and soft in the center with just a little crispiness on the outside.  I brought them to my aunt's for a get together and everybody loved them.  In my oven 8 minutes is plenty of time so be sure to check yours on the low side of the cooking time.

I took the recommendation of someone to replace the cream of tartar with baking powder so they didn't turn out flat, and I'm glad I did. They are really good, not to sweet.

I love snickerdoodles but I was very disappointed with this recipe!  These cookies came out flat as a pancake (I even bought new baking soda and cream of tartar) and the flavor wasn't right either!  Sorry but I will NOT be making these again!

This is my first Snickerdoodle recipe I've tried, and I have to say I am quite impressed.  The cookies come out with a nice crispy exterior, but the interior is so soft and chewy - JUST how I like my cookies.  And this was done even using a microwave oven and beating everything by hand!  I made them for my girlfriend who is a Snickerdoodle connoisseur so to speak, and she absolutely loves them.  The two changes I made in how I prepared them was to use baking powder instead of soda and cream of tarter, and to squash the cookies out more into a pancake form than a ball, as when in balls they didn't spread very much and as pancakes they still rose to be nice and poofy (this could be a result of using the microwave oven).  I've made cookies after freezing the batter and after leaving it in the refrigerator (the frozen version first).  I would definitely say the flavor holds better by freezing the extra batter (wrap it up tightly in plastic wrap and then put it in a ziplock bag).

What delicious, soft, chewy cookies! I wouldn't change a thing. However, I made my cookies a little bigger, so they were very chewy, and the recipe only yielded 2 dozen instead of the said 4. Wonderful recipe, thank you!

This is a great recipe!! I changed just a few things to make sure they came out nice and chewy. I used 2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and I used 4 tsp. baking powder in place of the cream of tarter and baking soda. They turned out perfect. Beautiful to look at and yummy to eat!!

Ok i believe you now about taking them out at 8 min. Well actually mine hadn't started to "crackle" yet at 8 min so i left them in for the full 10. they looked pretty much raw in the cracks when i pulled them out but now that i'm eating them they are a little too done, so AS SOON as the start to crack take them out and leave them on the baking tray for a few minutes. Now, i had to do some substituting b/c i didn't have all the ingredients so heres what i did: was out of eggs so i used mayo instead also i don't buy cream of tarter so i did the baking powder and lemon juice substitute and they came out fine. Next time i won't cook so long.

Great recipe!  Turned out perfect - crispy & chewy.  Use 4 Tablespoons sugar and 4 teaspoons cinnamon to roll the balls of dough in.  You'll have extra cinnamon/sugar in the end but it will make rolling the balls a lot easier.  DO NOT OVER BAKE.  Take the cookies out just before you think they're done.  Then let them cool a few minutes on the cookie sheet before removing them to a cooling rack.  My cookies were just right at 8 minutes.  Caution: Don't make these cookies if you're on a diet - you won't be able to eat just one.  This recipe is a keeper!

Best snickerdoodles i've ever tasted!  I am not a huge snickerdoodle fan but these are amazing, and always come out fantastic.  I pride myself on my baking skills and even though this isn't my recipe, I would say it is certainly the best one I bake.

Thank you so much for this cookie recipe.  I made 13 dozen of these cookies and they were the hit of the Christmas cookie exchange.  Very easy to bake.  Make sure to take them out of the oven ASAP and off the pan.

These were so moist and had a nice, "snickerdoodle" flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out great. I would bake them for 9 minutes then immediately transfer them to a wire baking rack to cool. I will be coming back to this recipe next time I am craving snickerdoodles!

I followed the directions EXACTLY and even bought brand new baking soda, yet the cookies still turned out hard. I tried reducing the baking time and it didn't help. I might try making them again and reducing the oven temp, since others have had so much success with this recipe. Unfortunately, this first time I made them, I had a somewhat negative experience.

While I was making these I kept thinking about Mrs. Sigg. and how she would have loved to known my family loved these cookies too. Thanks for sharing this delightful recipe.

I have been making these cookies every year for the holidays. Now my family looks forward to them and I have even shipped these to relatives in other states. They are perfect in texture, look, taste, smell, everything.

I had never had or heard of a "Snickerdoole" until I came across this recipe.  So, not knowing what it is supposed to turn out like I have to say that this is a great recipe that produces a soft, sugary (but not too sweet) cookie.  Easy to make and a nice finished product.    Have all your ingredients at room temperature.

Good, but not very sweet.  They were very soft and somewhat lacking in flavor.

This recipe was very good. My kids loved rolling out the cookies and rolling in the sugar mixture. My Five year old daughter thought this was the best cookie ever! We'll be making these every year at Christmas time! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe for sure. Super easy to make.  Make sure that your baking soda and cream of tartar are fresh.  Old baking soda will equal flat cookies.

These cookies turnrd out wonderful, the only thing is that they did not flatten out as I thought they would, I ended up with small little mounds, but it was OK, they were delicious anyways, maybe next time I'll flatten a bit before rolling them in the sugar/cinnamon mixture.
My kids loved them.
Crunchy edges, soft chewy center, MMMMMM

Thank yoy Mrs. Sigworth for posting this recipe.

Did what other people suggested and used HALF the cream of tartar. I did need twice the amount of cinnamon and sugar to coat the cookies. I baked 8 minutes only. I did learn by trial and error NOT to bake more then once batch at a time(my first round I had to cookie sheets in the oven and the bottom ones burned while the top ones were perfect).

This was an easy recipe that yielded delicious results!  I read the reviews about an acrid taste from the cream of tartar, so I reduced it to 1 tsp.  There was no chemical taste, but the cookies also ended up crunchier than I would've liked.  I will try again with the full amount of cream of tartar and see if that makes a difference.  Regardless of the texture, the flavor of these cookies was perfect, and my apartment smelled wonderful.

Today was my first time ever making snickerdoodles, but they turned out beautifully! At 400 I baked ONLY 8 minutes and they were perfect... I have a double oven (basically just 2 ovens one atop the other) and each was at 400 so i could bake 2 pans at a time, but one pan would be burning at 6 minutes! Then it hit me - that was using a DARK PAN! Use a light colored, nonstick pan!! They'll be perfect!! And to make it even easier, skip the greasing of the pan and just use PARCHMENT PAPER! It is a lifesaver for this recipe and all other cookie recipes!

Never having a Snickerdoodle before I was uncertain but 1900 people can't be wrong so I just made two batches for a cookie swap and they are Marvelous! I took the advice and substituted 2 Teaspoons of lemon juice for the cream of tarter as I didn't have any. I also made sure the butter and eggs were room temp before using. They came out so fluffy and wonderful, I'm hooked. Thanks Beth and all the other helpful reviewers.
Keep on cooking.

Yummy cinnamon-y melt-in-your-mouth goodness! These are so delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except for I had to double the cinnamon/sugar mixture to coat the cookie balls really good before baking them. These do bake up perfectly at 8 minutes. I made these last Christmas but was probably too busy making and eating them to rate this recipe =) I can't wait to make and eat these this Christmas again!

These are pretty good. I used less crisco and more butter to bring out the flavor. Also, you'll probably get 48 cookies if you use a tablespoon, but if you're making these for Christmas cookies to gift, if you use a teaspoon and bake for 7 minutes, you'll get close to 6 dozen.

I made these for the first time a few years ago. I decided to come back and re-review! These have become a holiday staple for my family, and a much loved favorite of my coworkers and my boss, especially. I asked for time off recently and she (jokingly) told me, "Only if you make me a batch of snickerdoodles!" FABULOUS cookies.

These taste good but didnt have the "wow" factor I was expecting after reading all the reviews. I'll probably try a different snickerdoodle recipe next time. However, these were good and I wouldnt mind making them again... just nothing particularly special.

5+++ stars!
I made a few changes:

- Instead of 1/2 c shortening, use 1/4 c shortening + 3 tbsp of butter 

 -Add 1/4 tsp of baking powder 

These were the best snickerdoodles I've ever had, plus reducing the shortening made them taste less store-bought...soo good!!

Sooooo..... I had to do these in two batches because I didn't realize that I didn't have enough vanilla and soda to make a full batch.  So I started half a batch and sent my husband to the store so that I could make a second, full batch after.  That first half-batch turned out GORGEOUS, just like the pictures.  Round and puffy.  NOT FLAT!!!  I whipped up the second batch exactly the same way, as the recipe was written, and to my dismay, they turned out flat!!!  I could tell they weren't going to be the same, because the dough seemed more flimsy and sort of sticky.  I have no idea why.  Once in between bakings I tried adding a little more soda, which helped a tad, but they never got back to that original puffiness.  So frustrating!!!  But still very good.  I'll try again with some suggestions from others on the "puffy factor".  Thanks for the recipe!!

These cookies are so "perfect" (crisp on the outside, soft in the inside) that look like they come from a good bakery, but also have that heartwarming "homemade" feeling. They are easy, their ingredients are most likely already in your pantry, and they please everybody - no allergies, no personal preferences, nothing to complain! Added bonus: Your house will smell soooo good!

No tweaks to the recipe required, and boy are these good cookies! I did double the sugar/cinnamon for rolling the dough and it was just the right amount. This recipe makes a LOT of 3" cookies!

Awesome! So glad I found this here! This was the first cookie I learned to make when I was in 8th grade (A LONG time ago!) Thanks for sharing, my coworker will be thrilled tomorrow, this is her favorite! PS..I use non stick sheets, darker, so I put the oven at 395 and baked for 7:30. Yummmy!

Absolutely THE best cookie recipe I've ever tried, bar none, and I've been baking for many years.  I gave away 5 dozen for Christmas gifts this year, and received tons of compliments.  Eggs and butter brought to room temperature, wet ingredients mixed by hand with a wooden spoon.  I used 4 tbsp sugar + 1 heaped tsp cinnamon for the coating, this was perfect.

Very good cookies.  Crisp around the edges with chewy centers.  I've been looking for a good cookie recipe and I think I've found it!  I'll be making these for my Christmas cookie exchange party.

Snickerdoodles are my dad's favorite - he claims these are just like the ones his mom used to make when he was a kid. 

With the exception of using all butter instead of a butter and shortening mix, I didn't change a thing. 

Fabulous recipe!

These cookies are supurb! I make them at least once a year around Christmas. I've never had a problem with mine flattening out. They always turn out great!

This recipe does take quite a bit of time, but it's well worth it! Yummy!!

Delicious cookies! This was the first time I've ever made snickerdoodle cookies and everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly except that I doubled the sugar and cinnamon for rolling. Thanks Beth!

These are wonderful and moist!  Just be careful not to over-bake.  I usually under-bake.  After the cookies cool they can be safely moved without falling apart.

Amazingly.Delicious.Cookies. Easy to prepare, my 4 year old helped me. I made them to send to my nephew at college, and now I am going to have to make another batch b/c the ones I made him are almost gone.

Good consistency, but they tasted more like a sugar cookie rolled in cinnamon-sugar.  I think they could be improved by adding cinnamon to the dough, as well.

One reviewer recommended baking these no longer than eight minutes. My suggestion is test one batch, then decide. I baked an entire batch at eight minutes -- they were OK, but a little pale and not crisp. But the last batch (wouldn't you know it!) that got left in an extra minute turned out perfect -- lightly brown and crisp on the edges. I'll bake my next batch at nine minutes.

I tried making these... it tasted allright. but my cookies were sooo cakey and very puffy. I wanted more of the flat, chewy consistency. I had replaced the shortening with more butter.

These smelled heavenly as they were baking and tasted even better!  I doubled the cinnamon sugar to roll the balls of dough in, thinking there wouldn't be enough, and I ended up wasting a lot.  Guess I'll trust the recipe next time!

According to my 10 year old who made these virtually unassisted they are "A burst of flavor sensation".  I think that translates as they are very good.  I highly recommend doubling the recipe because we only got 3 dozen.  We used the medium size Pampered Chef scoop.
Make these and you won't be disappointed

I made some changes to this recipe and they were absolutely delicious! CHANGES: 3 cups flour, 1 tsp. cream of tarter & 1 tsp. baking powder, ALL shortening (butter flavored crisco) because I didn't have any butter, and I baked them for 8 minutes at 375. The shortening worked wonderfully and also made it so the dough was more manageable since it is somewhat more solid than butter at room temp. Not sticky at all! Soft, pillowy cookies that  my husband and I became instantly addicted to. If you like a slightly crispy on the outside snickerdoodle, then slightly press on the rounded balls before baking them. A flatter cookie will have a crisping effect (in this case anyway!). Enjoy :)

Not a big fan of snickerdoodles, but made these for my daughters boyfriend. They were incredibly easy to make. I followed what other reviewers said and stuck to baking them for 8 minutes. The didnt look done, but they turned out great. Very soft and chewy, lightly crisp around the edges. Will definitely be making these again!

Eight minutes to perfection!  An absolutely delicious snickerdoodle.  We used way more sugar/cinnamon than the recipe called for to roll the cookies (my kids didn't think measuring it was necessary!), and ended up with a wonderfully crisp layer of sugar/cinnamon on the bottom of our cookies.  This will definitely be a cookie jar staple.

Great cookie recipe.  I used two different cookie sheets while baking (my stone and a metal pan).  The cookies on the baking stone turned out a little flatter, but were much more moist and chewy compared to those baked on the metal sheet.  Hubby said they were perfect!

Scrumptious Cookies!! We needed a cookie fix, so I went in search of new recipes, and came across this one. With such great reviews, I just couldn't pass it up. So glad I made them..they are perfect. I'll definitely be making again. Thanks for sharing!

These are absolutely heavenly!! If I could give this recipe 100 stars, I most certainly would. These are by far better than store bought. Update: I had some pecan butter cream frosting left over from a birthday cake, so I decided to spread some on these snickerdoodles. OMG, I can't stop eating them!
Sure is a great way to use up left-over frosting.

These were great. I do like my snickerdoodles chewy in the middle, so I used all butter instead of the shortening (as per another review) and they were perfect. Definitely the best snickerdoodle recipe I've tried!

These cookies are just about perfect--I would only suggest one minor alteration.  I added a bag of cinnamon chips to the dough before rolling out the cookies, and this made them even more perfect by adding an extra touch of spice.  I definitely agree with the other reviewers about cooking time--do not leave them in the oven any longer than eight minutes, even if they don't look quite done.  They set up quite nicely once you take them out and put them on racks.

Yum, Yum, Super Yum!  These were amazing.  Make exactly according to recipe, and baked for 8 minutes, let rest to flatten slightly.  Moist, chewy, and delish!  Thank you!

These cookies are great!  I used 3 Tablespoons of sugar to 3 teaspoons of cinnamon that I mixed in a ziploc bag. As others suggested I put the cookies in the bag and shook in order to coat them.  I only cooked them 8 minutes and they come out soft and oh so good.

Best snickerdoodles I've ever made and I've been making them for years.  This recipe will now be the only one I use to make them.  You will need a little more of the cinnamon/sugar mixture as the others have pointed out.  Other than that, the recipe needs no adjustments.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Super yummy. I put my bowl in the fridge between batches so they would roll into balls better. Mine were a little flat and I used a brand new box of baking soda. I might have overmixed the butter. Will make again.

So many people had something great to say about these cookies, so I gave them a shot. However, the result left me a little disappointed. The cookies were a little too cakey and puffy for me, perhaps more butter and less shortening would be better. Even then, the cookies had this weird aftertaste that no one in my family except me could taste! At first I thought I was going crazy or something, but then my friend noticed the same thing when he tried some. They were okay cookies, but I will probably not make them again.

These are great!I didn't have any butter so i used all Crisco, and i only baked for 8min and then put on cooling rack, came out perfect, soft and chewy in the middle. I also only used 3T of sugar and only 3tsp of cinnamon.

These are pretty good, but I think there may be too much cream of tartar.  I noticed an aftertaste.  Besides that, though, they were good.  I used all butter and part whole wheat pastry flour.  I got exactly 3 dozen out of the recipe.  I took reviewer's advice and used 3 tsp. sugar and 3 TBS cinnamon, but I had some leftover so I'm not sure I needed that much. ***** Tried these the day after baking and can't taste the cream of tartar anymore!  They are 5 star now.  ;)

Absolutely a favorite at home, work and with the neighbors!  I mix the dry and wet ingredients separately.  Cream together the wet ingredients with the mixer and mix in the dry ingredients with a wooden spoon.  With my oven, I set it at 380 degrees and bake for 8 minutes, then I let the cookies rest for 1-2 minutes on the sheet and then transfer to the cooling rack.

Made them for superbowl sunday.  Not one cookie was left.  I had to promise one person that I would make them for his birthday.
I substituted cream of tartar for equal parts white vinegar.  Also I didn't have shortening so I used equal parts butter.

YUMMY

For a soft, lower fat version, I replace the shortening with applesauce.  The dough ends up a little more sticky, but the cookies are great!

Just as most everyone else says, DELICIOUS!  Great Snickerdoodle.  Gotta love Mrs. Sigg!  Thanks.  I'd lost my original Snickerdoodle recipe and this one is great.   Do 8 minutes exactly.

These cookies are great. The little hands that helped make them threw the portions off a little but they still turned out perfect. Everyone raved!

A little note the cookies we baked on our stone took about 9 min and stayed on the stone another 2 out of the oven to get crispy like the 8 min cookie sheet batches. still wonderful!

I can't believe it's taken me this long to rate this recipe. I used to be a chocolate chip cookie kind of girl, but after making these once, I will never invest effort into making cookies unless they are snickerdoodles. 
Some hints: 
It's a lot easier to put the cinnamon and sugar coat into a ziplock bag and just shake the snickerdoodles in them... that way you can coat them thoroughly with ease. 
For all of those who say these have an aftertaste: you are not coating them properly. That aftertaste is the cinnamon. Solved by the ziplock method mentioned above, and make sure it's coated well.

Used all butter and they worked out well.  This is a recipe that I use often as it is easy and the end results are consistently good.

I love cinnamon, so when I saw this recipe had been rated so many times I had to give it a try.  I've had snickerdoodles before but never made them myself so I have no other recipes to compare this one to, but they were really good.  After experimenting with the baking time I realized one minute more or less can make a big difference.  When making the cinnamon sugar mixture I thought the ration of cinnamon to sugar looked a bit much, so I left the cinnamon amount the same and added 2 Tbsp more of sugar.  I think still more sugar would have been good.  I used my Kitchenaide mixer on these cookies and they were great, not overmixed whatsoever.  They didn't look quite as crackly as the allrecipes photo, but they were still beautiful.

I was hoping to find the perfect snickerdoodle recipe and this was it! Make sure to refrigerate the dough before you plan to bake the cookies.  It makes it much easier to roll the dough into perfect balls and the ideal snickerdoodle shape!

I feel like my review does not count for much since there is already over a thousand reviews!!!!  But I pretty much echo what y'all have said.  This is the best snickerdoodle recipe ever.  I bake about 5 times a week, every week, every month, every year.  I collect recipes like crazy and put all of my favorites into a "special" folder.  This is definitely one of my favorites.  It's what a true snickerdoodle is supposed to be.  Crispy on the outside edges, slightly chewy on the inside, not real puffy with a wonderful flavor.  I do add a bit more sugar to my rolling bowl but besides that I follow the recipe to a T.  In fact, I add some sparkly sanding sugar to the rolling sugar and it adds a small sparkle.  Gosh, these are tasty.  I just now made a triple recipe and I guarantee you they will disappear quickly.  I highly recommend this recipe as your standard snickerdoodle recipe.

Easy and great flavor. I made them into bars by spreading in 13X9 pan and baking at 350 for 25 minutes because I do not have the time or patience anymore to make cookies! I sprinkled the cinnamon sugar mixture on top. They turned out great.

these were really good, but I had a real hard time not burning the bottom.  You really have to watch them and even though they seem like they are extremely soft and not done, they probably are.  They tend to harden quite a bit when they cool.  Even though the bottom looked burnt people still ate them, b/c they liked them so much.

Well, I personally love these cookies.  And it's just a bonus that my husband and our friends frequently request them.  Easy to make.  I bake for 8.5 minutes exactly and they're perfect everytime.

I love this recipe!! These Snickerdoodles turn out great.  I took the advice of other reviews and increased the amount of sugar to 3 TBS and cinnamon to 3 tsp.  I also, mixed that in a bag and dropped the dough balls in one by one for a much less messy way of coating them.

These were good.  Although next time I might use more butter and less shortening.  They had a strong flavor of shortening that I particularly don't care for.  I followed some suggestions from prior reviews, I decreased the oven temp just a tad and baked for exactly 8 minutes, cooled for 1 minute on baking sheet then placed on wire racks to cool completely.  They were slightly crisp on the outside and soft inside.  I also upped the cinnamon/sugar mix and dumped it all into a plastic baggie and coated the dough that way.  To someone who said you must mix by hand... I used my Kitchenaid stand mixer and the cookies turned out fine.  Overall, a nice recipe, Thanks!

Good recipe I use it all the time.  I use all butter instead shortening.  I have just always liked that better.  I also chill the batter.  I makes the rolling of the cookies easier.  I roll all the cookies first so that the batter doesn't have time to warm up again.  It makes for a sticky mess.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.

The taste is amazing, but for some reason my results are inconsistent with this one and I don't know why.  The first time I made these they were flawless; I was looking forward to making them again, but when I did they just wouldn't spread!  I used the fork method to press them.  They were still delicious, though.  Be very careful with the cooking time!  A few minutes is all the difference between a yummy, chewy snickerdoodle and one that is rock-hard with burnt cinnamon!  Watch them carefully.

I cannot even describe how good these are. Make sure you mix by hand. No stand mixers or they will come out flat. Also make sure you cook at 390 and for 8 minutes. No more, no less.

These cookies are the best.  I have always wanted to find a snickerdoodle recipe ever since I bought snickerdoodles from the amish in Shipshewana, IN.  I was hoping they were just as good and sure enough they are delicious.  Since I made them for Christmas, I decided to put some red and green sugar crystals with the cinnamon and sugar to give it a festive look.

This version of snickerdoodles are delicious. The only thing I changed was the oven tempature, because my oven gets very hot and you have to adjust it accordingly. This is truly a delicious cookie, and I highly recommend anyone who truly loves snickerdoodles to give it a try you will not be disapointed.

This was AMAZING!!!  I made these cookies for a cookie swap at work and they were a hit!  I use a clay baking stone and always have to adjust times and temps.  I baked at 350 deg. for 10 min. and they were perfect.  Thank you Mrs. Sigg!!!

These are very good cookies. I chilled the dough before I rolled them into balls, and I used 3 tablespoons sugar and 3 teaspoons cinnamon (mixed in bag). I baked them at 375 for 5 1/2 minutes and they came out perfect.

I have never really loved snickerdoodles, but I now change my mind.  These cookies were so easy to make and they are better than my favorite sugar cookies.  I baked them exactly 8 minutes and mixed them by hand.  Snickerdoodles cannot get any better than these!

These were just ok for me.  I guess I'm just not a fan of Snickerdoodles.

Great snickerdoodle recipe!  Followed it exactly, aside from the shortening. I used butter flavored shortening.  I used a deep dish bowl to roll the cookie dough in, rather than the plastic bag technique.  Wasn't messy at all.  Had my lovely 8 yr old niece help me.  Very tasty!  My hubby liked this cookie as well, and that's enough for me to rate this a 5-star!

Great cookie.....Used electric mixer, hand mixing for these just creates more work, as it doesnt change the cookie. Shook balls in bag with sugar/cinn. Baked for 8 min's flat, then took out of oven and let them cool on baking sheet. I dont bake with crm of tartar, used white vinegar in its place & you then dont get that metallic/acrid taste from crm of tartar!

This made very attractive classically "cracked" snickerdoodles but were not chewy and turned out too cake-like in the middle of the cookie for my taste. I took the advice of other reviewers and creamed the butter and sugar by hand. It probably made a difference in the appearance (didn't flatten out during baking) but may have kept them from being chewy since the electric mixer would have probably creamed the mixture better than I did. Next time I would go ahead and use the mixer just to cream the butter and sugar and let the dough rest overnight.

These were delicious, especially after they were completely cooled.  I used a hand mixer and replaced the baking soda and cream of tartar with 4tsp of baking powder.  The first  batch I didn't flatten and they were very domed and a little raw in the middle.  The second batch I flattened and indented the middles so they would rise evenly, worked like a charm.  I ended up with 26 cookies.

Just like I remember! My best friend gave me a recipe for these, but I lost it. I tried this one and it is perfect. 

I like to make them silver-dollar-sized so I needed one more Tblsp of sugar and tsp of cinnamon for the coating than called for in the recipe.

Regardless of which recipe I use, they don't want to crack properly for me, though.

Tip - for Christmas this year I added a little red and green colored sugar to the cinnamon-sugar coating. It looks great!

My first time baking these traditional favorites was a success. I can't find shortening in Finland (is there a substitute?), so I used a whole cup of butter instead. I also substituted vinegar for the cream of tartar (also cannot find in supermarkets here). Otherwise, the suggestions of using a bag to shake the dough balls in and using exactly 8 minutes in the oven were perfect. They may not LOOK done, but if you want them to be slightly chewy on the inside, take them out despite that they aren't browned. Trust me.

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I used light butter instead of margarine.  I don't know if my butter was too soft, or if I stirred the ingredients a bit too much (and my daughter, who helped me and insisted on sirring a lot) but the batter was too thin and gooey to be rolled into balls.  So, I plopped the batter by the spponful onto the cookies sheets and sprinkled with the sugar & cinnamon mixture.  The flavor, taste, and texture is still delicious, but it is surely not how I expected it to be, especially after seeing the photos here, and also knowing what snickerdoodles should look and taste like.  I will save this recipe and try again, maybe using margarine, or regular butter, and not letting the butter soften as much, and also not stirring so briskly. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these for a study session and they got rave reviews. I found they were best eaten warm the day of. The next day they were very hard. I've never made my own snickerdoodles before this recipe, so I don't know if they are meant to be hard. Other than that, they were great.

The reviews are right this is really great snickerdoodle recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, but on half I put cardamom and sugar in place of the cinnamon and sugar mixture.  Not as good, but an interesting change.

Followed the instructions exactly, except that I did all 'butter flavored shortening' rather than half butter half shortening.  

Everything worked out well, until I was ready to roll the dough into balls.  It was crazy dry and crumbly!  It wasn't like dough at all, just a bunch of wet crumbs.  I had to add a couple of splashes of milk to make it stick together at all.  Was this because of my shortening substitution?  I don't know.  They turned out well in the end.  Yay.

Having never eaten, let alone baked, snickerdoodles, I am very happy with hos this recipe turned out.  I bake with butter-flavored shortening, no matter the ingredients called for, and decided to stick with that instead of the butter & shortening prescribed.  It worked beautifully.  The only adjustment I'll make next time is in the cinnamon-sugar coating.  I'll use raw sugar instead of regular white sugar to add some texture and I'll decrease the amount of cinnamon as I thought these were a bit heavy.  But totally great otherwise.

My husband isn't a cookie person and he went back three times for more.  This recipe has earned a spot in my recipe box.

These turned out fine, but I don't think they were any better than any other snickerdoodles I've ever made.  From the reviews I expected something phenomonal and these were just regular old snickerdoodles.  Sorry...maybe I just set my expectations to high!

I wish I had read the reviews.  They are very sticky, even after chilling for over an hour.  Then, they spread flat and were very tough and chewy.  I too, wish I had not wasted my ingredients or my time.

This recipe definitely deserves a five star rating! This is the second time I've ever made snickerdoodles, and they turned out absolutely perfect- soft in the middle and just slightly crispy on the outside. I have already eaten too many and I just finished about 10 minutes ago! Beware, they are addictive in the best way!

OOOps!  I forgot baking soda!  These turned out great without it... I think.  The family loved them anyways.  I increased the cinnamon/sugar mixture to 3 and the 8 minute rule worked great here.  My cookies were puffy too!  Next time I will remember the baking soda though!

They taste great! The only problem I had is that I didn't know they would turn out so big, and they stuck together on the cookie sheet. But other than that, they're wonderful!!

These were simple and delicious.  I used a little more sugar and cinnamon to shake them in a ziploc bag.  I used a cookie scoop and simply dropped into the bag, let my 3-year-old shake, and placed them on my cookie sheet with Reynold's Release Foil - this has been a miracle for my cookies.  I did cut the cooking time down to 7 minutes because I like it a little chewey in the middle.  They looked great too!

Brought 48 of these to work today and came home with empty tupperware and requests for more! Came out fantastic! I did only cook for between 6-7 minutes, otherwise they dried out in my oven and became tough, other than that follow the recipe to a t! Thank you!

I love snickerdoodles and haven't been able to find a really good recipe for a while. But these are to die for! I brought them into work one day and haven't stopped getting requests for them since! I didn't have cream of tartar so I replaced it and the baking soda with 4 teaspoons of baking powder and they were great! I'm making more tonight!

all I have to say is: 
make sure you WATCH the cookies starting at about 6 minutes and keep checking until done because mine were burnt on the bottom after 8... :(

This is a GREAT recipe for snickerdoodles and it scales down very nicely.  The only thing I would suggest is not to completely roll them in the cinnamon sugar because the sugar on the bottom of the cookie will burn a bit while cooking, making the bottoms of the cookies tougher.. so next time, I would dip the cookie dough balls into the cinnamon sugar, just being careful not to coat the bottoms.  
Also, you gotta pull them out and place them on a cooling rack as soon as they come out for nice and soft cookies.

Best snickerdoodles ever.  I made the cookies twice as big as stated in the recipe, and baked an extra 2-3 minutes.  They are wonderful, and look perfect.

Followed directions exactly, and they came out perfect! Made them for a housewarming party, and I had people arguing over who would take home the extras - and it turned out they all got eaten anyhow! Great recipe!

Just make sure you give them enough space to bake, because they really do spread out.

Terrific!  Could not find or remember my old snickerdoodle recipe and this one hit the spot!  The only thing we did differently (my 13 year old made them) is chilled the dough for at least an hour before handling (that I did remember).  Makes it easier to roll in to balls then coat with the cinnamon sugar.  We also used butter flavored Crisco instead of shortening & butter.  Yummo!

I wasn't all that crazy about these and I LOVE to bake and eat cookies..they didn't seem to flatten out as much as I would have liked and i didn't care much for the cinn/sugar coating (too much cinnamon)  Followed recipe as written and baked for 8 minutes only.  Perhaps I was misled by all the 5 star reviews.  With my subsequent batches I rolled them but then flattened with a sugar coated fork (like PB cookies) They tasted a little better to me this way and was great for my son who has a peanut allergy-looked just like a PB cookie, so not a total write off I guess :)

These tast awesome - hubby would have eaten the uncooked dough.  Mine were a little dry and I had a hard time keeping it together but they still came out pretty good, we like ours soft so the 8 minutes was enough.

I didn't realize that I was out of shortening so I had to use all butter.  These were so good I don't know if I'll try the shortening or not the next time.  These are the best I've ever had.

I made this recipe as written, and the cookies turned out great! I made the dough the night before and refrigerated it overnight, which made it easier to roll into balls. I did have to flatten the balls during cooking so I didn't end up with a round cookie, though! They were gone quickly- my roommates loved them!

I am known as the Snickerdoodle Queen and it is thanks to this recipe!  Tip: If batter is too sticky to work with, just pop it in the fridge till it is easier to handle.  Thanks Mrs. Sigg!

Really ecellent cookie.  Dough was perfect to work with and whole process was very very quick.  
I also added some cinnamon to the dough whikle mixing.  I added more cinnamon than called for in the sugar/cinnamon mix and they turned out great.  
I was hesitant to make these as I thought they would get hard upon cooling, but mine stayed soft and really chewy! Will definitely make again!

I had never made snickerdoodles before I tried this recipe and they turned out perfect. Crisp edges with chewy centers. A very flavorful change from my usual chocolate chip.

I first made these snickerdoodle's with my best friend, who's been using the recipe for a while. I'm so glad she shared it with me because it's really fabulous! My husband, friends, and coworkers all rave about these cookies! They end up crispy around the edges and softer in the middle, which is exactly how I like them.

These cookies are delicious! Just as they are described - crispy outside, soft & chewy inside. Mmmmm! I agree with other reviewers to use 3 TBS sugar to 2 tsp cinnamon. Baking them 9-10 minutes in my oven worked the best (8 minutes came out a little undercooked). This recipe is a definite keeper!

They taste great. The first batch I used a glass to press down but they came out really flat. So I would suggust just leaving them as balls. Also I would double the sugar and cinnamon mixture. I ate five right out of the oven, yummy.

Delicious!  Everyone loved them!  I used a fork and gently pressed down on the balls before baking for a more elegant look.  They were a bit to crunchy for my taste so I just put a piece of bread in with the cookies and it softens them right up!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Absolutely fantasmic! Almost a fool proof recipe! Listen to what many other reviewers say and take the cookies out at 8 mins, especially if you are looking for that crispy outside, soft inside texture. This recipe is definitely worth trying out at least once!

A wonderful recipe. I only made half of the proportion and cut down the sugar as well. I had my mom roll the cookie ball on cinnamon sugar, she loves the smell. 
The house smells so good while baking, and the cookies, they are as good as they smell like.

12/20/2006: Snickerdoodles are just about the only cookie that my Uncle David likes. He LOVED these and asked if I would make a batch for him as a Christmas gift! You may need to adjust the amount of time these spend in the oven. I had to bake mine just a little bit longer to get them "just right".

UPDATE 12/17/2015: I've been making these 9 years and they never fail. Tonight I checked them at *exactly* 8 minutes and they were perfect.

This recipe was the closest match to the hand-written one in my late mom's recipe file, but hers didn't say what kind or how much flavoring.  These came out great!  8 minutes was perfect - I did two baking sheets at once, moving from bottom to top at 4 minutes.

My friend described the taste as: fluffy cookie dough with a crisp touch of sugar cinnamon, and she was bang on!! When you taste raw chocolate chip cookie dough, it tastes different than the actual baked cookie..But this cookie has basically a pure cookie dough taste in its baked form.  A very simply and light not overly sweet cookie. Make sure you keep an eye on them while baking. I baked a batch for 9 minutes and the bottoms burnt so fast! Next tray I baked for 8 minutes and they were perfect. My cookies, however, did not have that cracked looking top that many of the submitted recipe photes have. My cookies were farely smooth looking but still had that crisp outside texture. I followed the recipe exactly too. I might try chilling the dough next time as some users suggested

These cookies are good.  I would suggest making well rounded teaspoon full size or even tablespoon size because I thought the "spoonful" meant teaspoon size and the cookies were barely bite size.
Can't understand the problem folks had with the cream of tartar -ever recipe I've ever made for Snickerdoodles calls for cream of tartar.
I only gave this recipe four stars because although I thought the cookies were tasty it's not my favorite recipe.  IMHO, the recipe in the Better Homes & Gardens cook book is my long time favorite.

Soooo light and tasty! We used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar, 1 cup butter, and 1/2 tsp baking powder since that's what we had, and they turned out great!! Highly recommended recipe!

This recipe is FABULOUS.  I have used it for years and it is a verifiable crowd pleaser.  I really enjoy making and sharing them.  One suggestion is to chill the dough overnight.  This allows bettering rolling and cinna-sugar coating.  Thanks!

The flavor of these cookies is GREAT. The reason I gave it four stars is because my cookies were completely flat and a little rubbery after a day in an air-tight container. I like my snickerdoodles puffy and light. Other than that, a very good recipe!

I liked the flavor of this cookie a lot, but let me give you some background.  I cannot cook cookies.  I have no idea why, but I can never get any cookie to turn out the way it should.  And this recipe, once again proved I have no business baking cookies.  The dough was way too sticky to roll into a ball.  I followed the directions exactly and they ended up being paper thin.  The flavor is great, but they are too greezy, and buttery.  I doubt I will make these again.  I'm doubting if I will ever make any cookie again.  But if you want carmel pecan yeast cinnamon rolls, or a 4 tier wedding cake, I can make those, no problem at all!  HA!

My husband and I liked thses cookies, very good flavor. I must have overcooked them because they weren't soft at all once they cooled. Still, they tasted great, and the leftovers that I brought to work disappeared quickly!

I followed the recipe except for the fact that I used all butter instead of shortening. I creamed the butter and sugar by machine as a busy mum I could not be bothered to do it by hand. I folded the flour in. The dough tasted fine uncooked and I just pinched off pieces and rolled with fingertips into balls, put them in a plastic bag with cinnamon/sugar mix and shook it around. My oven cooked these at 11 mins, because at 8 the centers were still wet. The reason this has four stars is because now that the cookies are cool, there is an overwhelming eggy taste to the cookies. You know when you can really taste egg? I don't know why this is so because 2 eggs are not really an excess amount of egg. Next time, I would use 1 egg and sub with 1 teaspoon of egg substitute powder. I lifted the cookie sheets straight out of the tray to cool instead of trying to lift them with a spatula. I will make these again and play with the recipe, maybe add some orange peel or something and less real egg.

These cookies were awesome.  I have been looking for a good snickerdoodle recipe for some time and this is exactly what I have been looking for.  My only suggestion is to bake at 350 rather than 400 degrees.  Maybe it was my oven, but my first tray burned.

This recipe is great!! But if you like butter toffee, I suggest adding 3/4 of a bag of HEATH BITS and an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract. All I can say is YUM!

This recipe is great, the only thing that I substituded was the shortening, I added 1/2 cup more butter, so the total amount of butter the recipe contained was 1 cup of butter, no shortening. That was perfect, the soft and moist cookie with the outer part nice and crispy. Delicious!!!

so easy to make and delicious to boot--crispy edges and chewy soft middle.  I baked them at 375 for 9 minutes and let them cool on the sheet for 1 min and pulled them off to cool completely.

Delicious cookies!!! I did find out the hard way about the debate of cooking time.  My first batch I cooked for 8 mins then immediately put on wire rack to cool. They did not look cooked enough. I ate one soon after.  The cookie was as I thought, not cooked enough in middle.  The next 3 batches I cooked 9 mins.  This was a mistake: THESE COOKIES FIRM ALL THE WAY THROUGH WHEN THEY ARE THOROUGHLY COOL. I don't have enough cookie baking experience to know if all cookies firm like this when cool. But my 8 min batch is the yummy crispy on outside, chewy on inside cookie.  The 9 min batch is still tasty, yet drier on the inside.

These were great, however, there was a coppery taste to them. I think it may have been the cream of tartar? That kind of ruined it for me. They were great up until that aftertaste.

This is a great recipe!  I made them for my sister's birthday and they were a hit.  They rivel the gourmet snickerdoodles I have tasted.  I made only one modification.  Instead of using butter and shortening, I used just one cup of butter.  We do not like the taste of shortening.  Kept the cooking time to 8 minutes.

I made this recipe without using butter and replaced it with natural without transfat margarine because my daughter is super allergic to dairy. I also used transfat free shortening by crisco, and it still turned out yummy: chewy and crispy. I think the key is the shortening. Also, I added about 1/4 cup less of sugar. The recipe I did was 48 cookies, but I was only able to get only 2 dozen out of it, not sure if it was because I took some sugar out, and changed the butter out, but I didn't think it would make that much of a difference! In any case, great recipe! I am always trying to change it up to cut the dairy out, and so far, every receipe I tried including this one on this site has all worked nicely.

These got way too crispy for me...I made a huge batch, and each time, I decreased the cooking time and they were still too hard. I agree with the review that says there is a bitter aftertaste. I even decreased the cream of tartar! My fiance ate them, but I had a few and gave up on them...will not make this one again...

My mother-in-law gave me her family recipe for snickerdooles.  I went online to compare with other recipes and it was this exact recipe! There are sooooo good.  8 mins is the magic number to bake them.  They are by far the best cookie i've made.  maybe my mother-in-law does know a thing or to.

This recipe is fairly idiot-proof (yet I managed to mess it up by using baking powder instead of baking soda. Oops... it still turned out delicious though.) While not nearly as flat/crackly as I would have liked... that was probably my mistake. 9 minutes came out to the perfect cookie. They seem a little undercooked right out of the oven but get a good deal crispier as they cool. Like other reviews said, I would use equal parts sugar and cinnamon to roll the dough in. We only rolled the tops and sides, not the bottom and it turned out fine. Great cookies that were eaten up in a day! Everything you would want in a snickerdoodle.

The taste is wonderful, although baking the cookies at 400 degrees always burns the bottoms of my cookies. I think it might just be me oven!
Also, the diections are misleading. I've found that if I roll the cookies in the cinnamon and sugar mixture and bake them, the cookies bun on the bottoms. Instead I only roll the tops of the balls of dough in the mixture.
Otherwise, my favorite Snickerdoodle recipe so far!

I love these cookies!  I make them small and munchable. The only thing I add is fresh grated nutmeg to the cinn and sugar mix. There is a woman at work who actually requests that I make them, as they are her fav.  They never last more than a couple hours at work.  This is my only snickerdoodle recipe.

These cookies are the only cookies I've ever had that taste really not so good fresh out of the oven but are fabulous after a day in tupperware!  So I give them a 4/5 because of the lack of taste on baking day.  After they cool, though, YUM!  I followed exactly except for adding more sugar/cinnamon than called for.  I rolled them until fully coated!

These weren't bad, but i must admit that i had gotten my hopes up and was dissapointed. They turned out verrry thin and flat and the flavor was just ok for me. My family said that they were good but only after i asked what they thought.

Use Vietnamese cinnamon if you can find it--sooooooooo good!!  I left some of these at my old place of work, and one of the new workers tracked me down to get this recipe.  Oh, and there's nothin like snickerdoodles to make your whole house smell yum!

This was my first time making biscuits and I didn’t even know what to expect but I definitely expected more. I found the biscuits very boring and tasteless. On the other hand, my two housemates ate the whole butch and kept on telling me how much they liked 'the little cinnamon things'. Boys…

These are great!  I have been using a recipe for these that is almost exactly the same but it uses all crisco instead of half crisco half butter.  They are really good either way, but I think the dough is a little easier to work with using this one.  I baked these for 7 min in my oven and I got 42 cookies, plus I ate some dough :).  Don't overbake snickerdoodles, or they'll be great right out of the oven, but hard as a rock when they cool.

I've made this recipe several times now and it is perfect. On occasion I've replaced the shortening with butter and it works just fine if you don't have any on hand. This is the key, do not over cook them or they will turn out hard! When you take them out of the oven they should look a little underdone but they will firm up as they cool.

I'm in UK so because we dont have these here I didnt know what to expect but saw the reviews and figured I had to try them and I'm sooooooo glad I did...some food just makes you wanna do the "Ooohhh this tastes good" dance and this is definetely one of them.  I've had bad experience with cream of tartar before so followed advice of others and used lemon juice instead.  I halved the recipe because I didnt have enough sugar.....boy do I wish I had more sugar!!!

I've made these twice in the last couple of weeks and both times they came out wonderfully. I used lemon juice in place of the cream of tartar as someone else suggested and really like it that way. (No metalic aftertaste!)They stay soft for days and all our friends that have tried them loved them.

Wonderful recipe.  This is my very favorite snickerdoodle recipe.  I don't use any other because this cookie has the best flavor.  A word of caution: do not overcook.  The cookies can go from being deliciously soft and almost chewy to being hard as a rock in just a short while if you don't watch them carefully.  This recipe, however, is amazing.

8 minutes baking time was perfect. The dough is very soft, so i used a tablespoon to scoop out even amounts, i turned the "scoop" upside down into the cinnamon sugar mix and then scoop the cookie dough out of that tablespoon with a regular spoon so that the cinnamon sugar mix would stay on top. It was really easy and they all came out about the same size.

These are awesome!!! If you don't have shortening and substitute all butter - they taste fantastic, but tend to get a little crisper.  If you go all shortening and margerine, they don't spread.  I find that Beth has found a good proportion of shortening/butter for these cookies!

It might just be that we are not snicker doodle people, but this would not be a first choice cookie recipe for me to make again.  For those who want to try this recipe, I can tell you that a minute does make a difference!  At least in my oven.  I baked two batches - one at 8 minutes and one at 9 minutes exactly.  The 8 minute cookies had a chewier center (which I preferred) and the 9 minute cookies had a crispier center (which my husband preferred). Oh well...you five star people probably know how to bake them better than I do.

These were good, but they seemed like they were "missing" something. I liked the chewy centers but once you passed the cinnamon/sugar coating, the centers were bland. I might try adding some cinnamon in the dough mixture next time or maybe more vanilla? This cookie recipe has potential; just needs something else.

Mrs. Sigg knows what she's doing. That was the best homemade snickerdoodle I've had. Bake for exactly 8 min. Put them on a wire rack right away, dont leave them on the baking sheet. And remember to coat them well with cinn and sugar. Perfection!

My 5 year old is allergic to eggs and dairy so I wasn't sure how this recipe would turn out using Egg Replacer.  To my surprise they turned out beautifully.  I halved the recipe substituting one stick of soy margarine for the 1/4 c. of butter and shortening and I was able to make 15 nice size cookies.  My son couldn't wait long enough for the cookies to cool and ate 3 right away!  He, along with my husband who is not a heavy sweet eater, loved them and I will be making more tonight.  Thank you for a great recipe that I will be making over and over again!

I just got a new kitchen aide stand mixer and I was dying to make as much as possible for christmas, my son came homw from school and said "I had some good cookies today, I wish you would make me some", so of course I said what were they and he said "snickerdoodles", well I have never been a fan of those cookies but I thought if I could find a good recipe, then this web site is the place to find it. Well everyone in my family loved it, we stayed with family for the holiday and everyone ate them in two days. Thank You so much for the recipe (oh and my son loved them too)

These are awesome! I used a small disher then dropped the dough directly in a bowl with cinnamon and sugar (way more than the recipe calls for) and rolled the balls around a few at a time. I would definitely reccomend this method since you don't have to get your hands sticky and the cookies are always the exact same time. I went the max cook time, they were kind of gross in the middle if it went below that.

My 7 year old wanted to make some snickerdoodles because he likes grandma's snickerdoodles so much.  I let him do all the measuring and put all the ingredients in the mixing bowl.  I formed the balls and he rolled them in the cinnamon sugar and put them on the baking sheet.  We didn't modify the recipe at all and they came out of the oven tasting delicious.  No cream of tarter bitterness as some others have reported.  Perhaps better ingredients yield better results, but this recipe makes an excellent snickerdoodle.

Great flavor, but I like a chewier cookie.  They came out a little too crispy for my taste.  I even made sure I did not overbake them.  Maybe I should have underbaked them a little.  But the recipe is good, no doubt.

This is my favorite cookie recipe. Very easy to make. 
I did find that an Airbake cookie sheet works best for this, it keeps the bottoms from getting too brown.

I am ambivilent on the rating here...I would really rate it a 3.5.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came together nicely.  I too had to use more of the cinnamon/sugar coating.  I used a small cookie scoop and dropped them with that into the sugar mixture for rolling; that way I didn't have to handle them.  I rolled them around in the bowl and onto the tray.  I could taste a slight aftertaste of the cream of tarter.  I would suggest NOT using 'AIRBAKE' cookiesheet for these.  I have one airbake and one regular cookie sheet and the airbaked batches came out flat and didn't look like a snickerdoodle.  I think the high heat is needed for them to puff and crack on top.  the airbake cookies came out rather flat and resembled an oatmeal cookie.  I would also suggest using a good cinnamon for these...I had a cheap "dollar store" brand and I couldn't taste the cinnamon at all.  I rolled them completely and had no trouble with burning; they were beautifully golden on the bottom.  I had to come back here the next day and add to this review:  after letting them set for 24 hours they taste like a doodle with no aftertaste of bitterness and the cinnamon flavor is there but not overwhelming.  They are also very crisp on the edges....I've upgraded rating to 4 stars.

Super easy and look great mixed in with other cookies.  I only dipped the tops in the sugar mixture for fear that the sugar under the cookie would become too dark on the cookie sheet.  The result was a nice golden bottom with no burnt surgar taste.

Delicious!  No unpleasant aftertaste, just great cookie through and through.  Very easy to make too.  I used combined the cinnamon with raw sugar and it made for a beautiful cookie. Thanks for the recipe...this will be made often!

These cookies were wonderful!  I needed some extra cinnamon-sugar for the coating.  I also added about 1/4 cup extra flour because the dough was too thin to roll into balls, but they turned out perfect after that.  Excellent recipe...my family loves them, and I'm sharing them w/ my co-workers tomorrow.

These are great for tea.  My family has more of a sweet tooth so I was disappointed to throw 2/3 of them out a week after baking.  These are good cookies - just not for us.

Wonderful! These cookies did not last one weekend around my house.  My two year old and seven year old loved rolling the cookie dough and coating them in the cinnamon/sugar.  In reading other reviews, I agree I would lower the oven temperature to about 375 instead of 400, but I cooked a whole double batch at 400 and they were still great! This recipe is a keeper!

These are really delicious. Crispy around the edge, chewy in the middle. It all came together very quickly too. I made them as written, except I chilled the dough for about 15 minutes before rolling the balls. The dough was very easy to handle and the ziploc baggie made it easy to coat them with the cinn/sugar. I used a convection oven at 380 for 7 minutes on dark nonstick pans. Definitely will make these again.

Great recipe!  I over cooked one batch and they were still wonderful.  I was out of crm of tarter so I sub'd 2 teaspoons baking powder for the tarter and baking soda.  Also doubled the cinnamon & sugar mix.  I made them this afternoon and only a few remain!

The best snickerdoodle recipe I've baked, as long as you bake at 375 for exactly 8 minutes. The texture is perfect. 
I'm also tasting a bit too much cream of tartar, but no one else in my family seems to notice... 
I also use only about half to 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon per tablespoon of sugar when rolling -- I find a whole teaspoon of cinnamon per is too strong for my taste.
Once baked, these freeze very well (and defrost quickly, so you can sneak one or two or six while no one's looking!).

Very delicious! They were all eaten that same day. My family loved them. Instead of using shortening, I used all butter. Wonderful! Moist, chewy, and down right scrumptious. Will make again and again.

I've tried other snickerdoodle recipes without any success (too flat, no flavour etc) but finally found my be-all, end-all snickerdoodle recipe right here! I didn't have cream of tartar so I omitted it along with the baking soda and used 1 tablespoon of baking powder. Also used 1 cup of white sugar w/ 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3 tbsp white sugar w/ 3 tsp of cinnamon to roll dough in. I did have to turn my oven to 375 (my oven gets really hot!) and baked for 8 minutes. I ate at least half a dozen right when they came out of the oven and hubby took some to work today and said they're requesting more! The cookies stayed nice and soft even though I forgot to close the container they were in. This is definitely "the" snickerdoodle recipe to try!

Pretty good cookie, used all butter and decreased cream of tarter to 1 tsp. Seemed to be missing something. I added a little brown sugar to my cin. and sugar mix, that was it, tasted great. Used a cookie scoop and dumped into bowl of mixture grabed with tongs, no mess. Good luck!

Very Good cookie, just don't overbake. My first batch came out great. I thought at first they were undercooked so on the second batch I cooked them a little longer. Yhey turned out too crunchy. The first batch were perfect once they cooled. Just follow the directions. I will definitly make these again.

Rather tender and tasty. Nice cinnamon balance (I doubled this spice). Went fast on the holiday cookie plate!

I've made these twice in the last week! I sent some to a girlfriend in the upstairs apartment, but her husband ate them all before she came home!  The first time I made them, I didn't have shortening on hand and used all margerine.  The second time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly.  Both batches were delicious, but the margerine made the cookies soft, rather than chewy.  Definitely use shortening for a chewy texture.  Either way, they melt in your mouth.  Try not to roll balls bigger than an inch in diameter, and slightly flatten them if using margerine.  Otherwise they will be too puffy. Now I can't decide whether these or The Whole Jar of Peanut Butter Cookies are my favorite.  Happy baking! Yum

I was so hoping for a snickerdoodle with "puff" in the middle, like my aunt used to make.  This cookie was good, but very flat.  Taste was okay.  IT kind of reminded me of grocery store refrigerator dough taste though.  Like I said, good, but not great.

I'll be making this recipie tonight... but I know I can give it 5 stars already, because I've made almost the identical recipie before. Snickerdoodles are always a hit! If you want a chewy cookie with no crispness, try substituting some or all of the baking soda with baking powder... did this by accident once and the results were very good!

Pretty good but not the best.  You'll be disappointed if you're looking for snickerdoodle cookies like Paradise Bakery's.  This one's flatter, harder, and doesn't have that texture.

These were great and they came out perfect, slightly crispy edges and soft middles.  I rolled them in holiday colored sugar sprinles for a festive touch.  Yummy!

I had to double the recipie due to a Christmas party, but didn't have enough shortening so I used almost all butter and they turned out just fine.  I also used red and green sugar mixed in with the cinnamon which makes them look nice. I would not go as far to say these are the best cookies ever, but they are very easy to make and are good.  There just seems to be something missing though??

This cookie recipe is just wonderful.  My sons LOVE them, and to help form the dough.  I did add a bit more cinnamon to the sugar to roll the dough in.  Since we do like Cinnamon.  But this is a AWESOME recipe, and will use again and again!  Thank you for posting it.

First snickerdoodle cookie I've made. They came out nice and chewy. Used 2" and 1" cookie scoops adj. baking times accordingly 10 m. & 8 m. They were a little dull tasting though, no kick. My husband said maybe more cinnamon FYI. Maybe that's how snickerdoodles are supposed to taste.

I love snickerdoodles!  These are great - I used all butter and a 375 degree oven.
FYI - the "aftertaste" is what snickerdoodles are all about; you either love it or hate it I guess!

This is a good cookie.  When they are on my holiday cookie list, I like to roll them in colored sugar instead of cinnamon and sugar before baking.  They are a festive addition to holiday cookie trays.

These were some awesome cookies! I did make a couple of changes, however. I used half splenda, half sugar and pressed the rounded balls of dough down slightly (I would especially recommend this if you use splenda). I also lowered the temperature to 375 degrees and baked them for seven minutes. They came out soft and ooooooh so delicious!

Very good. Found that they were very sweet though. I believe that if I were to use only butter that would have helped. Since I had already made the dough, I added more salt (approx. 1 tsp) and they turned out great. I added a little bit at a time until the dough had just the right sweetness. My husband couldn't stop eating them. Thanks!

I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of adding an additional tsp of vanilla as suggested by another reviewer.  I rolled one batch into balls, rolled them in sugar, then pressed them slightly onto the cookie sheet (covered with parchment paper) with the bottom of a glass.  These came out of the oven looking "perfect", but were quite thin.  The next batch I rolled into balls, and then just baked them without flattening first. They weren't as pretty, but they weren't as thin either.  Both seemed as though they would get harder as they cooled, but I sealed them in an airtight container and they remained soft and chewy.  The taste was delicious...I could not taste an tartar at all.  Everybody liked them but weren't overly enthusiastic about them.  Nice change from the standard chocolate chip.  Thanks for sharing!

Unbelievable!  Oddly enough, generally I don't like Snickerdoodles but I made these b/c they are an excellent pairing for hot tea (just one or two for a cup).  My husband also does not care for Snickerdoodles...he's not a huge sweet person, but Snickerdoodles were also always too crispy for him.  He ate SIX of these within 30 minutes!  They were soft, perfectly spiced and had a nice barely perceptable hint of salt that kept the cookie from being too sweet.  I had to send these to work with him to keep myself from eating them all the time, and they were completely consumed within a matter of minutes.  Makes the top five in my cookie recipes.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend who loves snickerdoodles.  Never having had a snickerdoodle myself I wasn't sure what to expect but these cookies were WONDERFUL!  I don't like to scale recipies the first time I make them so we had way more cookies than either of us wanted to eat (not that we couldn't these were so good) so my boyfriend took them to work with him the next day.  They were so good that 8 people ate the 36 cookies he took with him in a matter of minutes and requests for more were passed on to me.

This is my favorite recipe - I never had snickerdoodles before, I actually never heard of them.  I tried this on a fluke and ended up loving them.  Thank you.

These were great.  I made them for a bridal shower where the theme was "Afternoon Tea".  Quick and easy to make since I didn't have to refridgerate the dough like other recipes.

these are the very best!  they come out chewy in the centre and crispy around the edges every time!  just make sure you don't overbake, and be generous with the cinnamon sugar.  thanks so much mrs. siggs!  ;0)

Pretty good.  I reduced the temp to 375 and baked seven minutes.  I only dipped one side of my rounded teaspoon of dough in the cinn./sugar mixture.  I noticed the taste of the tartar was stronger the longer the cookies baked.

There's a reason why everyone rates these cookies so high.  There's nothing complext about em, just simple, good snickerdoodles.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out fantastic!  Will keep this recipe around for next time!

Very good, I took them to school and my class loved them. They were cake like though, so if you don't like that, you can add an egg or two.

I halved the recipe and used all butter instead of shortening & 2 tsp. white vinegar in place of 1 tsp. crm of tartar since I didn't have any.   As others, I lowered temp to 375 & took out in 8 min. when they still look light and just starting to crack on the surface.  Resulted in a somewhat dry, soft, cake-like cookie. I think better results(crispier) would be w/ exact recipe. Still Yummy!!

A great cookie!   They are just great!  I allow my cookies to come out while they can still hold a chewy texture- maybe a minute or two before they are considered "done".....they looked perfect and tasted great with a glass of milk for the kids and a cup of coffee for the neighbors!

I just made these cookies and they are wonderful. I followed the recipe except for lowering my oven to 375 degrees, because my oven gets quite hot. They were not wet and did not need refrigeration. They rolled in a ball easily and turned out just as it said. Thank you for a new cookie recipe!

Delish!  I found the dough to be a bit wet, so I added about a tablespoon more to the batter and also covered my hands with flour.  These cookies do flatten out so make sure you have enough room.  My cookies took about 10-11 minutes.  These are very good cookies, crunchy on the edges and chewy in the middle.  Thanks!

I could really taste the shortening in these cookies which I found unappealing however my kids and their friends devoured them straight out of the oven.  Next time I will make them using only butter.

The dough (my favorite part) tastes fabulous.  They're currently in the oven, but since my favorite part of the process happens before the baking, I am fully comfortable exerting my views now.  :-D  Thanks for a great recipe!

Good, but not great.  Will not make again, since there are so many other recipes to try.  Tended to overcook easily, so do watch the oven closely or yours will be too hard.

Great recipe. I am in the UK and in one instance used "Trex" for the shortening; in another instance I used all butter. The all-butter cookies were far better - the taste is amazing - and the texture is perfect too. Enjoy!

I like cookies with flavor.  I liked this recipe because it has nice flavor. I also liked it because it can be chewy or crispy.  The half butter half shortening that Beth uses keeps it from going flat.  Good cookie!

My husband asked me to make Snickerdoodles this evening.  He was extremely pleased with the results from this recipe.  I'll be making these again for the holidays.  I followed the recipe exactly and chilled the dough for about 15 minutes before baking.  They baked 10 minutes in my convection oven and came out perfectly with crunchy edges and chewy centers.

These cookies were sooo good.  They tasted the best right out of the oven.  I used two tablespoons of dough per cookie and they were the perfect size.  I can't wait to try more of Beth's recipes.  THANKS!

I'm not a huge fan of snickerdoodles, but my dad loves them so I made them for him.  He (as well as everyone else who tried them) gave them two thumbs up!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great!  I found that 9 minutes was the perfect amount of time in the oven to keep them super soft.

These were so good. The dough was sticky so I 
chilled it about 30 minutes to make it easier to
handle. I carried a patch to my daughter in college and she requested them everytime we visit.

This is BY FAR the BEST snickerdoodle recipe I have EVER tried! Absolutely wonderful and good enough to serve on any occasion, whether it be a dinner party for your mother in law (he he) or a Halloween party for the kids. Even for hubby's boss! These cookies were gobbled up by everyone in a matter of hours!!!

For Snickerdoodles, they are pretty good.  I used a cinnamon sugar mix I bought already mixed and I liked it because the sugar was really fine.  Mine got a little done on the bottoms but it was probably my cookie sheet.  They have a nice texture though and I have received a lot of compliments.

I used all butter - the flavor turned out very well, but the cookies were pretty flat.  Nobody seemed to care, though!  I will put more cinnamon in next time.

Excellent!  I hadn't had snickerdoodles in years!  This was easy to make.  The only thing I would do differently is double the batch so there would be some left over for me!!!

Oh man, these were so good, every one who tasted them loved them. I was afraid they didn't come out right, cause I used 1 cup of butter flavored crisco instead of butter and shortening, but it didn't hurt them at all. Just make sure you add 6 tsp of water with it.

These cookies are soooooooooo yummy!!!! Love all the recipes you've submited. I think you should open a store, like Mrs. Field. As everyone else said, you should underbake them, and they will get harder on the outside in a few minutes. The inside will be nice and soft. Thanx so much Mrs. Sigg!!! Please submit more recipes.

These are wonderful! My husband loves snickerdoodles and now these are his favorite recipe. He gave them 5 stars and ate nearly the whole batch (minus about 5) in two days and now wants more. Thanks for this keeper of a cookie recipe.  I think that these would be great at Christmas time rolled in red and green sugar, but I'm sure I'll make them many times before them.

Excellent, Excellent, EXCELLENT cookie! My boyfriend and I could have eaten them all in one sitting! To my surprise, mine turned out just like in the picture for this recipe and the taste was even better. Will go into regular sweet rotation!

These cookies come out raw in the center and if you cook them longer they start to burn on the edges.  A very flat cookie!

I've been making these Snickerdoodles for years...decades actually.  Only difference..I use all butter. Only I could tell the difference with all butter and using 1/2 butter Crisco. So, if that's the case...Crisco is cheaper!! They are great no matter.

Snickerdoodles are my fiancee's favorite cookies, and he said he had never had a better snickerdoodle.  I did put only 1/2 the salt and lowered the temp to appx 360F for about 10 mins.  I also added just a little cinnamon to the batter.  thanks.

I made these this morning.  They taste just like snickerdoodles are supposed to taste!  Very much like a recipe I already had, but I made it Mrs. Sigg's way (of course there is always an "except", so...!) :-) ...except I omitted the shortening and used all butter.  Thanks, Mrs. Sigg!  (May 3, 2003)

I'm not a huge fan of snickerdoodles, but wanted to make some cookies today for the kids. Well they're not even out of school yet, and I've already eaten more than my share! These are great, especially out of the oven. I won't be telling my Mother-in-law, but they're better then hers! Thanks.

My daughter and her friends made these for youth group, and everyone loved them.  One of the boys came up to her later and told her these were better than his girlfriend makes, and he loves her snickerdoodles.  He relayed that these stayed nice and soft for days without careful sealing.  Ours didn't last long enough to find out.  The girls did substitute lemon juice for the cream of tartar, and there was no bitterness.

The cookies were great! I took them to a cookie swap at work. My husband hates cinammon (he can't stand the smell) but once he got past that he devoured them.
Only fault, they are not very attractive cookies for Christmas.

These were good, but not as good as I expected.  They were a lot crispier than I prefer.  I like snickerdoodles that are a bit more cake-like in the center and these were a bit more crunchy than I prefer.  I don't think I kept them in too long, though I guess it's a possibility.  I'll probably stick to my tried and true recipe.

I looove these cookies! I make them so often that I've resorted to keeping a ziplock bag full of the cinnamon+sugar mixture in my pantry. A huge hit with my classmates, teachers, and family members. Mmmm.

GREAT RECIPE!  We were craving some cookies at the barracks, so I did a quick search and found these... We got a lot of hugs from the guys for these! ;-)  I even mailed some to my mom cross-country, and she couldn't stop talking about them!  Thanks for a great recipe.

My grandmother used to make snickerdoodles all the time when I was a kid. I got the urge to make some a while back and I tried this recipe. It is every bit as good as I remember hers to be. I can't thank you enough for posting this recipe. My kids and I will be enjoying this recipe for many years to come.

Well, you have 2 more converts in my house.  My son and hubby won't eat any cookies but basic chocolate chip.  As these were cooling, I noticed they kept disappearing off the rack!  Easy and YUMMY and the house still smells great.  Thanks!

This recipe is PERFECT and a snap!

I've read a lot of the reviews saying they scorch, need parchment etc....

Know your oven and use good cookware.  They came right off the cookie sheet in perfect condition.

I baked mine at 375 for 8 minutes.

The recipe is PERFECT!  My only complaint is that it doesn't make enough!  :)  My family gobbled them all down as fast as I could make them.

The smell of these cookies brought back very fond memories of when grandma used to make them.  Mine turned out a little more bready than I like, and they leave a bit of a sour taste in my mouth, but they were probably one of the best snickerdoodle recipes I've tried.

Maybe it´s just me, but I followed the cooking instructions and my first batch got burned, so I lowered the temperature to 350 and baked my second batch on the upper rack, these were ready in 8 minutes flat. I really expected more after reading the reviews, but I found the taste is not as SUPERB as I thought it would be, the cookies are good, but not ALL THAT.

Great, tender snickernoodles!  They burn easily, though, on inferior pans, so I had to watch them carefully.  It was so worth it though! I brought a pile of them into work, and they were gone in a flash.

Very , very good.  Mine didn't flatten out quite enough, but I will definitely use this recipe again and again.  Delicious with a little pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon or combined with it--good for the holidays.

i COULD ONLY THINK OF THREE WORDS AFTER EATING THESE.......
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL
This recipe is...How the kids are saying it?..."THE BOMB!!" and so easy to follow. My hubby is a chocolate man only! And he took some of these with his lunch the next morning. That is saying alot. I myself am quite picky. I don't like under cooked cookies. I don't judge by how many reviews a recipe has; or what people are saying about it. As my taste is different from others... these are the best I have  ever tasted. they were exactly what my taste buds wanted!!! :o)

Made these to bring to a pary.  Boy did they go over big!  They were quite yummy.  A note though - it doesn't say how big to make the balls, or what size spoon.  I found that a slightly heaping teaspoon (from the table, not measuring) worked out great.  Turned out to be a little over 1 inch-ish in size.  Enjoy!  Thanks Mrs. Sigg!

You just have to love the simplicity of snickerdoodle cookies. This recipe makes a wonderfully sweet, crunchy, cinnamon-y cookie which requires no adornment. Enjoy them with coffee or tea. Superb.

I know this recipe doesn't actually need more compliments - but I just have to say that it is an awesome recipe! I made these cookies for a fundraiser and they sold out so fast! Wow!

These are delicious with a very delicate flavor.  My kids loved helping and especially enjoyed eating them.  This recipe makes a lot, so if you are tempted by having lots of cookies around (as I am), a half batch might be better.  Also, check cookies at the minimum time.  Mine took exactly 8 minutes.  Otherwise, they would've been too hard.

This recipe is great!  I chilled my dough before rolling into balls and  found that you can also roll the balls in a mixture of cocoa/sugar and plain sugar with excellent results!

Excellent traditional snickerdoodles recipe - crispy edges, chewy middles. I always have to call my sister-in-law when I wanted to make these. Now I'll just be checking my on-line recipe box!

I rated this recipe 5 stars some time ago.  If baked the proper time these cookies are just as Beth says - crispy edges with chewy centers.  For those that say the cookies are hard, you are overbaking them!  They look a little "under done" when you take them out.  Try this excellent recipe again.

When I saw this Recipe i could not believe it.
 This is the same recipe that My Hubbies Aunt used when she made
him Snickerdoodles.
 He is making them as I am typing this!
 We can't wait to try them!
 We love these Cookies as they are easy to make and they ship well too!!
 Everyone loves them. Sadly when we moved our recipe was lost in the shuffle.
 Now we have it again!!!!!!!

 Thanx so much!!!!!!!

I made these for the first time for Christmas of this year.  They just didn't come out very well for me.  They were very flat and kind of on the greasy side.  Will have to try another recipe next time.

A neighbor had made a batch of these for my children.  They loved them so much that I had to ask for the recipe.  We made a double batch for each of my children's classes for Christmas.  We also baked some for teachers, the bus drivers, the mail carriers etc. Everyone loves them. They are so easy and delicious.  The kids love to help make them too!  I also use this recipe for my sugar cookies.   We just roll them in sugar instead of the sugar and cinnamon.  These are definitely a winner in our recipe book!

I made a lot of substitutes so my sister cook to eat it. Instead of butter and shortening, I used 1 cup of coconut oil. Then instead of eggs, I used 1/2 cup of applesauce. Then instead of flour, I used Red Mills 1 to 1 baking flour (gluten-free flour). I also added roughly about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon in the cookie dough.

My family get togethers proved this recipe.  The only thing I changed is crisco butter flavored shortening.  In stead of 1/2 cup of butter and shorting I used 1 cup of crisco. I am sure it is perfect both ways.

Delicious snickerdoodle recipe! I roll the dough balls in equal parts cinnamon and sugar because I love cinnamon, but the crispy yet chewy texture of the dough is exactly what I want out of a snickerdoodle.

These were wonderful, really soft and just the way a traditional snickerdoodle should taste! Don't skimp on the quality of the vanilla extract you use, particularly for this recipe, as it makes for a big difference in the flavor of the cookie. Yummy!

Wonderful instructions, easy to follow. I’m currently working at trying my hand at baking/cooking a little more often. Just to see if I have a knack for it. Put it on my list of things I know how to do. The overall review from my taste testers. Is fantastic

This is the only Snickerdoodle recipe I've ever tried and ever will use.  It's amazing!  I never really cared for the cookie before, but my friends mother really wanted some so I waded through MANY recipes until one looked like it might be one I would like.  The only change I made was using butter in place of the shortening because I didn't have any and I didn't want to go to the store.  She and everyone else loved them so much I couldn't change it after that.  I also baked on the shorter amount of time.  Thank you so much for an amazing recipe!

I don't find them as amazing as everyone says they are,especially straight from the oven. They are nice and soft but lack flavor. Maybe they need to sit for a while for the flavor to really dog in. So I will wait and update of there is any change.  I followed the recipe as its and did have to as about 1/4c floor to unstuck the surface. But I realized that with a cookie scoop it wouldn't have mattered; because the cinnamon sugar costing would have covered the stickiness. Maybe that is part of the lack of flavor,or maybe it's the .25tsp of salt.
So next time I'll go the salt to.5tsp. It is a workable recipe. I think I want to try it with all butter as well. Maybe I should have used salted butter,but the author did not specify...

Love love love this recipe. I do not make any changes at all. I make sure my eggs/butter are room temperature and these cookies are always fluffy. I pull them out of the oven after 8 minutes and let them sit on the sheet for at least another five. They are perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. SO DELICIOUS

This is the perfect snickerdoodle cookie recipe! As others have mentioned, it is important to make sure that your baking soda is fresh. I followed the instructions exactly and made sure to take the cookies out of the oven as soon as the timer went off after 8 minutes. Perfectly soft and chewy cookies!

I used several tips from the reviews: increased flower to a scant 3 cups, left out about half of one egg white (so used 2 yolks and 1.5 whites), reduced heat to 375. I also used a full tbsp of vanilla, and added a bit of cardamom to the sugar mixture for a more complex flavor. They took 10 minutes instead of 8 to cook, but came out wonderfully - puffy and soft with just a little crisp to the outside.

We love this recipe.  We have used it hundreds of times, exactly as printed, since we found it in 2010. We make up the cinnamon-sugar mixture and keep it in the refrigerator so that is always ready.  The recipe has never failed us.  This is a favorite cookie to take to pot lucks. parties, and bake sales.

These cookies taste good, but I think they have way too much shortening in them. I misread the baking instructions and set my oven at 200 degrees F. They came out too soft and flat. I raised the temp to 350 and the second batch was much better, but still flat. I won't use this recipe again.

This tastes so good and super easy to make, the classic cinnamon sugar cookie! I added 1,5 tablespoon of liquified butter when mixing the dry ingredients because the dough is so thick.

My boyfriend said that these are the best snickerdoodle he has ever ate. They are simple, the recipe makes plenty, and they are incredibly soft. Bake them untill the cookie is even all the way around, this will ensure they are cooked thoroughly. good luck!!

I will definitely make these again.  They were so delicious that I threw out the older cinnamon that I used and bought fresh so the flavor will be more intense!

Loved these cookies, made exactly per Mrs Sigg's instructions except removing from sheet immediately. I tried removing a cookie right out of the oven and it fell apart. I let the cookies rest on the sheets for 2 min and they were easily removed from the sheet and placed on the cooling racks , only thing I will change in the recipe is increase the white sugar in the cinnamon coating from 2 tbl to  3 tbl as the cinnamon is a bit strong in this one. These cookies as is are Amazing !!!

These are delicious. Followed the recipe exactly and left in oven for exactly 8 min as some reviewers said. Worked out excellent.

These are delicious! The bottom of the cookies burned on my first batch so I read the reviews. I changed to 375 degrees, took them out right at 8 minutes and removed them from the pan. I also switched to a pan that was not as dark and used parchment paper. Every batch after these changes were prefect!

I make these year after year and it's always such a tried and true recipe. they're so perfectly soft that it makes people smile when they take the first bite :)
I usually don't keep cream of tartar on hand bc subbing with lemon juice has never failed me in any recipe and works the same - so don't feel the need to go out and buy some if you don't have any. 
pro tip: for perfectly soft cookies, take them out of the oven at 8 min, but let them stay on the baking tray for a few minutes so it continues slightly baking on the pan. up to 9 min is okay but I'd say that 10 is too long if you want maximum tenderness! ;)

Made it just like the recipe but the individual cookies were too big.  Flavor was right but hard to wrap my brain around the wrong size.

I will make them again, although smaller.

These are amazing! They turned out beautifully. I made them exactly according to the recipe, with my trusty old wooden spoon. Turned my cookie sheet after 4 minutes, because my oven is ancient. These are my Mama’s favorite & my 8 year old deemed them the best he’s ever eaten. Thanks for a great recipe!!

These were so good! I'm not a big fan of cinnamon but I thought I'd try these and boy I'm glad I did!. I only had about half the cream of tartar the recipe called for, so I made  up the difference with lemon juice as other folks had mentioned.  These are a keeper for sure!

My kids could taste the cream of tarter they said the cookies had "a weird taste" as I have made snickerdoodles before I think that had to be the  culprit.  They were very soft and I thought quite good but not for everyone.  I would leave it out next time or reduce it to 1 tsp.

Hudson and Holden requested. Baked 5 minutes on convection and 5 regular bake. Very tasty. My oven cooks so uneven even though I spun the sheet half way through.

Love these, but for me it seems to take a couple batches to figure out perfect cooking time and perfect size of cookies.
NOTE TO SELF: 1) Next time don't rely on "ungreased cookies sheet". USE PARCHMENT paper - my cookies stuck to the cookie sheet thus ruining my first 2 batches.  2) Roll dough into 1-inch balls, small is good. Too big and they flatten way out.
Yummy.

I baked at 375 instead of 400.  And, baked a bit longer of course.  Around 12 -14 min.   I made a mistake and mixed the cinnamon in with the dough.  And, i just rolled them in sugar before baking.  Then, i drizzled a powdered sugar glaze across the to dress them up a bit.  Yummy.

I used parchment paper for baking on.  NINE minutes and not a  half minute more!.  (I scorched one batch - which my husband devoured anyway.)  Definitely put the sugar and cinnamon in a bag for easy rolling of balls and clean up.  I agree with adjusting rolling mix to 2 TBLS. sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon and probably a double batch of that, since I had to make a second batch up.  Great recipe.  Made about 40 cookies.

Absolutely delicious. I brought some into the office a few weeks ago, and now my coworkers keep bringing it up. I think they want me to make these again...

They were easy to make. Instead of baking them for 10 minutes at 400, baked them for 9 minutes.  The only question I have is if they can be frozen?

This was an excellent recipe. After mixing the dough, I put it in the freezer before forming it into balls so they did not overly spread. I will make these again!

Oh boy is this yummy!!! Crispy edges and chewy center. Absolutely delicious!

I didn't have cream of tartar so I subbed it for baking powder (also learned vinegar could be used instead). Also used all butter.

It's a super simple recipe and easy to follow. I creamed butter and everything else for 5 mins then used a wooden spoon to blend in the dry ingredients.

Will be making this over and over again.

So, so good! I baked them at 395 just because my oven runs hot. I used white vinegar because I didn’t have tartar. I just took a dozen out of the oven...and there are only 6 left. My 16yo son concurs with the 5 star rating!

I've heard about these cookies for years and finally decided to make a batch and choose this recipe.  Makes close to 4 dozen so now I need to either go visit the grandkids or have them come over because they are dangerously good.   I didn't change a think in the recipe, I found 9 minutes was perfect.

made these sugar free several times by substituting sugar w/monk fruit & apple juice & adding raisins. also made them sugar free & almost vegan by replacing half the butter w/pumpkin & flax for egg. Delicious every time! So moist!

Great recipe, but I replaced shortening with more butter on a 1:1 ratio and the cookies turned out fluffier and more like a snickerdoodle. Highly recommend!

My daughter's college volleyball team loves these snickerdoodles! I love making cookies, and even better handing them off to tall athletic young ladies who can put them to good use post-match. They've been rapturously described as "your snickerdoodles... so crispy... so chewy...so good"

Bake them on parchment paper. That makes it simple to get them off the hot pan before they get too done. Other than that, this could NOT be easier, and the cookies are fantastic!

I made it word for word to the recipe. It calls to cream the butter and things, so darn it I had Mildred (the mixer) turned up to 9. Put on the dough hooks and mixed until I was good and happy. In retrospect I would use a smaller scoop for portion, I think my oven runs cool because they came out a little gooey for me, but that’s just me.

Very good. I am a guy so my cookies came out flat, but still good.  It could be that some of my ingredients, such as the baking soda, are army surplus left over from the Normandy invasion. Still, much better than Oreos.

These cookies are amazing. I would recommend using parchment paper when baking, and keep an eye on them, it's very easy to burn them with the sugary bottoms. Best snicker doodle recipe

I doubled the recipe so I could freeze the dough for the holidays and after reading suggestions I used 2 teaspoons cream of tartar, and 2 teaspoons baking powder and 2 teaspoons baking soda. The cream of tartar kept the cracks in the cookies on top and the baking powder kept them from being totally flat. They turned out perfect as long as I followed reviews and took them out at 8 minutes even though they didn’t look quite done yet at the time. I let them firm up for a couple of minutes on the cookie sheet. They’re amazingly good!

I followed the recipe as written and the final result was perfect. I rolled the dough into 48 little balls (the recommended size in the recipe)  and tossed them in a bag of sugar/cinnamon mix and placed them on the foil. I did not flatten them.  I did not chill the dough.  I baked at 400 degrees for exactly 8 minutes.  Then I immediately slid the foil sheet onto the counter to cool for a few minutes.

They puffed up and spread to maybe 2 1/2 inches wide and about a half inch tall.  They settled only slightly after cooling. They are not at all dry or crunchy.  Just slightly chewy.

I think that it is important to really cream the butter and sugar and eggs until fluffy.  That helps a lot to prevent too much spreading while baking. Do not worry about "over fluffing", that is not possible. 

I do not use a baking sheet to bake cookies.  I use a cookie cooling rack and lay a piece of foil over it.  Then I quickly slide the foil with the cookies off the rack when I take it out of the oven.  Perfectly colored cookie bottoms and the rack is cool enough to use with the next batch of cookies.  This way I get the exact same baking conditions for every pan that I bake.  I just use two sheets of foil and rotate them after I remove the cooled cookies. I also do not grease the sheets.

If you like Snickerdoodles, follow the recipe carefully, you  will be rewarded with perfect cookies.

Excellent cookies! I can only get 4 dozen and they disappear so quickly! Once I was out of cream of tartar so I used lemon juice instead. That worked very well. Thank you for a great recipe!

Made it twice best KNickerdoodles I ever made however the 2nd time I made them I mixed the ingredients for too long and it was to sticky to roll so I used a spoon and dropped it in the sugar and cinnamon then rolled it.

Loved these, passed on link to a few people who have trouble making these type of cookies.  Maybe they didn't use cream of tartar which has to be the key.

This is one of the best cookie recipes I have ever tasted in my life. The only thing is that my cookies never flatten out properly! They turn out basically the same size as the dough balls that I put onto the cookie sheet. Any advice?

I love this recipe! I had never made snickerdoodles before, but it was super easy. The only thing I changed was the temperature of the oven. My first batch burned a bit on the bottom, so I turned the oven down to 350, and baked the second batch for 9 minutes. Perfection on a cookie sheet! :))

Fabulous!  Soft inside, slightly crunchy outside.
I used all butter, skipping the shortening.
For one batch I added nutmeg to the cinnamon sugar mixture and I loved it!

Would have come out nicer if I didn't misread the measuring spoon when putting baking soda into it. I used tbsp instead of tsp so the cookies are flat but very moist and airy inside. They taste great.

Very very good flavor! I would possibly turn the oven down a notch or pull them right at the 9 minute mark. I think I over baked mine but hey, when the flavor is good, but they don’t turn out right, i automatically think operator error. They still get 5 stars

Used butter instead of shortening and 2:1 sugar and cinnamon mix and baked at 9 minutes, 8 if you want them super soft, but I like them a little more done in the middle.

The only reason this is getting a four star rating is because of my own mistake - I forgot baking soda and had to substitute powder! (A nightmare indeed.) I had measure out the correct amount and the cookies still baked incredibly! I only don't feel confident giving five stars because I didn't use this recipe. Will be making again with baking soda this time!

By far the best Snickerdoodle recipe I've ever made.

They were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.  So many times snickerdoodles come out dry.  These melted in our mouths.

Great recipe!  Definitely will be my go to!

According to co-workers "these are the best" and "Snickerdoodles aren't my favorite but these are amazing".  Don't recall making snickerdoodles before, but after all the raves, I think I'll be making quite often.  Made as-is and baked for 8 minutes as I saw others mention.  Pretty much the perfect cookie.  May have added a bit extra cinnamon to dip them in, but not much (lazy measurement)

SO EASY AND SOO DELICIOUS! TOOK NO TIME AT ALL AND TURNED OUT PERFECT! I BAKED MINE FOR 10 MIN AT 375 AND THAT WAS A PERFECT TIME, IT IS BETTER TO UNDER BAKE THEM AND LET THEM FINISH BAKING ON THE COUNTER SO THE BOTTOMS DONT BURN

Excellent cookies. Just make sure to bake them less than more. Eight minutes in an electric oven was almost too much.

Perfect recipe!! My oven runs hot so I baked them at 375 and started checking them at 7 minutes. Only added one minute at a time because they burn fast. They came out so good, I made my husband and kids deliver some to the neighbors.

I ran out of the cinnamon/sugar mixture halfway through, so I recommend doubling that right off the bat. Hands down the best snickerdoodles, with a gentle crust and a wonderful consistenty.

I made this recipe following the instructions given to the letter, however, I was disappointed to find the cookies to be crunchy in the middle when baking for 8 minutes. For a soft, chewy inside, these should be baked for 7 minutes. Otherwise, the flavor was fantastic!

I didn't have shortening or butter so used 1 Cup margarine, and didn't have cream of tarter so used 4 tsp of lemon. I did take the advise and refrigerated for a half hour. Turned out great, Nice and easy to make.

This is one of those recipes that bring the "perfect cookie" search to a halt!  I'm always wanting to find the best recipe for different cookies, and found this to be the best snickerdoodle cookie I've ever tasted.  I take them out when they look almost done, but not quite, and they cool to a wonderful texture of 'soft with a slight chewiness.'

Taste is delicious.. a little too crunchy if you leave them in the full time. I would suggest 8 minutes too.

Made them and they came out delicious!! Use fresh baking soda, it makes a difference. Mine did not go flat at all. I also followed other's advice and took out exactly at 8 minutes and moved to a wire rack to cool.

You know how you dont get flat cookies?! Cream the out of the butter shortening egg and vanilla!  I mean for like at least 5 mins. You want to make sure that is nice and fluffy not just mearly mixed. 

I baked mine got 10 mins at 400 degrees and they still came out absolutely delicious!  Puffy and soft. 

One thing is that next time I may try using unsalted butter to try to cut down on the salt in the cookie. Even with the salted butter, the cookie is delicious.

My husband gave this recipe 4 stars however, I think I would have given it 5.  It produced roughly 30 cookies that were soft  and buttery on the inside but slightly crispy on the outside.  I used butter flavored Crisco for shortening*. YUM!

My 13yo son (my most honest food critic) said these were the best cookies he’s ever had!  I doubled the recipe and increased the flour by about half a cup, used all butter, upped the vanilla, chilled them well before and after rolling, and increased the cinnamon-to-sugar ratio.

If you don't push them down they are still shaped like balls. And they are a little dry.
Other then that they are great.

Needed to make cookies for refreshments after church, but I was out of choc chips needed for my usual cookie choice. I had all the ingredients (well, not shortening, so used butter) and the cookies turned out great! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Incredibly wonderful cookie!  Soft on the inside with a slightly crisp bottom.  Heaven!  Even people who tell me "I don't really care for snickerdoodles", love these cookies!  I normally make these using a large-sized cookie scoop.

The recipe was delicious. I followed it exactly because it was my first time with snickerdoodles.  I wouldn't change a thing.  They were so moist and delicious.  I don't know if they are going to make it to my kid's bake sale!

I’ve been making this recipe for years as it appeared in Southern Living many, many years ago. However, the original called for 1 cup of shortening and no butter. I’ve always made them with shortening until today. I tried half butter. These cookies did not puff up and stay puffed like the shortening ones. These deflated and turned out quite “sad”. They also seem greasy. I know butter is “healthier” but not the best for these cookies. I’m going back to shortening.

This recipe is a great base recipe!  You can use it as snickerdoodles, sugar cookies OR...my next try will be lemon cookies!  I do NOT like the cream of tartar after taste so I will sub that next time.  These were very good!  I cooked for 8 minutes as other reviews suggested and they were soft on the inside and crisp on outside.

I have used this recipe for 40 years.  I do add some almond extract to the recipe and use real Mexican vanilla.  The almond extract takes them to a new level.

only problem I had was the 400 degree oven the bottoms were burning before they were done.  On the second batch I made I lowered the temp to 350 and they turned out great.

This is the same recipe I've used for  almost 40 years. It's  from Gold Medal in their  "Century of Success Cookbook"  published in 1979.  As another reviewer suggested, I use 3 tbl sugar & 3 tsp cinnamon to roll them in.

Delicious cookie!  I made sure to use fresh Baking Soda. I pulled them out at 8-minutes, but if I had gone 10–mins, I would have gotten that crispier top that I like biting into.  Texture is great!!

I made the recipe as directed and the texture and taste are pretty good.  I will use only butter next time because I'm not a fan of the Crisco aftertaste.

These are my grown son's favorite cookies. I double the recipe and it makes over 6 dozen -- plenty to take to work and send to DS out of state.  I always use about a half cup of sugar and a LOT of cinnamon in a heavy ziplock bag and shake them instead of rolling -- much faster.

Only reason I would give these cookies 4 stars is because I thought they'd be more chewy on the inside. I could've overbaked them though.... But still delicious.

These are an all-time family favorite.  Both my son and my grandson have enjoyed participating in the creation of our snickerdoodles.  Their roles:  Job 1 was to shake the ball around in the cinnamon/sugar mixture, and Job 2 was to watch the batch through the oven window.  We found we liked the cookie best if I removed them from the oven just after they deflated.  When that occurred, he would shout, "There they go!", and that was my signal to remove them.   They would be a little crispy around the edges, and a little chewy in the middle. Yum!

Made with all butter instead of half butter and half shortening. Cookies taste good even though they are VERY flat.  I even used new baking soda, but perhaps cream of tartar is old (per review I read). Will keep recipe but may try shortening and new cream of tartar.
5/19: used shortening and same cream of tartar- looked great, but Millie likes Grandma Prins’s better!??

Made half a batch and they turned out beautifully. In place of shortening I used the shelf-stable Crisco which can be used to replace butter or shortening; for the softened butter, I went with the Smart Balance version used for cooking and baking. Added a pinch of ginger to the cinnamon and sugar used to roll the dough. I love the soft middle while it remains slightly crunchy on the outside, especially around the edges. I can see me trying these out again.

Super easy, taste great.  The key is to take them out of the oven when set, but not hard (like the recipe states).  I thought they turned out wonderfully.

I added 3/4 C flour, changed baking soda to 1 1/2 tsp and cream of tartar to 1 1/2 tsp.  Refrigerated dough for 20 mins and rolled into rough balls before dipping in sugar and cinnamon. Cookies were thick and pillowy, crispy outside. The best snickerdoodle recipe I have ever tried. I've made it twice now. Changed the baking soda and cream of tartar cut down on the acrid taste you can get sometimes with tartar. Adding the flour and refrigerating made the dough easier to handle and rise for a thicker cookie that doesnt spread out so much.

I used a stand mixer to mix the dough (due to arthritis in my hands), and used the suggested 3T sugar and 3t cinnamon for the coating. They turned out absolutely perfect! I will definitely be making these again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this to take to a family Christmas party. They are wonderful! The only change I made was substituting baking powder for the cream of tartar because I didn't have any. Be sure not to over bake them!! I pulled them out of the oven a little early and let them residually cook on the baking sheet for a minute or two. They are wonderfully soft and chewy out of the oven. My husband and children love them. I can't wait to see what the rest of the family thinks!

They were gone an hour after they came out of the oven! My advice would be when putting them on the cookie sheet to make them into cubes and coat them with the cinnamon-sugar mixture and then put them in the oven for 9 minutes. I tried 8 minutes after reading the reviews and tried one but thought it was to wet and needed more time. I did 9 minutes and they were perfect. I will be bringing them to plenty of parties in the future! Another tip is to have fresh as possible baking soda and cream of tartar.

I followed the advice of Chef Joy and pulled them from oven at 8 minutes.  I let them sit for a few minutes on pan before transferring to wire rack.  For the sugar coating; I mixed 3 Tbsp sugar and 2 1/2 tsp cinnamon (Chef Joy's tip) and this was just enough.   These freeze well also;  I made the balls, rolled in the sugar, put on a dish in the freezer for about 15 minutes and then dropped the balls in to a ziplock bag with the name; oven temp and time   Now I can bake a few at a time for the family

Fantastic!  I substituted lard for shortening to make these Kosher.  I followed advice and used 3 T. Sugar and 3 t. Cinnamon for coating, using a metal bowl and tossing the balls like chicken wings.  Great recipe, you get a hearty HEIL, Frau Sigg!

This recipe was super easy to put together. I accidentally used a 1/2tbsp measuring spoon for vanilla so I wound up with 3tsp instead of 2. It didnt turn out bad at all even with that flub. Everything followed in this recipe was perfect- the ingredients, oven temp, duration. I got about 40 cookies out of the dough- I would recommend to refrigerate or freeze for just a few minutes to stiffen the dough a tad and make them stick less when rolling into balls. Mine were a bit fluffy, more of a dome than flat, which i like. Assuming if you prefer flatter cookies, you may want to give an easy pat down to flatten a bit before baking. These are kid-approved!

My favorite Christmas cookie.  It reminds me of my Grandmother. It is basically the same recipe.  The only change is a pinch of nutmeg in your cinnamon and sugar coating.  Thank you Mrs. Sigg's for the memories.

Omg amazing.  I like soft bake cookies so I followed a few others recommendations but followed the ingredients almost to a T. Increased the cinnamon sugar mix to 3TBSP on each, decreased the temp to 375, and cooked them for 8-9mins. I have an electric oven.  They came out semi flat and soft in the middle which is perfect for me!

A very rounded, easy to make cookie. I used this recipe in my baking class and it turned out to perfection.  The only amendments we made to this recipe were to ever so slightly flatten them with a bowl so the didn't loose their bulk, but so they could spread more evenly. In addition, we adjusted the cooking time from 8 to 9 minutes, but every oven is different. Very well executed.

Perfect balance of sweet and acidic, super easy to make and nice and soft!  Kind of need to adjust timing just because my oven's got weird heating issues but almost got it perfect. Will make it a lot!

I did not change a thing about this recipe and the cookies turned out great. I have a gas oven and I baked the cookies on the center rack for eight minutes. I used approximately one and a half inch dough balls for each cookie and placed them on a parchment lined baking pan.  The cookies stayed plump with soft insides and crusty edges. I was able to move them immediately from the pan onto the cooling rack. The shape was more uniform when I tightly rolled the dough balls. I will definitely use this recipe again. Delicious and easy!

These turned out perfectly! Super fluffy. Crunchy on the edges and soft in the center. I don’t like cooking with shortening so I substituted it with the same amount of butter. The mixture was really sticking so I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour. It helped with the structure. It was still too sticky to roll in a ball however so I just used an ice cream scoop to scoop up the cookie dough into good sizes and put them on the sheet. After that, I sprinkled on my cinnamon sugar mixture. I made about 27 cookies with this recipe (my cookies were fairly large and expanded a good deal).

Was super excited to make these cookies with my FACS class but wish I would have chose a different recipe. First problem was that my recipe did not yield 48 cookies like stated. Rather it made about 28. I made them in a restaurant grade convection oven and was very disappointed when they turned out to be very dry. They crumbled everywhere! I will say my students did  help make the recipe with me so there is a chance they measured an ingredient wrong but overall I don't think it they should have turned out the way they did over a few tbsp of a difference.

The best tip I can give for people whose cookies are coming out flat is that I’ve found refrigerating the dough overnight to be essential!

I used coconut oil instead of shortening and my cookies were fluffy instead of chewy and crispy. I'd prefer the chewy and crispy, but they tasted good anyway and family likes them!

Just made these today and they turned out wonderful! They had the perfect texture and flavor. I cooked them 8 minutes and then let them cool slightly before moving them to the wire rack. My whole family loved them. I will be making these again! Thank you!!

Use Avocado as a healthier substitute for the butter!  Wonderful flavor and a soft green.  YUMMY!

Second time making this recipe- I love it and I’ll never use another. I was a little daring and did 9 minutes instead of 8 like everyone suggested, but I tend to make my cookies a tiny bit on the bigger side. IMO they came out perfect. Look how pretty! The 3 missing is my immediate lack of self control... but who can honestly resist fresh hot cookies? The only thing I would ever change is to add these little cinnamon crumble pieces and I used to have as a kid to get more cinnamon inside, but I haven’t seen those in years.

These are extremely forgiving. I made a half batch with my two-year-old, stirring by hand (and not that thoroughly, what with the two year old in charge and all). They still came out to be extremely delicious! I'll definitely make these again!

These cookies are amazing I love the taste, texture and look! Although since I don't ever have shortening on hand, I used 1 cup of butter instead of 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.

After 5 years of my husband begging me to make his favorite cookie... I settled on his recipe. HE SAID HE WOULD MARRY ME ALL OVER AGAIN! I’ve baked THOUSANDS OF COOKIES but never a “snickerdoodle”. This recipe is apparently fantastic. He’s beyond happy and I will be adding this to my handwritten cookbook. Thank you Mrs. Sigg!

I sprinkled extra cinnamon sugar mixture (and put in an extra tsp of sugar into the mixture)
Otherwise 100/10 would bake again.

I’ve made these cookies many times. They turned out great and everyone loved them. I decided to add 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder to see if I could get them a little more puffy. It worked great.

As far as cookies go there awesome. The only problem is with the shortening, I'm pretty sure multiple people don't have it in their kitchen but there are multiple substitutes you can use.

The cookies came out perfectly. They are soft and savory, the cinnamon isn't overpowering it is just the right amount. They didn't flatten out, the cookies stayed rounded on the top. They also cooked evenly, I would definitely recommend this recipe to other people.

I made larger dough balls and they came out a bit softer and chewier, but I think that is with most, if not all, cookies. Overall, they were pretty good. I will definitely make these again.

Make sure you have lots of patience to roll the drought in the cinnamon.

I followed the recipe and they turned out great. The only thing I did differently was to mix everything by hand. I didn’t have to refrigerate the dough or add extra flour and it really wasn’t sticky.  I used a tablespoon cookie scoop and it made 48. I did bake them for 8 minutes and immediately took them off the cookie sheet. Great recipe.

These turned out great. I didn't have shortening and used all butter. I also took other reviewers advise and used 3TBSP sugar and 2TSP cinnamon for the amounts you roll the dough in. The trick to fluffy cookies is DO NOT over mix. In every step, mix until just combined...be gentle with your dough and you will have wonderful cookies. I will be making these again as requested by all my kids. I used a cookie scoop and cooked them about 10 min as they were bigger cookies.

I did only half of the recipe for around 20 cookies. Because I live in high altitude I had to make a few adjustments: a little less sugar, a little more flour. I had no cream of tartar so i use lemon juice. I also use canola oil instead of shortening. I put the unbaked cookies in the fridge for 30 minutes. I baked them as indicated in the recipe and they turned out perfect.

My favorite cookie and go to recipe. I refrigerate the dough before rolling in the sugar mixture to bake.  Cold dough bakes better and doesn't flatten out.

This cookie is absolute perfection!! Slightly chewy, slightly crisp, slightly soft--and wonderfully flavored! I used all butter, 1 1/4 cups white sugar in the dough, and 1/2 tsp salt. I baked them at 375 for 10 minutes, and that was perfect for me. I also got 32 cookies out of this. Thank you for this recipe!! It's definitely a winner in my book!

I added more cinnamon to the sugar mixture and added 1tsp of cinnamon to the batter. Since I used unsalted butter, I probably should have added more! We love cinnamon. 

Good recipe though. I have an electric oven, so cooking time was closer to 12 minutes instead of 10.

once in awhile you get a GEM of a recipe which someone has generously shared  with you - this is NOT IT.  I followed  the recipe exactly and they came out flat like flat rock cakes. 400F is way too high - the cookies burnt fast. Believe 375F might be more appropriate. The cream of tartar give it a funky after taste. Feels like the ratio of flour to sugars is out...tastes and bakes way too cakey.

These cookies were delicious! After reading the suggestions in the comments and fixing the recipes, it was absolutely scrumptious. I made my cookies a little bit big and they turned out perfect. I made another batch with smaller dough balls and they were a bit harder to bit into the the big ones. Overall I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again 10/10.

Easy and delicious. I made roughly 40 medium small cookies from this recipe and they were delicious. I added 2 teaspoons of sugar after using most of my cinnamon sugar because it was mostly cinnamon at the end.

The recipe was easy to follow but it didn’t turn out good for me they weren’t soft and they were really flat but I chalked it up to my baking soda not being fresh because everything else I used was brand new.

These are the best ever! I love them! I don’t use tartar most times though. It could have been using tartar or a little too much butter that made them flat and chewy once. And I like to double the cinnamon and sugar and put it in a baggie and shake the doughball in it. And grab it with tongs to transfer to baking sheet.

I only had whole wheat all purpose flour in the house, so used it, and these still turned out amazing! I was nervous because I needed more flour than the recipe called for, but they still turned out chewy & delicious. They were a lot sweeter than I thought they would have been- a very nice treat with tea.

I ran out of flour, so I ground up some Quaker oats, and used about half flour, half oats. Best oatmeal cookies ever!

They were super good. I did tweak he recipe. You should def add cream of tartar for a better “eye appeal”. I also add just a light dust of the cinnamon and sugar mixture AFTER the cookies have baked as well. I do feel the bake time should be reduced and/or lengthened IF yhe size of your cookies aren’t spot-on with what the recipe says they should be. Delicious and I’ve added this to my cookie recipe book (with my hidden tweaks on there lol)

These are delicious!  We didn't make a single change but we did watch them closely and pulled them out of the oven right at 8 minutes. We will definitely make these again.

Delicious!  Made with all butter because we didn't have shortening.  Also, put the dough in the fridge for a few minutes to make it easier to roll in cinnamon and sugar.  Will make again!

Love the recipe but also had to tweak it to be perfect. My husband said the first batch (original recipe) was good but was missing something so I ended up adding a bunch of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg directly to the dough. They were absolutely delicious after I did so!!

Came out awesome. Also good using pumpkin instead of shortening—the cookies don't flatten out but they do disappear.

This was one of the best cookie recipes I've ever made!  I guess that's not saying much as I hardly ever bake, but I wanted to make something special for my Dad and brother-in-law for Father's Day.  

A couple of things I learned/tips: the scoop they use in the video is NOT an ice cream scoop!  It's a melon baller!  I made the cookies "too big" and they took twice as long to bake.  Overall not a bad thing though!  Just fewer but bigger cookies.  Also, I tried to cook both sheets at once, and the ones on the top rack almost got burnt but luckily are still edible!

Overall, I will definitely be making these again!  Not too hard for a novice/beginner baker like myself.

Snickerdoodles are not my family's favorite, but they loved this recipe. I used all Crisco and bakes for only 6 minutes. They turned out very soft and fluffy.

Perfect soft and puffy cookies with a great flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. I would not change a thing. Everyone that ate them loved them. This is my new favorite recipe.

Snickerdoodles are my husband's favorite cookie. My 7-year old daughter was helping me make these and accidentally dumped the cinnamon-sugar mix into the batter. They still treated great and there wasn't any time-consuming, messy rolling floppy balls around in powder to contend with, so now that's how we make them.

Thank you for the recipe! This was my first attempt at snickerdoodle cookies, which are my favorite! I followed this recipe, with a little help from some great suggestions in the comment section, and they turned out exactly as you described… Amazing.

I found these quite nice! I placed a small white chocolate chip in the middle of them. I did however, cut down the 1 1/2 c white sugar to 1 c as we don't like as sweet.

This is the best snickerdoodle recipe I have found! Only thing is the first time I made them they did have a faint acidic, cream of tartar taste which was slightly unpleasant.  The next time I just substituted the baking soda and cream of tartar for 4 tsp. baking powder. This took away the bad aftertaste and the cookies were perfect! I will definitely  make these again!

Made the recipe as directed and they came out perfect. Light brown cookie puffed up nice with a soft tender inside. I've had them in the past but this is the first time reviewing it. S definite keeper. Like the others have said, it's crucial to bake them as written for 8minutes, no more.

Recipe was so easy! I've made this recipe 3 times already... for a crawfish boil, and 2 parties. Received many compliments!  Added 1/4 cup of flour as another reviewer suggested and chilled before making cookies.  Thank you for posting such delicious recipe!

These came out perfect. Chewy centers and very tasty. I wouldn't call the outside crispy at all. Maybe because I used parchment paper? Either way its the best snickerdoodle recipe I've tried.

Great recipe! They were a big hit with my toddler, my husband and my work peeps. I made them big, with a good dollop of dough for each cookie. 10 mins on parchment paper, no fuss no muss and each one was perfectly chewy and moist.

What a wonderful recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly as written except I followed the suggestion of several reviewers and only cooked for eight minutes.  I also made sure to start with room temperature butter and shortening.  I did not use parchment paper as some suggested.  The cookies still came right off the sheet with no problem.  I moved them almost immediately to the cooling rack.  It was concerning that reviewers  worked around the gooey dough and I thought this might be messy - but it wasn't.  Just dust your hands with a bit of flour when rolling the balls.  I also rolled them by hand in a soup bowl containing the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  It was a lot less labor intensive than I thought it would be.  This recipe was made for a fundraiser and it doubled just fine.  You can move a batch to the cooling rack,  roll a pan/batch, and transfer a batch to baggies in about eight minutes.

Soft and chewy.  This is a keeper for quick cookies.  Always watch bake time to keep soft.

i've never made snickerdoodles before and decided to give this recipe a try. I don't think I've ever had so many compliments on a cookie recipe before! I followed the recipe exactly and baked for exactly 8 minutes like other reviewers said. I was worried they were underdone but once they cooled, they were perfectly crispy on the outside and so moist and chewy on the inside! They have a lovely vanilla flavour. My only complaint was I didn't know how big to make the balls. (I wish it said in the recipe) I got 28 cookies out of the recipe, and reading the reviews someone else got 64!!! 
I highly, highly recommend this recipe!

One of the few recipes I followed to a T, and they are just amazing especially fresh out of the oven! The first time I made it, my cousin took the leftovers home and she said they were just as great. Making them again right now as I type this review for a friend. 8 minutes is perfect! No more, no less.

I made three batches. Tried the original recipe, the cookies turned out rather well. Used a full cup of shortening for the next batch since I had used up my butter in another recipe, the cookies came out decently, lacked a little something. I bought more ingredients and forgot the shortening, so I used a whole cup of butter. This last batch turned out fantastic! A whole cup of butter, rather than half made the best cookies I have had in a long time. A richer flavour, and very tender, careful when taking them off the pan. I advise letting them set for a minute or two after putting the cookie sheet on a cool surface, marble, granite, or butcher block. otherwise the cookies will keep cooking and turn hard and taste *off* a little

This is the same basic Snickerdoodle recipe you will find floating all over the web. The only real difference in this one is the shortening. I skipped that and just used all butter. This is a basic, tried and true recipe for a reason, it makes a delicious cookie! My tweak is to add a bit of cinnamon to the cookie dough itself. I also add more cinnamon to the sugar mixture that you roll them in.

These are amazing. Make sure not to overbake. My air bake pan was perfect after 10 minutes but that was too long for my regular darker colored pan.

Fun to make...delicious! I had to use all butter...bummer!  8-9 minutes was the trick.  I deleted vanilla because I like a tarter taste.

Great recipe, but instructions for beginner cooks like me should have been clearer, especially when we should have blended the flour separately. We ended up making brickerdoodles, but they tasted great.

these are really good cookies. I am giving only 4 stars because I think they need more cinnamon.   I love the texture, and used the last little bit to make some thumbprint cookies.

I used all butter, no shortening. I have an electric oven so I always decrease temp by 10 degrees but kept the recommended baking time of 8 mins. I ALWAYS line with wax paper. Moved it to cooling rack AS SOON as they came out of the oven. They are perfection!!!!

A wonderful cookie! As per another review, I used 1 teaspoon cream of tartar and 1 teaspoon of baking powder.  Delish!! They vanish as quickly as I can make them. I think, for a nuttier taste, next time, i will try half vanilla extract and half almond extract.  350 for 8 minutes is perfect for us! Thank you for this recipe.

Don't know what went wrong but these did not turn out for me.  They never flattened and look like little golf balls :(  maybe it's the cream of tartar?  I will not make again.

I loved this recipe! It gives you a nice, plump cookie, and for me, the baking time it recommended was perfect. I also love that cracks form on the cookies, giving it a rustic sort of look. And it tastes great! Definitely recommend it.

It’s an excellent recipe but it seems to be taken almost word for word out of Betty Crocker’s Cooky Book published in the ‘60’s.

In my opinion, this is the perfect Snickerdoodle. I followed the recipe as written, and as one reviewer suggested, I baked them for exactly 8 minutes. They came out perfectly. Not too flat, not too thick, just right and tasted delicious! 36 perfect cookies!

First of all, Cream of Tartar is used in the Snickerdoodle recipe for the distinctive tangy flavor that most Snickerdoodles have. If you do not like that flavor then do not use the Cream of Tartar. Most regular sugar cookies do not have any Cream of Tarter in them. If you want a cookie that raises more then increase the  baking soda or add baking powder. My grandmother used to use all Criso when making sugar cookies. I like using a combination of butter and shortening but using just shortening is possible if you do not want to wait for butter to come to room temperature. This is a good recipe. It's a matter of preference  whether you use Cream of Tarter or not. Personally, to me, it is not a Snickerdoodle without the Cream of Tarter.

They are delicious, but have a slight raw flour taste. I used a 1.5 tbsp scoop, baked at 400 for 8 and then 10 minutes for each pan. Both tasted raw inside and the 10 minute cookies deflated. Not sure what the issue is.

I cut the recipe in half. That will give you one dozen cookies. Are used the same amount of sugar as in the full recipe, but only used 1/2 of the cinnamon. That was just our family likes it.

I liked this recipe a lot. The cookies were a little thinner than I would have liked. The second time I made them, I chilled them for a couple hours and that helped make a thicker chewier cookie.

I made these over the Christmas holidays for my family and they were a BIG hit.  The only change I made was I used the Crisco butter flavored sticks instead of butter and shortening, as someone else had recommended.  I will definitely make these again.  They stay soft if you put a slice of bread in the container with them, as someone else had suggested on this site.  They were very similar to the ones my mother used to make when I was growing up!

These are amazing but I made a few adjustments. I baked at 375 degrees and for 9 minutes -- turning my pan after 4.5 minutes. They looked a little undone when I took them out but they continue cooking on the pan . I also doubled the cinnamon/sugar for rolling.

I really liked this recipe. It was my first time making Snickerdoodles. I stayed on the lower end of baking them for 8 minutes because I found that longer made them crispier and I like a nice soft middle. All in all, I enjoyed the cookies and found they were very easy to make and I followed the recipe exactly :-)

Terrific recipe! I baked with exact ingredients and — after reading some reviews — I only tweaked the  dipping sugar/cinnamon mix, and the temperature. For rolling the cookie balls prior to baking, I meant to add 1 extra Tbl of sugar & 1 tsp. cinnamon, but actually did 3 Tbl. of each. They're delicious this way if you like cinnamon! Not a requirement though. And since Chef Joy's review and a few others cautioned about the cookies getting too crispy if left too long, I first tried 375F for 10 minutes. The first batch came out perfect — rather moist looking on the inside but completely set on the outside. The cookies cook a little more as they cool off. I found 375F for 10 minutes to be  perfect for my oven! They were moist, thick and delicious. We've been eating these cookies around the clock since! Not too sweet, but sweet enough.

Decent recipe, but the temperature was way too high for 8-10 min! The first batch was burned and i had to take them all out early (about 7 min). If you're making this recipe, please turn down the temp to 375° or 350° or take them out early. Other than that, they taste good.

Turned out great on my first try.  Bring butter and eggs to room temp first. Subbed butter for shortening and cut the sugar to 1 cup (I like my cookies less-sugary). The dough balls are very sticky but once covered lightly with the sugar/cinnamon mix, became easier to manipulate and roll out (i did this in a shallow cereal bowl)

These cookies are delicious, and super easy to make - just follow the recipe.  I used a standard size cookie scoop and split each scoop into two equal-sized balls, hand rolled and coated in the cinnamon/sugar mix.  I found that cutting the size in half made for a better snackable size cookie.  I'd give these 4.5 stars because they turned out a little airy/crunchier than I'd prefer - I like my cookies crisp on the outside and chewy/dense on the inside, and I was missing the chewiness factor.  Perhaps because I baked them for a full 8 mins even though I made smaller doodles.  I chalk that up to baker error, and will just reduce the baking time the next time I make them.  Yum!

My mom and I made these today and they were delicious! Soft in the center and a crunch on the edges. They were easy to make and taste great. I did have some left over cinnamon & sugar coating, although that's probably because I used it a little too sparingly on the first batch (I thought I would run out). It made about 29 cookies. They look and taste great.

I made the recipe exactly as written.  My husband loved these snickerdoodles!  Next time I might try using all butter and no shortening just to see if there's a difference in flavor and to save the step of measuring out the shortening.

These are my favorite snickerdoodles! Better than any store- bought by far! 
The only note I would make is, DO NOT use a mixer on this dough! It's already a soft dough, so you don't need to and a mixer will only make the dough softer- too soft to roll in the cinnamon sugar.

This is the exact recipe that I've been using since 1970 from the Betty Crocker Cookbook.   It's the best one I've found so far and slightly UNDER COOKING keeps them really moist!!   =D    (I also raise my own layer hens and the eggs are perfect!) 
Yummy

I have made these cookies a few times and the recipe is so easy and the cookies come out soft and delicious.  I only make a minor change to the sugar/cinnamon mixture- I add 2-3 extra tablespoons of sugar on top of what the recipe suggests.  I am making these for a second year for a Christmas cookie party and they are always such a big hit.

These cookies never let me down,  however I change up the recipe to fit my husband's likes.  First  I don't use shorting just another half cup of butter. 2. I double the vanilla. 3. I don't use cream of tartar  or baking soda instead I use 2 teaspoons baking powder. 4. I use one egg and one egg yolk 5. I bake at 350 for  10 minutes.

I’m honestly not sure what makes this recipe so much better than most (cream of tartar?) - but it is. And you should make it. Perfection if executed as instructed!  No changes or adaptations needed!

I find that refrigerating the dough for an hour or so helps for when you roll the dough, itll keep its shape. :) Amazing recipe!

Absolutely the best recipe. I was taught by my mom to add a Hershey's Chocolate Kiss to the middle of each cookie at the end of the bake time. I leave them in for about 30 seconds then  cool. My house feels like Christmas right now!

I did not make any changes I made them exactly as stated in the recipe    This was my first time making snickerdoodles and my family raved about them! We all cook.  They ended up a little raised but moist inside and crispy on the edges.  I use the small melon Baller to scoop the dough.

I've always loved homemade snickerdoodles but have never made them. OMG. These are very, very good. Slightly crunchy outside, moist inside. And, addictive. Made mine a little big I guess because a batch as written only made 35 cookies.  Well worth the little effort to make. Followed recipe exactly. 1st pan I baked for exactly 8 minutes and 2nd pan for 9 minutes for a touch more crunch on outside. Definitely recommend.

As a couple other reviewers mentioned, if you sift (or weigh) your flour then you should probably add another 1/2 cup (2oz). Otherwise the dough with be more like batter-  a sticky mess resulting in very flat cookies- but they did still taste good! Chilling the dough also helps.

I've never made a snickerdoodle before, and these didn't really come out looking like the pictures - however, they were really tasty and they likely didn't come out because I messed with the recipe. I realized as I was getting into mixing up my butter and shortening that I didn't really have enough white sugar, so I subbed icing sugar in because I had an abundance. As a result I ended up with a cookie ball that was a bit cake-like but it never flattened out. The flavor was fine but the texture would probably cheese off some connoisseurs. I also added a touch of nutmeg to the batter because I like nutmeg (hey I already messed with the recipe once, couldn't stop there) and I did some with cinnamon sugar on the outside and some with cocoa sugar on the outside. When I left it the full 10 minutes of baking it actually cracked open the tops a touch and gave them a pretty neat appearance. Next time I'll try to follow the recipe more directly though, see if they turn out as they should more.

It turned out great! I used some of the tips from other views like switching out the cream of tartar for baking powder, and putting the temp. at 375 and they were delicious. :) I only wish they came out a little puffier. They were puffy coming out but some minutes on the cookie rack they flattened a little.

Delicious! Maybe the best cookie I've ever made. Just like a snickerdoodle should be - soft in the middle, crispy on the edges. Followed the directions exactly - other than scaling up the sugar and cinnamon by an extra tbsp each to make sure there was enough to cover all 48 cookies generously. After reading other reviews made sure my butter and eggs were room temp and creamed the wet ingredients by hand.

Substituted  2tbsp vinegar for the cream of tartar & removed from oven before the cookies were 'well done' (8min was fine). They rose nicely & are even soft & chewy days later!!!

Winner! I followed the recipe as written and baked for 10 min. They turned out great! Baked as an after-game treat for my son's football team and they went over better than any previous cookie.  They were a little flatter than I'd like but the taste was great. Definitely will make again.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written and I was very happy with how they turned out.  The ingredients gave the cookies a great flavor and the 8-minute cook time gave them the soft inside I like in just about any cookie!  Will definitely be making again!

I LOVE snickerdoodle cookies! This recipe did not disappoint. I took them to a family gathering and everyone ate them up! I do have a problem keeping my snickerdoodles from going flat but that's my own problem and after reading other reviews I will try to make them again with fresh baking soda and cream of tartar.

Boyfriend ate half the cookies before we finished cooking them. 8 minutes seems to be the exact amount of time needed to create soft but chewy cookies, not crispy. I substituted butter for the shortening because I don't live in the 1950s. Mine came out flatter than some but that's the way he likes it. I would add baking powder if I wanted puffier cookies.

Don't try this recipe if you do not have cream of tartar. It does not work. Otherwise it would be delicious. The struggle is real.

Practically perfect.  I used a lot more cinnamon and sugar for the coating.  It's a delicate batter for a cookie; take care not to overmix.

I've made Snicker Doodles for 50 years, Blue Ribbon winner every year at our County Fair and they are not flat and NOT soft and chewy! Should be crispy and a bit puffy. No butter, margarine and Cisco.

These were delicious! Not too sweet and perfectly soft and chewy. I followed the recipe exactly as written and I am glad I did. I baked them for 10 mins and took them out as other reviewers advised.. I was tempted to leave them in longer but I didn't and let them cool a bit and they were perfect!!!

I have always avoided Snickerdoodles because I never have shortening but I finally bought some (butter flavor) and got to try them. So glad I did, they were wonderful! The only changes I made was to switch the cream of tartar with white vinegar (same amount) and increase the sugar and cinnamon for the coating. I did also reduce the oven temp by 5 degrees and baked them for 9 minutes (on parchment so they could slide right off my pan and onto wire cooling racks). Very fun to make and delicious!

I’ve never made snickerdoodles before.  I read through the reviews so I was prepared.  I followed the recipe as listed apart from using lemon juice in place of cream of tartar.  The dough was too sticky to roll.  Still tried baking just one cookie for 8 minutes (as I had seen in other reviews) to see what happened.  It flattened out but was still crisp on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle.  Added 1/8 cup of flour.  Figure that lemon juice was additional liquid and may have added to the stickiness.  Decided to refrigerate the dough for 45 minutes which made it a little less sticky.  Didn’t make that much of a difference as far as the cookies getting flat.  Rolled the rest of the dough and put it in the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Then I refrigerated the individual dough balls on a tray.  The dough cooled much faster, was nice and firm, and yielded a much better cookie.  I baked them for exactly 8 minutes, then immediately moved them to a cooling rack.  Cookies weren’t nearly as flat, and were delicious.  Taking them to a party tonight!  I’m sure they’ll be a big hit!  I’ll definitely make them again.

This was my first time making snickerdoodles.. Roll into a ball, then in sugar/cinnamon and repeat! It was worth the extra effort. Mine were cooked using only butter (skipped shortening) at 8 minutes there we done and super yummy!

Recipe does not tell how many cookies to make (I guessed and made 19 medium sized cookies). Had to bake (at 400) for nearly 20 minutes to get them to cook thoroughly and still wasn't enough but I had to take them out because they burnt. Need a lot more clarification for this to be a viable recipe.

These were great.  I highly suggest refrigerating dough for about a half hour to an hour before baking cookies.  This will prevent flat cookies.

I have been making this recipe for years as written. The only sub I now make is to use gluten free flour blend. Sometimes I do refrigerate the dough, other times I don't. I have made them as cookies, cookie pops and even a cookie cake. My family absolutely loves these cookies, they always disappear fast!

So good! I let the eggs and butter sit out until they were room temperature. I mixed everything by hand and mixed the wet ingredients until most of the lumps were gone (2-3 minutes maybe). Added a bit more sugar - about a tablespoon more. I just used a bowl and plunked the balls in and rolled them, they weren't too sticky in my opinion. I baked them for 4 minutes, turned the pan and baked for 5 more minutes. I find with my oven that cookies turn out better when I turn the pan. I let the first batch sit on the pan for maybe a minute, second batch I got impatient and they went onto a cooling rack right away. They didn't fall apart for me but I had to be gentle. Definitely a keeper!

FANTASTIC! After making my dough, I wrapped it and allowed it to chill for about 45 minutes or so before I rolled them and baked them b/c I really wanted to avoid a flat cookie, and that seemed to work well. I also baked mine for exactly 8 minutes and removed them from the pans immediately to cool, which also kept them softer and puffier. These were so easy to make and I will def be using this recipe from now on~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Well it was good provided I lowered the temp to 375 and at 7 minutes. Ruined most of the cookies. Maybe at sea level this is the norm. I usually cook at 2500 feet above sea level.

Perfect snickerdoodle recipe. Make sure your eggs and butter are room temp. I took them both out of the fridge and left them out over night before I made the cookies in the morning. Using my kitchenaid stand mixer, I combined all the dry ingredients together in a separate bowl and slowly added the dry mixture to the wet mixture, making sure it was combined before adding more dry mixture. I used a #20 disher to scoop the dough and only placed 6 cookies on a sheet at a time. I have silpat mats, so I used those. Since I made the cookies larger, I baked them for 10 min. After I took them out of the oven, I left them on the tray for 1 min before transferring to a cooling rack. They turned out perfectly and made 19 cookies.

I made a couple of changes and my office staff loved them. I used 1 cup of butter and no shortening. Replaced the cream of tartar with baking powder and replaced the white sugar with brown sugar. They came out moist and a little sweeter.

I loved the flavor on these!  However, I followed the recipe to a T and they still came out flat...I would suggest refrigerating the dough 10-15 minutes after mixing if you want a regular plump cookie.

These are delicious - one of my favorite cookies. This is exactly like another recipe on here (Snickerdoodles I) except that the other recipe uses all shortening instead of half butter and half shortening. I've made both, and there is not a notable difference. The all shortening ones may be SLIGHTLY whiter and SLIGHTLY better texture, but the difference is so negligible that you could definitely use either. I don't love shortening because it is so unhealthy, so using half butter works fine to make it a little more natural.

I loved this recipe!! My whole family enjoyed it. Just as a tip for anyone without cream of tartar (like I found myself when I made these), you can substitute it for lemon or lime juice! Happy Cooking!!

Snicker doodles are one of my most loved cookies. These turned out perfect. True snicker doodle classic recipe. Because I tested my baking soda and it was flat, I added just a small pinch of baking powder to ensure they weren't flat. They were not flat and crispy on the outside.

I loved this snickerdoodle! But one thing that I wasn't ready for was that they expanded really far out. I might not have read it thoroughly enough but i did not know to place them far apart, I got one blob of cookie instead of a bunch of circles.

I doubled the recipe and added just a little more flour.  I think I used way more sugar and cinnamon to coat than was cited in the ingredients, even after doubling the recipe.  My cookies were flat, but I like a chewier, crispier cookie so the baking soda deal didn't bother me.  I'm taking them to a potluck, and this recipe is one I'll definitely make again.

Super delicious and super easy. I baked them for exactly 8 minutes, regardless of how soft or undercooked they looked when I took them out of the oven.  I immediately put them on a wire cooling rack.  They cooled to chewy perfection!

Alright so I'm kinda a beginner at best with baking. But the idea of snickerdoodles had me excited about trying to make a batch. First batch... me and everything in the kitchen was covered in dough ??. So I got back on and tried again. This time I literally heated the shortening to make it more blended ( I was mixing by spoon not mixer) and I added exactly 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla extract. Once I had it all blended I put the dough into the fridge for half a hour. It firmed up nicely but not hard. So using a ice cream scooper I made my balls to roll around the sugar and cinnamon mixture. Then I cut the ball in half and re rounded the half ball with my hand coated in the sugar and cinnamon for a even coating. Once shaped and placed on my tray I put it in at 400 degrees for exactly 9 minutes.( I had 3 trays total loaded but was only baking one at a time) . Using my plastic  spatula I gently moved the hot cookies to the wire cooling wrack. I had the next batch in and timer set each time between unload. The timing was pretty for letting them cool and transfer to a plate each time. Then the moment of truth.. I tried one and it was perfect! Firm on the outside not hard and soft melts in your mouth center. My spouse took a few to work and had co workers left and right begging for the recipe! I was able to make 20 cookies total and had I cut the balls into thirds I still think they would come out great and sizable. This was a pleasure to make and I think I could make them all day b

EXCELLENT. This is the first time I've made snickerdoodles and they turned out perfectly. I used fresh baking soda and cream of tartar and the cookies turned out fluffy and delicious. I used butter instead of shortening with excellent results. I'll definitely be adding this recipe to my cookbook.

My cookies came out soft, not chewy, and they didn't crack like they should.  I added about 1/4 c extra flour since the batter was so loose.  They tasted like they should, just didn't look like they should.  Still cooking, so maybe I'll figure out why they aren't cracking.

These cookies will blow your mind. Do not over bake, I do 8 minutes every time and they turn out chewy and delicious with a little crispy around the edges. My husband goes nuts for these, and his sweet tooth isn't quite as sweet as mine. Great hit at a party too. I've made these many times and the recipe never fails.

These are the bomb....Thank you for a wonderful recipe. The only thing I did different was using 1cup butter and omitting the oil. Baked exactly 8 minutes and removed from oven immediately. I also added a cup of chopped pecans in the batter. I also  used 3Tablesoonful of sugar and 3.5 teaspoonful cinnamon in a baggie coating the balls well.
I know these will not last long round here! Thanks again!

Melt in your mouth cookies. Mine needed exactly 10' on parchment on an aluminum baking sheet. I used Tung Hing cinnamon which is assertive so I recommend adding another tablespoon of sugar into the rolling mix. And double the salt. :D

These are AMAZING! My kids and I loved these and they came out perfectly. I had to use Blue Bonnet Light and Ener-G egg replacer due to food allergies. I also used  the butter shortening rather than regular shortening just because that's what I had. They were fluffy and perfectly cooked when cooking for 8 minutes (thank you to the reviewer who said that). These will be made A LOT at my house.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

I've never liked making snickerdoodles as I don't necessarily care for the taste, but I must say that these are pretty delicious. I made half a batch as I was testing the recipe. I'm not a fan of shortening, so I used all unsalted butter. That was the only substitution I made to the recipe. I like soft cookies, so I baked them at 375 for 8 minutes on cookie sheets lined with baking mats. They could've used another minute or two as they were too soft, although completely cooked through as I left them on the sheets for 5-10 minutes. Baking them at 400 for 8 minutes may also be a remedy. Either way, the taste is phenomenal, and everyone who's tried them has raved. I did find the dough to be a little sticky, so I put it in the fridge a short while before rolling them in the cinnamon sugar. I used 1.5T of sugar and 1.5t of cinnamon, and it was perfect. This recipe is a definite keeper. Thank you!

Made it exactly as written. They turned out nicely. I love snickerdoodle, but this just didn't really do it for me. They also hardened pretty quickly, so I'd reduce the time a little bit.

My favorite cookies.  Only change: using my finger I indented the middle of the dough after arranging cookie dough on baking sheet.   This kept the dough from spreading as much making the cookie thicker and "gooder" :)

I follow the recipe with only the addition of a little extra vanilla.  Baking these for the minimum amount of time - when the tops just start to crack - leaves these with crisp edges and chewy centers.  I bring a double batch of these to work and by the end of the shift they are usually completely gone :) I get nothing but compliments every time, and I refer people back to this recipe.

I've made these several times and they are always a sure fire hit! I follow the recipe to the letter, no substitutions needed in my opinion. As a matter of fact these cookies were the only thanksgiving dinner food that wasn't left over the next day... high praise, indeed.

I will definitely make these again! I have an oven with a "Speed Bake" setting, basically a fan, works like convection. I  used the Speed bake setting, baked at 385 degrees for 8 minutes on cookie sheet lined in parchment paper. I let them cool on the cookie sheet. The edges were crispy, middles chewy...perfect!  I also used all butter, no shortening.

I think this is an excellent recipe.  I have made it several times now and it turns out perfect every time.  I make freezer dough so that my husband can cook off a few cookies at a time when he wants them and this recipe works great for that.

Scrumptious! Followed the rec as is until the end. This is a fluffy cookie dough and quite yummy even unbaked. I did refrigerate before rolling because I was finishing up baking some chocolate chip cookies, but then I kept it out in between batches and it rolled just fine. The only tweet I had to make was rolling the dough in a mixture of powdered sugar and cinnamon instead of granulated because I ran out. The cookies themselves are so good, just like my memories of childhood snickerdoodles. They puff up while baking and do flatten a bit after they cool but I found if I baked them an extra min they retained a little of the  rise. Either way they are exactly what I want in a snickerdoodle. Can't wait to try w granulated sugar

These were exactly what I was hoping for!!  What a delicious cookie ..... I even had to hide half of them from hubby so I'd have more for later!  No changes, for me - they were nearly perfect.  I live at high altitude, so that may have affected the cook time, but the puffiness and all-around goodness are worth the time and trouble.

I made them and they turned out good, a little bit too sweet and they weren't flat cookies like the pictures they were pretty big.

Came out perfect!!! I cooked mine for exactly 10 minutes and it came out perfectly crunchy on the edges and soft in the middle. That's the best way for a cookie to be.

Pretty good, but I kind of have a personal vendetta against shortening. I took it out, use only 1 teaspoon of cream of tartar, and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. Turns out soft and fluffy in the center and melts in the mouth.

The cookies were delicious, but I had been planning on taking them to a neighbor and despite following directions exactly AND only baking for 8 minutes, the bottoms were black. I guess we will just have to enjoy them haha!

Crispy outside, soft inside! Used all butter (no shortening). Made large cookies (400degrees for 9 min), so got 27 out of the batch. Takes me back to what my Grandma made; thank you for the recipe!

Delicious! Cinnamon fans will adore these. My family are just so-so about cinnamon but still enjoyed these cookies, so I can only imagine how well these go over with cinnamon lovers. I made as written with no substitutions or changes.

Absolutely divine. I have made these multiple times and have not been disappointed yet. I use a cookie scoop to get perfectly portioned cookies and drop them into a ziplock bag with the cinnamon sugar mixture. Toss a few times for the perfect coating. I set the timer for exactly 8 minutes,  and not a second longer. They may look slightly undercooked, but they'll be perfect upon cooling.

When I was in the 5th grade I spent months perfecting my Snickerdoodle recipe and won grand champion at the county fair and then went on to win grand champion at the state fair. Somehow over the years the recipe was lost but these come pretty close! I threw away the recipe I had been using when I tried this one. These cookies are amazing!

Very good. Soft and chewy. 8 minutes seems perfect. A little more work than just drop cookies, so I would really need a craving to make these, but the ingredients are always on hand.

Just excellent. I used 1 tsp lemon juice instead of cr.of tartar as other suggested. Also - I like mine slightly chewier - never met a crispy cookie I liked so I baked them for 6 mins, flatten them a bit with a small push with a spatula .... 2 more minutes then let them to set up on the cookie sheet before the transfer.
Delicious... thanks to our grandmothers for this recipes.

You don't need shortening or cream of tartar to make good snickerdoodles! These ones are great and i placed them in the oven for 12 minutes instead of 10 minutes! Best snickerdoodles I've tried!!!

This was a great recipe! I only gave it four instead of five because I did make a couple changes. As others suggested, I used three tbsp of sugar and three tsp of cinnamon at the end. Also, I substituted the butter for coconut oil. I made one batch with the butter and one with coconut oil and the coconut ones were more chewy and had a better flavor (in my and my family's opinion). Will definitely make again!

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for. I did however follow the advice of a couple of reviews. The first was to use room temp egg and butter. The second was to use baking powder instead of cream of tartar if you want a puffier cookie or you just don't have cream of tartar. It worked out great!!  One thing I think would have made my cookies better was to REALLY coat them in cinnamon & sugar. I was afraid to over coat, don't be afraid! This is one of the best cookies I have ever made.

Simply the best Snickerdoodle. I used all butter without compromising the recipe.

These were easy to make. I followed another's suggestion and put the sugar/cinnamon mix in a ziplock bag to make it easier. They turned out beautiful and fluffy. I was surprised that they were not sweeter. However, for people who favor less-sweet desserts, they were a HUGE hit. I will definitely make these again; they were a nice break from my usual chocolate chip cookies.

I've made this recipe of snickerdoodles several times, using new store bought ingredients. It has been a few years and I decided to make it again, and I wondered why they came out flat all the time. I even showed the batter before baking it the second time. The difference was between butter and margarine. They will not be flat using margarine at all

These cookies are great, but I don't like the cream of tartar after taste, and the 1st batch I made came out kind of flat even though all of the ingredients were brand new and I tested the cream of tartar and baking soda to make sure they weren't flat.   For the second batch I took out about a tablespoon of egg white, used 1 cup of butter instead of shortening, and substituted 2 teaspoons of baking powder for the cream of tartar and baking soda.  Cooked for about 8 minutes and they were awesome!   Nice and puffy and chewy with no after taste!

This is the recipe my grandmother used for many years!  If you really want them to be crunchy outside and soft
Inside, be sure to refrigerate dough for at least an hour before baking. Know your oven too.
Mine were done in 9 minutes and when they are done they don't look quite done.
Leave them on the baking tray 2-3
Minutes and they will be perfect when transferred to the cooling racks!

Without a doubt, this is the best recipe for Snickerdoodle Cookies I have ever made. Everyone gave it a two thumbs up!!!
Note: The key was to chill the dough and quickly form a 1 1/4" ball...(They won't rise if you handle them too much.) If you want a soft center, do NOT over bake them. Another hint is to be sure you bake them on a cool cookie tin. I have done quite a few snickerdoodles over years and this one is by far my favorite. Simply delicious!

Follow this recipe exactly, and it comes out perfect every time.  We've made it four times in two months.  Better double the batch automatically because they are eaten up faster than you can make it.  We made a quadruple batch once.  Fantastic!

I just made the first batch of this recipe. They turned out great! Followed the recipe exactly. So easy! Crispy around the edges and soft in the middle. They're nice and thick, did not flatten out! Delicious! I will definitely make these again!

Excellent cookies.  I had to reduce the time so the cookies didn't become to hard! Secret: to keep cookies soft, place them in a sealed container with several slices of white bread. Then seal, the bread will dry out be cookies stay soft!

I followed the recipe exactly. With such a high rating I was very excited, but these were very bland. They tasted of flour with a bitter aftertaste from the cream of tartar. I tried to save them by placing a chocolate kiss in the center, but I can't even get my kids to eat them. Disappointed.

After some tinkering over the 50 or so times I've made this recipe, I've finally got it perfect!
-Replace all the butter with plain Crisco vegetable shortening (not butter flavored).
-Increase vanilla extract by 1.5x, and add half a teaspoon cinnamon into the dough
-Chill the dough for a couple hours before scooping and baking,
-Bake until they're JUST set for the traditional soft snickerdoodle style
It's also VERY important that the cream of tartar and baking powder is super fresh!  Fantastic recipe, everyone I know loves them.

I only used butter, 1/2 salted, 1/2 unsalted. I also had to substitute white vinegar for tartar, but added a teaspoon of baking powder. I also added a cup of white chocolate chips. My husband and boys asked when am I going to make them again.

I didn't know what snickerdoodles were, but had heard of them.  I didn't have cream of tarter, so used the lemon juice instead.  It was easy to make, not flat, turned out perfect.  We liked the cookie, but didn't love it.  I would make it again though.

This is the only Snickerdoodle recipe you need, ever! I took the advice of another rater and reduced the egg whites just a bit to create the fluffiest cookie possible. I also subbed baking powder for the cream of tartar. This is my most requested cookie by far. I even had a  friend say that this cookie brings them right back to their childhood. Now that's pure happiness right there!

Hallo!  
For the past few years, I had been making Betty Crocker's snickerdoodles for Christmas family gatherings.  This year, however, I wanted to try something different.  
I used this recipe, and it turned out nicely.  The reason why I gave this only four stars was because I probably overcooked them.  I was fooled by their pale colour and, not wanting to give anyone food poisoning, cooked them three minutes longer than suggested.  The flavor was fine, but the cookies on the top shelf were a bit crunchy.
Overall, lovely recipe!

These were delicious.  I will definitely make them again. I don't bake with shortening, so I never have it on hand. I used butter instead, which I thought would have made the cookies spread more, but they didn't seem to do that. They are crispy, however, but that's how I like my cookies.

I used this recipe exactly, placed the round balls in a mini muffin tin and pressed the centers slightly with the bottom of my large wooden spoon, after they were cooked, I placed a refrigerated Hershey Kiss in the center of each one. They were a hit!

Made these while at my Dad's home.  No shortening and no cream of tartar so I substituted 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil and then 2 teaspoons of lemon juice.  Cookies turned out delicious. Soft in the middle and a little crusty on the outside.

WOW! I came home from work to find that my 15 year old son made these all by himself.  He has never made cookies on his own before.  They were fantastic! Absolutely perfect! I wouldn't change a single thing.  Wonderful looks, texture, and flavor, these cookies are amazing.

Excellent recipe. The cookie base has endless possibilities! I used vanilla bean paste in place of extract and used a little more cinnamon in the cinnamon sugar mix.

These are great snickerdoodles. They are soft and chewy in the middle and lightly crisp along the edges, just the way I like them.

Like many of the other reviewers, I made up more of the cinnamon/sugar mixture so I could coat the cookies really well. I also used all butter - no shortening.

Using parchment paper on the cooking sheet allows you to  slide the paper with all of the cookies right off the cookie sheet and onto the cooling rack. No damaged cookies!

I've tried another recipe for Snickerdoodles, and that previous recipe was fluffier, less crispy, and a bit more sweet (in a good way).

Perfect snickerdoodle recipe. I don't keep shortening in the house so I made it with either all butter or all margarine. I find I do have to chill the dough if I make it with margarine otherwise it's too messy to roll. I usually have to add extra flour, at least a 1/2 cup more but I just go until the dough is the right consistency. I make a variation with 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, almond extract, and 1/4- to 1/2 cup blended glace cherries that everyone says is amazing.

These were delicious. However, most of them baked flat.  I chilled the first batch for 10 minutes. I baked the others without chilling them.  Of the 4 dozen, only 6 rose a tad. I will try them again and see if they come out differently. Thanks for sharing.

This is a fantastic recipe. I would give it five stars because it is nearly perfect, but I did have to alert it slightly. After reading everyone's reviews about them coming out flat, I took note of how wet the dough was once everything was mixed together. It was way too wet so I think I ended up adding another half cup of flour nearly. 
I also only had about ¼ cup shortening on hand, so I replaced the other ¼ cup with refined coconut oil. 
I didn't have cream of tartar so I replaced it and the baking soda with baking powder.
The end product was AMAZING!!! Perfect size, shape, taste, texture, just perfect. I'll be adding a photo shortly.

Wow, this recipe did not disappoint!  The only tricky part for me was deciding how long to bake them. I followed one reviewer's advice about baking them only 8 minutes, and that turned out to be the best option - EVEN THOUGH they would not lift off the sheet in one piece when I tried to transfer them to the cooling rack right away. I left another batch in for 9 minutes, but they crisped up after cooling so they were not as melt-in-your-mouth chewy in the center like the "raw" 8-minute batch.  So in my case, with my oven, it's 8 minutes and leave them on the pan for a few minutes until they hold together. Hope this helps others!

I made these with Bob's red Mill all purpose flour and soy free butter due to food allergies.  I was a little skeptical due to the difference in flours. The cookies however turned out wonderful!  So thankful they were good so My son and I can enjoy our favorite cookies again!

This is my go to Snickerdoodle recipe.  I was also plagued by flat cookies until I started refrigerating the dough before baking.  Perfect, puffed up Snickerdoodles.  I chill the dough for about 30-45 minutes, then make the balls and roll them in the cinnamon sugar and then return them to the fridge while the oven is heating.  I just take out and bake a dozen at a time.  It's also helpful to have two cookie sheets you rotate so one can completely cool before it is used again.

5 star cookies! However the recipe as written would get 4 stars. I'm not sure why the author is adding cream of tartar and baking soda instead of just baking powder. The two main uses of cream of tartar are to stabilize egg whites or to combine it with baking soda to create baking powder. So if your CoT is bad (it doesn't usually go bad but it's one of those things that sits in the cupboard for months or longer without use) skip it and use baking powder for a more reliable result.

you definitely have to check your baking supplies..  Old Soda and products make bad baking !   Mine come out at exactly 9 minutes and I scoop them off quick... they are soft and chewy and they disappear !    I use pure vanilla or good bourbon vanilla and it boosts the flavor

My high school son made these.  Excellent! Ran short on white flour; used 2 c white plus 3/4c whole wheat and they turned out just fine!  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

These cookies are great! I have baked them numerous times and every time they turn out chewy, cinnamon-y, and delicious. If you are like me and like your snickerdoodles to be extra cinnamon-y; you will need more cinnamon sugar than the recipe says. I will definitely bake these again and again! Enjoy!

I didn't make any changes.  I gave this a 5 star rating because of the ease of which to put this together and the taste is out of this world.  However the batter was very sticky to work with but overall this is gggreatttt!!! Thank you for your snickerdoodles.

I've never actually had this type of cookie but these are really awesome! I didn't have shortening so I used all butter and my dough was kind of sticky. I popped it in the fridge for an hour and got sick of waiting so I plopped the kind of sticky dough in the cinnamon/sugar mix in a bowl and rolled it in a ball that way. I misread the measurements on cinnamon and sugar though and did equal parts cinnamon and sugar but they still turned out great.

I will definitely make these again.  They are delicious!  I used 1 and 1/4 cup of sugar instead of one and a half.  I may cut more next time because they are rolled in sugar.  I also listened to several reviewers and increased both the sugar and cinnamon .

Fabulous. Baked for 9 minutes and BE SURE to transfer to cooling rack IMMEDIATLEY. If left on the baking sheet to cool they will flatten. I did drain a tiny bit of each egg white before adding to mixture as one had suggested.  I tossed in ziplock bag with sugar/cinnamon coating. Very soft great appearance.

These are so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, even made a trip to the store just for cream of tartar because it really does add that special something that just makes it a snickerdoodle. I only got 36 cookies out of mine, but I prefer them to be a little big larger, and they were only in the oven for 8 minutes. They come out looking a bit underdone but finish setting while they cool and they are perfect, crispy around the edges but nice and soft in the middle!

I've made this recipe multiple times for my family, and every time they never last more than 24 hours! I've even gotten my friends hooked! 
I use coconut oil instead of shortening and it just gives it this light coconutty flavor, and that nutty sweetness. It's amazing. Also, I let the batter sit in the fridge for about 45 minutes before rolling them in the sugar. It helps them stay nice and fluffy.

Snickerdoodles are my husband's favourite cookie, so I make this recipe about once a month and have been for years now. I make the following changes: use all butter, reduce sugar to 1 cup, replace cream of tartar with 1 tablespoon white vinegar. These cookies are fabulous!

Very delicious.  Fluffy- I made bigger cookies and cooked for 10 minutes- I should have let them cool on pan for 5 minutes I think because doughy (but delicious) in center.

Oh man these are addicting! First time baking snickerdoodles and I lucked out with a fantastic and easy recipe. We ate the cookies so fast that I already need to make another batch ;)

Loved these!  So easy to make...if you have someone helping you otherwise they can be time consuming.   I used butter instead of shortening.  I used my pampered chef cookie scooper and rolled them into balls while my husband coated them.  I increased the coasting to 3 T sugar and 3 tsp cinnamon and it was perfect.  Put this in a ziplock bag and coated them that way.  Cooked for 8 min. on convection.  Made 41 cookies (some batter was eaten along the way) ??

These were very good, just a bit too sweet. I used butter flavored shortening and needed the full 10 minutes to get the crispy edges and soft centers the way we like them. Next time the only change I will make is to reduce the amount of sugar in the dough by three tablespoons.

These cookies are perfectly crispy on the edges and soft and chewy in the center. I used all butter in place of half shortening and we loved them!

Follow the directions and they turn out perfectly! My only change is the cinnamon sugar mixture is a bit strong so I reduce the cinnamon a bit, maybe half a teaspoon.

Fantastic Snickerdoodle recipe!! I made it exactly as written, adding the wet ingredients first, used a hand mixer with whipping paddles to get the wet ingredients creamy & fluffy. Then kept the paddles on to incorporate the dry ingredients. The dough came out smooth, I turned it out onto wax paper, rolled it up & let it chill in the fridge for an hour before making the dough balls and tossing in the cinnamon sugar. The dough was so smooth, not sticky at all and rolled out like silk. Pressed down each ball with a fork before placing in the oven, came out PERFECT!! I made larger cookies and still got 46 cookies out of this recipe! Awesome recipe! Will continue to use this from now on! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe gets 5 stars in terms of flavor!

However the batter was really really sticky and hard to role into balls, so I popped it into the fridge for 2 hours and it rolled much easier!

Followed the recipe exactly and they came out great! Chilled the dough for less than an hour while we had dinner. Then I used a 2 tsp. scoop and after rolling in sugar I pressed them lightly with a fork for that classic Snickerdoodle look.  They were perfectly done at 8 minutes with the slightly chilled dough. I haven't loved past Snickerdoodle recipes I've tried but these are spectacular.

I have to agree with the other negative ratings on this recipe. I followed the recipe to a "T" and they didn't spread out or flatten at all, so they were just round balls after baking, just the same as when they first went  into the oven. They had a very acid taste to them, if they had any flavor at all.  Very floury tasting. I love Snickerdoodles and have made them before, but this recipe was very disappointing.

Snickerdoodles are my FAVORITE...and this recipe is fantastic to use as a guide.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and was not thrilled with the outcome...edible, but not remarkable.  They were still puffy - not very crispy. (Three stars.) 
  I just made them again with a couple of changes - I used all butter - no shortening.  I also double the amount of sugar in the coating and tripled the cinnamon.  After rolling the cookies - I flattened them a bit with the bottom of a glass because I prefer a crispier cookie.   They were the best snickerdoodles ever!

The perfect snickerdoodle!  Made exactly as the recipe called for. Only small difference was that I slightly flattened the balls of dough a bit because my oven tends to burn easily. They were wonderful!  Took them out when they puffed up and cracked, but felt slightly firm to the touch and immediately removed them (parchment paper and all) to a marble cooling slab to rest. Crunchy edges with a firm yet still chewy center.  Will be keeping this one as my only snickerdoodle recipe from now on!  Thanks!

I love these cookies, it's the first time I've ever had a snickerdoodle and I'm planning to make another batch already! They were a big hit with my parents and I probably ate WAY too many, but I'm extremely happy with this recipe. 10/10!

These are so good. A little too good, making me want to eat far too many of them. They're a standard on my Christmas cookie list and are always well-received. I make them exactly as listed, no tweaks. I'll definitely make these again and again.

Wonderfully easy cookie to make.  Don't be discouraged if you don't have cream of tartar, baking soda is a substitute and the cookies turned out wonderful, don;t over bake and remove from the pan as the directions instruct.

I can't even remember the last time I baked cookies (I'm a cook, not a baker), but the grandkids were coming to visit and a granny *has* to have cookies for her grandkids. This recipe was very easy to follow, and the cookies were a big hit--my granddaughter, who previously would only eat chocolate chip cookies, even told me these cookies were delicious! I made two changes: I used white whole-wheat flour instead of AP flour and turbinado sugar instead of white sugar. Because turbinado sugar crystals are larger than white sugar crystals, I ended up using 4 T of sugar with the 2 tsp of cinnamon to roll the cookies in. I followed another reviewer's advice to bake the cookies for 9 minutes exactly, and the cookies turned out wonderfully chewy and delicious. I will definitely make these again!

This is now my go-to snickerdoodle recipe. I love the combo of cinnamon and sugar, and the gooey cookie inside. I vaguely remember a friend showing this recipe to me about five years ago, and always wondered where she got the recipe. Now I know: the amazing Allrecipes.com.

These are, hands down, 100% the BEST snickerdoodles I have ever tasted! I halved the recipe, because there are only two of us, and I'm so glad I did, because we would have eaten all 48 cookies by ourselves! (As is, I'm frightened by how quickly we're going through 24....)

Super easy. Mine seemed really sticky when I started to bake them... I worried I needed more flour or something, but they turned out perfectly! : )

This is a fantastic recipe!  I live at 8,200 feet in the Rockies so I have to always make changes.  I decrease the sugar by 2 tablespoons and increase the flour about oh 1/8 to 1/4 of a cup.  I will also add 2 tablespoons of water to keep it from being too dry.  These worked great up here at this alltitude.  Now here is the change I had to make because I was out of shortening.  I used coconut oil in place of it.  The conversion was like 4 to 3.  I used about 1/3 cup of coconut oil.  It does change the taste a smidgeon but my daughter didn't know I did it and she asked me if I had added oatmeal to them.  Just a little FYI.  She still is eating them great and the hubster loves them too.

Snickerdoodle perfection! The only change I made was to add a smidge of cinnamon (perhaps 1/4 - 1/2 tsp.) to the flour, etc.  And for the best flavor, use a GOOD QUALITY cinnamon.

I didn't have shortening or cream of tartar. Found out that I could substitute. I made a batch for 2 dozen, not 4 dozen. 

So 1:1 shortening for butter, and it's very soft and the edges were still very nice and crispy. 

And since baking powder = baking soda + cream of tartar
I put in 1.5 tsp of baking powder to replace both ingredients.

Glad I read the other reviews to take it out even if it seemed like it was still gooey. It settled well on the rack. I also did 3T sugar and 1tsp cinnamon to coat in a plastic sandwich bag. Really great suggestions!

The only thing would be that mine are pretty darn sweet, so maybe next time I'll put a little more flour. Hopefully this doesn't become a regular thing or I'm going to get diabetes! Lol!

Perfect Snickerdoodle recipe! These turned out perfectly and the taste, oh the taste! I followed the recipe exactly except I used butter flavored shortening instead of regular shortening which I think added nicely to the recipe. Very easy recipe, baked with 3 kids under 9 and they all had a ball! They especially loved rolling the balls in the cinnamon/sugar mixture. We made ours very heaping spoonfulls so we would have good sized cookies and cooking them the full 10 minutes worked out perfect. If you are doing average sized cookies then the 8-9 minutes would probably be the right time.

I didn't make any changes other than cutting the recipe in half,
that was a mistake only because I could have eaten more.
Great recipe! Full recipe makes over 2 doz. made several times, I've flattened and left in balls, ball are slightly thicker, cook 8 min.

I did not make any changes. They were AMAZING as is. I did use butter as a substitute for shortening, but I think it may taste better than shortening myself.

I followed the recipe exactly and just didn't care for the taste of these. Despite adding a bit of additional baking soda, the cookies were flat. They were soft enough, but pretty much tasteless. I did check my baking soda to ensure it was fresh, so that wasn't an issue. Disappointed in these.

Update: I made these again at my husband's request. I once again added an additional 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda in an attempt to create a fluffier cookie. Something else that I noticed this time around was the importance of dropping small spoonfuls of dough onto the cookie sheets. I tend to make my cookies a bit larger (personal preference), but these cookies turn out a lot better if they are smaller. The instructions don't specify how large or small each spoonful of dough needs to be. If you're making these cookies too big, they are more likely to flatten out. Try adding the additional baking soda and dropping a small teaspoon size ball of dough for each cookie. They actually puffed up this time and looked more like a traditional cookie. The taste is still bland, but my husband likes them, so I'll probably make them again for him.

the bEST snickerdoodles!! mine did not flatten at all. I rolled them into Perfect balls and baked it like that, and for 9 mintues. I took if off as fast as I could and put it into a wire rack. I ate one right as soon as it came out of the oven and it was a bit raw. I let it set and it was perfect! Idk if this makes a difference, but I actually used margarine because I don't have butter on hand and I had my eggs and butter sitting out for a few hours to become room temp! And don't melt your butter because when I put it in the microwave my cookies became flat...

I've made these several times now and they are great!  Each time I've made them exactly as written and haven't had problems.  I find they bake quickly- 8mins does it!  Pull them out, let them rest a minute or so, then transfer to wire rack.  (I always use parchment paper!)  They're not an overly sweet cookie so you can be generous with the coating.

I've made this recipe multiple times and never had a problem with it. I follow it exactly (might have added a bit more vanilla than instructed but that never hurt anyone ;p) and each time it just gets better and better. The only thing is make sure your butter is SOFTENED not MELTED.

It was perfect! I topped it with extra cinnamon and baked it for 8 minutes and they turned out puffy and perfect. Also, as suggested by another reviewer, I took out a little of the egg white to make sure it was fluffy!

A perfect cookie with a delicate crisp exterior and a rich, melt-in-your mouth center.  I used all butter (shortening in cookies is disgusting), and a new/fresh container of cream of tartar.   Remove them from the oven when they look "slightly" undercooked, let them set, and they will be amazing.

Delicious! I like to get stoned so I always use this recipie when making my edibles. I just switch out the 1/2 C of butter and 1/2C of shortening for a 1/2 C of decarboxylated hash oil and a 1/2 C of coconut oil.  Would definitely reccomend this recipie to others!! Big hit

This was a great recipe! The only change I made, other than not using exact measurements for the cinnamon/sugar, was that I doubled the recipe, but did not have enough shortening, so I used more butter in place of half of the shortening.  The cookies were soft inside, and lightly crispy outside! Perfect!

By for the best snickerdoodle recipe! I followed the directions according to the recipe. I baked them at 400 degrees for 8 minutes exactly. They raised perfectly, and were crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. If I were to change anything, I might reduce the cinnamon by a 1/2 teaspoon and not use the cheap dollar brand, because the cinnamon turned up almost black.

These cookies are a HUGE hit with everyone! I like to add caramel chips and turn them into toffeedoodle cookies. Its hard to stir in an entire bag of caramel chips but trust me, you will love them!

Very easy recipe! I even substituted the flour for a gluten free one, and the butter and shortening with vegan versions, and they came out very tasty! I did add a splash of almond milk to moisten the dough a bit since the first dozen came out a tiny bit dry, but that is probably due to the change in flour. Overall loved the recipe. It was very easy and anyone can do it. Definitely would make it again!

I used all butter (no shortening) so I expected a flat cookie... but I after the rave reviews for this recipe I did not expect such a bland cookie!! These were just plain boring. I don't know what all the fuss is about, I will not make these again.

I've made this recipe several times and always get rave reviews. I don't use any other recipe for snickerdoodles!  Make sure to use fresh baking soda and cream of tartar or the cookies won't turn out right!

These turned out perfect.  I didn't change anything except I didn't have cream of tartar.  I replaced the cream of tartar and baking soda with 3 tsp of baking powder.  The cookies were fluffy and not flat at all.  Will make again!

Beautiful and scrumptious! Easy to make and always a crowd pleaser. I chilled my dough overnight and baked for 8 min. I got them off the cookie sheets and onto a cooling rack pretty quickly as well.  I posted a photo, so you can see how they came out  If you have trouble with cookies spreading, it's often the butter being too warm/soft. Other possibility is over-mixing...mix just until the dry ingredients are incorporated. It is ideal to whisk your eggs before adding to butter/sugar mixture and also whisk to sift the dry ingredients - that way you don't have to mix the batter so much to get it all to incorporate. Also, greasing the cookie sheet can cause spread.  Thoroughly chilling the dough helps minimize spreading as well. Hope these tips help! It's a great recipe!

First time ever making snicker doodles and they turned out great! I made a few substitutions for things I didn't have on hand (coconut oil instead of shortening and white wine vinegar instead of cream of tartar), so I was a little worried that they would turn out flat, but they were thick and fluffy and super yummy! Will definitely make again. :)

Followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect!!!  As others has said, bake them exactly 8 minutes -- I took them out of the oven and let them stay on the cookie sheet for another 1-2 minutes before transferring to cooking racks… they turned out perfect -- soft & chewy on the inside and crispy on the edges.  A great, quick cookie for when you need something quick & easy.  Will definitely be making these again.

Our favorite cooky and this recipe is over the top delicious.  Soft and yummy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  I make a large batch, freeze on  cooky sheets, then put in freezer bags.  We take a few out when wanting a treat.  BAke at 375 (because frozen) for 9 minutes.  Delicious!

Very yummy and easy to make, needed to be baked for about 12 min, not 8-10, and I added an extra 1/4 cinnamon to make it extra cinnamony.

I was skeptical about this recipe since everyone says their recipe is the best. However, this one truly is! I've tried numerous snickerdoodle recipes and this is the best by far. I substituted 4 tsp. of lemon juice for the cream of tartar since mine was really old. I wish I had known about that years ago! I am throwing out all of my other snickerdoodle recipes.

These cookies were the best!  But suggestion,  do not use shortening.  Just use 1 cup of flour.  And exactly 8 minutes was perfect.  We are at like 6000-7000 feet altitude and they were fine.  Chewy and delish!

These cookies are a bit tricky for me. When you take them out of the oven, be sure to take them out aright after they begin cracking and let them set before you take them off the cookie sheet. They'll be soft and just a little crispy on the outside. If you wait until they brown, they will be crunchy like boxed cookies. Either way they're yummy!

These turned out perfect. They are exactly the way I like cookies. They spread out just right. Actually mine probably spread out more than others because I always use 100% butter simply because I do not care for shortening.  But. They are perfect. Yummy!! Oh and by the way, they did not spread out too much, just right, as I mentioned before.

I love snicker doodle cookies, instead of shortening (let's face it not everyone  has  shortening on hand) I used 1tablespoon  of sour cream , it has a  bland flavor so it will  not  interfere with the cookies  flavor like yogurt would cream cheese is a bit too thick.

These are Doo-Licious.. look for no other recipe. these are foolproof even my kids can make them. I bake them often for both family and when catering. Customers are most delighted by the new flavour I have introduced them too. Snickerdoodles are not a common bikkie in Australia. So pleased I found this recipe. My husband alone can eat a whole batch with his coffee..  To have them fluffy, its simple, just don't press them down much when on the tray..

Best recipe ever! Make sure your ingredients are fresh and this one is golden! also do not over bake these ones, I usually air on the side of caution and bake them lightly and allow to cool a minute before removing from the sheets, people love these.

I have been making another snickerdoodle recipe for years and never got any good reviews from my husband.  My son and husband both loved this recipe and couldn't stop eating them.

Yummy and so soft! I followed the recipe exact although I had to add more flour because the dough wasn't the right consistency for cookies. I cooked them for exactly 8 min like other reviews stated and took the cookies off the pan on a rack to cool as well came out really well. Will def keep this one for the books!

YUM!! I followed the recipe to a "T" and they came out perfectly. Add cinnamon and sugar to a bag and toss the rolled dough in - makes it super easy to coat them. Bake for exactly 8 minutes and voila! My first time making snickerdoodles with my 7 year old and we had a blast. The recipe yielded enough for us to deliver holiday cookies to all of our neighbors!

Made as instructed, and cooked for only 8 minutes.  Additional cook time makes it less chewy.  It is difficult to tell when it's "ready," so we pulled them out after 8.  Great cookie and very simple to make.

I made these for Santa.  We ran out of the sugar-cinnamon mixture (my teenager really coated them), so we used Christmas sprinkles.  They turned out adorable!

Made as directed and used freshly opened baking soda. Did pull first batch out of the oven at 8 minutes and left on cookie sheet for 2.  second was 9 minutes in oven and 1 on sheet then pulled. Either way, these were amazing and best snickerdoodles Ive had. Thank you!

Cook for 8 min. exactly!  Even if they look underdone take them out.  Otherwise they flatten and become "snickerdoodle crisps."  I substituted the same amount of coconut oil for the shortening being careful to add it to room temperature ingredients.

Made the mistake of listening to a reviewer and used 2tsp baking powder in replace of the baking soda and tartar. BIG MISTAKE!! Cookies turned out much too cakey for my liking. Has excellent flavor otherwise. Will definitely be making again without the substitutions.

I first ran across these in _Farm Journal's Homemade Cookies_ about 40 years ago, and I'm so happy to see it here, where it won't get lost!  Family and friends gobble these up. I'm making a double batch today for Xmas giving.

In addition to the cinnamon, I use  1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp cloves ( or 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice) for extra spicy cookies.

Great cookies! Some good tips are to roll them in the sugar cinnamon mixture not sprinkle it over. Because you will only get cinnamon and not sugar. Another is not to bake them all the way. You want to leave them just a bit gooey so there not hard. Last but not lest leave them in a zip lock bag for an hour or two and they will get really soft.

I've never made snickerdoodles before and the only reason I am now is at my husband's request. The only thing I didn't like was the dough was very sticky. Other than that - wow! I wish I'd discovered these years ago! Absolutely delicious!

These really are the best snicker doodles I have ever made. Terrific cinnamon taste, crisp edge an soft middle. My son said they taste like cinnamon crunch cereal (without the crunch). He wanted to crumble them in a bowl and pour milk on them to eat like cereal.

I decided to give this recipe a try over my old snickerdoodle recipe.  These are by far the BEST snickerdoodles I've ever made.  I won't go back to my old recipe ever again.  I followed the recipe exactly.  After 9 minutes, they arae nicely crisp on the outside and perfectly soft and chewy inside.  Thank you!

Yummy!  Be sure to remove the cookies immediately from the baking sheet, or they will stick as they cool down.

This is the best cookie recipe I've ever found. Cook for exactly 8 minutes and they're perfect. I add gold sugar crystals (the decorative ones) to the cinnamon sugar. They sparkle a little and have an awesome extra crunch. They always taste amazing and look beautiful. They also freeze well after cooking. I will make these every year for Christmas for as long as I have an oven! Thank you for posting!

I have made these a couple times now, and they've turned out great every time.  I ran out of the sugar/cinnamon coating with only 75% of the cookies rolled, so I would increase this by 1.5 next time (3tbsp sugar and 3tspn cinnamon).  I learned from my mother that any dough that's over-mixed after adding the flour will be tough.  I mix everything in my Kitchenaid, but use the lowest setting, and turn it off while measuring out the flour, only mixing while actually adding the flour to the mixing bowl for short periods of time.  I am having issues with my oven controlling the temperature, so this last batch baked for 10-12 minutes at approximately 375°F, and I removed them immediately from the parchment paper to cooling racks... perfect!  Thank you for this favorite!

These came out dangerously good, quickly becoming an addiction. I must have made them bigger than I was supposed to based on the amount it says you get but they were puffy, soft, & cinnamony! The house smelled amazing too! I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because oddly enough I think I prefer flatter chewier cookies - which most people complained about in the reviews. I guess mine came out they way they want them but I'd prefer what they consider their "failed" attempts! Go figure!

These are awesome! But the trick is to let them bake to perfection and then immediately remove from the oven and pan to cool. I used parchment paper to cook them on so I could easily lift them all from the pan to the cooling rack.

I love snickerdoodles! I run a small bakery and i'd promised snickerdoodles to customers. This was my first time making them and they came out great! I did flatten my cookies a bit with my fingers before baking for 10 minutes so they'd spread just a little more. I baked the first two without flattening them at all and they had a nice puff to them but were a bit smaller than I liked.  All in all, these were DELICIOUS! Don't change it at all and you'll be happy you chose this recipe.

The only thing I would have liked is for the cookies to be thicker and more fluffy.  However, that was probably my fault because they looked great at 8 minutes but I left the cookies in the oven for 2 more minutes and they flattened.  If your oven gets really hot I suggest to keep the cookies in there for no more than 8 minutes.  Happy cooking!

The dough was so delicious! My only complaint is they weren't snickerdoodlie enough for me. Mostly just tasted like a sugar cookie. Next time I'm going to try and really pat down and pack on as much of the cinnamon sugar as possible. 

Also, I made sure to cool my cookie dough before baking to get less flat cookies.

Great recipe, easily doubled for my cookie exchange.  When using gas heat, lower the temperature by 25 to 50F and bake for only 6 - 7 minutes.

This was a simple easy recipe that gave FANTASTIC results! The only rule to follow is 8 MINUTES! Don't cook them a second more! I thought my oven may have been a bit different than others, but the cookies really do set on their own! Take them out after 8 minutes even if they look under done. 

Follow the recipe and/or video instructions, and you can't go wrong! :D

Great base recipe-- The final product does have a faint "cream of tartar" ish flavor to it... I made a few adjustments: butter flavored shortening (helps mask the flavor a little), added more vanilla (again, helps hide the CoT flavor), and since I used a convection oven to bake, I decreased the temperature to 390.  Cookies were perfect after 8 minutes, and I used foil baking sheets which I instantly transferred to my granite countertops as soon as the timer went off.  

I also found that I needed to increase the flour by nearly 1/2 a cup-- Cookies were crunchy on outside and chewy/moist in the center... I'll probably try these again with an additional 1/3 or so cup of flour, and cut the cream of tartar by at least half.  I've done this in other cookie recipes, and while it makes the cookie slightly more dense, I find that I enjoy it a lot more than having that slightly metallic flavor lingering in my mouth.  Great simple recipe though-- I consider myself a more advanced baker (and as such, I'm considerably more picky than any of my family/friends)... The cookies are still delicious, and disappeared quite rapidly when I brought them to work with me.  Definitely worth a try for a quick, tasty treat! (...and they're pretty, too!)

This is the first attempt at Snickerdoodles. It was so easy  they turned out so good and buttery and chewy with a little crisp on the edges, so good with homemade hot chocolate. Delicious!! I used the butter flavored shortening instead of just shortening, the flavor was wonderful, creamy on the inside when fresh out of the oven. I also added four teaspoons  lemon juice for the cream of tartar.  I was afraid it would have a lemony flavor but it didn't! I also saw that another review said to not use my electric mixer so I hand creamed the sugar butter mixture. I also took them out at 8 minutes on the dot. I didn't have parchment paper, so I used aluminum foil to line my pans, I hate to clean up. ;.) Turned out great, I will be making these for Christmas! Thank you Becky for the new recipe!!!

I used all butter and pumpkin pie spice. 
If you use all butter your cookie will not hold their shape as well. Fluffy cookes require the butter to whipped really well. What used to take an electric hand mixer 10 minutes takes my kitchen aid [set up with a New Metro Beater Blade] 5 minutes tops. I made a double batch in my 5quart classic mixer and they came out just as I like them. Crunchy shell, cloud like interior that turns chewy as you eat it. Mmm. I love these cookies and they are a holiday staple for me. I hope my couple tips help you out as well.

I've made these cookies a few times over the past few years and now I'm finally getting around to reviewing. The only thing I can say is that I usually have to leave my cookies in the oven for 9 minutes, and I ran out of vanilla extract and used vanilla beans instead and it was DELICIOUS. I used about a 1/2 tsp (roughly) of beans. This is a regular cookie recipe in my home, don't change a thing!

These cookies came out perfect. I used 3 tbsp, tsp for the sugar and cinnamon and had the exact amount  I needed. I used an electric hand mixer to initially blend the ingredents, but swithced to using my hands in order to avoid over mixing the dough. 8 minutes was the right amount of time, even though they do not look done at this point. I used parchment paper and as soon as these babies came out of the oven, I slid the paper and cookies onto wire racks for cooling. So good! Next time I will probably make a double batch.

Chewy, fresh, perfect Snickerdoodles. Normally one of my least favorite types of cookies but Mrs. Sigg's is perfect.

I've made these several times and everyone LOVES them!!!! I get requests for them often! I bake on a light cookie sheet, 375*, and pull out of the oven at 8 minutes. I can let them stay on the tray for a minute and then take off to cool. They turn out perfect every time. I always use fresh ingredients since several reviews said that's how to prevent them from going flat. Has anyone ever froze the dough? Any suggestions on how long to thaw or can you freeze them after the dough has been put into balls and straight to the oven from the freezer?

I loved this recipie! I replaced the sugar with an equal amount of splenda. I also took the shortening and butter out and replaced them with 3/4 cup sunflower oil. I did need a little more sugar and cinnamon for coating the cookies than it said in the recipe.

I adjusted my recipe to all butter flavored shortening.  Real butter does make cookies crispier and flatter.  I also followed the advice to take them out at 8 min, though I would think that everyone's oven is different.  For me, it did seem a touch underbaked, but after setting, it was fine.  The reason for only 4 stars, is that my cookies were more cake-y then chewy.  That could well be something that I did though.  Husband really liked the flavor ,and I'm sure they'll be all gone.

5 stars! Love this recipe. Snickerdoodles are so easy and a great croud pleasure.  I made this recipe exact, the only thing I changed was I refrigerated the dough for an hour before rolling them into a ball. It makes for a thicker cookie and does not spread out as much.

Followed the recipe through, made the cookies too big so I had to bake them a bit longer than ten minutes but they were really scrumptious. Excellent recipe will definitely make more. Highly recommend this. Would give more stars if there were more to give. Yummy yummy yummy

I've made these a lot and they've turned out great every time. Like other reviewers have said, only bake for 8 minutes. I tried to substitute vinegar and baking powder once for cream of tartar when I ran out and the cookies really proofed up. They were hard the next day. 
Another time I accidentally used lemon extract instead of vanilla (grabbed the wrong bottle) so I rolled the cookies in plain sugar and added a lemon glaze once cooled. My family loved my "new"  lemon cookies.  I will be making these for years to come.

I usually don't cook the entire recipe, because we're not a big family, and I keep half the dough in a container in the fridge for a way to make fresh ones everyday for a snack!

These cookies are amazing. Decided to make them pumpkin snickerdoodles by making the following changes; used all butter, increase flour to 3 cups, add 3/4 c pumpkin purée, 1/2 tsp of both cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, and used 3/4 c white sugar and 3/4 c brown sugar. Increase the sugar and cinnamon for rolling to 3 tbsp.

To keep the cookies from coming out flat I chill the cookies in the ball form in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours ...8 would be better. Then add cinnamon and sugar coating and bake. The cookies will thaw and cook at the same time which will stop the flat cookie out come.

Easy and fantastic!  I just used 1 cup of butter instead of a the 1/2  cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening. I didn't have any shortening and I don't think I would go out of my way to buy it just for this recipe the next time I bake these.

I have made these a couple of times now, and they are AWESOME! Mixing by hand yields the best results, and always mix your dry ingredients and wet ingredients separate before mixing together. I also baked these for 8 to 9 minutes and they are perfect every time

I made these cookies because i had bought the commercial dough version of it and I felt in love with them.  I was very excited by choosing this recipe and it was quiet easy to make. The only change I made was using both 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup of shortening. I baked them for 8 minutes at 400 degrees and came out a little uncooked in the middle so I added one minute to the other batches. When I did the 10 minutes on my last batch they came out kind of burnt. So don't  do 10 minutes. Between 8-9 is best at that degree level. The taste is decent but I think is missing something from the commercial counterpart. I checked on the ingredients from the brand I had and I did not have corn starch on this recipe neither "bleached" flour so either they are lying or I am still in love with the commercial brand. Whatever it is I would try baking them again. Maybe I will add more sugar to the mix next time. The flour was not too sweet for me, just average. But hey making mistakes is how we learn, right? It was easy to make, no problem with that.

Phenomenal recipe. I make a range of cookies every year for the holidays, and this has earned itself a permanent spot in my baskets. Family and friends rave about them and ask for more. 

I stick right to the recipe, but I pull them out just a tad early. I also use parchment paper to bake on with all my cookies. Cleanup is a breeze and nothing ever sticks!

These are so simple and delicious. I make them a little larger (about 1/4 cup each) and bake them for about 12 minutes. They are just a little crispy on the edges but still soft and chewy in the center. These freeze well too. I don't roll them in cinnamon & sugar, but do form them into balls, freeze on a baking sheet and transfer to a plastic bag. I bake them nearly frozen, and roll them in cinnamon & sugar just prior to putting them in the oven.

I've always heard of snickerdoodles but never tried it before until now. The recipe produces a very good batch of cookies! It's not too sweet...with just the right ratio of sugar to cinnamon coating. I did not mix too much after adding the flour as others have suggested. I don't have a cookie scooper so I weighed out the dough to 42g each (which got me 23 nice sized cookies)...and baked it for exactly 11 minutes. I let it cool for about 30 minutes before trying. There's a light crunch outside but nice and chewy inside. Very basic but also a little unique due to the tang. Will keep this recipe!

YUMM!! This was a favorite. I only made 24 very good sized cookies and baked each 11 minutes and they were absolute perfection. I liked the ratio of sugar to cinnamon to roll them in, though more sugar would be nice too to give it a little sweeter taste a little more crunch, but really these are awesome as is. I did have to add about 3/4 a cup more flour too, mine were very wet and I knew they were going to spread too much, so I increased flour and refrigerated the dough between batches. Awesome recipe, will definitely use again soon.

I read through the reviews and took the advice of people that have done this before. I made sure my butter shortening and eggs were at room temperature also went out and bought fresh baking soda and cream of tartar.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and cooked for eight minutes. Each pan came out perfect and soft. This is a keeper.

This is the first snickerdoodle cookies I have ever made and I must say that they were a success.  They are extremely easy to make and quick!  I used a small cookie scoop and baked them for exactly 8 minutes.  I rolled the whole entire batch at once in the sugar and cinnamon while the oven preheated.  As soon I took them off the baking sheet, I would put the next batch on.  Very time efficient tip!

I made these just add the recipe calls for except I substituted coconut oil for the shortening for a healthier option.  They were fabulous!  I took them to work and everyone tabbed about them. I plan on making them again for an upcoming bake sale.

Mrs. Sigg...You are brilliant!  Loved this recipe and I have made Snickerdoodles for years.  I have always enjoyed a good Snickerdoodle, but was put off a bit by the bitter aftertaste of the Cream of Tartar.  I only changed that portion of the recipe and followed the advice of others who substituted lemon juice for it.  They turned out magnificently!  Baked them for 7 minutes in my convection oven with perfect results and removed them from parchment paper covered sheets immediately with ease!  Thanks so much for bringing back childhood memories :)

REALLY GOOD!!! these are great. i made then twice and they jut fill the kitchen with this wonderful smell (and fill ur mouth w/ a wonderful taste later on ) 
just please, for your own sake, dont think ur smarter than baking soda. the 2nd time i made it, well lets just say the baking soda wasnt coming out so i tipped it a bit and the spoon kina hit the box and POOF! baking soda delight. i took most of it out, and didnt think much abt it cuz the dough tasted fine (i eat raw dough :P) BUT THEN....lo and behold. it came out of the oven fresh, hot. i pick one up and its sooo good, then suddenly im like YUCK!! the middle/after taste is horrible. they stayed in the cookie jar for months and served as good pranks for ppl. my cousni actually liked them and finished his cookie. but yeah. these are great!

I made them larger but underbaked to 11-13 mins at 375 degrees as suggested and came out perfect!  It really does look undercooked when coming out of the oven but the next day it turned more chewier than the day I made it!

I use peanut butter for 1/2 of the butter since it gives a better flavor and makes for a softer cookie.  Baking powder is made up of baking soda + cream of tartar so you can just sub that and get the same results.

So so good.  I rarely have shortening on hand, so I usually substitute butter and they turn out just as well.  A fun recipe for the kids to help with.

I hosted Christmas dinner this year and I made these for dessert but when I tasted one I packed ALL of the rest of them up and hid them. Then, I went to the market, got a sugar cookie tray and served that instead. I don't know if I ate anything besides these cookie for the next week with a cup of coffee. It was heaven.

I must have different taste buds than everyone else. The cookies were just OK. It tasted too bland, like too much shortening and not enough sugar. Would recommend cutting down on the shortening, adding more sugar and adding a little lemon extract (yeah, i know it sound weird) to lift the flavors.

I just tried these a half hour ago. Not very soft as I expected, but I guess they weren't supposed to be. A little too much cinnamon, but I'm not a big cinnamon fan anyway. Overall, still pretty good cookies.

just made these, fresh & frozen.I freeze them to send to my son away at school, so all he has to do is choose how many he wants and go from freezer to  oven, no fuss.I always do a trial run on the frozen dough so I know what they will come out like for him.they came out perfect both ways.I didn't have shortening so I Used all butter & they came out perfect, texture & flavor & look were all perfect. my dough was a bit sticky but I used a small scooper to dump them in the cinnamon mixture & got through it. this is my new recipe (sorry better homes & garden).

My first time making snickerdoodles and they are perfect!  i was afraid when i took them out that they wouldn't be flat enough but they settled just fine.  Friends and family simply devour these cookies!!  I need to work on rolling them, because i think mine were a tad too cinnamony (but that can't possibly be the fault of the recipe as i didn't use their amounts) but even as they were the taste of the cookie more than covered for it.  I tried to take them out after 8 minutes exactly as some people said but they still seemed way to soft, i even put them in for extra time, but i had added another sheet of cookies in the middle of the cook time, so that must have let a fair amount of heat out.  I can't praise these cookies enough.  So simple to prepare and they can be made so quickly!  If you're behind schedule to a dinner party, bring these!  Easy to make, quickly baked, and utterly delicious.

This is a great recipe! I've read that people aren't happy with the end results of how their cookie looks. What might help is to mix or sift the flour, tartar, soda and salt prior to adding to the mixture. This helps your cookies cook evenly and has the puffiness you might be looking for. For my sugar/cinnamon mixture I personally used 6tbs of sugar and 1tbs of cinnamon, this is just personal preference. Have fun with variations of this recipe, and thanks for sharing!!

Will look no further for a Snickerdoodle cookie recipe after using this one.  Easy and quick to make and absolutely delicious.  They were perfect for my taste (a little on the crispy side) after 9 minutes in my oven.  This is a 5 star recipe exactly as written, however if you want to try something different I would recommend adding cinnamon chips - Delicious addition, it adds extra sweetness and does not give the cookie an overwhelmingly cinnamon flavor (as I wrongly suspected it might before giving it a try).

I love Snickerdoodles and this recipe is great! I followed the recipe exactly. Only baked 8 minutes. I did have to make more cinnamon sugar mixture because I ran out. I ended up with six dozen cookies! Maybe mine were too small, but they are delicious. Will make again.

This is by far the best Snickerdoodle I've ever had/made. I changed the recipe slightly, using two sticks of butter and no shortening. I also upped the salt to 1/2 t. The outside is so crisp and the insides are almost creamy. The kids and I had a blast making them,  thank you Mrs Sigg.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I followed the reviews & the only thing I did differently was use more cinnamon in the sugar cinnamon mixture.  I am most certainly a novice baker, so if you follow the recipe your cookies should turn out amazing, no excuses!

These are so delicious!  Mine came out flat, but so what? It's a cookie!  I also used a 3T/3t sugar-cinnamon ratio, and it was just right. I think they're my new favorite.

These are awesome! I love snickerdoodles, but they *need* to be soft and chewy. This recipe is practically fool proof. The dough is soft and spongy, but the cookies come out perfectly dense. I followed the recipe exactly (doubled) and baked 10 mins. This is my new go-to snickerdoodle! I had some friends over when I was baking and they kept snatching them right off the cooling racks! :)

Made exact. They came out great! So easy and quick! My favorite ones to make ( due to easy factor) and to eat! Dough was easy to work with and they all came out looking perfect! Will be on my "go to" cookie list from now on.

My 17 year old son made these and they came out perfect.  I was afraid they'd be too sweet but they were just right. His made his cookies bigger and ended up with 26 cookies baked at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. This recipe is a keeper!

I'm terrible at baking, but I was able to make these successfully! I made only 6 at first (in case they bombed; then I wouldn't have to throw out so much). In cases like these, I'm glad for ground flax seeds, because how else would I get the equivalent of 1/4 egg?? (I just followed the proportion on the box of flax seeds for egg replacer in baking: in this case, 1/4 tsp ground flax seeds, and 3/4 tsp water).

I used light brown sugar instead of white, since I didn't have white. I baked them at 200C (392F), the highest that my convection/microwave oven will go. The cookies were too soft to be handled at 10 minutes, so I put them back in for 5 more minutes, and they came out crispy. I'll try a little less time next time and see if they'll come out chewy.

Best snickerdoodle recipe ever. I use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup margarine and I substitute lime or lemon oil and add grated lime zest to the recipe.  Roll the cookie dough in a lemon sugar instead of cinnamon sugar.

I really liked this recipe, I didn't love it. I think the cookies needed more cinnamon but other than that were great. I didn't have cream of tartar, so used vinegar instead. I will try this recipe again when I have some cream of tartar to see if it makes a difference. As an American living in the UK, these cookies are a nice reminder for me of home. Thanks for the recipe.

Because the dough was sticky, I added a skosh more flour...less than 1/4 cup. Other than that, followed exactly. Baked 8 minutes precisely. They're insanely good!

Very good and easy recipe. I too didn't add the cream of tartar and used a teaspoon of baking powder and a splash of lemon juice.(maybe a teaspoon) The were on the flat side, but, that isn't a huge deal for me. I used all butter as well. (Instead of the shortening) and got them out of the oven and off of the cookie sheet after 8 minutes in the oven.

Dear. Mrs Sigg, You are my family's hero.  These are, hands down, the BEST snickerdoodle we have had the honor to feast on.  I'd give you 10 stars if I could.   P.S.   I used 1 cup butter and no shortening because we needed our snickerdoodle fix immediately and the cupboard was bare.  The buttery flavor was perfection.  THANK YOU!!!

These are pretty good. I did not use shortening, I just doubled the butter and they turned out okay. They did flatten out, but I don't mind that. They are not too sweet, which makes them a nice change from all the overly sweet cookies/candies. I'm taking them to a church party tonight and we'll see how they go over. As for a funny aftertaste, I haven't noticed one at all. It is important to bake them for ONLY 8 or 9 minutes tops. Then let them cool for a couple minutes on the sheet before removing them to cool. Store quickly so they don't get hard.

I have been using this recipe for several years.  People rave over them, I have been told many times that this is "the best snickerdoodle I have ever eaten!"  The recipe is great as is I don't make any changes but I use real butter and butter flavored shortening.  I usually have to make a quadruple batch during the holidays because they go so fast.

I made this recipe exactly as written (except I used 3T sugar and 3t cinnamon as suggested) and they turned out perfect.  These cookies were so delicious!  Nice and puffy and light! I made these for a Christmas cookie exchange and everyone is going to love them.  Thank goodness I threw the rest in the freezer or we would have ate them all.

This is the best snickerdoodle cookie recipe EVER!! Although I did roll the cookie dough into the cinnamon and sugar mixture, I sprinkled the rest on the cookies after it was finished baking in the oven. I'm so glad that I have this recipe saved in the recipe box. :-)

I used this recipe for my first attempt at snickerdoodles and they turned out great. The only problem I had was the dough sticking to my hands when I tried to roll them. Someone mentioned wetting your hands which would have been less messy!! I put some flour on my hands and it worked out fine. Thanks for sharing.

These were a BIG hit with my family. The only change I would make (and it is because of my own personal preference) is to cut the cinnamon down to 1-1.5 teaspoons. I like my cookies a little less on the cinnamon side, if that makes sense. Definitely will make again and again and.....

I just pulled these out the oven and with held breath, waited for everyone to taste and viola! They loved them. I didn't have cream of tartar but I followed the recipe to a tee. My 5 year old loves to bake and these were super easy and fun for both of us! Thanks!

Amazing and perfect as written - Anyone who gave these a bad review made them wrong or have an odd set of taste buds.

I usually am a big fan of all the high rated cookie recipies on this site, but this one was a big disappointment. The bottoms burned too fast (if you divide up the dough into 48 parts, only cook for 5-6 minutes) and my husband thought they lacked flavor. I will keep looking for a snickerdoodle recipe that taste more like the cookies from Noodles and Company.

These were good, but not my favorite.  Although my husband and mother in law loved them.  I used my mixer for it and perhaps that is why they were a little fluffier/flakier than I like.  I prefer a soft and chewy cookie and I'm wondering if I mixed everything by hand if that would have made the difference.  I might have to try this recipe one more time, without the aid of a mixer, and see if my opinion changes.

I substituted lime juice for cream of tartar because I didn't have any but otherwise followed the recipe. The cookies were awesome. I was a little worried because other reviewers had issues with flat cookies but I used older baking soda and they were still super fluffy, moist and chewy on the inside with a nice crisp on the outside. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

AMAZING!! I've never written a review before, but this cookie definitely warranted it! I was out of vanilla extract so I used almond, I cooked them at 375 for 8 min, took them off the sheet right out of the oven, Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T, came out perfect! Just as good or better than the gourmet store bought!

These cookies are AMAZING!  I saved this recipe a couple of years ago and decided to make these for the first time on Mother's Day this year.  I have since made about 10 batches for different events (potlucks, birthdays, Tuesdays, etc.), and everyone absolutely LOVES them.  The only thing I change is add extra sugar to the cinnamon/sugar mixture at the end.  No biggie, personal taste is all.  Make sure your baking soda and butter are both fresh, and pour off a little egg white to make them extra puffy (old school trick).  Thank you so much!!

Soooooooooo good!  Addictive!   For me, they were the PERFECT consistency, exactly as described--crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I added a bag of cinnamon chips to the recipe and should have compensated for the extra sugar by cutting back on the amount I put in.  Next time I will use 1/2 cup less.  Also, I added some fresh grated nutmeg.  Next time I will do that as well.  One last thought:  Next time I will add the cinnamon to the dough and use different colored sugars only to roll them in before baking to give them a more festive look!  I can color code them green and gold for our favorite team!  GREAT RECIPE!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Wow! Wow! Wow!  You must make these cookies. I didn't change a thing and followed the directions exactly.  I did take the cookies out after 8 minutes of baking. I think any longer than that would make them less YUMMY!!!

I made the 24 servings recipe and my cookies turned out flat. I used fresh baking soda and followed all of the instructions. I actually refrigerated my dough. The taste is good but I got flat cookies and I have no idea why :(

These cookies turned out awesome! Thank you for the review that suggested cooking exactly 8 minutes. I probably would have cooked them longer. Also I bought fresh ingredients- specifically for the baking soda. Does anyone know why there isn't any cinnamon inside the actual cookie?

We decided to make these cookies to have something fun to do with the family. Our older cream of tartar and baking soda didn't seem to be too much of a problem and didn't have too bad of an aftertaste. Washed down with milk, these crispy on the outside, soft on the inside cookies were a pretty big hit with everyone.

Absolutely, without a doubt, the BEST snickerdoodle recipe! I followed the recipe to a T and the cookies came out delicious. I think I may need to hide them or I'll be eating them all! lol

Oh my, these were extraordinarily good!  I didn't have trouble with flattening & I simply mixed the wet ingredients first (partially melted butter in microwave) then added the salt, soda & cream of tartar, then mixed thoroughly.  Added flour last, mixing until no dry flour could be seen.  Formed balls, then rolled in sugar / cinnamon mix & baked for 8 minutes.  Adorable to look at, crisp on the outside, moist & chewy on the outside...very easy and enjoyable cookie...two thumbs up!!!

Wow, these cookies were amazing. I made this recipe exactly according to directions except for doubling the butter and omitting the shortening. They are nothing short of perfection!! The only difficulty I had was cooking them for just the right amount of time...so keep a close on on them while baking. I read the most positive and least positive reviews before making this recipe, and the consistent "bitter, cream of tartar" as well as the "too sticky dough" reviews made me nervous. Fortunately, I did not have either of those problems WHATSOEVER...not even close. Thank you for an amazing recipe. I think my husband might love me a little more when he has these after work today :)

Too flat and crispy for me.  Next time will use less butter/shortening and turn oven down a little.

Made large cookies about 30. Used 3 cups of flour, 1 tbsp of vanilla, a little extra baking soda, took off the baking pan immediately. Used parchment paper. Used 3T sugar and 3tsp cinnamon and baked 10 min.

Not the recipe for us.  It's not really the fault of the recipe; we're chocolate chip fans more than anything.  Thought it would be nice to try something new, but it tasted kind of flat. Won't make again.

Love these cookies.  The only thing I had to change was using Baking Powder instead of cream of tartar and baking soda since I didn't have cream of tartar.  My husband devours these and I brought them to a party once and everyone loved them.  Like one other review said I only cooked mine for 8 minutes and they came out perfect.

This is the perfect cookie for three reasons:
1.  Almost always, the ingredients are on hand
2.  Kids love to make these!  Littlest ones love to roll in cinnamon.
3.  They taste great!  
Thanks, Mrs. Siggs

Had fresh baking soda and cream of tartar and they were amazing. The cracking on top was perfect. I formed them into balls and coated them with the cinnamon sugar mixture by shaking them in a plastic bag. Gotta make sure no to leave them in for too long or they won't hold well the next day.

Tasty!  I normally like my cookies soft, but I actually unintentionally underbaked them (how's that for alliteration!) which made them too soft.  I should have put them in the oven a bit longer, especially since I made them large.  Despite this blunder, they were still worth it!  Very good.

I absolutely LOVE Snickerdoodles!! I followed the directions to the "T" My dough was very sticky, so I added 2 Tbsp. flour and baked as directed. They came out perfect, puffy, crisp and chewy in the center. And the flavor is just heavenly. Thank you Mrs. Sigg

I think there is no need for that much cinnamon! It is more like two tablespoons of sugar to 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon mixed together to make a balanced topping. Otherwise, the cinnamon overpowers the whole cookie. I find them best undercooked by at least a minute (so 7 minutes) because they will still bake a little on the pan and come out more chewy that way.

I love these snickerdoodles. I had to use a little more cinnamon and sugar for my rolling mixture. I also used butter instead of shortening and it worked out well. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Try these cookies!  I've never left a review on this site, but I logged in just to give this 5 stars.  These are the best snickerdoodles I've ever tasted!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly.  They went so fast I'm making a new batch tomorrow so that I can have more than one!!

Just made these for Christmas and they were a hit.  I have been using the same recipe for years and decided to give these a try and they have now replaced my old recipe.

Other then the vanilla it's the same recipe I have used for over 40 years. I'm going to have to try it with vanilla. I had to rate it 5 since I love my recipe and the vanilla has to add some good extra flavor.

This recipe is the reason I am known as the Snickerdoodle queen.  These are my favorite cookie.  Take them out of the oven at eight/nine minutes, even if they do not look done to have a soft perfect cookie. I have used this recipe for many years now, I never have changed a thing.

Best snickerdoodle recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a dash of cinnamon to the dough. First I mixed the butter, shortening, eggs, and vanilla. In anothet bowl I mixed all the dry ingridients, after that I mixed both. The dough was not sticky at all as other reviews, it came out perfectly. And I also chilled it for about 15 minutes. For the extra sugar and cinnamon I used about 4 teaspoons for each. I used a tiny bowl instead of the ziplock others were recommending. I also let them in the oven for exactly 10 minutes and the came out perfectly. They were chewy, bronzed, and not flat. If you have problems with this you should check the expiration date of the backing soda and that the creme of tartar is fresh. I recommend this recipe to everyone!

My mouth was not ready for this yummy cookie!  I absolutely loved this recipe!  Men and women both enjoyed the cookie and complimented me on how soft and chewy they were.  Everything was perfect about this cookie, I would not change a thing!  They were ready in a snap and very easy to make.  Thanks for sharing!

This is the best snickerdoodle recipe I have tried. The helpful hint from other reviewers of baking for exactly 8 minutes was spot on.  The cookies came out perfectly chewie and fluffy.  It was a Christmas hit with my family.  Definitely part of our Christmas cookie tray.

Didn't 't change a thing, and these are excellent. Used Saigon cinnamon and used a small cookie scoop (like an ice cream scoop but smaller) to keep the cookies even in size. Scooped out chilled dough. Keep the dough cool so the puff. Delicious.

Really good, however they did get a little too dry.  I ended up putting mine in a ziploc with a slice of bread to soften up.  Very good flavor.

This is the first time I made snickerdoodles.  My baking soda is a few months old as was the cream of tartar so I used 2 teaspoons of baking powder instead.  These cookies turned out perfect! I lowered the temperature to 375F because I used dark baking pans, but still used parchment paper too.

Totally awesome cookie.  This recipe has replaced my old Snickerdoodle recipe.  They make a wonderful Christmas as well as an everyday cookie.  I cannot keep my family away from them and everyone at work always asks for them.

Recipe turned out pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly and my family seemed to like them. They were nice and soft in the middle and had a nice cinnamon and sugar coat. Only reason I'm not giving five stars is because I thought they were good but nothing special

I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly! I live in an area of Dallas with a famous "chippery" that makes hands down the best cookies I've ever tasted, and someone asked me if I really made these or if I brought them in from J.D.'s!!! (It was a great compliment, believe me). Anyway, I would say that I didn't pull mine out right at 8 minutes because they weren't quite done, but by 10 they were perfect. It might be just my oven though.

A waste of 1/2 lb. butter. Rushing to make Christmas cookies, I couldn't find my old Snickerdoodle recipe so used this one, and my entire two trays of cookies came out as two giant, flat cookies.
This recipe fails to remind the baker to CHILL THE DOUGH before baking. I should've known better, but just followed the directions and wasted an hour of my life and all the ingredients. 
I've checked other recipes on the 'net, and so far, they tell the user to CHILL the dough first. Careless directions, but I'll give myself a smack on the forehead too, for not noticing the missing instruction.
Of course, this didn't stop my husband an me from eating the giant cookies over the next couple of days, just tearing off strips of cookie, so it's not a 100% failure. Just nothing I can include in gift boxes for Christmas.

I baked these cookies the other night and wrapped them up in a cute presentation and gave them to my co-workers as a mini-Christmas gift with a card. It was a huge hit and I am getting asked to share this recipe now. The texture, flavor and simplicity are all 5 stars!

Amazing! Yummy. Yummy. Yummy. Light and fluffy. Wife said they were the best ones ever. We ate a whole dozen ourselves within an hour!  Maybe it was a half our. We were channeling Cookie Monster. 
     Chewy inside, crisp edges. I cooked them for 10 minutes, 1 tray at a time in the oven, the cookies on a tray lined with a Silpat.  Now I'm going to have some more.

You said that you use only butter, do you mean you don't use shortening for this recipe?

These turned out good, but they tasted like they were missing something. I think it may have been the shortening. Next time I will use butter for the shortening, and maybe they will taste better.

I have no idea why everyone is raving about these. Flavor is right.  I measured everything accurately, yes I sifted the flour, yes I leveled off the dry ingredients, yes I used new baking soda and cream of tartar but they still came out flat and anything but chewy. sorry.

I made these.... The seem too thick... I tried cooking them a little longer that made them too crispy... i like them chewy in the center but no matter what time i put them in they were either dough or hard... and ireally was just the wrong texture for a snickerdoodle.

These are the best I've ever had.

I use a #30 disher for portioning all my cookies so I ended up with 30 or so cookies. That, plus the fact my oven always seems to cook slow made for a 12 minute bake.

My daughter and I made these tonight ... we experimented and tried the conventional oven and regular.   If you like more dark somewhat burnt cookies, then go the conventional route.   If you enjoy cookies that taste moist and soft, Do Not use the conventional oven, go the reg oven route.  Same time, same size for both and much different cookies, not that there is anything wrong with that.  

I do recommend chilling the cookie dough before you roll them into balls to bake.

The more cinnamon you add the darker they are, which can make them look burnt ... I added a little more sugar, not that there is anything wrong with that.

Wow what an amazing cookie!!  Mine turned out beautiful, puffy, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I left them in the oven exactly 8 minutes and transferred them right away to a cooling rack.  I did up the coating to 3tbsp sugar and 3tsp cinnamon. Only change I made.  Sooooo good!!!

These were delicious, although next time I would put a litttle bit less than 2 tbsp of cream of tartar, there was a slight bitterness left with the aftertaste.

These came together so easily! Will definitely make these again. All its missing is a nice bowl of vanilla pudding for dipping! Thank you for a great recipe!
Update*** I have made these many times over the years. It is better every time I make it. My kiddos went nuts for them today.

This is the exact same recipe as Betty Crocker's. I've been making it for YEARS. The only thing I do differently is add a cup of Hershey's cinnamon chips to the mix. It adds that special little "yum" that I love so much. 

I also toss extra cinnamon and a teaspoon of ground white pepper in with the cookie dough if I'm feeling extra spicy :)

I whipped up a half-batch of these for my FMIL, but I never give baked goods without taste-testing first. I immediately went ahead and made another, full batch -- they're that good! This recipe will definitely be enjoyed in our home often. :)

These are amazingly delicious! I followed the recipe as is. The cookies came out dome-shaped, and did not flatten out. When you eat it fresh out of the oven, the insides are soft. As it cools, the insides become more chewy and outside is crunchy. I love them both! Will be making it again and again...

I'm not a snickerdoodle fan, but I had some candied ginger left over that I chopped up and put in the dough as well and it seemed to be a winning combination. I added about a 1/2 cup of the chopped candied ginger but followed everything else exact.  Good cookie!

I substituted the shortening with softened butter like other reviewers and also doubled the cinnamon/sugar coating. I put the coating in a plastic baggie and just dropped in each ball of dough and shook it around (like making pork chops). They came out a lot darker than the picture but not too cinnamony. A little buttery for my taste but still delicious.

YUMMY!  I read all the reviews and was so excited to make these.  I made the cookies exactly as the recipe says, except I cooked them ata 375 degress instead of 400.  I will be making these again.  They are soft on the inside and just right on the outside.

WOW!  these were fantastic! Disappeared like no one's business!  Per another reviewer I used white vinegar instead of cream of tartar cuz mine was over a year old and i don't really like the taste of it either and the cookies puffed up perfect!  I used all WW flour and did a half recipe with all butter.  YUM!  Will def make again.

I love this recipe. When you cook it just as directed you get cookies that are crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. Cook it a little longer and you get crunchier cookies that are great with coffee or tea. Most importantly: they are delicious either way!

Excellent. Baked 8 minutes and they look raw but do not over bake or they are hard. Really chewy the next day too. Yummy.

Followed the recipe but substituted more butter for the shortening and vinegar for the cream of tarter and added a little vanilla. These came out beautiful and delicious. I baked for 8 minutes on convection and that was just right.

These were absolutely wonderful! I didn't have cream of tartar so I substituted an equal amount of baking powder. I also made just a little bit more cinnamon and sugar and put a little extra on the tops of the cookies. Delicious!

I do a little baking for a local deli. When they requested 100 Snickerdoodles I tried out a bunch of recipes, wanting to find the best. This is it!!! Even people who aren't big fans of Snickerdoodles love these! You won't be disappointed.

Didn't work for me.  These were sooooo not what I was seeking.  I wanted the snickerdoodles you get from the mall...the ones that are flat, buttery and chewy in the middle.  These are thick and cake-like.   Will not waste money on anymore snickerdoodle recipes...will just make a trip to the mall and buy the cookies I like so much.  I must say that cookie company definitely seems to have kept the recipe under wraps well!!

Fabulous! They taste very similar to my grandmothers old recipe. Only change I made was that I flattened the balls out a bit before rolling the in the sugar mixture, but besides that, they were wonderful. Will definitely make again!

These were fantastic. My entire family loved them, and has asked for me to please make more. I love this recipe because the ingredients are items I almost always have on hand. They are also very durable. They come off the pan nicely, and pack up great in lunches. I will make them for gifts. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made these for a pot-luck and they were gone within minutes. Make sure you do not overcook them, take them out when they are still a bit mushy or they will be overcooked and hard when they cool.

These cookies were a HUGE success in my Family's house- Super Delish! The only problem was that I didn't have eggs, or white flour. I was heartbroken that I couldn't try this obviously fantastic recipe... When I decided to look up egg substitutes. I found that powdered creamer will substitute for the egg's additive "hold together" and " fluffy" ness. I found some whole wheat flour in the pantry. =) I would've given these five stars, but under the circumstances, I haven't quite given these a fair trial. You can bet I'll try them again soon, with the proper ingredients. =) I also found that a decrease in temp helps with the after-texture of the cookies. Thanks for this awesome creation!

These were very good. I used a hand mixer and my cookies looked fine, not flat. I did have to make more cinn/sug mixture though. Mine were done in 7 min.

These cookies are absolutely fabulous. I've made them four times now and, each time, they've disappeared in record time.  This is *THE* Snickerdoodle recipe, hands down.  One thing I tried after the second time I baked these was to use a scoop to get consistent size (and consistent size = more delicious cookies to share). This recipe is perfect as is!

Yum! I decided I wanted to make cookies at 2am while home from college, and this was the recipe I decided on, because we had no chocolate chips, and my school's snickerdoodles are gross =P Well anyways, I should have halved this recipe, because it makes a ton! I made 2 dozen of the cookies (one 12-sheet at a time) and decided to ball, dip, and freeze the rest because there was only 2 other people awake at the time! But these are really good, we keep cream of tartar on hand just to make snickerdoodles. I also needed more of the cinnamon-sugar to dip in. While some reviewers  said bake exactly 8 minutes, that was a little underdone for the second batch, the first batch where I pulled them out when the tops had been cracked for a minute or so was the best, but I forgot to time it.

I substituted butter for the shortening because we didn't have any on hand. It turned out great!

I should have posted this review a long time ago.  These cookies have become a holiday family favorite in our house.  I found this recipe in 2007 and have made it often in the years since.  I didn't change a thing the cookies are absolutely delicious!

Absolutely fabulous! I use to use the recipe on the back of the flour but I added vanilla. Once I found this recipe I was hooked. Creaming them together makes them so much better and the vanilla adds so much more flavor! I even froze a bunch and they were still just as yummy as the day I made them!!

This is a great and easy recipe! I like cookies that are soft and chewy rather than crispy and these are perfect! They bake quick.

This recipe brings me back to 11th grade home economics Food and Nutrition because I haven't made this type of cookie since then.

Wonderful! I agree with a previous reviewer that 8 minutes exactly is perfect. These are tasty without being too sweet, have a nice bite to them from the cinnamon, and pair wonderfully with coffee in the morning.

This was a great recipe! However, the taste of cream of tartar is present enough to notice. I'll cut it down next time and add a bit of baking powder to make up the difference. This didn't last long enough to take to the neighbors so I'll have to whip some up again. Definitely tasty and just melt in your mouth yum!

Just made this - awesome cookies!  It helped to refrigerate the dough while one dozen were cooking.  It helped to form the dough and roll in the sugar/cinnamon.

I really like this recipe......Ive made snicker-doodles before and they were very sticky, so when I was making these I noticed that these were sticky also so i added 1/4 cup more flower and chilled it for about 30 min to 1hr(which helped alot!). Over all really tasty cookie!!!

This is a super fantastic Snickerdoodle Cookie. I only had extra large eggs so I added half of the yolk & all the the egg white of the second egg. I didn't over mix the batter. I used the flour that I had in the freezer.  I did not let it sit out but the cookies turned out great. They were not flat. I think the trick is to make sure you don't flatten them. The ones that were more round stayed fluffier. I used old cream of tarter & baking soda & didn't have a problem. The ones that I made smaller turned out fluffier. I also used my hands to form the balls & I noticed that the sugar & cinnamon would get inside the dough a bit & I think it made it more yummy! So play with them & enjoy, we sure did!

These taste wonderful.  Made the recipe as it as written, and they came out perfect.  I made BIG cookies, about almost golfball size.  They did not flatten out.  I did have to watch the time closely because with the sugar on the bottom, the bottom browns fast and will burn fast.  Great recipe -- thanks Beth for sharing your recipe with us.

These cookies turned out amazing!  The dough made 30 wonderful, moist, picture-perfect cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly and made sure I had fresh cream of tartar and baking soda (suggested by another reviewer).  I'm very excited that I found this recipe and I think I'll end up using with without the topping for a staple sugar cookie recipe.

If you like flatter cookies, this one will probably work for you. I was hoping for some puffier cookies - and used the most fresh ingredients as recommended by someone else. :( Sad. They taste great for being flat though.

I just made this recipe tonight. It is very good. I would suggest cooking on 400 for at least 9 minutes. I  followed some of the reviewers advice to cook only for 8 minutes on 375 and they were not done and fell flat. I cooked the second batch longer at 400 and they are perfect. I guest everything depends on your oven. I have a convection oven so they turned out very even. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

just a helpful hint for those who can't immediately remove the cookies from the sheet- bake on parchment paper, then you can lift the whole thing off of the sheet and let them cool. :) delish!! love cooking for the holidays, and snickerdoodles were probably one of the first recipes that I ever learned to make!!

These are the best snickerdoodles ever! Made them just like it says, took them out of the oven at 8 mins even though they did not look quite done, they were perfect once cooled, the next morning still soft and yummy!

These were a big hit! Perfect softness. I wasn't 100% thrilled with the flavor, but I loved the texture, and everyone else loved the flavors too!

This is a great cookie only reason for 4 stars is because I looked at other reviews and did what they did. The cookies came out perfect, my boyfriend thought i bought them. They were gone as soon as they were coming out of the oven. So fluffy and perfect taste, I'm making them this week to take to a work function we will see what others think.

Fantastic recipe! The only thing that I changed was I used butter flavored shortening because that was all I had, but these cookies are so fluffy & my family loved them. Thank you for sharing.

AmaZing! Made these on a whim, mainly because I had all the ingredients on hand, followed the instructions to the letter -IN THE ALTITUDE and they turned out perfectly. Will be making these again and again. Thanks!

I made these last night and they were AWESOME!!!  The dough turned out perfectly (not sticky at all) and I used a 1TBS measuring scoop to scoop up the dough and keep my cookies uniform.  Using that method, I got 40 gorgeous cookies.  I agree with the other reviewers that baking them for EXACTLY 8 MINUTES and then removing from the oven was best.  My cookies were thick, chewy, and delicious.  I like a lot of cinnamon, so I upped the ratio of cinn to sugar before rolling them. I did use the shake in a ziplock bag trick instead of rolling them by hand. For people who said their dough was too sticky, I suspect the culprit is one of two things:  either your butter was MELTY and not just soft OR your dough got too warm after sitting out.  I recommend putting your dough in the fridge between baking batches to keep it cool.

Oh, Mrs. Sigg...your cookies are amazing!  I had already been a long time fan of your peanut butter cookie recipe and when I needed a snickerdoodle recipe I was very excited to see you shared one here.  I've made it twice and the second time I was out of shortening, so I used an equal amount of unsalted butter.  It was fantastic!  Either way, it is a soft, scrumptious cookie.

These snickerdoodles came out soooo FLUFFY!! They were so delicious. As my sister said, "Better than the store bought kinds!" I took the other peoples advice, and used 3 tbsp of sugar and cinnamon; my verdict is to stick with 2 tbsp of cinnamon and sugar. The bigger the cookies, the less sugar and cinnamon you'll need.

TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!! I am one of those people who are picky about my snicker doodles before this recipe I liked my moms and that was it. These are amazing, a slight crunch on the outside and melt in your mouth center. I didn't put as much cinnamon in mine because I am not a huge fan of cinnamon. Amazing recipe thanks for sharing.

I've made these cookies many, many times over the last few years and they disappear whenever they are put out for friends and co-workers.

Amazing cookies. My mom even told me that they are the best Snickerdoodles she's ever eaten. They bake up perfectly at exactly 8 mins, and are nice and chewy on the inside. I did have to add 50% more sugar/cinnamon mixture though. But overall- a perfect cookie. Thank you for the recipe!

Exceptional! I don't think I've ever had a cookie turn out as well the first time as this one.  I did use margarine in place of butter and refrigerated the dough before rolling into balls.  I also used 3 T sugar and 3 t cinnamon as specified by others.  Overall, an awesome recipe!

Let me just say I have been baking since I was a very small child and I have never even once made snickerdoodles. My mother in law makes them frequently so I decided to try for myself. This recipe far surpasses hers and has become a new family favorite. I made 4 dozen and they were gone by the next day. All four of my kids and their friends love them and have asked me to make more.

Delicious! I read that many people had flat cookies so instead of baking soda and cream of tartar I simply used 3 teaspoons of baking powder then I refrigerated them for 10 minutes before sticking them in the oven. They came out very just right.

Made these awesome cookies for father's day with my daughter. Used all margarine, instead of butter and shortening; mixed by hand; added 1/4c extra flour to make the dough easier to roll into balls; 8 minutes exactly and transferred immediately to cooling sheet; 3 tbsp sugar and 3 tsp cinnamon. They turned out PERFECTLY! And the recipe was super easy! Thanks for the great cookies!

Stunned at how good these were and what a wonderful bonding time it gave me and my 13 year old son, making them together when he was craving cookies. Thanks for a WONDERFUL recipe. It made the house smell good and came out with a cookie that reminded me of my own childhood. Best snickerdoodle I have ever had.

I loved these snickerdoodles! I've never made this type of cookie before but I do love eating them, so I thought I should give it a shot.  These are simple to do and the results are addictive. I didn't have cream of tartar (I never do) so I just used lemon juice (2 tsp. for every 1 tsp of cream of tartar) and that worked very well.  The process of coating the dough in the cinnamon sugar becomes much easier (and less messy) when you just put the mix in a baggie and drop the dough balls in 1 at a time.  Enjoy :)

These cookies were SO good! There is ust something to keep in mind when baking these: DO NOT take them out earlier. They were meant to be baked for a fixed period of time, any time shorter than the recommended time will leave your cookies too soft and possibly undercooked. If you follow the directions as written, your cookies will turn out just fine. They were definitey a crowd pleaser

I used 1 cup white sugar and a half cup brown sugar, and baking powder instead of cream or tartar. Baked for ten minutes and they came out perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. Best tasting snickerdoodle I have ever had!

Very delicious cookies. Mine were crispy around the edges, soft and chewy in the middle. I was in a baking mood, and saved 5 or 6 for our house, and sent the rest to work with my husband to set next to the coffee pot. I was shocked when he returned home with an empty cookie jar that same evening!. Just 4 of his coworkers managed to gobble up the entire thing in one afternoon! I'd say that is a success!

I got rave reviews on this from my church.  I am not a fan of these cookies, but everyone else I have me has asked me to make them again.  I reccomend making sure your oven temp is correct, and taking them out when they are "almost done"

These were a hit with the kids and hubby. The only thing I plan to do different is to use less cinnamon to roll them them. Make them a little more sweeter.

I understand there are many variables in cooking. Maybe I didn't put enough love into it. However, following the directions exactly I ended up with cookies that were so dry I was unable to make my way through one.

I love these cookies! I have found that putting them in the fridge for awhile really helps. After I make the dough I put it in the fridge for an hour or two tightly covered, then I make the balls and roll them in the sugar.

These were amazing!  I followed the directions exactly, and this was such an easy and delicious cookie.  Followed advice and cooked for 8 minutes exactly, and took them right off the pan to cool on a rack.  They were a hit with family and co-workers.  Will definitely make again - thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely fantastic! A little crispy, just chewy enough-perfection. You will have to double up on the cinnamon sugar to roll the cookies in, but other than that, everything's spot on.

This is by far the best snickerdoodle recipe in my massive collection. I generally halve the recipe and use all butter with fantastic results.I have to keep them in a hard to reach place so I don't eat them in one day!

Very good! I agree that 8 minutes is perfect. Also, I preferred mine to flatten out as much as possible because I used them to make sandwich cookies with some leftover frosting. Very yummy!!

From all these reviews, I thought it would be great; however it turned out way too buttery and shortening taste was overpowering. So much that I threw out the entire batch. Usually the reviews on allrecipes are accurate, but this one did not turn out well for me! It could be the shortening I used...it was Crisco brand, and I normally do not use this in my cooking.

I halved the recipe and they still came out PERFECT.  This is the best snickerdoodle recipe I have ever used.  Like others did, I removed my cookies at exactly 8 minutes and had no problem immediately getting them off the sheet.  They were soft and fluffy.  I did add extra sugar and cinnamon for rolling the cookies in.

My family call these the "devil" cookies because they are so good they can't stop eating them. My son's friends offered to pay me to make them some.  I only cook about 9 minutes, better undercooked then overcooked.

First time making these kind of cookies and they turned out perfect! Tip for baking; I separate dough into 4 and flour hands and work each 1/4 into 12-14inch log on mat, then divide into 16 with knife. Much easier than trying to scoop . . . Also decided to roll a few in powdered sugar and they were yummy too!

These cookies tasted great but I had absolutely no problem with them being flat.  I made the balls about 1 1/2 inches and the first pan came out almost an inch thick after cooked so I had to flatten the rest with a cup. We enjoyed these and will make them again.

I love these cookies! My snickerdoodles came out well despite substituting almond extract for vanilla extract since I ran out of the vanilla. My love for cinnamon prompted me to add a little ground cinnamon in the cookie dough itself, but I accidentally added pumpkin spice instead. lol. It tasted great anyway. Thank you for sharing this wonderful keeper, Mrs. Siggs!

I decided to bake cookies this year as part of my holiday gift to friends and coworkers.  I was astounded by all the wonderful reviews and decided 'What's a cookie platter without snickerdoodles!!' and made these last.  I threw on my headphones, turned on the mp3 player, and had a blast dancing and making these.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, but had to use margerine sticks instead of butter, since I ran out, and used vegetable shortening.  My mother smelled them in the oven and knew what they were without even seeing them.  They smelled so delicious!  I immediately tried one out of the oven and they were perfect.  Everyone who had a chance to try one said they were the best they had ever had!!  Thanks Mrs Sigg for these amazingly yummy cookies :D

I made these for Christmas this year, and I kind of wish that I had never found this recipe because they are delicious and I've eaten many of them over the past few days! I've baked quite a few batches, but on my most recent one, I omitted the shortening and used 1 full cup of butter. I also used only about 1.5 tsp of cream of tartar. I think that was my best batch so far. It's hard to stop eating these cookies so please BEWARE when making this recipe...or make sure you have lots of people to share these cookies with so you won't eat them all!

These turned out perfectly!  Just what I remembered Snickerdoodles to taste like.  The texture is amazing.  I did bake for exactly 8 minutes as others have written in their reviews.  I made a double batch and they were a huge hit.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I have never found a snickerdoodle recipe that was remotely good - until now! A very tasty cookie - crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. Like others, my cookies DID flatten - but, I should have checked my baking soda like other suggested. I agree that the cinnamon ratio needs to be higher - I did up mine...I like A LOT of cinnamon.  Also - it took mine 8 minutes exactly...30 seconds later was even too much! However, did not get 48 out of a batch...36.

These are AMAZING!!!!  I used 1 c. of the butter flavored Crisco sticks instead of butter and shortening and they turned out super yummy with lots of butter flavor.

Absolutely perfect no matter how many times I make them. I like to undercook them a tad, usually around 7 minutes. I also like to make them a little larger for bigger bites ;) Overall fantastic recipe though.

Very good recipe.  I did not mind them not flattening all the way.  However, the only thing I would change is that I would underbake the them by about an extra minute.  Recipe calls to bake for 8-10 minutes, I think that 7 or so is perfect so they don't harden too much.  Otherwise, a keeper.

My kids loved them!  The dough did come out very sticky, but I used a small cookie scoop to make the balls and dropped them into the sugar mixture.  Very fast and easy.

These were very good. I made them for a cookie exchange. Made them the night before and they were still nice and soft the next day (and several days later) Fresh baking soda and room temperature eggs were key in finally getting the cookies to rise! This is the first time my snickerdoodles didn't "collapse" on me so thank you for a great recipe and thanks to the reviewers for great advice!

These yummy cookies come out perfect for me everytime, regardless of age of baking soda or cream of tartar.  Just used these two ingredients that were a year old and cookies still came out perfect. I bake at 400 for exactly 8 min take out of oven and whether I remove immediately from cookie sheet or let rest before removing makes no difference.  I use small cookie scoop that makes 1 in balls and makes 45 cookies.  They flatten out some but not too much.  Like I said, perfect everytime!!  Very easy to make. I do increase the sug/cinn mixture to the 3T/3t and that's just enough.

Followed the recipe exactly and these came out perfectly! I'll be holding on to this recipe for sure. Took other reviewers advice and mixed everything by hand rather than using an electric mixer. Delicious!

Delicious ginger cookie.  I replaced the water the orange juice as another reviewer suggested, but I wish I added the zest of the orange, too.  I also agree with another review that you MUST wait before you roll these cookies.  I would call them a 2-day cookie or refrigerator cookies, b/c you really need to let them set up first before you can roll them.  Instead I'm waiting around cooking 24 at a time while I wait to roll the others.  (I doubled the batch!)  Good otherwise!

This is my first year of making cookies from scratch.  The fresh lemon juice instead of cream tartar was a great suggestion.  The cookies turned out perfect and so delicious, crispy outside and chewy inside.  Amazingly yummy.  I brought the cookies to a moving party and it was swiped clean immediately.  Everyone loved it.  I'm more confident now with baking and going to try out other cookies recipes.

Great recipe!  I found baking them at 400 for 8 minutes was ideal and then letting them sit for two minutes before transferring to a cooling rack worked much better for these.  The first batch I made was flat and crunchy, but after adjusting the cooking temp and time I found what worked best  for us!

something went wrong I don't have cream of tartar or baking soda so i replaced it with white vinegar and doubled the baking powder as mentioned in the reviews, but the dough was still too sticky so i  added more flour which made the total flour added near 3 cups or more, it took in the oven from 15 to 20 mins and consequently it lose it' chewy centers   the snickerdoodles tasted okay

WOW! This is THE BEST snickerdoodle recipe, ever! My kids can't stop eating them and they simply are delicious. I did follow the advice of some other reviewers and "creamed" the butter, shortening, sugar, egg, vanilla by hand and not with a mixer. It was worth the extra effort! Thank you for a fabulous recipe~ one that will forever be in my collection.

Mix everything by hand first.. If it appears to dry, you can add one more egg.  I actually used about 1/3 cup of sugar and cinnamon each for the rolling. The more the better, it won't be too sweet.  Made 15 dozen in the past week for work, teachers, kids friends, etc.. Huge hit. They want more!

These tasted like hushpuppies with sugar on them. Don't use this recipe, it doesn't give clear enough directions (especially with the mixing the 2 tablespoons of cinnamon and sugar)

I just made these, and they are AMAZING! Didn't have any cream of tartar so I substituted the baking soda and cream of tartar for 4 teaspoons of baking powder. Worked out just fine.

This is the exact same recipe as in an old Betty Crocker cookbook I've used for years.  These always turn out great. Sometimes I chill the dough before forming into balls "the size of small walnuts" as the cookbook recipe states.  This make the dough easier to handle. Also, I let the baked cookies cool for a minute before removing them from the cookie sheet.

These were delicious. I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the actual cookie dough. Do not bake for over 8 minutes or they will come out very hard and crunchy without the soft center. Next time I think I will add a pinch of nutmeg to the cookie dough also.

This is a delicious recipe! I should have listened to the other reviewers though. I baked the cookies for 8 minutes, but they were still too gooey to remove from the pan, so I put them back in the oven for another minute. Of course, when they cooled they were hard. Next time I'll pull them out of the oven at 8 minutes and let them sit on the pan for a minute or so. Otherwise, they were absolutely delicious! Definitely saving this one to my recipe box!

the actual cookie taste was good but cooking time was way off for me. Maybe its my oven but i had to turn it down to 375 and i only cooked 6 minutes. By the time i got the cooking timing down right i only had 1/2 the amount of cookies :-( i substituted the cream of tarter for lemon juice because i didn't have any but thats the only ingredient i changed. My cookie also came out really flat. But like i said, the taste is good and thats what counts

These are my husband's favorite cookie. I had so many snickerdoodle recipes but this one is our favorite. For now one Im throwing the old recipes out and keeping this one. The only thing i did different was listen to the reviews and added a little more sugar and cinnamon and baked at 7 to 8 minutes...turned out wonderful!

Wonderful. Snickerdoodles are my favorite! This hit the spot. Wonderful crisp outer edge, soft chewy centers. I personally used all butter (1cup), and baked for 8 mins exactly. No other edits to the main recipe its SO GOOD! :D

Excellent.  Crunchy on the edges and chewy in the center just like the description says.  Cooked for 8 to 9 mins.

just remade these today. had to sub the cream of tarter with baking powder, no baking soda, and used coconut oil instead of shortening- did not have any. they came out soft and fluffier than thinner traditional cookies. which I like myself. at 390 and 8 mins they were almost perfect. went up to 400 2nd batch, but since those were smaller cookies, a little too brown I think on bottom. so shoulda left it at 390. bigger cookies needed about 30 seconds longer.(foil cookie sheets fyi) I didnt get that "cracked" top with cinnamon on top look- but i pressed in red and green sugar sprinkles for christmas, tried baggie method for rolling- end up easier to chill dough,make the balls , in large bowl, then sprinkle tops.parchment sheets so easy- slid whole sheet to cool. they dont look quite the same as some others, but they look good to us, nice and soft, crispy edge- tasted Wonderful! might add little more cinnamon to tops next time, but our fav either way- much better than "xmas  cookie cutouts". thanks so much for recipe!

I followed this recipe to the T - with the exception of the sugar/cinnamon coating. I took in one of the reviewer's suggestion to add more of each. They came out perfect. They've become my husband's favorite Snickerdoodles! Edges are crispy while the center remains soft and tender. And so flavorful... Will definitely be making these again!

Mix the dry ingredients seperately. If blend the wet ingredients well before you add the dry ingredients, it makes the dough fluffier and adding about a half (1/2) cup of milk makes them fluffier too. Oh, also spraying the cookie sheets with pam helps them from sticking to the pan and, if you have an electric oven, it also helps them not get as crispy. Oh, and I used 2 Tbls. of sugar to 1 1/2 tsp. of sugar.

This is a great cookie.  I like the addition of vanilla to Betty Crockers' recipe. but I only use 1 teaspoon.  I like Betty Crockers' instructions to "mix" where these instructions say to "cream".  I know it's probably a small thing but creaming is a "method" that can lead someone down a road they really don't want to go down.

These are by far the best cookies EVER made. I print off the recipe every year around fall and loose it every year, so I am thrill that allrecipes has kept it for me for so long. (I have been using this recipe for the last 9 years at least!) They are just amazing. Do it. Make them. Try not to eat them all at once, I dare you!

tastes GREAT! i left them in for 8 minutes exactly, and left the oven open (to allow them to cool in the oven for a few minutes) then took them out  also, the dough is a little thicker than i expected, so after mixing the dry ingredients and wet ingredients separately, i had a bit of a hard time blending the 2 together (i don't have an electric mixer), so i just went at it with my hands. worked out fine

absolutely amazing. i didnt realize the first time it called for shortener and i saw another review saying to replace with butter, so i did that. the only issue is when i tried to roll it i couldnt. they were waaay too sticky. i melted the butter so im not sure if that was the reason or not. i had to use a spoon and just drop the dough into the sugar/ cinnamon mix and just shake it around and plop it onto the cookie sheet. they didnt look to pretty going into the oven so i told my husband we may be eating ugly cookies. haha. when i pulled them out though they were beautifully spread out and puffy. i cooked them for 8 minutes but it wasnt long enough so i cooked for 3 more minutes and let them sit. delicious! crispy and soft and chewy. my husband was even surprised at how soft they were. i cant get over how amazing they are :) thank you for this recipe and next time i will def try to jsut soften the butter and not melt it hopefully that helps. i added extra flour, not sure how much but like 2 or 3 tablesppons. and i also did wet my hands and even added flour on my hands but still the dough was too sticky. oh well they tasted and looked delicious!

This is a wonderful cookie.  I used a soft yogurt margarine in addition to the shortening plus 3 extra heaping Tbsp of flour for a half batch (the dough was soft but I was in need of  a soft cookie- just had surgery).  I took a short cut and just sprinkled a layer of white sugar with a dash of cinnamon on top.  Puffed up perfectly.  Delicious!

I had these cookies at a soccer game and just had to get the recipe. When my friend sent it to me I knew I had to make them right away! I read a lot of reviews before making them. I didn't have enough cream of tatar so I used what I had (a little less than 1tsp) and then 1tsp of vinegar. I made them a little small. I prefer smaller cookies! I baked them for 8 min. and they came out perfectly! They stayed "puffy" and taste awesome. It made 75 cookies. I measured them and they are 2". I use my "stone" to bake them and they really cook well on it. I did cook one stone for about 10 min. because I really like crispy cookies and omg they came out delicious. It just depends on your personal taste preference. ENJOY!

Many thanks for all the input on creating the perfect snickerdoodles.  I took all comments into account and made my changes as such... I added 1 teas of cinnamon (Siagon, which in my opinion is excellent), to the dry mixture, 2 teas baking soda and 1 teas cream of tarter.  I baked my first batch for 8 mins, then the second batch for 9 mins.  I preferred my cookies at the 9 mins of baking time.  I baked the cookies on a "rim-less" cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, and successfully slid the parchment, with warm cookies still on, onto my stone counter top.  Perfect, every time.  Oh, I also made extra sugar topping and was really generous with that part.  Enjoy!!!

These cookies were very tasty, but every time I made them they fell flat.  I like soft puffy cookies so I altered this recipe to use baking powder instead of baking soda.  They came out perfectly!

I didn't have cream of tartar so I used 3 teaspoons of baking powder in lieu of the soda and tartar.  I also added heath chips to the recipe.  YUMMY!  :)

There's a reason why this recipe has so much positive feedback!  These are wonderful.  I did end up using a little more cinnamon and sugar to roll the cookies in but that is all I changed.  I will be adding these to my "must haves".

WOW! I made these cookies today and they are incredible! They really turned out perfect. I only baked mine for 8 minutes and had to use one stick of salted and one stick of unsalted butter. The only thing I will say is that it tasted like they could have used just a tad less cr. of tartar. But overall they were great!!

These are delicious cookies.  I took them out of the oven before they looked done as others suggested.  They are perfect, even the next day.  I will be putting this recipe in my permanent recipe box!

This recipe is delicious!  I used less cream of tartar... about 1.5 tsp (because that's all I had) and it turned out delicious!  I also used all butter because shortening grosses me out and it was great!

I halved this recipe. I used all margarine in place of butter and shortening. I softened the butter a bit before creaming with sugar, eggs, and vanilla. I then put flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt in the same bowl. It was very convenient. I then refrigerated the batter while I mixed the cinnamon and sugar in a ziploc bag. It took quite awhile to get the right mixture because I didn't measure. After refrigerating the batter for about 10 minutes, I took it out. I rolled them into balls and put them in the ziploc and rolled it. I heated the oven to 375 degrees and baked the cookies for 9 minutes. In the end, I got 12 good sized cookies. They came right off my ungreased pan. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Not too sweet either. Love them!

Delicious!!! I use to make snickerdoodles with my dad all the time when I was younger & I can't find my recipe anywhere. This was such a great recipe! I didn't have any cream of tarter so I took someones advice on using lemon juice instead & it turned out great! Also as other reviewers mentioned they only need to be cooked for 8 min. only & taken out immediately even if they seem raw.....that keeps them soft & gooey in the middle just the way I like them!! My only minor problem was that when I opened my oven it was very smokey & set off the fire alarms......maybe the sugar/cinnamon mixture burning a bit on the bottom of the cookies?? Other than that little problem they tasted great!!!! I can't wait to make these fun cookies with my son when he gets a little older!!!

I had never eaten a Snickerdoodle before this recipe.  My boyfriend begged me for them so I decided on this recipe.  After trying this cookie, I was sad that I had missed out on this for the first 27 years of my life.  These cookies are divine!  They're probably the best cookies fresh out of the oven I've ever had.  They make the house smell fantastic when they're cooking and they are so pretty and delicious.  If debating, make this recipe.

I've never had homemade snickerdoodles before and this was such an easy recipe! They turned out great! I didn't have any shortening and didn't feel like running out to the store, so I used lard instead. I used just a little less than the 1/2 cup called for because lard has a stronger flavor, you can't taste the lard at all. I will definitely be making these cookies over and over.

A very chewy perfectly easy to make cookie. The batter is very light which makes for a nice chewy soft center. Boyfriend said I should make sure to keep this one. Highly recommended, thank you!

Ended up cutting the cream of tartar to 3/4 teaspoon. Wasn't a fan of the acidic taste. But still came out really good.

Made these as-is except I added 3/4 c. of cinnamon chips before baking.  This creates a very strong cinnamon taste (which I love) making this a great fall/winter recipe.

excellent cookies!! As a low-fat option I added a package of fat free cream cheese instead of the shortening.  It made these cookies fluffy and tasty!

Excellent!!  I followed it exactly.  Used real butter not margarine.  Baked 7 1/2 minutes so they would be nice and chewy in the middle.

Finally a recipe that produces a moist puffy Snickerdoodle cookie! I followed the recipe except I added a bit more flour about a fourth cup more to stiffen. I also cooked on parchment paper. Yummy cinnamon- buttery goodness!

I made these last night and they were okay. They looked really good coming out of the oven, but I wasn't too impressed with the taste. I've had better snickerdoodles before. I guess I will have to keep looking for a snickerdoodle recipe I like.

The best snickerdoodles I ever had. They were crisp on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside. Eight mintes cooked the perfectlly. The only thing I changed was using all butter instead of half shortening, and adding a teaspoon more cinnamon in the cookies.

4 stars. The cinnamon and sugar to roll the cookie balls in needs to be tripled in order to have enough to do the entire batch. I thought they were tasty but I'll probably add an extra pinch of cream of tartar next time for more the a signature snickerdoodle flavor.

They puff up beautifully and look perfect until about 6 minutes into the baking time and then they fall. They still taste good they just don't look very pretty.

These cookies were pretty good but I probably won't make them again. They were best straight out of the oven but once they cooled they weren't as impressive.

Love these!  The only alteration that I made was rolling some in colored sugar to make sugar cookies.  Easy, easy!  Great taste and they were chewy in the middle and crisp on the outside.

So easy my husband made them...with directions from me, lol. But he did make them and they were perfect snickerdoodles. I did tell him to reduce the cream of tarter by 1 tsp as 2 seemed a bit much. The cookies were fantastic. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I'm in Texas and today its been hot in the house so in between batches I put the dough in the refrigerator or it would have been very sticky. The cookies came out beautiful, crispy on the sides and chewy and moist in the middle. The only change i made was i added more sugar to the cinnamon mixture, it seemed darker than I remember my mom making so i added about 1/3 a cup more of sugar and baked them for 8 minutes. Thank you for posting this great recipe

omg, these are evil.  i made them with the intention of giving them to a friend for letting us borrow his car.  i had one and now i dont want to give them up any more.  would be perfect with some milk or better yet a scope of vanilla ice cream. i didnt chance a thing with this recipe, i just added a Tbs sugar more for the cinnamon sugar.

I loved this! They came out exactly as I expected. And I'm glad they look super appetizing!  If you use a normal size egg, I'd still recommend you to pour out a really small amount of egg white, to avoid it spreading out.   Also, when rolling the dough, dont overdo it! The dough is sensitive, and you want to keep it soft. So be careful and gentle. It's fun!  When baking them, put them on 375 degrees and for 9 minutes exactly. When out, pull them off the sheet by dragging the parchment paper onto a wirerack and wait for them to cool off! PERFECTiON!

I decided to try this recipe because of its high rating/lots of people saved recipe. I thought I would have the best snickerdoodles in the world, but I was quite disappointed because they were good, but did not meet my expectations. Maybe it's just me??? But I had tried the Snickerdoodles I recipe before this one and I actually liked that one more.

Followed this recipe as written.  I did made the dough ahead of time and wrapped tightly in flastic wrap & put in frezer overnight.  This made the dough easier to work with.  Cookies came out soft & chewy and melt in your mouth yummieness.  Just the way Snickerdoodles should be.  Excellent recipe!

These were really good! I made them for my advisor's birthday and some other people and they all loved them. My friend who never eat sweets tookk like 6! unfortunately I had to throw out the first 8 or so because after 8 minutes the bottoms were pretty burned and I was heating them at around 375F. Also I used just a bit more flour like a dash. But overall I'm using this recipe from now on.

This is my son's favorite cookie, and my first attempt to make a snickerdoodle.  My cookies spread very little, so next time I will flatten them a little and make them bigger.  Thanks for a great recipe!

this is by far the best recipe i have ever found for snickerdoodles. instead of 1 1/2 c sugar i used just 1 c seeing as my mom always thinks things are too sweet, she thought they were PERFECT with the 1 c and so did everyone else. i will definitely be making these again since everyone gobbled them up within minutes it seems.

THANK YOU for sharing, Mrs. Sigg!    Made these cookies for the first time today and they came out PERFECT!  Was so impressed with the recipe and also proud of myself for not messing up!  I LOVE how the cookies have that slight crackle effect!  Just like the description says...crispy edges and chewy centers!  I baked them using wax paper lined over baking sheets.  Once the cookies cooled, I simply pulled the wax paper off very gently.

These turned out great!  First time I have made snickerdoodles.    I did 3T of sugar and 3 tsp of cinnamon for the coating.  It worked very well to roll the cookies in a baggie as to not be too messy.  I am guessing they will be gone in the next day or so (if thy last that long).

I loved how these cookies were turning out at first...the batter smelled delicious and vanilla-y, and the texture looked right. Once I combined the wet and dry, however, something went wrong! I put the dough in the fridge for about a half hour before rolling and baking, and they taste great, but the texture is a little too soft and light for my taste...also, taste a little dry. What did I do wrong? Great cookies, though! I'll definitely try again...

I have made these several times now and brought them to numerous gatherings and every time they were the first dessert gone with many asking for the recipe. They are so simple and inexpensive to make you can't go wrong. I occasionally omit the cream of tartar and sub baking powder to cut back on the "tart" taste for when kids will be the main consumer and they still turn out yummy and addictive.

Cooked for 8 minutes @ 375, the kids really liked these.  They were very easy to make and bake.  This is a winner.

These are AMAZING! The only thing I do differently is to double the cinnamon sugar mixture because you can never have too much when it comes to snickerdoodles. My family LOVES these cookies!

This was a great cookie!  I had to add about a half a cup of extra flour since the dough was way too sticky.  I rolled some in cinnamon sugar mixture and some I just baked them plain.  My family loved them both ways.  This is a great and eay recipe and I will definitely make it again.

My co-workers and husband ate it up like nothing!  8 min is perfect!  Before popping into oven, I added a little pinch of the cinnamon sugar on top of dough and came out with perfect sugar!
(Edit: The second time around, I used applesauce instead of butter to cut down on calories.  The Snickerdoodles came out fluffly and soft, still delicious.  Mix may be a little runny if you use applesauce, so just put in fridge/freezer to help harden the mix a little bit)

Perfect! I followed the recipe exactly only substituting lemon juice for cream of tartar. These came out perfect. I make snickerdoodles every year for my husband because they are his favorite and this recipe is the best by far. I made 8 dozen of them for a Cookie Exchange party and then I just made another 8 dozen for Christmas.....everyone raved about them. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband is not big on sweets but the one thing he grew up on was Snickerdoodles and so i decided to make them for him this Christmas.  Not only did my husband love them, but so did all the rest of our holiday guests.  They turned out chewy and soft, the perfect texture and they were not too sweet.  Great for dunking in milk... i would highly recommend this recipe, i know i will definitely be making them again.

I love this recipe.  Easy to make and they bake fast.  I suggest baking for less time than stated.  It took only about 5 minutes for smaller rounds of dough.  This one is a keeper!

These are exactly the kind of snickerdoodle my grandma used to make! They came out light and fluffy from the oven. In fact, I even squished my dough balls down a bit after rolling them in the cinnamon and sugar as they didn't flatten as much as I had wanted the first batch.

recipe was amazing! the cookies were soft and chewy on the inside, with the slightest bit of crunch on the outside! Family raved about them! I used 3 tsp of cinnamon and 4 tsp of sugar bc I like the cookies to be really well coated.

These are so good. They have the perfect balance of flavors between the butter sugar and cinnamon. I rolled my dough balls in a "healthy" amount of sugar and cinnamon and had beautiful results. I hate snicker doodles that leave you wanting just a little more topping so this is a good way to fix that.

So simple, so delicious! I follow this recipe step by step and they turn out perfect each time. Watch your time... I usually start with 10 minutes and end up taking the second batch out after 9 minutes. You don't want to overcook these.

Wonderful cookies! Delicious! The only thing I did different was use 3 tablespoons white sugar and 3 teaspoons cinnamon to roll the dough in (instead of 2 tblspoons sugar/2 teaspoons cin) because 2 was not enough.

My friends that are snickerdoodle fans just loved these cookies.  I don't think I ever had a snickerdoodle until i made these and I loved them.  They came out perfectly golden and cracked just like in the picture.

My mom used to make Snickerdoodles and i wasn't able to get her recipe. I decided yesterday that i wanted to make them... so i searched and searched. This recipe was easy and sounded really good.  So i made my first snickerdoodles ever last night. They turned out nice and chewy and ohhh so yummy. I didn't have cream of tartar (which i thought i did) so i substituted baking powder, i also added a little bit of almond extract. My 9 year old daughter and i did the red and green sugars for xmas and i did the traditional Sugar and Cinnamon. Thanks for this.. a recipe that is going in my recipe book for sure!

This is a great recipe for the perfect snickerdoodle. I initially baked them according to recipe, and they provided a nice crunchy cookie, but I really prefer a chewier cookie. On the rest of my batches, I lowered the temp to 375 and took them out after about 7-71/2 minutes. I needed them to stay soft for a while so I could give them away in treat tins. They were perfect, and lasted for several days. They were soft, while still having a nice crunch around the edges. Also, I subbed lemon juice fro cream of tartar because I don't care for it.

Husband said he has tasted better but his favorite cookies are Snickerdoodles. Therefore, he is very particular to the point of being an _______! I think next time I make this, I'm going to try 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.

Oh. My. God. I'm not a fan of snickerdoodles at all, but my family is so I made these. I have to say - these turned out absolutely amazing.  Definitely saving this recipe and making more in the future! It did only make about 24 cookies for me, though.

These are really good cookies. The dough is great to work with. Just be sure to refrigerate it, and it won't get sticky on you. I placed the dough back in the fridge after each sheet was placed in the oven to keep it cool.  I baked these at 375 degrees for 8 minutes like a lot of other reviewers did and that was the perfect temperature and time.

Delicious but the bottom of my cookies burnt when I baked for 8 mins @ 400 in my electric oven.  So next time I'm going to try 375.  I'm not giving up!  I used 3 tsp of Vietnamese Cinnamon (very sweet smelling) and about 3.5 TBS of white sugar.  I agree with other reviewers, they taste better after sitting for a while, I enjoyed them much better the next day.

This is the best snickerdoodle cookie I have ever eaten. I did follow another reviewer and baked it for 8 mins. (I didn't want the edge to crisp) This is definitely going into the recipe box.

I made these cookies last year and they were a big hit.  I only changed one thing.  I only dipped the top of the cookies into the cinnamon sugar.  In my new oven, I baked them for exactly 12 mins and they came out perfect.  Making them again this year for the holidays

Followed the cookie recipe to a T and only altered the sugar/cinnamon coating measurements...i tripled the coating so that each cookie would have lots of sugar/cinnamon on it. They are still chewy 5 days after having baked them! This is the best recipe!

These were great!  I subbed butter for shortening, lemon juice for cream of tartar, doubled the sugar & cinnamon mix and baked for 8 minutes.  My cookies turned out more crispy than chewy, but they are certainly delicious!

Just baked these this afternoon to bring in to work - I work in a cancer hospital pharmacy and shared the cookies with the doctors and nurses. Trust me, once they have a good cookie, word spreads. They were gone within an hour and I even had some overnight nurses disappointed that they missed out. I followed the recipe exactly except I followed the idea to toss the cookie dough balls in a bag of sugar/cinnamon mixture and baked at 375 for 8 min EXACT (1 min later and they started to burn). So easy to make! Thank you!

This recipe really is fantastic!  I didn't have shortening on hand, so I substituted butter.  I also didn't have cream of tartar, so I substituted 4 teaspoons of baking powder and left out the baking soda.  I baked them for 7 minutes.  They were perfect!  I can't say if they were any better than the original recipe because I haven't made it that way yet, but if you're in a bind and don't have those ingredients on hand, these subs still turned out 5 star cookies!

Good recipe, very very soft when they come out, the next day they were a bit too crunchy for me, I put some bread in the Tupperware and it helped out some. The key is a mix of butter and shortening!

Flavor was good, at first, the texture was very hard and crispy though.  Nothing soft and chewy.  The butter was right out of the fridge when I started mixing not room temp.  I may try this again with warmer butter but probably not.  They softened as the sat on the counter the next few days and we ended up liking them fairly well.

These were fabulous!  I had to refrigerate them before rolling (New Orleans weather) and used a plastic baggy for the cinna-sugar.  Cooked for 8 minutes and let sit 1 minute on the pan before removing.  I discovered my just-purchased flour had bugs so I had to use cake flour instead (with w 2 tbsp added for each cup all-purpose).  They turned out great!

Never had a snickerdoodle before. It's really good! Used margarine instead of butter. Turned out fine.

Words cannot describe the deliciousness of this cookie! I followed the recipe to a T but placed the cinnamon and sugar in a ziploc and shook it with one cookie in it at a time.  They are picture perfect and amazing! They looked underdone but I followed the recipe and only baked them for 8 minutes.  Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe!

The best EVER! From reading the previous reviews, I did increase the sugar/cinnamon, although I didn't need to, and I baked for exactly 8 minutes. Perfect cookies! Mine were perhaps a little larger than than they're supposed to be, I only got 5 dozen from a double batch, but I'm told that I need to make some more tomorrow!

Made these for my friends birthday yesterday. They turned out soooo good! I really like how they are not too sweet. I baked them exactly 8 minutes and they were nice and soft in the middle. Great recipe!

My absolutely favorite snickerdoodle recipe!!  The cookies come out perfect, not too hard, not too soft and they stay that way for several days (although ours usually don't last the long...).  Thanks for the great recipe!

Soft, Chewy and perfect. I just followed the instruction exactly and they came out wonderful! I only put them in the oven for 7 min then pulled them out to let them cook the rest of the way on the pan.

These are better than my mom's! The only thing I changed was the ratio of sugar to cinnamon. Using that combination was just too spicy for me. I suggest increasing the sugar to 3 T and decreasing the cinnamon to 1t. I gave these to my sister in law as a house-warming gift. They're excellent.

I realize this recipe probably does NOT need one more review, I had to add my praise for a perfect snickerdoodle recipe. I have tried many, but this is the best - probably because of the mix of butter and shortening. I should also add that I creamed the butter/shortening and sugar for a long time, probably 3-5 minutes. I made a complete batch to take to a casual dinner party and eight people gobbled them all up. Thanks Mrs. Sigg - this is the only recipe I'll ever use again. My husband loves them, and he is a cookie connisseur.

This is the best snickerdoodle recipe I've tried, they came out perfect.  I recommend sifting the dry ingredients so you don't end up with any clumps of cream of tartar in the dough. The dough was very soft but wasn't sticky.  Used the plastic bag method to coat with sugar as recommended by other reviewers.

These cookies are awesome! I did not have enough cinnamon/sugar mixture so I started coating the cookies in just sugar and they also tasted great. Do not overbake them - they should still be a little soft when they come out of the oven. I can't wait to make these again.

I have lost count of how many batches I've made, and every single cookie was happily devoured by friends, family and coworkers. It never disappoints! The dough was a bit harder to handle when a storm rolled through Seattle recently, but the cookies still turned out perfectly.

Best Snickerdoodles EVER!!!!!! I read someone elses review that said they used white vinegar instead of cream of tarter, which I was out of so I made this recipe specifically. Then I discovered I also only had 1 of the 2 tsp. needed and substituted maple syrup for the extra tsp. My husband added a pinch of nutmeg to the sugar/cinn. roll at the end, and not only did they get voted best cookie at his company party, my mom in law loved them so much she wanted the recipe and insists on doing it complete with substitutions.

VERY tasty. Although the cooking time for mine was more in the 12-15min range. I did end up baking them a little too long (about 17mins) so they came out crunchy, but they still tasted fantastic and the cookie itself was really light. I still have half of the cookie dough left that I froze and plan to fix probably tomorrow. :)

Turned out perfect.  Most snickerdoodle recipes seem to use all shortening; I think using 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening does make the difference in this recipe.  These were nice and soft and so easy to make.

These cookies are wonderful. I carefully read other members reviews and the only change I made was added 1 teas. baking powder along with the baking soda and cream of tarter. They came out fluffy and soft. Very yummy! ***UPDATE** I made these again and due to diet changes I only have margarine in the house, I didn't think it would make much of a difference, boy I was wrong! It is VERY VERY important that you use only butter, no substitutes. Margarine turned them flat and crispy, despite that I use fresh baking powder & baking soda. Using butter keeps them soft & round.

My first time making snickerdoodles and they were fabulous! I substituted the 4 tsp. of white vinegar for the 2 tsp. cream of tartar and they came out great. I was worried about tasting vinegar in them, but that's not the case at all. I baked these for 8 minutes and they were a perfect consistency. I'm doubling these up for a Halloween party this week. Thanks for sharing!

They are tasty but flat... but I didn't think that was a big deal. I definitely agree that you should watch these carefully as to not overcook them. I had to bake them for about 9 minutes before pulling them out.

These were absolutely delicious! My husband fell in love with me all over again when he took his first bite!  However, I didn't really like the tangy aftertaste that I guess is from the cream of tartar and maybe not letting the cookies cook quite long enough- I wanted them to be a bit chewy (which is what my husband loved about them).

Wow...these are so yummy!! They came out perfectly crisp on the outside and so deliciously soft on the inside. These didn't crackle as well as other snicker doodle recipes I've used, but the taste is phenomenal!

These were good and simple to make. Used all margarine because that's all I had. Used more sugar and cinnamon and took the very helpful advice of putting it in a sandwich bag to roll the balls in. I'm not a big fan of the cream of tartar taste in it so will definitely sub lemon juice. It wasn't flat, dry, or crunchy at all. The only thing that bothered me was that I couldn't get it to crackle. 12/4/10 - Just finished making 30 dozen of these... and lived! I used butter flavored crisco and vinegar to replace the cream of tartar. Loved it this way! I also chilled the dough this time, which I think helped with the puffiness. Changed rating from 4 to 5 stars.

These turned out pretty good.  I wished they were softer, not sure what I'll alter to make it softer next time.  Probably buy new baking items (baking powder, soda and cream of tarter), but they're pretty fresh right now!  Everyone loved them.  I used whole wheat baking powder and nobody seemed to notice.  I did, and it will suffice to make them a bit "healthier" but cookies aren't supposed to be healthy, they're supposed to be good!

I wanted to try something different from my usual recipe, and this was it.  If you like a flatter, crisper cookie, this is a great recipe. You definitly don't want to overbake these.  I think I prefer an all-butter recipe for flavor, though.

These cookies are great! Mine did come out a little flat but that's because my baking soda is no good. The taste was excellent though. I did adjust the temp to 375.

These are really good.  I did have trouble with them spreading too much,and I used a brand new box of baking soda, so I put the dough in the frig for a couple of hours and they baked up perfectly.

These were wonderful!  I did decrease the tartar just a little to make them less tart and I also added some fresh grated nutmeg to the sugar/cinnamon mix.  I made these once with all butter and once with the butter/shortening as written.  I definitely prefer the butter/shortening mixture.  Just be careful not to over cook them!

These were perfect, just the way I remembered them from being a child.  I used I Can't Believe Its Not Butter Cooking & Baking.  This was the first time I've used this to bake and was a little nervous, but it worked great. The only changes I made were that I mixed everything by hand and increased the amount of cinnamon and sugar.  I only needed to bake mine for 7 minutes at 400 degrees and removed them from the cookie sheet right away.  They were crisp on the outside and soft in the middle.  I'll definitely be making these again.

On my first attempt, I tried to cut them into shapes like sugar cookies...apparently, snickerdoodles don't like this. Second try, I used all butter (no shortening, I think it makes cookies crumbly) and some lemon juice instead of cream of tartar (really nice flavor) and they came out perfect. I also added some nutmeg to the rolling mix.

I substituted Smart Balance Spread for the shortening and kept the butter, because I don't generally keep shortening in the house.    It worked beautifully!

The cookies are always delicious. I do have a question though: I follow the recipe exactly but have only been able to get the beautiful cracked texture once (when I used a different oven). I really like how they crack and get crunchy on the outside and stay soft on the inside, what was different and how can i try to recreate this effect with my oven...is it the temperature maybe?? any suggestion will help!

Perfectly perfect! This is similar to my keeper recipe, but it ties! I used 1/4c. more flour because I live in high altitute (CO). My first tray was puffy and a bit on the smal side, so with the same sized dough balls I gently patted the second tray down with the flat part of a knife. This tray turned out more like the featured picture. I will use this method for this recipe again. Thank you!

The flavor was good. However, the dough was sticky; and the cookies were rather flat and didn't have the usual fluffy and cracked appearance of a snickerdoodle cookie. I followed the recommendation to bake them at 375 degrees for 8 minutes; then I removed the cookies from the baking stone right away and placed them on a cooling rack.

"Crispy edges, and chewy centers" are exactly how these cookies turn out. Snickerdoodles are my seven-year old's favorite cookie, and he has been bragging about these since we made them together! Let's just say a batch lasted about 24 hours... :)

Oh, Yummy!  These are delicious! I followed the other reviews and only baked them for 8 minutes exactly and then put them on a cooling rack.  They came out crisp on the outside and chewy in the center which I've always had trouble achieving before!

Ok, so I made these cookies...and they were awesome! They made like exactly the right number of cookies, which was pretty pleasing. I took them to a chruch picnic, in a large container, and ten minutes later, they were all gone...including the crumbs! I would SO make them again! Plus, the rolling part is the funnest!

Really good! I only did three things differently. I left out the salt, and instead of butter, used all shortening. I also read it was better to use your hands for this, but I used the paddle attachment of my Kitchenaid. Once it was blended, I took it out and shaped it. I made the coating in a small bowl that I rolled the balls of dough around in. I baked it at 400 for exactly eight minutes. They were VERY puffed up and fragile, but hardened as they cooled.   Just the right texture of chewy, and not sickeningly sweet. My husband LOVED them, and he doesn't normally like cinnamon. So good!

These are good for snickerdoodles. My boyfriend, who does not like sweets, loves them. I'd still take a chocolate chip cookie over a snickersoodle... But! These were really good.

This is a wonderful recipe! I hadn't made Snickerdoodles in a while so I figured I'd look for a new recipe and this one worked out perfectly.  I added my own touches of course, but overall the recipe was quick, simple, and I got rave reviews.  Thank you Mrs. Sigg!

Excellent recipe..  be sure not to overbake them.  I made a double-batch and had tons of big wonderful cookies.  Everyone devoured them!  Entire family loved them and said it's a keeper.

I think I did something wrong..The dough was too doughy and I couldn't form a ball. So I ended up with a snicker doodle cake. But overall they were good. The kids didn't mind.

I made these without the shortening- didn't have any, so I used butter.  I added Heath toffee chips like they do with the Seattles Best snickerdoodles. They turned out great.  I will make these again!

I think these cookies are very good. They were a little harder than I intended them to be, but I think its because I made them too small. Towards the end I started making dough balls a little bigger and they're excellent. Love them! Will make again.

These are very good. Everyone loved them.  I used margarine instead of butter b/c that is all I had.  Definately won't look any further for a Snickerdoodle recipe.

These are excellent! I added a few more tablespoons of flour due to humidity.I baked for 8 minutes, then cooled for few more on the sheet before removing. Crisp on the outside and a nice chewy texture.

Probably the best snickerdoodle recipe I've ever made as far as how they look. I've made them twice. First time they tasted perfect, second time a little lacking in flavor, but still good. Probably something I did! Great recipe!

This was a GREAT recipe!  My 12 year old made these and I took them to work.  Everyone raved about how great they were. One change that we made is putting a little nutmeg in the cinnamon and sugar that you roll the dough in. We also used a little more of that then the recipe called for.

A very good snickerdoodle.  My snickerdoodle recipes have always turned out a flat cookie, but not this one.  I like the flavor of more cream of tarter than the average snickerdoodle, too.  It's a keeper.

The dough is way to sticky to even roll. Maybe I shouldnt have used large eggs? I cant even think of how to make it better. maybe less shortening?

These are fabulous. Crunchy edge and chewy center- just how I like them! I followed the recipe completely and ended up baking mine for 9 minutes. It made 3, 16 cookie batches. I know some people had trouble with their cookies and it was suggested to check your cream of tarter. I will admit, mine was expired but I used it anyways and it was fine! I will always keep this recipe close by!

My friend (who has very little cooking/baking experience) and I made these last night. They were very easy to make and they are so good! We baked our on parchement paper and the sugar/cinnamon coated bottoms turned out wonderful. I followed the other's tips of baking for exactly 8 minutes and letting them sit for exactly 1 minute on the baking sheet before transferring to a cooling rack. We might have made our cookies a little small, since we got 57 out of the batch, but I think they're the pefect size! I definitely plan to make again!

UPDATE: ALTHOUGH STILL YUMMY DAYS LATER, I THINK THESE ARE BEST FRESH OUT OF THE OVEN ("NOTHING" COMAPRES IMHO). I EVEN TRIED SPRITZING WITH H2O BEFORE REHEATING IN THE MICROWAVE AS ONE REVIEWER SUGGESTED.... Oooh! These are SOOOOO good!!! Made A 1/2 batch for my bf & I. B/c I used my 3 T PC scoop, I only had enough dough for 12 cookies (as opposed to 24 sm. ones). I pretty much followed Beth's directions exactly, except for the following: a) I added 1/2 c. of Hershey's mini cinnamon chips to my dough (I was trying to duplicate Noodles & Company's snickerdoodles which have cinnamon chip "chunks" in them), b) I upped the cinnamon-sugar mix. to 2 T sugar / 2 t cinnamon and, for ease, comb. both in a lg. Ziplock bag & gently dipped ea. "formed" cookie ball into the mix. (note: I did not shake as others have advised against doing so...), & c) baked my cookies on parchment lined baking sheets for 11 min. The finished cookies were crispy around the edges & soft in the center. One note: I suggest (as some others have also) to dip only the tops of your cookie dough into the cinn.-sugar mix. My oven was smoking (fire extinguisher please...) b/c the bottoms of some of my cookies were burning! I noticed just in the nick of time, so I was able to salvage all but a few of them. Beth, you've done it again! These are incredible, and, by far the best cookie I've ever made. You ARE the cookie queen (hehe!) :)

This is an awesome recipe. I baked these cookies for my brothers, niece, and nephew and they can't keep their hands off of them (neither can I)! I substituted almond extract for the vanilla extract, but it tastes very similar, and you can't really tell a big difference. I made a mistake that turned out good also - I used bread flour instead of all-purpose. The cookies were puffier, chewier, and lighter. -teenbaker.

WOW!!! I don't normally like snicker doodles, but they were for a cookie gift, so I tried one.  I ended up making a double batch so that we could keep some.  I have tried her Peanut Butter cookies also and they too were outstanding! I didn't make any variations, just definitely take them out after 8 minutes and leave them on the cookie sheet for an extra minute.  Sooooo good!

I followed the advice of others and took them out at 8 minutes and they were absolutely perfect! Much better than the last snickerdoodle recipe i tried.

I think these have potential for being a lot better than I made them.  The dough was hard to work with so I added extra flour, which I shouldn't have done.  I didn't have cream of tartar so I used white vinegar, which was fine.  The other thing was that when I took them out of the oven at 8 minutes, like other reviewers suggested, they were not done in the middle even when I let them sit on the pan for a bit.  I will try these again without the extra flour and will try a batch at 9-10 minutes and see what happens.  Otherwise, great taste, and they looked pretty.

REALLY good!  good enough that i need not ever buy them from anywhere ever again!  didn't have any cream of tartar - used 4tsp of lemon juice instead.  no complaints here.  delicious!  will make again... oh also i was using two different cookie sheets - one dark and one light - it seemed to take twice as long for them to cook on the light sheet.  i don't know if that's... normal but thought it worth mentioning!  p.s. i upped these to 5 stars after sitting on them for a couple days.  they're WONDERFUL!

This recipe has been a family favorite since I found it.  These bake up perfectly, and look very pretty with some demerara sugar on top in addition to the cinnamon sugar.  Took a blue ribbon at the county fair with these as well.

I made these cookies bigger than they were suppose to be, thus having to make them cook them longer.  They turned out wonderfully, a little flatter than I would want but they were great! Absolutely great!

The flavor is definately there in these cookies! Very yummy! The second batch to go on the over came out better being cooked at about 13 minutes in my oven. My dough was very sticky when rolling. Just used a lot of flour on my hands.

You must make these cookies! They are so deliscious! Didn't change a thing and they came out PERFECT! Kids are gobbling them up I'm sure there won't be any left for tomorrow's snacks. I'm definitely making these again! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Congrats  Betty...These are as good as it gets.  I have tried others and most are similar but yours are #1.  The most critical part is bake time.  All ovens are different and so it takes a little practice.  A minute or two can make a difference with these.  Also I have goine to using parchment paper for cookies and such.  Nice control feature.  No more burned or too dark bottoms.  I just put it on top of cheap cookie sheets and use that same ones until the batch is done.   Thanks, Lee

I must have made them a little big since it only made 38 cookies, and I needed a little bit more cinnamon sugar than it called for.  They taste great!

Ohh these were absolutely delicious! I simply could not keep out of them!! No they do not come out puffy but I like them in their original shape so I can taste more of the outer coating. :) My favorite part of these cookies is they way they spread in the oven. usually I am very OCD about rolling balls of cookies; with many recipes it is so easy to get inconsistent cookies that differ in size and shape, but these all came out in perfect circles! Sooo great! They were crispy at the edges and chewy in the middle the day I baked them, but even when I tightly plastic wrapped them, they lost crispiness the next day. They became chewy, but I guess that's better than lots of cookies that become rock hard the next day right? Also, I had to take an intermission and left coated, rolled cookie dough balls for a hour. When I came back and recoated them, they baked to have much bigger cracks than the ones I bake right away.. I thought it looked a lot nicer. Not sure how this works but hope it helps! By the way, whisk the dry ingredients besides the sugar in a separate bowl. In a bigger bowl, cream the shortening, butter, and sugar by hand for about 2-3 minutes until it's pale yellow, but not fluffy. Then add the other wet ingredients, mix, add the dry ingredients... mix until blended. Don't overmix or else it becomes cakey. The creaming part is crucial for the chewiness and texture of the cookie. Do NOT be afraid to overcoat these, they never come out too sweet!

Just what I hoped they would be! Crisp edges and a soft chewy center. Not over baking is crucial!

I've made these twice now. The first time as written and they were DELISH!! I always have cookies on hand for my boyfriend, and he gave these 2 thumbs way up! The second time I made them I didn't realize I had only whole wheat flour and no AP Flour...so I improvised and made them with the WW, not as great as the regular (didn't taste as sweet) but they still got 2 thumbs up!

I don't know if it's just me... but whenever I make snickerdoodles, it just puffs up into a mound and never flattens out.. I may want to try to flatten them before baking next time. There was a distinct baking soda taste in this recipe, I will probably reduce it next time. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup. Great recipe though!!

Great cookies! This was my first time making Snickerdoodles and it was very easy. I didn't have cream of tartar so I used lemon juice instead. I followed others' suggestions and took them out of the oven at 8 mins. They were puffy and chewy. They are a little too sugary for me, but I'll just play around with that. Will make this again!

These are FANTASTIC!!!  My last batch is still in the oven and I've already eaten four!  I'll have to put away the rest or there won't be any for my family.  The flavor of these is much better than my snickerdoodle recipe.  Mine puffed up nicely, but aren't too puffy--they are perfect.  I was a little paranoid about over-baking them after reading all of the reviews, and my first batch was actually a little under-done.  For my oven, 8 minutes at 400 is just right.  Thanks for a new great recipe for my husband's favorite kind of cookie!

i didnt have cream of tartar so i was really worried on how these would turn out; but i did some digging and found that 4 tsp of baking soda instead of the called amounts of tartar and baking soda was ok. these turned out amazing!! after 8 min or so these were really soft and chewy as a snickerdoodle should be.

Very easy to make and the texture is great - soft and chewy inside with crisp edges. I would cut down on the sugar a bit next time for my own tastes, but everyone else in the family thought they were fine the way they are.

Wonderful cookie --- soft on the inside and crunchy on outside.  I agreed with another baker and used all butter and they turned out great.  Also, thank you Nana who suggested putting vege shortening on hands to make rolling easier, definately helped!

Terrific snickerdoodle recipe. Super fast and easy to make. The only thing i did different was to lower the oven temp. slightly (375) and cook for 7 minutes.

These are THE best snickerdoodles I have ever eaten.  I will eat them all if my kids and hubby weren't home to help.  They don't need anything extra or changed they're perfect the way they are.

I made these at work and heard rave reviews!!! One officer said they are the best cookies ever and is begging for them again so I'm sure they're a cookie I'll be making often. The only thing I did different was I used more sugar in the sugar/cinnamon mix to roll them in, and I use a convection oven at work so baked them at 325 degrees using low fan for 12 minutes.

Awesome! I followed exactly except I used 2 tsp of lemon juice instead of 2 tsp cream of tartar. I put cinn-sugar mix in small plastic baggie, put about four dough balls in at at time and shook to coat. I didn't do more than 4 or they would just stick together. Thank you for recipe!

This cookie recipe changed my favorite cookie from double chocolate brownie to snickerdoodles! These come out perfectly every time. Make sure not to over cook, just until they start to crack on top. Let them set and cool so they remain chewy. I added 1/2 a tablespoon of cinnamon to the base mixture to give it more of a cinnamon sugar flavor. Delicious.

Snickerdoodles are my husband's favorite cookie and this recipe never disappoints! Be careful of the cooking time. I've found that they turn out perfectly if I pull them out of the oven before they seem quite done. I also add cinnamon chips or toffee pieces on occasion for something a little different.

Wow, yum! I forgot how much I love snickerdoodles. After reading the reviews, I upped the topping to 3 T and 3.5 tsp (and put it in a plastic baggie), I also set my oven to slightly less than 400 because my oven tends to be pretty hot. I hand-mixed everything, and kept the dough in the fridge while I cleaned everything up and pre-heated the oven in hopes that the cookies wouldn't spread out too much while they baked. I took them out when they were cracked but still lightly wet-looking in the cracks, which was around 7ish minutes for me. They turned out great! The texture is awesome and the flavor couldn't be better. We'll see if there are any left by the time my boyfriend gets in town tomorrow, ha!

I give this 5 stars -- used more sugar/cinnamon mix for the whole batch.  Made mine larger (increase your baking time; watch carefully).  These freeze very well in an airtight container.  I prefer storing mine in my Lock & Lock brand.  As a quick reminder to beginner bakers:  Grease your hands with a little vegetable shortening when rolling the balls (goes much easier/faster).

I made this recipe as written & it was outstanding.  Some reviews said they replaced the cream of tartar with baking powder.  I think the cream of tartar is what sets this recipe apart and gives it a unique taste.  Be careful not to overbake & I left the baked cookies set on the cookie sheet for about 2 minutes before removing because they are soft.

WOW!  These are super good.  I have an "old reliable" recipe that I usually use.  It is similar to this one but this one uses less flour. I like this one better.  This is a soft and tender cookie.  Do not overbake them.  I followed the directions exactly and they came out great!

i changed a lot of things so this isnt really a very fair review. i saw that a lot of people were complaining about flat cookies so i decided to  half a teaspoon of baking powder on top of the cream of tartar and baking soda. that was not the best decision ive ever made. they turned out more cakelike than i like my cookies. I also made them gluten free using brown rice flour, quinoa flour and bob's red mill Gluten free flour mix. Gluten free baking is always a little different. I also used 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar for the cookie dough instead of all white sugar. im pretty sure that was a good decision. next time i make these i wont try to change the recipe so much. very pretty cookies!

Oh, man are these ever good!  I made them just as the recipe states, ended up baking for 10 minutes, rotating the two cookie sheets I had going half way through.  Perfection, just the way they are!  My husband (who is a chocolate freak and usually doesn't think it's worth it if dessert doesn't have any chocolate in there) loved these.  Definitely will make again.

Great Recipe.  We made them today with colored sugar for Easter cookies.  A note on the baking time.  I've baked them with a metal pan and a Pampered Chef stone.  The stone needs the full 10 minutes while the dark metal pan you have to get them out of the oven and off the pan at 8 minutes.

Didn't have shortening, just used butter- pulled them out when they were wrinkled. These are the best snickerdoodles! My husband is going to love them. I just got them out of the oven and I ate two while they were still hot.

WOW. I just made these using everything just as the recipe followed. I made them a little bigger, so it took probably 9-10 minutes for the cookies to cook. I took them out when the edges started to firm up so that when I poked it the while edge moved, nit judge the spot I touched. My family loves. It made about 22 cookies. One of the easiest cleaning and baking dessert. I made it for a quick night for a little get together and everyone loved it!!!

Make sure they are taken out early, they are easy to over cook. Great cookies for grown ups, not too sweet.  But plain enough that kids will like them also.

Phenomenal recipe! I have never been a big fan of Snickerdoodle, but I promised to make them for someone else and they were just perfect. Will definitely be making these again!

The whole family loves these cookies.  So crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  The flavor just begs you to eat more.

Really good recipe. Thanks for sharing it! I thought I had the perfect recipe for Snickerdoodles from a local grocery store, but the butter/shortening mix of Mrs. Sigg's recipe lightened the cookies up, gave them a hint of "pastry".

I keep coming back to this recipe again and again.  It is by far the best snickerdoodle recipe I have tried!  Now there is NO other.  I don't know who Mrs. Sigg's is but she has THE recipe.

this is a very good sugar cookie base. i don't think i've ever eaten a snickerdoodle before, so I can't rate this against any other.. I just know that w/out the adjustments i made, this would have been a great sugar cookie rolled in cinn/sugar.. but rather bland.   I used all butter, baked for 8mins as suggested, and added a bag of cinnammon chips that i had on hand. these came out very good, hubby loves em.   I'm going to try the recipe and add M&M's, sans cinn/sugar, just like bakeries do.

Ugh, I screwed this one too...I'll post my mistake here so it's not repeated by anyone...do NOT use baking soda in place of baking powder...you'll get acidic cookies from the cream of tartar. I still think this has too much cream of tartar though, I would use half or do the lemon juice...I'm not a snickerdooddle fan( too boring of a cookie for me) but after sitting out for a day the acidic taste did die down and tasted better.

More a sugar cookie than a snickerdoodle.  I suggest NOT adding brown sugar to the ball rolling mixture.  I used 1 C butter instead of half C butter and half C shortening.  Also, my one regret was not adding a touch of nutmeg.  The cookies tasted great, but they just tasted like sugar cookies.  This recipe is great but I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

These were good, but I also had a little trouble with them going flat.  Still, very tasty, crisp edges chewy centers... even after 2 days in the Tupperware.

I have never had a Snickerdoodle in my life before today. These cookies are DELICIOUS and so easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly the way it said and they turned out perfect. Not flat, a little puffy, soft in the middle, crispy edges and a little chewy. All around a really perfect cookie!

Let me start by saying I usually only rate a recipe if I am giving it 5 stars, however considering this recipes great ratings I just had to review it.  My son LOVES snickerdoodles and although I am avid baker this is one cookie I just never tried to bake so I figured I'd give it a shot after seeing this one's  rave reviews.  I followed the recipe to the T with the exception of using all butter and not shortening because I rarely use shortening in my baking (butter just gives better flavor and better results and is healthier).  I had no problems with the dough and they baked up nicely after 9-10 minutes, not as puffy as I hoped, but good enough.  However all these taste like is a jazzed up sugar cookie. These do not tast like true snickerdoodles.  They are rather bland.  My son only ate 1 cookie and the rest have been sitting on the counter...this says alot b/c he usually will finish off a batch of cookies in two days. My husband likes them but not enough to request them again...I decided to give this 3 stars only because they did taste a little better the next day. If you're looking for a true snickerdoodle recipe that tastes like the ones you buy in a store or coffee shop, keep searching, I know I am.

WONDERFUL! My husband is a VERY particular connoisseur of snickerdoodles, and he claimed these as the best he's ever had. Helpful tip, make sure your baking soda is not expired-- this will keep them from going flat. And don't over-dredge the cookie in the cinnamon. Too much cinnamon leaves the bad aftertaste. Thanks Mrs. Sigg!

Very good snickerdoodle flavor, but the cookies were very crunchy not soft on the inside as my family prefers.  I will make again but will try reducing the baking time and the oven temp to see if that helps, otherwise I will continue searching for another snickerdoodle recipe.

FABULOUS! My family couldn't get enough of these at Christmas! I second the tip about trashing a bit of the egg white off the top to keep them fluffy and make sure to remove them from the pan immediately! Chewy in the middle and crispy edges... so DELICIOUS!

Loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and did not have trouble as others stated with my cookies flattening out when baked.  I also thought that the sugar/cinnamon measurements for topping the cookies before cooking were more than enough!

Simple and wonderful cookie recipe. A bit salty and I will probably either cut back a tad next time (which is odd because I love salty foods).  Used the organic shortening from whole foods and perhaps this has something to do with it.

These are GREAT! I get RAVES everytime I make them and plenty of requests for the recipe. I found it best to take the top rack out at 7 minutes and bottom out at 7 and a half since my stove is old and cooks a little hotter than what it's supposed to. Take them immediately off the pan. I've made several batches and I assure the easiest way to get these covered in cinnamon and sugar is to use a small ice cream scoop to dip some out of the bowl and onto a plate with the mixture then cover the top with the mixture and roll it around to get the best even coating without the dough sticking to your hands. Works great is a fun way to spend time with the kids!

I'm baking a batch of these now while my husband is out of town. Otherwise he eats them up as soon as they come out of the oven! Love this recipe, they are a huge hit around here. They're crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Only time I've had a problem with them flattening is if I've creamed the fat/sugars for too long.  If overmixed they still taste good but are flat and ugly.

Some of the best snickerdoodles out there!  I've been using this recipe for about 5 years and always recieve great reviews.  I usually only use about 1/4c shortening and 3/4c butter.  I add a little extra cinnamon and vanilla to the dough, too.

It was pretty cakey and puffy, but sooooo good nonetheless. Also, this was the first snickerdoodle I've ever had, so I'm not exactly sure what they're supposed to be like, but it's a yummy cookie :)

ps. i used the substitute for cream of tartar (4tsp lemon juice) and it was goooood.

These cookies are amazing. I like them super-soft, so I turn down the oven to 335 degrees and bake slightly longer, about 12 minutes. The cookies are melt-in-your-mouth delicious.

These snickerdoodles are the best!  I followed the recipe except used more sugar and cinnamon at the end to roll the dough in. Watch the oven temperature, the bottoms burn quick if left in past 8 minutes but it could have been my oven.  Thanks for such a wonderful cookie!

I have made this my standard Snickerdoodle recipe.  Sometimes I roll in a combo of cinnamon, sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and or allspice.  Makes it sort of a spiced Snickerdoodle.  Great!

Oh wow, I have never had snicker doodles and I accidentally put the oven on 325 instead of 400...I even forgot the shortening (DONT EVER FORGET) but they were still easy and simple. I LOVED THEM. They are my new favorite cookies and has been named my new holiday cookie. 

Seriously, if you have young children or you are terrible at baking this recipe will never go wrong.

I made these cookies with my 2 kids and they were really easy to make and tasted great! One note - I checked the first batch of cookies after 8 minutes and they didn't look like they were completely cooked, so I left them in for another 2 minutes. Big mistake! The bottoms of the cookies quickly burned. I kept the second batch in for 8 1/2 minutes and they were perfect.

This recipe is pretty good. The cookies have a great texture and the taste is great, but there is an acidy taste that I do not like. I would cut the Cream of Tartar in half to one teaspoon.. otherwise these are great!

Good cookie - I did notice the odd after taste though.  Probably the cream of tartar?   I don't think anyone else really noticed, at least no one said anything.  I would probably make them again but reduce the cream of tartar.

I think I made mine too big, cuz they took a lot longer to cook!  The dough was simple, and rolling and coating them took no time at all, but after 9 minutes they were still goo.  So I tried to move them to plates (per the instructions to immediately remove them) but they fell apart.  I thought maybe they'd keep hardening up.  After 15 mins or so I decided to pop them back in the oven for about 8 more minutes.  NOW they were delicious!!  I'll definitely try this again using tiny balls of cookies.  They were so yummy just a bit frustrating to put together.  :)

I hadn't made Snickerdoodles in years, mainly because I remembered them as being just 'so-so', but let me tell you that THIS recipe will be made often at our house!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and...oh, my Goodness, they were outstanding!

The dough was a cinch to mix up.  I used my 1 1/4" cookie scoop and got exactly 70 cookies!

I'll admit that I didn't think the cinnamon-sugar amounts would be enough for all that dough, but after coating the entire doughballs, (even the bottoms), there was still about 1/2 teaspoon leftover, so I poured it into my shaker bottle of cinn.-sugar in the spice rack.

These baked on my insulated cookie sheets, (Air-Bake), to perfection in exactly 8 minutes.

As instructed in the recipe, be sure to immediately remove the cookies from the pans or they WILL stick!

Thanks, Beth, for a wonderful recipe that I'll be proud to include in my Christmas gift baskets!

Followed the recipe to the letter other than chilling the dough for an hour before rolling it, and used the bakers method for measuring baking ingredients by weight and not by volume. These turned out perfect. Thanks! I also found that it does indeed need only 8 mins and not a second more, then immediately cool. A side note to people reading reviews to consider. High Quality ingredients in, produces a better quality product, always.

Best snickerdoodles ever!  I had no problems with the dough, and they turned out great.  One thing to mention, if you make about 1 inch balls, you'll have nice 3 - 3 1/2 cookies, but will only get about 2 1/2 dozen from the original recipe.

This recipe was delicious!  Baking them was my first attempt since junior high or high school (about 20-years).  I didn't follow the directions to a "t", since I fumbled my way through it and the kitchen.  I'm sure they'll be even more delicious as I continue to cultivate my baking skills once again.

I used a Pampered Chef large round baking stone when I made my first batch of these. Mistake! I took them out after 8 minutes and they were not done in the middle. I had to put them back in the oven for 5 more minutes. When I used my metal baking sheets they took exactly 8 minutes. I ran out of the cinnamon/sugar mixture and made more only the 2nd time around I used less cinnamon. Biggest problem was I didn't double the recipe as my family ate them just as fast as I made them. Very, very good!!

Wonderful! I didn't have shortening so I used 1 cup of butter. Perfect cookies. I got 60 cookies, the batter wasn't sticky and didn't need to be chilled.

Delicious! I baked for exactly 8 minutes and got a very soft, chewy texture.  The dough was pretty tacky for me to work with so I put it in the fridge for about 10 minutes and in between batches. That firmed it up so it was much easier to roll into balls.  Overall, it produced a yummy cookie! Thanks.

Oh goodness, but these were amazing!  A quick, easy cookie for snack time and they made a ton!  I had no issues with hard cookies.. and the kids gobbled them up still warm.  I never realized just how easy it was to make snickerdoodles.. I'll be making these often!

I found this recipe several years ago and it has been my families favorite ever since. I follow the recipe exactly as is with great results.  It takes a while to bake the whole batch so give yourself plenty of time.  Believe me, this recipe is worth it.

I am always looking for recipes that can easily be modified and made healthier. Although the cookies turned out good I am sure they would have been EVEN better had I followed the recipe exactly. Instead of shortening I used cinnamon applesauce and subbed half of the sugar with brown sugar. I think next time I might stick more closely to the recipe because it came out a bit cake-y. Otherwise it was a good recipe for quick and easy cookies.

This is the best Snickerdoodle recipe there is. I can't stress enough, not to over bake them. No matter what you think they look like. 7 minutes is perfect they set up as they cool. The acrid taste I think the one reviewer commented on, that is the taste of cream of Tarter, it doesn't matter how fresh it is. One advantage I think that I have on these is I ONLY use a Vanilla paste instead of liquid vanilla. Once you taste the paste version, you will always have the upper hand in everything that you bake.

This is by FAR the best Snickerdoodle recipe I've ever tried. Normally I fail miserably at making snickerdoodles (they have never EVER turned out) but this time I thought I'd give it a shot and they came out perfect! Everyone loved them and they were gone in two days. One note for sure though, is for those who don't know: The cookies will set, do not over cook them! I found 10 minutes was perfect in my oven.

Addictive.  Took these to work and they were gone in minutes. ALL OF THEM!  I followed the recipe except for I was out of vanilla, so I decided to use butter flavoring instead.  It just made them even more rich tasting.  I baked mine for 9 minutes.  I use a convection oven and placed three trays of cookies in at a time, thus, the extra minute was needed.  Just to experiment, I baked one batch for 10 minutes and they were perfect while warm, but after they cooled, they were crispy almost all the way through.  Still heavenly though!  I let my cookies cool on the cookie sheets, because this actually allows the cookies to maintain their chewiness.  All in all, I will use this as my default Snickerdoodle recipe in the future.

great cookies, ive never made snickerdoodles before but these were fast and easy.  I used the suggestion of dipping rather then rolling in the cin/sug mixture and i had absolutely no trouble with cookies sticking to the pan. I added about an extra 1/4 flour because my dough was to sticky to handle  ...OH and for those of you who didnt have cream of tartar, lemon juice or vinegar like me :) i omitted the cream of tartar and baking soda and used 4 tsp of baking powder....the only difference is i have nice big fluffy cookies but i like them like that....very delicious i will be adding these to my gift cookies this year

This recipe turned out to taste great, but I had to leave out the cream of tartar and the shortening since I didn't have it at hand. Even though the snickerdoodles tasted great, they turned out crumbly. I don't know if it was because of the ingredients I left out? I'd much appreciate some tips.

I have never made these before. If I didn't read everyone's reviews I would have been screwed. I'm on my fourth batch now. The first ones, I followed the above recipe perfectly. The second batch, I realized you can put Pam on the cookie sheet, (or else you will end up with 1/2 a cookie). I added 1/2 Cup more flour, scooped them with a cookie scooper and rolled them around with a tablespoon. Also, from reading reviews, I found out you really do need to take them out after 8 minutes, no matter what they look like.

This is almost the same recipe as the one in the Betty Crocker cookbook, except this one has vanilla. Mine don't come out flat, actually this is the most puffy cookie that I can make. Always delicious, you cannot go wrong with this recipe. I add more cinnamin to the top with the sugar.

I have owned this recipe since I got married in 1973.  I make it with all real butter, however, and find that adds to the lovely flavor.  I also add more cinnamon and a bit more sugar.  
To the reviewer who said that cream of tartar was acrid:  perhaps your cream of tartar was not fresh?

made these as x-mas cookies.  i was worried that the ratio of cinnamon to sugar was too high, but it was perfect.  even my very picky 11 year old daughter kept saying how much she liked them..

Great recipe! Used the advice of 8 minutes and I didn't have cream of tartar so I replaced it with the same ammount of baking powder. It worked fine. I only got 3 dozen out of the recipe though, so I need to make smaller cookies.

WONDERFUL recipe, excellent cookies, easy!  Only change I recommend is to bake at 375 degrees for 8 min instead of 400. degrees......400 makes the cookies a little burnt on the bottom.

I think I have actually mastered the Snickerdoodle now.  This recipe is perfect, and the other comments are correct: bake for exactly 8 minutes then remove from the pan.

The cookies came out great! They were a big hit with friends at Bible study. I used baking powder rather than cream of tartar and the cookies came out perfect. A friend suggested adding a little nutmeg to the outer coat of sugar and cinnamon... I will give it a whirl next time. 8 minutes only is good advice from other comments.

I made these this morning! Wonderful and easy recipe!  Crispy edges and soft, chewy centers!  I baked on parchment paper and let them sit on the baking sheet just a minute to let them set, them removed them to cool.  Great recipe!

I can't bake these fast enough at my house. We love them. Very chewy, although not really puffy. I don't mind because the flavor is really great.

Made a batch of these for a small get-together with about a dozen guys. Maybe I made the cookies too small, but they made 5 dozen, not 4. That being said, at the end of the day there were only 8 or so left.
I personally liked them, but thought they were a little acrid, as mentioned, so I'll swap the amounts of baking soda and cream of tartar next time.
Also, I used about 4 times the amount of recommended cinnamon sugar coating. Just my personal preference.

I'm quite a fan of "whole wheat snickerdoodles II" but this recipe is definitely the best white-wheat flour version! Mixing the dough is quite easy and foolproof. Within 30 minutes your first batch is out of the oven and mostly into your gullet! Yummy, crispy, with cinnamon lingering in your mouth!

I agree with everyone else - these are the most amazing snickerdoodle cookies EVER.

As someone else said, feel free to be liberal with the cinnamon and sugar topping - I think I used about 5 tbs. of cinnamon and 10 tbs. of sugar for all 4 dozen and they came out fabulously.

These cookies were great tasting!  I'm sure they are worthy of a five star rating, but I think I did something wrong.  I've never made snickerdoodles before, and when I made these cookies they tasted amazing but my batch came out as hard as a rock!  Like break your teeth hard.  They were tasty after dipping in milk. Does anyone know why that would happen?  I want to perfect snickerdoodles before Christmas =)

I have made these many times, and they are always perfect!  I like to double the cinnamon-sugar that you roll the dough; I also use Penzey's cinnamon and I think that really makes them the most flavorful! One of my family's favorites for sure!

400 degrees is way too high for these cookies, other than that, perfect. I burned the first batch at 375 and only 5 minutes-the bottoms were black, so be sure to turn the oven down to 350 F

This recipe worked out really well for me!  My three year old helped throw it all together, and I pretty much followed the recipe exactly.  I did get a bit lazy and decided to just add cinnamon to the cookie dough instead of rolling the dough in cinnamon sugar.  Baked for exactly 8 minutes, and they were so good!  They lasted less than 24 hours!

Perfect! People complained that they fell flat, but mine were perfect! I cooked them just 8 mins; they didn't look done yet, but they continue cooking after you take them out. I added an extra tbsp of sugar to the cin/sugar mixture and it was just the right amount to coat all the cookies. Crisp around the edges and soft in the middle. Yummy! Will make these again.

Oh my goodness! These are fantastic! I halved the recipe and used "I can't believe it's not butter" instead of real butter, and they came out great. It seems rare to not have to change anything in a recipe, but these proportions worked out perfectly for me. Crispy outsides, chewy insides. They definitely flattened out, but they maintained a good thickness. Wow!

These are the best I've ever tasted. As someone suggested, I substituted 4 teaspoons baking powder in place of the baking soda & cream of tartar. I also used butter flavor Crisco in place of the shortening. I baked them for 8 minutes exactly on a non stick insulated cookie sheet. They came out perfect.

Yummy! These are my personal favorite kind of cookie! I did not change anything about the proportions of the ingredients, except I doubled the sugar/cinnamon mixture and used butter flavored shortening. I actually more than doubled the size of the cookies (servings size of 18) and changed the baking time to 13 minutes and they were perfect! Thank you!

Mine didn't spread out at all and were thick, crunchy cookies. I didn't chill the dough so was surprised that they didn't spread more. Tasted fine (no bitter aftertaste from the cream of tartar) but I wanted flat, chewy cookies. Next time I will press down with a glass before baking. Also, they were great fresh out of the oven but within minutes, they had hardened. 

Update: Changing my review to five stars! Baked another batch and made sure to flatten the dough balls and took them out of the oven even though they still looked wet on top. This yielded the perfect, chewy, flat cookie I've wanted!

Great recipe.  When the cookies were right out of the oven and for a few hours later they were chewy in the center and delicious.  However the next day they had hardened quite a bit and were no longer chewy in the center which my husband and I missed.  Still though, the taste was great!

TERRIFIC!!!  I have never tasted a better snickerdoodle cookie in my life!  I should note that I didn't use real butter, but a vegetable stick butter.  I didn't notice any negative effect.  The consistency and taste were perfect!

This was a good recipe.  It reminded me of Paula Dean's cousin's recipe (she has a restaurant here in Atlanta).  I would like the cookies to be a bit more moist.  They turned rock hard the second day. I guess I should eat all of them the first day to keep this from happening. ;~)

I hadn't made snickerdoodles since 7th grade home ec. I don't remember how those turned out, but these were chewy and pretty good. I upped the cinnamon/sugar mixture to 3 t cinnamon and 3 T sugar and then I used the ziploc method to completely coat the dough. I cooked them for exactly 8 minutes. On some batches, I immediately removed from the pan to cool and some I didn't remove until the next batch came out. It didn't seem to make a difference.

My husband considers himself a Snickerdoodle Connoisseur and he said these were the best snickerdoodles he's ever had. I did use butter-flavered shortening.

These turned out wonderful!  I had a few sheets that got a bit over done though- so watch them closely!!!  They go from not done to over done very quickly!

I love this recipe and I've been using it for years! Of course I've adapted it to make it my own over the years as well...
I use 1 cup of butter instead of shortening. Sometime I mix it up and use salted butter sometimes for tinge of extra saltiness. I also mix in a few tablespoons of cinnamon into the dry ingredients, mostly because I love cinnamon. I also often use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.

Never had these cookies before but thought I would try them. They were crispy on the outside with a soft & light centre. The cinnamon taste was quite subtle. My husband just loved them but they aren't really my thing. I froze half the mixture in their ball shape so I can just take straight from the freezer to bake.

So good, so Easy. I baked mine for 7 minutes (always bake my cookies a minute under). I ended up using a little more cinnamon sugar mixture. Kids love to make the little balls and roll into the sugar!

I've made these cookies so many times from this recipe and they are a huge hit. The only change I made is using all butter instead of half shortening. I even made them with homemade butter once which was even better. And I agree with the reviewer who said 8 MINUTES ONLY! Has worked every time.

These were great. I tried 8 minutes exactly but they were still doughy. I use a baking stone, which may make a difference. My son and his friends loved them.

These cookies are wonderful! I made them for vacation Bible school and the chidlren adored them. I would recomend baking these for eight minutes and not a second longer or they will be too crisp.

I used all butter and baked the cookies for 8 minutes.  After cooling, they had crisp edges and soft centers.  My only complaint is that the recipe says to remove the cookies from the baking sheet immediately but they are way too soft and break easily when they are right out of the oven.  But other than that, this recipe produced delicious cookies that were the perfect texture AFTER cooling.

I was reminded of Snickerdoodles while shopping at one of the big box club stores today and thought, I could make those.  I haven't had them homemade since I was a kid, over 40 years ago.  And these are great.  
I used a #30 disher and flattened the cookies a bit -- so my yield was closer to 30.  Can't count them now, since so many are gone.

Great recipe! I substituted butter for the shortening (I didn't have any on hand) and they came out perfect. I left them in for 9 minutes and they came out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside - exactly how I wanted them to! My family just loves them - say they are a 'downright great recipe'. We are even adding this to our Christmas Cookie Lineup and we haven't added a new one in ten years! Thanks for sharing it!

These were so good.  I am not a huge cinnamon fan but I wanted something sweet and had everything for these on hand.  Very good.  And very easy to make.

**Edit** I just made them (for a second time) with all butter instead of 1/2 cup shorteneing and they came out good.  The texture was a little more cake like inside and they were a little puffier but still very good.

VERY impressed! I attemped to make sugar cookies with another recipe on this site and they never seemed to fully bake, so I was convinced that it was my baking skills. Thank you Beth for restoring my baking faith! I did not change a thing except that my kids prefer them without the cinnamon/sugar so I just used colored decorating sugar on half the batch and they came out great as well. To top it all off, my husband - who counts every calorie he eats, could not keep his hands off these...he even said that I should sell them! Thanks for the great recipe, I will be making again!

yummm!!! this is the my first ever cookie that didn't go flat or too crumbly!! woohoo!!!
4 stars coz min didn't look as good as what was in the picture.
and i baked it for abt 12 mins. maybe becoz my oven lacks heat. but it turned out crispy on the outside and crunchy on the inside!
use chilled ingredients...

I give these a 4, but the family gives them a 5!  I read many of the reviews but followed the recipe as stated.  My cookies didn't spread at all and looking at some of the photos they look flatter than mine.  I will make them again cause hubby likes the "plain-type" cookies.

Yum! I cut down to 1 cup of sugar, and the cookies were still plenty sweet. I'll see how much butter and shortening I can cut out without changing the texture, and I'll let y'all know...

Don't change anything on this recipe.  I have made these several times now and they usually don't last the day.  Best Snickerdoodle cookie I've ever made.  Chocolate Chip is my favorite cookie but this is definitely in my top 3 all-time favorites.

I have searched high and low for a reliable snickerdoodle recipe, but my search ends here!  These came out beautifully.  My oven tends to be a little on the fast-cooking side, so I had to lower the temp to 375 degrees F to bake for 8 minutes.  But other than that, I did everything as directed.  Perfect cookies!!

Not the best Snickerdoodle I've ever had but they were still pretty good. First batch I did the bag method of coating the cookies... I DO NOT recommend doing this. Most of the sugar went to the bottom of the bag so it was mostly cinnamon coating the cookies, which was not good.

I made these cookies lastnight and my stepson called me this morning to tell me that they were the best cookies he's ever tasted! What a great way to start the day! After seeing the amount of reviews, I didn't hesitate to make a double batch so I could share some with my co-workers. I'm so glad I did because everyone is enjoying them! I followed the reciped to a T and I would reccomend backing them for no more than 9 minutes to ensure the center stays nice and soft. I will definately make these again. Thanks so much for such a wonderful recipe!

Awesome recipe! Like other reviewers have stated, increase cinnamon to 3-4 teaspoons and white sugar to 3-4 tablespoons, and pour the two ingrediants into a sandwhich sized ziplock baggie. Drop the  ball of dough in and shake the baggie for the ball to get covered in cinnamon, and sugar. This method is mess-free.

Very good cookies. I did adjust the cooking time and oven temp.  I cooked them for 9 minutes at 350 then left them on the pan for 1 minute after taking them out of the oven.  They turned out perfectly - slightly crisp on the edges and chewy in the center.  I also used 3 Tablespoons sugar and 3 teaspoons cinnamon using the shake in bag method and I think 2 and 2 would have been plenty because I had a lot left over.

I LOVE this recipe!  I've gotten many rave reviews, and decided to put in my two cents.  I make BIG cookies, the recipe gives me 24, so I bake them on 400 for 9 minutes, and let them cool for 1 minute on the cookie sheet.  Fabulous!

The best thing about this recipe is that it is good as is - you do not need to make ANY modifications.  The reason they are so good is because of the shortening - I never used this recipe before because shortening is not an ingredient I usually keep in my pantry but I will now - it makes all the difference.  Use plenty of sugar/cinnamon for the coating.  Less time in the oven is better - they may look a little underdone but will firm as they cool.

I have never made snickerdoodles before and someone requested these so I read through bunches of recipes and decided to try this one. I read through all the reviews. I cut the cream of tartar down to 1 1/2 tsp, used 1/4 cup shortening, 3/4 cup butter and used 2 tsps cinnamon and 3 tbls sugar for the coating. I put the dough in refrig for about 40 min. and I used my cookie scooper to make the balls. I have a convection oven and baked them at 390 for 9 minutes.  I think they came out pretty good. The real test will be if the person requesting them likes them.

awesome!  I leave me in the oven for less time than the recipe calls for.  The cookies are then soft and gooey.

Yum Yum Yum.  A friend requested that I make these for her daughter's birthday party because her daughter doesn't like chocolate chip cookies or nuts.  I used pink sugar for dusting.  They look and taste awesome!
I agree that you can't bake them for any more than 8 minutes.  You do, and they'll be overdone.

So yummy and super easy.  To coat the cookies in the sugar&cinnamon I did use the sandwich bag method, as several people have recommened.  Perfect recipe -very kid friendly.  Look forward to making them again.

I don't know who Mrs. Sigg is, but she's a genius! These cookies were YUMMY! I had a ball making them with my son. The only problem is, I can't stop eating them bc they are THAT good. I did not have any shortening so I used all butter (oink) and had no problems. I also had to cook them longer than 8 mins but I might have made them too big. Again, oink! Not sure if I should love Mrs. Sigg, or hate Mrs. Sigg for this recipe, lol!

This is the first time I have written a review.  These were very good.  I have two daughters age 5 and 3.  They are always wanting to help me cook.  They did an excellent job rolling the dough in the cinnamon/sugar.  It was a little messy but worth it, they were so proud of themselves.  We are snowed in today and I did not have enough sugar so I found some organic sugar in the pantry and it worked great (even for the cinnamon/sugar mix).

Thankyou! Nothing beats a good snickerdoodle... but we add nutmeg to the dough and it brings it to a new level.  Tastes like a French puff.  
Try it on the last part of your cookie dough. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Exactly how Snickerdoodles should be! At Christmas time, I mix the cinnamon into the dough, then roll the dough balls in red and green decorator sugar. Very festive!

The reason why I made this recipe is because of the rave reviews and was very dissapointed. I like soft cookies, and these were hard and crunchy. Maybe the oven temp at 400 is a little too high? I even tried not cooking them as long, but it didn't make a difference. The taste of the cookie was good, however, the description stated they would be soft in the middle, which they most definitely were not! I'm eating them anyway; I just dunk them in my coffee to soften them!

I was really not impressed with this cookie. The cinnamon was to strong and overpowered the rest of the cookie.  I made some with just sugar coating and they were quite good so I may try cinnamon again just cut down some.

I made these cookies for a friend. She said that her whole family loved them, so I made them again for my family to test. They are delicious, probably the best snickerdoodles I've tasted, and snickerdoodles are my favorite kind of cookie, so I've tasted a lot of them.

Mmmm!! These are AMAZING!!! I will definitely make these again! I used the recommendation of 3tb sugar/3tsp cinnamon for the rolling mixture. I cooked my cookies at slightly less than 8mins (I think my cookies might have been a little smaller). I got 4 dozen out of the mix. Soooo Yummy.

Would say this recipe is almost perfect!  Soft inside and crisp outside, even after several days.  I saw the other reviews and adjusted the cream of tartar...try just 1 tsp.  And the cinnamon and sugar mix wasn't enough to coat the batch, increase it to 3T sugar and 3t cinnamon.  They're almost gone already!

I'm usually a chocolate chip cookie-kind of girl, but since I gave up chocolate for lent :( I decided to give these a try for Valentine's Day.  I can't really add anything that hasn't been said before, but these are fantastic.  Even the plain dough is irresistable.  And luckily the recipe makes a ton becuase they'll go fast!

I don't really have other snickerdoodle recipes to compare this to - I'd never tried them before until I baked them, but as general cookies go, these are superb. Cruchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and all together tasty!

This truly is an excellent recipe.  These are the best snickerdoodles I've ever had or made.

I think this recipe is wonderful, I just eyeball the cinnamon/sugar mix and I use less cinnamon in the ratio.  Roll the dough through lightly to coat. I've made them three times and I think next time I am going to decrease the cream of tartar as I get a little stomach achey from that tang I think.  I never get any complaints from anyone else though, everyone loves these.

YUM!  My kids are Chocolate Chip Cookie addicts.  We made this recipe during a recent rainy day and they LOVED them, absolutely couldn't get enough!  Sigg's Snickerdoodle Sunday is a new tradition!  I baked them on parchment paper for 9 minutes and they were perfect, crispy around the edges and chewy in the middle.  The shortening makes them fluff up nice, just right!  I also mixed the cinnamon/sugar in a baggie, but then dumped the mixture on a paper plate and let the kids roll the dough in the mixture, it was perfect.  I ended up using alot more than the 2 T of each, I just mixed it to taste!

These are great! I rolled them into about 1.5-2 inch balls, and dropped them in a baggie with the cinnamon sugar mixture.
I followed the recipe exactly except that I reduced oven temp to 390 and cooked exactly 8 minutes then removed immediately to wire rack. Result was a crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside cookie. So great.
I creamed the first ingredients (butter, shortening etc) with a mixer but then when I added the flour I mixed it by hand.
Got about 50 medium sized cookies out of this. Very easy and will make again in a hurry. Thanks

These were good but I found I had an after taste in my mouth after eating one. I don't know if it's because of the shortening. Next time I will try using butter instead. Will definetely try again.

These were excellent. I omitted the shortening, don't like to use it, and used butter instead. Only, my dough was way too sticky and I couldn't really roll it. Found out halfway through that if I put it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or so it became much easier to work with. Tastes really good, pretty darn close to the commercial version put out by Masterpiece. Thanks! Much cheaper! :)

Again, 8 minutes is the ideal time for awesome cookies.  As for the sugar/cinnamon mix, I just rolled out small balls and placed them into a small 1c plastic container (so I could put a lid on it after) and rolled it around.  My 6 yr old loved helping *roll them* and my 13yr old (autistic) could cover the cookie balls and then of course stick his finger in the sugar LOL!

Mine didn't flatten but they tasted good so we still ate them. Maybe my flour was too old, but they did not flatten very much at all, stayed in the ball shape pretty much the whole time. Still they were tasty and I will try them again with new flour.

Excellent and easy to make cookie! It made about 4 dozen cookies too! The only change I made to this incredible recipe was that I used a cup of butter and omitted the shortening. They were done in 9 minutes and they smelled so good baking. A definite keeper!

I made mini cookies, when cooked they were about the size of a 50 cent piece. My kids rolled them in the cinnamon/sugar mixture and placed them on the cookie sheets. I needed to shorten the cooking time so they didn't get to hard. I had to make a double batch just to have some to bring into work because the kids ate them as soon as they were cool enough.

  To make them soft again after fully cooling I put some in the microwave for about 15 seconds or so and they are just like when they came out of the oven.

I made a double batch and WOW! These are great little cookies! A+! I agree 8 minutes then OUT! They might not look "done" but once they cool off they get a nice little bite to them.

Easy to make and delicious.  I've made them numerous times.  I do refrigerate the dough prior to making it into balls; it's just easier for me to work with, and I've found that it helps me make sure the cookies are soft just like I like them.

I tried to cut down the recipe and it came out a mess.  The neighborhood kids ate them anyway and loved them, but they were flat and about 3 inches in diameter.  I guess my advice is do not try to cut the recipe!  I made 8 dozen after the bad batch and they came out perfectly!

As suggested by another user, I cut the cream of tarter in half, and I'm sure glad I did. I can still taste a bit of it and if I added the full amount I can see these cookies sitting in the cookie jar until they go stale! Besides that I followed word for word and they were delicious!

These were wonderful cookies. I have made them about 4 times in the last week. The first time I made them I used half butter and half shortening.  The second, third, and fourth time I made them I used all butter, and they turned out the same. The only difference was with all butter I had to add some extra flour to get them to roll into balls.

These cookies are incredible.  I was left with 3 cookies in a short period of time.  My boyfriend said these are the best snickerdoodles that he has eaten.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.  I will be making more of these real soon.

Such a simple little cookie, but very addictive.  On a platter full of a variety of christmas cookies, I kept going back for more of these little gems.  YUM!

Good cookie.  Not exactly what I like in a snickerdoodle cookie but the family liked it.  The first batch was a bit crunchy and so the next batch I added an egg because that is what you do to cookies in high altitude and it normally fixes it - not this time.  I will make again and keep trying.

There seems to be no way to just ask a question w/o giving a rating. I've not yet made the cookies so just to get my question 
asked, I've chosen 3*. If you substitute vinegar or lemon juice for the cream of tartar, do you still   use 1t of baking soda?
many thanks.

Snickerdoodles are my favorite cookie, and this is now my favorite recipe for them!  I followed other reviewers' advice - cut cream of tartar in half, doubled cinnamon sugar for rolling and baked for EXACTLY 8 minutes.  They were chewy, delicious perfection.  My niece at first refused to try them, because "Aunt Lori's snickerdoodles are the best".  After one bite, Aunt Lori moved to second place!

For me, it was just ok. I guess its all about the taste YOU like. There was a little too much vanilla to me. Also I like puffy snickerdoodles and these were flat. I usually dont add the cream of tartar this recipe calls for, so maybe thats the difference? To its credit, the WERE crispy on the outside and soft in the middle!!! But, I think Ill keep looking for a better one.....I lost the recipe I normally use :(

This is the best snickerdoodle.  I always get request for recipes and to make this one again.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Yum.  Great for freezer too - just let it sit out and thaw at room temperture for about an hour when you want to eat it.  Will never use another recipe for Snickerdoodles again.

The best snickerdoodles ever. I tripled the batch since I had to take cookies to several places this week. Everyone loved them. I did make extra cinnamon sugar mixture as suggested and glad I did. This one will go in my holiday book so I can make this a new tradition for my family. They were so easy and fun to make.

Very easy recipe with excellent results.  Do follow previous suggestions to freeze the dough balls, you'll have better cookies in the end.  I had to bake a little longer than 8 minutes though.

This is a very good recipe and produces a pretty little cookie. I have never made these before, I have never liked the taste and still don't, but I give it 5 because my children LOVED them. Both of my teenagers wanted to take a batch to school to share so I know they were fantastic! I did reduce the heat to 350 after the first batch came out too brown on the bottom, but other than that I followed exactly as written. Will make again for the kids and friends.

I found this recipe to be very easy to follow, and the dough was ready to use immediately! I used a cookie dropper instead of rolling these into a ball. I also used the zipper bag suggestion - shaking the cookies in the bag with sugar and cinnamon. My only recommendation would be to flatten the cookies out a little before baking if you use a dropper - a few of mine were a little too puffy! Still turned out terrific, and taste just how I expected!

Made these last night. Baked them at 375 degrees as suggested. I like chewy, my husband likes crunchy, so to compromise I let half the batch bake a couple minutes longer than ther other. (I never go by recipe times because my oven is weird. I just have to "babysit".) These cookies are mainly for our church cookie social and to give as gifts, but the baker and spouse always have to "test" them. And the one I tried was chewy goodness, but just a little flaky around the edges. Not my favorite TYPE of cookie (I'm more of a chocolate or molasses fan), but I would definitely make these again. Husband said they are good for "dipping". :)

This makes a really yummy cookie. For the holidays (neighbor & friend gifts) we dipped 1/2 the cookie in chocolate (some white and others dark).  They were beautiful and made a great gift.

First time snickerdoodle attempt and these came out great.  Reading others' reveiws is always helpful and recommended when trying a recipe for the first time.  I reduced the temp to 390 and baked 8 minutes exactly.  I slightly flattened out the balls, after rolling in sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon mix then sprinkled colored sugar (green & red) on top since this was for a Christmas cookie exchange.  My daughter and husband said they were fantastic.  One thing, if you want a certain amount, then increase the recipe amount.  Didn't seem to be enough dough, or else I just like my cookies larger!  Yummy!

I love snickerdoodles, and these were great.  However, the last few batches turned out a little too crispy.  I should have turned down the oven or shortened the cooking time.  I baked at 400 degrees for 8 min.

I wasn't sure what a snickerdoodle cookie tasted like before I made them, but now I realize it's just a butter cookie with cinnamon/sugar sprinkled on top.  The cookies came out perfect and the dough was very easy to work with.  I will make again.  Thank you.

These are simply the best! Just like my great grandma made. I baked for exactly 7 minutes and they turned out so soft and yummy, with that nice crisp outer layer. Also, I handmixed instead of using the kitchen-aide.. a must!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, and used others' suggestions to cook for 8 minutes. Mine came out underdone- and my oven is always too hot! Maybe its because I used all butter. Other than that, these were great little cookies. My husband doesn't really eat sweets, and he says these are his favorite now! He calls them French Toast cookies, because he says that's what mine ended up tasting like! I will make these again and cook for probably 9 minutes.

Yum! This was my first Snickerdoodle ever and will definitely be a keeper around here, everyone loved them.  I followed the standard suggestions, 8 min/ 3T white sugar /and then used 2 tsp. white vinegar b/c I didn't have lemon juice OR Cream of Tartar.

PERFECT!!!

These aren't the prettiest cookies, but they are certainly yummy.  I made it twice.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time. People liked it but wished there wasn't the cream of tartar aftertaste.  The second time, I replaced the cream of tartar with 2 teaspoon of fresh lemon juice, and the cookie turned out great with no funny after taste.  The lemon juice does not affect the texture of the cookie at all.  Aside from the lemon juice tip, the other things I found helpful are: 1. chill dough, 2. place cookies far apart (they spread), and 3) bake for exactly 8 minutes.

These are AWESOME! Def. a keeper! I added a few dashes of ground cloves to the cinn/sugar mix, to bring out the cinn taste, and I added a few dashes of allspice to the mix, but i will prob add some cinn next time i make, and I WILL make again!, and before I rolled in the c/s mix, i placed in freezer for about 5 min. then rolled them. My husband and son snarffed them up!! I will recommoned this to ANYONE!!

OUTSTANDING!!  I won 2nd prize in a cookie contest at work with these.  The only thing I changed a bit was add more cinnamon as I went along.  I used a teaspooful and baked ONLY 8 minutes.  I was standing at the oven door with my ovenmit ready to take them out.  Also, I used a silpat and just slid that off the hot pan and let them cool 1 min...they were chewy in the middle and crispy on the outside.  PERFECT!

Made these cookies for christmas.  Snickerdoodles have always been one of my husbands favorite, but  everytime I tried to make them, they turned out hard and crunchy.  After he took a bite of these he commented on how perfect they were.  I followed the directions exactly, except for chilling the dough, and I only had 1 tsp of cream of tarter.
Will definately make again.

Very easy & kid-friendly recipe. We usually double or triple the recipe & find they are best when the dough is thoroughly chilled before rolling into balls & again chilled before baking.  We like them a little more chewy, than crisp.

I first made this recipe in 2003 and I have been baking these cookies ever since. This is the ONLY snickerdoodle recipe I use.  Like others, I use a hand mixer to cream the butter and I only let mine bake about 8 minutes.  My daughter has a cookie exchange at school Monday and these are the cookies she asked to bake.  Thanks Beth for a great recipe!

I had to make 10 dozen cookies for a church function.  I'd spent hours making a complicated cookie recipe.  Then I decided to switch and try something different.  I found this recipe and it was SO easy!!  Every cookie turned out perfect and utterly melt-in-your mouth delicious!  I'm thrilled I found it and I will definately be making these again and again!

Loved this recipe, even more with the following changes: used 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. almond extract; deleted the cream of tartar; and added 1/2 tsp. baking powder and 2/3 c. shredded coconut.  They are definitely hard to resist!

This is my new "go to" Snickerdoodle recipe.  Very very good.  Only small change I did was use butter flavored Crisco because that's what I had.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect!  Added note:  I just made these yesterday (for the millionth time!) and I was out of shortening so I just used an extra stick of margarine.  Couldn't tell any difference at all.  They were still awesome!

I really liked these cookies; they taste good, look good and are nice and were uniform. I found that 8 min of cooking time was not enough; it left a raw line of dough through the centre. I left them in for about 91/2 mine. My cookies came out puffy and not "crackley" though - not sure why.

I had a snickerdoodle recipe given to me by a coworker years ago. It was the best in my opinion. I looked high and low for it today and couldn't find it. I thought I'd give this one a try with all the wonderful reviews.  This is now my snickerdoodle recipe! Wonderful, wonderful cookie. Made them exactly as the recipe says but I did refrigerate it a while before baking. Crunchy edges and soft chewy centers.  Absolutely wonderful taste!

I love snickerdoodles, and this recipe has taken it to a whole new level. I made it as written, using butter flavored shortening instead of plain shortening. It was delicious - crispy outside, soft inside. PERFECT!

I had never heard of a snickerdoodle before but with all of the rave reviews I had to try this. Delicious! I didn't have any cream of tartar so I subbed vinegar (same amount). I also only had about half of the amount of all-purpose flour, so I used cake flour for the remainder. I cooked them for exactly 8 minutes and they turned out perfect. I also chilled the dough before rolling into balls to make it less messy.

These were ok but nothing special. I baked for 8 minutes exactly and the bottoms were still too done.

Not necessarily a fast Snickerdoodle recipe - but always wonderful.  These are worth the effort and always get a wonderful review when I take them into the office.  I follow the recipe to a "T" and never get complaints.

This is going to be my favorite recipe for snickerdoodles!  I would recommend baking only 8 minutes, no more.  I made these exactly as the recipe states and my cookies turned out to be fluffier than the ones pictured~ even though, they taste WONDERFUL!

These are really good when they first come out of the oven, and they are pretty good after, but only so long as you make them with shortening. If you only use butter, they harden really quickly.

My husband and I are a family of two, with fairly small appetites, but nonetheless these were gone in two days. I used Vietnamese cinnamon, which has a stronger cinnamon flavor, and whipped the butter sugar and eggs in my mixer until it was fluffy, and the texture was even. The resulting cookie was light and airy. 7 1/2 minutes cooking time is perfect.

I've made these several times. My family members have also started making them. I use a cookie scoop to make the perfect sized balls, then shake them in a ziplock bag of cinnamon-sugar.

To be honest, I wasn't that impressed with this recipe. I had to add more sugar to the cinnamon-sugar coating. I did the first batch as called for by the recipe. Didn't taste right without the extra sugar. I also had to cut the cooking time, so the bottoms didn't burn. The middle did rise a little & had sort of a cake like consistency. That was an added bonus. Ohter than that not too exciting.

YUM! The best recipe I have found for Snickerdoodles. I used all butter and they came out a little flat, but so what. There is a lot of discussion over the "perfect" baking time, but that has to do with your oven. Just make sure they are completely baked or you may get a weird aftertaste from the cream of tartar.  Thanks for a new favorite!

This was indeed a tasty cookie.  I made up the batch in no time and they came out perfectly.  I did add about 1/4 tsp (give or take) of nutmeg to the cinnamon and sugar.  Also, I didn't have shortening so I used a mixture of butter and vegetable oil.  The latter modification didn't appear to change the outcome of the cookie at all.  The recipe says it should yield about 48 cookies, but I only came up with 30 or so (I prefer a larger cookie).  Great recipe.

Everyone liked these.  My 2 year old climbed the counter to get to the cookie jar.  My first batch burnt on the bottom at 400 degrees so I cooked the second batch at 7 -7.5 minutes & they were perfect.  Thanks for sharing.

These were very good.  The yeild was very accurate.  I added a tsp of rum extract.  They came out crunchy rather than chewy even with different bake times.  It might just be my oven though!  They'll be great tea.

I've always had a bad impression of snickerdoodles because the only ones I had tasted before were the Pepperidge Farm store-bought brand and I didn't like them at all. This recipe DEFINITELY changed my mind! YUMMY! The only problem I had was that rolling the dough balls completely in sugar caused the bottoms to burn slightly, but they're still awesome!

These cookies have a very good flavor and texture.  The kids really liked them.  I used butter flavor shortening instead of plain.  The only problem I had with this recipe is that the dough was way too wet to shape into balls.  I had to add an extra 1/2 cup of flour to cut down the stickiness and put it in the refrigerator for an hour. Even then, it wasn't as firm as it should be for shaping.  I used a scoop and spoon and just kind of rolled the lumps around in the sugar/cinn. mixture that way.  Overall these are tasty cookies!

These are my all time favorite cookies to make. Never had a bad batch. They're chewy on the inside, crispy on the ouside. Just perfect!

These cookies are delicious! I took the other reviewers' advice and used 3T sugar and 3tsp cinnamon to coat the dough with. I also cooked for exactly 8 mins. Turned out great!!

I really liked these, although I have to say that cinnamon is "my thing".  The rest of my family thought that these were "ok".  They said three, I said five, so ****.

The best snickerdoodles I've ever had. My boyfriend couldn't stop eating them. To keep the dough from being sticky or too soft stick it in the fridge for 10 min and it will be perfect for rolling. Thank You Mrs. Sigg!

Delightful cookies! Turned out just like the photo. Excellent consistancy. Baked for 10 minutes as directed. Don't you love it when a cookie recipe says "makes 48" and that is exactly what it made. Thanks so much.

I'm a believer.  This is far and away the best cookie I have ever made.  Each batch turned out perfectly.  10 minutes in the oven and 2 on the cookie sheet before removing to the wire racks.  Awesome.  This will be the cookie I make from now on to take to functions.  Brought them to work today and people keep coming up and asking for the recipe!  Wow.  Perfect everytime!  Crunchy outside and soft inside.  Perfecto!

This is exactly the way my mother made them, and they are perfect! I took them to work and there wasn't one left! I have made it exactly as the recipe called but also went and followed someone's advice and used butter. Both turned out perfect.

I've been making this same recipe since I was a child!  Cookies have a great taste, and always look nice.  Take them out of the oven while still puffy (I bake for 10 minutes for oven), and allow them to sit on the pan for a few minutes after baking.  Cookies will flatten a bit, but still look nice and stay very chewy after cooling.  I halved the amount of cinnamon simply because I don't like the darker color that the full amount gives the cookies.  I used parchment paper on my pan and had no problems with the bottoms browing too much.  If you're looking for a tasty, chewy, bakery-like Snickerdoodle recipe, feel confident in using this one!  One batch made 26 medium-sized cookies.

My seven year old son and I made these snickerdoodles together.  We loved them.  He had fun rolling the dough in a ball and cover in the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  He even tucked some extra cinnamon in the center for fun.  We decided we would make these again but try some apple in the center.  We will let you know how it turns out.  Thanks for the recipe.  The cookies were so good they disappeared quick.

I only had 1/3 cup of shortening on hand, so I used butter to compensate for the difference. I also used 3 tbsp and 3 tsp of sugar/cinnamon respectively, but should have stuck with the amounts stated in the recipe--I had a lot left over. I followed others' advice and baked 8 min, removing to cooling rack right out of the oven. All in all, this is a very tasty cookie with a great texture.

Theese cookies are so good.  I followed the exact recipe and I took them out of the oven at 8 minutes and they were perfect.  Because they are so soft they do very well frozen.  I keep mine in the freezer in a freezer bag and they dont become rock hard at all. I think they actually taste even better that way.

I used lemon juice instead of Cream of Tarter (because I didn't have any) and they were great! I also baked at375 for 8 minutes and it wasperfect. After a day or two I felt like they developed a wierd after-taste, but that may have been my imagination. Fresh out of the oven theywere so good!!

A great cookie, but use the butter and butter flavor shorting, it doesn't taste as good if  you use all of just one kind.

Snickerdoodles are my favorite! I baked them for less time than stated because I like them more chewy. Very good!

Tasted just like the snickerdoodles I had when I was in primary school.  They were so light and fluffy and just scrumptious!!  I did not change a thing!!  I made a bunch and put in a tin for my aunt's birthday, but the kids and I just couldn't help it; we did save her one, though :o))

I have never made snickerdoodles before, and am so glad that I do not need to search further for a great recipe!  The cookies came out great! I followed the recipe, except I refrigerated my dough for an hour prior to baking.  I baked each batch for 12 minutes, and they came out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside - perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!!

These were SO GOOD!! Snickerdoodles are my favorite and this really satisfied my craving!! They were pretty easy, but I followed the other reviews and sprayed my hands with pam so that the dough would not stick to them, and I took them out after 8 minutes and then let them sit on the cookie trays for another minute and they turned out perfect

Very, very good!  My husband who thought he didn't like snickerdoodles ate about 10 when he took these to work, the rest were ate up in about 30 minutes.  
I did alter the recipe slightly being that I don't carry shortening any longer.  Did 1 c. butter and added 1 egg.  Also followed the advice to take out at 8 minutes even though they appear underdone, this made a very moist cookie.  Delicious!

These snickerdoodles turned out very thin and flat I think because of the shortening. I have better recipes for these so I doubt I would make again.

These are good.  Not as chewy as I had hoped, but they do have a good and simple flavor to them.  I wish I had smashed the cookies down a little.  They came out too puffy as rounded tablespoonsful.

First off... I am not a cook and was tired of prepackaged cookies.  I used this recipe because of all the great reviews.  These cookies were absolutely amazing.  It have been two weeks since I made them and they are still most.  I will never go back to store bought cookies again. It was so easy.  This recipe works for me.

I've been using allrecipes.com for years and have never felt compelled to rate a recipe before. I had to join as a member just to rate this recipe.  These cookies are THE BEST. Not too sweet, crisp on the  edges but soft and chewy on the inside.  My family loved them.  Don't need to change a thing!

I've made these cookies a few times, and they always come out great!  I bake them for eight minutes.  Right out of the oven, the cookies look underbaked.  But once they cool, they are perfect - crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

Made these for my Dad's birthday. His favorite cookie made by his mom growing up. I don't have my grandmother's recipe. He loved them. The closest he has had to his Mom's. Thanks!! (I did add more cinnamon and suger as suggested.)

I have been looking for a snickerdoodle recipe ever since Mrs. Fields discontinued their giant snickerdoodle. It was the only cookie I wanted from there and I was so disappointed when they stopped making it. 

This one was EXACTLY what I was looking for! I read through some of the reviews and made some changes. I cooked them at 375 for 10 minutes, I cut out the cinnamon because I wanted just a plain sugar cookie. I used all butter because I didn't have shortening and I used lemon juice instead of cream of tartar. 

I wasn't expecting them to be exactly what I was looking for so I didn't get my hopes up but when they came out of the oven and I tasted one, I was thrilled. They were perfect! They tasted exactly as I remembered snickerdoodles - very vanilla-ey. I'm so glad I found this recipe! I haven't had a snickerdoodle for about 4-5 years now and I missed them. Now I can make them myself instead of paying 3 bucks a cookie at a place like Mrs. Fields. Thanks!

We loved this recipe.  The strong cinnamon flavor is great.  I think though if I make it for a large gathering we will use 2T sugar to 1t cinnamon as not all people love a super strong cinnamon flavor. Texture is great. My oven is wacky so it was closer to 10minutes for me on the cooking time.

Always loved snickerdoodles and this reminded me of my childhood. I'd cut back on the sugar the next time and try to bake it at 8 minutes flat for a chewier center since mine were a bit crispier than I'd like. Super taste; will keep forever! Thanks!

These are the best snickerdoodles I've ever eaten.  I used butter flavor Crisco (in convenient cubes) for best results.

This is a very good, basic recipe for snickerdoodles.  They turn out just how you would expect them too.  Yummy.  Next time I'm going to try refrigerating the dough for an hour or so before rolling into balls.  Mine cooked a bit flatter than I would like and it would probably help them keep their shape better.  Very good.  Take them out after 8 minutes if you want them chewy.

I am such a fiendish gal for snickerdoodles. Quite possibly my favorite cookie besides peanut butter and double chocolate. These were soft and chewy and cinnamon-perfect. I'm a huge fan of soft cookies, so I tended to keep mine on the border of undercooked. I made two batches, one that kept to the recommended cooking time for my friends and then a smaller batch for me, where it was still very soft in the center. The edges were just beginning to brown when I whisked them out. Outstanding cookies; I think I'll try the other Mrs. Sigg recipes.

These did not come out chewy for some reason.  Disappointing...will keep looking.  The reviews looked promising, but I like my snickerdoodles chewy.

Great cookies. Just to add a twist of healthiness in these I put about 40g of bran. Turned out very fine and were finished in a blink of an eye.

These are good, but never having a snickerdoodle before, I didn't know what to expect.  I used a 1 Tbs. Pampered Chef scoop and cooked them for 9 minutes.  I think that was too long, and next time will bake them for only 8 minutes.  The did come out looking undercooked, but firmed up to crunchy....I'd prefer them chewier in the middle.

These really are amazing. I perfer chewy so these save everyones' preferences just wonderfully! I had to make the cookie balls a wee bit smaller than normal so I ended up with WAYYYYY more cookies than the recipe states but, that's ok - being a friday with 16 hungry preschoolers, I am certain they will not mind in the least!

Wow these are good!  I've never had a snickerdoodle before but there were so many good reviews I decided to try it.  The taste reminds me of those little cinnamon and sugar donuts that you buy at the fair! I tried my first batch at 375 and it was a little underdone, however I was using a Pampered Chef baking stone and I should know better, things don't burn on those unless you really screw up!  The rest were baked at 400 for exactly 8 min and they were perfect.  It is true that the baggie trick works but it does put too much cinnamon on it, rolling would be better.  They will look undercooked but harden as they cool.  The BEST cookie recipe I've tried on here to date, thanks Mrs. Sigg!

I never liked this type of cookie until now. Perfect EXCEPT that I do recommend doubling the cinnamon/sugar you roll the cookie in. As other reviewers said be sure to only bake 8 minutes.

I love these cookies! I substituted lemon juice for the tartar, as others suggested. I also used Splenda baking mix instead of sugar (diabetes runs in my family). There weren't any cookies left to cool! So, I don't know how well they keep.

This recipe is by far the best snickerdoodle recipe I have ever had. I made 5 dozen and they were gone within about 3 hours. Since then I have been asked to make 12 dozen for various Holiday Parties. This ismy new favorite recipe for cookies!!

These are the best cookies and everyone looks forward to me making them for the holidays.  I'll never attempt any other snickerdoodle recipe.  You can't go wrong with this one.

I kept seeing that this was on the top 10 cookie list so I made them.  Turned out perfectly.  Just realized it was the same recipe my grandma gave me that I make every year (they also turn out perfectly - go figure).  A+ from me.  Very soft and flavorful.

I'm not a snickerdoodle aficionado, but these cookies were a bit too cakey for my taste.  I prefer a flatter, chewier cookie.

These cookies are delicious!  I made them for a Christmas party and everyone took home the leftovers.  I cooked the cookies for exactly 8 minutes, thanks to others' comments, and they came out perfectly.  Take them out, even if they don't look done.  You will be so glad that you did when you taste them!

This recipe was very good. I was baking this for cookie exchange but I will definitely make it again. The reason I gave 4stars was because the dough was little sour. My kids like to eat dough more than baked cookies so it is very important for me to have good tasty dough.

I sprinkled additional cinnamon and sugar on to the balls of cookie dough right before baking and onto the hot cookies right after baking.  Also slightly underbaked.  Fab, but am giving 4 stars 'cause I like softer cookies.

These are absolutely the best cookies I have ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great!!  I always have to atleast double the recipe because they are especially good right out of the oven, they disappear quicker than I can make them!!  Thanks for a fabulous recipe that I will be using for the rest of my life!!

What a yummy recipe. Crispy on outside and chewy on the inside.  I liket the fact that this recipe calls for 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. Makes for a more flavorful cookie. My family loves these.  I will definately make more soon!

These cookies are very yummy.  My only complaint would be that they got hard pretty fast, but even at that they still melt in your mouth and of course they soak well in milk too...This became my sons school snack until they were gone, he would take 5 each day for his snack, he loves them and so does the rest of my family...Thanks for the recipe!!

I have made these cookies on a regular basis for a while now and i LOVE them. 
I cut the cream of tartar to 1.5 teaspoons as i am not a huge fan of the flavor and i use  butter instead of shortening. Try these- they are wonderful!!!!

My boyfriend and I love these cookies.  But if we don't eat them right away, they don't stay soft past the second day.  We end up nuking them for a few seconds in the microwave to soften them up and they're great again!  I made no changes to the recipe and baked for 8 min.  LOVE them warm but wish they stayed softer longer.  We'll make these again and try some variations.

Perfection!  I'm throwing out all my other snickerdoodle recipes!  These aren't as dry like the other recipes can be.  Just make sure you take them out at excatly the 8 minute mark with no carry over cooking-straight to the cookie rack!!!  :)  A fun recipe to make with your kids too!

Excellent cookie recipe.  My husband loved them!  The only thing I changed was to use 1 cup of butter and no shortening.  I will definitely make these again.

These were scruptious!  I only had a 1/2 stick of butter so I halved the recipe.  I now wish I could have made the entire batch!  Definately take them out at the 8 min mark.  I made mine a little on the small side so 8 min may have been slightly too long (my fualt).  Regardless, they are still excellent.  I know I'll be making these again.

Once again, Mrs. Sigg comes through with a fantastic cookie recipe! These snickerdoodles are wonderful. I didn't have regular shortening, so I had to use butter flavored, and it turned out scrumptious!  This one's a keeper. Thanks a bunch, Mrs. Sigg!  :)

This is THE perfect snickerdoodle recipe.  Snickerdoodles were the first cookie that I ever made (back in home ec in middle school 30+ years ago) and THESE are the best I've ever made or have ever tried!  Not sure how they came out so airy and light, maybe it's the cream of tarter???? 

Note: I did sift all of the dry ingredients and mixed everything with an electric hand mixer....that may have added to how good they turned out too :)

Nice cookie recipe. The cookies tasted great and remained soft and chewy. The recipe was very easy to follow, the cookies were done in no time. Baked each pan 8 minutes.

We don't eat many cookies in my house so I halved the recipe. They didn't really flatten out much but tasted good. The second batch I made was still half the recipe so I used a fork to imprint the tops and push them down before baking. They still tasted great of course, and looked more like a snickerdoodle that time.

Quite possibly one of the best cookie recipes ever!  For the folks who have been disappointed with the cookies, be sure not to overbake - pull them out of the oven at 8 to 9 minutes tops.  I use a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet and they come out to perfection every time.  I make mine smallish and can get 6 dozen out of this recipe easy.  They are simply DIVINE!  Definitely use the 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter combination.  I also roll about 3/4 of the balls in the cinnamon sugar to ensure you get a nice, even coating when they are finished.  Everyone will think you are a baking genius as beautiful as these babies come out!  THANK YOU, Mrs. Siggs!  :oD

These are the best snickerdoodles I've made. Personally, I like my snickerdoodles to be crunchy and not cakey and soft, and these flattened out and crisped up for me beautifully!

In one word...Amazing!

FANTASTIC recipe! The cookies were a bit soft, but not too soft. They were perfect. My family loved the cookies. I recommend these snickerdoodles to everyone.

Being from Australia, I have never heard of these biscuits (cookies). I have to tell you, they are the yummiest bikkies ever.  My kids were eating them before they even hit the plate.  They will become a family favourite for sure! Thanks Mrs Siggs.

My grandchildren absolutely love these cookies!  They call them "doodle snaps" because they can't remember snickerdoodle.  When I correct them, they laugh so hard and think the name is so funny! I remember my Grandma making these for me!  Delicious!

Fantastic recipe!  My daughter makes these cookies and everyone loves them.  At church bake sales these are the first to go.  She uses extra cinnamon (1 T) and really adds to the flavor.

I used this recipe for the very first time to bake my own batch of Snickerdoodles...which I had never made before...and it was fantastic!!!  My kids beg me to make Snickerdoodles now!!!
The only thing I changed was intead of using 1/2 cup of shortening and 1/2 cup of butter...I used 1 cup of unsalted sweet cream butter!!!  Truly one of my favoite cookies to bake...very simple and taste heavenly!!!

Oh God, these are so incredibly delicious! I divided the recipe by 2, and made 12 cookies out of the batter. I baked them 11 minutes. They were amazing. Thank you for this wonderful recipe! (I only used butter, and kosher salt)

I used all butter because I didn't have any shortening, and it was fine.  Also, I needed more of the cinnamon-sugar topping than this made, but I just kept adding white sugar, as the cinnamon tends to sift to the bottom anyway.  Very yummy cookies!

I followed directions exactly. Cookies came out perfect, but a little too crispy for me - I like mine just a little more chewy. Flavor was excellent and these were really easy to make. Thanks for sharing!!

Very good cookie! Reminds me of my Mom's snickerdoodles. I used a convection oven and baked at 400 degrees for exactly 8 minutes. Came out perfect! Chewy on inside, slightly crisp on edges.  The dough was very easy to work with and I was able to mix the batter within just a few minutes. I mixed the wet ingredients with a hand mixer and then incorporated the dry ingredients by hand, careful not to overmix. The dough was soft, but not sticky and formed balls very easily. My kids and their friends LOVED them. Will definately make these again.

Very easy and delicious recipe. I thought that snickerdoodles would be harder, but it wasnt! Although my cookies puff up, because i didnt wait for it to go to room temperature. The only change next time is cutting back on the butter and shortening. There was a semi over powering taste of it, and a bit oily.

This recipe (almost all snickerdoodle recipes are just about identical) was really no different - in ingredients or taste.  The ONLY way I improved upon it and got rave reviews was to use MAKAR cinnamon from Cinnabon company.  There was a noticeable difference in taste - plus I used EQUAL amnts of cinnamon and sugar to coat the cookies.  Delicious!!

These were fantastic cookies! I used butter flavor shortening and real butter, a little extra vanilla, and rolled them in turbinado sugar mixed with cinnamon. They turned out very pretty, perfectly chewy and moist with crisp edges. I think I ate as much of the dough as I did the cookies after they were baked!

Since I had never had such a cookie I had no real expectaions.  So when I tried them I was very surprised at how good they were.  My husband loved them and so did his and my co-workers. I still have people asking for the receipe
Thanks for a great cookie.

This is a wonderful recipe!  Cooking time really depends on your preference, oven time, and size cookie.  Mine took about 10 minutes with a medium cookie scoop.  These are soft, flavorful and perfect.  I used all margarine and added 1/3 cup flour for high altitude.  Give these a try!

I made the error of mixing 2 tablespoons of cinnamon with the 2 tablespoons of sugar for rolling instead of 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  Aside from using up most of my cinnamon, it came out really nice.  This recipe, aside from the cooking time (has to be 8 minutes--check your oven temp), seems fairly idiot-proof.

These were EXCELLENT!  As per other reviewers suggestions, I substituted 2 tsp of lemon juice for the cream of tartar.  
I had never really liked snickerdoodles before.  Guess what, I do now.  I think the lemon juice made the difference!
Thanks to the other reviewers who suggested it!  Well, my mouth thanks you, my waistline does not!  LOL

Make sure you have enough ingred. on hand to double the recipe because you are going to need to make a double batch of these!  I don't know how others got away with storing these for a week, because mine barely lasted the afternoon and I had to make more.  As far as baking them, I got 36 cookies exactly.  Mine baked for exactly 8 minutes, then I moved them to waxed paper on the counter.  Did not think a cooling rack would have worked with these.  I figured they'd fall through the cracks in the rack.  Worked very well.  Very nice shaped cookies.

Had a little bit of trouble with the dough at first it was a bit soft for rolling must have been something I did. Anyway I floured my hands lightly and that helped. I put the cinnamon and sugar in a plastic bag and shook the cookies in there. We all liked these. Thanks so much.

My favorite thing about this recipe is that I always have all the ingredients right in my pantry.  They come out chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside.  Very easy to prepare!  These cookies are a nice change from the every-day chocolate chip cookies.  They're always a big hit!

This is the same recipe in the Betty Crocker cook book that my mom was given when she got married back in 72.  My mom is one of the worst cooks ever and she made these all the time with great success!  It was our favorite cookie growing up and now it is my kids' favorite.

Excellent recipe! The cookies are crispy on the outside & chewy on the inside. I used butter flavored Crisco and real butter. I baked them for only 8 mins. on parchment. I left them on the baking sheet for a couple of minutes and then transferred them onto a wire cooling rack. I agree with a previous reviewer that cinnamon/sugar mixture should be increased to 3T white sugar, and 3tsp. cinnamon. I took the advice of another reviewer and placed the mixture in a sandwich baggie and dropped one ball in at a time to coat.

WOW!! Great recipe..just the right amount of sweetness to go with a glass of fresh milk! Soooo easy to make, though i did make a mistake by adding a bit too much of margarine ( because i ran out of shortening halfway thru the recipe) and the cookies spread like crazy! My cookies ended up looking like pancakes instead! LOL Though, the taste; AWESOME! Will make these again! ;-) Thanks for the recipe,Beth!

Make sure that you don't overcook them. For high altitude (Denver), I just added 1/4 cup more flour. Worked just fine. The first batch I cooked too long and they were hard by the evening. The second batch I made sure to undercook, and they were perfect. Put in a tupperware and seal, and they stay soft for about a week.

Great cookies! I loved them and so did my husband,you can actually sub light butter in for real butter and the splenda sugar blends for baking for the reccommended amount of sugar. I don't think you need that much sugar though!

I have to add my praises to all of the rest. These cookies took me straight back to childhood. I hadn't tasted one since I was barely tall enough to reach the cookie jar, but I never forgot that distinctive taste. These were indeed perfect. Parchment paper on the baking sheet was a great suggestion, as it made for easy and speedy removal.          Storing these in an air-tight container didn't work for us, as it made the texture too gummy. Wrapping them in foil worked perfectly. I will try these again soon, and would love to try brown sugar for rolling the dough as suggested by another reviewer.

These cookies were just "ok".  My husband commented that they were "missing something" and I have to agree with him. To me these were not sweet enough and they left a after taste.

Very good cookies.  They were wonderfully crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.  I will be making these again.  They are certainly a keeper.

Yummy!  I haven't had snickerdoodles for a long time and my kids thought I was crazy just telling them the name, but once they tried them they didn't care what they were called!  These are great right out of the oven with a tall glass of milk.  Next time more cinnamon for me though...  you can never have too much!  And I loved the way they crack open and contrast with the sugar-cinnamon.  MMMMmmmm!

I added 1/2 c more flour for a cakier cookie, which we prefer.  I refrigerate the dough and make small batches so that I can have a warm cookie with coffee with 8 minutes notice.  Also, I like to use parchment paper to bake on.

These had a great taste, but they were flat. I was looking for a more puffy cookie that cracked like those shown in the picture. Maybe 350 for 8 minutes is the key. I think I followed the temp in the recipe.

These were delicious, but they were only chewy when they were warm even after baking them for 7 min. Is there a way to keep them chewy in the centers?

Wowee!  I've never made a snickerdoodle before, but was looking for something without chocolate for a gift.  These are so yummy that I had to make more because my family ate most of what I was going to give!  Don't overbake - I baked about 2-3 minutes less than called for and they were perfect.

This recipe was great! Very easy to make and the cookies came out perfect - nice and crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.

Yum. So tasty. 8 minutes exactly, let cool a bit on pan then transfer to wire rack.  Added about 1/4c additional flour as they were  pretty sticky.  5 stars. Been making these forever!

My grandmother used to make these and they're so delicious when still soft with a glass of milk. Wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for the recipe.

All I can say is YUMMMMM! Soft in the middle with a light crunch on the outside. These are just like I remember at Christmas time when I was little.  Has ingredients that are usually on hand and easy to make by anyone. Just the smell alone of the cinnamon baking will put you and your family in the holiday spirit! These are a must make for the holidays.

Wow! These came out delicious & this was my first time making snickerdoodles! The only thing I substituted was butter flavored shortening in place of the regular shortening. I baked on a stone as recommended by other users. These cookies came out crunchy & moist. The coworkers love them. Thanks!

I personally do not like snickerdoodles but I made these for my boyfriend and he very much likes them. His only comment was that they were not very chewy inside but I may have baked them a minute too long.

I was very excited to try these out, but I had the same problem with the bitter aftertaste that others have had.  Is it the baking soda or the cream of tartar?  I was disappointed by the bite.  From all of the rave reviews I expected something better.

As if this needed my rating, but I did want to tell you what I did differently.  I scaled this back to 24, just to try it before the cookie exchange.  Then I used all butter (in place of shortening) and used self rising flower and omitted baking soda, salt and cream of tarter.  I cooked a little longer only becuase they didn't seem to "set" so I cooked about 14-16 minutes.  They were crunchy but WONDERFUL.  For the cookie exchange, I will probably stick to the 8-10 minutes.  Thank for this creat recipe.

Everyone loved the cookies!  I only had one cookie sheet, so around the 3rd batch, I began leaving them in the oven for only 7 1/2 minutes.  I also had to add more flour...maybe it was me...but the dough was too sticky.

I experienced the same problem as another reviewer noted--the baking soda taste was apparent. They're pretty good nonetheless, but I doubt I'll make them again and I'm glad I halved the recipe and only ended up with a dozen or so.

I'm sure these would have came out great if I would have made them right--they ended up, after baking, like little cookie balls/bites.  They didn't spread.  Does anyone have any idea what I did wrong?

They tasted just fine, they were just a little bizzarre looking when I went to bake them for a party.

Excellent!  I just made these tonight and they are delicious...crispy on the outside, chewy in the center. Very simple to make. I agree with others on the need to double the sugar-cinnamon mixture. This recipe will definitely stay in my rotation.

I have made these cookies several times and I'm amazed!  They are consistently great!  I make them on a baking stone, so they take a few minutes more to bake (9 min), but they come out perfect, and slide right off the stone!  I gave these as gifts last Christmas!  BIG HIT!  Thank you!

These had great texture and were crisy/chewy. I like that in a cookie. I did find you had to refrigerate the dough before rolling in order to be able to work with it. Also, My cookies had a little bite to them. Like I could taste the baking soda. I am not sure if that is the recipe or my soda. Anyway, They were well received, and will probably make them again to see if that same "taste" is there.

this is the most perfect recipie ever!!! i always get great results - sometimes, i just use white sugar instead of cinn./sug mix and make sugar cookies - have also added choc chips and it makes a large, thin, and crispy choc chip cookie - the snickdoodels are my bf's favorite though!

WOW.
I've never made a snickerdoodle before. This recipe was simple and absolutely perfect. At first I didn't think it would actually make 48 cookies, or that the cinnamon sugar would last long enough. You have to make them somewhat small (like a rounded teaspoon, not tablespoon)... they really expand when cooking. Anyways, its perfect!

The FIRST time I made these, they didn't turn out very well.  I threw the whole batch away.  I wasn't going to try them again.  But I'm glad I did!  I must have done something incorrectly the first go around, because the second time (and every time after) these were DELICIOUS and soft. I have made these more than two dozen times now and they never disappoint.

Thank you Mrs. Sigworth! These are fantastic and SO easy to make. I second J.K. and would double the cinnamon/sugar coating mix next time, in order to have enough for all the cookies. Absolutely fabulous!

I was not impressed with these.  I followed the recipe exactly.  They were so crispy.  I prefer a soft chewy cookie.  My 2 year old really liked them though.

These were wonderful, but no way would I use a 400 degree oven.  I baked them at 350 for 8-10 minutes and even then I had to be careful to watch so they didn't burn.  The recipe makes a lot of cookies.

I never had Snickerdoodles before...these are delicious!!  I even caught my 2 year old daughter "stealing" one from the kitchen while they were still on the cooling racks when she didn't think I was looking!  Even after 5 days, they were still chewy.

Mmmmm.  I have tried to make Snickerdoodles several times over the years, but these are truly wonderful.  They turned out great.  I am known for making cookies that are mishapen and ugly but taste good.  I made these and the taste great, and look great too!

This is better than my Mom's recipe that I grew up with.  I didn't have any shortening so I used 1 cube of butter and 1 cube of margarine.  Cook less time for an extra soft cookie!

My best friend and I were baking these for my boyfriend and they were so good when they came out of the oven, that we ended up eating half of them. They were so soft and chewy in the center and they stayed soft in a tupperware container for days. I changed nothing in this recipe, it was delicious:)

I have made these Snickerdoodles several times now and we love them!  My husband was very surprised because he has never been a Snickerdoodle fan before.  The only change I make to the recipe is that I change the topping measurements to 3 tbsp sugar and 3 tsp cinnamon rather than 2 tbsp sugar/2 tsp cinnamon because the first time I made them I ran out of the topping before I ran out of dough.  Anyway, this is one of our new favorite recipes!

These were EXCELLENT!!! Followed the recipe exactly; cooked for 9 min. 
Each batch turned out great. These are very good "fall" cookies. Took them to a church social and had none to bring home.

good recipe, but needs more sugar on the topping. i would add more next time. also, by the recommendation of some other reviews, i baked at 350 for 8 minutes, but maybe 375 would have been  better because they were just a little gooey.

So great!  When I don't know what kind of cookies to bake I usually resort to these- I've now been doing it for  years!  Perfect every time with the right texture- soft in the middle.

Absolutely delicious! Perfect. I'm really pleased with these cookies, and so are my family members. The only change I made was to add a little bit of demerara brown sugar crystals to the cookie coating mixture for a slightly different texture.

Very Enjoyable, I think the butter makes the difference but 350 is the best temperature to cook them at. Went very, very fast before I could even freeze them.

Very yummy.  Also lowered temp to 375 for 12 minutes, and they were perfect.  Love the crispy edge, chewy inside.  I didn't get 4 dozen though, only about 33 cookies. I also did 3 tbs of sugar to 2 tsp cinnamon.  Thanks for the recipe Beth!

These cookies are absolutely wonderful! I had been craving snickerdoodles for a long time and finally had an excuse to make them for a labor day barbecue. They were a huge hit! This is one of the only recipes I've ever made where my finished product actually looked just like the picture. These are going to be a regular for me! Thanks so much!

I put my butter in the microwave and it was liquified when I made the recipe.  Not sure if this was what made the dough too sticky.  I didn't have time to stick it in the fridge to see if it would firm up, so I just added 1/2 cup more flour.  They still turned out wonderful!

Very crisp and tasty.  I used my pampered chef dough scooper--medium size, I think, to make the balls and had no problem with sticky dough.  They came out flatter than I had hoped for, but still good.

Followed the advice of another post and added more flour to make it more managable for rolling into balls.  Also used butter flavored shortening and I think they are perfect cookies.

These cookies are fantastic.  I let the dough sit in the fridge for an hour before rolling because the dough is somewhat sticky.  I also doubled the sugar,cinnamon coating cutting back on the cinnamon a little-I thought it was a little to much cinnamon against the sugar.  I never even had a snickerdoodle and now I'm a huge fan.

Another great recipe from Beth!  The dough was very easy to work with--not too sticky.  I received compliments on the cookies that I shared with my neighbors.  The only complaint was that they didn't feel like they received enough of them! (guess they should have made it to work on time!)  The only minor changes that I made was to add a bit of spice to the dough--nutmeg and cinnamon.

Absolutly the best cookie I've ever made! Snickerdoodles are my favorite but mine (out of the Better Homes and Garden cookbook) never seemed to turn out as well as other peoples that I had tasted. So I compaired the recipes. I had been using more flour and less cr of tartar and baking soda,per my recipe, hence my cookies weren't rising and crackeling like they were supposed to. This will be my Snickerdoodle recipe from now on. Perfect as written!

I made these for a church function and people were oohing and ahhing as they were muching down.  I doubled the recipe and used a bit more sugar and cinnamon for the rolling mixture, other than that the recipe is perfect.  Mine didn't flatten out at all and they were so chewy inside... the best snickerdoodle recipe out there.  The title of this recipe should be the "Ultimate Snickerdoodle"

I've never been much of a snickerdoodle person but these cookies are awesome. I made them for a bake sale and they were gone instantly!

These cookies are delicious and look very nice if you are interested in giving them as a gift.  I have already made two batches this week and they are all gone.  If you prefer cookies that do not thin out as much, us 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup 10X.

This recipe makes WONDERFUL cookies!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great Snickerdoodle recipe!  Note that this recipe only makes 4 dozen if you make the cookies relatively small.  For larger cookies, you will get somewhere around 2 dozen.
Once again GREAT RECIPE!

These cookies has an AWESOME consistency!!  They were sooo soft but not gooey!  Yumm.  The mixture that you roll it in had a little more cinnamon then I am used to for snickerdoodle's, but that is a personal taste.
Yumm! :)

These are delicious and look exactly like the pictures, however, as a matter of personal taste, I prefer my cookies "puffier" or thicker, therefore I would give this a 4 1/2 stars and I realize that these look and taste FABULOUS, but I will still look for a recipe that makes a puffier cookie.

Very enjoyable, light and airy while being tasty too.  We added a little extra cinnamon mix to coat as the 'balls' were very sticky and mushy before baking but this recipe is a keeper anyway - simply because of a classic taste and style :)

Success on the first try! I found the ziploc bag very helpful in coating the dough balls. In addition, I used the bottom of a small cup to lightly flatten the dough a bit on the baking sheet before baking for a nice round shape. Using Silpat also helps in preventing the dough from sticking.

Found this recipe about a month ago and have made it about 10 times now.  Everyone loves them and they are SO easy to make.  My 3 year old loves to help by rolling the cookie dough in the sugar/cinnamon mixture!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These are just like the ones I used to make when I was little. I wouldn't leave them in the oven any longer than 10 minutes or else the entire cookie gets crispy. My second batch was a lot chewier than my first.

This is the BEST comfort food recipe imaginable!  These cookies were so good---which says alot coming from me....I don't get to eat sweets often for health reasons, so when I do splurge, I expect it to be worth it--and were these ever!  Easy to make and tasted right out of a bakery! The perfect consistency and attractive as well.  Perfect for a bake sale!

Maybe it's just me.  I thought I liked snickerdoodles (been awhile), but this cookie tasted bland and boring.  Even my husband (he'll eat any cookie) thought they were kind of boring.  I agree with other reviewers soft out of the oven, but hard within a short time.  I probably could have cooked them for only 7 minutes.  I would err on the side of underdone when taking them out of the oven.  They harden up quickly after cooling!! Be careful.  Either way I won't make them again, but I'm sure they are a good cookie.  Just not my thing.

Excellent cookies!  The only reason I didn't give them a 5 was because the following day, the cookies aren't soft and chewy anymore - and I did store them in an airtight container.  They're very good, though!

Great!  These cooked perfectly!  I may add a little extra vanilla or cinnamon next time for a little extra flavor.  I'll be baking these again and again!

WOW!!!!!! I substituted the butter and shortening for a stick of "I can't believe it's not butter" for health reasons.  This can usually break a recipe but I thought I'd try it anyway.  Oh my goodness...these were amazing.  I can't imagine how great they are with the full recipe!  Enjoy!

Very soft in the center and a little crispy on the outside.  They were perfect after 8 minutes.  They are so easy and look just like the picture.

I have made these snickerdoodles many times and they always turn out wonderful. 8 minutes baking time is perfect. I cool the dough in the refrigerator between batches, so it's easier to roll. I just made these for my daughter to take to school for her birthday, but I modified it a bit. We rolled them in sprinkles (the tiny round multi-colored ones) then baked them. My daughter had fun rolling them in the sprinkles, and they turned out so cute and very yummy! I got lots of compliments on them. Next time I make them with the sprinkles I might only put them on the top...it was pretty sweet. I like this recipe because the cookies don't flatten out. They always turn out moist and chewy. Great recipe!

Yum! I have only made the snickerdoodles in the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook. Glad I tried these ones. They're very rich and buttery - not too crispy, not too soft. Perfect combination.

These were great.  I made the cookies a little big in the first batch and they spread a lot.  They turned out good anyway.  My kids loved these.

Amazing cookies!! My boyfriend and 2 friends ate all of them within an hour! Best right out of the over. I can see that they wouldnt store very well. Variation: add a few sprinkles of cinnamon to the dough before rolling them.

These cookies are amazing, I swear.  I'm only 15, and I recently found this cookie recipe online.  I've already made them 5 times,and I will continue to do so.   My little cousin loved them when we made them, and so did I.  I try to watch what I eat, but when these cookies are hot and fresh from the oven, I can't help but eat more and more.  My family loves this recipe.  I always use Mrs. Sigg's recipes for the ultimate cookie experience!

I thought these were pretty good.  Not the best be/ca they were a bit dry.  Too much flour i thought.  Also, i used 1 1/2 Tbsp of cinnamon and 3Tbsp of sugar.

These are great!  I usually make chocolate cookies but I decided these sounded good.  The first batch I made just as the recipe says.  The second batch I decided to add some chocolate chips to the center of the cookies.  Both batches are very tasty!

This was all wrong. I did not get the number of cookies it claimed to have made, the time was too high at 400 and should be more like 325 or 350. I will keep looking.

These were pretty good.  My kids loved them, as did my coworkers, my husband, my kid's friends, and my daughter's confirmation class including the pastor.  They were quite "eggy" tasting to me.  I doubled the recipe since I make big cookies and I usually only get about half as many as the recipe says it makes.  Not this one!   I got a 7 1/2 dozen big cookies out of this doubled.  Everyone got to try some!

I have been searching for a great snickerdoodle recipe for years, and this is it!!  These are soft and chewy in the middle and crispy on the edges.  They are also EXTREMELY easy to make.  Give them a try and they will knock your socks off!!

Made these cookies last night and they didn't seem that special.  It seemed like a normal cookie.  There wasn't a lot of flavor to the cookie and all I really tasted was the butter and shortening.  Very disappointing

I followed some other suggestions and only cooked for 8 min and the cookies came out perfect.  I also used 3 T sugar and 3 tsp cinammon.  I chilled the dough and kept some water handy for my fingers- this kept the dough from sticking to my hands.  Awesome cookie!

Great quick cookie recipe. Easy and yummy! We always heat any leftover cookies up in the microwave and it's just like they are fresh out of the oven again!!

The BEST snickerdoodles ever!  I don't usually prefer snickerdoodles.  But these were completely addicting!  I strongly recommend this recipe!

Wow!  Should be 10 stars. I hate cooking sweet things and I don't particularly like eating them but these are exceptional.  I subbed the baking soda and cream of tartar for just baking powder and they came out fine.  I mixed the sugar and cinnamon on a plate and rolled the dough balls in them and - as I said before - they were great.  Cooked them for 8 mins exactly.

Very tasty.  Thanks to other reviewers for the suggestion of using a plastic bag to coat the balls, this tip made that step super easy.  Also I lightly "floured" my hands so that the dough would not stick.  I also used 3 Tbl spoons of sugar and 3 Tsp of cinnamon for the coating. So yummy! Thanks Mrs Siggs!

For some reason these cookies did not flatten.  They looked like balls that were cracking open.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used Splenda For Baking instead of sugar.  Maybe that's why.(?)  Also they tasted a little dry.  I didn't overcook them, so they did not burn.  Can't help but think that maybe I did something wrong.

This is the exact same recipe that my grandmother gave me over 10 years ago. I've never made a different Snickerdoodle recipe as these have always tasted wonderful. A bonus is that the recipe is easy to make which makes them fun to make with my children.

These are fabulous cookies!  I made them with my niece, and they came out wonderful.  I had my first snickerdoodle at a coffee shop, and wanted to make my own.  These are better than the ones in the cafe!  My boyfriend brought a dozen to work with him and shared them with his co-workers -  they all thought they were store bought and asked where they could buy them ; )

These were incredible - the perfect blend of butter and sugar taste, and still soft in the middle.  YUM!  I made these with the new Splenda/Sugar blend, and they came out perfectly!

These were just ok.  They were a little too crispy - maybe I made them too small.  Nothing special, but a fine snack.

Great recipe. I made 4 batches - for two of them I accidently left out the cream of tartar and I think this made the cookies chewier.  Either way, there were no leftovers!

I have only had snickerdoodles once before - and they may have been over cooked because there were not as nice as these.

My tip - if you have the choice of one or the other - UNDERBAKE them...  I cooked them for about 6 minutes and when you pushed them they were still quite soft but as they cooled they got crispy round the edges.  Trust me - do a small batch to test it if you like - but the shorter time is better :)

I also found that (on my second batch) they were nice if you rolled them in ground cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon because it brings out the flavour more.

But all in all - a great recipe!

I'm really not having a good week with recipes, it seems... Because of all the rave reviews, I decided to make these 'un-tested' to go in gift cookie tins for husband's co-workers. I was really unimpressed with both the flavor and the appearance. I ended up throwing the first batch away, and adding choc chips to the second batch of dough. These were ok, but not great, and certainly not good enough to give away. What a shame.

It's no Mrs. Fields, but its good. The cookies did not spread much, although the dough was an excellent consistency. I had to press the balls flat before baking. Be careful, they over bake very easily! When done just right, they're very good.

Better than the Martha Stewart recipe I usually use.  Also, I used corn oil instead of the butter and they turned out just fine- very moist, chewy, yet crisp outside.  I wouldn't be overly generous with the salt however, and don't overbake!

Wow!!  This was my first try at snickerdoodles, and I was really happy with the way they turned out!! They are nice and light, sweet but not too sweet,and with just the right amount of crunch!!  They look so pretty when they come out of the oven too!!
 These are a great cookie to make with the kids...my 5 year old daughter had a blast rolling the cookies in the sugar/cinnamon mix.

This is my second time submitting a review.  I continue to love this recipe and happened upon a wonderful twist on the original recipe.  I ran out of vanilla while making them the other day, so instead of 2 tsp of vanilla, I did 1 tsp of vanill and 1 tsp almond extract.  It is delicious!

This is the only snickerdoodle recipe I use now because it is just so easy and tasty!! I like to use butter flavored shortening rather than just plain and I think it makes a difference. No matter what variation you use however, these cookies are bound to turn out perfect.

Didn't like it the first time I tried this recipe. I figured I'd done something wrong, like left them in the pan too long, so I made them again and this time they were absolutely perfect! This is now my favorite recipe! Try using "Spectrum" brand Organic Shortening (TRANS FAT FREE).

Very nice and tasty cookie. You definitely need 3tbsp of sugar and 3tsp of cinnamon to roll the cookies around in. Bake for 8 minutes and they turn out just right. Thanks for the recipe.

These were good.  I had a recipe for snickerdoodles when I was a kid that I liked better, though, but haven't been able to find it.

Yum!  Cripsy on the outside and chewy inside, just as promised.  I halved the amount of tatar and used all butter as suggested- I also made half the recipie and it still worked out fine.  Only thing was that they were a little sweet for my tastes...I'll add less sugar next time.  Great recipie!

The first batch I baked for exactly 8 minutes and they came out pretty burnt on the bottom, the second batch for exactly 7.5 minutes and they too came out a little burnt on the bottom but tasted very good about 10 minutes after coming out of the oven. But about an hour or so later, they tasted even more burnt and were dry. Nobody really ate these and many got thrown away. These cookies could be really very good if you're just very cafeful with the bake time. Also, these cookies don't flatten out (which threw me off). I'd say about 6.5-7 minutes bake time.

These cookies are wonderful.  My family loves snickerdoodles, and I can never find a recipes that keep them chewy and moist.  My daughter enjoyed helping roll the balls into the sugar and cinnamon mixture.

These came out dry, cake-like, and rather bland.  Part of the reason is that they didn't spread at all, so I left them in the oven longer than I should have, thinking they needed more time.  If I make these again, I will use all butter in place of the shortening so that they will spread more.  I'll add a bit more sugar too.  They weren't bad, just not what I was wanting.  My husband said they were more like muffins, which was pretty accurate.

I am incredibly picky about what cookie recipes i use. This is the first time i have ever made Snickerdoodles, and I think these are great cookies! They had a  beautiful look. Taste great although they do have a bit of a cream of tartar aftertaste, so I will try the suggestions to halve the tartar, and I will also try  butter instead of shortning.

This recipe has got me hooked on snickerdoodles.  I was looking for something different to make and so I tried this recipe, and now I make them all of the time.  I had to adjust the temp down, but it may just be my oven.  Crispy and chewy and addicting.

This is an awesome recipe and the only one I use. I threw the other ones away. I have made them using only butter when I was out of shortening with great results. I do add more sugar to the sugar/cinnamon mixture out of personal preference. I bake them 7-8 minutes, never 10!!!!

These were good, but they kept falling apart and I followed the recipe exactly. I would also recommend to very lightly grease the cookie sheets, because the cookies DO stick. Other than that, the cookies were good.

I had to keep watching them to make sure they were cooked enough but didn't burn. Also, the cinnamon coating was kind of thin. But once I had them right, they were DELICIOUS.

I really liked this recipe.  But instead of using the shortening, I used butter and it worked out even better.  This recipe was so good I've been making them for all my family and friends.  Thanks!

Great recipe! I chilled the dough for a couple of hours and used a cookie scoop to make the balls.  I rolled the dough in vanilla sugar with about 1/2 the cinnamon the recipe calls for.  We really enjoyed them!

You must pat down the balls of dough!!!! That step is skipped in the recipe. I don't like these cookies. I jfind them dry and the over all taste isn't that great.

I didn't have shortening on hand, so I used 1 cup of butter and they turned out GREAT.  I also reccommend pressing the dough balls with a jar or cup to flatten them slightly.  They look very pretty when they come out of the oven.  I took them to a family in our church after they had twins, and they (parents not the twins :-)  loved them.  We also kept some for ourselves, and my husband-- who wrinkles his nose at all cookies except for chocolate chip-- kept coming back for more.

This recipe is wonderful!  It's now our favorite non-chocolate cookie.  I had to double the recipe for a school function and followed the recipe but baked them at 375 instead of 400.  Everyone loved this Snickerdoodle.

Really good snickerdoodles.  I baked on air-bake cookie sheets at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, and they were perfect!

These were incredible.  I made the mistake of baking them on aluminum foil for my first batch and the bottems burned, but when I followed the instructions and used an ungreased cookie sheet, they came out perfect.  I love these!!!!

I was a snickerdoodle virgin before I found this recipe!  It took me a little while to get the cinnamon/sugar level to my liking.  The first few I baked turned out good but the bottom burned from the sugar.  I added (a lot) more sugar and didn't roll the bottom of the dough ball in it.  It came out just great!  I agree that there is a cream of tartar aftertaste, but then again, I'm new to the snickerdoodle world... perhaps that is it's signature.

Good, but nothing special.  I thought the cookies had the right texture and the right amount of cinnamon and sugur, but for some reason, something was missing.  I'll probably give this recipe one more try, especially considering the glowing reviews.  I used regular shortening with this batch...maybe butter flavored shortening would give it that extra "umph."

These were very good.  I baked them for less time than it called for, but they still came out too crispy for me.  Next time I'll try baking them for even less time.

Fabulous.  I made one modification and that was to use only a 1/4 cup of shortening and 3/4 cup of margarine.  This was only because I ran out of shortening.  Even with this modification, these turned out perfect.  I will definitely make again and again.

Cookie dough was too wet to roll into a ball so I dropped them by tablespoon onto a cookie sheet and sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar mixture on them.  They were good.

These are awsome, I used butter flavored crisco and I think it makes them taste even better. For years I have been making them with regular crisco so I decided to use the butter flavor to experiment and I think they came out wonderful.I also used 3 cups of flour just because I like my cookies a little "cakier".

Put cinnamon-sugar mix in plastic ziploc bag.  Add rolled balls to it.  (Added extra cinnamon and sugar per "Liza Cauvitar's" review here).  Turned down oven to 375.  Baked only for 8 minutes and removed right away from pan. Just wonderful!

Not much new to add to what everyone else has said. These are terrific cookies, and they are pretty easy to make too. I didn't use parchment paper, but mine came of the baking sheets with no problem. I baked them for 9 minutes, and I took them off the sheets right away. Beth Sigworth, you are some kind of cookie genius!

EXCELLENT!  My husband has been wanting me to make good snickerdoodles for years, and I have tried...  This is so wonderful.  We had heard that a sour cream base is the secret to a popular commercial snickerdoodle, so I added 2 T sour cream and baked them a couple minutes longer.  They were unbelievable.  Perfect.  I don't even know if the sour cream made any difference at all.  This recipe is incredible.  Thanks.

Great, classic snickerdoodles, but a couple of minor things... I used a full cup of butter shortning plus 3 T of water instead of half butter and half shortning. Also, I had to add almost a cup of flour to thicken it up a bit. I also found that it got easier to mold into balls after it had sat out for a while to set. But, 10 minutes in the oven made for perfect, wonderful cookies, just like I remember from my childhood...

I didn't have shortening so I used butter. (Don't know if it makes a difference?)
The cookies look very beautiful, but I don't think I liked them better than the Lemon Sugar Tea Cookies from this site.
I needed almost a double batch of the cinnamon-sugar!
The dough is sticky but can easily be shaped into balls.
The next day the cookies tasted MUCH better!!
Will try them again using shortening if I can find it somewhere.

If there were a 6 star rating, these cookies would get it!!  We just got a new oven and I have NEVER made ANYTHING from scratch, let alone bake much at all.  Let me tell you, this recipe is AWESOME!  Took them to a carry in 'Pig Roast' and they were G-O-N-E-!!!!  everyone wanted this recipe!!

These are absolutely fabulous! My husband doesn't even really like cinnamon and he raved about them. We ate so many the night I made them that I had to make another batch for the potluck at work that they were intended for. Co-workers loved them too and I spent half the day passing out copies of the recipe.

Awesome cookie.  Easy to make and yummy to eat.  Just watch cause they go from under done to over done in a couple of minutes.  Its best to take them out a tiny bit on the early side rather than the late side.  They were melt in your mouth when soft but still pretty good even crunchy.  :o)

These were a very big hit.  I too ran out of the cinnamon-sugar mix and had to make more to finish the batch.  Very chewy and they look great!  Will definitely make again.

My search is over!! I've been looking for a good snickerdoodle recipe, one that's not hard. These are perfectly crunchy on the edges and soft and chewy in the center. Don't change a thing in this recipe, it's perfect.

these were very good. i made a batch of these and a batch of Beth's spicy oatmeal raisin cookies for easter visiting with family and friends. while i prefer the oatmeal raisin cookies, friends who like sugar cookies thought these were the best. they turned out very well indeed, great recipe. i may decrease the cinnamon in the topping mix next time, just to play around a bit-- i thought they were a bit cinnamon-y. but definitely great cookies! Mrs. Sigworth, you have helped me learn how to bake wonderful cookies-- thanks!!

These cookies tasted great.  I added chocolate chips to them.  I probably overcooked them.  They weren't chewy once they cooled.  I will do just 8 minutes next time.

These are the absolute best snickerdoodles.  They come out perfect everytime.  The cooking time is hard to get done for different ovens, but if you watch them just right, they turn out perfectly.  Although the ingredients make it not for the dieter, I can suggest any substitutions, because they are just right as is.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I roll the dough in a brown sugar cinnamon mix at the end, because that appeals to my son more.  He says they are scrumptious!  Thanks Mrs. Sigg.

I thought these cookies tasted a bit "eggy" but the texture was great, will try these again but play around with the recipe a bit.

The cookies were (past tense because they never stick around for very long...)delicious!  I've baked them several times and everyone loved them.  My six-year old loves to help by rolling the dough in the sugar/cinammon mix.  We like our cookies a little chewey, so I bake them for 8 minutes based on what one reviewer suggested and they came out perfectly!  ENJOY!

These did not turn out as good as other snickerdoodles I've had.  At the suggested baking time, the cookies were still completely raw so I had to bake them a little longer.  Perhaps that was my error.  They still tasted good but were a tad too crispy.  I will try them again.

These were perfect!  My husband made them actually and they were awesome.  Like a few other people mentioned, the only thing we did differently was increase the amount of sugar to 1/4c to roll them in.  Other than that, we followed the directions exactly and everyone loved them.  Thanks so much!

Simple yet fabulous!  The cookies are still delicious after two days -- crispy outer edges and soft centers -- after storing in airtight containers.  I will definitely add this recipe to my "keeper" list!

Delicious cookies, easy to make.  I even forgot and left a batch in the oven for 15 minutes, and while they were very crunchy, they still were good.  I'll definitely make these again.

These were wonderful!  The only thing I did wrong was leave them in the oven for 15 min, they looked undercooked at 10 min.  So they turned out hard.  But they were still very tasty!  I'll definitely be making these for my Christmas baskets.

These were a hit with family and friends.  I wish, however, that they stayed softer longer.  Even in an airtight container they were hard by the end of the day.

Okay, I don't know what I did wrong!  The texture was great, nice and fluffy, but they had almost no taste!

Great cookie. Didn't flatten out, stayed nice and thick. Tasted great! I ran out of the cinnamon/sugar mixture and had to make more.

These cookies turned out great, just the way I remembered them from childhood.  I like my cookies chewy, so I cooked them for 8 minutes only and immediately put them on a cooling rack.  They were perfect.  Hubby loved them also.

I tried this recipe with egg substitute and 1/2 splenda sugar, and it still worked great!  I still rolled the cookies in regular sugar and they baked at 400 degrees for 9 minutes.  Great recipe!

I made this at my apartment and they turned out really round and fluffy.  Later on, I made them at my parents house and they came out flat.  I made them the same way, and both were incredible.  Also, I added baking powder and they fluffed up and were very good as well!

This made a great snickerdoodle. I thought perhaps a -slight- bit more vanilla and sugar could do, though.

I absolutely loved these cookies. I am not a cookie maker but we had to make some for Boy Scouts. I tried two other recipes for sugar cookies and I just wasn't happy with them. I tried this recipe and they were GREAT. Everyone loved them. I will make them again and again.

I'm thirteen yers old and these cookies are great!  My little brothers and sisters all ate them really quickly while I was at school so I only got 2.  But since this recipe is so good, I'll be making this again and again.

Okay I made the HUGE mistake of trying to remove these cookies immediately off the cookie sheet when they came out of the oven...they crumbled and glued onto the sheet...I finally let the last batch just sit on the sheet until they completely cooled and they turned out incredible...Now that I know what I'm doing I would make these again... They were fantastic!!

Great cookies!! I used butter flavored crisco, double dipped in the cinnamon mixture, and turned my oven down to 375 degrees. They were so good- and gone in one afternoon!!

Place in the fridge for an hour and skip the cinnamon - a great start for sugar cookies that can be cut into shapes and frosted.  The basic cinnamon recipe is great too!

This recipe has all the ingredients to be a good cookie (minus the crisco) and it is...I found trying to figure out when they are done without burning them is a bit frustrating. One too done ...one set googy...third perfect..... 8-8.5 minutes at 400 using parchment paper seems to do the trick with my oven.  I also added currants to the third rack of cookies and they were liked best. I followed the recipe exactly even though I wanted to use all butter....might the next time...I appreciate all comments given as I read them all before making any of the recipes on the site.....Very helpful.....Keep them coming :O)

I love Snickerdoodles from a well known buffet restaurant. The cookies from this recipe taste just like the ones in the restaurant! The kids in  my daycare even helped. Few ingredients, quick prep and bake time make it simple and ready to eat in minutes.

*Try adding Herseys "CINNAMON CHIPS" (located in the baking isle near the chocolate chips) to these awesome cookies!  My kids loved them!  The very first time I made them, a friend told me they were the best Snickerdoodles they ever had!

Excellent. Rolled the dough in colored sugar, rather than the cinnamon sugar mixture, for the holidays. Everyone liked.

By far the best snickerdoodles ever!  I use all butter instead of 1/2 shortening, and I double dip the cookies in the cinnamon sugar mix to give them extra flavor.

great snickerdoodles. reminds me of the ones I had as a kid. Very easy. I also tried grinding up about 1 cup of white chocolate chips and coffee flavored chips and mixing that in with the dough. It worked well. Everyone loved both versions.

I've always loved making snickerdoodles. When I ran across this recipe that varied slightly from my own I thought I'd give it a try.  I'm glad I did!  These cookies stayed moist and chewy and perfect.  I like rolling them in the cinnamon sugar but for a change I used orange flavoring instead of vanilla and frosted them with orange butter frosting instead of sugaring them.  They didn't even last the whole day at my house! Now I'm thinking of all the variations that I could with this cookie recipe. Thanks, Beth for a great recipe.

My wife & I really, really like this recipe.  The first time we made them, we also made some oatmeal-chocolate chip cookies, because these sounded a little plain & boring.  Although tasty, the chocolate chip cookies went stale & we wound up making another batch of these they were soooo good.  I did not have any problem with the cooking time or temperature as some of the others did, but I didn't get quite as many cookies out of the batch as the recipe said I would.  Also, try experimenting with the cinnamon mixture -- I added a pinch of ginger & fresh nutmeg.

This is the best recipe!  My old recipe had to chill forever, and it wasn't as tasty.  I have noticed that you have to watch out because they burn easily.  But all my friends beg me to cook snickerdoodles!  I love this recipe!

This recipe is wonderful.  I found that 9 1/2 mins was sufficient enough to set them without burning them or having them turn out too soft.  just right.  I also added a little touch of my own to my batch.  I pressed my thumb in the middle of the rolled cookie to make a small indentation and added a seedless raspberry jam in the center.  Mmmm.  Is it ever good.  But give it a good 10 mins to cool before eating because THEY'RE HOT!  Ouch!

These do taste good, but I had the burning problem.  The first batch was wonderful (my oven must not had been at 400 yet), the second batch started to burn at 8 minutes.  I lowered the time by one minute and removed them from the baking sheet right away and was able to save the rest of the cookies!  I will make them again, I'll just keep my adjustments since ovens DO VARY!  :)  Thank you Mrs. Siggs.

I am a snickerdoodle connoiseur and these are terrific!  Actually they are the same recipe as from Betty Crocker, but using 1/2 butter & 1/2 shortening plus the addition of vanilla really makes these outstanding.  I am throwing away my other recipe....this is a keeper!

I think this recipe is wonderful. The cookies have just the right amount of sweetness and the texture is fabulous. I made them in a cookie press and after they were on the cookie sheets ready for the oven, I sprinkled them with cinnamon /sugar combination. They came out just like I had bought them. I highly recommend them.

My three year old loved them! 

I wasn't as impressed, the texture was great but I didn't like the overall flavor. Maybe it was me it was my first time having Snickerdoodles.

Although I'm not an expert on Snickerdoodles this was my first time making them  I wasn't really impressed :( I thought the texture was great but the overall taste was somewhat bland.  On the other hand my three year old loved them.

This recipe is wonderful! I make it when ever I get a chance. I'm a college student with very little time, but this recipe is quick and easy, and the cookies are usually gone within minutes of leaving the oven. My friends and family love them!

AMAZING!! I baked them the first time with eggbeaters, and the were wonderful, but the second time I used real eggs and they practically doubled in size and were much more fluffy! Everyone begs me to fix them! By far my favorite cookie recipe!!

This is a great cookie! I have been  making them for a long time and they are still 
a favorite. I make changes sometimes...I add 1 tsp almond flavoring and roll them i
in plain suger with out the cinnamon. Have also rolled them in colored sugars for
 the holidays.  Kotton in MN

This is a really quick to mix cookie recipe.  The cookies are chewy, not crisp and crumbly.  Definately a keeper recipe.

Fantastic tasting cookie.  Very chewy and melts in your mouth.  I love how the cookie is even chewy next day, which makes them disappear fast around my house.  I took a double-sized batch into work, and they were all gone before lunchtime. 

Two suggestions: Grease a small ice cream scooper and use that for even-sized cookies.  I had problems with smaller ones getting too dark before the larger cookies were done.  Also if you use dark nonstick pans, make sure to use parchment paper or the bottoms burn.

This recipe is VERY simple to make, great for kids. Cookies are really tasty, especially if you're looking for something that is not really sugary. One thing I found is baking at 400 degrees for 8 minutes resulted in burned cookies. I lowered it to 350 and baked them for 5-6 mins, worked perfectly! *Also used no cream of tartar, were delicious.

Excellent, easy recipe! I substituted butter flavored Crisco for the shortning, and used margarine instead of butter, and had excellent results. Half way through, I ran out of the cinnamon / sugar mixture, so you will need to double it. I used a mixture of ginger / cinnamon and had a really spicy sweet cookie. Great recipe!

I grew up with my grandmother's snickerdoodles.  I was so spoiled with them.  I was craving them one night (one of those pregnancy things) and it was too late to call her.  So I made these.  They are every bit as good as my grandmother's!  Soft and chewy!  Not crunch and hard like little hockey pucks!  Yum!

I have been making this recipe for 20 years. My mother passed it on to me. I take them to work frequently---and have multiple requests each week for more!! One add on that is excellent---try adding a cup of raisins to the mix. Don't change the baking time.

Not that this recipe needs another review, but these cookies are yummy! 8 minutes is the perfect cooking time even though they don't look set. I didn't have any cream of tartar and they still turned out great. I will make these cookies again!

This is the second time I have rated this recipe, the first being over 6 years ago when my daughter and I began making these cookies on Christmas Eve for Santa! Although we also make them throughout the year, they are our special "Santa" cookies and have become a wonderful and delicious recipe for our family. My daughter is going off to college next year, bring many changes to traditions in our home. But I truly hope that makeing Mrs. Sigg's Snickerdoodles will continue. Thanks so much, Beth Sigworth, for a recipe that has produced so many heartwarming memories!

Everyone who has tried these simply loves them.  They ship and store well.  The first time my wife made them, the smell brought me downstairs in search of a hot cookie.  I told her they were the real deal.  My daughter and her friends enjoy making them with my wife.
Thank you Beth for a wonderful recipe!

Great Cookies! However, rolling into balls and coating with sugar mixture is very sticky and time consuming. Also, keep a close eye on baking, cookies quickly become overcooked. All in all, they are delicious and we will bake again.

These are a staple in my home too - one of the best cookie recipes on this website.  Another way to make them a little different is to replace half the cinnamon for the outside with ground cardamom.  This gives the cookie a nice citrusy tinge.

Next time I think I would use less cream of tarter, it had a slight bitter aftertaste. But all in all a very good snickerdoodle recipe. Its time consuming and messy to roll the dough though, so recruit a kid if you can!

These snickerdoodles were absolutely wonderful and by far the best recipe I've had for them!!  My family nibbled them up hot from of the oven and there were none left for the cookie jar by the end of the night.  Thanks so much for sharing!  I have a family of very picky eaters and these cookies were a HUGE hit :o)

Absolutely wonderful.  Must be watched carefully to insure the right amount of cooking time, too much and they are not as chewy!!  Excellent combination of ingredients.

Absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious cookies!  Soft and chewy, just like I like 'em.  The only negative part was that it took a lot of time required to roll all the cookies in cinnamon/sugar; also, I'd increase the cinnamon/sugar mixture by another tablespoon.  Very worthy of the top ten list!

Very simple ingredients, so I wasn't expecting a lot from this cookie, 
but since it had such great ratings I decided to give it a try.  I
was very pleasantly surprised.  This is a very yummy cookie, and SO easy to make.
Very good cookie!

These are fast, easy and most of all incredible to eat! I couldn't believe how perfect they came out, and they were just as moist and chewy the next day! My friends think I am the ultimate snickerdoodle maker, but Mrs. Sigg is really to thank! Incredible recipe!

These cookies were wonderful.  It seemed to take longer than I thought to roll each ball of cookie dough into the sugar-cinnamon mix, but other than that, my entire family loved them to death!!!

I was never a big fan of snickerdoodles until I tried these.  The others I've tried were all dry and tough, but these are so soft and chewy inside!The recipe was so fast and easy to make and uses ingredients that are always on hand.  Thanks for sharing!!

down to fit our family of 4 and it worked out great.

When I lost my recipe for snickerdoodles, I came to allrecipes.  Boy, was I lucky!! These are the best snickerdoodles I have ever tasted and I have been making these since I was a little girl. No refrigeration!!! (My old recipe called for that!) And unfortunately, I just know it is the shortening that makes them so yummy and light; of course it would have to be the most fattening ingredient in the recipe.  Kudos to Mrs. Sigg!

These turned out delicious and were so easy to make.  I, too, recommend baking them only 8 minutes to keep them soft.  Some of mine were baked a little too long.

I used to make snickerdoodles in a high school class and I could never find the recipe.  I think these were wonderful and they do stay soft if you cook them for the lowest amount of time.  I will keep these in my cookbook

Because my friends and families love "big handfuls" I made these cookies larger than the recipe called for.  The flavor was great and they kept well. I didn't experience the problem of some reviewers who complained that they turned into hard hockey pucks.  I would recommend that you don't overbake and store in a tightly covered container.

Great cookies. These cookies have a beautiful crackley top and a wonderful flavor!  If you want them to stay soft, put them in an air-tight container with a piece of plain white bread.  The cookies will suck the moisture out of the bread and stay wonderful.

This is the best Snickerdoodle recipe I've tried yet and will be my last!  I cooked them for the minimum time and my husband and neighbors ate them up instantly.  Last time I increased the recipe to ten dozen so they would last more than a couple of days.  Thanks!  Mindy S.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Thank You for sharing it. I did add alittle more cinnamon and sugar when rolling them and I did sprinkle the sugar and cinammon after they came out of the oven. They are wonderful and a must keep. I would not flatten them like I have heard though. I tried both ways and the way the recipe says is the best..TY again for sharing

I have been making Snickerdoodles for several years.  They are a family favorite.  My three year old has fun just saying the name.  If you want these cookies to stay soft for more than a day, take them out of the oven a couple of minutes early.

These cookies RIP!  I am so glad that Beth is so willing to share her fabulous finds.  Everyone in my office loved them.  They lasted less than 24 hours!  I don't think that they should be flattened, as some reviewers have noted.  I did about half and half, and the flatter ones were less soft and chewy.

Holy Cow!  I made a double batch and got 3 dozen Jumbo cookies, which my husband and coworkers promptly scarfed down.  I think this is my hubby's new favorite cookie!  They stay crispy and chewy too, when stored in Tupperware.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

Great cookies.  I made for Christmas this year and got rave reviews from all of my friends and family.  I added 2 tsp. of cinnamon to the cookie dough itself too, turned out really yummy!

These were very tasty cookies, with the exception that the texture really changes after they cool off.  My children loved them, but I was looking for something that wouldn't turn into a hockey puck, and this cookie DIDN'T deliver.  I you have guests that will be eating them right out of the oven then you are safe, but I wouldn't take them to work, etc, because as I said the texture really turns stale and hard after an hour or so.

Thanks for the recipe.  When you can't be home for the holidays, it's nice to have a taste of home.  These were great.  I can't wait until my toddler wakes up from his nap and gets to taste them.  He's my harshest critic.  Merry Christimas!

They were great the night I made them but I was disappointed the next day, when they turned into hard little disks.  The flavor is good, but I prefer a softer cookie.

I made these cookies last weekend as a part of a cookie exchange.  They were so good.  I made one batch and by the end of the day, my boyfriend and our other friends had eaten every cookie.  I am going to make two or three more batches this weekend and save them for Christmas!  They are delicious and very easy and quick to make.

Simply perfect!!  These were my dad's favorite cookies so I was happy to find this recipe.  Now my two children get to help roll the cookies in the sugar just like I did when I was a child.  I'm so glad that such a great recipe can now be part of their holiday memories too.  Thanks!!

Ive always liked snickerdoodles. I think they are the bestwarm cookie fresh from the oven to make! Thats when they taste the best. I will continue to use this recipe whenever i want snickerdoodles. I do suggest flattening the cookie out some before you bake them. Otherwise the stay kinda clumped up. Great cookie!

Great cookies. Perfect as a Chistmas cookie for parties or as an easy gift. The cinnamon brings on a warm fun feeling of the Fall and holidays coming up soon.It's a tasty cross between a sugar cookie and a butter cookie with a warm cinnamon coat.

If I were you I'd be in the kitchen right now making these absolutely wonderful cookies! Oh they are so delicious right out of the oven! A perfect cookie for a chilly autumn day. Try them with a mug of hot spiced cider. Thank you Beth for taking the time to share this recipe with us!

I just finished making these delicious little cookies and my kids are at the table munching them.  Not only are they extremely easy to make but my 3 year old helped me by rolling the balls in the sugar.  He also made some snakes, which came out good aswell.  Great recipe that I will pass on to my friends. Christine

Quick, easy, and delicious! I flattened the cookies before baking, then sprinkled more cinnamon & sugar on when they came out of the oven. Thanks for a great recipe! Try adding Skor's (toffee) baking pieces for a really good kick.
