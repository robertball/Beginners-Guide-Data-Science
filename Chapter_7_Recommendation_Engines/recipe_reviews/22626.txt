This is the best fruitcake ever! It's the kind of fruitcake I grew up with, and I had been searching for this recipe for a long time. The nuts really make the cake -- very crunchy and chewy and dense. Beautiful to look at too, each slice like a stained-glass window. The first time I made this, I ate half a loaf in one sitting -- it is that irresistible!

This being my first fruitcake, I really didn't know what to expect. I didn't add as much fruit as the recipe said and it came out great. Nice mellow flavor. Let set for a week or two.

My first fruitcake attempt and it turned out well. It was a little dry; but I may have overbaked it. As a remedy, I wrapped in cheesecloth soaked in apple juice for several days and it moistened up fine. I substituted walnuts for the Brazil nuts. My husband and mother, both fruitcake fanatics, really enjoyed it...especially since it was homemade.

Liked it very much, but changed the nuts.  I don't like brazil nuts, so I put walnuts in.  I also made small cakes to give as gifts to my mail carrier, trash man, paper women and Schwan man.  I also printed out the recipe for them.   They were all excited.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but next time I will use a little less nuts and a citrus mix.

This really is the best fruitcake. I've tired with the regular recipe and pecans rather than brazil nuts; fantastic. Perfect blend of fruit with just enough cake to hold it together. I've also modified the recipe and used dried pineapple, papaya, shredded coconut with almonds for an Hawaiian flavor. The recipe is very forgiving of what kind of fruits and nuts to use, so go ahead and get creative. You will not be disappointed.

Best fruitcake ever!!! Never made one so easy and it came out perfect 2 hours ago and it's half eaten already.   I used pecans, Cherries and pineapple then I added a touch of cinnamon .   It was fantastic almost exactly like the Corsicana fruitcake company and those are 23.00 each.   I will make this for Christmas presents next year in little loaf pans.  Even if you don't like fruitcake just try this one with your favorite fruit. It is so healthy too!!!

This turned out to be more of a fruit and nut loaf for me, than a fruit cake. 

I was looking for a fruitcake recipe without alcohol for a teetotaler (she doesn't like to have the boozy flavors after the alcohol has cooked off). It turns out that there aren't very many, and I'm not an experienced enough baker to be comfortable just substituting out the alcohol. This recipe looked good and was highly rated.

It was easy to make. I did burn it a little--with so little cake I found it hard to figure out when my toothpick came out clean. The flavors combine well and it will definitely make a good sweet treat or trail food (although it is quite sticky), but I am still looking for that non-alcoholic fruit CAKE recipe.

I used a can of mixed nuts and left out the salt. Don't get excited and cut into it right away. It needs to sit at least 24 hours before you cut into it -- even longer if you can possibly resist. ;-)
