Very very yummy!!!  I made it for Christmas and it relatively easy- the only time
consuming thing was figuring out how many bananas equalled 2 cups and 
actually mashing the bananas (use approx. 5 med-large bananas and a potato
masher).  Otherwise, very easy to make.  Reminded me of one of my grand-
mother's cakes, but this was better!  I'll be passing it along!

Hummingbird cake started life as a spice cake with banana and pineapple. This cake was made more delicious by adding 1t cinnamon and 1t alspice. Also, to enhance the banana flavor I processed the bananas in a blender. For some reason this releases more banana flavor into the cake. This is a moist and rich treat!

This recipe is great.  Try replacing the oil with applesauce for a healthier version.  My family prefers the applesauce-version on taste alone.

This was a very, very yummy cake!  What a nice surprise.  I read about this cake in a culinary novel and wanted to try it.  I thought it would be a nice change from our traditional Easter carrot cake...and...it was!  I took some of the tips and added a half cup of shredded coconut to the batter.  I also added a middle layer of coconut, pineapple and sliced bananas on top of the icing.  I decorated the top with more shredded coconut and more chopped walnuts.  It was the hit of Easter and the day after...we had to remove it from the table so my cousin would stop eating it!  My only suggestion is to bake the cake at 325, not 350...that's too high.  The bottom and sides came out a bit darker than I'd like.  But it was still delish! Red Velvet move over...Hummingbird is becoming my new signature cake!

A  friend made it for my birthday.  Having gotten rather tired of Banana Nut Muffins (too fake tasting), I was delighted at how good this cake is. She did press nuts into the frosting.  It was HEAVEN, and we will make it again.  Very fresh banana taste, very moist, and no big wet pineapple chunks. Blended right in.

This cake was very good. I did make changes, so if you're a purist, read no further..I used 4 very soft, overripe bananas, and a large can of crushed pineapple that I thoroughly DRAINED and used paper towels to get out the remaining juice. I also used a teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to give it some interest.  I did not cover it in the cream cheese frosting, but instead made a drizzle of 4 T butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and about a cup of confectionary sugar. I sprinkled chopped pecans over the top of the drizzled cake. It was excellent. In fact, if you and your family can wait, I suggest letting it sit for a couple of days (mine is in a domed cake plate) as it gets even better with age (a lot like banana bread). I will definately be using this slightly modified recipe again and again, as only half of my family will eat bananas, but not a one had trouble gobbling up this cake!!! try it out!

THIS IS A VERY DESIRABLE CAKE AT ALL OF OUR CHURCH SUPPERS AND HOMECOMINGS. EVERYONE WANTS THE RECIPE. USE VERY RIPE BANANAS IN THE CAKE. RIPE BANANAS ARE SWEETER. YOU CAN ALSO BAKE THE CAKE IN A LOAF PAN FOR HAWAIIAN BANANA BREAD. YOU CAN GLAZE THE LOAF OR NOT,IT'S YOUR CHOICE. VERY DELECTABLE AND G-O-O-D.

I usually bake this in a tube pan and I add a dash of cinnamon to the batter.  Pre-made cream cheese frosting works well with this cake.  It is delicious!

This is an old, old recipe....originally called Bird Cake or Dr. Bird cake.  The original recipe is exactly the same but with 1 cup of oil instead.  I make mine in a 9 x 13 inch pan or I make Bird Bread in loaf pans.

I tried other viewers suggestions to cut down on the oil which now I wish I hadn't. It wasn't as moist as I'd hoped for. Will follow the recipe as written next time I make it and hope for moistness.

I had made this a few years ago and loves it but using this recipe it tasted like a really good bananna bread with frosting.  Not a bad recipe at all just not what I was aiming for.

I loved it with my changes:  only 1 cup of oil, added a teaspoon of cinnamon, and did not drain the crushed pineapple. Also, toast the walnuts first!  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract to the frosting. 
This is the tastiest, moistest (is that a word?) cake ever!!!

This cake is wonderful!  We don't care for walnuts so I added pecans and an extra package of cream cheese to the frosting....To die for!

Everybody at my home loves this cake.  It's a bit of my "go to" cake since it's so easy to put together, and I generally have all the ingredients on hand.  I do tweak it a bit with two small changes.  First, I use vegetable oil instead of the canola and cut the oil back to 1 cup.  We just like the flavor the vegetable oil gives verses the canola. Secondly, I use a 20 oz can of crused pineapple UNDRAINED. This makes a fairly dense cake, but super moist. Comes out beautifully every time. Happy Baking!!

VERY moist cake, simple to make, tastes very good but the banana is the primary flavor, I was hoping the pineapple and coconut (I added) would be the focus and the banana would be a background flavor. I changed the recipe some but will tweak it again next time I make it to try to perfect my idea of what hummingbird cake should be. I keep uneaten bananas (I call them baking bananas) in my freezer, defrosted 3 of them which came out to about 1 cup of banana mash - would use 2 baking bananas next time. I did not drain my pineapple (8 oz crushed), next time I would use a 10 or 12 oz can as I was hoping it would stand out a little more. I added I cup of shredded coconut (will use a little more next time 1.5 cups maybe). I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 3/4 cups packed brown sugar and vegetable oil as I was out of applesauce but I would probably still use some/mostly oil because it makes it so moist. I also added a generous splash of vanilla and about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I baked everything at 325 degrees in dark, non-stick Baking Pam'd pans: 2 mini bunt cakes (single serving/large cupcake size) for 32 minutes, 5 regular cupcakes for 26 minutes both are so moist I may not frost them and serve them to my boys for breakfast! I put the remainder of the cake in a 13x9 and baked it a total of 1 hour, it looks dark on top but still feels moist, I won't know if it's overdone until tomorrow. I would use this as a banana bread recipe, still trying to perfect my version, not a failure.

Fantastic cake mmm! I followed everything exactly except I used whole wheat flour, and added 1/2 cup shredded coconut to the mixture. It came out moist and delicious, not overly banana-bread-ish like people have said. To cut calories use apple sauce instead of vegetable oil or use a "better" oil such as olive oil. Will make again!

Wonderful 5-star cake with no need to change a thing unless you really want to.  

I made a bundt cake instead of the layered cake and used ~10oz of pineapple tidbits and 3 bananas (I didn't want to use all of the bananas I had on hand).

FYI: 2c. Mashed banana = ~4  bananas.

Very lush and yummy. 

A bit of a hassle mashing bananas, crushing pineapple and chopping nuts but well worth the result as co-workers love the result.

Thanks for sharing

Made for Kay Lyn's birthday.  Turned out great.  Used a little pineapple juice in the frosting and sprinkled the sides with coconut and then the top got finely chopped pecans.  Looks like it came from the Cheesecake factory and would cost at least $5 dollars a serving.  Very impressive.

DELICIOUS!!!! I had to cut the oil 3/4 C. Oil, 3/4 C. Applesauce for Heath reasons.  And I used the juice and all from the pineapple. SUPER MOIST. I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar "generously" on top of cake before baking. I made an orange flavored cream cheese frosting as a filler, and decorated with "Rick's special buttercream" cutting the sugar by 1 1/2 cups. The flavor combination is amazing. Thanks for the recipe!!! Oh, I baked in 9" round pans at 325* for about 50-55 min

Made exact to recipe, and it was so/so.  Kind of bland.  Made again and added 1 tsp cinnamin, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 2 tsp vanilla.  What a big difference.  Delicious.

I was not impressed with this cake. It had more of a banana bread taste and texture than a cake. The ingredients like the banana,pineapple and pecans go great on a store bought yellow cake mix.

This recipe worked out quite well, and was very easy to make. That said, all of you who commented before comparing this to banana bread are 100% spot-on. This is an elevated, super-moist, fluffy and sweet banana bread with cream cheese frosting- not that there's anything wrong with that! I will feel less guilty eating it for breakfast tomorrow. The recipe as written does not call for cinnamon and/or nutmeg, so I added a pinch of each. People with more distinguished tastebuds than I can decide whether that helps. Also I used vegetable oil instead of canola, which I think made it slightly crispy on the outside (YUM!) and baked it in the oven next to a shallow dish full of water while listening to David Bowie's Lodger, which I think was a positive influence on the dish.

I added some cardamom, cinnamon and allspice to mine and only used banana because I didn't want it to come out tasting like a banana nut bread with extra flavors added to it and I'm happy I did; the banana flavor was nice and blended with the other flavors well, not dominating as I feared 2 mashed bananas would be. I looked up some of the history of this cake and a lot of people claim that originally it was a kind of spice cake so that's another reason why I added them. I used pecans instead of walnuts this time, and overall it was a really delicious cake. I folded the egg whites in at the end as well. Overall, it's a pretty decadent cake, it's one of those that you bake to kind of impress people, not really because you're craving it so bad. It's not my favorite sort of dessert. I like my desserts a little bit simpler, but I just wanted to try this. If the opportunity comes up I would make this cake again.

I made this for a Sunday dinner and everyone raved over it! Even people who normally aren't "dessert" people, took pieces when urged by everyone else...and they ended up eating every bite and saying it was awesome! Will definitely make again. I didn't change a thing - great recipe!

What a rich and beautiful cake. I made a 2 layer cake. There was plenty of icing to ice in between the layers and all around. I put some chopped walnuts , just on the top and it was really pretty. It impressed my dinner guests. Everyone loved it and I can't wait to make it again. I may try it with half splenda next time to save a few calories.

Excellent without the frosting.  Kind of like a banana bread.  Make in small bundt pans, add powdered sugar and cherries.

Hummingbird cake is new to me. Sounded so good, thought I would give it a try. One of the best we've had in a long while. It's a cousin of carrot cake. Very easy, well writen recipe. Followed the recipe up to the nuts,(Hubby can't eat them) I used coconut. It may be better with nuts or maybe both. I baked for 50 min, watch not to over bake. Very moist and serves at least 12. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe.

This cake is moist and flavorful. The only changes I made were to add 1 cup of coconut, 1 tbsp. rum, and I roasted the bananas in the oven with a slight topping of brown sugar. Roasting the bananas this way enhances the flavor.

I made this using a yellow cake mix and then the fruit and eggs like suggested.  Followed the icing recipe as directed.  This was requested by a friend for her baby shower and while it isn't my kind of dessert(I'm a chocolate girl!), it was still very good to me and got raves by everyone else.

Very good. I will have to agree with some other reviews, though. This does taste an awful lot like banana nut bread with icing. However, it is wonderful. I used pecans instead of walnuts and added some to the icing. Overall a good recipe.

Made this for my daughter's sweet 16 and it was a big hit. I read several Hummingbird cake recipes and ended up making a few adjustments to this recipe. So many recipes said to not drain the pineapple and add less oil, others said to drain it like this one does. I drained the pineapple juice into a measuring cup and then added oil to that to make the original 1 and 1/2 cups of liquid. I also added a touch of vanilla and some cinnamon and allspice. I topped it with colored coconut flakes to make it festive.

Great cake!  I liked the retro sound of this, had the ingredients on hand, and needed to make a cake for a birthday at work. It was a HUGE hit!  Everyone loved it!  It is very dense and moist, but in such a good way.  And the frosting is the best (and simplest!) recipe for Cream Cheese Frosting that I've come across yet - that by itself is a keeper!
I did make some adjustments as suggested by other reviews:  1) I used a large can of crushed pineapple, well drained.  2) I used 1 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  (I will increase this ratio to 1:1 next time) 3) I baked it in a 9x13" metal pan ... preheated the oven to 350 degrees, then reduced the temp to 335 degrees after putting the cake into the oven, baked for about 70 minutes.  It came out perfect! The batter comes pretty far up the pan, but doesn't rise very much so don't worry about it going over. 4)  I baked it a full day in advance, letting the cake rest, unfrosted, overnight.  The cake tasted best on the 3rd day.   
Definitely a keeper - and it may, as someone else suggested, replace my usual Carrot Cakes at the church bake sale this year!

I followed this recipe exactly. This cake does NOT need 1 hour in the oven. I checked it at 40 minutes and it was already way past done.  I'd recommended checking the cake at 30 minutes.

I replaced 1 of the cups of oil with applesauce. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and about 3/4 cups of coconut. I cooked it for about 65 minutes at 325 degrees. It was delicious! My sneaky dog ate one of the layers while they were cooling, so I guess it was a hit with her, too! (The dog is okay.)

Used 1/3 of the recipe and made hummingbird cupcakes. Also added some vanilla, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg and some shredded baking coconut to the batter. Fun to assemble the cupcakes (baked for 20 min at 350C): cut them in half like a mini two-layer cake, iced the middle and top of the cupcake, added ground toasted walnuts and some shredded baking coconut to the icing. One-third of the recipe makes about 15 cupcakes.

It was ok, but basically tasted like a glorified banana bread. I'll make it again, but I'll use the other suggestions and add some coconut...maybe some marachino cherries.

It turned out like banana bread with frosting, but it was still pretty good. Don't skimp on the frosting though if you are looking for more of a cake. Also I'd use more pineapple next time.

Followed the recipe except: I mashed the bananas in a food processor and added fresh pineapple to that and pureed it all together. I baked it in a full sheet cake pan and it only need about 45-50 minutes at 350. Great texture and flavor!  Thanks for getting me outside the basic cake box!

I have made this exact recipe for years, accept for the black walnuts, I like English. I bought this generic cream cheese and froze it. When I made the icing it was grainy, so don't use cheap cream cheese. I am going to make this cake in loaf pans without the icing and pretend it's banana bread. I can't find a good banana bread recipe so will try this as one, I think it'll pass. It is so moist, it's my favorite to make and to eat. Thanks!

The first time I made this was after my boyfriend had asked that I try something other than traditional vanilla or chocolate cake.  I came across this recipe and knew I had to try it because it sounded as if it was created for him.  To my delight, he loved it and couldn't stop telling people about it as if they'd never heard of cake before!  So many thanks to MARBALET for posting this particular recipe as I get ready to make it once again for my boyfriend's birthday tomorrow.

I made this cake for MIL's 90th birthday party.  It was hit!  The first of three cakes to be eaten.  Very yummy.  Very east to prepare.  I had frozen some uneaten bananas and used them in this recipie.

Very good recipe.  Comes together quickly. I cut the white sugar to one cup and didn't miss it a bit. Black walnuts are hard to find in my area so I used chopped pecans.

This cake is excellent.  I made it for my in laws and they said it was "the best cake they'd ever had"!  It tastes like an amped up banana bread- very dense, but moist and full of flavor.  It's very easy to make.  Next time I will try toasting the walnuts a little bit first, but they were great straight out of the bag.  Will definitely have this as a go-to from now on.

I have made this cake and taken it to three covered dish dinners and it simply disappears! Everyone raves about it. It is so very moist and flavorful every time without fail. I use toasted almonds due to a pecan allergy and it is still delicious

Received many compliments on this delicious moist cake. 
I did not added the nuts because of a guest’s allergies. Otherwise made following the recipe. 
Definitely will be making again.

Let me preface by saying I made this exactly per the recipe. Made no changes. My reaction? Eh. It ended up pretty dry which surprised me seeing as it has so much oil in it. And the taste wasnt much to write home about. It tasted like a sweeter banana bread, just in cake form. The pineapple practically disappeared in the cake. I'm not sure what it added to it. The walnuts were odd, I think pecans would be a better option. Over all, I wont be using this recipe again.

Very tasty! Absolute keeper of a recipe. Moist and flavorful. I substituted 1 cup of banana mash for sour cream because I was low on bananas. Be sure to wait till cake is entirely cool before frosting.

This cake was fabulous! 
I did use a mix of olive oil and melted unrefined coconut oil for that coconut taste and will use only coconut oil next time and want to substitute in a half cup of applesauce instead of oil.  One hour at 350 was too much, I pulled them out at 45 minutes and they were a little tough on the outside and too brown so I will be trying 325 instead like someone else suggested.  This is a total keeper and is going in my recipe journal! Love!

I tweaked the recipe because I didn’t have canola oil and used Soya bean oil instead. I used less about 3/4 cup banana and 1/3 cup of walnuts. Made a butter frosting instead of cream cheese. The texture of this cake was good and it was moist. I’ll definitely try this version again with the tweaks. I’ve tried making it using butter and the texture was different- a little drier. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the flour mixture and 1 tsp of vanilla essence to the egg and oil mixture.

Delicious cake.  Worthy of a place in my recipe box.  I did substitute coconut oil (melted) for the canola oil, only because I like the taste of coconut oil.  The black walnuts add a special taste that I love.  Thanks for the recipe.

I like this cake so much . I have been baking it for forty years and it is always a hit with everyone except my husband. I can’t understand why except that he dislikes nuts in his dessert. I cannot find an 8 oz can of crushed pineapple anywhere. I bought a larger can and weighed out the appropriate weight. Worked fine. This is my favorite cake ever. Never disappoints and I always bring it to parties as it feeds a crowd.
Yum ??

This cake is delicious and easy to make! You can’t go wrong with cream cheese frosting either. Be sure the pineapple is drained really well. I? used about 4 large bananas to make 2 cups. Enjoy!

This is a wonderful and easy cake.  I like it with the traditional pecans. It is basically a fancy, frosted banana bread.  It is very dense and travels or ships well when it is unfrosted.  I have sent it as a fun package to my daughter at college with an unopened can of frosting to assemble on arrival.  The homemade frosting is delicious when I make it at home.

Good and moist but disappointed I couldn’t taste the pineapple at all. Tasted like a very good banana cake.

Great cake! I bake for a local café and customers loved it, almost all gone the first day! I added a little orange juice to the icing and gave it great complimenting flavor.

These is a good banana bread but I wasn't impressed with it as a cake. I ended up filling the two layers with a strawberry coulis and adding maple syrup to the frosting and that perked it up a bit. Watch the bake time. Mine was bordering on overdone at the listed baking time.

This cake has become a family favourite for birthdays. I added one cup of coconut to make it more "tropical".  I diced the bananas instead of mashing them and added a tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. I also halved the amount of sugar and it still was wonderful.  I baked it in two 9" rounds and it only took 25-30 minutes, not the hour on the recipe.Can't wait for the next one!

We have made this once before and loved it both times.  We stuck to the recipe, except the frosting.  To it, we added pineapple juice, lemon rind and extra vanilla.  It was fully cooked after 45 mins, not an hour.  It was very moist.

The cake recipe itself is good, though I might replace some of the oil with butter and/or buttermilk next time, as I have seen other recipes for this cake using those. 

I would also make about 50% more icing than this recipe yields, because the amount this makes was barely enough for me to cover the cake, and nobody's day is made worse by having a little extra cream cheese icing around. I also only used about half the amount of confectioners sugar called for, and it tastes plenty sweet to me. 

Overall, good recipe, would make again.

Density overload, moist through day 5 and flavor through the roof.  We made this at the beach house in a 9x13, stuck it in the fridge and it served our 6 hungry adult souls almost the entire week! We ate it as a dessert when looking for something sweet, a snack when just looking to grab n go and as breakfast to get the day moving. 
I've been in the south before,  had never heard of this infamous cake till now.  this was my first time making and/or eating it so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like,  I can only tell you that this recipe is excellent. 
crowd pleaser! thanks for the share!

I have to agree with Jamie.  This is  banana bread recipe.  A good recipe but banana bread with frosting none the less.  I made these as cupcakes and they rose beautifully but you don't get that sticky nectar feeling you'd expect from a hummingbird cake.  I also used cinnamon cream cheese frosting to try to jazz it up a bit.  A little orange zest and honey will go a long way here.  Next time I'll increase the pineapple substantially as well.  Compared to my banana bread it excels and will be used in the future as such.  Compared to the holiday desserts it is categorized with, it falls flat in flavor, texture, and attractiveness.

Loved it WITH a few additional tweaks! Stole ideas from a couple of genius reviewers - add a teaspoon of cinnamon and a 1/2 cup coconut to cake batter, brilliant! Additionally, I found the icing to be waaaay to sweet, so I doubled the cream cheese, and got RAVE reviews! Also, it makes for a fairly dense cake, almost like banana bread, so I found that initially I didn't use enough frosting - in the future, I won't be shy with that cream cheesy goodness!

I add 1 tsp cinnamon and a splash of vanilla to the batter.  I also use 1 cup coconut oil and 1/2 cup applesauce (one little single serving container)  instead of canola oil.  Great unfrosted in a loaf or bundt pan for a quick breakfast, or frosted with the cream cheese icing  as written for dessert.  Our family doesn't like overripe bananas, so when they start to go a little too far on the counter, I toss them in the freezer.  When I get four or five, it's time to make the cake!

This is quite dense although it still rises quite a bit (filled the mini bundt cake moulds 3/4 full).  My family doesn't like stuff too sweet, so I made the following adjustments:
- cut down the sugar to 2/3
- cut down the oil to 1-1/4 cups
- used waaaaay more pineapple (undrained) than recipe called for, yet still didn't see much pineapple....
- you have to use waaaaay more mashed banana than you think you would
- skipped the walnut as we were sharing the cakes with potentially nut-allergic people

I added the cinnamon and allspice as suggested.  Next time I'll try nutmeg instead of the allspice.  It was very good and I'll make it again.  I used store bought cream cheese frosting instead of making it from scratch.

I made this cake for Easter, and everyone really like it.  It was super moist and very easy to make.  It seemed to lack some flavor though.  To make this cake even better next time, I'd add some cinnamon to it, make sure the bananas were super ripe and add a little more vanilla to the frosting (or even a splash of almond extract).  I would definitely make again!!

Made it exactly as written, except I used pecans instead of walnuts. Easy and delicious. Taste more like banana the longer it sits.

I substituted 1/2 the oil with applesauce, and baked it as cupcakes instead of a layer cake.  I didn't want too many so I reduced the recipe by 1/3 and got 19 cupcakes. I used 1&1/2 bananas for this amount. It came out beautiful and delicious! Definitely a keeper.

Tastes like a fancy banana bread cake. Very yummy, but very rich. I actually followed the directions (unusual for me) and I had no problems.

I'm impressed! I used 9 inch non-stick pans so I lowered temp by 25 degrees plus an additional 15 degrees and it cooked perfectly in an hour. An excellent birthday cake alternative to chocolate cake but we did have double dark chocolate gelato with it. Delicious!!!!

I never had hummingbird cake till I tried it at a restaurant. My family and I loved it, so I had to try and make some of this cake. It was very good. In the cake I added crushed and dry pineapple also I added pecans. It was very good and  I will probably make it again soon.

Great cake recipe - moist and delish! used equal parts brown/white sugar, substituted 8 TBSP butter for oil in cake, only used 4TBSP butter in frosting, didn't use any nuts (added 1/2 tsp almond extract), added pineapple & lemon zest to my frosting and garnished with pineapple & fresh mint - paired with a Mionetto  Brut Prosecco DOC Treviso

I only gave it 4 stars because it was not a quick recipe. I made this for my Dad's 85 birthday using all organic ingredients and it was PHENOMINAL tasting, but it took me the better part of an entire day to make/build. I swore I'd never do it again, but here I am two years later, getting ready to fight my way through another creation, just on a smaller scale but still organic. I'm sure it will be another hit. Oh and I used pecans instead of walnuts, they made the most wonderfully subtle companion to the bananas and pineapple...

Wanted to LOVE it, but it was way overcooked. Do NOT BAKE for ONE HOUR!!! I checked mine at 45 minutes and it was close to burnt. (At 350 in 2 professional grade 9" round springform pans.) With that said, I'm dying to try this again. My family loved it!!  I only changed one thing, I substituted 1 cup of flour with coconut flour. 
My mom doesn't like pineapple and my dad doesn't like coconut but they both asked for the recipe =)

Was going through a baking urge and chose this to make one night for dessert. I did make a few changes though, I didn't drain the pineapple, used pecans and I used a store bought cream cheese icing (didn't want to make a trip to the store and had the frosting already). I must say that the cake is good, not great. While, I love banana bread, I was expecting this would not be so similar to it. If I ever made this again I would probably tweek it even further by using LESS banana, probably a cup vs the two and I would probably haul my butt to the store to get the ingredients for the frosting because the store bought stuff has a bit of an artificial taste to it. If you LOVE banana bread then you will love this recipe.

Is it a good cake? Yes, moist and sweet and everything you want in a scratch cake. It's easy to make too. Just be prepared that the dominant flavor is banana. It could easily be called banana cake. I followed the recipe exactly. Pineapple was in there somewhere but you couldn't taste it. Just banana.

The cake came out delicious.  It will be five stars next time with the following tweaks.  I found cooking it the full hour made it a little dry so next time I'll cut back to 50min.  I also added 1tsp Cinnamon and 1tsp Vanilla and I think that really made it extra delicious, wouldn't have been so good without it.  Brought it into the office and all my coworkers loved it.  Otherwise a great cake I'll make again!

I absolutely loved how moist this cake came out to be. I want to add maybe raisins and grated carrot next time. Although I also added vanilla to the cake mix, I think I added too much to the icing because it was not as thick as a store-brought version, but it definitely had a richer flavor.
