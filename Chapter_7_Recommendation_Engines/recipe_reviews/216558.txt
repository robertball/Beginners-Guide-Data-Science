This looks awesome, but are the jalapeno and banana peppers fresh or canned/pickled?

Made it as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! However, I did add a little more mayo than what the recipe says and the flavor is much better when you make it the day before and let it sit overnight.

I LOVE this recipe!  I often don't serve it in the cabbage.  My husband is doing the low carb thing, so eats it with celery.  Not as good as Frito Scoops or a nice cracker, but he enjoys it.  I like it spicy so I always add more jalapeno.  You must let it refrigerator for several hours to let the flavors all meld together well.  Yum!!!  Wherever I take this recipe, people beg me for the recipe!

Five stars from the LTH family!  I made this for our niece's 8th birthday party and it was a HUGE hit, with most everyone.   Those that have sensitivities to spicy foods were not as big of fans as the rest of us.  I followed the recipe with a few minor tweaks:  I wasn't sure how many ounces were a pound (and I'm totally ok w/admitting that) so I used 16 oz of shredded Swiss, I used canned diced jalaps, and I'm not a mayo fan so I used 1/2 mayo w/EVOO and 1/2 FF sour cream.  Great stuff!  My grocery store didn't have a red cabbage, so I had to use a (pricy!) green cabbage.  If presentation is a MUST, I'll keep the cabbage.  If not, I'll save the $ and use a pretty serving dish.  TY for an interesting change of pace appetizer, NKW!

I spotted this on the Buzz the other day and decided to make it to snack on during the football game today.  Go Bucks!  I just made the cheese mixture and didn’t serve it in the head of cabbage.  Frankly I wasn’t wild about this one.  I think Hubs enjoyed it more than I did.  However in fairness to the recipe, I may not have let the flavors meld long enough.  I will taste the leftovers tomorrow to see if the flavors have improved and update my review if necessary.

Followed the recipe as written minus the cabbage head. I did let it sit/settle as advised.  The majority liked it and some raved about how great it was, I and a few others didn't care for it, I'm not a big fan of swiss cheese, so maybe thats why I didn't like it.

Love this dip! So delicious! 2nd time I made it I had a little leftover bacon, so I crumbled that up too... either way, it's great! I'll be making it frequently!

This is my stand by! Love this  spread!  I took it to a tailgate and the kids were putting it on their burgers.  I usually don't use the cabbage.  Serve with fritos, celery, mini peppers.  It's always a hit!! Make it with jarred banana peppers and either jarred or fresh jalapenos.  Just a note to the creator,  it's hard to find it in the search bar on this website.

Warning: It's addicting! I made this the night before to go with dinner. We could not stop eating it. I did serve it with corn chips, but we also found it great to eat as a side with a fork. Made this exactly and it was super yummy! Will make again!

I changed this quite a bit. I don't like swiss cheese so I used mozzarella. My boyfriend doesn't like onions so  I left it out. I also did not serve it in the cabbage. I did let it sit overnight to blend though. Everyone including me seemed to think it was just okay. I probably won't make it again.
