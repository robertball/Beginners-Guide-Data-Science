I was looking for a "clean out the fridge" recipe, hoping to use a half a bag of frozen edamame and found this, which also helped me use up some radishes, carrots and a red bell pepper.  I had most of the ingredients on hand, except the corn and water chestnuts, so I subbed the other veggies mentioned.  It came out really well - crunchy, colorful, and really light and fresh.  I would make this again. Great side dish and a healthy option for a summer pot luck.

I substituted olive oil for sesame oil, and I used dried ginger instead of fresh (which would have been better). I hate radishes, so didn't use them, but put in some red bell pepper for color. The first time I was in a rush and forgot the cilantro and green onions, and it was still yummy. Very forgiving recipe.

Awesome recipe with great flavor and texture! It seems like there is not enough dressing for the big bowl of edamame, but it is actually a perfect amount and adds the right amount flavor to the crunchy mix. I omitted the green onions and cilantro and substituted (half of a) yellow onion for green onion and regular canned corn for the baby corn.

I added fresh kale to my salad and omitted the water chestnuts. I used toasted sesame oil vs regular sesame oil.

Seriously good!!  This is really fresh and tasty.  My husband doesn't like cooked veggies, so I am constantly trying to figure out different ways to serve fresh veggies.  I saw a recipe for Oriental meatballs on another site and knew I needed a side dish.  My 5 yr old daughter didn't care for it...but she doesn't like much of anything...except she loved the meatballs:-) (http://family.go.com/food/recipe-819870-chinese-style-turkey-meatballs-t/)   

I did everything as directed, except I used julienned carrots and omitted the water chestnuts and baby corn.

This was just ok.  The taste of the canned corn was too evident - but it had potential.  Maybe next time I will just cut freshly cooked corn off the cob and use that.  It also needed a bit more taste - will try adding some heat with some jalapeno peppers or something.  Will resubmit my review if I try again.

Edit:  tried again with some changes and it was much better.  Used frozen corn that was lightly cooked, then drained.  Much better taste.  Didn't have cilantro on hand and used sliced celery instead of waterchestnuts for the crunch.  Added some lightly toasted almonds to top the salad.

Made this with immaterial substitutions, really liked it. Might benefit from some freshly chopped hot peppers, but nice as-is.

dressing was okay, not as flavorful as I'd hoped.  I think if I make it again it'll be without the corn.

Great recipe! Per personal taste, I added carrot and celery and took out the babycorn. Fresh and bright- a great addition to lots of meals!

Made this recipe for my wife.  She absolutely loved it for its crunchy texture and fresh, unique flavor.  Apparently I'll be making it a lot more! :)

Fantastic easy salad that is great for a potluck.  Can be made gluten free.   I didn't have fresh ginger on hand so used a tsp of powdered ginger.

Absolutely refreshing and tasty.  The combination of salt, sweet, crunch and soft is quite satisfying.

Love this salad. All sorts of different textures and subtle flavors that blend together perfectly. (Next time I'll use fresh edamame instead of frozen though.) I'm bringing this to my next family get together. I think it's going to be a hit!

I have been looking for recipes with edamame and thought this one sounded good. Did not have any almonds so I added toasted sunflower seeds instead. Very GOOD! Thanks!

This was great!  A nice blend of flavors.  Easy, cheap, and healthy.  Am going to make more tonight!  I added some red quinoa which worked out nicely.

Excellent ! Made a few changes by accident. I got two recipes mixed so I added two cans of Cannellini beans before I realized that was a different recipe. I continued with this recipe omitting the corn & sesame oil since I didn't have any. Turned out excellent. Because of the added beans I had to add another bag of veg which were a mix of edamame and other veg so it turned out huge. I only increased the sauces. I served it over Couscous along side of the Asian Style Country Ribs which were unbelievable. Thanks for sharing. YUMMY !

Seriously good! And my husband loves it.  For me, that's the test.  He has to love it.  The one change that I made is that I used fresh, raw corn off the cob, because it's in season.  Fantastic.  When corn isn't in season, I'll use the frozen.  Thanks for a great recipe.

We served this with brown rice and the flavors were so delicious. I really liked the cilantro and onion with the edamame and radishes. It was just what we were craving after eating not so well for a few days.
