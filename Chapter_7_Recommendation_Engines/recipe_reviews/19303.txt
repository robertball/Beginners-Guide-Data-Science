It even smells funny when you mix it up but this is sooooo good! I browned turkey polish sausage first and then blotted the grease off with paper towels. I used Campbells Healthy Request for the condensed soups but it didn't taste low fat! Very tasty husband and daughter loved it! And we do have refined palates but we're not too proud to enjoy "comfort" foods now and then.

This was kind of odd it's true but it tasted good and my 3-year-old liked it. It's kind of gloppy and strange and I wouldn't serve it to company or anything but it was easy tasty and I always have these ingredients on hand so I've made it a few times!

I was not quite sure about this but needed a quick kielbasa recipe. Normally I shy away from casseroles that require 2 cans of condensed soup but for some reason this one overcame my misgivings and I made it tonight. It was really good! My husband loved it! My kids...well they are really picky and don't like sauce on pasta so they didn't care for it but it has a mild flavor and tastes very cheesey so most kids should really love it. I kept back about 1/2 cup of the cheese and put it on top. I definitely will make this one again.

Yummy! Not what I expected! I did use mild Italian sausage which added a bit of zing! My husband went back for seconds and was happy there were leftovers for him to take to work!

I liked the pasta and sauce much more than I thought but the kielbasa tasted out of place. I had browned it in garlic and had to keep my husband from eating it as I waited for the pasta to cook. He didn't like it as much in the pasta. I think I might try it with chicken. Would be easy with the pre-cooked grilled chicken. This would make a good dish for leftover turkey. I also used cavatappi pasta as I couldn't imagine it with spaghetti. I sprinked some dried onion in with the soup mixture as well.

I like this recipe with a couple of alterations...I too sauteed the kielbasa and then added one clove of garlic towards the end. I substituted one jar of spaghetti sauce for the tomato soup and used penne pasta and a little less cheese.

I would say those that did not give it 5 stars was because they did not like kielbasa sausage. But it is a favorite here and we loved it! I did not have tomato soup so after i put the cream of mushroom in I put a small amount of ketchup in the can and the rest of it water. And I did not have 2 cups shredded cheese so I used one cup and one cup mozz. cheese. I know that my grandchildren and sister would love it because they love kielbasa sausage along with us. So I suggest you don't try it and give it bad reviews if you do not like it. Thanks Laurie!!!!!

The only one that ate it was the one-year old. Probably because it tastes exactly like chef boyrdee. The older kids had seconds on salad and garlic bread because this was so bad.

We all loved this! I made it just as it's written too - well except for mixing in half the cheese and using the rest to put on top. And we only baked it for 20 minutes (oh ya I had sauteed the cut up kielbasa with a little onion & garlic first) because everything was already cooked. We will have this again!

Very easy and quick Tasted nothing like spaghetti-o's like some other reviewers mentioned although it did smell like them before baking. Used Fettuccine instead of spaghetti and added about 1/2C of extra cheese on top. Great taste even my 2yr old loved it!

Really awful. This recipe is only for families who enjoy spaghettios or other similar recipes. No one would even touch it!

Not very exciting. It may have been because I used cream of celery (didn't have mushroom). The 1 yr old in the family liked it but the 7 and 5 yr olds didn't (and they like chef boyardee).

I really didn't enjoy this recipe. My boyfriend thought it was okay but it was way too bland for me even though I added some garlic and a little cayenne pepper. I agree with the other reviewer it definitely reminded me of spaghetti oh's. I won't be making this one again.

Not bad. Was quick and easy taste was "good". Not for a fancy palate I'm sure but a nice little weekday dinner. Try it with some parmesan on top.;o)

This was good not phenomenal. Like others recommended I sauteed the kielbasa with onion and garlic before mixing with the other ingredients.

We love this!  I've used kielbasa, smoked sausage, hot dogs and turkey dogs, depending on what I have in the freezer. I use at least 6 oz of cheddar, and mix it all in. None on top. Double the soup so it's nice and juicy. Cover with foil.
