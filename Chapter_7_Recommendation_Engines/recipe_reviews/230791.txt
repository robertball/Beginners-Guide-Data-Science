I've made this recipe several times and it is always a hit.  The recipe, as stated is perfect, but I've used whatever cheese and vegetables I have on hand.  If I'm using cheddar I often add Sriracha instead of the rosemary.  It is also great with a little bacon or ham added.  It is my "go to" for breakfast.  It is also delicious heated up the next day.

We didn't have a leek so we used some red onion instead.  This is a wonderfully tasty recipe.  Tried it out on guests and the loved it as well.  It was gone in one sitting with just the four of us (and I doubled the recipe!).

Made this for a light, late dinner last night and it was perfect.  I baked it in a pie crust and it was very tasty.  The rosemary made it smell yummy and the tomatoes gave it a nice punch of flavor.  My husband really liked it (he put Tobasco sauce on it - loves the stuff).  It's a good idea to let it sit for a few minutes before cutting into it so everything can set and not be too messy when you cut into it.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a nice departure from my regular quiche, using fresh kale, tomatoes and rosemary from my garden made it more special and I served it as a main dish for dinner.  I did make a pie crust that called for dried basil which gave an extra layer of flavor and I only used 3/4 cup milk then baked it at 400 degrees for 30 minutes in my small convection oven.   Turned out great, I will definitely be making this again!

True confession: I made this only because my co-op share included leeks and kale, both of which I wanted to figure out how to use up. This recipe (I made it as a true quiche, in a crust) is AMAZING! The rosemary provides the balance and counterpoint that merges these assertive flavors into a delicious whole. Bring on the kale!

I made this for dinner, and my one year olds loved it! So did my husband and I, but I was thrilled that my kids ate it. I upped it a little for a 9" pie plate and used swiss chard instead of kale.

Made this for a retreat brunch, so delicious!! I used a frozen pie shell, thawed for a bit, spinach instead of kale. Yummy! There was only 1 slice left, and I'm about to eat it for dinner!! Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

It came out really good. I ended up sautéing the kale with a little bit of water and about 2 tbsp of butter (I added a little more kale than what it called for) and added some mrs. dash garlic and and herb seasoning  then added my leaks stirred that up for a couple minutes then added the tomatoes last I used grape tomatoes because that’s what I had at home I also substituted fresh rosemary for dried because that’s what I had. I did one more change and that was using half and half instead of just regular milk.

This is a great basis for any kind of quiche.  I keep adding different greens—Swiss chard, mild Chinese cabbage—and other veggies—like different varieties of mushrooms.  Plus I use up different cheeses for a new taste.  Super recipe!

I'm always leery of putting tomatoes in a quiche because they add so much liquid. Indeed, when I pulled this out of the oven after nearly an hour, there was still liquid in the middle. The flavor of the quiche overall was good, but I found the kale a bit tough.

Although simple I found this to be a delicious recipe and didn’t change anything except I had about 1/4 cup of heavy cream I had to use up and added it and decreased the milk to 3/4 cup.

I didn’t have any kale, but did have fresh baby spinach.  Made the process so much easier - didn’t have to steam anything first.  This was absolutely delicious and so easy!

I used Cheddar cheese, Roma tomatoes, and scallions instead of leeks.  The quiche was delicious.  My family is not a fan of kale, but it comes with the vegetables we order, so this will be made again!

I closely followed the original recipe; but next time I would make these changes: I did use cherry tomatoes, but next time I would use just thinly sliced tomatoes to decorate the top. The cherry tomatoes were too juicy. I would also cut the amount of milk to 3/4 cup as I thought the quiche was too runny although I let it set after coming out of the oven. I made this with fresh kale which I microwaved and drained thoroughly instead of steaming over boiling water.
It is a very good basic recipe to which you could add ham, bacon, or more veggies. I'll definitely make it again!

I love this recipe!!  It’s a hit with my husband as well.  I just made it again yesterday and realized I need to make it more often.  There is a ton of flavor in the dish thanks to the leek and fresh rosemary.  Relatively healthy due to the fact there is no crust and little cheese is needed due to the fact the veggies are incredibly yummy.

I've used this recipe as a sort of template--so much oniony stuff, green stuff, red stuff, milky stuff, etc.  I've also found that I can put this quiche in the oven on 350 for 5 to 10 minutes, then turn the oven off and run errands. It doesn't really matter whether I take it out an hour or an hour and a half later. Thank you!

This quiche was delish and easy!  I used a ready-made pie crust which I pre-baked for 10 min at 425 deg, then took it out, reduced the oven to 350 deg. , added the quiche ingredients and baked per the recipe instructions here.  No soggy crust due to the pre-baking.  I'll make it again.

Really delicious and easy quiche that I will definitely make again. I put it in a pre-made frozen crust, which I pre-cooked for 10 minutes before adding the quiche ingredients. This was the first time I cooked with leeks, and other leek recipe I saw pre-cooked them before baking, so I saluted the leeks in 1 tbsp butter for about 10 minutes, then added the kale for 1 minute (instead of steaming it). I'm really curious if others have either (1) pre-cooked both the kale and leeks or (2) did not pre-cook either. Mine turned out great, but if I could add all raw ingredients to the quiche and then just bake it, I would like the ease of that. Lastly, I thought it needed more than a pinch of salt. I may try 1/8 tsp next time.

This is one of the yummiest recipes I've made from this website.  I told my husband we were having Quiche for dinner and he turned up his nose and said, "yuck."  Well let me tell you, I nearly had to fight him to have piece!!  I substituted baby spinach for kale so that I didn't have to drag out my steamer.  I also added about 1/3 cup of cooked crumbled Jimmy Dean Maple Sausage, and about an 1/8 tsp. of red pepper to give a nice zing.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this for dinner a couple of days ago. I didn't have any leeks, therefore I used green onions as a replacement. I also added 4 pieces of cooked, chopped bacon. I did not steam the kale beforehand. It took 30 minutes in my toaster oven and it was ready! It turned out  good! I will definitely make it again!

Very easy and quick recipe! Loved it, will definitely try it again! I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used basil instead and still tasted great!

This was a wonderful way to use fresh kale. My only substitutions were to use green onion (including the bulb) and one garlic clove instead of the leek.  I steamed the kale in a frying pan with a small amount of Evoo & water, then set aside the tenderized kale on a plate while I sauteed the green onion and garlic.  Added the kale back in and mixed slightly, then added the chopped tomatoes as a second layer, followed by the egg and cheese mixture.  I put the frying pan in the oven and baked until the egg mixture was set, at which point I turned on the broiler for about two minutes to crisp up the cheese on top.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe, I will make this again!

I have made this several times. I do not like kale, so I substituted steamed broccoli. I have also used yellow onions. The leek is by far the favorite, but if you do not have leeks on hand or just don't feel up to cleaning the leeks..yellow onions work great too. I also have added an additional egg. Changing cheeses is another way to switch it up. Easy to make and very tasty. It is a fun recipe to play with.

I've never made quiche before, and decided to try this recipe. I was pleasantly surprised! I had to make a couple of substitutions because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used cheddar cheese and feta for the cheese, I didn't have leeks, so I added roasted red peppers instead. I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used dried. I found it a little salty, but it could have been the cheeses that I had, so just be careful with the amount of salt you add. You can always add more afterwards! I also decided to do "mini quiches" since I couldn't find my pie pan. I'll for sure be making this again!

This was very tasty and the three of us who tried it liked it very much. I did not have leeks, so I used chopped sweet onions instead. I also sub milk with cashew milk since that is what I drink. I made a second quiche with regular cheese (a Mexican mixture) and chopped tomatoes it was wonderful too. I did not pre-cook the kale on either and it worked out just fine. Would be excellent with ham or sausage added as well. Doesn't need a pie crust which I love too. I will be making this more often to use up the kale & veggies in the garden.

My kids loved this and requested it again sans tomato. I'll probably substitute chopped sun dried tomatoes next time. Delicious and the aroma of rosemary and leek in the house was amazing.

Omit the crust and this is a keeper for my gluten-free recipe collection! This was delicious as a main meal served with soup! My husband ate 1/2 of the pie and didn't miss a crust

Yum! So delicious. I didn't have any kale, so I used Swiss chard instead. A flavorful and healthy breakfast dish.

This is a wonderful breakfast that is healthy and delicious. I like it better with a crust but that is the only thing I have changed. Everyone that has tried it at my house likes it and has asked for more. Five stars for using great ingredients in a delightful way.
