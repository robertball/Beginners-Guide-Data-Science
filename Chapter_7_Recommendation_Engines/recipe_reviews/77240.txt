Excellent, I did add juice from the artichoke to moisten, also used less bread crumbs.  All and all wonderful, got plenty of comments on how good this was and so simple to make.  A keeper

Pretty good! Made this for a dinner party and it was gone! I used half the breadcrumbs, beans, parm cheese and garlic, and it was still good.

I followed this recipe exactly.  If you want a dense casserole that is similar to turkey dressing or stuffing then this is the one.  It is very easy to assemble & it bakes nicely - crispy on top & lightly browned.  My casserole was brown and crunchy on the bottom too - maybe could have baked it a little less.  I would not make this recipe again since I prefer crisper vegetables and less breading. Perhaps reduce the amount of bread crumbs and toss in some fresh beans or use kitchen sliced canned beans instead of french cut - they may hold up better instead of disappearing into the cheese & bread crumbs when baked.

This is one of my favorite recipes, I make this every Thanksgiving and get rave reviews for it. I do not like the traditional green bean casserole, but I love this one! I make a few modifications though: less breadcrumbs, add the juice of the artichokes of one can, use fresh garlic instead. Enjoy!

This was delicious!  The only change I made was 1 cup breadcrumbs instead of 2.  One poster said this tasted like a stuffed artichoke and I agree!!  There were no leftovers.

This was amazing.  I used 2 jars of marinated artichoke hearts, because that seemed to be the consensus of the reviews I read.  My husband loved it and said it's a keeper.

Thank you for submitting it.

Tasty, but a little too bready. Would lessen the amount of bread crumbs.

I have made this 3 times and found it to be rich but very good.I used 1 1/2 cup bread crumbs, 8 oz.three cheese blend Parmesan, Romano & Asiago( Kraft Brand)1-2 tsp. minced garlic. I used quarted art. hearts and saved the juice to mix 1/2 cup in with the casserole.It is so worth it. Yum...=)

This is a very rich recipe.  I modified the recipe by reducing cheese and breadcrumbs and adding a bit of the liquid from the beans.  However, it was still too rich.

This was a wonderful casserole but I made a few changes.  I used frozen green beans because I really don't like them canned.  I also used about half of the cheese that is called for, and half of the bread crumbs.  It came out moist and crunchy and good!  It is very "heavy" if you will, and a person can only eat so much before getting stuffed.  Thanks for a good recipe.

If you're looking for the traditional Green Bean Casserole---this is NOT it---We think it's better. It takes like a stuffed artichoke.  Made it for Thanksgiving, exactly as described, and everyone loved it!!! Thanks for sharing.

This is soooo good!  While I do have left overs, for my husband and I, I use a whole can of artichokes, two cans of beans and half everything else.  I do add some of the juice from the artichokes as mentioned. This, steak, wine...a meal.  Yum!

I was so disappointed in this. It sounded like it should have been awesome, but it was just waaay too rich and heavy. I ended up using only about half the mozzarella the recipe called for, too, so I can't even imagine how much heavier it would have been with all of it. The green beans just got lost in it all. Sorry. This one's not for us.

I rating this high because this is one of my favorite recipes. I use 2 cans green beans, 1 can artichoke hearts, butter instead of olive oil. First off I use plain artichoke hearts chopped in a food proccesor, I also chop the green beans in the food processor, use a bit of fresh garlic instead of powder, 1 stick of butter (melted), 1 cup of bread crumbs (white or garlic and herb), 1 1/2 cup mozzarella and 1/2 cup of parmasen, asiago, romanano blend cheese

My mother makes a version of this - she uses frozen artichokes and frozen green beans.  If you use canned, rinse them before baking to get that tin taste out.  Start with 1 cup bread crumbs and mix the olive oil along first before adding to veggies.  It's addictive!  :) Thank you for sharing!

This was really good. My family loved it. I followed the advise of others and used juice from the artichokes. The only thing I would change is I would cut back on the bread crumbs just a bit and add more cheese.

I made this for Chritmas dinner thinking it would go over well.  Everyone at dinner had previously eaten artichoke dip, so I assumed they would all enjoy the artichokes in this casserole.  You know what they say about assuming!  I thought it was fantastic but next time I'll make it with double the beans and no artichokes to please the crowd!  But it was a great alternative to the creamy casserole!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Sorry, but we did not love this and won't be making it again. I made it exactly as written with the exception of reducing the bread crumbs only slightly. This was different from the traditional casserole which was exactly what I was looking for, but the flavor missed the mark for all four of us.

Very good!  I'd recommend chopping up the artichokes.  I added about 15 mins. to the initial cooking time.

This was ok but could be improved upon.  Ithink next time I will omit the mozzarella because it made it stringy, maybe add a little milk and yogurt for creaminess.  I followed the other reviewers advice and used only one cup of breadcrumbs.  Definitely stick with the artichokes in water--we usually love the marinated ones but they were NOT good in this dish--too tangy.

Didn't need as much as this recipe made, so I halved it, and it was delicious. Kids and hubby really liked it. I also used frozen green beans instead of canned.

This was a tasty dish, but I was expecting better considering all the cheese. Compared to the other casseroles that were brought to the potluck, this was the last to go.

We used an extra can green beans, 1 tbsp fresh garlic, 1 tsp italian seasoning, 1 cup breadcrumbs, half the cheese,   artichoke w the juice and half a jar of roasted red peppers w its oil. It was pretty good w chicken. I would make it again for something different but it wont be a signature dish.

If you to actually want to taste vegetables in the casserole, this isn't for you. This wasn't very good. I think steaming your veggies and dressing them at the end is still my favorite. Baking them seems to take the taste away. Sorry!

This is a good recipe as is but being from New Orleans a few tweaks turns it into a mock stuffed artichoke, a NOLA favorite! Use ingredients as stated but substitute 3 to 4 cloves of fresh garlic minced in place of garlic powder (in the south we always use fresh garlic, it makes a huge difference in the taste) and add 1 small onion chopped. Drizzle fresh lemon juice on top after olive oil or top with thin slices of lemon.  Tastes just like a stuffed artichoke! Note that the consistency of this dressing will be thick.

I made this for my first official family Thanksgiving dinner and everyone LOVED it!  It's a very Italian twist to the old Ohio staple of Green Bean Casserole.

Brought back memories  of home down in New Orleans.  However, I use the artichoke marinate in mine.   I make sure to get those hard leaves off the artichoke hearts, cut hearts into quarters and add sautéed onions/ garlic to the mix.  Thanks for sharing!

If you love stuffed artichokes, this is all the goodness without all the work. I added the juice of one lemon, ( or marinated artichoke juice),  because that's  how we stuff our artichokes. If you are looking for a green bean dish, this may disappoint. The green beans (french style cut) mix well and are not noticeable in the dish. This is the dish that family ask me to bring to our holiday meals, and they don't realize the green beans are in the recipe.

The votes are in! This dish is absolutely awesome! 5 stars is not even enough. We ate it as a main course, and there was plenty to go around with leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I think that even my uncle who hates green beans would really like this dish. We didn't add any salt because the cheese gave it plenty flavor. Because we were running late and extra hungry, we started the casserole cooking in the microwave for 10 minutes while preheating the oven. After putting it in the oven, continued cooking it for 10 minutes with it foil covered. Then 15 minutes uncovered as directed. We will definitely be making this again :))

My entire family loves stuffed artichokes. As you know, making them can be very time consuming, so I made this recipe instead and it does taste just like a stuffed artichoke!!!!! EVERYONE loved it and came back for seconds. I think the use of the french style string beans provided the softer texture like the inside of the artichoke leaves and the artichoke hearts provided their usual firm deliciousness. I did add 1/2 can of the artichoke water but I'm not convinced it made a difference. But the final result was awesome. I also added a little lemon juice, about 1 tablespoon to the bean mixture. It gave it that little lemon freshness that my family is used to in stuffed artichokes. Will definitely make this again and again.

This was good, but there were too many soggy breadcrumbs and it gave the dish an unpleasant texture for me.  The flavors were very good though, similar to stuffed artichoke as others mentioned.  Perhaps 4 stars with far less breadcrumbs, and next time I'd use butter not oil.

Very good recipe, but it was very rich.  I reduced bread crumbs and added some artichoke brine based on comments from others.  After making those changes, I think next time I will use a little less cheese.  I love a cheesy dish, but I would have preferred for the veggies to shine through a little more.  Will definitely make this again!

Based on how much goodness this contains (cheese, garlic and breadcrumbs) you would think the veggies would be so tasty, but I thought it was so bland!

Everyone always loves this. It's super easy and really fast. I use more artichoke and like the way the french cut beans break down. It really makes it seem as if there is more of the best part of the artichoke hearts. I also use seasoned panko bread crumbs instead of the italian. Great recipe with lots of room to manuver according to taste.

Everyone raved about this dish at Thanksgiving. I used less of everything except green beans, partly because I couldn't fit it all in the dish! (I increased the servings to 12). Mine was the only casserole that was completely gone after dinner. Deee-lish!!

If you're looking for a twist on the old-time favorite green bean casserole...give this one a try. I followed the recipe except I used frozen French-cut green beans (I'm just not a fan of canned vegetables). This vegie casserole has a rich combination of flavors. It could over power some entrees.

If you like stuffed artichokes, then you will like this.  The only thing I did not like about it was the green beans.  I would add more artichoke hearts (marinated) and not add in any green beans.

After reading other reviewers recommendations for this casserole,and had never eaten stuffed artichokes, I wanted something different as after Thanksgiving dinner for 2. I didn't have bread crumbs,so I had half a package of gluten free stuffing mix,left from Thanksgiving,in place of breadcrumbs. I used only 1 jar of artichokes packed in juice,(not marinated),chopped lightly with two cans of canned green beans ,(not french cut),rinsed with water and drained well to take out that canned taste. I sauteed 1 small onion with 2 cloves minced garlic with 1 tablespoon of butter and tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil,until fragrant and tender.I squeezed half a lemon over the green bean and artichoke mixture as recommended by other reviewers. I only had 1,1/2 cups of leftover turkey so I layered the middle with that,and put the rest of the stuffing mixture and topped it of with shredded parmesan and placed sliced mozzarella cheese on top and baked into bubbly. Very good! I think those that found the original recipe too bready,and bland should give this dish another go by reducing the bread crumbs by half,or a third, and not use french cut greens,use whole cut,fresh,canned or frozen.I recommend highly to use 1 or 2 cloves of fresh garlic and fresh lemon juice,along with flavored breadcrumbs or dry stuffing mix as this makes this more flavorful and not bland at all. I plan making this again!

Absolutely yummo and easier than stuffed artichokes! Only difference is that I use fresh garlic- 5 cloves and put the oil in the mix and then drizzle the top.

I was looking for a different green bean casserole to make for Thanksgiving and this one sounded good. It didn't disappoint. Everybody liked it. However, I wish I had read the previous reviews and added some of the artichoke or bean juice because it was pretty dry. Also, the artichokes and parm cheese make it a pretty pricy side dish ($16). Something I'll only make for special occasions.

Really big hit. I used a 16 oz bag of frozen French-cut green beans, 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs, 1 tablespoon of garlic power, and 4 oz of Parmesan cheese. I did add a little water to the pan after everything was assembled. And I sprinkled some breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese on top.

I made this dish for the first time to take to my annual Thanksgiving potluck at work and was nervous because it was untested by me first.  While it was a big hit it was not my favorite dish that day.  The dish was served cold because I was in a meeting when the food was being laid out and people didn't realize it should be warmed up first so the mozzarella could melt. I didn't care for it cold and don't know that I would care for it if it were warmed up but everyone really seemed to enjoy it which pleased me.  I was even asked for the recipe.  The following changes were made as suggested by previous reviewers: only used 1c. of bread crumbs, I added the juice of one jar of artichokes (they were marinated but I'm not sure if that's how they always come when sold in jars), I used frozen cut green beans because they didn't have any french cut & I'm sure this was better, and I doubled the mozzarella to 16 oz.  I gave the recipe 4 stars even though didn't care for it in case I only didn't like it because it was served cold.  My co-workers raved about how good it was. I'm sure they'll be requesting this again next year.

Made this for Thanksgiving and the only change I made was I used frozen green beans that I thawed.  It turned out O.K. but I thought it was a little dry.

excellent. i will make it again for company. I used frozen beans I cooked for a couple of minutes. I'm sure it would work with fresh cooked beans as well. Thanksgiving dinner guests, all 28 of them loved them

I made this for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. Although, I will definitely tone down the garlic next time .. way too much. I did take the others advice and decrease the amount of bread crumbs. This is a keeper ...Thanks.

This is a tasty casserole and very easy to make. It's great as a side dish during the holidays. I keep getting asked to bring this to dinner partys.

I made this for x-mas and no one liked it.  The artichoke and garlic were too strong. The bread crumbs were overwhelming.  This was just too rich!

This is a great holiday recipe.  I made it for Christmas last year, and everyone loved it.  It's a great change from the standard "green bean casserole".

Loved it! Not everyone likes artichokes, but I bought the small ones, and not a problem to scoop around them when serving.  I used a bag of frozen green beans instead of canned. I think I tend to have a heavy hand when it comes to garlic, so it was a bit overpowering for some, but should be fine if you follow the directions. Will make again.
