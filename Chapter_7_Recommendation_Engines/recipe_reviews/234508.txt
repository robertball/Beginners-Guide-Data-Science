I followed the recipe as written and it was super simple and a big hit - great combination! So much so that the next time I saw ground turkey on sale, I made enough for 3, put each in it's own freezer bag and stored them for easy week night dinners, just thaw and bake. Thanks for the addition to my " freezer food" repertoire!

This recipe is delicious as written!  I personally like to add a shredded zucchini to the mix as well, this adds moisture and healthy veggies to the loaf.  Sneak those veggies into your kiddos!  Make a double batch and use the left overs for "meatball" sandwiches, grill the slices on a skillet, top with provolone until melted and serve with marinara on a sub roll!

This meatloaf does not fill the pan very high - will double the recipe next time. Tomato sauce with some dried basil sprinkled over is a perfect topping, but I may just try pasta sauce in the future.

I doubled the recipe, added diced onions and extra garlic; didn't have tomato sauce on hand, so I used marinara sauce instead. DELICIOUS! The marinara sauce made it taste like an Italian meatball. Came out perfect!

I give this recipe 5 stars.  I baked it as per the recipe using gluten free breadcrumbs and adding italian seasoning to them.  I then topped it with a brownsugar/ketchup/mustard glaze I found on this site instead of the tomato sauce.  yummy!!!!!!

Really really good recipe.  I added minced onion and shredded carrot, used Italian bread crumbs with romano cheese, and like another reviewer, used Herbes de Provence instead of Italian seasoning.  Added a lot of depth but next time I`ll use a little less - forgot how much stronger it is!  The texture of the meatloaf was perfect, very moist although I did crank up the heat for the last 15 minutes.  Also made a sauce out of brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard and it was tasty.  My only complaint is how small it was.  Next time I`ll use 2 lbs per loaf AND make several of them to freeze!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is submitter of this recipe. Thank you for all the good reviews. A few things I would like to mention. I use my own tomato sauce (marinara) in this recipe which has saut√©ed onions and garlic in it. You can add what ever you want to your liking. Meatloaf can be made out of any meat. I personally don't like Worcestershire sauce, so I don't use it, but feel free to add it. This is "Italian" turkey meatloaf which is why I don't use ketchup. (I am not a fan of ketchup either unless I am eating French fries) If ketchup is all you have or you want to top it with brown sugar (which was unheard of in my Italian family) feel free.

Made this for dinner the other night. Super quick, easy, and required ingredients I pretty much already had on hand! I didn't have any fresh garlic so I used a bit of garlic salt (just a pinch) and I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce. My husband liked it so much he asked me to make it again tonight!

What a simple wonderful meal!! Very flavorful, I added some diced onions and used lemon pepper instead of black pepper and it was great!! Add the extra tomato sauce on top ad sprinkle some Parmesan cheese and you're good to go.

This was excellent! Like others, I added diced peppers and onions. I also sprinkled Mozzarella as a topper and placed it under the broiler for about 4 minutes to finish it off. Will definitely be having it again!

This is a good, basic recipe to build from. I had chopped up sweet peppers, tomatoes, onion, and shredded carrots on hand so I added them to the meat. I also opted for Herbs de Provence instead of standard Italian seasoning and I think it helped create more depth in flavor. I topped off each slice with parmesean cheese. My husband and I had two small servings each with enough left over for one of us to have for lunch tomorrow.

I made this for dinner last night for my boyfriend, who is a complete beef eater and not a ground turkey one, and he ate every bite. Afterward he said that this recipe was a keeper. So happy to try and keep him healthy.

I've been making a version of this recipe for years and it is so easy and delicious. I add chopped onion, grated Parmigianno-Reggiano and sun-dried tomatoes to mine. I really think the sun-drieds make it special.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe so we would have plenty left for sandwiches.  I added more garlic than the recipe called for and may add some other herbs and maybe even some chopped green chile.  I'm not sure how other people's was mushy - mine came out perfectly firm.  Definitely a keeper.

For turkey meatloaf this is great! I ran out of garlic (can you believe it?) so I added a little garlic powder. I also added 1/4 c of water so it wouldn't dry out. I also added a chopped onion. We will definitely make this again. Just FYI, this made about 5 servings for us.

My go to recipe. I add shredded carrots, and oatmeal instead of bread crumbs. I use egg substitute. If I don‚Äôt use marinara sauce, then I triple the spices. Plus I always include dried minced onion. 
Most of the time I microwave my loaf in s glass pan. 
I let the meatloaf cool and make delicious sandwiches with it. -  So yummy.

I've made this several times in the past. This time, I took a twist and boy was it great!!  Instead of the tomato sauce, I used a 24 oz. bottle of Rinaldi Pasta Sauce flavored with garlic and onion - a chunky style.  I measured one cup for the meatloaf, and heated the remainder.  Then for our side dish, I made plain bowtie pasta.  I tossed the pasta in part of the sauce, reserving one cup for adding to the meatloaf (as suggested with the tomato sauce).  Last we sprinkled grated Parmesan cheese over the pasta and the meatloaf. Only change I may make next time is to start with a Caesar Salad!

Very easy to make and tasty with just these few ingredients.  The next time I make this, I'm going to add a little spice to it!  Maybe salsa or spicy barbecue sauce in the loaf.

I have made this meatloaf several times and I can't believe how much flavor it has when it is so simple. I usually triple the recipe for my family of 5. This is the only meatloaf I make now and paired with mashed potatoes,  it's the perfect dinner!

WOW!!  This was a huge hit at my house!  I doubled the recipe to make sure we had leftovers and I also put on spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce (I just wanted to make sure it had enough flavor).  And even though it wasn't part of the recipe, I had some leftover heavy cream that I drizzled over the spaghetti sauce before baking.  That just made it over the top!  I know peole hate when you review a recipe that you made changes to but the basic recipe I did follow to a T but just added a few personal touches to make it my own.  I will forever be using this meatloaf recipe!!  Thanks!

This was good...but a little bland for my husband. Next time I'm adding a bit of seasoned salt. Other that it has made the 'Please Make Again' list.

Made this recipe several times and the best way we seem to like it is by adding diced onion and bell peppers to the mix and topping it with our favorite marinara sauce.

I doubled the recipe so it would feed 4 and have some leftover.  It was a little bland for me but the boyfriend thought it was delicious.  I also used beef instead of turkey.

This is an excellent recipe.  I added diced onions, green peppers, orange peppers, and extra pressed garlic.  I sauteed mushrooms and them put them in Newman's Own Sockarooni marinari, which I drizzled over the loaf.  I topped it with romano cheese.

Simple and Delicious!

I added turkey italian sausage (the big ones not the breakfast ones)and added a few dashes of worchestshire sauce. Followed the rest of the recipe and it was the best.

I doubled recipe but would cut back on bread crumbs in order to make it more moist.  I also mixed some leftover salsa with jar of pasta sauce that worked out great!  It is easy and flavorful so I‚Äôll make again.  Looking forward to leftovers!

This turned out soooo AMAZING! For the most part I followed the recipe, the only thing I added was Worcestershire sauce (that‚Äôs because I originally was going to try to make something else that requires it but changed my mind last minute) and this was easy and perfect!! The sauce I used was Rao‚Äôs homemade marinara, and my husband loved it. I paired it with some steamed broccoli and fried sliced potatoes with rosemary and salt/pepper! It‚Äôs a definite repeat for our household and might use it for dinner parties!

This was great - my best attempt at turkey meatloaf yet! 

I added fresh parsley, onion, and mushrooms to the mix (to compensate a bit for plain bread crumbs we have to use to cut down on sodium levels). I also used marinara (low sodium) as the sauce on top. 

Next time I may double the recipe as it filled the loaf pan only halfway, but was a good amount for two people with a few slices leftover.

I tripled everything as it looked to me like even two pounds of ground turkey would not fill my loaf pan.  I kept the ratios the same except for the garlic -  I added five teaspoons of prepared, minced garlic and a generous splash of Worcestershire  sauce.  After the prescribed 40 minutes, I sprinkled maybe two tablespoons of shredded Parmesan over the loaf and topped it with a cup of Newmans Sockarooni sauce (with added garlic).  Will definitely make this again!

This is my favorite meatloaf ever-except I use the 20 oz. turkey rather than a pound.

This is very good, but I made several changes while preparing it.  I added the Italian bread crumbs directly to the ground turkey instead of using Italian seasonings.  I also used seasoned pasta sauce instead of plain tomato sauce.  This made it especially tasty if you like Italian food.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I changed the recipe a lot, so it would be misleading to give it 5 stars, but it lends it self to personalization to fit your family's tastes.

This is an AMAZING version of meatloaf. So amazing that my 9 year old son requested this be his birthday dinner today. I add more Italian seasoning to the tomato sauce before I pour it on top of the meatloaf in the last 10 min.

This was so easy to make and very delicious. Pretty too! I added a little grated parmesan on top of the sauce before putting it in the oven again, added just a little more flavor.

I made this recipe but  traded out bread crumbs for oatmeal (keeping the gluten to a minimum)and it came out better than i expected.  I also used ketchup as the sauce but i can do spaghetti sauce as well. easy and quick..I will be preparing this dish again.

I made this because I had  purchase  some  ground turkey to make  turkey burgers for a cook out,but the cook out was called off due to rain so what is better than meatloaf.This a nice and easy recipe I just added some  ground pork to it was great but a lot better the next day.

I made this because my mother loves meatloaf and so I was looking for a healthier alternative that still tasted good. It came out moist and the flavors were great (although I did up the seasoning). I find it helps to season it as you would any meat. I tend to go by eye rather than measuring spoons. I realized too late that I didn't have tomato sauce  for the glaze on top but I substituted ketchup and it worked just fine.

This meatloaf was so amazing. This was my first time making a meatloaf and it turned out so well. I agree that doubling the recipe is best, since the meatloaf is small in a loaf pan. Also I feel like the 2 cups of sauce is a little much so I would recommend 1.5 cups! Overall such a great, cheap and relatively healthy dinner!

I added a little cheese just because everything is better with cheese,  but otherwise changed nothing.  I was worried it would be too dry and looked small but it was delicious.  Seriously amazing. My fiance couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  Definitely in rotation.

Good base for making your own creation. I added finely chopped carrots celery onion lots of garlic and fresh parsley, made my own croutons (baked/broiled garlic bread basically). For my sauce: ketchup and leftover pasta sauce with few dashes of tobasco and seasonings. Just add whatever you have in the fridge that you already enjoy!

First I think it would be better with a little rosemary added to this meat mixture and also I think the recipe should be doubled if you are serving more then 3 people. The meatloaf was a little small it worked out good for us as there were only 3 of us and there was just enough for three nice pieces but definitely would not have been enough to serve 6 as the recipe stated. Either way it was a nice meatloaf and Chef John still has the best recipes on here. Thank you.

Great recipe!  I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce  and waited to add the tomato sauce till about halfway through cooking the meatloaf.  Also, we're huge ketchup fans, so that  was the tomato sauce I used.

loved having this with an Italian tomato sauce & parmesan cheese; texture was really good, but the meat had set and some of the moisture had drained off before we mixed this recipe up.... might add some of the sauce to the meatloaf, and/or some sundried tomatoes, and grated zucchini and more crumbs if needed...

I increased to 1/2 c. bread crumbs and added 1/2 c. shredded carrots.  I also add an extra egg and omitted the Italian seasoning (because my husband doesn't care for it).  It turned out pretty good!  In fact, he really liked it!  I plan to use this recipe again, although I may use jarred spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce next time.

I made this and it was delicious.  I doubled the recipe and added some chopped onion to it. I also grated a bit of cheese on it at the end and put it back in the oven for a few minutes to melt it. It was very moist and every one had a second serving. I served it with rice and saut√©ed mushrooms. I  will definitely make it again.

Needed basic recipe for Meatloaf so I took this one and made the following changes. I used 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. ground turkey. I used 1/4 cup Gluten Free Italian bread crumbs and instead of Italian seasoning I used 1/2 tsp parsley flakes, 1/4 tsp thyme, 1/4 tsp Rosemary, and 1/4 tsp oregano. I did not have any garlic so I used 1 tsp ground garlic powder. I used the recommended black pepper and salt. I did not have any tomato sauce so I used ketchup on the top and mixed water in with the second half of the ketchup to make the sauce to put on after it was done. It tasted great. I would add a bit more bread crumbs and maybe increase the amount of meat to 1 1/2 lbs. We have leftovers and my husband has requested that I add worstorshire sauce to the topping sauce.

Very good, if a little dry.  Didn't top with tomato sauce since my husband hates it, that might have contributed to dryness.  I used half/half mix or Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and Parmesan breadcrumbs.  A nice change of pace from my standard recipe.   Thanks for sharing!

I make this recipe frequently and my family really loves it. It's simple and very versatile. After making it several times as a loaf, I now bake it in a muffin pan‚ÄîTakes a little less time in the oven and turns out even better, in my opinion. Even my notoriously picky husband loves this recipe, and making mini-loaves means it's super easy to pack leftovers for his lunch or make extra to freeze.

This went together quickly and cooked in the time expected.  I added a shredded zucchini.  I thought it could use additional italian seasoning.  Also - I used 1/1/3 lbs of turkey (the package size).  Still, with 2 big eaters, 1 average and 1 light, there was none left.  I will double it if I make it again.  I would also add more seasoning.  It sliced nicely.

We loved this recipe!  The flavor is great, but is a bit dry.  I added a pur√©e of onion and zucchini and a 1/4 c worchestershire sauce.  We had sandwiches with marinara and that helped with the dryness.

Very good and healthy meatloaf. I used a whole clove of garlic and 1/2 tsp. salt.  Also I used only 1 cup of tomato sauce for the top as I prefer less tomato over the meatloaf and it was so good.  Thanks Patti.

I liked this recipe, it tasted good and the loaf was firm and held together nicely and sliced nicely without falling apart. I used plain bread crumbs and I did not have garlic so I used ground cloves.  I topped it with the tomatoes sauce, but I think barbeque sauce would make a nice variation. Best turkey meatloaf I've tried so far. It is a keeper! This recipe feeds two nicely you could double it if you need more servings.

We enjoyed this twist on the classic meatloaf.  To make sure it tasted "Italian", I increased the spices and added": garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, basil and a shake or two of parmesan cheese along with the spices listed.  To make it more tasty, I added onion and green pepper and a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce.  To avoid the small/short appearance that many reported, I shaped it like a small football and placed in a glass pie pan for baking and made it taller.  For the sauce, I used ketchup and added a bit of sugar, and a few sprinkles of the spices I listed and the ones in the meatloaf.  Very tasty!  The recipe yielded just enough for the two of us having two slices with our dinner.  There were two slices left for a sandwich the next day.

I am making it tonight. Added cheese and herb seasonings from a pasta box along with sausage and ketchup instead of tomato sauce. Topped with shredded parm cheese and chives. Not adding salt becuase of the cheese mix and sausage. Fingers crossed!

Rave reviews from the kids and hubby.  Added 1 tbs of grated Parmesan cheese.  The meatloaf was moist and did not taste like turkey.

At first bite, I thought...it's good. That's all; just good. But as I kept eating it's actually weirdly addictive. I used someone's insanely brilliant idea of using Italian croutons (used Costco's Foccacia crouton) and threw in some chopped onion (I eyeballed it; maybe 2 tbsps?) and it was really enjoyable. I'm currently breaking my bad habit of serving food IMMEDIATELY as soon as it's done but the rest period for this loaf totally made it (for me, anyways). Not mushy, runny or bland at all.

This recipe was so quick and easy! I defrosted frozen ground turkey and was worried it would be dry but it definitely wasn't. I didn't have breadcrumbs on hand so instead I crushed Italian croutons. I also added 1/4 of an onion and doubled the garlic. I will definitely be making this again.

All 3 of my kids loved this recipe!  The 6 year old pretty much made it by herself (exactly as written) and the older 2 said it was like "eating a meatball in loaf form!"  This one will definitely be going into regular rotation!  Thanks for the quick and easy dinner dish!

This was a huge hit with my husband and two little ones, all of whom are picky eaters.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I made this easy dish tonight and it was light, refreshing and tasted great. I did use GF breadcrumbs, added light onions and also added fresh basil to the top when it was done. Tasted great!
