I made my first homemade orange marmalade and wanted to make something delicious with it for chicken. This sauce was fantastic! I did add a little more hot sauce because we love more heat. Interesting to play around with the ingredient amounts and make it the way you like. Packed full of flavor for glazing the chicken because it is really sweet and spicy. Enjoy.

5.8.18 Used a horseradish sauce recipe from this site then made as written. The sweet-spicy ratio was just a bit too sweet for us but that was easy enough to fix. I just added more (actually a lot) hot sauce and additional horseradish sauce to achieve that perfect sweet-spicy flavor. We all have different taste preferences and I think this is one of those recipes where you just need to adapt to your liking. There are few ingredients so it isn t rocket science to tweak this recipe. This would be an excellent sidekick to coconut shrimp but today I partnered it with Deep-Fried Prawns and Rice Croquettes another recipe on the AR site. lwilliams001 thanks for sharing your recipe it s versatile simple and simply good.

After forgetting horseradish twice at the store to make this I decided to improvise a bit and I used deli brown mustard instead of Dijon as it has horseradish already in the mix. It was great! I used it on chicken as the other reviewer did but I imagine it would be great with beef or game as well. Thank you lwilliams001 for sharing this recipe!

I was in the mood for a dipping sauce other than cocktail sauce for my popcorn shrimp. I came across this and it was perfect. I love the sweet spicy slight tang that this has. I think it would be a great marinade for chicken or salmon. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this and basted the chicken while grilling it. I wish I had thought of baking it! The sauce really burnt while cooking. I thought it tasted just very marmalad-y. It wasn't unpleasant but didn't really feel that interesting. I would add more spice next time. My husband loved it just as it was.
