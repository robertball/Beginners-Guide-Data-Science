This recipe is rated 4 stars as is. If you make the changes I did, then I would rate it a 5 star. Instead of vanilla, I added 1 tsp of almond extract. I used dried cranberries, and increased it to 1 cup. I added about 2 tsp of orange zest. The muffins were very dry, so next time I'll add 2 tbsp to 1/4 cup milk to the batter. My changes make them awesome! NOTE: I have to update my comments. I made these again with fresh chopped cranberries and they were by far much better than with dried cranberries. Also, add just 1/2 tsp almond extract, a whole tsp is a bit much. And I will add even more orange zest the next time. I also recommend just cutting the cranberries in half and not chop them. This way you get the nice tart taste in each bite. But, use more cranberries, I used 1 cup and will increase that 1 1/2 cups the next time as well.

Hands down one of the best muffins I have ever made. I didn't think they were going to work, the batter was SUPER thick. But, they cooked up beautifully & the taste is so delicious. You need the sugar with cranberries. Next time, I'm trying blueberries & will cut back a bit on the sugar.

These were excellent! I did have to sub for what I had on  hand. I used dried cranberries and Greek yogurt (instead of sour cream) and they  turned out great. Nice recipe!

These are delicious.  This recipe made 24 reg muffins for me. I made slight changes such as: 1 cup white flour, 1 cup wheat flour.  I used CRAISINS (doubled the amount on this recipe) that I soaked in 3/4 cup of apple sauce for 30 minutes or so.  (Applesauce adds lots of moisture and plumps up the craisins. I use 2 kid size snack cups of apple sauce).  SAVE YOURSELF THE SCRUBBING!!!  I've made these so many times that I have perfected how to NOT want to throw my muffin pans away!  I butter each cup (I put my hand in a quart size baggie to do the greasing...saves my hands from getting too yucky!) Then I combine a mixture of 1/8 cup of sugar & 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I put 1/8 tsp of the mixture in each cup & shook around until well coated on all sides.  Then tapped off the excess in the sink.  Now my "nonstick" pans really become "non stick"!!! Yay!  Turned out perect!!! My muffins were done in 15 minutes...so watch them carefully.  This recipe is worth WAY more than 5 stars!!

Wow!  I HATE fresh cranberries.  Kinda like the juice but that's all, and even then I want to mix  it with apple or something.  I purchased a bag of these little berries (which is how I discovered I hate them) and found this recipe.  I made a couple of tweaks: plain yogurt instead of sour scream (didn't have any), pure orange extract instead of vanilla, 2/3 cup of the white flour was replaced with whole wheat, and I completely forgot to put the nutmeg and sugar on top.  I just pulled them out of the oven and they are heaven!!!  The kids and I already gobbled some up.  It made 12 standard size and 20 minis.  I don't agree at all that there's too much sugar in this recipe.  Cranberries are TART, and while I agree they didn't rise (were flat and unattractive) they are NOT cake like--maybe because of the whole wheat flour. Now I know what to do with the rest of the cranberries.

I guess I'm one of the few who made these muffins following the recipe precisely - therefore, you can add, eliminate or substitute ingredients to your liking confidently based on my experience.  The butter lends its great flavor and, combined with the sour cream, makes these muffins rich and moist.  Chopping the cranberries coarsely worked well, and I loved the fine sugar/nutmeg topping as opposed to a demerera or raw sugar.  The pecans were a compatible addition but could easily be omitted.  So many cranberry muffin or quick bread recipes contain orange juice and zest and I liked the fact this one didn't.  They rose high with nice, rounded domes.  If I had any criticism at all, it would be only that I found the nutmeg just a llittle too bold, but that might be purely subjective.  Bottom line, this is a fine recipe that works well as is, requiring no modifications.

I have to rerate this one. I rated it as a 4 last night after I ate one right out of the oven. I found the nutmeg overwhelming when the muffins were warm, but now, the next day, they are absolute PERFECTION! These are definitely in the top 5 muffins I've ever had. I was worried these wouldn't turn out because halfway into making them, I realized I was out of sour cream. I stirred in some milk until I got the batter to the right consistency, probably a little less than 1/2 a cup. I will definitely try these again using sour cream. They baked beautifully and I love the way the sugar on top looks. Thanks!

Great recipe, and even better with the adjustments from commenter "Marsha".  The almond extract really makes it.  Also, to make these a little more festive, here are two tips: 1) Use an additional half-cup of pecans, but candy those in a saucepan with some brown sugar and butter.  2) Use Sugar in the Raw as a topping.  The coarse sugar crystals make the muffins look beautiful, and give a nice little crunch on top.  (I guess I should mention -- Top the muffins with the candied pecan pieces and Sugar in the Raw crystals right before baking.)

Wonderful!  I added orange zest, cinnamon and a little cloves.  I also used 1c fresh cranberries cut in halves.  Next time I think I will use even more berries.  These are sweet and delicious!  A wonderful dessert item!

Yum.  I replaced the nutmeg with 1/4 teaspoon of cloves, because I am not the biggest fan of nutmeg.  They are fantastic!

I made these muffins as directed and they came out good. However, I love the flavor of orange with cranberries; so I'm going to add orange zest and change the nutmeg to cinnamon the next time.

Wow!  I made these with 1 cup of cranberries and substituted vanilla yogurt for the sour cream.  I baked them in large-size muffin tin, with paper liners that I lightly sprayed with cooking spray.   The muffins came right out without sticking.  Total bake time was about 30 minutes. I used frozen cranberries and did not want to wait for them to thaw to chop them, so I threw them, frozen, in my mini food processor.   The processor really finely chopped them, so I had little bits of cranberries spread throughout the muffins, which I loved.  Muffinswere very soft, crumbly, and cakelike.  The sugar-nutmeg topping adds a little sweetnesss and a nice crunch to the muffins.  I might add a little cinnamon to the topping next time.

Fantastic muffin recipe! The only changes I made was increasing the vanilla to 1 tbsp.,  adding 1 tbsp. orange rind, adding a pinch of clove, and increasing the nutmeg to 1 tsp. I made 24 mini muffins and 9 large muffins. I also topped them off with Simple Orange Glaze from this site. Absolutely moist & delicious! I will definitely be making these again. Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe, I used fresh cranberries, cut in half, and I used a full cup.  I used what my hubby and I call my big- muffin pans and got six of those and six regular muffins.

I was looking for a new muffin recipe and found this one.  It was delicious.  I used dried cranberries that I soaked in hot water for 5 minutes.  I also used 1 cup of cranberries and just under one cup of pecans.  I also used cinnamon instead of nutmeg as the topping.  It was easy to make and quick.  Very tasty.

This is a wonderfully moist muffin. I increased the cranberries to 1 cup and used fresh nutmeg. I love the flavor mix of the pecans and the fresh grated nutmeg. Such a nice change from the cranberry orange bread I have made for years. I also decreased the unbleached flour to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup spelt flour for more whole grain nutrition.

I made a double recipe for a brunch, and everyone really enjoyed them. Batter was very thick, but not a problem. I added the zest and juice of 1 orange, and cut back about 1/4 c. of sour cream. I garnished the tops with pecan halves for presentation. Will make again.

Absolutely terrific! Light. moist texture and perfect level of sweetness. The cranberries contributed the ideal, festive tart counterpoint. As I was making for a crowd and didn't know tastes, I topped each with a pecan half after sprinkling with the sugar mixture, so that those who don't like them could easily take it off before eating. They disappeared fast. Note that mine browned more than those in the picture, and I only baked for 19 minutes. After running a knife blade around the muffins, I could remove them much more easily from the pans. A+

I have kept this recipe a secret from my girlfriends who just ooh and ahh over my cranberry pecan muffins. As with all baking I do, I only use real butter and always double the vanilla. I also make about 2 fewer muffins than the recipe calls for and fill the cups VERY full so they get a nice big bakery crown on top. I use course sugar to sprinkle on the top.

These were fine but I didn't care for the dense muffin that it produced.  I also think that some of the white sugar should be substituted for brown sugar and more cranberries added.

Excellent muffins.  Made them gluten free using a combo of brown rice flour, tapioca starch and potato starch in lieu of the flour.  Came out perfect - really light.  Next time I am going to try to reduce the fat and sugar.

FABULOUS!!  I reduced the amount of nutmeg & added a bit of cinnamon, plus about  1 1/2 Tbsp milk.  Topped with a shake of coarse turbinado sugar for crunch...ready to make them again already!!  Yummm!

I made these for breakfast they were excellent. I took some of the suggestions like adding milk and it worked for me. I might bake these for a potluck.

These muffins are great!  I added 1T orange zest and made the cranberries 1 cup.  I used fresh cranberries which I suspect is the secret.  My 10 and 8 year old love them!

EXCELLENT!  I filled the muffin pans almost to the top and they domed nicely.  I used chopped walnuts in place of pecans as we prefer them.  I used large granulated sugar crystals for the tops.  The batter was really thick so I was happy to find Scotdog's review.  I didn't worry.  They taste wonderful but next time I won't chop the cranberries as much because I love a burst of flavor.  Thank you Marilyn Gorham for an EXCELLENT recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly except I had not one bit of butter so I had to sub 1/4 cup butter flavored shortening and 1/4 cup veg. oil.  I used fresh cranberries and these were very good!  Highly recommend!

Not one of the best muffin recipes I've tried. They were a little bit on the sweet side and did not rise to a nice round crown on the top. That said, if you like a cupcake-type muffin, these do taste very good.

These muffins are really delicious, particularly the nutmeg, which adds a special touch. I used frozen whole cranberries and didn't chop them up, and it was fine. The batter is very thick compared to many  muffine batters, but they turn out wonderful anyway. Thanks for a lovely recipe!

A great muffin!  However, I like my tins full to the very top and a little more before going into the oven so this recipe makes 12 for me.  I did make a few changes due to not having sour cream on hand... but nothing that would alter the flavour drastically.   I used greek yoghurt and some cream instead of sour cream and 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  For the topping I used the course raw brown sugar and cinnamon.  don't be afraid to become a little creative and switch up the fruits with blueberries or even some fresh peach chunks.  Thanks for sharing!

These are FANTASTIC! I made three changes: 1) I soaked dried cranberries in pineapple juice to reconstitute them (make them plump and juicy) before adding them to the batter. 2) I used whole wheat flour (just because I had it on hand). 3) I did not add sugar mix to top (ran out of nutmeg).
These are delicious and keep well in an air-tight container! :)

I used 3/4 cup orange flavored cranberries and 1/2 cup regular cranberries.  I also used 1/2 cup of sugar to avoid them being too sweet.

These were incredible!! Due to bad planning, I was missing nutmeg and only had 3/4 ofsour cream so I used about 1/4 cup of buttermilk with it. For the topping I used cinnamon and sugar on half of the muffins and left the rest plain and either way was delicious. 
I couldnt find fresh canberries so i bought bigger dried ones that were still somewhat juicy and cut them in half. It worked really well.
I made these for a birthday breakfast and everyone LOVED them and begged foe the recipe. I'll be making these regularly from now on - they're sure to impress!!

Good muffins, next time I will put in double the cranberries or even add some blueberries, i won't change anything else though. Also I had read that the muffins did not rise and I expected flat muffins but mine rised alright and I ended up with nice looking muffins

I replaced half the flour with white whole wheat flour, half the sugar with Splenda and replaced the sour cream with nonfat plain yogurt, and they still came out great.  Also used 1/2 tsp orange extract plus 1/2 tsp vanilla.

I gave this 5 starts with a few changes that others suggested. I used almond extract instead of vanilla. I used walnuts because that is what I had and added two tablespoons of orange juice. I also doubled the amount of cranberries. I make lots of muffins. These were very good!

These are so good! I've made them a couple of times. They rate 5 stars made as written. This time I made a few alterations, and plan on saving as a "custom recipe". I added orange zest to the batter and made a streusel topping out of margarine, white sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and finely chopped pecans. Delicious!

These were very good. I will definately make them again. I followed the recipe exactly with the following changes: Instead of 3/4 c.cranberries, I used 1/2 c. golden raisins, 1/2 c. cranberries, and 1 small apple chopped.  I also added 3 tbs. milk.  Be sure to plump your raisins in warm water for 5 minutes, then drain, before adding them to recipe.

I used vegetable oil instead of butter, added 1 tbsp grated orange peel, a little over 1 cup fresh cranberries and my mom said they were the best muffins she's had all year! I recommend removing the muffins from the pan immediately; that way they are nice and crispy on the outside (and deliciously moist and tender on the inside)

Mmmmm, these are wonderful. I made a few changes - used  non fat plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and half Splenda for part of the sugar. Next time I'm going to use half butter, half fruit puree for the fat. We made these in dark pans with no paper liners, and the sugar carmelized a little in the bottom and that was AWESOME!. Can't wait to make again (probably won't be able to wait more than a couple days. :) )

Absolutely delicious!  I made them with 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar because I only had 1/2 cup white sugar left.  The batter is very thick but these muffins are so moist and delicious!  I did not think they were too sweet.  I will make again and again...

Yummy muffins! Cranberry, pecan and nutmeg is a great flavour combination. Will definitely make these again! I took some of the suggestions and cut the cranberries in half, chopped the pecans quite finely and used half whole wheat flour. Delicious!

These were very good and did rise nicely, not super huge, but certainly not flat! (I think it's important to heed the part of the recipe about stirring in the flour mixture 'just til moistened.') I'm not a big nutmeg fan, so used cinnamon with the sugar for the topping and only a dash of nutmeg in there. I didn't alter the batter at all, and the nutmeg flavor was just right...not too strong! They turned out very nice...moist inside and crunchy on top!

These are delicious.  I made these for a camping trip.  I also added fresh pears to them.  Doubled the recipe and made 12 jumbo muffins.  They were gobbled up.  Even the kids loved them.

I made them just how the recipe reads and they turned out great.  They had huge tops on them and look beautiful on a plate. Be sure your soda and baking powder are fresh and rising should not be a problem.

delish!  the top is crispy and the inside melts in your mouth.  the food processor works great to chop the cranberries and pecans.
