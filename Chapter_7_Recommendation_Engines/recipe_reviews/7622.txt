The first time I made this it was a little dry and not quite what I expected.  The second time I added a little sour cream and evaporated milk to the batter along with about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of reserved pineapple juice.  It was moist & delicious.  Just like my great grandma used to make!

OMG!!!  THIS WAS THE BEST CAKE EVER!!!  I took the advice from other reviews about the batter being to dry and added 1/4 - 1/2 cup of the reserved pineapple juice and about 2 or 3 tablespoons of sour cream. PERFECTION!!!

This is one of the most popular Pineapple Upside-Down Cake on this site. My mother has an easier version where you don't need to beat the egg whites separately. Whisk together whole eggs and sugar until the liquid becomes light yellow and foamy. This means the chemical reaction is almost equivalent to beating the egg whites in the end batter. It is also easier that way when you mix in the dry ingredients to the batter because there is always enough liquids. I also pour the juice from the can on the cake after taking it out of the oven. It makes it so moist and even more pineapple cake.

Used a different cake mixture, as I was afraid of it being too dry from the reviews. My version turned out great, but has to cook a lot longer. Try it if you like. I will try the original recipe next time and revisit my rating. Cake:
Stir together:
1 2/3 + 6 TB flour
1 c. sugar
3 tsp. baking powder
Add:
1 c. milk
6 TB. butter, almost melted
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 tsp. almond extract
1 tsp. vanilla extract (or all of one)
Mix to combine, then beat on med. speed for 1 min. to fluff.  Spoon over pineapple slices.  Bake for 1 hour or till toothpick comes out clean.  Cool 5 minutes before inverting onto platter.  - DELICIOUS!!!

This is a very tasty cake. Mine did come out a little bit tough but that is my fault. I over mixed it. It still came out fluffy. Next time I think I will use vanilla extract and add a little pineapple juice. Now I really don't want to put this but just in case it will save someone else someday... I had the brilliant idea of making this in a bundt pan. Don't Do It!! Unless you want to spend 10 minutes shaking, banging, cussing, and finally pleading with your cake to come out of the pan. I did finally get it out though just wasn't fun or pretty :)

I'm giving this three stars for bad instructions.  I have almost the identical recipe from my mother and it is easier and makes more sense.  Reserve the pineapple juice and add 7 T. of the juice to the batter after you beat the egg yolks WITH THE SUGAR, THEN add the flour and the pineapple juice.  This makes adding the melted butter to the batter totally unnecessary for moisture or flavor.  The egg whites should be whipped alone and folded in at the end.  Also, cake flour is not necessary but you can use it if you wish - it might have a little bit of a finer texture.  I think I had better add my recipe as Old Fashioned Pineapple Upside Down Cake II.

I've used all-purpose flour and also bread flour in this recipes; both work well.  Also, pineapple chunks can be used instead of rings.  Fantastic cake, easy to make.  Delicious!

The recipe makes a decent cake but it's a bit on the dry side. I did add 2 Tbsp. of sour cream after reading other reviews complaining of the same thing. I also used pineapple rings that were packed in 100% juice rather than rings packed in syrup. I will be giving the recipe another chance and using a bit more sour cream because it should be an easy fix. If it doesn't help I'll be moving onto another recipe. EDIT: I gave this cake another go and this time I added an extra tablespoon of sour cream and then once baked I poked the cake with a fork and sprinkled some of the pineapple juice I had reserved over the cake (just enough to moisten in but not soak it like say a tres leches cake) and let it rest until time to serve. This really improved the cake in my opinion.

I have made three of these cakes in less than two weeks. Every time I make it, it disappears and my friends complain that they didn't get any, so I have to make another one.   At first it was alright because I tend not to like cakes that have an eggy taste, but when I made it the second time and there following I used three eggs instead of four. As per another person's suggestion I added sourcream and that helped it be moist. I also added almond extract which was another nice addition. Good cake, this is definitely a staple. The only question I have is how do I make the pineapple's more soft.

This cake tastes good because of the almond extract in it, but it is the consistency of fruit cake--NOT upside down cake. I will never use this recipe again.

This cake is amazing!! I followed the directions exactly, except for adding a bit of pineapple juice and sour cream to batter for moistness, as suggested by other reviewers. My boyfriend and I both loved it, and he was amazed by how delicious and "fluffy" the cake was. Great recipe and easy to whip up. Love that I was able to put my cast iron pan to good use!

Bland. I even added 1/4 c pineapple juice. The cake texture is more like angel food which is ok except that's not how I like my pineapple upside down cake. I did cook it in my cast iron skillet so the listed baking time was correct, I just wasn't crazy about how dry and bland it was. Sorry!

great recipe!  I also used AP flour, and vanilla instead of almond extract, and it was great!  I was in a time crunch, and just creamed it all together, instead of seperating the eggs, and it probably wasn't as fluffy, but still delish!  Thanks!

Seriously one of the best cakes I've ever made. I'm 8 months pregnant and HAD TO HAVE A PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE. I loved making it in my skillet, really made the top/bottom tasty. 

The cake itself is DELICIOUS, and then when you add the brown sugar/butter/fruit topping it's insane. I did add a few splashes of reserved pineapple juice to the cake batter, due to other reviews. It gave the cake a great flavor! 

The cake itself was kind of a PITA to make, took two mixers at once, but totally TOTALLY worth it.

This did not turn out right at all!! There was way too much butter and not enough flour. We cooked it for almost an hour and it was just runny. The top made a crust, but the rest was sick! I'm sure the garbage liked it

Made this for dessert tonight, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The recipe sounded a little dry, so I took the advice of others, and added 1/2 C pineapple juice and 2 big dollops of sour cream (vanilla or plain yogurt would work too).  Only one piece is left, so I'm gonna hide it for tomorrow!!

I used the ingredients as called for in the recipe. I didnt have a cast iron skillet so I placed it in a clear 9x13 glass dish. I had to cook it 45 minutes, but it turned out PERFECT. OMG it was crazy good!

I really liked the way this cake turned out. I will make it again. It was fast and easy to make. Next time I will probably add less white sugar and a little bit of sour cream.

I followed this recipe closely, but made a few minor changes after reading others' changes.  
Reduced the amount of brown sugar at least half.  Used vanilla (that's what I had) instead of almond extract.  No yucky maraschinos.  Added a few large Tbs of yogurt for moistness, folding it into the batter at the end.  I also cut the pineapple into little arches, so they could press together more and cover more surface area.  It looked really nice too!

Overall, a beautiful recipe.  Very light, like a chiffon.  And I loved used my cast iron skillet to bake it in!

we made 3 practice cakes and then we made 6 for our luau themed wedding.  We wanted something different and the reviews were great.  The took the six cakes and made 3 double layer cakes.  We used have the butter and half the sugar for all of them and they were more than sweet enough.  A little advice.  While the cake is cooling brush a shot of rum onto the cake and then flip asap.  If the brown sugar glaze cools while still in the pan it is disastrous.  Another tip was used well drain crushed pine apple instead of rings.  The rings get rubbery and can't compare.  They are pretty for decoration, but you are better off using them sparingly with the cherries.

Yummy. I didn't follow the directions either from laziness or misreading the directions  but used the recipe as close as possible. Cut the recipe down by half for a family of three. Didn't use cake flour used all purpose extra melted butter in the batter with vanilla extract. Did not whip in separate bowl. I mixed together all the dry, then dropped the eggs in, stirred, added the butter and extract. All one bowl done by hand.

5* for posting a great base. Added 1 T sour cream, large farm-fresh eggs, organic everything possible, 12" cast-iron, fresh pineapple, cranberries, baked for abt 40 min. All else as written. Perfection.

This cake is awesome! My husband had a craving for pineapple upside-down cake, so I whipped this one up. He said this cake is the best looking and best tasting pineapple upside-down cake he's ever had! I followed some suggestions and added 1/4 cup of pineapple juice to the batter. I think I'll use 1/3 cup next time for a little extra moisture, but it still tastes perfect. The best part is the caramel-y topping. Fabulous recipe!

This just came out of the oven and it's so good!  This is a perfect old fashioned upside down cake.  It was light and spongy and very sweet:)  I did add about 1/4 c. of sour cream but other than that I followed the recipe as is.  Next time I think I'll add a can of crushed pineapple to the batter for extra pineapple flavor.

Very Good and reminded me of my childhood, only I think it is better than what my mom made!  I used crushed pineapple instead of slices and also added 1/4 cup of juice to the batter.

This was such a delicious recipe!  I used a nonstick cake pan in lieu of a skillet and that made everything fool proof when flipping the cake over.  All of my guests loved it!

I have made this cake a couple of times now and my family loves it.  The first time I made it exactly like the recipe and it was a hit with my husband and in-laws.  Tonight I used fresh pineapple and added coconut on top of that.  I only used 3/4 cups of granulated sugar.  I also added coconut extract instead of the almond and a couple of tablespoons of plain yogurt to make it a little more moist.  This version was my favorite!  But following the recipe exactly is 5 stars!

I always wanted to make a baked item in my cast iron skillet.  Thank-you so much for this recipe.  My cake came out perfectly and the only thing I changed is that I used organic butter, fresh pineapple and organic sugar.  Love it!

This cake is awesome! Reminds me of how my grandmother's pineapple upside down cake use to taste. I did take the advice of another reviewer and added pineapple juice and some sour cream to the mix. Plus I added a bit more brown sugar. I have a sweet tooth :) plus my husband said he thought it needed more brown sugar. All in all this was by far the best cake.

The best pineapple upside-down cake I've ever tasted. Light, sweet and buttery. I made it just as the recipe stated. I changed nothing. It wasn't dry at all. Will definitely bake this one again.

Made exactly per recipe.  (If you didn't follow the recipe exactly, don't review it......and don't knock it!).  This is a fabulous upside-down cake.  It makes a beautiful batter, and the finished cake is delicious, absolutely delicious.  May be slightly (I said slightly) harder than making one with a cake mix, but if you value the taste of a home-made cake, this is easier than pie.  And very pretty, too.  Got rave reviews from all who got a piece; one man said it was as "wonderful" as his grandmother's, who also made hers in a skillet, and that was my reward!  Thank you for a "wonderful" recipe.

I just made this cake and had a piece, I love it!!! I too like followed the suggestions of others and added 3 tablespoons of sour cream and a 1/2 cup of pineapple juice.  The cake was very moist.  I used fresh pineapple but will take others suggestions and try crushed next time.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This came out fabulous! I used a 13x9" pan. My only changes were adding a bit of reserved pineapple juice and using regular all-purpose flower because I didn't have cake flower. I also added walnuts around the pineapples. 

Because of the size of the pan, it was a very "short" cake. It did not rise much if at all while baking. The flour I used might have also contributed.

Because of the added juice, it was hard to tell that the cake was done baking because it was bubbling. I baked it an extra 10 or 15 minutes, but it was not overcooked.

This was fantastic. It was a lot more complex than anything I usually bake, but it was well worth the work. It was just as good as the cake my grandma used to make, and she made the best pineapple upside down cake I've ever eaten.

Thank you for this recipe!!

Passed the test - Uncle who wants PUC just the way his mother made it - says, "Delicious." It was beautiful - like a magazine photo. I used a cast iron skillet and covered all spaces around the pineapple with cherries. I added about a 1/2 cup of pineapple juice, because I prefer a pineapple-y taste in the cake(I would have done this anyway, not necessarily due to other reviewer's comments). The cake released perfectly and was quite moist with excellent flavor. The pineapple caramelized beautifully. I would have been proud to take this cake to any event. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

So easy and so yummy.  My 12 year old daughter made this with little help from Mom. I like that you can make it in a skillet that you melt the butter in, one less pan to wash.

I made this is a 9x13 pan also - it worked out really well.  I also used chunked pineapple because that's all I had on hand, and no cherries because my fiance doesn't like them.  If you add a little of the drained pineapple juice into the batter, it makes it VERY moist!  Yummy.

Passes the muster at the Fire Station. Can use all purpose flour. Have used peaches also. I would recommend using the recipe as directed. Much better than using a cake mix. So easy to get out of a cast iron skillet.

I followed the recipe, and it turned out wonderful!! Moist and Delicious. I made minor additions; added 2 tablespoons of pineapple juice while beating the yolks, and sprinkled some walnuts between the pineapple rings. My husband and i loved this recipe, very light and fluffy. Thanks for sharing.

This cake was exceptional!  Very moist, it didn't last 20 minutes.  I used fresh pineapple and had more than I needed so I added more in the middle by adding 1/2 the batter and then an additional layer of pineapple.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe.

Luscious! I followed the recipe, except used half vanilla and half almond extract and used my 10" cast iron skillet to bake it in. The cake is  so flavorful (way better than a box cake). Next time I may try cooking the brown sugar and butter a little before adding the fruit to see if the syrup will get crunchy in the end.

Made this for a friend for her birthday.  I am allergic to tree nuts so I did substitute vanilla for the almond extract, but it was yummy still.  I love how light and fluffy it seemed which was surprising with as dense as the batter ended up being.  Very pretty presentation also.

Great cake! Although I accidentally used self-raising flour instead of cake flour, it turned out awesome! (thank god, while the cake was baking i was washing the dishes and suddenly realized i used self-raising flour instead..) I also used fresh pineapple slices instead and added around 1/4 cup of reserved canned pineapple tidbits juice to the batter for a more moist cake.

Cake was great. I reccomend cutting the amount of brown sugar and butter in half. Its only job is as the glaze at the top of the cake and it tastes and looks just as great with only half. Also, it really adds a great pineapple flavor if you brush the excess pineapple juice on the  top of the cake before you flip it.

Yes . First time making this  recipe came out beautifully. I did use the suggestions, of using the pineapple juice reserve. Nice and  moist.

Made it exactly as instructed and it was perfect. So fluffy and light and moist. I really worked to be light handed with the whites and folded them carefully with the flour (sifted!) and yolk mixture .... just as one does when making Macarons and the "batter" reminded me of Macaron batter -- kind of chunky but thoroughly (but barely) combined. I think that was the magic ... and made the batter angel food cake-like. I didnt love the lack of caramelization on the bottom but I placed the pan on an upper rack. Next time I'll place it on a lower rack and suspect that'll do the trick.

This recipe was lite and fluffy! I only had crushed pineapple so that's what I used.. I didn't find that it was too sweet. And it had a yummy buttery flavour that wasn't overpowering. This took me right back to my Nanna's kitchen when I was a little girl. Overall pretty tasty recipe! I did however cut the almond extract in half because that stuff is powerful!

Pretty good - I made a few changes as suggested by some of hte other reviewers and a few of my own - everyone liked it even the pick eater in the family.

I only used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar (next time may even reduce the white to 1/4 cup) and creamed with 1/2 cup butter then added egg substitute as I don't eat eggs.

Egg substitute - 1 tbs ground flax seesds and 3tbs of water mixed and left for 15 mins (this makes the equivalent of 1 egg - just double up for more eggs!)

I also used 3 cups of pineapple chunks instead of rings (didn't have any rings).

Substituted vanilla extract for the almond.

Also added another 1/2 cup of the pineapple juice into the mix before blending with the flour etc..but didn't add any yoghurt or cream as suggested by a few reviewers simply because I don't eat either.

The cake took approx 35 mins at 350 in fan assisted oven.

It didn't rise as much as I had hoped so may need to adjust the baking soda a little but I also live at a really high altitude so any baking is a challenge.

I will make this again - the kids really loved it and it was super moist!

At first, seeing there weren't liquids to add,I wondered if it would be dry. No,it was not dry. It was fluffy, most and delicious.... ALOT better than a boxed cake! My 14 year old son expressed his really liking it too. This is definitely a keeper!

Wonderful recipe. This recipe has been around for years.  It's just like my mothers and she's 92. She continues to bake it in her old cast iron skillet.  She got away from using the original cake mix by scratch and started using a white/vanilla cake mix, follow directions on box.  You can still use pineapple juice in the cake mix. I'm assuming if you wanted to, you could use a little cream cheese; personally I've never used it and the cake was delicious. Sometimes, my mother would change up the cherries with halved Walnuts or Pecans, either way it's still good.

This was very good and moist. I did follow the directions, whipping the yolks and whites separate. If you do this step this will give your cake fluff and keep it moist. I did omit the second round of butter, added 1/4 cup of reserved pineapple juice to the already whipped yolks, and reduced the 1 cup of sugar to 1/2 cup. I also added a tablespoon of sour cream to the already whipped yolks as well. Baked in a 13x9 pan for 30 minutes and it was perfect.

I added about 1/2 cup of the pineapple juice like everyone says to do.  I um, only had a 9" pan and that wasn't a good idea.  It overflowed and took longer to bake, as you can imagine.  It was amazing though, and my fiancee ate the entire cake (standing up) when he got home and he didn't even notice the faint smell of burnt cake coming from the oven!

This turned out wonderfully!  Followed the suggestions of adding 2-3 Tbsp sour cream and about 1/4 cup or so of the pineapple juice to the mixture.  The batter was a little bit more trouble to make than a usual cake (with separating the eggs, and folding everything together) and the texture was a bit strange, but my finished product was very moist and tasty.  Worked great baking in the cast iron skillet too!

AWESOME! I also added about 1/4 cup of Pineapple juice to the mix with the Almond flavoring and butter. I sprinkled just a little Brown sugar on the top before putting it in the over to add sweetness to the bottom crust.

I read a lot of Pineapple Upside Down Cake recipes before I settled on this one. I had made one similar years before with a recipe from a Southern living magazine. I made this exactly as written (I think you should to rate it properly.) except I did not add the last T. of butter...did not have anymore. Anyway, I'm not sure what I expected but this was not it. Beating the egg whites then folding in the yellows and flour mixture made a strange looking batter, to me. When I checked it at 30 min.s the batter was still very liquidy, turned oven up to 350 and cooked 5 more min.s. It was done. Tasted ok warm from the oven...not so good later. Wasn't a big hit at my house. May just us a recipe with a mix next time. I love pineapple and still want to make a good one.

This was a great recipe. I love the fact that you can read the reviews of other people before making it yourself! I did not want mine to be dry so I added a little pinapple and cherry juice as well as about a half cup of crushed pinapple in at the end and it came out fantastic!

Outstanding recipe, change nothing! Just don't over mix.  I cooked mine in a cake pan and it was fantastic, best PUDC ever! The flavor is amazing and the spongy texture is a delight.  Much better than plain cake.

Easier than I expected & It turned out GREAT!! My whole family loved it. I used a springform cake pan lined with parchment paper (super easy clean-up) and pre-melted butter.

Really, really delicious cake.  Made no changes whatsoever, and it was perfect.  Maybe the folks who said it was too dry didn't use cake flour, as the recipe calls for.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is not cook it as long--every oven is different, but 30 minutes was a tad too long, so I'll try 25 next time.  I also might increase the amount of butter/brown sugar for the topping, but that's just personal preference.  I served this to a couple of dyed-in-the-wool chocolate-loving men, and they raved about it!

I followed the reciepe exactly except I used vanilla instead of almond extract.  Took about 40 minutes to cook in the cast iron, came out looking great and tasted great, will cook this one again.

This was a delicous recipe.  I was searching for something to make and stumbled upon this.  I thought that it would be rather eggy when I saw that it called for so many eggs, but it really wasn't.  I am thrilled to add this to my collection.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

Ended up taking closer to an hour to set up. I used strawberries instead of pineapple since the market is flooded. I also used 50/50 whole wheat and white flour and a bit of cornstarch instead of cake flour, and increased baking powder to 1-1/2 tsp - usually this combination works well to replace cake flour and if anything runs a bit on the dry side, but apparently not today... smells wonderful though and tastes great. Worth the wait.

Perfect! Followed the recipe except I used all purpose flour, fresh pineapple, added 1/2c sour cream after mixing all the other ingredients, and increased cooking time to 45min.

I've only made this cake with this recipe once before and I'm going to surprise my husband with it when he comes home from work, but the first time I made this cake recipe it did turn out dry so I'm going to do what some of you had suggested and use some of the reserved pineapple juice, but other than that it is a really good cake. I also use my cast iron skillet and it's so good...thank you...

I make this a lot. It is SO GOOD. I got a big beautiful cast iron skillet for Xmas last year and immediately made this. I have found that the amt of butter is the perfect amount- any more and it falls apart.

My dad loves Pineapple Upsidedown cake and I lost my old recipe and this one suits him just fine.  Having to beat the eggs and then fold in the ingredients is a little more time consuming than other recipes, but it seems to be worth the effort!

Great recipe!  I didn't have pineapples though, I used regular apples instead, thinly sliced, and it STILL turned out delicious!  Will keep this one forever.  The bake time was perfect.

We doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 dish.  We had to extend baking time.  But it turned out wonderful!  The almond extract really makes the cake flavorful.  A very good recipe!

This is THE BEST pineapple upside-down cake I have ever made or eaten!  I really wanted a cake recipe that didn't call for a boxed cake mix.  This one came out perfectly.  I, too, used my iron skillet.  I made two small additions:  I folded 1/4 cup of pineapple juice and 1/4 cup of sour cream into the egg whites along with the yolks and flour mixture.  My cake needed about 40 minutes to cook, but it came out just right.  This recipe requires a little more work than using a recipe that calls for a boxed cake mix, but it is SO worth it!

This pineapple cake is very good. A little time consuming with the egg beatings and such but it is worth it. The cake has a very light texture...my favorite part. And of course sweet hubbies favorite part is all the sugar top part. I will be making this again.

I was so surprised to not find any recipes, other than this one, on this site for a pineapple cake from scratch. I was not very excited to try it, but wanted to make my husband a pineapple upside-down cake for his birthday and didn't want to use a boxed mix. I was surprised it hadn't been reviewed more. I made it as stated, but added to the batter: 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup pineapple juice, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of the juice that the cherries came in (smells like almond). I was out of almond extract. This produced a very moist cake, which was my main concern because a lot of people said it was too dry. I will definitely add these additions in the future! A few things to mention: I had no idea how long it would take for the egg whites to form stiff peaks (at least 10 minutes!), never heard of beating egg yolks (but was glad I did, because the cake turned out great), and baked it for 50 minutes in a cast iron skillet (my mom, an avid baker, warned me over the phone it would burn -- but it didn't, the edges and the middle were the same consistent, light brown). It inverted beautifully onto a glass plate. My husband LOVED it, as did my kids. Definitely a great recipe. Definitely a keeper. Even better served with "Sweetened Whipped Cream" (on allrecipes). Mmm!

Big hit at my house! I did follow the recipe which was different... added a little extra pineapple juice to the batter as reviewers suggested and I always swap oil (or in this case the tbsp of melted butter for the batter) for applesauce... it reallly adds moisture to cakes. Everything came out great.. thanks for sharing an old recipe!!

I've made this recipe exactly as written for several years now.  My family loves it.  I've seen a lot of reviews that are not happy with the batter before baking.  When you fold in the yolks and dry ingredients you have to keep folding it until it is blended evenly.  If you are putting it into the oven with yolk stripes and dry flour your cake isn't going to come out.  Also, I use a skillet but it's not cast iron and it takes longer than 35 minutes to bake, probably closer to 45-50 minutes.  I really love this cake!

The cake portion of this recipe was not clear to me, and I'm an experienced cook.  I did not/do not understand how the egg yolks and flour mixture are combined with the egg whites. I have never added dry ingredients directly to egg whites before, so I am baffled as to how this batter is prepared.  I mixed the egg yolks with the dry ingredients and then folded that in to the egg whites, but that didn't produce a batter with texture I'm used to seeing for cakes.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Since I've never made pineapple upside down cake before, I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 (since I didn't have something to compare it to). But it was really good.

I did make a couple of changes - I used peaches instead. Yummm! I also used vanilla instead of almond, but next time I'll try the almond to compare. 

The other thing I did was use a cake pan instead of a skillet. The batter was a little too much for the pan, and it spilled over a bit (luckily, I used a cookie sheet under it!). So I would recommend using the skillet as recipe called for, or a larger pan.

The texture of my cake reminded me of a macaroon cookie - kind of crunchy on the outside edges and spongy in side. I liked that, but don't know whether it was supposed to be like that or not for sure. Maybe the way you fold the egg yolks into the egg whites makes a difference in the final texture. Duno. Will make it again and see if it comes out the same. But again, I really liked the taste of this recipe!

I made a few variations of this recipe. I had been looking for a pineapple upside down cake that used a skillet to bake it in, since that is what I remembered my Mother using.
I was in a time crunch, so I used two pineapple flavored cake mixes, but followed the recipe otherwise (doubled it) I used my very large cast iron skillet; filled it almost 3/4 full;  didn't use all of the batter from the two cake mixes, but then I had batter left over for cupcakes! The cake turned out WONDERFUL! Very moist, easy to remove from skillet, and large enough for everyone to have 2 peices-plus!  This is definatly a 'keeper' recipe as far as our family goes!

Wonderful recipe, although being an angel food cake it's a little dry.  I added a bit too much almond extract but it still turned out well.  Next time might add a little more salt.

We followed the recipe to the letter (I say we because it was a joint effort with hubby) and I can honestly say this is the best pineapple upsidedown cake I've ever made. It was definitely not dry. This was a spur of the moment project, so we didn't have maraschino cherries (don't care for them anyway) instead we sprinkled pecans into the butter/brown sugar mixture and it came out great. This is definitely a keeper.

Best pineapple upside down cake I've ever made. I followed the suggestions of others and added 1/3 c of the reserved pineapple juice and a dollop of sour cream. I did follow the directions and beat the egg yellows and whites separately. I also didn't have almond extract and used vanilla. Nor did I have brown sugar and added a Tbsp of maple syrup to white sugar. It worked well and it gave great flavor.  I will make this again and again!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  Deliciously moist, soft and sweet as it should be.  I followed the recipe as written for the most part, but  I cut the sugar amounts down and baked in a 9x10 inch glass pan.  After reading the reviews, I was prepared to add moisture into the batter but it was fine. I used large eggs. That could have made the difference.  I questioned adding in the egg whites before the flour but it didn't make any difference.  It was a little more time consuming because of whipping the egg whites but worth the time.  I will definitely make this again. Thank you for the old fashioned recipe!

I did not care for this recipe.  It was much too sweet, and the almond extract just overpowered the entire cake.

I wasn't wild on the texture of this recipe. It was more meringue than cake. It just wasn't what I expected. I should've known, given that the egg whites were beaten to stiff peaks, but I thought possibly the yolks and flour would transform it into a light airy cake. Instead, it was a gloppy mess. The taste was delicious, but the texture ruined the "cake."

OK I am making this cake now. I will cut the sugar down a bit, add 2 tablespoons of sour cream and add 1/4-1/3 cup of pineapple juice to the batter. Problem is I don't have a mixer so will try whipping it with a whisk. Wish me luck, I hope it works! Also my cast iron skillet is only 10 inches, crossing fingers.
Update:  I made this with two exceptions: I cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup and just before folding in the  melted butter/almond extract I added the 2 tablespoons of sour cream and the 1/3 cup pineapple juice to the batter. It was delicious!

Way to much sugar, this is the first receipe I have been disappointed with, and way to much butter. I will tweek it and maybe it will be good, but we don't like so much sugar, all you could taste is sugar, sorry, but just being honest. Thank you anyways, LEE

i really like cooking with a cast iron skillet and was excited to make this but not super excited about the results. i don't like the grainy brown sugar in the finished cake - i prefer recipes that heat the butter and sugar together to make a sweet, smooth, buttery, drippy caramel and i'd prefer to use a different cake recipe next time and about double the cake to topping ratio here. my family happily ate this cake but... still looking for an awesome old fashioned pineapple upside down cake.

made this last night for my wife's birthday. i made the recommended changes (1/4 cup pineapple juice and 2 tablespoons of yogurt(we don't have sour cream here)) and the cake part was awesome. it was very light and moist. i only gave this recipe 4 stars though because of the sweetness. next time i will reduce the sugar content by about a 1/3 (especially the brown sugar). but definitely a recipe worth keeping.

This was my first try at this cake. It needed 25 more minutes of bake time and the cake turned out like a dense angel food cake. The middle fell in and kinda came apart a bit when I flipped it over. Apperence aside all my co-workers said it was very good (sweet but good). Next time I will use less brown sugar and add some of the pineapple juice in the cake batter.

I converted this to gluten free by substituting Gluten Free Mama's Almond  blend flour for the cake flour.  Also added 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup pineapple juice to the batter before spreading on the pineapple slices and cherries.  This cake is superb!  Just like I remember my mom making when I was a kid.  Although hers were never gluten free (wasn't necessary back then).  You can't go wrong with this one!

Oh Yeah!! This is not dry IF you sift as you measure the flour- instead of the other way around, as the recipe states. It is light and delicious. I used 1/2 Splenda in the batter and you couldn't tell, and I'm not a big Splenda fan.  Even though I am a fan of almond, I thought the tsp. might be too much; nope!  Oh,I did need to add 8 min. to cooking time, but I did use very low heat to melt my butter.

I had never made a pineapple upside down cake before I tried this recipe.  I found that it was very easy to follow, and after reading some of the other reviews, I added 1/4 c. of the reserved pineapple juice.  It turned out very moist and very good!  The only problem I had with this recipe is that it did take MUCH longer to bake than the 30-35 minutes noted.  It actually took 45 minutes or so, in my oven.  Other than that, excellent cake!

I used green and red marischino cherrier and pecan halves in the spaces around the pineapple rings.  A little rum in the brown sugar-butter mixture is good too.  I used lemon zest and/ or lemon extract in the cake mix.

I was so looking forward to this, and it's a disaster.  I cooked it about 30 minutes extra and it's flat and still not cooked throughout.  I doublechecked that I used all the ingredients in the right measurements.  Not sure what went wrong, but now I don't have a cake to take to the picnic tomorrow... A warning to anyone wanting to try, read all reviews.  Upon second look, it seems like the only ones that worked out had added additional ingredients.  I was not cautious enough I guess.

Used a 12inch skillet, since that's all I had. Added 1/2c pineapple juice and 1/3c shredded coconut. Wow, it was not what we were hoping for. Took an hour to set up, tasted raw in the middle and hard like a hockey puck on the outside. Also, the pineapple floated up to the top. Probably my biggest baking disaster

This cake was OK. I had wayyyyy too much sugar in it. If i do it again i would cut the sugar for the topping in HALF! and maby use 3/4 cup sugar in the cake itself. I found the cake had an interesting constiency after being baked. It was not heavy at all nor was it dry but i cant say i really liked it. Both of my parents loved it and I found that the cake tastes better now it's 2 days old. Oh by the way I added in a little pineapple juice, 1/2 teaspoon lime juice to the eggs, a cap full of amaretto, and a bit of nutmeg and cinnamom to the cake to ensure there was no bland cake!

My DH made this as a surprise because he knows how much I love pineapple u/cake. I can't rate any higher then a 3 because the almond extract ruined the flavor for me. I might try it using vanilla extract.

I added pecan halfs between the pine apple slices. Adds a pleasant nutty flavor. You can also use walnut halfs.

I made it in a spring form pan. So i melted the butter sugar mix separately, but recipe is delicious and beautiful, the almond extract can also be substituted for coconut for a delicious pina colada cake.

Used a fresh pineapple vs canned. As other reviewers suggested, I added  2-3 Tbsp sour cream and leftover pineapple juice. As a result, extra cooking time was required (approx 10 min).
Cake was delicious. Will definitely make it again!

Be careful or be comfortable with your skills, I feared it was not done and cooked it longer than I should have and fortunately it is a forgiving cake given the moisture from the pineapples

Pretty good - made some adjustments - used fresh pineapples soaked in dark rum - added a little ginger and cinnamon on the cake mix - and used macadamia nuts instead of maraschino cherries - was almost as good as moms

The only thing I would change is letting it wait longer than 5 minutes to take it out of the pan cause mine kinda just...melted? Than again, this was my first time making pineapple upside down cake so I had no clue what to expect.

I made this recipe and it was amazing! I followed the advice in the reviews and added a bit of sour cream and the pineapple juice to the cake and just a hint of cinnamon in the topping. It came out totally moist and wonderful. If I make it again I would probably half the brown sugar though the topping was Intensely sweet but that's just a matter of preference.

NONE! Perfectly as I remember this fun old fashioned recipe, and I tempted to add some dark rum, like my friend had suggested along with some ginger, but so glad I didn't!

We made it in a stainless steel deep dish frying pan.  I double the batter and stuff but left the topping the same.  It did take 20 min more to finish baking and was thicker than the video showed.

I followed the recipe to the tee and it came out great. I prefer it warm, so I microwave it for 10 seconds when I make a slice and it makes it perfect. I would maybe add pineapple juice to the mix next time, but definitely worth making again.

I followed the advice of one of the reviewers and added a bit (1/4 cup) of the pineapple juice. Otherwise followed the recipe for a very tasty outcome!  Yummy, moist, delicious.  (I broke the recipe down into two small pie dishes for baking - no adjustment to amounts, just split everything into the two pie dishes.)

This recipe is awesome. My cake ended up really delish. The almond extract definitely was a great addition and pretty much was the overriding flavor, and since I prefer  almond flavor over pineapple, it totally worked out! I did use APF, not cake flour. More crumbly than a fine texture, which is also how I prefer it. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my son. He requested another one! I added 3 Tbsp. pineapple juice due to reviews concerning dryness of cake. Used vanilla extract. No need for almond extract. It's all all about the the pineapple.

It took 20 more minutes to bake, but it turned out quite well.

Didn’t have a cast iron pan, so I used a casserole dish that was not quite 9 x 13.  It was delicious and looked so pretty!

So I took the advice of other reviews and added about 2 tbsp sour cream, a little more flour and a cup of pineapple juice from the sliced pineapple. I also just whisked the eggs all together and added the ingredients from there. I don’t have an electric mixer but I put my little helpers to whisk for five minutes ?? I also used a bundt cake pan. This took 45 minutes at 350 degrees. Overall, I would say it’s a good cake. Not fabulous. But good. It’s too much egg in my opinion.

This is delicious.  It’s very important to use actual cake flour.  I don’t have to add anything extra as this is so moist and yummy.

I was excited to make this because the reviews were so great, but I found it to be pretty underwhelming. It looked nice and inverted very easily, but the cake itself was pretty bland. The almond extract was a nice addition, but I think it should have called for less, as it was almost overpowering. Also, I should have known that without any pineapple or pineapple juice in the actual cake itself, the flavor would be lacking. Although I’m now seeing others suggestions to add sour cream (yes, it was dry too), I still think the flavor was problematic enough to just go back to my previous recipe.

This cake came out great ! I didn't have any baking powder, but it still has a nice, fluffy texture. I also added about a tablespoon of pineapple juice from the tin. Lovely ! Can't wait to make another one.

My husband and I absolutely love this Pineapple Upside Down Cake...! I've made it so many times, sometimes just for the two of us. It always goes down very well. The only thing I change is the flour (gluten free blend instead) and leave out the cherries, not a fan of those. Occasionally when a moist cake is called for and I've not had pineapple to hand, I've used apples, too-soft pears and even canned peaches. All turned out well but the pineapple is by far the best!

I made this for my husband on his birthday. It was his favorite as a kid growing up. I made it with whole wheat flour, coconut oil and cut the sugar a bit. WOW! It has an amazing texture. It was sweet, but not super sweet like a store bought or box cake. I am making it again this year. I have selfish motives. I love it!

I took the advise of "Valrush" with adding 2-3 T. of sour cream and the reserved 1/4-1/2 cup pineapple juice and it was absolutely fantastic and the most beautiful of cakes.  Thanks for sharing "Cathy" the original creator!

I made the recipe as stated, except my family prefers apricots, and didn't use my cast iron skillet. (I recently moved and have not found it yet!).  This took considerably longer to bake than stated and was quite bland.  Won't  bother to tweak it, and won't make it again, but will go back to my previous recipe.  Was not a hit at home....

Divine! I added 1/2 cup pineapple juice as suggested, as well as an all purpose flour/cornstarch mix in place of cake flour. It turned out wonderfully! The only this I will say is it leaks like crazy out of a regular cake pan, be sure to put a cookie sheet underneath if you use one!

I changed it to be vegan by replacing eggs with applesauce (1/4 cup for each egg) I also used strawberries instead of cherries and vegan butter. Was the 1st time I ever made a cake like this and it was amazing .

This was amazing! Prepared exactly as directed. Took about 10 minutes longer to cook than listed, but I was using a 10in cast iron skillet. I make pineapple upside cake regularly for my husband and I've never cared for it until this recipe!

A decent Pineapple Upside - Down Cake recipe. For me, there's no other way to make one, except in cast iron.  If you have this craving, this is a recipe that won't let you down.

Excellent- can't go wrong with a well seasoned cast iron skillet. 
I even used crushed rather than sliced pineapple. I'll use it again next time.

Excellent cake for a quick dessert. I used vanilla extract in place of almond extract, and no cherries. I was concerned about it being to dry so I used half a cup of pineapple juice as well.

The recipe is perfection but like most people I added about 2T of sour cream and a few splashes of pineapple juice to the batter and oh my!! The cake was moist and the topping was delicious! Unfortunately, I did not have an electric mixer and didn’t want to use a blender to whip the egg whites so I whipped it by hand. Unless you’re  into getting in a bicep exercise to burn a few calories before eating this scrumptious cake[i guarantee you will eat more than one slice], I suggest using the electric mixer. Before turning the cake over I poured a few tablespoons of pineapple juice over the cake. I made it for a BBQ and it was the highlight of the night and completely devoured. I will definitely be making this cake again... and again.. and again!

Grandma must have had arms like a lumberjack. I gave up on that wire whisk after a few minutes and threw whole thing in my KitchenAid mixer and it took it 5 minutes to beat that into anything that looked like cake batter. It's cooking now but what a mess. Several dirty bowls and since I'm old and worn out I'm sitting down for a while after that. Just guessing that half a cup of butter is way too much. If I get around to it I'll let you know if it was any good. When you mix the egg yolks and flour it looks like the beginning of a pie dough and takes forever to mix into the egg whites. That's why I used my mixer. Hope I didn't screw it up.

 after making a mess of the kitchen and spilling the first cup of flour all over the floor trying to do too many things at once it came out spectacular. I read one of the reviews where she poured some of the pineapple juice over the cake before turning it over and did that. Shared it with the neighbors and it's a hit. Next time I might add a little more liquid and do the eggs all at once thing. Read about that in another review. Really good. Changing my rating to five.
Oh yeah, it took another 10 or 15 minutes to cook. I'm at 5000 feet. Don't know what difference that makes but FYI.

This made the Best Pineapple upside-sidedown cake! I made it in a square baking pan but everything else, I followed the recipe. It's the old style Pineapple upside down cake and what a difference!

I used raw cane sugar instead of granulated white sugar, and swapped the maraschino cherries for dried bing cherries for texture and a little less intense sweetness. It turned out amazing and I'll definitely make again.

This is a successful recipe Kathy! I can tell just by reading the directions you prepared this cake with love which is what I did and it was absolutely delicious. I did add 1/2 cup whipping cream for an  even richer taste. (The recipe is already rich, but I always tweak recipes for my own authentic taste). However, anybody can follow directions to a recipe, but if you don't prepare it with love and patience I assure you it will not be as delicious. Thumbs up Kathy!

The texture was very nice with the fruit, firm enough not to be soggy and a little crisp around the edges (which we liked). It was a little too sweet for our taste, so I would cut the white sugar a little next time, maybe down to 1/2 or 3/4 cup.

Absolutely marvelous cake. Perfect from the recipe, the only thing I did was add walnuts to the top when baking which translates to the bottom of the finished cake. We love nuts.

I made the cake and it looked beautiful...BUT it was not good.  I wish I had read the reviews first.  I followed the directions to a tee... and ended up with a dry, boring cake. I will not make it again!

I don't remember the cake of pineapple upside down cake being like angel food cake but this one was. I should have assumed that I guess based on the eggs when reading the recipe but still was surprised the cake itself wasn't more substantial. Will have to keep looking to find the cake I remember, although this was still good.

Following other users' advice, I added the pineapple juice to the mixture that was included in canned pineapple rings I bought.  Because there were so many eggs and little flour, I wondered how it would turn out -- souffle-like vs. cake-like?  

I underbaked it in the cast iron pan by about 5 minutes and it looked done.  Like a souffle.  I let it cool for 5 minutes and then inverted it onto a plate.  We weren't having it until the next day, so I refrigerated it overnight.  Because it was souffle-like, I think it would be better to eat it immediately before it deflates (like mine did somewhat), but it still tasted surprisingly delicious, moist, and cake-like.  Who knew?  Everyone even had seconds, so there wasn't much to keep for leftovers!

well here goes . first i did not have pineapple slices so i used crushed, then i didn't have almond extract i used vanilla, then i couldn't whip up the egg whites the best i got was sloppy peaks, then i couldn't whip egg yolks to thick those where more like water. i did put the pineapple juice and sour cream in it as others suggested. so with all this mishap there was no sense in being gentle about putting it all together, i thought forget that just stir it, so i did. when done it was so moist and Delicious, i could not believe it. so there you have it, make it don't worry about it just put it together and enjoy.

This turned out perfect for me. the ONLY thing I might change next time is leaving out the almond extract. The first time I made it, I thought it might be the cherries giving that sweet "cherry" flavor to the cake, but when I was adding it to the batter this time, I realized what it was. I personally like it, but my husband isn't a fan. Next time, I will forgo that and add a bit of the reserve pineapple juice (as another reviewer suggested.) I had no trouble with the moistness of the cake. 

OH! and it came out of my cast iron skillet like MAGIC!

The cake isn't the texture of a cake like from a mix its different but supper good.  My husband looved it and so did everyone else at home.  I didn't change anything except a tiny bit less sugar because I feel most deserts have too much, but it was really good.  I would have made two if I knew it would be this good!

Substituted Rhubarb (sliced 1/2", tossed with 1/4 c sugar the night before, drained off the syrup it created, saved for a sauce) 
Melted the butter in skillet, added the brown sugar, laid the rhubarb slices in one layer close together on top of the melted brown sugar. I used less white sugar, maybe  3/4 cup, beaten into the egg whites. I had leftover rhubarb slices so I cooked them in the microwave in the syrup, maybe 2 minute, till soft.  We used that for sauce over yogurt over the cake. Rave reviews from all.

Hubby said it taste like his grandmothers. We did omit the butter in the batter and used a heaping tbs of sour cream and oz or so orange juice.  Will make again.

I really love this cake. I don't have an iron skillet so I had to make some adjustments. I am not sure if using a nine inch cake pan rather than a ten inch skillet really makes that much of a difference but I did have to reduce the butter and brown sugar; otherwise, it was way too liquidy. I used 5 tbsp of butter and 3/4 cup of brown sugar. The pineapple adds extra liquid as well. I tried adding sour cream and pineapple juice the first time I made this and it just added to the overall too much liquid factor and the second and third time I left the juice out of the batter (but kept a little sour cream). I just keep making this again and again. Totally five stars with the topping liquid reduced.

This cake was delicious! The only thing I did in addition to following recipe was added about 1/4 cup of the pineapple juice to the batter. It was nicely moist and turned out of  my cast iron dutch oven really nice! I was very pleased about that! Looks pretty on the cake stand. Was a big hit for our dessert after our Easter dinner. Will make this recipe again.

The kids loved it! I added some sour cream in the dough and a little bit of the pineapple juice and if turned out great. By the way- used fresh pineapples and they were just as good.

The cake came out perfect but I am not sure if it is because I use real almond extract, but the flavor was overpowering.  Next time I will try vanilla.

Tried this yesterday, it was amazing.  I used a large skillet and it wouldn't take the 12 slices of pineapple so I filled in the gaps with blackberries and cherries.  Served with English custard and double cream.

I added the sour cream and pineapple juice as others suggested. It was an alright cake, just kind of strange. The egg whites give it a weird flan or frittata texture and I found it way too sweet. Not a fan. But my husband loved it.

Because I read reviews saying the cake is dry and offering some solutions -- I, too, added 2 tbsp of sour cream and 1/4 cup of pineapple juice to the batter (as well as 1 tsp of vanilla). The cake was very well-received. My fiancé and I ate half of it in one evening. I used a 10" glass-bottom springform pan and it slid out effortlessly. I did, however, need an extra 15 minutes of baking (perhaps due to adding more wet ingredients to the batter).

I made this cake and it was moist and delicious. Only 4 star because I made some adjustments base on other reviews. So here is what I did add it 1/4 cup of juice from pineapple, cream the yolks with the pineapple juice and 1/2 teaspoon almond vanilla and 1/2  regular vanilla  mixed the flour with the cream yolks first , then add it the egg white and melted butter other then that I use the same recipe just make sure don't over mix and it will be perfect. This is a keeper. Thanks.

I made this recipe according to the directions and it turned out delicious. I noticed the written directions were off so I watched the video. I think the amounts for the butter were off in the text. Also, I made my own cake flour by mixing 3/4 + 2 Tbsp Flour + 2 Tbsp Corn Starch m Anyway, the cake turned out moist and the topping sweet caramel.

This cake was not the easiest to make, but it tasted yummy! I followed the directions exactly and after 30 minutes  I checked on it and it was still VERY undercooked. I ended up cooking it for about 50 minutes on 325. The batter was JUST the right amount for the cast iron skillet. The cake slipped right out of the pan when it was done too. Light and fluffy! I rate this a 4 because it is a bit on the sweet side and, I felt the timing was way off. THANK YOU!!

Delicious! Made a few changes though -I took one reviewer's advice and put a few tablespoons of evaporated milk and 1/4c pineapple juice to add more moisture since I saw some people were complaining this was too dry -also baked it in a 9x13 glass dish since I don't have a skillet and used vanilla extract instead of almond. I was worried while it was baking since the top was becoming hard yet the juices would come up when I pressed down on the cake. After 30 min the batter was definitely not done so I turned the temp down to about 300 and baked for another 10-15 min since it would have burned if I kept it at 350. Came out great and only lasted a few days!

Update: 6/6/17
Made it again, except this time in a cast iron skillet. Baked for 35 min and I thought it was finished. When it cooled it was super gooey so next time I will do what I did last time and turn the temp down to 300 and bake for another 15 min. in either the glass baking dish or the skillet.

MAKE IT, BUT DON'T MAKE THIS WHEN YOU'RE DISTRACTED OR HAVEN'T READ THE INSTRUCTIONS THOROUGHLY!!!!

Making this for a "naughty"  breakfast for myself and 6 kids, so I wanted to make something simple and quick from scratch.   This looked good and the ingredients were all things that I had on hand.

OH MY GOSH I have never experienced such kitchen TREACHERY!!  This was a pain in my butt and I kept having to backpedal to keep up. I wound up melting the butter and the brown sugar together on the stove instead of sprinkling the brown sugar over the pineapple and melted butter in the pan. I also doubled the recipe because I have 2 teens here, and want to send some home their parents too. It took SO long to prep the eggs, I was afraid the sugar mixture would crystallize, or separate, or something.

Oh, I used rum extract and fresh nutmeg instead of vanilla, because *yum.*

It's in the oven now and hasn't spilt over the side, so that's good! I'm very experienced in the kitchen - rarely have a fail- but this one has me worried. I'm sure it'll be fantastic, but not good to make on a crazy morning.

Right now it smells like an eggy souffle. *sigh*. I'll update my review & stars when it's all said and done, if AR will let me.

It had better staying power than I thought it might without going stale, so not a crumb was wasted, but my husband didn't rave over it though he did thank me for remembering it was a favorite of his.  He said mine didn't have as much caramelized sugar goo as his grandmothers.  I think I probably cut back on the sugar some.  Hey -- he's diabetic.  It was not the simplest recipe to do, so I'm not sure I would do it again.

Cake is a tiny bit dry but really great flavor. I love how the whipped egg folds and how light and airy it is. I think that the next time I make this one I'll use a bit less brown sugar in the butter mixture (I prefer a little less sweet) and possibly add a little liquid to the cake batter

I made this cake and it was really good. I was scared it was going to be dry because of all the reviews, but I made it without altering it so that I could see for myself and how I felt it should be altered. The only difference is, I used 12×12in ceramic baking dish to cook the cake in, instead of using the skillet. 
My oven is old, and small. I tested my skillet to see if it would fit, and the oven door wouldn't close all the way if I made it that way. I also cooked it for 45 minutes instead of 30-35. But like I said, my oven is old and that's probably the reason I had to cook it longer. 
This cake wasn't dry at all for me, and is actually quite moist. I would think that the difference in elevation for some people may or could be the reason why there's some inconsistencies in the way this turned out for people

It was pretty good. We didn't have a skillet and so baked it in a standard 8x8 pan. It required a lot longer to bake than suggested (added 20 minutes of time). I added rum extract instead of almond.

I've been looking for a pineapple upside-down cake recipe like this for years. So tired of "boxed cake mix" short cuts. I wanted something I could be proud of and I did this in my cast iron skillet. Excellent!!! and so good with butter-pecan ice cream!

I made this exactly as directed.  It did take an extra five minutes to cook, but it turned out perfectly.  You have to beat the egg whites enough, and once you have, you have to be very gentle with the egg whites when you are folding the other ingredients into them.  This will insure a delicious, moist cake.

I have a Pineapple Upside Down Cake "go-to" recipe that my family has always loved but now it's on the chopping block as a result of this one!  Got a wild moment and decided to try this one for a change and I"m so glad I did! It's wonderful! I did take the advice from some of the other reviewers and added 1/4 cup of the pineapple juice AND 3 Tbsp. of  sour cream! It's not only moist and delicious but a beautiful cake as well! Thank you for sharing it!

I've made this recipe three times and one word describes it: "amazing".  The only change i made was based on personal preference. Instead of cherries, I used whole pecans. This cake, served slightly warm with vanilla ice cream is to die for. The flavor and crisp edges are way too good to try any other recipe. Well worth the effort.

I reduced the brown sugar to 2/3 cup. I also reduced the granulated sugar to half cup. .
When done after 35 minutes I was shocked to see the cake floating on so much excess oil from the butter.  Two of us thought that it tasted quite good except it  was too sweet.
My daughter couldn't eat it because there was too much butter.

I love this recipe! The texture resembles angel food cake, which made for a very light cake. I used AP flour , omitted the last TB of butter, instead I added a TB of the pineapple juice I had reserved and left out the salt. (My hubby has to eat low-sodium, so I knew leaving it out would save mgs and still turn out right.) Additionally, I subbed reduced sodium baking powder. I will be making this one over and over again!

I've eaten upside down pineapple cake before, but none were as good as this one. The caramelized sugar on top was delicious. The cake wasn't too thick or heavy. All the flavors together were just terrific! 
I'm going to add this recipe to my personal collection and make it for years to come.

I had some difficulty getting medium peaks (I am really bad with that) so my cake was a bit short. Fortunately it did not affect the flavor and moisture. Although a bit too sweet for my tastes, this is EXACTLY what I think a pineapple upside down cake should be like. The pineapple caramelized and although I will reduce the brown sugar to 3/4 next time, its definitely worth trying as written. Many people mention adding lots of stuff but try it first. I did subtract a star because mine took about 55 mins to bake and for having too much brown sugar for my tastes. I am definitely making this again!

This was very easy and the egg whites resulted in a nice crust on the bottom.  Baking it in the cast iron pan gave it a good outer crust as well.   It's nice and light.  I made it with pineapple chunks and without maraschino cherries.

as a rule I don't keep white flour in my house, so I substituted 1 and 3/4 cup of whole wheat all purpose flour to 1 /4 cup corn starch( this works for all purpose white flour as well) shifted it a few times and it was just perfect. I added pecans to bottom as well as pineapple slices for something a little extra.

I've made this sevearal times and every time it is the most moist, fluffiest and delicious cake. This last time, I made it was dark brown sugar and fresh pineapple. I will never make it with canned pineapple again--fresh made all the difference!

I have made this recipe "as is" once.  The other two times I had over-ripe bananas to use up, so instead of pineapples and cherries, I sliced the bananas to the thickness of a sliced pineapple instead.  This came out great.  Tasted a bit like bananas foster.

The batter is delicious, but the cooking time is all wrong.  I left it in the oven for 40 minutes (my oven temperature is correct) and the cake came out totally raw in the middle.  Really unfortunate because the outer part of the cake was cooked crisp and fluffy.  If the time or temperature is corrected, I'd be very interested in attempting this recipe again.  As for now, I'm not wasting time.

Too sweet for my taste buds.   If you are wanting to make this in a 9 X 13 (the regular size for a cake), make sure to double the dry ingredients.  This is for a 9 X 9 only!

Best pineapple upside-down cake ever. I have made this a dozen times and it is the most requested cake I make by far. It is delicious. Just take the time to make it the way it is written and don't try to skip steps or take short cuts. 
The ONLY change I made was to use the "skinny" pineapple chunks. I arrange them into little petals and put the cherries in the center.

I made a cake and cupcakes out of this recipe. Turned out AWESOME! Total Hit!! When mixing the cake batter, I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, 2 tablespoons of applesauce and a bit of the left over pineapple juice from the pineapples. It made the cake moist and added some flavor compared to the traditional cake batter.

This cake is super fussy with all the separating of the eggs and whipping to peaks etc. but there's a method to the madness. This cake is really tasty. I followed the recipe but also added 1/2 c of the leftover pineapple juice, mainly because I didnt want the juice to go to waste. Everything turned out great, and there's no doubt in my mind that the cake would have been equally good  w/o the pineapple juice addition.

Came out perfect! It looked fantastic and tasted wonderful! It took about 15 minutes more to cook but I assume that it because I used a different pan than suggested. Would make again, absolutely!

I had to make changes to the recipe.  The batter was so dry that it was impossible to use.  Had to add 1/2 can pineapple juice and a whole can of evaporated milk.  it was still very bland and over flowery.  I will never make this again.

I can't figure out how this comes out dry for anyone. Are people over baking it? I used fresh pineapple. I melted the butter in the bottom of a 9x13 casserole dish and sprinkled the brown sugar on top of the melted butter then arranged the fresh pineapple slices on top instead of using a cast iron pan. It worked great. I also used vanilla extract to make it nut-free for my friends with nut allergies. I also increased the salt to almost a teaspoon. It was amazing. Perfectly moist and delicious.

This IS moist and super fluffy when your follow the directions exactly!  At least mine is.  Mine did take longer to cook, but I figured it was because I used a thick glass baking dish.  Unfortunately for me, it was way too sweet for my taste and I didn't even add a whole cup of brown sugar to the butter/pineapple "topping"!  :(  maybe cuz I need had pineapple upside-down cake before... Anyway, texture, moisture, everything great... But I don't have a sweet tooth...

I agree this batter is more of an angel food cake. It barely got eaten. Stick to a yellow cake batter for a true pineapple upside down cake. It did get a sugary crust. I would actually give this 2 1/2 stars.

It turned out better than expected! I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars! I followed a review's advice and added 1/4 cup of the reserved pineapple juice to the batter for the added pineapple flavor. My cake wasnt dry at all! I can't understand how anyone would get a dry cake. Perhaps they over cooked it? The cake had a very nice fluffy texture. If you want to make an old school pineapple upside-down cake, this it the recipe to follow. SO MUCH better than a boxed cake!

This cake was really tasty.  I tried making it in a skillet and that didn't work well.  I made it in a glass dish and that worked much better but had to leave it in 15 minutes longer than the time stated.  Watch your cake and test it with a skewer to make sure it's cooked through.    I made it for my father at his birthday request.  I read reviews and added 2 Tbsp sour cream.  I used bing and maraschino cherries. I will make it again.  No more box cake here.  Thank you!

It does taste good but did anyone find it just a little too eggy? 4 eggs for 1 cup of cake flour was a bit much for my taste. Other than that it was pretty good...oh I used vanilla not almond extract.

I personally like a more cake style recipe but this was an extremely moist cake and fun to make! 

It was a bit buttery so next time I might reduce by a 1/4 cp but it was gone before I knew it so that should say something!!!!

Its very delicious and great for any dessert addition.. I snap chatted the meringue making!!! Yummy!!!

4 stars as is. 5 with the following changes. My husband and I have just tried with the changes and we both said " this is going to be a problem" lol 
Used crushed pineapple, drained
Halved the almond extract & added 1 tsp vanilla
Beat egg yolks w sugar
Added 1/4 c sour cream
Folded in egg whites last 

Next time I'll soak the pineapple overnight in coconut rum

This recipe wasn't bad. I added the pineapple juice and sour cream but I don't know that it needed it because the goo from the top of the cake saturates down when you flip it. I made it in a 9 x 13 and it took 45 minutes to cook. If you use a bigger pan, double the recipe! My cake was only 1" thick.

The cake was okay, but I think it came out too sweet for me.  Next time I will cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup and maybe the granulated sugar to 3/4 cups.  I used whole wheat flour, which made a wheat colored cake :)  The cake was perfect except for sweetness.  I like sweets, but it doesn't take much to be too sweet for me.  I will also bake at a higher temperature, maybe 335-340 instead of 325.  I baked it for 40 minutes. The cake is very moist, but I think I will try what one person says her mother or mother-in-law did and pours some of the pineapple juice over the cake after it's done baking, for moisture and flavor!

This recipe was okay.  Easy to prepare.  I used fresh pineapple instead of canned and substituted vanilla extract instead of almond extract.  I don't like almond. Everything else was exactly as written(I don't normally substitute)
The flavour was good but I found that the butter/sugar mixture made the cake too soggy.  I will either reduce the amount and/or use a smaller pan next time so that it is a thicker cake.
My husband did love this cake as it was.

I think I might try either using half the recommended amount of almond extract or just substituting vanilla extract instead and using half. The almond taste is way too strong for me. It is super sweet. Needs tweeking

Brilliant and simple cake, and if you serve it to those not familiar with baking they will be fascinated about the whole upside down idea. So it is a simple delicious cake that looks good so great if you are expecting guests on a short notice :)

This recipe is THE VERY BEST version I've made! Baking in the iron skillet takes the cake (no pun intended)! The cake batter is beyond wonderful. I might add that as you fold in the cake flour alternating with the egg yolk, it's important that the mixture is smooth before pouring into the skillet. I can see where dry cake flour could hide in the batter otherwise. Perhaps that's the "dry" comments from reviews? Tasty and a keeper!

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautiful and moist.  It was more of an angel food type cake and not the traditional cake consistency my boyfriend likes.  He gobbled it up anyway but would prefer I try a different recipe with a real cake consistency.

My family loved it but I found it a bit dry. I think the next time I will add all of the pineapple juice. After reading all the reviews I did add part of the pineapple juice. I did dry the pineapples before I put them in the brown sugar butter mixture. I also moved it to a 9 x 13 pan instead of a 10' skillet, just what I have. Now I have to go hide it so there is some left for my parents tomorrow

This came out more like a quiche or an egg custard consistency .  I't not your mothers "pineapple upside down cake".  Should have known with 4 eggs to 1 cup of cake flour.

Why can't there be 6 stars??  This recipe was insane!!  Super-delicious and delectable--the entire cake disappeared in one day!  I cooked mine in an oval glass casserole, which worked splendidly, as I didn't have a nice cast-iron skillet.  Highly recommend this recipe for a dessert that's a lot of fun and also different from the usual dessert array.  Thanks so much!! (Also, I substituted vanilla extract for the almond extract and it was still very tasty).

Like many before me, I added 1/2 cup of the reserved pineapple juice to the mixture. I had no sour cream, so I simply went with juice. I added the juice to the already beaten egg yolks and folded it into the egg whites, alternating between the egg yolk mixture and the flour mixture. The added liquid required more cooking time. Next time I make this, I'm extending the bake time to 45 minutes before opening the oven door to check for doneness.

great cake. used a 9x13 baking dish instead of a cast iron skillet. don't think it would have fit in the skillet. used regular flour instead of cake flour, and vanilla instead of almond extract. Also, added 1/2 cup of the pineapple juice from the can and left out the little bit of melted butter completely. it was really yummy.

Great base recipe! I added shaved coconut to the pineapple topping. To the batter, I added 2 tablespoons pineapple juice and increased bake time to 45 minutes, (watching very closely). Cake was very fluffy and light. Absolutely perfect!

Yesterday was my first time to make this cake and it did not disappoint.
I read the recipe over 2 times to be sure there was no liquid that I had missed.  If I were not a diabetic, I could have eaten the cake in one day. I will use less butter and brown sugar in the future.  Do think I might add a bit of the pineapple juice next time.
Loved the texture of the cake.  I will make it again soon.

Looked for a recipe for many years ,Aunt made them when I was a kid.  This recipe truly reminded me of the old cooks of the old south.  If you add to this recipe you miss the point, well maybe  cause I use dark brown sugar for a more sticky caramel tase. Enjoy

5 stars.....This is exactly what I was looking for. When I was growing up, my sister and I did lots of cooking and baking by scratch thanks to our mother's guidance and this was our favorite pineapple upside down cake. I am now going to make it for my mother in law!!!! In my opinion, there is no better!!
5 stars

This is a delicious cake! It was super moist and tasty. I will definitely make again. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I had the problem that after I baked it (longer than the time indicated--closer to 45 min.) and turned it over onto a cake plate, I had a bowl of melted sugar/butter sitting in the middle of the cake. I tried to spread it over the sides but there was way too much of the butter/sugar mixture. I will probably cut that in half next time. Did anyone else have this problem? Otherwise it was very delicious. I did add 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple mixed with about tablespoon of vanilla yogurt, the 1 tbsp. butter, and 1 tsp. almond extract together then I turned it into the batter. I thought it added more pineapple taste.

This is a delicious cake when you make sure to add more pineapple juice to the batter! I also added a bit more almond extract since I LOVE the taste. I have found that if you're going to double this recipe, make sure to make 2 cakes. I made the mistake of pouring the doubled batter into 1 large (tall) cake pan, and although the top was super yummy, the bottom didn't have that buttery/sugary glaze seeping into it to make it super moist. It was still delicious, but I'm sure it would have been better if I had made 2 separate cakes. I am looking forward to making this again and again! We love it!

When I first took a bite, I thought it had too much almond extract.  But as I ate more of it, the pineapple with the almond extract was wonderful!  I had a couple of pineapple slices that didn't want to come out of the pan, but I just used a fork to reposition them on the cake.

This takes a little work and a lot of bowls but is worth it! I used crushed pineapple (drained). Since some reviewers had dryness concerns, I reserved 1/3 cup of juice and added an additional tbls melted butter.

I followed other reviews and poured some of the pineapple juice into the batter.  The end result turned out just right but the cake just wasn't what I like in a Pineapple Upside Down Cake.  It was dense and I prefer a light fluffy cake.

I have made this twice now and it is by far the best pineapple cake EVER!!!  The second time I made the cake and baked it in muffin tins and spooned whipped cream and strawberries over it like mini mock strawberry shortcakes.  They were fab!  I am definately making the pineapple cake again and again!  The cake is so moist and spongey....I love the texture!  The whole family raved!

Made it exactly like the recipe called for and it was divine!  It required baking for an extra 15 mins but turned out perfectly.  It was slightly crisp on the outside with lots of air pockets throughout.  A keeper for sure!

The Cake recipe alone is a pretty good one. I followed instructions exactly but baked it it a 9" pan. I used vanilla instead of almond extract and I had no cherries. I did add cinnamon. It came out great. Thanks Cathy!

It was very delicious with a good texture. I followed recommendations and added 2 spoons of sour cream a splash of pineapple juice. I used a 9 by 13 pan- meaning 6 pineapple rings. I found that I needed to bake it for 45 minutes though... but overall very good, and there was none left.

Not sure what happened to my cake. I followed the recipe step by step - I even baked it 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for as it did not look done at the 35 minute point, however when I inverted the cake to put on my serving plate, it was a soupy mess! Not sure what happened, perhaps it was from not getting the egg whites to the correct firmness, but I ended up not having a cake for my husbands birthday. I will find another recipe and try again.

I followed this recipe completely but It came out very dry. I haven't had pineapple upside down cake in years so I wasn't really sure what to expect. I made it for my boyfriend for his birthday. He said it was "pretty good."

Made this for friends and family and I should have made two...  Took note of other reviews and added a extra pineapple juice.  I left out the cream, it just didn't sound very appealing to me.    Oh, I forgot to mention... I didn't get any :(  It was all gone before I could even get to it..

AWESOME!  After taking some advice from other posts and included some changes on my end, this was wonderful.  Here are my changes:  +1/3 cup plain yogurt, +1/4 cup pineapple juice, and for the final touches and because I live in NM and it is Hatch Chili season, I added 1 cup hot green chili (finely diced).  The chili was the last thing in the skillet before the batter.  Don't freek out, the hot and sweet go great together.  Once the neighbors found out I was making this, they lined up at my door.  It is a big hit around here.  Next up for me, green chili ice scream.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This turned out great. My boyfriend was shocked that it tasted so good ( he has no faith) Very easy to make and tastes great. I used fresh pineapple and that works as well. Thanx!

Made this for Easter family gathering and with the addition of Fat Free Cool Whip it was the belle of the ball, so to speak. This is one holiday desert that will become a tradition.

This cake is really good!  I took other reviewers' advice and added some (6 Tbsp) of pineapple juice and 2 big Tbsp of sour cream to the batter.  I also used about 1/3 cup more flour because the batter looked too thin.  It turned out great.  And I halved the sugar and used grapeseed oild instead of butter, so it's not so unhealthy either.  Highly recommended!

It turned out well, and looked beautiful, but I think the cake part didn't taste how I expected pineapple upside-down cake to taste.. it didn't seem to absorb much syrup, and simply wasn't what I expected. This is only a matter of biased opinion though--- my aunt always made pineapple upside-down cake, and I'm looking for that taste.

Very good, as noted by others.  I even substituted Splenda and Splenda Brown Sugar for the sugars used.  Also added 1/4 cup light sour cream and 1/4 c pineapple juice (pineapple packed in its own juice).  IMPORTANT: When you use Splenda, the cake apparently doesn't "lift" as much.  And since I baked this in a 9X13, my cake was barely higher than the pineapple rings  : ( - you might want to double or triple the cake recipe if using a 9X13.  Still really delicious, though.

Delicious tasting cake however I probably could have used twice as much batter to achieve right proportion of cake to pineapple, and my cake never rose. Will give it another try using 2x the batter and cast iron skillet as suggested.

My cake came out flat, nothing like the  picture. Next time I would add half of  the light brown sugar and half the butter I also used imitation rum which gave the cake a great smell & taste.

I made this for my dad's birthday. Pineapple upside-down cake is his favorite of all time. Followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderfully! Between me, my wife and my parents, it didn't last two days!

I made it as directed and found it very dry and the texture was lacking. I believe that adding some pineapple juice would have helped it.
