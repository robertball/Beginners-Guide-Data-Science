Hi, this is my recipe, and I just wanted to make these notes that Allrecipe changed:

- use 1 whole star anise. Remove the star anise before using the filling.

- start with 1/8 cup soy sauce as some brands can be too salty. I use Kikkoman. Taste the filling before using it and adjust salt level to your taste.

Step 1 – Heat 1 cup cold milk for 1 minute. The cold eggs, oil and water will bring the liquid temperature down to lukewarm when they’re all mixed together.

Step 6 - Preheat oven to 100F - this is purely for the last rise. 200F will kill your dough. If you don’t have parchment paper, you can grease the baking sheet with vegetable oil.

Step 8 – Turn off the oven once it reaches 100F. The oven should feel like a warm summer day.

Step 10 – I use my oven’s convection setting for more even browning.
