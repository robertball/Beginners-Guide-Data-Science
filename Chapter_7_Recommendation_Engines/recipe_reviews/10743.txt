I have been making these cookies for several years now.  They become a favorite for everyone who tries them and the last cookies on the tray are always argued over!  I used Andes Candies in this recipe.  They're really exceptional.  
One note - please store these cookies seperately from others you have prepared until they are ready to be served.  Other cookies can pick up a slightly minty flavor from being close to them for too long.
I know there aren't many reviews for this recipe, but please take a chance on them - you won't be sorry!
(Oh - and I've never come out with anywhere near 100 cookies from this recipe - probably closer to 3-4 dozen depending on size.)

this is one of my favorite all time recipes. u will notice that i left out the nuts as my these were made especially for my youngest daughter and she is not that fond of nuts. so to give these a nicer presentation i opted to bake them in a cup in a mini muffin pan and push the mints, broken in half down in the center of the cookies while still very warm! everyone who got them went nuts for them!! this recipe is also a hit in my book for several additional reasons- it is a great recipe for making ahead (weeks at least that i know of) and baking later, for baking, storing (again at least 3 weeks) and making trays later, this one recipe with just a 1/2 c cocoa powder added and peanut butter cups in place of the mints is another of my regulars for holiday trays,and the cookies are great for packing and shipping!! i'll be passing this down to my children with 5 stars!!! 12/13 also u can also in a blender of food proccesor put 3/4 cup chips any flavor (chocolate is my fav) and process into fine bits, mix in, chill for 2 hr, shape dough into 1" balls roll in flaked coconut and bake at 375 for 8-10 min till set and edges begin to brown for chocolate cocnut chews and last but not least, chill dough make 1" balls and roll half in colored sugar then bake and they are festive crackle cookies!! love this recipe!!!!!!!

These were a big hit at our Christmas gathering. The Andes mints were perfect for the middle. I would definitly make them again for a party.

This cookie recipe was a winner in the first Pillsbury Cook-Off in 1949. My mother adopted the recipe for the Christmas Party's since that year. Starlight mints were used and walnut halves where placed on top of the cookie before baking. I have also used colored sugar for holidays.  My sons and grandchildren all this cookie today and when brother and sons were in the service this cookie traveled good over sea. This cookie is a keeper.

We have had these cookies for Christmas as long as I can remember.  They stopped making the original mint wafers but have found the chocolate mint UFO's at Trader Joe's to be almost exactly like the originals. Family fave. If you like mint these are perfect for you!  Question - why is dough so sticky even after refrigerating for several hours?

I LOVE READING THE REVIEWS ON SOMETHING THAT I HAVE NEVER TRIED SO THIS WAS ADDED TO RECIPE BOX WITHOUT GIVING IT A SECOND THOUGHT ABOUT KEEPING BECAUSE OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS RE TASTE AND MEMORIES.  HOWEVER... :) IS IT LIGHT OR DARK BROWN SUGAR????  SO MANY RECIPES DO NOT SPECIFY. I AM GIVING THIS 5 STARS JUST BECAUSE WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID AND IN MY ANTICIPATION OF BAKING THESE COOKIES; I WOULD NOT WANT TO RUIN THE 5 STAR RATING.

yummy cookies. Always a staple at our house during the Holidays. I make this recipe extra special by melting extra Andes mints and drizzle on the cooled cookies.

My grandmother and mother both made these, years and years ago.  I just found her recipe in the old recipe box and cannot wait to make these for a cookie exchange next week.  The recipes are exactly alike.  Another memory to cherish.

Just a couple of tips If you make this cookie recipe ~ use parchment paper cause it's a job and a half to get the baked on mint off the cookie pan! I learned that the first time I made them. (I use bags of Thin Mints) Also, once you have the mint covered by the cookie dough, roll it in your hand like you would if you were making a meatball to get all the creases out of the dough. Then carefully flatten it a bit making sure that you can't see even a hint of the brown of the chocolate.

If you aren't careful of these things, you will have leaks and the cookies won't come out very good. Note: You can put quite a few of these cookies onto the same cookie pan because they don't spread out like a chocolate chip cookie does.

While two pans of cookies are baking, I put the bowl with the dough in the frig because it gets sticky if it's warm. As you bake each cookie pan full, and you sample one when done, you will learn if you're putting too much dough into each cookie! :~)  If you roll the cookie with the mint in it as I suggest above you can see that the mint is well covered and you really do only need just a bit of dough as the instructions say. Otherwise, using too much dough, the taste of the mint and chocolate are less noticeable. (My version of this recipe doesn't use the sugar)

These cookies are a bit labor intensive to make sure you have no leaks and because I leave the dough in the frig while each batch is baking.

It's my experience that guys really LOVE these cookies! ;~D

These cookies are delicious.  Tried them for this St. Pat's day.                                                      they did spread quite a bit, even though I rolled the cookie in balls.  Next time I will put them in muffin cups as pictured.

Have made these for many years.  Wilton's chocolate melts (mint flavor) work just as well as the original discontinued kind.  Andes are too messy. I top with a pecan half.  This is originally a Pillsbury cookie recipe. No extra tsp. of dough on top...just flatten a tsp. of dough in the palm of your hand, add the mint and bring sides up & over to cover.

These are family favorites that we've been enjoying since the early 1960s. The solid chocolate mint discs/wafers have been hard to find over the years. Now the most-recommended substitute is the small Andes mint. Rather than placing the dough on the cookie sheet and pressing the mint into it, I enclose the mint in the dough with my hands.

First I break each Andes mint into two pieces. It's a lot easier to enclose the two stacked on top of each other, than trying to get the dough to cover one long rectangular piece. Then I take a healthy tablespoonful of chilled dough (should be chilled at least 2 hours after first) and roll it into a ball in the palm of my hand. Then I flatten it slightly, gently press in two mint pieces, and then use the heel of my other hand to bring up the edges of the dough over to cover the mint. The side facing upward becomes the bottom of the cookie. You should end up with a slightly rounded ball of dough with the mint hidden inside. After they're all placed on the cookie sheet, put a half walnut on each.

9-12 minutes is the best timing for mine. I buy two packages of Andes mints, 28 pieces each. No way have I ever made 100 with this recipe - maybe 55-60 is more like it.

Mom used to make these and I also lost the recipe. So good to find it! Some family members don't like mint so she made a batch for them with Hershey Kisses--Just as good...
