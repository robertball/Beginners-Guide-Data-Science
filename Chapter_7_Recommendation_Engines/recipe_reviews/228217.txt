This made one fabulous salad. I lucked out and got a honeydew that was perfectly ripe without being too soft,  Did make 2 changes, though: Added 1 Tbsp. honey to the dressing and reduced the olive oil to 1/4 cup.  Would definitely make this again,

My honeydew melon was very ripe and sweet, so I did add more lemon juice to balance out that sweetness.  I used less oil and since I had an English cucumber, I didn't peel or seed it.   All of the ingredients are harmonious and refreshing, it has a "clean" taste, if that makes any sense to you, and we enjoyed this salad.

I made it exactly as stated & everyone asked for the recipe. The key is a very sweet, perfectly ripe, honeydew.

This is terrific!  I reduced the oil and used a lemon olive oil.  The first time I made it I didn't have fresh mint and it was very good.  The next time I used fresh mint and WOW!  After dinner my company went into the kitchen and ate the leftovers!!

This is a very tasty salad, even for those that don't care for honeydew. Everything does balance out well. I did just use a drizzle of oil to save calories and because I don't like oily dressings.  My son who doesn't care for honeydew liked it. The second time I found myself out of mint when making it, so I just left it out. Still tasted good. I think it might be good with other herbs, too. I will have to experiment.

A fantastic summer salad!  The first time I made this, I lucked into a lemondrop melon (short season; hard to find in my area) that worked like a dream. I also made this with a Galia melon, also delightful. I used 2-3 tsp minced spearmint from my garden which was enough. I also used a little less oil and lemon for a very lightly dressed salad.  This salad benefits from a brief rest in the fridge before dressing. Huge hit at a recent dinner party.

Great summer salad! Not too sweet and the mint and onion give it great flavors. With a super sweet melon, there is no need to add sugar ot honey. Also  I just used a small drizzle of olive oil. Everyone loved it and went back for seconds!

Everyone enjoyed this as a Summer change of pace.  
 I did add some honey to it.
 Used sea salt (Morton fine) and freshly ground pepper.
I am not sure that this really requires the olive oil but I did use it.
 It kept nicely enough for about 24 hours , no more really, so might want to do just half a recipe if you are not serving many people.

Great option for serving melon.  Omitted to olive oil to cut down on calories and it tastes great.  Note that the pic shows prettier sliced onions and recipe calls for minced.  Next time I'll slice mine.  Orange would work great too!

Made this twice now, both for us and a potluck. It kept in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Refreshing and light, it's a really nice summer salad. The kids even liked it. I paired it with a cold, savory soup.

This was so light and fresh tasting!  Perfect for summer!  I did make a few adjustments based on what I had available though.  Instead of honeydew I used a lemon drop melon which has a similar taste but a bit more citrus flavor.  Also, I had to subsitute a lime instead of a lemon (husband grabbed wrong one) but I do say it still turned out wonderfully.
