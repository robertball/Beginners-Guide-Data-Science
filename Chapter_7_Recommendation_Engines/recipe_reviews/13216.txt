GREAT BASE RECIPE!  I read all the other reviews and made the following changes, suggested by others:  1. Used V8 instead of tomato juice  2. No oil   3. Added garlic into the the soup  4. Did not puree the vegetables, but finely minced them instead (for a chunkier soup).   My own addition was to add CILANTRO (about a 1/2 cup).  I think I might have also upped the hot sauce a smidge.

This gazpacho calls for far, far too much oil. I am not a lowfat diehard, but after eating this I am convinced that the called-for amount has got to be a typo. As written, the soup is very greasy, which is a bad texture in cold soup. I suggest cutting the oil to a few tablespoons. Start with two: you can always add more if you wish. I do think this recipe has potential, and will try it again with some tweaks.

I first got tried gazpacho in Mallorca and just loved it.  This is the closest recipe I have found to it.  

The first time I made this recipe I followed it to a T but found it tasted to much like canned tomatoes.  I now substitute about 8 roma tomatoes instead of the 2 cans of tomato juice and find it tastes much better and fresher.

Important fact to remember about this classic soup;-the best gazpacho is always made with the freshest ingredients... Having said that, this would have to rank as the best soup in the world. Yes, you can use V8 in a pinch, (I have),  but there's nothing like juicy Roma tomatoes as the base. An extra touch for presentation: add 1 ice cube to soup bowl just before serving. !Viva Gazpacho!

Fantastic soup! I would recommend substituting more fresh tomatoes for the tomato juice. Add more veggies and try to not puree too much if you enjoy a "chunkier" soup. Also, flavored store bought croutons work fine - I added the garlic directly to the soup instead and that was delicious.

with a little nudgin' in ANY direction, this becomes YOUR favorite cold soup!
Just as some read music, YOU read this recipe, get set for deluge of requests
from friends you've made the mistake of givin' some to!
You can add, substract, double, eliminate, prod, poke, stir and sample, and NO
matter what you do, it's better than you THOUGHT!
I moosh up bell pepper, GREEN onions, RED onion slices, cucumber in blender with 
vegetable juic (don't gotta be V-8, but if yer rich, go for it) and fresh-squoze lime
juice, then add to stuff I've already done, then add HALF a beer to it and
YUMM, eye-opener  to make ANY cloudy day fill with sunshine, roadrunner  "meep-meeps"

Great recipe.  I used a red bell pepper,added cilantro and a diced jalapeno.  I used no oil, it doesn't need it.  I used V8 regular and V8 spicy.  Will make again for sure.  Served it with toasted slices of ciabatta bread.

I have made this several times for parties and even the sceptic of cold soup could not get enough of the gazpacho II.  A huge hit every time!  One thing I did do different was use V8 juice instead of the tomato juice just to give it a bit more zip!

Maybe I did something wrong but this soup was awful, I couldn't finish my bowl and we threw away the leftovers.  It tasted like tomato and cucumber juice. Ick.

Was searching for something to match that a my favorite restaurant and this did it!  Thank you this great and easy recipe.  We made 2 minor changes.  The store had no chives, so we just skipped them.  We used V-8 instead of regular tomato juice.

I skipped the olive oil and I'm glad I did. I food processed the onion, cucumber and cilantro (added the cilantro) instead of blending. I think it ends up being a little chunkier that way. I also switched out the onion for a combination of shallots and green onions. Finally, I probably used 25% less tomato juice and just added until I got the consistency I wanted.

Tweaked it just a bit.  Used V8 as others suggested  - garlic direct to soup (as others suggested).  Rather than pimentos, I used diced green chili's.   Very, very good and will make it again.   Thanks......... Oldfart

Very refreshing, although thick. Substitued the pimentos for jalapenos as we have an allergy in the family, and it turned out great. So easy since you don't need to cook anything but the croutons, and it makes enough to be frozen easily. I found this to be even more delicious the next day

This was a great, fresh, light dinner with MINOR adjustments. I reduced the olive oil to 2 tbsp & the tomato juice to 16oz, skipped the pimentos. I also just chopped everything up and put it in the blender with gentle pulses until it was blended & almost pureed. That made it a lot easier and it tastes great.

This was a very good Gazpacho recipe, although I still made some changes to suit my personal tastes.
Instead of plum tomatoes, I used two fairly large heirloom tomatoes that I picked at a farm the day before (I like more tomatoes in my gazpacho).  Instead of canned tomato juice, I used juice that I had strained from seeds of tomatoes I'd used for sauce the previous day (much brighter, fresher taste) - I only used about 10 ounces of juice.  I omitted the olive oil and hot sauce, as well as the garnishes (I even left the garlic out).  I added an entire bunch of cilantro, because I simply love that flavor with tomatoes.  
I will definitely be making this again (but with all my above-mentioned changes)!

This is so healthy as so delicious!  It really wasn't hard to make either.  YUM! A few tweaks after taste testing and reading other reviews:  Spicy V8 instead of tomato juice, less salt, a lot less olive oil, a few cloves of garlic into the blender & include almonds in the toppings.

I followed this to the letter and the recipe is easy and very tasty.  I like the idea of adding cilantro (another reviewer)- I love cilantro, but I know that not everyone does.  Not that it needs cilantro, but it would give additional dimension.  The one negative thing about this recipe is the use of a blender.  My blender is the standard 40 oz Hamilton Beach and it was not up to the task of pureeing the vegetables (smelled the motor burning!) - I transferred everything to the food processor which worked great for this task and in an instant.

Want it real simple? I buy a 6-pack of V-8, and use 2 cans for the recipe. Sometimes I use canned diced Tomatoes with the  garlic and onion in it, and spoon 1/4 can into the food processor with bell pepper and English cucumber in step 1. (6I hate raw onion so I add no more.) I skip the pimentos, and add the other ingredients (using another 1/4 can of tomatoes) into the food processor and pulse until veggie bits are the right size. I use cilantro in a squeeze tube from the produce aisle, which has oil, and as per other reviewers, add no oil. I skip the chives and the croutons. It's so yummy and healthful, with just enough kick. And no chopping!

Awesome~ The flavors mixed together nicely after sitting for several hours before serving.  I added a littl more hot sauce for our preference!

Very good recipe.  I prefer to blend all the ingredients and for some crunch, I cut up some granny smith apples and put them on top.  It adds a sweet twist.  Also, I reduced the amount of oil.

I've had gazpacho a few times and some recipes I LOVE (the blended ones) and some I don't care for (when everything is just chopped). This is a perfect combination - I food-processed the base and then added some chopped veggies at the end for crunch and texture. This is exactly what I was looking for - the vinegar gives it that perfect taste. I skipped the croutons and just served it with rustic bread, and I added one clove of raw garlic into the pureed veggies, and this is a new favorite or mine. I will definitely make this again. And again and again! A crowd pleaser and a great way to use up tomatoes from the garden. I halved cherrie tomatoes and threw those in at the end along with the other chopped veggies. YUM.

Awesome! I forgot to add the garlic croutons (added plain ones) , chives, and nixed adding the extra veggies in the end. (I was in a rush and just gave it a whirl with company that was hungry) It was still simply amazing!

This recipe is fantastic!  I made it last summer while I was pregnant (and had so many things I could NOT eat!) and I just dug out the recipe to make it again this year!  Its easy, healthy, and really tasty.

This recipe was so much fun to make! As a newly married couple, my husband and I like to try new recipes together. The only changes I'd make is to adjust the red wine vinegar. The amount listed is a bit too salty. I tried white wine vinegar instead and no pimentos.

Love this soup.  I have mad it multiple times and have gotten creative and no longer measure the ingredients.  I use V8 instead of tomato juice and sometimes use red onion instead of white. It even tastes great using roasted red peppers instead of pimento.

I used this recipe as a guide along with another gazpacho recipe I found.  I didn't bother with adding pimentos or chives because I had neither, but I did add freshly minced parsley.  Although it was easy to make and very flavourful, I thought it seemed to be lacking something.  It needed an extra kick.  As well, the olive oil only coagulated when refrigerated for a length of time and made the soup a tad too greasey.  I would either omit that next time or add substantially less.

I'm rating this as a salsa and not a cold soup.  Let's start with this.  We LOVE every ingredient in this soup and thought that my husband and i would enjoy it as a soup, but we didn't.  However, it makes a great salsa!  We had this for a couple of meals on taco's and with chips.  I may end up trying another Gazpacho, but I may end up with similar results.

Great recipe!   Dropped the olive oil, used more tomatoes, a little less cucumber.  Try half a long red chili pepper chop blended into the mix for a little more zip than provided by the hot pepper sauce. A little parsley and basil is fun, also.

This is an excellent summer soup. I used low sodium V8 juice instead of plain tomato juice and added diced cucumber to garnish.

For a little extra "oomph" - substitute Bloody Mary mix for the tomato juice.

I don't use tomato juice because I don't like it, so I just put two tomatoes in the food processor with the other ingredients as noted, then chopped the other two. I enjoyed this dish a great deal and will take the left-overs for lunch tomorrow! I served it with some corn on the cob.

This tasted good but next time I will barely blend because I like it chunkier.  Big croutons worked well and I also eliminated the oil.

This recipe is great! I will definitely be using this again. Instead of frying croutons in olive oil, I simply topped the bowl off with some fresh crusty bread. This was so delicious!

I have to admit i didn't follow the recipe very strictly, i just added my own amounts of the ingredients sometimes, but it was a delicious meal! I just came back from a vacation in Spain and this is very close to the real thing!

I usually do not like tomato soups, but I saw this on my favorite Sci-Fi comedy, and wanted to try it.  This looked like the best recipe, so I tried it, and WOW!  This is one of the top soups that I have ever tasted.  It goes very well with french bread. I highly recomend this soup.

This was very good!  Directions are a bit confusing and we ended up putting all the diced veggies in the soup by accident.  But it was fantastic!  Had some croutons with it!  Yum!

I thought this was delicious!  I did follow some of the changes others made - 2tbsp of oil, no onions.  I did add celery and more hot sauce because we like spicy.

Made this for lunch today and it was delicious! I will be making this all summer :-). I took the advice of other reviewers and made some minor changes - omitted the oil completely, added 1 more tomato, a red pepper, and a jalapeño pepper.  My husband, who has always been hesitant to try gazpacho at restaurants, tried it and loved it.  We topped it off with some sour cream.  Delicious!

Love this Recipe!!!  The only change I made is to add salsa as I did not have pimentos and put in extra of my smoked chipoltle hot pepper sauce.  Some like it HOT. Me included!!

I made this for a family get together, and I must say that I was fairly disappointed with the recipe.  The soup itself seemed too thin to accomodate the chunks of vegetables in it.

I made this soup for a bbq today, and everyone really liked it.  I made one mistake: I added the ice cube in each person's bowl too early, and by the time everyone sat down, it melted and there was a puddle of water in the center of the bowl.  Otherwise, the flavor was excellent.  One question:  Why wasn't the color a brighter red.  It was dark redish brown.  Anyone know how I can get it a nice bright red???  Thanks.

Both my husband and I LOVED this recipe.  I prepared it without the oil, and with about 1/2 cup cilantro (as others did).  Instead of using hot sauce, I just used the Hot and Spicy variety of V-8 juice.  Worked great!

Delicious, blending some of the veggies gives the soup base a nice texture. To add a little zip, add jalepeno to the blended part of the soup.

Very refreshing soup.  Using fresh vegetables  and the spicy V8 gives it that pop of flavor that makes it good. I also upped the hot sauce (we like spicy in our house) lessened the oil (2 T max) and also added diced radishes for garnish for a crunchy texture. Very yummy soup and very good for your waistline also!
