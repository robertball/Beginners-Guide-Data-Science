This was VERY easy and very much enjoyed by my all my dinner guests, including my vegetarian friend for whom it was chosen.  I did add dried oregano and basil as I used all my fresh basil making pesto, and also added salt and pepper and about 3 pressed garlic cloves.  Will definitely make again.

GREAT- BUT WITH MODIFICATIONS.
-Since you have to cut the skin off of the brie, use about 2x as much as is called for.  Also, melt it in the microwave first to avoid curdling.
-Use about half as much pasta as is called for, or however much you desire- but the recommended amount is waaaaay too much.
-Season the canned tomatos to taste, or even add your own garden-fresh ones.  Better produce makes better food.

Other than that, it's a great idea and works out well.  The brie loses its sometime too strong flavor while maintaining its signature sweetness.  Well done! =D

This was a quick and easy dish to make, and it was much more flavorful than I expected it to be - I love brie cheese so now I have a great excuse to work it into dinner!

Good, quick dish! I did agree with previous reviewers that it was a bit sweet by itself. However, paring it with a spinach salad and a glass of shiraz made it quite balanced overall. I disagree with other reviewers who say to increase the Brie or decrease the pasta. There is a distinct taste of Brie in the dish and I believe more would be too much. The amount of pasta is also just right. Cutting the pasta in half as one reviewer recommended would result in pasta floating in a sauce. 

I made this dish in February. However, I think it would be best as a light dish during a cool summer evening. (A good option for those going for Meatless Mondays too.)

Cheers!

Ick. This was too sweet and the flavors just didn't work well together. The brie took forever to melt too. Even after simmering the tomatoes and brie for 45 minutes, it still wasn't all melted!

This was excellent especially for how easy it was.  It tasted gourmet with out all the work.    As for those that thought it was bland,  add more basil, salt, pepper and italian seasoning to taste as stewed italian tomatoes vary.  My daughters, 2 and 4, loved it.

This was good.  I was surprised my family liked it.   I didn't put as much Brie in the sauce.  Just incase the taste was too strong for my family.  I served the sauce on the bow tie pasta and sprinkled parm. cheese on top of that.

I found this to be rather blah.  It's great in theory, but just blah in taste.  I do like the idea of adding the Brie to my regular tomato sauce for a different flavor.  Next time I will melt the brie in the microwave before adding to the sauce... the heat was too high and it curdled.

Tasted nice.  I don't understand why canned tomatoes (perhaps for emergency or winter camping?) so I used fresh tomatoes instead.

We loved this, however I made the following modifications just because I had the items on hand and wanted to use them.  Turned out great and will go into our rotation. Changes: Combined brie, some pesto, fresh basil, cherry tomatoes (cut in half) and freshly grated parmesan - let sit on counter for 3-4 hours.  Add to freshly cooked bowtie pasta. serve immediately with fresh parm.

It didn't have much taste and it was too liquid even after I added other cheese and a lot of spices.

This recipe is MUCH better if you sub in a pint of fresh cherry tomatoes (or grape tomatoes) cut in half, and add chopped red onion and a few cloves of garlic.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! Its a fast pleaser. My mom hates brie but eats this pasta without a complaint. I have to sub goat brie for the real thing but its still just as great and no one knows if I don't say anything. And I have to add a meat, normally chicken breasts, cause if I don't dad has a cow. Thanks Tamera

my husband and I really enjoyed this dish. after reading the comments about others having trouble with the cheese melted, I used the Alouette product of softened brie.  I did heat 3 packages, until melted and then added the cooked bow tie pasta. I mis-read the recipe and used tomato sauce by Classico. Ladeled that on to the plate, tore fresh basil over it and then added the brie pasta with (my own addition of sauted shrimp) over the top
it was delicious. a bit rich.

This recipe was a bit bland (even using fresh instead of canned tomatoes.)  The brie clotted and the final product did not look particularly appetizing.  My husband liked it, but our 2 dinner guests hardly touched theirs.  It's a good weeknight recipe but I wouldn't recommend for a special occasion.

Hmmm...this one did not work at all for me, which is odd. I've cooked with Brie before, and I've never had it congeal into one big lump after melting until now.
