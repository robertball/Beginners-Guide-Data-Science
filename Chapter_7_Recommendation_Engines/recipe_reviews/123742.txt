This recipe was really good! My friends and family all liked it. When I made the frosting the first time, though, it was really drippy, even after I left it in the fridge for a few hours. So the next time I made the frosting, I omitted the lemon peel and added the lemon juice a little at a time until the frosting reached my preferred consistency.

I am giving this 5 stars, but I didn't use the lemon zest or the frosting (I used the Luscious Buttercream recipe from this site).  The cupcakes are so moist and rich, and I will not use another recipe!  I didn't have as much sour cream as I thought, so I used some vanilla yogurt as a substitute.  Delicious - thanks!

I really loved the flavor (the touch of lemon zest was not overpowering)and the texture of these cupcakes. I halved the recipe, but I kept the icing ingredients the same. I was still only able to frost 13 cupcakes, so next time I will really double up on the icing, which was melt-in-your-mouth good!

It looks like I'm one of the rare few who didn't think these were "all that."  I think my main disappointment with these is that they just weren't sweet enough, even with the frosting, which definitely carried the cake.  Could have used more flavoring, either lemon or vanilla, take your pick, and more sugar.  As for the frosting, I didn't care for the proportions of ingredients so I made my own lemon buttercream using "Quick and Almost Professional Buttercream Icing," also from this site.  These were ok, but not good enough to reach for another.  This recipe will not be a keeper for me.

I wanted to make Cranberry Lemon cupcakes for my friend's birthday so I read recipe after recipe trying to find a good one. To my surprise it was so hard to find a good recipe so I decided to make Lemon cupcakes instead. I came across this one and improvised a bit and to my surprise it turned out beautifully! Before I made these I read reviews and noticed that majority of people experienced very dense and dry cupcakes. I followed the guidelines carefully but adjusted a few and it came out incredibly moist and lemony as others said it lacked the lemon flavor. Here is the trick: I used 1 tsp of baking powder to prevent dense cupcakes, 2 cups of vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream, 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and TWO WHOLE lemons. I grated 1 and a half lemon all of which goes in the batter and about 1/3 cup lemon juice from in the batter. This made the cupcakes incredibly moist and gave it the perfect flavor of lemons. Also i added Craisins (optional) and it sweetened up the cupcakes wonderfully. With the left over lemon juice I set aside in a small bowl with a spoon. After scooping the batter in the cupcake pans i used the spoon to flatten the surface since the mixture is very thick. It didn't stick onto the spoon which made the process easier and the juice on the spoon was left on top of the cupcakes that gave a slight coating before going into the oven. As a result, incredibly moist, light and extremely flavorful Lemon Cranberry cupcakes! Needless to say these cupcakes were a hit!

Very good cupcakes.  I used only 1 1/2 cups sugar since I don't like a very sweet cake, and addes 1/2 teasp. of lemon extract to the batter too.  This gave it a nice little zip.  Will make again, they also freeze well, frost after you defrost them.

I made these last night as an early valentines treat. They are fantastic! Moist and cakey. I give them 10 stars out of 5! My bf ate 5 for dessert! I did add more lemon zest and about 2 drops of yellow food dye to brighten the colour a bit. I also made my own icing (1 pkg cream cheese, 3tbsp softened butter, 2-3 tbsp sour cream and about a pkg of icing sugar or enough to make it stiff) and I decorated the tops with white and yellow candy hearts. Definataly try these!

Very delicious! I added a couple drops of organic lemon essential oil for even more lemon flavour. I used 3 teaspoons baking powder instead of one and they turned out great.  1 teaspoon for that large a recipe with 3 1/2 cups flour sounded like too little.  They turned out light and fluffy and wonderfully lemony.  My family loved them!  I iced them with a cream cheese frosting with 2 more drops of the lemon essential oil.  I have added this recipe to my collection.  Wonderful!

Excellent recipe! Cupcakes turned out very fluffy and tasty. I did make 2.5 of frosting, as it didnâ€™t seem like there would be enough it to cover the cupcakes with a thick layer. I also used 5 cups of sugar for a stick of butter (2.5x). Frosting still turned out very sweet and zesty. Will definitely make it again!

I really liked these. I've eaten 3 and had to stop myself for going back for more. I used plain yogurt instead of the sour cream. The reason they don't get 5 stars is because I did have to add more powdered sugar to the frosting. If I hadn't it would have been too runny. I will be making these again without a doubt. Many Thanks.

I hesitated to make this just because of all the mixed reviews. But these were really the best cupcakes I have ever made. They were incredibly moist and I really do not understand all the reviewers who say they got a bread-like consistency because mine were so soft and moist. I lowered the flour to 3 cups, and baked for 17 mins. I started checking at the 15min mark. So those with hard cupcakes probably overbaked theirs or overmixed their batter because this is such a stellar recipe. (basically don't blame the recipe, blame the cook!)

Don't let my rating fool you, these are good... they're just not what you might think. They truly are more dense like a biscuit rather than spongy and airy like a cupcake should be. The lemon flavor is mild at best and they are not VERY sweet. Before I even made the recipe I had gone through the reviews and knew I would want more lemon flavor so I made Lemon Curd ahead of time. I piped the curd into the cupcakes and frosted with my own cream cheese frosting. With my changes they blew me away, but by themselves they are definitely lacking. I hate to say it because I trust all of the 'tasteofhome' recipes but you're better off buying a cake mix than using this recipe!! They were not dry either by the way just very very biscuit like and kind of harder on the outside (I did not overcook-- again texture similar to biscuit) Thanks for reading and good luck!

The cake is divine.  I added to the frosting because I wanted it to look like it was a Snow Cone by adding Lemon Sanding Sugar to the top.  They are mini cakes using new baking cups and they came out perfectly!

These cupcakes with a Raspberry Buttercream won me first prize at the Company Picnic Dessert contest. Then had people fighting over the last ones!  I did increase the baking powder so they were lighter.  I used the juice of 2 lemons and the zest and finished them by flattening the top with a spoon dipped in Lemon juice.  I used lemon yogurt and added 1/4 c sourcream to get the total 2cups.  I thought I would need a double batch but ended up with 130 mini-cupcakes and 3 dozen full size.  Hope they froze well bc I have more waiting to be eaten in the freezer. I think i will make a cream cheese frosting for those.  I researched other buttercreams, I didn't use the recipe here.

These cupcakes were spectacular! They were the perfect texture, and they flavor was amazing, not overpowering at all! The icing was the best part. It was sweet and zippy. If you're looking or a lemon cupcake this is it! Next time I make them I might add a touch of lemon juice to the batter. Other than that I woudln't change a thing!!!!

Excellent crumb to these light, tender cupcakes. The frosting is nice and lemony. I got 30 cupcakes in my paperlined tins, and doubled the frosting recipe. Ratios were just right. If you like a very lemony cake, increase your zest and add lemon extract. The lemon flavor of the cake itself is quite delicate, appropriately enhanced by the more assertive frosting. Eager to try this as a cake next time, and will fill with a lemon filling. Will post soon.

I bake frequently and do not feel the poor outcome of this recipe was due to my abilities as a baker. I don't understand how these can be classified as a cupcake. I followed the recipe to a "T" and was disappointed with the barely lemon flavored muffins I ended up with. The only lemon in this recipe is 2 tsps of grated lemon peel, which is not nearly enough. As a muffin, these were fairly nice. I only scooped half of the batter the first time around because I was very skeptical of the thick consistency and figured some doctoring would be necessary. Even after adding some much needed fresh lemon juice, and several other ingredients, I could not make this work as a cupcake. I ended up thinning out the lemon buttercream I had made, added some blueberries, and they made a nice breakfast the next morning.  I will not be making this again and will not recommend this to anyone (unless they want a muffin recipe!).

These were incredible! I added lemon extract instead of vanilla to give it even more lemon flavor. I also made my own cream cheese frosting instead of the butter frosting included with the recipe. To decorate, I piped the icing on with a star tip to make it look like flower petals. Then I added yellow sprinkles in the middle to make it look like the center of a flower. Great treat to celebrate spring!

These cupcakes were very soft and fluffy the day they were made. But the next day they were a little dense. And the frosting too much lemon and waaay to sweet. Next time I won't use as much sugar and I'll just add lemon until enough flavor. Other than that they were very good.

These are amazing - didn't use this frosting recipe because I have another favorite - the lemon taste is subtle, and the consistency is so wonderful! A perfect, light cupcake...but not too light, like the ones that fall apart before you can even take a bite - this recipe is a keeper!

I thought these were wonderful, I loved how thick the batter was, they were so moist with rich lemony zest. I would add a homemade strawberry or raspberry sauce on top of the glaze to make the lemon really pop. I will be making these again!

I have to agree with previous reviews that said this was more like a bread or muffin. Definitely not the fluffy moist cake I was looking for. And the flavor left much to be desired. After drizzling with margarita and icing with a lime buttercream, these were edible, but I won't be making it again.

I used lemon extract and glad I did because the lemon flavoring was so mild, perhaps this is because I forgot to buy the lemon at the grocery store,Nonetheless, this muffin was denser than I expected for a cupcake. I am just rating the cupcake, since I used my own delicious cream cheese icing with lemon. I would prefer Duncan Hines lemon cake mix add 1/2 cup sour cream to the batter and 1 tsp. lemon extract and save yourself a lot of time and have better tasting cupcakes. Been baking many years. Kind of disappointed in this recipe, because the majority of All Recipes are awesome.

These were fantastic.  I used vanilla fat free yogurt instead of sour cream and they were amazing.

Filled with lemon curd and put blueberries or strawberries on top of each (made for 4th of July). Definitely recommend letting them sit overnight as others have suggest.

Perfect cupcakes!  Made 48 for a birthday party. Made half with full fat sour cream.  The other half with non-fat yogurt.  Both were awesome! Couldn't tell the difference so I definitely recommend going the yogurt route.

Disclaimer - I made a possibly significant modification. I didn't have any sour cream, so I substituted buttermilk. The batter was the perfect consistency, so I'm thinking it must be quite thick with sour cream. Also, I used the zest of two lemons. I like my cakes extremely lemony, and I knew two teaspoons would not be enough. That being said, the cupcakes were perfect! They were not at all like muffins or pound cake. They were light and moist, but not fragile. Perfect. I used a 1/4 cup measuring spoon to ladle batter into the pans, and I had exactly the number of cupcakes specified. EDIT For those of you who only have two pans of each cupcake size, this recipe will make 24 regular sized cupcakes and 24 mini cupcakes.

Everyone loved these. Great lemon flavor. I put a lemon drop candy on top. So pretty! I would suggest doubling the frosting.

Very yummy. I have a lemon lover in the house and these were perfect. I halved the recipe and still had too many cupcakes. I also added double the lemon zest to the cupcakes and the frosting along with yellow food coloring.

i'm not sure what happened, but these turned out more like muffins than cupcakes.  i knew something was up as i poured the batter into the pans...it was more like cookie dough that cupcake batter.  sure enough they are dense like a muffin.  not sure where things went wrong.  i will say however that even with the funky texture, they do have a very nice flavor.  might try these again ...

I followed the recipe exactly and the cupcakes turned out moist and delicious. My only complaint is that the cupcake did not really have a lemon taste at all. I opted out the icing as previous reviews suggested, and the cupcake by itself was yummy. I will definitely make this again and top it off with different icings.

They are truly delicious!  I make 24 cupcakes, not 30 as mentioned in the recipe.  Lots of compliments!

Yeah... definitely not the best. First off there is barely any lemon flavor in cup cake. I even added a teaspoon of lemon extract and STILL not enough. Next time I will try it with 2 teaspoons of lemon extract and a few tablespoons of lemon juice. DO NOT EVEN TRY MAKING THIS FROSTING. The measurements are SUPER OFF. Not only does it make into a horrible consistency... there isn't NEAR ENOUGH. I suggest using a cream cheese icing and adding a little lemon juice and zest to make it more "lemony". At last but not least... these cupcakes are not near as moist as I thought they were going to be. Don't over cook! It took closer to 20 minutes for them to be done in my oven.

I did not try the frosting based on other comments, made a lemon cream cheese frosting instead, but basically followed the cupcake recipe, used 1.5 tsp baking powder and lemon yogurt rather than sour cream, also added lemon juice from the lemon I grated.  Love the consistency of this cupcake, but feel that had I not added the lemon yogurt and lemon juice that they would have not had enough lemon flavor.

I would call these "lemon cream muffins." The cake was moist and dense, but not very sweet (good, though). The frosting was honestly quite drippy - more like a glaze, honestly, because that's pretty much how it looks. This was good, overall, but I was expecting a stronger lemon flavor to the actual cake (I even added more lemon juice to no avail) and the frosting to have a frosting consistency.

One word...delightful! The lemon flavor is very light. It does not overpower. And the texture was perfect and incredibly fluffy! I paired this with a cream cheese frosting for a cookout. They certainly were a hit!

These were just OK.  I could've used more lemon flavor.  I found the cupcakes a little dense - the cake batter is basically a pound cake recipe.  The frosting was too sweet compared to the mild flavor of the cake.  Also, my frosting turned out to be a goopy mess so I had to serve my cupcakes with a fork and with the frosting drizzled over them.

These are delicious and very moist. I only put one cup of sugar and they were plenty sweet for our taste.  I would suggest buying two lemons for the zest because one is not enough.

I used a different frosting, because I love cream cheese in frosting and also wanted to read lots of reviews and be sure that the frosting I chose would pipe well. The cake part of this recipe though, was absolutely delicious. A delicate delicious lemony flavor. I subbed in yogurt for half of the sour cream just to be a little healthier and because I had it in the fridge. I'm sure it's great using these 2 in any proportions. Oh! I also added just a pinch for baking powder as someone had noted and the cake was very nice and fluffy.

These were incredible!  Chocolate is usually my favorite type of cake or icing, but this was just as good!  I didn't have sour cream so I substituted plain yogurt, and they turned out great!  Only other thing I did was double the icing.  Very easy and incredibly delicious!

I would add more lemon zest to this recipe, for sure.  I also, agree with another reveiwer it needs more baking powder so it isn't too dense.  Overall, an average cupcake recipe.

I did not use the frosting from this recipe but the cupcakes were very good. A little dense, like a light pound cake almost. That could have been from overmixing though I don't really think I did.  But paired with a lemon buttercream frosting I made: 1/2 cup of shortening and butter, 2 Tbs. lemon juice, 4 cups sifted confec. sugar and 2 Tbs of milk at the end, they were super good. A very grown up cupcake, as my mom put it.

These came out great.  Very moist and had a nice flavour.  I did make some changes though, which may help those who thought these cupcakes were too dense.  I used cake flour instead of all purpose (I always do for cupcakes & cakes) and I sifted it before I measured it (you'll use less flour this way).

I made a test batch of these cupcakes (10 servings) today. They are flavorful and moist, but still a bit crunchy on the top, which I love. Be warned, the batter is THICK. You'll probably want to use an ice cream scoop to get uniform cupcakes. Mine looked a bit haphazard.

Didn't try to frosting - these are plenty good on their own, but perhaps not a great choice for children.

This was not best tasting cake.  Little to no flavor, I would have liked this to have a more lemon flavor than what it had.   As for the frosting, again lack of flavor, needed more lemon to have that tart punch when you first bite into the cake.  Not  a keeper for me.

These we tasty but almost biscuit like texture.  Definitely not a decadent feel, much more rustic.  I drizzled a confectioners sugar lemony icing for more appeal.

Came out glorious even with me messing them up.  I didn't have enough sour cream so I used mostly plain yogurt-nonfat yogurt-so I thought they would be chalky or rubbery but they were actually really good.  Plus I put too much baking soda/powder in (messed up 1/2 tsp with 1/4 tsp).  Delicious!

One of the best cupcake recipes I have seen on this site.   Cut back on sugar by 1/4 cup (and maybe even more) with no problem and also added more lemon zest.     Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed the recipe fairly closely, but based on reviews, I did add some lemon extract and also some agave nectar (because i like cupcakes sweeeeeeet!) Very good flavor but the texture was crumbly :-((((

I made these and was sadly disappointed as to how "heavy" they were.  They reminded me of a muffin in weight and texture.  The flavor was lacking also.  I did add 3 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice to the batter, but that did not seem to make much of a difference.  Also, my cupcakes cooked in 18 minutes.  So beware and watch them.  I do have an oven thermometer and my oven was right on at 350 degrees.  I will not use this recipe again.

These were very light and delicious, I prefer a more sour lemon cake, so I added the juice from the lemons I grated to the cakes and icing. I will absolutely make these again. Great for summer and spring!

I made these yesterday afternoon and they are so yummy! I used part sour cream and part french vanilla yogurt since I didn't have enough sour cream. I also didn't have a lemon so I used some lemon extract instead of zest. I substituted some whole wheat flour for part of the flour called for. They turned out light, fluffy and moist! I've never had a homemade cake or cupcake turn out this good!

These are DELICIOUS! Very light and moist! Truly the "perfect" cupcake! I added 2 tsp of lemon juice to the batter and left out the lemon zest as I didn't have any. I also added 3 tsp of baking powder (instead of 1/2 tsp as the recipe calls for. I don't think they would have puffed up enough if I hadn't added the extra) as well as 1 tsp of almond extract. I also only added 1 and 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2 cups. They came out nice and sweet still! :) For the frosting, I followed the recipe given here except for the following changes: I added only 2 cups of powdered sugar instead of 2 and 1/4 cups as the recipe says. The consistency came out perfectly for me. Not runny in the least! These are outrageously good! I will be making these again! Thank you for sharing!

I made these for my friends baby shower because lemon cupcakes were her only request. they came out great- but I made a mistake. I made the first batch of frosting without the vanilla.  I had already decorated the cupcakes before I went back to make the second batch and then realized my omission.  I tried the first batch and liked it better, so I brought both to the party. Turns out everyone like the 1st batch better. It makes the lemon flavor much stronger.

This is a fantastic recipe for lemon cupcakes.  I halved this recipe and made miniature cupcakes for a brunch and decorated with candied lemon rind and others with a raspberry.  If you make miniature cupcakes bake only 10 minutes.  Do not allow to brown. I made my own frosting, but it was similar: 1/2 stick butter, 4 oz. cream cheese, 1 box of confectioners' sugar, 1 teaspoon lemon extract, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon coconut extract (for richness) and 2 tablespoons heavy cream.  Try these.  You will enjoy them!!!

The best part of this cupcake is definitely the icing.  It's VERY sweet and loaded with lemon flavor.  It's a thin icing as opposed to a frosting.  This recipe made 24 cupcakes for me.  Next time I would check them at about 22-23 minutes.  Great recipe!

This cupcake recipe is sooooo good! The cupcakes are dense and not too sweet, which is why the frosting works so well with it. The cupcakes have the perfect hint of lemon. I also used lemon extract to boost the lemon flavour a bit. Will definitely be making these again!

These were sooo good!  The cupcakes were tender and perfect and the frosting was refreshing and lemony.  I divided the cupcake recipe in half to make 15, but upped the frosting servings to 45 in order to frost all 15.  I had the perfect amount to ice all of them using my 1M Wilton Tip.  I'll definitely make these again- they may be the best cupcakes I've ever had!

Yum! I was actually in search of a recipe for vanilla cupcakes. So I just replaced the lemon with more vanilla and they turned out great. I didn't have  the problems with the frosting another reviewer talked about. Maybe the butter he/she used was too warm.  My frosting was a bit too soft at first but after I put it in the freezer for about three minutes it was just right.
Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Not so impressed.  This did turn out very heavy and not enough flavor.  I had even followed other suggestions on adding extra lemon flavor and suggestions on making it less 'heavy' but it didn't work.  I did make lemon frosting which helped out with the flavoring.

I haven't frosted these yet, but I am hoping they get better with the frosting. I double checked to make sure I followed the recipe. They came out tasting more like a shortbread. The are just okay to me, even my daughter didn't want to finish it unfrosted!

The cupcakes themselves were ok- too little lemon flavor but still tasty. The frosting however was way too much sugar and it wasn't creamy at all. I recommend using a different recipe for the frosting.

These were exceptional cupcakes,I did not change the recipe. A smidge of yellow food dye in the icing,that's it. Just absolutely delicious. A bit of work,but oh so worth it in the end. The frosting was super rich and didn't really "stay put",slightly runny,but so yum. And it looked so pretty on the cupcakes anyway!

This is not your typical cupcake recipe, and anyone thinking they are going to get a cupcake will be disappointed.  I would not make this recipe again as a cupcake.  The batter and resulting "cake" is very dense.  These are more muffin or pound cake-like in texture, tho they are flavorful.  I may make again in a bundt pan and see how it comes out.  I added quite a bit of fresh meyer lemon juice in addition to the peel, added some yellow food coloring just to give it a light color, and used another reviewer's icing recipe.  It would take quite a bit more tweaking to give it more stars.  It was not what I was looking for--which was a lite spring-type lemon flavored cupcake for a spring luncheon.  I may change my review after hearing what my guests have to say.

Fantastic cupcakes - I was very skeptical after I had the batter mixed up, as it was very thick as mentioned.  I made them as directed, adding about 1/4 tsp. of lemon extract for extra "oomph".  They baked up wondefully moist with great texture.  I filled them with a bit of lemon curd (homemade recipe) and then instead of the frosting recipe here, I used the "Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting" recipe from this site, it has a bit of cream cheese in it, and I used a bit of lemon extract and lemon zest as well.  These cupcakes were raved about at our party!  So glad I tried this recipe, thanks!

My husband doesn't really like lemon cake.  But he said this was pretty good!  I think the reason he liked it was because the cake didn't have too strong lemon flavor.

This recipe is AMAZING! The cake is so delicious! Light and fluffy! I even added more lemon zest than the recipe called for and it tasted perfect! You've definitely got to try this recipe! This one is definitely making my scrapbooking cookbook!!!

The cupcakes are divine! A lovely, light texture. I didn't try this frosting though; I used the Wilton Lemon Buttercream frosting, which has just the perfect amount of lemon. I halved the cupcake recipe, and the Wilton frosting made the perfect amount to pipe onto 15 cupcakes.

These cupcakes and frosting are absolutely delicious.  The frosting, however is a little bit runny as written.  I added about 1/2 cup more powdered sugar.  Delicious!

The cupcake itself is very good.  It has the right amount of lemon flavor and my friends really enjoyed them.  

The problem here is the frosting.  The massive amount of powdered sugar compared to everything else makes it almost inedible.  It's ridiculously sweet.  On top of that, there isn't close to enough butter to make it actual frosting.  I had to double the butter and add milk to make it resemble frosting.

I suggest either adjusting the frosting recipe to include more butter/milk and less sugar, or just go with another frosting recipe.  You could easily make a cream cheese frosting and add some lemon to it.

The muffins had a good taste, and the frosting was AMAZING.  My only complaint is that the frosting is way too thin - even after I cooled the cupcakes it literally melted all over the cupcake immediately after piping it on.  I will use a greater dry ingredient to wet ingredient ratio next time I make these.

I substituted Vanilla Yogurt for the sour cream like some other reviewers suggested.  The cupcakes were a little drier than I am used to, but after I put the icing on they were perfect.  I think the icing recipe needs to be doubled to adequately cover all the cupcakes.  Will definitely be making these again!

These are delicious!  I followed the recipe as written and it had just enough lemon flavour to make them taste fresh but not too much for people who don't like lemon.  Will be making again for sure!
I didn't use the frosting recipe here . . . just a basic buttercream so I can't comment on that.

Really yummy! They are not too sweet and have a nice subtle lemon flavor. The only thing I didn't like was the frosting because it was too sweet. I used a lemon cream cheese frosting instead of the butter one.

A really good moist cupcake, delicious taste. The lemon flavor in the cake is extremely light, I almost ended up doubling it. I also had a problem with the baking time because mind got dark at 23 minuts (it suggests at least 25). They ended up needing only 18-19 minutes. Even a little dark, they were still tasty. The frosting doesn't make enough either, and since my batter made a whopping 3 dozen, I used about 4x as much frosting. Despite the problems in the proportions, this will be a go-to recipe for me, cause its soooo good.

I love this recipe!!! I have made it several times...it is very adaptable to almost any flavor and makes a good large batch. I've taken out the lemon, added Kool-aid (strawberry with green icing tops) and substituted some honey for part of the sugar to make an adorable pull apart bee cake. Can't say enough good things!!! Thanks for sharing!

These were pretty good.  I thought the cake itself would be really moist and lemony based on the batter, but it came out a little bland and dry.  The flavor ended up being perfect though with the tart sweetness of the frosting.  Needed a LOT more frosting than it called for.  I at least doubled the batch.  Might try to substitute some oil for butter to make it more moist next time.

Cupcakes: My husband professed these "near perfect consistency."  They have a nice lemon flavor and texture to them.  I made them as is and got exactly 30 cupcakes.  They puffed up over the top of the paper cups nicely.  It was a VERY thick/dense batter.  They did not create smooth tops, but I didn't bother smoothing every cupcake out before baking.

Icing: The proportions as is does not make nearly enough for 30 cupcakes.  I piped double layers of icing.  I made FOUR times the icing the recipe calls for.  Probably double would be enough to spread a decent layer for each cupcake.  It's very sweet icing, so a little goes a long way.  

I only give this 4 stars because the icing proportions are not quite enough.  I had no problems with it being too runny.  The milk at the end is really optional.  The directions say to cream the butter and sugar.  They don't actually cream in these proportions until you add the other liquid ingredients.

Excellent flavour, wonderful texture, very moist! I did replace the frosting recipe with my own as I didn't think the recipe provided would produce enough frosting to ice all the cupcakes. A definite keeper! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I love these, I now use vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream, and replace lemon juice for the vanilla extract.  No Lemon extract in the frosting, I use lemon juice there also.  They come out so moist and full of flavor!!  not to tart and not to sweet.

I made these for Easter and was very disappointed in the actual cupcake.  I thought they were very dense and heavy - closer to a pound cake than the "delicate cupcakes" I was expecting.  I followed the recipe exactly.   I won't make these again.

These taste very good but I wanted a light and airy cupcake and this batter was very thick resulting in a dense, heavy cupcake.  Like I said the flavor was great and everyone seemed to like them, but I was disapointed--it was not what I was looking for.  Will not be making again.

Yum, yum, yum!  I made the batter to a T, however, I made a loaf cake as I didn't have confectioners sugar for proper frosting.  Instead I made a sort of glaze using the same ingredients for the frosting, minus the confectioners sugar of course.  I will do this again the next time I feel like lemon cake!

These cupcakes are simply to die for! I substitute sour cream for plain or vanilla yogurt, and I also add a little lemon juice since I thinks it adds to the flavour. My family says these are the best cupcakes they have ever tasted, and we're more chocolate-type cake lovers than lemon. Even though I make my own frosting (I find the recipe provided too thin), I still love these and they are now one of my favourites C:

This recipe is a great starting point, but I did find that it needed significant changes to get it as I wanted. The cake is very moist, but I found the frosting and lemon flavor lacking. There is no way the frosting in the picture is exactly the recipe, without at least doubling. I tweaked the recipe significantly, and am finally thrilled with the final result, which I detailed (and pictured) on my blog, Carrot Top Mom. Here is a link, if you are interested in my version http://www.carrottopmom.com/?p=764 .  Thank you for a good starting point, which I was able to alter to my own preference.

These were great!  I think next time I would up the lemon zest in the cake part; it was good, but it could use a little extra wow factor.  I played with the icing until it was a consistency I liked and garnished with candied lemon zest.  Great recipe!

Ok I don't know if it was just me but mine tasted more like a sweet biscuit than cupcake.  I couldn't even taste the lemon even after I doubled the lemon juice. I had to double the frosting and had to add 1 1/2 TBS of lemon extract to compensate the lemon flavor of the cupcakes.  I definitely wouldn't call this lemon cupcakes and won't be making these again.

These were delicious.  The cake part turned out light and fluffy, with the perfect amount of sweetness.  I ran out of sour cream, so as instructed by a previous reviewer, I substituted vanilla yogurt for the remaining half cup of sour cream.  They turned out great!

I loved this recipe and agree with most, it didn't have enough lemon favor. I used 4 tsp of lemon zest and that gave the added lemon taste I was looking for. I am not a super sweet lover so this not so sweet cupcake mixed with the icing is just right. I never use magarine when baking. I also used my own butter cream frosting recipe.

I tried this recipe despite naples' 3-star review, because it's the highest rated lemon cake in my recipe box. It isn't bad, but unless you also use lemon frosting, it isn't lemon cake. Too many eggs, not enough sugar, not enough lemon flavor -- with that said, it's not bad. I made a raspberry buttercream to top them with, which has its own tartness from the raspberries, and was overall pleased with my results, but I was looking for a tart lemon cupcake, and this isn't it. This cupcake is an excellent base for a really flavorful frosting. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Holy...wow. These are amazing cupcakes.  Not too lemony, not too sweet-just right!  The frosting is to die for.  I upped the ante by adding coconut flakes to the frosting.  Magnificent!  
I didn't have as much sour cream as the recipe yielded, so I used what I had on hand.  I would imagine that these would be even creamier and more delicious with more SC.

Always gets wonderful reviews! Very moist and the right amount of lemon flavor! Opt for the fresh lemon as oposed to bottled; you can tell the difference! Love the icing, but I'm currently in search of the perfect "fluffy" lemon topping. Definite keeper.

These cupcakes were fabulous! I just made a few changes... I added more lemon zest to bring out the zing. I also made raspberry frosting instead to give a tasty balance of tart and zest. It was the perfect combination that I was looking for.

This was delicious!  I subbed the butter with veg. oil and the sour cream with plain yogurt in order to make these cupcakes slightly less unhealthy, I also mixed about 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice into the yogurt before mixing it in with the batter as directed. I baked for only about 20-24 mins. Also, the icing is really delicious. To give it more of a tangy zip, I added more lemon juice. I topped the cupcakes with blueberries- the flavours were phenomenal together

These were a bit of a disappointment. The batter was unbelievably thick, but it baked well. The cupcake was fluffy but dense at the same time. It was lacking the lemon flavor I was hoping for. I may make them again but I would add more zest and lemon extract. I don't understand the rave reviews of the frosting. It was awful. I ended up frosting with homemade buttercream.

the cake itself was worth 5 stars, but the frosting was watery, and the lemon coagalated with the milk, therefore making it gross-looking and lumpy. and did i mention watery? we put in more butter and sugar, and made it less nastyish. so, it derserves a 4 stars. but we all loved the cake :D

This recipe cooks up beautifully each time.  I add a little more zest than called for, I use plain yogurt in place of the sour cream, and I juice the lemon and add the juice to to the yogurt prior to combining all the ingredients.   This recipe bakes up great in 8-inch round pans for cakes as well. The cupcakes (or cake, for that matter) bake up nice and light, and the batter is very fine.  A go-to recipe for my kids birthday cakes, for an alternative to the classic white/chocolate options.

LOVE LOVE LOVE these cupcakes!  I changed it just a bit.  I used 1/2 greek yogurt instead of all sour cream and with the icing, I made lemon cream cheese frosting!  TO DIE FOR!

These cupcakes are amazing, tho I didn't make the frosting yet.  I substituted some of the sugar with a box of lemon instant pudding to pump up the lemon flavor since so many people said it was so mild, as well as a few drops of lemon extract.  It was still pretty mild so I can't imagine it without those additions. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and put them in the freezer.  Will make the frosting in a few days & frost them for my sister's bridal shower this weekend.

Very good cupcake though it loses the 5th star b/c it's so faintly lemon.  I added extract to the frosting (which needs to be doubled) and they were really yummy.  Add the extract to the batter and/or frosting and it's a 5.

Not what I would necessarily call a "lemon" cupcake because there was only a very slight hint of lemon flavor however the texture and the taste were wonderful. Next time I'll try using some lemon extract because I really wanted a strong lemon flavor.

These are by far the best cupcakes I've ever had.  My husband and I finished off the last two last night and we both agreed....So YUMMY!  We had guest over and they just loved them.  I gotta also say the frosting is the best recipe...so easy but full of flavour.  I do have to say though that these sweet babies are high in calories...but oh so worth it!

I didn't find this recipe very impressive-i LoVe lemon cake and I am always for looking for the 'one' go to recipe for lemon cake-this one was missing flavor (lemon oil??) and moisture-I added sour cream but the texture just wasn't great-sorry to be a downer I wanted to like it but just couldn't :(

I had to make cupcakes for a very picky family but didn't want to go with the usual chocolate or vanilla. These cupcakes were moist and delicious, and the lemon flavor was subtle enough to keep everybody happy.

I used this recipe to make a cake. I added 2/3 of a cup of fresh lemon juice to the batter (would have added a cup if I had it, the batter is very thick and can take it), and that was my only alteration. Poured into a 9x13 and baked for 36 minutes. It came out dense, very moist, and VERY delicious. I split the cake into two layers and filled with Lemon Curd (from this site). The light taste of the cake went perfectly with the sharp tang and sweetness of the curd. I made a lemon cream cheese frosting, but I wish I would have just made a lemon glaze for the top, that's all it needed. I really enjoyed this recipe, it's a definite keeper for me.

I really liked these and was able to adapt them to my vegan diet.  I used margerine, egg replacer, and vegan sour cream (soy based).  For the frosting I omitted the milk but I bet you could use soy milk.

SO good!  my changes: no vanilla (out!), no salt (used salted butter), double lemon zest, squeezed in a lemon's worth of fresh juice, made 24 regular and 18 mini cupcakes (LOTS of batter!), doubled the frosting recipe and used heavy cream instead of milk.  i love all things lemon, but despise packaged mixes for baked goods; i've been looking for a good scratch lemon cake and frosting recipe for a long time and this is IT!  thanks so much for sharing!!

While these were good and we are enjoying them, I thought the frosting was way too sweet and I even added less sugar than called for.  I much prefer the lemon cream cheese cupcakes from A/R over these.  Still good though...Thanks Ruth.

My goodness, These were the most delicious cupcakes every! Took them to work and they were instantly gobbled up! Like other reviewers, I substituted the sour cream for vanilla yogurt, and they were fabulous! Next time, I will definitely cut the frosting recipe in half! It didn't look like much, it made 1 cup of frosting. I only used a 1/2 cup, so the rest was wasted. I also topped my cupcakes with some lemon zest for an extra lemony flavor!

These were good. Due to my experience in making lemon muffins/cupcakes, I figured that these would not be lemony enough for me - so right off the bat I added the zest of a whole lemon, and 4tbsp of lemon juice to the batter. After filling my muffin tin, I also added a drop of lemon juice to each one individually. They came out with a wonderfull lemon flavour. I did not try the frosting, but these cupcakes tasted great and had a really nice fluffy texture.

This was such a great recipe!  The light lemon flavor was very refreshing, but the texture was also buttery like a poundcake.  The icing added a perfect finish, not too sweet nor too tart.  I used some leftover batter in mini-loaf pans and shared them with friends who wanted the recipe for themselves.  So yummy!

great recipe, they were light and moist, with just a little hint of zestiness from the lemon to balance out the sweetness. I would recommend doubling the amount of frosting if you really like frosting (like me!).
I did find that 25 mins was a bit too long to cook for, 15 minutes was about right for me, but could just be my oven.

These are absolutely delicious with a lovely light and fluffy texture.  I scaled the recipe back by 1/3 and it quite easily made 12 cupcakes which is more than enough for 2 of us.  I replaced the sour cream with thick vanilla bean yogurt as it needed to be used up and instead of vanilla extract I used lemon essence.  My one quibble is that they weren't lemony enough for my liking, next time I will probably add some lemon juice to the batter.

These cupcakes are absolutely SUPERB. I highly recommend them!! They are my new standard for lemon cupcakes. My only changes: I added tons more lemon peel (I do that with all lemon recipes) and made about 150% of the frosting recipe.

These cupcakes turned out great. I took them out right at 25 minutes and they were done perfectly. I've also made these without the lemon in the batter (so just white cream cake) and substituted almond extract for lemon in the frosting - they were GREAT!

Overall, pretty good. I found the cakes to be a bit dry, but I think I might have baked them for too long. The recipe says to bake for 25-30 minutes, but even 25 minutes I think was too long. The tops were hard and crunchy. The icing was nice, I only added 2cups of icing sugar instead of 2 1/4 so it wasn't too sweet, but still had a nice lemon tangy flavor.

This recipe is unbelievable! I couldn't stop eating the cupcakes! I stuck to the recipe exactly and my frosting consistancy came out perfect. I liked the tangyness that the icing added to the cupcakes, I definitely recommend this recipe to those who like melt in your mouth cupcakes, lemon, and the fact that they aren't too sweet.

Great cupcakes! I needed to make more frosting to cover all of the cupcakes, I also added some yellow food coloring and placed lemon wedges on top of the cupcakes.

I made these for a bridal shower a few years back, and used them as the table decorations.  I overturned my crystal and set a cupcake on each base, which now was at the top.  My daughter liked the idea so much she requested I do the same thing for her bridal shower, adding "and make those delicious lemon cupcakes too!"

I loved the tartness of the frosting...although i do think I used a tad more lemon juice, and zest, than required in the recipe. I overcooked the cake just a bit...but w/ homemade cake this makes it very stiff and dry. Good flavor- i'll make it again and try not to overcook the cake.

These are wonderful!  Very moist and devine!  I didnt have sour cream so I used light vanilla yogurt and had no lemon zest or juice so i added lemon extract to the batter and icing.  I didnt follow the icing recipe exactly but used it as a reference, also added 1 drop yellow food coloring.  Sprinkled poppy seeds on top of icing.  I'm addicted to these!

This was an easy recipe to make and the cake actually turned out beautifully! The icing I wasn't a big fan off, my niece and nephew are BIG lemon cake fans - but they didn't care for this recipe at all. Overall they were OK.

This recipe is amazing and my go-to homemade cupcake recipe for sure. I sometimes make with a different icing depending on my decorating and palette desires. I almost always leave out the lemon zest in the cake itself just to save time - they're just as good without, and less work. I personally think they rival Sprinkles cupcakes. :) I have a hard time eating just one of these!

This is the best cupcake recipe ever. My friends couldn't stop eating them! I've tried many recipes before and this one is by far the best. It's got just the right consistency, lemon flavor, and the batter rises perfectly. You can easily substitute the lemon with chocolate or any other flavor for the perfect cupcakes!

I did have one small problem with these cupcakes: they burnt on the bottom, and I only baked them for 20 minutes. However, I am giving this recipe 5 stars because that's an easy problem to fix in the future, and likely the fault of my oven anyway. These cakes are light, sturdy enough to frost, have a SLIGHT eggy flavour (perhaps from using freerange eggs?), and the batter goes a long way. I substituted coconut flavour for the vanilla, and added 3/4 cup of dessicated coconut to mine, and the combination is delightful. Will be using this recipe in the future!

Really delicious.  You only need a small amount of icing so the amount the recipe makes is actually enough, even though it initially doesn't look like it!  These had a beautiful light but substantial texture and were loved by my friends for afternoon tea.  I topped mine with some slithers of lemon peel and they looked great.

Loved how fluffy they came out! I added more lemon zest and lemon juice (we love lemons here). I wasn't impressed with how runny the frosting came out but it was an easy fix. Will make these often, that's for sure!

Unfortunately, I didn't like these cupcakes. Like reviewers before have said, they were extremely dense, more like a pound cake or muffin, and actually collapsed a bit on cooling. I've never seen a cupcake do that.

They were rather bland as well, even though I did add more lemon zest and juice as other reviewers recommended. A disappointment, I'm afraid.

These turned out more like a muffin very dense and were not sweet  like cupcakes.  I substituted orange for lemon; used a bittersweet ganache and orange cream cheese frosting.

Used Crisco in place of margarine. Did not have sour cream so I substituted 1 pkg cream cheese also added lemon instant pudding mix. Seemed too thick added milk about 1/4 cup until right consistency was achieved. Absolutely decadent!

These were one of the best cupcakes I ever made, but I am giving this 4 stars as the lemon was a little less for me. The second batch I made, I used lemon peels of two whole lemons and one table spoon of lemon juice in the batter. In addition, I even added a bit more baking powder as that seemed less. But really amazing recipe, thank you!

This is a great recipe.  I love the cupcakes and the icing.  However, the icing was very thin.  Even after adding more dry ingredients, it was still ran right off of the cupcake.  I will definitely use this recipe again but will work on the icing to improve thickness not taste....it tasted great.

I followed the directions exactly. The batter was thick, however I read that thats normal. Well, they came out more of a muffin consistancy than a cupcake. Will not make again.

Very delicious cupcakes - moist but not overly so.  I added the zest of 2 lemons (app. 2 tsp.) plus a big of lemon extract for more flavor. I was out of sour cream so I used lemon yogurt instead and they turned out great.  I'll be making this again!

I halved this recipe & only made the cake part for some plain cupcakes I was making.  I squeezed some lemon juice in the batter to get more of a lemon flavor in the cupcake itself.  These taste really nice!  The only thing that wasn't so great is that the texture was dense, these were almost like muffins instead of cupcakes.  I also put a lemon syrup over the top of these to give them even more of a lemon kick, because the lemon flavor still wasn't very strong in the batter.

I did not care for these cupcakes.  They were very dense and dry.  The frosting was way too sweet, for my taste, and I even added 2 more tablespoons of butter, because I wondered how you could cream all that sugar into only 3 tablespoons. I ended up adding some cream cheese to the frosting in an effort to salvage it, and now I must say it was awesome.  I think it needed that to balance all that sugar.  I will definately make the frosting again, just on a different cupcake.

I halved this recipe, but otherwise followed the recipe as is and the cupcakes are great.  Very moist and not too sweet.  This is a great recipe if you have any extra citrus fruit you want to use.  I used lemons, but think it would be good with limes or oranges too.

Really delicious and fun to make! Mine were a touch dry, hence a 4 instead of a 5.

Excellent cake recipe! A double recipe yielded 51 standard cupcakes, with 1/3 cup batter in each cup. I added another tablespoon of zest to my second batches for added lemon flavor; they were delicious both ways. Thank you!

These are so incredibly tasty! Light, fluffy, perfect combo of sweet and tang!  I do add more lemon peel to the cupcakes and frosting, I like the tang and distinct lemon taste.  But aside from that, perfect as is! I've shared this recipe with many since the first time and everyone has thoroughly enjoyed these cupcakes!  I crave them often!

Good flavor, but very dense - more like a muffin than an cupcake.  Would have preferred something with a lighter texture.  I did not use the attached icing recipe, but tried Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting from this site -- the frosting was awesome!  Would not make the cupcakes again, however.

I actually wanted a more "Lemony" type of cupcake--even though I doubled the lemon in the batter (4 tspn) + added about 2 tblspn of fresh lemon juice-it still wasn't enough of a lemon flavor. But I actually like the frosting to be a bit more runny--when it dries it becomes a beautiful glaze; I just doubled the amount of lemon and put 1 tbspn of fresh lemon juice instead of milk. Everyone wants more of the frosting. Overall, my husband ate about 5 cupcakes and loved the light and fluffy texture! Thank you!

Yummy! Moist but not light, mine came out more like a pound cake texture, but the flavor was great. I added a tablespoon of lemon juice per others' suggestions that it wasn't lemony enough. I'm glad I did. Definitely sweet enough.

They are fluffy and moist.  I added 1 tsp lemon extract to the cake and 1/2 tsp lemon extract to the frosting.  GREAT lemon flavor...not too much or too little.

They only needed to bake for 17 minutes!  I did the first batch for 20 minutes and they were over done!

I made cupcakes for the first time and they were awesome! Everybody liked them. I didn't add Lemon Peel to it, just three teaspoons of Lemon Juice. 
I have to say, I had to make twice as much for the Frosting. The amount given in this recipe was only enough for half of the cupcakes.. maybe I used to much, but I just made nice swirls on cupcakes, which looked appropiate to me. :-)
Awesome recipe, will use this again!

These turned out beautifully - subbed in splenda for the sugar (I know, sacriledge, but a necessary evil).
Added sugar-free chocolate chips. Fantastic.

DELICIOUS!! I will emphasize, though, what other reviewers have said - the frosting recipe made enough to frost the 24 cupcakes I got out of the recipe with about a quarter inch of frosting each! The frosting was delicious, though, so I'd keep the recipe but just double or triple the frosting part.

These were okay, not sure I'll make them again. The cake was too dense for my taste. I ended up adding some lemon extract to the batter to give it a more lemony taste. I also made a lemon curd from this site and filled the cupcakes with that.

These are allright.... The gals I ride the commuter train to Chicago with every day have been BEGGING me to make cupcakes for them (I always talk up my latest culinary creations which makes them HUNGRY lol!). One of my friends LOVES anything lemon. I do too, so I decided to give these a try. As a whole, these were "OK," but I didn't enjoy the "package" (i.e. cupcake / frosting). I REALLY like the cupcake part. It's rich and moist and has the slightest hint of lemon taste to it (perfect!). The frosting, however, is too tart for my liking. The frosting and cupcake together are an odd pairing, IMHO. The cupcake is almost too delicately flavored for the strong (i.e. tart) lemony frosting. I'd like a little more subtleness. Because of this, I only frosted half of my cupcakes (I stopped at 2 dozen). One thing to note: I had to refrigerate my frosting for quite a while to acheive a spreadable consistency (I spooned all of my frosting in my Williams-Sonoma mechanical pastry bag for easy decorating). Prior to doing this, my frosting was SOOO thin it dripped right off my VERY well cooled cupcakes! All in all, these were a nice treat, but I prefer a simple vanilla frosting with a hint of lemon in it to frost with. I will definitely make the cupcakes again sans the frosting tho! Thanks for sharing, Ruth Ann. :-)

Ok this is a tough one.  The cupcake is amazing!  So tasty.  But the 'frosting' left much to be desired.  Frankly I thought it was disgusting.  I had to add waaaaaay too much powdered sugar to get it to a 'frosting' consistency which made it too sweet.  I had to scrape it off the cupcakes.  I'll be making them again but with a buttercream frosting with some lemon extract added.

So delicious! These cupcakes were very moist and tasty and had the perfect amount of lemon. I subbed applesauce for butter (1/2 volume) and cut the amount of lemon juice in the frosting in half since other reviews mentioned it was runny, and they turned out perfect. I will definitely be making these again!

Cupcakes are great!  Frosting is fantastic!  I  gave it 4 starts only b/c I used someone's suggestion to add Lemon Merangue Yogart in place of sour cream to make them more lemon-y.  Overall, this is a great recipe!  I will use the cake recipe as a base for other flavors, as well as the frosting recipe.

I didn't think these were all that great. The batter is more of a muffin batter, very thick and heavy. The flavor of the cake was very good, but the texture was not. The frosting doesn't make much, I had to double the recipe and I barely got by with that.

i guess the cupcakes were fine after i did the alterations suggested to make them more "lemony" but i had serious problems with the frosting.  it was not frosting.  it was more like a drippy, messy glaze.  i added tons of cool whip to it to thicken it which helped but next time i will look for a fun fluffy frosting and stay far away from the topping in this recipe.

I love this recipe and make it for many occasions.  Instead of using sour cream I substitute Yoplait Thick and Creamy Lemon Merangue yogurt. This cuts back on some calories and adds more lemon flavor!

These are great!! I put lime juice and zest in mine, so it taste like a key lime cupcake!  I also cheated with the frosting and used ready made, but mixed in lime juice and peel. I changed the baking time from 25 to 20 minutes, made the cakes moist but not raw. Perfect for a hot San Antonio day!!

With one exception, I followed the recipe exactly.  I did add extra lemon peel (about 4 tsp) b/c others had said these were not necessarily all that lemony.  These were okay, but I sure didn't love them.  I thought they were still not very lemony.  The texture was not light like I had expected--it was actually kind of biscuit-y.

This recipe is insanely amazing. However, I did make a few changes to make it to more of my preferences, but the base of the recipe is great. I added a little lemon extract to both the cupcake and frosting because I wanted a really strong lemon flavor. I also made the microwave lemon curd from allrecipes and pumped in a little filling to the cupcake with a cupcake decorator. The frosting is delicious, but it NEEDS to be doubled to frost just one batch. I also added less milk, and did lemon juice in replacement as well as did omitted the lemon peel, mostly because I ran out, but also because I did not want lil specks in the frosting. the frosting comes out a beautiful, clean white color and it pipes WONDERFULLY. I was really pleased with the taste and proportion of butter and sugar. However, it is definitely more store bakery sugary tasting to it. Adding the lemon extract and juice to it helps give it less of a sugary taste!

5 stars for this frosting!!!! I also left out vanilla and replaced with lemon extract, soooo good. Cake was pretty dense, hence the 1 star reduction, I prefer lighter cupcakes, but still was a hit with all.

I followed the recipe exactly, the only difference was that I used Meyer Lemons instead of regular lemons. They turned out great. A bit dense, but I don't think they suffered for it. The flavor was amazing!

I LOVE lemon baked goods so I had to try this recipe. I saw that another reviewer had used some yogurt because they were short on sour cream, and since I didn't have any sour cream I used all raspberry yogurt. The flavors work perfectly together. These cupcakes have just the right amount of lemon and are moist. I think I may have left mine in the oven a touch too long because they were slightly crispy on the outside, but I like that. The icing is simple and tasty.

These are really good. Make sure you use a large bowl as the recipe makes a lot of batter (and cupcakes). I baked it in three 8 inch round layer cake pans for about 35 minutes. This made a HUGE cake, so next time I would make 2 cake layers and some cupcakes if I were to bake it as a cake again.

These are excellent!  The texture is perfect, moist and not too heavy.  I do wish the cupcakes had more lemon flavor.  I doubled the zest and the lemon was still very light.  Next time I will add lemon extract.  The frosting is DIVINE, I made extra and instead of lemon juice, I used Limoncello.  I could have eaten the frosting on a boot it was so good!  I will definitely make these again.  They really hit the spot for my lemon craving.

These cupcakes are absolutely spectacular! I took the advice of some users and made the frosting more "lemony" by adding lemon extract and it turned out amazingly. Not too sweet with the great tang of lemon. The cupcakes themselves were delicate, moist, and delicious. I brought these little beauties to work and everyone loved them! Definitely using this recipe again and again!

These were pretty tasty.  I used the Whipped cream cheese frosting from this site.  I made for a Wedding Shower and not only did they taste good, but were pretty.  I do not know if I will make again because a boxed mix is just as good and less work.

Awesome recipe... delicious icing and not too hard to make! There sure seemed to be a lot of batter but it made exactly 24 cupcakes. I needed to double the icing to cover them all, and I put a cherry on top of each!

Very flavourful. The icing is reminiscent of a cream-cheese icing, and the cupcake itself packs a lot of lemon flavour. I got rave reviews for this recipe at a birthday supper.

These cupcakes are the best!  The icing was quite sweet.  For the second half of the cupcakes I made a lemon cream cheese icing and it was much more complementary to the cupcake.

I would give the cake itself 5 stars, but the icing was really sweet and overpowering. Even with just a little bit on it seems like too much for me. The good news is that the cupcakes are delicious even without any icing.

This recipe produces moist cupcakes with the perfect light, fluffy texture.  However I rate it 4 stars due to the fact that the lemon flavoring left me wanting.  I changed the recipe by adding 2 teaspoons each of lemon extract and orange zest, and I changed the 2 teaspoons of lemon zest to 1 tablespoon.  I also did not use the frosting recipe.  But overall, these are the best lemon cupcakes I have found so far.

Great recipe.  I also added a dollop of a cream cheese-lemon zest-lemon juice-1/4 c. sugar mixture to the middle before baking.  It's a nice creamy surprise that makes this already moist cake even more decadent.  If you like lemon, this is the right recipe!

I made this as a cake instead- there was more than enough batter to make a 10x2 cake and 6 cupcakes. I don't overfill my cake pans- hence the 6 cupcakes.  As a rule, I never make the icing have the same taste as the cake. I used a buttercream icing (5 cups conf. sugar, 3 sticks butter, 3-4 tbls water, 1 tbs meringue powder, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla) for the filling and frosting and enough leftover to decorate the cake.  The cake was moist with a light lemon flavor. Perfect!  Received rave reviews!

These were great, lovely texture and subtle flavour. Used lemon extract instead of the vanilla though.

updated - made them again, but wanted a vanilla cupcake, so omitted the lemon, added extra vanilla and used a vanilla yoghurt instead of sour cream - excellent

Okay, so I actually made this into a layer cake (2 9 inch round pans)and used the Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting recipe from this site. It turned out sooo good! If you like lemon anything, this is the recipe for you. The cake is moist and flavorful. Just make sure that you get only the true zest of the lemon, and none of the white bitter stuff underneath. I had to add twelve minutes to the bake time, but everything else remained the same. I will be making this for Easter dinner for sure!

I made these for the 3rd time this weekend for the MIL (since I've told her how yummy these were & she was in town). She LOVED them!  We like stuff lemony so I added a drop of lemon juice as well as lemon extract to the batter & I didn't bother to measure out out how much grated peel I added.  It once again, came out perfect!  The first 2 times, I had extra batter & used the rest as a cake but this time, since I only have one cupcake pan, decided to wait, & make 24 cupcakes. It was well worth it.  Thank you for such a great recipe!!  I also used the Lemon Icing recipe off this site (also added lemon extract to that-just a drop). Perfect!

These cupcakes were delicious.  We didn't have a lemon, so we used a touch of lemon juice in the batter.  We also substituted some plain yogurt for some sour cream.  Yum!!

I had really high hopes for these, but was a bit diasppointed. The icing was yummy, and you could really taste the lemon in the cakes...but when using fresh lemon, isn't that always the case? They were good, but not "the best".

I made these for a wedding shower and they were the hit of the party. I used orange zest instead of lemon and added a little orange extract. I frosted them with an orange cream cheese frosting. I had several people (including the bride to be) ask for the recipe.

Wonderful cupcakes!  I made half a batch (15 cupcakes) to share with my husband, his friends & my family members... EVERYONE loved them.  I used a different icing recipe, though ~ look up "Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting" (divine!!!).  I made the recipe as-is and it turned out excellent.  The batter is surprisingly thick, like the recipe states, and the cupcakes cook up almost like muffins with a denser middle.  No complaints, though!!

I agree that as is, this recipe is not "lemony" enough which is why i gave it only 4 stars and not 5...However...the crumb of this cupcake is wonderful, fluffy AND moist...neither crumbly nor hard.  Nothing like a pound cake which is something I keep running into with lemon cake recipes that don't use a box...I adjusted the recipe by changing the 2 teaspoons of zest to the zest of 2 lemons, I added the zest of 1/2 an orange and also added 2 teaspoons of lemon extract.  You won't taste the orange zest, but it adds a nice depth of flavor.  Didn't try the frosting because I want to frost them in a classic cream cheese frosting that I will spike with lemon. 

All in all, a definite keeper!

Unbelievably delicious- the best thing I have probably ever baked in my whole life! These are light, flavorful and taste very homemade and lemony! Thank you for submitting this little bite of heaven!

This recipe is classic. The cupcake was abit heavy thats why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I also never seem to achieve the correct serving size. followed the measurements exactly, but ended up with 72 cupcakes (which made everyone abit happier - more to eat!) 
I filled my muffin tins to 1/4 with batter, but the cakes rose only to about 3/4, so if you're planning to have them overflow over the edges then 1/2 or 2/3 is better. Otherwise the frosting can be abit tricky to slop on.

The cupcakes were moist and yummy, the frosting was just a little to lemony for my tastes. I just made a half batch of the frosting omiting the lemon zest and added it to the first batch of frosting and it was perfect. I will make again.

These were interesting, but good!  The cupcake honestly doesn't have a lot of lemon flavor, even after adding 1/2 tsp of lemon extract to it.  It's very mild.  The frosting is WAY lemony though.  I did not like the cupcake alone or the frosting alone, but I enjoyed them very much together!  They balance each other out.  And the sour cream makes the cupcakes very dense, which I enjoyed.

They were ok, nothing spectacular.  Somebody else brought a batch of cupcakes made from a box and those were actually tastier and much more popular.

This was a nice and easy lemon cupcake.  I used a basic frosting of shortening, butter, and confectioner's sugar and added lemon to it.

The cupcakes turned really moist and delicious. I'm just not sure about the icing, it was little runny even after putting it in the fridge. I'll probably use another buttercream icing recipe for this..

I've made these cupcakes at least 50 times and taken either to a party or to work and everyone has loved them!  The only problem I've had is that once out of the oven, they would shrink up.  Still, great flavor!  This time I doubled the baking powder and baking soda and they turned out perfect!  This is a keeper!

These came out really good. I even managed to increase their nutritional value just a bit by doing a few things: 1) instead of only all-purpose flour, I used a mixture of 1/3 all-purpose, 1/3 whole wheat flour, and 1/3 wheat germ; 2) I added a small amount (2 oz for 12 cupcakes) of pureed sweet potato and carrot-nobody even noticed; 3) reduced fat sour cream.  I also used a cream cheese icing instead of the one listed. Yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a little more lemon peel to both the batter and frosting. My husband and I enjoyed them, however I felt the frosting could have been thicker, they were very tasty!

These cupcakes are awesome.  The only tweakings that needs to be done to this recipe are:  1.  Bake for 18 minutes 2.  Add 3 Tbl FRESH lemon juice to the cake batter 3.  Increase the icing recipe by 2 1/2 times Yes, the cupcakes are dense but who cares?  the taste is awesome!  Who says that cupcakes have to be light and fluffy?  I will definitely make this recipe again and will experiment with using different flavors.  The cake batter recipe is a great base recipe.

These were very good. I followed the suggestion in the other reviews to add the lemon juice to the frosting a little bit at a time until it got to my desired consistency. I would make more frosting next time, as I did not have enough to frost all the cupcakes.

My family loved these cupcakes, we used the zest and juice from two whole lemons. And we made a cream cheese frosting and flavored it with fresh crushed raspberries (seeds strained). While the cupcake was very dense it has a great flavor and my kids are already asking me to make more!

Loved the frosting, didn't use lemon zest because I only had 1 lemon for the cupcakes. I would recommend baking 20-25 minutes because my cupcakes were a little dry when I baked them close to 30 minutes. Great recipe, would definitely make these again!

I made these cupcakes just as the recipe said, and I found them very dense and muffin-like.  The flavor was wonderful, as was the frosting, but the cupcake itself is probably not something I will make again.  I was very careful to cream my butter and sugar until fluffy, and did not over-beat my eggs.  Still, a dense cupcake.    Everyone that ate them thought they tasted wonderful, but many agreed that they were a bit on the muffin side.  I piped in a raspberry filling after they cooled, but they were so dense that they did not take the filling well.  I should have cut them open and filled them.  Oh well.

These are really good cupcakes...the consistency is perfect!  The reason for 4 stars is the sweetness, they are not very sweet as is or very 'lemony'...I added some fresh lemon juice and about an extra 1/2 cup of sugar.    I also messed with the icing some by adding a 1/4 block of cream cheese. Will keep this recipe!

The cupcakes were delicious! The frosting was drippy but served more as a glaze then as frosting. It double coated thickly all of the cupcakes for me. It dries on them fast so I just did a second layer. Lemon was not overpowering but very good!

This was a BIG favorite in my house! I loved this recipe it was definitely a crowd pleaser even with my particularly food snobby family. I had to use half greek yogurt instead of sourcream because i ran out, and the time is way to long here, i found 21 minutes preheated oven worked out perfectly for me. I didnt have time to make the frosting from scratch so i used store bought cream cheese icing and spruced it up a bit with 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract and lemon juice, about a half of lemon and they are DELICIOUS. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

These are sooooooo moist - just delicious.  I usually get discouraged with making cupcakes because they're dry, so I gave up years ago.  Now I must make these every weekend!  I used a little lemon extract in the batter since I didn't have lemon peel.  So, they weren't terribly lemony, but they're great as vanilla cupcakes.  I used the batter for 15 cupcakes and stuffed it into 12 so they'd be very full.  I tried these with buttercream frosting using the recipe on a confectioner's sugar box.

Love it, love it! Made this recipe on a whim, didn't have a lemon on hand for the zest, so I utilized an orange in the main recipe, but had lemon juice & extract for the frosting. I replaced the milk w/ a tablespoon of sour cream, which added an added twang to the frosting. Orange / lemon medley flavored together, excellent.  My only mistake is I cut the recipe down to 10 cupcakes, (I need to lose weight) they weren't enough,   :Q

Very good! I love lemon cupcakes, so I added a little bit of lemon extract to the cake mixture. My first batch I baked for 20 minutes, and they were a little more brown than I wanted, so the second batch only took 15 minutes. I didn't use the frosting only because I LOVE a topping that I use for a refrigerator cake recipe of mine: 1 package of dream whip, 1 package of Lemon pudding, and 1 1/2 cups of milk; mix it with a hand mixer on med-high for 3-8 minutes (until stiff). I baked these for Easter, so I added some food coloring to the frosting to make it festive! I also expected the cake to be more light than it was (more dense like a cake). It wasn't bad, but I was just expecting something a little lighter.

I chose these for one of the flavors of my wedding cupcake cake. They were delicious! The frosting is really lemony but good if you like lemon.  might try to add more lemon to the cake and less to the frosting. Really tasty! Will be making again

These were exactly what I wanted when I went looking for this recipe! The only problem I found was that I needed to add a lot more sugar to the icing mix to make it thick enough to actually ice the cupcakes, but it was well worth it. These were delicious!

Review for the cake only: This cake is great, very moist and fluffy. The batter is indeed very thick when you're done, but it bakes great. I cut the recipe in half and I also substituted vanilla for lemoncello. I actually used only one egg and 2 tsp of the liquor.  I used another frosting for this cake, a cream cheese-based frosting.

these cupcakes are SO good! instead of the given frosting recipe i use a basic cream cheese frosting and add raspberries (they have to be fresh or there's too much liquid). i put the lemon juice in with the cupcakes.

I found this recipe to be average. I didnt think the frosting was the right consistency though. I followed everything exactly the way the recipe said and it was good. Just not great. Will still continue my search...at the very least for better frosting.

These were decent cupcakes. Fresh out of the oven, they tasted very fluffy, light with a crispy top, very nice, worth 4 stars but just one day later they were quite heavy and quite chewy which is not the consistency I want for cupcakes. I didn't make the icing so this review is for the cakes only. Instead I used the buttercream icing from this site. I might make them again but they are nothing special.

I poured this into two loaf pans and cooked for about 50 minutes and this made a great cake. The frosting was a bit grainy I might need to melt the butter and them add the sugar, creaming it did not work well. Still very good though.

I really liked the density and moistness of these cupcakes. I added a few drops of lemon extract to boost the lemon flavor. I didn't use the frosting from this recipe and instead used the "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" recipe on a/r with some added lemon zest and lemon juice. They turned out great.

A big disappointment.  I wish I had made the boxed cake mix rather than waste my ingredients.  I'm surprised at the positive reviews, mine don't taste lemon-y at all, despite 2 Tbsp. of lemon zest.

Very tasty! Just made these today. Didn't have a lemon, so just used 1.5 teaspoons of lemon extract instead in place of the zest. Very yummy! The frosting however didn't exactly turn out like frosting. It became very liquidy and resembled more of an icing. It's still tastes really good though. I think zest in it would've been a bit too much lemon for my taste.

I am lactose intolerant and made these dairy free, and they turned out well. However, without the frosting they are basically vanilla cupcakes. Next time I would add zest and lemon juice in the cupcake batter, and glaze them with lemon flavored icing.

The best part about these cupcakes was the tangy frosting. Delicious! The marriage of the frosting and cupcake was a good balance. I expected the cupcake to have more of a lemony aroma which was lacking. I like to follow the original recipe first and foremost - Next time I might try adding more lemon zest to the batter.

Changing my review because these tasted a lot better the next morning.  ...Ok but definitely not spectacular. Cake doesn't have much of a lemony taste but the texture is actually pretty good. Probably perfect if you like your cake with only a light lemon flavouring.  Icing is delicious but a bit too sweet for my liking. Perfect lemon flavour but I think these would have been better if the icing was made of a icing sugar/cream or icing sugar/cream cheese mix.

Quite good, but I prefer more lemon flavor and adjusted it accordingly. First time I made it, an Argentinan lady asked for the recipe so it must be good.

These were so good!  I followed the recipe exactly, and they were fluffy, moist and delicious.  The lemon taste was not too strong--I could even have put more zest in.  I had to double the frosting.

i made this for a bridal shower, although i am typically not a lemon fan, it is what the bride requested.  i used this for a cake, substituted soy milk in the frosting, and only added lemon juice for consistency (and skipped the zest in the frosting).  this had a very light taste, and was a hit at the shower.  even i wanted a second slice.  this will definitely be my new lemon cake recipe.

Subbed lemon juice for the vanilla and used buttermilk instead of sour cream.  Made my own icing of lemon zest, juice, softened butter, and icing sugar.  These were very good, but be sure not to overfill the cupcake tins or they will sink in the center.

Absolutely delicious! The frosting is tart and sweet, perfectly matched to the light and airy lemon cake.  I added yellow food coloring to the frosting, and decorated them like plaid for a "Flannel Party."

These cupcakes are amazing! Not too sweet, and the texture is beautiful. I actually used 2 cups of plain yogurt (Trader Joe's organic, which is very thick yogurt) instead of sour cream. Even the batter is silky to the touch when putting it in the muffin tin. I only have 2 muffin tins so had to wait for one batch to finish while the rest sat -- I was nervous but they all came out perfect. I will buy more muffin tins just for this recipe!

Mmm, mmm, good!  Only real complaint was that I thought the cake part wasn't lemony enough.  Super easy and a real crowd pleaser.  I did halve the recipe and like the other reviewers have said - Not enough icing - so don't halve the icing part!  Will make again.

I made these cupcakes to cut out a section in the middle, fill with lemon curd, replace the cut portion, and then frost. So I already knew that I'd be adding a lot of gooey lemon flavor to the inside of the cupcake and didn't worry about it being more than "good enough."   In fact, the cupcake itself (pre lemon curd) was very good. It wasn't quite lemony enough for my taste, but it did have a nice light lemon flavor, a good crumb, and a nicely crispy edge. I would have preferred a little more moisture, but that was taken care of in my version by the lemon curd. In all, a very good cupcake. I would make them again, but probably not plain. They need some sort of extra lemony/gooey goodness to shine.

I love lemon and really enjoyed these cupcakes! My only complaint (and this is a very small complaint) is that I wish they had more lemon flavor.

I used orange instead of lemon zest, and agave nectar instead of sugar.  I went with a cream cheese whipped cream frosting with lemon juice and orange zest instead of the frosting in this recipe.  I served these as mini cupcakes for my daughter's first birthday party, and everyone loved them!

Pretty good... The sour cream was a bit overpowering, and the icing was a little strong. I'm thinking it might be better as a cake, with a little less flavoring and a seedless raspberry jam center. :)

I don't even like lemon cake, I just made it for my boyfriend for his birthday. But I couldn't stop eating them! And he said that they tasted "just how lemon cake should."

I did use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour, and added an extra 2 tablespoons for each cup for the conversion.

I had nothing but compliments when I made this cupcake. The frosting is fantastic just remember to soften the butter enough. I added some lemon filling I found from a cake recipe just to give it even more of a lemony kick.

These were amazing.  I made them for my daughter's 1st birthday party and everyone loved them.  The only thing I changed was instead of 2 cups of sour cream, I substituted one cup for plain yogurt, which I think gave it a nice little tang.

Lovely light little cupcakes!  To boost the lemon flavour, I rubbed the zest into the sugar before creaming the butter, and used lemon extract and juice instead of vanilla.  I also added a bit of yellow food colouring for a brighter, sunshine-y look.  The cakes turned out moist and soft with a layered lemon flavour.  Delicious!

this was so good! i found it to be time-consuming but well worth the effort. i didn't have enough frosting for all the cupcakes but it was easy to extend the icing recipe by just adding a little more butter, lemon juice, and sugar.

I thought these were okay - the texture of mine came out pretty spongy which made me feel as though I was eating sponge! I prefer a denser cake with a bit more flavour - whilst spongy I didn't feel as though there was enough lemon flavour in these, although my husband loved them.

I added some lemon extract and extract rind to the cake batter. I also used a different frosting recipe, "Lemon Icing" from the website. I thought that they turned out fantastic, I took them into work for someones birthday (enough for one each) and everyone was looking for seconds!

I just made these and they came out GREAT! My husband said they are the best cupcakes he's ever tasted. I did make a few adjustments: used 2 tsp of baking powder, 2 eggs and 1 egg white, substituted 1 1/2 cups of white flour with 1 1/2 cups of whole grain organic pastry flour and used fat-free plain yogurt instead of sour cream. To cut the calories and fat some more I also used fat-free milk. YUMMY! Thanks for the recipe!

OH yummmm... these were exceptional!  I'm a lemon-fiend so I added about 3x the lemon rind in the cupcakes, and 5x the juice in the icing.

The consistency is amazing and the end result is just heaven.  Thanks so much!

I did not care for this recipe. I dont know how any one can give this 3 or above as far as the star rating. The so called "cupcakes" tasted like sweet cornbread and the frosting was way too watery! I will never make this again.

This is a very good recipe.  I was testing it for layering purposes, needed a mild lemon cake for a friend.  It's true that there is very little lemon flavor to this cake.  I halved the recipe since it was a test.  BUT I did add significant lemon zest, lemon extract and fresh lemon juice.

This cake is also very light, not dense like so many, so it's a nice change with warmer weather coming.  Will keep these in my stash of secret weapons! Thanks for sharing.

EDITED:  My cake was light and not "heavy" at all...Was everyone else's cake/cupcake dense or light in texture?

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because I had to double the amount of frosting to get all the cupcakes frosted and 25 minutes baking time was too long.  20 was perfect but then again, everybody's ovens are different.

Well, as my grandma would say, "They ain't nothin' to brag about!"  the cupcakes tasted more boring than a plain piece of bread.  The frosting didn't improve them enough to make me ever want to make these again.

these cupcakes are absolutely amazing!!  fyi: the cupcakes themselves aren't very lemony--it's the frosting that really makes them "lemon cupcakes."  i've made the frosting berry-flavored by adding a tablespoon of raspberry jam and omitting the lemon juice/peel.  try this recipe and you won't be sorry!!!

Great flavor - nice moist, dense cupcakes. Frosting added a great finishing touch!
