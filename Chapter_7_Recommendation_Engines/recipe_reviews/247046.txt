Simple to make. My family loved it! I wasn't sure as I read the directions when to add the red pepper, so I just added it as the rice was cooking. Turned out great.

I left out the cheese and used salsa, but I liked it better without salsa. Used Knorr Taco Rice and it was really good. All 3 of us got seconds, a very rare occasion. Oh- I didn't do the double decker thing, that seemed too messy.
