My guests played with the cherries and chocolate as they happily sipped their drinks.

For extra chocolatiness I used chocolate vodka and, since this was to be a "Chocolate Martini for One," I halved the recipe. Also, since I don't like my drinks too strong in the taste of liquor, I went a little lighter on the vodka. Won't replace my favorite chocolate martini, but it was a worthy alternative.

I used Pinnacle Chocolate Whipped vodka and it made a wonderful chocolate martini.  I didnâ€™t bother with the cherries.

Loved it!  I put a little redi-whip on mine before the cherry.  Way better than hubby's dirty martini! :)
