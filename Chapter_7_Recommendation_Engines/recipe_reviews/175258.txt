I would cut at least half the oil in this recipe, turns out to be way to much and I even added an extra cucumber to the mix. I would compare this to adding an entire bottle of oily dressing to a small salad..sorry did not work for me

This was FABULOUS! I used red onion(about 1/2 of a lg onion), white wine vinegar, & grape tomatoes cut in 1/2. I can't rave enough about this! It was a HUGE hit this weekend!

I can't believe I saw this recipe.  I have a Cost Plus shaker salad dressing jar that has recipes on the side.  This was the exact recipe. except for added basil. I made it last week for the first time for a dinner party and it was a hit. Especially good served over (or mixed in) cottage cheese

WOW !!  I have been looking high and low for such a recipe since I am a huge fan of tomatoes and white or sweet onions.  I have eaten this sort of salad in restaurants but could never get the recipe.  In any case, there was never any guarantee of a restaurant's marinade so it is / was nice to make my own.  The taste, after 8 hours, covered in the fridge was superb.

At first I thought, whoa, this is way too much onion and way too much seasoned salt.  But after letting it marinate overnight, the flavors blended together nicely.  However, it makes alot more than 2 servings.

Summery, tangy and simple.  It was a nice accompaniment to our grilled steaks.

I cut the oil in this recipe in half and it was still too much.  I also used 3 tomatoes, 1/2 a sweet onion and some green onions, and red wine vinegar.  I think it's a great starting place, but next time I will use half again of the oil.

i used less sugar since im trying to cut back. this was excellent the day after but the leftovers i finely chopped and put in a ball jar and it was excellent over greens used like a salad dressing.

Simple tomato salad with a nice taste.  I used fresh from the garden cherry and grape tomatoes.  This was good and went nicely with 'Roasted Beer Butt Lime Chicken' and 'Hot Ponderosas!' both AR recipes.

I had a big, beautiful Tennessee farm market tomato I used to make roughly half this recipe.  I didnâ€™t think all the dressing was necessary so I made 1/4 of it, which was plenty.  I sliced my tomatoes and used green onions.  I try never to refrigerate tomatoes, as their flavor diminishes, so I made this early in the day and let it sit on the counter until dinner.  This was good, but nothing exceptional.   I was expecting more based on the rave reviews.

Absolutely loved this tomato salad!  What a great , simple summer side.  I used 1/4 cup oil, and did double the mustard.  This makes plenty of dressing, easily enough for six tomatoes.  I used orange, yellow, and red tomatoes, so pretty.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jay!

Wow!  This is YUMMY!  I followed the recipe as it is written and also added some feta, just because I had some to use up.  Hubby and I both loved it.

Delicious flavors. I didn't measure my tomatoes -- just grabbed a load from my garden. Seemed there was a little too much oil/liquid for my liking. I would reduce that next time. And my husband and 10 year old daughter loved it too.

I LOVE this salad! I always have a bundle of cherry tomatoes from my garden in the summer and love making this salad with them. I add cucumbers and bocconcini to it and have it for lunch!

I made this and I love it! I did adjust it a little tho. I used a 1/3 cup oil instead of 1/2. I added a little bit of basil. And I used dried minced onion instead of fresh. I also used 4 tomatoes instead of 3. It tasted fantastic!!! I will definitely make it again.

A bit strong for a salad. I'd use it more like a condiment for some grilled chicken or something, but alone as a side dish? Would you ever eat pico de gallo as a side dish?

I'd give this recipe 2 stars if I were to rate it.
however, using it as a guide
where veg oil is replaced by XXVO and reduced to 1/8,
sugar is omitted,
WWV is replaced by Bals V,
quartered capers added,
garlic added,
Then I'd give it 4 stars.
