I liked these burgers a lot, but for my boyfriend they were too spicy. Definitely not for the person who dislikes or can't tolerate the heat. Would make again, perhaps with less chipotle peppers.

My boyfriend loves hot. I do not. This was the perfect compromise. Very delicious!  I broke up my burger and put it on a salad with a balsamic, lime oil and mustard dressing. We both added pepper jack cheese.

I absolutely loved this. I wanted tacos. He wanted burgers. We got both. I topped it with cheese, guac, extra chipotle sauce, lettuce, and jalape√±os. It was heaven on a bun. Thank you for the recipe.
