Hi, I made this Pad Thai today and it was delicious. I love tamarind and this was the only recipe with tamarind in it. 
I think I'll try to make noodles a little different and pour hot water over them, since I like my noodles very soft. I made a bigger amount of food and my noodles were not exactly perfect and it took a bit longer. Overall, great recipe, thank you. I'll be making it over and over again.

I doubled the recipe because I have a large family, left out the tamarind paste and dried radish because I donâ€™t have them, and substituted fish sauce for the salt, and white vinegar for the rice vinegar because I was out. I also finished with 1/4 cup of sesame oil drizzled over the top. Delish!!!!

This pad thai recipe comes out tasting like pad thai... plus it's very simple to make. I have never had tamarind paste or grated radish to add, but I'm sure those ingredients would make it taste even better. The amount of sugar in this recipe is a little shocking, but I think they must add a ton of sugar to the pad thai you get in restaurants as well, because it ends up tasting familiar rather than grossly sweet. Thanks!

I have made this twice, and I agree, I will put hot water over the noodles, as I had to cook them longer in the sauce to soften them.  I used fresh Asian radish instead of dried, but other than that, followed the recipe and it was very good!
