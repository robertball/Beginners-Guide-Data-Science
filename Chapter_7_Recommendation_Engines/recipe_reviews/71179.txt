This is so quick and yummy and makes an excellent speedy supper.  We used Frito's corn chips and nuked individual servings in the microwave.  Don't forget the chopped red onions!  Thanks Emily.

Way too much salt with the chips and chili, but comfort food nonetheless.  I always made this in individual bowls on Halloween for the kids before trick or treating.  Heating up the chili and pouring it over crunchy chips, topped with cheese and other things.  We prefer our chips to be not so soggy when it is baked.  Watch the salt though - between the chips, chili, and cheese there's alot!

I mix in shredded skinned chicken in big chunks (cooked via Safeway or Cosco) and put a sprig of parsley on top and it is always "A hit" for a group at Potlucks.

This was gooood!  I couldnt find any vegetarian chili so I bought the store brand.  The meat was listed near the end of the ingredients.  There didnt seem to be a lot of meat present.  I used the Tostitos brand bite size tortilla chips.  The cooking softens the tortilla chips.  I put the shredded lettuce, tomatoes, salsa and sour cream on the table and let every put on what they wanted.  The sour cream made it very rich and filling.  It could be eliminated, although it was good.  Excellent and liked by all.

My mom used to make us something like this when I was growing up. She would mix a can of corn in with 2 cans of chili, but I do about a half a can of corn and serve the rest on the side. Also, she did the chips on top so that they stay crunchy. After seeing this recipe I made it with the chili on the bottom, some grated cheese on top of that, then the crushed chips and cheese on the very top and served with the taco toppings which was a nice addition that I hadn't done before. Make it how you like it and you can't go wrong!

I thought this dish was pretty good. It's definitely easy to make and great for a quick supper. I used Tostito's corn chips instead of Frito's. I thought 6 cups of chips seemed like a lot, so I used about 4 cups, crushed. I was able to find the fat-free (also low sodium/no salt added) chili in the health food aisle at my grocery store. Next time, I will also serve this dish with with black olives and guacamole. This dish is a lot like supreme nachos. It would be great for a party -- just spread your chips out on a sheet pan instead of in a 9x9 square, serve lettuce, tomato, and sour cream on the side, and call it nachos supreme! Thanks for sharing Emily!

Not really sure why this is called "taco casserole" there is nothing "taco" about it really, it is more like a frito pie. Not anything you would serve company, but nice for a fast meal on a busy week night.

Winner, winner........awesome casserole dinner! I used Doritoes taco flavored chips and Stagg Silverado chili (we wanted meat in ours). I topped it with my own homemade salsa and reduced fat sour cream. Very simple and the boys inhaled it. Quick and dirty dinner--NO LEFTOVERS.

Pretty good! I wouldn't really consider this a recipe per se (I'd compare this to a "dump a bunch of convenience items together, heat & serve dish") or agree that it has even a hint of taco taste to it, but it's good nonetheless. I rarely cook on weekdays unless I've prepared a meal beforehand or stumble upon a simple recipe such as this. I literally walked in the door, prepped everything in less than 5 minutes & ate in less than 30! Adding shredded lettuce, chopped tomato / green onion, salsa & sour cream to individual servings pleased both my hubs & myself (we don't like the same toppings). I pretty much followed your mom's directions to a T except for subbing a can of regular Hormel brand chili (i.e. w/ meat / beans) for the vegetarian variety & monterey-jack cheese for cheddar. The 1st substitution is what attracted me to this recipe to begin with - I desperately needed to clean my pantry (my lonely can of chili had been hanging around for too long lol!). All in all, this is a great dish to have on hand for busy evenings or when you just don't feel up to cooking. You can even make it from memory, it's that easy! Thanks for sharing, your mom! :-)

Great vegetarian fast food dish.  Seeing as this doesn't keep well, I made a batch for myself.  I used 1/3 of a can of veg chili and baked it over the chips for 10 minutes.  Topped it with cheese, lettuce and avocado pieces.  Super fast and very filling.  Will make again.  Next time I'll make it with my own home made chili.

This was okay.  I was looking for a quick and easy meal and this fit the bill.  However, it just seemed more like nachos than an actual taco casserole.  Next time I will just make nachos.  Thanks.

Very good and extremely easy! I added a can of corn to mine and also doubled the layers. So nachos, chili, corn then repeat ending with cheese on top. Would make a great appetizer too!

Emily's Excellent Taco Casserole Haiku: "A little perplexed. Nothing 'taco' about it. But it still was good." I had a small tupper of leftover taco meat, so I layered it w/ the veg. chili, b/c "taco" in the title was misleading. My daughter said it tasted like "chili on a plate" which was fine by me b/c I tend to OD our family on weekly crockpot chilis. The chips on the bottom got pretty soggified, so next time I make this, will either serve w/ chips for scooping, or bake w/ chips on top.

While making this recipe I was thinking there are more like nachos not a taco casserole. Once trying to eat like nachos, I realized I def. needed a fork. Very yummy and super easy. I didn't have vegetarian chili, I used chili no beans. I was also out of lettuce so just topped with diced tomato and sliced green onion sour cream and salsa (and some valentine's hot sauce).

Perfect when you need to put a quick satisfying meal on the table.  I used Amy's organic chile and served a variety of toppings.  Chips got a little soggy.  Next time may try crushed chips on top instead of the bottom layer.

The only reason I am giving this a 4 star rating is because I had to altar the recipe. I only added one can of chili and I substituted 1 lb. of very lean ground beef for the other can. I sprinkled ground beef with 1 tsp. of chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon each of gartic and onion powder while I cooked it. This was very yummy and tasted just like tacos!

I gave this 5 stars because not only was it tasty but so easy to make and filling.  The next night when I ate leftovers, I added onion to the toppings.  Otherwise, I thought it was very good as submitted.  I suspect that it's got a lot of fat with the chips, cheese and sour cream--unless using low-fat varities, which I will try to do next time.

This is more like "loaded nachos" than a taco casserole.  Still tasty, and I'd definitely make it again, but with different expectations, and maybe more as an appetizer or game munchies instead of a dinner main dish.

Very easy! Would have been even easier if I didn't have to grate my cheese. I used organic vegetarian chili that had reduced salt, fritos scoops chips, and left out the sour cream. I doubled the recipe, but only used 3 roma tomatoes. I'm sure I'll make this again.

My family adores this recipe.  I add some scallions on top which look really pretty and taste great.  I also serve this with guacamole, sliced red bell peppers, and sliced cucumbers to fill out the meal.

This was really good!  It gave me bad heartburn, but that's because it has so many yummy things in it.  I used the vegetarian chili from Trader Joes because it is really tasty (and I'm so not vegetarian!)  My husband ate it kind of like nachos and I put it on a salad with ranch, which was GREAT.  Also, I used more chili to cover all the chips.

Delicious, quick, and simple. Literally threw the ingredients together and popped in the oven in less than 5 minutes. Used blue chips, and served with tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and salsa. I've made similar casseroles using leftover taco meat in the past, but appreciate this meatless alternative (which is equally hearty!).

I gave this 5 stars because it was so simple and still tasty.  It's not gourmet by any means, but it is definitely a hit with the family and with mom on a busy weeknight.  Tastes alot like a taco salad.

This was really easy to make, which I definitely appreciate, and I liked all the ingredients (including the specific brand of chili I used).  I'm not sure why, but the final product just didn't do it for me.

This was pretty tasty.  I didn't use as many tortilla chips as the recipe suggested, so that's probably why it turned out a little messy.  I added some  ingredients. I sauted onions, garlic, red pepper and jalapeno in olive oil with cumin, red pepper powder and oregano.  Then I mixed that with 1 cup rice, 1 cup cottage cheese and the vegetarian chili. I poured it over the chips and topped it with cheese.  Delish!

This was a huge hit in our house.  My son has just turned vegetarian and was glad to find this recipe.  It seems as if it would be very basic, but it's quite tasty and very easy.  Highly recommended.

This was really good, my hubby and mom loved it.  Make sure you use a good kind of chili, I think it would of been better with some home made, although a lot more time consuming!

I made this for lunch one day because I didn't know if it would be good or not. It seriously took about three minutes to throw together, and about twenty to bake, and I was done. No muss, no fuss. Very easy. The taste? Well, it obviously depends on the quality chili you use. We just used some generic stuff, but some higher quality would have made it even that much better. And if you are cooking for a picky person that won't eat anything except just the chili and cheese, it does just taste like chili and cheese on chips, but if you add everything like lettuce, sour cream, salsa, etc., it does make a VERY excellent taco salad taste. I would definitely make it again. It was very good. It might even be good to substitute some actual tortillas on the bottom instead of chips so it's mildly more healthy and even easier to serve.

I loved this!  More like taco salad for me!  Easy because I didn't have to simmer ground beef and taco seasoning!  I used two cans of Amy's Organic Chili.  Served with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, salsa, avacado and my own secret sauce for dressing!

It does not get much easier than this!!  I microwaved the chili first and then poured it over the chips added extra chips and cheese on top.  I put it in the oven until the cheese was melted.  This way the chips stay crispy.

I've heard it is good if you make it with doritos.  I think I would rather just have tacos.  I don't really like the mushy chips.

My family absolutely loved this and I have some picky eaters. I cooked the chips, beans & cheese only. The other items were in bowls (I did black olives too) and the kids liked putting their own items on it. It was easy and quick to make.I will be making it again.

Everyone ate it up! We added the topping individually. (lettece, tomatoes, sour cream, hot sauce, salsa, avocado, etc)  It was Nachos for the kids, and Taco Salad for us.  It tasted good and we ate at home instead of going out.

My vegetarian daughter loved this recipe. We couldn't find vegetarian chili, but did find an organic meatless chili that worked well. Not a recipe that can be reheated, but a great meal anyway. Thanks.

Quick and easy and vegetarian, which pleases my man.  :)  I liked it a lot!  I garnished it with sweet red onion and salsa.  Yummy.

This was ok. Nothing bad about it, but nothing great about it either. It's the kind of thing you really don't need a recipe for. It is like a veggie Frito pie.

This was delicious!  I had to quickly make another pan of it my family ate it all.  I never even mentioned that it was vegetarian and nobody noticed.  Definately will eat again and very soon.

This was excellent and so easy. I could not find vegetarian chili so I used a combo of turkey and beef chili and my kids loved it. I even doubled the batch and still did not have any leftovers.

This recipe is so quick and easy but tastes fabulous.  My fiance doesn't like the lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream or anything so I just fix half with that stuff and half without.  He loves it without as much as I love it with.  I now try to keep the ingredients on hand to fix for those nights when I'm tired or in a hurry.

I like the idea of the recipe.  Simple, quick, and a twist on traditional taco salad.  Just be careful to pick a chili that you love.  I bought Hormel Vegetarian Chili and didn't care for the taste of it.  Next time I will use my own leftover chili to make this recipe.

Very easy.  Very tasty.  My only revision next time would be to add the lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream to the casserole per person as they desire and not leave it on the casserole. We had leftover casserole and we do not like to heat up the condiments that have been added at the end.  That is our preference.  The casserole was very good and I would make it again.

Great after a long day at work! It is much better if you have leftovers of homemade chilli con carne. Also good to add guacomole or chopped avocado.

This dish was quite good and super quick to make but I made a few adjustments.   Instead of 6 cups of corn chips, I used 2 cups of blue corn chips.  Instead of 1 cup of vegetarian chili, I used 2 cups of chicken chili for more heartiness.  I also added a cup of grilled corn and topped off the dish with fried slices of jalapeno to add some heat.

I added hamburger with taco seasoning & black beans - it is a very simple basic recipe if you are not in the mood to cook.  I probably wouldn’t serve it if I were having guests.

Yum. I've made this twice in the past 2 weeks. Leftovers are iffy since the chips are already a little soft at that point, but all in all, a good way to use spare ingredients :) Thanks!

This recipe couldn't be any easier.  I had all the ingredients on hand so I decided to make it for Cinco de Mayo.  Not bad actually.  I used corn chips instead of tortilla chips and canned chili with no beans (with 3 men in the house I try and steer clear of beans).  I topped the casserole with sliced olives and served with fresh quac, salsa, sourcream, lettuce and tomato on the side.  Husband ate almost the entire thing by himself.  I think I'll try the spicy chili no-beans next time to give this a little more zip.  Great for a busy weeknight.  Will make this one again.

Interesting.  So while I was making this, I was scared and a little disappointed.  Then when it was done and I garnished it, and it looked better, I felt okay.  Then when I ate some, I almost finished half the pan by myself. I used Hot Chilli with ground beef and Jack Cheese.  I dont know if it was because it was flavored with hunger, but it was pretty  good.  Oh, and I'd call this "Nachos".

I made this last night and I have to agree with the previous review that it is nothing like a taco casserole but more like a frito pie. It was good though..I will make it on a lazy sunday afternoon from time to time...thanks for sharing

Loved it! My husband really loved it! I used 3 cans of chili and added sauteed onions, mushrooms, and red and green bell peppers. Super easy to make!

They call this frito pie here in Texas and everyone has their own version. I usually will make this with some homemade leftover chili (with beans) and it makes a quick and tasty supper. Top with any or all the fixin's.

I give this 4 stars because it's super easy, super quick, all-in-all a perfect dinner idea for the super-lazy (or busy).  It's very hearty, filling and, especially if you don't slouch on the toppings (I used avocado, frozen corn, lettuce, salsa and sour cream mixed w/taco seasoning) tasty. The quality of chili and other ingredients you use can make or break this one, obviously.  I used amy's organic chili.

5 stars for easy prep and super speediness, but ultimately only 3 or so for taste. Wasn't too bad though. Needed modifications, but I would probably make again with changes because it got on the table so fast! That's a plus!

It was a regular taco salad, which was pretty good, but my husband didn't like it at all. I followed the recipe exactly and he thought it was too dry.

Am I the only one that had a burning issue with this recipe? Granted, I used a larger baking pan (so some of the chips were still exposed when I put it in the oven.) But it started burning and smoking within 5 minutes. I mean, I know I didn't follow the EXACT baking pan measurements, but baking chips just doesn't really make sense to me.

I doubled the recipe and thus used a different size baking dish (rectangular).  I used a few fewer chips, and next time will use a little more chili (for the same size rectangular baking dish).  A hit with everyone in our family!  Easy to make and easy cleanup.  I must admit, having never made this before I would have liked to know if the chips were supposed to be broken or whole.  My experience is showing me probably whole.

We make a similar dish, without the baking, called Summer Chili. We put all the fixin's out, Fritos,  chopped lettuce, veggie chili, sour cream Roma tomatoes, Ranch dressing, olives, jalapeno peppers, cheese, and people build their own. It's popular for pot luck's, Sunday Family dinners and speedy dinners when there isn't a lot of time to prepare.

Thank you for this quick meal that tastes so great and fills the tummies of a bunch of growing boys all at the same time. They all  loved it. I do mix sour cream and cottage cheese to make the creamiest go further.  I also added my spices before popping the pan in the oven

I made it as written. I would make it again. The only change I would try is to break up the tortilla chips a bit before topping with the chili. The chips were in big pieces - easier to eat if smaller. It was quick, easy and the left-overs saved well.

I make a big pot of good, thick homemade chili, but always have lots left over  when just my husband and I are eating. I plan to use this recipe next time I have leftover homemade chili! I wish I could find a GOOD canned chili but so far haven’t found one.

My family always loved this dish.  I used to make it all the time when we went camping.  I would make individual servings on each of the plates.  We called it Instant Tacos.

I thought this was an excellent recipe as is or can be tweaked To change it up. I like the suggestion of adding diced chicken with chili beans. My family loves this stuff. Thanks for this quick and easy recipe.

I just used a bag of tortilla chips. I think that was too much. I used a 9x12 pan and 2 cans of regular chili with beans, probably could have used a third can. Overall, very good!

This was very simple to make for sure, but I found that it isn't very flexible in that you can't save leftovers or leave it too long or else the chips get soggy. I added green onion and that helped give a little flavour. 

You can't really go wrong with a combo of chips, chilli, cheese,  and extras but I don't think I would make this again. Although tasty it wasn't worth the oven time.

Used Fritos and added meat.  Will make again and try regular corn tortilla chips.  It was a hit and very easy to make.

Instead of salsa, I used taco sauce. I will be making it again because I use to make it as a salad with fresh cooked chili. I copied Taco Bell's taco salad. Very easy to make with canned chili that really taste like chili.

This is very simple to make and tastes great.  Took almost no time and I shredded the lettuce & cut tomatoes while the pan was in the oven.  Next time I think I'll add chopped onion to the toppings.

Five star easy! I like chili with beans so I used that, and added some onions and diced tomatoes, some Fritos on top along with the Sr. Cream and avocado for a crunchy topper and some black olives.  TOTALLY good

Pretty great and CRAZY fast. One warning (which I would have figured out beforehand if I'd thought about it): the leftovers do NOT reheat well.
