I was afraid to try this new recipe especially since I dumped in a pricey amount of walnuts and standard and mini chocolate chips, but they came out GREAT!  Since I am admittedly a sugar fiend, I found the cookies to be a little less sweet than I would like so I added about 1/2 cup of brown sugar for a total of 1 1/2 cups.  The cookies received excellent reviews from the family both before and after the sugar adjustment, though.  The exact quote from a grateful taste-tester was, "You outdid yourself this time."  Since canola is one of the wiser choices in terms of fats, and walnuts also reside in the relatively benign family of fats alongside canola (let's not mention the chocolate chips I added, though) I recommend this delicious oatmeal cookie to everyone.

Wow! Delicious. I've really been cutting back on saturated/trans fats and was so pleased to see a recipe for cookies that had canola oil! I didn't have quite enough brown sugar (but close) and since I am always looking to cut fat in baked goods, I did substitue half of the oil with drained (which is key for using it for baking) unsweetened apple sauce. I really LOVE these cookies. The only problem I have with these cookies, is that it is going to be so hard not to eat too many!!! Thanks.

Really delicious alternative to traditional butter-laden oatmeal cookies.  I was worried when I saw how crumbly the batter was (more like sticky wet granola), but I just went with it and they stick together to form soft, chewy cookies.  If you bake them until they are almost burnt around the edges, they are nice and crispy on the outside!

Thank you for all the nice comments and suggestions!  Sometimes we make them with the extra quarter cup of brown sugar that some have suggested. Sometimes we increase the baking soda to 1 tsp to get a fluffier crispier cookie.  (That adds sodium though.) Cal

Very good!  To make this low-carb friendly I substituted 1 cup Splenda and 1/4 cup sugar free maple syrup for the brown sugar.  I also used whole wheat flour and they still came out great!  Baking for 9 min at 350 deg seemed to be just right.

I had been searching for a soft oatmeal raisin cookie for a long time.  This is it!  I made the cookies a little larger, I got about 36 cookies from the batch.  The best part is that they stay soft for days, if they stay around that long.  My family and coworkers have enjoyed these very much.

These are so good!!! I try to bake only with canola oil, and am always on the lookout for good recipes for cakes and cookies.I don't think that there are many cookie recipes that call for oil instead of butter or margarine...Anyway, these cookies are fantastic (and for a cookie, kind of healthy...) and I've already made them several times, and will definately continue making them :@)I actually made them without raisins, and they still taste great (I added the 1/4 cup brown sugar that some other reviewers wrote about)My husband and two year old love them, and if they are going to nosh, I'd rather they eat these cookies than something else with bad fats and zero nutritional value. Thanks so much for the recipe :@) Update: I've been making these cookies with 1 1/4 cup LIGHT brown sugar (and no raisins) and (to me) they come out better this way... I make them at least once a week and EVERYONE who eats them asks me for the recipe...try them!

I make this every other month, when I have free time to bake. These always come out really well. I only use 3.5 cups of oats instead of the 4 that the recipe calls for, and instead, I throw in a cup of chopped walnuts to give it a little crunch. It always turns out really well, and my friends always ask for more. I love that it calls for vegetable oil instead of fat like many of the other recipes. I use vegetable oil to cook anyway, so that is something that can always be used in my house, but what am I supposed to do with fat? It's a good recipe that is easy to make. The dough is a little sticky so I set them  by rolling them into balls with two metal spoons, and then flattening it a little as I put it on the cookie sheet.

I JUST baked these cookies, and I have to admit that I was afraid that they would be too dry (one woman said that this recipe had the consistency of granola-- it's true!). However, they turned out great! I have a sweet tooth tooth, so I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar for taste, and I baked them for 18 minutes for a bit of crunch. This recipe is sooo easy-- I'm a bored college student baking for my friends on Memorial day! I will definitely be baking with this recipe again.

This recipe makes a great nutty flavored cookie that is not too sweet. I made them and they went like wildfire. I loved the way the Canola Oil and sugar mixed to create a paste that holds everything together. I thought the cookies might be oily, but that is not the case. These cookies really bring out the flavor of the rolled oats with a light taste of sugar and raisins. These are light cookies you can eat more than one of and not feel guilty.

These cookies are to die for!  I was looking for a soy-free, dairy-free recipe and this one fit the bill.  The only bad thing about these cookies is that I couldn't stop eating them.  I think I ate about 3 dozen in 3 days...yikes...at least oatmeal is healthy!!  Next time, I'd like to try this recipe with a little honey for a slightly different flavor.

I made a double batch of these cookies for Coffee Hour at church and they were a huge hit!  I used all whole wheat pastry flour (sifted), light brown sugar, light olive oil, quick rolled oats, and half raisins and half dried cranberries.  I called them Oatmeal Mystery Cookies and people had a lot of fun trying to guess what the unusual ingredient was (cranberries, of course.)  I used a cookie scooper and liked the fact that the rounded mound stayed round when baked.  Mine took 17 minutes convected at 325 degrees, and made 101 cookies in the double batch.  This is the best oatmeal cookie I have ever made, and so healthy!

From the start, this cookie batch looked great! It had enough liquid and raisins to satisfy your cookie needs! This is now my new favorite healthy oatmeal raisin cookie recipe! For my first batch though, I put 1/2 cup  brown and 1/2 cup white sugar. I put a little bit more spice to add more smell and flavor. I reduced the oats to 3 1/2 cup and I put in a little bit more raisins to satisfy my raisin sweet tooth. With those minor adjustments, these cookies came out delicious!

These are very good cookies, and knowing that they are made with canola oil instead of butter or margarine makes me feel even better about eating them.  I had some dried mangos that I needed to use, so I substituted them for the raisins.  I prepared the rest of the recipe exactly as written. The recipe doesn't specify, but I used quick oats, and the cookies were perfect. Thank you for sharing your very healthy recipe.

This is not to my liking.  The cookies flattened out and you had to overcook them for the middle not to be raw. I definately will not use this recipe again.

I've been searching for a cookie recipe that uses oil instead of saturated fats but still looks, acts, and feels like a traditional butter-laden cookie.  This is not it.  The cookies spread while cooking, and ended up thin and oily-looking.  The taste was fine, but the texture left me wanting.

Awesome! I was looking for an oatmeal cookie recipe that would approximate Oatmeal to Go, which I love, but I don't love all the ingredients. This cookie fits the bill, has no saturated fats, and is popular with my family. I made them much bigger so I could eat one for breakfast on the way to work. I got only 20 cookies instead of 48, but except for the longer cook time, I changed nothing. Very oaty, yet light, and plenty of room for nuts or whatever else you'd like to add.

These cookies stay soft and chewy for days, if they last that long. They're the best tasting oatmeal raisin cookie I've ever had and anyone that I've shared them with feels the same. They're very easy to make, too.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were just okay. I made them for a school function and there were other oatmeal raisin cookies there that tasted much better. Will keep looking for a "go-to" oatmeal cookie recipe.

great cookies. Takes my fear of trans fats away by using oil instead of butter. I would add  some dried cranberries next time instead of raisins just for the color.  Nuts make this recipe even healthier....

i used applesauce instead of oil, wheat flour instead of white flour. it was good. couldn't taste the wheat flour. probably not as delicious as using oil or butter, but applesauce kept it sweet. i also used parchment paper on the cookie sheets.

Perfect Oatmeal cookie! I added the extra 1/4 brown sugar and reduced the oats to 3 1/2 cups. So glad I tried it.

I wanted oatmeal raisin cookies, but had no butter. I chose this recipe to make based solely on the fact that I had canola oil on hand. I read through the recipe, ingredients, instructions and many of the reviews. I then made this recipe exactly as written with only one exception. I added more nutmeg and cinnamon than called for as a personal preference. I have NEVER made cookies with oil. This recipe is amazing. The trick is to keep everything as written. Mix the oil, eggs and brown sugar for a long time to fully incorporate the oil. I used my kitchenAid stand mixer and just let it stir while I got cookie sheets and whatnot ready. When it resembled a thick honey colored mixture the consistency of molasses I added the flour/dry ingredients and let them fully incorporate. Add oats and raisins, done. Baked perfectly at time and temperature suggested and looked amazingly similar to the picture. Great recipe. Thanks.

i loved this recipe! i was also nervous about making it, but i thought it was worth a try. it does look like a sticky granola before it's baked. i increased the brown sugar a half cup (making it 1 1/2) as well as added about a 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda. they turned out great. the only thing i might change is to decrease the amount of oats by a 1/4 or 1/2 a cup. while i'm a fan of oats, others may like a more bready cookie. they're delicious!

AMAZING!!!   I changed things up a bit with this recipe... I added pumpkin pie spice instead of just the nutmeg, and I was out of raisins so I just dumped some craisins and chopped walnuts in... and they came out absolutely beautiful and delicious!!

Great cookies!  I substituted 1/3 of the oil with applesauce, and substituted chocolate chips for the raisins.  I used all whole wheat flour, and I think the sugar called for is plenty; in fact, next time I'll use less.  My 4 year old daughter's review: "they taste good!"

My husband, who has recently gone dairy-free, LOVED these!! The 6 of us that ate them couldn't stop and they didn't taste oily at all.  They looked a little strange like honey, gooey mix as I put them on the cookie sheet but baked up perfectly in 12 minutes.  I'm glad other reviewers suggested to flatten them, I did slightly and shaped them & they just spread very little. I didn't use raisins, but used white CC & dried cranberries as others had suggested.  I also doubled the nutmeg & cinnamon (glad I did) & added 1/8 cup of white sugar just to make sure they were sweet enough - I was worried after reading other reviews - but they didn't need it especially with the chips.  I always loved quaker oats oatmeal cookies, but these are my new fave!  So quick, easy & delicious - dairy-free or not!  Only wish I'd made a whole batch instead of half to sample!

Wow! I love oatmeal raisin cookies but have never found one that I could cook that tasted like the bakery. I cooked it exactly as written and would even consider an easy fixer for kids to help, mine did. I already have plans to fix a triple batch for church on Sunday.

This is a fantastic recipe. The only change I made was to use cranberries instead of raisins or walnuts, simply because I like cranberries better.  I also followed the recipe in that I added oats at the end, by degrees, a large handful at a time, and I had my cranberries mixed with oats before that. It made the fruit spread more evenly in the dough. The resulting mixture looks like oats with fruit glued with toffee. My cookies turned deep brown color because I used half brown sugar, half molasses sugar (which turned out pretty good) because I ran out of brown.  These taste best when served completely cooled, with a glass of milk.  My family loved the cookies, so I will be coming back to this recipe :D Next time I think I might try substitute one cup oats with one cup bran.

Geez these were oily! I think you'd be better off decreasing the amount of oats AND oil.  They stuck to one another when stored and crumbled once pulled apart.

easy, came out perfect!! used half the batch plain and added raisins and nuts to the second half; I also substituted baking powder (4 tsp) for the baking soda (I loathe that taste)and I must have made my cookies a bit too big cause I only had 36 at the end, but they are wonderful!!!!! now I must buy more oil...

There were so many oatmeal raisin cookie recipes available on this website that it was hard to pick one, until I came upon this one, which uses the canola oil rather than shortening or butter.  That being a BIG plus, I made them for the first time last weekend to sell at a local flea market.  I'd expected them to go well and they did, because oatmeal raisin cookies are always a favorite, but boy, did they get rave reviews from everyone who couldn't wait until they got home to try them!  Like quite a number of people who rated this recipe, I too found that they required a considerably longer baking time than what was given; I found 16 to 18 minutes worked fine.  Other than that, I found it was an easy recipe, easily prepared, with excellent results.  Thanks for submitting it, Cal!

I tried this after I realized I didn't have enough butter to make a traditional oatmeal cookie. They're very good and came out moist and chewy. I didn't have much vanilla extract, either - maybe 1/4 of a tsp., and I added an additional 1/4 cup packed of brown sugar. I also used 1 and 1/4 tsps. of cinnamon, no nutmeg. I would definitely make again.

This was a five star!  I did up the sugar only cause I like it super sweet,  and I left out nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon,  only for my own liking though! Would definitely recommend this! I didn't originally have any more white sugar and a lot of recipes call for the white and brown, so I was very happy to find this recipe!

I just made a batch of these and they are amazingly delicious. I love their crunchiness. I followed the recipe exactly except that, in order to make a low-sodium recipe out of this, I used EnerG baking soda substitute instead of the baking soda (using one tsp. of the substitute instead of 1/2 tsp. of regular baking soda), plus I left out the salt.  I'm so glad to have this recipe that uses oil instead of solid fats.  The cookies are not only crunchy and delicious, they're probably about as healthy as a cookie can get.

To reduce cholesterol and calories I substituted 1/2 cup splenda with 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 4oz of egg whites in place of the eggs.
I reduced the oats to 3 cups.
whip the oil,sugar,whites of eggs and vanilla for 2 minutes.
yielded 36 cookies.

Great cookie to make if you are out of butter! I had no butter, shortening or margarine but was craving cookies. I cooked them a bit longer only because I like a crisp oatmeal cookie. I also added chocolate chips instead of raisins only because we do not love raisins. Will make again for sure!!!!

I really liked this recipie.  I only had 1/4 cup of brown sugar, so I added that and substituted the rest with maple syrup.  Also I only had 3ish cups of oats, so I used coconut for the rest and instead of raisins I used almonds.  
They turned out super yummy and moist inside and crispy out.

love these! wrap them well in plastic and they stay soft and chewy longer.  They are also great with choc chips- Just omit the cinnamon and nutmeg and add twice as much vanilla for flavor.

These cookies were a HIT in my house!   I used 1/2c of whole wheat flour and 1/2c all purpose flour.  I also used extra virgin olive oil (I was concerned it would over power, but if did not). I was excited to find a recipe, like another reviewer said, without butter.  I used freshly grated nutmeg. They came out chewy yet crisp on the outside.  My daughter hates raisins, so to took out her portion before adding raisins.  I did use chopped walnuts in both batches. This is a keeper for sure!

These were so delicious and super easy to make! I'm currently based in China and it's super hard to find shortening or butter here. So I was soooooo happy to find a oil-based oatmeal cookies. Thanks for an awesome recipe, cal :-)

These were really good cookies!  I usually make the recipe on the box on the Quaker box, but these are richer and chewier and really soft!  I substituted whole wheat flour and didn't have nutmeg so substituted a dash of cloves instead!  Made a bigger cookie (pampered chef large scoop) and baked for 12 minutes to still have the cookie retain its soft n chewy texture.  These will be my favorite oatmeal raisin cookie recipe for now on!!

The texture of these cookies was very good.  I baked them for about 12 minutes and took them out when they still looked slightly wet on top.  These cookies don't spread much -- I got the nicest results when I formed them into balls with oiled hands and flattened them into patties on the baking sheet.  I added chocolate chips, which was a mistake -- it would have been better with just raisins, but maybe a little more, like a generous cupful.  I followed recommendations to add 1/4 cup of brown sugar, but I still found them to be blander than I like.  If I made these again, I would try 3/4 c brown sugar, 1/2 c white sugar, double the cinnamon and nutmeg, and add ground cloves.  Thanks for an overall good recipe with relatively nutritious ingredients!

So excellent. I was surprised at the look of the ingredients once mixed, but they turned out exactly how I like my oatmeal cookies. I mixed the dry together, and the wet together and combined. If you use a silicon baking sheet on top of your cookie sheet, there is no need to grease it. Oh, and if you are wondering, they aren't like granola once baked, they turn into delicious cookies!

Excellent cookie recipe!  All cookie were gone in like a day!  Dangerous for the waistline if you lack self control like my family. Honestly, very good. I added vanilla and extra cinnamon, but that is a personal preferance. Highly recomended.

I made this just to use up some canola oil I had on hand. I made it exactly as written, but I should mention that I used *unbleached* flour, and I baked the cookies for 11 minutes.
Oatmeal Raisin aren't my favorite kind of cookie, but even I was a little impressed with this. The Woman I Love, however, loves oatmeal raisin cookies, and she was wowed by this recipe. A bunch shared with the gang at her work also garnered rave reviews. I just made a second batch today, and gave 3 dozen or so cookies to my neighbors, keeping the rest for myself. I won't be surprised to hear more rave reviews from next door soon....

Great cookies...not overly sweet and keep well, if you can resist gobbling them up.  I made these with whole wheat pastry flour and added coarsely chopped almonds and a little wheat bran for extra fiber---not like this recipe wasn't healthy enough already! (: Before baking, the dough seemed like it was all oats, but it held together, and 
indeed the cookies puffed up nicely.  The result was just right...soft but not overly crumbly.   (If you like chewy, I would guess all-purpose flour will give you better results.) Restrained sweetness lets the spices and chunks of almonds show their stuff.

Very yummy!  Lots of oats in this cookie and it makes a nice chewy snack.  I also used half white flour and half whole wheat for a really nice healthy cookie and it turned out great.  I pressed them down slightly on the sheet before baking them as I read in previous reviews that they didn't flatten out while baking.  I will make this recipe again, Thanks Cal!!

There are so many oats in this recipe.  My son asked me why I was making granola, that is what the batter looked like.  The cookie tasted good, but was too close to granola then a cookie.  I would not make these again just because I was looking for a moist oatmeal raisin cookie.

Very good, and more healthful than a typical oatmeal raisin recipe. I increased the brown sugar slightly (maybe an extra 1/8 or 1/4 cup), and added an extra half cup of raisins, since some of the other comments mentioned that the cookies were not very sweet, and they turned out nicely.

Delicious!  I used 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar as suggested - I really wanted cookies and didn't have any chocolate chips or shortening or butter.  This was the perfect recipe.  They came out great.  Thanks!

I've made this recipe several times for my lactose intollerant daughter. No butter cookies are hard to find! I don't use chocolate chips(dairy) so I use cranberries and extra nuts. These are amazing! Even my dairy loving sons gobble them up!

This is a wonderful recipe.. I have made it as described, but also find that it is really easy to modify with great results. I've left out the raisins and added nuts, or left out the cinnamon and nutmeg, and doubled the vanilla and added 1tsp. of maple flavor. I've substituted cranberries for the raisins. And tonight I only had 2 cups of oatmeal, so added 2 cups of Raisin Bran to make up the difference. These cookies ALWAYS come out great!

Like others, I'm trying to replace saturated fats, so I had to try these.  I made per recipe and they turned out great.  Better after sitting in the tin overnight.

I went with the 1 tsp. of baking soda modification, and I have to tell you, these turned out to be the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever tasted! I was skeptical because there seemed to be too many oats. When I was scooping spoonfuls onto the baking pan, I thought the cookies would never hold together. Boy, was I wrong! They cooked perfectly. Two spoons up!

I've made these cookies three different times, each with different batter sizes. A-MAY-ZINGGGGGG! The texture, depth of flavor and that light crunch are absolutely sensational. These are definitely some of the best cookies I have ever tried. For my next batch, I'm thinking of halving the batter and replacing one cup of the oats with coconut flakes+omitting the raisins in favor pf chocolate nibs. I'm so excited!
Thank-you!

Delicious!!!  This was the best Oatmeal Cookie recipe I've made yet! They are chewy and not too sweet.  I even took the advise of another review and added 1/2 cup more brown sugar. Instead of nutmeg, I added another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I didn't realize they were going to spread as much as they did because my experience with oatmeal cookies is they never spread and I was left with hard balls.  So I flattened each before baking and they spread alot!  So the next pan I put in I made each cookie a little smaller and they were still pretty big.  The last pan I made them even smaller, but I didn't adjust the time and had them in just as long.  That last batch came out crunchy, but with a little dunk in milk they were great!  I only got 3 dozen out of this, but the larger cookies could be two.  I will definitely be making these again!  January, 2014 - I made these again and this time I was not thrilled at all.  I'd forgotten that I had made some adjustments the first time with the brown sugar, but this time I made different adjustments. I substituted the canola oil for applesauce and added mini chocolate chips instead of raisins.  They did not spread at all this time and were not sweet enough. :(  The oil must be the spreading agent.  I will not make the same mistake next time.

these are so yummy! Great for kids breakfast on the go even if they have sugar. I made half of what it says to add because 4 dozen was to much and I made them a little bit bigger SO GOOD! They baked perfectly too!

These are the best Oatmeal cookies EVER!!! They are slightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside...and the sugar to oat ratio is perfect. Most recipes have only 1 1/2 cups of oats and 2 cups of suger...these are actually Oatmeal cookies!!!! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I didn't have my usual recipe from the oatmeal container so I decided to try these. I like that this recipe does not use any shortening. Next time I'll try substituting unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil. Perfect Christmas present for dad.

I made a batch of these cookies because I wanted a snack (and didn't have any butter in the house, which is what my usual oatmeal cookie recipe calls for). I was pleasantly surprised! They have a much different texture than the oatmeal cookies I normally make, but I almost like these better -the chewiness is quite satisfying. I also like to throw chocolate & butterscotch chips in my oatmeal cookies, so it worked out fine that they aren't overly sweet (in fact, I prefer it that way). Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe will go in the "use daily" file because these cookies don't stay around for more than a few hours.  Everyone in the family loves the moist, tasty, rich cookies that are so much better than using butter.  I would recommend this recipe without reservation!

Very good.  Healthier using a veg oil instead of butter or margarine. I used safflower oil instead of canola oil. I increased baking soda to 1 tsp for a fluffier cookie. I used light brown sugar. Baked at 330 because I had dark nonstick pans. Otherwise no changes. Other reviewers are right, the dough looks like wet, sticky granola. I dropped it by the dinner spoon full (about tablespoon) onto the pans. Then wet my hand and shaped each drop into more of a ball or mound to compact the dough a bit. The cookies spread a little with baking but not much and resulted in a "normal" height and size cookie, very moist, soft/chewy and delicious. They are not as sturdy as a drier, traditional cookie. This recipe filled 2 cookie sheets. Next time I make this I may add a little more spice and brown sugar.

These cookies were delicious. Not too sweet -  chewy but with a nice consistency. I felt better about making them with canola oil and the one cup of packed brown sugar. Also, there was a lot of oatmeal used in the recipe and the raisins were just the right amount.

I made this recipe for Christmas with some changes.  I used spelt flour. Hit it with a little Tangerine zest(because I had them) and used roasted cinnamon.  My son says they are now his favorite.

These are good but missing the butter flavor and not quite spicy enough for me - I'd make them again though if I was out of butter like today. :)

Awesome recipe! Although I didn't have enough oil, I substituted with 1/2 oil and 1/2 Crisco butter flavored shortening.  Best oatmeal cookie.

The dough is dry, and there were quite a few raisins that were integrated into the dough.  I was concerned about the final product but it worked out.  They do not spread out so what you put on the pan is basically what you get (teaspon heap wise).  They were kind of bland even with the raisins.  I like that it calls for oil.  If I make them again I would add more spices.

These were a bit dry, but good.  Add apple sauce and/or less flour.  Maybe add a touch more cinnamon

When my 7-year-old son took a bite he made happy sounds.  I asked him with a smile, "So the cookies are a hit?"  He responded, "A hit??  No, these cookies are a KA-POW!". I'd made the following modifications, thanks to other's ideas: Used whole wheat flour, 2 egg whites+1 egg, 1/2 oil+1/2 drained applesauce.

I read the reviews and had to try the recipe right away.  Along with the raisins, I added chopped pecans, abt 1c., plus about 1/4 chopped almonds, just because I had them and wanted to use them up.   Mine took 15 minutes to bake - I wanted them crispier rather chewy.  Results are great.  My husband thinks they're amongst the best cookies I've ever made. The recipe gave me 8dz cookies.  I prefer to make smallish cookies.  We feel more "virtuous" taking two or three small cookies, rather 2 or 3 big ones;-) I'll be making these cookies again.

These were so great!  I thought they would turn out to be like granola, because they sure looked like it before baking them.  But no, they turned out to be great cookies!  And I even overbaked the first batch by about 10 minutes!  Very very good cookies.

I made the original recipe and it turned out wonderful.  The second batch I made I used brown sugar SplendaBlend, and the cookies did not spread out as much, not as sweet (I could have used a little more of the SplendaBlend), but they were still great.  My husband loves oatmeal raisin cookies and I think this recipe is just the one for him.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would!!! Super good. I added an extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar and exchanged nuts for chocolate chips then baked for 15 minutes. I ended up with about 60 of the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had! Yum!

Excellent!  I've made these twice using 1/2 c. applesauce for 1/2 of the oil each time.  The second time I made them I used 2 cups of rolled oats and 2 cups of quick oats.  I liked them that way better.  These are delicious.  They will be a healthy addition to my family's snacks.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Not at all what I wanted in an oatmeal cookie.  Too much oatmeal and not enough sugar.  I did add sugar to what was left in the bowl after trying the first batch.  That helped a little, but there was still way too much oatmeal.  I won't be making this recipe again.

I made these for my husband and he just raved about them!  I added an extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar like someone else had suggested and he said they were the best he'd ever had.  I'll definitely make these for him again. Thanks!

Perfection! My favorite oatmeal cookie recipe! I didn't think there was a need for extra sugar (as some reviewers said). I added 1/2c chopped walnuts too!

I gave the recipe only 4 stars because I felt I needed to make some changes. I added an additional 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 cup chocolate chips as well as using 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup canola oil instead of an entire cup of oil. These cookies were moist, thick and delicious, and a hit at home. Will be using this recipe again and again.

Mixed feelings on this recipe... The instructions should have stated to flatten the balls of cookie dough before baking- since they barely spread at all and I ended up with some very small but thick cookies. It really affected the entire eating experience of it for me. Also, the cookie seems rather crumbly too...

If you want a healthy-choice cookie, this is it! Like another reviewer, I used whole-wheat flour and added cranberries & chocolate chips, and wow, what a combination! I also doubled the recipe and since there is no butter to beat, it's quite easy to make this dough (no mixer required). I'll be sure to make these cookies again and again. YUMMY.

I made these oatmeal cookies for Christmas and I am very dissapointed.  I followed the recipe exactly- double and triple checked following the recipe and even read over each and every ingredient with my husband to make sure.  The cookie dough did not bind together.  I had to roll it into balls as best I could and smash them onto the cookie sheet so it would hold together. When they were finished baking they fell apart when transfering to the serving platter even with the gentlest touch.  They tasted good but they really didnt look very good either.  They were mounded looking and not very appetizing as far as looks were concerned.  I will not make these again.

These cookies are out of this world!! I did make one partial substitution...I don't know if it would have mattered much in altering the great taste and wonderfully chewy consistency but... instead of 1 cup oil,  I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup butter. I will be making these again maybe as soon as I finish eating this batch!  :)

Batter seemed really guey to be able to make cookies with. But they came out good. I will next time though cut down on the oats and increase the flour and the raisins. I did boil the raisins first. Will see how the family likes them.

I followed the recipe to the letter and they came out wonderfully.  I found them to be very moist and chewy (just like I like a cookie to be).  My grandchildren are thrilled to be able to have a cookie as an OK snack.

Very good cookies! Slightly crisp/crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I made sure to toss the raisins in flour first since they were sticking together and I baked them on wax paper with a touch of non-stick spray instead of greasing the pan with margarine or butter. I will definately make these again..too easy!

I made these, and I am not sure if I did something wrong, but they didn't flatten out at all.  They just stayed round.  Also, the flavor wasnt what I expected from an oatmeal cookie.  But on the up side, they are much healthier then regular cookies . . . that is important to me.  I will make these again for myself when i am having a sugar craving, but I am pretty sure my kids wont eat them and I wouldnt make them for company.

Made this with old-fashioned oats and finely chopped raisins.  Added a touch more vanilla, too.  The result was a chewy, delicious cookie that had just the right amount of sweetness for us.

Didn't have nutmeg this time so we used a little Allspice. Made a good substitute.  This is a family favorite. We also make these without the spices and add chocolate chips instead of raisins. Very yummy!!

This is so scrumptious! After my family tasted the first batch, that 'leave 5 minutes to rest' step didn't stand a chance coz all got snatched as soon as they came out from the oven! And it is also so easy and so simple to bake. I'm suddenly a baking star to my boys today...after years of going on baking-strike. Hahaha... THANK YOU!

I was so excited to find a recipe that called for oil instead of butter or shortening, but I was also skeptical.  I was very pleased with the results!  The only change I made was reducing the oats to 3.5 cups.  I may reduce it to 3 cups next time just to experiment.  My add-ins were chocolate chips and raisins and my kids gobbled them up.  Next time I would like to try raisins and chopped up dried apples.  I will make this again for sure!

They taste great but look a tad odd (compared to picture) I didn't add nutmeg, raisins, and I put the dough in the fridge for an hour other than that I made them exactly as stated (1/2 the recipe). They came out crunchy/chewy and I love how they are a healthy option. Obviously not what I had anticipated based on the picture but maybe it's because I used the correct amount of oats compared to others? They don't taste too sweet either but that's okay because it tastes great regardless. I will definitely make again if I'm feeling the need to be healthy and use up some of my oats! Thank you!:)

I like the texture and appearance alot. Good taste.
I was curious about using oil in cookies and was pleasantly surprised how well they turned out.

I have to admit I made some changes, but this has become one of my go to recipies!
My Modifications: I use Quick Oats (because that's what we have in the house) I use Craizins instead of raisins, I follow GRAPESWHIZ's advice and use 1.5c brown sugar instead of just 1, and this last time I added white chocolate chips. Without the white chocolate chips they are very yummy, with the white chocolate chips they're decadant!!!
I found they spread just enough and cooked perfectly in 11 min (in my oven). They were soft and chewey to begin with and crisped up as they aged, yummy either way.
Really love this recipe!!!!!

I was skeptical at first in using 1 cup of oil for a cookie recipe, but after reading the reviews, I tried it and was amazed at how tasty this cookie is. I used half raisins half dried cranberries and thought the cranberries added more interest.

For someone who's never baked cookies before, these came out pretty yummy. I modified the recipe based on the other reviews that stated these were not sweet enough and too bland.

I used 3 1/2 cups Quaker rolled oats, 1 1/4 cups of sugar, 1/3 cup raisins and the rest chopped walnuts, and a generous spoonful of the spices. (The same amount the recipe calls for, just a tad bit more) The batter came out grainy and loose so I hand molded them into the baking dish instead of spooning.

Well, like I said, I've never baked cookies before so I didn't know how to shape them. My cookies came out HUGE. They don't spread that much, so the way they went into the oven is basically the same way they came out :/ I got about 15 cookies instead of the 48 the recipe calls for. I'm just lucky that the first (and only) batch came out great I guess. I baked them for about 16 minutes. They looked a little strange coming out of the oven but I guess that was my fault. 

I was surprised that they tasted delicious. Not oily at all like some reviewers said. Crispy around the edges. Not chewy, but crumbly and soft on the inside. My husband doesn't care about texture or appearance... as long as it tastes good. He loved them and loved that they were healthy but they were a little sweet. (I thought the sweetness was perfect but the cinnamon was a bit strong)

I'll be making this again whenever we have a cookie craving.

It was OK, but definitely not fantastic.
My guilty pleasure is eating oatmeal cookie dough. When I went to make some tonight, I realized I was out of butter, so I searched for a recipe I could use oil with. I stumbled upon this. The first problem was that the dough was so dense. I was right, it just wasn't good. I guess the butter coats the sugar molecules differently? So, I actually cooked them this time.  Mine turned out a bit fluffy with a slight crunch, which I'm sure tons of people love, but for me, I wanted a nice chewy cookie- this wasn't it. My husband will like them, but I'm definitely going to save my guilty pleasure for when I actually have butter in the house next time.

These did come out a little drier and not chewy as I had expected but they are very good when washed down with some coconut milk!  Yum!  I also ate them hot so they may be better once cooled.

Used 1/2 Canola oil, half apple sauce, added 1 cup walnuts, and  1/2 tsp allspice, but followed the recipe, other than those adjustments. Baked 8 minutes. Really enjoyed them.

This was definitely better than first recipe I tried for Oatmeal Raisin cookies.  This still needs work though.  I added maybe 1/4 cup more raisins than recommended.  I also did 1/2 cup canola oil and 1/2 butter instead of 1 cup canola oil.  Turned out very good.  Also tossed in two varieties of some small seeds.  They added some flavor but not much.  You knew that they were there.

Excellent cookies! Moist, not too sweet, just sweet enough. I used 3 1/2 cups of oats, whole wheat pastry flour, a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and a heaping 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. Turned out great!

These were great! I halved the recipe for a trial run, but I wish I had made more. I subbed half the oil for applesauce and added a few more tbsps of oatmeal. They are nice and soft inside and since I baked them a few mins extra, they're crunchy on top. They are not crumbly, dry, or cakey. I love that these are so much healthier than other recipes I've seen and they still taste awesome!

I used dark brown sugar instead of light and golden raisins since that's what I had at home. They turned out yummy! I did have to add a couple minutes to the baking time (14), but i think that's because I made them too large since the recipe only made 3 dozen instead of 4.

Delicious recipe and easy to make. I left the first sheet in for about 14 minutes and they look beautiful, but are a little well done. Next sheet I left in for about 12 minutes and that seemed about right. The cookies are very soft when they first come out of the oven. I had to let them cool on the tray for a while before transferring to cooling racks. I halved the recipe and came out with 18 cookies. I love how the recipe uses vegetable oil instead of butter or margarine.

I used craisins instead of raisins and thought these were delish.  A cookie I don't feel bad about eating!

This is a very good recipe. But I do agree that they need just a tasd bit more sugar. I also soaked my raisins in rum before hand. These are great for my husbands diet. Very Yummy!!!

I had to change my rating.  Initially, I did not care for them.  I glazed them with icing and made breakfast cookies for my kids.  They have less sugar than a packet of instant oatmeal and they love them!

I have been looking for a good oatmeal raisin cookie recipe and I definately found it!  I made these last week and my teenage son devoured them! I did add an extra 1/2 cup brown sugar as one other review suggested.  They came out perfect!  I wonder though, has any body attempted using 1/2 cup applesauce to replace some of the oil to make it lower in fat?  I just wonder how much it might affect the texture.

I made these, and was suspicious that something would go wrong because there were so many oats and the batter was thin. Once they were cooked, they spread out all over the pan and completely stuck, even though the pan was greased. I am currently soaking the pans in water trying to get these off. I would never make these again.

These were very good.  I made these completely vegan by substituting 1 tbsp cornstarch and 2 tbsp water for each egg.  Also used vegan choc. chips in place of raisins, because some in the house dont like raisins.  I am sure they would be delish with raisins, or even craisins! YUM!  Thanks for the delicious recipe.

Great recipe!  I would prefer a little extra sweetness, next time, I might add some chocolate chips.  I love this because I am dairy-free and it is hard finding recipes that I don't have to alter.  Thanks!

I made this recipe for Father;s Day, because it's my Dad's favorite cookie. I wish I would have used a a different recipe.   There are too many oats (4 cups)in this recipe, its very similar to a soft granola bar.  I compared it to other recipes I have for similar cookies, and this recipe has twice the amount of oats!      Next time, I will use 2 cups of oats, and substitute half the canola oil for applesauce (gives it a great flavor), and add some walnuts or pecans.

Tried it; loved it!  I used WALNUT OIL instead of canola and the cookies turned out great.  I also added walnuts. I cut the entire recipe in 1/2 first time, and was concerned it may fall apart as it was a 'loose' mixture. So I balled them well, flattened a little, and they are fabulous!!  Hubby loves 'em too.

I never tried an oatmeal cookie before and I loved how simple making this recipe was. They went quickly. Baking things that my 20 month old son can actually eat is really special. Heloved them so much. I plan on baking them as a regular treat for him.

Absolutely awesome.  Wouldn't make a single change in the recipe,  Moist, chewy, and much better for you than shortening or lard ones.

This recipe is definitely a "keeper"  Everyone loves them and they are soooo simple to make...Everyone is ususally eating them as they come out of the oven. They have the oat taste...which is a plus and they are somewhat crispy...DELICIOUS!

Very good cookie, I wish it were a little more chewy but it is fabulous.  I used Grapeseed oil because it is all I had. It is really tasty.

I was craving oatmeal raisin cookies and made these.  I was disappointed.  They turned out really dry (fall apart in your hands) and not very flavorful.  I won't make it again.  Back to full fat!  Sorry.

I would have given it 5 stars except like other reviewers said, it was too much oil. I could see it on top of the cookies even though I modified the recipe. I'm glad I cut the oil with 1/2 oil 1/2 unsweetened applesauce. I do that in a lot of recipes. Next time I will use flax seed meal to replace even more of/eliminate the oil. Otherwise this was a great recipe for dairy-free oatmeal raisin cookies.

I really, really liked this cookie. Not too sweet. Loved that it uses canola oil. It is a yummy, light cookie. And the smell while they are baking made me want to make yet another batch!  Thanks so much Cal for posting this recipe, it's going in my "keeper" box.

The dough looked like it wouldn't hold together, but it worked out fine! Nice and moist. I also substituted half of the oil with applesauce. I didn't have any nutmeg, so I put in a dash of cloves instead. I got several compliments on how good the cookies smelled. These were relatively healthy (as cookies go) and not too sweet. I will definitely be making these again!

It was heavier than the oatmeal raisin cookies I'm used to (I used extra thick rolled oats), and much healthier tasting!  It reminded me of those Kashi cookies.  I was nervous as they were baking, because they looked pretty liquidy in the oven, but came out very good.  I made them a little bigger and have one as my breakfast bar!

These cookies were a HUGE hit at our house. Oh they were so good! I did make a few changes, though.
Instead of a whole cup of oil, I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 butter; I used white wheat flour instead of white; I also used 4tsp baking powder instead of soda and I didn't use 4 cups of oatmeal. As I was adding it, it seemed like an awful lot of oatmeal, so I used about half of that!
These turned out sooooooo good, I must say! We'll be making these often!

These were great.  I did 1/2 butter, 1/2 oil. I also diced up a peeled apple and added 3 cups oats 1 cup whole wheat flour.

They are yummy. Thanks for the recipe.

Finally an oatmeal cookie recipe without 2 sticks of butter in it! I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce and they turned out great. The cookie dough is a little on the watery side though; it's a bit hard to work with. Overall a wonderful cookie. Thanks!

Very good for useing oil, I would of liked them to spread out more but I guess butter/marg does that best.
Next time I'd cut back on the raisens, 1 cup was too many, they did'nt mix in well enough with the batter.
I'd make them again for the point of cutting out the bad fats.

I really enjoyed these cookies.  I halved the recipe, and I was able to get 36 cookies instead of 24.  I used a 1 tablespoon of dough for each cookie.  It's a very simple recipe to halve.

I was a little scared at how little liquid there was, so I added 1 T. of melted butter.  I think it gave these cookies a light crunch and were very good, and the liquid would have been just fine with out the butter.

They are quick easy, good for you, lower in sugar and fats than most cookies.  The cookies are a bit rounded, not flat, but I like them that way.  Thanks Cal!

I 1/2’d the recipe (didn’t have enough ingredients, really craved oatmeal raisin cookies, & didn’t have enough time to thaw out frozen butter that most recipes call for). 
To me, it was just ok, prefer butter, but my husband likes them & that’s alright by me.

Really terrific and so easy. The batter does look a big funny but the cookies turned out terrific. I'll try them with chocolate chips next time.

THE best!  I make them at least 1x/month.  I add mini chocolate chips often.  Love how crunchy the oats are!
My granddaughter loves to make them.  I make them smaller than larger.  They never flatten as the reviews say
Thanks Cal for the recipe!

My biggest question before making this, when I was skimming through reviews, was: is this a five-star recipe because it is healthier or is it a five star recipe that happens to be healthier?    I was hoping for the latter.    My conclusion is somewhere in the middle.  It is not obvious that the cookie is a health-cookie, and it is very tasty.   The addition of chocolate chips was essential in my opinion.  However it is not swoon worthy as my other Christmas cookie recipes are, including my happen-to- be dairy-free ginger snaps.    A great “everyday” cookie or treat and a nice option for dairy-free, but don’t count on it as a omg amazing holiday cookie.

i guess mine were a bit bigger, so I had to bake them for an extra 10-15 minutes- they did seem to collapse in the middle the first time I checked.  They tasted better the next day in my opinion - just like granola!  Good for a quick healthy breakfast.

This is my favorite cookie ever! and I thought chocolate chip cookies were my favorite. Well... not anymore! I slightly modified the recipe so it's more doughy and less oatmealy (if that makes any sense at all).  I make it with 2 cups of flour and 2 to 3 cups of oatmeal instead.

I followed the recipe exactly. The cookies were WAY to sweet and the dough was almost to crumbly to form into cookies shapes. Even my husband, who has a sweet tooth, said they were too sweet for him. I won't be making these again.

I don't know if I didn't follow directions but the batter seemed very thick like I'd expect oatmeal cookie batter to be but then I realized I had a cup of oil in a measuring cup and thought I must have forgotten to add it in?  So the batter was super oily (I probably poured 1/4 cup out like it was hamburger grease!) but I/we love the taste and texture!  Not greasy at all; nice and crispy!  I added some organic toasted quinoa to soak up some of the oil and that was a nice touch (I might have added 1/8-1/4 cup).  I'm definately going to make these again and will see if I actually used too much oil or not!  I don't agree with some other reviewers that say they need to add more sugar.  I found it to be just right!

I substituted 1/2 c applesauce for 1/2 c oil and added 1/4 c light brown sugar more. I kept burning the bottoms at 350 so I used 325, which worked perfectly.

These are delicious, I made them last week for my dad who is diabetic so I used Splenda brown sugar blend and he loved them (so did I). I’m going to make them today with coconut oil and add some coconut flakes just for fun. This recipe is a keeper!

These were great, I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of Canola.  I halved the serving size to 24.  There is a lot of sugar in this recipe and next time I will try substituting with some honey.  These are easier to make if all dry ingredients are mixed first and then add the oil and egg mixture.  They disappeared from the cookie jar pretty quickly so I will definitely have to make another batch.

I used olive oil instead of canola, and less of it, 200 ml. Also I used whole-wheat flour and decreased the amount of sugar by half. Came out great.

Easy recipe made some tasty cookies. I baked them 10-12 minutes and they came out soft and chewy. I added some toasted walnuts, butterscotch chips and some crumbled chocolate bar bits. Will use his recipe again for sure.

I was looking for a soft but relatively healthy oatmeal raisin cookie to bake for a rest stop during a cycling event.  After reading reviews I followed this recipe exactly (very unusual for me, actually!). And unfortunately, I quadrupled it.

The cookies turned out just OK.  I didn't think that they were sweet enough.  It felt like more of a breakfast bar than a cookie.  The next batch I make, I'll look for more sugar and there has to be some clove!  Overall, an OK recipe.

I really liked this recipe but definitely one for people who like a cookie that is more oats than cookie. 

I used old fashioned oats which gave it a really good texture but mine didn't look like the picture because of this. 

These were plenty sweet enough for me and I didn't add the salt. 

Next time I will try with only 3 cups of oats to get a bit more coookie texture. 

Will happily be putting these in the kids lunch boxes as they are substantial and nut free.

Mixed in our KitchenAide Mixer and when we baked the first pan the cookie dough balls didn't settle out into nice circular cookies but stayed as balls, we then pressed the remaining cookie dough balls out into cookie rounds before baking.
Made the recipe just like it stated. Seemed to be a very dry oatmeal raisin cookie.

The dough was "runny".  I ended up adding more flour, but wasn't precise in measuring what was added.  I think the right mix might be more like 3/4 c oil to 1 1/4 c flour. 

It was very easy to mix, though.

I tried this recipe because of the huge number of superlatives. Sorry I did because they tasted like diet cookies. No flavor even after adding a quarter cup brown sugar. Too much oats per flour. Like someone else, they tasted like eating raw oats (and I did use the 1-minute Quaker). The only thing good to report is the fact that they stayed soft when tightly covered.

The flavor was amazing.  I had to use an egg substitute record because I didn't realize I was out of eggs..that made my dough to dry so I added  1/4 cup vanilla almond milk.I loved these but they turned out really hard

just made these for my husband...yummm!  ran short on raisins so added dried cherries--DOUBLE YUMMM!!  will attempt subbing applesauce for oil hoping to make them more figure friendly but, either way--they make GREAT ICE CREAM SANDWICHES! :)

I didn't like the looks of this recipe from the start. The cookies basically melted in my oven and i had to overcook them to get the right consistency. This recipe was edible, but not the best.

Really good cookies! Instead of raisins I did chocolate chips in one batch and the other batch I added apples. They were great and soft.  I ran out of butter and wanted to substitute it with what I had

Alright!  I read other reviews, but followed directions exactly.  Here's the deal...flavor, on point.  But, the texture is that of a more "healthy cookie".  And, they are not as pretty to look at.  That is why I give three stars But, they taste DELIGHTFUL, and my guy ate them three at a time!!

The oil really affects the end result. If you have problems with the cookies falling apart like I did, add an extra 1/4 cup of Brown sugar. I cut the the Oats down to 3 Cups. I tried plain rolled oats and a second batch with Instant Oatmeal packs. The Instant Oatmeal packs gave me a better result. Buttering the pan is essential to keep the cookies from sticking. Butter or oil will suffice. Happy Baking!

I don't think I have ever given a bad review before but this was just terrible. Dry, tasteless, and the worst part was having wasted so many things in order to make it. I will try to salvage it by crumbling into milk to eat like a cereal or something, and by adding more sugar. Very disappointed.

I needed to make some cookies for a friend to say thank you for babysitting.  I was craving oatmeal and went to find a recipe... wish I had kept looking... I made granola our of it.  They did not stick together unless man handled.  Wish I had kept the box that the oatmeal came in that recipe never fails!

These are definitely different from traditional oatmeal cookies but nonetheless a very good cookie. I upped the amount of brown sugar per many reviews and subbed ginger for the nutmeg, the finished cookie was sweet and very flavorful. Had no trouble with the dough flattening nor spreading, I did bake them on the top oven rack at the designated temp, and let them cool a minute or two before removing from the pan. I used chocolate chips instead of raisins, probably coconut and craisins would also be good. Next time I will reduce the amount of oats as many have suggested, think that will only improve the recipe. Love not having to deal with butter or shortening.

I used dried cranberries and white chocolate chips for a variation - loved it. I used to evade oatmeal raisin cookies. These are now my most favorite cookies!

I loved this recipe but I made a few of my own changes. To make it lower in fat I use apple sauce instead of oil. also I used Honey instead of sugar.. I thought this would come out soupy but it came out wonderfully! My daughter is allergic to eggs so I use Flax seed for all my recipes that call for egg. They came out so wonderful  I couldn't believe it! defiantly a keeper! super healthy and a great grab and go snack! :)

I just pulled these out of the oven and they are fabulous!!! The only changes I made were adding 1 1/2 Cups of brown sugar instead of the 1 Cup.  I also used Quick Oats.  My 5 year old is dancing around the kitchen asking for another one.  I will make these again really soon.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Good cookies, but they lacked that "ooomph".  Next time I will try adding a half teaspoon of ground cloves to the batter, and will also try the applesauce that others have suggested.

4c. oats is too many! Since I dumped them in and it was too thick and crumbly, I added a cup of applesauce and another egg and they turned out fine. Not as sweet as I would like...next time I will double the brown sugar!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used "quick oats". The flavor was quite good as it is, but next time I will add the recommended extra 1/2 cup of sugar, perhaps a little more salt, and switch to white-wheat flour from all-purpose. Very easy to make, so would be great to do with kids. No mixer required!

Pretty good cookies...my two year old loved them. I substituted the Splenda Brown sugar mix for the regular brown sugar and they tasted fine. I think next time I will use half the oil and half applesause instead.

I didn't butter the cookie sheet but instead used parchment paper. Used vegtable oil in place of the canola. These were just okay but they were really easy make. I will need to add much more sugar next time because they were just not sweet and were rather bland. Should have took the sugar advice from other reviews:( Will try again with more sugar.

Good recipe.  Mine turned out very dry ~ but I think it's because I used thick cut quick oats, not the regular quick oats.  I did as others suggested and used 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. natural applesauce too, maybe that contributed to the dryness.

This was good, and would have been really good, except that it tasted a little oily. If I try it again, I'll cut the oil with apple sauce to see if that helps.

This is a very different cookie then most oatmeal raisin. I enjoyed the texture of the cookie and also that it wasn't very sweet. I recommend this cookie for its nutritional value, especially if you're on a restricted diet.

Crispy and chewy at the same time, and very wholesome. I substituted applesauce for half the oil, and reduced the sugar a bit, adding some molasses. The raisins and oats easily separate from the dough, so you have to work a little to spoon them on the sheets.
