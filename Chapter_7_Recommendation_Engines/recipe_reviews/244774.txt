It’s a very dense bread but my family ate it up and the flavor is great so I’ll probably make it again. Maybe try increasing the yeast.

I followed recipe exactly but the loaf did not turn out at all.  The yeast was fresh and the dough rose fine at first but then didn't rise at all during second rising or baking.   When it was done, it looked exactly like it had when I took the paddle out, only baked.

This turned out well. The crust was a bit dark, but it was soft and had a nice taste.
