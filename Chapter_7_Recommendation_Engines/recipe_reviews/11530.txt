these spread out loads so its probably best to stick to the 1/3 cup per cookie. these looked lovely in the flower pot, my daughter gave them to her childminder for her christmas present who loved them

These cookies taste good. I put different color food coloring in the dough to make them look yucky for halloween.

i made a half recipe which produced 8 cookies. Baking a cookie for 25 minutes did produce a pretty cookie that will stand up to being on a stick but the cookie itself was a bit dry and crumbly when eaten. Not my favorite chocolate chip cookie.
