Easy dough and sauce recipe. I made two 14 pizzas they were very thick crust that's the way my family likes it. I had an extra cup of sauce left because I only made two pizzas. The dough ended up taking 7 cups flour plus extra to knead to keep from getting sticky. Alternate the toppings to fresh zucchini and mushrooms from the farm. And BBQ chicken yum!!!

Pretty good!  Crust is a bit on the chewy side, however if you make it real thin it's excellent. 
The sauce is very tomato-ey for us, would have liked more flavors blended in, 7 year old granddaughter liked the sauce the least.  We use "Irish garlic sausage" that we feel tastes much better on pizza.  We get this in the sausage section of our local grocery store that is a nationwide store.

My first attempt at making a homemade pizza. It actually turned out quite well, and was very tasty. Now I also know how to make my own crust and sauce from scratch, so I thank you for sharing.

This makes the best pizza crust ever. We topped ours a little differently and used another sauce but definite keeper for the crust. YUM!

A keeper for the crust - makes a LOT if you are going with a thinner crust. I used a jelly roll pan and only used half the dough. I had to make some modifications to toppings because I was out of several ingredients, but I will update when I remake with the original recipe.

Note: Froze half the dough. Looking forward to thawing and using the pre-made dough the next time. I will thaw the dough in the fridge overnight and then put on counter to continue to bring to room temp and rise further for a couple of hours before cooking. Hope it works out with this dough - definitely a good recipe.
