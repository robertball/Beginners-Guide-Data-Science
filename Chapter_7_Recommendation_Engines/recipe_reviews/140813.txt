Substituted Gulden's spicy brown mustard for the yellow mustard and used purple onions for color - yum! Due to lactose intolerance, I used tofu sour cream and it turned out great.

Excellent recipe! I made no fundamental changes, I just never peel my potatoes, everything else stays the same. Went over extremely well at the potluck, it was the first dish to run out!

I really really wanted to like this. It just wasn't for us. My husband said " this isnt your potato salad".

Really wanted to like this one more than I did.  It had very little flavor and the chunks of potato were much too large.  Wound up mashing some of the potato to get a creamier consistency and doctoring it quite a bit before the flavor was right.

I love this recipe although I did make a few changes. I didn't use the peppers in the recipe. I used red and green peppers and red onion. I didn't have any dill weed or red pepper flakes so I used some smoked paprika and cayenne pepper. I used garlic powder instead of a garlic clove. I also boiled the potatoes with onion salt-this makes a big difference in flavor.
