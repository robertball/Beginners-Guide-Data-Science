I was very excited to try this recipe and was not dissappointed. I did make a couple changes, used baby bear pumpkins for single serve portions, did not use all suggested veggies, and forgot to put in the seasonings, and it turned out very yummy. I will definatly make this again before the pumpkins are gone for the season and will try different veggies and italian sausage instead of the kiebasa. this will be a halloween tradition from now on as it is very filling, perfect before heading out to trick-or-treat.thank you for a fabulous recipe.

This was sooo yummy. I'm just a little disappointed I couldn't get a better picture! I bought a real Cinderella pumpkin and it was gorgeous. Anyway. After 3 hours of the filled pumpkin being in the oven, I pulled it out to take a look, and the flesh was so soft that it cracked and fluid started leaking everywhere. I tested the filling and it wasn't quite cooked :( So, I thought, nothing for it; scoop it out and cook it some more. I put all the filling back in my big pot and simmered it for an additional 30 minutes or so. After all the filling came out of the pumpkin, though, it couldn't hold itself up anymore, and collapsed completely. I scooped up some flesh and added it to my pot, and saved the rest. So, next time, I don't think I will pre-bake the pumpkin, as it seemed unnecessary. I might also try lentils as a good sub for the brown rice. The only other thing I would change about this recipe is to double the meat; each bowl only had about 3 slices in it, and my man likes a little more meat than that. But, wow! Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I used garlic sausage since I had it on hand, and cut back on the cooking time by a couple hours. (Cooked the pumpkin for 1hour at 400 and 1 hour at 350, then added the filling and continued cooking for 30 min.)  The pumpkin was a little charred on the outside and not nearly as pretty as it could have been, but it was fully cooked and everything tasted wonderful.

I used a small acorn squash I had at home and veggie sausage. Turned out fantastic. Since my squash was small and a lot of vegetables. I just mixed the squash with the rest of the veggies. Thank you!

This was excellent.  we used double the kielbasa which was a good idea.  We also did not pre-cook the pumpkin and it was completely fine.

I'm always looking for pumpkin recipes to use up the fall pumpkins I set on my porch.  this recipe was easy to make and tasty..  I used Italian sausage, cabbage and potatoes, because that is what I had.  It had really good flavor.  I roasted the pumpkin for an hour at 400, then filled it with the soup mixture and cooked for another hour.  I think three hours would hav3 been too long, as the pumpkin  was tarting to fall apart.
