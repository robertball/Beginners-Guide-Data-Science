These were rather easy to make and turned out quite tasty. The potato flakes make for a crispy outer shell. Double the sauce trust me it's that good. I can think of plenty of thing that this sauce would be good on.

These dino eggs are a fun option for breakfast or lunch. i did amp up the spices in the hash and Italian bread crumbs for personal preference. I dried the eggs off before encasing in the corned beef and had a slight problem with it adhering to the egg after deep frying. I think that a tablespoon or 2 might help as a binder to the hash. Looking forward to making them for our hungry grandsons. I also made my own Bearnaise sauce rather than the mustard sauce. Thank you Nicole!
