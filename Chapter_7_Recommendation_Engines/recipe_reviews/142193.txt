fantastic romantic meal, and also for entertaining. The sauce is wonderful and goes well with the chicken, and roast picallo tomatoes and baby peppers go wondrfully on the side with this dish. I will be making this one again wonderful flaversome food, one for the lovers of good tasty meals. Could not fault this one you could not get better in any restaurant

This turned out fabulous.  Easy and tasty. I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts (I personally think they are more flavorful and cheaper too!) and I used 1/2 white wine 1/2 water.  I also used fresh brussel sprouts quartered, about 2.5 cups. Like previous user, I also used just a half teaspoon sugar, just enough to cut the tartness of lemons. Really a tasty dish and interesting use of brussel sprouts!

It was a nice change to dinner but if I do make it again I will leave out the lemon juice since it had an overwhelming taste.

This is a delicious and versatile recipe.  Like others, I cut back the sugar and used fresh Brussels sprouts.  I par boil the sprouts, but I'm not sure it's necessary.  I've used this recipe for chicken and salmon.  For the salmon I omitted the beans and added artichoke hearts.  I also used Panko bread  crumbs and tossed in a handful of Gouda cheese along with the Parmesan for both the chicken and the salmon.  I plan to try this with some other cheeses such as Gruyere.

I'm definitely cutting back on the sugar to maybe a pinch or two. But other than that, this recipe is awesome! Thanks!

We love brussel sprouts, so I was excited to try this recipe.  I made as-written (always always always the first time); While the chicken was quite good, we found the sauce to be quite bland.  I had to tweak it allot at the end to give it a little flavor, so I'm only rating it 3 stars.  Adding fresh saute'd onion and allot of garlic salt to the sauce made it into a nice dinner -- but it's not a keeper for us.

My boyfriend LOVED this. It is unlike anything we've tasted, and the flavors just melded perfectly. I used half the butter and just used more olive oil in the beginning, and a dash of garlic salt at the end. Seriously delicious.

Made this according to the recipe adding only a little wine. My husband loved it and I thought it was great. I will make this again.

Some of the reviews of this dish sort of baffle me. It's called breaded chicken LIMONE. To me, that is a sign that the lemon flavor will be prominent. In fact, I wanted an even more prominent flavor so I upped the lemon juice slightly and cut all but a small pinch of the sugar (as other reviewers suggested). With those very minor tweaks, I thought this was a great way to use up half a bag of frozen brussels sprouts that has been lingering in my freezer for ages. My husband can be skeptical of dishes where veggies are prominent, especially when the veggies are brussels sprouts, but even he liked this. And the two-year-old at least tasted the sauce (and liked the breaded chicken). I'd definitely make this again, it's a good winter dish.

Delicious!  My husband (who is a bit of a food snob) said "excellent!"  It made Brussels sprouts good!  I loved the touch of cayenne pepper. I did do some things differently after reading the reviews. I only used about 3/4 tbsp lemon juice (what I squeezed from one very small lemon) and 1 cube of sugar. Fresh sprouts too. Didn't flatten chicken. Used almost 3/4 cups of Chardonnay that I had leftover (replacing most of the water). Didn't have Parmesan so I used cheddar. Added a little (like 1 tsp) cream cheese just for kicks. This recipe took a lot of prepping (for me) but was worth it for a yummy dinner.  I learned something very valuable with the dipping of the chicken in flour first, too- it makes the egg stick instead of sliding off (like Ive experienced with other recipes).  Lastly- I had to sub rice flour and FYI it worked :)

I really liked the amount of garlic in the sauce but I used chicken broth to thin it further instead of water.  The addition of mushrooms and onions would be great, I think.
