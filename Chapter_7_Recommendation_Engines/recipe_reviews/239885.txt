I wanted to do something different than the usual "chicken salad treatment" for my leftover turkey this year and found this recipe. Smoked paprika is one of my favorite spices so I don't know why it has never occurred to me to use it in salad like this! I did leave out the hard-boiled eggs only because, well, I felt like I spent all of this week (leading to Thanksgiving) in the kitchen and I did not want to boil eggs LOL. Other than that, I followed this exactly and it was delicious! Another reviewer warned, "don't change" the smoked paprika, and she was right. Substituting regular paprika will not ruin it - I'm sure it would still be tasty - but you will be missing out. The smokiness takes it to another level. We already finished the first batch so I'll have to make more tomorrow. Yum!!

We served this tonight mixed in with cooked (and cold) elbow pasta noodles. It was delicious and very easy to make. The only substitution I had to make was using plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream because that's what I had on hand. It was very good and we will be enjoying this again tomorrow! :) Thanks for the nice recipe!

The smoked paprika is one of the most important ingredients! If you change anything, don't change that, cause it makes it! :)
