Simple and fun to make. We added some chopped up green peppers and omitted the extra guacomole and sour cream. I made this with a group of kids and they ate it all up!

I left out the olive oil since I used prepared salsa, which made chips soggy so I will only be using salsa for dipping or topping after baking chips! I modified this by adding orange bell pepper and using a shredded mexican cheese blend, green onions and only a few tablespoons of parsley. Thanks for a simple yet great tasting meatless nacho recipe!

These were really good. However, I found the suggestion of the one reviewer to add green onions, on top after they were done, to be needed. I used baked tortilla chips and reduced fat cheese and it worked fine. I had all of the ingredients for the pico de gallo except lime, but subbed lemon juice. To save time, I just followed the layering technique and microwaved them for 2 minutes. 1/2 recipe fit on a large dinner plate and served 2 well. TY

Excellent!  The lime juice makes the difference!  Because of the use of lime, I substituted Cilantro for Parsley and Canola oil for Olive oil (too heavy).  I also added sliced olives.  Tested this at dinner party last night - it was a big hit with diners!

Simple and tasty. I didn't do the teaspoonfuls of salsa thingy... Just sort of layered the ingredients. Meant to add green onions but forgot. Think that will be a good addition.

I have tried this twice now, and both times the chips came out of over SOGGY. They don't stay crisp with the topping on. I will go back to just baking with cheese on top, and adding topping later like I used to do.

Fun meal! Very great Nachos for people that do not like spicy food (My Wife). I swapped out the red onion for green. Really cheap and easy to make.

I made this on the camp stove, and barely followed the directions.  It stilled turned out great.
