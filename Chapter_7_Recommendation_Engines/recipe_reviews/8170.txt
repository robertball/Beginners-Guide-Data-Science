What a wonderful cake.  I did make a few changes to the recipe.  I used 1/2c brown sugar and 1c white sugar to cut down on the sweetness, and to give the spices more of a base to blend with.  I also used cake flour instead of all-purpose.  The cake flour lightens up the cake while still keeping it very moist.  Use 1 cup + 2 tbl cake flour to 1 cup all purpose.  I also add 2 teaspoons of apple liqueur along with the vanilla to give the apple flavor of the cake more of a boost.  This is by far the best apple spice cake I have come across in a long time.  Thanks!!

This is very tasty and presents well baked in a tube pan. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was too oily and a bit too heavy in the nutmeg department. If you love spicey, this is the cake for you. The taste is wonderful, but I will make again using less oil and a little more cinnamon. I used Granny Smith apples which I shredded in my food processor. I believe shredded apples lend more of the apple flavor than coarsely chopped. Thanks for a great recipe, Kristin.

I made this cake last night, following the instructions exactly.  My hubby couldn't wait to try it.  I asked him three times how he liked it.....his mouth was too full to answer as he couldn't stop eating it!  I'm confused as to why some said it was 'oily' unless they are referring to the amount of butter.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

This has to be hands-down the best apple cake I have had. I served it at a family dinner and everyone took some home. I followed the advice of other reviewers and decreased the sugar to 1 cup - it was perfectly sweet enough. Also, I only used 1/2 cup of butter and substituted 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce. It was moist, spicy and delicious. Thank you - this one's a keeper!

I needed to make a cake for my grandpa's birthday, and he happens to love spice cake so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. Instead of baking this in a tube pan, I baked it in a 9x13 pan for about 40 minutes. Instead of chopping the apples I grated them (leaving the skin on) to help the cake keep it's shape and not fall apart, and then frosted with a maple cream cheese frosting. The result was a super tasty, dense cake that was snapped up by everyone who was around.

My whole family loved this cake and it was gone in one day!  I upped the apples and used 4 medium sized and made a crumbled topping with flour, butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar- It was fantastic!  I also used a bunt pan instead- super moist!

Made this into loaves for our annual bake sale, they turned out beautifully. The cake is delicious and the crust the best part. I will be making this again, this is a keeper. I think the next batch I will add a few chopped nuts to. Mmmmmmmmm good... great recipe.

It was AMAZING! Marvellous, godlike, absolutely delicious apple cake! I took everybody's advice and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of white, but kept the same amount of butter as it's said in the recipe. Then I didn't add either nutmeg or allspice to the batter. Used only some cinnamon and a little bit cloves. I must say that I actually don't fancy too much cakes with apples and raisins too much but this one came out so tasty and with such a wonderful smell that I couldn't help eating a piece ;-) Definitely will make this heavenly cake again! (I cooked half of the original yield. That was a huge mistake!! I should have better doubled the recipe =))

I wanted to make an apple cake for breakfast in the morning, and stumbled upon this recipe.  I can't believe how good it is!  I had to make some minor alterations as per our family's taste buds, but no big deal, it still came out wonderful!  I only used 1 cup of white sugar, that's it, and for us, it was still more than sweet enough.  Next time, I'll use 1/2 cup white + 1/2 brown, and see the difference.  Also, I used 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, a pinch of cloves (and I do mean pinch), and approx 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  Again, for us, this was perfect!  I had spartan apples on hand, and I peeled and finely chopped about 4 of them, and they were delicious in the cake.  I used a 9x13 pan, generously greased, and baked it for exactly 40 min at 350.  Thank you Kristin for a great recipe!

I read the reviews and made the following changes: 1/2 cup each of white and dark brown sugar, and 1 cup of apple sauce.  I creamed 1/2 cup butter with the two sugars first, then mixed in the apple sauce, following with the eggs and vanilla.  I used 3 medium granny smith apples and was careful to chop them up quite small; about 1/4 inch across.  I folded the uncooked apples into the batter after I had mixed the wet and dry ingredients together.  The only spice I doubled was the cinnamon, but I think I'll double the allspice next time, too.  I thought the cake could have stood a little more.  Baked for 1 hour exactly in one of those newfangled soft silicone bundt pans, and it came out gorgeous.  The apples were suspended nicely throughout the batter; cooked, but still with enough tang and texture to keep it interesting.  We love sweets in this household, but not too sweet, so the reduced sugar was perfect, especially if you plan on adding a glaze or having ice cream with it.  The cake also came out with a nice crust, despite the reduced sugar.  Go figure!

This cake was perfect! It was moist, smelled wonderful, looked wonderful, and tasted amazing! I omitted the raisins and grated the apples, which I think helped to make the cake more moist. Definitely intend to make again, and soon!

Great, moist cake.  Not as appley as I thought it would be, but still delicious.  (I shredded 3 granny smith apples).  I did as one previous cook recommended and soak the raisins in rum, which added a nice bite.   Definitely will make again!!!

I liked this cake but I, personally, like a bit more spice in my spice cake. I used red delicious apples...never again! Just lacked that apple flavor I was looking for. The recipes calls for 3 apples and a novice baker would grab any type of apple. I used the red delicious because that is what had and they needed to be used up. I also used a 9 x 13 inch pan for 40 mins.

Terrific base cake for fruity variations! I substituted 1.3 C. agave nectar for the sugar, used half the butter, 1.5 t. baking soda and 2 T. lemon juice. I baked it at 325 for 1 hour- it was sweet and fragrant, and I cut my guilt in half but reducing the gycemic index a bit.

I loved this cake. The only changes I made were to grate half of the apples, chop the other half, sub currants soaked in cognac for the raisins, and used 1 tablespoon cognac instead of water. This cake is even better as it ages. Love it!

I made this for Christmas for my family and we all loved it.  2 things I did differently: (1) I soaked raisins in 1T Rum instead of just in water. (2) I cored and sliced the apples thinly and let it sit in the lemon juice from 1 whole lemon, 2 teaspoonfuls of sugar, dash of salt and some powdered cinnamon in a ziploc bag while I was working on the rest of the ingredients.  The cake came out really good. Thank you, Krissyp!

Very tasty and moist!  My husband cooked this recipe for me today!  I was eating it and give him rave reviews until he told me he put raisins in it!  I quickly stated "I don't like raisins!"  I didn't even taste them! This was delicious and I wouldn't change anything about it-even the raisins!

This is a very yummy spicey cake, I basically followed  the recipe, except I omitted the raisins since  I did not have any. Cake was flavorful and moist without them. I also made in a bundt cake pan and sprinkled Paula Deen's Cinnamon Sugar (grinder) on the top of the batter before baking to add a layer of crunch to the cake. Also, used 1/2 butter, 1/2 margarine and use 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup organic granulated sugar that has more molasses to it but not quite brown sugar. i also omitted dusting cake with sugar.

These were to die for straight out of the oven! I did take suggestions and replaced half butter for applesauce, doubled the cinnamon, and used 1. white sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar. Made 2 dozen muffins.

This cake turned out amazing! It was so moist and delicious and really easy to make, the hardest part was peeling ans slicing the apples. I skipped the raisins and confectioners sugar and baked it in a regular rectangular pan and it still came out so delicious. This is my go to cake recipe now.

I had a lot of apples to peel, core, etc. and had already made 4 apple pies... looked for an apple spice cake and gave this a try.  My family devowered this in 1/2 day (evening dessert and morning breakfast).  It's a very moist cake. My only problem is that I didn't grease my cake pan very well and some of it stuck to the sides of the pan. My next batch I'll butter AND flour the pan. Making another batch today!  Give this a try and you won't be sorry!

Excellent recipe. Big hit at work.  Made a few small changes: added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and cut butter to 2/3 cup; replaced 1 cup of the sugar with 3/4 cup brown sugar; cut allspice to 1/2 tsp and added a pinch of cloves; grated the apples in the food pro; made in 9x13 pan and baked 40 minutes; iced with maple cream cheese frosting. Great!

I turned these into muffins and just felt they lacked flavor.  My husband likes them, so they weren't wasted, but none of the rest of us cared to eat any more. :-(

I LOVE THIS CAKE!  I love the original recipe or to make it a little healthier I do just 1 cup of sugar and trade apple sauce for the butter.  I even have added blueberries to the mix.  YUM!!!!

Delicious.  I only made a few minor changes.
1. I coursely shredded the apples instead of chunks as larger peices can cause a cake to fall apart. 
2. I used a 13X9 inch pan.  Very good cake.  I also topped it with cake icing but that made it too sweet for me.  Wouldn't do that again.

Wow! This was a great spice cake. I made it for a potluck with my friends and the 6 of us finished it in one night! I doubled all the spices and added about a tsp of cloves (I like a lot of spice!) This is easily made vegan too, I used egg replacer for the eggs, and for the butter I used 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 applesauce, these changes probably cut out about 30 grams of fat or more! I used 2 russets, a mac and a christmas, choppped up small and left out the raisins. Made it the day before and I think this cake really gets better the next day. Didn't need icing, it was soooo moist!!! I did put the c. sugar on top to look like snow...Absolutely great!

This is a delicious apple cake! I've been looking quite a while for a "keeper"- this is IT! Instead of raisins, I used dried cranberries. Great!

This cake is wonderful. I made it twice, first i soaked my apples in rum then I substituted walnuts for the raisins. I made to first one sugar free using xylitol and the second one I made gluten free using a rice flour mixture. This is a really good cake.

Made as per original recipe, except used dried cranberries in place of the raisins. Between the guys at hubby's auto shop and the lifeguards down at the pool, it was gone in a flash!

Delicious cake!! I didn't have any allspice, so I used ground clover instead (only two dashes since it has such an overpowering flavor). I even made a sauce to drizzle on top thinking the cake might not be moist, but it turned out I didn't need it and wasted the sauce. Only problem was getting the cake out of the pan. Next time I will pour a little bit of plain batter in first and then add all the fruit since it was the raisins that kept the cake from coming out.

This was excellent! I made it for my Dads birthday and topped with Allspice frosting.  For this recipe, I added 1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 cup butter shortening, cut flour to include 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  Because of my Dad's need to reduce sugar, I used Splenda 1/2 & 1/2 baking sugar. Cake was moist and nutty even with the addition of whole wheat. I think next time I make this, I will also add about 1/2 cup of apple sauce to make it a little more moist, the whole wheat makes it probably a little dryer than it should be.  Excellent cake, and I will definatley make again!

This cake is delicious!  I made a few adjustments which worked very well.  I substituted a 1/2 cup of brown sugar for white as suggested, and I also substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for butter to reduce the fat a little.  I didn't have any raisins so I used walnuts instead which added a nice crunch. I would suggest cutting the nutmeg as it is a very dominant flavor in the cake.  I baked it for 50 minutes in a bundt pan and it turned out perfect.  It's especially delicious with a little cream cheese spread on it!

My Husband made this cake.  We all had a piece-it was great!  His Mother came over after dinner-she didn't want any dinner but ate the rest of the cake!  There was 1/2 of a cake there!  Husband knows where his bread is buttered!  He made me another cake!

This is a simple cake to make. It's not too sweet, and since there's no frosting it's not a production to bake. The second time I made it,  I added broken walnuts - very good. I emailed the recipe to a friend with several apple trees and she's as enthusiastic as I am.

This is a very nice and tasty cake! Just as suggested I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 3/4 cup of regular sugar. I also used 1/2 cup of margarine and 1/2 cup of apple sauce to cut on fat. I omitted the raisins and was conservative on the spices because my picky kids don't like them.

Excellent cake recipe!  I followed the suggestion of substituting 1/2 cup brown sugar, and omitted the raisins (kids hate 'em--too bad, Im sure they would have been great)  I also grated the apples, since I wanted a more uniform appearance and baked in a 9X13 pan.  Frost with cinnamon cream cheese frosting--MMMMM!

LOVED this one! only change was to just use 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg for the seasonings and I also shredded the apples instead of leaving them in chunks--then topped with a whipped cream cheese frosting--everyone absolutely loved it

I made this for a coworkers birthday and everybody seemed to like it. Modified sugar to 1/2 cup brown, 1 1/2 white and butter to 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup applesauce, increased cinnamon & allspice to 2 teaspoons each. Baked in 9 x 13 pan for 40-45 minutes. Cooled and frosted with cream cheese frosting. Yummy, smelled delicious, very moist. Chop your apples very finely, or use a food processor. Thanks for a great recipe. Would make excellent muffins as the edges are the best!

I may be rating this too soon (as I'm writing, the cake is in the oven) but it looks good, smells great, and hopefully will taste amazing! 
I did a couple things different.  First, I left the skins on the apples.  I know, not a HUGE change, but I like the look of it, and I was lazy! Second, I added about 3/4 c. chopped pecans.  Third, I upped the amount of cinnamon called for, mainly because my boyfriend and I love cinnamon.  Also, I didn't have any allspice so I added a little more nutmeg and cinnamon for that purpose as well. Fourth, I didn't have a tube/bundt pan so I put it in a 13X9 pan for about 45 min.

I really wanted to like this recipe.  It looked so good.  I took the advice of most reviewers and reduced the amount of sugar.  The cake didn't rise the way my other bundt cakes always do and I found it to be dry.  All that fruit and this cake was still on the crumbly side.  I consider myself to be an experienced baker and I was not impressed by this recipe.

This buttery apple cake is certainly a new Fall favorite in our home! I have been searching for a spicy apple cake that does not depend on oil in the batter and this moist flavorful cake is the one. I did follow advice and grated 1/2 of the apples, chopping the rest, along with doubling the spices called for. I used a 13x9 inch pan but will use a bundt pan from now on. I added cream cheese frosting but this cake does not need any more, it stands well alone. The first crisp day in September signals a return to baking in our home and this delicious cake did not disappoint.

I substituted dried cranberries for  the raisins, and used 1 c of whole wheat flour plus 1 c of all purpose flour.  I used three Empire apples.  I made 24 muffins, cooking for about 30 minutes at 350.  Though the muffins weren't very pretty they tasted very good.  Next time, I will add another teaspoon of cinnamon.

I was browsing online to find a treat to bring into work.  With the rave reviews this recipe has received, how could I not try it?  It's everything the reviews say it is!  It went over very well... and quickly.  The only changes I made were adding 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  I didn't have raisins so I chopped up some Citrus Essence Prunes and added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  The Citrus Essence (orange flavored) Prunes added a really nice touch to the cake and people love the tang they gave.  I used mounded teaspoons of spices, but agree that it could use a little more.  I also shredded my apples (Cortland Apples) on the largest setting instead of chopping them.  I'm not a baked apple person but I enjoyed the cake a lot myself!  I had to join All Recipes just so I could rate and review this recipe!

The best apple spice cake I have ever tried and it is very easy to make. I didn't have any allspice and I increased the amount of nutmeg, cinamon, raisens and apples by 1/3 and it was still very good. If you like spicy cake, this is it...mmmmm...yummi

This is a very moist and flavorful cake! I added a little more of the spices, and cut down on the sugar and oil, but left out the raisins. I was very pleased with it this way, and will use it again!
Great all around- thanks for offering it:)

Delicious.  Next time I may cut back on the apples by about 1/2 an apple.  I love apples, but think that less may be more in this cake.  This is a great cake to make a day ahead of time.  Very moist.  Yum!

I made this cake as muffins and it came out superb.  I was in a rush and it took no time at all.  They didn't look very pretty as muffins, but the powdered sugar on top took care of that.  I added a touch of ginger.  Excellent.  Highly recommended.

This cake is wonderful.  I made it in a angel food cake pan and the only changes I made was that I used 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and 1 & 1/2 cup white sugar. I also made a cream cheese frosting and added around a TB of maple syrup to it.  I also took another person's suggestion and used my food processor to shred the apples.  It doesn't really shred but it cuts them up really fine, then I put them in a colander and kind of used my hands to squeeze out a lot of the excess juice.  This tip really saves a lot of time and mess.  This cake is really moist and delicious.  I will certainly make it again and I highly recommend this recipe.

Excellent!  I chopped the apples small and used another reviewer's suggestion of substituting half of the butter with applesauce.  I made mini bundt cakes (baked for 15 minutes) instead of one large one. Will definitely make again :-)

I made this recipe this past weekend and loved it!!  Much easier to make than I suspected it would be, and very, very tasty!  I expected it to be a bit dry, but it was very moist and has maintained well in the fridge since I made it.  The powdered sugar on top does add something to the overall flavor, but could be left off if you wanted to lower the sugar content.  I suspected that the powdered sugar would get "gummy" after some time in the fridge, so I choose to sprinkle each individual serving as I go.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I made this cake for a get together and everyone thought it was delicious.  I did add a 1/2 tsp of ground ginger and 1/2 tsp. ground cloves to the recipe to make it more spicy.  I also grated the apple. And, instead of dusting with confectioner's sugar, I made a maple glaze. The only thing I might change next time is to use two apples instead of three, as I thought it was a little bit too moist.  Otherwise, it is great.

Great base recipe.  I used 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c applesauce to cut down on the fat and 1 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar just to try something different.  I doubled the cinnamon and added a teaspoon of ground clove and I didn't have any ginger so I omitted it.  I also used walnuts instead of raisins because we don't like them and I used my food chopper to finely chop the apples because I didn't want big chunks (you couldn't see the apples but you could taste the flavor).  I also added 2 teaspoons of baking powder because I wanted it to be fluffy.  I baked in a 9 x 13 pan for 40 minutes and it came out great.  It was very moist and delicious and this was my first time making a spice cake (my fiance asked for it for father's day).  I topped with a vanilla cream cheese frosting.  Another cake recipe to add to my collection!

I recently made this cake for a dear friend's birthday.  It was fantastic!  I did chop the apples so they were small (like a grated carrot).  I also used just over a tablespoon of cinnamon and 2 teaspoons of nutmeg and I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  I sprinkled the cake with powdered sugar.  It was beautiful and yummy!

I found this cake heavy on the eggs, and little on the spice and apple. Perhaps if you lessen the eggs, add more spice, and do the apples in a food processor first, to get more apple favor into it. All in all, sorely disappointed.

Next time I make this particular cake, I'll use two cake tins and make it as a layer cake, as my Bundt form was a little small for it.  I added a caramel/cinnamon glaze over a fresh fruit centre.  A very pretty cake, and extremely moist texture.

yummy! I used 1 red delicious apple and 2 granny smith. I left the skin on the red delicious to give it a little more texture and since it's good for you! I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce but did not omit the other cinnamon. I used my food processer to chop the apples since I'm terrible at that. I made mini muffins with these so I reduce the baking time.

Wonderful! I followed another reviewer's suggestions and used 1/2 cup of brown suger and 1 cup of white sugar as well as using cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. I used 3 granny smith and 1 golden delicous apple (just happened to be what I had on hand). Turned out perfect - not too heavy, just moist and delicious. Even my husband who is not a dessert person enjoyed this.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but my cake turned out really hard. The only thing that I would recommend other people to do is to lessen the amount of sugar needed. It was extremely sweet, and I had only used 13/4 cups of the sugar suggested.

Excellent.  I followed the directions exactly.  Used the entire 2 cups sugar and possibly that is what made the crust so good and crunchy.  In fact, my husband loved the edges so much that he wants me to make as muffins next time.  Absolutely no need for icing or powdered sugar; it is perfect!

Since all the reviews I read were positive, I thought I would try this recipe.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but this cake did not turn out as expected.  First of all, I was taught to invert the cake when you bake in a tube pan for  cooling.  There were no directions on whether to invert or not.  I did and the cake fell out of the pan in many pieces.  I had tested the cake for doness as per instructions.  The tester came out clean after baking for 1 hour.  Since the top of the cake looked a little moist still, I baked it an additional 5 minutes.  I have to admit, the cake was extrememly moist, almost to the point of being mushy.  Can't say I will be trying this recipe again.  Thanks anyway......

I just baked this today!! Turned out awesome!! My dad couldn't stop himself from getting a bite before it cooled down.  I took the advice to only add one cup of sugar and that was sweet enough for me too!! i used applesauce instead of butter to make it less fattening, and it still turned out fine!! i also added low fat sour cream to make it more like a coffee cake and walnuts.  whole fam loves it!! my mom wants to give half of it to te pastor.. thanks for sharing a delicious recipe!!

yumm! I'm eating it right now and it's delicious.. tastes even better the day after it's made. A few changes I made:  I added more cinnamon because I didn't have nutmeg nor all spice, I also reduced the sugar to one cup only.. but it's still really sweet. So I think one cup of sugar is plenty in this recipe :)

I, too, made some changes but this is a terrific cake.  I soaked my raisins in Courvoisier and then used the soaking liquid to mix with the baking soda.  Instead of vanilla, I used a tablespoon more of Courvoisier and also a little bit of Vanilla Bean Paste, which I happen to keep around.  I used Macoun apples, which look a lot like small MacIntoshes, and I used 4 of them. Macouns are terrific apples.  I have tried numerous apple cakes and most were so-so.  This is outstanding.  Next time I will try cutting the sugar by 1/2c.  Plain whipped cream is really nice as an accompaniment.

Very tasty even after a few substitutions and I left out the raisins. The cake was indeed moist, spicy and sweet as promised. First, I used one cup of whole wheat flour in place of one cup of all-purpose flour. Then I used one cup of egg substitute in place of the four eggs and finally I used one-half cup of "Smart Balance" with one-half cup of butter to replace the one cup of butter. The cake was sweet enough so I left off the confectioner's sugar too.
 Because I don't have a tube pan I used two round cake pans (9 inches) and made two cakes that turned out about one and one-half inches high and took about 30 minutes to cook completely. Jon and I finished off one cake in mere minutes!
Yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

I added 1/2 teaspoon more spices and also added a crispy crust to it with some brown sugar, butter and flour mixture. It was dense, full of flavor and delicious! I also reduced cooking time by 10 mins to keep it moist.

I really liked this sweet bread.  It has a crispy texture outside and is VERY moist inside.  It had just enough spice to make you want another slice.  A nice holiday gift or bake sale item!

I doubled the amount of apples (three green and three red)substituted cranberries for raisins.  I used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I am sure the basic recipe is great without my changes but I just couldn't resist my urge to experiment.  By the way, I am in the process of baking this cake again today.

Very good. Not oily at all. Nuts would be good. I almost shredded a carrot the second time, just to experiment.  But seriously, it was excellent just as it was.  Will reduce sugar a bit, maybe the butter as suggested, just to feel less guilty when I eat it all up!

This recipe makes a lovely moist bundt cake. I shredded my apples like a review suggested and it compliments the texture. The only reason I am not giving this recipe a full 5 stars is that I found the spices to be a bit underwhelming. This cake has a very mild flavor.

The flavors are terrific. I agree with previous reviewers that there is a bit too much butter.  I would by a quarter or half.  But the taste was yummy and everyone had seconds.

This smells so good coming out of the oven! I made a few little modifications, less sugar (1c.white, 1/2c. brown), I grated 2 of the apples and finely chopped the other. I also used a little less butter, mainly because it comes in 100 gram packs and I didn't want to open up 3 of them. (1c. equals about 225grams) Went a little crazy with the powered sugar. Made for my awesome knitting group!

So amazing!!!! I did double the spices because we like a real punch of flavor and I'm so glad I did! This cake stays moist, I'd actually say it's better the second day. I added a glaze, just using powdered sugar, water, and a few drops of orange oil. Poured it on the top and let it run down the sides. It was wonderful.

Isn't funny how some people say "too spicy" and some say "not spicy enough"?  I'm in the not spicy enough camp.  I doubled the cinnamon but was afraid to do too much different on a first try.  This was an extremely yummy cake, very moist.  I added toasted walnuts because I think everything's better with nuts!  (don't understand the "greasy" comment by one reviewer.)  I used canned cream cheese icing.  Next time I will double all the spices and perhaps make a caramel icing from scratch.  Thanks for a really nice recipe!

This is a simple, quick and easy to make. The outside crust is great. I used coconut oil instead of butter and only about 3/4 cup, I do this only because I try to use less butter in everything. I also added chopped pecans, again because I use nuts whenever possible. I will make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was outstanding!  Truly a delightful find.  I had apples that needed to be used, and this was the answer.  Our family is gluten-free, so I used gluten-free all-purpose flour and added 1 tsp. xanthan gum.  Used 4 apples shredded in the food processor.  Perfect in every way!  Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

So it taste amazing but for my personal taste i would add less nutmeg and this time i added dried cherries raisins apple slices raspberry blackberry and strawberry and I only had 3/4 cup of butter and no vegetable oil and i added about 3 tablespoons of  olive oil and instead of mixing it i blended it. Last change was i did it in a square pan. it taste amazing . I love this recipe.

I don't make cakes very often but wanted to gift a neighbour who is ill.   This cake is moist and flavourful and makes a great gift.  It lifted my neighbour's spirits just with the aroma of it when I walked in with it straight from the oven.   This recipe is a definite keeper!

This cake is awesome! I made it for my moms birthday for a change( we are a chocolate family!) and everyone loved it. My father was skeptical, but he really liked it and came back for more. I omitted the raisins since my fam doesn't like them. Thank you so much for a great recipe!:)

I made this cake a while ago and am itching to make it again.  It was so flavorful and held well. I used 1 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead and it turned out great!

Wonderful. Even better if you take some powdered sugar, apple cider, and cinnamon and make a glaze to pour over it.

Outstanding!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the raisins.  The wonderful aroma while it was baking was almost too much to handle - it smelled oh-so-good.  The cake is moist and it tastes wonderful.  I have an apple tree and need to use up lots of apples.

I normally don't like to review a recipe until I can complete it almost exactly but I was super eager to make this cake and I had just ran out of butter and oil so I subbed an entire cup of applesauce instead. I also accidentally added an extra apple and used rum soaked raisins instead of water soaked. I also used a reviewer's advice and subbed half the sugar for brown sugar.  My end result? A SUPER moist cake that is more like a bread pudding than an actual cake but the taste is out of this world! I noticed giant apple chunks in some of the photos but I would advise against that, I say pieces slightly bigger than peas will yield the best results.

This was fantastic!! I used a glass cake pan and it was done after 40 - 45 minutes. I didn't have allspice so I used 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp cloves instead. I used my food processor to shred the apples. This cake turned out so moist and delicious.

This cake was awesome!  I followed the recipe to a "T" except for shredding the apples instead of chopping them and it was just fabulous.  I didn't find it to be too oily or too sweet.  The spices were just right.  Even my hubby loved it and he isn't a big dessert eater!  Next time I make it I may add nuts and maybe soak the raisins in rum instead of water..  :-)  yum!  Thank you!

This cake has a fairly dense, but tender texture. It is VERY fragrant -- perfect for people who love spice cake (like me!) I decreased and changed the sugar to 1 c. white and 1/2 c. light brown. Could decrease a bit more, or use tart apples (I didn't.) I finished with a light vanilla glaze, and served with a dollop of unsweetened apple sauce which helped balance all the sweet. Will definitely make again.

Wow what a cake!! I took the advice and used 1/2c brown and 1c white sugar.  I didn't have allspice so I used some pumpkin spice.  I'm not sure why some think it's too spicy, I think it is very tasty!!  I did chop my apples, but made them kinda small.  Instead of vanilla in the cake, I used almond extract to give it a little nutty flavor, worked perfect.  Great cake, great flavor...will definetly make this again! Check out my picture!

This turned out to be the best cake i've ever made!  I am making it again right now, the second time in a week!  Took it to a party and everybody went crazy over it.  I made a cream cheese frosting that I drizzled over the top because I wanted it to be more of a dessert but will do powdered sugar this time I think.  This ones going into permanent rotation!

Made this recipe today, was looking for something different. I followed recipe for the most part, I did reduce sugar to cup and half, but everyones sweet tooth is different and I did half/half brown/white sugar, also used whole wheat/all purpose half and half. Shredded the apples, and didn't use butter at all, used apple sauce only...was hoping it wouldn't be too much apple...It was fine, husband and step-daughter loved it. I added walnuts, but that's my personal liking..would use this again..

My favorite recipe so far at allrecipes! Some changes I've made: puree raisins w/1/4c.spiced applesause, added 1/4 C. wheat germ and 1/4 C. pecan meal after subtracting 1/4 C. flour to balance it out.Also-for those reviewers who said it fell apart, refrigerate cake for 36 hrs. to allow the spices to mellow and the texture to hold together better and it is magnificent! Also you can add 1/3 C. crushed pineapple to round out the spicey edge.Experiment with the recipe, it is forgiving and fun!

Absolutely delicious.  I wish I had made it in a Bundt pan, but I thought tube pan meant Angel Food pan.  So it wasn't so pretty, but the taste was fantastic.  I topped with a thin butter frosting and cut way back on the nutmeg since I don't like the flavor of it.  Highly recommend.

My daughter went apple picking and I'm not crazy about apple pie so I was looking for something different.  This was an awesome recipe.  I especially loved the mix of spices and that you could taste them all.  It was more like a spice cake with apples than an apple cake with spices.  I did lighten it up as a previous reviewer did and used 1/2 & 1/2 on the AP/WW flours and applesauce/butter.  I made 2 loafs instead of a bundt and added walnuts to one of the loafs.  It was definitely better with the walnuts.  Next time I want to use egg substitute instead of 4 whole eggs as I'm watching my cholesterol.

It's far too much nutmeg, it's all you can taste. Otherwise, the cake came out well, it has a very nice texture. I substituted some brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the white, and I think it would be better as written, with all white sugar. I would say halve the nutmeg, and if you want it spicier, add some more cinnamon.

I made this with fresh pears (my guest was allergic to apples) and used both golden and dark raisins.  I made muffins and sprinkled chopped walnuts and sugar on top prior to baking.  I laso used 1/2c packed brown sugar and 1/2c white plus cut down on the margarine.  Came out wonderfully, she asked for my recipe after one bite. Thanks!

This cake was excellent- moist & delicious. I did make a few minor adjustments- I cut back on the sugar- used 1 cup of raw sugar cane & 1/2 cup brown sugar, I did not put confectioner's sugar on top, & I used oat flour instead of all purpose white flour.  I will be making it again for our gathering on Thanksgiving. A+++++

I made this for my family for Christmas Eve.  After reading other reviews, I decided to double the spices and replace 1/2 of the butter with apple sauce.  Very good and will make this again.  One thing I was a little confused about though - many reviewers referred to the "crust" - huh? Mine didn't come out with any notable "crust" on it - I did use a cooking spray instead of buttering the pan - am wondering if that made a difference.  I was also tempted to add nuts to the recipe, but did not do so this time as my nephew is allergic. Will definitely make this again and try it with either walnuts or pecans too.

Made this cake several times for my friends, they loved it.  I used Fuji apples and freshly grated nutmeg, produced a very moist, fragrant, delicious cake.  My friends kept coming back for more.

I liked the recipe, but I am still looking for a good frosting to put on it.  It could use a tab pit more cinamon and all-spice.

Very delicious!  I made it for a Mother's Day present and my mom (and dad) thought it was excellent! I added only 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of the 2; it was plenty sweet enough!  Next time I would cut the butter in half and use half applesauce because the cake was rather greasy.

It was quite good - my friends and I ate it up very quickly - a little whipped cream made it wonderful.  I grated half the apples and diced the rest.  Very yummy.

The best apple spice cake I've ever had, and I love strong spice flavors. I baked this in a loaf pan and it overflowed the sides a bit but still was scrumptious. It disappeared first of all desserts at a Thanksgiving buffét.

If you're looking for a quick and easy fall recipe this is the one.  Great for breakfast and a dessert by heating likely in the microwave and putting a scoop of French Vanilla Ice Cream sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.

I had a Spice box cake mix.  The box called for 1/3 of a cup of vegetable oil, 3 eggs and a cup of water. Because I was adding a can of apple pie filling to the mix, I did not add as the box stated. Instead I reduced the water to 1/2 cup, reduced the eggs to only 2 and I kept the vegetable oil at 1/3 of a cup. I also added the allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon (even though it was a spice box mix).  It turned out moist and delicious.  I had to cook it about 10 minutes longer and I thought it was "heavy" but it was done and tasted delicious.

Simply fantastic.  I added fresh Black Cherries; was even better.  Made it twice.  First time, had enough batter to make half in an Instant Pot (Bundt) and the other half in the oven (spring form).  They came out almost identical: both incredibly moist and delicious.  Not too sweet, and yet did NOT require icing or even powdered sugar (optional, in other words).  HIGHLY recommended.

Just made this cake and could hardly wait for it to cool down.
I can't wait to share this with my friends. I can't say enough good things about this cake! Ummmmmmm!  Kinda sums it up.   I soaked the raisins in the water with a little Rum added. Other than that, I made this recipe exactly as written.  I'd like to give it 10 stars!

Excellent recipe as written.  The only additions I made were 1/4 cup each of coconut and chopped walnuts.  Such a moist, delicious cake!  A real hit with the family.
I also made an easy caramel sauce that knocked it out of the park: 1 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar, 1-2 T milk, dash of salt, and dash of vanilla.  Combine and cook, stirring, until smooth.  Use warm.

I will definitely make this again! It was easy and turned out beautifully. Everyone here loved it. The only thing that I might change is to add more spices.

Amazingly wonderful!!! I used three diced Granny Smith apples, 1 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup of brown, soaked the golden raisins in rum and added pecans. Baked in a bundt pan only took 50 minutes. The aroma was so inviting, I couldn't wait for it to cool. I sprinkled powdered sugar on the top. So yummy!!!!

This cake is our new favorite fall cake! I modified the recipe a little bit though... I couldn't find my "regular" measuring spoons; the ones that I had were table spoons only...! I didn't have allspice so I added, instead, 1/2tbs ground cloves and 1/2tbs of fresh grated ginger. As for the cinnamon, I grated it from a stick instead of the powder (that i don't like anyway). To be on the safe side, I also added 1/2tbs of baking powder. 
Here's how I modified it so it would be a touch fluffier:
1cup all purpose flour and 1 cup of cake flour. A little less than 1/2tbs fresh grated nutmeg (way better flavor than the already ground one) and I was out of white sugar so I only had 1/2cup of white sugar and 1 1/2cup of brown sugar. I separated the egg whites from the yolks, and added 1/2tsp cream of tartar to the whites and brought the whites to stiff peaks, set aside. Oh, also, I replace the cup of oil by a cup of homemade apple sauce. I added the fresh ginger to the mixture of apple sauce and sugar.  Then followed the recipe and the last thing that I did was to fold the whites to the batter. My cake fluffed so much, it is nice and thick and the house smell so good. Looking forward to have it tonight with our Thanksgiving dinner! Oh, I forgot, I also added 1/4cup of walnut pieces. Voilà! Thank you!!!

Love it. I’ve made this cake on more than one occasion using King Arthur gluten-free flour blend. Some gf-adapted recipes work better than others in terms of texture, which can be gritty. This is very good, probably because the cake is so moist. I bump up the spices by at least half to suit our taste.

Tried a different cake prior to this which only used clove and cinnamon and the flavor was missing.  This recipe had a great combination of spices and was very well balanced.  I used 4 different types of apples to provide some balance of sweet and sour and this cake turned out fabulous.  Moist and flavorful, not sure what else I could ask from it.  Awesome share!

It was very tasty. Following the directions as written lead to a type of bread pudding or may pass as a cobbler. I used 3 large apples, maybe I should use medium? We still enjoyed the flavors and texture, really hoping for more of a spice cake.
We absolutely will bake it again, still searching for the perfect apple raisin spice cake that excites our pallet.

It is an amazing spice cake. I will cut back on the sugar next time as others commented. I also grated the apples because I didn’t want chunks. It makes it very moist. Next time I will only grate 2 apples instead of 3. Thank goodness I poured off the extra water from the apples or it would’ve been wet instead of moist. Will definitely make it again but will use loaf pans and add nuts. Amazing cake!!

Very good recipe. I did do a few changes for health reasons. I swapped out the white sugar and white flour for brown sugar and whole wheat flour. It came out incredibly well. Fluffy and light. I would add a bit more spice the next time but every one enjoyed it and helped themselves until there was no more. You know if that happens then it is a good recipe. Thumbs up!

Delicious.  Best apple cake recipe I've used.  Took advice and used less sugar (1 1/2C) using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  Added a little more cinnamon.  Also 1/2 C butter, 1/2C applesauce.  Husband loved it.  This is a keeper.

followed others comments (less sugar, in total - also subbed some brown sugar ill of white, marinate raisins in 43 liqueur for a bit, upped the spices, cut back o butter - added in apple sauce  shredded apples in food proc.)....Also I added on a traditional cream cheese frosting. I baked in a 9 x 13 for 40 -ish minutes also. I found the cake VERY dense. in fact it is Super heavy in the pan. I refrigerated overnight and the flavor is decent but this was too dense for me. I almost wish i had used cake flour and more leavening agent... the search continues.  (the hubs said it was ok but he didn't rave)

Very moist cake that keeps well. I baked it for Christmas this year, but I didn't have raisins, so I used craisins (cranberries) instead. It turned out really well. I also added my own buttercream frosting instead of the powdered sugar sprinkle. I'll definitely make this one again! ??

Added one cup of nuts, instead of raisins. Also decreased the sugar, and used brown and white. Also added a little bit of grated ginger to the mix. Also put some of the spices on the nuts with a little flour, before I mixed them in.

I also made a sauce to fancy it up for Christmas dinner.
Used the lemon water I had the apples in so the wouldn't turn brown, a stick of butter, lemon, ginger and a little flour. Sorry I couldn't tell you the amounts, just kind of threw it in a pot and prayed and stirred! 

I enjoy reading how everyone makes this recipe their own!

My family loved this cake. We are German and Native American mixed family and apples are our favorite fruit ( we have 15 trees) I made it the first time exactly per the recipe from then on I doubled the apples because my Indian husband said it needed to be more apple-ly now the ask for it about once a week in the winter.

Made this twice now with 3/4 cup of coconut oil instead of butter, only 1 cup of sugar (1/2 white, 1/2 brown), mixed grated apples and a little ginger powder in addition to much more cinnamon and nutmeg.  It's moist and delicious. Also add a confectioners sugar/milk glaze.  Thanks for a great base recipe.

This is very moist, tasty and spicy. Easy to make and on a cold day with a cup of apple tea it hits the spot.
I may cut the nutmeg back to 1/2 tsp as one other person mentioned as the nutmeg seems strong. My wife liked it as is so may have to compromise.
Will make this again and soon!

I tried this and reduced the sugar to 1 cup and added 1/4 brown sugar. I think I could have added 1/2 cup brown sugar instead and it would still be fine. The texture is nice but it was a little dry. Definitely a coffee cake. Next time I might try substituting the butter with apple sauce . I also didn't use the raisins.

Excellent recipe. I would have given 5 stars except that I made a couple of changes.  I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 apple sauce to cut back on the oiliness; followed other users advice and substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1- 1/2 cup of white sugar. For spices I doubled the cinnamon, used only a sprinkle of nutmeg and 1 tsp of cloves. I also added some walnuts.  This was a very moist cake that sets up beautifully over night.  Could also be served directly out of the oven with some whipped cream because it is so soft.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a wonderful moist bundt cake. I diced three large organic Fuji apples along with 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown.  I doubled all of the spices and used a mix of golden and Thompson raisins. These are the only changes I made.

When the batter was ready, it was fairly chunky but it baked up fine.   It took 45 minutes to bake through.

The cake is plenty sweet enough, but even more of a treat with maple cream cheese frosting (which was kind of hard to spread on a bundt cake).

Next time, I would consider adding a little clove and maybe carrot or pineapple just to mix things up a bit.

Super great consistency and clear directions. Definitely too sweet! I think you can get away with less sugar for sure, and that's what I'd do for a future iteration.

Very moist and delicious! I tweaked it to make it GLUTEN-FREE for my crew. Instead of 2 cups of flour, I used 1 1/2 cups of brown rice flour, 1/3 cup of potato starch, 1/3 cup tapioca starch, and 1 tsp of xantham gum. I also added 1/2 tsp of baking powder. I was out of raisins, so I used dried cranberries. I used Gala apples, which were wonderful. The texture was light, not too dense or heavy as some GF cakes can be. It took about 10 mins longer to cook. I did put it in a bundt cake pan, and I was bummed it didn't turn out perfectly. It is not a pretty cake, but I can fix it with a little powdered sugar on top. Still, as far a gluten-free cakes go - it was delish!!

It tastes great, but I used a Bundt pan and couldn't get it out of the pan. It ended up breaking in half. I did spray the pan with PAM, but think maybe a different type of pan would work better. Also omitted the raisins since I didn't have any and I think it taste better without them.

I've baked this cake a couple of times now and every time, none of it gets wasted which is great. I made a few changes to the recipe, omitting a cup of white sugar and replacing it with brown sugar which I think gave it a richer flavour. I also added at least 3x the amount of spices as I knew that just one teaspoon of each of the spices was not going to be enough. Despite adding a lot more spice, the cake had a mild flavour, but it was very pleasant. Next time I think I will add a fourth apple to the recipe as I love the texture of the apples after they are baked. All round, a pleasant cake, very moist and delicious. Will continue to bake it :)

Found this to be way too oily and not much flavour.  More like a suet pudding, not what i expected at all.  The texture was too soft and doughy.  Will not make this again

I don't know, maybe I overcooked it (only had it in for 50 minutes), but I though it was kind of dry. Maybe cause I used tub non dairy margarine instead of real butter, a little harder to measure. Maybe I will try some frosting on it.

Delicious. I took the advice of some other reviewers and used double the allspice and tripled the cinnamon. My husband and I love cinnamon. We also only used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. I only had almond milk, which worked perfectly. My house smelled amazing while baking and the cake was fantastic. I coupled it with my coffee in the morning. :)

The only change I made to the original recipe was to rough grate the apples. I used gala apples.  It turned our beautiful and delicious.  The next time I make it I will try granny smith apples cut in small pieces.

I added one more apple because I thought mine were on the small side but I almost wish I hadn't. Made it take longer to bake and it was almost too miost. Next time I make it I'll up the spice amounts at least by one-half. It had good flavor just not spiced enough.

Super yummy!  The only thing I did differently was to use shredded apples instead of chopped - my family doesn't like chunks of fruit in cake!  I had a can of cream cheese frosting in the cupboard so decided to frost the cake.  OMG!!

Very yummy and moist. Mixed up quick and baked up well. Used 1/2 cup of Brown Sugar for part of the sugar. Could have increased the spices a little.

Made this cake for my family and it was eaten in one day, I added cranberries and raisins, yummy! It has a dense texture like banana bread, excellent for breakfast with cream cheese, or as a dessert. Next time will add more walnuts as i love them, def going to make again.

I loved this cake.  Perfect fall treat.  Moist, flavorful, delicious (especially with a cream cheese drizzle frosting).

I'll definitely do this one again, I was 'helped' by my two youngest sons as well and it still turned out great, everyone came back for more. Thank you for a really good recipe.

This recipe is my husband's favorite. It is very moist and I have substituted chopped dates for the raisins on occasion. I also left off the glaze and the cake was wonderful.

Excellent recipe. I left off the glaze and it was perfect, not too sweet. I used a springform pan because I didn't have the fancy mold. I actually made this recipe to pair with a wine tasting due to the spices in this cake, and everyone devoured it! Will definitely make again.

This is the one! The best apple cake recipe I have ever tried. Not too sweet, not too tart, it's just right.

FABULOUS RECIPE! My 11 year old daughter made this cake for a 4-H show (with a little of my help), and the cake is awesome! The only changes we made was, we did not add raisins, and did use any substitutions. Also, the apples were chopped finely. The picture showed big chunks. (we used Granny Smith Apples)
The only thing I would change next time is the powdered sugar on top.. since it kept clumping from the moisture even after the cake was cooled completely. Next I will make a thin icing & not use very much at all.

LOOOOVE IT!!!!

We really liked this cake, and my husband is not a cake person.  I used a cream cheese frosting, and it complimented it well.  There are a couple things about it that I would have to mention.  There are almost too many apples in it.  When put in the refrigerator overnight, the flavors melded beautifully, but the texture was a little mushy.  Maybe it was the kind of apple I used...?  I also baked it in a 9x13, rather than a tube pan.  It still came out fine.  All in all, a very good cake!

I'm so glad I found this recipe. This recipe helped my terminally ill cancer friend going thru chemo. Everything tasted like chemicals EXCEPT she would eat a piece of this and then she was able to eat her other food. Feeding tube was then removed!!! Thanks!

I have to agree with a past reviewer, this was too "spicy!" If it weren't for that, it would've been fine.  I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup ( 1/2 white and brown) and cooked the apples over the stove top with the spices and brown sugar and then processed them.  I also reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and used 1/2 cup of apple sauce and used 4 small apples and 1/2 cup of more apple sauce.  I then threw everything in the processor and let it do it's thing.  Actually cooked in just 45 mins.

I have made this cake several times and each time I make it I gave rave reviews.  Extremely tasty and moist.
