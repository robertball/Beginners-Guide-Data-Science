I really wondered about this recipe when I first saw it, but I tried it for Memorial Day weekend, and it was excellent.  It was by far better than store-bought Margarita mixes I had been using.  We can't wait to make more!  This is a very delicious margarita!

Absolutely Fantastic!  I've had o share this one with eveyone that tastes it.  Be sure to rub the rims with a cut lime and dip the glass in coarse salt.  Also, I enjoy the taste of tequila so used a little more and also triple sec.

This is not a margarita. Margaritas don't have orange or pineapple flavors.

I've been travelling in Mexico for the past 3 months and this is by far my favorite Margarita.  Be careful though, this is so tasty you just want to drink more and more...

I made this over the summer for a barbq and everyone really liked it, for a change from the normal margarita.  The only thing I would do differently would be to increase the Triple Sec and tequila.  Definitely a hit though!

I modified this recipe by making the limeade double strength, adding 1 1/2 cups tequila, and 1/4 cup triple sec.  It went from being somewhat watered down to a margarita people rave about!

YAHOOOOO!  These were a nice change from the norm.  I'm not sure what was meant by the already prepared limeade, so I winged it.  I added 3 oz. tequila, 1 oz. triple sec & ice to the blender.  Delish, thanks Angela!

This may not be a traditional margarita, but it is delicious!  I like to keep the limeade concentrated and just add a little water, rather that making as the package instructs, for a more limey flavor.

Not impressed at all.  It tasted more like a fruit drink instead of a Margarita, the pinapple juice was the big turn off.

This was not a margarita. It tastes like pineapple juice. Too much of that, not enough limeade, not enough tequila. I don't like strong drinks but this was a shot of tequila for a pitcher (that's how much this made).

This Margarita was much too watery.  Did she really mean 2 Cups of limeade already prepared.  My husband made it again using the concentrate as is and it was much better.

This is a fantastic margarita!!  I prepped it a little differently by using the method from another margarita recipe on this site. I filled the blender with ice then added 6oz of limeade concentrate, 6oz of tequila, 2-3 oz of triple sec, (I know its more alcohol than called for) the 1/2 cup of oj and 1/2 cup of pineapple  - delish!!

Yum! Yum! Yum! It isn't too sour and it isn't too sweet. I fixed these for a dinner party and they were a hit. My friend also served them at her wedding reception and the guests loved them. This is my go-to margarita recipe. I love it because it's homemade and not from a mix.

For us it was too much pineapple flavor and was on the weak side.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I added about half again as much tequila and Triple Sec. It is my husband's new favorite drink recipe for summertime.  We had it for a family dinner for Cinco de Mayo, everyone loved it-I can't wait to share it with our friends!

Didn't have pineapple juice, so I doubled up on the orange juice instead.  Made the lime concentrate stronger because we love lime and I wanted a more margarita flavor over a tropical/fruity flavor.  Very good!

This is awesome... IF you use the limeade concentrate straight from the can (Don't mix the limeade with water) and use about 6 ounces of tequila with 2-3 ounces of triple sec. It might not be an "authentic" margarita but it's definitely an awesome version of a margarita. Although a WARNING: BE CAREFUL, it tastes so good and refreshing the next thing you know, you and all your friends are drunk.
