This had a great flavor, but the sauce seemed too thick.  It was almost a paste, and it just stayed on top of the carrots and onions.  I made this for my husband and another couple, and we all agreed that it tasted great.  I think next time I'll add an extra 1/2 cup of milk or reduce the flour and butter to 2 tablespoons each.  Thanks for sharing a new vegetable dish!

Very good.  Sauce could have been made thinner and carrots cooked a bit longer. I'll try these couple things next time I make the recipe.

This was very easy to make and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I used a sweet onion, added a little more cheese than it called for & used Parmesan flavored bread crumbs.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This is very good. I did change a few things. I boiled the carrots and onions in chicken broth and I used Parmesan Cheese instead of Cheddar because that was what I had. Very tasty!!

It was a recipe that we will not repeat. It was a very plain uninteresting in flavor.

This came together easily. This appealed to me because I usually have these ingredients on hand and I'm always looking for a new way to serve veggies. I added a bit more cheese and used sharp white cheddar. I also added a couple shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce. If you aren't big on crumb toppings, you might want to cut it in half. I'll update on how we all liked it after dinner. (If I make this again, I might add a half cup of cauliflower puree for more veggies and fiber.)EDITED: I liked this, the rest of my family didn't. Too bad, it's really good.

This was a surprising recipe.  I was a bit skeptical but have to admit it was delicious.  This was a definite hit.

I think that with my modifications it was a good recipe.

First of all... fry or steam the vegetables. You lose flavor and nutrition with boiling. I fried.

I also added thyme , oregano, and garlic to the sauce. I also added more salt and pepper to the recipe. I didn't find the sauce too thick. It came out with just the right amount thickness.

I had to make my own bread crumbs, so I added some Italian seasoning.  

The recipe would be great with a different cheese as others did!

I love this side dish! Great with pork chops, healthier substitute for mac and cheese too. I added a bit of thyme, microwaved the veggies instead of boiling and used my hand blender to puree.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It wasn't very good, it had no taste. Thanks for your effort though :)

This was really good. I think more margarine is needed for the bread crumb mixture, but other than that, it was good. I didn't boil the onions and didn't need to and I also used cut up carrots and only boiled them a couple minutes. They were still firm and not soggy when they came out of the oven. My husband ate A LOT of this! He really liked it and so did I. My 5 year old didn't because of the onions, but you can't please everyone!
