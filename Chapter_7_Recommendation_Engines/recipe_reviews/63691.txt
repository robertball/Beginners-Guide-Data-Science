I really enjoy this recipe.  I do a couple things differently to suit my own tastes since I dislike syrup.  I also change the prep method as well to make it a little easier for me.  To start with I mix my ingredients in a small food processor which I use a great deal on South Beach.  I keep the ingredients list the same but with the addition of a little splenda.  I dislike syrup so this gives me that bit of sweetness.  I fix these in my waffle maker instead of on the stove.  I spray it with a little cooking spray and divide this out into two portions then close it up and wait until done which with my waffle iron is when the light goes off.  I eat them either plain or I top them with pureed strawberries.  I take three to four frozen strawberries that I thaw in the microwave a bit and then whirl them through that mini food processor.  I then put this on top of my "waffles".  It's very filling and a change of pace.  These can also be done in advance, cooled, flash frozen, then vacumm sealed, and put in the freezer for later use.  To reheat either zap in the microwave or pop in the toaster or toaster oven.  I've made these with egg substitute with the same great results and I've also left out the spices and liked it that way too.  It's a great starter recipe.  You can even add just a little chopped nuts, peanut butter, fruit, or other spices like pumpkin pie spice for variety just don't get it too terribly wet with added ingredients.

While I appreciated the healthiness of these pancakes, I wasn't too thrilled about the spongy texture.  I think it calls for too much egg.  As I was quadrupling the recipe recently (for easy breakfast later on in the week), I made a happy accident (left out some egg) that yielded much more pancake-like texture.  2 C oats (processed until fine powder), 2 C cottage cheese, 2 C egg whites, 1 egg, 3 Tbsp ground flax, 1 tsp baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, stevia, splash of almond milk to thin it out.  I let the batter sit for 5 minutes before cooking.  What a difference this made in the texture!  These puffed up and was more bread-like whereas the previous ones were flat, spongy, and somewhat soggy.  If you're just making a single serving, I'd recommend decreasing the egg whites to 3.

WOW! A real pancake with more protein than net carbs, almost no fat, and low glycemic index thanks to the oatmeal -- and it still tastes good! Unbelievable. I make this very easy recipe several times a week. To make this pancake light and fluffy/eggy instead of somewhat dense and grainy: I use 1/3 cup cottage cheese, 1/2 cup egg substitute, and 3 packets of artifical sweetener. This time I served the pancake with a thin layer of butter and a bit of maple syrup. Also delicious with reduced-sugar strawberry preserves.

I make a quadruple batch of these every week for my three year old!  I just take a few out of the fridge every day.  One variation that we love is to replace the cottage cheese with yogurt and add half a microwaved sweet potato and another egg. Just poke holes in the sweet potato and microwave until it's soft.  You can peel it with your fingers once it's cooler and add it to the foodprocessor after you've processed the oatmeal on it's own.

This is one of my favorite things to eat!  I do, however, make a few modifications- I use 1/2 cup of fat-free cottage cheese and 5-6 egg whites to make them  more "crepe" like.  I also add lots of splenda and lots of cinnamon to taste.  You definitely need to use a blender for this recipe- mixing by hand will not suffice.  They're so easy and fast to make, and they're DELICIOUS!  I made them for my mom and she was shocked at how good they are.  They're not completely like a pancake, but good in their own way.  Love them love them love them! :)

I had a lot of trouble getting these pancakes to not stick in the pan. If anyone else is having trouble as well, I've adapted the recipe so you don't need to use a pan. Trust me, this works like a charm!
Process the oatmeal to a smooth, flour-like consistency before combining with the rest of the ingredients.
In two small casserole dishes (about 4 or 5‚Äù in diameter), divide the pancake mixture. Cover with paper towel or plastic paper; microwave for 90 seconds. Pancakes will puff up. Check by lifting slightly to make sure the bottoms are set. If pancakes are still runny underneath, microwave another 15 to 20 seconds. Pancakes should easily invert onto plates.
I also like to toast them in the toaster oven on a small cookie sheet sprayed with cooking spray. (I like everything crunchy!)
Sidenote to TEVANS211, whey protein powder is NOT to be cooked. The protein isolates in whey protein powder are destroyed when cooked, and have no nutritional value. Alternatively, you should try adding defatted soy flour to recipes. It's loaded with protein and also superhigh in fibre.

I give this recipe 5 stars for health plus taste. No need to change anything, the texture and taste is just right for such a healthy dish, and the nutritional value is fantastic! I recommend serving w/ the "Blueberry Sauce" recipe submitted by Isybel (substituting the sugar w/ splenda/honey). I also threw in some whey protein powder (about 1/3 c.) for all you other fitness fanatics out there.

I like this healthy oatmeal pancake recipe, by adding one banana and some sugar, it gives additional flavor and softness. It's even better. Try out, you'll like it. ;P

This is a great recipe.  I eat these pancakes on Saturday or Sunday mornings so I can feel like I'm cheating without really doing it.  I did find the original recipe a bit bland, so I added some salt and splenda and more cinnamon.  Also,another great addition is sugar free spiced cider.  Just toss in a packet of sugar free instant cider for a kick of apple for only 10 calories more.  It's great.

These were good. I was totally surprised...I didn't think I would like them after I made the batter. I thought for next time, I'm going to try a packet of the flavored oatmeal. Should be just as good, if not better.

We really enjoyed them. I added wheat germ & flax because I thought my batter was too thin. That might have been because I used 2 whole eggs. Once it sits for a minute it thickens a bit. I added walnuts. Great, healthy & filling. Thanks!

Great recipe for South Beach, but these pancakes tend to be very dense.  I amended the recipe for light, fluffy pancakes which won't leave you missing the 'real' pancake experience.  Here's how:  Mix everything BUT 3 eggs white in a small food processor.  (Can use a blender, but the mix is too thick and doesn't blend well.  If you use a blender, add about 1/4 cup 1% or skim milk to loosen it.)  Add a packet of Splenda to sweeten the mix.  Put the oatmeal mixture into a mixing bowl.    Beat the remaining 3 egg whites to soft peaks, add a packet of Splenda, then beat just until the whites firm up to hard peaks.  Take 1/4 to 1/3 of the beaten whites and mix it into the oatmeal mixture to loosen it.  (Adding it all will deflate the whites.)  Then gently fold in the remaining beaten egg whites.  Cook as usual, and you have delicious, light, airy pancakes without the carbs!  For a 'syrup', I put fresh or frozen fruit (Phase 2-friendly) into a small saucepan over medium-low heat.  Sprinkle on one packet of Splenda and heat so it releases juices, usually mashing the fruit a bit to extract more.  Heat until the juices thicken and keep warm until pancakes are done.    For an added touch of richness, I'll add a small dollop of butter to melt into the fruit at the end.  And it's easy to play with this 'syrup'.  With blueberries, add some grated lemon peel.  With peaches, add a little orange peel.  Have fun with different flavors and enjoy some good-for-you, 'decadent' pancakes!

I like these even more than regular pancakes, and so do my kids and husband.  A couple minor adjustments I made for personal preference: 1) Added some Splenda to taste; 2) A little less egg; 3) if you don't like the consistency (some like thin pancakes, some like thick), add more oatmeal or add a little ff or lf milk until you like the consistency.  You really can't taste the cottage cheese at all.  I made them once with milk instead of cottage cheese--that was good too.  I also added mashed banana one time, and that was delicious!  I'm going to add blueberries next time.

Though this did turn out a sort-of pancake-y result, this isn't quite right for ME. I will try this recipe again with chibi chef's suggestions and see if it doesn't turn out a little better for me.

This makes one huge pancake. I put all the ingredients in my new food processor and mixed until smooth. Very filling. Only 5 points on Weight Watchers. I only had a pinch of nutmeg so added some pumpkin spice. I used sugar free syrup on it. Quick, easy, healthy breakfast.

Lets face it, if you don't like eggs, you are not a good fit for this diet!  These were ok, however because of the carbohydrate content, I will not be making again.  Very high for a bland breakfast!

I wasn't real sure about this one when I read the recipe but, after I made it I will never eat regular pancakes again!  These are so much better for you and I love the nutty texture.  I will make these instead of the empty carb pancakes!

I am not doing the southbeach diet but I still make these pancakes on Sunday morning because they are healthy, really fill you up (not with sugar though) and taste great!  I highly recommend them with some razberry jam.

Wow!  I loved this pancake--and I used to hate pancakes! I am not on the South Beach Diet, but have committed myself to eating mostly whole foods and restricting processed or refined foods.  This recipe hit the mark.  I made my pancake with 2 egg whites and 1 whole egg, I forgot to add the vanilla, and I added a squirt of honey.  To top the pancake, I sliced a Fuji apple into thin slices, sprinkled them with cinnamon and a little honey and microwaved until soft.  Just a warning, this pancake is BIG and it will fill you up.  I couldn't even finish mine!  One complaint I have with the recipe is that it is advertised as "low-carb".  It's not really low in carbohydrates (there are no standards for calling a food low-carb).  Oatmeal is a carbohydrate, but it is a whole grain and is very good for you; especially for heart health.

These were great and more flavorful than ordinary pancakes.  I used two eggs instead of 4 egg whites because I hate waste and don't have a cholestrol problem. I added some semi sweet chocolate chips to make them sweeter and tastier (Yes, you can chocolate in Phase!).  What a treat for breakfast!

Every bit as yummy as regular pancakes.  I used two whole eggs instead of only egg whites and topped them with sugar free syrup.  Terrific!

I really like these pancakes because they're so healthy and easy to make.I usually half the recipe and add blueberries to the top as they are cooking.It makes 3 pancakes which is perfect for me.I also sometimes eat these with a little natural peanut butter and syrup on top.If you are trying to eat healthy this is a really great recipe.

i was pleasantly surprised! The combo of eggs, oatmeal, and cottage cheese did not sound appealing but it was the exact consistency of pancakes. i made a cpl modifications. did 2 eggs (not egg whites) and cinnamon sugar because thats what i had on hand. i had no vanilla extract either. they turned out great. I only had sugar free jelly to top it with but it was yummy and would have been phenomenal with sf syrup!

Yum! I only had one egg white, so I just used that and use Activia light vanilla yogurt instead of the cottage cheese. I also threw in about a teaspoon of baking soda to give it some rise. It was delicious! I also blended some natural low sugar maple syrup with some blueberries. Delicious!

By the time I got to Phase Two of the South Beach Diet I was ready to eat the pattern off of the china plate! These pancakes hit the spot. They are easy to make and taste great! Now My wife & I have these one or two times per week. OBTW I've lost 70 lbs since mid-March 2009 (AND still loosing a pound or per week.)

I love these pancakes!  They are so healthy and they taste better than buttermilk pancakes.  Personally I think buttermilk pancakes are to thick and heavy.  They make me feel all blotted after I eat them.  You can add wheat germ or berries to them to to make them even healthier.  I have even got some of the pickiest kids to eat them before.  I use 2 eggs instead of using the egg whites.  I perfer to put strawberry spread on them to instead of syrup.

Not bad at all.  I generally make double the recipe and use 3 whole eggs and add maybe 2 teaspoons of brown sugar (I'm not on the diet, I just wanted an easier way to eat oatmeal).
Also, this pancake can translate well to a savory pancake.  Like others have mentioned, this pancake can be pretty bland.  You can dress it up in other ways than the cinnamon/sugar, fruit suggested.  Add some green onions, salt, and five spice, and it's a nuttier version of green onion pancakes.  The oatmeal makes a good base from which to launch.

These actually turned out fluffy!  I couldn't believe it.  But, definitely add some Splenda to the mix.  I used Pumpkin Pie spice to jazz up the flavor.

Also, I discovered that I'm having some sensitivity to eggs, so I used a single serving container of apple sauce instead of the eggs.  It seemed a little dry, but still turned out okay.  

And, boy, do they keep you full!

This was a real treat after 3 weeks on South Beach!  But we would enjoy it even if we were not.  The pancake has a wonderful flavor and was perfect with sugar free syrup.  I used 2 whole eggs and a pinch of nutmeg.  With its hardy, oatmeal flavor, I think it would be perfect with apples - I'll try that next time!

I am thrilled to have found this one! Blend it very well to avoid lumps. I omit the nutmeg due to personal taste, and add a packet of sweetener. I've made it both with egg whites or two whole eggs, can't tell any difference.  I love' em!

I made this recipe as originally written, but added extra oats, as I found it was a bit runny.  They were pretty good for a low carb pancake.

I made this with 2 whole eggs instead of the 4 egg whites.  This HAS to be blended well.  It is VERY tasty!  I served it sprinkled with cinnamon and some sugar free syrup.  Can't wait to try it with a mashed banana like others have suggested.  Even my 2 year old loved this!

I made this recipe after reviewing everyone else's comments and made the suggested changes to this recipe.  I added 1 tsp brown sugar Splenda, 1 tsp baking powder, only put in 2 egg whites, and 1 tsp of oil.  I did add a little milk to make the batter a little thinner.  This recipe turned out great and my son loved it.  I did not miss the flour at all in this recipe.

I LOVED the pancakes! I put some splenda into the mixture, I did not put nutmeg, and the taste was delicious.  (And to think it is healthy). My 5 year old did not like it. She took one bite, said she was full, and did not want anymore. In the end, she said, "I am sorry to say this, mama, but I didn't really like it."  I will not make it again.

These pancakes were wonderful! The first time I made them, they were a bit bland. The second time, I added a tablespoon of brown sugar and some raisins. The texture of these pancakes are a little different, they're moist and slighly heavier. I also used tofu and 1 egg instead of 4 egg whites. Add something sweet, or it'll be blandish.

I read some of the ratings especially the low ratings. Follow this and it is good, better then pancakes. I did not like the over powering taste of nutmeg so added apple spice seasoning in place of the nutmeg. Adding apples crushed or other fruit makes it better. You can get the right consistency that you want by adding more milk. It is not gooey if you bake it right and you can use cast iron if you get it hot enough.

DO NOT USE A CAST IRON SKILLET!!!  Definitely use teflon.  This was good - except it kind of became scramble in the pan.  I added some Splenda to the recipe and topped it with some butter.  IDEA:  baking it in a dish - sweetened, it resembles a whole grain bread pudding!  Very good!

I agree that adding a little bit of splenda adds to it.  Also, the recipe which it says is one serving was enough for my husband and me.

These are very good.  The texture is different from "conventional" pancakes--they are much denser.  I've even used the entire egg with good results.

This recipe wasn't too bad for what it was, although the pancake didn't rise at all, which I wish it had.  I used cottage cheese and 2 whole eggs, not 4 egg whites (didn't want to waste the 4 yellows).  I also added Splenda to sweeten the batter but it could have used a lot more.  This recipe made enough to have 2 or more pancakes, but I only made one and threw the rest of the batter out.  I don't know if I'll be making these again.

These are awesome pancakes!  The only thing I did differently was blend the oatmeal and then blend the rest of the ingredients.  Then I mixed them together, but not in the blender.  May add a dash of salt next time.

I made a few changes to this one... add about 1 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder and 1 packet splenda. maybe more or less cinnamon/ nutmeg to taste. it turns out really good. 
i also made a second batch with a little less egg and little more cottage cheese..they were a little softer. 
i was missing a sweet treat in the am, and this really made my day, a few times.

An excellent twist on the ol' pancake.  The vanilla is an excellent touch.  I like using anything BUT white flour, and this recipe allowed for oatmeal to take flour's spot.

Not exactly my favorite pancake, but because it is so healthy I make it occasionally.

delicious.So simple to make and very filling.Have patience in waiting to flip them over in pan as they tend to break apart if you try too soon.

These pancakes are just what i like. They are dense, but that means they really fill you up. I am more of a savory girl, so I ad things like squash, tomatoes and onions on top. No sweet in my pancakes. Happy eating and enjoy being full for fewer calories.

I love these pancakes and have been making them since 2004! Definitely beat the egg white separately and then fold them into the mixture to add some fluffiness. A great pancake to experiment with and one of my favorites is pouring the pancake in the skillet, sprinkling vanilla granola on one side, and flipping it to fully cook on the granola side. Adds so much crunch and flavor!

After reading another review, I left out an egg. The consistency was really good and they puffed up really well. The nutmeg was really strong, so I will leave that out next time I think.  They were excellent with the blueberry sauce by Isabel as mentioned by another reviewer. I will prob. make these again!

This is an awesome pancake for those of us who are dieting and want lower carb, higher protien foods.  It is a bit grainy, but has decent texture, and matches well with fresh fruit and no sugar added syrup.  What an innovative way to make a pancake!

Good for a healthy breakfast. It definitely needed 1 splenda packet. I only used 1/2 of the nutmeg and also added extra liquid egg whites to make the pancakes fluffier.  next time i will try it with apple or banana.

We love these pancakes.  Try modifying them for variety.  This morning I used: 1 cup oatmeal, 1 cup all whites egg whites, 1/2 cup cottage cheese, 2 packs of splenda and 1 dozen regular size strawberries all blended together.  Using an electric no-stick skillet works perfectly!  These were actually a bit "fluffy" when cooked at about 350 degrees.  Yum!

This recipe has been a lifesaver for me!  I was tired of eggs and getting weak when looking at my daughter's frozen waffles but then made these and LOVE THEM!  We also took our the allspice and added a couple teaspoons of Splenda.  My 11 year old daughter loves these too and she is a picky eater.  We had them w/ the microwaved apple someone suggested which was good but I can eat them plain and even cold.  I process the oats first in a mini chopper then add them last to the blender to get the right consistency.  These pancakes are not light and fluffy and remind me more of french toast than a pancake.  Highly recommend!

I can never find a recipe for pancakes that doesn't involve buttermilk and wheat flour, but this was EXCELLENT!

I microwaved a smalled peeled and diced apple with some cinnamon and tablespoon of water to put on top.  With a little syrup I have a favorite!

Great recipe!  I am a Type 2 Diabetic and this was great for my blood sugar! If you want to reduce the carbs further you can substitute soy flour for the oatmeal.  We had to add some milk to get a better consistency.  They were great!  We made a sugar free cherry maple syrup to go over them and sliced some fresh mango to go alongside them!  Will be a staple in our household!

Maybe if I were on the South Beach Diet and desperate for something carb-like, I would have more appreciation for these.  However, I found them very disapointing; the texture is very unpleasant.

I didn't add vanilla or nutmeg since I didn't have them on hand. These pancakes are pretty good, a bit gooey in the middle so I might add more oatmeal. I blended the oatmeal first, then added everything else. I also put in about 4 times as much cinnamon! I tried a bunch of toppings but my favorite was some margarine and cinnamon "sugar" sprinkled on top.

These taste just like the incredibly decadent German pancake I used to eat at a restaurant called Elmer's--until I started watching what I eat.  I can't BELIEVE these are good for you!  My husband and I topped it with "I can't believe it's not butter."  I sprinkled mine with splenda and he spread sugar-free jam on his, and we both loved them.  This is also VERY filling.  They are not soft and fluffy like traditional pancakes, more like crepes as many have pointed out.  And they are not sweet at all, so if you aren't going to top them with anything, you may need to add splenda or fruit or something.  I'm just happy I can have pancakes again and not feel guilty about it!  Highly recommended.

I found this recipe because I was looking for a way to use up oatmeal.  I used tofu because I'm lactose intolerant, mixed by hand, and used whole eggs instead of whites because I hate to waste the yellows.  My first batch had two eggs and that made it very egg-y, like French Toast gone bad.  My second batch had one egg and that made it very heavy because they were so thick.  I think next time I will add some soymilk.
The taste is very nutty and rich, which I really liked.  This could pass for a fancy B&B breakfast with fresh fruit toppings.

I really enjoyed this change of pace. I thought it tasted good and was hearty to last me for a while. Instead of 4 egg white, I used 3 whole eggs and skipped the nutmeg. I also added a bit of 1% milk to make it more of a crepe type of recipe.

Like many others, I'm trying to loose weight & eat  healthier.  I like oatmeal & oat flour in recipes, so thought this would be good.  I threw it out.  Bland & dry.  Won't be making again.

My kids & I really like these! I added the whole egg & didn't add as many eggs as the recipe called for, added a little Sweet 'N Low & a little more cinnamon. I eat them plain & will make them alot, since they are so good & easy!

I made these for the entire family without telling them they were low carb and the kids loved them so much that I don't make the old version of pancakes anymore I serve these instead !

These were different. As long as you don't go into it expecting them to taste like regular pancakes, they're not bad. I made mine according to the directions and they looked good and the texture wasn't bad, but the flavor was a bit odd. I ate mine kind of plain, and I think they'll be a lot better with a sugar-free syrup or a low-sugar fruit topping. (Maybe cooked with some blueberries?)  I did appreciate a recipe for pancakes that I can eat on the South Beach diet and will definitely be making these again. Oh, and like one other reviewer mentioned, they are VERY filling, which is a bonus.

these are exactly what i was looking for. a healthier more protien rich alternative to regular pancakes. i dont feel guilty eating these! i love them topped with fresh fruit, and instead of syrup i pour a bit of fresh fruit smoothie over them.

Tastes like cardboard, looks like circles of cardboard. I made the recipe as written. I will admit that they do stick with you. I had these  on Sunday at about 8 a.m. & they kept me from getting hungry til at least noon. That's really the only positve thing I can write about this recipe.

I didn't like the flavor of these pancakes at all. My toddler wasn't interested either.

A really tasty pancake! I'm not on the South Beach diet, but thought I'd try it out since it looked so healthy. The cinnamon and nutmeg make it so nice that some wont even need syrup. And for those who aren't fans of cottage cheese, you barely taste it! (Actually I couldn't taste it at all!)
