I doubled this recipe to make two drinks. I made homemade lemonade specifically for this recipe using fresh lemons, Truvia and cold water. My husband didn't even miss the sugar, he actually asked me how I got it to taste better than usual. We loved this drink.

Summer staple in our home.  Love the mixture, plus you can add a shot of vodka to liven it up if you are in a merry mood!

My favorite summer drink. Try a strong Arnold Palmer-mix in a shot of vodka into each glass. Very refreshing!

Love the combination of iced tea and lemonade!  I made a batch of unsweetened iced tea and used prepared organic lemonade from Costco.  Great flavor and a wonderful summer drink!

I usually buy the pre-prepared plastic jug of "Arnold Palmer Half & Half Iced Tea Lemonade" but this homemade version is a better option. The only thing is I usually buy the "Lite" jug that cuts down the sweetness (and sugars/calories) better than just reducing the sugar. So I'm going to have to play around a bit with the recipe using part sugar, part sweetener (Stevia?). If anyone tries this before I get a chance to post, please do! Oh and one more thing: like other reviewers I also make my lemonade & tea from scratch instead of prepared as directed in the recipe, it turns out 10 times better. Great recipe in all though!

I have been making this type of ice tea since I was a kid in the 1950's we called it "church tea" because when we had a pot luck at church they made gallons of the stuff!  It  is still my favorite way to drink the house wine of the South.  My way is simple: Sugar in the pitcher (you control how sweet the tea is this way), fresh squeezed lemon juice (I never bothered with taking out the pips). You can use splenda if you are on a sugar free regimen. The tea is brewed on the stove by boiling water with the tea bags until it was dark (it will be stronger than steeped tea) pour over the sugar and lemon, stir to melt sugar.  Ad additional water or ice cubes to dilute to the strength to taste.  BTW, I don't know what Arnold Palmer had to do with it.  I bet he had it in Augusta and loved it!  It is also called California tea. The shot of Vodka is a great addition! Another twist is to add Sweet Basil leaves and let those steep in the hot tea. Delicious!

Good stuff but all these years (plenty of them too) I thought it was an alcoholic beverage.

My mother used to make this when I was a child. It was how my daddy always drank his tea. Perfect half and half mixture. Made a great addition to our holiday table.

I gave this recipe four stars because, according to Arnie himself, it should be as he invented it, which is three parts iced tea to one part lemonade. Made this way, it's an irresistible and refreshing drink, especially on Sunday afternoon at the Masters!

I make several gallons per week in the summer. Neither coffee nor water do it for me, and I've been drinking AP for several years. Even in the winter, it's my water substitute. I don't strictly use this recipe. I mix mine with instant ice tea and Crystal Light lemonade. Even my 5 and 7 year old neighbor kids love it.

I've been mixing these for years, in different proportions depending on the individual preference. I always brew the tea from scratch, and sometimes I make the lemonade too.

Just mix Firefly Sweet Tea Vodka with Simply Lemonade on the rocks. My wife and I LOVE this by the pool!
