This is how I grew up, learning to make scrambled eggs from Grandma. She always kept a container of bacon grease in her fridge that she used for various dishes, in particular scrambled eggs. She also made hers in her cast iron skillet, which I also do as well. I don't make this all the time but when I'm looking for comfort food or a bite of a memory, this is one of my go-to foods. I serve it with sausage or bacon, home fries and buttered toast. My kids and husband love this recipe just as much as I do.

Well, you only live once...that being said I decided since I was frying bacon anyway I'd give this a try. I only used a bit of bacon grease to fry the eggs as I didn't want them necessarily "floating" in grease. Overall they were very good. Not, something I'd do on a regular basis because I'm not looking to have a "heart attack" or cause my husband to have one either. And while I was on a bacon grease kick I decided to go ahead and pair this with "Dad's Kentucky Home Fries" from this site. I think the only healthy on our plates was the whole grain toast!

Growing up, whenever we had bacon and eggs, the eggs were fried in the bacon grease. No butter, no margarine, no oil. Bacon grease. In fact, my parents always kept a container of leftover grease in the fridge (cool the grease a little in the pan and pour it into a lidded heat-resistant container) and my siblings and I keep containers of it in our fridges. Bacon grease adds awesome flavour to so many fried things, from mushrooms to pancakes. :) Yeah, it's not so great for you, but sometimes you just gotta go for taste! Thanks for the post, Kirbert70!

The best way to fry eggs! My grandma lived to be nearly 100 years old and she ate eggs cooked this way all the time, so they can't be all bad :)

I don't have to worry about fitting into my jeans. And if I ever have a heart attack, it'll probably be from stress. So when I get in the rare mood to have a fried egg... this is the ONLY WAY to do it up, in bacon grease! You might as well enjoy it once in awhile, since nothing quite compares to the flavor... not even butter. Love this recipe!

My husband makes bacon and eggs this way. He doesn't want to linger around with cancer someday, just wants to go quickly with a heart attack. We salt and pepper the eggs, add buttered toast and we are set for breakfast! We do this as a treat about once a month. Yum!

My mother taught me to cook them this way many years ago.  Another way is to baste the eggs with the grease instead of turning the egg.  That usually makes the yolk more runny so you can mop up the yolk with white bread toasted and buttered.  Counteract the cholesterol with a half of grapefruit sectioned and sugared.  Delish.

Yum! Reminds me of my dad. It was the only thing he could cook. When mom wasn't home, you knew this is what you would eat. It didn't matter what time of day or night it was. I try & get most of the grease off with a paper towel. I also only use pepper. A good applewood smoked bacon adds the salt. I also fry extra bacon to use later in broccoli salad or potato soup. Thanks!

Hooray for bacon grease!! This is the ONLY way that my family ever ate 'em, and we're a long-lived bunch too! As other reviewers have noted, this is THE best-tasting way to cook 'em. As to heart attacks- ya know, we (as a culture) didn't really have much of a problem with cholesterol or heart disease, not to mention the proliferation of cancers, until after the introduction of hydrogenated fats, in the form of shortenings and margarines. We use bacon grease, and real butter, at my house, and neither I, nor my kids, are anywhere near "fat" or "unhealthy", and my grandparents lived well into their 80's and 90's, eating these fats....so we say, bring on the bacon, and make that piecrust with LARD! YAY, NATURAL FATS!!!  ;o) Oh, and if you have grease left over after the eggs, it can be really tasty to throw some hashbrowns in the pan, when the eggs are done....  :o)

bacon fat is the best flavour for eggs.
i usually like to scramble the eggs in the fat (more flavour), as well as frying some mushrooms in the fat as well!

This is the only way to eat breakfast eggs as far as I'm concerned.  I've always eat them this way whenever I have bacon in the house.  Bacon, eggs, warm flour tortilla, and a cup of coffee - great way to start the weekend!

I have making breakfast this way for years. I gave it 4 stars because while my dh loves this, I don't like such greasy eggs. I make his first then make mine. When mine are done they go from the pan to a paper towel lined plate where I then pat them gently to remove the excess grease. Some still remains but I do my best. Cooking the eggs in bacon grease makes them delicious!

Now how could this not be good.  I did mine sunny side up and just kept spooning the hot bacon grease over my eggs till the top whites were cooked.  So good!

Not the healthiest but very yummy. Isn't this how almost everyone had breakfast growing up with a side of fried potatoes? I still like this every now and then.

I planned for a few days to make this, and frankly, I was nervous. But it wasn't really overwhelmingly greasy and heavy like I thought it might be. Fairly simple, but pretty good. I don't think I'd ever even fried eggs before, let alone in bacon fat. I used a pretty good quality bacon, so the results were pretty tasty. This is a good-sized, but not huge, breakfast for one person, and I just might make it again, once in a while. Thanks!

I was raised with this breakfast.  My father had bacon and eggs, I believe, every day.  I don't allow myself to have these more than a couple times a month for obvious health issues.  Like another review said, you can baste them.  Carefully baste the white until completely done, then baste sll over until the yolk is done to your liking.  This way you don't have undercooked egg whites but your eggs are not sunny-side up either.

I like to cook the eggs this way at the campground. I also fry the toast in the bacon grease. There is usually just enough to do the toast. Yum, growing up we never had eggs any other way.

My Polish grandmother used to make this all the time and when I make it for my son I call it "Polish Bacon & Eggs."  I usually drain the bacon grease to leave approx. 1 tablespooon in the pan and then scramble the eggs in that.  Anything made with bacon drippings is always yummy!  As long as you don't eat this every day for breakfast; moderation is the key!

This is a recipe of convenience after you've cooked the bacon and want to get the eggs cooked quickly for a hungry bunch. The eggs were delicious with this method but I recommend two tips:
- turn the pan on medium-low as turning the eggs will pop the yolk if the oil (grease) is too hot.
- place the egg on a paper towel to blot the grease, otherwise the eggs are FAR to greasy to eat

I make bacon all the time, but I don't cook my eggs in it. (Only one other time when I was trying a recipe on this site.) I have to say it was good, especially since I cooked it in the grease that had a lot of the little bits of bacon still left. Mmmm!  The only thing is I took a lot of the grease out of the pan and just left enough for the eggs to fry in. I didn't want my eggs completely soaked. Also, I didn't need to use salt or pepper--the eggs were flavored nicely.

I honestly don't think this this is much of a recipe. I think most people already do this when having bacon and eggs. I personally have done it this way my entire life. Everyone has always told me I make the best eggs though so this is a great way to do it.  I would give this 5 stars but like I said this is a basic recipe that most people already do.

This is the only way I've ever made bacon and eggs, it's my husband's favorite breakfast. Nowadays I use uncured pastured pork bacon, organic or locally grown eggs(they have the best yolk for toast dipping), and Ezekiel bread.

This was the only way I'd ever eaten a fried egg until I was in my mid-twenties.  I thought everyone did it!  It wasn't until a friend who stayed over for breakfast asked me to cook hers in butter and I had no idea what she was talking about or how to cook an egg in butter that I realized this wasn't the "norm".  We also scramble eggs in a little of the bacon drippings for extra flavor.  You can also use sausage grease if you've cooked sausage links or patties for breakfast for a great flavor.

My grandparents taught me this, although I feel the best way is to baste the eggs with the bacon grease instead of turning over. The best tasting eggs around!

Absolutely delicious! My dad has cooked his eggs this way for 60 years. He has one every morning - fries the bacon and toasts his bread, cooks the eggs in the grease and butters his toast, slaps the eggs, bacon and a slice of American cheese between the 2 pieces of toast and heads for his recliner! Good stuff, but then again, I don't turn mine black with pepper! lol - Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Absolutely the best. I do this on the grill outside. I put my bacon on a cookie sheet on the grill. Drain when crisp on a papertowel.  Then add eggs one at a time on the cookie sheet until done. Only problem....you get company when they start smelling the wonderful aroma. Breakfast on the grill in northern Minnesota is not a very long season, so we do it on sunny Sunday mornings and the neighbors start coming over...fun way to start the day.

An old family favorite!! I never liked this much, becaue they're too greasy for my taste buds..but members fo my family (dad, mom, grandparents, uncles, aunts) used to make this all the time. So if you like old time greasy dinner breakfast kind of eggs. This is for you. Enjoy.

My boyfriend really liked the flavor that the bacon juices gave to the eggs, but it was a little *too* hearty for him (and that's saying a LOT). He immediately asked for some vegetables on the side, and I quickly rinsed a few pieces of romaine lettuce for him. He seemed quite satisfied overall. My only complaint is that it is not something you want to serve company. It did not look very appealing, and I'm pretty sure that's why there are no photos posted for this recipe.

This is how I grew up eating my fried eggs. Sunnyside up, yummy... My favorite way to fry eggs! Way better than using anything else like criso or non stick spray. Doubled this though as we like two eggs each.

I think I am the only person who has never heard of cooking eggs in bacon fat. When I found this I thought what the hay maybe I've been missing out all these years. I think fried eggs taste better in butter. But it was nice to try something new. Thanks for the post.

This was my Sunday morning breakfast right up until I turned 30 and started to be concerned about my fat intake. Now it's a treat I indulge in about 5 times a year. It's the ONLY way my grandparents eat their eggs (two to three times a week and they're both hovering around 80 ~ go figure). Enjoy!

This is how we make our fired eggs if we have bacon. The bacon makes the eggs crispy on the sides. Butter is our 2nd choice if don't have bacon grease.

My Dad always made eggs this way. He passed away at the age of 90 with zero hearth issues.  I made this for the first time this morning. I won't make eggs again any other way ever again. They are super delicious. I cooked the bacon and then drained the excess fat out of the pan...no reason to cook your eggs in a half inch of bacon grease...a thin film is good. I also sprinkled a pinch of  parmesean/romano grated cheese, that I had in the fridge, into my scrambled eggs during the cooking process. Too good....Heavenly good :)

We love using bacon grease to fry or scramble eggs. I only cook one piece of bacon per egg and sometimes set the egg on a napkin to absorb any extra grease before serving.

I just find it strange that this recipe was even posted! It is the only way I have ever eaten fried eggs.  i still do and every restaurant I have eaten in cooks them this way. I always cook them in bacon grease and I also add it to my baked bean recipe along with bacon. I do not have a problem with cholesterol and never have and I am 62. I also use only real butter.

What a way to go! This is the way my mother and grandmother always fried eggs when I was growing up except they served them sunny-side-up or over-light. No firm eggs for them or me. That is the way I still prefer them. You could have only a mild heart attack if you used half olive or canola oil with the bacon fat. Butter with bacon fat is pretty tasty too.

Oh, it's delicious.  My daddy made them this way all the time, and died of a heart attack at 64.  I'm 49, and already on Crestor, so I don't eat bacon and eggs fried in the grease much, but yeah, it does taste good.

I applaud allrecipes for posting items like this that the newest of cooks can follow. And I agree, bacon grease is the only way to fry your eggs. I too keep a jar of bacon grease in the fridge for oh-so-many flavorful uses.

Even though I make 'em like this only a few times a year, I always feel guilty about it... Hence the four stars, though they are five star in taste.

These are the eggs I grew up on.  However, I do drain most of the grease from the pan and blot the eggs with a paper towel so they aren't so slimey.  My favorites are over medium and dip wheat toast in the yolk or broken with a slice of American cheese melted on top.

The only way I ever cooked fried eggs. I do drain a little of bacon grease, just to avoid all that splatter and popping. I always use my cast iron skillet for these.

This is the only way I was ever taught to have fried eggs, and I really have no desire to check any other methods out. You can always blot the grease from the eggs, that leaves some of the flavor and cuts a little bit of the fat. All I can suggest is wheat bread and a glass of milk to make this one of the most amazing breakfasts ever!

This is the only way to make fried eggs. They just aren't good without the bacon grease. I also cook french toast in bacon grease. Can't eat it every day, but it's a nice weekend treat!!

Mmm.. Definitely the best way to make eggs! When I was little, I had them made "sunny side up" so I could dip toast. Now I break the yolk and fry them up and they are mm, mmm, good.

This is the only way to fry an egg!  My mother fried eggs like this for 77 years.  I prefer to scramble the eggs in the bacon grease, but an over easy eats pretty fine too.  You have to die from something, might as well be delicious eggs.

My husband is in charge of fried eggs in our house and he has cooked them this way for many years.  However, what he does is cook up the whole pound of bacon, then crack the eggs into the pan.  Rather than flipping them over, he uses a spatula to push the hot grease over the tops of the eggs.  They taste great and we always have them with home fries and english muffins.

i always eat my eggs this way.  In fact, whenever i fry bacon, i save all the drippings in an empty jelly jar and keep in the fridge.  That way i can fry up the eggs really quick!

Very flavorful but I was kind of turned off by the color of the eggs. They did really look "dirty." Nevertheless, tasty.

Used to always make eggs this way and also drain the eggs on paper towel so they are not too greasy.  We call this method 'Dirty Eggs'.

OOHHHYEAH, man.  I discovered this gem of a meal when I was about 8 or 9, and I haven't looked back since.  I LOVE to eat my eggs and bacon (turkey bacon now that I'm older) this way, and at 26, I plan on eating them like this as long as I can stand at a stove and fry eggs and bacon.  If you really want to knock up that fat intake, put a few slices of cheese on top of the eggs in the pan....

Dad's been doing this for years and whenever I get the urge to burn some bacon, I crack one open to fry in the grease.  I will try it as another has by draining some grease before frying the egg as I usually feel it is too greasy.

Man this is good. We're pretty healthy eaters here, but once in a blue moon you've got to splurge. How boring life would be if we didn't now and then. Made this for hubby and he just loved them!!
