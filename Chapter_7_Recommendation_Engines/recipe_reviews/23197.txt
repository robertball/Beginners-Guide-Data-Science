Yum Yum Yum! I am so glad I read the reviews before I made this.  I made the chicken rolls and didn't bother trying to seal them, sprinkled them with part of the cheddar cheese and baked them. While they were baking, I heated the soup and milk and the rest of the cheese and spooned it on the chicken rolls right before we ate.  We LOVED this recipe and I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you so much Amy!

After reading others' reviews, I changed how this was baked. I stuff the crescent rolls and bake for 20-25 minutes. While baking, I make the sauce in a pan and pour it over the "chicken pockets" (as we call it) after they are baked. One of our new favorite dinners! So yummy!

This recipe took almost 3 times as long to cook as was stated.  The cream of chicken soup being poured over the chicken rolls made it very hard to get the rolls cooked without being doughy.  I had to cook for almost 45 mins before the rolls were close to being done.  It did taste good, but I think next time I'll eliminate the soup and just cook the chicken rolls by themselves...

After reading the reviews and needing a quick dinner with cooked chicken and cresents rolls I took a chance and made a few changes. It was delicious and quick!! Having worked with canned cresent rolls before I decided to not use triangles but rectangles. I took 2 triangles and patted together put chicken and cheese in middle and topped with 2 more triangles that had been patted together and forked the edges. This gave me 2 rectangles. I topped it with 1/2 canned soups 1/2 c. milk and cheese.

This is a great kid friendly recipe! The secret is to cook the rolls first then make the sauce on the stove and pour over the rolls just as you are about to serve them. I also added some onion powder garlic powder and pepper to the chicken first. This even works great with canned chicken.

EXCELLENT and so easy and quick! Followed reviewers' tip of laying squares on top of each other with cheese and chicken inside instead dealing with small triangles. The other tip of heating the milk soup and cheese on the side and then pouring over the cooked pastry a great idea. The second time I made this I microwaved some frozen chopped spinach and fresh sliced mushrooms for a couple minutes and then added it to the soup mixture and stirred until heated. It was a BIG hit! I'm sure other variations would be good too.

I read the reviews before I tried this one. Instead of the american cheese I used sliced swiss. I baked them without the sauce and then made the sauce in sauce pan and spooned over after the rolls came out of the oven. Also instead of chicken soup I used mushroom. Added about 10 fresh mushrooms to soup mixture. Family really liked it!

This recipe was fast and easy. Perfect for the working Mother! My family loved it. My only complaint was the Crescent rolls didn't get completely done on the bottom (I even let it cook over the time limit) Next time I will cook the chicken soup milk and cheese separatly and pour over after the stuffed Cresecent Rolls are done!

I took the advise of some other reviews and made 2 rectangular rolls they came out great. I also cooked the soup/milk/cheese mixture in a sauce pan and poured over the rolls after they came out of the oven.

I have been making these for years (my grannie gave me a tip about 10 or so years) I know alot of peps say it takes so long to cook then best thing to do is while you are making the sauce is to put the rolls in and let them bake until slightly brown and then pour the sauce over top....cuts the cooking time down big time also if it is to bland I bake my chicken in a broth bath with salt and pepper for extra flavor and use sharp instead of mild cheddar.

I am a 20 something that is still learning how to cook a variety of meals. My boyfriend and I were looking for meals that were easy but tasty. I remembered this dish because my grandma would make it for me when I was younger. I was very suprised when I cooked it and my bf finished his and said it was "really good". I don't get feedback with that enthusiasm much!!! Very good recipe. I haven't tried any variations yet.

I'm going to have to agree with some of the others here-- as great as this sounded the crescent rolls never really cooked right. Too doughy. And I left them in there for a long time. Also stuffing them was a pain. I probably won't make it again.

I enjoy this recipe for left over baked chicken. However I make the sauce while the rolls are baking on a cookie sheet and then spoon the warm sauce over each roll as it is served. This allows the crescent to become crispy brown and fluffy as it bakes - not soggy.

I should have followed my instincts (and the other reviews) and baked the rolls on their own before adding sauce. They didn't even come close to being done they were still very doughy. Trying to seal 1/2 cup of chicken into the triangle was difficult if I were to make this again I would use another can of crescent rolls and split each container into 4 rectangles instead. Also there is no seasoning whatsoever in this recipe so it's naturally very bland. I think that the concept of this recipe is very good but it really does need quite a bit of tweaking to get it to where it needs to be.

This was too much work. It tasted OK nothing spectacular. I had to bake it at least 10 minutes longer than suggested and it was still doughy. Maybe bake the rolls for awhile before adding the sauce? I don't think I'll make it again.

This is such great comfort food! Our oven is weird so we had to double the time in the oven. Once it came out though it was amazing! Served with some veggies it feels just like a chicken pot pie. Definitely will be making this again!

Too salty using the canned cream of chicken soups. Might try different brand or making my own cream of chicken soup. Otherwise very tasty--definately a keeper.

I def adjusted the recipe. Mix 4oz cream cheese with chicken and omit American cheese. Seasoning is everything so make sure you season your chicken mixture real well. While rolls are baking make soup mixture. Then add to top when rolls are done and bake an additional 5 min. Also I added steamed broccoli to my sauce. It was a wonderful entree that I served with salad!

Oh am I glad I tried this!!! I had four leftover crescent rolls so I just flattened them out and made two little pouches with the cheese and chicken. I mixed the soup mixture together in a pan and let it combine over slow heat. After 20 mintues in the oven the pouches were done so I added the soup mixture. One of my new favorites. Thank you!

This recipe is great-as long as you completely cook the cresent rolls BEFORE adding the sauce. I also made a vegetarian variation using broccoli instead of chicken and cheese soup instead of cream of chicken.

There was far too much "sauce" to allo the crescent rolls to cook.:( It was tasty though I just had to bake for a LOT longer and turn them to let the bottoms get baked.

I made this for supper tonight. My hubby who does not like chicken loved it. I took the advice of others and cooked the stuffed crescent rolls first and then added the sauce. I also wrapped a whole green chili around the cheese and chicken before rolling it. Added a can of mushrooms to the soup mixture. Very very good. Thanks.

I feel like even though I followed the recipe to the letter I missed something. The dough never really cooked so I ended up with Doughy Chicken Blobs. They tasted OK.

I did not read the reviews before I made this and I wish I did. I baked this for a long time and it was still doughy. I will probably try this recipe one more time but just make the sauce separately.

I modified this a little! Instead of using american cheese I mixed 1 block of lite cream cheese 2 Tbsp of lite sour cream and 3 tsp of dry ranch mix. I spread about 1 Tbsp of mixture on each roll. Added the shredded chicken and then rolled them up. I baked them per cresent roll directions. I eliminated the soup mixture and just opted for shredded cheese on the top. Baked a few minutes longer until cheese was melted. Less calories and still very yummy!

Would be better with a different cheese. I couldn't get my cresent rolls to contain enough chicken to be an adequate serving. But really easy and fast. Will work just fine in a pinch.

I wonder of the cook who posted this recipe will make a revision later saying "Oops i meant bake the rolls first and add the soup later!" I can't imagine how it would have baked otherwise! I did read reviews and based on that I used canned chicken (which was surprisingly good i couldn't tell it was from a can) i used all cheddar cheese I didn't have American cheese. I also made rectangles and not triangles.. I couldnt get them to seal very well but in the end that's not a big deal! I baked the stuffed rolls for 15 minutes and did the soups and milk on the stove. When rolls were done i poured soup mixture over rolls topped with cheese and baked for another 15 minutes. They turned out AMAZING! I mean these are dangerously good - I probably wouldn't make this if you're on a diet (unless it's your cheat day) LOL! My son is addicted and licked the bowl clean! This one is a keeper we will make again! Thank you frog69 for sharing this! We love it.

Fantastic! I deboned a rotisserie chicken that I bought at the grocery store. Didn't bother with trying to seal the rolls and it took about 30 - 40 mins to cook but was absolutely delicious! Worth the wait!

I’ve been making this for over 20 yrs, and it’s one of my favorite comfort foods! I always use rotisserie chickens when I can. They make a huge difference. But if not, just season your chicken and you’ll be fine. I grate 2 cups of sharp cheddar, putting 3/4 inside, and 1/4 over soup. I NEVER use sliced cheese. That wasn’t on the original recipe. Also, I put my crescent bundles in a bigger pan so they’re not crowded, put the crescents in pan, and then add soup mixture only around the rolls, not over them. I do this so the rolls cook better. I do cook a few minutes longer, but if you do it this way, by using a bigger pan, the soup layer has more room to spread, not drowning your rolls. And the soup tastes way better baked in the oven, I promise. I also use cream of chicken. I’ve seen this recipe with cheese soup as well, but going with the original recipe, we like the cream of chicken. I always serve with mashed potatoes and corn. It’s so yummy! :)

I followed the reviews and made rectangles swales like a pie. Then heated the sauce separately and poured it on after I took the chicken out of the oven. My teenaged son says this was a keeper - a modern take on a hot pocket!

This recipe is really good. I cooked it like suggested in other reviews without the soup mixture on it and they turned out good! Also I didn't have the rolls used in the recipe so I tried using Bisquick and shaping it in rectangles to roll up. It worked well! I'd love to try it with the rolls used in the recipe! I added mushrooms and some vegetables to the soup mixture...that was good!! I put some chicken in the soup mixture too.

Wish I would have read reviews first...VERY VERY TASTY but the crescent rolls do not cook up well with the soup mixture. I will definitely make this again but will cook the stuffed rolls first and then add the about half of the soup mixture. It was difficult to stuff the crescent rolls with so much stuff..I would suggest cutting down to 1/4 c chicken or use rectangles instead of triangles. Otherwise very YUMMY!

This was excellent. All three of my girls are extremely picky eaters and they loved it. We did make some modifications.... I used 2 rolls of cresents one on top and one on bottom and pinched the sides together. Instead of shreaded cheese we used velveeta. The sauce mixture we were a little scared of because it doesn't look that appealing in the bowl but worked out great. This would be a great recipe for someone with a home daycare I think the kids would love it and its pretty inexpensive to make. Thanks for the great recipe Amy:)

My husband really liked this recipe although I personally didn't care for the sauce. I did cook the sauce on the stove and poured on top of baked rolls as per previous suggestions.

This recipe is like one that my mom makes but different. I prefer my mom's recipe (I'll have to post it when I get it). This one just didn't do anything for me. I cooked the rolls seperate from the sauce and even though they were golden brown on top they seemed a bit doughy (maybe it was the cheese that made it seem doughy). My husband and child liked them but I don't think I'll make it again.

Make sure your chicken is seasoned. My family found it bland. But they are very picky.
