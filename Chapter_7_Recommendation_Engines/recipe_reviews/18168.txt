The texture was just a little more cake-like than I hoped, but the flavor was very good. I always soak raisins overnight in regular black tea if I am making fruit bread/cake etc. It's something my gran and mum have always done, and I really like the subtle flavor it gives the fruit. Thanks!

Soaking the raisins is great!  I added some cinnamon and pecans.  Very good sliced thick and made into French Toast.

Delicious!  Definitely do not forget to soak the raisins; it makes all the difference.  I added about 1 1/2 cups of chopped pecans, which added a nice touch.  Also, I had to bake it for about 1 hr. 15 min.  But otherwise it was very easy to make and tasty as well!

This recipe produced a nicely brown and moist cake-like bread, but I was not overly pleased with the tart-like aftertaste.  May work nicely for a brunch served with different kinds of cream cheese.

I love raisins so this bread was delicious!  Soaking the raisins definitely gives the bread extra moisture and flavour.
One change though: I reduced the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup.

If you didn't grow up eating "the bread in the can", you may not like this one; it's an acquired taste for most people, I think. I love it with plain cream cheese, and, like banana bread, it's better the next day. I made the recipe exactly as written, and it's perfect!

Not a success. It took an addition 7 minutes baking before the toothpick came out clean. Smelled amazing....tasted - Ehhh - not great. My 16 year old son said it tasted odd - and he will eat anything. He threw it away after a few bites. Will not make this again. It isn't a savory bread and it isn't a sweet bread like a pumpkin bread. Just odd.

do not use this recipe. I could not find my grandmas recipe so I  used this.  It is lacking key ingredients.

This bread reminds me of the bread my Mom made. I lost her recipe and had started to look for a similar one when I inherited my 95 year old Aunt's can tins. It was how my Mom had made it along with some nuts added. It takes the full hour to bake. My siblings and I always ate it with peanut butter. It was simple and delicious!
