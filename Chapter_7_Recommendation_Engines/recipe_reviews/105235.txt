Fabulous way to eat dandelions. Since I was finding these bitter per the recipe. I cooked  the greens up a little more. Not sure if these were as nutritious but at least not bitter. Fantastic side dish!

We never thought dandelions could taste so good!   I decided to go with an idea from another reviewer to slightly fry the dandelion greens and the onions together, then to coat them with the bacon salad dressing.  Don't despair if the potatoes consistency after cooking is slightly mushy.  With the greens served over them they taste great!

We received dandelion greens this week from the CSA we belong to.  We had never eaten them before, and this recipe sounded good (everything's better with bacon...right?).    It was OK.  I think the issue is that we just weren't wild about the dandelion greens - they were fairly tough and bitter.  We did saute them with the onions as suggested by others - can't imagine eating them raw.  If you love dandelion greens - I am sure you would like this recipe.  I did have a little trouble with the sauce - came perilously close to having scrambled eggs.  Quickly removed the pan from the heat (which was my mistake...the recipe does not say to have the heat on).  It got very thick, so I quickly stirred in some cream.  The sauce turned out fine and tasted good.  Thank you Kasia2 for submitting the recipe.  It was fun to try.  It doesn't seem fair to give it a 3 when we just didn't like the greens...as I said, those who enjoy dandelion greens will no doubt like this.  It's a lovely blend of flavors.

I didn't toss the boiled potatoes with butter, salt or pepper. I decided to saute the diced onion and shredded dandelion greens in the butter (they weren't too bitter this way, as the other reviewers' mention) before mixing them into the taters. I added roughly a teaspoon of Dijon mustard to the dressing; I do think the recipe could use a half recipe more of the dressing to have an amount I think would be just perfect. The mustard really gave it a nice touch. This is the first time I've tried this type of green and I like it. Will definitely make again.

This was so scrumptious!  I carefully picked my tender spring dandelions and had no bitterness (but I already like dandelions anyway).  Also, I cut the recipe to 3 servings but made a full batch of the dressing (because I can't exactly quarter an egg) I thought it was just right with the extra dressing for the portion size and will definitely make this again.
