This was very good for breakfast this morning.  Had all ingredients on hand except sausage called for. Used Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage instead. I've never heard of or seen the sausage listed.

This was a great breakfast recipe. I didn’t have bacon but I did have sausage and hash browns which contained bacon, onions, green pepper. Everything was tasty and delicious.

We loved this recipe.  It was easy to make and very tasty.  I especially loved the flavor of the sausage in the recipe.  I will add extra sausage and bacon the next time I make it.

This was amazing. I used Farmer John's maple sausage links instead of the sausage listed in this recipe. Any breakfast meat will do because the hash browns and onions at the bottom really set this dish apart. I love cooking then baking in a cast iron skillet. I will definitely make this again and again! Thank you for sharing.

I made it as written outside of the sausage. I didn't have any on hand so used extra bacon. We thought it was very good although I would use less garlic powder next time if any at all. Very good though.

I've been making a variation of this for several years as a no-carb or low-carb option for breakfast.  (Leave hash browns out or reduce amount to a 1" layer). Using an oven safe skillet, I put in a lot of veggies, including cauliflower, broccoli, peppers, mushrooms, kale, spinach, and onion. Sauté them until tender, mix in hashbrowns to slightly brown, add a good layer of cheese and cover with eggs. Any breakfast meat works great. Baking time is longer than noted in recipe, usually 20-25 min. at 325 F. Seasonings vary but our favorite is a Thai curry/cumin blend similar to cu-cu. Slices of tomato placed on top cook up nicely as well.

I added more milk, hash browns, and eggs to the recipe. I also added green peppers and my own preference of seasonings. The amount of cheese called for in the recipe was not enough, so I added double the cheese. Instead of just pouring the egg on top of the hash browns, I layered the ingredients in the pan: the hash brown mix (with onion, seasoning, and green peppers) first, then the egg mix (little bit of seasoning with the milk), then 2 cups of cheese, and lastly the bacon bits. I did this twice, then popped everything in the oven and garnished with the green onion after it was done. It came out much better than anticipated. Will make again!

Delicious! Used just bacon. I think next time I might saute the onions and add green pepper prior to the hashbrowns potatoes.

Made for Christmas morning first time and it was a hit. Only change I made was I put in a glass casserole dish and cooked in the oven for 30 min. Everyone loved it thanks for the recipe. Oh and couldn’t find the sausage it called for so used Jimmy Dean Maple flavor.

Definitely a keeper. Loved that you could make it and bake it the same day so you can do spur of the moment and not pre-plan for overnight. 
I get so annoyed when people change things - so here's what I changed:) 
Started with a glass pie plate,  put (I had leftover) 1/2 bag simply potato hashbrowns on the bottom, used reg onion (had no green), bread cubes were sourdough (again leftover), everything else the same - may have added more cheese on top.
Served to the mighty deer hunter and they loved it!

Would like this better if ingredients were more blended.  The layering prevented integration. Will also try adding more flavor to potatoes.  Will probably make again with changes.

Delicious. I used 6 sausage patties I had already in the freezer. Crumbled them. Also added onion and garlic to the hash browns  when frying. I had no bacon ,didn't need it. Sausage was lots. Fresh chives to the eggs and lots of paprika on top. Baked 20 min and it was perfect quantity of potato ,sausage and egg. . Topped with halved cherry tomatoes and more chives. Definitely a keeper .

I am without an oven now, but I keep looking for recipes for the time I can have a new range.  I am looking for breakfast and other recipes that are cooked in crockpots, microwaves, and on stovetop.  I did find a crockpot recipe for “CROCKPOT FRENCH TOAST”, but I misplaced my handwritten copy. I would try that one first.  My iPad does not have the capability to take and send photos, or, more likely, I do not know how.

I made this with sausage I had onhand and that certainly impacts the flavor. But the layering and instructions worked out pretty well. I used a glass 8x8 and probably baked for 23 mins so longer than the recipe but the eggs came out moist and everything worked out. Also used tot rounds which I prebaked as per their cooking instructions as the bottom layer. Potato potato right? All and all I am rating this on the seasoning and instructions which worked out well for me.

Not sure hash browns were the best choice or perhaps the directions for that part need work. I made it earlier in the day and reheated it for dinner. That may have contributed to me not caring for it. I made something similar with tater tots instead of hash browns and it was still excellent days later.

This recipe is very good as is. I did not have the sausage so I omitted it. Still the recipe came out excellent. Will make it again! Next, time I might bake it for a few minutes less or bake it covered to prevent over drying.

Worked well in a sheet pan.  Just adjust time a little more. Maybe add 4 minutes.
