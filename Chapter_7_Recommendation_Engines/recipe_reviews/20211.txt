This is sooo good! I, too, only added 1/2 c sugar. I never use half and half so I decided to use evaporated milk instead. I didn't want to waste the other 8 oz of evap milk so I just poured the 12 oz can into a 4 c measure and then filled with milk and heated it all. I didn't bother with adding some cold milk to the hot chocolate. Yum Yum, just what I wanted on a cool morning, thanks Jeanie Bean!

OMG - this is the best cocoa!!!  I made it as the recipe stated and it was overly sweet for my taste.  Then made it per the reviewers suggestions and it was much, much better!  Definitely decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup; your blood sugar levels will thank you!!!  Increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon and a note of caution - DO NOT use cheap vanilla as you can taste the difference between good vanilla and the inexpensive type sold in the supermarket.  You'll be glad you did...  Thanks Jeanie for submitting this great recipe!  Definitely a keeper!!!

I am sipping this cocoa as I type this review.  It is very very good!  Much better than any crud you get in the packets, you know that there aren't any dyes or anything artificial in this which is why I choose to hand-make our cocoa.  

I gave it a 5 star rating but it is  very, very sweet! And I have a sweet tooth!  ***AND*** I only used 1/2 C sugar.  I would definitey not use the 3/4 C, it will be too sickening sweet. 

To make it less sweet you could either decrease the sugar amount further or add more hot water, I suppose.

Overall great alternative to the store bought "stuff".

This cocoa was indeed creamy and tasty.  Although my family found it entirely too sweet.  The second time I made it I used a little less than 1/2 cup sugar and it was much better.

This recipe is from the Hershey's box with added sugar and half & half, that's all.  Ironically, most cut the sugar to the same measurement as Hershey's.  I must agree.  I added 1/4 c of malted milk but will go with 1/2 c next time.

Best hot chocolate I have made and I have made several listed on this site.  I did reduce the sugar but then turned around and added some Starbuck's mint syrup which is sweet.  Heavenly!  So rich it tastes like melted candy bars.  Very creamy! Mmmm....

pretty good, but very, very sweet. next time i'll add less sugar and maybe use unsweetened chocolate pieces instead of the cocoa powder.

I am in love with this recipe!! I tried another hot chocolate recipe from the website but it just didn't compare! Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!! I did revise it a little bit I added 1/2 tsp ginger and nutmeg to it plus added whipped cream and a dash of pumpkin spice on top. Perfect for a cold winter night!

Move over Swiss Miss! With each sip, I'm liking this hot cocoa recipe more and more. It is incredibly rich and creamy, and the taste is absolutely out of this world. The recipe is fairly simple, but a few tips can make it even simpler. To judge when the hot cocoa is ready to be removed from the heat, place your hand over the steam coming from the pot. If you cannont keep it there without feeling significant heat after 4 seconds, the cocoa is ready! If you do not want to divide the cocoa into four mugs, add the entire 1/2 cup of cream into the pot along with the vanilla, and portion as you please. Reduce the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup if you are looking for a bolder, more bitter flavor, but adding all 3/4 cup seems to make it just sweet enough. This recipe is absolutely perfect for the cold winter day! Three cheers for Jeanie!

I don't think I can ever go back to instant after this - satisfying enough to be a dessert on a snowy evening.  It is a little sweet - so try a 1/2 cup of sugar and add more to taste if necessary.  I didn't use the 1/2 and 1/2 and dunked plenty of marshmallows in it - makes 3 decent servings or 2 big servings in coffee mugs.  The four servings would be in little coffee cups and perhaps not quite enough on their own.  I also used 1% Lactaid, and it was still wonderful.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Easy to make for one! Need a 2c. mug, small whisk, 1T. and 1/8 tsp. measure, & microwave. Place 2T. water, 2 1/2 T. cocoa, 1T. sugar, and pinch of salt in bottom of mug. Stir with small whisk. Microwave 1 minute. Whisk in 1 1/2c. milk and microwave 2 1/2 minutes. For full-bodied taste stir in 1/8 t. vanilla, 1/8 t. almond extract, & 1T. half & half or whipping cream. Sprinkle top with cinnamon and stir. This gives you a tasty way to get 50% of your daily calcium and leaves hardly any dishes to wash!

Yummy! I made this while we had friends visiting. It was the perfect beverage to get the cold edge off. Very rich, but that's the way I like it! During the holiday season's it's nice with a candy cane.

WAY too sweet. 1/2 cup of sugar is just about right for most tastes (we like it with even about one Tb less than that.) A tiny pinch (whatever you can hold between your index finger and thumb only) of baking soda helps smooth out the acidity of the cocoa, if you're not using a Dutch process brand like Droste. The standard Hershey cocoa will benefit from that tiny addition.

We LOVE this hot cocoa.  Very rich and creamy...perfect for a cold winter day.  I do reduce the amount of sugar...3/4 cup is too much.  I actually put in about 1/4 cup, stir it into the chocolate mix and then taste it...I add more sugar to taste.  So I really don't know exactly how much sugar I use but I do know it is less than what is listed here.  Maybe more along the lines of 1/2 cup or a little less.

My kids and husband love this recipe.

As previous reviews suggested, I cut sugar down to ½ cup.  Perfect cup of creamy hot chocolate.  My entire family enjoyed it during these cold winter days in Texas. It's a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

WOW delicious!  Glad I followed the other reviewers' advice and only used 1/2 cup sugar- it was sweet enough.  I stirred 1/2 cup of Bailey's in with the milk and topped with some of that liquor whipped cream- a nice adult version of a childhood favorite! Yum :D

I didn't have whole milk, I had skim.  I think it would have been too rich with the whole milk anyway (for me at least!).  I only made one serving, so I did not follow the directions exactly.  I stirred up the dry ingredients in a mug, then whipped the hot water into it until well blended.  I then whipped the skim milk and half and half in.  Microwaved until hot and served with whipped cream (from a can).  YUMM!  A nice Sunday afternoon indulgence!

We don't keep half and half on hand but saw that another reviewer used evaporated milk instead. I had a can of that so I used the entire can and scaled the milk back by 1 cup. As others suggested, I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup. I made this because my son wanted something warm to soothe his sore throat. This did the trick! This made a generous amount of hot chocolate so the rest is in the crockpot on warm until needed.

There's nothing like a cup of homemade hot cocoa.  This is quite sweet, but I like my cocoa like that.  However, you may want to reduce the sugar if you put marshmallows in your cocoa.  The cream adds a nice richness.  Perfect for a chilly night.

This was great! I used organic cocoa and dehydrated cane sugar instead of white sugar to make it a little healthier. The kids and my husband loved it and I feel much better serving this then the store bought stuff. Thanks.

We just put up our tree today and looked in the cupboard to find out we were out of instant cocoa.  Found this recipe and it saved the day!  Delicious! We added a drop of cool whip and sprinkled cocoa on top. Thanks!

This had good flavor, but even only using 1/2 cup of sugar seemed too much - it was very sweet.  I also used evaporated milk as I did not have half and half on hand.

Not my favourtie, sorry.  My hot cocoa consists of warming milk on the stove and whisking in Nesquik so I thouht this would be way better but even the kids agreed that our tried and true easy method is better!  I didn't care for the bitter cocoa after taste.

Wow, what a tasty, chocolatey treat. My husband loved this homemade version. A little on the rich side.  I thinned the chocolate out with some cream and it was still wonderful.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  I am sipping it, while I type this review!  This has a wonderful, creamy flavor.  I did REDUCE THE SUGAR and per other reviewers advice, used half a cup of sugar.  Other that that, I followed the directions exactly as written, and did not change anything else.

One thing I would recommend is DO NOT ADD THE CREAM TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MUG.  When I poured the hot chocolate into the mug with the cream, it was not even lukewarm! That was due to the cream, being in the mug already!  Add the cream AFTER you pour your hot chocolate, not before.  

Also (and this is just my personal preference), I did use all organic ingredients.

In the directions where you add milk and then heat UNTIL HOT, I would HIGLY RECOMMEND at this point, BRINGING IT TO A GENTLE BOIL and immediately remove from heat. THEN, pour in your cream.   

FIVE STARS!  Love this!  Jeanie Bean, thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  It's a keeper.

I used Lake Champlain cocoa, a high quality cocoa, and it made a delicious hot cocoa drink.  This recipe makes a classic cocoa that is perfect on a chilly day.  Because I used 1% milk, the next time I will use heavy cream instead of the half and half for a creamier taste.

Wonderful hot chocolate.  Whatever you do, do not reduce the amount of sugar or you will ruin it.  It makes 4 servings, afterall, and you can never call this too sweet.  Sure warms up the tummy on a cold night.

This hot cocoa is way too sweet. It's essentially diabetes in a cup. The recipe has all the right stuff just too much of it. Decrease the sugar by at least 1/3.

Was very creamy (which was nice). But WAY too sweet. I would not recommend giving this to children. They will be bouncing off the walls. Not sure how much but the sugar needs to be cut back.

Very good, just a few days ago I had made a delicous hot cocoa and this one tasted the excact same. My finishing result looked and tasted like what I was expecting. This time, I used sweetened cocoa powder (because I didn't have any unsweetened), so I just reduced the sugar amount and it was just fine.

This recipe is fantastic but I alter it slightly. It's a bit sweeter than I would like so I cut out some sugar and I don't add the vanilla- I think it takes away from the flavor. I also like my hot cocoa to be a bit thick so I add either some flour or cornstarch to achieve that texture.

Excellent!  I've never made hot cocoa from scratch and it was incredibly easy and delicious. It was a tad too sweet for my tastes - and I love sweet stuff so next time I'll cut back a little bit.  I'm never buying powdered stuff again!

This is delicious hot cocoa but a little too sweet for my tastes.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup like other reviewers did but still found it too sweet.  Next time I'll use 1/3 cup and see if that's perfect.  Topped with whipped cream this made a wonderful warm drink.

Amazing! Perfectly sweet, not too rich or creamy, but just enough for you to sip away your worries. I didn't have any half and half on hand, so I diluted whole milk and that worked fine. The family loves this, and it's a must for holiday - or cold - get togethers.

Waaaay too sweet. Otherwise good. I would try 1/2 c. sugar to start and go from there. No wonder us Americans are getting fat. Really, in Europe the hot chocolate is not anywhere near this sweet, and I think it is better that way. The pastries are not as sweet either.

This is so much better than the stuff that comes in a packet. I added a dash of cinnamon and cayenne pepper for an extra kick.

excellent recipe.  the technique of wisking the cocoa powder and sugar with the water first ensures the cocoa is smooth and creamy.  yum!

This was amazing! The first time I made it I use all evaporated milk and it was too rich.The second time I used 1-12 ounce can of evaporated milk then enough skim milk to equal 3 1/2 cups and I ommitted the cream. Sooo creamy!

This is easy to whip up after coming in from sledding.  Ingredients are on hand and it is sooooo delicious.  Creamy and rich.  I usually leave out the cream at the end and add water instead.  It's still so rich.

When temperatures drop from 80 to 25 overnight, you need a great hot cocoa recipe! I made the cocoa for some guests, and they loved it! If you use marshmallow's, 1/2 cup sugar is perfect, but if not, 3/4 cup of sugar works best. I did add 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips. I will definitely use this recipe again! **Made this again...to celebrate the putting up of our christmas tree:) I was out of milk, so I used a mixture of 1/2 & 1/2 and evaporated milk. I had some homemade caramel, so I added just a bit to the cocoa. We had toppings of marshmallows, crushed original andes mints and crushed candy cane andes mints. Again, this was a hit!

This was WONDERFUL!!!  We only use half of the sugar, but otherwise it is perfect.  I usually make a double batch because it goes so quickly in my house.  Sometimes we also add 1/8 tsp of peppermint extract to the whole batch at the very end prior to serving.  My kids LOVE this cocoa!

The recipe as is, like others have mentioned, is too sweet.  A half cup of sugar is perfect.  Otherwise, this is a really great hot cocoa recipe.

Not bad.... While I enjoyed this, I prefer Verushka's candy cane cocoa just a smidgin more (I LOOOVE anything minty). What I did like aobut this was the addition of half-and-half cream. I like my cocoa lukewarm. Adding chilled half-half cooled it down to a perfect drinkable temperature! My only issue with this is how sweet it was (but that's an easy fix). I will definitely make this again, but will be SURE to decrease the amount of sugar (or use all sugar substitute or a combination of sugar / substitute instead). NOTE: This recipe will give you 4 VERY small cups of cocoa. If you use large mugs like I do, you'll find that this yields more like 2 servings worth. I halved this (just making a cup for myself) and it filled my large mug with about 1/4 c. leftover. Topped with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles. Thanks for sharing, Jeanie Bean! This was a great way to warm up on this chilly Midwest afternoon! :-)

I tried out this recipe just last night and I loved it! I followed the suggestions and lowered the amount of sugar from 3/4 cup to 1/2 cup, and I was glad I did. The sweetness was just right with only 1/2 cup. I also tweaked the recipe a bit more. I lowered the amount of milk to 3 cups and added in the 1/2 cup half and half while the the hot cocoa was still in the saucepan. I also added the vanilla in while it was still in the saucepan. And also, what I found is that once I was done combining everything that it wasn't hot enough for my liking. So I just let it warm up for a bit while stirring occasionally and it turned out perfect! Also tastes wonderful with a bit of whipped cream added on top.

Very yummy! I halved the recipe since it was just for my husband and I. I didn't bother added in the two extra tbs of sugar the recipe called for and I'm glad because it is sweet. The second time I made this I did the same thing but added in 1/4 more light cream and it was even better. I will never buy Swiss mix again, lol! Ps- For the adults..Don't be afraid to add in a little raspberry liqueur or amaretto! ;)

I always add equal amounts of cocoa and sugar, it's never too sweet. No salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla. And cut down on the boiling water or it can make the finished product too watery. I've never used half and half, but whipped cream tastes great!

Excellent - modified.  Per large mug, add 1 cup 2% milk, 3 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa, 1.5 Tbsp sugar, dash salt, 3 Tbsp boiling water. Follow directions as noted.  Top with whipped cream & tiny semi-sweet morsels.  Decadent.  Richer than original recipe, and not overly sweet. No need to add half and half.

I reduced the sugar, per other reviewers' suggestions. What a silly mistake. It was so bitter, I couldn't even drink it. Apparently, I am the only person in the universe with a sweet tooth. So I added more sugar to my mug until it was palatable. Still not very good. It was drinkable, but not for me. Didn't even finish it. I'd rather the packets than this. I'll keep looking for a worthy homemade hot cocoa recipe. Sorry.

It's a great recipe but it was too sweet. I used 1/4 cup of white sugar instead of 3/4 cup. It turned out great!

I was craving hot chocolate and this hit the spot!  Delicious!  After reading the other reviews, I did reduce the sugar to 1/2C and I added heavy whipping cream rather than half and half because that is what I had.  I shared some with my husband and he keeps complimenting the hot chocolate with every sip saying, "this is really good, honey."  A definite keeper!

This is too sweet. I wish it was more cocoa-ey and less sugary. it was easy to make. Maybe it was too sweet because I didn't put in 1/2 & 1/2...

Fantastic!  I've used vanilla beans and cut them open and steeped them in my milk while its warming.  FREAKING AWESOME!  I also add half a coffee cup of this chocolate and then fill the rest with coffee.  DECADENT!

The best hot cocoa my family and I ever had!  Even with skim milk, it still tasted creamy.  We add the fat free cool whip to cool the hot cocoa!

I eliminated the half and half (didn't have any) and vanilla so really just used the cocoa, sugar and salt with milk.  Followed suggestions and used 1/2 a cup.  Yummy!

5 stars if you adjust the sugar.  I reduced to 1/2 cup and it was still too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will try 1/3 cup.  I can't imagine putting in the whole amount.

Agreed--it's too sweet.  I am also looking for hot chocolate that's a bit thicker.  Not pea-soup thick, mind you, but certainly thicker than water.  Good, but not great.

Yummy, rich and chocolatey! I took other reviewers' advice and started with 1/3 cup sugar and added more to taste. I also added 2 packets of splenda to save some calories.

I thought that this was wonderful, and my two year old loved it! I used skim milk in this recipe but followed everything else to a T. I personally didn't think that this recipe was too chocolatie. Powdered store mixes are too watery, and Starbucks hot chocolate has an overpowering chocolate flavor for me. I am not a dark chocolate lover and that might have been why this didn't taste too sweet for me.

I took the advice of others and cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and am glad I did. It was perfect!  I forgot to add the vanilla extract but it was good without it. I'm going to try it with peppermint extract next time. Thanks!

The snow has finally arrived, so I have decided to take it upon myself to find the most delicious and decedent hot chocolate recipe on the web.  I adore hot chocolate and really don’t need any excuse to drink it…   This recipe  was made of pretty basic pantry ingredients which I liked!  The taste was not quite as creamy as I expected, it’s very sweet.  So unless you have a sweet tooth you may want to cut down on the sugar.  It’s a pretty good starting point but the search  much go on!!!

Wow..Didn't seem like anything special at first, but my husband was licking the rim of his mug and asking for more! I followed the other recommendations and lowered the sugar and it was still on the sweet side...Keep this in mind, especially if you plan on adding marshmallows of whipped topping! YUM!

Made this with 1/2c sugar at the suggestion of previous reviewers.  I also left out the half & half at the end, I just served it like it came out of the pan!  ABSOLUTELY perfect for a cold evening, now hubby wants some every night!  Thanks for the recipe.

I agree with the rest of the reviewers; 3/4ths a cup of white sugar is too much unless you have a severe sweet tooth. I lowered it to 1/2 a cup, and it has a better, more fulfilling chocolate taste. Also, for a bit of fun, adult flavor, I added half a teaspoon of Kahlua, and I topped it with a large dollop of whipped cream and sprinkled semi-sweet chocolate morsels over the whipped cream.  However, overall, the recipe is very competent, and I found it easy to follow and resulting in a pleasing, warm cocoa!  Bravo!

Very easy and delicious hot cocoa, from now on I'll make this and NOT buy it premade. Slight changes I made: Less sugar (half a cup instead of 2/3), and a bit more milk (4 cups instead of 3 1/2 cup).

I've done this recipe a few times now. The first few I've done it just as it's written, and the latest i've reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. Both have been well received and were quite yummy!   Just reduce if you're not into sweet cocoa.

This turned out much tastier than I was expecting.  I scaled it down to 1 serving and used only 1/2 tbs. sugar.  Insteady of whipping cream, I used flavored coffee creamer and it was delicious.

Fantastic!  So rich!  I made this with 1/2 C white sugar, which was more than enough.  The 3/4 C white sugar called for in the recipe would be far too sweet.  I used skim milk, and I substituted the half-and-half with heavy cream because it is all I had on hand.  Wonderful!

My hubby just came in to warm up after shovelling snow for hours and was he ever appreciative of the lovely hot cocoa I just made.  As suggested by others, I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I'll be making this again for sure...probably this afternoon after our next bout of dealing with this snowstorm.

Absolutely excellent.  I am a chocolate lover, so I decreased the milk by 1/2 cup since it was the first time I tried it.  It was VERY rich.  Next time I will just go by the recipe which I think will be perfect!

Soooo yummy! I made this for my little guy and I and poured the cocoa mixture into the cups first, then whisked in the water, then the heated milk to cut down on the stove production process. I scaled the recipe down to 2 and used only 2 tbsp. sugar  and 1 cup milk in each mug. Completely forgot the vanilla and didn't have the cream, I can't imagine how good it tastes with those because as it was it was the best hot chocolate I've ever had!

yummy & easy!  what more could you want?  I did cut the sugar down by 1/3, though--tried it with the full amount specified and it was MUCH too sweet.

This was really really good! Becca made it the way we usually do, mix the cocoa, sugar and salt in a small bowl with a whisk before adding to the boiling water. Add a pinch of cinnamon and... Voila! The best hot cocoa you`ve ever tasted!

Good, but I agree with other reviewers that it was a little too sweet. I didn't think I would ever say that about hot cocoa, because usually the sweeter the better with me. I do like that she made sure to list out the steps of mixing the chocolate and suger with the boiling water b/c that really helps get the powdery taste out.

Extremely rich and sweet but very delicious.  My husband thought it should be served in little espresso glasses.  I didn't change the recipe at all. If you like thick rich creamy hot chocolate then look no further.

Tasted like I was drinking syrup. It was not edible and I had to dump it all out. If I were to give it another shot, I would use 1/3 the amount of sugar.

Too sweet!  I only put in a half a cup because that sounded like a lot.  Then I added more milk... a lot more milk.  Still could barely drink it!  Maybe you should start out with a quarter cup sugar and go from there?

This was a big hit in my family. It's much better than the premade kind, and it's very easy as well. Like many others, this was far too much sugar for my taste, so I reduced it, but other than that I quite liked this recipe, and I'm sure I will be making it often in the future.

This recipe is spectacular!  I read the other reviewers suggestions and reduced the sugar to a 1/2 cup and increased the vanilla to 1 tsp.  I used my good vanilla and boy was it delicious!  Made a pot of this one morning for the kiddos and I, and we all loved it!  This is a keeper for sure!  A MILLION times better than Swiss Miss.

Just phenomenal -- I made it just as it was written and it was wonderful.  For the ultimate experience, don't skip the cream  or half and half (I used straight up whipping cream in liquid form) at the end!

Way...way too sweet!  Loved the chocolate flavor, but the sweetness along with the 1/2 & 1/2 had me laying down for a while for the sickness to pass.  Next time I will cut down on the sugar eliminate to 1/2 & 1/2 and maybe add a little almond flavoring along with the vanilla.

Excellent in small batches--settles when made in large batches.  We prepared a quadruple batch for our daughter's January birthday party.  It was very rich and chocolaty!  Those who love sweet drinks will be pleased.  Those who prefer things a bit less sugary will likely prefer a version with reduced sugar.  By the time the drink cools from hot to lukewarm, though, a lot of the sugar and chocolate have settled to the bottom of the cup, making those last few sips SO sweet and rich that it's almost hard to swallow.  If you can drink it hot or don't mind stirring as you sip, this is a delicious recipe.  For those without a sweet tooth or those looking for something to make in large batches and serve over the course of a party (during which the stuff is settling in the pot), I'd suggest trying another recipe or reducing the sugar.

During our last midwest snow storm, my husband turned to me and said "hot chocolate would be so good right now!"  I agreed with him immediately, but knew I didn't have any packets or chocolate syrup.  However, I just knew that my trusty ol' allrecipes.com wouldn't let me down!  This recipe was a cinch to throw together and is so good that I have been informed I'm no longer allowed to make hot chocolate any other way.  On the second batch, we had quite a bit left over and I was curious to see what would happen when it was refrigerated.  So I poured it into a lidded mason jar and stashed it.  The next day, it made incredibly delicious chocolate milk.  The flavor is quite concentrated, so we cut it about 50/50 with milk.  Very, very good!  I haven't tried yet, but I'm sure it could be reheated in a mug in the microwave to enjoy a second round of hot chocolate.  Wonderful recipe Jeanie!

DEEEEElicious.  Didn't bother with the half-&-half at the end, as the chocolate didn't need further diluting.  Made a "cocoa bar" with crushed peppermint, whipped cream, chocolate chips, & cinnamon -- kids had a fun time choosing their toppings for this wonderful cocoa!

I made this for my son's December (in Northern Europe) outdoor birthday party.  The kids LOVED it!  I made it exactly as written (other than increasing the servings to 20) and served it with marshmallows.  Would be wonderful with whipped cream too.  Perfect for kids coming in from the cold!

It wasn't the best cocoa i have ever had but it wasn't the worst either. I am still looking for that cocoa that tastes so rich and creamy that it really is a decadant treat. This wasn't that good. In fact, it isn't much different than the recipe on the side of the hershey's unsweetened cocoa. As I said it is good but not great.

I combine the cocoa, sugar and salt, store it in an air tight container and use it as ready serve cocoa drink powder. I warm 1 cup of milk add a heaping dessert spoon of the cocoa mix for my kids every morning. If you are using cold milk, pour a teeny bit of milk into the bottom of the glass, add the powder and stir until it makes a syrup, then add the rest of your milk or else the cocoa powder won't mix in.

My kids love this.  We use all nonfat milk and add all 4 cups and heat.  The kids add a touch of cold milk to cool off.  This makes it not so rich.

This was an excellent recipe! It's truly the best hot chocolate I've had in a long, long time. But I can't bring myself to give this five stars-there's always room to improve. Although I'm not really sure where that is with this recipe... four stars!

This was very good, but I did take the advice of everyone else; definitely no more than 1/2 cup sugar. I could even do less, and I love sweet things. I even forgot to put the vanilla in at the end, but still delicious and very rich!

good hot cocoa, brother really likes it.  was out of milk so I had to use dry milk powder and water.  I think it tasted too dry milk-y, but that is my problem. ********* made again with real milk, and tastes ALOT better.

I made this using a mix of heavy cream and 1% milk. But the best change was the cayenne. While cooking the cocoa and sugar, I sprinkled about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne into that syrup. Perfectly rich cocoa with a zingy bite that lingers on the tongue after swallowing. That's probably why I didn't mind the amount of sugar as shown.

WOW this is awesome! I'm sipping some right now as I review this recipe. Used only 1/2 cup sugar, dark chocolate cocoa and instead of vanilla I used flavored half & half.  I topped it with frozen whipped cream.  My picky son loved it and my 7 year old neighbor said it was the best hot cocoa he ever had.  Thank you I will be using this again and again!

This hit the spot on a cold winter night!  I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup as suggested by others, and it was the perfect amount.  I didn't have any half-and-half, but I did have some heavy cream, which I used with milk instead.  The kids really enjoyed this, topped with a nice mound of whipped cream.  Thanks!

I was out of instant powder, but had cocoa on hand.  Tried this recipe and it is GREAT!  I only wanted 1/4 batch and love how the site changed the measurements for me.  Made it with my 2 year old and she loves it, too.  I didn't have half and half, but just added a bit more milk and it turned out fine.  I will never use the instant stuff again!!!!

Warning: VERY addictive! Delicious! Also, a bit fattening if you do use the half and half and the whipped creams!

It has been such a huge hit in my home! I have never had so many hot drinks than since I found this recipe! Plus everyone I make it for asks for more! Loved by everyone! MMmmmm!!!

This really was yummy.  There is no reason to use those fake packets from the store when this is so easy and tasty.  Following other reviewers' recommendations, sugar was decreased by 1/2.  It was amazingly good - reminded me of dark chocolate.  Those who like extra sweetener can easily add marshmallows or sweetened whipped cream.  Our group of carolers demolished it!  Now a family favorite!

12/23/18 - This is still our family's favorite recipe. :)

this is the Best recipe ever! I did only put 1/2 cup of sugar and instead of using half and half I used whipping cream which made it so velvety and a little thicker which I LOVE! Thanks for the recipe! I am gonna make a huge batch for the neighborhood party!

This is exactly how my mother (a depression era baby)  taught me to make cocoa.  We just eyeballed it and made single servings so it's nice to have measurements.   She did exactly the same thing -with vanilla and a pinch of salt.  How charming to see this here.  Thank you!

I did quite a few things differently; first, i only used about 3 cups of milk, no evaporated milk, and a little less than the recommended amount of sugar. Then, i topped it with whipped cream! But, it was still DELICIOUS! The only downside: it burned my mouth because I was SO eager to drink it!

This is the cocoa my mom made, only she used all milk instead of half and half, and way less sugar. Your cocoa and sugar amounts should be the same.

DELICIOUS!!! I will never use powdered cocoa again! Like other reviewers I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and instead of the 3 1/2 cups of milk I used a can of evaporated milk. WOWOWOW!!! So rich and creamy! No need for half-and-half, just add milk to tame the flavor ;)

Definitely super-rich. Use only half the sugar and keep away from whole milk (the half and half will make it plenty rich); skim or 1% works best unless you want to feel like you're drinking a chocolate milkshake!

I usually make recipes as they are written to begin with, but we only had certain things on hnand!  I did reduce the sugar down to 1/2 cup and I am SO glad that I did!  It was almost too sweet at 1/2 cup.  I didn't have half and half, so I just used more skim milk.  Delish!  Just wish I had marshmallows :)

This is wonderful - the 1/2 & 1/2 makes it creamy.
It is so refreshing - I only added 1/2 cup sugar but I think 3/4 cup would NOT have been too sweet.

I just made this for a little pick-me up for NaNoWriMo. It's really good, but I took the advice of most reviews and decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup. I also did not add the half and half, because we don't have any and it already has a lot of milk. It still tastes great, and my Dad and little brother really liked it. I will definitely be making this again.

mmm.. even better and creamier if you add three or four marshmallows to the mix and let them melt while cooking.. gives it a heartwarming taste of winter and warmness! I used cocoa powder and choceur chocolate milk mix insted of adding sugar. tasted awesome!

Seriously the best cup of hot chocolate I've ever had!  Like the other reviews, I reduced the sugar by about a 1/3 and rather than the vanilla and half-and-half, I switched it for my favorite creamer (peppermint mocha).  Perfect for a cool evening!

My sons LOVE this cocoa.  I use really good cocoa powder and follow the recipe as written. So much better than anything you could buy in a package.  A regular in our household.

I served this to my three boys as well as some neighborhood girls and they loved it! A very quick and simple recipe. I agree with the other reviewers and will cut down on the sugar. I didn't have heavy cream so I added 1/3 cup of non-dairy creamer while heating the milk and it turned out chocolately and creamy. Pretty sure this will be a regular request around here.

This is very similar to the Hershey's cocoa recipe, but then again it takes the same few ingredients to make a basic hot chocolate. It is a very classic version and I didn't find it any creamier than any other hot chocolate. Just by looking at the sugar amount though, and based on what others said, I knew it was way too much. I cut the amount of sugar in the recipe, by half, and it was still plenty sweet. Although, I found it very basic garnishes can be added and it can easily be lightened up with low fat dairy products and diabetic sweeteners to taste. I have done both with no problem.

It was very good. Like others have said. Its not to sweet and not to dull. Very good. I would like to say that It does make enough for 4 people. (medium sized mugs of course) Its good for Diabetics to. Just don't drink to much at first, it my play with your numbers. ( I'm diabetic by the way)

I typically just use milk instead of half-and-half and it tastes just as good. I love this recipe, it's simple and easy, but it's soo good, like it comes from an expensive coffee shop.

Delicious chocolate milk! FYI, the cream doesn't really cool down the chocolate milk very much, so don't overheat your milk (like me) in anticipation of the cream cooling it down.

This was good, but it was way way too sweet. I did less than half the sugar and it was still too sweet, however this was a great base recipe. I replaced the half and half with So Delicious unsweetened coconut milk, delicious!

TOO RICH! This seemed too rich for out taste. I changed the measurements to 1/4 cocoa and 1/2 cup sugar. It was very good with those changes. I looked at other recipes on-line after that and most of them had the same measurements I had changed this recipe to.

Absolutely amazing.  I've never tasted hot cocoa that was so rich and delicious.  I only had full-milk whipping cream, which added to the calorie content for sure, but it was worth it!  A very special treat I know I'll be adding to my Christmas Eve traditions with my family!

4.5 stars...i see several reviewers who think it is too sweet at 3/4 c sugar and i agree, but 1/2 wasn't enough so i did 2/3 and that works well for our tastes.  thanks for this recipe!

Yum!  I was out of the packets - and now I'll never buy them again!  This was so much better, and very comforting after coming in from playing in the snow.  I didn't have any half and half, so I just used all milk and didn't heat it too hot, then served with whipped cream on top.

I made this with the kids when we had a day in, and it is wonderful! There definitely is too much sugar, its unnecessarily sweet and when we were making it we were amazed at the coca to sugar ratio. Needless to say, it was great, I doubled the recipe the second time because it didn't make 4 mugs of coca the first time. Great recipe though, thanks!

I almost committed the horrible offense of not having any hot chocolate on a snowy winter day.  Wow,who knew you could actually make it from scratch vs. a little packet?!  My kids LOVED LOVED LOVED it!  They said that it was way better than the "other stuff".  Super easy to make.  I thought it was a little sweet but the kids raved about it.

DO NOT listen to other reviewers!  If you only add a 1/2 C sugar this will be terrible!!!!!  I am a hot cocoa addict and a chocoholic and I couldn't get past 3 sips!  Bitter.  I did not scorch it either.  You MUST use the full amount of sugar called for, but even then, its not great.

I'll never go back to mix again. This recipe is amazing. I have used half and half, none at all, or evaporated milk and every version is simply amazing. I love to add cinnamon at the very end for some flavor. Like other reviewers this is a sweet hot cocoa and going down to 1/2 cup sugar won't hurt at all. The first time I made it I used 5 cups of milk with the 3/4 c sugar and it was still sweet, but still simply the best ever.

YUMMY!!  Made this as a treat for my family and my mother was like - This is really good, what is different in this?  I didn't have any 1/2 and 1/2, but I had heavy cream, which worked too, didn't use as much.  Will be making this several time this winter!  Also was good with some bailey's and vanilla rum in it!!

This was a great treat for my kids after a cold rainy walk home from school.  I substituted International Delight's Chocolate Mint Truffle creamer for the half and half.  It was a hit!  Apparently I'm the best mommy in the world.

Yum! I added the milk and half and half at the same time. Otherwise the marshmallows I use as garnish don't melt around the edges. In addition to the vanilla, I added a dash of Kahlua. Perfectly delicious.

OMG THIS IS SO GOOD! Best hot chocolate I have ever made. I added 1/2 teas. cinnamon to spice it up a bit and it was fantastic. Also followed other reviewers suggestions and only added a little less than 1/2c. of sugar. Topped off with some whip cream and movie night got that much better. Thanks!

Deep, rich, chocolatey flavor.  Don't know if my kids will drink the packets from the store after having this.  Topped with whipped cream and grated chocolate.

I eyeballed the sugar and used heavy whipping cream in place of half and half because I had it on hand and it turned out great!

I made this recipe and it was gone in an instant. Everyone had at least a second helping. But, next time I would go a little less on the vanilla.

I cut this recipe for 2 people.  Because of the dark chocolate cocoa I used I did use all of the sugar called for in the recipe.  It's pretty good, not the best cocoa I ever had, but not bad.  I did not add the cream at the end.

This is a really good recipe though you do have to bit of work to get it perfect. The first time I tried it I followed the recipe exactly and I used Hershey’s cocoa powder and the chocolate flavor was "ok". The next time I used high quality (French) Valrhona Cocoa Powder and 1/3 cup was way too strong. Today I made it with half the normal amount of Valrhona cocoa powder (1/6 cup) and it was wonderfully celestial. With 1/6 cup Valrhona the flavor was well balanced with the other ingredients yet it was a lot more complex than just using 1/3 cup of the Hersheys.  Another area I had to make some changes was the amount of sugar; waaayyy to sweet with ¾ cup white sugar. Instead I used ½ cup of freshly ground raw Mexican sugar (piloncillo) and it was perfect (and the raw sugar gives a nice “hint of caramel” taste). Also to add a slight twist I used ¼ teaspoon of fresh ground real cinnamon.  With these changes the recipe turned from a good hot cocoa recipe to an outstandingly complex yet balanced and not too rich cocoa, I’d be willing to pay good money for. Too bad Starbucks doesn’t sell this kind of quality hot cocoa.  Variants; 1/6 cup Valrhona Cocoa powder  	½ cup raw (piloncillo) sugar  	optional = ¼ tsp fresh cinnamon  	everything else the same

I halved the sugar and added 2 tablespoons Frangelico (hazelnut liqueur) per cup just before serving.  The chocolate-hazelnut combination is outstanding!  I substituted the cream for more milk to reduce fat content.  It is still very creamy.

I made this on a very rare freezing day in Florida..I always practice on my kids & we loved this! I read other reviews, so I only put in a 1/2 cup of sugar. This was the perfect amount. After adding the half & half & the whipped topping, because I had no marshmallows, it was perfectly sweetened. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us....

Very rich and creamy. I will agree with others it was too sweet. I would use less sugar if I made it again. I added some irish creme creamer to my cup and it was wonderful.

Thought this was a little time consuming. Was only ok for me though, found it tasted like store bought and if you don't drink it all right away, when it gets a little cool it feels a little gritty.

This is a keeper!  Like others, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and only had skim milk on hand.  For simplicity, I  used 1 tsp of vanilla instead of 3/4 tsp.  Hubby used 1/2 & 1/2 while I went without.  Both were delicious. Thanks!

This was the best hot chocolate ever. I've never made it from scratch just the packets and I've got to say it does not even compare. YUM!   I would definitely use less sugar, about 1/2 C next time, and I used Dark Chocolate cocoa because it's what was in the house.   Then topped off with a little whip cream of course. I plan on making a lot of this stuff over the winter. =)

Yum!  Here's how to do it easily in the microwave: In a 4 cup Pyrex measuring cup, put your cocoa (I used a rounded 1/3 c), sugar (I used a rounded 1/3 c), salt, and cold water. Mix with spoon. (It will be quite lumpy).  Microwave  for about 2 minutes, stopping to stir several times.   Microwave more if needed, but keep stirring several times until this syrup is fairly lump-free. Add the vanilla and the milk.  Continue microwaving and stirring a bit until this is hot and creamy (about 5 minutes.)  Pour into mugs and top with 1/ & 1/2 as directed or use whipped cream.  Sooo yummy!!!

This is pretty good. It is way to sweet as others have stated, and I only used 1/3 cup of sugar. It might have been b/c I used sweetened cond. milk, and while it was coming to temp, I added a few Hershey kisses to it...lol..Next time I make it I wont add any sugar to it. Other than that it was really good.

I just have to say that this is yummy.  I only made one change, and that was to skip the half and half, only because I didn't have any.  Next time I make it, I will be sure to have some on hand.

This hot chocolate recipe is amazing! :) I did not know that hot chocolate could taste so great by making it yourself in your home. Adding Toroni flavorings in this cocoa would be a great way to spice it up!

I second the previous reviews. Cut the sugar by a half at least! You can always add more later. This worked great with Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder. I also whipped heavy cream, with vanilla and a bit of sugar, to top the cocoa with, instead of blending half-and-half right in. 'Course both would be good too...  :)

Seriously delicious.  The better quality the vanilla, the better the flavor.  My girls are crazy for sugar (and it is sweeter and creamier than other recipes), but we drink this in demitasse cups (for espresso) and it's just a nice little treat.  I would imagine this would also hold up nicely to peppermint schnapps.

Quick and delicious!  Perfect compliment to decorating the Christmas tree.  Like everyone else, I used 1/2 c. sugar.  Will make from now on instead of buying!

This is just about the perfect hot chocolate on a cold day.  We always have to make it when watching Polar Express.  I never have half and half in the house, so I always just use a little more milk to cool it down.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, as on the orginal Hershey's recipe to make this enjoyable (and that was with dark chocolate cocoa...couldn't imagine how sweet it would be with regular cocoa).  The half and half made it smooth like a coffee house's recipe.  I enjoyed this, but you need to cut the sugar;  Plus, it wasn't her recipe thus the rating.

This was very yummy.  I wound up using fat free milk and adding just a little bit of whole milk to get it creamier instead of the half and half.  I've made it twice.  Once I made it with the lower amount of sugar like others said.  And the other time, I did that amount with half Splenda and half sugar.  Tasted the same to me.  And hubby didn't complain which means it's the same to him.  I'd absolutely make this again, just use the substitutes to lower the calories on it.

The first time I made this hot chocolate, I totally forgot to add vanilla extract and I also simply run out of half-and-half cream, but still it turned out to be the best home-made hot chocolate ever.

I made enough for just little old me and it was delicious! It is a bit on the sweet side as some other viewers noted, but i loved it!! I used evaporated milk as I did not have half/half but it is still a 5 star recipe in my eyes! Bravo!

Really delicious hot chocolate!  I don't think I'll ever try another recipe. I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and skipped the half and half, I just used 4 cups whole milk.  I put a dollop of cool whip and used the fine side of a cheese grater to grate some milk chocolate on top.  My kids were delighted!!

My dad and I couldn't stop saying YUM while drinking this!!! I LOVE hot cocoa and trying new recipes... this is my new favorite! I didn't even use the half and half at the end either. I love how rich and chocolatey the taste is, even with 2% milk. Thank you:)

This is the best regular hot cocoa recipe I have found on here! It is great if you have a bit less sugar. I just modify it to my own taste, the first time it was too sweet, so this time I added about 1/3 C sugar because I added some Coffeemate vanilla to it later on! YUMMY! I also add some cinnamon or chili powder (not too much or it will be wayyy too spicy), for a different twist. I wouldn't add the salt, as I see no need for it. It is delicious no matter what you put in it!

SO YUMMY! Didn't change a thing. Rich, Thick and Creamy. Thanks for the keeper!
*** Just wanted to add that after drinking it took my son hours to go to sleep.  I definitly will give it to him next time before asking him to do some chores.

Oh, yum-yum-yum!!  I used to swear by homemade mixes but not any more!  It was so rich and chocolatey and a perfect way to come in from playing in the snow.  I didn't have half and half on hand but would love to try the recipe as written.  Did I say yum?

This is absolutely the best hot chocolate recipe that I have made.  The only thing I would change is to lessen the sugar content from 3/4 Cp. to 1/2 Cp. or less.  Very smooth!

this hot chocolate rocks! i made it when i had a hot chocolate craving while studying for final exams. It was quite time-consuming for a single cup of hot chocolate, but it turned out great. I think i'll combine all the dry ingredients ahead of time and then scoop out a few spoons and add hot milk + water to make the process faster. I reduced the sugar, used milk instead of cream and neglected the vanilla. Still turned out excellent!

Great cup of hot cocoa. I replaced the milk and cream with So Delicious  Dairy Free Coconut Beverage.
Thanks for the recipe.
Update.. I found the amount of sugar to sweet for me. Next time I will add some and taste until I find the right amount.

Thank you Jeanie Beane.  We will never need to buy Quik again.  This was a deliciously sweet mix.   We did add more cocoa powder, because we were trying to mimic Quik.  Thank you for sharing!

Awesome hot chocolate! It's just great, with the right amount of cocoa powder-not too dark and not too light. The only thing that I always add to this recipe is a couple of scoops of Nutella with the cocoa powder which takes this recipe to the next level

I didn't add anything, I only cut down the sugar from 3/4ths of a cup to 1/4th and it turned out great! I also used Dark Chocolate Cocoa Powder but I doubt that affects much. Really simple recipe, looking forward to making it again.

This is the best homemade hot cocoa I have ever tasted! My family thinks it tastes just like Swiss Miss, with  just a little more chocolate flavor. I served it with Cool Whip on top, when it melted, it tasted like marshmallows. Five Stars for sure!

I have used 1/2 cup suger and added cinnamon to the receipe. It came out great. I didnt have cream at the moment so i used 3 cups of milk instead so that the texture is still thick and creamy without the cream. It was amazing.

Delicious but modified as others did. I reduced sugar to 1/2 cup and combined 1/3 C evaporated milk with 2 1/2 C milk; also reduced half and half to 1/3 C. Topped it off with whipped cream.

This is soo yummy! I love my Starbucks hot chocolate but this recipe is just as good!! I cut the recipe in half and reduced the sugar to just a 1/4 cup & it was plenty sweet enough. I also just added marshmallows instead of the cream.

My family didn't "love" this recipe, but I made some changes based on other reviews and what I had on hand. I lowered the sugar to half a cup and it was still very sweet. I used almond milk in place of the regular milk and evaporated milk in lieu of the heavy cream because they are what I had on hand. I also added about a cup of strong black coffee (this was only made for adults) to help cut the sweetness.  Overall it's a great basic recipe that is easy to make and customize for particular tastes, etc. I'll definitely make this again during the holiday season. I'll be adding cinnamon and peppermint to the recipe because that's how I like it.

I came across this recipe in search of chocolate, and since it has been cool lately I thought I would give it a shot. I only made a single serving and used the microwave instead of the stove. I heated up the water for about 120 seconds (2 min.) and followed the directions from there. When I got to heating up the milk mixture I put it in the microwave for 45 sec., stirred, another 30 sec., stirred, and a final 15 sec. It was very creamy and I enjoyed it, but there was one thing that I didn't care for. I think that it was a little too sweet, but that doesn't interfere with the recipe. Ultimately, I will definitely make this again, and for others.

I don't normally rate stuff but had to on this.  I make this after every snow adventure or anytime we play out in the cold. I stopped buying the packets bc this is the best I've ever had!  We add marshmallows and it's perfect!  If someone rates this bad you had to of made it wrong or can't taste its the best!

I have a two year old little boy, Robbie, who loves to "cook". I  should now, I'm not the cook of the house asimpler, the better for me. We made this this  morning (minus the half and half, plus 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract). He absolutely loves it. Prefect for my little guy!

Excellent!!!!  Before adding the half and half, I put marshmallows on top and microwaved 25-30 seconds.  Then added the half and half.  The marshmallows REALLY add to the flavor.  I will use this recipe from now on.  FANTASTIC!!!

What a neat recipe when we were wanting some good hot chocolate.  I thought it was a bit too sweet so will reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup next time but otherwise follow the recipe.  The thickness and chocolate flavor were spot on and I'll be making this again when the hankering hits!

I loved the idea of making a syrup.  Made the chocolate very creamy, and you can make extra and keep on hand.  But .... it was way too sweet.  I suggest much more cocoa and a lot less sugar.  For 2 servings I used 1/3 C. cocoa and 1/4 C. sugar and half the milk.  Still too sweet and needed more chocolate. A pinch of cinnamon adds a lot - just enough to not taste it overtly.

Delicious! Arguably a meal! I leave out the half&half and let the person drinking it decide how rich or creamy (by adding half&half) they want it. I also make homemade whipped cream - 1 tbsp sugar per half cup of heavy whipping cream. It's heavenly.

I give it 3 stars, but I did cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup.  I wasn't brave enough to do 3/4 cup.  Just thinking about 3/4 cup compared to the cocoa is insane.  I think it was still a little too sweet.  The flavor is good, but it isn't a thick and creamy cocoa.  It's a little better than a package mix.  Not bad if you are not too picky.

I am reviewing this as I enjoy a cup with a toasted bagel with butter and cinnamon sugar. It is everything I want in a cup of hot cocoa. I used skim milk because it is the only kind I have, and after it warmed a little in the pan, I added a 5 oz. can of evaporated milk and heated it until done. I did not use the half & half as I didn't have it. I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and used 1 tsp. of vanilla. Marvelous!

This recipe is really, really good.  It' will definitely help with those chocolate cravings and its creamy.  I like this ALOT.  What did I do differently, I used a dark cocoa, personal preference, I changed the sugar to just under 1/2 cup and its still pretty sweet.  I also used almond milk instead of half and half and for my own personal taste, I added some cinnamon and a hint of cayenne pepper to the cup before I added the mixture from the stove.  This is what cocoa is supposed to feel like :-)

This was really good. I made a big batch, 18 servings, after I added the milk and vanilla I transferred it all to a slow cooker on high for about an hour and a half. Perfection! (did go with less sugar though like others had said)

Instant family favourite! Hubby will take this over Tim Hortons hot chocolate anyday! (this is saying alot) A little too chocolatey, rich for me, but so easily rememedied by diluting with more milk. Make a big batch and store in fridge for a quick treat. :)

This is creamy and delicious even without the half and half somehow. I also took out a quarter of the sugar and it was perfectly sweet just like that. This is a keeper for sure

We used this for an office party and I made the recipe for 30 servings.  It turned out GREAT and it was a HUGE success!  I had a lot of compliments on it being the best Hot chocolate they had ever had.

WAY too rich for my taste.  I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup, and still found I needed to add 2-3 x the amount of milk before it was not too sweet to drink.  Still a good basic recipe, but next time, I'll make the syrup, then add it to the milk to taste, keeping the rest of the syrup for a later time.

Really really liked this recipe.  I cut the ingredients in half to only make two servings.  As others have mentioned...it was super super sweet, so I ended up adding more boiling water until it was to my liking.  I added half and half until it was how I wanted it and it was perfect!

I have never had home made hot chocolate before. This stuff is AMAZIIIING! I did use almond milk in place of conventional, and I also used peppermint mocha half and half for a twist. I made it last night and I want to make it again right now! Sooo easy, will never do a mix again!!

I made this with almond/coconut milk and a stevia/sugar blend and cut the sweetener by a third as other reviewers suggested.  Delicious and I'd definitely make it again.  I only made 1 serving.  I dumped everything into my mug and put it in the microwave for a minute.  Be sure to mix it well though...

I have made this recipe several times! Great basic Hot Cocoa recipe.  I've made it using only whole milk and also using half heavy cream.  Fun recipe to play with and it's delicious everytime! I agree with the other reviewers, I only use 1/2 c sugar... brown sugar is my preference :)

This has become my staple cocoa recipe--I'll never buy hot cocoa powder again. I found it far too sweet, but cutting the sugar down to 1/2 cup on my next batch made it just right. I also swap the vanilla at the end out for a splash of khalua, but it tastes great virgin too.

I cut down on the sugar and it was still way too sweet.  While generally not a problem for me, this was very cocoa-y.  I guess I wanted more of a chocolate taste, and something a little creamier.  I might next time use baking squares instead of powdered cocoa.

This recipe was very good!!
I scaled it down for one person, and I did not have Half and Half so I used whipping cream.
I added less sugar,
Way better than packaged cocoa mix.
Very good!! I will make this again.

Perfect cup of cocoa after a day of playing in the snow!  I added a little almond extract and, of course, cut the sugar to a little less than 1/2 cup. (It's also great with a little Creme de Menthe.)

I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and made this with 2 cups soy milk and one cup rice milk to make it non-dairy.  I put in 2/3 cup sugar before reading the reviews recommending 1/2 cup, so I added a few extra teaspoons of cocoa powder and some extra hot water.  It was very good.  Next time I will make it with only 1/2 cup sugar.

OMG! I will never buy store bought cocoa again.   This recipe was absolutely delicious! My kids, their friends, my friends, my family ask for this all the time and all agree that this is the best cocoa that they've had.  Thanks for the recipe.  Now a family fav!

I agree with the other reviewers that it was a little sweeter than I expected, but I didn't think it was so sweet that I'll never make it again. I may adjust the sugar levels next time, but it won't be much.   I also used evaporated milk instead of half and half because that's what I had, and it turned out fine. Thanks for sharing. This was great for a snow day, and the kids thought it was great.

Delicious!  Probably the best hot cocoa I've ever had.  Just as good with or without the half and half added at the end.  Very rich either way, and the addition of marshmallows or whipped cream is too much.

Rich, creamy cocoa. I served them with a candy cane at Christmas brunch which added a nice peppermint flavor.  They were such a hit that I could have made double the amount and it would have been all gone.

Great! I sort of 1/2 the recipe, used 1/2 water and 1/2 whole milk, added less sugar and used REAL vanilla extract.  But it was perfect. I'm sure it's perfect as is, I just used what I had available to me.

Waaaaaay too sweet. I'll probably try again, but will definitely cut the sugar a bit. Mine came out more like chocolate syrup than hot cocoa.

I'm giving this 4 stars, just because the first time I made it, it was too sweet.  I always like to follow the recipes as is the first time.  So the 2nd time, I decided to go a little less on the sugar and added the half & half in when I added the milk, this time it was EXCELLENT!!  It seemed to be a little bit creamier and just the right amount of "sweet".  thanks for the recipe!!  P.S. Enjoying this on Christmas with a little bit of Bailey's.  Perfect!!

I make this consistently throughout the winter season. I like to have some on hand in the fridge for when guests come over. I like to take it to work. I add some eggnog instead of half and half when eggnog is in the house. Sometimes I use less sugar, and it's just as good. This is a great, versatile recipe that makes the season brighter. And now I don't have to be disappointed by crummy packaged hot cocoa. Thank you SO much.

I just made this for my husband and I tonight... and it was awesome! I am excited to make it again because I didn't realize when I bought the cocoa I was out of vanilla extract. It is still good.. but will probably be better with the missing ingredient!

This method of coca ( too proud to call it a recipe:P) is a great base for making hot choco no matter how different the texture you u like is . I for instant like it to be a bit thicker than the milk base ,and the coca taste to be richer so i  1/2 table spoon cornstarch to the choco/sugar mixture. And make the 1/2 coco cup into a full cupp. gives you that smooth rich thick drink.

This hot cocoa is perfect! It is really sweet, which a few people complain about, but I don't have a problem with it. Though I'm sure it wouldn't hurt it any to cut back the sugar a little. It reminds me a little of the hot chocolate I can get from Tim Hortons!

Way Sweet!  But so so good.  I always try to do the recipe as written for a fair review and next time I will reduce the sugar way down.  I will try 1/4-1/2c, the milk and half and half both have sugar too to keep in mind....but even still so much better than the package stuff which is way sweet too.

great recipe! my husband (who isn't a fan of sweets) said this was really good but a little sweet for him so maybe i will reduce the sugar next time. however, for me this was perfect! i used caramel creamer instead of half and half and it added that something extra - will be making a lot more of this recipe now that it is winter!

This is good, but it's a lot simpler to heat up chocolate milk.  Which is what this recipe tastes like.  I used Nestle cocoa powder, added a dash of baking soda and pure vanilla extract, but the end result was a little chalky (expected since this uses cocoa powder) and not overwhelmingly chocolatey like I expected.  Overall, good cocoa and fun to make together, but not super rich or chocolatey.

This recipe is very good but, upon reading other reviews, I reduced the amount of sugar. I also used a high quality cocoa powder, which gave it a more sophisticated flavor.

I used only about a half cup of sugar and a mixture of fat free evaporated milk and fat free half-n-half so that we could get the same creaminess without a lot of the fat. My kids thought this was wonderful. Quite a treat for them on a cold morning and they felt really special because it didn't come from a packet/mix that I made. This was a great way to start off a cold Friday morning!

VERY VERY YUMMY!! Taste's just like the one's you get from the coffee chop!! I did use less sugar and will use even less next time!! The portions are also a little on the same side, I made a double batch just for myself and I filled up half of my 16oz cup... so If your making it for a lot of people I would make a little bit more! Will be making this for now on, instead of the powder stuff!!!

Instead of the sugar, I used 1/4 c. stevia blend and maybe 2 T honey.  I still thought it was just a little too sweet.  It was also thick for me, I think.  I will skip the half and half next time.  I might do more water instead of some of the milk as well.

I only had canned milk so I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used a 12 oz. can of milk and filled the rest with water it was sooooooo good! We put some marshmallows in it and sat at home when it was icy and snowy and we had no power it was great! **Also I only used 1/2 c of sugar

It was pretty good. I followed the review advice and cut down on the sugar, which I think was a smart move. I'm going to have to tweak this around a little bit to get the flavor/creaminess I am looking for, but overall, it's a great starter for a great home-made hot chocolate! Thanks for posting.

Tastes great with or without the cream.  I substituted powdered Stevia for sugar and it was awesome!

I made this exactly according to the recipe for my family and I was embarrassed to serve it. It tasted like Swiss Miss made with milk instead of water. I added twice as much milk to balance it out, but it was still not very good. I heard someone on the food channel say they made hot chocolate with butter but that wasn’t the recipe she was working on so she didn't give an exact recipe... i am going to experiment with that a little.

This was good! Made a few changes as suggested by the other reviews (1/2 cup sugar, added a bit of cinnamon). I didn't have half and half so I added a bit of milk instead. It was still very creamy.

Absolutely amazing.  Although pre-made mixes are far more convenient, they aren't anywhere near as creamy or chocolatey as this recipe turned out!  I wanted only two servings instead of four, so I cut the recipe in half; however, it only made enough cocoa for a mug and a half (I'd guess about 10 fl ounces, whereas I needed 16 to fill the mugs).  Next time I'll make it for three servings, just to ensure I have enough for two people.  Instead of half-and-half, I used heavy cream, because that's what I had on hand.  I also added a touch of cinnamon sugar on top for presentation and a little zing.  It was perfect on a chilly night!

This was so good.  Much better than the packets with all the preservatives in them.  I didn't have half-and-half so just added a bit of whipped cream to the top.  And, like others, I only used half the amount of sugar called for it and was perfect.

This is delicious. I did follow everyone's advice and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, more than that and it would have been too sweet. GREAT RECIPE!

Just do the 1/2 cup sugar...definitely. I add about a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. One more thing, I use scalded milk instead of boiling water. Yummmy...oh, and for the grown-ups, add some peppermint schnapps!

This recipe is way too sweet.  I cut the sugar down to about 1/2 a cup and it was still too much.  I would use about a 1/4 cup if I were to make it again.

I wish I had read all of the reviews before I made the cocoa. It is good, but too chocolately and sweet for my fiance' and me. As another person wrote, the search continues! If you have a recipe that's not super chocolately and overly sweet, please let me know. :)

Very creamy. I didn't think it was too sweet, but I also added a touch of cayenne, cinnamon and nutmeg, which could have evened the whole thing out.

Perfect on a wintry day! I substituted splenda for the sugar and used skinny cow skim milk, less calories, but tastes delicious.  Add whip cream and mini chocolate chips and it is a hit.

This was fabulous and so easy to make.  I added a little more water to cut back on the sweetness, but other than that it was perfect.  I know everyone will love it at our family Christmas Eve Party this year!

SOOO delicious!  and I have never particularly liked hot chocolate.  I got tired of paying so much for powdered hot cocoa in the store, so I looked up a recipe.  this was the first one I tried and I'm sticking with it.  my kids LOVE it!  I took the advice of some of the reviews and reduced the sugar to 1/2 a cup instead of 3/4.  It was just perfect.

Yummy! I followed other reviewers' advice and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet! I also discovered halfway through making this that I didn't have enough milk (only 2 cups) so I topped the rest of the 3.5 cups with half-and-half. It was delicious!! We loved it after putting up our Christmas lights in the cold!

Good but to sweet for my taste although I realize many might like it.  I will cut the sugar to 1/2 c next time.  This is a keeper and I will use again with adjustments for my lack of sweet tooth :)

This is very, very good with mini marshmallows! We didn't have creamy so we just used (skim) milk. Thank you this wonderful cold-day drink! I can't wait 'till it snows no can make this after a full day of sledding.

Oh yum. But did cut the sugar back to 1/2 c and could probably go down to a 1/3 c ... but that's "Mom" taste. My two sons, aged 13 and 10, thought it was appropriately sweet, while I felt my face scrunching up a little.  Toss in a lil cinnamon with the other dry ingredients ...

WOW!!!! Good bye Swiss Miss, and HELLO to this recipe. I did follow some advise. I did cut the sugar to a little less than 1/2 cup and I used Ghiardelli unsweetened cocoa. Once you try Ghiardelli, its tough to use anything else, I even use it for my Brownie mix. I doubt I will ever buy packets again. Thanks for this fabulous recipe!!!!

This is a great, classic hot cocoa recipe. I agree with the other reviewers though who said that it was too sweet. I would probably start with 1/2 cup of sugar, and add more to taste if needed.

I added the half and half with the vanilla, and after having one mug (which was delicious), put it all in a thermos and let it cool, since I made the whole recipe, but there's just me!  Well, it was a million times better the next day.  Even richer and much creamier.  Thanks for a delicious, DELICIOUS hot chocolate!!

I scale this recipe to one serving but use only 2T sugar.  I heat the milk in the microwave and then stir everything in.  It's quick and tasty when my little boy wants hot chocolate.

Very good. Much better than the last hot chocolate recipe I tried from this site that tasted like warm milk with a chocolate chip floating in it. (it was bad). This was very chocolaty and sweet and was much more like store bought hot cocoa. I didn't measure precisely, just eyeballed it, but I'm sure I got darn close to the actual measurements and it was not too sweet at all.  The only disappointment was that I cut the recipe in half because I was only serving myself and my husband and it didn't fill 2 mugs to the top, only about halfway on each. So if you are expecting to get 4 full mugs of hot cocoa from the 4 servings it lists, you better have small mugs. Next time I know to use the full recipe for two people.

I made a big batch (4 x the ingredients)of this recipe for a gathering of friends.  It was a fun afternoon get-together of hot chocolate and a variety of homemade cookies.  Once the recipe was made, I transferred it to my slow cooker to keep warm.  I brought out some liquers and let everyone add their favourites to their cups.  Everyone liked it.  However, I found it a bit "powdery" in texture, and found some cocoa sludge at the bottom of the cooker after the party.  If making a big batch again, I would definitely use less cocoa powder and ensure that it was top-quality.  As per other reviews, I used less sugar (just under 2 cups).  Good idea!

This is a delicious cocoa recipe.  I don't think I can go back to the powder in a packet ever again.  I only made two changes.  First I didn't add the cream at the end of recipe.  Second, I added a pinch of cayenne pepper to give it a subtle kick.

This is really easy and really yummy.  For the baking cocoa I used half dutch processed and half black cocoa (super dark chocolate)so it was very dark and very rich.  We skipped the half and half and opted for homemade cinnamon whipped cream on top.  All 4 of my children enjoyed warmning up with this after playing out in the snow.  Will make this again on a cold winter day!

Wow, awesome, doubled it, we have 5 kids, but only put in about 1 cup + 2 tablespoons of sugar, and that was sweet enough. a nice touch to this was some homemade marshmallows to top it off.

Like others, I only used 1/2 cup of sugar. Topped with mini marshmallows, whipped cream, and drizzled with Hershey's dark syrup. The result was several excellent cups of hot cocoa. Thanks!

Mmmmm, good!  I noticed alot of reviewers saying it was to sweet so I started with 2tbsp of sugar and added more to our tastes.  I did use about 4/5tbsp in the end.  Only thing is that it is very rich so keep the portions small and have plenty of cream (whipped or pouring) to hand.

This really is the best hot cocoa ever!!! If you are thinking about leaving out a little sugar, think what kind've chocolate you like. I like sweeter chocolate more then bitter choclate. I left the recipe exactly as it reads and it turned out great. everyone in the house loved it.

Super good! Although I altered the recipe a bit, it's only because I didn't have half and half. I halved the recipe and used regular milk, but just a little bit more of it. I also added 1 heaping tablespoon of powdered milk to make it creamy (to compensate for the lack of half & half). Kept the same amount of sugar because I added a bit more chocolate. Topped it with a bunch of marshmallows.. what a treat! I wonder how it tastes with fat free milk (I used lactose-free b/c I'm lactose-intolerant) or maybe a dash of cinnamon? Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!

I used evaporated milk as recommended by another reviewer.  It was just average.  Although I changed the recipe, it wasn't very chocolatey (I ended up added 4 cups of evaporated milk and regular milk so it wasn't the amount of liquid that I put in).  That being said, it probably at least would've been "creamier" with the half and half so I give it and extra star for the benefit of the doubt, totally four stars for this recipe.  I've had better though.

Amazing! This cocoa is fantastic, just like the one you would drink at a fancy cafe. I cut back on the sugar, as many reviewers suggested, and it was sweet enough indeed - it didn't need any more.

Not sure what I was expecting, but I thought this was entirely too sweet. I would use less sugar if I made this again.

This really hit the spot, but maybe I agree with the other reviews when they say there's too much sugar. I'll cut that just a bit next time. Thanks for the recipe!!

this hot cocoa would be good if you were a big coffee person. but not if your expecting hot cocoa. so i put choco chips and a pack of store bought cocoa. But if yall like it like the recipe says then keep it that way. Good Job!

Excellent recipe!  I will never buy premade mix again.  I didn't have any half and half so I just used 4 cups of 1% milk and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup as suggested and it was perfect!  My girls thought is was much better than the store made mix and they had fun making it.

I made a single-cup serving.  The single-cup serving calls for three tablespoons of sugar, but instead I used two.  And I used fat-free half and half.  Those were the only two differences.  It tastes great.

I combine this recipe with the "Moscow Hot Chocolate" recipe for a GREAT winter warm up.  I don't add the half and half, it doesn't need it...you could use fat free half and half if you're as horrified as I am by the fat content...

I made 1/2 the recipe and it still yielded around 3 1/2 cups. It was much too sweet for me. The next time I will cut the sugar down to more than half. It's very rich. If you have a sweet tooth, you will love it. I thought it was okay.

I cut the sugar back to a little more than 1/2 c based on others' suggestions, and it was still way too sweet for my taste. The kids enjoyed it, though. If I make this again, I think I'll use much less sugar.

This is a really great homemade cocoa.  It's easy and doesn't taste too cocoa powdery.  I usually cut the amount of sugar down a bit and use healthier sugar subs/alternatives like sucanat, maple syrup, xylitol and raw honey (that I add at the end though so it doesn't get cooked).  I also don't add the half and half, I just don't let the cocoa get too hot.  Very tasty, thanks!

This is a good basic recipe for hot cocoa.  We garnished ours with whipped cream, and used a mix of skim and 1% milk and left out the half-n-half.

Yummmm!!!  I halved the recipe to make it just for myself.  I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and cut the sugar in half.  Tastes just as good as Starbucks hot cocoa!  Will definitely make this again!

This is a very good hot cocoa recipe! I like to dry roast the cocoa in a pan to bring out the flavor, then I add Splenda (less than 1/2 cup), salt and hot water. This was very good. Next I am going to see if I can make it better by making 1/2 of it Baker's chocolate and adding honey and cinnimon! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  I cut the recipe in half because I was only making it for two.
I do recommend if you use the full serving  recipe that you use only 1/2 cup of sugar.  I plan to make this on Christmas morning.  This was very easy to make.  I will be passing this recipe on for sure.  Thanks!

I did not have half and half or vanilla so i used a 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract.My brother didn't care for the almond,my mother enjoyed it and said it was very rich and  tasted like the hot chocolate at starbucks.I thought it was good,i will probably not use the almond again but i will make this hot coco again if the mood strikes me,I may also try coconut extract as another reviewer mentioned

This is rich and creamy, but, to be honest, it didn't taste any better than hot milk mixed with chocolate powder, so it just wasn't worth the hassle. If you do make this, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.

Love this recipe!  I have never liked hot chocolate.  This is the first time I have ever been able to drink an entire glass and enjoy it!  My boyfriend and I make this all the time.  We substitute powdered sugar for regular sugar and we leave out the half and half and just add some evaporate milk or regular milk at the end.  Terrific recipe!!!

This recipe is good. A little too rich/chocolatey for me. Misleading with a "creamy" title. I will keep around until I find something better.

I wanted just one cup of cocoa, and wanted it fast.  So I altered the servings size to 1 (nice All Recipes feature!), and used my microwave to first heat the water, sugar, cocoa, and salt mixture.  I then added the milk as directed and heated that in the microwave, too.  Finished off with a bit of cream and it was very good.  Like others, I reduced the amount of sugar.  I bet this is even better made the right way, but I was very satisfied with my result.

This is very rich and creamy and fairly easy to prepare.  I normally wouldn't bother with making hot chocolate from scratch.  But, it's one of those recipes that just make the holidays more special.

Funny, I was reading through the reviews and someone made this because they were craving it during studying for finals...that is the same reason I made it! Anyhow, this was very good. I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead and it is enough for me. This tastes much better and purer than the kind from stores, less chalky. It is not really that time consuming...unless you have no patience and are VERY time pressed! Takes about 5 minutes...worth it!

I need a hot drink fix and was all out of Chai so in desperation I made this hot cocoa.  I scaled it down to 1 cup and made it in the microwave.  I also scaled down the sugar, it was very rich and creamy, (I used skim milk plus the half and half).  Very good.  This one goes in my recipe book.  Thank you!

I made this as a "warm up" for 14 three year olds and 6 mommys after sledding.  This had a 100% success rate.  (and the mommys asking for the recipe)  I don't think you could get a better rating.  This was made exact to recipe !

Wow.  Simple, delicious, and best of all, no additives or preservatives.  I find that sugar and cocoa measurements can be adjusted to taste:  I tried 1/2 c. sugar and 1/4 c. cocoa powder.  A tad of half and half to finish gives this drink some body.  My family raved over this recipe.

Excellent hot cocoa!!! As mentioned in other reviews it was quite sweet and each serving only makes enough for a small styrofoam cup size. I just used my regular mug, made the chocolate mixture with hot water from the tap, filled to the top with milk (to cut down on sweetness and make a full serving), and microwaved until hot. Super easy and no extra pans to wash!

I’ve been trying to replicate the hot chocolate in Italy which was thick and super delicious.  While this wasn’t as thick, the flavor was excellent.  For 2 servings  I included 2T Klim powdered milk with cocoa, sugar, salt and water mix + 2% milk & vanilla, cooked as directed.    I served and topped it with whipped cream.

We love this recipe! Needed to make a powdered cocoa mix for a camping trip, used 14 tablespoons of whole milk powder, doubled the amount of cocoa powder, 1/8tsp salt and nixed the vanilla.  A friend suggested making vanilla sugar to use next time which we will definitely try. Used 4 tablespoons  or 1/4 cup of mix per 8 oz boiling water.  It was perfect for the trip.

This is very good. I’d make it again, for sure. Rich and creamy. It is a heavy drink but that’s not a complaint by any means. It took a bit of time, more than the 7 minutes noted in the recipe. Well was worth it. Thanks.

Wonderful!  I made it with 2% milk, but will use whole milk next time.  Also used extra dark cocoa powder.  Next time, will add a little more powder and less sugar.

Delicious. Quick and easy on the stove top, but I have to confess: It didn't serve four -- it served one, because I made it while I was alone and drank all of it. I've made it three or four times since I found this recipe.  I halved the recipe a couple of times, since  the full recipe takes nearly a quart of half-and-half.
I made it with a little less sugar and a little more cocoa since I like a stronger chocolate taste. I also used half-and-half instead of simply whole milk.

this was sooo good! Easy to make too i actually made this twice now one time with milk and one time with soy and honestly they both tasted amazing which is great because i try not to consume dairy if i can help it, the holidays are an acceptation. It was pretty sweet but you can always add less sugar!

Really good,  but will probably use a little less  sugar next time because whipped cream is necessary for hot cocoa. If you don't need whipped cream,  then this recipe is perfect.

This hot chocolate was fantastic! Thanks for sharing. I made a double batch the night before a pot luck and slowly warmed it up in my crockpot the next morning and it was a huge hit. I set up a hot cocoa bar & everyone raved about the hot chocolate. No need to change a think ( INCLUDING THE SUGAR) to this recipe - thanks :)

I  made this a lot.  It's quick and luscious. I usually dont' have half and half on hand, so don't worry if you don't have any.  Somehow I usually manage to have whipped cream though!  My office loves it when I bring it in.

When the recipe called to add half and half; I did not have any and replaced it with 1 tbls soft butter and 1/2 to 3/4 cup of 2 percent milk right into the pan.  Allow butter to melt and allow time for milk to warm for a few minutes. The family loved this recipe! Thank you for sharing!

I will definitely make this again.  I only used a scant 1/4 cup of sugar--was plenty for me.  I'd love to whip some whipping cream instead of half and half.

Sooo.. I clearly have a sweet tooth cuz I followed the reviews and used less sugar like most suggested and I ended up putting most back in. LOL I used the 1 serving calculations (LOVE how AR does that) and this was FANTASTIC! I have a dairy allergy and can't have store bought hot choc (cuz even the mix has dairy in it) And this Totally satisfied my craving!! THANK YOU!

I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and less sugar. It was good but still a little too sweet so I’ll cut back more on the sugar next time.

the method is great but there's way too much sugar in it. I suggest 2 tsp sugar per 1 tsp cocoa powder for a cup.

This is great hot cocoa! I made the Hershey’s recipe on the cocoa box last night, this one is much better. I used evaporated milk(it’s what I had), creamy frothy. It is very sweet and I will probably use a little less sugar next time though. We will never buy hot cocoa packets again.

Changed to the 1/2 & 1/2 to 35% whipping  cream which made it truly amazing. I also  made an adult version by adding 1oz of 360 double chocolate vodka. Great for cold winters day outside.

As always, these recipes are great and so easy to make, even easy to adapt to variations of this hot cocoa recipe...I added additional chocolate shavings and also shredded coconut to the cocoa, it was very good....Highly recommend it!

Excellent recipe. Like others, I decreased the sugar content, but then I added in 1/2 cup or so of grated milk chocolate shavings. I used 2 1/4 cups of milk with 1 1/14 cup heavy cream rather than the half and half. It was a major hit with the family and I'll be making this for parties in the future.

This was so horribly sweet! I would knock this down to 1/4 cup of sugar or less, considering that milk AND half and half both have sugar. I even replaced one of the cups of milk with almond milk and it was unpleasant. If you care about sweetness, than you’ll love this. Otherwise, it’s a no!

3/4 cup sugar made it super sweet and was too much to handle.  I recommend using 1/2 cup of sugar because it makes it sweet without being too overpowering.

A wonderful recipe!  I love the fact that I can make this with simple ingredients that I always have. If you like a richer chocolate flavor and happen to have Dutch process cocoa on hand, substitute 1 or 2 tablespoons into the cocoa measurement & it's even better.  My kids said it's the best they've ever had.  Swiss Miss just doesn't even come close.

I made this tonight and it was great! As others suggested I used 1/2 cup sugar which was the perfect sweetness. I had a lot of half and half and used 2 cups of skim milk and 1 1/2 cups half and half since that’s what I had on hand. I’ll be making this quite often. We loved it!

The kids loved the smell and thought I was baking! Delicious. I did  take recommendation of 1/2 cup sugar. Did not use half & half, instead, adding mini marshmallows- the kids insist. Took some in thermos to football game and was just as delicious.

Made this for my partner and i in the middle of the night when we couldn't rest. It's very sweet but not too rice. Didn't add the cream because we didnt have any. It turned out great nonetheless, delicious and warm. Have some left over as well. Definitely nice for cold evenings!

amazing recipe. I've used it with different types of cocoa. I got the best result with a Peruvian cocoa. I also decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup as the rest of reviewers recommend. You get much better chocolate flavor!

I thought this was really good. I still found it pretty sweet, even with ½ c of sugar. I’ll probably cut back on that even more next time, but yummy!

This is extremely creamy! Next time I am going to cut back the sugar to 1/2 a cup and see if that is still sweet enough - this time is was REALLY REALLY sweet.

I make 2 servings, skipping the boiling water and using all almond milk in place of the milk + cream; heating the milk in the microwave for 30 seconds.  Added a couple of splashes into the cocoa mixture, then stirring and heating on med-low for a minute or so before adding the remaining milk, heating & stirring until steamy.  Put a pinch of chipotle in mine and Fluff into my companions.  DELISH!!

Brilliant recipe. I tweaked it a tiny bit; the amount of milk seemed a little lacking, at least for my taste (just a bit too rich) so I added a cup and a half more. Eventually I may try adding other flavours to the party (maybe nutmeg, or even mint?). Great recipe though, I make it once a week for my wife and kids. Gets finished within the hour :)

We followed the directions exactly, and it was perfect. I don’t know that it was quite sweet enough though, so we topped it with marshmallows, whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and mini chocolate chips. Delish!

Wayyyy too sugary for me, but if you like those made ready to-go American grocery store cakes and cupcakes, don't tweak the recipe.

I reduced the amount of sugar from 2/3rd cups to just 1/3rd to level out the bitterness of the cocoa. The end result I'd say ended up tasting bitter/semisweet but was very good. I used whole milk and heavy cream.

Also, you can swap out the vanilla extract for pepper/spearmint for a more christmasy kick!

For me I like tasting the bitterness of chocolate; that's what makes something truly chocolate for me; no overbearing tooth pinching sweetness of sugar!

Was exactly what I was looking for. I used dark cocao since I prefer it, and Bailet's instead of the half and half since this was just for the adults...  Was a ittle too sweet, so next time I'll add less sugar.

WE WILL NEVER BUY PREMADE COCOA MIX AGAIN!! Although this is a little time consuming, the cocoa is so smooth and creamy! Next time I may increase the sugar a bit for personal taste. I served in a mason jar, topped it with whipped cream and sprinkles. It says 4 servings, but I believe it's more like 6.

It's great if you decrease the amount of sugar (I used maple syrup which is a good substitute) by a LOT. Maple syrup and sugar are similar in sweetness, and even though I used only about 1/3 of a cup, it was a tiny bit too sweet, but still delicious.
I also increased the cacao powder to half (1/2) a cup, which made it more chocolatey, and therefore yummier.
The reason I didn't take a star off for the almost pure sugar recipe is that when you moderate the sweetener, it's perfect.
The cream on top is good too.

Delicious. I put mini marshmallows on top of whipped cream and then sprinkled confectioners sugar and cocoa powder on top of  that.   I then added  a cookie straw to drink from.   Kids loved it!

This hot chocolate recipe was amazing rich and creamy flavor only change I would make as other reviewers have stated is cutting down on the sugar it was much to sweet for my personal taste.I used cashew milk that has a touch of almond in place of the milk.I added whipped cream to the top and crushed candy canes mmm! Will be making again.

This is good but extremely rich. I will say that I didn’t have half and half on hand so I read that I can substitute it with whole milk and butter. Did not have whole milk either so just used butter in 2% milk...still very sweet and rich.

I made this for my kids and we loved it! The video was very helpful! The recipe said to add the 1/2 and 1/2, but the video showed them doing it first in each mug before adding the cocoa. I appreciated that detail! 

I will be making this again! Super easy and very delicious.

This is a new holiday tradition in our house! Just cut back on the sugar (as so many have mentioned) and it’s the perfect cup of cocoa on a cold night. I tried making this with almond milk and it was just as good. Definitely a keeper

It is snowing here in Minnesota today so my daughter and I wanted a cup of hot chocolate.  Made this with the only change being the sugar.  As the reviews said it was extremely sweet, I cut it back to 1/2 cup.  I also used a sweetener that I just received from Amazon by the name of "Bocha Sweet".  It sweetened with no aftertaste and was THE BEST hot chocolate we have had in years.  I only had dark cocoa, too, which made it even more yummy.  This is a definite keeper recipe.  Thank you so much for posting!

Kids and I thought it was great as is, but certainly one could easily cut back on the sugar if desired. It was rich, creamy, and chocolately...just as hot chocolate should be!

It was amazing!!! I am a 13 year old kid and i made this for my parents and sister and everybody loved it. I made it with the full cup of sugar and no one complained but they might have just been being polite. Anyway, i tried it myself and loved it! I personally didn't think it was to sweet but that was probably just because of my sweet tooth!

Delicious! I decreased the sugar to a little over 1/4 c and that was just the right sweetness for our family.

We went swimming in a very cold pool and it was especially challenging for our house guest from Brazil. So I looked this up and made it easily. We all loved it! It's a keeper and the house guest was especially grateful. Thanks.

This stuff. Is. AMAZING! Definitely keeping this recipe. Its a teeny bit too sweet for me normally, so if I make it regularly, I might cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup, but the original amount of sugar is great when I'm craving something really sweet!

I made this with 3/4 c of sugar as listed and extremely too sweet! Not even drinkable. Made again with 1/3 c sugar and was sooooo much better! Will try 1/4 c sugar and I think that will perfect this wonderful recipe!! Yummy!!

The Grands wanted hot cocoa today, so I found this recipe and made them very happy. It doesn't have that smooth mouth feel that the ones with sweetened condensed milk have, but it was still good. And the best part is I always have the ingredients for making it!

ive made it as is, and with modifications. if you prefer a less sweet version, like my Dad, decrease the sugar. I made it equal to the cocoa (1/3 c sugar and 1/3 c cocoa powder). Also tried with special dark cocoa, which was good.

Cut the sugar from 3/4 cup to 1/2 cup.  

Don't add store bought marshmallows. Instead, make homemade whip cream in the magic bullet with a little vanilla and sugar!

This recipe is RICH and FILLING.  Loved it

I just followed the recipe as stated and am very pleased who the result. It creates a dark hot chocolate, almost syrupy. It's on the sweeter side with all the sugar, but still somewhat bitter from all the cocoa. I didn't have creamer on hand so I used evaporated milk instead. I added it right to the hot chocolate in the pan after tasting.

I only gave it 4 stars because it was too sweet. I only used 1/4 c of sugar. I also used 1c of cream with 3c of milk. I did add a spoonful of condensed milk.  The vanilla was optional, definitely depends if u like it or not

I am very picky about hot chocolate but I love this recipe so much. It can be sweet but I just add some extra milk and it helps. This recipe is very simple and fun to make with kids. It also makes amazing mochas (1/3 coco 2/3 coffee).

Yuck.  I'd rather drink Hot Chocolate milk.  This stuff tasted like hot cocoa powder.  Ruined my milk.  Slightly better than the packets you add to boiling water, but the time and effort it took was much more than our usual method of making Hot Chocolate as my better half put it.  Won't make again.

My family and I absolutely love this recipe! It's become a snow-day tradition in my house! I've tried many different ways of making hot chocolate, and this is the clear winner. Unlike some methods, it doesn't taste overly sweet or cocoa-y.

Loved it! It is definitely a step up from the premade packages from the store. I made a double batch of the dry ingredients and saved 1/2 for later.  I made it and poured it into my thermal carafe first thing in the morning and it was still piping hot and perfect for warming up after playing out in the snow.  I didn't add the 1/2 cup of half and half. Instead I just poured in about a teaspoon or so in each cup which helped to cool it a bit and taste delicious! I also followed others reviewers suggestions to cut back on sugar. I only used 1/2 cup and it was sweet enough. I was glad I didn't add the full amount.

This is a wonderful recipe just as submitted. If you are looking for less calories, use skim milk and light Cool Whip instead of the heavy cream.

Excellent - not too sweet, if your  taste is different and you found it too sweet you could add more milk. Me and my family however found it perfect. The only thing we were missing was a chilly walk through Hyde Park as we sipped away at this lovely drink. We added just a few marshmallows and a peppermint stick and it was absolute heaven. This is going in our permanent recipe book. Thank you!

Very sweet, rich hot chocolate. I used whole milk and just added more since I didn't have cream. I also put a couple mini candy canes in for a peppermint kick and it turned out absolutely amazing. I think next time I make it I'll add less sugar and use sweetened condensed milk instead of cream and see what happens.

Great hot chocolate recipe! Instead of heavy cream or half and half, I added about a half a can of condensed sweetened milk with the cocoa, sugar and water. It turned out SUPER creamy and rich.

I also agree a little less sugar would be good, just 1/2 cup should be fine. I used Dutch cocoa, and I added about 1/8 tsp of cayenne and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to make a spicy cocoa. It was excellent! My husband added a shot of espresso and said it was great, too. Very versatile recipe. We'll definitely make this again!

With the reduction of sugar to 1/2 this hot chocolate is fantastic. Sometime I add more cocoa for even more chocolaty taste

Way too much chocolate. I had to water it down. I love chocolate but this was too much. If you don't like your hot chocolate to taste like syrup, use about half the chocolate and 2 1/2 cups milk 1 cup water, maybe.

Thank you for this recipe! Very simple to make, a host of picky eaters drank it up with satisfaction, and didn't taste like a sugar coma unlike a lot of other recipes :) followed the recipe exactly as is , though next time I might add whipped cream and some icing sugar for a festive touch ^^

Very delicious. I substituted milk for rice milk. Only added 1/2 the sugar and added 5 drops of peppermint extract.
The best I ever made.

My favorite hot chocolate recipe! Boiling the water, cocoa and sugar really helps make the hot cocoa better than other recipes where you just mix in the dry ingredients to warm milk. The only thing I alter is to add extra cocoa powder, personal preference. To be clear, if you like weakly chocolate hot cocoa, this recipe is NOT for you ;) If you like to put two packets of cocoa mix in your cup, then you will love this recipe!

WAY too sweet for my taste, so for that I give 3 stars. I ended up changing it a bit which made it REALLY good IMO. 

I used 3-3/4c  2% milk, only 1/3 c sugar and mixed in 1/4 c heavy cream with 1 TBSP of vanilla Torani syrup instead of half and half and the vanilla extract. 

I served with a dollop of homemade whipped cream and my husband had mini marshmallows. Perfect!

You guys, it's just so good! I have a major sweet tooth. So I make it exactly how the recipe reads. I even put little marshmallows on top! No one should EVER buy the little packets of hot chocolate after making this!

Can't believe how simple and tasty this recipe is!  I added a few drops of peppermint extract for the kiddo and she loves it!  The peppermint help cut the sweetness of the cocao.  Will definitely keep this in my recipe box!

Loved it, I also used only 1/2 C sugar and used dark chocolate cocoa. So good.
Update: I made the chocolate sauce again but added it to a bullet with some cream, milk and ice, I'm obsessed with this sauce.

The cocoa was really good but it was a little sweet, so I will be making it with 1/2 cup of sugar and not 3/4.  This is a great recipe for hot chocolate and I will make it again!

Absolutely delicious! I made chocolate milk instead of hot chocolate with this recipe and I think drinking it cold toned down the sweetness a bit. Definitely adding this to my recipe box.

I make this every fall.. I personally don't think that it needs 3/4 cup of sugar.. for me I wouldn't be able to enjoy it. I would think as if I was drinking pure sugar and it would turn me away from it.  I use a little under a 1/2 cup instead.. I never seem to have half and half so instead I just use some light cream d it's phenomenal and the kids love it thank you for a great recipe!

Perfect! Simple ingredients I usually have on hand. I halved the recipe, which was super easy with the built in feature on allrecipes. Turned out rich and delicious!

I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't too sweet. The recipe is delicious, but I just reduce the sugar a bit to my liking.
I made a variation to it once by adding a whole orange peel to the mixture and let it steep on low for about 10 minutes. You can also add that mixture to espresso for a beautiful orange mocha. It tasted even better!!!

I am sitting here sipping on this wonderful recipe in bliss but also so ashamed of myself! Its been cold here the past couple of days, which lead to a hot chocolate craving. I actually went to the store and had the nerve to buy swiss miss instant hot chocolate even though I had Hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder in the cabinet. I bought the rich chocolate kind thinking that would make a difference. How wrong was I. NOTHING in the store will compare to this recipe. I reduced the sugar in this recipe as recommended by several other reviews.  Other than than I made no changes to the recipe itself. To enhance the flavor, I added a bit of unsweetened coffee creamer (If you use sweetened, I would reduce the sugar a bit more). I also topped it off with a hand full of marshmallows, drizzled a bit of hot fudge on top, and a dash of cinnamon. For those who wish to make an adult beverage out of their hot cocoa add a bit of rum, Kahlua, brandy, or your favorite liquor. Great recipe!!!

I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of the 3/4, as did many other reviewers, and it was the best hot cocoa I've ever had, and it did make the kitchen smell amazing.  I wouldn't want it any sweeter than it was. A 1/2 cup of sugar makes it plenty sweet. A 3/4 cup would've been sickening!!! Also, I heaped my measuring cup of cocoa, to make it just a tad richer, and my results were very satisfying.

The yummiest cocoa I've EVER had.  And, I agree with others--way too sweet!  Cut it down to 1/3 C sugar.  Also used cream instead of half-and-half.  And, yes, will make it again.

It was very good but also VERY sweet. If you have a sweet tooth this recipe is meant for you. I loved it though. I would give it a five star if it was a bit less sweet. When you make this recipe just add a bit less sugar.

Great recipe!! I just tried it, and it's a hit at home! However, I did alter it a bit. I doubled the recipe in general, but I used 5 cups of raw whole milk (straight from the cow) and 2 cups of water, instead of using half-and-half (we didn't have any at the time). And since raw whole milk has the cream already in it/not removed, it's a perfect substitute, with the water to water it down, so it's not too thick. I also actually forgot to put in the vanilla extract, but my mom said it still tasted really good without it!
Success!

This is AMAZING! I also added 1/2 cup of sugar. I mixed 1/2 cup milk with whipping cream, whipped til it was exactly how I wanted (not too heavy not too light). And so far? I can easily say that this is the best hot chocolate I had in my life, and the people who tried it said the same thing when I made it for them. I'll never stop making this!!

I absolutely liked this recipe. (Thumbs up!)
I made it for 7 weeks in a row, and everyone I served it to was astonished by the creamyness. Though the first time I made it, it didn't quite have the balanced flavourings to it the milk and sugar for example have to be a of a different quantity if water is added. And all the powder rushed to the bottom. So after experimenting with this recipe many times, I started increasing the quantity of milk with a 1/4 cup of cream and used no artificial flavourings after doing that everyone I served it to just couldn't stop having another glass.

Only adding 1/2 white sugar is sufficient. 3/4 cup would be too sweet!
I added 3 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup half and half.

I changed the sugar amount to 1/2 cup and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla (instead of 3/4 teaspoon). With those changes, it was a 5 star hot cocoa.

i did only one serving recipe.

I used recommended sugar and wish i didn't! very sweet! I had to add extra milk. 

I added a few drops of almond extract and 4 big marshmallows. Next time cutting it the sugar super low like one tablespoon for the one serving size. Since im getting the sweet from marshmallows. 

Still yummy though!

I made this for a serving size of 20. I used one gallon of milk and added about a half teaspoon cinnamon. I then cooled it and poured it into the milk jug. I added one pint of half and half and warmed it in the crock pot. Served it at work with marshmallows. It was a hit. Will definitely make it again.

I enjoyed the recipe ALOT, as did my kids! It was easy to make and tasted very creamy. I am not a huge chocolate fan and found the cocoa power left it a bit bitter so I added a full cup of sugar and some cool whip mixed in which made it creamy! Fantastic recipe and kicks the boxed styles butt!

Had this recipe for over a year and followed the instructions down to the last step and it turned out perfect.   The kids looooooved it and so did I.

This fall (2015) I played with it a bit by adding heavy cream along with cinnamon to the recipe & traded the regular vanilla for Mexican vanilla (it's the only type I have at the moment).  It turned out  great.

Very good.  I agree with reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I did not do this when I made it and I wish I would have.  I used Mexican Vanilla in mine.

This recipe was very easy with few ingredients. I, too, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and I omitted the vanilla as I used vanilla soy milk.  In the end it was still very sweet.  I will make again and omit the sugar to see how that turns out. I might have to go for recipe test #3 if that batch doesn't turn out mildly sweet, because my sweet husband will only drink it if it's sweet.  I have a sneaky suspicion that batch #2 will turn out splendidly  for our tastes.

We make this recipe so often. It is the best hot chocolate I have ever had. Way better than starbucks. I actually microwave the water until boiling then add the sugar to the water then the cocoa to the sugar water and beat with a wisk.  Then add the milk. Microwave only recipe! So easy. 5 minutes max

Awesome!! This has such a great flavor. Very creamy, as the name would suggest! Half-and-half is my coffee creamer of choice and I'd never thought to use it in hot cocoa before - it was a great addition! The one minor complaint I have is that it doesn't hold its warmth very well. If you don't drink it very quickly it will be cold before you know it. Nothing that can't be fixed by popping it in the microwave though. I've made this several times now and it's definitely a new favorite drink!

I made this recipe and I'm not so impressed. I didn't enjoy it, although other members of my family did. I used a cheap cocoa though, so I'm gonna make it again with a better cocoa and I will change my review. Thanx!

My Husband and I absolutely LOVED this! This is coffee shop quality but much less expensive! This recipe is 4 stars as written, but 5 stars with my adjustments! I followed the directions, but decreased the sugar to a scant 1/2 cup, increased the vanilla to a scant 1 tsp. I also used whipping cream in place of the half and half (it's what I had on hand), but only used 1/3 cup. I topped it with homemade whipped cream and a pinch of cocoa powder.

This recipe is so creamy and delicious! I've made it three times in the last week and a half and it has turned out great every time. My daughter has been asking for it all day and when I told her I couldn't make it because I was out of sugar, she broke down in tears. It's that good! (Don't worry, I ended up making it for her after my husband went to the store for me.)

Oh my!!! Swiss Miss no more:(. This is a delicious and really simple recipe.  We all were looking forward to cocoa, went to the cabinet and empty box!  I looked up recipes amidst my children's disappointment, found this one.  It was so easy we had apitcher of hot cocoa in twenty minutes.  I made another batch of just the powder mix to keep in the cabinet for next time.  Thank you!

This is so much better than the stuff in the packets and it doesn't take long to make so no more powdered packets for us. Thanks for posting.

It was DELICIOUS and so easy to make. I WISH that the servings were bigger, but I guess you could also make an extra serving. But overall the cocoa was tasty!!!!!

Amazing! I made it for a family gathering and everyone loved it! Instead of adding cream, I just added milk to cool it down. Perfect for any hot cocoa loving family.

Fabulous recipe!  I am surprised at all the reviews that said it is too sweet.  I don't have a sweet tooth and thought this was just right.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I will never use a packet of hot chocolate again.  This is a keeper.

Wonderful! Thick and just the right amount of sweetness. One time I substituted vanilla ice cream for the milk/vanilla, as we ran out of milk. Delicious!

I made this exactly as the recipe was written and it was wonderful! It is very sweet so I do think cutting back to 1/2 cup sugar does taste better in my opinion. It has a nice grown up cocoa taste, not at all like a sugary kids lumpy hot chocolate.

Nice hot cocoa. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and didn't add the 1/2 & 1/2. I also used a raw unsweetened cacao which in my opinion has a richer chocolate taste.

Love the recipe but a little too sweet. Made a few adjustments. 
Used 1/2 cup of sugar
Used 3 table spoons of french vanilla creamer in the coffee cups instead of half and half and vanilla. 
Topped with whip cream and peppermint sprinkles.
For an adult beverage try it with peppermint schnapps

Wonderful stuff!  Just made this recipe with Hershey Special Dark cocoa powder.  I added a dash of cinnamon and cayenne to give it a spicy kick.  Enjoying a cup with my daughter now.

I followed the recipe as written, and it was much much too sweet. It would probably be a lot better with less sugar, but that is not the recipe. If you love sweets, you will love this recipe. Otherwise, consider making it using less sugar.

Way, way, way too sweet. I love sugar, but this was ridiculous. I followed reviews and added only 1/2 a cup and it was still super sweet. I made it with just a touch over 1/3 cup and it was delicious. I didn't bother with 1/2 and 1/2 as I'm lactose intolerant. So I'm not even sure if I made this recipe, in the end. I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and my favorite was with Lactaid milk and Sugar in the Raw. The vanilla was unnecessary but a nice touch, if you have the good stuff. I drank a pot by myself two nights in a row.

The best hot cocoa ever.  We used 1/4 cup sugar, 1 1/2 cups half and half and 2 cups almond milk... Also topped with marshmallows and dark chocolate curls. Delightful.

I followed the recipe but added Bailey's instead of cream at the finish. This made for the best grown up snow day drink we've ever had!  Next time, Kahlua!  Thanks for sharing a delicious and decadent recipe. Definitely in the Hall of Fame for winter drinks!

Good but way too sweet, could have cut the sugar by a 1/3.  I added about a teaspoon of espresso powder for a little kick.

Way too much sugar.  If you cut the sugar in at least 1/2 you get the same result.  I prefer to use minimal sugar and then add more at the end if it's not sweet enough for you.  Way better to start with less and then add more as you need it.  I also leave out the 1/2 and 1/2 most of the time.  It's creamier with it but tastes great even without it.  Much better than a hot chocolate packet from the store!

I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of the 3/4 cup when I made this for my grandkids on New Year's day.  They proclaimed it was the best cocoa they'd ever had, and I have to agree with them.  It's a perfect treat on a blustery Wisconsin day!

Thanks, Jeanie!

Made this for my 6 yr old & 3 yr old when we ran out of cocoa mix. My 6 yr old declared this the BEST Hot Cocoa ever and said we should never buy the store bought again. I definitely agree with her. This recipe is SUPER easy and delicious! Just be sure to cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup or it will be too sweet!

Very yummy. Everyone loved this cocoa and was surprised that it took so little time to prepare. I foresee many more batches of cocoa made in my future!

Big hit at our Christmas Caroling party! I made 37 servings (to make it an even 2 gallons of milk) and found that I needed to double the water when mixing the cocoa and sugar.  Does not affect the end result but made it easier to mix. When heating up that much quantity you have to pay careful attention to the heat/flame to avoid scorching!  I had a bunch left over so I poured the remaining back into the plastic gallon milk container and took it to a friend's Christmas party where she heated it up and it was a hit there too.  Great with whip or marshmallows.

I just made this, but with a few changes. I used more half & half than suggested to cut the sweet, I garnished it with whipped cream and crushed candy canes. My kids loved it and even said it tastes better than Starbucks hot cocoa, which is huge considering they love Starbucks!! It was super easy to make, I think my girls (teens)may want to make this also!!

Really delicious! I didn't have the cream but I added some cinnamon and fresh whipped cream on top. It was a big hit in my home plus really easy to make.

Made as is and LOVED it. I like my drinks sweet so the amount of sweetness was fine for me. I look forward to playing around with different flavors and such. However, it is very very good just as it is.

Used 1/2c of sugar and 1/2c cold milk instead of half and half at the end to cool it down.  Perfect for my little kids!

Loved it!  I used less than a 1/2 of raw sugar and used evaporated milk as someone else suggested. I also added a dash of cinnamon and used Redi Whip instead of Cool Whip because I like real cream.

I really liked this recipe made exactly as written. I'm giving it four stars only because I felt like it was a little too sweet, but I still thought it was great! I will just use less sugar next time. Thanks for the recipe!

ooooh I even halfed the sugar and it was too sweet. The steps are fantastic, and very clever to avoid lumps of the powder to slip into the mix. It's one of the best out there for sure. I actually tried something similar to the sugar rim for cocktails- I melted a milk-chocolate chip and lined the rim of my mug. A fantastic drink to have on a cold-exam studying day.

This was fantastic! I also did what others suggested and used 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 cup of sugar, and evaporated milk instead of half and half since I didn't have any.

Definitely reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup. I tried it with somewhere in between, and it still was just a little too sweet. Next time, I would also try using half cocoa and half real chocolate for a smoother consistency. This also is very good with a little dash of cinnamon and nutmeg and tastes totally fine without the half-and-half.

OMG!!! This is the best hot chocolate recipe EVER! It is way better than the store bought brand! I tried 2 1/2 cup of sugar and it was a little less sweat. The 3/4 cup is to sweet.

It is very good. I dont use the half and half. If really isnt needed and its just extra fat.  One cup is all you need to satisfy your needs.

I used 1 Tbsp of brown sugar for each 1 Tbsp of dark cocoa.
Found it too sweet for my liking - next time i would make this with cocoa only, and use sugar or maple syrup to taste.

I have made this before and my family loves it.  This past weekend, I made it for a group of women that annually makes a trip to Branson, MO.  Everyone and I mean all 17 of us thought it was the best hot chocolate.  Granted, everyone's taste is different,  but  at least try it as written first before you go messing with perfection.

Mmmmm... This recipe belongs in front of a crackling fireplace on a snowy night. Sweet, creamy, chocolatey- truly a gourmet hot cocoa! As per others' suggestion, I used only 1/2 cup sugar and found it perfectly sweet. I also snuck in a hint of caramel syrup and swapped the half and half for a small scoop of vanilla fudge ice cream. Positively divine!

This is so amazing! It is pure and welcoming! I added less sugar and used coffee creamer, French Vanilla. It was still a little too sweet, I'm a sweet tooth! I recommend using less sugar and if u don't have half and half cream or whipped cream, just use coffee creamer! ?? :)

I was skeptical,  but how could so many reviews be wrong.  I followed most peoples advice to use only 1/2 c sugar and it was delicious.  I don't use 1/2 & 1/2 so I use non dairy creamer.  Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe.

This is a wonderful easy recipe! I followed the directions explicitly the first time I made it, but cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup the next time and like it better.  I think if you want to put a marshmallow in it, 3/4 cup makes it too sweet.   Overall:  YUMMY!!

This is so amazing! I love how the vanilla :) Very comforting and sweet.

Truly though, this was hard to make. Yet it's still worth a 5 star (No matter the origin of the recipe) 

I skipped the half and half, and it still turned out great. I didn't boil the ingredients either (It was only 1 serving though)

10/10 would drink

Yummy!  In an effort to drink hot chocolate with less "junk" in it, I made this recipe.  Though it is certainly not as quick to make as a packet, it was beyond delicious and I felt better about serving it to my family.  This will be a favorite wintertime treat!

So I used 1/2 cup of sugar also and I doubled the recipe
I used a cup of sugar and 2/3 cup of cocoa, and a pinch of salt, and I put it in a jar then I took 2 Tbsp of mix, hot water, and a dash of vinalla creamer it's nice and smooth and no easy to have individual cups ready. I would use milk too if I had some

Very sweet may reduce the sugar next time but it definitely cured the sweet tooth, even if only temporarily.

Gawd! I made the mistake of making this before reading the reviews. Too sweet is an understatement. I thought my teeth were going to fall out. And i had already cut some of the sugar on my own. There are better recipes out there, I don't think i'll be attempting to make sense of this one.

This is the best hot cocoa I have ever tasted!!
After tasting it I would cut down the sugar a bit though. 
Otherwise, this is the only hot cocoa I will be drinking from now on!

Fabulous! I'm sure that it's even better the way it's written, but my kids want hot cocoa each time we've been playing out in the cold weather, so to make this a daily winter warm up, I simply use Xylitol for the sugar and 1% or 2% milk for all the dairy. It's still creamy smooth and delicious!

I modified, after reading other reviews of this recipe, by reducing the amount of sugar. Other than that, excellent. My daughter often asks me for hot cocoa now.

Used 1/2 cup of sugar as others did, and it is the best ever! I make a full batch, refrigerate the left-overs, and reheat in the microwave as needed (within a couple days). Just remember to stir it before you pour it into a mug to reheat it, because the cocoa settles to the bottom as it sits.

Amazing as it is with a little less sugar. But lately I've been trying to stay away from dairy. It's snowing where I am and I really wanted some hot chocolate after playing in the snow and the only thing I had laying around was almond milk. So I tried it. And it came out pretty good. In all honesty you can't beat the real deal but for all those who can't indulge in dairy it's a nice change. It kind of tasted like chocolate covered almonds.

Yummy!  Me and the kids were disappointed not to have any instant cocoa, so we gave this a try.  So much better than a packet!  We didn't have cream, so used 2 cups 1% milk and it was still awesome.  Definitely sweet, so I might reduce sugar if just for me.

I really like this recipe.  I use Splenda and add a tablespoon of expresso powder for extra punch and serve with whipped cream.  It's so much healthier than the powdered mixes and not too much trouble to make.   I store any left over in the fridge and heat up as wanted.

My kids always preferred the store bought packets of hot chocolate, until I made this recipe.  Like many other reviewers I found it too sweet, but my kids loved it, so it will be definitely be made again. They don't care for vanilla, so I skipped that, and instead of half and half I used heavy whipped cream (always a hit in my home). For myself, I added a little of the cocoa to my coffee to make a mocha- mmmm that was good!

A good "base" recipe to experiment off of. I think there's still room for improvement. :-) Definitely as good as a mix, if not better. I think next time I'll play with throwing caramels or something in to fancy it up a bit.

This makes some really tasty hot cocoa.  I really love sweet stuff, but even I agree that 3/4 cup of sugar is a little too much.  The second time, I cut the sugar down to a heaping 1/2 cup and it was perfect.  It really makes the chocolate taste richer.  I think this is delicious both with and without the extra half and half added at the end.

I used a half cup of sugar in the recipe.  I think it is rich, chocolatey, and delicious.  This is my 'go to' hot chocolate recipe from now on!

I intended to make as is, but decided I didn't want to use up all my milk and have leftover half and half that would just go bad, so I used 1 cup milk and the rest half and half. It was nice and creamy!  My only complaint is that this cocoa was too sweet for my liking.  When I make again, I will cut back on the sugar. Had I read the reviews, I would have realized that "too sweet" is the main complaint about this recipe.

I made this exactly as it is written and holy cow chocolate explosion!!!  This is only for the extreme chocolate lover and it was awesome!  I might try a little less sugar and more milk next time as it was pretty intense, but overall it was amazing!

Very rich and creamy! I agree with others that you should reduce the sugar if you are not a fan of super sweet. However, I did like it as written.

My husband was craving something creamy and sweet and tried to make one of those cocoa packets, but it was just awful, so I jumped on this site and "creamy hot cocoa" seemed to fit the bill.  It took less than 10 minutes to make and was absolutely delicious.  I thought it was a tad too sweet, so I will reduce the sugar next time.  So glad I found this before Christmas, I shall add it to our rotation of holiday/winter beverages and will never be buying those awful packets again!!

Well, before I read the other comments, I decided to lower the amount of Sugar and cocoa powder. I didn't get 4 cups, I got 3, but it was amazing! This recipe is simple and so delicious! I used Peppermint instead of Vanilla (I didn't have any Vanilla) and it was still great! I would definitely only put 1 or 2 drops of Peppermint! Great Recipe!

Made this for a chilly October cookout recently. It was a huge hit, & I had to make more. Have had multiple requests for the recipe. I used a 12 oz can of evaporated milk, & 2 1/2 cups whole milk, omitting the whipping cream.

Way too sweet as written. I'm glad I read some reviews first.  Even 1/2 cup of sugar was too sweet for us. But the flavour is fine, and with heavy cream in place of the half and half, it had really nice body (my milk is 1%).  It helps to use a good quality cocoa powder, both for flavour and to avoid bitterness.

I was craving hot chocolate on a cold, rainy Sunday, and I noticed the great reviews with this recipe, so I tried it.  It was great!  I took the advice of others and only added 1/2 cup sugar.  I somehow forgot to add the vanilla, but I did add about 1/2 tsp. cinnamon - delicious!  Rich, but not too rich.  The half and half thickened it just a bit for a nice texture.  I will be making this again!

This recipe shows homemade hot chocolate is easy and delicious.  No need to break the bank at Starbucks.  Like others, I cut back on the sugar.   Want to really pimp it up?  Add about 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of cayenne to turn it into Mexican hot chocolate.  Mmmmm.

I needed a quick recipe for hot cocoa - and as ususal allrecipes did not let me down. Found this one and it is just as good as described!  I didn't even have the half and half which I'm sure would have been a bonus.  The kids loved it!

This was excellent and I do agree with other reviews about the sugar 1/4-1/2 cup would be sufficient, otherwise it's extremely sweet. I my daughter and I have a very sweet tooth! Will be making this often.

Excellent! The soup was wonderfully thick so the only thing I did differently was to add some V8 juice so the soup would have more broth. ( I guess I could have added beef broth or tomato sauce as well. )

Ever since I tasted what can only be described as chocolate heaven, the perfect thickness and taste, I longed for a recipe to help me get started and here it is! Thanks a bunch for sharing and as an FYI - it's still perfect if you remove the cream!

Awesome. Kids wanted hot cocoa on a snow day and we were out of the box stuff. Easy to make, and gave results that pleased. What more could you ask for?

For a warm cup of comfort, just pour a mug and slowly sip it by the fireplace.  I've made this several times in the last few weeks, we live in Alaska and haven't seen a temp over -5 in weeks!!  My hubby requested this yesterday before he was even off work.  He  keeps planes flying in Alaska weather and gets quite chilled, so when he asked, I had it waiting for him when he got home.  Plenty left for the kids as they came in from ski parctice too.  Everyone was warm and cozy in no time!!!  This is a very creamy, sweet and chocolatey wonder that cocoa lovers will appreciate.

Best thing ever! Add nutmeg, and being me, more vanilla--- but besides the oddly large sugar amount, this cream filled treat is worth one (or two) tries!

I made this recipe for my father and brother the other day to accompany a batch of snickerdoodles and they absolutely loved it. I ended up reducing the sugar from 3/4 cup to 1/2 cup like many reviewers suggested and it is just the right sweetness that way. I also did not have half and half, so I ended up not adding anything at the end and I had no problems.

Outstanding!! Just served this to 4 kids out playing in the snow and they are giddy with excitement over it.  One little girl has told me 5 times how much she loves it. As for the comments on this being too sweet...not for these kiddos! It's perfect!

My wife and I were going to go out to a fancy restaurant for hot cocoa and desert for our anniversary, but the kids got sick.  So my wife whipped this up in what seemed like seconds.  As I held the mug of cocoa in my grip the earthly choclotey heavenly aroma filled my soul with contentness.  ok-It was great!  Good for a date night!

At first this was a really great hot cocoa recipe.  Then I got hit with an after taste.  Not sure if that is normal but I followed the recipe to a T.  Hmm.. I'll keep looking for a great hot cocoa recipe.

Rich yet not overly sweet. Even the most amateur chef can get this right (my boyfriend made it for us!). Great with some cookies on a cold rainy night.

This hot cocoa was great my friend and I add a pinch of cinnamon and a candy cane and let me tell you we both agree that we will never buy instant hot cocoa again! I have not tried it with half and half yet cause i never have any but I cant wait to try that in it.

i made this a couple nights ago after my stepdad randomly asked me to make homemade hot chocolate because the packet  is gross. i quickly did a google search and found this; i was a little weary about doing it because i was looking to make more of a hot cocoa MIX instead of actually doing the chocolate base + milk. but i'm so glad i did! this recipe is SO yummy! it's creamy and rich and just downright good. although, it was a little sweet...that's not a bad thing. i think next time i might down it to about 1/2 cup of sugar instead.

Very good recipe! I am sipping some leftover from what I made last night as I write this review.  I did not add the cream after I divided this in the mugs, I put it in the pot with the whole mixture. I doubled the recipe and it worked fine. I will definately make this recipe again.

Yep, absolutely fabulous. I used raw cow's milk, and skimmed off some cream to use for the half and half. Doubled the recipe with no trouble, but used only 1/2 cup of sugar per recipe and it was plenty sweet!

This hot chocolate was amazing! My 5-yr-old little sister won't drink hot chocolate without marshmallows, and when i gave her some and she drank it, she asked if the marshmallows had melted! I had no half-and-half, so i made the recipe without it and it was still very good. I'm making this for christmas with the family!

We loved it. Made it two nites in a row. I made it with cocoa mix I had in the house that had some sugar in it. Since it did, I only added 1/3 of a cup of sugar. Also I made it with 1 percent milk. It was so yummy

Creamy and good, but like a lot of people have said, VERY SWEET.  Cut back on the amount of sugar for sure!  I can't even finish my mug!

1/2 cup of sugar, it was really good-but  slightly sweet. We added a dash of mint/peppermint extract.

I've tried several basic cocoa recipes in the past week, including the one from the side of the cocoa container, and this one is the best so far. A great starting point to get creative with or good just like it is.

SO decadent.  I decreased the sugar to 1/2 c., as I usually do in recipes, and it was still sweet enough for us.

As other reviews have suggested this is incredibly sweet.  Children would love it but I would probably decrease the amount of sugar next time.  I also used heavy whipping cream instead of half-and-half.

Not to bad, but im a tweeker, when it comes to recipes. I added only about 1/2 of sugar, about 1/2 a cup of cocoa powder, and then instead of the cream, i put on some whip cream and a little bit of chocolate syrup just to give it more of a chocolate taste. tastes great!! :)

I love home made hot cocoa, but this one was too sweet for my taste.  Next time I'll try 1/2 c. sugar instead.  Otherwise, it's a nice base recipe.

Wow! This was great- I'll never buy cocoa mix again!  I made a half batch, reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, and used heavy cream instead of half and half and it was perfect. Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this often!

Nice and rich hot cocoa. This would be awesome in the winter months by the fire. I made mine with Splenda, skim milk and used twice the hot water asked for. Seeing as this was low fat sugar free it came out great. I can just imagine how delicious the original recipe would be. thanx for sharing

Amaaaazing! I will never buy a box of hot cocoa mix again! I do admit that I had to omit the half and half, simply because I didn't have any.  I used milk in it's place. Next time, I will definitely use half and half and will probably have to give it 6 stars!

My fiance and I love this recipe. I pretty much kept it the same, I made it, like two teaspoons less sugar, I just made it 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla, which seemed to perfect it.  We also don't add the cream at the end.  But its amazing, I've made it for company lots of times, and its always a hit.

YUM!  We were fine with the sweetness this time but I could see making a more bittersweet version at some point in the future.  On a snow day though?  Sweet it up, please!  :)

This was very easy and delicious! My kids loved it! I've made it twice in the past two days. We ran out of vanilla so I used almond extract instead. It was great! Many compliments! We also added a dollop of whipped cream.

We rang in the new year with this hot cocoa and it was a hit with the kids, but I found it to be too sweet, so next time I'll either use a full 4 cups of milk or use only 1/2 cup of sugar. Overall, it was very good, very simple and quick.

I thought this cocoa was OK.  I used 1/2 cup of sugar and still found it very sweet. (My tongue feels a little "furry" now!)  Maybe next time I'll use 1/3 cup sugar.

I love this hot coco, I have always made it on an individual basis, 1 heaping teaspoon of coco powered, 2 heaping teaspoons of sugar, a pinch of salt and mug full of milk.  No water, nor half & half, however, I like the idea of vanilla.  This is a Christmas morning favorite for my two sons.  Will let you know how the vanilla goes with the boys.

It might be right off the Hershey box, but it's 10 times better then the other recipe I tried! Might actually have a bit to much cocoa, will try it with less...   And I added about 1/8 tsp of cinnamon (the only good thing from the other recipe) and it's GREAT! Topped with marshmallows...  yummmm

I am drinking this Hot Chocolate as I write this and it is wonderful! I added the recommended amount of sugar but put 1 1/3 water instead of the 1/3 recommended. I also added 1 tablespoon of vanilla instead of the 3/4 because I love the flavor of it. I will make this again!

It was very good... too sweet as others have stated (I forgot to read the reviews before making).  Next time I will decrease the sugar significantly and I'm sure it will be absolutely perfect!  We will be making this frequently this winter since I usually always have these ingredients.

This was pretty good- I'll definitely use the recipe again.  My changes: I cut the sweeteners (I used stevia instead of sugar) to the equivalent of 1/4 cup sugar.  Honestly, I found it too sweet still, but my fiance liked it.  I added a tablespoon of lite French Vanilla liquid coffee creamer and skipped the half and half.  Topped the whole thing off with some fresh whipped cream and chocolate sugar.  Rich and creamy and really what I wanted when the temp dipped to 60 the other night!

Nice Hot chocolate pretty much the same as on the back of the container of Hershey's cocoa powder. I topped with fluff, nice for a rainy day.

Definitely plenty sweet with half the sugar.  I used soymilk because that's all I had on hand.  It was a teeny bit on the gritty side, but maybe that was the soy, not the cocoa. Either way, very yummy!

I love this! Unlike many other recipes I use, I don't adapt this one at all. It's great making a serving for myself, or enough for all of my roommates. I love adding whipped cream (not the fake stuff!) and sometimes even peppermint schnapps on a really cold day!

This hot chocalate is very creamy and delicious.  I would really recommend using dark chocolate powder for chocolate lovers

I almost like winter just because of this wonderful drink. Almost. As stated in previous reviews I added the smaller amount of sugar.

I made this exactly as instructed, and I found it was just a little sweet for me. Next time I will ease up on the sugar a bit, and make it a little creamier.  My 2 1/2 year old daughter, however, had no complaints!

Giving it 5 stars even though I wasn't precise with the recipe.  I'm sure as written, it deserves 6 stars!  We didn't have any 1/2 & 1/2 and I was out of my usual substitutes as well (evap milk, heavy cream).  So I completely skipped that part. I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup because of previous reviews and personally I thought the extra sugar would have been fine. Cocoa is supposed to be sweet, folks! :)   Next time I'll follow the recipe precisely.  The 1/2 & 1/2 is already on the shopping list...

Oops!  Forgot the vanilla, but it was still AWESOME!  I only put in about half of the sugar, too.  Next time, I'll make a double batch...yum!

This was a wonderful winter treat!  Like other reviewers, I added only 1/2 c. of sugar and it was perfect.  It was still hot after adding the cream, so I topped it with a generous dollop of peppermint ice cream.  Sinfully delicious!!!

This is excellent, but I didn't use the cream at the end. Also, maybe it's just me, but Nestle cocoa seems to taste better than Hershey's.

Tasty but far too sweet.  I ended up adding more coco and milk to decrease the sweetness.  Also just fine without adding cream - very yummy.

I just made this. I used 3/4 cups of sugar but I probably should have went with 1/2 cup. But overall, I think this is great and pretty easy to make.

It was very good and a lot stronger than the typical store bought mixes.  My kids were a big fan of it and it worked well in almond milk as well (which I had made half the recipe with).

Best homemade hot cocoa ever!  Don't hesitate to try this recipe, and don't change anything about it!  I made it as an alternative to tea for my little girl's tea party, and it was a big hit!  Very creamy, and just the right amount of chocolate and sugar!  You definitely want to try this!  :)

I took advice of others and used 1/2 cup sugar.  I made extra of the "dry" ingredients and have on hand to make some more cocoa by just adding the milk and vanilla.  Thanks for the recipe :)

I didn't get to try any of this so I am going with what my kids said... My youngest daughter LOVES chocolate said this was great! She even looked for some later in the day and was disappointed to know there wasn't any left! The other 2 girls said it was too sweet to drink with the Fluffy French Toast (recipe from this site), but said it was really good! The kids even called my mom to tell them what a great breakfast we had!

I started out the recipe the same and then I realized I didn't have milk. Instead, I mixed in 1 1/2 cups of half-and-half and 2 cups of water. I used about a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and it worked great. I didn't add the half-and-half at the end either because it didn't really need it.

Really good and easy! I really wanted hot chocolate but didn't want to go to the store and luckily I had all these ingredients! It turned out great. I only put a dash of vanilla in because I don't like it, and that was still too much. So next time I will leave that out all together. But this is a great recipe and I will be using it again soon!

Perfect taste of chocolate and I always love the addition of the salt.  It gives this hot cocoa the extra touch I enjoy.  I was out of half & half so I just left it out and this was still excellent.  Thank you for a great chocolaty drink recipe...too bad these restaurants and vending machines cant duplicate this.  I always find those places to have watered down hot choc. and I just hate it.  This is the real deal :)

I really like the final product and would only change the amount of sugar. I think it was too sweet, so I'll take the 3/4 c. sugar down to a max. of 1/2 c. sugar when I make this again. Great recipe!

I used the website to scale it down to one serving.  I enjoyed it, but it was too sweet for my taste.  The next time I will cut back on the sugar.

This was an exceptional recipe. I tried the full amount of sugar and the 1/2 cup that everyone recommended and they both were good, but I preferred using a little bit less than 1/2 a cup just because I like my chocolate a little on the not-so-sweet side. Extremely easy to make. Thank you.

Fabulous!  I used 1/4 c. cocoa and a little less than 1/2 c. sugar - it was sweet enough and chocolatey enough for us!

I've never had real hot cocoa before, always stuff from a can or a box. It's pretty good. I didn't have cream and was 1/2 a cup short on the milk quota, so it's very chocolatey and sort of thick that way. It's all right, I will have to try it again!

This recipe was pretty good. I used less than 1/2 cup sugar, and I left out the half-and-half. It was creamy and not too sweet. I also added whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon on top.

I agree with the others. Reduce the sugar to just under 1/2 cup and it's perfect. I used whole milk as well for a creamier texture.

Very good!  I used 1/2 white sugar instead of 3/4 cup white sugar as other reviews suggested and it turned out perfect.  The name is right too, it's nice and creamy!  I put some Reddi Whip and chocolate sprinkles on top.  Big hit with the hubby and kids!

Delicious! Did make a few changes to suit my taste buds..... when I removed it from the heat I added a 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract & 1 cup half-and-half. Then when I served it I put a spoonful of Cool Whip on top!

We just got back from a cold, chilly day out at a Christmas parade.  This hot cooca was superb!  Quick to make and waaaay better than a packet.  A perfect way to take the chill off and get all snuggly at home with the family.

I didn't have vanilla extract, so I used 3/4 tsp. coconut extract. It was deeelicious!! Way better than if I had used vanilla extract. I also cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and I didn't have the half & half, so I just added some coffee creamer. UMM, UMM, UMM!

This was really good, and I am a hot chocolate lover.  My 8 year old daughter said it was delicious.  I cut the sugar to half too.  I also added in some bittersweet chocolate chips with the cocoa.

This was really fun to make and my husband and I really enjoyed it. My kids would have been happy with the boxed version- they didn't think it was worth all of the trouble, so I will probably only make it for special occasions. But great taste!

Delicious and tasty cocoa, perfect on a cold day :) I shortened the recipe to 2 cups for me and my brother and omitted the cream. The amount of sugar overwhelmed the taste a bit so I'll use less next time. Still, excellent recipe!

After playing outside all day in the cold snow, grandma always had hot cocoa waiting for us. This is the Best Hot Cocoa recipe. Grandma always gave us a Candy Cane to stir our Hot cocoa, it was a nice treat. My kids enjoyed this recipe more than I did. Thanks!

I give this 5+ stars!  I don't even like hot drinks, but this has changed my mind.  Forget powdered mixes from the store.  This is so easy and so good.  I followed the recipe except for replacing the half and half with cool whip.

Very good cocoa, but a little too sweet.. Next time, I'll either cut back on the sugar or else I'll add more milk. But a very good recipe! Adding a little sprinkle of cinnamon makes it even more delicious. Thank you!
