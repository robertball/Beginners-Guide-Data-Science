This recipes is delicious.  I made minor modifications -- cooked the cabbage and onions till very soft, used 2 cups cottage cheese, and added 1 lb. sliced, browned, & drained turkey kielbasa.  It was a very good main dish.  My husband (who's not very fond of cabbage) had two BIG servings!!

What a great combination. The sauce is so creamy! I have made this recipe 3 times, It really goes well with the Garlic herb grilled Pork Tenderloin recipe published by Party Chef, another great recipe!

What a flavorful dish.  The cabbage and noodles are marked as a sidedish, but truthfully, I would like it for a main dish!  The cottage cheese makes a creamy, lower-fat alternative to cream cheese.  Very flavorful with a crunchy bite.

My Ukrainian grandmother "Baba" made this too.  Instead ogf spaghetti noodles, she made her own egg noodles.  It was delicious.  When she left the cottage cheese out, she called it "Haluski."  Mom made it at home and when in a hurry, she used stor bought egg noodles.  We ate it as a side dish without the cottage cheese.  If it had the cottage cheese in it, it was the main course with a piece of coursely sliced home-made Ukrainian bread (paska.)  Yum---comfort food.  The above recipe is easy to follow and very close to my Baba's.

This was delicious!  I've made something similar before, but not quite like this.  The cottage cheese really makes it good, but yet you hardly notice it's in there.  The whole family gave it a "thumbs up!"

I tweeked this a little by adding fresh garlic and unsalted butter to the cabbage and onions. I too added 2 cups cottage cheese and then some shredded parmesan cheese after it was heated through.

I used less margarine. Cooked the cabbage down a bit first before I added the onion. Let that cook down some more then added a diced green apple and two cloves of garlic. Used a bit more sugar. Doubled the cottage cheese- Used the creamed variety. Sliced and cooked some turkey sausage then added when everything else was done. Would use another apple and a little more garlic next time. The man added cashews to his- He liked the crunch these gave the dish. Served with "J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits" from AR.

Very good!  I did make a few changes.  I used egg noodles, and even though I made the whole pound, I found I only needed a little more than half.  I omitted the sugar, and added some caraway seeds.  These were delicious in there!  I probably used about a cup and a half of cottage cheese.  Had it with grilled brats, hubby and I both loved it!  Great recipe, thanks!

I made a corned beef in the oven and wanted cabbage made separate.  I found this recipe.  I added 1/2 granny smith apple and used 3 tablespoons of sour cream because I did not have cottage cheese.  Next time I want to use the cottage cheese. What a delicious recipe and we had no leftovers!

Almost as good as Babcia's...but nothing is as good as a Babcia can cook.  We used bow tie pasta because we had it, but the rest was as written.  Just what we wanted...a taste of childhood.

We loved this simple dish of pasta, cabbage and onions.  I went looking for a side to go with 'Meatloaf with a Bite' from AR and found this recipe in my box.  It was exactly what I was looking for and the finished product went nicely with the meatloaf.  I used cavatappi pasta in place of the spaghetti noodles, but kept everything else the same.  I also served 'Creamy Kale Salad' from AR, but this is the dish that stole the show at dinner tonight.  Thanks, Party Chef for sharing your recipe.  It will be repeated in our house.

I used this as a base and added some chopped hot pickled peppers and a bit of cayenne to the cabbage mixture. I browned up some bratwurst and put them on top of the cabbage to finish cooking. I used eggs noodles. I added the cottage cheese and remaining butter plus a couple spoonfuls of sour cream. Forgot about the sugar and didn't seem to matter. My husband was gobbling it down and I loved it too. Thanks for the recipe - I would never have thought about combining cabbage and noodles.

This is so delicious and easy to make! I made just some slight changes. Instead of 3/4 cup margarine, I used 1 tablespoon olive oil and 2 tablespoons butter when cooking until tender.  I then substituted low fat ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese. a sugar substitute and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and 2 tablespoons butter.

i added about 5 cloves of garlic while sauteing and sliced up some italian sausage.  one cup of the cottage cheese didn't seem like enough so i added two but my head of cabbage was on the bigger side.  this made a TON but it reheats well.

It sounded like an awful combination - but it tastes fantastic!  My family loved it.  I used macoroni instead of spaghetti and tweaked the spices, as it seemed a little bland to me as is.

I must have missed the boat on this recipe cuz neither my husband or I liked it.  We added kielbasa as someone had suggested, and that turned out to be the only ingredient which we appreciated.  We really didn't thing pasta and cabbage mixed very well.  I'll stick to my other cabbage recipes.

Big 411: 16oz spaghetti = 3c. 4oz medium noodles = 3c.  Soooo, if you're thinking of adding a pound of egg noodles, etc, you're in for a lot of pasta - & that additional cup of cottage cheese that is mentioned several times in the reviews.  I used 4 oz egg noodles & the one cup.  It was enough, but more would've been fine, too.  'Not the prettiest dish; but I liked it, didn't love it.  'Don't think the sugar is really a haveto.

this was good but not great. i added ham to make it a main course. i wasnt sure if i was supposed to melt the cottage cheese into the margarine sauce completely but i didnt like the chunks of it in the margarine. i was expecting something more like turos czsuso. once i melted the cottage cheese it was more appealing. made it like a sour cream sauce. i would suggest decreasing the amount of margarine.

We all liked this.  I asked my husband what to rate it and he said "4" so there you have it.

I used egg noodles and since I was half a cup shy on the cottage cheese I added 1/2 a cup of cream cheese.  

This recipe make a ton. If I made it again, I might half the recipe or lighten up on the noodles.

Terrific recipe.  I only gave it 4 starts because it needed more cottage cheese and some garlic.   And I cooked the cabbage down a bit until quite soft.

I'm cooking for two, so halved the recipe. Used 14 oz of cabbage - don't know how I would have gotten it all in the skillet, which was 12", if I'd made the full recipe. Like other reviewers, I used twice as much cottage cheese called for, so in my case, 1 C. I also added 6 oz of kielbasa after the cabbage and onion had been cooking down a bit so made it a meal rather than a side. Yum! Will definitely make again.

Not enough flavor. Missing something- not sure what.

I like this recipe because it is so simple and has enough protein to be a vegetarian dish.  It is slightly on the bland side without some modifications, though. I added 2 cloves of garlic based on suggestions by other reviewers.  After tasting it, I sprinkled some caraway seeds on top. Next time, I will add these while sauteeing the onion and cabbage - they add a good depth of flavor. The butter is a bit excessive and the dish was just fine with less (I used a total of 1/2 cup.)  Next time I may try substituting some sour cream for the butter when the noodles are done.  This dish needs a heavy hand with the salt.  I liked it without meat, but my husband thinks it needs some meat.  Overall, it is a simple comfort food dish, and I will definitely make it again with these modifications.

i added some shredded cheese and also onion salt, garlic salt...i do agree with one review it is a very bland meal...but what do you expect...it is cottage cheese and noodles...so you have to kind of spice it up...i think the key to this is to add maybe another onion to get it to lean over to an onion type flavor meal type deal...i did very much like the taste once i added cheese and onion salt but i wished i had added one more onion to take it over the top...this dish is great for a meatless meal...although you do add cottage cheese not completely vegan but for those of us trying to get there great choice or just use very small amount of cc...since you are only using a cup anyways...but my first thought was this would be so good with sliced spicy vegan sausage through it...the ones that are a little spicy in the vege...section of the market...so good together...but all in all i enjoyed this and really easy to make....

This was just OK, and I think would have been really blah! without some of the modifications I made.  I used a half-pound of pasta and two cups of cottage cheese, and it was still barely enough cottage cheese to the amount of pasta.  I didn't use a stick and a half of butter (I don't use margarine), as the recipe calls for, but only a half-stick, and granted anything swimming in butter will taste pretty good, if I were going to add that many extra calories, I think I'd just add a couple of cups of shredded cheddar, or some sour cream.  More flavor bang for the calorie buck.  I doubt I'll make this again.  Sautéed, partially caramelized cabbage and onion is delicious on its own; as a side to a good mac & cheese, I think it would taste better than combined in this recipe.

This was ok, kind of bland.  Actually, I was very suprised we didn't care for it because our family loves cabbage and noodles!  I used egg noodles, and as other suggested, added some sliced turkey kielbasa at the end.  Overall, I was very disappointed because the recipe got such high ratings and sounded so yummy.
