I had such high hopes for this dip.  I made it with very short notice for a group of people coming to my house and was pretty disappointed in it.  While the recipe makes a massive amount of dip (easily enough for 10 people IMHO), all we could taste was green onion.  The flavour of the crab....everything in fact, was lost through the green onion.  I may try this recipe again and will cut it in half and I will also cut the amount of green onion in half.

My family doesn't like imitation Krab, so I changed the recipe to the real thing. Excellent!For a slight variation, add finely grated Parmesan cheese to this dip.

Thanks to all of you who like my recipe! I have a NEW twist on this for all of you watching your figure. I replaced the cream cheese, sour cream, and mayo with both "light" versions and "fat free" versions. Both were equally good. No one seemed to notice. Fat free mayo however tends to be a tad sweeter. :-) Happy cooking!!!

I like the texture of the dip but found it a little bland. I added Old Bay Seafood seasoning to taste and liked that much better.

Very good.  Scaled the recipe down for 8 servings and added 1 tsp seasoned salt.
Was a hit with the late night neighbor crowd.

This crab dip is fabulous both as a dip and as a sandwich filling!  It does make a TON but if you like crab go ahead and make the full recipe - that being said, I've made this with imitation crab meat and it is just fine with the substitute.  Last time I made this as one of 3 appetizers at a BBQ for 6 people.  Half got eaten the day of the BBQ.  The next day we were going on a road trip - perfect sandwich filler on some italian rolls!!  My boyfriend and I both love this recipe.

Tasty dip w/ some tweaking.  I added about a 1/4 cup less each of the mayo and sour cream as it just seemed like a lot.  I also added Old Bay seasoning and a few dashes of hot sauce to give it some kick.  I think it would have been on the bland side had I not added those things.  I also cut way back on the green onions because I didn't want them to overtake the entire dish.  ETA: Made this again and added about half the amount of mayo and sour cream this time and a couple tablespoons of cocktail sauce and it was really good this way.

We recently had a clambake so I thought this would make a good appetizer.  I cut the sour cream and mayonnaise in half to cut down on the fat and added a few shakes of Natures Seasoning (my secret ingredient for everything that I make) from Morton Salt and it still tasted very good.  I served it with Townhouse crackers and it was a huge hit.

kind of bland on first go round but i like the idea of the lighter mayo, cream cheese and sour cream. after making and tasting it, i added Old Bay Seasoning, chopped up dill pickle (or dill relish), chopped up fire roasted red peppers (the kind in a jar), finely chopped celery and hot sauce. Went through half a sleeve of ritz crackers but turned out great. next time i'll add salad shrimp and chopped hard boiled eggs.

This is an awesome  dip. Party worthy!!! I will serve it at our next social. Yesterday I made the "Easy Shrimp Scampy"that is on this site and I made it with crab. We had like 2 lbs. of this left over and I told my husband we would never eat this much so we could rinse it off and make crab dip. I found this recipe,doubled it and wala recycled food. It made so much we are taking some to my mom,sister and bro-in-law,and cousin. Still leaving us with more than enough to snack on to night while watching movies!!! YAH!  Thanks!!!

I make this all the time with left over salmon, chicken, etc.  always a winner.  I don't measure when I cook and have done several variations of this recipe including adding redhot or pecans.  I have served it with different crackers and / or celery and other vegi 's. thanks for the recipe.

Overall I think this is a great recipe. You can't complain about the easiness of it!! I used Hellman's Low Fat mayo and fat free sour cream to cut down on the fat content - kept each to 1 cup.  I did not put in 1 cup of the chopped green onions - closer to 1/2 to 3/4 cup.  I used 3 cans of the crab meat - 18oz so just over 1lb which helped to make it thicker.  I think the KEY to anything with crabs is OLD BAY seasoning.  As I as mixing this I kept testing it until it got the right "kick" to it.   Definitely multiple tablespoons worth. Thank you for sharing/posting~

UPDATED: I have made this countless times and my tweaked version has become my most requested appetizer for all parties and get-togethers. I stand by that this is a good base for crab dip. It absolutely needs more oomph! Try diced red or green bell peppers (or both!) or diced jalapenos. Definitely add lemon and LOTS of black pepper and Old Bay Seasoning. I often use nonfat plain Greek yogurt in lieu of sour cream, and it turns out just as great. IF (big if) you have leftovers, they work great as crab salad sandwiches too. 

********************** 

I made this for the first tailgate of the season and it's a good base for a delicious crab dip. I added Old Bay Seasoning, black pepper, and a diced fresh jalapeno.

Made this for football/NASCAR Sunday afternoon for DH and myself.  Didn't read reviews till after I made it.  I cut the onion to 3 green onions chopped super fine, and added worchestershire sauce, Old Bay and a few shakes of green Tabasco (don't tell DH).  Also added a can of small shrimp and a can of white crab; both rinsed well. DH loved it and wants it again.

This dip was quick and easy..and made a ton of tip. We loved it with veggie thin crackers!  We did add some diced up cucumber instead of the green onion, and the light taste and little bit of crunch was perfect!

I only gave 4 stars because my family found it had too much green onion. 2nd time I made it I read some review cut back green onion to 1/2 cup and added celery and red pepper to make up other 1/2 cup, some shreaded motz. cheese and 1/2 tsp horse radish. It was great. Thanks for the wonderful recipe and the great reviews.

This recipe as it stands is probably not something I would make again, and will likely just try to find something else next time. It completely lacks seasoning, and in order to make it tasty we added tobasco, horseradish, parmesan, garlic salt, and old bay seasoning (I'd add a fair amount of all since it's such a big recipe). Also, I used real crab meat instead of imitation based on other people's reviews--but be prepared for the expense!

I made this for a Christmas in July party with the addition of some diced jalopena peppers.  Everyone loved it.

Wasn't a hit at all- it seemed a little bland- should have read the reviews on suggestions of what to add!

Excellant! I'm a real crab lover so I had to use real dungenous crab. Other than that what a simple and tasty recipe. Two thumbs up!

I modified this recipe slightly but it turned out really well and was a hit at Christmas!  I used about half the mayo and substituted a 1/2 pound of lobster meat and a 1/2 pound of crab meat to make it more of a seafood dip.  I only used a small handful of green onions as the cup specified would have overpowered this yummy appetizer.

This was the best crab dip I've ever tasted! I too cut the mayo and sour cream in half.  I only had 12 ounces of the imitation crab to work with, so I knew I wouldn't need quite as much.  I didn't have real mayo, so I used Miracle Whip light and it was still off the charts delish!

I used only a 14 oz package of imitation crab. I also added a little salt and pepper. It received a lot of compliments despite the fact that I forgot to bring my crackers and we used tortilla chips instead!

It was a hit!  I made 3/4 of the recipe to use up previously opened ingredients.  Worked out well and still made a lot!  I only used a few a Tbs of chopped green onion.

I made this once five years ago and I thought I lost the recipe - it has haunted me! Obviously five years later I found it - I’m so happy! This is the best recipe to satisfy your desire for a tasty treat!

I agree with some of the other reviewers.  It definitely needed to be spiced up a bit.  I used Old Bay seasoning as well as celery, horse radish, and a dash of hot sauce.  It was a crowd favorite!  I also used real crab meat, since I don't care for the imitation crab.  It also tasted better after the flavors blended overnight.

This recipe was okay.  I made it as written (with lowfat/fat free options)and it turned out pretty bland.  So I added the Old Bay seasoning and it had a bit more flavor, but not enough for me.  I served it at a weekend get together and the guests seemed to like it.  All around I think it was liked, just not loved.

I think this is a great starter recipe.  I was looking for something with alittle more zest.  Next time I'll try adding pepper or maybe paprika.  This is great with veggies or a warm bread.
