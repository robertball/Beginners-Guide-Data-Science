Delicious and this can be cooked much faster!  I browned a 1 lb. tenderloin (for 2 people) in a deep, oven proof skillet, then added some of the sauerkraut juice and kraut to the pan to quickly deglaze it and then followed the rest of the directions.  Increased oven temp to 400 degrees and it was done in 40 min.  Served it with mashed potatoes and buttered rye bread.

I made this for my boyfriend, who is half-German, and crazy about pork & sauerkraut.  He raved about it!  I made the following modifications - I used a crock pot (7 hours on low) and added 1/2 cup water & 1/2 cup apple juice.  I also added a little more chopped apple and onion to the crock pot.  It turned out incredibly tender and tasty.  This is a really easy, quick recipe that I will be happy to prepare again & again.

Wow!  This was wonderful!  It was so easy to throw together, and after being in the oven for 2 1/2 hours, the pork was SO tender!  My husband and I love sauerkraut, so this was a big hit to find!  My 5 year old son even thought this was outstanding, and he cleaned his plate.  We will definitely be using this recipe again.  Thanks, Bonnie!

I made this in the crock pot as a previous reviewer suggested.  It was wonderful. I never knew I liked sauerkraut so much!  Serve with mashed potatoes and applesauce.  Oh my gosh! Truly comfort food!

WONDERFUL!  You can follow the recipe exactly and have a fantastic meal with little prep.  I added some extra sage and garlic salt and we LOVED it! Served it with carrots:  1 bag mini carrots, 1/2 apple chopped, 1/4 cup butter, sprinkle with brown sugar, cover and bake 2 hours with the pork - perfect!

Couldn't have been easier! I assembled it in a 9 x 13" baking dish and covered it with aluminum foil. It was done in a litle under two hours. I also sliced the apple and onion in quarters, to spread the flavor out a litle more. Typically, I'm not a fan of sauerkraut, but I couldn't get enough of this stuff! A+!

We loved this easy Main Dish. I had never fixed pork and sauerkraut, but my husband requested it for New Years.  So after looking at several recipes this is the one we chose.  Even my picky eater tasted and liked the sauerkraut!  It was moist, easy, and tasted fabulous.  A good pick.

Made this for company and it did not turn out well at all.  First of all I checked the temp of the meat at 2 hours (the low end of cooking time) and it was well over 160.  Consequently it was all dried out.  The temp needs to be checked early and often. Also, if you like the taste of sauerkraut leave out the apples, onions and sugar.  I think these modifications gave it an odd flavor, mellowed the tang too much, in my opinion.

Excellent!  I used a 4lb pork tenderloin and doubled everything except for the sauerkraut.  Was done in a little under 2 hours.  Tender, moist and delicious.  The combination of a granny smith apple, brown sugar, onion and the kraut leaves a tangy, not too sweet, not too sour taste and gives you some succulent pork.  My husband and I LOVED it.

Excellent recipe!  I used slightly less sugar and used the whole apple (it was pretty small).  I assembled this in my crockpot and cooked on low for 5.5 hrs and YUM!    I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!  Warning to SAUERkraut lovers:  this is what I call a "sweet-kraut" recipe, which is obvious from the ingredient list.  Know this in advance so the finished product doesn't make you go "eww."

This was really good!  I followed another reviewers advice and also added chopped apple and onion to the sauerkraut, 1/2 c water and 1/2 c apple juice and cooked it in the crockpot on low all day...pork was fall apart tender...my husband was afraid the sauerkraut would be overpowering, but it wasn't, it was delicious... but next time I would probably use half the amount of sauerkraut, there was enough sauerkraut left over to feed an army!  Thanks for the great recipe, will definitely make again and again.

I made this in my crock pot. Let it cook 6 hrs. 
It was really good. Even my husband liked it and he usually turns his nose up at kraut. The pork was tender and the kraut had just the right amount of sweetness and tanginess. Can't wait to eat the left overs tomorrow. Thank you allrecipes.com for another great meal.

I love this recipe. I took it to a Church supper and then had to send the recipe to everyone. My daughter makes this in her crockpot. Goes great with sour cream potatoes and a spinach salad.

Apparently many people posting recipes (this is not the only recipe) don't know the diff between pork loin and pork tenderloin.  No way tenderloin needs to be cooked 2-3 hours, an internal temp of 150 should be reached in 30-45 minutes.

Fast, easy, and tastes great.  I added more apples and onions, but that's just me!  Leftovers are great on ciabatta bread with whole grain mustard.

This is absolutely fabulous!!  Just like the description says, the tenderloin melts in your mouth.  The only change I made was that I sliced the onion and apple and alternately laid them on top of the first layer of saurekraut.  This is going to be one of the regular dishes at our home.  Yummy!!

I loved the flavor and I especially liked the way the sauerkraut came out.   I removed it from the oven as soon as the temperature hit 160 (about 2 hours).   However, it was just a little too dry for me.     Keeping pork moist is often an issue.   In general, I think using a crock pot is the best option with most pork dishes.

This recipe, as written, is not that good.  The pork came out very dry.  The sauerkraut was wonderful with the brown sugar, apples and onions but the pork was not that good. I  would not make again.

I have made this three times for New Years Day.  Pork and sauerkraut is a tradition where I'm from for good luck in the new year.  This could not be easier!  The tenderloins just fall apart with forks.  I've doubled the recipe in a larger Pyrex and layer sauerkraut on the bottom, place the tenderloins over the bottom layer and then add the onions/apples and cover with more kraut.  They are buried in the kraut.  Cover with aluminum foil, very tightly.  That is the key to sealing in the moisture.  This comes out perfectly every time.

Was looking for something for my pork roast using sauerkraut. The apple added a good taste as did the onion.  Only thing I didn't add was the brown sugar. We love sauerkraut, so didn't want a sugary taste to it. Had it in the oven for about 2 hours. This was very good, AND there are leftovers!

I love kraut, but did not care for this. Followed the recipe. I didn't care for the flavor and the kraut was ruined. What a waste.

This is fab-u-lous!  Made this for my traditional New Years Day meal.  It's very easy and delicious.  I rubbed the pork with a little olive oil, poultry seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I used 2 27 oz. cans of sauerkraut.  I also used the whole onion and apple - sliced both crosswise - to spread out the flavor.  I wasn't sure about the brown sugar but used it anyway and it was great!!  The pork just falls apart, so tender.  Definitely a keeper.

I hate sauerkraut, but my husband loves it, so I made this for him.  Neither of us liked this dish at all.  Way too sweet (and I halved the brown sugar too).

This dish was very good. I have never made anything with sauerkraut before, but wanted to try it. I didn't measure my ingredients, just sprinkled and rubbed on the sage and garlic powder all over the tendeloin. I also added a few cloves of fresh garlic. I chopped the apple and used dried onion flakes since I was out of fresh. My tenderloin was done just under two hours, but I still had a lot of time before dinner, so I decreased the oven temp to 300 and let it cook another hour longer. When I took it out of the oven, the meat nearly fell apart, it was so tender and juicy. (I did not drain the kraut, but added all the juice in with the meat.)I felt that the kraut was very good, but would have liked it to be a bit sweeter. I will add more brown sugar next time. My husband and I both enjoyed it, but the kids decided sauerkraut is not on their favorites list. I don't blame them, I don't think I liked it as a kid either. All in all a great recipe I will try again. Thanks!

I actually made these into porkchops and they had great flavor and were really tender.  However, for me, they just lacked that extra "oomph" to be a 5-star recipe.

Made this in a slow cooker following the recipe and turned out  great!  I'm not a huge saurkraut fan, but this simmered enough to make it mellow and yummy.

I have never eaten Saurkraut, I am English. I made this for German friends I loved it they raved about it. I did strain the sauerkraut I had purchased in a glass jar. That was the only change I made. Thanks Wunnie, we had a great German meal.

I followed the recipe as written. It was very good but because of all the brown sugar, it tasted quite a bit different than traditional sauerkraut.  There is almost none of the kraut "bite". As long as you know that going in you won't be surprised or disappointed.  I will keep looking for more traditional recipes with sauerkraut.

This was pretty good but the pork didn't "melt in your mouth" as advertised. It was tender but not as moist as it should have been. I cooked at the recommended temperature for the recommended time and followed the recipe exactly except for using a lot more sage and garlic salt; the recommended amount wouldn't have been nearly enough.  I will make it again but next time I'll try it in my crock pot.

Thjis was great. I added 4 potatoes that I cut in 4. I put them on the bottom of my crock and then added 1/2 kraut then the roast and then followed the recipe form there. The only difference I will make in the futere is to add 1/2 cup of liquid-maybe apple juice so there is more to laddel over the dinner. It was great. Just like what my hubby ate in Germany. Nicely sweet-yet tangy. Thanks for sharing.

This is one of my favorite fall recipes. The only modification I make is to add a bag of baby carrots.  I just dump everything in the crockpot and cook on low for 8+ hours while at work.  It couldn't be simpler or tastier!

I think this is a great recipe, and so easy to prepare on a weeknight.  My fiance didn't care for it, but that's probably because he's not a big fan of sauerkraut.  The meat comes out extremely moist and tender.  The only drawback is that it makes the house smell kind of like cabbage...

This was a surprisingly good meal and so simple. I had the heat set a bit higher (10 degrees) due to time constraints, and I saved about 20 minutes It was very moist and flavorful.

I hate to contradict so many good reveiws, but I really didn't like this recipe.  As I ate it I started off thinking it was nothing special and finished with a dislike for it.  One thing to note - I couldn't find a 2-lb tenderloin, so I used two 1-lb tenderloins.  I checked on them after an hour and they were already way past 145 degrees.  I think this recipe would be much better with Kielbasa instead of pork tenderloins.

Yummy!!  SO tender and moist!  This wasn't the recipe I had planned to use when I bought a tenderloin roast so didn't follow exactly- I had no apples or brown sugar and only about half a jar of sauerkraut.  I sauteed a large yellow onion and combined that with the kraut.  Also, to save on time I browned the pork with the spices, a 2 lb roast took just over an hour in the oven and was delicious!  Will make this again for sure!

I tried this recipe on a whim and my family loved it.  I did leave out the brown sugar because I was worried it would be too sweet and for my family it was perfect.  It took the edge off the sauerkraut in an awesome way.   I only ended up cooking my loin roast 1 hr and 45 min as it was actually over 160 degrees at that time.  Thanks!

I made this exactly as stated except added some seasoned salt and cracked pepper.  I put it in my cast iron skillet and baked for 2 hours.  It was so juicy and the flavor was amazing.  I don't cook pork often but I would make this again.

This was wonderful even though we don't eat sauerkraut very often due to the salt content. I sprinkled some caraway seed and rosemary on it before cooking, however, I forgot the brown sugar.  It was still very good.  I will make it again using less sauerkraut.  Thank you for submitting. this recipe.

Very easy but the sauerkraut that fell off the sides of the tenderloin burnt to the pan and made it difficult to clean. I'll definitely make this again but will line the pan with foil first.

The tenderloin indeed came out tender and moist; however, the sauercraut left me cold! I think that if I try this one again, I'll make some changes in the ingredient list!

I made this recipe on New Years Eve and I have to say it was the best Pork/Sauerkraut dish I've had. Clearly, it's not radically different - but just different enough! The apples (I diced mine) cut the tartness of the kraut perfectly without leaving it bland. The pork itself was "falling apart" tender after about 3 hours (I turned it down to about 200F for an additional hour or so until I was ready for it). Thanks so much for posting this recipe, I've passed it along to several people already.  HAPPY NEW YEAR!

Not bad.  I used tenderloin chops and cookde for less time.  I should've used a tart apple but I had a fuji in the fridge.  That tasted odd.  I didn't care for it as a whole, but my husband liked it.

Quite tasty and very easy to put together. Went very nicely with mashed potatoes. The juice over the potatoes was heavenly. Will add carrots as the other reader suggested. Nice meal on a cold winter evening.

I chopped the apple and sliced the onion, and layered in the middle of the sauerkraut.  Poked slivers of garlic into the pork.  Added a sprinkling of caraway seeds on top.  Very good, but it still needs something more...I'm thinking maybe drain & dry the sauerkraut VERY well, and then mix in a little beer.  Will try that next time...

I make it with more apple and no sauerkraut, substituting other vegetables such as celery or carrots, which I place to the sides of the meat, with the apple slices on top of the meat. Instead of garlic powder, I stick finely minced fresh garlic into the meat. Sage, cayenne, fresh cilantro, and a couple teaspoons of olive oil and honey (instead of the brown sugar) also go on top of the pork before the apple slices are applied to cover it, with aluminum foil loosely covering the whole baking dish. Two hours of cooking time is usually plenty.

I opted not to make this as the cooking time was vague: 2 to 3 hours. I really need a more definitive time so that I have other dishes finishing at the same time. I don’t think I ever ate or served just a pork roast. I gave it 3 stars because it does sound yummy.

forgot to start it in slow cooker in the morning, but wouldn't be home in time to start it in the oven at 325, so I put it in the oven at 1pm at 275 degrees, by 5 pm it was perfect.

This was amazing, very tender and juicy everyone loved it, my grandsons have never eaten sauerkraut before, needless to say they love sauerkraut this way and told me to fix this one again and often, so it's definitely a keeper and we will have this wonderful recipe again.

Have to watch the temp. Pork cooks quickly . I used a 6-6.5 lb roast . It was done in about 2.2 hours . Also browned meat in broiler before cooking . Used minced garlic instead of garlic salt . Awesome taste .

I'm getting ready to make this recipe and I already know it will be wonderful.  One thing . . . the picture above looks like a "Pork loin", not a "pork tenderloin".  There is a difference.  A pork tenderloin is a very thin cylinder (kind of eel shaped) and a pork loin is much thicker.  A pork tenderloin is usually around 1 lb. of meat.  I'll be using two.  A pork loin can be 4 lbs. (maybe more) and some people buy them whole and section them into the sizes they want.  Just a little FYI.

2 hours is too long.  It came out a bit dry. I pulled it out at 1 hour & 10 minutes and the internal temp was 160. Also, might taste better marinading first with these ingredients before cooking. My husband liked it.

This came out perfect!!  My husband loves pork with sauerkraut, so I thought this would be a nice addition, ie. the apple and onion. It definetly was!!! I follows the recipe almost exactly, just didn't have amy sage...no problem!!! And I loved how easy it was to prepare! Thanks for a great recipe I will use again and again!

I didn't have 3 hrs, so I modified this somewhat.  After rubbing the tenderloin with sage & garlic, I seared all sides of the pork in the roasting pan with a tiny bit of oil.   I poured off the oil and deglazed the pan with about 1/3 of cranberry juice as that was the only juice I had on hand.  Any wine, juice, or vermouth would have worked find.   I added the sauerkraut along with 1 granny smith green apple and half an onion that had been shredded, covered it up and cooked it at 400 for 45 minutes.  The whole thing was done in an hour and DELICIOUS.  I didn't add any sugar at all other than what was in the juice.   I'm picky about my sauerkraut, as is my German husband, and we both loved this.   Served it with spaetzle on the side.   Even the kids gobbled it up.

Absolutely delicious!  I used Boars Head bagged sauerkraut,and drained minimally.  And I did follow the tip about keeping it under foil - I took the foil off after 2 hours and turned the oven off but left it in, just to get a bit of temp on it.  Rave, rave reviews all around.  Even my non-sauerkraut eater ate the pork!  Served with mashed potatoes (a must with sauerkraut in my house) and the baby carrots & diced apples another reviewer mentioned, tho with those I used a lite margarine and splenda.  They were awesome with it as well.... Def going in the recipe box for repeats :)

This was an awesome recipe.  I kept all of the ingredients the same but added a couple of things.  First, I had two tenderloins approximately 1.25 pounds each.  I rubbed with sage, garlic, salt and pepper and browned them in an oven safe deep skillet.  I added some beef broth to the bottom of the pan and topped them with the sauerkraut, apple, onion, and brown sugar (I sliced the apple and onion and spread the pieces over the first layer). I covered and cooked for 30 minutes at 350. Then I added halved small potatoes and mini carrots.  I basted them with the broth, covered and cooked at 325 for another hour.  It turned out great and it was a one pot meal.  Thanks very much for the recipe.  It was actually my first time cooking pork tenderloin and I am so glad I did.

This was a hit with my family.  Cooked it in the crockpot & it came out fall apart tender.  I used two 14 oz cans sauerkraut  w/ liquid and added an additional 1/2 cup water. A  quartered  green apple and quartered onion.  Threw it all in the pot and let it go on low for 6 hours.   Even my picky 12 yr old enjoyed it. Will definitely make again.

This was delicious!!! So yummy... I did make a few small changes though. I cut the apple and onion in 4 pieces instead of 2 and switched the for sure/3 cup of brown sugar to 1/4 cup of maple syrup instead!!!  Fabulous!!!  Will for sure make this one again!!

Easy and yummy too! I only had a pork roast, so I used this instead of a tenderloin. But I would like to try this recipe with the tenderloin.

Easy to prepare, throw in the oven and forget... until the smell fills the kitchen.  Amazing how many people are willing to "help" you remove it from the oven.  >;-) Absolutely wonderful!
