Delicious light and yummy lemon pie with a shell that melts in your mouth. The directions do not tell you to put the beaten egg whites into the pie plate and to "mold" the eggwhite edges upwards to hold in the filling after the shell is baked.  I have made a similar pie before so I knew to do this.  I did not use a bouble bolier as the instructions said, but just cooked the egg yolk mixture over medium low heat until it was thick and began to boil.  Be sure to cool both the shell and the lemon mixture completely as the instructions tell you.  I used two cups of whipped cream and added a little vanilla and powdered sugar to the whipped cream for a hint of sweetening.  I garnished the top with a few fresh red raspberries on each piece.  I will definately make this recipe again as it is a real winner. I served this for company and everyone loved it!

This is a trustworthy recipe--no "surprises." Just remember that you're not making a pudding type of filling, you're making a curd, which behaves much differently on the stove. I also whip 2 cups of cream and add about a quarter cup of sugar and 1/2 tsp. vanilla to it. I lighten the curd by folding in a little of the whipped cream. Not only does this lighten it up, it also gives the base a velvety feel to the tongue. Garnish with lemon rind curls & you've got a winner.

This is similar to my recipe, but I am all about easy. No need to use a double boiler--just cook the lemon juice, sugar (reduced to 1/3 cup) and egg yolk over medium low heat, whisking constantly until thick. When the lemon curd has completely cooled, fold in 2 stiffly beaten egg whites and 1 (8 oz) container Cool Whip. Pour into meringue shell and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Then top it with real whipped cream and garnish with lemon peel. This is a great Spring/Summer pie!  P.S. Always use a glass pie plate and spray it well with cooking spray before putting in the meringue. This will make serving the pie much easier.

This is a wonderfully light and refreshing dessert.  I made a mess of it trying to serve it and I'm glad it wasn't for company.  Baked meringue is very fragile and I had a heck of a time getting a slice out in one piece.  So for presentation, unless you're a whiz at cutting meringe, I'd only give it a 3, but the taste is definitely 5-star.  The lemon is delightfully tart and is balanced by the sweetness of the meringue crust.  I see no need to sweeten the whipped cream as it seems the dessert is sweet enough without it.  I was concerned about the relatively small amount of lemon curd compared to the other ingredients, but the intense flavor carries through even though the amount is small.  This is a wonderful alternative to lemon meringue pie. 4/12/09--I shaped individual crusts on parchment on a cookie sheet.  This worked well and I didn't have the mess trying to cut it that I had when it was a whole pie.

I am on a low carb diet.  I substituted "Splenda" sweetener for the sugar and this pie was excellent!

This pie induced much selfishness and ill will. Arguements abounded as family members denied sneaking pieces.  This lasted less than a full day as this heavenly dessert vanished that fast.  At first bite silence fell over the table as our tastebuds sang with pleasure.  I did try to mold the pre-cooked meringue into a shape that would contain the filling. No changes were necessary. When I make this again (probably today) I will try piping the whipped cream topping to make it prettier. This deserves a place of honour in your recipe box. UPDATE: To prevent major war I have resorted to cutting the finished pie in half. His and Mine!

This has been my favorite pie for over 50 years.  It is light and refreshing  ... not at all filling after a dinner. It is a perfect combination of sweet and sour/tangy.  It is important to mold the egg whites so that the sides are thick and high.  If you leave the bottom thick it will stay more on the foamy side and not crisp/harden up like the sides do.  I do not like to layer the whipped cream and the lemon curd, rather I fold the lemon curd into the whipped cream.  I keep some of the whipped cream on the side because that way I can control the tanginess of the filling  better.  I prefer the filling to be more tangy than perhaps the recipe may portions show, so I fold half the whipped cream into the lemon curd and add the more whipping cream to my taste. It is beautiful garnished with thin lemon slices coated with sugar crystals.  I give this recipe a 5++++

This pie has been a thanksgiving favorite in my family for almost 50 years - the recipe used to be printed on Crystal Sugar sacks. Make sure that you use either the cream of tartar or a 1/2 tsp vinegar, otherwise the shell will not crack and firm up like it should.

This is the most delicious dessert I have ever made-light, refreshing, and tangy.  If you like lemon desserts, you must try this one!  I do add about 1/8 cup of the whippied cream to the curd to make it easier to spread.  It doesn't change the flavor or intensity of the filling.  I don't think the whipped cream needs any sweetening at all, but DON'T forget to well grease the pan!!!  So tasty and wonderful!

Though there are greater tragedies but right up there would be never having experienced this pie.  I have fond memories of my grandma's angel pie and this recipe allows me to recreate memories for those I love.  This is fool-proof and divine.  The only change that I make is to double up on the lemon curd because we love the tang.  It's wonderful right after it's assembled, but if you can wait 'til the following day it is even more amazing then!

So good!! I made mine in a 9x13. I didn't go up the sides of the pan, just made a flat bottom. It made it easier to serve. I love this pie.

I made this pie for my brothers birthday. The meringue pie shell turned out great but the lemon filling I felt was a little runny. I tried folding in a little whipping cream and still seemed thin to me. If I decide to try again I will add a tablespoon or or two of cornstarch to thicken things up a little.

After reading the comments about the meringue sticking to the pan, I decided to make mine like a Pavlova, piping then spreading the meringue onto a sheet of parchment on a baking sheet.  I did add extra eggwhites for volume.  It was beautiful - freeform and perfect. Try it!

Decided to try making a light pie and chose this recipe.  Had unexpected company and everyone rated this a "5"  Will definitely make this many times again.  Used 2 cups of cream instead of  1 1/8 to completely cover the top.

Excellent! Followed suggestion of 2 cups Whipping Cream with a little powdered sugar and vanilla. Everyone loved it. It really does melt in your mouth. Light and refreshing. We will enjoy this during the warmer months and maybe change it up with orange or lime next time.

I served this last night for a family gathering and we all wished I had made a second one!  It was amazing.  I doubled the lemon part because it didn't look like enough, and then added some of the whipped cream as another reviewer suggested.  Everyone agreed that doubling it was a good idea.  I will be making this again! and again and again. . .

Not sure why this was rated so highly by most folks, but we found it to be odd. Not great flavor, a strange consistency, just ODD, lol. I would MUCH MUCH prefer a lemon meringue pie over this concoction.

I have made this pie at least 25 times now. Very easy to make although a bit of a time consuming recipe (leting it cool in the oven) I dont mind because the reward is well worth it! I will be using this recipe all sumer long. Thank you for sharing!

This was very good!  I sweetened the whipped cream a little with sugar and added some vanilla and it was a perfect balance with the tartness of the lemon.  I did make a mistake, and didn't grease the pie plate enough, so the meringue crust stuck horribly!  The taste did, however, make up for that little mishap.   I will definitely make this again.

I followed this recipe to a tee, but found it way too soupy for my liking, I made it again with a standard crust and mixing the lemon with whip cream to make a lemon cream pie and covered it with whip cream and served it at a dinner party and it was a huge hit.  I preferred my remake way better than the original recipe.

ok I was worried because the crust wouldn't stay up on the sides.  It just kept slipping down, and  I was also worried because there was not a lot of the lemon filling after heating it.  I followed recipe to the T, and it turned out fine.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  On day 3 it was very good.  The lemon was much stronger.  Don't be afraid of making it in advance.  The crust was not soggy.  Will make again!

I grew up having this pie once a year. Every New Years Day it is tradition to have a good Steak Dinner and follow it up with thus light creamy airy pie. Having this pie once a year makes you crazy in anticipation waiting for this your mouth waters all year round!

This is really good, a little challenging trying to get it out of the pie plate even after using Pam, but no one seemed to mind

REally easy and delicious!  I didn't need all the calories and cholesterol, so I used a small container of LITE Cool Whip in place of the whipped cream.  It was perfect!  In addition, I used two whole eggs and one extra egg white and 3/4 sugar and 1/4 Splenda to make the lemon filling. I probably added a little more lemon because we have an over productive lemon tree and we love anything lemon. I then put the other half of the cool whip on the top decoratively with a spatula, and Voila!  A genuine winner!  I ended up having to print 2 more recipes to give to our guests!

This would have gained 5 stars had the meringue not been so "gaggy" sweet.  I will cut the sugar amount to 1/2 to 3/4 cup the next time I make it. I followed another reviewer and used 2 cups of heavy cream, 1/4 c. sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla as I wanted more cream for the topping. I also did add a heaping tablespoon of the cream to the lemon curd to help spread it.  A very delicious dessert and one I will definitely make again.

Absolutely amazing pie. My mother used to make this every 4th of July...and this one turned out even better than her's. I will totally be making this again soon. It's one of the few pies I've ever made that was eaten within hours of being served.

Yes it takes a while to make, but it is so light, fluffy and flavorful that I know I'll crave it again someday.

Would omit cream of tartar, my mother  recipe does not call for it and seemed to make my meringue expand/raise too much.  This is a really good dessert

This recipe has been in our family for 2 plus generations with two differences. We do not grease the pie dish & we make it twenty four hours ahead so the the crust just melts into the pie, so to speak. It is delicious & easy to remove.

This is amazing. My mother-in-law makes it by folding the lemon curd into the whipping cream, which is really good but I prefer it this way, where the lemon curd is left thick, and rich. 
You get a more lemony bite. Have made it many times and it always turns out wonderful.

If you like anything lemon flavored, you will absolutely LOVE this pie.  My mother made this at least twenty five years ago and the pie would be gone in the blink of an eye.  Because we all love lemon anything,  I make extra lemon filling for more of a richer tart lemon flavor.  I can guarantee you of one thing, this is a different and unique dessert.

Delicious pie! Everyone raved about the crust! Will make it again only use a different fruit just to see how it comes out.
