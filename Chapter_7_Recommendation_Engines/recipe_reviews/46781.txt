These muffins are moist and delicious! I didn't put any nuts but added extra wheat germ to give it a crunchy texture!

These were not awful...but they really just had NO flavor besides that of the chocolate chips.  The hazelnut flavor did not come out at all.  I won't make these again.  My sister said she would just prefer plain chocolate chip muffins, she didn't even realize they were supposed to be something more.
