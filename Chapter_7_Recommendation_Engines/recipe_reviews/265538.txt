Don't have the attachment to put it in casings, so I just made bulk sausage. Whole family loved it!

My husband is a hunter so I used this recipe to make venison sausage. I used half pork and half venison.   We usually get our sausage made at a local butcher shop and it is expensive. I adjusted the quantity so that I could make a large batch.. These sausages are delicious , we will be making our own from now on.  They are great done on the barbeque.

Awesome mix! This version did it skinless for breakfast tacos and later with diced potatoes onions and bell peppers for a nice dinner burrito! Next version will use hog liner for an actual sausage!

This is by far the best Italian sausage I have ever made.  Another hit from Chef John.  This is my fifth batch of Italian sausage glad to find this one.

The spices are on point for sure. I used half pork and half goose. Left out marjoram but everything else was delicious!
