We loved this!  It was very simple to put together and so flavorful!  It really did have the same flavors as bruschetta.  The balsamic vinegar really took this dish over the top.   Definitely keep an eye on your chicken though.   The tomatoes were perfect at 30 minutes, but, if you use chicken tenders or cut into 1" pieces - you probably won't need 30 minutes on the chicken.  I left mine in the same amount of time and the chicken was dry.  Next time I will cook the tomatoes 10 minutes and then put the chicken in for the remaining 20 minutes.  Great flavors!

We love, love, love this recipe.  The first time I made it, I used fresh tomatoes.  The second time, I used canned tomatoes, green olives, black olives, and some artichoke hearts.  Wow!  I'm not sure which tomato I liked better but the canned was easier because I didn't have to plan ahead.  I always have canned tomatoes on hand.  It's fantastic both ways.

This was the first McCormick Gourmet spice mix I tried...and it was love a first bite! After trying this delicious dish, I couldn't wait to try the others! The spices are blended perfectly! Not too over powering! And my house smelled sooo good while this was cooking! I always double these McCormick recipes whenever I make them because I always cook a full pound of pasta for my family.

I found this to be quite tasty, especially after following another reviewer's advice to bake the tomatoes for 10 minutes first, then add the chicken so the meat wouldn't overcook. I couldn't find the suggested McCormick's spice packet anywhere in the store, is it new? Anyway, I used a different McCormick's packet that was intended for marinating meat prior to grilling. It had many of the same ingredients, so I just added oregano and went with that (doubling the sauce). It turned out very good. I think that if I used sweet Italian sausage next time, my husband would enjoy it even more.

This recipe has potential and I will say I think McCormick’s seasoning blend is very good.  But…this recipe has some real problems as far as I’m concerned.  First, since when did one pound of chicken serve 8 people?  Same with the pasta – a serving size is 2 ounces per person, not one ounce.  Beyond that, the oven temperature and cooking time are excessive.  Knowing that a 425 degree oven wasn’t necessary, I lowered my oven temperature to 400, and then against my better judgment, I baked it for the full 30 minutes.  Well, I know better than that and sure enough, the chicken was dry as can be.  Had I baked it at 425, I’m sure I would have ended up with shoe leather.  I chopped my tomatoes to begin with and skipped chopping them as indicated in Step 3.  After baking for 30 minutes, the tomatoes were very mushy, which I didn’t actually object to, but I would have liked them a bit more firm as well.  So, if you’re going to make this, lower the oven temperature to 400 and check the chicken in about 15 minutes.  If you want mushy tomatoes, you may want to start them first and then add the chicken.  I’m definitely going to make this again because it has very good flavor, but I expected more from a recipe by McCormick.  I think I'm being generous giving this recipe 3 stars.

Best idea to make for the party. 2 nights ago, I was in a rush to find the perfect dish to bring to the party. When I came across this website and this recipe, I fell in love. So I made it enough for 20 people, by the time I got to the party and set it down and walked away for a few minutes before coming back. My bowl was already empty. Thankfully I got a plate in before going in. If your looking for that perfect main course, this is it!

Incredibly easy, and I used halved grape tomatoes since that's what I had on hand.  This was my family's favorite of the McCormick Gourmet Seasoning meals.  Sprinkle with parmesan at the end, it's delicious!

I prepared this recipe exactly as stated, perhaps using a little more pasta than 8 oz. but my package was already opened and I wasn't sure how much was left - probably more like 10 oz.  The dish is very good, but HOLY SODIUM!  I usually salt the water I cook pasta in, if you do as well you may want to omit salt.  This states 8 servings - I don't know how many people are satisfied with 2 oz. of chicken and 1 oz. of pasta, but it isn't my family!  There were three of us and we just had a little left over for the next day.  I'll probably fix this again, but I may use only 3/4 of the spice packet, and add more chicken to make it more filling.

My family thought that this was another winner from McCormick. I will keep these mixes on hand to throw in on busy days cause they are incredibly easy and my boys are always very happy with the result. You could really make it your own by adding additional veggies but it is delicious as is!

This is my first review that I have ever left on this site and it is well deserved. I made this last night for my family of six. I had no complaints (which is a feat in itself). I made it exactly as written - the only change I made was that I cut up the chicken and threw it into the pasta because it was easier for my kids to eat that way. Everyone loved it, it was super simple and definitely something I will be making more often! In a busy household, recipes like these are golden!

I couldn't find the McCormicks spice for this so I made my own mix with basil, oregano, sea salt, and garlic.  Very tasty!

This dish was SO easy to make. It actually took less than 30 minutes to cook the chicken, I recommend you check on it to avoid it being overcooked and dry. The seasoning is great and this is a great item to have available in your pantry for a quick, delicious meal in a pinch!

I really really love this recipe but the folks are correct, the chicken comes out dry if you follow the directions.  I took the tomatoes and 1" chicken strips out of the (425 degree) oven  at 20 minutes, and the chicken was already dry.  30 minutes would have been really bad.  My suggestion is to go 15 minutes and take it all out of the oven.  In any case the recipe is simple and the flavors are great.

This was absolutely delicious! It's a nice change from spaghetti and meatballs. I used Cento brand peeled plum tomatoes because I had no fresh tomatoes on hand. After I laid out the cut tomatoes I poured the rest of the sauce from the can around the edges because I was making a 12oz box of whole wheat spaghetti and figured I'd need the extra juices. It's SO easy. I'll be making this one again.

Delicious! I followed the advice of a previous review and added the chicken to the tomatoes after 10 minutes. I also cut the chicken tenders in 3rds for bite sized pieces.

I've made this dish twice now and we have loved it both times!  I will continue to buy this spice mix and keep it on hand...very easy to put together which makes it a great meal to have on a weeknight when time is limited.

Made this exactly as indicated, except  rather than brushing the mixture onto the chicken I combined the chicken and seasoned oil mixture in a bowl before adding to the pan which I believe help them stay very juice and tender. Tossed everything together in a large pot and served with the cheese and the whole family loved it.

First, I will say this IS very tasty and got a rare thumbs-up from my husband...however I rarely use pre-packaged spice packets; I'd rather have control over the amounts of spice and for me this just had way too much garlic.  We didn't finish it and after sitting in the frig, the whole frig stank of garlic! ;)
I know I'm in the minority when it comes to garlic, but I'll probably not buy the packet again.

This dish was absoutely delicious. My husband was very skeptical when I told him what we were having for dinner. When he took the first bite  he said we should have this once a week. Thank you McCormicks.

Since we didn't have the store-bought mix on hand, I concocted my own blend of oregano, fresh basil, garlic powder and olive oil.  It worked pretty well. Even though it was a quick meal my cutting the chicken breast into smaller pieces, the chicken dried out in the oven.  Will make this again, though, with a little tweaking.

This is amazing! If I was on death row, this honestly might be part of my last supper.
Update: Just made this and could easily eat three more bowls. Still good 2 years later!

I loved this recipe!  It was so easy and so good!  I didn't read the reviews about the chicken until after I finished cooking it.  Next time, I will cook the tomatoes for 10 minutes before adding the chicken.  I didn't add the reserved oil to my pasta.  It wasn't necessary, there was plenty of flavor with the chicken and tomatoes.  I will use the leftover oil to make more tomatoes tomorrow.  Excellent recipe.  I highly recommend.

I chopped the tomatoes and chicken (1.5 lbs) and put in a big 13x9 dish and cooked for 30 minutes then I mixed with the pasta as instructed. Lots of liquid, very yummy and super easy.

I made it tonight and used 5 boneless , skinless chicken breasts. I put them in whole, lowered the temp to 400 degrees and cooked for 30 minutes. They were tender and perfect! Highly recommend this recipe!

It has potential, but it did not convinced me completely.

This is delicious and so simple to make, definitely a quick, staple meal.  I cooked the chicken and tomatoes in a covered roasting pan and then tossed the pasta and remaining seasoning mixture right in the pan. Next time I'll add other fresh vegetables like zucchini and/or asparagus. Yummy!

We absolutely love this recipe mix. My very picky husband could not get enough, he thinks I'm the best cook ever, and rated it better then his favorite restaurant chicken dish. I didn't make any changes to the original package directions and actually doubled it for left-overs which when warmed up and excellent as well.

I thought this was okay.  Flavor was good.  Just thought the chicken was not very tender.  And it tasted a bit oily.

Made this recipe exactly as it was written.  Although it was very easy and I really wanted it to be a winner, I found it to be very blah.

Deeelicious! We had this for dinner tonight. I changed the servings to 2 and used the calculator which really helped.I did use 2 oz of pasta for each of us though. I'll be making this again soon. Hubby loved it.
