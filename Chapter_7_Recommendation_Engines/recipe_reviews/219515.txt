I use equal part of Pace Picante sauce, medium heat and grape jelly for this.  Very good and easy.

These were just ok. The combination of the salsa and marmalade took a while to get used to.

We loved this.  I think maybe next time I might try cooking them on a rack (like a cooling rack sprayed with cooking spray first) because the juices from the chicken washed off some of the salsa. The chicken was so tender and moist.

Really tasty and not hard to make but my glaze was more of a sauce. Maybe i'll cook it longer or add more marmalade to thicken it up. They were a huge hit taste wise though!

This was pretty good! Next time I make it I'm going to get a super hot picante sauce, but that's how I like my food, super spicey. My dad and brother felt the same but my mom loved it as is. Easy and Good

I can't buy Pace Picante Sauce, so had to find a recipe to make myself.  Very good put into ice cube trays to use as wanted.  My sauce was quite hot and the whole mix went well together.  I don't have town gas, so try to avoid using oven. Finding someone who is willing to lug a 25kg bottle up two flights is not so easy. I fried the wings first and then finished them off in the sauce.  I had some of the sauce left over and used it the next day as a base for a lamb stew.
