Quick, easy and flavorful with only four ingredient. This should be refrigerated an hour or two so the flavors can blend.

The hubby has always loved clam dip, but they don't seem to make it anymore, I haven't seen it in the grocery stores in years now. So when I saw this recipe, I thought I'd give it a try. He LOVED it, says it was the best clam dip he's ever had. To my surprise, I never liked clam dip, yet I love this as well! A really good, REALLY fast recipe, thanks so much for sharing! :-D

Lost my go to recipe when our home burned down so I decided to try this recipe since it had a high rating. Made it exactly as recipe stated. Nobody liked it. Tasted like pure cream cheese with celery salt and not in a good way.

So I got home and saw a can of clams open in the fridge and knew right away what had happened.  My daughter had thought  it was tuna and opened it.  So I had to find something to use it in.  Found this quick and easy one and tried it.  Kept to the recipe, except I only used half the cream cheese.
