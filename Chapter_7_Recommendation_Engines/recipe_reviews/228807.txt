I chose to use the low-sugar pectin in this recipe which reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup. Other than that, I kept to the recipe exact. Very nice blueberry freezer jam--I'm glad I cut the sugar back, 1/3 cup was just right for us. Next time I will double the recipe as this barely filled two half pint jars.

Tastes just like blueberries, as freezer jam should.  But moistening the pectin with lemon juice and then stirring it in is ludicrous - it will form lumps and you'll still be stirring when next season's blueberries arrive.  Add the lemon juice to the crushed berries, stir in the sugar, then add the dry pectin a little at a time, stirring after each addition until it disappears.

Way too much sugar! I was planning on making a low sugar jam so when I doubled the recipe I only used 6 cups of sugar, 4 cups blueberries. I'm so glad I did because the sugar never dissolved. I had to add more blueberries, pectin, and lemon juice to make it not taste like gritty sugar mixture. I ended up essentially quadrupling the recipe in all senses except the sugar. Then the instructions say to set it at room temp for 24 hours. I've never heard of this, most instructions say 30 minutes, then freeze for 24 hours. 

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOLLOWING THIS RECIPE!

The recipe says to mix 2 T lemon juice with 1 pkg of pectin in a separate bowl...DO NOT DO THIS!!!!!!  The lemon and pectin together created a ball of blob that congealed and could not be mixed with crushed berries, or ANYTHING for that matter.  Completely ruined effort to make jam...

It never did set up for me. The sugar seemed to settle at the bottom of the jar. My sugar never did dissolve all the way. Stirring the lemon juice and pectin together was pretty much impossible. I will say that the flavor was wonderful but really sweet.
