I made the following substitutions: blackberry honey for syrup, fat-free sour cream for half-and-half, whole wheat flour for all-purpose, light brown sugar for dark. I cut the salt to about 1/8 tsp and  mixed the oats into the liquid ingredients to soak before combining the dry components. Because my oven runs hot, I baked slightly below 375. I used  Wilton silicone muffin pans (pre-greased) and baked for about 16 minutes. The resulting muffins were delicious: moist and sweet. The tops were a bit flat, so I'll try more baking powder next time. Once properly cooled, my batch was not unusually crumbly--in fact, they hold together quite well. Soaking the oats must be the secret. I'll bet they'd be great with shredded carrot added.

Very good!  First thing I did was get my liquid ingredients together, to soak my oats.  I added only 1/2 tsp of salt.  The only problem was I didn't hear my timer go off at 15 minutes so they cooked a little longer, but not much, because the didn't burn.  They did sink in on the tops, but were still tasty!

Great flavour and texture!  This is one recipe using maple syrup where you can actually taste the maple.  I substituted 1/2 cup plain lowfat yogurt for the cream as another reviewer did, with great success.  I also added about 1/2 cup frozen blueberries and raspberries.

I love the flavor of maple and I love baking with it.  This recipe appealed to me but I immediately noticed it had salt overload, so I reduced it by half.  Also, tho’ I always bake with boldly flavored Grade B maple syrup, I wanted to ensure bold maple flavor, so I omitted the cinnamon and added 1 tsp. of maple extract.  As I mixed up the batter, I was concerned – it was curdly, although it did correct once I added the dry ingredients.   I was again concerned as they were baking - flat, spreading into “muffin tops” rather than rising into a rounded dome, and caving in the center.  I often notice this feature in coffee houses and bakeries, so maybe that’s considered okay, but it doesn’t appeal to me.  I prettied them up with an additional layer of maple flavor by brushing on more maple syrup I had reduced to a thick consistency onto the baked muffins.  So now I’m ready for the taste test.  First of all, my caved in muffin (which I cleverly tried to disguise with a sugar acorn decoration) fell apart into a plate full of cakey crumbs!  Moist crumbs tho,’ so I’ll give it that anyway.  And for all the maple in these muffins – the Grade B syrup, the maple extract and the glaze of concentrated maple syrup, they weren’t very maple-y at all.  The taste was ok, oat muffin-like and not too sweet, but I have a rule for myself and my baking.  If I don’t feel confident giving something away (mostly for pride reasons), the recipe is a failure for me.  I will not give these away.

These muffins are sooooo good and incredibly easy to make! I didn't have half and half so I used vanilla soy milk and they turned out really well. Using real maple syrup makes a huge difference. Thanks for this recipe! I'll be making it a lot.

My children absoluty love these muffins. They eat them for breakfast every morning. I used regular maple syrup and not real maple. I also used 2% milk, and so far I have not had a problem with them falling apart. Also, if you haven't already, add walnuts.

Because I have one child with a lactose allergy, I substituted vegetable oil for the butter and lactose-free milk in place of the half-n-half. I also cut back the salt to a healthy pinch. I've cooked with oatmeal before so I knew to mix all the wet ingredients together, then add the oatmeal and let it sit for 15 minutes to soak up some of the liquid. After that, I folded in the sugar and the remaining dry ingredients. I was able to get 11 smallish muffins from this recipe--I baked them at 350* for twenty minutes. VERY dark looking muffin but they smell incredible. My issue with this recipe was that the muffins were quite sweet, for us adding the additional brown sugar was overkill. I'd like to make this again but omit the brown sugar completely. As is, a solid muffin recipe.

These were SO YUMMY! My son wouldnt leave me alone, he just wanted more! I had to make some changes due to a medical diet, I put in apple sauce to replace the butter, and instead of half and half I put 1/4cup fat free yogurt, and 1/4 cup skim milk. I also added in some raisins! They are so good! Thanks a bunch! Mine never caved in nor fell apart! they were perfect!

First let me say that this recipe is an inflated cookie.  It is sweet and has a crunchy top.  It does fall completely apart.  The flavor is nice.  It's just not what I'm looking for.

Terrific!  I made these healthier by substituting wholewheat flour for all-purpose, and using skim milk instead of half and half.  The walnuts are a must!

Take the advice about soaking the oats in the liquid.  Didn't have half-and-half on hand, so I substituted with 1/4 c. of skim milk and 1/4 c. of sour cream. Added 3-4 dried cranberries on top. Didn't have dark so I used light brown sugar.  These came together very quickly and made 12 perfect muffins.  Really good with a cup of tea!  This is a keeper.  UPDATE: I've been making different versions of these for a few weeks and now they're even better and HEALTHIER!  Replace half the butter with plain applesauce.  Use 2 eggs.  Use low-fat half-and-half.  Add 2 T. of toasted wheat germ.  Reduce the salt to 3/4 teaspoon. Replace half the flour with whole wheat flour. Stir the oats into the liquid/egg/sugar mixture and let it sit while you sift together the dry ingredients.  Don't over-mix the batter. Bake 6 GIANT mufffins!!

This turned out really good for me.  They were a little flat but tasted good.  I used low fat yogurt instead of cream b/c that's what I had.  I also added some grated carrots.  These did not crumble on me like some of the other reviewers.  thanks

These muffins just didn't turn out.  It was the first time my muffin pan over-flowed, causing a big mess on the bottom of my oven.  The flavour however was very good.

After my dad was told to get off white sugar/flour from his doctor, I made these up as a healthy alternative... and then made another batch two days later! They turned out moist, filling and sweet-- great for a quick snack.   I didn't have any dark brown sugar on hand, so I substituted 1/2 c of light brown sugar & 1 tbsp of dark corn syrup. I also used whole-wheat flour instead of all purpose, and 2% milk instead of half-and-half. Next time I might also make a brown sugar/cinnamon topping to put on before baking for an extra touch.  Anyway great recipe! I've already made a few times AND shared the recipe with a friend, would make 'em again in a heartbeat. :)

I also substituted wheat flour and they turned out great! But one thing I would change is the salt, I would cut that in half, they tasted a little salty. Also, try putting plain cream cheese spread on top, it is amazing!

The muffins had a great flavor, but did cook with a sunken whole in the middle... did also overflow a bit from muffin pans. I am going to "play" with it a bit , because the flavor is WELL worth it ;]

These tasted great.  But it was more like 18 servings instead of 12 because mine overflowed!  And some of the ones that over flowed did fall apart.  I used 1/2 c. vanilla yogurt and it tasted great!

These were fabulous!  Used margarine instead of butter (and minus about 2 tablespoons), and didn't have any half/half so I substituted 1/2 cup of fat-free plain yogurt.  Very delicioius, kept together great, and very moist!  A+++

I made these hoping to take them to church.  They ended up looking like hollowed-out muffin cups that could hold about 2Tbs of filling (I'm not sure what).  The best I could do with them is scoop and scrape them off of the overflowing but hollow muffin cups and serve them in bowls as baked oatmeal to my family.

These are really good. I was trying to use up all the stuff at home, so I substituted powdered sugar for brown sugar (not supposed to XD), coffee creamer for half and half, and margarine for butter 0.0 Nevertheless, if was still AWESOME. I'm just a little confused about the tops....they're all flat. That's a little strange for muffins, but it's okay. Definitely going to make this again! Thanks for sharing!

The flavor was great, but very sweet and cakelike for a muffin, which is not what I look for in a breakfast treat.  Also, the muffins crumbled terribly when I took them out of the tins, even with greasing.  So I ended up using the crumbs as a cake topping for an apple crisp, and it was good (but obviously not what I had hoped for when I ventured to make the recipe).

Delicious! I make these with whole wheat flour and leave the rest of the ingredients the same. Sometimes I add the streusel topping from the "Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal Muffins." I've made these several times and they always come out moist and delectable. Best muffins ever!

These turned out very dry for me (crumbly) and I tend to like a denser cake/muffin than these were.  I also agree that these were much to salty (at least for my taste buds).  Perhaps with the baking soda, you could omit a portion of the additional salt.  They are otherwise a nice flavor, I just am not a fan of the consistency.

These muffins are fantastic.  Great texture and not too sweet. The outside gets a bit of a crust, and the inside stays soft. The only thing I did differently was use 2% milk instead of half and half because it was all I had available.  Turned out great.

I made this recipe exactly as written; no substitutions. Even with the stick of butter it was a little dry and crumbly, but the taste was excellent, and not as sweet as I thought it would be given the maple syrup and brown sugar. A nice addition with my cottage cheese for breakfast.

These have a great flavor.  Mine were not runny like other reviewers said, although I did use slightly less than 1/2 cup of milk.  I also used skim milk instead of half and half.

This recipe is quite tastey.  I did find them extremely crumbly, but 
I didnt try soaking my oats so I might try them again. I added exra baking powder and the tops still sunk in.  Also, I used a mashed banana instead of half and half.

My muffins fell apart a bit too, and were a little salty. next time i will try putting the oats into the wet mixture to soak for a few mins. before adding the flour mixture. However i love these muffins. My 4 year old daughter does too, thank god! I will Make these again and again. Thanx for a recipe that i can pass along to my daughter.

Although these were a complete disaster for me, I think it was partly my own fault. I should NOT have over-filled the muffin cups! It's 30 out this morning and I had smoke alarms going off and had to open doors and windows! Needless to say, I was forced to remove them before they were thoroughly cooked. The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because (what I could salvage from the ends) was very tasty. I also thought the batter was a little runny putting them in the muffin cups.....more like a cake batter.

We live in maple syrup country so I just had to try these.  Unfortunately, we found them to be way too sweet and although quite moist, they fell apart very easily, just like previous reviewers.

Very good recipe but as per other reviews  I only add in 1/2 tsp of salt and used unsalted butter. I also added in 1 cup of walnuts. Only add enough mixture to fill half of the muffin cup as they rise a lot. Thank you very much for the recipe, I will continue to use it.

Yummy! I love the crispiness of the top.  
So the only thing I did different was I did use Grade B real maple syrup, but I also used a scant tsp. of maple flavoring plus the vanilla extract, and I used pecans instead of walnuts. That just seemed to be a better combo, but I'm sure the walnuts would be great too. And I omitted the cinnamon. Oh and I probably used maybe a 1/3 of a tsp of salt, not the full tsp. I'm sure that would have been too salty.
These are very tasty. Thanks for the recipe My2Girls.

I read some reviews on this recipe, so I altered it a bit. I didn't change any ingredients, just soaked the oatmeal in the milk & syrup while making the rest up as I read they sunk in the middle. Well mine turned out beautiful, all pumped up in the middle as a muffin should be. Hope this helps. They taste great too & didn't crumble while eating.

Was looking for something with REAL food in it, no artificial to give the kids for breakfast.  Was up early so I gave it a go.  Aside from using light brown sugar & whole milk and adding 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts, I I changed nothing else.  I did use real maple syrup and gave them to he kids with a little applesauce on the side.  LOVED THEM!!!!  As did my husband and I.   Yummy!   I may try and decrease the brown sugar a bit next time and see if they stay as moist.   All-in-all very pleased with this recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

These were really good - moist and great flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Only change I will make for next time is to cut the salt in half - just a tiny bit salty but otherwise a keeper!

Love these muffins.  I did some modifications.  1/4 cup of butter, 2 tablespoons of canola oil and 2 tablespoons of applesauce instead of the butter, 1/2 cup of light brown sugar, 1/2 cup of greek style plain yogurt instead of half-n-half and 1/3 of a cup of wheat flour and 2/3 all purpose.  I also soaked my oats and I put walnuts on top so they could get roasted.  YUM!!

Very good! Not too sweet at all. I followed other reviewers advice and used 1/4c yoghurt, 1/4 milk, and soaked the oats, and they didn't fall apart at all. I also added about 1/2c of oat bran to increase the fiber, and 1/2 granola for some crunch. Will definitely make these again, and play around with less salt and using whole wheat flour to improve the nutrition more.

These muffins smell delicious while baking and taste really good, but mine didn't turn out at all. They were flat and runny. I consider myself a pretty good cook/baker, but it could have been my fault and not the recipe. I think I will try these again because they really are tasty.

These are fabulous.   I used applesauce for the oil and fat-free half-and-half.   Just for fun I added a 1/4 cup of dried blueberries and a 1/4 cup of chopped dates, baked in a brownie pan (11 x 7 inches) for 35 minutes.   I cut into 24 pieces and have two at a time!   So decadent and yet they fit perfectly into my weight loss plan.

Too much salt - turned out too salty.  I would have added raisins to sweeten the muffins and reduced the salt (even omitted it).   Overall, it was okay.

So yummy! I made these a little healthier by using wheat flour,low sugar syrup and buttermilk. Also, noticing that some reviewers' muffins fell apart, I let the oats 'soak' in the wet ingredients for 5 minutes before I added the rest of the dry. Turned out perfect!

I followed the recipe to a tee.
These were very dense.  OK flavor. Will not make again.

I really like the taste of these muffins, but am having trouble kepeing them from falling apart. I did substitute 2% for the half and half (maybe too much water content?) and have tried the recipe with both margarine and shortening but to no avail. I also notice after I cream the fat and sugar together and add the syrup, the fat seems to break apart and separate out. Any suggestions?

I can't rate these accurately because I made some substitutions for ingredients I didn't have...2% milk subbed for the half and half, and I used four packets of strawberry oatmeal, and only used half the amount of brown sugar since that oatmeal was already sweetened.  These taste like oatmeal cookies, and they stayed together fine.

Very moist and not too sweet.  I used soy milk instead of half-and-half, and I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup regular flour.  I had no problem with the muffins falling apart.  I added chocolate chips, but I think that it tastes better without.

These tasted great, but were very messy.  I may have done something wrong, but they would not hold together.  They fell apart even after cooling.  I added the nuts, and had real maple syrup on hand, so the taste was very good.  I seem to have a lot of trouble with muffins for some reason, so the problem was probably with me and not the recipe.
