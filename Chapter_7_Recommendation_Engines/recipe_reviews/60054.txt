Delicious! This is some really good salsa! I cut the recipe in half and used a 14.5 oz. can of fire roasted tomatoes. I did cut back on the cilatro a bit and  upped the amount of garlic to 2 tsp. of minced garlic from the jar. I added 2 tsp. of apple cider vinegar, 1/4 tsp. of salt and 1/2 tsp. of sugar. I put this into my mini food processor and let it go.... I put it in the fridge for a couple of hours to let the flavors blend. Perfect with warm tortilla chips!

This was an awesome recipe.  I also added about 1/3 cup of chopped onion and a tsp of sugar.  I used Rotel chopped tomatos & green chilis to make it a little easier on myself.  My husband and I ate the whole thing in one sitting.

I love this recipe.  I actually didn't use a food processor, but chopped everything really finely.It was delicious! The only other changes I made were I added two cloves of garlic, a med size vidalia onion instead of the green onion, and no olive oil. It was till awesome.

This was REALLY yummy.

I halved this recipe, so in case we didn't like it we didn't have excess. I should have made the whole batch. 

I omitted the cilantro and used fresh parsley instead. (Noone in this house likes cilantro.) I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and added in a half can of chilies. I didn't have any peppers, so I used a couple generous shakes of Tabasco and I also added a shake of Worchestershire sauce.

Very, very good. I'll for sure make this again.

Just bought my first food processor to help satisfy my salsa addiction.  I also used rotel diced tomatos with chili's.  This was delicious!!! My boyfriend only got a few bited before I hijacked it and finshed the bowl myself. Plan on keeping some made up in the fridge all the time!

Very good, but it wasn't spicy enough.  I am going to leave the seeds in the jalapeno peppers and see what happens!  I also used yellow onions instead of green.  Very easy to make though!!!!

Excellent salsa. I used 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can rotel, added 1/2 chopped white onion and only had one jalape√±o so also used a small habanero. Forgot about the oil and didn't really need it. Won't buy store salsa again - too easy!

This is good but added chopped white onions, since we love them so much. Used petite diced tomatoes. Used garlic from the jar. Omitted the oil. Quick and easy. We are salsa addicts.

oh my goodness....this is SO delicious! I made a few changes based on what I have on hand, and it turned out fabulous. I used fresh grape tomates (about 15-20), 1 tsp sugar, salt and pepper, and 1/4 white onion instead of green onion. This is a keeper!!

Incredible recipe!! I only changed the tomatoes into crushed tomatoes since I am not a big fan of tomatoes. My mother in law even kept raving about the salsa! LOVE it, and it tastes better chilled for a little while so the flavors can mesh!

Love this recipe! I opted to omit the oil and replace it with some salt and a pinch of sugar.  I also used only half of a jalapeno to keep it mild. This is very similar to my favorite Mexican restaurant's salsa.

This was very yummy, but I needed to make a lot more for a big party.  So I blended 
4 cans of stewed tomatoes (not drained), 
chopped 1 whole white onion, 
2 cloves of minced garlic, 
juice of 1 lime, 
2 teaspoons of cumin, 
one- 4 oz can of green chilies and
1 bunch of fresh cilantro leaves chopped.  
Since I was making it for the first time, I was hesitant to add any spice to it.  But it was VERY yummy.  I think it taste like the salsa from ON THE BORDER without the kick.  Next time, I will add a can of hot rotel tomatoes and blend that in with the other flavors since we know how hot that will make the it in the end.  ENJOY!

This was so simple to make and had a great flavor. It can be forgiving too. I have even made it with 1015 onions and canned jalepenos with good results.

Great salsa recipe using canned tomatoes.  Other than chopping by hand rather than food processor, followed the directions but left out the olive oil- 1 tsp with all those tomatoes seemed like an afterthought.

I will mix fresh and canned tomatoes nest time. The canned are a bit too tomatoe-y.

Very good! Used only one jalapeno, since that's all I had on hand, and three cloves of garlic.

Outstanding recipe.  The lime juice took too much "kick" out of the recipe, so I added some chili sauce.  Good stuff nonetheless.  Great job!

This recipe was good but needed a little bit of help. I like my salsa very spicy. The recipe as written is a bit bland. For extra flavor I took 1/2 of an onion, 2 tomatillos and and a tomato and roasted them in the oven for about 15 minutes. I added this to the salsa recipe. I also doubled the garlic and jalape√±o and added a bit of cayenne, some chili flakes and a dash of Mexican oregano. The end result was perfect!

This salsa is amazing! I have made it several times.  I omit the olive oil, no need. I dump everything into the blender and blend for a minute or so- not too long don't want it too smooth. I also add a little kosher salt which balances it all out for me. I reduced the green onion because of my daughter and chop them up finely ( not in blender).

A very good basic salsa recipe. I add a little salt and pepper, and also I like my salsa with regular onions rather than green ones.

Only change I made was to use herb & spices diced tomatoes and so leave out the cilantro, just cos that was what was on hand, and I used two green chilis with seeds to make it plenty spicy. Absolutely delicious salsa, this will replace my usual go-to recipe!
