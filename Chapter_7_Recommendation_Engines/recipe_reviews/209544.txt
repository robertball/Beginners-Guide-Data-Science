Very Good, though when I first took this out of the oven I was so disappointed because it was very watery. I let them sit about 15 minutes or so and it made all the difference...perfectly thick, the way scalloped potatoes are supposed to be. I increased the flour to 3 tablespoons and also added in about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder with the broth/milk mixture. Also, I didn't have dried basil on hand, so I just used italian seasoning. After I put a layer of potatoes in the pan (I used an 11x7 pan and it was the perfect size), I sprinkled with the salt and pepper and put on a layer of chopped onions and a little parm. cheese before adding 1/2 the sauce. Then I repeated. These had wonderful flavor and no one would ever be able to tell that these are low fat! Just remember, let them set for atleast 15 minutes, so they can thicken up nicely. I will be using this recipe again for sure! :)

Ok - these potatoes are to die for!! So delicious.  I used a tsp. of dried basil and I used more cheese - proablly close to 2 cups.  I know this made the recipe less "skinny" but so so good (just added some cheese in between the 2 "layers" and then added cheese to top at the end as recipe suggested). I also added a little more flour to the "sauce" part just to get it a little thicker.  These came out perfect! Husband loved them! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good scalloped potato recipe. I substituted vegetarian broth, otherwise I followed the recipe as-is. It is very simple to prepare with good results. Recently, I prepared this recipe for some relatives on a low sodium diet and substituted  fresh mushroom broth (made without salt) for the vegetarian broth.

I made these to go with duck for a Christmas dinner with my husband.  I added some onions in with the potatoes and made them in a round casserole.  They were wonderful!  I love finding healthier holiday recipes that let us enjoy a nice dinner while still watching what we eat.

I loved them!! I was looking for a scalloped potato recipe using stuff I already had.  I ended up using cheddar though and alot more of it.  It was soo tasty and gone in a flash.

These are just totally AWESOME!  I substituted one, seeded and finely chopped jalapeno pepper for the basil (I sprinkled them between the first and second layer of potaoes) and used Pepper Jack Velveeta Cheese instead of the Swiss Cheese.  I also layered the cheese between the first and second layer, and added some cheese on the top also.  Covered and baked for 45 minutes and out came perfection!  I did not uncover the last 15 minutes to brown, but will do so the next time I make this dish - I always thought the "boxed" scalloped potatoes were good - now that I have tried this recipe, I'll never go back!

I liked the idea of this recipe, but as written it didn't work for me.  My potatoes weren't cooked completely, even though they were sliced 1/8 inch thick, and the end result was pretty bland.  I do recommend letting it sit 15 minutes after it comes out of the oven, as others suggested, to let it thicken.  I might try this again adding garlic powder and using a more flavorful cheese.

I used organic chicken broth, organic red potatoes and fat free evaporated milk to make it creamier. I did make a roux out of the flour and a couple tablespoons butter, like I would with any bechamel sauce and cooked it until toasty brown. I didn't add basil but I did add my own touches, the same additions I add to macaroni and cheese: 1 tablespoon dijon mustard, a couple shakes Frank's hot sauce, a teaspoon each of onion powder/garlic powder and fresh ground pepper. With the layers of potatoes, I did add some chopped onion. Right before covering with foil, I lightly sprinkled fresh parmesan cheese over the top. This fit perfectly in an 8x8 baking pan. It baked up very nicely and really beats any boxed mix you could ever find. I think the additions I made really made it shine.

I make this all the time. I don't use any oil, I don't see any need for it. I also add some garlic powder and I like to use pepper jack cheese instead of swiss. This gives a lot more flavor.

I used skim milk, so in order for the sauce to thicken, I had to add another 1/2 T. of flour.  I found this recipe to be good but not as flavorful as I would have liked.  Next time, I will layer onions with the potatoes and add some garlic powder.****I made the mistake of making the full recipe for just 2 people.  I ended up taking half of this dish and making potato soup with it.  I sauteed onion, celery, and garlic in a little butter.  Then I added the left-over potatoes.  I let the potatoes and sauce heat up so I would know how much liquid to add.  I added almost a full can of chicken broth and then just poured in some FF evaporated skim milk to get the right consistency.  I added some salt and white pepper and had delicious potato soup.

The key to this dish is to let it sit for quite awhile after removing from the oven. More than 15 minutes, I think. I ended up serving it while it was still slightly runny and when I went to put the leftovers away, it had firmed up into a very nice sauce. I think I would use different cheese to add more flavor. Oh, and I did not cook the potatoes before hand, just sliced them very thin and layered with the sauce and cheese and cooked for an hour. An easy potato dish if you are hungry for scalloped potatoes

Great! This was my first time to make scalloped potatoes, and they went over well. I grated parmesan over each layer.

These were really good! The sauce didn't really thicken up, but the flavor stuck to the potatoes well so I didn't even miss the sauce!

This was a delicious dish! My whole family was very impressed, and I will definately be making this again! My only issue was the cook time - instead of 30 minutes, mine ended up taking 1 hour 15 minutes before it was cooked... I'm not sure what I did wrong, but this dish is definitely worth the time and effort for me to perfect =)

These are to die for.  I used cheddar cheese instead of swiss, at the request of my husband, and added Parmesan cheese.  I also put bacon in every layer.  They were a huge hit.

As far as flavor is concerned, these are super for a little healthier version of scalloped potatoes - my hubby didn't know the difference!  I also sprinkled a little Parmesan cheese between the layers to give it an extra kick of flavor without too much guilt.  I did have to cook a little longer than the recipe says, but since I had time and kept an eye on them, they turned out great.  Definitely let it sit for a few minutes to firm up before serving, or it'll be potato soup on your plate.  I'll be making these again.

Just made this for Easter dinner.  It was a hit with the whole family.  I had to cook the broth mixture for about 10-12 minutes as it was not thick enough in the time alotted in the recipe.  It was  a bit runny when it first came out, but it did thicken nicely upon standing, and the runniness did not affect the flavor.

I substituted homemade beef bone broth for the chicken broth.  I thought the recipe was a little bland. Next time will add a seasoned salt and a little pepper sauce.

Loved these!  They are every bit as delicious as the recipe that usually make that starts with 1/2 cup of butter.  The only change I made (based on what I had) was to not use swiss cheese.  We don't really care for swiss cheese, so I used a little cheddar and a little mozzarella.

This is a nice EASY and simple recipe! I LUV it when I run across a recipe that calls for ingredients that I have on hand. This is a good flavorful dish that doesn't require any special attention. You scrub or peel potatoes, whip up the other ingredients, layer, pour and you are good to go. I often have a chicken "base" on hand and use that instead of broth. Also I use what ever milk and cheese I happen to have in the fridge. My husband LOVES this dish and I also love that it's something "else" to do with potatoes.

Easy and delicious!  The entire family enjoyed them and I'll definitely make them again.  I made the recipe as directed, although used the brand of chicken broth I had on hand.

I loved these potatoes! The only thing I did different was, cut thick squares of sliced smoked ham and placed between each layer...it was amazing, will definitely use this recipe again.

This dish was quite disappointing to me. It came out extremely runny even after I'd cooked it a little longer and let it sit. I also used cheddar cheese in mine as opposed to the Swiss (I'm not a fan of Swiss). I suggest using more flour in the recipe and also sprinkling onion and garlic powders on the potatoes.

Great "skinny" potato recipe.   Added cheese to first layer as another poster did.  Great recipe.

bland and uninspired as written.  Potatoes cooked fine, they just don't have much flavor.

Maybe I did something wrong but this dish came out terribly bland and tasteless.
