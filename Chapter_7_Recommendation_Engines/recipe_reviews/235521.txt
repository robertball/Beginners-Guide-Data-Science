Very interesting to say the least! The pan needs to be very well greased or it will fall apart. It doesn't rise like regular banana bread. That's ok. It is very moist and the batter will appear very runny. That's ok too. The flavour is pretty typical of banana bread and surprisingly doesn't taste like chick peas. The freaky part is the texture. It is not typical! It is screaming for some nuts. As I was pouring this into the loaf pan, I realized the texture was going to be a little off-putting and I added some pecans. In my opinion, it saved the bread. I only put a fist full and wish I had put more. I will make this again and add at least a cup of pecans or walnuts. My family liked this banana bread and I didn't tell them what was in it so thumbs up for that! I'm glad I tried this recipe. Thanks for sharing  Idena Suzanne.

This "Grain Free Banana Bread" is a nice treat. I quite enjoyed this VERY MOIST (can't emphasize moistness too much) loaf warm straight from the oven, although it did not initially taste like anything in particular (not bananas, not dates, not cinnamon, not ginger, and certainly not chickpeas); however, by the next day it did taste like a very moist banana-date loaf and I had to change my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars. Be sure to make this loaf a day ahead! I would add a lot more spices if I were to make it again so that it would be more like a "banana-date spice loaf." I made mine in my blender (wide-based Kitchen Aid) since I was making my own almond nut flour that way anyway. It has been my experience that baked goods made with homemade almond flour rise better ("normal results") than baked goods made with commercial almond flour ("flat results"). I blended all the ingredients together well in the blender except the baking soda and dates. I was concerned that my baking soda would go flat in the blender, so I added it at the last second to blend it. I was also concerned that my soft hand-pitted hand-chopped dates would be over mixed, so I stirred them in by hand. My loaf rose well but took took an extra 10 minutes in the oven. Thank you Idena Suzanne for sharing your recipe.

Made a double batch for a recent multi family ski trip.  It was so moist, flavorful and loaded with protein.  A great breakfast on the go.  Luckily there was a little leftover and it's been my "take to the office" breakfast for the past two days.  Keep it refrigerated well wrapped and it stays fresh and almost English pudding moist.

We loved it.  I used coconut oil instead of butter and added a handful of chocolate chips.  We liked that it was so moist.  It was hard to believe it was so healthy and yummy at the same time.

Wonderful gluten free bread. I've made this at least a dozen times. I didn't change the recipe except the kind of canned beans I used. I've used white beans, kidney beans and even black beans. (No pork and beans LOL). It's been good every time. I'm done blending almost the same time my oven is pre-heated. Fast and delicious.

This recipe was delicious!  Very healthy and good flavor.  Ours turned out a bit too moist, much like bread pudding.  Next time I will try adding some oatmeal to give it a bit more structure.  Thanks for sharing!

Healthy but boring,   I am so disappointed!  I made this recipe yesterday afternoon for this morning's breakfast.  My husband (a family practice doc) and I are very much into eating healthfully, and try to avoid empty carbs as much as possible.  So, this recipe immediately caught my attention.  I made 3 changes, to improve the texture, but they did not change the overall flavor of this bread.  (1) I used almond meal instead of almond flour. (2) I folded in 1 cup of chopped walnuts immediately before pouring the batter into the loaf pan. (3) I used 2 teaspoons of baking powder,  instead of 1 teaspoon of baking soda, because I knew that the batter would react more evenly to the baking powder.  
The overall texture of the resulting loaf was very good, not "pudding-like" as some have described.  I do think that the better texture was due to my changes.  But,  the flavor is just boring.   I'm all for eating more healthy foods, but they have to taste good, as well.  Neither my husband or myself could taste the  banana, the ginger, the dates or the cinnamon in our thick bread slices this morning.  And, just for the record, my bananas were quite ripe, the dates, almond meal, and ginger were fresh.  All high quality ingredients . . .  but the flavor was just "meh".   I am not a person who likes chocolate chips in most things, but in retrospect,  good quality ones might help this recipe immensely.  It definitely needs something to add a major flavor boost.

Who knew chickpeas would be great in banana bread??  I certainly didn't but I love how this turned out!

I have to say I was hesitant at the beginning as I have made loaves with almond flour and turns out flat. Also, the chickpeas in the mix didn't totally convinced me so, I modified the recipe:  I used half cup of chickpeas (instead of 1 cup) and added 1/4 coconut flour and 1/4 of arrowroot flour (still gluten-free!) to add more volume. I didn't have dates or ginger so I skipped them (didn't miss them!) and used only 2 eggs. I added chocolate chips (wheat and dairy free) and some walnuts. I let it cool down in the pan for about an hour or two and then put it in the fridge as it was late at night. I tasted it this morning and it was delicious!!! Next time I will totally use the chickpeas it calls for, it makes it a bit denser than if it was only with gluten free flour.

This recipe is great.  My sister in law had major surgery so I decided to make some meals for her family while she was recovering.  They are gluten free and this was a good choice to try!  I didn't have chic peas but I had black beans.  So I used them instead.  Delicious!

i've made this a couple of times as a loaf and it always came out as mush.  very very tasty mush.  i tried the recipe as muffins instead and they are perfect.  followed the recipe, made six large muffins, baked them for forty minutes.  so moist and dense and really flavourful.  easy recipe and clean-up, just put it all in food processor, don't even need to get bowls dirty.  pretty cheap to make too.  i will absolutely be making these as muffins again.

These are delicious! I had never tried to bake with chickpeas before, and was dubious about what the results would be, but I was very happily surprised! Even my fussy 5 year old was more than happy to eat these (and that was after I reduced the sugar content too) ??

I made this, and it was very good.  I made only a few changes.  I added a 1/4 more almond flour and used 2 tbsp stevia instead of honey.  I would use banana extract instead of vanilla next time.  Not a real strong banana flavor.  Like a lot of banana flavor!  very moist and delicious.

Yummy! I made it with coconut flour rather than almond because that is the alternative flour I had on hand, and there is no taste of coconut to me. After reading reviews I did add 1/3 cup quick-cooking oatmeal and 1 TBS brown sugar. Fiber content should be higher than total carbs, plus the beans and eggs bump up the protein. I will make this one again!

Fantastic. Haven't tried it warmed up but I think it probably tastes better cold from the fridge. It's dense and flavorful (moist, not springy like a typical flour-based bread) and tastes like regular banana bread. I have had a hard time not eating too much at once! Will make again.

It's very most. The banana flavor is subtle; I probably needed to let them ripen more. The top sunk in while cooking. Overall good flavor and I think my gluten free friend will like them!

I'd say the recipe calls for too much ginger - I'd halve the amount. Also yes it is moist and, for those of us who aren't low carb, vanilla ice cream on top is a very tasty addition.

Really good and moist, full of protein from the chickpeas.....I however I found it a bit sweet for my preference. So I tried other variations, subbing the honey for Coconut sugar (gives it a slight 'molasses' or brown sugar flavour. I also used melted virgin coconut oil in place of butter. I made another batch without the dates to lower the caloric content and subbed them some canned pumpkin for moisture and nutrition. I also added a scoop of Vanilla whey protein powder for extra protein and vanilla flavour. It makes a great protein snack or dessert.

This recipe is simple and the Banana bread turned out great.....I used regular flour since I did not have Almond Flower and added about 3/4 cup of almonds.  Superb!!!

I will use almond flour next time; also, the recipe made exactly two loaves.

I added sour cream. Was super moist; almost like a cross between a cake and a pudding.  I baked it for 55 minutes, which was too much.  Served it with Cool Whip, and that was great!

I think I did it incorrectly. The bread turned into a thick pudding. It tasted great!! And the bread pan was just a pudding bowl. I plan on trying this another time with my ripe bananas.
