I altered the recipe after reading other reviews and it came out even healthier and still very yummy.  I did half all purpose and half wheat flour.  Instead of butter I used equal parts homemade apple sauce allrecipes.com/recipe/sarahs-applesauce/  (I omitted the sugar in the apple sauce recipe)  I used 1/8 cup plain Greek yogurt and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup brown sugar.  I only had 3 bananas which turned out to be 1 1/4 cup after mashing.  I meant to add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla but forgot until just now and I threw in two palmfuls of craisins.  I baked it for 55 minutes in a loaf pan and wish I had taken it out at 50 when I thought it was done.  It was a touch over done but I will be making this again when I buy more bananas than we care to eat.

Very tasty.  I made 1/2 the recipe with two medium size bananas, and baked muffins. Only a 6-muffin tin would fit in our little toaster oven so there was some batter left over, but I believe the 1/2 recipe would have made 8 regular size muffins.

This was really good.  After 50 minutes though it was done, I add crushed walnuts and a little extra yogurt.  Delicious.  I like my banana bread more moist, not sure if it was me or the recipe.

I love this recipe, and have made it many times already!  I made a few modifications based off the other reviews in order to make it even healthier.  For the 2 cups of flour, I use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour.  In place of 1/4 cup butter, I use 1/4 cup applesauce.  I also reduce the sugar to 1/4-1/2 cup, depending on how sweet I want it.  And I add in a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.  I also use two 8x4 inch pans (since that's what I have), and it reduces the baking time to ~35 minutes.  Very delicious!

Using this recipe I made an even lower calorie version substituting pureed pumkin for the butter/yogurt and an egg substitute for the whole eggs, and then mixed in 1/4 cup of chopped dates.  It made a very dense, chewy, moist bread which is mildly sweet and surprisingly satisfying for not having any chocolate in it;) I'm sure it would have tasted even better w/the butter (let's face it, what doesn't taste better with butter?!).

I just made this last night and my very picky husband said this was the best i ever made. I made a bit of an adjustment with the flour using 1 cup white and 1 cup whole wheat, I added walnuts, a sprinkle of cinnamon, a spash of vanilla and topped it with some oats, brown sugar and butter. So not as healthy but it was very good...

A simple, healthy recipe that doesn't require a trip to the co-op for ingredients. i reduced the brown sugar by a 1/4 cup and used cream cheese instead of yogurt. Didn't bother measuring out the banana, simply mashed 4. Made 8 mini-loafs 4x2", baked for 18 minutes. Fluffy, moist, no-guilt, extra banana, banana bread.

I'm not much for reviews, but this warrants one. I made this recipe tonight, with a few modifications due to allergies. This recipe ROCKS. Super moist, very tasty & an entire loaf is gone! 

I mixed 1 cup wheat with 1 cup all purpose
6 tbsp applesauce in lieu of eggs

yummy!!!

Delicious!  Added fresh grated nutmeg (love the smell) and cinnamon to taste.  Also a cup of toasted walnuts.  Will make again.  Splendid.  Nice chewy texture, not dry and right amount of banana flavor.  Also, for more nutrition I substituted one cup of quality whole wheat flour for white.  To make mashing bananas easier, I use a potato masher.  Also, I use a micro grater and buy whole nutmegs.  They are easy to grate and it is such a difference in flavor and nutrition.

Made recipe pretty much as written. Only change was I used vanilla Greek yogurt. Bread was moist ( but in my husbands words not as moist as other quick breads i have made) and my husband liked it warm and cold( especially cold). I thought it needed more banana flavor but I may have had flavorless bananas.

Great healthy, easy recipe.  Good if you like a very moist, dense banana bread -almost cake-like, but not so sinful!  I've made it with chopped apples and pears to supplement the fruit content when I was short on bananas, and it was even more delicious! A loaf never lasts more than 24 hours at our home.

The bread came out very dense but was moist. For my preference, it was very bland even after I added a little nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla. And it took much longer to bake than the recipe says. I'm going to continue looking for a recipe.

This was EXCELLENT! A very nice, hearty breakfast bread. I could not get the wet ingredients to "fluff" but it did not seem to matter. I also added a little extra yougurt because I was 1/3 cup shy of bananas. Subbed in 1 cup organic whole wheat flour with 1 cup white flour. Added 3 tsp vanilla extract and about 2 tsp cinnamon...few dashes of nutmeg. SO DELISH! baked in a bundt pan @ 350* for 36 minutes. Turned out perfect!!

I modified it by using whole wheat flour, 2 c bananas, 1/2 diced apple and about a 1/2 chopped walnuts.  Everything else I used was the same & the cooking time was the same and it came out great! My husband said it was the best he has ever had. :) Thank you!

It was pretty bland, and I even took other raters' suggestions by adding vanilla extract and nutmeg. Very disappointing.

Very good with one two minor changes - reduced sugar to 1/2 cup (bananas VERY sweet) and used just 2 tablespoons butter making up the rest with nonfat yogurt.  Delish!

I loved this recipe! After reading reviews I decided to add cinnamon. It added a lot of flavor and I highly recommend adding it.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour and it still tasted great! Finally, I also switched out the sugar for splenda which really cut down on calories. I wouldn't really call the original recipe "healthy" but with some changes it really can be.

Just made this bread. I swapped equal amounts of apple sauce for butter and added chia seeds for the omega benefits. (You can also replace half the shortening in recipes using chia gel that you make from chia seeds: http://www.mychiaseeds.com/Articles/BakingMySeeds.html). I added walnuts and a handful of choc chips. I also cut back on brown sugar as we don't like things super sweet. Great bread!

My coworkers loved it - I made it with whole wheat flour and again with spelt flour to help with their dietary restrictions. It was fairly dense and heavy, didn't rise too much. It's impossible to make "light & fluffy" butter and sugar when you add yogurt, it just looks brown and goopy. I suggest adding the yogurt after you've mixed the butter and sugar until it's light and fluffy. I also added some spices - 1tsp each of cinnamon/nutmeg mixed with the dry ingredients and 1-2tsp vanilla extract mixed with the wet ingredients. We folded in pecans and chocolate chips at the end too! Super delicious and got great reviews from my coworkers.

I did not have plain yogurt, substituted vanilla greek yogurt.  My husband has celiac disease and can not have regular flour. Substituted 1 cup of gluten free flour and 1 cup of bisquik gluten free flour.  Worked/tasted just as good as the regular flour.  Make sure you use OVERRIPE bananas.

I used whole wheat flour instead and left off a quarter cup. Halved the butter and used more yogurt. Also added a cup of chopped walnuts.

The bread was denser because of the whole wheat but that's how I like it. It's possible that my bananas weren't ripe enough because it seemed to need a little more sweetness. Top with a little honey and peanut butter when serving for a flavor explosion.

Should have read the reviews before making! Definitely bland! Nice banana flavor and very moist. Could have used cinnamon or nutmeg.

I swear this started off healthy… but wow! I don't know what I did with this turned out wonderful! I took others advice and added wheat flour and I was also worried about what others were saying about it being too bland, so I added cinnamon, vanilla, raisins and…..Nutella!!! I didn't have brown sugar so I used regular granulated sugar, half a cup.  I also didn't have an electric mixer and had to mix everything by hand. I was a little worried about the butter and yogurt together as it looked like it was separating, but you couldn't tell in the end product. 50 minutes later it was done and is moist and light not dense as others were saying. I'm really glad I added all the extra stuff because that parts of the bread that are just the bread do taste a little bland, so I'm glad I added my raisins and Nutella.

Tried Courtenay's equal parts applesauce for butter substitute and only using 1/2 cup of brown sugar! I used 6 VERY ripe bananas (as in at least a week or so in the refrigerator after going brown). Also added CHIA seeds (2 teaspoons) for fiber and protein as well as some BANANA CREAM RUM (almost 1/4 cup). It's amazing! My mother's weary of my "healthier" version of foods but I'm sure she'll love this one!

Tasty! I used 5 bananas and added 2 scoops of cruncy peanut butter, some crushed pecans, and some honey. The additions made this bread super dense and filling enough to eat for breakfast on the way out of the door!

I substituted some gluten free flour (+xanthan gum) for fun. Results were excellent. :)

This recipe is very good, the bread was very tasty and moist, great texture. I don't think the cooking time is accurate when the oven is set to convection bake. I cooked my loaf for the suggested 65 mins and tested for done-ness with a wooden skewer which came out dry. After letting it cool and cutting into it, there was still some not quite cooked dough towards the top of the loaf. Next time I will increase the cook time to 75-80 minutes on the convection bake setting. Would rather it cook a little longer and become a little browner than have any uncooked dough. I also used a glass loaf pan which could have also been a factor.

I loved this banana bread more than my grandmother's recipe! Some alterations: I used 1/4 c yogurt instead of 1/8, had no brown sugar so I used only 1/2 c white instead, and also added about 1/4 c chopped walnuts. And without measuring, I just mashed up 4 bananas and the taste was perfect. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this last night exactly as directed.  Overall, it was yummy.  I appreciate the effort to make the recipe healthier.  It wasn't overly sweet.  I think next time I'll add some kind of spice, just a little to give it a bit more flavor.

I just made this..I’m always buying lots of bananas and will get to the last ripe ones and forget them. THIS CAME OUT FABULOUS! It is perfectly brown, leveled and smell/taste great. My yorkie is going crazy over the smell cause he loves bananas. Lol

For me this is just a tad too sweet.  Several commented they had reduced the sugar by half. 

Also there are several comments ( both positive and negitive) about this recipe turned out more dense than they are custom to. So if you liked the idea of a denser bread then just do the recipe as written. But ...f you want something a little lighter, and fluffier, then you can add a teaspoon of baking powder I would be sure to use aluminum-free though, to avoid the metalic taste.

I made the mistake of adding cinnamon and nutmeg like so many others.  Won't do that again. It killed the banana flavor. I mixed the dry ingredients and wet ingredients separately, then mixed the two only until they were combined. That seems to be key in having the loaf rise. Other than the spices it doesn't need, it was great.

This was wonderful, deep banana flavour and very moist. I used full fat Greek yogurt, it's what I had, and I added a handful of chocolate chips. Five, previously frozen, bananas = 2 1/3 cups for me. Thanks, I'll make this again!

Yes, I added a 1/8 cup of stevia and subtracted a 1/8 cup of brown sugar. Also, instead of the yogurt, I used applesauce. I had to adjust the baking time because I used 4 mini loaf pans instead of just one regular sized loaf pan. It was a great receipe and yes, I will be using it again.

I used a little more yogurt and less butter, and added vanilla, cinnamon and fresh  nutmeg.  I love  the flavor, but I let it bake for 55 minutes and the edges dried out.  That's my fault, I should have been paying attention, but was caught up in another project. The rest is moist and delicious.  I put pecans on top for a little crunch and extra protein.

I will definitely make this again. Thank you!

Excellent Banana bread.  Second time I have made this recipe I used half mini chocolate chips and half chopped walnuts instead of all choc. chips.  Also used MONK FRUIT sugar which has no glycemic index and no calories, no aftertaste.  (expensive but worth it!)) It's a great go-to very low fat tea bread~

Actually, I'm getting ready to make this tonight and I anticipate it will earn 5 stars!  My only question is: "What do you consider one serving?  How big is one serving?  How thick of a slice would that be?"  I have to count every calorie that passes my lips, so I'd really appreciate it if the author or anyone else has this information.  Thanks much!

Really good, I used 1/4 cup yogurt instead of 1/8 and it came out great. Very moist. I also added a cup of walnut pieces, and only 1/4 cup of sugar because I wanted less sweet, but that was too little. I will try 1/2 cup sugar next time.

I didn't have plain yogurt, so I made this without it. It's absolutely delicious! This is the second time I have made it.

Amazing as-is. Notes below.
As a personal preference I dump all the ingredients  into one bowl & stir. I add a tablespoon of of ground cinnamon,  and a dash of nutmeg.
Experimentation and shortage of ingredients have proven that whole wheat flour can be substituted for white, and sour cream can stand in for Greek yogurt! (I have made this soooooo many times.)
Moist, flavorful....perfect. This is perfect. This is the banana bread I will now make FOREVER and take EVERYWHERE!

I tried this recipe due to having an influx of bananas.  They were speckled brown but not over-ripe.
Being me, I had to tweak the recipe slightly and so made a few changes......firstly I added peanut butter, approx. 1/4 cup but I really just poured some in.  I forgot the vanilla essence but , hey.
I used wholewheat flour and added approx. 1/4 cup of oatmeal (actually mistook this for light brown sugar but it was in the bowl so what could I do?)  
I also added dark chocolate chips and no salt at all.
Oh, and a couple of handfuls of flax/sesame/sunflower seeds/.

Then I cooked some as cookies - simply a spoonful on a baking tray and some in a muffin tin and the rest in a small loaf tin.  I chose to bake them in this way to avoid the temptation to slice and add butter.
Cookies approx. 10-15 mins.
Muffin tin approx. 15 mins.
Loaf tin approx. 25 mins.

Absolutely divine!  Not sweet until you get a nice bit of mashed banana or choc chip, but they taste delicious and they must be pretty healthy too.
Will definitely bake these again and probably make different tweaks next time according to what I find in the cupboard!
These will be great for breakfast or lunchboxes.

I altered the recipe a little.
First time I made it I added chia, hemp and flax seeds. I didn't measure it as it was a spur of the moment thing.
Second time I measured out two tablespoons of the seeds (they're sold mixed by the bottle). Swapped out half the butter for coconut oil, 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/8 cup of honey, 1/4 cup of yogurt instead of 1/8 and about 1 tablespoon of mixed fruit.

I altered the recipe using some tips from other reviewers. Added 2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and also added about 1/2 cup apple sauce to make up for lack of bananas. Also used 4% fat plain yogurt and half white/half wheat flour. Bread is very moist. Not very sweet, but that's the healthy part. I think it would be tastier if I had used all banana.

Delicious just as is. I've made it multiple times, and always get rave reviews from my husband and son.
Sometimes I've added 1/4tsp cinnamon to the dry ingredients, and sprinkled the top of the loaf with cinnamon sugar before baking. 
When feeling more indulgent, I throw a handful or two  of chocolate chips into the batter. Yum!

I am only giving this 4 stars because I altered the recipe just a little bit.  Instead of plain yogurt and vanilla, I just used vanilla yogurt and added two tablespoons more for moistness.  I also added a tablespoon of cinnamon and a cup of fresh blueberries.  Everyone wants the recipe.  I also split the batter into two 9-5 loaf pans instead of one big one.  Bake only 40-45 minutes.

This recipe was great! I altered it a little since I made these for my 9 month old baby. As suggested in other reviews I replaced the butter with homemade apple sauce , added 1/2 cup sweet potato purée , 1/2 cup fresh mashed mango and 1/2 cup blueberries . With all the sweet fruit you do not need the brown sugar! They turned out delicious ! My baby loved the

This is the best banana bread I have ever made.  The only change I made was to add about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.  Also, I used 3 ripe bananas; not sure how that equates to the amount the recipe specified.

I had a bunch of over-ripe bananas that I didn't want to go to waste so, I googled "Healthy Banana Nut Bread"...This is the BEST!!!!  I love the fact that it used 2 1/3 cup of bananas!  Also, very little sugar, and the yogurt! Most recipies only ask for 1 cup of bananas. Thank you for this healthy version of banana bread!  I also made a cream cheese frosting with just a teaspoon of sugar and cinnamon mixed in!  Devine!!!! I also added cinnamon to the batter. Yummy! Five stars for sure!!!!

Very Tasty!  Only changes I made were I added pecans, vanilla, nutmeg & cinnamon.  It was a little overdone, should of baked it for only 50 min.  But it was still delish.  Will make again for sure.

Used a TON of bananas - more than I expected.  I subbed out 1/2 cup whole wheat pastey flour.  65 minutes is far too long baking time, as other reviewers have mentioned.  Good recipe; would make again.

I halved the recipe since I only had 2 bananas.  In decreased the butter to about a half tbsp, and substituted in milled flax seed for the rest of the butter.  Sorry, I'm am not good at measuring I tend to just eyeball things so these are approximations. I also used only an egg white instead of the whole egg.  Last I added a squirt of lime juice and about a half cup of unsweetened grated coconut.  It turned at good.

I didn't have quite enough bananas (about a cup and a half) so I added half a cup of blueberries and 2 Tbsp of crunchy peanut butter. In addition, I went with half all-purpose flour and half whole-wheat pastry flour, and put in 1/4 cup of yogurt instead of 1/8. I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg; a lot of changes, I know, but it turned out very nicely! For me, it took 25 minutes to bake the 6 mini loaves + 3 muffins. I'd try the just banana version, too, next time I have enough bananas! Yum!

As other reviewers suggested, I altered the recipe a bit. Used 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 whole wheat flour, splenda brown sugar (quantity cut in half as per the slenda directions) istead of regular brown sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla and 1tsp of cinnamon.  Also added 1/4 cup of raisins and 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I baked it as one large loaf so it ended up taking about 80 minutes in the end. The end prodect was absolutely delicious!

I made this recipe into muffins!  A little on the dry side but tasty none the same. I added some choc. chips to the batter, a tsp. of vanilla and about a quarter cup of molasses.  I also made a light glaze out of powdered sugar and milk to put over the top.  I will make these again.  Great for Breakfast with a little Greek yogurt, walnuts and honey.

I made this banana bread this weekend and really like it. I added walnuts, substituted white whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour to add protein and a whole grain, and used greek yogurt. The bread is dense but really good. I think I will try a little more yogurt next time and chocolate chips and vanilla.

Definitely a repeat.  Denser and not so sweet.  Appreciate the use of plain yogart as a partial substitute for the butter.  Again, good tasting bread.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I didn't have enough bananas, so I cut it in half and made up for the missing banana with apple sauce. Then I added some chopped walnuts on top. It was delicious! Very moist and full of flavor. I think I'll keep the apple sauce in it the next time I make it.

I was disappointed by this recipe because it lacks flavor.  It was moist, yes, and it didn't taste BAD, but it was very mild and bland, even with additional banana, added cinnamon and nutmeg, and substituting applesauce for yogurt.  I guess I should've also added vanilla.   I will NOT use this recipe again.  Maybe I'm just used to the deliciousness that is "Mary Ann's Moist and Nutty Carrot Loaf", as I've made that every week recently.

Love this recipe, and how it is healthier. I baked it in a bunt pan for 30-35 minutes and it came out perfect.

Excellent banana bread recipe.  The only thing I changed was to use non-fat vanilla yogurt because that was what I had.  I started testing it after 50 minutes.  It was perfect after 57 minutes in my oven.  Very moist and tasty

Very nice. I made it even healthier by using olive oil instead of butter and 1 out of the two cups of flour whole wheat. Also didn't have enough mashed banana   so added some pineapple instead. Still works.
