I thought this was a really good dish. We were looking for something a little different for Tex-Mex and this was perfect. I did add about double the lime juice and we didnâ€™t have sour cream so I subbed Mascarpone and Greek Yogurt but it still turned out really good. I love sauce so I doubled it and did a two layer lasagna. Thanks for the recipe!

I like lime, but it is way overpowering in this recipe. the next time I make this I'm going to add more lasagna on the bottom to hold the salsa mix, more salsa mix. less lime. cube the chicken. more seasoning all the way around. add more cheese into the layers -maybe even a stronger cheese like extra sharp cheddar? 
ultimately, the idea was fun, there was just not much flavor besides lime.
Also, I used a 9x13 to fit the lasagna and the amount of ingredients was just fine. I used about a pound of chicken.
