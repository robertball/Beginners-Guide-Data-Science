This turned out so good!!  Itâ€™s so cheesy and tasty. I followed the recipe except that I added 1 pound of ground beef. Delicious! I will definitely make this again!

It is a potluck and family favorite.  I use plain yogurt instead of ricotta.  Both are good.  Has anyone cooked this dish ahead for a couple of days?

While making this, I thought there was too much mozzarella. It was fine - delicious, and keto

I used one whole squash and lots of sauce, otherwise kept all the ingredients the same.  My teenagers loved it.

Excellent lasagna option for anyone avoiding pasta for dietary reasons. I only needed one good size spaghetti squash to fill the baking dish. The recipe makes a lot and reheat well.
