I did alter the recipe a little bit--not the ingredients, just the method.  I only had 2 apples for the 3 of us, so I cut them in half, cored them with a tablespoon, and filled them with the raisin mint mixture.  My daughter LOVED these, and it's a creatively different way to use up some mint from the garden.  We will make these again, they were delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly, and my family really didn't like this at all. I didn't find it too extraordinary myself. I'm kind of disappointed that I wasted apples on this recipe and won't be making this dish again.

The mint gives it a refreshing twist.  The taste is lighter than that of traditional baked apples.  One note: I only baked mine for 30 minutes and they were  done, so I think 50 minutes would turn them to mush.

This is a great take on an old recipe. The mint, at first, was a little odd considering the traditional cinnamon and the like, but it has such a refreshing taste that the oddity is soon dismissed. It's not phenomenal, but definitely worth trying. I didn't have fresh mint so doubled up on the dried mint.

We ate them, so they weren't bad.  But overall I didn't care for the mint.  It was very easy though, and my husband at them, so thank you.  We probably won't make them again.

I never have the mint when I decide to make these. Must get some. I serve this for breakfast along with toast some times or an after school snack.  
Cooking time varies depending on your oven and stuff. 
Yummy

Oh my goodness! I finally found this recipe! I have been looking for it forever. I first got it at the produce section of the grocery store and lost it! Since then I have "winged it" but I want this exact version. I can tell you by experience that you can use other kinds of apples as the red delicous are very hard and take a long time to cook. Just cook them for a little less time. This is such a healthy recipe with the mint and raisins! I will make it again but today am looking for a basic recipe as my room mate hates raisins!I also add cinnamon.
