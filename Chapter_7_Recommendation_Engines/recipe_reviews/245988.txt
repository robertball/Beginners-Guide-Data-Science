The pancakes tasted really delightful. They were fluffy, and the chocolate chips gave more flavor. I am looking forward to making this again.

I skipped the chocolate chips but made this otherwise exactly according to the recipe. My picky toddler inhaled three for breakfast. This is going into the regular rotation!

These are absolutely delicious and are the only pancakes we now make at home! They are fluffy but have a nice chewiness to them. We add frozen blueberries into the batter.

I think buttermilk produces a better pancake...  these were sour. Chocolate chips probably cover up the sourness, but I left them out in the interest of health.

I also added vanilla, and substituted kefir for 2 cups plain Greek yogurt and 1.5 cups water. Even without the chocolate chips they were great.

These came out great.  Made exactly as directed plus added 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Used honey kefir.

Amazing fluffy pancakes.  My daughter can't have traditional dairy, but my homemade kefir seems to be okay. This is a great buttermilk pancake alternative that doesn't contain additional milk or butter. These are lighter and fluffier than the pancakes we used to make with milk. And WAY better than using Almond Milk! Next time I may add a small amount of Vanilla or Almond Extract for a subtle flavor.
