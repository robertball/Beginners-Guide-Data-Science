My grandmother (babka) made these, but called them "Milosty" (pronounced Meel-o-stee).  She would wrap the dough in waxed paper and then refrigerate for several hours before rolling.  Once rolled thin, she would cut the dough into strips instead of triangles, then fry 3 strips together in lard (not canola oil) to make interesting shapes.  I love the powdered sugar on top!  A big hit at family gatherings.  These are seriously good!!

My Slovak Grandmother (Babichko) would make these....she called it "Bozi Milosti" or Liszti for short. Delicious...nothing lost in the translation!

These were just what I was looking for. Reminded me of watching my Babi make these. She also cut a slit in the center and curl them around. She would let me sprinkle the powdered sugar on them.  Thanks for bringing back great holiday memories.
