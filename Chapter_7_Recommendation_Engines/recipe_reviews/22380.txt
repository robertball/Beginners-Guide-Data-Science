I had already had this dessert from a friend & wanted the recipe so I searched here for it.  It was DELICIOUS but I was concerned about the raw egg SO I elimintated the egg whites into the pumpkin mix & substituted HALF of a 8oz. container of Cool Whip and gently folded in.  It was PERFECT and NO raw eggs.
