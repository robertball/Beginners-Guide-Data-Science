Either the temperature was too high or the cooking time was too long.  The sausages were blackened and the 'skin' was hard.  Almost uneatable.  I used Johnsonville sausage.

Loved it! So easy! Depending on the size if your bell peppers, you can use less olive oil than what is in the recipe. The 1st time I made it, it was too much oil for my little peppers, so the 2nd time I only used 1 tbsp of olive oil & it was perfect! My husband absolutely loved it and he grew up on sausage & peppers as he was born in Italy!

This was so easy and tasted great. Perfect for a no-fuss, one pot (ok, air fryer basket) dinner.

Your recipes inspire me to do things I might not think of.   This was one of them, but we did it on the grill, and it was excellent.
