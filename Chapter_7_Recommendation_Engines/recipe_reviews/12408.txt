I'm not a fan of molasses, so I didn't care much for the taste. I made this pie for my grandparents, who also have a Pennsylvania Dutch background. They loved it, and asked me to make it for them again soon.

This is a wonderful one pie recipe. My Pennsylvania Dutch grandmothers recipe makes 4 pies. This recipe is spot on.....it's a very old fashioned pie. Folks used what they had and in the depression ingredients werent easy to get. You either like this mild flavored pie or you don't! I for one happened to love it because it brings back memories of my childhood favorites made by some wonderful cooks. I also added the picture.

This was similar to a recipe I have, but mine called for 1/2 C. light corn syrup instead of molasses and only used 1/2 C. water and 1/3 C. sugar and 1Tbsp lemon juice for the bottom layer.

Could it be possible that the "bottom" portion of this recipe calls for too much water?  A cup seems way too much and the bottom is watery.  Help!
