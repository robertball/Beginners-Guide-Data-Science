I liked this recipe a lot, though I did make a few changes. I used whole grain brown rice instead of the white rice. I added 15 minutes to the cooking time and the rice and carrots were perfectly done.  It was a bit runny, but a dash of flour mixed in thickened it perfectly.  I skipped the onion powder since I didn't have any, but I added about a tsp cayenne pepper for a little kick. It was delicious.

My family and I found this recipe to be quite bland and somewhat soupy. Too much liquid for the rice to be "right." Also, the broccoli ended up overcooked by the time the carrots were done, despite having cut them into smaller pieces.

Very good!  I did make changes too.  I used Uncle Ben's Wild Rice and seasoning and Tyson grilled chicken strips (mix of regular and fajita for extra flavor).  Turned out great!

The recipe was really good! I had chicken and broccoli I needed to use, so I looked up the recipes and found this one.
We substituted cream of mushroom, and used Monterey Jack because we didn't have the ingredients. Also cut the chicken up.
Everyone really liked it, even the baby! Will definitely make it again!
