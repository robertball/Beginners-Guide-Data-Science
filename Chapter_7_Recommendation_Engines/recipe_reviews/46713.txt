I was looking for a good flatbread for some sandwiches and came across this recipe. I don't have a bread machine, so had to give it a shot without but it turned out great.  In lieu of milk powder I modified the liquid to 3/4 C Water and 1/2 C Milk.  I proofed the yeast in my Kitchen-Aid bowl with warm water and 1 Tbsp of the sugar.  Once that was ready I mixed in the remaining ingredients, let the dough hook knead for awhile, then put the dough into a well oiled bowl and covered to rise for about an hour until double in size. Punched it down and then split into 6-8 balls of dough for flatbread and let those rise about 30-40 more minutes. Rolled each one out and oiled and grilled per the instructions (only takes a couple minutes per side).  I topped with cooked chicken, bacon, cheddar, tomatoes and ranch dressing.  The bread really made the sandwich!

We love this recipe!  I make it with half whole wheat flour and half all purpose.  I top it with olive oil, salt and rosemary, and then we dip it in more olive oil.  It's wicked good!!!

I had a hard time on which recipe I wanted to try. I was looking for something comparable to a certain sandwich chain. Well, I am so glad I tried this one!! I made 6 flatbreads to make a steak sammy. This is so good. I did use the grill to cook these and let me tell you, SO wonderful. Soft and chewy. The grill adds the perfect touch. Who needs the chain sammies? This is great!

Fantastic.  I was looking for something different to try today.  When I came across this recipe, I knew that I had to try it because it had two of my favourite items in it (feta and garlic).  I made it for my husband and all he can say is 'Mmmm..'  This one is a keeper for sure. :)

5 + 5 stars!  I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make the dough and used my indoor grill to grill it since it's winter here.  It turned out great!  Hubby said "what WILL we do with it all"? (I divided the dough into 8 pieces and flattned & grilled)  Well...I thought about that and had an idea.  PIZZA!  After it's baked it reminds me of that pre-made crust you can get in plastic at the store....how good would THAT be?  It made a GREAT turkey wrap as well.  I can think of many uses for this yummy bread.  I made the recipe exactly as directed and it was perfect!  THANK YOU FOR POSTING.

I was looking to make Chalupa's (like at Taco Bell). I used my stand mixer and put in the first seven ingredients. I made 4oz balls (which makes 8 total). Rolled them out onto floured surface. Heat deep fat fryer to 325 degrees. Forked holes on both sides. Cook one at a time. Heat 1 to 1 1/2 mins and flip to cook other side. It turned out terrific!! Everyone loved them and we will do this again soon.

I wasn't even looking for a specific recipe, just browsing the 'daily recipes', when I happened upon this one.  I guess it was our lucky day because I decided on the spur of the moment to make this the star of our Sunday lunch.  I used 1 c of bread flour & the rest white whole wheat, divided the dough into 8 pcs, otherwise as stated in recipe. When on the grill, after brushing w/olive oil, I sprinkled on some kosher salt & a mixture of fresh herbs (tarragon, basil, thyme). After both sides were cooked, I sprinkled on some parmesan cheese.  We piled on cooked chicken breast, bacon, tomato, onions, lettuce, hot sauce & a bit of mayo.  With only a little preparation, I proved once again that the food I make at home is much much better and also cheaper than going out. Thanks to you, Sue!

.Just have to say this was a great crowd pleaser with my family.  I didn't have time to make a loaf of bread in the bread maker, so I made this dough and did it on my griddle.  It turned out great and so quick also. We can't wait to try it this summer on the grill and make a white, veggie  pizza

Great Bread.  Cooked a lot faster than I expected, within 1 minute I had to flip it. Beautiful bread, great for Hummus. I will make again!

Update, I have had to make this at least once a week. This is a great universal dipping bread and sandwhich bread. I have experimented with the recipe a few times by adding herbs and spices, AWESOME recipe. I have also been cooking it on my griddle inside the house, I have beter luck not burning it when I cook it inside.

We have this all the time with hummus. If it's too cold outside to grill, I just cook it on the griddle. It's good even without the garlic powder and feta.

This made about 6 flatbreads for flatbread sandwiches. They expanded once on the grill.

This is a keeper.  I formed 6 small rounds on parchment paper and then inverted onto the grill.   Make sure your grill isn't on too high.  I coated with garlic olive oil.  Delicious!

This is a great flat bread! We make it anytime we have hummus. I just cook it on our griddle inside, and sometimes just use white flour.

I LOVE this recipe and the grilling method. My mind is swirling with all the possibilities for variations. I did mine in my KitchenAid but love that it works well in the bread machine. Will do that way next time. I used my stovetop grill since I didn't want to fire up the BBQ in February. Followed as directed otherwise but added a little fresh basil. Really, really good!

5 stars for sure, and I can assure that my family is quite used to hand made breads of every conceivable kind, I do bake a lot. This bread is awesome, truly: I followed the directions, put some dried rosemary and garlic paste while mixing the flour. It really takes a couple of minutes on the grill, but the taste is wonderful, and no trouble at all. I think we'll never grill a thing without this bread on the table!!

Freaking awesome bread.  I know it sounds ridiculous, but I actually grilled it on a George Foreman grill.  (Yeah, I know, but I didn't want to fire up the grill at 10pm)  It turned out awesome.  I sprinkled garlic, onion, and Kosher salt on the most recent batch, before grilling.  The grill was a bit uneven, but it cooked fine, and folks loved it.

a very traditional recipe of bread in the country side of Chile is "Churrasca", they cook it for centuries. Churrasca is a flat bread which get cook on a small grill, a foot higher of the floor, Typically you keep all day burning inside of the kitchen, so you can have fresh bread every single meal. Have a burning grill inside of house is not an easy trick, only special kind of wood will give you a full burn with minimum exhaust of gases.  If you go to the north of Chile don't forget to ask for one of this. ;) every family has his own recipe.

Did not use any powdered milk added 1 tbs of regular milk instead. Everything else was the same.  Oh I didn't use a bread machine either! All you need to do is need the bread for about 10 minutes let it sit for a little and roll it out.

I am rating this 5 stars for the dough. I can't count how many dough recipes I have tried from this site. Bread, flatbread, pizza dough recipes. Some have been good, some not so much but this is the BEST so far. When it came out of my bread machine, the dough was the ideal consistency. Generally I have trouble with the dough being too sticky to work with and I have to keep adding flour. This one was absolutely perfect. Easy to divide, easy to roll out, it didn't keep sticking to my mat or rolling pin..and it tasted great! I didn't do the feta thing. I grilled it and used it as a base for the pizza I was making last night. Tonight I'm using what's left to make little flatbreads to accompany dinner. If I only had some feta.....

I made this in the bread machine as written. I did have to add extra flour to mine since I did not have bread flour on hand. These are so addicting good. I made several smaller flat breads. I used my induction oven doing 4 minutes per side on medium heat. If you top them with feta I am not sure you need anything else. However, I did make these along with some good Indian food.

We really enjoyed this flatbread! I had to make it indoors on my griddle as the weather did not co-operate. I did 5 minutes a side which was perfect. I would reduce the sugar to 1 tbsp next time, I reduced salt to 3/4 tsp and had to add about 1/2 cup of extra water as it was quite dry at the add in beep.

DELICIOUS! I used LOL brand spreadable butter with olive oil and sea salt in it, instead of plain stick butter and cut the dough into 6 pieces, sprinkled garlic powder & parmesan  cheese on the olive oil. Will definitely be makimg again, my 13yo daughter loved it too! Hubby isn't a huge bread lover like me, so I don't know if he'll love it as much as me.

Good grill bread.  It was a tad sweet for our tastes, but we used parm instead of feta.  Easy to roll and grill.  We will definitely have again but with a little less sugar.

This is the pizza crust recipe that I have been looking for for years!  I make it in my bread machine, divide it up in personal pizza sizes, stick it in the freezer and pull it out when I want pizza.  It is tender yet crispy thin crust, roll it out, brush with EVOO, top and bake.  Thank you!

Subbed milk for water. Omitted powder. Used bread machine yeast. Great base. Not sure what to top with yet. Good with bruschetta chicken or oil with italian seasoning, garlic salt, sea salt, and ground black pepper.
