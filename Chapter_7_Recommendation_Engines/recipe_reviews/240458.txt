Wow, I could eat the entire bowl. This is that good. Such a versatile recipe that  the heat and lime juice can be adjusted to your liking. Definitely a keeper! Thank you mommy for such a great recipe.

Nice change to traditional non-creamy coleslaw. I would have given 5 stars but we all found the lime too overpowering. I had to add a little agave to balance it out. Still a really nice slaw. Served with Mexican pulled pork from this site. Nice pair. Thanks mommy.

This was great! Made as is. The La Costena pickled jalepenos were spot on. We made a huge batch for football on sunday. Originally it was just supposed to be a chips and salsa substitute, but it was so tasty that we also added it as a topping to another authentic spanish rice recipe, and then mixed into carnitas burritos the next day. i will definitely make it again just the way the recipe calls for.

I ran out of chili powder and cayenne (WHO DOES THAT) and used only about 4 tablespoons of lime juice, but the recipe still turned out really really yummy!  Added a great flavor as a topping to our carne asada.

The recipe was good but with some little adjustments, it was fabulous.

I did not have any cilantro or pickled jalapeño.   I used diced canned nonpickled jalapeños. 

Awesome flavors.  Everyone loved the extra kick.

I made this salsa that we even ate as a slaw. The adjustment I made was frozen Green Chili. Frozen green chili allowed me to have control of the level of heat. I only added the cabbage, tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, lemon (we prefer lemon over lime), salt and pepper.  

It was simple. It made a lot but didn't last long. My family chowed down on it. Some added season salt and garlic powder.  My mother in law ate it as it was and LOVED it!

Easy to make and absolutely delicious. Great with any Mexican meal. It is the side that I have been searching for.

Very close to the one we recently enjoyed in a mexican restaurant with chips.  We halved the recipe for the 2 of us and used it to top our tacos.  Very different and fresh.  Still had some left, that I will ude as a side ( like coleslaw) tonight.

I made this for the first time this weekend. Reviews were unanimously, "too tart/sour" so I added stevia to sweeten and take the tart edge off. I also added a little more salt and pepper. After that the reviews were more along the lines of, "dreamy" or "fabulous!"Keeper.
