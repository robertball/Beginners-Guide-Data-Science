Ok full disclosure: I made a few VERY MINOR modifications so I could use hat I had on hand. At the end I was licking the pots the spoons everything. It was amazing. I modified: - elbow macaroni for penne pasta. (Not whole wheat) - Philly light cream cheese for Neufchâtel - marble instead of mozzarella - Aylmer brand garlic and olive oil finely diced tomatoes instead of plain diced tomatoes. - when I poured in my spaghetti sauce in order to clean out the Bottle I poured in 3-5oz of leftover white wine swished it in the bottle and dumped that into the sauce Finally I added 2 tsp of sirracha garlic chili sauce for a tiny kick. Go forth and pasta bake you won't regret it!!!

I found this recipe on the Kraft website and it is fantastic. The only thing different I did was add the spinach to the chicken and sauce mixture rather than the pasta. It clumped up badly in the pasta but not with sauce. Add some crushed red pepper for a little kick.

My family loved it! I tore the spinach leaves before cooking also added extra cheese and pasta. Made it in a 9x13 pan and broiled the top the last few minutes. Easy and tasty! Will definitely make again.

This was good but not great. We ate it I would make again for a change of pace but would not add it to the regular rotation.

Well it was a really good base and for that I am giving it 3 stars. But I followed the directions and it was really REALLY bland. It needs a LOT of seasoning--garlic oregano more basil little salt & crushed red pepper would really make the world of difference. One reviewer mentioned adding a little wine to the sauce; that would probably be awesome. I'll make it again but not just like the recipe.

This recipe is so great! My wife and I both agree it's the best pasta dish we have ever made. We did add some fresh garlic to cook with the chicken after adding the pasta sauce. I added crushed red pepper to my bowl to get more of a bite. We will definitely be making this recipe again!

08-19-2-15 The whole family loved this pasta dish. I seasoned the chicken mixture with salt pepper and garlic powder and doubled the Neufchatel cream cheese. Other than those additions I followed the recipe exactly as written. Quick easy and delicious. 03-28-19 Update: Made this again today with Italian Hot Sausage instead of chicken. Seasoned it with salt pepper garlic powder and doubled the Neufchatel cream cheese. Just as good.

Thanks for the great recipe! I doubled it and used a 9x13 glass dish- worked perfectly. I didn't have enough chicken on hand and I wanted more veggies anyway so I added 2 small sliced zucchini and a can of rinsed and drained cannelini beans. Also used thigh instead of boob because that's what I had. Saute'd the chicken with diced onion and deglazed the pan with a splash of white wine added some rosemary and red pepper flakes... All of the changes I made were basically minor/superficial. The bones of the recipe are spot-on. Play around according to your tastes and what you have. The recipe works! Will DEFINITELY make again! Even without meat alltogether!

we loved this recipe. I made a few tweaks based on other reviews. I added fresh garlic and onion while cooking the chicken. I also added the spinach to the tomato sauce instead of cooking in the pasta. I added a dash of red wine and a sprinkle of red pepper to the tomato sauce. my guys loved it!

My husband and I LOVE this dish...I made it for dinner tonight and he gave it an "8." I did not have Neufchatel so I used cream cheese instead. Like another reviewer I put the spinach in with the sauce. I especially like good meals that are easy to prepare and this one hits the mark. It is a good comfort-food cold day meal and I will be making this again soon!

I followed the directions for the most part. Ok here comes the except.....I am adding this information just to show how versatile this recipe is. I had a half pound of ground venison and a half pound of venison brats. I browned them with the onions put in a jar of Prego mushroom sauce and can of diced tomatoes. I added a little of red wine to the jar of Prego to get out of all of the sauce. I then followed the recipe. This was very good.

I followed this recipe mostly. I only used Mozzarella and instead of spinach I used zucchini. I must have baked it too long because the chicken was dry. Other than that it was really good.

As a somewhat newly single dad half the time for three kids I ve been learning to cook meals for us to keep from going out. This one is a definite keeper! I use rotini instead of penne cause the only penne I can find is wheat which I know my kids will turn their noses at. I usually double everything because I like to have leftovers as well. First time I made it with the spinach didn t go over well with the kids. This second time I substituted broccoli florets and everyone loved it!! After baking I cover it with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese and then broil it because I love the crusty cheese topper. I m still learning to time that just right as you can tell by the burnt cheese but to me it was AWESOME!!

Three Cheese Chicken Penne Pasta Bake Haiku: "So mine was 'two-cheese. Oops no Neufchatel on hand. But hey it was good!" Other than not having the cream cheese I followed the recipe as directed (OK fine my hand may have been heavier w/ this addition of spinach b/c we love it and I added salt/pepper) pondering to myself "how is this going to be flavorful when the only seasoning is dried basil?" but for as simple as the ingredients (and prep!) were it turned out surprisingly tasty!

This was an awesome meal. But I have to admit I didn't follow the recipe exactly. (Don't get upset....I just didn't have all the required ingredients.) Just some slight changes and added them in a different order.... First I sautéed chopped onion red and green bell pepper (no measurements) Then added handfuls of fresh spinach until wilted and set it aside while I fried the chicken just until no pink inside. Meanwhile I cooked the bow ties and also heated a whole 24 oz jar of Newman's pasta sauce since I had no chopped tomatoes. I added the sautéed veggies to the sauce as well as a few spoonfuls of whipped cream cheese (didn't have Neufchatel) and Parmesan and some fresh chopped basil. I drained the bow ties and put them into the bottom of a rectangular glass dish then chicken pieces on top of the pasta then the sauce mixture and last the Mozzarella and drizzled a bit more sauce on top of the cheese. Baked for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees. Fortunately what I made serves 4 and there are just my husband and myself so will devour the rest two days later. I can hardly wait for the rest. Deee-lish!!!!

Used more cream cheese than what was called for cause I love my cream cheese. Used romano instead of mozz because that's what I had on hand. Other than that I followed the recipe perfectly and LOVED it. Next time I will add some red pepper flakes to spice it up.

It was fine but nothing to write home about. I used diced tomatoes with basil oregano & garlic. I think some fresh garlic and onion and a little salt and pepper would have gone a long way. I won't go out of my way to make it again.

My family loved this. I used a bit more cheese and did cook the spinach with the chicken. When adding cheese to the top at the end I included some dabs of ricotta that I had and did a small sprinkle of the dried basil for looks. Yummy!!

I needed to make dinner but didn t know what to make. I knew I wanted chicken penne and tomato sauce. Stumbled upon this recipe and made it. I didn t have spinach and my tomatoes were seasoned in the can. I didn t add garlic but I added onions and peppers while cooking the chicken. I used Kraft Italian cheese and Parmesan cheese instead. I will make it again one day but add the spinach and omit the chicken.

I love this casserole. I modified the recipe a little based on what I had at hand and used a large jar of spaghetti sauce and not the canned tomatoes mozzarella and provolone mix instead of just mozzarella cheese and rotini instead of penne pasta. I also used a large can of white chicken instead of cooking chicken from scratch. That made the recipe a quick prep. It was delicious and lots of leftovers for freezing of individual lunches/dinners.

Simply put - AMAZING. Restaurant quality would definitely serve to guests. It even tastes great reheated the next day. It takes a lot for me to rate something 5 stars but this is honestly one of the best dinners I've ever made.

I had to make do with what I had so only one small can of tomato sauce was used. The cream cheese I used full 8oz Which made this come together. I cooked the chicken in olive oil with 3 chopped basil leaves and seasoned the chicken to my liking (adobo & pepper). Once cooked I added pasta (bow tie) spinach and cream cheese to the chicken and mixed well on low simmer. Now for the fun stuff. Butter the casserole dish and start layering as such...

I used a 13 oz package of perdue short cuts sprinkled them with garlic onion powder and basil then added a 14oz can of basil and oregano diced tomatoes undrained a 25 oz jar of marinara sauce cream cheese and fresh baby spinach chopped and brought that to a simmer. I then added 16oz cooked penne and mixed in 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese. Then poured mixture into a 2.5 qt casserole dish sprinkled it with grated parmesan and 1 cup of shredded mozzarella covered with foil and baked for 20min. It came out delicious and my family loved.

Well like others I tweaked it to make it better. I seasoned the chicken with salt pepper and the herbs. After browning I removed the chicken and deglazed the pan with about 1/2 glass of red wine then threw in a bit more olive oil onions garlic peppers and mushrooms. After about 5 minutes I put in the tomatoes and a few red pepper flakes and let it simmer. Then I added 1/2 bag of frozen spinach cooked some more put the chicken back in the cheeses and checked the seasoning. For my taste I added a fair bit of cracked black pepper and a bit more salt. Made a very comforting homey -type dish. I have a feeling the leftovers will be even better the next day.

I used already cooked chicken but would probably go by the recipe next time. I also used a four cheese cream sauce so I didn't add cream cheese. I did sprinkle some oregano and garlic salt. I poured half into the large round dish sprinkled mozzarella poured the rest and topped with mozzarella and parm. Go easy on the spinach. Much better cooking chicken as directed with a bit of seasoned ning salt. No spinach.

My family didn't enjoy the diced tomatoes added. It might have been better with just spaghetti sauce.
