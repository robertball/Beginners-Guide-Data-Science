I made as is and I was okay. I would add some celery or nuts to give it some crunch, and a few more seasonings next time.

Pretty good! I added chopped almonds and craisins for more texture and flavor. Agree with the others who say to cut the garlic input. Or maybe use garlic salt instead of garlic powder.

This is quick and easy and the combination of flavors is surprisingly nice. The warm potato plus the cool avocado is great. It's really quick and simple and great for someone who is trying to eat healthy and gain weight after surgery. This meal also fits a few specialized prescribed diets with its simple ingredients.

I put a twist on it adding sweetcorn and finely chopped slices of raw carrot , switched olive oil to walnut oil and some lime to finish. Great end result , felt the base recipe needed a little kick :) thanks for the idea !

I agree that it is a bit heavy on the garlic powder. I think a 1/2 teaspoon would work wonderfully! Great lunch recipe though! I'll be doing this again and again.

I followed the recipe as written and found it to be very garlic heavy.  I consider myself a garlic lover, but this was too much for me.  However, I did enjoy this recipe overall and it made a healthy and filling lunch.  The warm sweet potato melted the avocado a bit and turned some of it into a creamy dressing/sauce.  Next time I will not use the garlic powder, or perhaps only a tiny dash of it.  I think something for a crunchy element would be a nice addition, such as some roasted pecans or walnuts.  A nice base recipe that will be great for some changes based on personal taste.
