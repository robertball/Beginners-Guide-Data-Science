I used 2 of the crusts from the Pizza Dough II recipe from this site instead of the bread loaf, but kept everything else mostly the same-- the exception being that I used 1/2 a yellow pepper and 1/2 a red pepper in the mix. Black bean and corn salsa went well with this and it all came together very easily. Good the next day too, which is always a good sign for pizza.

Overall a nice choice.  It was something out of the ordinary. I like the contrast of hot food and cold lettuce and tomatoes.
