HANDS DOWN THE BEST Corned Beef and Cabbage I have ever tasted.  I followed the ingredients to the "T".  The only thing I changed was I put the beef on the bottom of the Crockpot, then the water mixture, then the veggies (minus the cabbage) then I added more water so the beef was completely covered, then I topped with the cabbage.  I cooked mine for 10 hours and it w falling apart by the time I had to cut it.  I actually sliced it up with a butter knife.  HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS RECIPE!!!

Great recipe, only, I put the corned beef on the bottom, red potatoes and whole carrots cut in 3 pieces on the top.  I used 3 cups (or enough to cover the meat) of apple juice instead of water, (no vingar or sugar) what a difference!!  I also use the Reynolds slow cooker liners for easy clean up.

This was a really good no fuss recipe - however the part of the roast that wasnt in liquid did not cook and was really tough so for dinner I just flipped it over, we ate from what was tender and then I just popped the top back on the crock pot and cooked it for another hours or so. With left overs I made corned beef hash - my husband had never had it and loved it.

I must agree, how do you fit everything in? I was only able to fit the cabbage, corned beef, and potatoes.  And I was only able to fit the potatoes after 2 hours of cooking and the cabbage had become soft.  Was going to cook the carrots separately but I got drunk and thought, "Screw it, no one here likes carrots anyways".  Other than that...turned out awesome.  My husband was all, "YUM!"

I made this recipe last night and followed the instructions exactly, except used a 7-qt slow cooker and added a tad bit more water.  I also cooked it on high the first two hours, then switched to low for five hours.  The results were fantastic!  I was cooking this meal for my husband and a few of his friends and they all agreed it was the best corned beef they have ever had.  They couldn't stop eating it and they were so full by the end that they could barely move.  I guess that is a good sign...

This recipe was, exactly as stated, very no-fuss and very good. Out of necessity, I did alter the recipe slightly. In place of the cider vinegar I used red wine vinegar, since that is what I had on hand. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 tsp-just couldn't bring myself to add that much sugar. And due to lack of space in the crockpot, I had to make the potatoes on the side. Also, I added additional water - enough to cover the brisket. Cooked on high for 6 hours this was nicely done.

this is good, but if you hold off on adding the cabbage until the last half hour or so and use canned new potatoes it can be great!

First of all, I have never cooked corned beef and cabbage before trying this recipe.  It was fantastic with the following considrations:  There is no way all of the ingredients will fit into a 5 quart slow cooker unless you have a sledge hammer.  I ended up cooking half the carrots and potatoes seperately.  Since we like spicy foods, I added red pepper and extra black pepper.  With extra cooking volume, it ended up great and will do it many time in the future.

Very simple to prepare, and the time was correct, the meat was perfectly done, and very tender! I've never added vinegar and sugar to a corned beef recipe before, but followed the recipe exactly. I didn't care for the slightly "tangy" taste it gave the vegetables. I'll make again, but omit the vinegar and sugar.

Very easy and the results were delicious. For me, cooking corned beef in the crock pot does require the addition of the additional spices, garlic, vinegar, etc. as well as the spice packet that comes with the brisket. Just seemed to need the extra flavoring for all those hours of slow cooking. My crock pot wasn't big enough to hold everything, so I just added the carrots with the meat. I cooked the potatoes and cabbage before the meal. Family loved it... thanks Karen!

I read all of these comments and I really don't understand how anyone could say this recipe isn't awesome. It has to be the cut of meat. Ours turned out amazing. It was sooo tender and tasty. I followed the recipe and put the veggies in first. I also added a can of Guinness. The only vinegar I had was rice vinegar so I used that. I also doubled the garlic because we are huge garlic fans. Other than that I did this recipe and WILL do it again. I do have a 6  1/2 qt. crock pot.. I can't imagine using a smaller one...  I put everything including the cabbage in the beginning. The cabbage had a wonderful flavor even if it was really tender.

My husband is Polish and he likes his food with a lot of flavour.  As corned beef can sometimes be a bit bland if it isn't spiced well I modified this version.  I cut the brisket in half and placed it in the bottom of the preheated (on high) slow cooker fat side up.  I then boiled the kettle and added enough water to come just to the top of the brisket.  To this mixture I added: 1/4 cup of malt vinegar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 3 tablespoons minced garlic (from the jar is fine), 1 tablespoon of peppercorns, 1/2 tablespoon of whole cloves, 1/2 tablespoon of mustard seed and 2 bay leaves.  Stir well and add your vegetables.  Turn slow cooker to low.  I also added half a leek, and some swede (turnip) to the veggie mixture. I didn't have baby carrots so I chopped four regular carrots into large pieces.  I will also add the cabbage one hour before I serve the corned beef. That way it will be cooked but still retain some crispness.  Cheers and happy cooking :)

This was good!  I just altered a little by following the advice of others and adding 2 cups of water and replacing the last cup of water with beer.  A whole bottle of beer!  cooked for 5 hours.  My crockpot cooks hot so I had it set for 10 hours on what is supposed to be low and it was done in 5.  I put the carrots and onion in at the start and added the potatoes at about the 4 hour point.  I added the cabbage at about the 4 1/2 hour point and ended up shutting the crockpot off at 5 hours and letting it sit for another hour or so until we got back from church.  Nothing was overly soggy and it tasted good.

Made this dish for work and got lots of compliments.  I waited until the last hour to add the cabbage as others had suggested.  The vinegar, sugar, and other spices compliment the dish very well.  Others at work have had this dish many times and liked this the most compared to the usual (bland) dish of only including the spice packet.  The corned beef cooked for about 4 hours with the carrots and potatoes, then I added the cabbage in for the last 45 mins to an hour.  Everything was cooked as it should.  I made this dish again last week, only adding brown sugar in place of regular sugar and a pint of Guiness to add to the broth.  Turned out VERY good.

I used this as a base for cooking my corned beef.  I used the entire spice pkg instead of using the bay leaf/sugar/vinegar.  Came out good.  Cooked in slow-cooker for 6 hours on low.

This recipe was pretty good, although I did alter it a little due to other people's suggestions. I ended up putting the beef on the bottom because when I put it on top, it wasn't even touching the water. I didn't want to add too much water so I pulled all the vegetables out, put the beef on the bottom, then put everything else back in with the cabbage on top. I would personally add another potato next time. Four, just didn't seem like quite enough. I would also get a larger beef brisket with a little less fat on it. I cooked this for only my husband and I, we had two slices of meat each (about 3/4-1 inch thick) and there are only two slices left. So this recipe would really only feed about 3 people. I only used about 1/2-3/4 small head of cabbage, one large onion because I love onions, and about 3-1/2 cups of water. I also cooked it on high for 6 hours with the cabbage in the whole time and it turned out great!

This recipe is fantastic! I added 1 bottle of beer to the 3 cups of water, and still added a bit more water to cover the corned beef. As others did, I put the beef at the bottom of the crock pot and added the cabbage only in the last 3 hours of cooking.   Everything came out perfect!  The potatoes and carrots were NOT over-cooked and the cabbage was just right. My boyfriend and I raved about the flavor and texture of the meat and veggies through the whole meal... not something we do every day!!! AWESOME and super simple recipe.  I will make this again for sure!

Just made this tonight for dinner and it was a total hit! Ommitted the sugar and vinegar, because I had made italian beef with vinegar before and didn't like the bitter vinegar taste. Also, I put the corned beef in first(added enough water to cover meat) seasonings, carrots, potatoes, onions, and cabbage in last so the cabbage was actually steamed. Cooked for 10 hours! My boyfriend said it was the best he ever had. Will definately use this recipe from now on!

It tasted just as corned beef & cabbage should to me. The husband wanted more vingar taste. What is "the seasoning packet"? The vegetables were very good. Crock pot would not fully close with all the raw contents. Once stuff cooked down it did, but was full! Usually cooking times are adjusted for us with crock pot use so the meat isn't super dry. This needed the full 8 hrs on low.

This will become a regular on St. Patrick's Day at our house.  I put the beef on the bottom, and covered the meat with the liquid mixture/water.

The only thing I changed in this recipe was that I didn't have cider vinegar on hand, so I used balsamic. I will never make corned beef and cabbage any other way from now on! Thanks for sharing Karen!

Delicious recipe. I took the advice from other reviewers and used apple juice and beer instead of the water. Turned out wonderful! Perfect St. Patty's day meal, my Fiance and kids loved this.

I've been making corned beef and cabbage on the stovetop for years, but for some reason never tried it in the crockpot.  Then I tried this recipe, and had an a-ha moment!  Of course the corned beef is going to be more moist and flavorful if slow cooked, duh!  I actually didn't have a spice packet in the corned beef I bought, so I used 2 TBS. McKormick pickling spice instead.  I also doubled the water so the corned beef was covered with liquid while cooking.  Other than that I followed the recipe, and it turned out great.  My only complaint was that the vegetables didn't have quite enough flavor, so I might add some kosher salt to the water next time.

The idea of cooking the corned beef in the slow cooker is a good one, and I liked the combination of cider vinegar and sugar as a base for the cabbage, but the end result was bland bland bland (except the meat which I bought pre-marinated).   I didn't care for the carrots.

I ended up taking some of the liquid, adding more cider vinegar S&P, boiling it and stewing the cabbage for 10 more minutes to give it some flavor. 

Next time I'll just cook potatoes and corned beef in the slow cooker and make cabbage separately.

We use a few more onions and follow the rest of the recipe as written.  It can be difficult to get all ingredients in the crockpot.  Cooking in the slow cooker makes the most amazing cabbage.

Not enough room in a regular crock pot.  I have a huge one...so it worked well.  Instead of water, I use equal amounts of beer (better quality, better flavor) and vegetable broth.  I leave out the vinegar and sugar.  The vinegar will act as a tenderizer for this tough cut of meat if you choose to use it....especially if you use the less fattier Flat Cut.  I find I do not need it when there is enough liquid to cover (add more as it cooks if needed)  and a long enough slow cook time.  I DO serve Malt Vinegar at the table...nothing like boiled/ cooked cabbage topped with butter, vinegar and juices from the pot :-) .  My DH is Boston Irish...always have to have the beer and spices in the pot...no matter which method you choose to cook it.  Don't forget to drink some of that beer as you put it in the pot...makes cooking it so much more FUN LOL!

A really good corned beef!  I used my crockpot and cooked it all day!  I made sure I had enough water to cover the corned beef.  I alsodidn't add cabbage because noone in my family eats it.  A really good dinner!

Very easy to follow recipe. Used a slow cooker and cooked it over a 6 hour time period. The corned beef was perfect as well as the vegetables. I love to take some of the left overs and use them for breakfast with a couple of fresh eggs.

The best corned beef I have ever had!  I use a can of Guiness as part of the liquid which really brings out the flavor of the meat.  Easy to start in the morning before leaving for work.  You come home to a delicious meal ready and witing!

This was a good recipe. Like most others, I cooked the meat at the bottom of the crock pot. I used a 7 qt crock pot and it was full to the brim so not sure how the 5 qt would have worked. I used red wine vinegar instead of the cider vinegar. I used redskinned quartered potatoes and didn't bother peeling them. Other than that, I followed the ingredients exactly.

I omitted the vinegar and sugar on the basis of the reviews here. It turned out wonderfully. The meat was so tender and and juicy but after putting in the veggies and the roast I found there was NO room for the cabbage. I cooked it separately in the juices leftover in the crockpot after the meat was done.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I used apple cider instead of water...ubby said that he when u normally eat this dish, the cabbage is just ok, but he said that the cabbage had so much flavor that he looked forward to getting a chunk of cabbage!

Great recipe to start with. Made this for dinner w/friends who had never had corned beef before. I know a lot of the reviews say they put the meat on the bottom, but I didn't. I sprayed my crockpot (as always). Then I substituted small red potatoes cut in half or quarters on the bottom. Bag o' baby carrots worked perfect! I liked the vinegar/sugar combo. But way too much water! I'm making it again this weekend and taking out at least 1 cup, and maybe adding a dark beer (sounds good from the other reviews!) Total 2 cups liquid max. Everything was cooked perfectly and the flavor was terrific! I was a little worried about fitting everything...my cabbage didn't totally fit until some of the veggies cooked down, but it came out the way I like it. I also like the idea of adding garlic. :)

Delicious and Easy!
I brought this to my book club and it got rave reviews.  I had never made Corned Beef and Cabbage before, but I wanted to give it a try for St. Patrick's Day.  I was asked to share the recipe because it was so good.  I agree with a previous reviewer who said it was hard to fit all of the ingredients into the crock pot.  I found that I needed to cut the amount of veggies in half.  I highly recommend the recipe.

I don't know why we limit corned beef and cabbage to once a year when it's so delicious!  I prepped everything the night before, threw it in the crockpot in the morning and came home to the wonderful aroma of St. Patrick's Day dinner.  I put the corned beef on a rack in my roasting pan, glazed with a mixture of honey, mustard and brown sugar and then finished in the oven at 350 for about 25 minutes.  Delicious!  And the leftover corned beef made awesome corned beef hash.

Very yummy. Only 4 stars because I like my cabbage and carrots to retain their form. With veggies cooking 8 hours they are like soup. I cooked the meat 1st and then added the veggies for the last 1.5 hours. The cabbage was still a little too soggy but the carrots were perfect. I was cooking for a crowd so I baked the potatoes separately. I seared my meat before cooking which helps to lock in the moisture. I also cut back on the sugar and vinegar and used 1/2 water and 1/2 apple juice and made sure the meat stayed covered. Great flavors.

Fantastic recipe, i sub beef broth for water and either take the brisket out and bake for last 1/2-1hr of cooking at 300-350. Meantime i add the cabbage and its done by the time the brisket has cooled. If i don't feel like popping it in the over i will cook the cabbage on the stove in drippings from the slow cooker or just wrap foil on meat set aside while the cabbage cooks for 45min to an hr in the slow cooker then slice and return brisket to cooker to soak up more juices while serving :)

I thought I was going to love this recipe. I didn't, because the garlic and bay leaf over powered the potatoes and cabbage. I should have stuck to my tried and true chicken bullion.

is good for this dis...HOWEVER. my cabbage and carrotts (stringbeans i added) were done in 4 hours. So i took out and then put roast back with some more cabbage and veggies Icouldnt fit in the first time. Would  be too mushy if you left it alone for 8-10 hours.

This was my 2nd time making this meal. Originally followed recipe. Not bad BUT not 100% to our liking.  So this time I did it a little different with EXCELLENT results.  I used red wine vinegar (instead of the cider vinegar), NO cabbage, and fully submerged the corned beef in water. What a difference. This in the words of my wife was "AWESOME" We loved it!

This is the best recipe I have found for brisket. Simple and delicious. I think the trick to getting your brisket to be melt in your mouth tender is to keep the slow cooker lid on. No peeking..I let this cook for 8 hours on low.

The flavor was very enjoyable. Based upon others' concerns, I went ahead and doubled the broth mixture. Make sure everything is submerged in the liquid, or it won't cook.

this recipe was great - came out moist and tender and very tasty.  I also ran out of room and ended up cooking the second half of the cabbage later on.

Outstanding!!! Never made Corn Beef and Cabbage in a Slow cooker before. The flavors were wonderful and the Corn beef was soooo tender.    My husband said it was the Best I ever made.  He said he was full but wanted more.  That is the best compliment.    I followed Karen's instructions completely with one exception.  I replaced one of the cups of water with a can of "Campbells" French Onion Soup.  This one's a keeper!!

This was Delicious, followed the recipe exactly as written, I didn't have baby carrots so I chopped four or five regular carrots into large pieces.  Three cups of water was too much for the piece of CB that I had, I should have cut it back to atleast 2 cups.  Also, I should have browned the meat first before putting it in the slow cooker, so after the CB was done, I put it in a dish and stuck it in the oven so it could brown.   Will make this again, thanks for sharing!!

First corned beef and cabbage.  Easy to make.  Tastes great.  Did not have enough room in my crock pot for a lot of cabbage.  Followed the recipe.  The only thing I did different was adding apple juice instead of water.  I think it enhanced the taste.

Just tried this recipe and it was delicious! We only had 1.4 pounds of corned beef and it really wasn't enough, so we added fried ground turkey and mmm! I'd highly recommend making it the correct way though. :) Heh!

Very good corned beef and cabbage!  I doubled the liquid portion so that the brisket, potatoes, and carrots would be covered.  I also waited until the last hour to add the cabbage, but should have added it a bit sooner because it was still crunchy when we ate dinner.  I thought the flavor was great but my guests asked for ketchup and more cider vinegar...so maybe something was lacking.  Regardless, I will make this again for my family.

Very good, next time I would add more water so that the cabage was also in the water because the cabage got pretty shriveled.  Also cooking for 12 hours was too long in my opinion, the vegetables were completely falling apart just scooping them on the plate.  This recipe is a very easy recipe and my family enjoyed it.

I've been missing the corned beef and cabbage I used to eat when I lived back home in Chicago.  I'd never made it before, but I found this recipe and decided to make it to bring to my team at work for St Patrick's Day.  It was a huge hit...and made me miss Chicago a little less...:-)

This is pretty much what I have done in the past, except I have never added vinegar or sugar. It was excellent. I have a 6-qt cooker so I did not need to cut the corned beef in half. My cooker also cooks fast so I had to turn off for about an hour after 4 hours of cooking. I cooked the meat on top of the veggies and it came out very tender. Thank you for this recipe!

This is the best St Patty's day recipe ever!! I had thrown a nice littel Dinner party and everyone ate this up, while going on and on about how it was the best corned beef meal they had ever eaten.. I think a lot if it had to do with the apple cider vinegar. Thanks so much for this superb recipe.. I will be using it every year now!

Although this was a tasty recipe, I was disappointed. All the corned beef that I have bought has come with a season packet that I boil with the beef for about 4 hours. This tasted exactly the same as what I always make, only 3 times more work. I'll be boiling it like normal from now on.

Was nice and simple, but I'd omit the onion next time, add more pickling spice, and boil the cabbage separately.

This was very tasty, and oh, so easy to make.  Our only concern: I put the vegies (except onion and cabbage) in at 4 hours, and they were way too mushy for us; I can't imagine what they would have been like if I had put them in at the beginning.  I added the cabbage (sliced in about 3/4 inch wide slices) about 30 minutes before we ate, and it was perfectly done with just a teensy bit of "tooth".  Thanks for a good starting point!

The finished product was good. I like the vinegar and sugar, it gave a nice flavor. I did however, have to make a few changes. Their seems to be mixed reviews reguarding the cooking time for the veggies. I attempted to put everthing in the pot at the begining, but had no room for the cabbage, so left it out. Cooked on high for 2 hrs then turned it to low. My potatoes (whole baby reds) and carrots were done in 3 1/2 hrs, so I removed them. I turned it to high again and let the brisket cook for aprox 2 1/2 hrs, untill fork tender and added the cabbage. I let that cook aprox 1hr, removed the brisket, then added potatoes and carrots to warm them back up. I put a glaze of brown sugar , mustard and ground cloves over the brisket and popped it under the broiler while the veggies were finishing up. It turned out very good. and was fairly simple, but next time I will add the potatoes and carrots during the last 3 hrs or so and the cabbage in the last hr. Starting out on high will reduce your total cooking time by several hrs. Mine was done in 7 hrs.

I have made corned beef and cabbage for years by stove top method. This recipe was so much easier and made the best tasting corned beef ever! It was moist and fork tender. No more boiling the corned beef, from now on I use the slow cooker. I did follow the recipe exactly. The one thing I did have a problem with was the capacity. I used a 7 qt slow cooker and still ran out of room.

This was a good recipe.  I followed almost exactly but did not have garlic (left it out) and only had red wine vinegar so used that instead.  As other reviewer's suggested, I put the beef brisket on the bottom then covered with the water and vegetables.  Cooked on high for 2 hours then on low for about another 5.  The meat came out very tender and the potatos were wonderful - great flavor.    I'm not a huge fan of cabbage, but it was pretty good cooked this way, although I'd agree with other reviewers that you do not need to have the cabbage in the whole time.  Probably the last 3 hours would be more than plenty.   Cooking it the whole time made it just very wilted.  I would suggest adding a little more seasoning to taste, otherwise it does come out a bit bland - but it's really matter of personal taste.

I made this without any changes EXCEPT... all this will NOT fit in a 5 qt. slow cooker.  I put everything in except the cabbage.  After cooking all the other ingreadents, I removed the meat and some of the vegetables then put in the cabbage and cooked untill cabbage was tender... I think that probably worked out better because the cabbage would have been over cooked and mushy if it had cooked for eight or nine hours.  As it worked out, the cabbage was perfectly cooked after being in the cooker for an hour.... The finished product of this concoction was delecious.

By far the best Corned Beef I have ever had! Before this recipe I never liked corned beef. I like to prepare everything (minus the veggies) and marinate the corned beef in it over night.

I added a bottle of beer in place of the water, and omitted the vinegar and bay leaf because I didn't have any.  This cooked for about 10 hours on low and came out good.  The corned beef should go on the bottom of the crockpot with enough liquid to cover.  Also, not sure if you are supposed to, but I trimmed A LOT of fat off the brisket before it went into the crockpot...

This is a great recipe! Very Yummy! I thought the pepper was too much so I used a little less. I also cooked it in the oven at 250F instead of the slow cooker.

I have been cooking for years but have never tried Corned Beef before.  This year for St. Patrick's Day, the family wanted to try it.  This was a fantastic recipe for brisket that just fell apart when done.  Great taste, super easy to prepare.

Best corned beef I've made yet! I improvised a little with what I already had on hand: used dried minced garlic, no vinegar, and used a corned beef round instead of brisket since it's leaner. I too put the beef in the bottom of the crockpot first and mixed the water with dry stuff before pouring it over; added a little more water to cover. Waited a few hours before adding the veggies, last added the cabbage. Everyone loved it and it was gone in minutes!!! I was told I should make it more often than just on St. Patrick's Day.

I have tried different recipes.  This is by far the most fantastic recipe I have ever tried.  This will be my recipe for life.  I did have to increase the amounts a tad bit because I had a 4 pound corned beef instead of a 3.  Amazing recipe.  I have been handing it out left and right to those who were present to eat it.  I will be making it again in a couple of weeks for the other side of my family.  They're excited....and so am I.  I get to make and eat it again.  It is so simple!

I made a few changes to this recipe but it turned out delicious!  Omitted the potatoes, carrots and cabbage but used the recommended seasonings to cook the corned beef.  Also added 1 stalk of celery for flavoring and used entire spice package.  Cooked in a crock pot on high for 5 hours and it was perfect!  This will be my new recipe for preparing corned beef!

Excellent! I used a 4 lb corned beef brisket, tasted great didnt realize how fatty it was though, it fed 5-6 people. Flavors were great. I put the corned beef off bottom and cut in half. Used more liquid mixture to cover meat completely in crock pot and still just used the 1 packet of seasoniNgs that comes with the meat. I didnt have red potatoes so i used medium russet potatoes cubed. Next time i think i will cut in half though they were mushy. Cabbage was perfect, just cut in fourths and placed on top directly under lid. Great recipe for flavors just needs a little tweaking.

I've always liked corned beef and cabbage, but the addition of cider vinegar and sugar made this a little more special.  I will make it this way from now on.

SO disappointed with this.  Followed recipe with the exception of skipping the cabbage (wouldn't fit in the cooker).  Meat was bland and flavorless, carrots inexplicably turned brown, and the potatoes were overly vinegary.  Perhaps the roast just wasn't a good one, but that doesn't account for the flavor.

Found this to be a little bland.  Didn't think the vegetables had great flavor and my guests actually asked for salt and pepper.  I followed the recipe to the letter.

Very delicious! I used a bottle of Guinness as a substitute for half of the water, and it was outstanding! I like how this recipe has you put the cabbage on top of everything so it won't wilt. I tried a different slow cooker corned beef recipe last year that had you put the cabbage in with all the other veggies, and it was gross.

I made this for a crowd at my sister's on St. Patty's Day.  It was a huge hit.  Made one in a crockpot and one in the oven.  Oven turned out better but crockpot may not have been working right.  The flavors melded together beautifully.  I will never make corned beef any other way.  Works great the next day as a soup.  I'm making a third one tonight for my family since they weren't happy that the leftover stayed at my sisters.

I'm from an Irish family and grew up on this dish.  This is by far the best corned beef and cabbage I have ever tasted.  After tasting, you won't want to save this recipe just for March 17th!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great!  No need to improvise or add anything funky as this recipe is already super solid.  I served this to my Irish in-laws and they loved it! 

Use the Reynolds Slow Cooker liners... you won't regret it! :)

Overall The Corned Beef was Moist & Great But Not Pleased with how Soft & Mushy the Cabbage was. I Think Next Time I will add The Cabbage the Last Hour of Cooking.

I gave this 4 stars because I did not stick to the recipe exactly.  I did not use potatoes and I added a beef bullion cube to the water.  My family has never eaten corned beef before (except for deli meat) so I didn't want to overwhelm them.  I served with brown mustard and enjoyed this very much.  I will definitely make this again.

This was okay. The beef fell apart alittle too much for me. Maybe cutting down the cooking time would help.

There are two cuts of CB you can usually buy, the point cut (VERY fatty, and cheaper) and the flat cut.  I've made the point cut the past two years, and will go with the flat cut next time.  I thought this recipe was a bit too sweet, and would cut back the sugar to 1 TBsp. and add 1 tsp. of salt instead.  Also, too much water (at least for my slow cooker), will cut back to 2 or less cups of water.  I also browned the meat first, which adds great flavor.  Otherwise, really good.  Also made up sour cream and horseradish sauce to serve on the side with the corned beef.  Just mix the two to taste, and drizzle or dip.  Awesome!

The Corned Beef by itself rates 5 stars, for sure - my first time making at home, and it was so tender, juicy and flavorful (I also put it at the bottom of the crockpot).  The veggies... they were dead after 9 hours.  Next year, I'll add the veggies at the halfway point or make them separately.

Awesome!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and put the meat on the bottom, followed by hard veggies, water mixture (made sure there was enough to cover) and cabbage.  I resisted the urge to stir it all together...  It turned out wonderful!  I've never eaten corned beef before, but my parents thought it was great and it'll take some really good corned beef to meet my new standard!

Very good.  Had friends over and they raved over this one. Served with some horseradish and what a great meal.  I also took some extra cabbage and fried it.  I served both types of cabbage with the meal and there were no left overs. Excellent!

Very good recipe. I followed the recipe, but with one exception, I put in the cabbage the last 30 minutes of cooking, as suggested by one reviewers. Everything came out done to perfection. I will difenately use this recipe again.

I was in a mad rush, so didn't have time to put the veggies in...just cooked the Boyle's corned beef per recipe.   The meat MELTED in our mouths...just unbelievable.  I've never experienced meat that tender!  This one is a KEEPER!  I'm making Reubens tonight with the leftovers!

Okay, so I know I shouldn't change a recipe and then review it, but I was looking in this case for instructions on how to do corned beef in the slow cooker. This was GREAT! I had a 4 pound brisket, and I filled the slow cooker as full as it would go with onions, carrots, and potatoes (we don't do cabbage). I sprinkled the spice packet, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic over everything, added the bay leaf, and added the water. I set the cooker to 10 hours on low (since I had scaled up the recipe) and when I came home everything was PERFECT. My friends really liked it and this was by far the best and easiest corned beef I have ever made. Woo! =D

This was very good and so easy to fix.  I added some apple juice to it and put the vegies (except cabbage) on bottom per the other suggestions.  I will definitely fix this every St. Patty's day...I never fix Corned Beef and Cabbage any other way now!

Really good. I was nervous about the vinegar & sugar- but not tangy at all. It actually came out perfect. I think it had more flavor than if you just boil in water without the vinegar & sugar or slow cook in plain water, even with additional spices.

My husband stated this corned beef was the first he's ever had that was not too salty! Also he stated the cabbage had a very nice flavor, and usually it's just bland. I cooked the cabbage that wouldn't fit in the crock pot in apple juice and water in a saucepan with some of the corned beef about an hour before supper.  I also followed other reader's advice and put the roast on the BOTTOM. Delish.

A taste of the old country! Just like my Polish grandmother never used to make. :) We prepared everything the night before (cut up the veggies, etc) and then just assembled it in the crock in the morning. Like other reviewers, I put the corned beef in the bottom of the crock (it was already seasoned in the package when I bought it, which was nice - the beef is already marinating in the spices to impart some flavor!) Added water mixture plus some extra water to cover the beef, added veggies, and then just a bit more water to ensure the beef was covered. On low for 9 hours (cold from the fridge), and then left it warming for 2 more hours until we were ready to eat! Perfectly done. Delish.

the cabbage was horrible.  the only part that was edible was the beef, and that was impossible to slice.  I would never cook all of these ingredients in a slow cooker again.  it might be okay if only the corned beef was in the slow cooker, and the vegetables were cooked separately.

I have made corned beef for years.  But I tried this one and wow!  It's just the combination of spices and flavors that makes this one just a step above.  Amazing! This is the best.

DH and I thought this was the most flavorful and most tender corned beef that either one of us had ever had. I put in more than 3 cups water to make sure that the entire piece of beef was covered. Thank you!!!!!

Hubby is a corned beef snob and loved this! Says it's by far the best recipe I've used. I don't even bother with potatoes- 'cuz when the meat's this good, they just take up space! I have modified this in a large roaster (I use my huge pozole pot) in the oven when we have this for guests. Just as good, but you have to be home to watch it.

This recipe was delicious.  I have made corned beef many times, and was a little suspicious about the sugar and vinegar, but I think this was the best corned beef I have ever made.  I have been using a slow cooker for the last two years to make corned beef and it really works out well.  I did cook my potatoes separately, just because I like them better that way.  Also, I added the cabbage only for the last hour because I don't like my cabbage too soft.  But the meat was perfect and I did not add any extra water and did not have to turn it. The juice that cooks out of the meat itself and the 3 cups of water was plenty to cover it after a few hours of cooking. My daughter, who has never been fond of corned beef, keeps cutting slices to munch on and is raving about how good it is!

I made this recipe for my first St. Patrick's day feast and  it was a huge hit! It was so easy and the meat came out really tasty and tender. I didn't include the carrots or potatoes (made colcannon as a side dish instead). I'm definitely going to use this in the future!

None liked the sweet and sour taste from the vinegar and sugar so we won't be try this again.  Had much more success with the Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Santwich on this sight so that will be our standard recipe.

This is the 1st time I've ever had corned beef and cabbage and this recipe was wonderful. I did make 1 slight change on the recommendation of a friend. I substituted the water vinegar mixture for chicken broth, and the bulb of garlic I had was small, so I used the whole thing. Will for sure make this again.

This was difficult.  Some of it is my fault for not liking my corned beef and cabbage this way, but it is also just not good cooking.

1st: 8-9 hours is way too long to slow-cook the veggies in this dish--as I learned, too late.  Everything was MUSH. The meat was like eating delicate rubber.  No texture or firmness left to it at all.  Forget using leftovers for sandwiches.  I would recommend going with the top rated recipe on this site which recommends 50 min. per pound of meat.  Also, don't add the cabbage until the last hour or it will be like slimy strings. 
Second, every picture I see of corned beef and cabbage on this site shows it being served on a plate with no cooking broth.  Well, that's probably more traditional, but it's not how I grew up eating it.  I loved the broth.  And if you know anything about nutrition, you'll realize that it's where all the nutrients go that you are cooking out of your vegetables.  If you are going to be wasteful and dump the broth, this method is fine.  If you want to keep it as a healthy soup, it will turn out tasting like the brine the corned beef is packaged in.  At the very least, it should be thoroughly rinsed or soaked in cold water before adding to the pot.  At best, you could even pre-boil some of the brine off the meat, discard the water and then add the less nitrate-filled beef to your pot.  This is what I learned from my mom, who I should have just called and asked in the first place. At least I know what NOT to do.

Never tried corned beef and cabbage before - tasted great. Read reviews and tried the apple juice instead of water and added the cabbage halfway thru.  Thought I could SQUEEZE it all in the crockpot,  but... when the wife got home from work it had started to overflow! Messy cleanup - next time saving 1/2 of potatoes and carrots to do on the side.

Made this for St. Patrick's Day for the first time.  I followed the recipe and it was a huge hit!!  The only change I made was putting half the cabbage in at the start of cooking and the rest about an hour before done.  Both were good!  Will make again and absoluteley loved it!

WOWZA! First of all, I have never made corned beef and cabbage or used a slow cooker for more than a few hours.  So, this is just the easiest recipe and it couldn't have turned out better.  I used regular carrots (not an issue) and added parsnips! I originally made this recipe for St. Patrick's Day, but its going to be a regular in my repertoire!

This was the worst, So happy it wasn't for company. I have been cooking for many years and had a flop or two but I didn't even see this one coming. The corned beef was ok but what a waste all the veggies were mush the cabbage was purple, it was green when I added it. I even read the reviews. Didn't think that many people could be wrong. They made me rate this or I couldn't post really I would rate no stares.

This was the absolute best corned beef I have ever made. Usually my corned beef is dry, chewy and tasteless. So I decided after reading all the reviews to try this recipe. I made a few changes as all cooks do, I used 2 cups of hot water and 2 teaspoons of Better than beef bouillon, for the 3rd cup of liquid I used a 7 oz bottle of Goya malt beverage. I mixed the onion, liquid garlic, sugar vinegar, pepper, a dash of gourmet salt and bay leaf and poured it in the crock pot, then I put my flat cut corned beef in and cooked it on low for 4 hours, I then added my carrots, potatoes and cabbage and cooked it an additional 7 hours on low. It came out perfect and I will be using this recipe again soon.

I followed the recipe exactly except I made sure the meat was completely covered by water and I cooked it for 10 hours.  The meat was very good and tender.  However, I agree with another reviewer that I didn't care for the taste that the vinegar gave to the vegetables. Also after 10 hours of cooking, the vegetables (carrots and potatoes) were undercooked. If I make this again, I will do the vegetables separately.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe!  I have NEVER liked corned beef much, but this was fabulous.  I will never make it any other way from now on.  The crockpot was a PERFECT way to cook this dinner.

I used a 7 quart crockpot because I had 2 pieces of corned beef totaling 5.5 pounds.  For the cooking liquid, I doubled all the ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.  And like others said, I put the meat on the bottom and the vegetables on top to ensure that all the meat was immersed in the water.  I didn't have room for the cabbage, so I cooked that separately. I loved the flavor of the potatoes and carrots...the extra kick that the vinegar/sugar gave to the brine was just delicious.  Dinner was a huge hit today!

Ever since I came across this recipe 4 years ago, I've never looked for another! It's a family favorite that we use on St. Pat's and again mid-year... Terrific every single time!

I'm rating it a four because I didn't do the sugar, vinegar  and bay leaf...which is probably what makes this different from all the other corned beef recipes.  And I also didn't add the cabbage.

Made in the crock pot with only the onion for the vegetable (I make the cabbage/potatoes differently). Turned out great. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this for St. Paddy's this year, and it was quite good. The corned beef turned out very well. The veggies, especially the cabbage were a bit soft for my taste, so I think I'll add them the last hour. The cabbage was not pretty and was too soft, so I may cook that on the side next time.
All in all, easy and delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

Before this last St. Patrick's Day, I had never tried corned beef & cabbage, much less made it myself! Now that I have tried it, I wonder why people only make it on St. Patrick's Day. It's delicious! And this recipe made it so easy. I cooked dinner for my parents and my in-laws and everyone loved it. I served it with Irresistible Irish Soda Bread, also from allrecipes. I will most definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing!

Amazing taste.  I've made this the past few years - always delicious.  Yes, you do need a a big slow cooker.  It is hard to fit everything in, but what a wonderful taste.  Well worth buying that bigger slow cooker.  Definately a St. Patrick's Day treat.

Good taste.  I purchased the smallest brisket I could find.  I left out the cabbage until the brisket had cooked 5 hours.  I also used two cups of water and a  substituted a bottle of beer for the third cup.  The family seemed pretty pleased.

Awesome recipe. I definately need to buy a bigger crock pot. I could only use half the potatoes and had to leave out the cabbage. I will use again. It was so delicious that my mom ate all on her plate and had to sopp up the juice with a piece of bread. She didn't want to waste any.

This is my favorite way to cook corned beef now.  I've made it twice since St. Patrick's Day.  My crockpot isn't quite as big so I can't fit everything into it.  I left out the cabbage, since it only got very greasy from floating on top the first time I made it.  If we want to eat cabbage with it in the future, I think I'll cook it separately on the stove.  Other than that, great recipe!  Falling apart tender corned beef, the leftovers are perfect for hash!

I had never had Corned beef as a kid since my mother can't stand it and hates the smell of cabbage. I LOVE the dish when I can find a good Irish restaurant to have it at and this recipe was amazing! I don't change a thing and even bought a larger slow cooker to cram it all in! I hate cooked carrots but still add it since others like them and they do add a lot to the flavor. I normally won't eat onion any bigger than minced but I was chowing down on the onion wedges because they were so tender and had so much flavor. This is something we have added to our monthly menu and it's always a hit with my partner who normally hates leftovers, fighting me for what's left!

I did make this on st. Pat's this year and the boiled one, because, as other people have mentioned, it would not all fit into the crockpot! And I do have the 5 1/2 quart size! It was good, but not as tender as the boiled recipe.

Very good, but since I was making Diana's Colcannon with half of my cabbage,, I omitted the potatoes, and as someone suggested, added the half head of cabbage during last 1 1/2 hours and it was cooked. Very easy recipe and tasty. Started late in day, so cooked on High 3 hrs, then Low for 2.

the best corned beef I"ve ever had!!! I made this for this past St. Patty's day and it was my fist attempt ever using a crockpot..not only will I be4 using my crock pot more, but this is now a regular meal for us! I"m going to make some specifically for sandwiches, my boyfriend and our roomates (all boys) LOVED IT! Said it was the best they have ever had! only used 1.5 tablespoons of cider vinegar just because other reviews said it may be a bit vinegary and it was great!Also don't add the the cabbage after the beef was done I browned the cabbage in a pan with butter as some had suggested then added some broth from the slow cooker from making the beef and covered and let sit til I deemed it ready I like it not mushy and the boys loved it! And I got them to eat the greens! lol best recipe ever! Even my mom was highly impressed hers is of course traditional for our family but next year she may do it my new way!!!! Thanks so much for a fantastic recipe!!!

This was a great and easy Corned Beef and Cabbage!!  I used an oval 6 quart slow cooker, which seemed to accomodate all the ingredients than a standard round one might.  I had to add a little more water to cover, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I was worried the potatoes might be mushy being covered in water the whole time, but they turned out perfect, like everything else!  The meat was very tender and cut easily with a butter knife.  Highly recommend!

I followed the recipe exactly except that I put the beef on the bottom of the crock pot.  I found it to be quite bland, and the veggies were overdone.  I will significantly change this one if I make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have a bay leaf. I would have to say this is the best corned beef and cabbage I've ever had. It's also good with a spicy brown mustard. Mmmmmm.

Great! The only change I made was to not put the carrots, cabbage and potatoes in the pot. I was afraid they would cook too much and be mushy. So, I just cooked them in a pot on the side with some of the broth from the crockpot. Also, I also had to use extra water (5 cups) to cover the meet. Got rave reviews!!!

Fabulous recipe and so easy!  I followed exactly as written except took the corned beef right out of freezer. Also added a bit of fresh parsley as I had it on hand.  Perfect.  Even with the meat being frozen, it was immensely tender after 9 hours on low in slow cooker.

I made this recipe exactly as printed and it was wonderful.  I only received my crock pot this Christmas so I am a novice it cooking with it.  In all other recipes, I have never put potatoes in for the entire time because I was afraid they would be mush.  I used whole baby white potatoes and they were perfectly done even after 8 hours.  Also, I could not fit the entire head of cabbage but cut half of it into quarters.  I used the other half to make coleslaw for grilled corned beef and swiss sandwiches the next day.

5 stars but I did make a few changes: I put the beef in, rubbed it with 2 T brown sugar instead of putting the white sugar in.  I topped with water and spices, using less vinegar, then the veggies (red potatoes instead of white) and finally the cabbage.

This turned out OK but the corned beef was kind of greasy.  I think I will sear the beef next time before putting it in the cooker and will probably use less liquids.

Super easy - great recipe!! Couple of changes.  As others said, I put the corned beef on the bottom of the crock pot.  I've made this a couple of times and found the brisket worked better than the round.  Make sure to add more water so that the brisket / round is completely covered.  I used baby red potatoes so that I didn't have to peel them; cut the potatoes in half.  Chopped the garlic in a mini food chopper vs mincing. Adds more flavor.  Used red wine vinegar every time I've made this. And, to make it less fatty or more diet friendly trim any visible fat off before placing in the crockpot (WW trick!). Don't forget to use the Reynolds crockpot bags for easier cleanup too!

Ok - in defense of the original recipe, I did leave out the sugar and vinegar -- so my version was a little more basic (and I cooked the cabbage separate as it wouldn't all fit in the crock pot) - but at best, this was "ok".  Meat was tender, but potatoes and carrots had a decidedly unpleasant taste, we threw them out after trying a bit of each.  In the end, I might use this again to cook *just* a corned beef roast, but I imagine there are better recipes out there and I'm going to continue looking for one that more suits our family's taste.  (Sorry!)

I made this for my husband on valentines day. Which is so fitting because I am not a fan of corned beef and generally dont even get to eat it. This recipe was awesome. I even liked it. I only had red wine vinegar but never the less it is so tender. I put the meat on the bottom. i ended with cabbage. The cabbage got steamed instead of boiled. AMAZING recipe thank you!

Very good and easy.  I think it could use a little bit more spice next time, but I'll definitely make it again.  The corned beef was so tender it was like eating pot roast.  Delicious!

Great recipe! I didn't have baby carrots or fresh garlic so I used minced garlic and some garlic powder and just made do with the rest. I also put the meat on the bottom instead and boiled the water separately before adding it to the slow cooker. But the recepe's definately a keeper. Thanks!

Love it!! I've never made corned beef before and this turned out so good!! I didn't have the vinegar on hand so I skipped that and the cabbage. Instead of just water I did one can of chicken broth and then added water until roast was covered. I had the veggies on the top and bottom. It was in the slow cooker for 8hrs. My husband likes it crispy so when he got home he put in the oven for about 40 mins on 350.
Everyone loved it and the kids asked for seconds-always a plus!

This was very good.  Seasoned well.  I took the advice of other reviewers and put the veggies on top of the meat and they still weren't tender after 9 hours.  The meat was perfect though.  I just boiled some water and threw the veggies in and cooked 'till done.  Very good and simple recipe.  Will make again but as recipe directs with the veggies on the bottom.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time making Corned Beef and Cabbage. I had to put the corned beef in the bottom of the crock pot for it to cook through and it turned out great.  Made my cabbage separately on the stovetop for fear it would be too soggy.  My husband loved it and requested I add it to the repeat list.

I actually had to convert this recipe to serve 10. (which I was little nervous about) I have a huge crock pot, but after I cut the two briskets up, I didn't have room for the cabbage and potatoes. I followed the ingredients (after the conversions) exactly and when the brisket was done, I took some of the liquid from the crock pot and did my cabbage on the stove.  My first time cooking corned beef---I didn't even really know what to expect!!  It was really good.  I expected out of 7 lbs. of corned beef that I would have some leftover, but there was none!!     
After everyone ate, they just sat at the table and picked at the platter as we talked.  I couldn't believe it was all gone!!  Who knew!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Yummy!!!  I never made corn beef before, but always loved eating it on St. Patty's Day...So this year I decided to make it.  My mom was skeptical of cooking corned beef and cabbage in a crock-pot; she was sure that the cabbage would turn out brown and mushy…She was pleasantly wrong, and could not stop praising the meal.

This recipe is great, especially if you have a busy schedule…I cut the veggies up the night before, and then threw everything in the pot this morning.  By the time I got home from work, dinner was ready (and there wasn’t any messy clean up).

A few alterations I made to the recipe:  Used regular carrots.  * Used red potatoes and left the skin on.  * I omitted the sugar & vinegar.

A+ to the author and creator of this recipe!

this was excellent, the changes I made was,I only put the meat  by it's self, cooked that for about 6 hours, then I added the cabbage and added ketchep. I squirted some over the cabbage. This was as good if not better than what my mom use to make. And that was over 40 years ago

I followed the directions exactly, with the exception of adding only a small amount of cabbage.  This was a big hit!  The flavor was absolutely delicious.  I cooked this on low for approximately 10-12 hours.  I will definitely make this again!

My family and I did not care for this at all.  We usually polish everything off but this time I had quite a bit of left overs (which I threw out).  My dad didn't even want to  attempt to make corned beef hash with the left over corned beef (gasp as he loves corned beef hash)!   The corned beef was bland and dry (weird since it was cooking in liquid); cabbage had a light brownish tint to it and was rather tasteless.  Best part of the meal was the carrots.  Won't be making this receipe again.  Will go back to doing it on the stovetop with my old receipe.  Thanks for sharing though.

This was easy and great! I have never made corned beeg before and this was a success! I didn't have a spice packet with my beef so I used italian seasoning it it worked fine. I also used peppercorns instead of pepper.

I don't usually eat corned beef and cabbage, but my husband wanted some, so I decided to try this recipe and we loved it!  I used red wine vinegar since that's what I had and forgot to add the pepper, but it was still great!  Thanks.

This was wonderful!  I used new red potatoes with skins and regular carrot sticks.  Definitely cover meat with liquid.  Also, we split into two crock pots to handle the space issue...WAY more roomy.  Keep in mind the meat shrinks A LOT!  I would've cooked more meat for my group...next time!  DEFinitely a keeper.  Also, no spice pack with my meat--probably a good thing--it wasn't salty like others I've made.

We liked the recipe. We added about a cup and a half extra of water to cover the meat and about 1/4t of ground mustard. I thought the meat wasn't as flavorful as it could have been but my husband disagreed and liked it a lot.

WOW!  The beef was so tender and perfect!  I added celery and used onion powder instead of onion and it was fabulous.  Can't go wrong with this one.

I used all the listed ingredients, except I used small red potatoes.  Placing the corned beef on TOP of the vegetables (except for the cabbage) ensured that everything was cooked perfectly.  I had too much raw cabbage to initially fit in the crock pot, so I cut it in half.  And, when everything was cooked, I removed everything but the liquid, placed the extra cut-up half cabbage into the crock pot containing the original liquid, and cooked it on low for 3 more hours.   My husband and I enjoyed it immensely!

Easy to make; followed the recipe exactly as written, and had a complete dinner ready at the end of the day, with very little effort.  Brought this to a potluck and there were several other corned beefs but this was the 1st one gone!  Will be making this again, for sure.

This will be my third year, possibly fourth making this - there is no better recipe for corned beef and cabbage.  I make the cabbage outside the pot, because it takes up too much room, but I scoop out some of the juice from the pot to boil the cabbage in; I just add like an extra half hour to make up for my letting out all the steam from the crock pot.

Best corned beef and cabbage I've made or tasted.  My in law's corned beef always was soooo dry every year, so I was nervous making my first one.  This was delicious, falling apart, and moist!  I've made this recipe now for the last 5 years.  Sometimes I have omitted the cabbage, just cause I don't like it - turns out just fine without.

I made this today for St. Patrick's Day.  It was the best ever.  The corned beef was perfect and all of the veggies were done.  I cooked it 6 hours on high and found the way it called to layer it made a difference.  The meat was tender but not falling apart which was perfect.  This is a keeper for next year.

We liked the flavor of this recipe though I think the vinegar could be cut in half. I used my large cooker and had no problem fitting everything in and should have put in more potatoes (used red potatoes and left skins on). I didn't want the cabbage to be too mushy, so I intended to put it in the last two hours of cooking...and then totally forgot and had to cook the cabbage in the microwave. All came out well enough and it was a great dinner. UPDATE: 3/15/14 I put all the root vegetables on the bottom and sides around the meat. I used 4 cups water, and it still did not cover the meat. So, I peeled a couple of leaves off the cabbage and laid them over the top of the meat to hold in moisture. Then the remaining cabbage was added 1 1/2 hours before the done time of 10 hours. The meat was fairly tender, but not quite as moist as I would like it to be. I'm deciding that corned beef just needs to be on the bottom.

This is my go-to Corned Beef recipe.  Easy and soooo tasty.  I omit the cabbage because I'm not a fan, but otherwise have always been true to the rest of the recipe.  This last attempt I added half baking potato and half sweet potato.  The sweet potato was AMAZING in it.  I think I'll just use sweet potato next time as the baking potato gets a little too acidic tasting for my preference.  I'm also thinking about pureeing the remaining vegetables in our leftovers tomorrow night and making a veggie/potato mash.  Yum!

Love this recipe.  I know some say you don't need the vinegar etc. but I like the added flavor it gives.  I also sub 1C water with 8 oz beer.  My daughter who is not a big fan of meat gobbles this up.  Thanks you for showing an Italian how to make something Irish!

So good!!!    I followed the recipe but added a bottle of beer, and added extra water, so liquid was covering meat and veggies.     Made for a great St. Pats meal 
Thank you will use for years to come.   :)

Happy to give my first review for this good and easy corned beef. As I see others have mentioned, I put my carrots and potatoes in during the last hour of cooking, and fried my cabbage instead. I will do this one again! Thanks Karen!

Tried as printed and it was the worst St. Patty's day dinner I have ever prepared.  My husband hated it and griped, griped, griped.  Carrots, cabbage and potatoes had a taste I didn't care for. Took away some of the natural flavor of the corned beef.

I've used this recipe several times. A few alterations, I use a 6-qt slow cooker with the corned beef on the bottom followed by onions, carrots and potatoes, then squeeze in as much of a head of cabbage as I can fit, adding the remaining cabbage after a few hours of cooking when it's had time to cook down a little bit. After the full 9 hours of cooking time the corned beef is flavorful and falling apart and the veggies  are tender and delicious. My family absolutely loves it and any leftovers (if there are any) have never gone to waste.

This was ok. I've had better though. Not tons of flavor and all the ingredients wouldn't fit in the crockpot so I had to cook the potatoes seperately, which was not a big deal.

Very easy, followed directions exactly.  I forgot to eat it with mustard, I think that's just what it needed.  It was just slightly bland from being in the cooker for 9 hours, so I added more pepper to my plate.    I would make this again.  Very tender meat!  I have never had corned beef like it!

I usually use the slow cooker for my corned beef recipe. I have never added the sugar and vinegar so I thought I would try it. My corned beef had really good flavor, but not sure if it was due to the sugar and vinegar. I usually have to cook meat the full time but I pull the vegetables out early because they get too mushy for me. I usually don't add the cabbage until the last couple of hours.

I made exactly as stated except I took other reviewers' suggestions and put the brisket on the bottom vs. the top of the vegetable. The meat turned out so moist and flavorful!

This was just okay. We loved the potatoes, carrots and cabbage (though I am glad I put them all in later or they would have been mush) and the flavor of them was excellent. The meat didn't have that much flavor - very mild - and was tender-ish but not tender enough for what I was hoping for... and I even cooked it on low for 7 hours and then on high for 2 more. It got more tender, but still not what I was looking for. I guess I'll keep looking....

Followed exactly.  The Corned beef itself was bland.  Carrots tasted good.  Needs some seasoning besides the pepper packet that comes with the meat.

I was not all that impressed, however, I gave it 3 starts b/c my hubby LOVED it!  I thought the veggies should have been cooked separately and the spice pack (cloves included) was WAY too overpowering.  I won't make it again.

I was looking for a way to cook the brisket for Reubens, so I didn't include any of the veggies. I followed the rest of the recipe and made sure that there was enough water added to keep the meat covered. Turned on the crock pot and went to bed! The next morning I awoke to the most tender and delicious corned beef. Perfectly done and couldn't be easier.

I am glad that I tried the recipe, but find that I prefer the boiling method over slow cooker.  Using the slow cooker dried out the cabbage and the texture of the meat was a bit rubbery.

I made this for the first time on St. Patrick's Day and it turned out great!  I went ahead and put the brisket in first then all the vegetables ending up w/the cabbage on top.  My hubby actually compared it to what his Irish Grandma used to make!  :)  Thanks for the recipe!

First off, I could not fit everything into the pot. The recipie is good, but its tooo sweet for my liking. Also I would try to add the cabbage a little later. Cooking it all day pretty much killed it.

I made this for my husband for St Patti's Day.  He absolutely loved it.  This is a great recipe.  The only change I made was I substituted part of the water with a 12 oz beer which helped to enrich the broth and tenderized the corned beef.  I use a flat cut style of corned beef versus the point cut, as well.  This recipe has been saved to my recipe book and it will be made way before next St Patti's Day!!

I made on St. Patty's day and it turned out really good. I think that next time I will cut down on the veggies and cook for 10 hours. Hubby liked it and that was what I was looking for. Thanks

if I could give 10 stars, I would!  We loved this!!!  No room for cabbage in the crock pot, so we served German Slaw (w/ oil and vinegar base) and YUUUMMMM!  The soft and tenderness of the beef with the crunchy of the slaw was super, and great the next day on Rye bread as a sandwich too!  This is a definate go-to recipe now!  THANKS

the corned beef was so tender and the vegies were great.  Used a 2lb. corned beef.  my DH and I were fighting over the last piece.  I thought it would be more than enough for the two of us.  I guess I was wrong.

This recipe was absolutely amazing and made our St. Patty's Day fantastic thank you very much for this!!!!  Cooked it on high for about 5 and half-6 hours and it was mouthwatering again many props to the cook on this one!!!  A splash of white vinegar on top of the pile of cabbage mix was tasty as well (a tradition from my friend's family)  Again thanks for this one will be made many times!!!

This was great and easy! I replaced another receipe from this site that called for George Killian’s Irish Red Beer and although that one was good, this I felt was better. I did not cut my brisket in half and found I only needed to cook the meat 5 hours and then another 2 after I added the cabbage. Excellent!

5 stars for convenience and simplicity.  Unfortunately, I was not impressed by the flavor.  The vinegar added a bit of sweetness but over-all the dish was suprisingly bland.

Fabulous!! (Note-I cooked only the brisket.) Cut the sugar to one tablespoon and added enough water to completely cover brisket.  I cooked in crock pot on low all day and then put brisket in casserole dish, added several large spoonfuls of juice (from crock pot)(brisket was not quite covered with juice),  drizzled honey over the top, covered with foil and put in the oven for an additional hour at 350.  Before serving, I shredded the corned beef with a fork and knife. I used the remaining juice in the crock pot to cook the cabbage on the stove top. Received rave reviews from my dinner guests and impressed myself!

My husband and I don't care for cabbage, and he's never had corned beef before so he was leary. I couldn't fit everything in, so I think that half the carrots and potatos made it in. I also crammed in as much cabbage that would fit. This needs to be either a smaller piece of meat and less ingredients or a much larger crock pot. I used a 5 1/2 qt. one. This wasn't the best corned beef I've eaten, but for convience it was good. I might make this for next St. Patty's Day, but I won't make it for an every day meal.

I followed this recipe to the letter. We enjoyed the flavor of the Corned Beef tremendously however,thought the veggies were way too salty. I think next time I will cut back on the salt. We will make this again and again if just for the wonderful meat for sandwiches!!!!!!!

This was my first time making corned beef and cabbage, and it was wonderful.  My family loved it, and even my picky eater liked the potatoes and carrots.  It was very tender and tasted great!  I will definitely be making this for St. Patrick's Day again next year!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow, it was my 1st time making corned beef. My hubby loved it, he had seconds, even my 9 yr old liked it. I followed some of the reviewers suggestions, and put the brisket 1st, then used apple juice instead of water or vinegar & sugar.

I have had corned beef turn out better with water and the spice packet (and I will never stray from that again). Some recipes try too hard, this is one of them.  I did not care for this recipe.

This was my first time making (or eating) corned beef and cabbage, and it was great!  My boyfriend and the rest of my dinner guests all love corned beef, and they couldn't stop raving about how good it was.  I did put the meat in first, and I used one additional cup of water (plus one beef bouillon cube).  I cooked on low for 9 hours and then turned it up to high and added in the cabbage for an additional 2 hours (to steam, like others recommended).  Other than that, I made exactly as written.  All the veggies were so delicious and tender (not falling apart at all), and the meat was amazing.  Will definitely use this recipe when I make corned beef again!  Thanks for making me look like a pro! ;o)

This recipe was very "no fuss" and very tasty.  I didn't alter a thing.  The vinegar and corned beef spices gave the vegetables a nice tang.  Great flavor overall.  I cooked mine for 8 hours and the meat was fall-apart tender.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe tonight for a St. Patrick's Day party.  I have never cooked corned beef (and I am not Irish) so I had no idea what to expect.  It turned out REALLY good.  All my guests went back for seconds!  I followed the recipe exactly except I put the meat on the  bootom and then topped with veggies (I don't like soggy veggies).  And I used white potatoes because I didn't have red skins.  This was very easy and I will make it again!  Thanks!!

The corned beef turned out really good but I did not care for the vegtables.  I will keep looking for a recipe that makes both turn out good.  Until then I will continue to cook only the beef this way.

This was ok my corned beef was tough only beacuse I cooked the meat for two hours cause they said the meat would shrin well it didn't shrink much, then I added my potatoes and carrots then I didn't have no room for my cabbage in my crock pot, so I had to take it out of the crock pot to put it in a pan to put in the oven. Which I cooked for the remainding time and it was just no good I would not make it again I've always wanted to make Corned Beef and Cabbage was my 1st time, I don't think I do again

Back to old way of cooking Corned beef. Came out dry (How?)and bland? I put it in bottom and used all spice pack. Cooked 9 hrs on low after 1/2 on hi to get it going. Cooked carrots, potatoes & onion ( along with two sticks celery)with it and they came out ok, carrots had a different flavour but were ok, steamed cabbage at time to serve. Leftovers were good in a baked hash

This was really good. My corned beef didn't come with a spice packet, so I added some extra garlic, peppercorns, & beef bullion. To get it to fit in the pot, I but the beef on the bottom & only used half the cabbage. Turned out great. Even my 2 year old loved it!

made this for St Patty's Day.  Potatoes and carrots had a great flavor, meat could have been a little more tender.  We gobbled it down with a couple beers, and were happy.  Looking forward to sandwiches from leftovers.

Excellent!  My first time making Corned Beef.  Made it as posted, but needed to add a bit more water so the beef was more covered.  I also skipped on the cabbage, as we do not like it.

Came out delicious!  No hint of sweet and sour, as someone else posted.  Tasted just like corned beef!

This was okay. The meat turned out well, but the vegetables were rather unappetizing. I used a bottle of beer instead of water, and unpeeled red potatoes cut in half. 

That said, you can't beat coming home to a corned beef dinner on St. Patricks' Day!

I did exacly as the recipe called for but instead of water, I added apple juice(per another reviewers suggestion) instead of water.  I didn't care for the taste.  Next time I am going to try the water, the vinegar, and the sugar and see how that turns out.

This was very good overall.  My husband and I both found the veggies to be too seasoned, but I think that is because we are used to me dumping everything into a crockpot, pouring water over it and boiling everything for a couple of hours.  The meat was very tender and delicious.  I was thrilled with how easy this was.  I got it all set up in the morning and largely ignored it for the rest of the day.  And it made my whole house smell delicious.  I was getting hungry for dinner at 2:30pm!

By no means is this the "perfect" corned beef and cabbage recipe. but it may be the perfect slow cooker Corned beef and Cabbage. I made exactly as recipe states except, I substituted Guinness for water. I think I used 4 total to cover the meat. 9 hours later, wah lah, St Pats excellence.

I just made the meat without the veggies and it was delicious.  My kids didn't like the flavor but the rest of us ate it up.  Very rich meat.  I served it with broccoli/ramen noodle cole slaw and it was a great combo!  I love how tender it got in the crock pot over about 10 hours on low!!

I followed this recipe.. The only thing I changed was added a couple more bay leafs and used a 6 quart crockpot. What an excellent recipe! My absolute favorite! I had guests and they were stunned!

Delicious! Best corned beef I've made.  Cooked in the slow cooker on low for 12 hours.  Plenty of leftovers too!

I looked forward to this all day but I was disappointed. Followed directions with meat at the bottom. Next time I will do the cabbage and potatoes seperate.  The cabbage came out dark and with an odd flavor almost burnt tasting.

Fantastic!  Love the flavor.  My hubby didn't care for the extra veggies (he thinks corned beef and cabbage should be just that!) But everyone else, even my picky 12 yr old liked it.  Leftovers were even better the next day!

This is an incredibly easy recipe.  I used fingerling potatos, which was excellent and cooked the meat for 4 hours on high in the slow cooker.  Everyone loved it!
