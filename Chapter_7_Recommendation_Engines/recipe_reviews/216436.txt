I wasn't sure about the mayo in this, but it turned out great!  The end result is a moist, delicious banana bread that doesn't have as many calories and fat grams as most recipes but just as much taste.  I am definitely keeping this recipe for future use!

I have a similar recipe that I tweeked to make it low fat and low sugar.
Use 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 AP flour.  Same with sugar = 1/2 splenda 1/2 regular sugar.  Instead of mayo (yuk) use low fat sour cream.  Add cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg, to taste.  Adds tons of flavor.  No one knows that mine is low fat and low sugar.  It's that good!!!

I added a teaspoon of baking powder. I made no other changes. I made muffins out of this recipe. I got exactly 12 and I baked them at 350 for just under 20 minutes. The only issue I had with this banana bread came out dry. My bananas weren't big--all three of them were medium sized which could have been the problem. I really couldn't tell that I baked these with mayonnaise and I'll be honest, I was worried about that. I'd like to try this again with another banana and see if that helps but these really were quite dry.

I doubled this recipe and it made 3 loaves.  Very yummy.  I also used half mayo and half apple sauce and it was excellent.  Super moist with a nice tang.  I added some cinnimon as well, 2 tsp.  Have made several times now and my family loves it!

This turned out pretty well.  I chopped up some almonds and threw them in and also used half brown sugar, half white sugar.  It's quite moist but it took a little longer to cook than 45 minutes--more like 55

I was a tad leary of the mayo in it but was on the hunt for a recipe I had everything for, and was very low on butter... it was SOOOO yummy, but I needed to increase the baking time to about an hour, and there was still a bit that was gooey.... but hands down... YUMMY!!!

This tastes excellent.  I might try cutting back a little on the sugar next time, as it was just a tiny bit on the sweet side for me, but otherwise great.  Nice alternative if you don't have butter on hand too!

This banana bread recipe has great flavor.  I made one change because of what I had on hand, which was to use 1/2 cup buttermilk instead of the mayo. The banana bread was delicious but I did notice the crust was a little rubbery--possibly because I didn't use mayo?  Either way it's worth a little sacrifice in texture for the lower fat.  I will definitely make it again!

No changes to original recipe.   I am an old ancient lady who has been making banana loaves for what seems like an eternity.   Tried this recipe at the weekend and gave half of my loaf to my Daughter in Law who is an expert Banana loaf eater.   Just got an email from her raving about the flavour and moistness.   So guess what this simple and cheap to make loaf will become Number ONE.   I don't believe in making substitutions to submitted recipes unless it is for health reasons.

This was sooo good it was hard not to eat more than 1 serving.  Even my husband ate it with all the mmm ahhh yumm noises.  I only had white flour so thats what i used, although next time i will have whole wheat, and instead of a cup of white sugar i used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of splenda.  I only had two bananas so i did add about 1/2 cup of no sugar added applesauce.  I also used plain unsweetened greek yogurt instead of mayo, even though i have the light stuff, it gave it a little protien and got rid of any extra fat, calories, sodium, and even cut back on the carbs. I also was a little leary off the "tang" of the mayo. I added 2 oz. of crushed up walnuts too. Cooked for a little longer to but my oven is difficult.  Overall very moist, and unrecognizable as "diet".

I must add my voice to those mayo skeptics, rather the voice of my daughter, an actual mayo lover (fries won't do without it). I told her to reserve judgment until she tried it, and she has decided that it is the best banana bread I've ever made - and she finally admits that it's cake instead of bread - although with the substitution of wheat flour, it has even more nutrition (to balance out the chocolate chips..). 


Thanks for this simple, easy-to-remember, delicious recipe!

Excellent recipe. Couldn't help to tweak this to make it healthier as I am trying to reduce cal and fat where I can. This is a great base recipe and very easy to make. VERY!!!
Changes:
Flour: 1/2 cup wholemeal flour and 1 cup white. Will try all wholemeal next time.
Only had 2 Bananas so added: 61g Brambly Apple Sauce 
Added 93g Blueberries (had some left over from some muffins and wanted to use them up)
Added 2.5 tsp of cinnamon - will add more the next time as I LOVE cinnamon
Only used 1/2 cup (110g) of light brown muscovado sugar and no white. I thought it was sweet enough with the added fruit. I love sugar and sweet things but this is a healthier option.  When using brown you dont need to use as much sugar.
I dusted the greased pan with flour and cinnamon :)
Used soured cream instead of mayo as it was expiring soon and wanted to use it up.
The smell throughout the house was divine and couldn't help braking a small piece off when it was cooling on the wrack.
RECOMMEND RECOMMEND RECOMMEND happy baking

This IS the best, but in using 2 brand new ovens for this recipe (1 electric and 1 gas -- we move every year to a different ski resort), I found that it definitely does need to cook about 10 min. longer --  55 minutes is perfect.  I always make it ahead and freeze in in individual wrappings for company.

I used brown sugar instead and added nutmeg (pantrys decision), and accidentally cooked it for 15 minutes too long. It came out like malt loaf!

This was delicious. ...  I'm going to say it..I found some people hate this word MOIST!  The only change I made was that I used olive oil mayo because that's all I had in the house.  I was wary but it was delicious and shaved a few calories and fat off of the original. Nom nom nom.   Thank you for sharing.

This is surprisingly good!  I do not know why the traditional recipe needs so much butter, but I like the taste and aroma.  One change I made was the addition of 1/2 chopped walnuts.

I took another reviewer's suggestion and used half light mayo and half applesauce.  Also used 4 very ripe medium sized bananas. When making banana things I like to blend them in the blender with the other wet ingredients--I did that here, too. Subbed 1/2 cup bread flour and also added 2 tbl oat bran.  Cut sugar down to 3/4 cup and added 1/3 cup chocolate chips on top of the batter when it was in the pan so they wouldn't sink to the bottom.  The choc chips make it so sweet I could even cut the sugar down more next time. It took 50 minutes to bake and even then it was very moist and the texture is a little gummy but not that noticeable. However, the flavor is great and my family liked this a lot.

I will make this again.

It's a daily thing at my house. breakfast for my son, a healthy evening snack for me. I use Splenda instead of sugar and whole wheat flour ,add toasted pecans or walnuts or dried blueberries or whatever I have on hand! If you don't have overripe bananas you can "cook" them to get them ready! Google it!

I doubled the recipe, but use 3/4 c brown sugar and 3/4 c raw sugar, which was 1/2 c less than recipe called for. I used a little less mayo also. Used Dukes Mayo just because my daughter insists it SO much better! ?? Very tasty!

I too was afraid of the mayonnaise but it’s delicious. I cut back a little on the sugar and added 1 more banana but that’s my personal preference by a quarter cup. Other than that this is a moist, dense loaf with tons of great flavor.

Delicious and moist and easy and fast to throw together.  I added 1/3 cup chocolate chips to the batter.  It did take longer than 45 minutes to bake, so I closed off the oven and let it sit in there for an additional 5 minutes and it was perfect.

I made some adjustments to the ingredients because I have to do low fat and low sugar being a Pancreatic Cancer survivor with an altered digestive system. 
Here are my adaptations:

-1/3 cup of maple syrup instead of white sugar 

-King Arthur gluten-free All purpose baking mix  instead of all purpose flour

- 1/4 cup fat-free Greek yogurt and 1/4 cup of the light mayonnaise

 I also used large bananas which made this really moist and still light

It turned delicious. I will definitely make this on a regular basis.

I'm sure the original recipe is great but I had to cut out the sugar and added 1 tsp of stevia and 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce for this recipe. My daughter is on a low fat/low sugar diet because she was only born with half of her pancreas. My Bonnie LOVES her banana bread and until yesterday, she hasn't had it for years! Applesauce and stevia is a great substution if you or a loved one happens to be a diabetic of have a rare health disorder.

Lighter than expected. A winner.  Should be a no brainer as eggs and oil go into cakes as well. Didn't have light mayo, used normal. Will make again.

I used quinoa flour instead of white flour. I had to add about 25 minutes to the baking time. This is a very moist, delicious recipe that was just a bit too sweet for me. Next time I will cut the sugar in half.

I made this vegan by using a product called 'Neat Egg' to replace the egg (it's available in most grocery stores and very easy to use), and I used a vegan mayo.  It turned out fantastic!

I only had 2 bananas but I forged ahead anyway. It came out fine. I used King Arthur whole wheat flour, half the sugar and threw in some baking powder. I made it into cupcakes, and it made exactly 12. On top of 6 of them, I put a very small half square of white chocolate, and smeared it around when it softened. Just made a thin film on the top. Tasted great!!!

I enjoyed this recipe! So easy to make and I like that there is no butter!  I would definitely make it again -- I added walnuts to the top (my husband picks them off - otherwise they would have been IN the bread!). Delicious!

I used a couple tablespoons of miracle whip and about 1/2 cup of applesauce and added some chopped walnuts.  This was very delicious and it was not dry.

Like others I was a little leery about the mayonnaise in the recipe. When I opened the oven door and saw such a beautiful, golden, high loaf of banana bread I was very impressed! Very moist, light, and delicious. I followed the recipe as written except replaced 1/2 cup of the white flour with 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Outstanding!

I took everyone's suggestions and did half mayo, half applesauce. Half brown sugar and half white sugar. And lastly half whole wheat flour half white flour. It also took longer then 45 minutes for mine to cook but my power went out halfway through and I wasn't sure exactly how much time was left when I had to restart my oven. Nonetheless it was moist and very delicious. Can't wait to make it again!

This is so moist! It's delicious- instead of the egg I added in about a half a cup of blueberries. Wonderful.

I was very leery of the mayo in this, because I hate mayo, but I didn't have any yogurt or other substitutes, so I gave it a try. My third banana was way too overripe, so I used 2 big ripe bananas and a tad extra mayo. I did sub out a half cup of flour for whole wheat. I put the batter into 3 mini loaf pans, baked for about 35 minutes at 325 degrees and just tried my first slice. Delicious!! I am impressed with how simple this recipe is, and how great the results were. No soggy middle, no dry texture, no mayo flavor, just pure goodness. This may be my new go-to recipe for banana bread. Much simpler than my other healthy version, and it tastes like full fat.

I was a bit nervous when I saw mayo, but this is by far one of the best banana breads I have made and ate!
