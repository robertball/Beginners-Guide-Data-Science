This dish was fabulous.  I didn't have fresh ginger so I substituted ground ginger and I added more than a "pinch" of red pepper.  This was so good I made it three days in a row.

This is good! A nice change and an interesting way to use green beans. Because of what I had on hand, I made some alterations -- ground instead of fresh ginger; pinch 'a cayenne instead of red chile pepper; and omitted the oyster sauce. Still a good side dish, and I will make again. Thanks.

Excellent, just like the way restaurants serve them, although in the restaurant version the beans are deep fried first until the skin's shriveled.  I only used 2 tbsp of oil and added a spring onion along with the garlic and ginger.

This was a very spicy and flavorful dish.  You may want to adjust the red pepper to your own tastes though.  My version turned out a little too spicy for me.  I'll definetly make this again, but with less pepper next time!

Great, easy recipe!  But I think of it more as a vegetable side dish, rather than a salad.  Thanks!

This was a nice change of pace from regular old green beans.  I served this with Thai Style Chicken Pasta (from this site) which made for a nice spicy meal.  I didn't use the oyster sauce and I used frozen chopped green beans, but it still turned out great.  I will make this again.

Really very good!  I recommend using a light soy sauce, though.  Fresh ginger is a  must, in my opinion.  I'm going to try this with other green veggies as well.

Not amazing, just pretty good. Made double and it went mighty fast with 7 people eating. Put in red chili flakes but not enough to give it more than a little flavour and left out the oyster sauce as I discovered I didn't have any in the kitchen. Better than just steaming them by far.

Hmmm...this wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  I don't agree with the statement that these are close to the restaurant version; I really don't think so.  I used oyster sauce for the first time in this recipe.  I will try to substitute it when called for in the future; I don't care for it.  The remaining ingredients didn't really stand out, so if I make this again, I'll increase the amounts of everything and find something to replace the oyster sauce.

The seasoning was a nice change to plain ole green beans. It was easy to prepare and stir fry. I love the addition of the oyster sauce with garlic, ginger and soy sauce as it always makes for a great sauce. However I just eye-balled the soy sauce and oyster sauce, to taste, never measuring. I omitted the red chili pepper, per family’s request, but added some fresh ground black pepper. Great flavors, not overwhelming and was good as a side dish tonight. The green beans were tender crisp, just right. This was served warm with, “Japanese Ginger Pork,” and “Easy Bok Choy,” also from this website.

These are gooood. I used flakes instead of a whole chili, and left out the soy altogether (I love oyster sauce and it's plenty salty without adding soy). Went great with Lime-Marinated Grilled Salmon from this site. Thanks!

This tastes even better than the green beans I usually get from Chinese restaurants! One suggestion: if you want it spicy, use extra peppers. I like to cut one open over the beans on my plate for maximum heat.

This is the closest to the restaurant version I have been able to find. It can be played with a little, I used Hoisin sauce instead of Oyster, because I had some in the fridge. I also used ground ginger instead of fresh and added a little more red pepper flakes. In an effort to make it more healthy, I pre-steamed the green beans slightly and dropped the oil amount to about a tsp. Yummy!

Agree with other reviewers that this was VERY salty, even with low sodium soy sauce!  I liked the flavor, so perhaps 2 tsp. of soy sauce would be ample for the amount of green beans.  I also used only about 1 TBS of oil, and I drizzled on about 2 tsp. sesame oil right before serving.

Really Good.  I did cut back the Soy in 1/2 and it was perfect.  A nice diversion from plain old green beans.

This wasn't good to me and I don't think it came anywhere near to the restaurant taste. I followed the directions to a T and the sauces were too overbearing and I couldn't enjoy the taste of the beans. I will not make it again.

These are really great.  I often cook green beans by quick sauteing them.  I used dried red pepper flakes and low sodium soy sayce, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I like oyster sauce very much, and I often try to find recipes to use it, but I didn't find the flavor overwhelming by any means. I really enjoyed these.

Really a simple and delicious recipe!  Thank you for this!  I had fish sauce instead of oyster sauce, which isn’t really a substitute, but it worked. Added Tony Cacheres, but I add that to everything. Highly recommend this!!!!

This green bean salad was wonderful. Will definitely make again. Used this as a side with steamed rice for Japanese Ginger Pork as someone had made the suggestion there. 
Thanks!

I made this with the marinated pork  and mashed potato's.  What a compliment to a great dinner.

I did not have the oyster sauce, so I omitted it.  I also substituted chili power for the chili pepper.

I left out the oyster sauce and it appealed to everyone. Good change for Christmas.

This was a simple & very tasty recipe for fresh green beans! I made two batches one with cayenne pepper & one with no pepper so the kids could enjoy too!

I made these yesterday on my wok. They have a salty/sour taste to them so I added a couple tbsps of sugar to suit my tastes. Turned out delicious

I served this with the "Miso Maple Glazed Salmon" also from this site and dinner was perfect.  Simple and quick.  Only change I made was adding a bit of mirin to balance out the saltiness.
