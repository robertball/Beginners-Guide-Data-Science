These are a fantastic jumping off point to put your own spin on an "everything" cupcake.  I changed up some of the ingredients (picky eaters at my house) so here goes: I used a yellow cake mix, applesauce instead of oil, unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of water, and added white chocolate chips and m&ms.  I also omitted the coconut and peanut butter.  I made a simple cream cheese frosting.  
The picky eater LOVED them.

These were delicious and so much fun too! The only change I had to make was using a yellow cake mix instead of white b/c I bought the wrong one, lol. These had really great flavor and I really loved all of the add-ins! After piping on the frosting, I topped them w/ more mini chips, toffee pieces and butterscothch chips, just to make them look pretty. Will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

It didn't stay that long after I served it. Fluffiest cupcake ever with tons of fillings. Would surely satisfy anyone with sweet tooth.

By far my favorite cupcakes!!! I added peanut butter to the cake batter and didn't add marshmallows. Then topped with a chocolate buttercream icing. Omg incredible!!

I put the chips in a small strainer straddling the mixing bowl. I sprinkled dry cake mix over the chips and sifted the remainder mix into the mixing bowl and continued following the recipe as listed. I folded the coated chips into the bowl as directed. As mentioned from other reviews, I doubled the cupcake papers. The "goodies" stayed suspended throughout the cupcake yet still super moist the extra paper was a good decision.

This is an awesome recipe.  I've made it numerous times and I think it is better with yellow cake mix versus white cake mix.  It is also just as good (if not better) without frosting.

So delicious.  Favorite cupcake ever.  I did make the mix like this recipe said, not like the box said, including just using the egg whites even though I did use a yellow cake mix so it would have been okay to use the yolks. I just thought the cupcakes would already be rich enough so the whites seemed enough.  I think that was a good call.  These were light and fluffy.  Other than the marshmallows, most everything gravitated to the bottom, but I got no complaints on that little treasure trove!  Still, I think I have heard if you coat the denser chocolate and butterscotch items in flour it will stay up in the cake a little.  Next time.  Also USE TWO cupcake liners.  These are so gooey in some spots mine stuck to the tin and tore apart.  Didn't stop us from eating them, but I wanted them to be pretty too.  I didn't bother to pipe in the peanut butter into the cupcake, seemed not appealing for some reason.
