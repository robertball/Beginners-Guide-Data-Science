I made this recipe as is to serve with crepes! On it's own is very good. I did the proper adjustment of sugar to the acidity of my berries. I only had blueberries and Grand Marnier at hand. I must say that it was delicious, and I let it cool off to thicken. Will make this versatile sauce again and again. The possibilities are endless with it!

Very good! I halved as I had a small container of blackberries to use up. Replaced schnapps with white cranberry juice as it was for my son. Really tasty on pancakes.

Was awesome! Made the sauce with fresh blackberries I froze during this summer (2017). I added a little more sugar.  Did not add the whole berries when topping the cheesecake nor did I add schnapps to the blackberry mixture.
It was perfect and many compliments.

Yum. I used the entire package of blackberries, probably closer to three cups. I didn't have any schnapps, so I used chambord. I also added a teaspoon or so of pectin while cooking because I wanted it a little thicker. This was excellent over cheesecake.
