I made these for the superbowl party.  They are great!!  Not too sweet.  I used instant coffee ( I don't know what espresso powder is).  I made them small and got 60 cookies.  The bigger ones got real flat, i liked the smaller fatter ones.  The last part of the batch I added dried canberries.  Very good.  I think next time I make them I will try hazelnuts.  Oh and did I mention that I do not bake.  I usually use cake/cookie mixes.  These were very good and very easy.

Great cakey, chewey texture. The macadamia nuts lend a good, salty crunch. I used a bit more espresso powder (1.5 Tablespoons) but that's because I really like the taste of espresso. I cooked them only about 10 minutes, which was perfect. I will make these again.

These cookies are ok. It's hard to really taste the chocolate, and I even added some chocolate chips. I also added a little extra flour to prevent really flat cookies. I was surprised to find a cookie recipe like this with wheat flour. Maybe they would be better with walnuts or almonds, and maybe some butterscotch chips. I think that macadamias taste a bit like crayons.

These were good, maybe not 'super'... they reminded me of the brownies that I make, and the brownies are easier (not that these were difficult!). 
The first batch I baked for 12 minutes, and they were okay, second batch I did 10 minutes and they were much better! 
Also, I used hazelnuts instead of macadamia. The flavour really goes well with the instant coffee. I got 26 good sized cookies. Next time I will chill the dough for a bit before making the cookies.

Made these today but I used chopped pecans. I couldn't find any macadamia nuts in any of our stores here. I forgot to melt the chocolate, so I added 1 cup of choc chips and tbsp of cocoa. I also increased the sugar to 1 cup brown and 1/2 cup white. First batch needed 11 minutes to bake ( I think I made them too big.) I just had one and all I say is...OMG. Hubby just asked for another!
