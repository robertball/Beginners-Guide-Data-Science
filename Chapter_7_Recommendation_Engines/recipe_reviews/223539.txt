New York Pushcart Onions (For Hot Dogs) Haiku: "Cinnamon scared me. But this turned out really good! Made my hot dog yum!" I scaled back for serving this on 3 hot dogs, a little nervous about the inclusion of cinnamon, but I followed the recipe as written (using Sriracha for the pepper sauce), and was really thrilled w/ the results! Too bad eating it didn't transport me from my Georgia patio to the streets of New York though.

I didn't have any bell peppers so I made it with just the onions.  I used light brown sugar instead of white to give it a richer flavor.  This is excellent!

Hubby has a hard time with raw onions on anything. This was a perfect recipe for him. I did add a dash of bbq sauce to the mix and it was perfect! He wants this on his dogs from now on. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely loved this recipe and have no qualms in rating it 5 stars.  I used Peruvian Sweet Onions and I am positive that was a great plus.  My tweaks were: used brown sugar versus white, added a dash of salt and only 1/4 cup of water.  I made this for the Recipe Group selection.  Thank you Ethier65 for sharing your delicious recipe - it is a definite keeper and will be used repeatedly!

Recipe Group selection 11/3/12. My teens gave it a thumbs up, my husband did not. I would advise making the onions thinly sliced. They did take much longer to soften to the point where you could really bite through them. I used red peppers instead of green. If I was to do this again I would use slightly more ketchup and less chili powder. Not that there is alot to begin with but. My husband did not like the sauce. He said that if the onion were diced he might like it better.
I am giving it a 5 because the recipe was followed and it was what it was supposed to be.

Made this for Recipe Group...We really enjoyed these, but I did make a couple minor changes...First, I only had one onion, but I still kept all of the other ingredients the same, except the water, which I reduced to 1/4 cup b/c the amount of water seemed excessive to me, and I thought that was perfect! I did use the optional green pepper, and I thought that was a great addition! I was skeptical on using the cinnamon, and almost didn't, but decided to and it was fine (couldn't really taste it). Great flavor and not too spicy, which is why my mom loved them so much. I will definitely be making these again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I absolutely loved these! Very tasty! I accidently had an outpour of cinnamon when I added my "dash" so ended up w/about 1/4 tsp or more in a half batch of this but it was still awesome!! Made for Allrecipes Recipe Group. Join us on "the buzz" every thurs. to nominate new recipes to try. Everyone is welcome!!

I've never had a New York pushcart hot dog - but gave these a try, and they were really good! No need for any other toppings really, except maybe a bit of mustard.

Very good, and very authentic! I made this as is and threw it on top of some keilbasa with my famous chilli and cream cheese sauce and some brown mustard. Unbelievably good! like heaven prancing over my taste buds.

I thought this added great flavor to the hotdogs and would be perfect for the summer cook-outs that will be happening shortly.   I didn’t have any green peppers, but it still was very tasty without it.  This had been a Recipe Group selection for 11/3/12 that I had missed.  I’m glad I had saved the recipe to try - better late than never.

This was excellent. Made for 4th of July. No guest had ever had anything like it before (we’re from Texas lol) And ALL loved it   Made exactly as written but did substitute brown sugar for the white as another reviewer had suggested. Will definitely make again. Thank you for the recipe!

I tried this recipe instead of another one because it used ketchup as the tomato base, The other used a small amount of tomato paste, leaving me to have to find something to do with the rest of the can. I hate recipes that use partial cans! This turned out great. I didn't have the peppers but they'd be good in it too. I left out the sugar because I figured the ketchup was sweet and I used sweet Vidalia onions.  I like these onions pretty sweet so next time I will include the sugar too.

Great recipe! Very easy and tasty recipe. I used chicken stock instead of water. The cinnamon and chili powder really gives it that flavor i was looking for.

i made this recipe, but I omitted so much water.  The onions caramelize themselves with the onions and other ingredients.  I also omitted the green peppers for hot dogs but added them for burgers and sausages.. On the streets of the big apple you will not see green peppers for the most part , in push cart onions, although I love it. :)

Cut onions in smaller pieces so would be more unified and used a little more ketchup, maybe 1/3 cup and 4 hits of hot sauce but it was great!  Will make again and again ...

We love hot dogs so I had to try this. These are fantastic!!  I didn't add the green peppers, swapped the white sugar with brown sugar, and reduced the water to 1/4 cup like other reviewers. Next time I might add the full cup and cook it down to see how that works. Maybe the onions will be a wee bit softer that way. Either way, we loved them on our hot dogs. I also used some of the leftovers on a grilled cheese sandwich. Yum!!

Omitted the bell pepper, cinnamon. Used tabasco, franks red hot sauce and a dab of sriracha (obviously we love hot sauce). Was incredibly delicious! Almost exactly like the pushcart at our local home depot. Will definitely be making this again!

Made this recipe to put in hot dogs at a cookout.  I doubled the recipe and they ate almost the whole container.  I accidently over cooked it, but it still turned out fine.  My husband loved it.  Will fix it again.

Very good!  Omitted sugar (because I used Vidalia sweet onions) and I'm glad I did because it was sweet enough for us.  Served on smoked sausage dogs and we loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

These were outstanding on top of our grilled brats!  I was somewhat skeptical, as I was mixing it all up, but the flavor of these is just awesome!  Thanks for much for sharing this recipe, ETHIER65!

Loved these!  I sauté onions and peppers often, and I really enjoyed the taste of the added spices in this.  I thought the cinnamon sounded liked it didn't belong with the other spices, but, it worked.  I down scaled this enough to have for 4 hot dogs.  Nice recipe that I will be making again.  Thanks ETHIER65 for sharing your recipe.

Since I have no point of reference it's hard to rate this recipe.  So I have no idea how this compares to the real deal.  I made it exactly as written except omitted the bell pepper as I didn't have one.  This wasn't bad but nothing special.  I think I'll stick to mustard and relish.  I made this for the Recipe Group.
