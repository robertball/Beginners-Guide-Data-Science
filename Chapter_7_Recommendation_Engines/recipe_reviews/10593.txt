I thought  I would come back again to rate.  I have made these Biscotti since I first found this recipe.  I just got done making a double batch.  I didn't have any almonds so I sub dried cranberries, didn't have lemon so I used orange zest.  These are the best and everyone whose tried them rave about this recipe.  Thanks again Rosina.

DELICIOUS!!  Texture was good too.  Extract can be replaced with fiore de sicilia (orange flower water and vanilla) for another traditional italian flavor.  I made 2 batches one with anise and one with the orange flavor.  Everyone was happy!

Good basic recipe.  It needed more flour though to keep the dough from being too sticky.  I used margarine instead of butter.  Also, I scored the dough first, AND I cut it before cooling it and I had little to no crumbling--but use a single-motion when cutting through, or you may pull out dough from the middle.

This is a great biscotti recipe.  I've never made biscotti before but I'm happy with the results.  I used 1/2 lemon extract and 1/2 vanilla and added about a tablespoon of poppyseeds for a lemon poppyseed biscotti.  I didn't change anything else and these are so good.  The cook time did take longer than I anticipated.  It took more than ten minutes to crisp them up.  More like twenty minutes.

Great biscotti.  I used orange zest instead of lemon.  Another addition to the Christmas gift baskets this year.  This and the Cappuccino in a Jar recipe are a great hostess gift for all those holiday parties!

To avoid some of the crumbling when cutting into indiv pieces - Score the loaves before you bake.  then let cool a little before cutting into indiv pieces.  hope this helps.

The cookies taste delicious and are easy to make but they crumble terribly when slicing.  I have tried almonds finely chopped,sliced almonds, and even tried cutting 5 minutes out of the oven, 20 minutes cool or an hour cool and even with a damp paper towel when holding the cookies to slice.  They still are crumbly.  I have made them with  3 teaspoons of almond extract and no almonds and they are better to work with.

this was the fourth biscotti recipe I have tried and it was by far the best.  I substituted the almonds for cranberries and found the flavor excellent.  Instead of an egg white, I used the egg yolk mixed with a few Tbs of water (I was using egg whites for another recipe).   I brought these to work as holiday christmas presents for the guys in my office and they all loved them!  One guy even said that they were better than the ones he normally gets at Starbucks!

It is pretty good if you like your biscotti not too hard. If you want it harder, I guess you'll need to lessen the butter and bake the slices for a longer time at a slighter cooler temperature. Two-thirds cup of sugar is plenty!

This is the first time I tried making biscotti, I didn't know how it would turn out but I used half wheat flour, and splenda instead of sugar. I also left out the toasted almonds because I didn't have any. I was very nervous when shaping the loafs, it seemed very crumbly. They came out perfect though! A little plain but I blame that on myself for not adding something else in since I didn't have almonds. My husband (who normally hates anything almond flavored) even liked them.

This is such a user friendly recipe.  I have made two batches, the first one I stuck to the recipe and the whole batch was eaten up in less than 3 hours so i couldnt test the how good they get with time. with the second i squeezed some orange juice and put shavings of cooking chocolate and they didnt last much longer. this is defintely a staple for me.  Oh i also added extra flour to prevent the sticky dough.

Good recipe!  They always get better with age so at first I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be.  Be patient and give a few days for the taste to mingle.

Too Crumbly! They tasted ok, but when I went to slice them they all fell apart. I maybe got 8 good looking ones out of the whole batch. These were meant to be gifts so I will have to look for another recipe to use. I tryed both a serrated knife and a steak knife. Surprisingly the steak knife worked better.

I have tried many biscotti recipes, but my Italian father-in-law says these are the best. I use toasted hazlenuts or almonds, and like to use an orange-lemon extract for the flavoring to give them a "true" Italian-taste. Very good.

These taste as good as the ones Grammom Rose use to make. I am addicted. My son was visiting, we were having our first cup of coffee and had these to dip by the time we had our second cup! 
Very easy.

Yummy! I did use vanilla instead of almond extract which was fine. Also I increased the 2nd baking time to 25 mins, however, I live at high altitude (5000') and always have to increase baking time for cookies & such.  Also, I flipped them about halfway through baking time so both sides would look "toasted." Highly recommended!

This recipe is yummy!  I used white whole wheat flour and they still were great.  I think next time I would add a little more almonds and almond extract and maybe a pinch of salt.

This was the first time my sister and I had ever made biscotti.  We followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great!  They are not super hard - which I like.  We both thought they were great with tea rather then coffee.

This has been one of my most requested cookies.   I kick up the flavor with double the almond extract.   The idea of scoring the dough before baking is a good one and will have to try that.  Normally I just an electric carving knife (its primary purpose these days) to slice through cleanly with minimal effort!

An absolutely amazing flavor. It was my first time baking biscotti, and I guess I didn't toast them long enough, but they were still delicious.

The egg white was unnecessary as it did seem to crumble a bit.  Not sure if it actually added any flavour.  As far as the rest of the flavour..it needed more. I used 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and 1/2 lemon extract.  Next time, I will double to see if it adds more flavour.

I bake hundreds of dozen cookies during the holiday season and the one time I tried biscotti I did not have any luck so I have not made any since.  Yesterday I was feeling quite festive and decided to give these a try and to my amazememnt these came out "perfect".  I have to slice them a little thinner next time but they still came out perfect I just added 5 minutes to the second baking time.  Made exactly as the recipe stated, but this is a great recipe to experiment with.  If this is the only recipe you try you will not be disappointed.  Just make sure you dont make them any wider than 2 inches since they do spread.  The smell is just heavenly.  I will never buy the over priced crumblely cookies they call biscotti again.  I will be excited to see if my Italian family shares my enthusiasm about these wonderful cookies.

This is such a wonderful biscotti recipe. I have used it to make several variations by substituting other flavors: orange zest with almonds and dried cranberries or dried cherries. Mini chocolate chips are also a wonderful addition. Everyone loves these when served with coffee or tea. Delight your co-workers!

VERY good!  I put in 1/4 cup mini chips in one of the loaves, and instead of using almond extract, used 1.5 tsp of amaretto.  Enjoy it real Italian style - serve with a small cup of almond brandy to dip the biscotti in!

I love this recipe- I use belgium chocolate instead of nuts and vanilla instead of the almond extract. Got rave reviews from the italians.

i've never made biscotti before so i must say that these are delicious and very easy to make. i followed the recipe exactly using the almonds and almond extract and i'm very impressed (with myself :) ) can't wait to try a chocolate biscotti tomorrow.

Pretty good. This was my first try at biscotti and it was fairly easy to make. Think I'll add chocolate chips next time for added flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first time making biscotti, and I thought it was a big success! Instead of using 1/2 cup butter, I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup oil. This recipe is definitely going to be put into my recipe box!

I made the anise version...an acquired taste where most children are concerned!  Otherwise, this is a great traditional biscotti recipe!

these were amazing, my first time making biscotti and no one could keep their hands off them, they didn't even get a chance to harden (delicious anyway)! As suggested I used vanilla extract and filberts. thanks Rosina.

i followed it exactly and i'm afraid it came out more like a scone than a biscotti. too floury...maybe less flour. but i won't use this recipe next time. too many people were eager to try them out but i'm not happy with them enough to serve them.

Very good and very easy - I also substituted the orange zest for lemon and almond extract for anise and added a handfull of chocolate chips.  
Brought these to work and they were DEVOURED!

Very easy to make. Were perfect to cut about 25 min later after cooling on wire rack by window. No crumbling at all. Baked again for 10 min and ate them. Delicious.

I really liked this recipe. The texture is great crunchy but not hard as a rock. The second time I baked this Biscotti I added extra almond extract, a little more sugar and almonds. The flavor was improved.

I love this recipe! I used gluten-free flour instead of normal flour and i didn't use almond extract or almonds. I substituted that for lemon juice and it worked perfectly! It isn't too hard or crumbly. I did not separate the dough and do that whole process though. I simply spread it out to all corners of the pan, let it cook, then cut it into the size i wanted, and let it cook again. Thank you so much for posting this recipe! I am definitely going to be using this again, for gifts, as well as just for snacks!

The flavor of this biscotti is really good, however, I agree it is too crumbly.  Also, the dough spread out a lot while it was baking which made the sides get very thin and burn a bit.  Makes me think this might be a bit too much butter, maybe?  I used a pizza cutter to slice them which made cutting them up really easy!  Also, I would really recommend watching one of the biscotti recipes from this site before undertaking biscotti for the first time.

This was my first try at biscotti and it turned out great! My husband can't quit dipping it into his coffee! I wanted an orange flavor so used the zest of an orange instead of the lemon, used 1/2 tsp orange extract and 1/2 tsp of almond extract. After the final baking and cooling, I melted and drizzled a high quality chocolate over them. This will be my go to recipe for biscotti! Thank you for sharing this recipe!
