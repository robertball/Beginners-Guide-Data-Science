Pretty good.  I, too, used cinnamon rolls as I had a tube to use up in the fridge.  I originally planned on this recipe to use up applesauce as well (using applesauce instead of apple butter), but I didn't have enough applesauce for this recipe, so I used pumpkin butter.  It's very good but almost sickeningly sweet.  I guess that's not too surprising, as there is a lot of sugar in the sauce, but I wonder if eliminating the apple butter (or pumpking butter) makes it less sweet and more palatable.  Either way, I'd do less sugar next time.  I had to bake these a little longer--maybe because of the cinnamon rolls.  I made a half recipe.  thanks for the recipe!

This recipe tastes marvelous! Only changes I made was substituing cinnamon rolls for the biscuts (it makes the bread softer and sweeter) and removing the extra cinnamon. Otherwise, a terrific recipe!

This was great!  I didn't have apple butter either, but it was fantastic without it.
Thanks for the recipe!

This is a new Christmas morning tradition for my family!  This bread was awesome!!  The Apple Butter makes for a nice different flavor beyond just sweet and cinnamon.  I had a hard time finding 12oz refridgerated biscuits, but after checking every single tube in the section I finally found them.

Dough came out a little dry and it did not reheat well. But it received pretty good reviews at the party I took it to.

Love this recipe! I would make a few changes though. I have made it twice now and both times I have come out with extra dry sugar topping. I would cut it down to 1/2 cup at least and I only used half of the cinnamon. My mom loved and thought the same, but neither one of us are big fans of cinnamon. I would highly recommend this to everyone.

We loved this!  I typically make another Monkey Bread recipe on this site, but had some apple butter, and this was recommended.  I am so glad we tried it.  I love the apple butter flavor in the sugar mixture.  I don't have a bundt pan, so I halved the recipe and made it in a 9x9 inch glass dish.  I cooked at 350 for 20-25 mins and it was perfect!

I followed this recipe exactly, and it was excellent!  The apple butter, sugar and butter caramelize while baking to form the most wonderful glaze.  Everyone that ate it loved it.  And it was so easy...I think it would be a fun recipe to do with children.  However, I serve this as a dessert, not breakfast.;-)

flavor is phenomenal! Made it with my 3 year old son and it was so simple to make. Used less sugar in the syrup, the apple butter gave it a nice distinctive taste that we all liked and I have very picky eaters. the only problem I encountered was the cooking time. Cooked it as directed and it was still raw so had to put it back in the pan and cook it longer, could be the pan I used, I have a stoneware monkey bread pan from William Sonoma.  Will definitely make this again but will adjust the cooking time.

My 3yr old and i make this all the time. We love it, but be warned it is wicked sweet. I didn't mind it being sweet but it's better in low doses. I also use the cinnamon rolls now. It's sweeter but i'm a cinnamon lover. The first time i used regular rolls and to me it just wasn't desert like. I didn't care for it that way. Great recipe, my daughter and i will enjoy this one for years to come.

This Tastes delicious, and looks impressive for guests.  I great dish for the kids to help with, and it's fast and easy!  I followed the recipie exactly, including the regular biscuits and apple butter.  I think other raters may have found them too sweet because they substituted the biscuits for cinnamon rolls.  A good quality apple butter really makes the dish delicious.  It makes enough for a party, and doesn't reheat nearly as well as when it first comes out, so I suggest keeping this recipie for when you have guests.
