YUM! I halved the recipe, b/c there is just the 3 of us, and that was plenty. I did add less oregano and basil, due to personal preference. After making the dressing, I decided to add just a touch more vinegar and lemon juice, until I had it where I wanted it. this is really a great tasting salad and the dressing is wonderful. I will def be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious recipe. One thing I did change was that rather than two heads of romaine lettuce, I used mixed lettuce greens. Then I only made a third of the amount of dressing (which turned out to be plenty).

This is amazing dressing...makes me so hungry when I pack a Greek salad for my boyfriend's lunch that I usually end up eating one too. Its always been my favorite to eat out but now that I know how to make the dressing, we have it whenever we want...it's the key to a really good salad. Makes the perfect amount too. I send one serving for lunch and the rest fills a salad dressing bottle for 3-4 more servings. We marinate all the goodies and then toss with the lettuce just before serving. Don't forget the pepperoncini! :-)

Loved this! I made it in the morning, put it in the fridge, and served it tonight. I followed the ingredients to the letter except for halving everything as it would have been too much for what I needed. This is definitely a keeper in my books!

This salad is a bit hit every time I serve it. Even when I don't have all the ingredients for the Greek salad, I make the dressing to use as an all-purpose vinaigrette. Delicious on any green salad!

A 5 star recipe!!!!!!! My family LOVES this salad. There is never anything left in the salad bowl. It is great as a side, but we have added chopped chicken breast to make it a meal. I will continue to make this for years to come.

I like the salad better when you add kalamata olives they go well with the feta.

I was looking for a Greek inspired salad that incorporated lettuce and found this one was delicious. I put the dressing on the side and used sparingly and used butter leaf lettuce.
Great recipe

We prepared this salad for our neighbor’s Labor Day BBQ. Everyone attending enjoyed it quite a bit! Unfortunately, our neighbors daughter Catherine got sick after eating what we think was a tainted piece of lettuce. Maybe I should have forgone it and went more authentic with just tomato and cucumber. She was supposed to start school this week and I just feel so bad! No one’s fault, just bad luck. I would substitute for Kalamata olives as well.

This is the best recipe ever! We even tried replacing the lettuce with pasta to make a pasta salad and it was still really good. We do like to use less olive oil than the recipe calls for (half the oil).

Loved it! I halved the salad too, only 2 of 
 us and added grilled chicken. For the dressing, I used 3/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup water,  substituted 2T cider vinegar for 2 of the red vinegar and added a little stevia since my favorite restaurant makes a slightly sweet Greek dressing. Perfect, thanks for the recipe.

I have been searching for the right Greek salad recipe for a long time, but nothing turned out right. Until this! This is an amazing recipe! I did cut down the olive oil to 2/3 cup and halved the oregano and basil, due to personal preference. But, the combination of ingredients here is perfect! Thank you for this!

The best and unique thing about this recipe is adding parmesan cheese to the dressing. As always I used lemon juice instead of vinegar. The lemon and parmesan flavors were a dynamic and lip-smacking  combination.

Made it for a BBQ. Marinated red onion cucumber black olives and red bell pepper in the creamy dressing. As others suggested I used about half the oil and added a dash or two of water. About 30 minutes before serving mixed chopped romaine with the veggies and then folded in chopped tomatoes and crumbled feta. Served croutons on the side.
Delicious!!!!

The best part of this salad is the dressing! Made as is, no substitutions. Served along with Greek chicken kabobs also from this site. Delicious and will make this a staple in our home.

I've been making this salad as part of a diet plan and it is absolutely amazing! It's so good that I literally eat it everyday. I didn't put the garlic in the first time I made it, just because I didn't have any at the time, and it still tasted fantastic.

The recipe was yummy!  I didn't need all the dressing, but that was a plus for next time.
