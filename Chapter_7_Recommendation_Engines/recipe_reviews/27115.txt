Try a shot of espresso instead of the chocolate.  Takes it to a five star.

This was a nice treat.  I omitted the chocolate syrup since I didn't have any on hand, which was good since otherwise I think it would have been too much chocolate flavor.

This is a yummy drink, but for me the chocolate syrup makes it a little too sweet. I often omit it. The addition of a chocolate kiss in the bottom of the glass adds the touch and also works as a garnish

Too chocolaty -- its better if you also put some Bailey's Irish Creme in this drink.  And another suggestion would be to use Vanilla Vodka.

I thought this was really good, but I added 1 or 2 ounces of half and half to this and i didn't measure the chocolate syrup and just squirted some in before I shook it, yummy, i will be making these often ;)

This is a very nice, chocolate martini, but I guess I prefer them a little creamier.  I added some light cream to mellow it out and it was very good.
