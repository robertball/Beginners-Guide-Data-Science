I doubled the recipe, but I didn't want to use that much butter, so I used 1 1/2c butter and 1 4oz container of applesauce.  The cookies are moist and delicious and there's no taste of the applesause at all.  I was intrigued by the addition of coffee liqueur and it does add an extra dimension to the flavor that the Toll House recipe doesn't have.  These were very tasty, but I only gave 4 stars because I have a soft spot for the nostalgia of the regular Toll House recipe (these are the cookies my mom always had for us when I was growing up- there's nothing that beats that!) ADDITIONAL INFO 2/26/06- these cookies got hard the very next day EVEN THOUGH I HAD THEM IN TUPPERWARE!- So, I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4

A very good chewy chocolate chip cookie. The Kahlua gives it a depth of flavor that is delicious. I might try not melting the butter next time to get a thicker cookie.

I cut the recipe in half, didnt have coffee liqueur so used all vanilla and added some chopped pecans, Plus used rounded teaspoons instead of tablespoons and got 27 soft and a little cake-like cookies. I wasnt disappointed, and would make again. thanks

I am not familiar with the taste of Mrs. Fields,  But this cookie was good.  It came out very moist and had a great flavor.
