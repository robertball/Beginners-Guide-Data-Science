So easy.  Used the method of cooking popcorn found on this site in a paper bag - one/half cup popcorn mixed with 3/4 tsp oil and placed in paper lunch bag, folding the top over several times.  In our microwave, the popcorn cooked in 1 1/2 minutes, but the directions say 2-3 minutes, stopping when there are 2 seconds between pops.  Any method you chose for your popcorn, however, don't make the same mistake I made and dump it directly nto the marshmallow mix -it took forever to dig out the unpopped kernels.  The second batch, I poured the popped corn onto paper towels and picked out the unpopped kernels before using.  Also, melted the marshmallows and butter together in a large pot on the stove and then turned it off before adding the popcorn.  Quick and easy.  This made 12 - 13 large treats.

I have never made popcorn balls before, so I didn't know what to expect. I made these with my students this morning. They were easy for my fifth and sixth graders, and look very festive! We made three bowls, one green, one red and a white one with no Jello, and took some from each bowl to make tri colored balls. We uploaded a picture. Tasty, but the popcorn is no longer crispy. I don't know if this is the way popcorn balls are!

I LOVED this recipe! It was SO easy. I used Watermelon and Green Apple Jolly Rancher Jell-O and it turned out great! My class is going to love it. I like to cook my marshmallows over the stove with the butter simultaneously because I don't have a big enough bowl for the microwave. I melted the butter and marshmallows at the same time on low and stopped the heat once there were 3-4 lumps left :)

Good and easy. Mistakenly bought the 6oz boxes of jello. Used 6 tablespoons of butter and same amount of marshmallows. Turned out well but the jello flavor was to strong. 3oz of jello is plenty. Used microwave popcorn. Standard 3oz bag produced about 8 cups of popped popcorn when the uncooked and half-cooked kernels were removed. Used 3 bags to make 2 batches.

my girls and I made this recipe following the directions but used kettle corn and dumped the popcorn on cookie sheets and poured the marshmallows and jello mixture over the popcorn. my girls had a blast making the popcorn into balls. we used cherry and lime jello and will try different flavors. this recipe will probably replace our old recipe for popcorn balls because it was a lot easier and great flavor.

These were a HUGE favorite when I was growing up.  Adding some nuts makes them even better.

Looks very easy . Would like to know is if I made these on a Friday with they be good for Sunday? I made these and they were very good. The only thing I did different was used sugar free jello and they were way too sweet. I will make these again but I will add to taste. 
Also I want to know if I made them on Friday would they be good on Sunday. Well, to my surprise I got a call saying it would be fine. I was  really surprised. What great service.

Yes, I will make it with either double the popcorn or a 1.4 oz pkg of gelatin. It was really sweet for my family.

These were so cute and easy to make. The kids loved helping make these and when they were done we put each ball in a sandwich bag and tied with festive string as an early Valentine gift for our neighbor friends. Super easy and good. We got 13 small- medium balls out of the recipe.

Followed the instruction and they turned out great. I made these to take to the office, but I may have to make another batch. My family put a serious dent in this batch!

I made these with my children, ages 6 & 9, for a 4th of July party!  It was a fun project for my kids, and they were very tasty! We used blueberry and strawberry jello for patriotic colors.
