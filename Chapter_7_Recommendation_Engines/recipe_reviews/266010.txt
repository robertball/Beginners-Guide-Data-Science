OH my! This was so good that I didn't even notice it wasn't made with pork and beef! In fact the ground turkey version is better! It's not as greasy and the combination of Spain this recipe is spot on! My family tore it up!

I haven't cooked it yet I am taking the advice and letting it sit in the fridge to "flavor up" for several hours. If this tastes as good as it smells then we're going to love it. I have a seed grinder and ground up the coriander on the spot; that probably boosted the aroma. I'll report back after cooking it. Update: I've made this 4-5 times now -- we love it!!!!

Very good recipe for turkey chorizo! I made this recipe as written along with another chorizo recipe from this site. I felt this recipe was too salty and next time I would reduce the salt by half or omit it all together. Chorizo is so full of flavor that I actually don't think the salt is necessary. Otherwise no changes necessary and I would definitely make this recipe again! Thanks for the recipe!
