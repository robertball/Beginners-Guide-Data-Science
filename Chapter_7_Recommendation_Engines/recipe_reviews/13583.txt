Very, very good.  I reduced the brown sugar to ¼ C in both cases and added a generous shot of Maker's Mark. (put some in the sweet potatoes too.)  Assumed egg whites were to be beaten to stiff peaks and folded in.

Since I made this for Easter, I substituted 2% milk for the eggnog.  It has a wonderful flavor and the topping makes a nice crust to go along with the sweet potato.  I did place it under the broiler for a few minutes to get the top a little crisper.  I will definitely make again!

Really good, and a bit different than the other versions. I added a bit of cinnamon to the topping, used milk instead of eggnog and browned the sugar under the broiler at the end. Really great side dish and I will definitely make again, maybe splenda next time.

I was so happy to find this recipe.  My husband loves the gooey marshmallow casserole but I don't care for it.  This is a great compromise, sweet without being over the top.  Even my mother-in-law who can always find something to complain about loved it!

I really enjoyed this casserole, but would definitely suggest using skim milk rather than egg nog & use half the amount. I would also only use 1/2 the amount of brown sugar in the casserole (use the whole amount on top), no salt & half the butter. I cooked it for 35 minutes & broiled it on low for 5 minutes to carmelize the topping. This makes the casserole a little more formed & sort of like an apple crisp topping...very yummy!

This is an awesome sweet potato casserole recipe, especially if you are calorie concious.  Nobody who ate it complained that it didn't have enough flavor, and I have made a much heavier version in the past for the same group.  I will use this recipe in the future exclusively.

My family traditionally doesn't like sweet potato dishes at Thanksgiving.  I love them.  So, every year I try a new one to see if we can find a winner.  I've been doing that for 20 years.  Well, this one turned out to be the one.  Everyone loved them and raved about them -- even those who usually hate sweet potatoes.  The only thing I did differently is I doubled the recipe and used butter - not margarine.  Also, I forgot to prepare the casserole dish.  It didn't stick though.  I made this the night before Thanksgiving and kept it in the fridge.  I didn't add the crumble topping until I was ready to put it in the oven.  It took a little longer to bake, obviously, because it was cold.  I baked it for about an hour.  But, I baked it along with another casserole, so if it was in there alone it would probably take less time.  My family has requested that this recipe gets added to our permanent Thanksgiving roster.  That's a big deal.  Try this.  You won't be sorry.

Wow!!!  I've tried many sweet potato recipies.  This one TOPS them all 100 times over.

I added nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, and juice from a half of a lemon.  OH MY OH MY!

The recipe alone is just fantastic.  Great Job!!!

Very easy recipe to make.  I used used half vanilla extract and half orange extract and it was great. My family loved it- even my 3 year old who tasted it "by accident".  I will definately make this again, but maybe more as a dessert instead of a side because it was very sweet.

Mmmmmmmmmm!!!!! This recipe is sooooo good. I made it to go with our turkey dinner. I'm the only one in the family that will eat sweet potatoes, so I was thinking I was going to have the whole thing to myself. Well, that didn't work out so well, I was enjoying it so much, that everyone else had to try it, and the next thing I knew, all my supposed sweet potato haters had finished it all off! I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar mixed with the potatoes, and used the full amount on top. They were so sweet, that I think next time I might even reduce it a little more. I also used whole milk instead of the egg nog. The top is so awesome, I wouldn't change a thing, and couple minutes under the broiler makes it oh so yummy!

I meant to review this after I made them for Thanksgiving.  EXCELLENT!  I made exactly as stated (except the topping, I added a handful of finely chopped pecans) and even people who said the don't like sweet potatoes, gobbled these up.  It has to be the eggnog.  Or the sweet nutty topping.  These were so very good, thank you for sharing!

This recipe is sooo easy and tastes great.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and found it too sweet.  The second time I did not put the brown sugar in the potatoes only on top and it tasted so much better.

Excellent, easy and fast - I added the marshmellows and pecans on the top and surrounded with the pecan crumb mixture.  Satifying all of the groups request for types of sweet potatoes.  Some are used to mellows and others nuts. 1st time that I made anything sweet potatoe - I was requested to make them again for Christmas.  I even ate them and I don't even like sweet potatoes.

Very good.  I had some Land o Lakes Cinnamon Butter and I used that.  It was a little too spicy so I might cut down a bit next time.  I also halved the sugar.

This is EXCELLENT... much healthier and a better consistency than the one I usually make.  Also, I like that the topping DOESN'T have nuts... great for people with allergies.  Thanks so much!

Exactly what I wanted it to be: rich, decadent, and NOT TOO SWEET!  I did the milk/eggnog substitution and have no regrets.  A real hit at the holiday table!!!

After first time making this today, this will become a Christmas standard. As noted by author, not dessert-like sweet!  Everyone loved this dish.  Changes we made: used 2.5 lbs of sweet potatoes, not 3 cups, left off topping, used skim milk instead of eggnog, added 1/2 tsp of maple syrup, 1/2 tsp rum flavoring, 1/2 tsp butter flavoring, used 1 whole egg instead of 2 egg whites. A food processor seems like a better device to mash potatoes/mix than using a blender.  Our blender struggled to mash/mix.

I took this dish to a friend's party and it was a big hit! The party was full of guests who are known for their amazing cooking skills. I on the other hand am not. So I think they were all quite surprised when after raving about it they realized that it was me who brought it. Thanks!

OMG, This was so delicious.
my hubby loved it.  I definitely will be making this again, the only thing different was I turned in the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes to make a little crusty too.

This was really good and has much less sugar than other casseroles I've seen but even so, I thought it was still too sweet. I would decrease the brown sugar in the crust next time and sub some of the eggnog and for milk like the cook suggested.

I made this to take to Thanksgiving dinner.  I have never made a sweet potato casserole.  I usually just roast my sweet potatoes with a little butter.  But the host requested a casserole.  I cut back just a little on the brown sugar that was mixed with the sweet potatoes, but other than that stayed with the recipe.  It was a hit!  Everyone enjoyed it.  Even the adults and kids that normally don't like this type of dish.  I think it was because it wasn't to sweet.  And it was simple, no added nuts or marshmallows.  They also commented that it had a great consistency.  Not runny.
