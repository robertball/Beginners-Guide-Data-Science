This is a perfect recipe and it makes great yogurt. Yes, I do make one little change in mine. I add 1 cup of dry milk powder, either whole milk powder or low fat milk powder. I've been using this addition over a year now and it always turns out so thick and delicious. I stir it in after I let the milk reduce to about 110 * And I set mine on a heating pad set on low and cover with towels.

This is the exact recipe my grandma and mom used, and it was always a huge hit.  Thanks for sharing.

Super simple and made great yogurt.  I did use a yogurt maker so that I didn't have to regulate the temperature for 12 hours.  Yogurt turned out super creamy and not too tart - just the way I like it.

I use ultra pasteurized shelf stable milk and never heat it.  I add the culture and wait for it to become yogurt.  If you leave it in a very warm spot it will turn to cheese.  Yogurt has been made for centuries without modern equipment.  You can get thermophilic cultures that require warmth or mesophilic cultures that work well at room temperature.  I often use Fage for a thermophilic culture.
