Good and disappeared quickly at office brunch.  Will make again.  My changes: Doubled recipe, added dried red/green bell peppers and onions (from Penzey's), increased garlic powder to ~1/2 tsp, used 19.5 oz. pkg sweet italian turkey sausage, and used reduced-fat cheddar.  Made casserole night before; let it sit out ~30 minutes next morning before cooking.  Took about 55 minutes to cook.  Recommend adding ingredients to saucepan rather than 13X9 pan--too messy.  Used non-stick spray on pan--came out easily and made clean-up quick.

I served this casserole for brunch and completed the menu for the meal by adding a fresh fruit salad, assorted muffins, coffee, and mimosas. EVERYONE  loved the casserole & begged for the recipe. Two changes that I made to the written instructions were that I mixed the egg/cheese mixture and the sausage with the grits before I transferred everything into the 9x13 baking dish and the second change I made was that I added 1 cup of cheese to the top of the casserole instead of the recommended 1/2 cup. Other than that, I followed the recipe as it was written. [NOTE: I would recommend that you use the packaged, shredded cheddar cheese rather than grating your own block cheddar. The packaged cheese is "drier" and doesn't have the excess cheese oil/grease; therefore, it doesn't add an unwelcomed layer of grease to the top of the casserole.] This is a WONDERFUL recipe that will now become a family tradition!!

This was very quick and easy to make and tasted very good. I'll probably try adding some onion and/or green pepper next time I make it.

I've not been a fan of grits, nearly my entire life. My sister made a recipe just like this one year for Christmas and I loved it, and was shocked it was loaded with grits...to my amazement, I have looked for similar recipes as the one she made and yet to find the exact one. This one was okay, slightly bland, but have more of a feeling it was the sausage and it was a bit soupy, not soupy running but like a soft yet thick pudding. If that makes sense. My sister's was a bit thicker and stood it's shape some. Possibly she used more eggs, but while this was simple, it was really nice, some tweaks are needed on our end with taste preferences. But again has a nice flavor.

Good basic recipe.  I changed a few things. First, I didn't have shredded cheese, so I mixed a can of cheddar cheese soup with the cooked grits and eggs befpre mixing in the sausage.  Second, I spread half a 7 oz. of diced green chiles over the mixture before baking.  Finally I served over baked buttermilk biscuits (which I baked at the same time).  Tasty, tasty and tasty!

This recipe is delicious! I had a ton of left over grits, so I did a google search on 'leftover grits' and dound this recipe. My family absolutely loved the casserole, and jokingly said this would be my new speciaty dish..lol. I made a few minor modifications to the recipe 1) instead of sausage, I used bacon and 2)instead of cheddar cheese I used 2% American cheese and topped the casserole off with cheddar cheese (to save calories). Thanks for the delicious dish!

We had lots of leftover grits so we found this recipe. We did not use as much sausage as it called for, because we were a little short. We followed the recipe, otherwise except for adding a can of chopped green chiles. It was pretty good except it needed salt and pepper.

Yummy!! I added some pepper and a lot more garlic salt, and then butter to the pot. I then stirred in the cheese, egg and sausage. I poured it into the baking dish, then refrigerated overnight. I placed it on the counter for about 45 minutes, then baked. Super easy and very yummy!

I use turkey sausage instead of the pork.  This casserole makes so munch sense I can't believe I didn't think of it myself.

This was ok but not as good as I expected. My guests politely ate it, but it was not a big hit. I'm not sure what is missing, but I think it could use a bit of tweaking somehow.

I do a lot of cooking and thought this sounded good but it was very bland tasting.  Ended up putting salsa on top to finish up the big dish of it.

I loved this recipe. Unfortunately my husband doesn't like grits. Oh well. I think it would be nice to add green and red peppers and maybe a little bit of sauted onion too.
