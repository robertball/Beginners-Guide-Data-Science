This is almost identical to another popular Blueberry Buckle recipe on this site that I have made for more than 40 years.  However, this recipe calls for butter rather than shortening, and a little more topping, and I wanted to try something different. While this is very good and still a 5-star recipe, I still prefer my old stand-by, the other Blueberry Buckle recipe.  I believe shortening does make for a more moist cake, and I prefer the lesser amount of topping. With either recipe, you can't go wrong--unless you overbake it! This is more like a muffin in texture and sweetness, so if you're looking for a dense, rich, super moist cake, this is not for you.  On the other hand, if you want an old-fashioned blueberry coffeecake, just right with a cup of cofee or tea, this is the ticket.

I was in heaven!  This is almost exactly like those huge muffins you can buy with the delicious crumble topping, only in a 9x9 pan.  It's a mega-muffin!  I hadn't ever made buckle, but it rises just like a cake and is the consistency and taste of a muffin.  I made it with fresh blueberries and didn't change a thing on the recipe.  Beware if you don't have a sweet tooth...my partner said this was so sweet that it made him want to eat a steak to balance out the sweetness.  It was perfect for me though!

WOW!!!  I have never made Blueberry Buckle before so I tried this recipe just to experiment with.  It was so amazingly good.  My family loved it!  Doubled the recipe, but didn't change a thing.  No need.  This recipe is perfect as is.

I love anything with Blueberries and this Buckle hit the spot in the middle of New England's cold winter. I made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. It was very good however I did enjoy adding a splash of vanilla, brown sugar for the crumb topping and a pinch more milk to the batter so it would not be as dense as the first time I made it. I did cook it for closer to an hour as well like others on the reviews had mentioned. Eating this the second day my husband heated it up in the microwave for 15 seconds with a pat of butter on it. It was warm and buttery and he loved it that way. My son adores this new recipe as well and put it in one of his favorite cakes category! He wants me to serve it for his Birthday for Breakfast!! We will be having this in our home this summer when we can pick fresh blueberries in the town we live in!

I baked mine in a 9" greased and floured springform pan.  The batter is really thick so I spread the batter with moistened hands.  Sadly, I found the cake to be to dry, I had such high hopes.  UPDATE: cake is more moist after 3rd day.

Beautifully simple! Finally a morning treat that calls back to a time when simple flavors were appreciated. I made the recipe exactly as called for and it's perfect just the way it is. Not too sweet with wonderful simplicity. Thanks for the great recipe!

I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 inch pan. Fantastic! I have to say it was even better the next day; even more moist end delish. I will make this again and again.

I thought this cake was excellent...moist and addicting!  I had some buttermilk so I substituted that for the milk.  I also doubled the recipe and put in a 9x13 pan....I kept the measurements for the topping the same and it was enough to cover the 9x13 with just enough sweetness.

Delicious and moist cake.  Will make again.  My mom would always make a syropy sauce with her blueberry buckle so I thought I'd share for those of you who likes sauces: 1 cup water 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla 1 tsp butter 1/4 cup of cornstarch in a bit of water (add this when the other ingredients are boiling) Let boil until sauce thickens.

so so good. it's 90 degrees here today and i would turn my oven on all over again for this recipe. i used store bought blueberries (pint box), and added a tspn of vanilla to the batter. didnt have too much trouble mixing it, or spreading it. I popped it in the oven before i started making the topping. for that, i used - 1/2 cup light brown sugar, 1/2 cup oats, 1/2 tspn cinnamon and 1/4 cup cold butter. this came out amazing. a scoop of vanilla ice cream would be a nice addition but def not necessary. i used a round 9 inch pan. and baked for an hour (i added the topping on about 15 mins into baking, so that baked for 45 mins).

This is possibly the best thing I have ever baked. I fell a little bit in love with myself last night. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect--the crunching topping with the cinnamon was an awesome addition. I will be serving this tonight at a dinner party with french vanilla ice cream. 
Note: if you use a glass baking dish, add about 10 minutes on to baking time.

made this for breakfast....I couldn't wait to taste it right out of the oven and it was kind of... blah. So I let it sit and cool a little - about 30-45 minutes - and OMG it was good. Still warm but not scorching hot. The topping is SOOOOOOOO good. I did sub a little brown sugar for some of the white - 1/4 cup brown and 1/2 cup white instead of the 3/4 cup white in the batter and 1/3 cup brown and 1/3 cup white in the topping. I also used frozen blueberries. The dough was VERY thick, not pourable at all - and adding the frozen blueberries made it even stiffer. I glopped it into the pan and kind of mooshed it down with wet fingers. The topping was a PITA to make w/ a fork so I dumped it in the food processor and ZIP ZIP it was done. Going to make this again, with all kinds of fruit! I can't wait for summer to make this with fresh Texas peaches.

We made this with frozen wild blueberries and it still worked great.  Went with half whole wheat flour, added a splash of vanilla and halved the topping.  Good stuff.

I cheated and used a box of white cake mix (and prepared according to the box) instead of making the cake itself. This may have defeated the purpose of a "buckle," which I guess is supposed to be a little less sweet, but I think that Jiffy cake mixes tend to be a little less sweet anyhow. Followed the crumb topping and blueberry ratios exactly and this turned out amazing!

This is a firm favourite with the whole family.  We can't always get blueberries in Spain so I tried it with raspberries and loquats and even without the fruit it was delicious every time.  We love it, thank you for posting.

***8/27/2011 UPDATE
I made it yet again.  It's a new family favorite.  But this time I didn't have enough blueberries.  So I decided to use 1 cup blueberries and 1 cup fresh peach.  I used a firm cling variety peach so it didn't fall apart with the skin on(don't be afraid of the skin, just wash the peach in cold water with the and lightly scrub with the scrubber side of a sponge). The results were fantastic.  I didn't use any more milk but because of the peach it was even more moist.***    



WOW!  I've never had a Blueberry Buckle before and was looking for something to do with my extra blueberries when I happened upon this recipe.  It's so yummy.  Almost like a big blueberry muffin, maybe a little more dense.  And the batter is REALLY thick.  I thought I did something wrong but, nope it came out great.  A big hit with my kids and friends.  The only change I made was I used 1/3 C. sugar and 1/3 C. Brown Sugar after the first time I made it.  I think it keeps it a little more moist and the topping is chewier.

First let me say this is Wonderful ! We love it,  Simple and soo delicious!
 Next- You do not "Pour" the batter into the pan! You fold it is about the best way I can say it...  It's very thick and that's ok, just be aware...
 Changes, I added a tsp of vanilla and split the topping, half white and half brown sugar. It turned out GREAT.  Also, if you have access to Huckleberries, use them, they are even better than the blueberries.

The cake portion of this buckle was delicious. Simple but fabulous with the fresh blueberries. However, I only gave it three stars because the crumb topping was way too much and entirely too sweet. If I make this again, I will use brown sugar in the topping, and cut it to 1/3 to 1/2 cup and add an extra 1/4c. of flour. I prefer a drier, mildly sweet crumb that doesn't detract from the cake below.

Wow! My first review! This was fabulous! My daughter request this for desert every night so far (until we will run out). Some modifications on my part: I increased the milk by about 4 tbsp., added 1 tsp of vanilla, and decreased the sugar to 2/3 c. For the topping, I did 1/4 c of white sugar and 1/4 c of brown sugar. I sprinkled the crumble layer with cinnamon instead of combining it before baking. Taste great warm topped with ice cream! A keeper! Thanks for sharing!

INcredible!! This is a gorgeous cake and is by far much tastier that I had imagined. Mind you, I did use fresh ripe blueberries and that surely made a difference. I followed the recipe to a T but added 1/3 cup sour cream to the wet mixture and cut the milk in half. This equalled a very moist and dense buckle!! I will make this again and again!!   Beware!! It makes much more than 4 servings!! I had to give some to the neighbors!!

This is a very good recipe.  For the fruit I used fresh strawberries and black raspberries and it was delicious!
Next time I will cut the topping ingredients in half which is plenty to cover the dish.  I will add this one to my favorites!

This is my first time making a blueberry buckle and honestly, this recipe is lacking something for me. I think first it could have used a hint of vanilla in the batter and the cake definitely needed to be more moist. The topping was spectacular. Moist, sweet, slightly crunchy at the same time but it wasn't enough to save the dryness and lack of sweetness in the cake. This is one I won't be making again but it was okay as a one time breakfast item.

The tastiest part of the buckle was the topping. I felt that the other parts were a bit bland. I would recommend adding more than 2 cups of blueberries for better taste.

That was pretty darned good. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla, sprinkled the batter with a little almond extract (after pouring it into the pan), and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brwon sugar for the topping.....yum

Just made this, INCREDIBLE!  I follow the recipe to a T, except I used a 8x8 pyrex dish, and had to cook it about an hour, not the 40-45 minutes recommended.

I love this recipe. A friend at my school recommended it. My family loved it! I recommend using only fresh blueberrys and adding a tad of lemon zest for an extra punch.I will definitely make this again!

I was a little disappointed by this recipe. The pictures that I saw were all beautiful. The final product was hardly worthy of my expectations. First off, the batter was very thick and unspreadable. I ended up spooning large globbs of it into the baking pan and attempting to smooth it down with a buttered rubber spatula. It still stick to the spatula.  Nonetheless, when it heated I was pleased to see that it spread nicely into the pan. Secondly and most importantly, the taste was lacking something that I have come to expect from recipes that receive high ratings from All Recipes cooks and bakers. There is something definatley missing from this recipe. It could use a little more cinnamon in the topping to add a bit of spice to it. However, even with that addition, I'm not sure I could get over the bland taste of the cake. I can't put my finger on it--especially because combinations of sugar, flour, butter, and blueberries have always seem failproof. I don't think I will make this recipe again.

This was good but I guess I didn't ever know what a buckle was.  I filed it under my Breakfast/Brunch category as it reminded me more of a coffeecake.  Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a super fast and easy dessert and I had all the ingredients for this.  I whipped it together in no time and everyone thought it was amazing!  Be careful to not overcook though, as it can become dry.  Would be great served with a scoop of ice cream or a big glass of cold milk. Also, I used frozen blueberries and they worked great.

Made almost exactly as stated in the recipe and it was scrumptious!  This is a new breakfast favorite.  My only changes are- I used frozen blueberries that I had frozen earlier this year, and used my mini processor for the topping.  Pulsed all the ingredients until crumbly.  Brought to work and got RAVE reviews.

This was great but i had to alter it- so thats why 4 stars. I used shortening instead of butter, added some vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. i mixed half the blueberries in with the mixer and folded the rest in (makes for a lovely purple color) I dont like blueberries (my mom loves them) but this was good-next time i will puree all of them then add to the batter(you wont get a big bite of blueberry but still good flavor) as for the topping: i use dark brown sugar instead of white(great flavor improvement) and add some oats, a few drops of vanilla, and some more cinnamon and nutmeg

Oh so yummy!  I made this with fresh, handpicked blueberries that I picked two days before and it was amazing.  It really did taste like fresh muffins that you would get from a bakery.  I did make it exactly as the recipe stated and I thought the topping was a little too much for my taste so next time I think I would use just half but it was amazing either way!

This is an awesome recipe.  Mine bakes for exactly 40 minutes at 350 and it comes out perfect.  It cuts like a "buttuh."  For the topping, I like to use 1/3 white and 1/3 brown sugar.   I now make this instead of muffins when I have extra fresh blueberries; it's so much better!  Moist and delicious!

Amazing... like a huge muffin
I doubled it and used a 9 by 13 inch pan. If you double it, don't double the butter on the topping. It was too much. I had to dab it with a paper towel. Also, you will will have to cook it longer.

I had never heard of a "buckle" before, but when looking for a "pastry-type" dessert to make came across this.  WOW!  I am a believer!  I actually made this exactly as written with only one change.  I used whole wheat flour instead of AP and it was fantastic!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Delicious!  Blueberries are great, but for a change of pace, try strawberries in place.  1 lb. strawberries and add 1 t. cinnamon to batter...everything else stays the same.  Also, if you bake in a 10" pie plate, the dish takes 40-45 min. and is super moist.  Thanks for sharing, Carol!

This is like a blueberry muffin cake. The bake time was way off, and even still some parts of it are mushy, but the taste is amazing! There are plenty of blueberries in every bite. 
I used frozen blueberries, and the batter was near impossible to mix, but the end result came out great.

What a simple, lovely recipe! I followed it nearly as written, with the change in the blueberries. I didn't have enough, so I made up the balance with fresh cranberries. I had to bake it in a skillet, and so the time went to 45 minutes. This treat didn't make it a full two days here~ Thanks for the recipe!

This is dry dense recipe; but, if you warm it a bit and add butter, it is delicious. My Hubby was very skeptical (not a blueberry fan) and he loved it. I also saw this recipe (or similar) made on tv; the girl sliced it and made french toast. Yummo! : )

This made an excellent coffee cake that was a great alternative to a morning muffin.  It was plenty moist using butter.  I used one whole pint of fresh blueberries that I had stored in the freezer.  This prevents the berries from breaking open and makes for a more attractive cake when you cut into it.

Delicious.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a roasting pan (10"x14") and baked for 55 minutes until the middle was set.  Also used a combination of white and brown sugar in the topping.  My family loved it.  Will definitely make it again.

This is a great recipe.I doubled the recipe and made them into muffins. I didn`t need to double the topping there was plenty. I may use muffin liners next time because the blueberries were quite sticky. I will make these again, great as a grab and go snack. If I make it as a dessert I could see me adding whip cream to serve. MMMMMMM

Probably one of the best Blueberry cakes I've ever eaten! Very moist and the topping makes this cake even better tasting. Made this for a party and everyone wanted the recipe. I didn't make any changes. This one's a keeper!

The topping melted into a very unappetizing mess of goo.  The buckle itself was decent but way too many blueberries.  We anly ate one peice each.

I just made this today and it's very good! It was a great way to use all the blueberries I just purchased. My family really enjoyed it and it was so simple.  Great w/coffee or tea.  I would suggest adding a bit more cinnamon than noted in the recipe.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla when I creamed the butter.  Delightful and simple.  Even with the modifications I made this is not overly sweet at all but very good.

Moist, chock full of blueberries and delicious!  I used white whole wheat flour and a blend of Splenda and sugar.  I needed to add more milk to give the batter the right texture.  It came out perfectly.  This is a winner!

I honestly had never heard of a Blueberry Buckle before, but I am glad I know now! It is a delicious cross between a muffin and coffee cake, full of fresh blueberries and a great crumbly top. Follwed this recipe to a "T." My only complaint is that the cake itself was not too packed with flavor, maybe I will add some vanilla or almond next time. And trust me, there will be an next time, soooo good!

I've now tried both bluberry buckle recipes on this site. They are both excellent. The one that uses shortening does turn out more moist, but I wouldn't call this one dry either. It was a really good texture, but I agree with others that it has more of a muffin texture than cake, so I tried making this as muffins instead. I think it's a great batter for muffins, not only do they turn out delicious, but they are less fattening than your typical muffin recipe. I got 12 jumbo muffins jam-packed with blueberries with a crunchy struesal topping. They were AWESOME.

This was amazing! It was SO yummy. I do have to say that I had to increase the cooking time for an additional 15-20 minutes. Next time I may add a little extra milk, as the batter was very thick when stirring. Otherwise, I followed directions exactly and it turned out perfect!! Thanks!

I made this recipe with frozen blueberries and about a 1/3 of a cup less sugar for the batter. I ate a piece almost hot out of the oven and thought it was pretty good. I read other reviews which said the cake was on the dry side and it was a little sweet. The cake was actually really moist, maybe that was due to the frozen blueberries. The cake was like a heavy dense blueberry cupcake. Anyhow, I took some over to my mother's house(she is approaching 80years of age, and her father was a baker)and she thought it was undercooked. I actually cooked a double recipe and cooked it for around 50 minutes; I did the toothpick test and it pulled out clean from the center of the pan. My sister-in-law didn't care for it and said she would have used powder sugar or drizzled on some frosting instead of the topping. I think that the topping is a bit sweet myself. My brother Joe said he thought the topping was too sweet but he ate three pieces without eating the topping. I will try it after it sits overnight and see if it tastes better tomorrow.

This recipe was great! I made it for my daughter's 4th birthday party. I asked her what kind of cake she wanted and she shouted, "Blueberry!" I was like, "Ok, a blueberry cake. Never heard of it, but I'm sure I'll be able to find something on Allrecipes." So I found this recipe and made it. It was a hit with all the guests. I had extra topping left over and topped each serving with whipped cream and sprinkled the sugar/butter mixture over top of it. That gave it a little more sweetness as this cake isn't overly sweet.

Seemed bland like it was missing something.  It was better warm with some butter on it.  Reminded me of coffee cake only with blueberries.  Not sure if some spices would help or maybe some extra vanilla...needs something though.

This came out just like the photo. I was afraid that the berries would all fall to the bottom, but they didn't.  The only thing missing from this recipe was add ice cream and enjoy.  Thank you, this will be one of my summer favorites.

I've tried this recipe before and everyone loved it, but this time I don't have enough blueberries. Can I add other berries or fruit like grapes instead?

This was delish! I used smart balance instead of butter and half whole wheat flour instead of regular to keep it healthier. Also used soy milk to keep it non-dairy. Will definitely make this again!

Made this while looking for recipes without sour cream or buttermilk. Absolutely one of my go to recipes now. So yummy especially warm out of the oven with a scoop of ice cream or fresh whipped topping. I made exactly as recipe calls but added a tbls more milk to batter. For those who do not think it is sweet enough, the crazy good topping is sweet enough to carry through to the cake. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!!!

Wonderful! This pleased a very tough critic with a sensitive palate. I did add a little extra salt to the batter as well as the crumble.

This is yummy, and very easy! I chose this recipe because I needed to use what I had on hand without the sour cream or buttermilk found in a lot of other recipes.
 I made this yesterday for a potluck and my husband and I only got a slice, so he asked me to make it again today! It's in the oven right now. The first one disappeared fast, so I think it's a keeper! I used fresh berries, 1 C strawberries and 1C blueberries because I didn't have 2C blueberries. Today, I'm using frozen blueberries only, so we'll see how that goes. 
I did make a couple minor changes--I added vanilla to the mix and some oats to the topping. This is a little on the dense side, (sorta like a giant muffin in cake form,) so I think it would be delicious with some ice cream, whipped cream, or even warm milk on top!

How could anybody NOT give this 5 stars? It is one of my top recipes now. What a delicious coffee cake. It was easy to make and turned out beautifully.  I used margarine in the cake and butter in the topping. It was perfectly moist. Thank you for this recipe. It's a keeper!

This is one of my new favorite desserts, great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  This is a perfect way to use up all those fresh blueberries from the backyard, I make it at least twice a year.  One tip:  be sure to use the topping as soon as it's crumbly, otherwise it turns to clumps and doesn't bake as well.

I just thought this was okay.  It tasted good but the texture left a little something to be desired.  It was more dry than what other reviewers have said.  The batter was also very, very thick and difficult to work with.  You couldn't just pour it in a dish to bake - it had to be spread out and it was a mess because the batter stuck to everything.  I didn't hate this but probably wouldn't make it again anytime soon either.

5 stars.  Added only one thing and it made it even more delicious. Heat up 1/2 jar of wild blueberry jam (NO SUGAR ADDED) microwave 1 minute only and add a little (or more)  warm over individual servings and add whip cream or good vanilla ice cream on top.  If using regular blueberries as I did, this little addition of the wild blueberry is awesome!  Try it you'll love it!

I have never made a blueberry buckle before but we just went blueberry picking and I was looking for new and exciting recipe and I came across this!  This is DELICIOUS!!! I did however change a few minor things upon reading some reviews.  First, I used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  I like baking with buttermilk, I don’t know how the recipe would have turn out with regular milk but this was very lush and moist.  I also added a dash or two of nutmeg and cinnamon into the batter itself and a teaspoon of vanilla for extra flavoring. One more change was I used 1/3 cup regular sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar for the topping. I had a minor issue with the topping; it wasn’t as crumbly as I saw in some of the pictures.  I think perhaps I used a little too much butter.  I also baked at 350 degrees for 1 hour.  This is a recipe that I will DEFINITELY use again! Thanks for sharing :o)

I doubled the recipe to 8 but I believe there was enough for 16 so I brought half to work and my work mates inhaled it today. This recipe came out wonderfully!! It was like those caky blueberry muffins with the crumble muffin tops.  oh so yummy. The only down side is that  I'm afraid that each serving must have over 500 calories with all the butter and sugar but what a wonderful treat and great way to use up the blueberries off of my back yard blueberry bush. Thanks for this recipe.

This is excellent! I need to double it next time, my family devoured it. I always use smart balance in place of butter and it worked just fine. Otherwise made it exactly as written with our fresh blueberries.

Very great recipe! I didn't have any blueberries, I had some raspberries I needed to use up. And they worked wonderfully. I never heard of blueberry buckle before, but it sure is tasty with raspberries :)

I used half whole wheat pastry flour and half unbleached white flour to give it a little fiber. I also used organic sugar instead of white sugar and reduced the amount of topping. Still yummy!

Excellent.  I doubled the recipe and substituted 1/3 cup of the sugar and used 1/3 cup brown sugar.  My neighbor absolutely loved this.

Fantastic!  Made exactly as written.  Cant't see any reason to change someone's grandmother's recipe on the first try making it.  I will make it again for sure--thanks so much for sharing it.

OMG!  Fabulous recipe!!!  I recently went blueberry picking and had 6 pounds of berries...so when i went to a july 4th picnic this was a great choice.  My friends went crazy over it!! Heat it up then throw a scoop of vanilla icecream and the wow factor goes waaay up!  I will make this again and again!!!  It has already been requested for the next bbq!!!  :)
ps. i added an extra cup or so of blueberries too!

Delicious and easy to make!  This is a perfect summer recipe when blueberries are fresh from the market or after picking your own.  I would reinforce the necessity of using COLD butter when making the crumb topping so that you can get the right consistency when cutting the butter in - maybe even use butter from the freezer!  I have saved in my recipe box to make again for sure!

Really yummy.. My daughter and her friend made this yesterday, doubled the recipe in a 9 x 13 and followed some of the other reviewers with splitting the sugar with brown sugar,also added more milk because it was really thick, and added more blueberries.. took almost an hour but turned out perfect, moist and delicious.. will make again for sure!

lovely dessert!.  Good down home flavor.  Yes, it is sweet but if you are going to have dessert, do it!Why would anyone want to spoil a good dessert by making it healthy?!  LOL I used frozen blueberries-tossed with 1 Tbsp/ of flour first.

I changed it up a little, but found the results to be perfect!!  Used shortening instead of butter, upped the milk to about 3/4 cup, added a touch of vanilla and cinnamon to the batter, and split the topping sugar to 1/3 cup granulated sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar. AMAZING!  Oh yeah, most important part- by accident I cooked at 350 instead of 375, but it was perfect!  I could tell if I did cook at 375 then the result would have been a tough buckle!  :)

Happy to find this recipe. As a kid growing up in PA we made this with raspberries which grow wild in the woods. Here we call it pudding. Can't tell you why, but it may have something to do woth how we serve it, warm with milk & sugar. Cherries also work well. Hint,: if your berries settle to the bottom dust them with flour first.

This recipe is awesome!  I doubled it and baked in 10x15 pan - only change I made was to add more blueberries - have already passed it on to friends who have tried it and they agree that it is awesome

What an awesome recipe! My whole family absolutly loved this and forced down seconds bc it was too good. Then we ate I again for breakfast the next morning! The only thing I did differently was I used a small bag of frozen blueberries that I let thaw over night. The batter was very very thick and wheni folded the blueberries in at the end the batter turned purple so I thought I would end up with a purple cake. But it came out normal so no big deal. Also I. Mixed the strusel topping by hand and thought that there was too much dry ingredients and not enough butter but it turned out so perfect. Finally, I baked mine in a 9 inch round cake pan instead of a square. This is such a delicious cake and I can't wait to make it again!

Amazing...this was superb....I baked on 375 for 38 mins in a glass dish....crumble topping was perfect, nice texture. I didn't think it was too sweet and I like the density of the cake too...I have to agree it is similar to that of a muffin...great with coffee. btw I only had 1 1/4 cup of blueberries, I went for it anyways and there were enough to go around through the cake.

I doubled this recipe, maybe that's where I went wrong? This turned out awful! The middle sunk in and was doughy and the outside was breaddy and dry. I won't be making this again. I am going to try the recipe for blueberry cobbler instead. I am trying to use up a bunch of blueberries.

This was delicious. I made it exactly as written, with the exception of using frozen blueberries. I couldn't stop eating it. I made it for a dessert, but I think it would be even better as a brunch/coffee cake.

Made this for the custodial men who worked hard to shovel, plow, and blow snow out of the complex where I live owing to the Blizzard of February 1, 2011.

I am jealous they will taste this but I am so pleased at the look of the finished product. Wonderful. I am also pleased I had blueberries in the freezer, fresh from Michigan, August 2010. The fellas will like it very much. 

So, I was able to work with the ingredients I had in my cupboards and from the fridge. BONUS!

Easy and delicious!  Fresh blueberries washed, dried, and frozen for this cake later in the year works great.  If you are a cinnamon freak like me, double the amount for the topping.

Wonderful recipe! I did take the advice of previous reviewers and added more milk and vanilla to the batter. Also, I added some brown sugar to the topping.

This is so good. Very easy to make too. I didn't change a thing in the recipe. I made it for dessert tonight, but it will be perfect for breakfast tomorrow!

I just finished baking this recipe as muffins and it turned out really good. The cake is really light and fluffy and bursts with the fresh blueberries. Baked as a cake I can see how this would be wonderful - as a muffin, I think I'll tweak it next time... I'll omit the crumble on top as it just sticks to my muffin pan and makes them harder to get out, plus I'd add cinammon to the batter and probably some lemon zest - I'm guessing that will make this recipe into outstanding muffins! In making this recipe this time, I warmed my (soy) milk before adding (a 'trick' from another recipe) and they turned out fluffy and moist and light... perfect!

Delicious. We served it with blueberry sauce (from this site) and whipped cream. *Note-it did take a little longer than 45 minutes to cook so I suggest keeping an eye on it for up to one hour.

This was fantastic!  I even had to swap out the butter for a dairy/soy free substitute and used water instead of milk (due to a dairy/soy allergy of someone who was at the event) and everyone still agreed it was great.  I cannot wait to make it using butter and milk -- I'm sure it will be even better (though I'm not sure that's possible).

My family loved this! I used brown sugar instead of white sugar for the topping and buttermilk instead of regular milk (only because of personal preference). It was phenomenal! I baked it in an 8inch glass square pan, and it took exactly 45 minutes. Can't wait to make this again.

I made this and another very similar buckle that used Crisco. I read a few reviews debating which version was better. I made both on the 4th of July and let my family vote. It was almost unanimous. They liked both but the buttery one was the bigger hit. I actually thought as a cake it turned out lighter than the other version which kind of surprised me. I used all fresh picked berries which I think made it better!  Thanks for the recipe and the family loved the 'competition'!

Great buckle! Nice and light, but chock full of berry goodness! It is very sweet though, next time I make it I will cut the sugar in the batter down to half a cup (maybe less) and add in some lemon zest.  The batter itself is VERY thick when you make it, hard to fold in the berries but be gentle and patient. You have to spread it out in the pan (I lined mine with non-stick foil). I will use brown sugar next time in the topping.  the other highly rated buckle recipe is a heavier denser cake, this one is lighter. I like both equally :)

This was a most excellent treat with just a few changes.  I would suggest adding vanilla.  For the topping we felt that half or maybe a touch more, was plenty of extra sweetness.  Too, in the topping, we subbed brown sugar and added about 1/3 cup of oatmeal.  Everyone loves it and we will be making it up over the weekend with fresh peaches.  Thanks for the submission!

Update: I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9 x 13 glass pan. It was a little too much. It made a taller version of the cake with a lot of topping. I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar in the topping because I like the flavor of brown sugar. 

 I followed the recipe exactly, even though I wanted to add vanilla, i didn't. It came out great! Everyone loved it.

This is a winner.  Blueberries are really cheap right now.  I was told about "buckle" by a lady co-worker.  This one is SOOO good.  Unlike most people, I like it cold in the fridge!

THIS RECIPIE WAS DELISH. I made a double batch and made some muffins alongside the cake. It was a little heavy on the blueberries, and a little sour because of that. (But i was also using the most fricking gigantic blueberries your eyes will ever see). No problem though, i'll just add some more sugar next time. The texture was great, it was super easy (nailed it on the first try), I thought it was perfect. Tasted like I bought it in a bakery. The crumbly topping was by far the greatest advent of this century, and  this one is simple and sweet and to die for. Pile it on, ladies. (or gents.)  :)

OMG, I made this with half raspberries and half blueberries.   I added 1/4 cup of milk based on the other reviews.  Definitely the thing to do otherwise you can't fold the berries into the batter without crushing them.   It baked for 55 minutes and came out perfect.

This tastes like a blueberry muffin, an amazing blueberry muffin! I baked mine in a pie pan only because it was convienant and it cooked through well. I used frozen blueberries and bread flour (only bc I was out of all purpose) YUM. will make again! Note: it took about 40 min to bake at 350

This was very good, and this tasted very similar to the homemade blueberry muffins that I make.  I ran out of regular flour after I made the batter, so I used wheat flour in the crumb topping and it turned out great!  This is 100% better than another Blueberry Buckle recipe that I tried from this site.

This was great.  I made 2 with freshly picked blueberries.  One used 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar.  The other was all splenda.  My small group loved it!  Since I was a little over-zealous with blueberry picking I'll be using this recipe again.  Hubby requested it for Christmas morning!

Used half brown sugar and half white for the topping. Served it with caramel ice cream and coffee. It was a hit! FYI, I used a pint of blueberries, which is just a little more than 2 cups.

Oh my gosh this was fantastic. I was hoping to find a "decent" blueberry coffee cake reciepe. But this buckle was so much better than I thought it would be. I will definitely be making this one again and again. 

I wonder if it can be used with other types of fresh fruit?  (I am daydreaming that chopped fresh peaches would be nice.)

Absolutely delicious blueberry cake!  Scrumptious last night while warm from the oven, and still moist and delicious today.  (Not exactly sure about the reviewers who said it was dry for a couple of days after making it; I stored it in the fridge in an airtight container.)  Like other reviewers, don't worry if the batter seems stiff--it will turn out just great.  Can't wait to have for breakfast tomorrow!

This was good.  I doubled it for a function at work and baked in a 9x13 pan.  I doubled the topping too and was glad I did.  People said it tasted like the jumbo blueberry muffins you get at the bakery.  I used fresh blueberries too, and I think it mad a difference.

This reminds me of the blueberry muffins my grandmother used to make when I was a child - very tasty, a great coffeecake to serve either for breakfast or dessert.  Don't let the thick batter throw you, it's supposed to have that consistency.

This recipe is great!  I made it last night and brought it to work and most of it is gone already.  I did not have enough plain flour, so I used King Arthur's Whole Wheat, all except 1/2c. in the recipe and it was still fantastic.  I also used brown sugar for the topping.  This recipe is a keeper!!

This was excellent.  I made this with some frozen blueberries I had in the freezer (thawed, of course) this was especially a big hit with my husband.

Yum! This recipe is so easy to prepare. I reduced the amount of sugar in the cake part and used half brown sugar half white in the topping. Had a hard time getting the crumb to come together so I added 2 more Tbsp of butter and that worked. The only substitution I made was to use rice milk instead of regular milk due to a whey allergy. Since I used an 8x8 pan I needed to bake it longer, about an hour. The result is light and delicious..a bit crumbly and messy to eat but so worth it. I will definitely make this again especially since the recipe uses ingredients I already had at home. Thanks for sharing it!

These were great! Instead of placing the batter in an 8x8 pan, I put it in 4 ramekin dishes. I topped each off with a scoop of ice cream and everyone thouroughly enjoyed them! It was just like eating a big, warm blueberry muffin! I used the Kitchen aid mixer to 'cut' the butter in which saved tons of time and effort.

Honestly, even after reading all the reviews the thickness of the batter still scared me but it turned out fantastic - it really does taste like a giant blueberry muffin (LOVE the topping!).  Used fresh blueberries and followed recipe exactly, definitely a keeper!

This turned out quite well for me and I only made 2 changes, I used splenda instead of sugar and I added 1/4 cup more milk. The batter was supper thick and all the flour was not mixing in without it. Next time I make it I think I'll try adding a little lemon juice also. I only wish I had wild minnesota blueberries rather than the ones from the grocery store :(
Also, I got 8 servings from this, the pieces were plenty big along with the vanilla icecream.

This was very muffin-like. It was good - much like a coffee cake. In the topping, I used half flour, half oats, and only used 1/4 cup butter. By the way, this made SO MUCH topping. Next time I'll probably halve it.

I LOVED this recipe. It is so good. I doubled it and it made enough so we had left-overs. LOVED IT! you must try it. Even for people who arent't a big fan of blueberries (me) will love it. I have made this atleast like three times now and i've only had the recipe for a month! This is delicous you have to try it if you haven't already then you are missing out.

The prep time was a bit longer than anticipated.  I think next time I will try to find a way to make it taste a bit more like blueberry.  I tasted more of the batter than the bluberry.  All in all I was generally very pleased and it was a hit with my mom, son and my uncle.

This was a yummy treat! I had made one the week before from one of my Mom's old cookbooks and it ws better though.  The top layer of this version took quite  a bit longer to cook in my over and there were still gooey spots.  I prefer not adding the blueberries to the dough mixture, but adding them as the middle layer.  I also used coconut oil (similar to the consistency of butter) to my topping which adds a delicious spin on the flavor.

I made it exactly according to recipe, and we loved it! I tried it a few days later with strawberries, but didn't like it as well. Apparently my husband felt the same because he brought blueberries home today and asked for another. Thank you for this recpe!

OK, from everyone elses review, I give it 5 stars, the Blueberry Buckle is however in the oven right now! I'll come back after dinner and dessert and give you my final review.  It is very easy to make. I have to double the recipie at my house, (because I just know better with hubbie and teen's) so I just whipped it up in my mixer. I did however add a little more milk because I was afraid it was so stiff it would crush the berries while folding in.  Ok,  I'll be back yall'.

The only change I made was to cut back to 1/c c sugar. The topping is quite sweet, I would cut back the sugar on that next time..maybe 1/2 c.  Other than the sweetness (which no one complained about but me) it was great.  I could easily get 9 good portions out of a square pan though.

This recipe was super simple...I doubled the recipe because I didn't think the smaller one would be enough for the people I was feeding.  I got great reviews on it...everyone loved it and it was gone in no time.  I will definitely make this again.

I followed this recipe exactly as written. With the exception of using half and half instead of mix. 
The batter came out super stiff. So much so, I could barely fold in my blueberries. I ended up adding an extra 1/3cup of half and half and used my hands to fold the batter. Using the extra half and half (or mix, if you so choose) will help moisten the batter. The outcome was positive. A moist but heavy blueberry buckle. Great simple flavors, and the topping is too die for. It's almost like a giant muffin- but better. YUM!

I was only making this because I wanted a quick treat for my kids and didn't want to deal with muffins. I can't believe how delicious it is! And it serves WAY more than four! Baked for much longer also. But my kids all agreed that the wait was worth it!

My parents grow blueberries, so each season I have more than I know what to do with! I tried this recipe to vary from our usual cobbler and pie. Wow! I followed it exactly as written and it was wonderful! I will add it to our summer line-up.

This has been a family favorite since I was a girl in Michigan and we spent summer mornings picking as many blueberries as we ate! It's great with vanilla ice cream for dessert or with your morning coffee.

This recipe is simple and fast to make. However, I recommend adding a little bit more milk because the batter is thick. Plus it takes longer than 45 minutes in the oven. Next time I make this, I think that I will add more sugar and vanilla.

I added a lot more milk to make the batter thinner--maybe almost a full cup. It turned out wonderfully!

Uh-Mazing!  I make this often when blueberries are in season!  I've added zest to the batter as well for that extra zing...lemon or orange works well.  Love it!!!

Oh my gosh!, you have no idea how glad I am that I found this recipe. I got this recipe ten years ago, or a recipe very similar to this. I loved it so much, that I baked it all the time. Well over the years and the many trips of moving from place to place, I must have lost it. Well my English professor told me about this website and helped me find this recipe. I went home, baked it, and fell in love; all over agian. Except this time, it was even better. A lot better than I remember. I gave a peice to my professor and both of my sister in laws. We will just say, they fell in love too. lol

Great recipe but I added a little more milk (1/8 cup) because I found the batter quite heavy...other than that it looks and tastes fantastic!

This was AWESOME!!! I didn't have a 9 x 9 pan, so put it in an 8 x 10 and left it in a little bit longer. I passed on the recipe to several people who also said it was fantastic!

My first draw to this recipe was the name of it... Blueberry Buckle... so much fun to say. And even more fun to eat!! WOW! This was THE BEST! I used blueberrries I had frozen, then thawed and they were still a little frozen when I mixed them in. This worked out well because the berries were still in tact for the most part within the cake after it was cooked, not mushy... SOOO delish! The cake was moist, the topping was crunchy, and everyone loved it. Thanks so much for the recipe... its' gonna be one of my faves now!

HUGE hit with my friends!!  I only had an 8x8 pan, so used that and had enough left over for 3 muffins.  I was a little concerned when the directions said to "pour" the ingredients into the pan b/c mine was much thicker than that, but it was delicious.   Only thing I changed about the recipe is that I used 1/3 white sugar and 1/3 brown sugar for the topping.   Will DEFINITELY make again!

I made this as a dessert for a picnic last night and everyone loved it. I served with vanilla bean ice cream and drizzled a sweet sauce over it from another reviewer (1 cup water, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. butter and 1/4 cup cornstarch in a bit of water added when the other ingredients are boiling.) It was yummy.   Just a note: I was a little worried how it would turn out when I was preparing it, since the batter was really sticky and didn't really "pour" into the cake pan -- Thought I accidentally added too much flour. Guess I was wrong because it turned out great! Thanks for sharing, Carol! :)

This was easy to make and it tastes good, but it seems more like a coffee cake than a buckle.  I'm going to try it with my tart cherries because I think it will be good.

Delicious! Great as a breakfast item, coffee/teatime cake, dessert, whatever. Perfectly proportioned ingredients. So simple, chock full of blueberries, and you get to call it a "buckle"--how much fun is that??

The taste of this was delicious. I thought that all the topping would be too much but I really enjoyed all the crunchy sweetness on top.  BUT the only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that it's very dry and crumbly. Still awesome but I would have preferred a moister cake. Perhaps I'll try oil next time instead of butter.

Wow, this was delicious!!! I would give it 6 stars if i could. Very blueberry and very moist. Loved the topping on top. I made it a couple weeks ago and my husband requested it again tonight. We went to local blueberry farm to get fresh blueberries so i'm sure that helped.

Just made this today for the heck of it.  I had extra blueberries and wasn't sure what to do with them.  It was a big hit in our house.  I will be making this for years to come!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The batter is stiff but the cake was very moist.

This was great!  My only change would be to cut the topping by half -- it was a little too much.

I love this cake!  I did tweak it a bit by using 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 white whole wheat flour.  I also added a teaspoon of lemon extract and the zest of one lemon.  I added some grated nutmeg to the topping mixture.  It is moist and dense and delicious!

Seriously a great go to recipe. I have made this one and tonight I am making it again after my husband has begged for it. My 2yr old daughter can eat a big piece no prob. I used a 9" spring form pan and had to bake a bit longer to bake through, came out so fluffy and and just perfect. The next day it is still so so yummy.

Excellent...easy to make and delicious! The batter is thick when you make it, but turns out like a large muffin cake-and the topping makes it a perfect dessert-sweet! My kids also loved it!

WOW! We loved this!  A perfect mix between a cake and a muffin.  We only used a half a cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet. Note that you won't be "pouring" this into a pan, you will be "spreading" it, as the batter is thick.  Also, we omitted the crumb topping and did the blueberry sauce from allrecipes instead, turned out amazing. A true keeper.  Thanks Carol!

I got scared while making this because the batter was so stiff and didn't even spread across the cake pan.  I added in an extra splash of milk and a bit of vanilla but it worked out wonderfully!  I did however make half the amount of topping and it was much better, didn't need all that sugar.    Great Buckle though my family loved it.  It was half gone by the time the day was over!

I made this for work and everyone raved about it.  One of my bosses called it "Crack Buckle" because it was so addictive! I added more milk to the batter and a dash of vanilla as well.  I think next time I'll add some lemon juice and zest to jazz it up.

Simply WOW!!! Easy recipe with fantastic results.  I followed the recipe exactly, and my husband couldn't get enough.  Warm with some vanilla ice cream made for an incredible dessert; just by itself is going to be breakfast.    Thank you for sharing your grandmother's recipe -- it's definitely going into my rotation.

Yummy stuff!  I added lemon zest to the batter, and some to the topping instead of cinnamon.  The batter seemed thick but baked up perfectly.  Yummy and moist.  I also made a glaze from lemon juice and icing sugar and poured it on top of the crumble after it came out of the oven for a special touch!  Great recipe!

Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe. My picky 8 year-old gave it 2 thumbs and 2 big toes up! The only change I made was to reduce the cooking time to 35 minutes.  It made a very moist dense crumb.  This recipe is a keeper!

Super yummy! I didn't find it too sweet at all. The only thing I changed was to subtract a couple tablespoons of flour more to make the mixing easier and avoid too heavy of a texture. It turned out perfectly! Even at high altitude with no other special adjustments. Definitely going to make this one again!

I made this buckle exactly as the recipe recommends and used fresh Wisconsin blueberries from my local farmer's market.  I brought it into work and my co-workers loved it!  My fiancé thought it wasn't sweet enough though.    So I guess that my final recommendation is that if you love blueberries and don't want a baked good that is overly sweet, then this is definitely the recipe for you!

This really was good.  Simple ingredients, not too sweet, but just sweet enough it was a real treat.  We put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top when it was fresh out of the oven...heavenly!

Really good... not too sweet, could make yummy muffins, I put a little in a small loaf pan and took it warm from the oven to my neighbors... they loved it! Would be great warm with Ice Cream or heated up with some butter on it  YUM!!

Very good!  Even my non-blueberry eating son liked it!  I used half whole wheat flour, half all purpose flour in both the cake and topping.  About half of the blueberries sank to the bottom , but that still left still plenty in the body of the cake.  As my blueberries were tart, I used the amount of sugar the recipe called for, and it was just right.

Very tasty cake! I made a few changes to make it more healthy (as we are still recovering from all of the guilty holiday treats!) I used white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and unsweetened applesauce instead of butter in the cake (I still used the butter in the topping though.) Also, I used brown sugar in the topping. I had a lot of frozen blueberries from our overzealous picking this summer that I was looking to use up and this recipe hit the spot! Thanks!

THIS WAS SIMPLY AWESOME!! I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used frozen organic blueberries,they worked out very well. I also baked in a deep dish pie plate and although it took a little longer it turned out perfect. I took this to a friends house for dinner and it was a big hit! Definately a keeper to add to my collection. Thanks for submitting this recipe :)

Yum! This recipe was really good. I was concerned when I was making the batter that it was too thick, so I added a little more milk to the mix. I also found that the amount that the recipe makes for the topping was way too much, I ended up only needing about 1/4 of it. Other than that, no problems!

This was amazing, I did make some changes.  For the topping I did 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar and added a little more cinnamon.  My Family loved it.
