We made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit.  We should have gotten enough for two batches, it was gone in a flash. Delicious!

Made this punch without alcohol for teenage daughters Christmas party. It was a big hit!  My only regret is that I did not double the recipe.

Was delicious, but did not look as pretty as the picture! Lol received many compliments all around and I had it in a pretty juice jar with frozen cranberries, orange & lemon slices and cinnamon sticks floating inside. Also used cran & orange juice to make ice cubes the night before so it didnâ€™t get watered down.

Excellent holiday punch. The spice added a festive complexity to the flavor and cut then sweetness. We didn't use alcohol for the kids.  Just be aware you will go through a lot so we doubled the recipe and not a lick was left.
