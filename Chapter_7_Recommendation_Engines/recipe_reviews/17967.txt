wow this was fantastic!! i cut down on the spices by half (for the kids) and baked it in a pyrex pan. Place pan in the oven with butter to warm and melt(not to long though, don't want the butter to burn) pulled the dish out spread the butter around hot pan, poured in batter and baked. Quick, easy, delicious!!

This was soooo good.  Of course, I had to play around a little, and melted butter in the skillet instead of cooking spray.  Also added a half can of creamed corn and cut back a little on the milk to compensate.  Everyone loved it.

This turned out great. I didn't have cayenne pepper so instead I used ancho and chipotle pepper. For the hot pepper sauce I used about two teaspoons tabasco sauce and five teaspoons of a green chile salsa. This recipe would be great served with chili.

This cornbread is delicious and not as spicy as I thought it would be.  It is very light and turns a golden brown.  This will be my cornbread recipe from here on out.

Great cornbread. I used powdered sugar. Not too hot or mild, just right! Gone in a flash. Thank you.

This was a big hit at my house and the texture is wonderful! However I found it a little too spicy for myself and small children. Next time I'm going to cut back on the cayenne pepper. This will be the recipe I use to go with my stew!!

mine was a little dry but had a good flavor.  i think i'd use a loaf pan the next time to help retain moisture.

I LOVE this recipe. I've made it as a loaf and as muffins and they both turn out delicious. So good with soup or chili, or warmed up with a little butter!

One of my new favorites!  I love the way this cornbread tastes.  It has a subtle spicy finish.  I use Louisiana hot sauce, not Tabasco, and that affects the heat alot.

This is wonderful!!! I've never cared for cornbread, then I tried this recipe. I made smoked pork and beans in the crock pot and my husband likes cornbread. I wanted try something different. Oh my goodness it is delicious. I used butter instead of shortening because it's all I had on hand. Highly recommended!

I added corn, cheddar cheese, & chili flakes, & substituted margarine (3/4 C so it wouldn't be dry) for shortening.  Very tasty & not too spicy.

Made this for a dinner party the other night and it was definitely a hit!  The texture is nice and light and I guess it's because of the 4-12 tsps. of baking powder.  The hubby really, really liked it!

Good recipe. The only thing I changed was 1 1/2 cups white flour, 1/2 cup corn flour and 1 cup corn meal.

Very good!  I cut the cayenne in half, and used El Tapatio hot sauce in the quantity the recipe called for.  It was too spicy for my husband, but the others at the group dinner ate it up.  Next time, i'd probably cut the hot sauce back about a tsp.  Loved the texture...light and fluffy without crumbling all over.

Wow, it was a bit too spicy for me! But really tasty, my husband particularly liked it because of the spiciness. I might add more shortening next time. There's no reason to beat the eggs before you add them to the milk either. You're just going to beat them again after you add them. No point wasting an extra bowl! Thanks, this was a great way to use up those extra egg yolks I had from holiday cooking!

I didn't have Tabasco sauce, so I left it out. I also didn't have a cast-iron skillet, so I used a foil lined 13x9. I did everything else just like the recipe. My hubby said next time to leave the cayenne out b/c it was too spicy for us (and my 19 month old son). Otherwise, its a great cornbread!

This was good. I decreased the cayenne pepper as I was making this for children. I am not sure what is 'Irish' about it, though. It is good with a pot of chicken and dumplings on a cool, autumn day.

Moist and flavorful.  I usually burn cornbread when I try to fix it in an iron skillet but this was perfect.  My cornbread hating husband even liked it deeming it "non gritty".  I will happily fix this again!

My family went crazy over this recipe!! I followed instructions to a T, excepting that I put my skillet in the preheated oven right before I mixed in the wet ingredients (cast iron heats up fastl at 400!), and then I checked it at 20 minutes b/c I didn't want it to burn (you can always put it in longer). As far as taste goes, it has the faint traditional sweetness of regular cornbread, but the main thing you taste is this amazing zingy spiciness, which isn't really spicy... It's just a lot if flavorful slight heat, and it complements homemade chili PERFECTLY, which is what we had it with. This recipe is SUPER simple, delicious, and it's just a fun spin a great classic :)

This is absolutely the very best cornbread I have ever made!! It was light and fluffy, slightly sweet and spicey. I won't use another recipe again. I'm in love

The consistency and taste is spot-on (and it looks perfectly golden brown too)! I would only recommend upping the hot pepper ingredients- I followed the recipe's measurements exactly and, while everything else was AWESOME, there was ZERO spice to it! Not even a tiny bit! :( But definitely using the recipe forevermore- it's very easy and fast to prep and bake. I didn't do the skillet thing, but just buttered an 8x10 baking pan. I served it with rice and beans and put some honey on it.

Yum!  Turned out very moist and had a lovely creamy mouthfeel, and by using sriracha chili sauce and 1/3 of the cayenne called for it had the perfect amount of heat for my mother and I.  I also halved the recipe and baked it in a six-inch cast-iron skillet.  Perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly except for using butter in place of shortening.  This bread was quick and easy to assemble.  The only thing I would change next time would be to add chopped jalapeño peppers to the batter.  The cornbread flavor and texture was fantastic.  And the taste was soooo delicious.  I served it with quinoa and black bean chili on a Friday in Lent.  Everyone was happy!

This was good.  Reduced the cayenne to 1 tsp. and left out the hot pepper sauce (personal preference).  Would make again.

Made this to go with my pot of red beans and this cornbread is soooo good!!! Only thing I added was some cream corn to the batter and baked it and turned out great.

I added a cup of corn kernels and some sliced and fried hot dog pieces, I used Sriracha sauce for the hot sauce, and I used polenta in the place of corn meal, as it is hard to find corn meal in Finland.  Very yummy. :)

Texture of this was nice, but next time I will probably at least double the seasonings and maybe add pieces of Jalapeño peppers--I could hardly taste the spice in this bread.

Excellent cornbread. My father is from the south and taught me how to make cornbread - always in a cast iron pan. Makes all the difference. The spiciness is perfect for my family's taste.  Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe was awesome!  I added a little more cayenne & hot sauce then called for because we love spicy things.  Will definitely make this again.

I cooked this a little longer than suggested and it was great. I don't think it was too spicy at all, just a little taste of spice lingers on your tongue after every bite, just right THX!

I thought this was a good recipe, however, too much cayenne.  I enjoy spicy food, but I think the cayenne over took the recipe.  I will try again and reduce the cayenne to 1/2 tsp.

I would have given this 5 stars except all I could taste was the "tabasco" flavor. It wasn't that it was too spicy it just had that unmistakeable flavor. The consistency of the cornbread was amazing and it was really fun to make. I will be making this often, but perhaps with less tabasco and more cayenne. Overall this is a keeper!

I will make this again - I forgot to add the hot pepper sauce and I'm sure we'll enjoy the addition of it- I also halved the recipe and served it with the Apricot Lentil Soup for dinner last night.  Thanks for sharing.
