Easy and delicious - just what I was looking for tonight for a quick supper.  Instead of reduced sodium I used reduced fat cheddar cheese.  I opted not to use the vinaigrette in this recipe, but used "Smoked Paprika Vinaigrette" from this site as I had some already made from a previous night and that stuff is oh so good.

I made this without the chipotle and vinegar (reason for the 4 stars instead of 5). Used jelapeno ranch instead. Served with garlic toast. Very good and will make again.

A great salad for using up leftover flank steak.  We liked the ingredients, but even with the pureed chipotle chiles, the dressing lacked enough flavor.  Once increasing the vinegar, a little, that did the trick.  Served this with 'Fried Cabbage' from AR.

This was good!!  I did add a couple things to this salad just because I had them in the fridge to use.  I added radishes, cucumber and some chopped charred poblano's that I had grilled along with the steaks.  Used some heirloom yellow tomatoes from my garden as well.  The dressing is yummy, but I think I will double the dressing next time (the chipotle is a must!), it was barely enough for 2 of us.  Thanks!!

We enjoyed this salad! It was easy to prepare using readily available ingredients. I would suggest adding more pepper and garlic to The steak ahead of time, also salt. The Adobe sauce with chilies,  I think itâ€™s mandatory!. It totally changes the taste and I really liked it.

I'd make it with a different steak, I used Skirt steak, and actually marinated it ahead of time.

This was such a great salad.  I have to thank one of the reviewers, Jillian, for mentioning that she used the Smoked Paprika Vinaigrette on the salad that is from this site.  Well, I did the same thing - that vinaigrette is just fabulous.  I'm sure the chipotle dressing is good too.  Really a great and fast dinner.  Thanks for this recipe!
