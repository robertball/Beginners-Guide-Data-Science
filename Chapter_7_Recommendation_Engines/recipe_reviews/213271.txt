I've made this recipe for years and always a favorite when serving hot snacks however, I've made a few changes. We like our kraut dishes a little more tangy and less sweet so I only used 4 apples that I shred instead of slice and about 1/3 cup brown sugar. I also use the larger jar of kraut and I like to rinse it and then add a tablespoon of olive oil and a 1/4 teaspoon caraway seeds. This gives a nice hidden flavor that goes well with the sweet and the tangy. Everything else is the same. I'll offer small hard rolls cut in half for those folks that want to make a sandwich out of this.

I can't figure out if this is supposed to be a main dish, or a side item. It didn't seem to be completely in either category. I liked the flavors, but don't think I'll make it again.

I made these for a Super Bowl party, and they were a flop.  Even without a ton of food around, they just did not get eaten.  I tried them and found them very bland.  Luckily, only made half a recipe.

Good! My husband loves sauerkraut and anything involving sausage so this was right up his alley. I didn't have any apple juice, but I think that would have made it too sweet for his tastes anyway. Thanks! :)

My husband and I enjoyed this dish.  It has only been until lately, that sauerkraut has been something I enjoy eating.  I am sold on this recipe.
