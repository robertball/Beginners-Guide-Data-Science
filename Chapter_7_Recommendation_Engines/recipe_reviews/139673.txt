YUM! The first cone I made didn't dry hard, so the next one, I made sure the heat was on medium-low and when the cone was slightly brown, I flipped it and pressed on it with my spatula so it browned evenly. It must get brown in order to dry hard. Flip it and press down on it again until it's nice and brown on both sides. Then, either shape it into a cone or put in in a small bowl so it's like a little cup. This was a fun recipe Thanx!

My whole family enjoyed these cones.  Mine turned out crispy.  It takes quite a while to get the cones evenly browned.  Next time I think I'll try it with a weight or baking them to get even browning faster.  They must be shaped quickly so they don't crack in the process.

I had similar problems as other reviewers getting these to firm up.  I suspect it has to do with the heat, but that's tricky; too low and it stays soft, too high and it burns (ask me how I know).  I'm probably going to experiment a little bit to see if I can get a more consistent product.  The taste is great, but I'd like to make the texture perfect too.  Because I burned the first one, I turned the heat way down.  I have an electric range, though, and it can be difficult to get good control.  I ended up keeping the heat just a bit below medium to keep mine from burning, but they were still soft.  I'll post again if I can get this to be perfect.  Worth it, though; very tasty (even if a little greasy).  My kids loved them.

I don't have a waffle griddle so my waffle bowls were not gorgeous, but the recipe did work out good. I used a flat griddle on medium-low heat and allowed them to slowly brown. They were a little tricky to flip the first time and then they were golden brown I draped them over the bottoms of wine and custard glasses. They hardened fairly quickly, within a couple of minutes. I did burn a couple of fingertips in the process of trying to pick them up when turning because I needed to get my spatula underneath. **Tip** To shape them over a bowl or glass, place a paper towl over the hot waffle cone so you can touch it and hold it in place as you shape the cup as you need. Hold for a minute until it cools and remove the paper towel.

These cones are EXCELLENT!  I used a Chef's Choice Waffle Cone Express grill to make them.  I do believe using a waffle grill of some type makes these cones perfect.  (They won't need flipping)  The grill came with a cone form to wrap the warm waffle around.  This could be made out of aluminum foil.  Take the warm waffle, lay it on a towel, then wrap it around a cone form and leave on the form until cool.  The ingredients are PERFECT, it's just a matter of mastering the technique!  Thank you Mal for sharing your recipe!

I made this gluten free by using white rice flour.  Yum!  Though it only crisped on the edges & it didn't stick together well (expected, with the lack of wheat gluten), it definately delivered the flavor of a good waffle cone.  My husband who hasn't had a waffle cone in years due to celiac, loved it!  I will experiment with other gluten free flours the next time around.

The end product was tasty, but the recipe could use a couple tweaks to get the crispiness everyone expects in a waffle-cone.  First of all, the recipe says it makes 8 cones, but it's actually closer to 5 cones based on the 1/4th cup of batter per cone.  You need to scale the recipe up if you want 8.  Next the recipe calls for cooking over medium heat.  This browns the waffles too quickly and you'll end up with soft and pliable cones.  If you want it firm up properly then you'll need to drop the temperature down a little.  Everyone's stove is different, but based on the reviews it seems like those that had success used a medium-low temperature.  In my case, I set the temperature knob to 5 o'clock (assuming 6 o'clock is medium). And my last suggestion is to make sure your work area is ready to go.  You want to be able to quickly form the cone as soon as it is off the griddle, otherwise the edges will start cracking on you.

My cones never got crispy, or even hard enough for using.  They tasted really good though.  I think I might use this recipe in a round waffle iron.  I think that might work better.

I thought this was great. Took a couple times to figure out how much batter to use in order for it to get crispy enough. But it worked and was delicious! I cut a paper plate and taped it into a cone shape and used that as my form. Viola! My kids loved them!

I could not get these to crisp up.  After cooking them, I put them in 1 cup custard cups and let them sit.  When I took them out, they did not retain their shape very well..kind of flimsy.  However... they tasted very good.  Eveyone LOVED them and didn't seem to mind the "non" crispy shell.  Maybe I will try again and bake them to get them to crisp up.

This was such a fun project! My only problem was burning my fingers as I attempted to form the cones while they were still pliable - and hot!

These came out absolutely horribly! So disappointed. I did everything EXACTLY as the recipe stated, but about the only thing these would be good for are to serve them as crepes. I think that the problem was the amount of egg. They never, ever got even remotely crispy. Just floppy and burnt. And that was with trying them on different heats, and as a last resort I even tried to cook them on a standard waffle iron. What a waste of eggs, sugar and flour.

Wonderful.  It takes a little effort but it is very much worth it.  Be forewarned, if you make these, you’ll have a hard time going back to store bought cones again.

I made some changes and these came out perfectly! First, I left out the yolks and only used egg whites. Second, , I used an electric mixer to beat them until frothy, gradually adding all other ingredients. Third, and most importantly, I used my trusty crepe maker griddle. I tried this recipe on a frying pan for the first one but it was a sloppy mess. I switched to pouring a bit directly onto the crepe maker and the rest were perfect. I could gently peel it from there without using any oil or butter, and let the other side cook. Once done, I had about 30 seconds to form it, and if it was a little wily, I held it with a toothpick as it cooled. I dipped the tops in melted chocolate and sprinkles and filled some with homemade eggnog ice cream! Love it!

Nice easy recipe.  I added just a tablespoon more flour to the recipe.  Make it hold up better when in the cone iron. Easy simple.  This is my go to Icecream cones.  I will experiment in the future with different flavors and post them.

This is a crepe, not an ice cream cone.  I got it plenty crispy but it does not hold a cone shape.  The flavor is good but they are very limp and I don't consider it an ice cream cone which is what I was wanting.

I'll give it three stars because it tasts delicious. But I didn't have a machine specific for the job and the pan never worked out well. No matter how thin I had it. It never crunched or went hard at all except for the sides. Tried different temperatures as well. 

I also think the amount of butter is to much.

I made these last night and they came out perfect. The first one was a little burnt, I adjusted the heat and the rest were light, crispy and the taste was just YUMMY. What fun it was to make. Thank you for this little gem of a recipe.

Pretty good. I wasn't convinced by the batter that this was going to work out, but it did. It was difficult to wrap the cones while they are hot (burnt fingers :( ). My family (hubby and kid) likes them also. Maybe if mine were pretty and golden we would have liked them better. Will probably try again.
