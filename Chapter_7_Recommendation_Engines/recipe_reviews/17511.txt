There is something off in this recipe ~ it just doesn't taste right as written!  After reading through a multitude of reviews, there are to many consistent changes to the proportions.  Will keep looking for a recipe more true to itself!  Sorry....

This recipe is a little off.  It certainly does not taste like any satay I've had before.  I followed the instructions exactly (after I scaled it down by exactly 1/2) and there were a couple problems with it.  1) The soy sauce was overpowering.  I recommend using a light or low sodium soy sauce or diluting regular soy sauce with equal part water.  2) The peanut butter taste is almost non-existent.  I recommend that the peanut butter be doubled to get a good flavor.

With the addition of 2 more tablespoons of peanut butter or "PBoy" as my 3yr old niece says, this marinate was truly delicious I pounded boneless skinless chicken breasts to 3/8in, marinated them overnight in this mixture, then baked them at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. Served with rice pilaf and asian coleslaw.The family thoroughly enjoyed this one. Its definitely a keeper,Kiera. Thank you.

I was surprised at how tasty this was.  I altered it a bit and left out the garlic and hot sauce.  Marinated the chicken about 5 hours then sauteed the chicken in the marinade.  The marinade thickened and clung to the chicken.  The only complaint I have using my version is the chicken was a tad salty even though I used low salt soy sauce.  My husband declared it one of his favorites and I'll make this again!

I enjoyed this recipe. I cut the chicken into strips. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and reduced the amount of curry powder and soy sauce.  I used about a tablespoon of curry powder and 1/3 cup of soy sauce instead.  It was great with the Satay Sauce, which I found on this site.

OK.  So I make this recipe for the first time, thinking I'll enjoy it and can take some to work for lunch, right?  The kids ate every piece before I could get to it.  I had to make it again just to taste it myself and it was great!!!!!  I use this recipe for almost every party/barbecue.  Thanks for sharing such a adult and child friendly recipe.

This is amazing!! I would give it a 4 as written but here are the changes I have made to make it even better! (combination of suggestions of others and my own instinct):  -Double the p.b. (4 tbsp) -Half the curry (1 tbsp) -Reduce the soy sauce to 1/3 cup (down from 1/2c.) -Add extra garlic (I usually do 4 cloves)  YUM!!! I've done it grilled but I'm going to see if I can get to taste just as good baked.

Delicious and fast!  Serve with chopped cucumber and red onion mixed with a little lime juice.  Also, works great on a George Foreman Grill with or without the skewers.

Wow.  This was easy and looked impressive.  Doubled the peanut butter and added extra garlic; it wasn't very spicy, so if you like it hot, definitely turn up the cumin.  Marinated mine overnight and broiled for 5 min on each side - smelled great and turned out very moist and savory.  This site is turning me into a culinary force to be reckoned with!  My husband is pleased.

Very good! I made this into a main dish tonight by starting the marinade this morning and didn't grill until later tonight. I used 6 chicken breasts (didn't bother to cube/skewer), reduced the curry to 1 TBLS and used 1/4c lemon juice and 114 cup lime juice.  My roommate said that "chicken doesn't get better than this!" Everyone was very impressed with the taste and how moist the chicken was.  Served with "brown rice" also found on this site and now we are all stuffed! Thanks Keira!

Wonderful!  loved by all family members.  Took the advice of others and made slight modifications - 1/3 c soy sauce, 1/3 cup lemon juice (from concentrate here), and 1 tbsp curry, extra garlic.  Used red curry paste instead of powder.  Doubled the marinade and peanut butter.  Peanut butter was the kind with honey (accidental purchase) but it gave an extra sweetness.  Marinade was thick and rich so I left it on the chicken as I skewered it.  Only marinated 30 min, broiled in oven 5min each side, still wonderful.  Made extra marinade for veggie dip and kids couldn't eat enough raw carrots, celery, broccoli.  Will definately make over and over.

Took others' advice: reduced lemon juice from 1/2 to 1/4 cup, reduced soy sauce from 1/2 to 1/3 cup, and added about a T extra peanut butter. Oh my...DELICIOUS!

If you aren't in the mood for grilling, sauteed in some sesame oil is declicious, too.

This was really good, and really easy!  I thought the amount of curry would be WAY too much, so I decreased it by half.  Was SO glad I did (was perfect)!  Instead of grilling, I put the chicken skewers on a cookie sheet in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes (be SURE and soak the wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes prior to baking to keep them from catching on fire.)  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  The only thing I changed was the amount of peanut butter (I doubled it), and the amount of curry (cut in half).  I used Laura Scudder's All Natural peanut butter for this recipe.  I think it has a better consistency for cooking than Jif, Skippy, or any of the other "non-refrigerated" brands.  This dish tastes really good with steamed white rice, peanut-flavored dipping sauce and chili sauce.  It has an excellent aroma while it's cooking on the grill.  We will make this again and again.

This a keeper fo us. I increased the peanut butter to 3 Tb. and marinade for no more than 2 hours. I like to make these in advance for a party so I grill the chicken only until half done to get the flavour, wrap them in foil (where they will continue to cook for a few minutes), then finish them off in a 350 oven for approx 15 minutes. I always serve these with a spicy Thai peanut sauce.

This was easy, delicious, and much less expensive than going out for Thai food. I live in an apartment and don't have a grill, so I broiled it in my oven and it turned out great. I served it with lemon ginger rice.

I am amazed my kids loved this dish!  I am not fond of "curry" so I cut it down to 1 tablespoon and it was still too "curry" for me!  Other than that it was easy and pretty good, instead of grilling I broiled for a few minutes.  I made a little extra sauce for dipping, using all the ingredients except the curry powder and even my toddler was dipping away saying "yum yum ma".

This is so yummy but I did make some changes. I reduced the soy sauce to 1/3 cup and next time I think I will reduce it to 1/4 cup...it makes the chicken super salty. I will also reduce the lime...it was a little too tangy for my taste. I made another batch of the sauce to dip in and I will definantly reduce the soy sauce and lime juice and add a little more peanut butter.

This was good, but not quite the Thai taste that I was hoping for.  Maybe more peanut butter needed, as was suggested by reviewers?  Not sure I'll try this again, but certainly was good enough to try to make & eat up for a dinner.

This ended up too salty for me, and I'm a big salt fan. I would use low sodium soy next time and increase the peanut butter to balance things out.

My husband loved this and asked me to make it again before dinner was over.  I didn't grill it though, I baked it at 350 with all the juices, for 45 minutes...served it over rice with sauce.  It was delicious.

great marinade. I used boneless pork chops and grilled them whole. I can't wait to try it with chicken. It tastes like you worked all day in the kitchen but so easy.

FANTASTIC!  First time trying this recipe, doubled the peanut butter as other reviewers suggested!  Marinated overnight and during the day, grilled for dinner - awesome!  Very nice taste, a little spice but not too much.  My 6-year old, 52-year old and I loved it!  Cannot wait for leftovers tomorrow!  Tonight I served it with asparagus, would be great with some buttered noodles or wild rice and a veggie.  Yum!

This sauce is delicious! I added some water to thin it down, then poured it over some chicken in my slow cooker. The left overs are great for lunch, too! I ended up only using 3 chicken thighs - so the sauce was enough to cover my chicken, if you are planning on doing a larger amount of chicken in the slow cooker, I would recommend upping the amount of sauce.

Always a hit at parties! Keep aside some of the sauce to use as a dip during the party.

This was just ok for me.  I followed the other suggestions and doubled the peanut butter, halved the curry powder and soy sauce and while the peanut flavor came through nicely, it still tasted too salty to me.  I even used low sodium soy sauce.  I will probably not make again.

The lemon in this marinade was WAY overpowering for us. Otherwise it smelled really good and seems to have great potential so we are going to try again. I followed the recipe to a T. Oh, and I only marinated for 4 hours! If I had gone for 24 it would have been awful.

My problem MAY have been:

Fresh squeezed lemon juice? OR
I marinated in strips, not whole breast? Maybe it just absorbed too much because of that.

I will likely try one more time with say 1-2 Tbsp of Lemon.

Wonderful!  We LOVED this!  I cut the chicken in strips, marinated it for about 2 hours, and cooked it on the George Foreman grill.  It was very moist and tender, unlike most chicken I've made on the GF.  I served it with Best Peanut Sauce from this website...mmmm...

This marinade really does give a Thai peanutty flavor to the chicken.  I cut my chicken into thin strips instead of cubes and then threaded them onto the skewers so that the end result would look more like the satay you get in restaurants.  I cut the curry powder down to 1 Tbsp. based on comments from other reviewers and added about 1 Tbsp. chili garlic sauce (asian food aisle). The only down part of this recipe for me was working with the marinated chicken.  I've washed my hands about 10 times and I can still smell the marinade.  I think next time I might just use larger pieces of chicken (maybe thighs, drums, boneless breasts cut in half) and bbq them without the skewers.

I ran out of time, so didn't put on skewers - I just sauteed the chicken in the sauce on the stovetop and it was great!

Per others' suggestions, I cut down the soy and lime juice (1/4 cup each).  I also made an extra batch of sauce for dipping, which we also used the next day heated over noodles.  I would definitely serve this recipe over rice or noodles.  Maybe even add bean sprouts, carrots and cucumbers.

This is a great recipe!!!! Perfect for a gathering that requires finger food.  The flavor is just right, your in for a big treat when you make this dish!  The only pain is putting the meat on the skewers.  Make sure you allow PLENTY of time to marinate the chicken, and spend the couple of extra pennies on GOOD QUALITY spices...my friend tried to make this recipe after having it at my house, and used "cheaper" spices...she ended up tossing the whole thing

With minor changes, this recipe produces a flavorful marinade that is fun to make with kids.  Don't confuse the marinade for a side peanut sauce because it is strong!  I decreased the amount of soy sauce by half and increased the amount of brown sugar -- adding water to offset the saltiness. I marinated the chicken for 15 minutes, which was the perfect amount for savory satay!  This is a kid-palate-pleasing recipe.

This was a delicious recipe but with enough marinade to cover a double recipe of chicken. At first my family grimaced at the recipe but were sold after the first bite (even when cooked in the oven on "broil" rather than on the grill). A definite repeat.

FABULOUS!  I have had a taste for Chicken Satay for a while now but I didn't want to pay for 3 or 4 little orders.  So I tried this.  IT IS FABULOUS!  I didn't have time to fire up the grill; I ended up stir-frying it.  It was awesome!

This recipe was a very good effort. It missed the mark by one star because it seemed to lack some sweetness and peanut butter.  So I added an additional TB each.  I am curious to experiment with some lemongrass next time, to give it a more Vietnamese/Thai flair.  Overall it was very good.

This was delectable!  I actually had it marinating for 2 days (ended up not cooking the next day as planned) and I was worried it might not help it out.  BUT...this recipe was perfect..just the right amount of zip, and it took just a few minutes on the grill to cook.  A keeper!!

I've made this for my last two parties and my guests love it.  They try to identify the ingredients, then when they can't quite figure it out, they ask me what's in it.  It is so easy to make and has unbelievable flavor.  This will be my favorite party Hors d'oeuvre.  By the way, I didn't change a thing about this recipe, just made it "as is".  It is perfect.

So good! I only used half the amount of curry and it was almost too much still. There is a lot of sauce to marinade, and dont add it all to the pan. The soy will caramalize and make the edges too salty and bitter.

This was fabulous!  I didn't change a thing, and let the chicken marinate for almost 24 hours.  I couldn't find skewers in my grocery store, so I put the chicken in a baking dish and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes.  Then I served with toothpicks, and peanut sauce from the Best Peanut Sauce recipe on this site.  It got rave reviews at my New Years Eve party.  I'll definately make this again - thanks!

THIS IS JUST CURRIED CHICKEN! TOO MUCH CURRY!!

After reading the ingredient list and the reviews I was excited about trying this recipe. I made it to the letter with FRESH ingredients (freshly-ground peanut butter and squeezed my own lemons). Unfortunately the CURRY overpowers ALL of the other flavors: the peanut butter, the soy -- even the garlic and the hot sauce! I was so disappointed. :(  Topping each piece with some peanut butter and a little hot sauce made it much better! 

Next time I will cut the curry in half. If that's not enough I will double the peanut butter, garlic, and hot sauce. Those are the flavors I was after, not CURRY!

I reduced the amount of soy sauce to 1/4 cup, and added 1/4 cup water.  It was quite mild flavored; I will make it again, but will use more hot pepper sauce.

Excellent thai taste!  I LOVE peanut sauces and this one tops my list.  I adjusted some of the measurements--more peanut butter, less of everything else.  I only marinated for 45 minutes, and it still tasted great.  Served it with a homemade peanut dipping sauce.  Can't wait to make it again.

So so good!  I put the chicken skewers on a cookie sheet and broiled them for a few minutes on each side, so it was easy to tell exactly when the chicken was perfectly done.  I also liked how the cookie sheet method helped save a lot of the sauce so that it could be spooned back over the chicken.  I served this with Vietnamese Spring Rolls and sesame broccoli.  My family gave the whole meal rave reviews!

Following another review, I doubled the peanut butter, halfed the soy sauce, doubled the garlic, and it was great! I grilled it for a cooking club and all the ladies LOVED it! I fried up the leftovers for my hubby the next day but it was much better grilled. Excellent adapted recipe!

This is one of the most amazing things I've ever tasted. I'm serious. This chicken is SO good. I doubled the peanut butter, cut the chicken in strips and broiled the skewers. It is perfect.

WOW! This chicken really explodes in your mouth! What a wonderful recipe. I highly recommend grilling the chicken. I served it with some jasmine rice and a little salad of cucumber, red onion, red pepper, lime juice, tsp. sugar and splash of rice wine vinegar. I made a few changes to the ingredients - doubled the peanut butter, more garlic, fresh ginger, tsp. hot curry powder and about 2 tsp. of Penzey's "Bangkok Blend". Just wonderful flavor - thanks!!

Immediate family favorite! After marinating, I dump the chicken and marinade in the skillet for 15-20 minutes and then serve it over rice. A lot less work than the skewers!

Way too salty! I tasted the marinade before I placed the chicken in and it was much too salty.  I added more brown sugar and peanut butter until it was passable.  Let it marinate overnight and BBQ'd the next day.  Still too much salt.  If I make it again, I will start with 1/2 the curry (which I love the taste of) and use low sodium soy sauce.  Then I'll taste it and go from there.

Rave reviews...this is a keeper!
I made a few modifications...
I used low-salt soy sauce.
For the hot sauce, I used Asian Chili sauce for its authenticity!  I also added an extra teaspoon of peanut butter (I like it to be extra p-nutty).  I put it through a mini-food processed to make it super-smooth.....
I highly recommend reserving a 1\2 cup of the sauce aside BEFORE marinading to serve with for dipping later.

This was excellent!  It's been a long time since I had satay, my husband really dislikes Thai and Indian cuisines so we've steered away from anything in that region.  But I decided to push his boundries.  This was so easy and so delicious.  My husband even liked it!  I made it with a coconut rice, raita and syrian green beans.  He said he could eat this meal regularly!  I did half the recipe and use the juice of one lime.  I think I could have cut back on the soy sauce too.  But since it was the first try I decided to use the resipe as is and it was really great!

Way too much curry.  I checked with other recipes and most suggest ONE Tablespoon, not two.  Will try again with less curry.

Loved it, loved it, loved it!!!  Served it to guests on the 4th and they all raved about it.  Paired this recipe with 'best peanut sauce' from this site.  Just served it on the side, some used the sauce, some didn't.  But all agreed that the chicken satay was awesome!  Thanks!

This was so flavorful and so yummy with "best peanut sauce" from this site. My husband gave it a 4 for the chicken alone but said that with the peanut sauce it was a 5. I beg to differ, as I thought it had such a great taste w/ or w/out the sauce. We paired this with the Asian Coconut rice as a side.

It was perfect.  Also cooked it on the George Foreman on the skewers.  No need to make a peanut sauce, esp. if you serve it with the peanut butter noodles on this site - exceptional. Served with pan-fried asparagus. Marinated the chicken for 3 hours and was very flavor-filled.

My husband always gets chicken satay as our appetizer at a local Thai restaurant. This recipe totally lived up to his expectations. I will probably end up making this often. It's easy too! I cut the meat into strips, marinated, then threaded them onto metal skewers. I cooked them on a cookie sheet in the oven on 350 for about 25 minutes. So tender and yummy! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Flavorful!  Much better than another satay recipe I've been using for years.  Reduced curry powder to 1 Tablespoon and hot sauce to just a dash to accomodate my kids' tastes. Broiled in oven instead of grilling. Served with "Best Peanut Sauce" also from this site.

This was very good.  I doubled the marinade, poored 1/2 over the chicken, added additional peanut butter and hot sauce and used it for the dipping sauce (enough PB in the food processor to make it the right consistency).  Once these came off the grill, they were excellent and everyone loved them at the cookout.

Well, you either love it or you hate it -- Thai food is kinda funny that way.  I guess that's why there are so many one stars mixed in with all the five star ratings!  I personally loved this recipe.  There were only about 2-3 TB of peanut butter left in my jar, so rather than scraping it all out -- I threw all the rest of the ingredients into the jar, put the lid on, and shook the heck out of it.  Poured it into a ziplock bag with the chicken.  I let the chicken marinate all day and we grilled it that evening.  Next time I will do two things differently (as suggested by other reviewers).  #1--I will double the peanut butter, and #2--I will reserve some of the sauce for dipping!  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This is an EXCELLENT recipe.  I soaked wooden skewers in water for about 5 hours while the chicken marinated.  I had cut the chicken into tenders (long and thin).  Then threaded the chicken on the skewers and grilled for about 15 minutes.  It was easy and tasted great, my backyard smelled like a chinese restaurant.  Thanks.

I just made this today with these changes: I made it into a chicken salad-type dish instead of on a grill, used only 1 tbsp. of peanut butter, and added a bit more garlic. This was delicious and the family loved it. We had it over white rice with blanched-crisp fresh green beans on the side. MMMMM!

FABULOUS beyond your wildest dreams!  I substituted  water for about 1/8th of the soya sauce/lime juice mixture to reduce the strength & saltiness and they were PERFECT. I made them for a big party of about 60 people and they were gone in a flash. Lucky I got some before the party started.  Thanks Keira!!!

This recipe is SOOOOO GOOOOOD.  I cooked the chicken in the oven (350 for 20-25 min) and it 
came out great!  I served it over rice and a side of green beans.  Yummy!

This recipe is awesome!
My boyfriend was insane over it, as was I!
I read some reviews about it being salty, etc. and although half a cup of soy sauce seemed like a lot, I don't regret following the ingredients exactly! Sure, It's a bit salty, but not anything crazy. The perfect amount if you ask me, especially when you're adding the extra sauce to something bland like rice or plain greens (this is what I chose to serve mine with). The only thing I didn't do was grill - instead I pan fried. Once the chicken was fully cooked I added the rest of the marinade and brought it to a boil (to kill any bacteria from the raw chicken as well as to thicken it and bring the flavours together). We have about a cup of extra sauce which I will use as a dipping sauce when I make salad wraps with rice paper (another Thai favorite). Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!!!!

I doubled the peanut butter and added some ginger.  This was way to salty for us, but i did like the flavor.  Next time I think i will do half soy half water.

I did not attempt to make this recipes as written based on all the negative reviews so I simply used it as a base making it my goal to achieve a sweet & spicey peanutty flavor. I somewhat doubled the sauce and came up with the following recipe: 1/2 C. peanut butter, 1/2 C. Soy Sauce & 1/2 C. Water (I didn't have low sodium soy), 1/2 C. lemon juice (I didn't want the tang from the lemon I only wanted it to tenderize the chicken), 3 TBLS Brown Sugar for added sweetness, I left out the curry in favor of my kids and used 4 fresh garlic cloves plus a few shakes of garlic powder. I also added a few shakes of red pepper flakes. Believe me this did not smell great when i made the marinade but the end result was great and a nice change of pace for chicken. I served with rice and broccoli. YUM!

I am not sure I would even give this a three star, but I think that at the core it would have been a good recipe. I made true to the recipe and wish I had listened to other reviewers and cut down on the soy sauce. This was SOOO salty I almost couldn't finish it. However it smelled amazing which I was cooking it. I think just cut down on the soy and use a lower sodium soy sauce at that would help this alot. I will try again and update if it is any better

Really good recipe. Loved the tanginess of the lemon. I froze them on skewers and they thawed and cooked up just as good. Only problem is finding a good peanut sauce to go with it. I cooked these on skewers on a stove top grill. I love those grills, perfect for this kind of meal where you don't want to start up the whole BBQ.

I used the lemon juice instead of lime and after mixing it all together I found this maranade way too tangy. I tried adding double PB but it was still no good. I'm only rating this a 2 instead of 1 because I didn't bother to use this, it went down the drain,  I didn't want to waste my chicken too. So I really never gave it a good chance. Good thing I bought the store maranade as back up.

This was pretty good. It is a bit more Indian inspired that other chicken satays I have tasted. The curry flavor and color was kind of strong. Instead of the grill I just put them on a foil lined baking sheet in the broiler for 12 minutes turning every 3 minutes. Although, I think they would have been even better grilled. The other downside is I didn't think they tasted very great when heated up. The texture turned real rubbery and I am dependent on warmed up food. I think though this would be best eaten, when just made, with some rice and a salad.

I would recommend marinating in a ketsap (not ketchup!) which is a sweet soy sauce found in asian food stores adding only fresh cilantro or chopped green onions and then using the rest of the ingredients separately to make a dipping side peanut sauce.  That the satay I grew up with.

This was amazing! My boyfriend and I loved it. I had never cooked with curry before so I was nervous, don`t be intimidated it turned out wonderful. I served this with thai cucumber salad, and peanut butter noodles. I cut the chicken breasts into strips and pounded them before marinating overnight. I added some ginger. It was wonderful!

This is a great marinade, but I will leave the chunks larger the next time as they were a little dry even though they were not on the grill very long.

Very tasty way to prepare chicken! I made this last night and placed it over some steamed basmati rice. I adjusted the recipe and used only 3 chicken breasts, but with the same amount of marinade.  While this didn't seem to intensify or change the flavor of the chicken, the next time I make this I'll do the same thing; however, instead of using the entire amount of marinade to marinate the breasts, I'll use half and reserve the other half to drizzle over the chicken.  After putting the grilled chicken over the Basmati rice,it was a little dry and could have used something to give it and the rice a little moisture.

Awesome!  I took the advice of previous reviewers and doubled the peanut butter.  I also used low sodium soy sauce, cut it in half, and diluted it a bit; otherwise, this would have been way too salty.  Add some green onions, ginger, sesame seeds, and whatever else you like.  This also makes a mean stir-fry or kabbab.

Awesome as an appetizer!  I added more peanut butter as well as about a TBSP of grated fresh ginger.  I used the juice of 1 lemon and 1 lime, and slipped in a slug of rice wine.  I also increased the brown sugar just a bit.  Next time, I would probably use low-sodium soy sauce.  Too cold out to grill, so threw it into the oven in its marinade for about 30 minutes.  Just a lovely blend of flavors!

This is a great way to serve chicken!  The result was very tender meat with lots of flavor.  I did marinate the chicken over night (first time I followed the recipe and found that the chicken could have had a stronger flavor, so I made them up the night before the 2nd time around, and it was perfect).  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

About a month ago I ordered chicken satay at a ethnic restuarant and the flavor was kind of exotic and I loved it. I tried this recipe and it was so close to a replica of that! I am so excited that I know how to make that dish now. I think it is the curry powder that sets it aside, along with the mild hint of peanut butter. This would be great with coconut rice.

Great taste! Marinated for about an hour (only time I had) and baked, uncovered in its marinade at 350' for about 40 minutes. Thanks!

Excellent! I did use just a tad more peanut butter and scaled the recipe way back. I also added chunks of red and yellow bell pepper to the skewers.  Marinated overnight and the chicken had great flavor. Thanks! :)

Not what I was expecting... to bad! 
06/01/10 Much better, I didn't even realize I had tried this before until I came to review it. I used 3Tbl of pb instead of 2 and a little less soy sauce. I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes and used House of Tang peanut sauce for dipping. Really good. A Keeper.

I used low sodium soy sauce so it didn't come out too salty tasting.  I agree with other reviewers though that it didn't have much of a peanut butter taste to it.  I used 20 oz. chicken, 1/4 cup uncooked rice, and 1/2 an onion diced.  I through this with all the other ingredients in the crock pot and it came out great.

Such a great recipe! I made this over at my parents' house and my dad was a huge fan! My mom is not big on neither peanut butter nor curry, so she wouldn't even attempt to try it. I couldn't taste either one distinctly, but whatever! This chicken was amazing, as well as amazingly simple!

I baked the chicken, followed the advice of others and reduced the soy sauce & curry while adding more peanut butter.  It turned out wonderful, my husband kept going on and on about it.

This is the beginning of a really good recipe, but isn't quite there yet. I added more peanut butter and peanut sauce, and then served it over basmati rice.  It could have used some coconut milk.. or something.

Very good. The chicken was really tender and kept the marinade flavour though grilling. I marinated overnight which I like to do as it leaves little prep for next day's meal. I can see how some may think there is too much curry but personally I found the balance to be fine. There are many curries, some stronger tasting than others. I served this with plain rice, fasoliyyeh bi z-z (Syrian green beans) from this site and The best Thai peanut sauce also from this site. Wow I really had an AR meal tonight. Thanks for an enjoyable dinner.

This was very easy to cook and came out good with the peanut sauce and rice I made to go along with it, but the lemon juice was quite overpowering for my tastes.  I will be making it again sometime in the future, but I think I'll cut down on the salt and lemon.

I invited my dad and brother over for an entire Asian meal, which included these.  I broiled them after marinating all night and served them with a dipping sauce (I can't seem to find or remember where I got the recipe for the sauce however!).  They were perfectly delicious!

Yummy, yummy! My husband and I loved it, the kids liked it. Did not use curry because I don't like it. Added some grated ginger because I love it! Marinated it for about 7 hours, don't think it needs overnight. This is a keeper for sure!! Made Thai Style Peanut Sauce with Honey to go with it - a must, so good!!

This was really good. I did a couple different things. I added grated ginger to the marinade and cut the chicken into bite sized peices. Instead of grilling them on skewers I sauteed it in seseame oil (not too much though) and green onion. I used it for lettuce wraps. was soooo delicious. I will definatly be making these again. YUM!

Fantastic recipe! We love Thai and Laos food at our house, and this chicken satay is a favorite! We ate it on rice with peanut sauce smothered over it. It would also be good with some cooked spinach or snow peas. Love it!

The chicken was moist and flavorful. I took the advice of others and cut the lime juice way back. I served it with peanut sauce for dipping and the Japanese Zuchini and Onion recipe from the site. My 4 yr old LOVED it!

Yum. People were fighting for the last one.  I too used only 1/4 lime (that's all I had)juice, 1/3 soy sauce, and 3 tbsp peanut butter.  It was marinaded overnight and the flavor really soaked in.

Made this for my family and they loved it!  Only change was I didn't bother with the skewers (I have a toddler and that spells disaster).  Chicken was moist and tasty.  Will definitely make again.  I would suggest to cooks to do this on the grill outside since the marinade makes a big smoky mess inside.

It was pretty good but it didn't compare to our local restaurant which was is the only other chicken satay we have had.  It was not bad for a cook at home recipe, though.  I have no idea how I would improve on the recipe.

This was terrific - I used chicken thighs and had excellent results. Since I made this twice, the second time I cooked the chicken, marinade and all with a little veg oil in a pan, covered for 6minutes and had, again, terrific results. Served with chickpea curry, naan and rice with date-raisin chutney.

I just love chicken and beef satays'  the only addition I did to this recipe was the addition of grated fresh ginger into the marinade. Peanut dipping sauce is excelent chioce for this dish, make it fresh though don't try and reduce the marinade for a sauce because of the soy sauce it will be too salty.

It was pretty good.  But don't make the mistake I made -- throw out the marinade when you're cooking it.  It's just too overpowering to eat like that.  The chicken, however, was wonderful.

I loved this recipe!  Unfortunately, my husband didn't....but that is because he is a diabetic and we use a lot of p'nut butter when his sugar hits a low.  I used this as an appetizer for a dinner party and {nearly} everyone loved it.

AWESOME!!  I loved this dish -- it is exactly how I hoped it would be.  Just like from a Thai restaurant.  Very tasty with just the right amount of spice.  Also, it was a very nice presentation.  I liked being able to make it ahead of time which made dinner time very quick and easy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was great, the marinade was very flavorful.  I did not use skewers but instead cooked the chicken on my George Foreman grill... and served it with a peanut dipping sauce.  I will definitely be making this again soon! :)

You might ask yourself:  Why should I make homemade satay peanut sauce when I can buy it in a jar in the grocery store?  Please believe me, there is no comparison between this fabulous homemade sauce and jarred.  This marinade is so smooth, so creamy, a bit spicey, with no funny aftertaste like store bought.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and wouldn't change a thing.  You can vary the spice with your curry powder and hot pepper sauce.  For us, it was HOT curry and Tabasco pepper sauce.  Thank you so much, Kiera!

I recently made this for my boyfriend and I & we loved it!  It was quick & easy.  I used three tablespoon peanut butter and next time I'll add extra brown sugar.  I served it along with allrecipes "Best Thai peanut sauce" which turned out to be soo good mixed with noodles and veggies... will have again!

Okay, 2 TABLESPOONS of curry is WAY TOO MUCH!  (in my opinion)  It acutally made me sick.  I WILL try these again with maybe a teaspoon of curry.  I love Thai food, but this was bad with this much curry.

Very flavorful. I thawed the chicken breasts in the marinade overnight (omitted hot pepper sauce)and broiled the skewers for about 5 minutes. This has become a family favorite. My 3 yr old loves to eat the meat holding both end of the skewer, corn-on-the-cob style.

This recipe got RAVE reviews at a recent party.  It's not what I'd normally consider "satay", but it's definitely a keeper, and I'm already making it again! I doubled the pb just because I like the peanutty taste, I also used a little less curry ... but I will highly recommend it!!

I scaled this recipe to serve six.  I added just a litte additional peanut butter (2 more teaspoons).  This was really good.  I reserved some of the sauce for dipping.  Marinated this overnight.  Will make again and again.

I just happened to have all these ingredients on hand which was really nice.  I thought it tasted great & I used tofu because i'm a vegetarian and it turned out very well and it was very easy. I added some ground peanuts as well for a slightly crunchy tast. All I did was grind them up in my proccesor, but those of you w/out one can just crush them in a bowl with or bag.  Great recipe!  It tasted like it does in Thai restaurants.

My husband and I made this recipe after returning from Singapore.  It almost tasted like the "real thing" we had at the Satay Club.  The kids really loved it, too!  Serve with some Thai peanut sauce on the side and a bowl of cucumbers and onions, and you are all set!

Made no changes, and this recipe has been saved to my favorites for a couple years now... I like to use an easy peanut dipping sauce recipe from Martha Stewart to go with it! Every time I make this, my husband insists on me making it again the next day! I just keep the marinade and throw more chicken in it!

The soy to peanut butter ratio is way off. I had to add sugar to cut the overpowering saltiness of it and make the sauce edible.

My family really enjoyed this. I did end up doubling the peanut butter, but other than that I made it as written. I have served this with some homemade naan, rice, and various veggies. We un-skewer the meat and put it all into the naan. It makes for a great Eastern hemisphere combination turned into a hand-held dinner. (The naan recipe I found on AllRecipes, posted by "Mic")

This was okay. It definitely didn't turn out like satay from a restaurant. The flavors weren't quite there. Also my peanut butter never ceased to be weird and clumpy although I'm  pretty sure that's my fault. Maybe I was super to heat it up or use a different kind of peanut butter. I'm not sure.

Very tasty!
I marinated the chicken overnight and cooked in the oven at 350 for 25 min since I don't have a grill.
I used 4 tbsp peanut butter, and the curry was still a bit overpowering, so next time I would halve the amount of curry (like others have suggested in their reviews). I will probably also decrease the amount of soy sauce and lemon juice and skip the hot sauce. Overall I enjoyed it and will definitely make it again!

What a great change from the ordinary chicken dishes. I'll be making this again next week for sure.

Great! Marinated the chicken overnight and when put on the grill it was full of flavor. Made a peanut sauce from this website which was delicious as well. Thank you!

I did not like it at all. To make it better, I'd use less reduced sodium soy sauce, less curry powder, doubled peanut butter, and more sugar.

This is an excellent recipe!  Good for more than just Satay but for any Asian dish.
The Satay needs the marinate for the chix but then also the dippin' sauce (as my Texan wife would say) when you serve it.  I follow the recipe for the marinate but then I stiffen up a separate  recipe to provide a sauce to dip the grilled chix into.  To do this I reduce soy and lime and increase PButter so that the dipping sauce is thicker.
Great flavor- doesn't need to sit long in the marinate- that's an old wives tale.

Way too much curry powder and lemon juice.  Not enough peanut butter.  It was edible, but I'm sure there are better recipes out there.

Mistake number 1: All Mine. 
I began to put this recipe together after seeing it had 4.5 out of 5 stars and before I read any of the reviews. 
Mistake number 2: Followed the recipe
My husband stood behind me as I measured the lemon juice and soy sauce. He was saying...that's a LOT of sour and salty juice. 
Things started to go better after I added more peanut butter, more brown sugar....and then they really turned around when we agreed we were NOT going to add the chicken. 
Thanks to the November 2011 reviewer, we spared  our chicken, too. 

My husband is going to make the standby chicken and black bean casserole.

I thought this was just ok... It wasn't very flavorful, it was mostly just salty. We made honey-peanut sauce to go with it and that really saved the meal - I'm not sure we would have finished the chicken without the sauce.

Changed recipe up a little and it was pretty good.

Doubled the peanut butter, a tbsp and a half of lemon juice, one tbsp of curry powder, and a extra tbsp on brown sugar did the trick. Marinated for the 2 hours and grilled.....Will make this again. =)

Great recipe!  I made this exactly as written for my picky 10 year old daughter's birthday.  I have made satay many times before, but have never added curry.  Great twist on the taste.  My daughter who grumps about eating anything at all(especially "spicy" food), loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this last weekend and was pretty happy with it.  I did double the peanut butter and I still feel I could have added a bit more as I felt it was a bit lost still.  Next time I will cut down on the curry powder as it was a bit overwhelming.  All in all though it was pretty good.

Made this for my husband who loves the Thai's Chicken Satay.  He liked this better, I did make the Peanut Sauce from this website for dipping.  The entire family enjoyed it.

whole family liked this recipe...kids and adults.
made the full amount of marinade, but only had four breasts, so saved a bit to pour on stir-fry veggies. 
cheated with curry powder and used curry paste, but i followed the rest of the recipe.

I did as others recommended and decreased the amount of soy sauce and curry powder, and increased the amount of peanut butter.  Marinated the chicken overnight and grilled it the next day.  Matched with a peanut sauce for dipping and these were the hit of the party!!

I have no idea if it tastes authentic, but it was delicious.  I used lemon juice instead of lime and habanero sauce because I had it on hand.  I may even use a slight bit more the next time.  It smelled so good as it cooked my neighbors were drooling!  Thanks for a new addition to my rotation.

Yummy!  I didn't add the 2 tbs of curry powder, thought that would be too overwhelming...added 1 and 1/2 tsp and it was perfect.  Served with peanut sauce recipe from this sight, believe it's called awesome peanut sauce.

I did this recipe mostly to "T" but I ran out of curry powder and added chili powder. I love it that way. I did find it salty and I think I will reduce the soya sauce or find a reduced salt  soya sauce. I also added a sweet chili thai sauce. I also used it as a dipper. I am going to take this recipe and tweak it to my own.

Buy a package of 'chicken tenders' when they are on sale to save time cutting the chicken. The tenders are the perfect size/shape to slip onto a skewer to grill. After reading the reviews these where the changes we made and enjoyed the results: reduce the soy sauce to about 1/4 c.; reduce curry to 1 tbs; double the PB.  Serve with a nice peanut satay sauce. Delish!

this is a great recipe!!  i eyeballed the proportions for the ingredients because i was too lazy to follow exactly - but it tasted great.  instead of cubing, i cut thin strips about 3 inches long and put two to a skewer.  cooked super fast and looked like restaurant-style satay.  thanks for the great recipe!

This is AWESOME! I am allergic to peanuts so I used unsweetened soynut butter but changed nothing. I love the complex flavors of the marinade and the tenderness of the chicken. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I cooked the chicken on the stovetop with the marinade and served with spiced rice. It was pretty good. I thought it was missing something, but it may be because of my cooking method. The marinade was pretty sour IMO...I'm not a huge fan of lemon juice, so next time I think I will decrease it a bit. I will make this again with some modifications.

Overall a good recipe.  I served with peanut sauce which helped mask the overpowering curry a bit.  Will make it again with less curry and more peanut butter like others suggested.

My guests raved about these!  My girlfriends do a different ethnic food every week and we play around with new recipes.  This week was Thai food and these were the first items to be eaten!  I did use the red chile saracha (sp?) sauce instead of regular hot sauce.

Trying to find a recipe that was like the Satay we had at a restaurant.  This wasn't it.  Good, but not what I was hoping for.

My kids loved it and I thought it was alright. I think I might have screwed up though because I found it kind of salty.

I doubled the peanut butter, added cumin, garlic powder, curry and a honey, since I didn't have brown sugar.  We put it on kebab sticks and cooked it on the George Foreman with bell peppers (green and red) onions and mushrooms and ate it over rice with parsley and 7 spices.  It was one of the best meals i've ever had on a diet !!!!

I love this recipe.  It does take a bit of work and your hands will smell for about a week after handling the marinated chicken, but it has an amazing flavor.  I do, though, refrain from revealing the ingredients to anyone until after they have tried it and like it.

Recipe was okay, pretty salty, a bit dried out for a marinated chicken. Probably won't make again.

Fantastic!  I made this on the stove top, added green beans and simmered the chicken and beans in the marinade.  With rice pilaf on the side it made for a satisfying and healthy dinner.  I used only about 1/4 of tamari, more garlic and I think it could have used a touch more brown sugar, otherwise it was really, really great! Even my 11 mo old daughter liked it!

My kids loved this recipe.  I added some fresh grated ginger.  Would probably try with low sodium soy sauce next time.  Just a bit salty. Would be great for a party or for guests!

My husband and I thought this recipe was great.  I only made a couple of changes.  I was low on curry and only used 1 T. I also used fresh squeezed lime juice and low sodium soy sauce.  The thing that really made the dish for us was we sprinkled a little coconut on top when we served the chicken with rice.  The coconut adds a touch of sweetness that compliments the citrus.  We will definitely make this again.

Just made these for my Super Bowl party.  Marinated them for about 15 hours then cooked on a stovetop grill.  Made the Thai-Style Peanut Sauce with Honey for a great combination.  Very tasty and flavorful even without the sauce.

Agree with other reviews.  I wanted a chicken satay that had flavor on it's own and this one definitely did.  I marinated over night which helped infuse the flavor.  I still served peanut sauce but everyone said it didn't even need it.
very good crowd pleaser.

I have made this three times. 
1st time,good but, salty.(I had even used low sodium soy) Made exactly to recipe instructions. 2nd time-reduced soy sauce only to 1/4Cup. Too strong lemon juice. 
3rd time-- Reduced soy & lemon juice each to 1/3 Cup and used Smuckers Organic Peanut Butter (which is rather low in sodium). Much Better! I am not giving up on this recipe! Soo Good! 
Will continue to make! Made it for 60 servings and companied it with Best Peanut Sauce on this site!  Everyone loved it!

These were good, but not as much flavour as I thought they would have for on their own.  I served the leftovers with "thai-style peanut sauce with honey" from this website, which made them significantly better.

This was fantastic! I baked the chicken rather than grill it. Cut the chicken into strips, marinated the chicken for 3 1/2 hours and then baked it at 180 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes. I served it with peanut butter noodles from this website. My husband and I gobbled it up. Very tasty and will definitely make again!

I served this with the Thai Style Peanut Sauce with honey from this site. My dad said it tasted just like what he got at a restauraunt. We just cooked the marinade and chicken in a wok until it was done, because there wasn't enough time to mess with the grill. We had rice and a salad of cucumber, red onion, and lime juice as side dishes.

too much curry powder.  thought it tasted too peanut buttery.  hot sauce makes it taste like wings, so i will use chili oil or something next time.

this was good.  however, is it possible to marinate something too long?  I marinated this overnight and then all day, until dinner time.  I used half low-sodium soy and half tamari.  it was very salty and lime-y.  I might try again with only marinating from morning until dinner to see if I enjoy the results better.  I followed the recipe with the suggested changes of halving the curry powder and increasing the peanut butter.  the texture was great though, very tender.  I sauteed the chicken on the stove top with a little bit of the sauce.

I marinated mine overnight. I did reduce the salt just because I don't care for my things too salty. Glad I did because even with 1/2 the salt, they were still a tad overpowering. Instead of hot sauce I used a little cayenne pepper. Also used hot curry powder and lime instead of lemon. They came out pretty good. Next time I will reduce the salt even more. I grilled them on the BBQ and served with sweet chili sauce and a Thai peanut sauce and some rice.

This was good.  I did follow other's suggestions.  I doubled the peanut butter.  I didn't have chunky, so I put 1/4 cup + 1 Tbs Skippy low fat creamy peanut butter.  I also cut the curry to 1 1/2 Tbs.  I think I will use the full 2 Tbs next time.  I would make it again, but would definately marinade longer than 2 hours.  I also made 1/2 chicken and 1/2 beef (top round steaks cut into strips).  My family liked the beef better.  My picky four year old loved the "beef on a stick".

Called it peanut butter chicken on a stick and my kids ate it right up.  I didn't use the hot sauce (because of the kids).  I only marinated it for 30 minutes and then I basted the chicken with some remaining marinade and it was great.

It was a little to salty, and I only marinaded for an hour at most.  So next time I will be using less soy sauce.  But other than that, it was really good.  I also broiled it in the oven instead of grilling it.

I made this exactly as written for company and it was very well received.  I do think it was too salty, but perhaps that is because I marinated the meat overnight (15 hours).  Next time, I'll try less time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Charred a little, but did not taste burnt. Better than the satay @ the Thai joint I frequent!

This was a little too salty for my taste as written, also a little heavy on the lemon juice.  I only used half of the soy and half of the lemon juice, doubled the peanut butter and added another T. of brown sugar.  My family enjoyed it with the Thai style peanut sauce with honey. Thanks for the recipe.

We loved this chicken!!  I cut the chicken into strips instead of cubes and threaded it onto the skewers in the traditional satay fashion.  It was fabulous.  I did add a little extra peanut butter, but other than that I followed the recipe.  We had this with a packaged Thai noodle dish, but I think next time I will make extra marinade to make my own Thai noodles.  My family can't wait to have this again!!

This was pretty good. I had some chicken that I didn't want to do the same boring stuff with and gave this a try. I only marinated for about 4 hours. All of the flavors were there, and I definitely did not think that the lemon was overwhelming. In fact, the lemon was extremely subtle. I boiled my marinade while the chicken was cooking for dipping, but it was not neccesary. It could have benefitted from a peanut sauce, but it was great on it's own. I served this chicken with lots of white rice.

This was really good!  My very picky 6 yr. old liked it and my 2 yr. old loved it!  It was pouring out, so I cooked it on the grill pan.  Will make it again and do it on the grill.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Really good, lots of flavor.  Used recipe as written, marinated for about 3 hours, threaded on wood skewers.  Served with mac and cheese, (just in case the kiddos didn't like the chicken, I know....) cheesy green beans, and homemade butter fan rolls out of a vintage Crisco cookbook.  My 7 YO girl hugged me and said it was the best I ever did!!   Hubby said we wouldn't like it, which is his best compliment.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Um, not very good! I could taste the lime, I could taste the peanut butter, but the curry was way overpowering! The flavors somehow did not meld together. And while it was juicy on the inside it was very dry on the surface. I would recommend some kind of basting.

It was really good I made it twice already. Using garlic cloves can be too garlicy but instead i sub with garlic salt and the taste was much better. You dont need to marinate overnight a good 5 hours is enough.

I didn't have curry powder so I left it out and I just poached chicken breast. I served the chicken on lettuce leaves with chopped cashews and Asian sweet and spicy chili sauce and they were so delicious.

Fabulous, easy and fast!  What more could you ask for on a busy weeknight.  Marinaded the whole chicken breasts after using a meat tenderizer with the prongs in the fridge for about 5 hours.  Hubby came home not feeling well so instead of grilling I put them on the G.Foreman grill and they came out moist and very flavorful.  my 9yr old son actually loved it and he rarely eats chicken!  will make this on skewers on the grill for company sometime.  Thanks so much.

Yum!  I made these for a Christmas Eve gathering and everyone loved them.  It was way too snowy to grill so I put them in the oven at 375 for about 20 minutes, flipping once.  They were amazingly tender.  I added a dash of red hot pepper flakes to the marinade for a bit more zip.  I found a Peanut Sauce recipe on this site and served the Satay with it.  Fabulous.

this recipe was nothing like any chicken satay i have ever tasted.  I have had this dish in both authentic thai restaurants and the americanized version, and this tasted nothing like either.  there was barely any peanut butter taste at all, it was completely overpowered by the curry and soy sauce. had to add triple the sugar and peanut butter and some plum sauce to even make it edible.

Very good.  I lived in thailand for a year and there's nothin' like going to a thai market for some fresh chicken (guy) satay.  Obviously, this recipe is slightly "amercanized" which is fine with me.  My family loved it.    

It was just a bit salty, so I'll probably ease up on the soy sauce next time, and I also would like to have more peanut butter flavor.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made them in the oven and it still turned out really good. They were just a bit dry (but that might be the oven).

Great recipe.  This was so easy to make.  I added 1/3 cup of coconut milk to the other ingredients. Marinated for 4 hours and the chicken had a ton of flavor.  I would serve with a peanut sauce next time though.

Made the chicken very tender. I found it a little salty but my husand thought it was fine. I used diced chicken, skewered and cooked on the barbie. Simple tasty and will do again.

I combined the ingredients for the marinade from this recipe along with the added coconut milk that was suggested in the easy chicken satay recipe on this site. I also used the peanut dipping sauce from that recipe. All I know is a came up with a great tasting,flavorful, and tender chicken satay that will definitely be made again!

I love this recipe!  My husband loves it even more.  I've made it for two parties and it was gone before I was done serving the rest of the stuff both times.  It is a definite pleaser.

This was really good.  Next time I'll probably use boneless skinless chicken thighs so that it would be more moist.  I have a tendency to overcook chicken breast.  I did it on my George Foreman grill as well and it took less than four minutes for each breast which I halved.

I made these for Boxing day tea and they went down a storm.  My sister in law couldn't believe they were made from scratch.  Only changes I made were to omit the chilli sauce because I didn't have any and I cut the chicken into strips and threaded them onto skewers.  They were lovely and I am not normally fond of satay!

This is an excellent marinade recipe.  It's a bit much when adding peanut sauce for dipping.  If I'm doing satay, I prefer to get more taste from the peanut sauce, but the chicken is great alone.

I loved this! I'm glad I chose this recipe to make my first chicken satay.  However, I wish I it looked more presentable. But the taste was so good! The marinade made the chicken so tender and flavourful! This goes into my recipe box right away!

Made this for co-workers on our Canasta night.  Very well liked with requests for the recipe.  Great for a buffet party.  Used the recipe without any changes.  Definitely putting in the recipe box.  Served with Best Peanut Sauce a recommended by another reviewer.

These were good, it had a really distinct peanut taste if you wre into that. I chopped the chicken up, and placed in a torilla with a nice refreshing salad and it was wonderful.

I let it soak all the juices in for 2 days and made this for a dinner party!! Holy cow it was great. Also, I was running short on time so I popped them in the George Forman Grill (we have aone of the larger ones) and they cooked up beautifully. You can cook it with the stick on!!! Great!!!

Excellent recipe!  I sent this on to many friends who attended a party last night.  I especially liked that I could make it ahead (I think it made the chicken that much more tender) and only had to grill it up just before serving.  If you're considering a  Satay, this is the recipe you want to use.

This recipe was very good.  This recipe made enough to marinate 2 pounds of boneless chicken thighs.  I marinated them for 8 hours and broiled them for 6 minutes each side. Delicious!

This was good, but not as flavorful as I'd have thought--next time I will make the dipping sauce too.  I'd also cut back on the soy a bit. Don't misunderstand, it was good, I just thought it would be better.

I didn't have a problem with saltiness like some of the other uses did - just eat it with rice or tofu on the side. I'll be making this again, but next time I'll use less juice and soy sauce, and more peanut butter and curry powder.

I  made this last night on my Foreman grilll and served it with coconut asian rice  and it was AMAZING!!!  All 3 of my children loved it...even my 13 year old who has all of a sudden become the pickiest eater ever.  I only had time to let it marinate 3 hours...but it was perfect.  Tasted just like the satay I get from my favorite restaurant.  I'll be making this A LOT!

I marinated my chicken overnight and grilled it on the bbq. What I found was that is was WAY to salty... I used lemon instead of lime juice maybe that was the problem. Don't know.

Not bad at all! There's a peanuty aftertaste that follows the initial flavor of the curry. I cooked it on my george foreman grill and used a smaller amount of white sugar because we were out of brown. Will make again!

heck yes. this is pretty good easy Thai food. I made this in the broiler because i live in NY and don't have a grill :( .  I recommend using the really thin breasts. they were perfect. 5 minutes on each side.  Great flavor using alot of basic ingredients you may have around your house already!

This recipe tastes nothing like chicken satay.  It tastes like chicken that has been soaked in soy sauce and lime juice.  There was not much of a peanut taste nor was there any spicy kick.

I really didn't like this at all.  It didn't taste much like a satay and it was too sour (too much lemon juice not enough brown sugar).  I think I'll stick with the Thai Pork Satay on this site.

Very good! Even the pickiest eater in the world (my boyfriend's son) liked it. Will definitely be making again.  Made exactly as instructed. Only change I will make is to keep extra marinade for basting during cooking to keep meat moist. Flavor is excellent!

A nice recipe.  I mixed the chicken in with the Peanut Butter Noodles recipe from this site and it was well received.

Great recipe!  I made half the quantity of marinade with less soy sauce - wonderful.  I added raw veggies to the skewers (red & green pepper, onions and zucchini).  I did not grill but cooked them on a square griddle (loosely covered) and let them simmer in the extra sauce.  I served with rice and salad.  The meal was a big hit.

Pretty good! Used chicken tenders and grilled without skewers. Used lime juice and decreased this to 1/3c. and decreased the soy (I used lite-low sodium) to 1/3c. as well. Tasty...like the peanut butter flavor.

I halved the amount of curry, and it was still to overpowering.  I think I will leave it out next time.  Otherwise it was good.

Loved this recipe except that it turned out too salty for us.  I'll definitely make again, but cut the marinade time down to about an hour or so, instead of all day.  Otherwise, it was great!

I hav always liked Chicken Satay but this was a tad bit strong for me. I put the chicken in the marinade early that morning - maybe I should of shortened the marinade time. It was much better after I dipped it in a peanut sauce.

The chicken was very good I served it over rice.My husband enjoyed it very much but my son would not touch it. I don't no if that was because we had other things he liked more or if it was just him being a 2 yr old. Did add a little more brown sugar to the extra sauce and then boiled it to pour over the chiken and rice, took the edge off the salty taste. Will make again without a doubt.

I made ths with with a top grade sirloin.  Marinated whole steaks, bbq'd and then sliced thin.  So tasty we didn't even need the peanut sauce for dipping.  I used red curry paste instead of curry powder.

My whole family loves this recipe! We used almond butter instead of peanut butter and a low sodium salt sauce. I love to top it with a pumpkin seed sauce with a cilantro garnish. I love the fact that I can make chicken wraps for lunch the next day.

Delicious! Doubled the peanut butter and watered down the soy sauce (1/2 and 1/2) as others have suggested and it was a huge hit at a party! Used the President’s Choice Peanut sauce (from Lablaws in Canada) for dipping.

easy and tasty. some complain the peanut taste doesn't come through. I used natural peanut butter (no added salt or sugar) and the recipe came out great. after marinating, I threw the whole thing, chicken and sauce, into a pyrex dish and baked it at 350 until a thermometer declared it done. simple and fabulous. thanks for the recipe!

I was impressed. The taste was so great! The chicken was thoroughly cooked & tender. I didn't change the recipe too much, other than adding a little extra peanut butter & lime juice. My husband & I paired this chicken satay with fresh rolls. It was super yummy.

I changed nothing and we loved it! I thought the recipe was great. Change from the normal boring chicken. I served with cilantro lime rice and naan!

I'm giving this a rating based on how it tasted before I changed it.  As others have said, the lemon juice is very overpowering.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the omission of the sugar and maybe more garlic.  I tasted it and couldn't believe the excessive sour taste.   I added more soy, a lot more peanut butter, probably double the amount of the recipe and still could have used more, and another tablespoon of curry.  Still, I thought it was tart.  I decided to add the chicken strips anyway.  It was marinated about 36 hours or more turning it from time to time.  When it was ready, I threaded it on bamboo skewers and grilled it.  It didn't take much time at all to cook trying to keep it still moist and tender and not dry.  It was a hit and requested again.  I will certainly use less lemon juice the next time.

Pretty good and relatively easy to make! Based on the other reviews I had seen, I doubled the peanut butter and went slightly light on the curry powder. I also cut the chicken into approximately inch thick strips and cooked it in the oven for about 15 minutes at 325 degrees. Recipe was tasty but, like some others have said, a little bland.

I used half the amount of sugar, sriracha for pepper sauce, doubled the peanut butter because I love it. Popped mine in the oven on 350 for 30 min.  We really enjoyed this.

I added red chili flakes and additional peanut butter as others suggested.  Also, used lime juice as opposed to lemon. I only had time to marinate for less than an hour and a half and it was awesome.  This is a keeper.

Everyone who has this at our place asks for the recipe!  I mean everyone!!!  We use boneless skinless chicken thighs - much prefer to chicken breadt. The dark meat seems to absorb the flavours more so.

The flavor was pretty good but I couldn't really tell because it was WAY too salty.  I even used low sodium soy sauce.  I prepared it exactly as directed with just a little more peanut butter.

I put everything else in it, except the hot sauce and the peanut butter and let the chicken sit in that.  Then, make the marinade again, separately, adding the peanutbutter to that..sans hot sauce, unless you really want the extra kick, for dipping the cooked chicken in.  Other than that this is a good recipe!

I haven't tried this recipe, although I find a tasty addition to satay chicken would be to add some sesame oil and possibly omit the curry powder.

I followed this recipe as written. It's a very good Thai dish, however, it tastes nothing like any Thai  Satay that we've ever had. Not what we expected, but still very tasty. I will be making this again! I think it would great in Pad Thai noodles. Thanks for submitting.

This is an easy recipe, and my guests raved about it. I used chicken tenderloins, one per skewer, which is fast and easy.  I nuked the marinade and it thickened beautifully and it made a delicious sauce.

Followed the recipe as written except for cutting back the soy sauce to 1/3 cup, after reading other reviews.  I'm so glad I tasted the marinade before putting it on the chicken because it was incredibly salty.  Too salty to even try to correct with other ingredients.

I did not like this sauce at all--it just tasted like soy sauce and lime juice. I had to add way more peanut butter, and then some coconut milk, to attempt to save it.

Loved it.  I let my chicken breasts marinate all afternoon and then we grilled them whole.  They were so tender and juicy.  My husband even took some for left overs. He is not a left over guy.

Tastes more Indian than Thai. I suggest reducing the amount of curry and lemon/lime juice.

I followed the recipe for the sauce exactly only scaled down to 1/3 and doubled the peanut butter.  Then I let chicken tenders marinate for about 7-8 hours and baked them.  I realized after I made it that others suggested the soy made it too salty, but I just let it be.  Once it was baked, I didn't mind it at all.  I definitely will grill them next time as I think that would only make them better.

I found this dish to be amazingly tasty, and the inclusion of the onions in the peanut butter sauce gave a great texture. My room mates and friends loved it! I will definitely make it again!

Awefully salty, though.  Low sodium soy sauce will help a lot.

Too cut down on the salt, I ALWAYS use low sodium soy sauce!  Huge difference!!  Made exactly as written, but a way too lemony.  Will use coconut milk in place of the lemon juice and just a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.  It makes all of the difference if you serve with a peanut saute/sauce on the side!!!

It's not the best I've ever had but it did taste good. It was a tiny bit on the salty side but I did marinate the meat for more than 24 hours.

i really wanted chicken satay, but didn't have a grill or a set of skewers handy. so i followed the recipe exactly, let the chicken marinade overnight, and come the next day i grilled in a frying pan with a tsp of olive oil. surprisingly the chicken still came out very juicy!

"I" liked it.  The kids, not so much.  I've made it at the BBQ.  Some really loved it, others turned away.  It is potent.  I'll make it again, but just a smaller portion.  Thanks!

I tweaked the recipe as many other reviewers suggested....reduced amount of curry, etc. I baked in a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes (I used chicken cut in strips). This was easy, fast and tasty. I'll serve it again - great weeknight meal.

My family liked this a lot with a few changes. I increased the peanut butter to 4 tablespoons and decreased the soy sauce to 1/4 cup. I served the chicken in warm pitas topped with chopped cucumbers and red onions that I had tossed in a little salt, lime juice and honey. Yum!

This is a keeper.  The marinade is very flavorful.  I did not use skewers and instead grilled them on a small George Foreman grill and they came out perfect.  Next time I will double the recipe.

VERY GOOD base to work from.  Soaked the chicken in lime/soy/garlic mixture then made the sauce (items from original recipe plus a T of fish sauce and sub'd green curry paste for the curry) seperate for dipping when finished.  Soaked the skewers in soy sauce/warm water combo to add just a touch more flavor. Served w/ rice and veggie stir-fry to complete meal. I know some people can't stand when someone comes in a totally alters the recipe but hey I am known to be an alterer ;o)  Thank you for the recipe. :o)

This was great!  Had people over for dinner and everyone raved over it!  Followed others comments and added double the peanut butter and used 1/2 of the soy and curry that was called for, but am wondering what it would be like with all of the soy, I'm a fan of it.  Will definately make again!

I simmered the marinade to make a sauce for this and found it was really too salty.  Overall a pretty good recipe though, might make again.  (I also used less citrus than the recipe called for which was probably a good idea.)

I cooked this up for a potluck dinner the weekend and the guests raved about  Even when I opened the tupperware container to get it ready to cook the guests noticed the great smell of this dish! 
I did make some alterations as per other reviewers.
-Used half the lemon 
-Used 4 cloves of garlic
-Used chunky instead of smooth peanut butter because that is what I had on hand and took the chunks out with a Braun mixer.  It left a good texture.
-Sliced the chicken into thin strips and threaded on the shorter bamboo skewers.
-Because of the venue, I had to pan fry the chicken in two skillets for about 15 minutes, turning twice.  It came out very tender with lots of flavour. 
This Chicken Satay recipe is definately a keeper. Thankyou.

Very, very nice. Followed recipe but with no grill available, used the oven broiler. Turned the skewers a few times - came out perfect.
2nd time - used the grill. Warning - if using wooden skewers, make sure you soak them for a long time so they don't burn up on th grill.

The marinade was easy to prepare, although next time I'll use less curry powder.  I saved time by buying a bottled peanut sauce.

I've had this in my recipe box for ages. I finally made it for our last barbecue of the summer. I used lime juice and marinated the chicken overnight. I think I would reduce the lime juice a little bit next time. My guests thoroughly enjoyed this and asked me why I didn't make more. Many Thanks.

This wasn't very good.  It was awful.  I even soaked it all nite.  Even after doctoring with extra soy, cilantro, curry, garlic, and soy sauce in the marinade, it was truly missing a lot.  The usual depth of Thai flavor wasn't there.  No good.  Not sure where it should go from here..

This was way too salty! I reduced the lemon juice to 1/4 cup and the soy sauce to 1/3 cup, as per other reviewers. I cooked it in the marinade and served over rice, but the saltiness was overwhelming, though it cooked really well. Even the neutral flavor of the rice didn't help. If I tried it again I wouldn't marinade it as long and would try to 'tone down' the saltiness.

This recipe was too salty. There was much too strong of a soy sauce flavor.  My husband and I felt it was missing something... it really needs coconut milk.  I would recommend the, "easy chicken satay" recipe instead, that one was wonderful and tasted like the restaurant version.

This was excellent, if there were more stars I would give it more.  I made the sauce according to recipe, but I baked the dish in the oven for 30min.  Next time I will use less lemon juice.... personal preference.  Other than that I would change a thing.  I used Chalula hot sauce giving it a medium heat.  My wife is not a big fan of a lot of spice and this was perfect for her.

Awesome and easy. I marinated 24 hours then broiled approximately 5 minutes per side (it's too cold here in Michigan to be outside grilling right now).  Skewered them post broiling and served with hot peanut sauce from this site. Was a big hit at our monthly girls night!

This was pretty good.  I doubled the sauce as previously suggested, and if I make it again I will cut back on the lime juice.  I thought it was way too citrusy.  My hubby really liked it though!

This was very salty for our taste and didn't quite have the peanut taste I was hoping for.  I would definitely increase the amount of peanut butter and decrease the lemon juice.

This was unbelieveably good. I marinaded the chicken for about 8 hours, and was worried it wouldn't be flavorfull enough; I was wrong - it was absolutely perfect. I didn't have time to make any peanut sauce, and it really didn't matter. I also saved time byt doing them on the Foreman grill. Perfect. Awesome recipe. Thanks so much, Keira!

When I told my husband I was making this recipe, he asked if there was curry in it and he turned up his nose at the answer, but I went ahead and made it anyways.  He liked it! I marinated the chicken for 4 hours and it grilled up moist, not dry.  I served with Best Peanut Sauce.  I will definitely make again.

Mmmm...delicious.  I followed the advice of previous reviewers and marinated the chicken overnight which made the chicken SO flavorful!  I used a george foreman grill, and they turned out great.  These are really best served right off of the grill (put about half in the oven to keep warm and they dried out very quickly), but overall I was HIGHLY pleased with this recipe.  I will be making this again, thanks!

I made these the other day and was worried that my husband would not like it....but he almost couldn't wait until he got them off of the grill....it was a hit with my young kids and with me and my husband!! I did add extra peanut butter and had to put it into my blender to make it creamy.....Also, I didn't skewer them...instead I cut them into decent sized chunks....left them for two days (almost forgot about it) and then we grilled them....oh so delish!!

The sauce is an excellent marinade!  I made this with seitan/wheat meat, a vegan alternative to chicken, and it was spectacular!

My husband and kids really liked this recipe.  The marinade is easy to put together and the taste is great.  I served this with jasmine rice and a cucumber salad.  We will definitely have this again.

I cut the chicken in strips instead of chunks for better presentation. Guests raved about it.
So easy to do.

As per the advice of others, I diluted the soy sauce & lime juice with water by 1/2. It was still so very overpowering. I kept adding brown sugar & peanut butter to sweeten it up. I also omitted curry powder since my husband hates it. We didn't miss it. I also made another batch for dipping sauce. I also grilled the skewers on my George Foreman, & they turned out great.

Abolutely fabulous.  The peanut butter doesn't dissolve into the other marinade ingredients that well, but it doesn't matter.  Do the best mixing job you can and the taste is fabulous.  My kids liked it, too.

WAY WAY WAY too salty!  I wish I had at least halved the amount of soy sauce--I kept adding more and more peanut butter and lemon juice and just about everything I could think of (I even added coconut milk) to try to tone down the salt a bit, but nothing seemed to work.  Other than that I think it would have a nice flavor though--can't say, my taste buds got overwhelmed pretty fast with all the salt.

These were so easy and yummy. I threw them in the fridge to marinate before work and when my husband came home he cooked the rice and grilled them. That was 2 days ago and I think I'm gonna make them again this weekend. Yummy!!!!

This recipe was incredibly easy and tasted delicions.  I left out the MSG and it was fab.  I did have a hard time mixing in the peanut butter, but a min or two in the blender with the rest of the marinade did the trick.

I haven't had much luck lately in the recipes I've tried. This one falls in to that category. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything that great either. My husband says he would add more hot pepper sauce or cayenne to pep it up a bit.

This was tender, juicy and had a wonderful flavor.  I used a spicy store bought peanut sauce and watered it down with soy sauce and lemon juice the marinade.  I used the peanut sauce staight from the bottle for a dip.  Awesome!

I cooked my chicken in a pan.
I think the sauce is pretty nasty tasting.
I wouldn't try it again.

I've made this dish for family, friends and co-workers.  It's WONDERFUL!  Everyone loves it and there are never any leftovers.  People keep coming back for more.  Try with onions and red and green peppers for added color and flavor.  Delicious!

good recipe - i put the chicken on skewers to serve as an appetizer; it comes out a little dry (may want to serve with a satay sauce) and the curry definitely gives the kitchen an interesting aroma.

This was soooo good! I love the flavor and it has a genuine Thai taste to it! Chicken Satay is my 7 yr old's FAVE thai dish so it's kid friendly. I think I might add a little more brown sugar but overall this is a GREAT recipe!!!!

This recipe was very flavorful.  I marinated chicken tenderloins overnight then grilled them the next evening.  Next time, I will add a few extra tablespoons of brown sugar.
