Good basic recipe but cooked the cream; cream cheese sugar and egg yolks over boiling water. Stirred in the chocolate; plus I added 1/2 cup chocolate hazelnut spread.

Oh I would give this recipe a four. I wasn't quite CRAZY about it it's not as firm as a cheesecake but hey it's a mousse. But I do like it and my son REALLY likes it and wants me to make it again! Hey any recipe that a picky 12 year old likes...go full force! he he!
