After I removed the bacon from the cast iron skillet, I left some of the bacon fat in the skillet and sauteed the beans, onion and a little fresh minced garlic in the bacon fat with a pat butter, added some fresh ground pepper and let it cook until the onions started to turn translucent. I then poured over the chicken broth and simmered. We LOVED these green beans. My husband said that these reminded him of beans his Dad made for him growing up, he was quite upset there weren't any more. Next time, I'll double the recipe.

We love green beans with bacon and onion.  I did this recipe a little different though.  Fry up the bacon, remove and drain all the grease from the pan except what clings to the pan.  Add the onions and saute them in the little bit of bacon fat - add the garlic and cook for just a minute or two then add the green beans and the chicken broth.  Use the broth to deglaze the bacon goodness from the bottom of the pan.  Cover and cook until tender.  Plate the green beans and sprinkle with the reserved bacon.   (The juice from the green beans is excellent added to gravy if you are making gravy.)  This way you save the calories from the butter and only mess up one pan.

There are any number of ways this can be prepared, so do what works for you. In my case, I cooked the beans in boiling water for about five minutes while I sauteed the bacon, onions and garlic. Drained the beans, added them to the pan with the bacon/onion mixture and tossed until coated. Cooking these for 15-20 minutes would be far too long, at least for my liking.

I make this dish often every summer as I always have a bumper crop of beans.  At least once I really splurge and make it the old farmers way.  Brown the bacon, remove bacon, discard all but 2 tablespoons of bacon fat (so would not use the butter in this recipe), saute the onions in the bacon grease and then add the bacon and the rest of the ingredients and cook until the beans are tender.  The bacon grease really does add a sinfully good flavor.  I only do that once or twice a summer.  The rest of the time I make it as this recipe directs using Smart Balance margarine.  It's really a wonderful veggie side dish.

Oh my these were delicious!  I followed recipe exactly (used bag of Real Bacon Pieces instead of cooking bacon to save time) and the family gobbled them down.  Next time I will leave the extra salt out and let the bacon and broth do their job... so tasty and easy!

We love this recipe!!! Reminds me of the green beans at Texas Roadhouse. :-)  To save time I use a bag of Real Bacon pieces. Also, the longer it sets the better the flavor and the beans still stay somewhat crunchy. Definitely a family favorite!!!

These beans are fantastic. I deglazed pan after frying the bacon with half the butter, onion and garlic then added the rest of the ingredients.  Covered and cooked for about 18 min and the beans were still crisp.  Love beans with bacon and garlic.  I use my kitchen shears to cut up the raw bacon and fry it like that, it cooks faster and it is already crumbled like this. Thank You for the recipe.

Didn't use the bacon but love this.  Also we used turkey broth... it was much better than just plain water boiled.  Not as good as another green bean recipe I have but I'd do it again and again.

This was delicious!!!!!  I originally made it as a gluten free side dish for my mother, but that pan was quickly devoured by everyone and I had to make a second huge batch, hoping to have some left overs for lunch.  They finished that pan off too!!!!!!!!  You know it's recipe gold when that happens!!!!!   I love that it's a new way to get my kids to eat their fresh green beans.  Thank you so much for sharing xoxoxoxoxoxo

I used all the same ingredients but changed up the cooking method. After steaming the green beans I rinsed them in cold water to cool and then drained. While I was doing that, I sautéed the onions in the butter and the seasonings then added the chicken broth. Once combined, I added the green beans and heated through. Before serving, I topped with the crumbled up pre-cooked bacon so it would still be crispy. I also had some grated Parmesan cheese on the table which some chose to use. We loved this recipe and a great winter comfort food. Definitely a keeper.

I made this as written b/c I was short on time and kitchen space. As is, it was tasty but way too salty and fatty. I used 3 pieces of bacon, which was about double what I needed! Next time I'll use 1-1.5 pieces. Next time I'll also follow what other reviewers did, and saute the onions, garlic, and green beans in the bacon pan with a pat of butter (not half a stick!) before adding the broth and simmering. The onion/garlic flavor was completely missing this time. And for my taste I'll cut the salt in half.

Have made this recipe many times and have varied it.
*When I have no real bacon hand, will use bacon bits.
*I decrease the butter by half, double the onions and garlic (I like spicy food), omit regular salt and replace with season salt.
*replace half the broth or all the broth with white cooking wine.
*For extra spicy will ad Old Bay seasoning and tobacco
*Cut up tomatoes and place in pan
Then simmer to your desired preference.

Delicious green beans!  I sauteed the onion and garlic in some of the bacon grease, then added the other ingredients to the skillet, only dirtying one pan.  I only used about 1 TBSP butter.

Great recipe. I think next time I try it I'll half the butter as they turned out a little greasier than I prefer, but that's just personal taste.

These were fantastic -- AND so easy!  We sauteed the onions in the bacon grease, tossed in the beans and garlic and sauteed fr just a bit before adding the broth to simmer.  Didn't add the salt and used just a pat of butter. Really good, simple, but kinda fancy too.  Served with prime rib and baked potato w/cheddar bisquits for friends' Christmas gathering.  Very nice combo.

I have making this recipe for years, which I learned from my mother. What I do different; while bacon is cooking add the garlic n onions (don't drain bacon grease, only if you have a lot). Omit the butter, you don't need it. I also add mushrooms. Use 1/2 cup chicken broth. Sprinkle with almonds. Delicious!!

I initially left out the salt thinking the bacon would be enough.  but I ended up adding it plus some garlic powder and onion powder to taste. it was awesome.

YUM!  I basically followed the directions but didn't add the bacon until they were served, as we like it crumbly not soft.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

My family loved them! They were a nice change to just steaming them. I did not use all the butter she called for, I only used a pat and some of the reserved bacon grease. I will definitely make them again ??

I usually double this recipe and I use a bag of already trimmed fresh green beans from Costco.  I stick the Bacon in the Freezer for about 30 min before chopping, so it's easier to cut into small pieces.  I brown the bacon in a pan, then add shallots (instead of onions) and some fresh garlic.  I remove everything from the pan and add the green beans in with the butter and a little olive oil.  I cook until their cooked but still a little crisp, then add the other ingredients back into the pan and season with salt and pepper.  I didn't include the chicken broth.

This is the only way to make my southern green beans.  I too left some bacon fat in pan when adding the onions and garlic.  The chicken broth gives the green beans a nice subtle flavor.

Very good. I made it using the skillet method of Sarah Jo. Make sure you drain almost all of the bacon grease before you put in the beans. Also, I added about twice as much broth as called for, so they would simmer better in a skillet. Also, we prefer our green beans on the softer side, so we let them cook an extra 10 minutes or so.

Everyone liked this. I left out the salt as I felt there was enough in the bacon. I threw everything but the broth in the pot and cooked on medium-low for 10 minutes, then added the broth and cooked 5 more minutes.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner and it was definitely a hit with everyone. My only variation was using 1/4 cup of liquid from the turkey instead of chicken broth. I used an electric skillet because I doubled the recipe. I've will make this again!

Amazing!! Made this for Easter dinner. Tired of the bland, steamed version and my husband isn't crazy about the Campbell's Green Bean casserole. My timing was off so my beans were a little more overlooked than we like but the flavor was spot on! Not sure I'll make green beans any other way. Thank you for sharing!

This was wonderful, and I hate when people rate the recipe when they changed things, but *sigh*, I changed things slightly. I saved the cooked bacon until the green beans were done and then crumbled on before serving (so the bacon was still crispy), and I must have used about 3/4 a cup of chopped onion, I used 1 and a half cloves of garlic, and I used a full cup of chicken broth - half a cup to start and then the other half halfway through cooking because the pot looked a little low on fluid. They turned out great! Definitely a keeper.

Perfect in every way!  I make this recipe at least once a week while the beans are fresh in the garden.  My kids groan anytime I make beans a different way.  I follow the recipe exactly.

I used half the butter and these still turned out great. My four and two year-olds were not fans, but they like instant mashed potatoes, so what do they know?
