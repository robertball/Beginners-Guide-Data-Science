This recipe is known in my family as "Butterscotch Bubble Loaf".  We have been making it for years.  We don't add raisins, but I will have to try it that way sometime.  Some people make this recipe with refrigerated or frozen biscuits, I think it tastes far better made with frozen roll dough like Rhodes.

This is soooo easy n long has been our family favorite.  Especially if young ones plop the hard frozen rolls in a pan the night before n think you are CRAZY!  They fluff up overnight n become a delicacy!  Don’t be tempted to “add a roll or two extra” or they will overflow onto your counter.
Our recipe calls for “non instant” butterscotch pudding.......it’s becoming crazy difficult to find.
Has anyone tried this with the instant butterscotch pudding?
Hate to mess with “perfect”

I'm a Pastry Cook and I made this after a friend asked me to make Sticky Buns. This recipe is quick, easy, and tastes like it was made at a Bakery. I doubled all ingredients except the rolls and used the "oven proof" method to speed up the process. They were perfect!

Make sure you have a big enough pan because it rises a lot

This is my 3rd or 4th Christmas making this. Initially I put in more buns because I had way more buns in my frozen pack, 2nd year I was so tired and forgot the towel. But this year, 20buns (I know I know you said 18, I will go with 18 next year) and remembered the towel. Lol 
It always turns out...
