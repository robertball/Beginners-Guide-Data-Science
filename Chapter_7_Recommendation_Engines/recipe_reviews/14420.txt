The spices in this dish are wonderful.  Any left overs work great on icecream.  Our family rates this "Make again soon!".

I liked this a lot!  I changed the fruit a bit using peaches, raspberries and bananas.  Yummmm!

Wow. I'm not particularly into peaches - I can take them or leave them, but I do like berries a lot.
I'm not all that fond of honey either, and I didn't even know what cardamom was - just a name to me.
But put them all together like this, and it was very tasty. It was even better after being in the fridge for a while, when some juice collected at the bottom of the bowl. I should have tried it as suggested ("on pancakes, waffles or French toast"), but I just had it all by itself, a bowl at a time for dessert.
I'll recommend this dish to The Woman I Love. Thanks for a nice surprise.

Sorry:(  My daughter and I both love fruit in any form.  We just couldn't hang with this cardamom spice.  We will keep looking, but the rest of you all enjoy:)

OMG!  I love cardamom, and it never occurred to me to put it on fruit.  This recipe is delicious; I wouldn't change a thing.  Thank you for sharing!

I liked the honey and cadamon... I'd never used cadamon before and this introduced me to a wonderful new spice.

Brought this to a picnic over the summer and everyone loved it!  Sweetening it with honey really seemed to add a special touch.

This salad puts a nice twist on the plain fruit salad.  I put half the called for cardamom and a little more honey and it fit our tastes really nicely.  I also added the bananas that another reviewer mentioned and it was a good choice! Thank you!

Tried salad with fresh peaches but I never seem to get the ripe ones.  So next time I used canned peaches & mandarin oranges along with fresh berries & it tasted GREAT. You can experiment with fresh & canned of various fruits to find the combination that you like.

I did not have any cardamom so I used nutmeg and cinammon.  I also substituted the peaches for nectarines (don't like peaches except in peach cobbler) and it was fabulous.  I served it in a martini glass and put Fage 0% greek yogurt on the bottom, layer of the fruit, and sprimkled fresh granola on top!!!

Simple and delicious!  Peaches, blackberries, and raspberries with honey and cardamom dressing over vanilla ice cream.  YUM!  Perfect for a summer dessert.

I added blueberries and only used two peaches. It was so easy and delicious!
