The combination of raspberries, marionberries, and blueberries for the frozen mixed berries plus the cranberries was a little too tart for me, so I did add a light squeeze of honey.  I couldn't taste the almond milk at all, and although this was an OK smoothie, I really missed the creaminess that yogurt brings.  Next time, I will add some vanilla Greek yogurt, and I'm sure that will bring this up to a 5-star rating for my taste preference.

This was pretty and had a good base flavor. It was just a tad too tart for my taste with the cranberries. I found that with another cranberry smoothie too though. I did a mix of strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry. I blended them well with the almond milk first, to break down any of the raspberry seeds. I also had to use all frozen fruit as that is what I have. That avoided the refrigeration afterwards, anyway. I made a 1/2 recipe and tried it with the half of banana as suggested. I ended up adding the whole banana, which helped with the tartness. This was very healthy. ty Mottsbella

A great use for those leftover cranberries from Thanksgiving recipes. I used regular milk , frozen banana and frozen blueberries (more than 1/2 cup) to make a great balance between sweet and tart. Using frozen fruit eliminates having to waiting for this drink. With these changes  the rating would be a 5.

I made this recipe and it was good. But after I added 1/2 cup of vanilla low fat Greek yogurt it gave it another kick. The yogurt gives it a creamy taste and if you're like me trying to cut back on sweets, it stratifies that ice cream craving. Only thing I don't like is the berry chunks even after blending other than that great recipe.

This is a delicious smoothie that is a little less sweet than some, which suits me fine. I wish I had a frozen banana instead of a  room temperature one, so it would be a little thicker, but I'll plan better next time. I like that there is no added sweetener here, if you get unsweetened almond milk, and I like the cranberries, which are good for you, but not incorporated in many drinks in non-cranberry cocktail form. Thanks!

I think you have to really like cranberries for this.  I didn't tell my daughter it was any different from other smoothies and she took one drink and said, Yuck! I drank mine but I was ready for it to be gone. I even added a little oat to tame it down a little.

Will definitely make again.  I added 1/2 cup greek yogurt and a squirt or two of honey.  Increased the frozen fruit (strawberries and blueberries).  Also used vanilla almond milk.  Will definitely make again and try different tweaks.
