This recipe is great! I must admit i'm not a huge bean salad person, but this is changing my mind. I ommitted the dill and used normal onions andg garlic which i sauteed. I also added pinapple and black beans. The pineapple made the garbanzo beans pop really well! This is most definietly a family favorite from now on.

This recipe is very refreshing!  I made this as a last-minute addition to our meal, and it took no time to put together.  This recipe is very amenable to modifications - we put in an extra tbsp of pasta sauce, 2 tbsp of rice vinegar, parsley, and sundried tomatoes and didn't use celery and dill, and it turned out great.  The vinegar is essential b/c otherwise the garlic and onions taste too raw.  We might try sauteeing the garlic and onions first next time.  Would definitely make this again... could be a great entertaining dish.

I really only made it to use up some pasta sauce. It was ok, but there are better chick pea recipes out there. Thanks anyway.

I had never done anything with Garbanzo beans & happened upon this recipe. Me and my boyfriend really enjoyed it. I used cucumbers instead of celery & halfed the amount of dill because it seemed like alot. It was zesty - great sidedish for summer.

I tried this because I had the ingredients on hand and it was so low fat. I found it very disappointing. The vinegar and onions were overpowering and the combination of beans and dill was very odd. There are better bean salad out there. Sorry.

Very good and refreshing.  I sauteed the onions, celery and garlic until just tender and refrigerated overnight.

This salad got rave reviews from my friends, who didn't realize that garbanzo beans are the same as chick peas.  And quite easy to make, too.

Pretty good. I added twice the vinegar than the recipe called for and liked it that way.
