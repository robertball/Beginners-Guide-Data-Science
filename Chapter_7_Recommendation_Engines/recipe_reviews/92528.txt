SO EASY AND SO GOOD!  I made a few modifications:  Using a 7.25lb Bone-in Turkey Breast I layered the bottom of my crockpot with 3 cut-up celery stalks, one sweet yellow onion, 1/4 cup chicken broth, and 1/2 tbsp. minced garilc.  I placed the turkey breast on top of the celery and onion, rubbed the turkey inside and out with the onion soup packet (lifting up the skin on top of the breast and adding the seasoning right on the meat works great!), also rubbed some oregano, sage, thyme, and 1/2 tbsp minced garlic on the breast.  Drizzled the breast with 1 tbsp. melted butter.  Cooked on high 1 hour, low for 7 hours more.  Perfect moist turkey!  Smells and tastes great, plenty of leftovers for sandwiches, casseroles, or enchiladas!  Will be a simple cold-weather staple for me.

Excellent!! I made this tonight on a whim.  I was going to grill our 6.5 lb turkey breast, but thought I'd give this a try.

The only thing I really did differently was smear a couple of pats of butter on the inside of my slow cooker ( as some suggested) and I used dry herb and garlic soup mix that I had on hand.

There is little preparation, I started the procedure at 7 am and didn't turn the cooker off until 4 pm   and left it on warm for 1-1/2 hours while I got busy with other things.

This turkey breast browned nicely near the edges and lightly on top, it fell apart as I took it out and there was plenty of delicious juice in the pot.  

The meat was succulent, with a melt in your mouth quality.  I didn't have time to make gravy out of the juice, so I just set it out as it was; it was wonderful on the turkey and potatoes I served. No additional seasoning needed at all.

As a working mom, this was a godsend, and my husband and teenage children were very very pleased with the results (all, including me, were VERY skeptical at first)turkey breast in a slow cooker...ewww.

I'm going to share this recipe with my friends, it seems wrong not to.

I like to put just enough water to cover the bottom of the crockpot. Place the turkey in, surround it with quartered onions and carrots, brush the bird with melted butter and then season it well. This makes a delicious turkey breast and I use the leftover turkey breast for casseroles, etc. in the future as it freezes well. The broth can be strained and used as well. Thank you.

This was so easy and came out absolutely delish! I think I'll make this regularly to have turkey for sandwiches during the week -- way better than cold cuts and you don't have to do the whole Thanksgiving turkey thing to get it!  This would also be a great way to make extra white meat for a holiday when you're worried that your turkey won't be enough.  I put about a half a cup of white wine in the bottom of the crock pot, added some thickly sliced carrots, a sliced onion, about 4 stalks of choppped celery and a couple garlic cloves.  Added salt and pepper, placed the turkey breast on top, with the onion soup spread on it and under the skin and cooked it on low for 8 hours.  When it was done, I sauteed some mushrooms (4 containers:  two each Baby Bellas and shitakes, sliced), onion and garlic in a little olive oil and butter in a skillet, then added 1/2 cup white wine and about 2 cups of the broth from the crock pot.  I brought that to a boil and mixed another half cup of broth with a couple tablespoons corn starch to make a "slurry".  I added that to the skillet and it was so delicious over the turkey! Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is wonderful!  I did not know you could cook turkey breast in a slow cooker like this.  If you're like me, you'll probably be tempted to add stock or liquid to the meat -- DON'T!  Believe me there'll be plenty of wonderful juices to make gravy from.  If you just don't feel comfortable cooking it dry you can add about 1 Tbsp of melted butter (which is what I did) and you'll be totally happy with the result.  Instead of using bone-in breast I used a piece of cut-off breast meat and it's still plenty yummy!  Great for making sandwich or salad turkey meat.  Try this recipe if you don't feel like turning on the oven and heating up the kitchen and potentially trying your bird.

This was my first turkey I've ever made and it turned out great. I am cooking for two so I used a 3 lb boneless turkey breast. I forgot to buy the dry onion soup mix so I spinkled onion powder and Italian seasoning on the turkey breast. I cooked for 1 hour on high and then left it on low for another 3 hours and it turned out perfectly! I will definitely be making it this way again.

Moist and very tasty.  I will be cooking many more turkey breasts in my slow cooker.  It is August and it is too hot to cook.  This is another good recipe that doesn't heat up the kitchen.  I cooked a 7 lb. breast and used onion powder, marjoram, garlic pepper, dried parsley and salt. As someone suggested, I put a few pats of butter in the cooker.  My slow cooker only heats from the bottom, so I didn't want the meat to stick before the drippings were released.  I cooked mine 3 hours on high. I will be using this for turkey enchiladas, sandwiches, and just as is.  No more turkey cold cuts for me.  This is too easy and tastes a zillion times better.

I am totally amazed at the 'brilliance' of those who 'review' a recipe after adding (in one case 9) so many ingredients that it doesn't even resemble the simple and delicious recipe that was shared!  Get real folks....send in your own recipe and leave the others alone!!!!!!!

This recipe was a lifesaver for me! I'm living on an island outside the US and had to drive 40 miles just to buy a frozen turkey breast, expecting to roast it in the oven for guests Thanksgiving evening. On Thanksgiving morning, I discovered we had no gas for the oven. So I found this recipe, had the onion mix on hand, and put it all in the slow cooker. Seven hours later, I had a perfectly cooked turkey breast. Perfect for nervous first-time Thanksgiving hostesses!!

This was excellent.  Made it for a dinner party and every person there asked me how I did it.  I accidently set the crockpot to high and noticed 4 hours later when the turkey was done! I turned it to keep warm and left the turkey in there for another 3 hours. turned out great but good to know you can cook bird faster in a pinch.

This is simple and delicious, and certainly not rocket science--no need to really add anything or change anything other than the cooking time. Rub the turkey breast all over with a couple tablespoons of butter before adding the onion soup. Mine was done perfectly at 5-1/2 hours, so for those who complained this was dry it was only because the meat was cooked too long, and an instant read meat thermometer might be helpful--you want the temperature to read around 170 degrees. For a lovely pan gravy, strain the drippings into a saucepan with some chicken stock mixed with cornstarch and cook till thickened. The meat is tender, juicy, and delicately seasoned by the onion soup mix, which also lent a nice flavor to the gravy. Since there are just the two of us, we had beautiful slices of turkey breast leftover for sandwiches, as well as the carcass which I froze to make turkey soup. Update 3/16/09: I used a much smaller turkey breast this time, about 4-1/2 pounds, and at 5-1/2 hours it still was past the 170 degrees I wanted.  I think I've got this figured out now and from now on I'm going to use the rule of thumb to cook on low for slightly less than an hour for each pound of turkey breast.

Very moist.  Had I known turkey breast could be cooked so moist I'd have made it many times over.  I rubbed turkey with olive oil before the onion soup and put a little white wine and a dash of Maggi in the pot.  Who knew it could be so easy!

Help!! I was so excited to try this. Is the problem with slow cookers that do or do not have a heating element on the sides? How could I go wrong w/just a turkey breast and dry onion? I'm still a novice . After 7 hrs. on low, my turkey was as dry as could be and all the juice filled my 7 qt more than halfway. I would have prefered the juice inside the turkey. Any comments aprpeciated..I really needed this recipe. THanks

5 stars for the cooking method alone!   I have been using this recipie for a while now but just now getting around to rating it.  I am not a fan of onion soup mix so my take on this is to rub the breast in butter, season with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning and lay it on a bed of chopped onion and celery.   I also add a cup of chicken broth, and by doing this I get a yield of about 4 cups of perfectly seasoned broth(with veggies) in the end ..that is fabulous for adding to your fav dry stuffing mix and/or strain some and make gravy with it!  Throw it all in the slow cooker and have Thanksgiving like dinner at your finger tips when you get home.  It's a no fail recipie! I will never roast another turkey breast.  My boys smile from ear to ear when they see me starting this in the morning.. because they know their dinner will be sublime.  Thankyou for the wonderful idea ms_sally!

This was great, but due to the new gov't regulated temperatures on the slow cookers, it needs to be cooked for a shorter amount of time.  Low is 200 degrees, high is 300.  The old temps were 185 and 212 respectively I believe.  So, if you cook this for 7-9 hours, even on low depending on the size, you will overcook it, and it will be dry.  This goes for most of your old slow cooker recipes if you have a slow cooker made in the last five years.  You should make this on a weekend, and check the temperature as you go to see when it comes to the safer temperature of 165.  Then you will have an accurate guage of how hot your slow cooker is cooking at.

Delicious!  I've never had turkey this tender!  And no, you don't need any liquid!  Just make sure your slow cooker insert allows for dry cooking.  My old KitchenAid slow cooker insert cracked both times I was making this.  It worked out just fine in a cast aluminum insert.  HINT:  You can make your own onion soup mix!   8 tsp. dry minced onion 2 tsp. onion powder 4 tsp. beef bouillon or 4 cubes Black pepper (optional)

Believe it or not but I take my turkey breast directly out of the freezer and put it in the crock pot for about 10 hours or so.  I put onoins, carrots, paprika salt and pepper.  It is so tender and so versitile.

This is an excellent way to prepare a small turkey.  Using a 5lb boneless breast, I cooked it on high 3 hours and on low for 2 hours, inserting a meat thermometer every so often.  I altered the recipe a bit: 1/2 cup turkey broth on the bottom of the cooker produces a rich, delicious broth fit for gravy.  I covered the turkey with virgin olive oil and rubbed on salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning (no onion soup).  This was the moistest turkey and so very tender.  Absolutely perfect!  Rave comments from every guest at the table.  This is the only way I'll prepare turkey from now on.  Fool-proof!

Just reference for anyone with a smaller weight breast.  Put a 2.5 lb boneless breast in a rival crockpot on low (10hr) setting only, and it had a pop up timer which was great so I could actually see when it was finished cooking, and it took exactly 3 hours and ten minutes.

This has been a famuily favorite for years. The only thing I do different is to add a can of cranberry sauce, pouring it over the turkey before I start the slow cooker. It makes the most delicious gravy, all ready to serve when the turkey is done.

This is a wonderful recipe.  The only way I will do a turkey breast from now on.  I used a Honeysuckle White turkey breast with the gravy packet inside the cavity.  I did Pam spray the inside of my 6-quart slow cooker.  I used a 7.5 lb. turkey breast and cooked it for 1 hr. 15 min. on High and 7 hr. and 15 min. on Low.  The meat was tender and moist.  I didn't have much falling off the bone and the breasts sliced beautifully.  The gravy that came from the juices was delicious. There will be about an inch or two of turkey juices left in the slow cooker after you remove the turkey breast.  Pour them off into a large saucepan.  Whisk all the ingredients listed below together and then pour into the large saucepan with the turkey juices.  Whisk constantly over med.-high heat until it boils.  2 c. water, 9 T. Wondra flour for sauces and gravy, the gravy packet that comes in the turkey breast cavity, 14.5 oz. can Swanson's lower sodium chicken broth, 1 T. Kitchen Bouquet, black pepper, to taste.  Note: If you prefer, you can just add all the gravy ingredients to the slow cooker.  Cover and turn to HIGH.  It will take the gravy about 1-1/2 hours to come to a boil.

You can avoid buttering the crock pot by putting 3 or 4 balls of crumpled aluminum foil on the bottom of your crock pot.  This lifts the turkey and prevents any sticking.

I have cooked turkey breasts this way for quite awhile now.  I also have added some store bought stuffing and put it in the bottom of the crockpot, put cram of mushroom soup over the stuffing and placed the turkey breast with seasonings on top and then cooked all day.  Delicioso, just like turkey and stuffing and very moist.

First, let me state that I am a lazy cook. I admit it. So this recipe excited me! Two ingredients and a crockpot. What could be better. I dumped a half thawed bone-in turket breast and topped it with a package of Onion Soup mix in the CP one afternoon about 3 PM and turned the CP on Low. I let it cook all through the night and the next morning I took it out and wrapped it in foil. Just like that. That evening, I took the foil wrapped breast and plopped it in a baking pan and stuck it in the oven on 325. I let it reheat while I cooked some other stuff and played Hearts on the computer. Right before dinner I unwrapped the breast and sliced it up. My husband declared it the best turkey he'd ever eaten in our 22 years of marriage. Thanks for posting this recipe...I plan to make this a regular recipe in my personal rotation.

I've been doing turkey breast in the crock pot for years. I use cream of chicken soup or chicken broth and then make gravy for mashed potatoes. If the breast comes with a gravy packet, just dump it in too.For the novice, the breast ribs are up.

I had never thought of cooking a turkey breast in the slow cooker, and it worked GREAT!  I used a 3 lb. boneless breast on top of some carrots, celery and onions...and since I didn't have soup mix, I sprinkled it with garlic salt, onion powder, and Italian seasoning.  I did add about a cup of chicken broth, since boneless breasts don't have as much juice. Cooked it for about 6 hours.  It was juicy, delicious, and won rave reviews.

So moist and delish!  For those of you who found it turned out a little dry, the key is to put the turkey in breast down and wah-lah, moistness galore!  And yes, the skin will not be brown, but who cares?  I don't eat the skin anyway!

I tried the original recipe and found the onion soup mix gave it an artificial taste, but it was easy enough so I improvised with my own turkey rub the 2nd time.  I mixed together 1-tsp each of the following: ground sage, dried rosemary, dried thyme, garlic powder, black pepper, salt, 1/2-tsp chipotle pepper, 2-Tbsp olive oil, and rub all over the turkey breast (3-lb) including under the skin.  Then put the turkey breast in the slow cooker (sprayed with PAM), turned it on HIGH for 4 hours. There was about 1 cup of turkey juice in the pot which I de-fat and made a simple gravy.  My husband, who usually dislike turkey breast, had a 2nd helping :)

I used a 3lb. boneless turkey breast for this recipe since it's only me and the bf but it still came out tasting amazing!!  I took the breast out of it's netting, rinsed and patted dry, and rubbed it down with about 1/2 the packet of onion soup mix and about 2 tbsp. minced garlic.  In the crock pot I quartered about 5 or 6 red potatoes, threw in some green beans and chopped onions, and put about 1/2 cup of chicken broth on the bottom (next time I'll probably only put 1/4 cup).  I put the breast on top and sprinkled the remainder of the packet onto the potatoes and veggies.  Because of our small turkey I had to adjust the cooking time: 30 minutes on high, 4.5 hours on low.  It came out AWESOME!!  I gave 4 stars because I do think this recipe could use some additional herbs or something, otherwise it was great AND we had leftovers.  I'll be making this again!

I tried this recipe for this Thanksgiving and even though I tweaked it a little, I gave it 5 stars!  This was the juiciest and best-tasting turkey we have EVER had!  And, my partner really does not care for turkey, but he had seconds and raved about it all day.  I had a 7 1/2 lb. turkey breast completely thawed.  Buttered the crockpot as well as under the skin and over the breast.  I seasoned with poultry seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Placed breast side down, covered it and cooked on high for about 3 hours, then turned it down to low for another 4 hours.  Checked it and it was falling off the bone.  I had added no water to the crockpot whatsoever and I had enough broth for noodles for the two of us.  I will never cook turkey in the oven again, thanks to you!  Thank you for sharing.

I love how the title of this is SLOW cooker turkey breast but the first word in the description is QUICK..Uh not really but it's certainly easy. You'd be crazy NOT to try this recipe. So good, and you do not need to add any extra broth. I cooked this exactly how long the recipe stated and it was perfect, and I had at least 2 cups of liquidy goodness in the crockpot. I did cut a few slits in the turkey and stuff them with whole, peeled cloves of garlic. You don't even need to add the onion soup mix to the turkey. I did rub the skin with a few Tbls of butter. I also chopped up some carrots and celery and threw those in too. This turkey was so moist and so good, you'd never know it wasn't roasted in the oven. I came home from work and it was done, and in a half hour I had turkey, rolls, cranberries, mashed potatoes and stuffing on the table! Try this cooking method, you will not be sorry.***ETA: if you're looking for crisp skin, after your turkey is done, just take some skin off, lay it flat on a cookie sheet and bake it for a few minutes, it will crisp right up!! Also, I recommend spending the $2-3 on the disposable crockpot liners, it made cleanup a snap!

When I first saw this, I was skeptical, but it was actually delicious! I took other reviewers suggestions and added a can of chicken broth, some onion and celery to the bottom of the crock pot, and then I smeared a few pats of butter on the sides of the crockpot. We had a delicious dinner and now have plenty of leftovers for turkey sandwiches this week. Never thought that turkey could be a work night meal, but with this recipe it can!

Absolutely glorious! 2 ingredients, one  5-6 quart slow cooker = perfection.
You cannot ask for more. My store happened to have frozen turkey breast for .78 cent per lb this week. What a value! We ate 3 meals from the original recipe, then I made a turkey lasagna out of the leftover meat. What a savings, and very tasty. I have sent this recipe to all my family and friends. I would encourage you to try it. I will always use this method for future Thanksgivings.

I rubbed outside with butter. My turkey was too big for the lid to fit so I put foil over top instead of the lid. Worked great! Best turkey ever and it made lots of gravy! I will never make one in the oven ever again! The hardest part was getting it out of the crockpot it kept falling apart it was soooo tender!

I was a little skeptical at first about this recipe, and decided to give it a try based on many of the suggested alterations from the reviews.  I added chopped onion, garlic, celery, chicken broth and italian seasonings to the pot along with the onion soup mix and some water.  I  have to say this was absolutely the BEST turkey breast I have ever had, and I normally don't like turkey because of it's dryness.  My family adored this meal and I have vowed due to the ease of this recipe, I will be making this more often!  Try it... you won't be disappointed!!!

I made this tonight as a test run before Thanksgiving. I needed an easy recipe for a turkey breast. I didn't want to cook a whole turkey because I'm only cooking for four people. I don't cook a lot of meat so I needed a recipe that would be easy for me. I cooked a 6.5 lb turkey breast in a crockpot on low for 7 hours and it was cooked perfectly and just fell off the bone. I will be making this again for Thanksgiving.

This is a great recipe! The turkey was very moist and tender! However, it was a little bland. I followed some of the reviewers' suggestions, and rubbed the turkey with olive oil and added two tbsps of butter and extra olive oil to cover the bottom of the pan. I also sprinkled some salt and garlic powder on the turkey. The taste olive oil and butter added a great taste to the turkey. However, it was a little bland. I now have added more salt, rosemary (1/2 tsp), and thyme (1/2 tsp), and it tastes perfect! My wife and two daughters (8 and 3 yrs old) loved it, which makes me very happy (my oldest daughter tends to be a picky eater!).

Unbelievable! Made this exactly as written and it was terrific. Just finished eating it last night and even after 4 days in the fridge the meat is wonderfully moist and flavorful. Next time I'm going to try it with poultry seasoning or fresh herbs instead of the soup to try and cut down on the sodium. YUMMY!

I have made this a couple of times now and each time it has come out delish. A suggestion place the turkey breast side down in the crock pot so the meat soaks up the flavor from the juices. I have done this with boneless turkey breast comes out just as yummy. Enjoy

This was SOO good! I've never reviewed a recipe on here before but I felt like I needed to with this one. I had a 3lb turkey breast and I took the advice of other reviewers and put a cup of chicken stock in the bottom of the s/c, I then put chopped up carrots, celery, and sweet onion in. I rubbed the turkey breast inside the skin and on top with onion soup, oregano, parsley, and garlic powder. I put the turkey in breast side down and sprinkled the rest of the onion soup and a little more of the other spices over everything.  I then cooked it on high for half an hour and then cooked it on low for another four hours. It came out perfect! My bf who is not a big turkey fan (finds it too dry) LOVED it and luckily there was enough left over to make him 2 turkey sandwhiches for his lunch. This was so moist and so delicious and the veggies were so tasty aswell! Totally health concious too for my diet. Thanks for this great idea!

This has easily become a monthly staple in my house! I've experimented with different soups and made different gravies. It can even be done with a frozen breast, start it in the morning and by the evening, dinner is just a few minutes away.

I give this cooking technique five stars!  I did not have onion soup mix, so I used the technique here, and added my own spices.  I layered the bottom of the crock pot with onions, celery, and four garlic cloves.  Stuffed the cavity of the turkey breast with half a sliced lemon, and some more onions.  Rubbed the turkey breast with garlic infused grapeseed oil, then a spice rub consisting of thyme, cayenne, sea salt, pepper, tarragon, garlic powder, paprika.  Really, most anything you like should work.  This cooked overnight for about 8-10 hours.  The meat is tender, juicy, and flavorful!

I gave this 5 stars because whether I do it exactly as written, as I did last Thanksgiving for the first time, or with personalized additions, as I have a couple times since, the meat is more moist, tender and delectable than any I have done in the oven! I normally prefer dark meat, because roasting has always rendered the white too dry for my taste. This recipe has made me a believer! With frozen breasts available easily year round, turkey is no longer just for big holidays ;-)

Love using the slow cooker. Turkey turns out perfect every time.......BUT..I do not use the soup mix. I cut up several onions and throw them in. Same great flavor...no processed soup mix which is high in sodium, etc.... I also throw lots of celery in and season with sage. It's still fast and tasty! Campbell's onion soup mix ingredients: Dehydrated Onions, Salt, Cornstarch, Autolyzed Yeast Extract, Dextrose, Onion Powder, Contains 2% of: Modified Food Starch, Caramel Color, Corn and/or Cottonseed Oil and Spice Extract.

I have also done it this way for many years. I put the vegetables on the bottom then the turkey, breast down. According to Wolfgang Puck this lets the juices go  through the breast making the white meat nice & moist. Spices and soup according to your own preference.

For easy cleanup, the turkey can be placed in a cooking bag per the instructions on the box.  I have done this for years with excellent results.  I rub lots of pepper and garlic powder on the turkey and put an apple inside the turkey cavity to give it flavor.

I have been cooking turkey breasts like this for years.  However, I threw my turkey breast in frozen before I left for work.  You can't place anything under the skin of course but you can still add celery, carrots, onion, soup mix and whatever you wish.  I added just a small amount of water to the botton of the crock pot.  The aroma in your kitchen is unbelievable.

I saw this recipe and realized I had a three pound turkey breast growing old in the freezer.  I followed the recipe exactly, but only used half a package of the soup mix because of the size and because we watch our sodium.  I added a couple of teaspoons of melted butter over the top and put it on high for an hour.  Turned it to low for an hour per pound as suggested.  I was truly amazed at how moist and tender it was. I did pull the skin off before serving, as it was pretty rubbery.  My husband, who suffers through our once a year Thanksgiving turkey, just loved this and said I could make this any time.  The meat had the moist texture of a rotisseire chicken.  Would absolutely do this again, except next time would probably add some sage and poultry seasoning.

This recipe has amazing potential for easy weeknight, weekend, holiday and any other meals that you need to cook turkey for without using your oven! I followed the recipe exactly except for adding one stalk of celery, half an onion and a little water to the crock pot so I would have juice for gravy! I got at least four compliments on the gravy at Easter because the dry onion soup mix provided so much flavor!! All you have to do is strain the juice into a small saucepan and add cornstarch mixed with water, stir constantly until it's thickened and there's your awesome gravy to serve with the turkey and stuffing! I was a little nervous about how long to cook the turkey because my slow cooker is insanely hot, but I used the advice to cook until 170 internal degrees and for my 6.75 lb. breast that happened in only 4.5 hours! I will keep a closer watch on it next time since my slow cooker cooks like an oven! LOL  Try this easy recipe, you won't be disappointed.

Fantasic! I used a 5lb. turkey breast and cooked on low for 9 hours. Made so much stock for gravy! Don't add extra liquid before cooking. Threw in some carrots & potatoes too. Highly suggested!

This is a great recipe for small gathering at Thanksgiving.  I do a bit of modificatins by 1 tablespoon soft butter rubbed under the skin and on top of the breast. I put 1-2 cups good dry white wine in the bottom of the slow cooker with 2-3 chopped carrots ,  3 ribs celery and 1 medium  onion.   FYI: If you  would not drink the wine then I would not use it in my cooking.

Very easy!  I used a 8 3/4 pound bone in turkey breast.  The cooking time was still about the same.  Cooked it breast down.  It was moist and flavorful.  Thanks for the simple recipe.

This turned out very dry, the middle was cooked to temp between 5-6 hours but it took much longer for the top part (that wasn't submerged in the liquid/drippings) to get to temp so the rest ended up over cooked.  The flavor was good.

My kids (2YO, 7YO & 19YO) and hubby all liked this turkey.  I rubbed with thyme and sage under the skin as others suggested and cooked breast side down in just enough chix broth to cover the bottom of the slow cooker.  Cooking time was 1 hr on high and 5 hrs on low.  My turkey was a little under 5lbs.  The meat was so juicy and tender.   Will definitely make again.  Used the broth to make gravy by just adding cornstarch and pepper.  Leftovers went on top of my salad and for sandwiches during the week.  Couldn't be easier!

I have cooked my turkey breast this way for years. It always turn out moist. I put it breast side down on some celery and carrots. The important thing is to make sure the turkey breast will fit in your slow cooker.

Perfectly moist, juicy turkey breast!  The only thing that I added was a little bit of water in the bottom of the cooker.  This turned out better than any oven roasted turkey that I've ever had.  After the breast was cooked, I poured the drippings into a sauce pan, added a can of chicken broth and a bit of flour and made a beautiful brown gravy.  This is a way to have turkey any time of year and not just the holidays!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was just great.  Like others, I found it difficult to NOT add any liquids, but consoled myself with a tablespoon of butter in the bottom of the slow cooker.  I started this Thanksgiving morning and by the time we got home from the football game, it was done and the smell when we walked in the house was AWESOME.  I kinda felt sorry for the dog, smelling that all day.  I bought a 6.5 lb bone in breast, thawed it, did the first hour on High, and then it probably went for 9 hours on Low.  Plenty of juice to make gravy for the two of us and we've still go leftover.  I used the Easy Turkey Gravy from this site, which was great too.  I'd recommend; the turkey was not dry and was not oniony.  It was great and sooooo easy.

I probably cooked mine for 10 hours too, since I made it on a work day.  This was the moistest most delicious turkey I have ever had.  It could only be better if the skin crisped, but oh well.  I also made 3 meals out of this breast.  Turkey with mashed potatos, turkey salad for sandiches and turkey enchildas.

I loved the concept of a slow cooked turkey breast.  I used a three pound breast and 1/2 envelope of dry soup mix.  I cooked it on high for one hour and then three hours on low. When I checked the temp. it was done, so make note of cooking times for smaller birds.  I usually like the taste of onion soup mix in recipes, but it didn't work well in this one.  The flavors did not go together well.  I will do this again with different  seasonings.

Absolutely delicious! Besides the onion soup mix, I added cajun seasoning & poultry seasoning (because we like our turkeys REALLY seasoned). No one could believe I'd cooked it in the crock pot and everyone was amazed at how much "juice" was left for making gravy - which also turned out great. I'll be cooking our turkey breasts like this from now on!

I know this recipe has a ton of great reviews, but I have to add mine in as well...I don't know as I will ever do a turkey breast in the oven again! This is phenominally moist and delicious. I cooked on high for 5 hours to cut down on cooking time and it even got a touch of brown on it. I can't say enough good things about this amazingly simple and delicious recipe!

Worried about the amount of salt in the soup mix, I made up my own "rub".  I used olive oil, paprika, poultry seasoning and lots of thyme.  Before placing the turkey in the crock pot, I put a layer of onion, carrot, and celery in the bottom, then I added a little balsamic vinegar and red wine.  I used the strained remains to make gravy.  I'd cook it a little less next time.

I guess I am a late bloomer to the whole slow cooker craze - let's add to that what my head is saying "Turkey? In a SLOW COOKER?!".  I must say though that this was the simplest and best way to do a Thanksgiving turkey. I don't normally eat a lot of meat, much less like to touch it so anything that saves me from having to poke, prod, and smear anything on a piece of raw meat is worth a second look (in my book, anyway). The turkey was so tasty and moist. It was unbelievable. My whole family LOVED it. We didn't even have any leftovers...and it was requested for Christmas dinner - yes, instead of ham. I did do as other reviewers suggested and added a few pats of butter and a few shakes of poultry seasoning. Other than those oh so labor intensive extras (ha ha), all else was spot on. Thanks for sharing!  This recipe really saved a lot of time and hassle on the holidays. I was able to spend much much more time enjoying things rather than running around like crazy trying to get everything just right.

This is similar to the way that I do a turkey breast in the crock pot but I put one cup of broth and 1/2 stick butter in the pot and then add the breast.  Brush the breast with oil or butter and then sprinkle the 1 package of onion soup over it.  Cook the same legnth of time.

So good & soooo easy!! WE bought a 3.5 lb turkey bone in breast, I used 1/2 pack Lipton onion soup mix, 1 celery stalk cut up leaves and all, 1 carrot cut into 2 inch pieces, 1 onion quartered, 1 clove garlic minced, 2 t poultry seasoning, s/p. I took the skin off of the turkey, rubbed with EVO and all the spices (including the soup mix) and garlic. I then seared the breast in a saute pan with EVO until golden brown on each side. Spray crock pot with non stick spray, add veggies and 2 T water, add breast, breast side up. Cook 1 hour high, 2 hours low. Then flip the turkey so that the breast is laying in the juices and cook low 3 hours more. It is so moist and fall off the bone, yummy!!! An instant favorite of the family!!

We loved this recipe.  I used a 9.5 lb turkey in my 7 qt crock pot.  At first the lid did not fit on, so I used tin foil to cover it.  About half way through cooking, the turkey had settled enough that the lid fit on.  I did only cook it for around 7 hours on low, as I was affraid of over-cooking it.  I also forgot to add the onion soup mix - but it still turned out fantastic.  We like the natural taste of the turkey anyway. The meat immediately slipped off of the bones like everyone says. There was a ton of juice too!  I measured out 4 cups.  This was a very easy recipe!  Definately a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!!

SOUP MIX MUST HAVE MSG. I tried this months ago and my turkey came out bland and extremely dry and now I think I know why.  One word: sodium.  Salt is water loving and it extracted all the juices out of my meat after only a few hours.  I suspect this is because I used a soup mix that DID NOT have MSG.  MSG has a third of the sodium of table salt and you can use less of it.  I can't find the soup mix I used to compare ingredients, but I suspect it had considerably more sodium than the leading brand of soup mix which uses MSG.  It also goes without saying that you should not use homemade, MSG-free, soup mix in this dish.  Homemade soup mix uses table salt and it could pull out all the juices from the meat.

Being a nurse who always works Thanksgiving, I always cook Turkey in the crockpot.  Some things I like to do is inject the breast with chicken broth.  Use frozen carrots, they cook better in the crockpot.  I also throw in a few legs for the dark meat lovers.  And add alot of gravy (and some apple juice) for it to cook in.  Have tongs ready to pull all the bones out.  But the crockpot is a lifesaver for those of us that can't be home.

Making turkey could not be easier! I seasoned the breast with the dry onion soup, and added some garlic powder, oregano, and fresh cracked pepper, and some pats of butter, under the skin. I poured a cup of wine in the bottom of the crock pot, added a can, undiluted, of cream of chicken soup, some sprigs of rosemary and thyme, and then added the pre-seasoned turkey, breast side down. My crock pot cooks quickly, even set on low, and in four hours, the breast was ready and the gravy that I made by reduction and a bit of roux, was outstanding. The turkey was moist and flavorful and this is a recipe I will use again and again when turkey breasts go on sale.

My first turkey in a slow cooker.  I used a 3-4 lb boneless breast (as I only cook for 2) and used a packet of Lipton Savory Herb and Garilc mix instead of dry onion soup mix.  I cooked on HIGH for 1.5 hrs, then low for 2.5 hrs.  It turned out great!!  Will be making this recipe again.

Thank you for this recipe it is very good and reviews are helpful. I decided to have dressing with mine, it was very easy. I put a bed of chopped celery and onions in the cooker then added my 3# turkey breast that had some dark meat in it, let it cook until it was mostly done. I took it out of the cooker and added the box of dressing mix, it needed a little more liquid so I added a small can of mushrooms with the juice to it and some butter. It was perfect. After mixing it, I put the turkey on top and let it cook on high for a half hour. While that was heating thru I cooked  my favorite vegetable combination, peas and broccoli, we had a very enjoyable Sunday dinner. I have cooked the breast in the cooker before but I liked your idea. Thanks again.

Great recipe, however be careful. It says to cook for 8 hours and mine was ready in 5. I had it on high the first hour and then turned down to low. If I had let it go for 8, it would have disintegrated. Delicious.

Pretty darned good! Tender, flavorful, and a good way to cook turkey when it's too hot to turn on the oven. I took the terrific advice of other reviewers and added some celery, onion and carrot to the bottom of the crockpot.  Smeared butter over the turkey and sprinkled the onion soup over and inside the turkey breast. Added a generous splash of chicken broth that I had on hand. Made gravy with the juices and served the vegetables on the side. Greeted my sweetheart after a long trip away and flight with the delicious aromas of this filling the kitchen as he walked in, fatigued, just wanting the comforts of being home again.He took in a deep breath, smiled broadly and said "No place smells or tastes as delicious as home!"

Yummy, didn't use soup mix as I have a gluten free person in the family.  As other suggested place onions and celery on bottom of crockpot, also about 1 cup of chicken broth.  Rubbed my breast with butter, poultry seasoning, salt and pepper and placed on low for about 8 hours.  Was so good, I've been eating turkey sandwiches for days and I love it.

I've never submitted a recipe review but had to do so on this one! Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a HIT! My Mom, who'd been baking the family turkeys for decades said she'll never bake a turkey breast again but will cook it in the crockpot from now on. I only had space in my pot for chicken broth at the bottom so make sure your pot is deep enough for the veggies others have suggested. I rubbed the bird with butter before the onion soup mix. The bird's skin doesn't really brown but by the time the meat is falling off the bone while you're removing it from the cooker, you won't care. No need to carve the breast. It's so tender you can take your pieces off with a fork. Excellent recipe and now a family staple. My Mom is passing it along to her friends! My reputation as the "crockpot cook" is more secure than ever!

My family and I loved this recipe. We only wished it had browned but since it fell off the bone it was no longer an issue. I did change a few a things. I used a 8.25 lb turkey and I cooked it on high because we wanted it for dinner. I started it at 10 am and it was done by 2:30 pm. I also rubbed it down in margarine, powdered turkey gravy and Larry's season salt and it was delicious. I will definitely be making this for Thanks giving !

Thank you for giving us a great slow cooker recipe with only two ingredients! I love using onion soup mix, but I modified this recipe for my use due to the amount of salt in the soup mix.  I used a 7.5 lb turkey breast only partially thawed.  I put the breast in the ceramic crock-pot liner (My pot has a ceramic liner that fits into the aluminum pot), I put a couple pats of seasoned butter (kosher salt, garlic powder, thyme, black pepper) under the skin and rubbed the skin on top with a little olive oil.  I placed my ceramic crock under the broiler and browned the skin for about 10 minutes.  Then I put it in the crock-pot on low for 7 hours.  Very moist, the condensation bastes the top of the turkey and I did not have the rubbery skin. I did not add additional cooking liquid and had plenty of drippings to make gravy.

I followed this recipe exactly, and the turkey breast was moist and delicious. The 6.5# turkey breast was done in 8 hours. The onion soup mix made it a little too salty, so I will reduce the amount next time.

For those of you that said the turkey was too dry: The reason this turkey is dry is because we were told to cook it toooooo long. So, I dropped the time down the second time I did it and it then was moist. I cooked a whole turkey not just a breast. Cook it six hours not 7 or 8. It turned out moist the second time around. Never give up if something is worth trying to fix.

I am giving this recipe and the cooking method 5 stars because of the ease of preparation.  But I'm afraid GREAT taste was lacking.  Until I added my usual herbs and seasonings, the recipe rated only 3 stars.  I am one of those people who don't make a dozen changes to a recipe and then rate the original.  That's not fair to the other cooks or the person who submitted it originally.  But I DO love the method of preparation!  Thank you, Ms. Sally!!

WONDERFUL! I'm so glad I found this recipe! As a single person I go to friends' homes for Thanksgiving and Christmas and don't come home with much in the way of leftovers for turkey sandwiches. I've tried cooking small turkeys for myself, but it's too much hassle and more meat than I can eat and I always make it dry or chewy. This recipe solved all my problems.  I got a 3lb turkey breast, used a McCormick's marinade because I didn't have this soup on hand. Cooked on high for 30 minutes, then low for 4.5 hours... it was the most tender, moist and tasty turkey I've ever made and was TOO EASY. I'll be doing using my crock pot for turkey from now on!

While the turkey was moist, it lacked a ton of flavor.  It was just a turkey breast sitting in onion soup.

Good and easy recipe. I mixed a can of cranberry sauce with the onion soup mix and then put it in the slow cooker, it made a wonderful sauce to serve over the turkey once it was sliced. I found this recipe in a cookbook that said you could put a frozen breast in the slow cooker and cook on high 2 hours and then low 10 hours more.

I just made this again with fantastic results!  YUM! I brined the breast overnight.  I put a couple of pats of butter, a splash of white wine, some chopped celery and five cloves of garlic in the pot and a few inside the turkey breast.  Before rubbing it with the onion soup mix, I rubbed it with olive oil, then rubbed it all over and under the skin.  Cooked on high for 1 hour and then low for five hours. Absolutely perfect.  Today, I'm going to layer the leftover turkey on top of stuffing in the slow cooker with gravy poured over the top and heat through.    I followed all the instructions but even so it came out just a bit dry.  I think next time I will add some broth to the bottom of the crock and rub the turkey breast with olive oil. I will definitely use this recipe again.  Couldn't be easier and the leftovers were great. I made gravy with some of the juices from the bottom, very good. I put the bones back in the crock and added some more celery, garlic and onion, cooked til the next morning and had wonderful turkey broth.

This is the third time I have made this recipe, always moist and very flavorable.  Instead of the onion soup, I use onion powder, salt, pepper, poultry seasoning, and a tiny bit of curry.  Following other reviewer suggestions, I drizzle one-half cup of melted unsalted butter.  This is so much better for us than buying lunchmeat at the deli; we know exactly what is in it.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe and to all who read for contributing to the reviews.

Great aroma while cooking AND great tasting!! Additions I made: (1) melted butter to add to the soup mix then rubbed into the turkey, and (2) added half can of beer since I always crock-pot meats with some liquid. This made just the right amount of liquid to thicken into a gravy before serving.

Awesome recipe! Couldn't be easier. I used a 6 lb turkey breast and followed directions exactly and my turkey was overcooked so I made gravy with the juice and poured it over the turkey on the platter to put moisture back in. The gravy was perfectly seasoned with just the juice and thickened with a little cornstarch dissolved in water.  My family absolutely loved it. Thank you so much for such a wonderful, easy, satisfying recipe.

Wow! I was skeptical but this was so delicious that you really can serve it for thanksgiving!  Here's what I did...6.5 lb honeysuckle white breast fresh bone in.  Half a stick of melted butter rubbed around the crock and the cleaned bird.  Lipton herb and garlic mix (cuz I didn't have onion soup mix). Rubbed over the turkey and into the breast.  Fresh poultry herbs in the cavities and/or under the turkey.  One chopped leek and three chopped garlic cloves laid in the bottom of the crock and put the turkey  in on top. Pour about 3/4 cup chicken broth around it. One hour on high , six hours on low. If you like the skin crispy put it in the broiler for 5-10 minutes. Let it rest for 15 minutes. The meat comes off the bone perfectly for slicing.  I'm saving the broth and drippings for tomorrow to make soup!! Delicious!

This turned out fantastic!! Here are the modifications I made : I used only a 2.5lb half turkey breast. I still used a full envelope of onion soup mix, drizzled some olive oil on top, added 1/4 cup chicken broth, oregano and a bunch of fresh, minced garlic. I cooked it for 1 hour on high, then for 3 1/2 hours on low. Fall apart in your mouth delicious! Serves probably 4 or 5 really hungry people. Served with peas and stuffing and cranberry sauce for a late thanksgiving feast.

I put a little water in the bottom of the crock pot, put olive oil and the onion soup mix on the turkey.  I cooked the whole time on low and this turned out better than any turkey breast I have ever made.  This is a great recipe.

I really did not enoy this recipe.   Onion and turkey, it turns out, are not the best combination.  I had high hopes based upon the reviews, but the meat was overcooked, and the taste was kind of rancid to me.

Even though I didn't use the slowcooker, I did prepare the turkey with the onion soup as your recipe states.  I had no time to use the slowcooker, so I wrapped it in foil, popped it in the oven (it was only a 3.5 lb breast) for almost 2 hrs., I think it was.  And boy, this was some delicious juicy turkey.  I would never thought of using onion soup mix in that way, so thanks for the great idea!

I absolutely loved this recipe, and so did my family! I didn't have the onion soup mix, so I used some spices I had as a rub. I was tempted to add water, but didn't, and now I'm glad! There was so much beautiful juice to make gravy with. This is a new favorite recipe for us.

this was glorious in its simplicity---so easy and so delicious;  i added about 3/4 cup of chicken broth at the bottom and some sliced onion, strained it after the turkey was done and it made magnificent gravy.  Thank you for this recipe!

I did what some other reviewers did.  I added sliced onions on the bottom and added about 1/4 cup broth below the turkey just to have a little juice to pour over my white rice.  The onions were yummy.

This was super easy, but I didn't find that the flavor really got into the turkey. Also, I'm not sure whether my crockpot cooks really hot or something else was going on, because when I looked in on my turkey after four hours, it was done!  Actually it was past done, since the top part was pretty dry.  I'll try this again, but I'll probably cook it on low the whole time and start checking it around the three hour mark.

This turkey turned out really well!  I used a bone-in breast (approximately 6 pounds) and just cooked it on low while we were at work.  My only complaint was that it was kind of salty, so next time I might make up my own rub instead of using the onion soup mix.  Even so, we'll be having turkey much more often than just Thanksgiving and Christmas!

This was actually really really delicious.  I used a 3 lb frozen turkey breast that I thawed, rinsed, and then patted dry.  I rubbed olive oil all over it and then rubbed the onion soup mix all over it.  I poured 1.5 cups of chicken broth in the crock pot, put the turkey in, and then surrounded it with a sliced up yellow onion.  Cooked it on high for 30 minutes and then on low for another 6 hours.  It was absolutely the very best thing ever.  It completely fell apart when we sliced it and the entire thing was SO moist, juicy, and flavorful.  It disappeared!

Very good - we followed LadaFun's advice with the celery, onion, garlic and chicken broth and it was fantastic.  Next time we'll include more onions (but we need a bigger crockpot).

This is nice and moist.  I actually made this for Thanksgiving one year and my mother-in-law was concerned that we weren't having the traditional bird.  I like the bird from the oven too, but most of the meat that you eat that way isn't attached to the crunchy skin.  So this was delicious and everyone thought it was great...including my mother-in-law.  Don't overcook and keep in mind that if you buy a different size turkey breast, you will need to adjust your cooking time.  I tried it without water and now add just 2-3 spoonful sizes of water.  To be honest, I don't notice much difference.  Sometimes I like putting dark meat in here (like adding a few drumsticks and thighs).  As long as you don't add too much, you can keep the cook time the same.

This was really good. I used a bonless breast.  I made this for a work "thanksgiving" lunch.  I did add some onions and celery to the slow cooker and some poultry seasoning to the turkey.  Also added a can of stock to the bottom of the crock.  Suprisingly delicious!

I tried this yesterday. It turned out great. I put some carrot, celery, and onion inside the bird, and, in the crock. I rubbed butter inside, under the skin, and, on the outside, prior to putting on the onion soup mix. I had a can of broth that I was going to add, but, I'm glad I didn't. There was plenty of broth, which I strained and thickened up with Wondra flour. The bone-in turkey breast I had was about 7 1/2 #, It barely fit in my large oval crockpot. I had to lay it on it's side. I flipped it over after four hours. I followed someone else's recommendation and cooked it on low for an hour per pound. I'll be making this again. Thanks

I made this for dinner last night and it was fabulous! I even put the turkey breast in frozen....I used a 3 lb. frozen Butterball turkey breast, added the onion soup, cooked on high for 2 hours, then turned down to low for another 2 hours....Wow! It was great. I was worried about not adding any liquid, but since the turkey was frozen, I figured that might give it enough moisture..After the 4 hours, I took out the turkey, removed the netting and wrapped it in foil to keep warm while I added the gravy packet that came with the turkey and some water with about 2 tbsp of flour to the slow cooker. Turned up the heat to high and left it for a half hour. Gravy came out great and breast was ready to slice. I served with mashed potatoes and corn. Everyone raved about how moist the turkey was. Thank you for the recipe. This is one I will use over and over again.** Addition** 2/11/09--I have made this a few more times and added a can of cranberries to the slow cooker with the onion soup.WOW! My family loves it and it is a super easy meal to make. Thanks again for the recipe.

I used a 7lb frozen turkey breast. Buttered the crockpot and poured some olive oil over the top of it. Then I added a lot of Montreal chicken seasoning,salt, pepper and garlic powder.
This was Super Quick to prepare and perfect when I got home after a LONG day at work. It was in the crockpot for 10 hours! It was perfect! I think the trick is... if you want to cook it for a long time, put the turkey in frozen that way it won't be overly dry if you put the turkey in after it has thawed.

WOW! Made this recipe for Christmas with 16 guests including my Mother and Mother in Law! I think they both thought I was crazy to attempt a turkey in the slow cooker! However, it turned out wonderful! Both of them asked for the recipe! Made my Christmas dinner a breeze to cook! Make sure you add the butter, celery, onions, sage and chicken broth. This is a keeper!!!!!

This is absolutely fantastic! I had a bone-in breast that I had no idea what to do with, and all my whole-bird recipes in the oven were awful. I used a lot of butter under the skin, stuffed the cavity with quartered onions, a tablespoon or so of minced garlic, lemon juice, and more butter. Then we rubbed the whole thing with Poultry Seasoning, left it breast-down on High for about 3 hours (actually, we forgot to turn it down!) and then for about 2 hours on Low. 

This is so easy and incredibly delicious. Every time a turkey or even a whole chicken is on sale, I'm going to fix it this way and use the meat, not wasting it on full-price chicken breasts!

Seriously - this was wonderful!  The turkey was so moist I didn't need a knife to cut the meat.  Yeah, it was a little more salty than I cared for but that can be dealt with by using less onion soup mix and/or substituting herbs as a rub.  I have no complaints, this was perfect.

I have a 3.5 quart crock and a turkey breast that was just shy of 4 pounds.  It barely squeaked in, I was a little worried the crock wasn't big enough but took a chance and am thrilled with the results.  I'll definitely make this again.

I made this a while ago and it turned out great!  I actually bought a half of a turkey (it was around 6-7 lbs) and cooked it this way.  Very tender and tasty.  There was a lot of juice in the bottom so I made gravy too.

Wow!  I was hesitant, but what a great way to cook a turkey breast!  I like to have 'leftover' turkey after spending the holidays at other family homes.  This is a great way to cook a turkey while we are out, and come home to a nice, moist bird.  No danger of drying out.  I did omit the dry soup mix, just added some celery and carrots to the bottom of the pot.  You have to try this!

Made this yesterday for Thanksgiving.  I will NEVER cook a turkey any other way.  Instead of bacon, I place several sprigs of rosemary, thyme and sage on top.  I placed celery, carrots and onion in cavity and around breast and rubbed entire breast with grapeseed oil and poultry seasoning.  It was awesome.  I also used a crockpot liner and there was hardly any clean up.  Thank you for the recipe and especially the method!!

tried this today and it turned out good.  Just a couple of tips:  I used a boneless Butterball turkey breast that had been injected with brine solution.  Remember bonless will cook faster than bone-in.  I found the meat too salty for my taste since it had already been brined - that''s my fault, not the recipe!!

Very good and very easy....only catch is it's hard to find a bone in breast that is less than 7lbs at my grocery store...last one barely fitin crock pot!  Had to put a telephone book on the lid to keep it closed lol....second time I made this, used a boneless breast added some sage, thyme and oragan.  Then added a little bit of apple cider, one inch water....cooked on low 7 hours...delish!

well, i must say i was pleasantly surprised with the way this came out.  i thought for sure it would have been like white meat chicken, dry and stringy.  this was very moist.  cooked perfectly.  although the onion soup mixture didn't do much for me, i seasoned as i normally would have also. (garlic/onion/thyme).  very good.  i did cook it on low for 5 hours and it was a little over 6 lbs.  perhaps 7 hours is too long for those dried out/stringy roasts.  i put under a broiler for 10 minutes or so to crisp up the skin and then let it set for another 15 mins before carving.  thanks for the post ms sally!

I don't make this often, because I prefer not to cook with packaged stuff like soup mix, but I have made this a few times, and it is just delicious.  And just simply easy.  Buy turkey breast on sale, throw it in the slow cooker with seasoning and hit the button.  Served this to company after working all day, and went over very well.  I keep this recipe for exactly those times when I want to feed and entertain my loved ones, but don't have a lot of time or energy to invest.  Perfect.

Loved this!!!  Made as directed with a 6 lb turkey breast.  I have a smaller slow cooker so the lid would not fit.  I covered it instead with aluminum foil and a kitchen towel and it worked perfectly.  This will definitely be on our regular rotation.

This was too easy. As is, this is delicious. I have since altered it using golden onion dry soup mix, a can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic and 3 stalks of celery. The only water I use is to get the rest of the soup out of the can. After making it a few times both ways the family prefers it with my changes.

Absolutely wonderful way of cooking turkey, so simple and the whole house smelled great. I had picked up a small 3 lb. breast on sale and found this recipe. Only thing missing was crisp skin but the turkey was moist and juicy. I followed other reviewers suggestions by rubbing the turkey under the skin and over with unsalted butter and then rubbing the onion soup mix in. Cooked on high for the first hour as recipe stated and then followed suggestions on allowing 1 hour per pound on low heat setting. No liquid is needed, the drippings from the turkey also made a tasty gravy.

I never cooked turkey in the slow cooker and it turn out just right and very moist. If you are following this recipe I would not run out to buy onion soup mix. I did use the mix myself since this recipe with the french onion soup mix is also on the turkey grower web page. How ever, next time I'm using my favorite turkey rubs and filling the bird with onions, garlic and other good stuff. The recipe is great because of the cooking process.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and was extremely disappointed. The turkey was very dry, and the onion soup mix, while it can be delicious with a beef roast, did not go well with the turkey. If I do decide to try making a slow cooker turkey again, I'll definitely try the many alterations suggested by other reviewers.

My husband said this was the most tender turkey he ever had.  I didnt' have the onion soup mix, so I rubbed it wth butter, salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder.  I put it in the crock pot in the morning, and it wasn't quite done 8 hours later, when I had planned supper.  Because of our busy schedule, the turkey cooked for 11 hours before we finally ate.  I was worried that it would be ruined, but it was perfect! I tried to slice it, and the meat literally fell off the bones.  It was so tender that no knives were needed.  Very juicy and flavorful too.

this was HORRIBLE because it was beyond dry.  Such a waste of money and time.  I think it needs something (water, broth, wine, LIQUID) during the crockpot stage.

This is the only way I cook turkey--it is VERY easy and makes enough to get another meal or two with the leftovers (sandwiches, turkey manhattans, turkey tetrazzini, etc.) My family LOVES it!  You don't need to add butter, water, or even the onion soup mix. It makes plenty of juice that can be thickened into gravy or just poured on top of the sliced turkey. I just sprinkle paprika over the top to help brown or give color and cook on low all day while I'm at work. I highly recommend a Norbest turkey breast.  It is not salty like other brands, yet has good flavor.  It also has a built in pop-up thermometer.  If I have room, I throw in carrots and potatoes on the bottom.

This was definately not holiday quality!  I followed the directions exactly and I just wasn't impressed.  It was very easy and it should get 10 stars for that but the flavor wasn't anything to write home about.  I would use this for an easy meal for my family, I just wouldn't serve it for a holiday dinner.

SOSOSOSOSO GOOD and easy. The house smelled so good when I got home. In Fact the dogs were drooling. great with hot buttered noodles and corn. Will make again. By the way, couldn't fine a bone-in turkey breast so used a boneless. turned out just fine with time and temp adjustment. on low for 4 hours.

I'm a big slow-cooker fan and this was the easiest way to cook a turkey!  I didn't think adding only the onion soup mix would do it for me, but it was delicious.  I did make the following changes:  poured just a bit of water in the slow cooker and made a gravy after it was done; also, I used a 6 lb. boneless turkey breast.  It was extremely juicy and tasty!  This will be on my menu list from now on!

This turkey breast was excellent! It was so easy to prepare and it smelled so delicious cooking all day long. I did put a little bit of butter under the skin to ensure moistness and a very small amount of water on the bottom of cooker because I was afraid it might burn on the bottom. It made a lot of broth and was much moister than an oven cooked turkey breast. A definite keeper!

This was a great recipe! I made exactly as directed; no additions or changes. After reading some of the other reviews, stating it took them "11 hours" instead of the 6, I was pretty nervous that it wouldn't get done in time for my dinner party. So, I did start the turkey extra early, but it was done exactly at 6 1/2 hours. I made a 5.8# bone-in turkey breast, and it just barely fit in my slow cooker. It did not taste "oniony" at all. It makes plenty of juice for gravy. Definitely would recommend for a great easy main dish!

The turkey came out very tender, but mine was not done in 8 hours. I took it out after the 8 hours and the temp was only at 150 degrees. So I sliced it (it was still a little pink but sliced very easily) and put it back in the cooker for 2 additional hours. Next time I will plan on 10 hours.

I didn't have onion soup mix on hand so I seasoned the meat with pepper, garlic salt, rosemary and thyme. I quartered an onion and put it in the cavity. This was by far the most tender and juicy turkey breast that I've ever prepared - and you couldn't get an easier recipe! This method of preparation is definitely a keeper.

This is a great & easy recipe & always comes out moist & tasty. I have been making a recipe verrrry similar to this for years!  The slight difference is to add a can of the jelled cranberry sauce(I have used the whole berry but prefer the jelled).I just dump the onion soup mix in...to add a little depth, use a can of condensed cream of celery soup or condensed cream of chicken & 1/2 can of water. .... it makes a nice gravy-like sauce.... this recipe (minus the soups) makes a great pork roast too!

SoOoO  Good!!!  This was the easiest recipe I think I've ever made.  I prepared it following the recipe to a tee.  The turkey was literally falling off the bone, I barely had to slice it.  Tender, juicy, perfect.  We do like the skin a little crispier though, so next time I might put it under the broiler for a few minutes.  Other than that I cannot wait to make it again!!

This is very good and the turkey will be tender if cooked properly. The second time I tried this recipe I made the mistake of leaving it cooking on low for longer than 7 hours. It became dry and nearly all the gravy cooked away. I planned on layering this turkey over a bed of mashed potatoes and then top with gravy from the pan. Had I not over cooked the turkey it would have been delicious!

This is sooooooo good!!! I can't believe this taste so amazing. I used the same ingredients but I brined the turkey in herbs (sage, thyme, rosemary, garlic) 1 day ahead (I just did this because I was going to roeasted but since I found this recipe I thought to give it a try). Turkey not only smells wonderful but looks amazing... This recipe is a keeper!

[NOTE: DO NOT ADD CHICKEN BROTH!! It works perfectly without it... look at my pic, all those juices are from the turkey]

This was delicious! The only change I made was to throw some carrots, celery, onion, and garlic in the bottom of the slow cooker before I put in the turkey breast. 

I cooked a 3.5 lb bone-in breast on high for one hour, and then on low for two hours. My slow cooker has an attached probe so it automatically switched from low to warm when the breast hit 170 degrees. It was moist and flavorful, and there was plenty of juice to make a yummy gravy. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe as written.  Add onions, celery and butter with rosemary and thyme to make it even better.  My wife asked why we didn't have turkey this way every time.  This recipe is now a staple for turkey breast in our house.

All i can say is WOW!!!! This was the most moist delicious turkey breast I ever had. I made some changes, here's what I did.

I did not use the onion soup mix
I used boneless turkey breast cut in two

Seasoned turkey breast with
Black Pepper
Cayenne Powder
Onion Powder
Poultry Seasoning
Garlic Powder
Salt
Olive Oil
Marinated over night

Chopped up 2 large onions
3 large carrots (placed in crock pot)
Poured in 1/4 cup of chicken broth 

Placed Turkey Breast in poured remaining chicken broth over turkey,covered and set on high for 1 hr.

Turned Turkey "breast down" covered and cooked for 3.5 hrs.

OMG it came out perfect, moist juicy, and flavorful. Everybody enjoyed it. This will be my go to recipe for now. No more chalky dry turkey breast here.

I'm sorry to say that I thought this was unremarkable. Granted, I'm not a big fan of turkey, but I have to feed a bunch of people this Thanksgiving so I thought I'd roast a whole turkey and do a breast in the crock pot. I did a dry run on the crock pot recipe yesterday. I used an envelope of Knorr Spring Vegetable soup mix and, per several suggestions, used an oven bag to eliminate cleanup. I cooked it breast side down to help keep it moist. It was okay. The meat wasn't dried out, but it wasn't special either. I'll mix it up for Thursday by brining it and adding a bunch of other herbs and spices to the rub.

Basically I think that when a recipe seems too good to be true, it is.

Delicious!  I did add a sliced onion, a bag of baby carrots and some chopped celery.  The flavor was delicious!  This was quick and easy and I would definatly make it again.

Oh my gosh!!  Super yummy, moist delicious-ness.  Cut up 3 carrots, 3 celery stalks, a med onion and threw this in the crockpot.  Added about 2 tblsp butter.  Rubbed the 6.5 - 7 lb breast with low sodium Mrs. Grass onion soup mix.  Meant to add more seasoning like Thyme, sage, or Poultry but completely forgot about this part.  cooked breast side up for 1 hour on high, turned breast down for 1 hr on high and then about 6 hours on low.  Made Mashed Potatoes, and roasted some more carrots, celery, onion and a fennel bulb cut up and tossed with EVOO, sea salt and  fresh ground pepper.  Served with the Crockpot juice ladled over the top.  WOW!

I cooked this overnight in the crockpot and it was wonderful.  Very juicy.  As another reviewer suggested, I placed the turkey breast on a abed of celery, carrots, onions and fresh minced garlic.

Ever since I made a turkey breast this way, I have never gone back to the oven. So moist and the drippings make a great gravy.  Only think I added was 1 cup of chicken broth.

I made this for supper this evening, threw it in the slow cooker this morning and when we arrived home it was ready! I did however tweek the recipe slightly since our market only had an 8.4lb. breast. I have a 6 quart oval cooker and filled the bottom (about 1 inch) with chicken stock, then placed the breast in to cooker, rubbed with 1/2 of an envelope of Knorr Dry Onion Soup, salt and pepper. I cooked it on high for one hour and then down to low for 9 additional hours. When I checked the internal temp. it was the correct 180 degrees. When I removed the breast to rest, I strained the broth in the bottom and made gravy from the drippings (which is terribly delicious - I use Wondra to thicken). Served with fresh green beans, stuffing and hot rolls - YUM! Note that the breast's texture will be slightly different than an oven roasted one - but tender and moist for sure! The only down side I found from a personal standpoint was the skin - which is rather soft when using this cooking method - I do prefer the "crunch" of an oven roasted bird, but my husband loved it!

Such an easy way to make turkey.  I wouldn't make it any other way.  Yes, I agree with earlier reviewers that it doesn't exactly look appealing when it's done, but if you put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes, problem is solved!

I will never bake a turkey again! Moist, tender and full of flavor! We didn't even need gravy! Like other reviewers I put some chopped onions in the bottom of the slow cooker. I rubbed the bird down with some butter and put a few pats of butter under the skin of the breast. I then sprinkled on the onion soup mix, some sage and pepper. I put a few more chopped onions in the cavity and placed the turkey breast side down in the slow cooker. I cooked it on high for 1 hour and on low for 5. It was wonderful! The boyfriend loved it too! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Great idea! I've made this several times and it's been delicious every time - even when I left it in too long.  It's great to have turkey breast on hand for sandwiches, soups, etc.   The juice/gravy is amazing too.

Giving 5 stars for the idea of cooking turkey in a slow cooker. Made some changes ~ used 2 boneless breast halves just under 3 lbs total. Salt/Pepper turkey. Omitted the onion soup (my opinion tastes like a frozen dinner) Used a can of Campbells Cream of Chicken Soup, 1 onion thinly sliced and a teaspoon of thyme. Cook high for 1 hr, set to low for 3 hrs. Gravy is done also! Yum

Ok, I was really skeptical about the onion soup mix in this (have only used it in beef recipes).  My curiosity finally got the best of me and I gave it a try.  I can not count how many times I have "almost" made this and then decided to stick with my regular recipe for slow cooker turkey breast.  I am really surprised.....happily surprised.  I started with a frozen turkey breast, so I liberally buttered the crock & added a small can of turkey broth with the soup mix and let it cook all day on low and it is wonderful.  Next time I  will have to add some rosemary, thyme and sage like my regular recipe, but this was very good as is. The turkey is very moist. I now have a great broth (no weird taste at all) for making soup.   Thanks for sharing the recipe!

So very, very yummy!  Added a cup of chicken broth, a bay leaf, paprika, some rosemary and thyme...  Another dependable, unbelievably good and shockingly easy recipe.  The slow cooker has become the best wedding present we received!

This is a good recipe. I put celery on the bottom of the crockpot as the others suggested. Turkey breast cooked like this beats deli meat any day. After cooking the breast, I found during the course of the week I used it for lunch sandwiches, quick pasta salads, and even as hor devours with drinks before dinner. You must, must, must season the breast with salt, oregeno, black pepper, and your favorite spices. I added ground cumin in the spice mix.

So easy and taste fantastic!  The smell in the house makes it so hard to wait.  It's great hot or cold in a sandwich later.  My husband (who thinks oven-roasted turkey is the only turkey) LOVED it!  Thanks!

SO EASY!!  So tasty!  Modifications: Used a 7.5lb Bone-in Turkey Breast (almost didn't fit!) I layered the bottom of crockpot with onions and red potatoes, 1/4 cup chicken broth, and 1/2 tbsp. minced garilc. I placed the turkey breast on top and rubbed the turkey with the onion soup packet (lifting up the skin on top of the breast and adding the seasoning right on the meat).  Drizzled the breast with melted butter. Cooked on low the whole time, about 7 1/2 hours.

this really was a fantastic way to make a turkey.  i made it for a small dinner party and got rave reviews, even from my husband who typically does not like white meat.  the meat was so tender it just fell off the bone!  i did make a few changes as others suggested; i added a few pats of butter to the crockpot and poured just enough white wine to cover the bottom of the pot before adding the turkey.  since i was short on time, i cooked it for 5 hours on high and it turned out just great!  i will definitely be making this again.

So moist and yummy!  I rubbed softened butter on the turkey breast- on and under the skin and then added the onion mix on that.  It stuck real nice.  I also rubbed on a few of my favorite seasonings for my taste preference(pepper, salt, paprika, a touch of sugar and garlic powder) Cooked as directed and it was delicious.  Don't pass it up.  I also think there is no reason to add in chicken broth because the juices the turkey makes are plentiful.  It would be way to much liquid if I had added in broth to start.  I also basted mine every hour since I was home.  YUM!

it was a easy and great! but since breast are expensive here, i bought turkey legs for half the price. I also put about 1/4 cup of water and some veggies on the buttom of crock pot. I also rubed some butter on the turkey along with the seasoning. The turkey was nice moist.  I cooked it about 7 hrs. on low. I made some potatoes, and homemade gravey, dinner was all done in 30mis.

No brainer. Really needs no mods. The key is to the cook time. Whether you cook this in a slow cooker, electric roaster, or otherwise, just get yourself a quick read thermometer and keep checking it until the thermometer reads 160. Then take it out, put it on a plate, tent it with foil, and let it rest for a half hour. It won't be dry. This is true for all meats. Don't follow the recipe cook times...use that thermometer.

I have to say how much I loved this recipe. I am a seasoned cook and realize that recipes should be tweaked to our own individual specifications.  When you alter a recipe as drastically as LadaFun did, it is no longer the original recipe.  It is unfortunate that some reviewers do this again and again. Perhaps they should take the time to submit their OWN recipes and stop "modifying" the recipes of others. I made this and my family raved about it. I tweaked it to my liking, and would not dare disrespect the original recipe submitter. Bon Appetit !

This was incredible. I will admit, I was skeptical at first but our meal was so great. I hate to say this, but the only CHANGE I made was to add 1/4 cup white wine and a 1/4 cup chicken broth before I put Turkey in. I did this only because my gut said " don't put meat in the slow cooker without some liquid."  The end result was awesome. This will be a staple in our house. So very incredibly easy to make almost a no brainer.

This is to die for!  I read many of the other reviews before making mine, and went with some suggestions from LadaFun.  I will definitely be making my turkey like this all the time!  Everyone loved it!

Don't feel tempted to add any liquid at all to this.  It's completely unnecessary as the breast alone will produce more than enough juice to make gravy, and to turn out very moist and tender turkey.  The only changes I made were to rub butter on and under the skin of turkey, and I used my own blend of seasonings.  Cooking the breast upside down really helped keep it moist.  Making the gravy was a snap.  Definitely recommend.

The only turkey better than this is deep dried. I made this for my family of four and it made enough turkey for nearly three dinners. I used 2 envelopes of the onion soup. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. This turkey was moist, flavorful and EASY to make. It literally fell off the bone.

This was the best Turkey breast ever.  I made the turkey breast for Thanksgiving and it was eaten before the honeybaked ham...the real Honey Baked Ham.  No leftovers at all and everyone wanted more.  I preferred poultry spices like sage to the onion soup mix but no matter what you do you will have a very moist bird.  I did use the bed of vegetables (carrots, celery and onion) to the base under my breast and I also added some,maybe 1/2 cup, of chicken broth to the bottom.  Rubbed the preferred herbs and spices under the skin and cooked on medium high for about 4-5 hours!

I've been cooking turkey breasts in the slow cooker for years.  I force a little butter between the skin and the meat, salt the inside, and cook it meaty side down so it stays nice and moist.  If it's too large to sit "upright" in the crock pot, place it on one side and then flip it over part way through the cooking time so both sides stay moist.  My kids even got me a large oval slow cooker so I could cook larger turkey breasts. So easy and good!

I have made this turkey recipe for the last few years. This is by far my favorite turkey recipe, and the only way I will cook a turkey again. It is so moist tender and flavorful, the juices make excellent gravy too.

Awesome! All 3 of my kids asked for thirds. I covered bottom of crockpot with carrots and celery and added onion around the 6lb turkey breast. I also added some poultry seasoning (which contained basil, thyme, rosmary and garlic) onto the turkey. Most moist white turkey meat I've ever had.

I couldn't find bone-in turkey breast so used two boneless turkey breasts.  Added just a pat of butter to the bottom but not sure if it was needed.  Worried about it being dry but came home to find that my worry was completely stupid.  Made a little gravy with the juice and served with some stove top stuffing and green beans.  It was so good and hubby and I had leftovers for the next day too.  Yummo!  Its a keeper!!!!

This recipe is great, but only if you add more seasoning and moisture.    I add onion, celery, white wine, chicken stock, and fresh herbs like thyme, sage, and oregano.  The onion soup adds a depth of flavour, but alone, it doesn't create enough gravy for our liking!  This makes the most amazing gravy, and by adding caramelized onions and mushrooms to the gravy you have a 5 star dish.

Great turkey recipe! VERY moist and delicious! I made this for Easter dinner for the entire family. I modified the recipe a bit using the onion soup pack and adding poultry seasoning which consisted of sage, thyme, rosemary, Black pepper, and clove. Rubbed the outside and inside of the turkey breast with all seasonings. I used about 4 Tbs of melted butter drizzled on top and 1/2 cup of low sodium chicken broth. I had a 9 lb turkey breast because I was feeding several people and it was the perfect amount to go around! Got many compliments on this, Will be making this recipe again for sure!

I am anxious to try this--perhaps without the dry onion soup mix.  I have roasted a chicken in the slow cooker, so why not turkey!  I think adding a little water is a good idea because when I roasted the chicken, it was a bit dry.  Maybe a roasting bag would work.

I have used this recipe for a couple of years, with and without the vegetables on the bottom.  I use the onion soup mixed with a can of cranberry sauce .  Pour over the turkey breast, cook on low for 8 hours.  The liquid that is left makes a delicious gravy, thicken with cornstarch if you want.  I've also pureed the veggies at the bottom to add to the gravy.  Easy and delicious - Thanksgiving all year round!

I was not a fan of the flavor of the onion soup mix but I really liked knowing that I can roast the turkey breast in the crock pot.  it makes things so much simpler especially in the summer when I don't want to heat the oven but want turkey.  So thanks for that. I get bonless turkey breasts from our church's market day and they run around 4-6 lbs. so this worked perfectly.

The hardest thing about this recipe is trying to fit the turkey breast into the slow cooker so be mindful of that when purchasing. After that I dont know how anyone could mess this up~ I added onions to the bottom and chicken broth and smashed a little butter on the bird but thats because i just do stuff like that, I am sure this would be very good if you just follow the directions. Mine was falling apart but still moist so check periodically during the end of cooking time if you want it to come out of the pot in one piece.

Amazingly good! I had one of those 'ah-ha moments' the other day and realized I should be cooking my own turkey instead of buying the deli meat that is so full of preservatives and sodium. I was happy to find this recipe so I didn't have to use the oven in this heat we're having. I sprinkled the breast with marjoram and garlic powder, as well as the onion soup mix. I also quartered an onion and a few carrots and stuck them in the cavity. Started it before work and by the time I got home it smelled amazing and was perfectly cooked. I'll use this recipe/method again and again. Thanks! :)

Wow - so easy!  I just coated the inside of the cooker with butter and added enough chicken broth to the bottom to cover.  Added some fresh thyme and rosemary under the skin.  Ended up with a lot of liquid for gravy - but I just added more water and boiled the bones for stock instead.

Wow! Awesome!! No changes are needed!! I followed the instructions exactly as typed, except I overlooked the "cook on high for 1 hour" instruction and cooked it on low overnight for 8 hours. You don't need olive oil and those other spices people are suggesting. I think they were afraid that it was going to be to dry and bland. I poured out 1.5 cups of liquid after the turkey cooked, and that doesn't include the liquid that was still in the meat. The meat was falling apart!! Make sure you have some bread to make some great sandwiches!!

Easiest way to make a moist and flavorful turkey breast.  I make it even easier by using a Reynolds slow cooker bag to cook it in.  No clean up period!  Just toss the bag.  I also used the Lipton's Savory Garlic and Herb soup mix instead of the onion, just because I prefer the taste of the seasoning more. So simple, so good.  I will freeze the leftovers and look forward to making this again soon.

I did this last year with rave reviews! The turkey was done to perfection; juicey, tender and delicious.  Saves your oven for baking other things and I'm looking forward to doing it again this year.  The only way it could get any easier is if someone put it in the slow cooker for you!

Used boneless turkey breast and followed other reviews to put a couple pats of butter in the bottom. This was very good and very easy. I ate my turkey plain with stuffing and green beans on the side. My husband made a turkey stacker (toast, shredded turkey, stuffing, gravy - piled on in that order). This is how I'll make my turkey from now on. A+

I was skeptical that this would work, but it was fabulously delicious and so simple.  I followed the advice of others and smeared 1 tbl. butter on the inside of the crock pot and 1 tbl. butter on the 6.3 lb. bone-in turkey breast I had.  I used slightly less than one onion soup packet and ground it up before smearing it over the buttered breast. One hour on high and 7 hours on low was perfect.  I cheated by flipping the breast over during the last hour of cooking.  I removed the breast and tented it with foil and returned the crock pot to high and added 2 tbl. cornstarch and 1/4 cup cold water to the pot and let it cook another 10-15 minutes and then strained it into a gravy boat.  Wonderful flavor, not oniony at all.

My family all thought this was absolutely delicious!Everyone kept asking me how I cooked it and they just couldn't believe it when I told them I put it in the crockpot.I didn't even add the soup mix I just seasoned the turkey and added a tiny bit of water and some onion.The turkey turned out so moist it just fell apart.It tasted absolutely delicious with my dressing.This is how I'll be cooking my turkey from now on!

This recipe is also great with a can of whole berry-cranberry sauce thrown in! Follow the same directions, just add the cranberry on top just before cooking, and baste a few times during the process. Most flavorful and moist turkey I've ever had!

This is definitely the best turkey breast I have ever made, or eaten! It was so moist and tasty, absolutely delicious - the soup mix gave it an amazing flavor! The only thing is with my 6.1lb turkey breast I did cook it on high for 1 hour, then on low - checked temperature of the turkey breast with a meat thermometer, and after about 4 and a half hours it was done - I would recommend using a meat thermometer. There is no need to add any liquid, it made plenty of its own juices, which I strained the drippings and used it in the "Easy Turkey Gravy" recipe from this same site - together it will make your taste buds dance - a turkey breast will never see the inside of my oven again!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving & am getting ready to do it again this year. I used two crock pots - a whole turkey cut up and just added a 1/2 stick or so of butter. Not only is this great turkey--it makes the BEST gravy!! I do this a few weeks before Thanksgiving - cut it up - make the gravy and freeze everything. I love to do everything that I can ahead of time--makes for a thankful Thanksgiving!

Easy and tasty!  Be sure to not over cook it...  I cooked for one hour on high and then turned to low for 5.5 hours and it was juicy and moist.  Will make this again!

This is a fantastic recipe as written. I have used it several times and have more than happy each time! I cannot believe how easy it is to make, and how moist the turkey is without adding any butter, liquid or vegetables. We love this recipe!

I love cooking my turkey in the slow cooker, but I hate onion soup mix!  I cut up carrots, celery and onion and put a little butter in with my turkey instead.  DELICIOUS!   I have used this recipe a bunch of times now.  It's perfect for the holidays when there are only a couple of us - saves me a ton of time and it turns out fantastic.

This recipe is better than the Turkey Breast with gravy.  Wish I could change my rating.  This one definitely wins.  Again, the only thing changed was the gravy recipe.  Don't try any other one than this one.  Take everything I said about the Turkey Breast w/gravy, and apply to this one.  The best turkey that I have ever tasted.

I have never heard of cooking a turkey in a crockpot before.  To my wonderful surprise it turned out beautifully and super moist.  I will make this again when I don't want to be home to "supervise a turkey" in the oven.

Sorry...really did not like this one although I expected to love it.  The turkey ended up so mushy it was almost baby food.  The gravy was very nice, but the turkey breast was a disappointment.

I admit that I was skeptical when I tried this recipe but it turned out very well. The turkey was moist and well flavored, not salty at all as I had feared. I coated the crock with nonstick spray before adding the breast, threw in a few rosemary sprigs, and added about 1/4 cup of water. When the cooking time was up, I removed the breast from the crock and let it rest. Then I sliced off all the meat and returned it to the crock to reheat in the juices before serving. The au jus was tasty, and the leftover meat will be turned into a turkey pot pie and salad for sandwiches. Great way to stretch a good thing!

This is now one of my favorite recipes. It couldn't be easier to make and it's delicious as written. There are endless ways to jazz it up with a variety of vegetables, wine &/or broth and spices so it never becomes boring. Thanks to all the other reviewers for their ideas.

I was skeptical because of the lack of water. Living alone I had a 1¼ lb. breast and shortened the time a little. It was fantastic and I've told all my friends about it.

Fantastic! I used a half a bone in turke breast but left everything else the same. I could have cut down the cooking time, but hey, it was a busy day. I rubbed the turkey breast with seasoned salt and chicken bullion powder. Then drizzled a couple of tablespoons of melted butter over it. DO NOT ADD WATER. You'll be tempted but dont do it. There will be plenty of drippings for a fantastic gravy! I just poured the drippings into a sauce pan, whisked in some flour and brought it to a boil. It was the best turkey gravy I ever made! My wife and little girl want to know when I'm making this again.

This was great and really easy. I used a fresh turkey breast. I did butter the btm and sides of the crockpot as suggested and also added one cup of chicken broth. The only way to do turkey breast. Thanks

I love this! So simple! I cut some slits inbetween the breast and skin and rubbed a butter & onion soup mixture in then and then all over the rest of the bird. I then added about a 1/4 cup chicken broth and it was done in about 7 hours on low. The turkey just feel off of the breast bone, so easy to cut and serve! No mess! fantastic!

Although, I did not use the onion soup mix, I followed the cooking time.  For my larger crockpot (not sure of the size of mine) it turned out dry.  I checked the temperature after 7 hours and it was already up to 180+ degrees. Not sure that I would attempt this again.  TY for sharing.

This is quite good and wonderfully quick to throw in the crockpot.  I had to keep a close eye on it and removed it when the pop up button "popped" - was glad I did because it would have been dry otherwise.  Flavor was quite good! UPDATE I had to upgrade my rating - this is now one of our favorites!  I make it a couple of times a month, either with a turkey breast or a whole chicken, and it is SO GOOD!  I prefer (still) to use a bird with a button so that we can remove it and not overcook.  Leftovers are perfect for soup.

Awesome! This was my first time cooking a turkey breast. The ultimate compliment was my MIL who loves turkey said it was the most moist and tender she had ever eaten. At 86 she said she was going to have to pull out her crock pot! Even after cooking it a bit too long it tasted fabulous. When I took it out it just fell off the bone. My fault for getting too busy to remember to cut it off. You will not be disappointed. I did rub the inside of the crock pot with margarine to give it that golden brown color.

This was the best turkey breast I've ever fixed.  It was so easy and so yummy.  I'm making a cassarole out of the left overs.  I usually chunk them b/c they get so dry, but not this turkey.  I will try a whole chicken this way next and see how it comes out.

I did not have a whole turkey breast, so I used 4 turkey chops.  I also did not have 8 hours, so I lightly browned the chops over the stove first, so they were not raw.  Added half a package of onion soup mix and water to cover, brought that to a boil and put it in the slow cooker for three hours on high.

This turned out excellent tasting.  The meat just fell apart.  The only thing is that is using the slow-cooker, even though the turkey was all white-meat breast, cooking it for that long, I would have sworn I bought dark meat -- but wow, it was delicious!

SO good for how easy this is!!  I made this twice & it was pretty darn good both times.  This seems to be a very forgiving recipe as far as cook time.  This last time I made it exactly per the recipe except that I had a smaller turkey breast.  I should have paid attention and scaled down the dry onion soup mix.  It came out on the salty side this time due to my mistake.  

The first time I made it, I took some other's suggestions and put some vegetables under the turkey breast (celery, onion, carrot).  I didn't have enough time to cook on low for 7 hours so I cooked for 4 on high.  

Both times it came out shockingly moist and fall apart tender and flavorful.  I don't think adding the vegetables really improved the flavor all that much.  Going forward I'm going to stick to the original recipe though I will continue to add a couple pats of butter under the bird in case.  I used a crock pot liner and was really surprised there was no scorching (my crock pot runs high even) and it didn't stick down at all.  I don't know if that was because I added the butter or not, but I figure it doesn't hurt to keep doing that.

I am planning on adding this to my rotation.  Hard to find a recipe that is so good for how incredibly easy it is.

awesome recipe. put a little white wine on the bottom and i'm glad i did b/c mine didn't create too much liquid. my tureky was closer to 3-4 pounds so i did it for 4 hours on low and checked with thermometer. made a mixture of spices with a bit of oil and brushed it on top of the turkey before putting in the cookier.

I discovered this technique quite by accident several years ago. Had a thawed turkey breast and no time to oven bake. Put it in the crockpot along with a cup of prepared chicken broth. It cooked on low for about 9 hours while I was at work. And it was absolutely fantastic, moist and flavorful. Provided meat for a variety of dishes, and stored some in the freezer for a delightful stew. I  won't  go back to using the oven.

It looks delish! After reading the reviews, I tweaked it and used 2 pats of butter, added 2 tablespoons of flour to the soup mix, whisked soup mix into 2 cups of chicken broth. That way, it makes a thicker gravy. Gonna be so good with garlic mashed potatoes,and field pea, with snaps! :)

Moist turkey. I would have liked it better if it had a bit more flavor. I will try it again as it's so quick to prepare with plenty of leftover meat. I'll try adding different herbs/spices, & maybe some butter next time though to perk it up, for our tastes. Thank you for the recipe.

Very easy and tasty.  Cooked for 4.5 hrs on high since I live at a 7,000' elevation.  Used the thermometer to test for the recommended 170 internal temp.  Will do this recipe more often.

Definitely one of my top 10 recipes from this site.  So easy.  There is never a reason not to come home from work to a hot meal that continues to provide a basis for other meals during the rest of the week.  The leftovers make sandwiches for lunch, or they go into salads for dinner and my favorite is turkey gumbo.  I have been using this recipe for years and had to comment today after starting the slow cooker on a Sunday when I have guests coming for dinner and I am not feeling well.  A no fuss dinner that everyone will enjoy.

So disappointed. My turkey was so dry and and didn't taste that great.  It was over 7 lbs. I put in a little chicken broth with it and cooked on low for 7 hours.  The thing fell apart and was dry as sand.  I made the liquid into a gravy which helped marginally.  I'll use the leftovers for a pot pie I guess.  Not worth it.

Turned out perfect! I didn't use butter because of dietary restrictions. However, I made a lovely rub of EVOO, fresh sage, oregano, thyme, rosemary and garlic.

GREAT RECIPI. I got a late start and didn't get it done until 11 at night. I put it in the fridge and then put it back in the slow cooker on low for 2 hours the next afternoon. the turkey was very juicy and delicious. I also put in Potatoes, Onions and carrots ant they turned out great. I'll put this in my regular rotation. VERY EASY AND IMPRESSIVE WHEN SERVING GUESTS.

Yes,it was easy, but SO DRY!  I even added a few tablespoons of butter to the crockpot, and under the skin, but unfortunately I dried the heck out of a $30 turkey breast.  Oh well, nothing a little gravy can't fix.

This was delicious.  Way beyond my expectations.  We aren't huge turkey fans, but this was so moist and flavorful.  I followed the recipe, but added about 1 cup chicken broth.  Served with roasted baby reds and vegetables.  A wonderful dinner.

December 1, 2012.  AWESOME!  My turkey breast was 8 1/2 pounds so I had to make some adjustments. I cooked it on high for four hours and on low for four hours.  In addition to the onion soup I added one eight ounce apple quartered, one medium onion quartered and a stalk of celery in quarters and one cup of water.  The smell was wonderful as it was cooking.  My oven was free to do all the other things I wanted.  I could not believe how moist the turkey breast was and the meat was just as good the next day for turkey sandwiches.  I don't think I'll ever use the oven again.  If I could give ten stars I would!

I give this recipe 4 stars because it truly is a fool proof way to cook a juicy turkey. I knocked off one star because I felt like the onion soup added a sort of fake flavor to the turkey. I will try to season it with real herbs and spices next time. I used a 3 pound boneless turkey, and cooked it for about 1 hour on high and 3 1/2 hours on low as another user did. I also added a half cup of chicken broth to keep it moist.

I had a boneless/skinless turkey breast that had been in the freezer for a long time, so decided to try the slow cooker approach with it.  First, I have to say that I have tried a good number of slow cooker recipes, but only have a few that I would make again...just not a fan of this method of cooking.  However, this is one that I would make again.  Being boneless, I obviously cut the cooking time substantially and ended up with a tender piece of turkey and broth that made a decent gravy.  So we had a pre-Thanksgiving dinner with turkey, gravy, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and green beans with mushrooms.  Very nice.

This was fantastic.  My husband thought it was even better than our thanksgiving turkey.  I stuffed the breast with apples, onions and garlic and then layers carrots, apples and onions on the bottom of the slow cooker with some water to make sure it didn't get dried out.  Will make again- so nice to have a great meal in the middle of the week!

This is my favourite way to cook turkey! Especially when I'm cooking for a small crowd. I always use a boneless breast/thigh roast and it cooks in about 4 hours. I put about 1/4 cup of chicken broth in the bottom of the slow cooker and the meat comes out so moist! I also love how this frees up my oven to make other side dishes or veggies. Makes the house smell amazing!

Unlike all these other reviews, I actually made this recipe and not something completely different.  I used the two ingredients suggested as well as followed the cooking time and it turned out great.  Very moist and great flavor as well.  I've never made turkey breast in a slow cooker before and I'm happy you shared this technique, thank you.

EASY, Delicious and Amazing way to cook a turkey breast! I substituted Thyme and Oregano because I didn't have Onion Soup mix. I put the Turkey Breast on a bed of Onions and Garlic and put a little Olive Oil over the top. I thought I would miss the "browning" that the oven does, but this Turkey Breast is perfect and simple!

WOW! This was great! Super easy and tasty! The only thing I did differently was I added about a half cup water...just enough to cover the bottom of the crockpot. I recommend this!

Very good and super easy! IMO no need to cook on low... I just cooked it on high the whole time (about 4.5 hours) and it was incredibly tender and juicy. Per the other recommendations I seasoned with salt, pepper and thyme, drizzled a stick of melted butter over the whole thing, and added a little broth to the bottom (it doesn't actually need much broth if any at all).

How EASY! This turns out a super moist turkey breast! I did thicken the 'drippings' into a turkey onion gravy. Makes my mouth water to even type this out. This is now the only turkey breast recipe I will ever make! Thanks Ms_Sally for the recipe!

This finished for me in five hours, and it was very dry; so maybe 4.5 or 4 hours wuld have done it. Beyond the dryness, the flavor was not so good. Too salty, too onion-y, not like the turkey breasts I've enoyed before. Not making this again. And if you DO make it, audition it before Thanksgiving; I wish I had. This was the turkey I served on The Big Day, and it was lacking. My husband thought it was ok, but full disclosure: he eats anything.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  It was soooo good!!  I used 1 1/2 envelops onion soup mix to rub the turkey breast all over (under the skin, in the cavity, etc),  I also drizzled it will olive oil after putting it in the crockpot.  I cooked it on high for an hour and then added 1/2 can chicken broth to the bottom of the crockpot because I wanted enough "Drippings" to be able to make gravy.  I used a meat thermometer to tell me when the turkey was done.  Mine was done after 6 hours total cooking time (1 hour on high and 5 hours on low).  My turkey turned out very flavorful and juicy and my gravy was DIVINE!!  Will definitely be making this again!!!

Quick and easy!  I started the slow cooker at 7 am and left it on high for an extra 15 minutes -this was an accident- before switching to low.  My crock pot wasn't tall enough to accomodate the turkey without tilting it onto its side, though I did right it after 4-5 hours.  Absolutely delicious!  I think I spent more time thinking about cooking it right (this was my first turkey, in any form, ever) than actually getting it done.  I will make this again and again.

This was great!  I've only made it once as it's a little much for just 2 - but we both felt like we were getting Thanksgiving early.  I will say that somehow my turkey turned out a little bit dry, but that could have been because I left it in the slow cooker for too long.  Also, my boyfriend is not really a white meat guy, so he thinks all white meat is a little dry.

I thought this recipe was very easy to do but unfortunately my turkey came out slightly dry even though I put it breast down.  I also thought it needed more seasoning.  I am giving it three stars because I will be making it again but making changes to the cooking time and seasoning.  Thank you!

This was a GREAT recipe!  It was so easy- I'm always afraid to cook turkey and this is pretty fool proof.  My husband wouldn't stop picking at it before dinner and said it was some of the best turkey he has ever had.  I added some dehydrated garlic, season salt, italian seasoning along with the soup mix.  We will definitely have again! YUM :)

Delicious! I cut up onions, celery, and carrots and put in the bottom of crock pot.  Then I seasoned the breast with the onion soup mix and injected it with about 2 tbl spoons of melted butter mixed with Lawrys seasoning.   I cooked mine on high for 1 hour then on low for about 3.5 hours.  To brown the skin I put in the oven on low broil for about 10 minutes.  It was PERFECT!

The only complaint I have is that it's REALLY difficult to get out of the crock pot. The flavor is GREAT, it's so moist & yummy, but I had to pick out all of the bones one by one because the meat just fell off of them.....which is what I had expected, just didn't prepare for this, and wouldn't know how to (other then buying a boneless turkey breast next time).  We're really looking forward to turkey & noodles for dinner tonight with the leftovers. Glad I got a large turkey breast!

Was really excited to try this after reading the reviews but very disappointed.  Perhaps our altitude was a disadvantage?  (Denver, CO area, about 5500 feet).  The turkey was dry and lacked flavor.

Maybe the easiest, most versatile recipe ever. I make this all the time. It's just me and the fiance, so I usually just use a 3 lb boneless turkey breast. You really don't even need the onion soup mix either if you don't have it on hand - covering the turkey with a mix of spices works just as well. I usually do onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, italian seasoning, and rosemary. Amazingly moist and delicious for so little work.

Easier than a peanut butter sandwich.  A three pound breast was done in four hours, and was the juiciest turkey breast I have ever tasted.

Oh YEAH baby! This came out great! I made this the first time a long time ago, using all the suggestions to add this and that, and it came out okay. Then I forgot about the recipe. Fast forward to today, I needed to cook a turkey breast quick, that had thawed out in a defunct freezer. Being July, I didn't want to crank up the oven. I decided to just do the turkey and onion soup mix as called for. I did cook it on high for four hours instead of longer on low, but checked the temp and it was at a perfect 170. This was delicious! Not adding this and that (even though I wanted to) made this recipe even more satisfying. Thank you for a great recipe!

This was really very good. I only had a boneless turkey breast to try this on and it still turned out really good. I just added about 1/4 cup of water and sprinkled it with rosemary.

I followed Indy Nurse's suggestions...seasoned the turkey breast with seasoned salt, Italian seasoning, onion powder and garlic powder and added a little butter.  I also used a three pound turkey breast.

The turkey breast came out nice and tender but it only took 3.5 hours! I wasn't into the onion soup mix on the turkey breast but I like the potential for this recipe. I will say: The gravy from the drippings was outstanding!

I was skeptical at first, about this recipe. Don't be like me, TRY it. You won't be disappointed! I used a 5 1/4 lb. bone in turkey breast. Rubbed the onion soup mix under the skin and on top of the skin. Poured about 1/2 cup of chicken broth in the bottom of the crock pot so things stayed moist in there. Let this baby cook for 8 hours just like the recipe states. The meat comes apart from the bones when you remove it from the crock pot! It is that tender and juicy. Excellent flavor. I will definitely be using this recipe from now on for Thanksgiving. SO easy and such little clean up and hassle, there's no basting involved, you just put it in the pot and forget about it! Genius!

I was a little hesitant when I first saw this recipe but decided to give it a try.  I have since fixed turkey breast using this recipe at least 5 times and the gravy from the drippings is delicious.  I have suggested to others to try this recipe becuae it is a "fail proof" way of fixing turkey breast that even the person who says they are not a cook can prepare.  The best thing is that the crock pot does all the work!

I'm so glad there was a way to make a Turkey Breast in a Slow Cooker.  I put a cup of chicken broth in a pan sprayed slow cooker and added an 8 lb. fresh turkey breast with skin and bone intact.  After 5 hrs. I removed and discarded the skin and carcas and I pulled it like I would do pulled pork, got rid of the juices in the crock and put the pulled turkey back in along with my homemade bbq sauce, cooked it 2 more hours on low and WOW - so tender, flavorful and what a Hit!!

I made this last week with the intention of using it for turkey sandwiches all week. When I took it out of the crockpot - it was literally falling apart. So I had to try it. Then my son had to try it. Then the fiance. We stood there nibbling on it until it was half gone. So we only had turkey sandwiches for one day! Thanks for an easy, tasty recipe!

Cooking method is brilliant.  I have never had turkey breast this moist.  This is how I will be doing my Thanksgiving turkey, since I don't like the waste that comes along with roasting a whole bird.  The onion soup mix, I could do without.  I should have known that it would taste somewhat artificial.  Next time I will be using my own poultry seasoning or a little salt and pepper with butter, as other reviewers have mentioned.  I have yet to try brining the breast, but I will give that a try next time.  Overall, a great revelation to a cook who is always trying to free up oven space.  Now you can cook your sides while the main dish cooks away in the crock pot!!

AWESOME and EASY. Turkey was crazy moist and declicious. I added more spices (thyme, sage, etc) and did add about 1/4 cup chicken broth too. Will be making again..the family inhaled it.

I have made turkey breast in the crockpot before and it has turned out delicious.  I have not used the onion soup mix, but a combination of spices that I would use if I were cooking it in the oven.  I am a nurse and this year I have to work on Thanksgiving as well as cook.  I think I will do the crockpot turkey breast with the onion soup.  I can't go wrong!

I finally got around to making this and it was excellent.  The slow cooker really seals in the flavor. I used an 8 lb breast and cooked it on high for 1 hour and low for 7 hours. This was a little too long and next time, I will reduce that a little.  My crock pot is new and it cooks hotter than my old one. I was surprisd to have a good amount of turkey drippings and I made gravy with that.  If you love tukey, you will love this recipe.

This is a GREAT recipe I had a 2.5lb Frozen Turkey breast in the freezer and kept forgetting to thaw it. I did a little research and you don't have to thaw it before hand! So I tried it I was a little nervous but it turned out GREAT i added some fresh onions carrots and potatoes very good and a keeper

Delicious and easy.  I did a bit of butter in the bottom of crockpot, some onion slices (plus a bit of garlic and shallots just because I had them), the turkey breast (purchased frozen and half thawed due to time!), and the soup mix on top!

I wanted an EASY Christmas dinner and BOY did this recipe deliver!  Even my eleven yr old who "doesn't like turkey" raved.  My husband and I recommend that you add a cup or so of water to the bottom of the slow cooker-- we did it just to insure against burning, and by the end of cooking time, with the turkey juices and the onion soup mix, there was a nice broth that we used to make an awesome soup!

I cook maybe 4 or 5 turkeys or breast a year on the grill or in the oven, this slow cooker recipe was GREAT. I put the 7 1/2 lb breast in brine for 6 hours then slow cooker for 5 hours and served with all the trimmings. Every one said it was great and moist. I used cream of chicken soup, chicken broth, and cut up onion along with sage and lemon pepper.

Excellent Idea - Thank You! I used this as a guide but did things really differently - we LOVE fried turkey but it's not exactly health conscious so I used the same seasonings (Cajun) & did what the others suggested - I cut up celery & onions, placed them on the bottom & poured 1/4 cup Chicken Stock then put my 3 lb turkey breast on top! So moist & yummy - I will definitely use the slow cooker to cook turkey in the future!

Made for TG this year for the in-laws and was absolutely delish.  Didn't need any extra liquid - plenty juicy on it's own.  Did put some Rosemary, Thyme, & Sage at bottom.

slow cooker cooks hot - cut down on cooking time. Add cranberry sauce (about 1/2 can or so) and place a few pat of butter on turkey.

Just tried this recipe tonight and modified with the addition of poultry seasoning. I used a crockpot cooking bag to save on clean-up and that helped a lot. The turkey was very moist and done to perfection, however, my family wouldn't eat it until I put it in the oven on 400 degrees for about 20 mins. Then voila, it looked more like what they are used to seeing. Good recipe, fast prep and will make again, thanks.

Super yummy!  I make turkey this way all the time.  The next step for us is to debone, shred the meat, and add gravy made from the drippings. Awesome on a fresh bakery roll with coleslaw or baked beans on the side!

Definitely rub it with softened butter and a little extra spice (I used fresh minced garlic and sage.  Also, I sliced up an onion and layered it in the bottom of the crockpot and poured in a tiny splash of white wine before adding turkey breast.  Sooo moist and yummy.  Served with "Classic Thanksgiving dressing" from allrecipes.com, canned cranberries, and gravy made from the packet....nice preview of Thanksgiving :)

I threw in a package of pre-cut onions in the slow cooker and had to add some chicken broth/water to keep them from burning. Also sprinkled garlic powder with the onion soup all over the turkey.  After the first hour on high I added sliced carrots which made a nice side dish mixed with the pieces of onion. Used Wondra and water to thicken the gravy and served with garlic mashed potatoes.  The turkey was juicy and delicious.  Great meal with little fuss. I think my slow cooker runs hot so my 4 lb. turkey was done in less than 7 hours.
Will be using this recipe often.  Thanks so much for the post.

This. Was. Simply. Wonderful. My only change: 1 tbsp butter melted in the crockpot and a little minced celery prior to inserting the bird. Just enough room to put on the lid, I had no space for veggies but after the 7 hours it was fully cooked, moist, with lots of drippings for gravy. (You truly do not need to add water or broth.) I fed 8 people and had enough left over for soup as well.

What a GREAT idea for a quick meal!  I tried to follow the recipe to a T... but because of either the ingredients being unavailable... or my own spaciness, I could not! :( I used a 3# boneless breast (I couldn't find a bone-in) that already had the spices shot into it (Duh! Didn't read the package!). So I plopped the thing into the cooker (minus the soup, which bummed me out) and cooked it on high the whole time (I'd planned to do high for an hour and then turn down... as suggested by another reviewer for cooking a smaller breast....but FORGOT... another "Duh!").  I was gone when the pop up thing shot up, so I'm not sure how much I overcooked it...it was in for about 3 1/2 hours from start to finish...the gravy fixed the dryness my daughter griped (what else is new) about but BOTH kids glommed it down...apparently it wasn't THAT bad...I had used the juice for the gravy, so had to recreate some....so I sliced the rest back into the crock and added 2 cups of chicken bouillon... and within seconds that upped the moistness and the remaining turkey was perfect. I hope to try this again...VERY SOON...I KNOW it will be fabulous... because if my screwed up attempt turned out this good, then I know following the directions to a T... will be so much better! :) I nuked some red potatoes to mash up and steamed some baby carrots in the micro also... it really was a hit... despite all my goofiness...and EASY!!  Who knew?!  Turkey in the crock! Thanks for such a great idea!

I made this recipe today with turkey wings.  They were fantastic.  I made my own onion soup mix with a copycat recipe which includes beef bouillion, dried minced onions, onion powder and fresh ground black pepper.  This is also a very low-carb diet friendly meal.  I skimmed the fat off the drippings and thickened it with xanthan gum for a yummy gravy.  Even my 4-year old ate it!

Made just as recipe called and this was so tender and moist. Made gravy out of the juice and served over some rice. Lots of leftover turkey for sandwiches too.

Ok, so I did improvise a little. Based on other suggestions, I layed the bottom of the crockpot with onions and carrots. I added 1 cup of chicken broth and buttered the turkey as well. I cooked it for 2 hrs. on high and 7 more on low, which was way too much for a 7 lb. turkey. Next time, I'd cook it just 7 hrs. on low. It still turned out yummy, very moist and cooked perfectly. We loved it. Thanks for the great idea!

This turned out terrific!!  I had to make a turkey and a ham for Easter, and this was the perfect solution!  So much easier than cooking it in the oven.  Oh, I did not use onion soup mix, I just used poultry seasoning, and I added chicken broth.  Great recipe!

It was just my husband an I for Thanksgiving this year and my first time doing the cooking so I decided to make this. I too added a few pats of butter to the bottom and I also threw in a few baby carrots and some onion. I cooked it on high for 1 and 1/2 hours and on low for 4 and 1/2 hours. It turned out great! There was plenty of juice left that made a great gravy. We used the left overs for sandwhiches. I will definatley make it again very soon!

Very good flavor and plenty of juice without adding any liquid.  I put onions and celery in the bottom of the crock. There is so much waste when I roast a whole turkey, we may have this for Thanksgiving.

Ia m not a big fan of slow cooking, but this was delicious. I didn't use onion mix, but instead I used Mrs. Dash, a 1/3 cup water, and some celery, baby carrots, and onion slices. It came out very juicy and the dripping made a flavorful gravy. I will definitely be making this again for the holidays

Fantastic. I was skeptical and did add 1/4 cup water. It was moist and there was plenty of broth to make gravy.

This was a great timesaver for Christmas, but I didn't get all the liquid that everyone else talked about. I eventually added some broth because the bottom was burning with the little bit of liquid that was there. I think I would add liquid from the start next time and it would turn out better.

I am speechless (prob. cuz my mouth is full of the best turkey in the world!).
But seriously.. there is no other way to make turkey in my house anymore, and since I only cook for 1... no arguments! I was able to get 1/2 fresh turkey (breast, leg, wing and back) from my store...it even had that pop-up thingie in it so I knew exactly when it was done! However, I did leave it on for another couple of hours on warm... Totally fabulous!
 
Thanks!

This was easy and tasty.  I used 4 chicken leg quarters and added 2 tbsp of butter to the crockpot.  The meat was really tender, falling off the bone.  It made a tasty gravy for the mashed potatos.  Very easy and perfect for the colder weather.

This was really flavorful. I rubbed the onion soup mix on a 3lb turkey breast and put some pats of butter under the skin, then baked at 370 for about 2 hours. It was very moist, and the dirppings in the pan were great too just drizzled on top of each slice.

This turkey turned out very moist with good flavor.  I followed the recipe and did not add water or butter.  The gravy from this was good too-no need to add salt.  My husband wants me to make this turkey for Thanksgiving.  I will be making this again.

I loved this recipe and would make it again.  Meat was very moist and just fell apart.  I used a 4.38lb breast and cooked it about 6 hrs.  I added a tablespoon of butter as some of the other reviews suggested.  This is how I'll cook the breast from now on.  I'll also try a whole chicken in the future.

What a great idea!  I used a 7-pound breast, and it was really tender. There was plenty of pan juice to make turkey gravy, too.  I stretched this into a couple of casseroles, as well!

Decided to add some onion soup mix to the turkey I was making and wish I hadn't now. I made this in the oven, and while it was very moist, I thought it was bland. Also, if you got a piece of the onion it was extremely bitter. If I were to do it again, I would only have the soup mix in the cavity. A plus though was the beautiful color my turkey had.

I didn’t have onion soup mix, so I looked up a recipe for a homemade version of onion soup mix, and I followed all the other directions exactly. This was the most delicious turkey I’ve ever had. It fell apart when we took it out of the slow cooker, so presentation isn’t the same as a roasted turkey, but the taste makes it worth it! I’ll do my turkey this way from now on.

Really yummy. Made with onion, carrots, celery and chicken stock underneath as other reviewers recommended. Flipped breasts meat-side down after 3 hours so it didn't dry out. Shredded turkey and made gravy after straining fluid in croc pot. Mixed shredded turkey with gravy then served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli with melted cheddar. Outstanding!

I have probably made this recipe a dozen times-- I have done the celery/carrot/onion bed, which is good-- but the recipe is quite delicious as is.  However,  because I discovered about half the onion soup sticks to my fingers and and under my nails, I usually mix the onion soup with a stick of softened butter which is re-chilled to slice and slide under the skin when I put the turkey breast in the slow cooker. The broth makes wonderful gravy!

Ok so this recipe does not work as directed.  The cooking time is WAY too long and turns out dry as a bone.  Here's what I did.  Prepare as directed. Add one can of chicken broth to slow cooker being careful not to rinse turkey seasoning off.  Then cook on high 3 hours.  If your turkey is only 6 pounds it may be done in 2 and 1/2 hours as it took 3 hours for my 8 pound turkey breast.  It will come out moist tender and yummy.  I promise.

I made this using Suggestions from LadaFun (adding chicken broth, onions, celery, oregano, sage, thyme, and minced garlic) and it was absolutely amazing! I added a bit more chicken brothe because I used a larger turkey breast and added corn starch to the au jus after cooking to thinken for gravy on the meat and potatoes.  Served with corn, mashed potatoes, green beans and cranberry sauce. Was even better leftover!! Will make this again And again!!!

Didn't use the onion soup mix, but instead used 1 c. of water, a couple tbsp. of butter under the skin of the turkey, poultry seasoning, oregano, sage, and basil plus some garlic, on the skin.  Cut up an onion to go on top.  This really was a very moist and delicious turkey recipe!

I didn't use this recipe to cook my turkey, but I felt this deserved 5 stars because you gave me confidence to try to cook my turkey breast in the crock pot, and it was the best thing I have ever done!!  I used an over night marinade, but the best part of this method is no babysitting the turkey in the oven, no wondering if it is overcooked/undercooked, no trying to coordinate all the sides to come out warm and ready to serve on time with the turkey.  In fact, I also used crock pots for the mashed potatoes, stuffing, and gravy.  Serving and cleanup was a breeze, plus using crocks freed up my oven for the casserole and sweet potatoes and rolls.  It saved me a ton of time slaving in the kitchen so I could do other things.  Thank so much for this great idea!!

Used a 3 and a half pound, boneless, white meat turkey.  Rubbed the onion soup mix all over, and added a little water in the bottom of the crock pot (maybe 3/4 c).  Cooked on high for an hour, then switched to low for about 4 and a half hours.  The turkey game out moist.  The onion soup was a bit over powering for me- though my family didn't seem to mind.  It just seemed a lot of salt.  Next time I will try other seasonings, but as a base, not too shabby. I would recommend to anyone :)

This was incredible easy and very delicious!!
Like other reviewers, I did add broth to the bottom of the slow cooker, chopped carrots, onions, celery and mushrooms.
Thanks so much for posting this.

This turkey recipe is amazing! This is the first time I have ever made turkey in the slow cooker and I don't think I will ever do a traditional roast turkey again. This blew it away by far! 

I used a 5 pd boneless turkey breast. I did add a couple of extra things as per some of the previous reviewers suggestions. I never like putting meat into my slow cooker without having any type of liquid on the bottom so I added 1/4 cup of chicken broth to the bottom. I also cut up three celery stalks and a sweet onion (chopped) and put that on the bottom of the crockpot. I lifted up the skin and put the Onion soup mix under the skin  and on top. The last little addition was to put about 1 tbsp of butter cut into little chunks under the skin in different areas of the turkey. Followed the cooking directions listed and the turkey literally fell apart when it was done. It was tender and moist and had a wonderful flavor. The best turkey I have ever made by far!

I was skeptical about only using they turkey breast and one envelope of dry onion soup mix but I was greatly surprised over the results over this recipe! I did use the tip of rubbing some olive oil on the skin of the turkey and then rubbing the dry soup mix over the turkey.  Followed the directions with the cooking and with the time to rest and when I let my husband and sons try it they really did love it, even my pickiest eater. The meat was very moist, not at all dry which my husband will let me know if this is recipe is a keeper or not.  Since all the guys in the family gave a thumbs up, it is going into the recipe box as a repeat to use again in the future.

I cooked my 3lb turkey breast this way last week, and we have been nibbling off of the leftovers ever since. It is the best turkey I have EVER had. It was so easy, it was very juicy, and it had lots of flavor. I am thinking about buying a bigger crock pot so I can cook the entire Thanksgiving turkey this way later this year. Thank you so much for sharing.

Slow Cooker Turkey! Who would have thought of it! This was sooooo easy and sooooo good! I served it on Christmas Eve and everyone LOVED it! I threw some Turkey Gravy in the crock and let it cook with the turkey. Gosh, we ate that whole 10 lb breast up in 2 days! I will make this every time I use turkey!

I followed the recipe exactly except I did take the advice of others and add a little water to the bottom of the crock pot to keep my turkey from drying out.  Nice, simple meal with leftovers for sandwiches!

it's in the slow cooker right now, I only needed about 5 minutes to prepare it all.
I took the advise and added a little bit of water just to cover the botoom of the pot, and added some carrot and celery sticks, also put some melted butter on the turkey, it looks great and smells delicious, now we all are waiting for dinner to be ready. only about an hour left, gonna use some cream add that to make some gravy later. serve it with mashed potatoes and broccoli casserole. thanks for the recipe, will make this many times

We used dry vegetable soup mix and set this 1 hour on high; and about 8 hours on low. Very tasty! AND so easy! This will become a weekend staple for us!

So easy, and delicious.  Made it for Christmas last year, and we're making it again this year.  I'm going to try Garlic & Herb soup mix this year.  I think I'd slightly prefer the garlic taste to the onion taste.  I forgot to add this:  I have made this recipe twice, and both times, the pop-up timer popped WAY before the time given in the recipe.  I cooked a 6.5 lb breast for 1 hour on high, turned down to low, then timer popped at about 4 hours later.  Plan to be ready at 5-6 total hours, not the 8 in the recipe, just in case.

This was so very good.  The skin browned and the meat fell off the bone.  I will use this in summer also for sandwiches and casaroles.  A definite keeper.

OH  MY!----This rocked! I've used this repeatedly for family traditional dinners.  It does get so moist in falls apart--but it's ok with all of us! I add the gravy packet sometimes, but it really is good either way! Foolproof really.

This turned out VERY dry.  :*(  Per reviews, I added a little chicken broth and butter, as well as veggies in the crockpot. I can't imagine how dry it would've been if I hadn't done that! It fell off the bone but wasn't very good and the flavor was bland. Won't be making this one again, as much as I wanted it to work.

This recipe is awesome!!  It was hard to imagine that something this simple could be so very good, but it was.  This recipe will become a permanent one in my file.  The turkey breast was extremely juicy and full of flavor.  It was a hit with everyone.  One word of caution, if you get a breast larger than 6# it may not fit in your crockpot.  I got a 7.5# breast and had to finish my cooking time in the oven.  Everything still turned out very delicious.

I'm giving this 4 stars for being easy and moist.  Didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped.  Boring served alone, but will be really good in enchiladas, etc.  Next time will cook breast upside down.

I make this all the time and my family loves it.  The house smells great when you come home from work.  Who knew you could make such a great recipe with just soup mix.  We really enjoy the sauce and serve it over rice.  This is a keeper for us.

Very nicely done and tasty.  Definitely put a few pats of butter under the skin and add some more spices of your choice.  Nice easy way to do a turkey breast.

Came out delicious.  Only thing I did different was that I put about 2 tablespoons of butter on top of the breast so it slowly melted over the top of the turkey as it cooked.  Very easy too!!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this turkey! I've made it twice recently, and both times it came out so tender and juicy. I cooked it in the crock-pot with potatoes and a cup or so of water, then served it with gravy. Delicious and so easy, it's worth making over and over!

Thank you for sharing this recipe. The only thing I did different was I added black pepper and butter.  Everyone in my family loved it. It's one of the best slower cooker recipe out there.

I was skeptical at first, but this recipe turned out wonderfully!  I added some chicken broth and minced garlic, then used the juices to make gravy when the turkey was finished cooking.  Tender, juicy, awesome!

I made this for my husband and I for Christmas dinner and we were both pleasantly surprised at how tender and juicy the meat was.  I used approximately an 8lb. breast (thawed) and the day before I washed it, rubbed it with butter and the soup mix along with some rubbed sage, and put a can of chicken broth in the bottom of the slow cooker and left it in the fridge overnight. On Christmas morning, I turned on the crock pot and put it on high for about two hours. It smelled wonderful and I kept thinking anything this easy couldn't possibly be any good. It was DELICIOUS but I must say that my gravy did not thicken as I would have liked. It tasted great, but was just a little too thin - maybe I didn't need the broth after all......I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely the best, moist turkey breast I've ever made.  You are right, no liquid necessary.  IThe only thing I did different, is strain the liquid because some family members don't like things floating in their gravy.  That's it, thickened the juice with cornstarch at water in pan, made the best gravy ever.  May try adding mushrooms, to the gravy next time.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe.

Excellent!   No fuss, I put a dish towel over the top to retain the heat. Slow cooker method gave me more stove space :) Also let turkey sit before carving.  Took advice from other comments... rubbed butter under skin, used onion soup mix along w/ favorite spices for my own rub, put in fridge in zip lock bag day before, enuf juices for a great gravy... I could go on and on.  Leftover turkey was moist for a week! Great turkey leftover meals... GreenChili Enchildas, Turkey SpringRolls, Turkey Monte Cristo... Mmm Mmm Mmm

This was ok, not great.  I was really looking forward to it, but the flavor was just so-so, and the meat was not near as moist as I would have hoped after being in the crock pot all day.  I rubbed onion soup all over, under the skin, everywhere, but it didn't taste especially special - just like plain old turkey breast.  Sorry, this just didn't do it for us!

I was reluctant to put the turkey breast in without liquid.  I went with the instructions and I'm glad I did!  This was sooooo easy and came out perfect!

Turned out really moist & flavorful!  Placed on rack in my slow cooker and treated it much like my roasted turkey:  rubbed with herb butter (rosemary & thyme), surrounded with chopped celery, onion & carrots, covered bottom of pot with chicken broth.  So easy and it freed up my oven.  Will definitely make for Thanksgiving again!

Very good and very easy.  Hubby said best turkey he ever ate.  I made an 8.6 lb breast and used 2 packets of the soup mix.  It was too "tall" for my crock, so I made my own lid out of aluminum foil; made sure it was snug and cooked on high for 2 hours instead of 1.  Will definitely make again. :)

Wow, what a great recipe! Me and by bf made this for our Thanksgiving turkey. We used a 4.86 pould turkey breast. He made his own rub similar to an onion soup rub. We sauteed onions, celery, and carrots first and added some white wine. Seared the turkey for a little bit in the pan and added everything to the slow cooker, high for the 1st hour, low for about 3.5. It was moist and juicy, the meat fell apart like a roast. Very impressed and was able to use the oven for our sides. Yummy!

I made this turkey for Thanksgiving last year and everyone (even those who normally only eat dark meat because white meat is "too dry") fell in love with it! Thanksgiving is only 3 days away and I've already got my turkey breasts in the fridge ready for the crockpot this year. Last year, I did add a few other seasonings (pepper, garlic powder, paprika) and I smeared butter around the edges. It couldn't have been any better. When we removed the turkey from the crockpot, it literally fell off the bones. Absolutely wonderful! My entire family and my in-laws are looking forward to Thursday!

I have used this recipe several times with great success. For a family of two, this is an ideal way to satisfy your turkey craving, and you WILL get some good stock with which to make gravy for your essential mashed potatoes. I have to agree with those who criticize reviewers who may or may not have tried the recipe. Dbray, with his/her aversion to MSG, has apparently NOT tried the recipe...so leave it alone, already.

I was so hopeful about this recipe and really wanted to like it but we didn't care for it at all.  I followed the directions, but cut down on the time as others suggested.  It was still somewhat dry and we didn't like the taste of the turkey.

Ok, I'm re-writing a review for this. I probably should not give it 5 stars because I changed this recipe by quite a bit and it is wonderful! Diced 1/2 onion and 4 stalks of celery and 2 tablespoons of minced garlic to the bottom of the slow cooker. I poured 1/2 cup of vegetable broth over that. I rubbed the 3 lb. turkey breast all over with the packet of onion soup. Then spooned a can of Healthy Request Cream of Chicken soup over the top and sides of the turkey breast. Cooked on low for 6 hours, then cut the breast into slices and cooked for another 2 hours. The turkey was extremely moist! It made a wonderful thin gravy. Served over wild rice. YUM!

Amazing! I had never thought to cook a turkey breast in a slow cooker. I brushed my turkey with melted butter before I rubbed it with the dry onion soup mix, and then left it alone. My house smelled fantastic, and my girls went back for seconds. Needless to say, I don't have many leftovers!

Rubbed 1 Tbsp. butter all over the interior of my slow cooker, rubbed 7 lb. bone-in turkey breast all over with onion soup mix (incl. under the skin). The turkey breast came with a pop-up timer. After 4 hours on LOW, it popped. I switched the slow cooker to WARM for about a 1/2 hour, and then sat down to eat. VERY GOOD! Not as good as a brined, oven-roasted turkey breast, but pretty darn close. AND, I didn't have to fire up the oven on a hot, humid summer day to enjoy this delicious meal. Like many, I never thought a turkey breast would come out great in a slow cooker. I was wrong! If you crave roasted turkey on a torrid summer day, this is the way to go!

Easy and great!  As per another reviewer, I put a layer of chopped celery and carrots in the bottom of the crock pot, other than that, no changes.  The turkey came out moist and very flavorful!

I ended up adding pretty much all but the kitchen sink for seasonings... Including a packet of mushroom gravy mix- which was the icing on the cake! What a great idea for another easy slow cooker day.

How easy this is!  In a small bowl, to the dry onion soup mix, I also added 1 tsp. of poultry seasoning, 1 tsp. of thyme, and 2 tsp. of paprika.  After putting some butter on the turkey breast, I covered it with this soup-spice mixture and followed the recipe as stated.  Moist and wonderful tasting!

This is very good.  Great way to prepare turkey breast with out all the fuss.  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions.  Added celery stalks and a chopped onion to the bottom of the crock.  Also added 1 tsp minced garlic, and I sprinkled about a half tsp. poultry seasoning over the top with the onion soup mix.  I put about a half cup water in the bottom of the crock. My turkey breast was still slightly frozen after defrosting in my fridge for 2 days so I cooked it on high for 7 hours.  Wonderful flavor and was falling off the bone tender.  Will be making this again.

This has to be the easiest thing I have ever made in the crock pot! It almost feels like cheating to have something so delicious come out at the end of the day, get so many rave reviews, and know I did very little to deserve the praise! It's a flexible recipe and I will probably try some others suggestions of adding vegetables and such but try it exactly as the recipe reads the first time. You will not be disappointed! I actually have this in the crock pot right now, can't wait to come home to a delicious smelling house this evening!

I used the crockpot to cook a turkey breast on Christmas in case there was anyone who did not like prime rib. I did not use the onion soup mix, just salt and pepper. The turkey breast was 7# but since my "slow cooker" is slow in name only it was done in about 4 hours. I turned it on "warm" (where it continued to cook) until the rest of the meal was ready. In retrospect, I should have just taken it out, refrigerated it and reheated it if anyone wanted some-nobody did anyway. I thought it was way overcooked but once it had cooled, it sliced nicely for sandwiches. I will make this again just for us and take it out when it is done and not when a company dinner is planned around a particular time. By the way, you can cook most any meat without liquid in a crockpot. I do it with pork butt/shoulder and with beef.  Much more concentrated flavor not to mention how easy it is.

YUM, this turkey breast was moist, delicious and falling off the bone.  It sure did make our house smell good while it was cooking.  I did add a small amount of chicken stock to the crock pot, but probably wasn't necessary.  This is a recipe I will use again and again.  Just make sure the turkey breast will fit; mine was almost too large and I had to turn it on its side.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is amazing! I didn't use the onion soup mix, I just used my own seasonings and lined the bottom of the pot with carrots, potatoes and onions. Then I used about a cup of chicken stock on the bottom to help with the gravy... It turned out perfect! SO juicy!! I'm so glad I found this!

I made this for Christmas eve dinner, but I will definitly make it again throughout the year.  I was afraid that it wouldn't produce enough liquid, so I added some olive oil, which was good, but unnecessary. My meat thermometer alerted me that the turkey was done after the third hour, so I turned the crokpot down to 'warm' for the rest of the afternoon.

I was hesitant... but glad I did!  Delicious!  I added fresh cranberries and carrots in the breast cavity, and carrots and an onion halved in the crockpot. Cooked 1 hr on high, then flipped breast on the other side for 1 hr on high (breast was 7.5 pounds). Then, breast down with the cranberries and carrots for another 7 hrs on low. Total of 9 hrs.  Probably could have been less cook time, but I was a bit nervous as it was 1st time.  Totally fell off the bone, soooooo moist!  Next time, I will add brown rice near the end.  So glad I tried it.  Absolutely delish.

We love this recipe! It's so easy to make and it's delicious and moist, not dry like roasted turkey can get. For this past Thanskgiving I made 6 of these (2 to a slow cooker) and got rave reviews.

This turkey was fall-off-the-bone too-die-for!  Very delicious and very easy.  I had a 5.5lb bone-in turkey breast.  I coated the inside of my slow cooker and the outside of the turkey with butter, stuffed the cavity with onion and garlic, and let it go.  After 7 hours in the slow cooker, I took the turkey out and roasted it for 30 min to crisp up the skin.  Everybody loved it!  I will definitely be making turkey like this again.

This was awesome!  I added chopped onions and celery to the bottom of the crockpot.  I cooked on high for an hour and then on low for about 4.5.  It was perfect!  Everyone in my house ate seconds...and that is rare!!  I will now make turkey more than once a year!

It may have been just the turkey, but mine turned out dry and stringy and hard to eat. I didn't like the flavor, either, because of the onion soup. I won't do this again.

I have done this several times, but I like my turkey browned, so I pop it in the convection oven for about 20 minutes at the end and it comes out picture perfect.   Also, I add about a cup of chicken broth to the turkey before slow-cooking - just enhances the flavor even more, and the broth makes wonderful gravy right in the slow cooker.  Just add 3-4 T. flour and stir til it thickens a little, add salt (I don't add but a pinch) and pepper.   My family loves turkey breast done this way, better than roasted!

I made this for a work pot luck and everyone went crazy for it!  Did add a cut up onion, couple of stalks of celery and a few carrots to the bottom of the crockpot, and a little water.  Everyone commented on how moist the turkey was!  Great recipe!

I made this like a stew with carrots and potatoes. It was just way too salty for me. I knew it would be though because of the onion soup mix. Why do i keep testing my taste buds, thinking suddenly that will change!

absolutely wonderful.  This year I have nailed the turkey, dressing and gravy.  Thank you!  I bought 2 (3 pound boneless turkey breasts).  Cooked one ahead of time. Diced and froze the meat to be used in the dressing.  Refrigerated the broth, skimmed the fat, and froze for gravy later. :-) Tah Dah.

I've made this twice and following other suggetions here is what I do. 1) brush/spread butter over breast 2) cook on low for 50 min. a lb. so if you need to cook it all day get a bigger breast. So for a recipe that needs so few modifications I give it 4 stars.  It would get 5 stars if slow cookers could crisp the skin!

Excellent recipe.  I only have one oven.  I knew my daughter would be using it to bake so I put the turkey breast in the crock pot.  I put a sliced onion on the bottom of the with 1/2 cup of water.  I seasoned the turkey with soy sauce and garlic.  After about 7 hours on low, the turkey was done and I had some great broth.  Thank you.

I bought a smaller turkey breast ..found this and decided to give it a go because of the simplicity and good reviews. I was surprised at how good it was! I just adjusted my cooking time down because I only had a 3 lb. breast..easy. This was delicious AND moist.

Followed directions but this turned out a little dry for me.  However I used a 3-ish lb. turkey breast, and it cooked for almost 11 hours - next time I need to decrease that.  I put white wine and some water in the bottom, along with a few quartered red potatoes and quartered small yellow onions.  The best parts were those onions and potatoes!  Made gravy with what was left in the bottom by adding cornstarch and heating in a pot on the stove.  Next time I want to figure out a way to put some garlic in the dish - maybe put a head in the bottom with the potatoes and onions?  Overall, a recipe that I will use again.

WOW!!  Best turkey EVER!!  I added few additional ingredients...I sliced a large onion and laid on the bottom of the crock pot.  Rubbed the turkey with Lipton's Beefy Mushroom Soup Mix.  Added the turkey breast and topped with 2 pats of butter, a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, cracked pepper and a clove of garlic!  Fabulous!!

Very good!  Decided to try this recipes as is...(seemed too simple, but was short on time)  -  and I'm glad I did.  Both my kids and husband loved it!  Made great sandwiches the next day.  Very moist and flavorful - I'm still shocked it turned out so well with only two ingredients.  Will definitely make again!

Excellent! I did add 1 cup chicken broth and place it on a bed of onions like others had done. I used an 8lb breast b/c thats what i had. I will be making this again. Very simple! I made this again exactly as recipe is written and it was great. just the onion soup mix gives it plenty of flavor. thanks again.

This was quite easy to make and I didn't have to turn on my oven on a warm day.  I had a turkey breast that was about 6 1/2 lbs.  I added about 3 tablespoons of butter at the bottom of my crockpot. Rubbed the breast with olive oil first then with 1 whole package of onion soup mix. I also added 1/2 cup of white wine. Set the crockpot on high for about 2 hours and then low for about 6.  Next time I will cook for less.  The breast was done sooner then I had planned.  It was still pretty moist considering I over cooked it a bit.  I strained the juices from the pot and added cornstarch to make a gravy.  The gravy was absolutely wonderful. The reason I am giving it four stars is because the bird was down right ugly !!  Even though the soup mix/rub gives it a brownish color there is no mistaking that it is not roasted and the skin was rubbery. It's not pretty enough to serve to guests unless you carve it before anyone even sees the thing ! But the flavor was very good. Thanks for sharing. I never thought of putting a whole turkey breast in a crockpot !

I'm a believer! I made this for dinner tonight and can't believe how moist the turkey was. I used a 3 1/2 lb. bone-in breast and cooked it on high for 3 hours. It was just perfect. I added a few tablespoons of water to the bottom of the pot. Rubbed the turkey with 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix, closed the cover and walked away! Will defintely make this again.

This turned out surprisingly well!  I fought the urge to add liquid and followed the directions exactly... very tasty! Served this for Thanksgiving and got lots of compliments!

This is really good. Makes a super moist turkey breast. The onion soup mixed with the turkey juices makes for a great gravy. For gravy use 2 tbls of butter mixed/whisked over medium heat with 2 tbls of flour. The only thing that I didn't like about this turkey was the smell while it was cooking but it tasted great. Also, I used some fresh sage, rosemary and thyme.

I hate when people change the recipe, but for this one I didn't have the onion soup..I used Lipton Beefy Onion (I know, sounds weird)..but my husband told me he'd divorce me if I did it any differently the next time and that he would expect this monthly! I cannot say enough how fabulous this was and amazingly simple!  Mine was in the crockpot for almost 10 hours on low..it was sheer perfection!  Storebought mashed potatoes, pole beans and cranberry sauce..even the kids raved about it!  I also stirred in a can of cream of celery to the juices to thicken.  THANKS!!!

Excellent, and so easy.  If it comes out dry, I think you did something wrong.  I also used a boneless butterball turkey breast and cooked it right out of the freezer.  I defrosted the gravy packet and added half of it immediately along with the onion soup mix.  2 hours on high and 2 hours on low -- perfect.  So moist and tender.  Great sliced up for hot turkey sandwiches or a gourmet turkey dinner.  You decide!  You won't be disappointed.

I had never cooked a turkey breast before this recipe and certainly never in the slow cooker so I accidentally bought one that was just slightly too big; I had to cover the slow cooker with aluminum foil for the first few hours until the breast had softened enough to get the lid on. Anyway, I made a few changes to enhance this recipe and here they are: in addition to the onion soup mix I rubbed the turkey breast with 1 tsp. poultry seasoning and 1/2 Tbsp. minced garlic; then after I got the turkey settled in the crock I surrounded it with 4 stalks of celery, 2 small pkgs. of baby carrots and 1 chopped onion, sprinkled the vegetables with 1 tsp. poultry seasoning and 1/2 Tbsp. minced garlic and drizzled with 1/4 cup chicken broth. The breast, even though still slightly frozen, was cooked is less time than the recipe calls for so I simply put the cooker on warm. Right before serving I made gravy out of the drippings using cornstarch. This recipe was a great jumping off point for me to make a mini-Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks for posting this simple but versatile recipe. BTW I used the carcass from the breast for After Thanksgiving Turkey Soup from this site and it was great.

I have made this several times since I discovered it. I line my crockpot with sliced celery, carrots, & chopped onions as well as some chicken broth. This keeps the turkey tender and makes a great base for gravy and soups. I use a little less onion soup mix b/c too much  makes it taste artificial, in my opinion.

This is excellent.  I added a few other dry ingredients--poultry seasoning, oregano, thyme, cilantro, and I seasoned the chicken breast w/pepper and seasoned salt. Please try this recipe and don't pass it up--you will love it.

I had a 7.5 oz breast and put a cut onion in the bottom of the crock pot, along with 8 oz chicken broth.  Then added granulated garlic, thyme and sage to the onion soup mix before rubbing under and over the skin. Put the breast in with the meatiest part to the bottom of the crock pot, to keep it moist.  Cooked on high one hour and then on low for another 6, turning over for the last two hours.  It was very moist and flavorful - and no trouble at all.  Best of all, the oven was free for all the other Thanksgiving dishes.  Thanks for sharing this great idea!

I followed the recipe with two minor exceptions:  After washing and patting the 8lb breast dry I wiped it with the wrappers from two quarters of butter so the soup mix would adhere and then sprinkled the breast with celery seed.  The fork-tender breast cut very nicely.  

The drippings, in conjunction with the gravy packet that came with the breast and some thickening, turned into a LOT of flavorful gravy.

Much easier and probably more energy efficient than roasting in the oven.  I'll definitely do it this way from now on.

I made this last night 11/18/08,and I used 2 envelopes of soup mix,and seasoned with salt and pepper,and while it was cooking it smelled wonderful!Could hardly wait for dinner!And it was good and not as dry as an oven baked,but NEXT time I will add more seasonings to fit my tastes and only cook it on low for 5 hours,so that it doesn't fall apart as bad.(Total of 6 hours)

Awesome.  Of course it's not like slowly roasting it in the oven but it was surprisingly good in the slow cooker.  Make sure you use a large spatula to take it out as it really does fall off the bone AND make sure you make homemade gravy with the liquid.  WONDERFUL GRAVY.

This was really great.  I didn't use all of the onion soup mix packet because I didn't want it to be too salty, and it ended up perfect.  The whole family loved it.  I usually use my roaster for turkey but it can be a real pain - this was much easier for just a typical dinner night.

Due to my schedule I had to put it in for about 8 hours - all on low, but I still overcooked it.  I used a 5 3/4lb turkey breast.  I followed other suggestions and put onion, carrot, garlic & celery in the bottom of my crockpot along with 1 C. chicken broth.  Even though I rubbed the onion soup mix all over the turkey breast, including under the skin, I didn't notice much flavor.  I'm sure if I hadn't overcooked it, it would have been better, but I was looking for something with at least some flavor.  The remaining liquid in the crockpot, once strained, made a wonderful gravy however.

This is all of what they say, easy and delisious. My family and extended family loved it. I was sceptical about not putting any fluids in at all but it was soooo juicey. I didn't do it in the crock pot though, the turkey breast I bought was to big for my pot, so I did it in the oven in a turkey bag. I followed the direction for the bag and added flour.

Can someone please tell me why I have never made a turkey breast in the slow cooker? I cannot even tell you how good this came out. 7 hours on low & BAM...a delicious and very moist turkey breast was ready. The meat was so moist it fell right off the bone! I made some gravy, stuffing, corn & cranberry sauce and it was like a mini Thanksgiving dinner on a Wednesday night!
I will definitly make this one again!

This recipe is excellent. I didn't have any onion soup mix so I covered the turkey breast in McCormick's Herb Chicken Seasoning the  Garlic & Herb Flavor, it turned out delicious! 

The moistest turkey I have ever cooked!

I cooked it exactly like the recipe instructed. I am looking forward to having the leftovers on sandwiches tomorrow.

I used a 6 Lbs. Turkey Breast and cooked for 1 hour on HIGH and 5 Hours on Low and it was done perfectly. Also, instead of the onion soup, I used a Cajun Seasoning and rubbed the breast with olive oil. I added some broth and wish I hadn't, it made enough juice on its own. Delicious and very easy.

This was super easy & turned out great.  It came from the store pre-seasoned with Italian herbs and spices, I also mixed together some melted butter with onion powder, garlic powder and some salt/pepper, rubbed on both sides, and cooked on low for about 7 hours. Husband loved it. Thank you!

This was so easy and delicious!  I followed other reviewers' advice and added sliced onion, celery, and baby carrots to the bottom of the crock pot before putting the turkey in.  I also added 1/4 cup water, but it wasn't necessary.  There was plenty of juice.  I used store brand onion soup mix and a turkey breast with a pop up timer.  It was close to 7 lbs. and it was done after 1 hr. on high and 5 hrs. on low.  I let it cook another 1/2 hr. just in case.  The turkey was so moist and delicious, the whole family loved it!  The leftovers are awesome too!

I was a bit disappointed by this recipe after reading all the wonderful reviews. Based on everyone's advice I added a couple of pats of butter to the bottom of the crock pot, a 1/4 cup of water, some baby carrots and a coarsely chopped onion, rubbed a bit of olive oil over the breast and then rubbed in the onion soup mix packet and tried to get some of it under the skin. I watched for signs of the turkey drying out and my 4.9 lb bone-in breast was done after 6 hours (1 on high, 5 on low). The skin never got remotely golden colored, I could barely taste any flavoring at all, and even though there was around 2.5 cups of juice at the bottom the turkey meat itself wasn't very moist. It wasn't exactly dry,  but it definitely wasn't falling off the bone and there's just no way I could ever confuse it for being dark meat. I would not serve this for company without there being some improvement in taste. I purchased the onion soup mix only yesterday morning so I know there were no problems with the spices being too old - but I did have to buy the store brand of soup mix since they were out of the national brand, so I'd recommend sticking with the national brand if possible just in case. The taste was probably a 3, but the ease of cooking was definitely a 5, so I gave it an overall rating of 4.

I gave this recipe two stars only because it was easy. The turkey was ok, the onion soup mix is boring.  I served this turkey along with one that was oven roasted at a large get-together.  Everyone liked the oven roasted turkey far better so the leftovers from this recipe ended up in a casserole.

I give this a mixed review because I think it requires butter, which the recipe does not stipulate. Otherwise, the turkey would be very very dry. Also, if you are using a boneless turkey breast, I recommend slicing the breast lengthwise as soon as possible to make for more tender pieces. If you follow this recipe as is, you will have a dry bird. A key component of slow cooking is plenty of liquid. I highly recommend following the suggestions offered below by other reviewers to generate more of it.

This turned out great.  I forgot to put it in the crock pot before work, so I had my daughter throw it in after school.  Only used 1/2 pack of soup mix (I'm not a huge fan) on a boneless breast, and cooked on high for 4 hours.

It was only 4 of us for Thanksgiving this year, and to my guests' horror, I decided to make a turkey breast in the slow cooker!  About one hour before dinner, they were all lingering in the kitchen because the aroma was so delicious they wanted to eat early.  I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and added a bed of veggies (onions and celery) and put some butter over the turkey.  My slow cooker was too small for the breast, so I cut it in half before seasoning with the onion soup mix.  I also added 1/4 cup water for moisture.  The meat had reached temperature about 5 hours into the slow heat period, so I put it in the broiler to brown the top skin and returned it to the slow cooker in the "keep warm" setting until dinner time.  The veggies I used for cooking were delicious as part of the dressing, and there were lots of dripping for gravy (which was awesome because it had so much flavor).  The meat was moist and fell off the bone like magic.  I will definitively do this again and share it with friends.

Don't cook on low for 7 hours if you have a new crockpot. I have a newer crockpot and just cooked it on low for 6 hours. It was very tender and delicious.

I used two smaller turkey breasts, together equaling about 5 lbs. I also added carrots, onions, celery, and potatoes. About half way through cooking, I checked it and there didn't seem to be enough liquid, so I added about three cups of water & some chicken buillion. Next time, I will probably use 2 packages of onion soup  mix because I added the veggies. The gravy was also nice. Even though the turkey was a little dry, I received rave reviews from my family and was told I could make this anytime.

This is definitely a keeper recipe.  I make this at least once a month now.  My husband loves and it is so versatile.  I add a few pats of margarine to the skin after rubbing the whole bird with the onion soup mix and layer quartered onions and carrots/celery around it.  Turns out fabulous every time!

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I MADE A TURKEY BREAST IN THE CROCK POT.  IT WAS GREAT.  I ADDED BUTTER AROUND THE POT & A BIT OF BROTH IN THE BOTTOM.  MY HUSBAND & I LOVED IT.  WILL BE MAKING AGAIN.  THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE

OH MY GOSH! I've never made a turkey before so I decided I would start small with a turkey breast. Not only was this easy, but the results were over the top. I seriously don't think I've ever had turkey that was so moist before. The meat just fell off the bones. This last week I decided to try to put a whole chicken in the crockpot in order to use it for chicken chili. The results were the same. Mmmmm....

This was so easy and turned out delicious!  I used one split boneless, skinless turkey breast.  I laid it on a bed of onions & carrots and I added just a 1/4 cup water at the beginning.  I cooked it on high for 2 hours and then 2 more hours on low and that was it.  There were plenty of drippings to make delicous gravy.  Wonderful!  Will definitely make it again.

This was incredible! Very moist, tasty, and stress-free! Any tips on how to get the skin browned? Mine didn't brown anything like the picture, but tasted fabulous! This will definitely be something I make several times each year.

Oh my gosh, this was FABULOUS!!! I used a 4.5# turkey breast and one packet of onion soup and stuffed it in my crock pot and it was so juicy and tender and seasoned perfectly!  I used the drippings to make a great gravy.  Nothing was bitter, it wasn't overly salty (for our tastes) and it was the juciest whitemeat i've ever had.  Christmas dinner can't get much easier than this!

We found this rather bland and though there was juice, the turkey was dry.  We managed to save it with lots of mayo, onions, lettuce, tomatoes for sandwiches and it gave us the quick, no fuss  meal we needed.  I'll probably try it again with more spices and less cooking time.

Ok so I know I shouldn't give this 5 stars after I made a change to the recipe but I am anyway. I typically always make a recipe as written first before I do anything differently. However, I guess I read so many reviews first where people had covered it in butter before pouring on the onion soup mix that in my head it became part of the recipe. Only after I came back to write a review after my 3rd time of making this in the last 2 months did I notice that butter was never even called for. But now I will always use it because it's so amazing. So basically I kept everything the same except I covered in softened butter before I covered it in the soup mix. Also, since every time I have made this was on a work day, I didn't have time to cook on high for an hour then turn to low for 7 hours before I left for work, I have always started it on low at 7:30 am and have come home to a delicious, fall off the bone turkey at 5:00. This will be in our rotation at least every couple of weeks now. The juices make an amazing gravy. The leftovers make a fantastic Turkey pot pie as well.

The cooking time is way too long. After the first 3 hours I would suggest sticking a meat thermometer in it every hour or so after that. With the suggested cooking time In the original recipe it is over cooked and a bit too dry. I will try it again with a shorter cooking time.

The best and easiest turkey I’ve ever tried.No more working  myself to a frenzy for Holiday Meals.After reading the reviews for this recipe, I made a few changes. I diced some celery and onions and used chicken broth instead of water.The broth was so good after I made my dressing and gravy, I froze the rest until I need it.My family has asked me to only cook this turkey!

I have used both low and high heat setting on my crockpot and have great results. All slow cookers tend to have different temps on each setting based on brand. Getting the internal temp to around 165 degrees is the key. Start checking internal temp in the thickest part of the bird after about 3 hours with a good instant read thermometer and at about 165 remove and let it sit a little bit  to let juices set. A very juicy bird every time. I very coursely chop some onion, celery and  carrots and put in the bottom of the pot with the gobbler on top. No need to add liquid. YUM!

Super easy. This will be my turkey go to recipe going forward. I did follow another reviewers advice by adding onions, celery and cup of broth, I used liquids left after cooking to make a gravy. For cooking time I used ratio 1 hour on low for each pound of breast, cooked a 5 lbs. bone in turkey breast (frozen) for 5 hours. Incredibly moist and delicious.

We all loved this turkey, and it's the easiest turkey i've ever made!  The meat was moist, and the onion soup mix gave it a good color and flavor. I made my turkey exactly like the recipe, but mine was smaller.  I had a 3 lb. turkey breast. It was frozen, so I thawed it in the refrigerator.  It was wrapped in a string bag that had to stay on. Nevertheless,  I cooked it for the whole time listed. The onion soup mix still rubbed in well, even though there was no skin. The directions on the package said to add water. I didn't want the rub to come off, so I added a scant quarter cup. Everything worked to perfection.

Can't rave about this recipe for slow cooker turkey breast  enough!  This is the second time I've made this and it's just simple, stupid, good.  This is easily the best thing to come out of my crock pot ever.  The easiest, most succulent and tasty roasted turkey breast ever!  You just can't mess this up.

Made this recipe exactly as written with one exception.  Since I live at a high altitude where things dry out quickly,  I put enough chicken broth in the slow cooker to just barely cover the bottom before placing the turkey breast on top.  The turkey breast was 5.75 lbs, I cooked it on high for one hour then on low for four hours.  Although the temperature of the meat was at 185 by that time, the meat was tender and very juicy and tasted wonderful.  I made gravy from the drippings and the gravy packet that was packed with the Honeysuckle White turkey breast.  The slow cooker I used is fairly new and cooks at the higher temperatures so I have to adjust almost all recipes for less time than the recipe calls for.

Dont let the simplicity of this "recipe" fool you. It's. Amazing. 

And of course, easy. Once your turkey is done you can just turn your cockpot to warm and  finish cooking whatever else without worry of overcooking. 

It creates several cups of stock on it's own (No need to add water) for delicious gravy!

Fantastic turkey breast.  We used a 3lb bone in breast and cooked according to instructions.  I added about a third of a cup of apple juice to ensure there was enough liquid.  The turkey was cooked perfectly, juicy and tender.  We will be making this again!

I tried this recipe this past weekend.  It was fabulous!  The meat stayed very juicy, not dried out as in a larger roasting pan.
I am saving this recipe and doing it again and again.

I do this every year- but I also add a can of cranberry sauce and make sure to have some broth at the bottom so there is enough moisture- make sure you put the breast side down into the sauce or it will dry out!

I love this recipe .  I softened 1 stick of butter and mixed the Onion soup mix with the butter and then smeared it all over the breast.  Then I cooked it breast down so it would keep the moisture and flavor.  Will definitely do it again.

It was so so SO dry. I left it on low about an hour longer than the recipe calls for (stuck in traffic) but could an extra hour really turn a turkey breast to cardboard? This recipe is promptly being deleted from my recipe box. :-(

I prepared this dish for Christmas it was a HUGE hit. It's moist, juicy and above all simple. I added a little water to the bottom of the crock pot.  I used the reserve as a base for my cornbread dressing. It added just the amount of seasoning needed to make the dressing a hit as well.

This the best way of cooking a turkey. Moist and tasty but best of all, easy. Did changed it a bit. Used fresh herbs(rosemary and garlic). Also added 2 halves of fresh lemon.

I took all skin off.  used chicken broth instead of water.  put chunks of carrots, celery and onions in bottom under turkey.  Did the rest of recipe as is.  Delicious.  Mixed some flour and butter for roux and then added in strained juice.  Made delicious gravy with minimal skimming.

I tried this recipe and it came out very dry. I had a 7lb turkey. I put some butter on the bird and in the crock pot. I didn't follow the recipe time. Since I was going to work, I put on low and 8 hours later it was way over cooked. Be sure to stay with it the first time to know the cooking time for your crockpot. I did have the most delicious gravy. I'll try again when at home to monitor.

Really good!  It is very tender and tasty!  I added chopped celery, garlic, onion, carrots, fresh sage and parsley to flavor a gravy at the end.  Next time I'm going to add a thigh for dark meat.  Superior leftovers!

As easy as a recipe can get and the result is tender, well-cooked and delicious.  Great for working parents .  Takes literally 10 minutes to prep into the crock pot. Great for leftovers, too.

Mixed the onion soup with a stick of softened butter and put the mixture under the skin.  I also used a cup of chicken broth in the slow cooker to keep it moist.  The butter and broth made a delicious gravy.

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious!  The turkey turned out very moist and tender.  There was an inch or two of liquid in the crockpot that I thickened with cornstarch - it made wonderful gravy.  I used Lipton Recipe Secrets Onion Soup mix.  This is a recipe I will definitely make again - even for Thanksgiving! I figure I can bake drumsticks/thighs separately for those that prefer the dark meat.

I've made this a lot, and the family loved it. Today, because I had  accidentally thawed the wrong glacier of poultry, I tried it with a whole 10-pound turkey. Because I had a long day at work, it cooked on high for 6 hours, then sat on "warm" for about 4 hours. It was fully cooked and tasted great--and produced a LOT of broth. I don't think it had to cook that long; I was just out of the house that long. I  HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

Loved it!!!!  I put onions, carrots and celery in the bottom of the crock pot.  I also rubbed everything with butter (inside and out) prior to putting on the soup mix.  The only other seasoning I used was pepper.  I put it on low for about 9 hours.  It was awesome!!  So moist, tender, and flavorful.

I made this today for our Christmas Eve dinner.  Wow, it turned out better than expected.  I was a little nervous since I could only find a 9 lb turkey breast, which is 3 pounds larger than what the recipe called for.  I cooked it on high for 2 hours instead of one and on low for an additional 7 hours.  It was perfect and super juicy.  I will use this recipe in lieu of a whole turkey from this point forward.  Thanks!

this recipe was a welcomed addition to my thanksgiving dinner this year.
I did a turkey breast and was amazed how well it turned out. I was actually doing the turkey for a friend. my husband does not care for turkey. Needless to say after I tasted it , I decided to add a couple slices to the table. he ate that thing up!!! thanks, I have already been sharing this recipe and I look forward to doing it again for Christmas. Thank you m_sally for submitting this recipe. LOVED IT!!!

I am so excited to find this recipe and the great reviews.  I am cooking this right now.  I have a tiny kitchen and a tiny oven so the crockpot is my answer.  I am cooking for two and using a 3 lb turkey breast.  I know it will come out wonderfully tasty!

I did this but used dry veggy soup mix (didn't have dry onion). It came out moist, tender and tasted like turkey and stuffing! WONDERFUL!

Always delicious! I have made this numerous times. I never add liquid. Usually, I place the turkey on baby carrots and the carrots are also very tasty.

I have made this numerous times.  The only change I made is to add about a half stick of butter rubbed on the turkey to  make the soup mix stick.  The leftovers made excellent soup.  Simply shred turkey, pour in a box or so of chicken broth and a bag of frozen soup veggies and let it cook in crock pot and 4-5 hours on low.

My favorite method of doing a turkey breast. I add about 1/2 cup of chicken broth in slow cooker, and a layer of sliced onion. Along with the onion soup, I sprinkle on garlic powder, onion powder and a little rubbed sage. Always moist and flavorful. Have passed this method of turkey breast prep to others who love it!

This recipe was great! I was skeptical about not using any liquid, but it worked well and was super juicy. There was enough juice to make a super gravy. I'm planning on using this method at thanksgiving for extra turkey.

My bone-in turkey breast turned out succulent and juicy - lots of liquid to make gravy too.  For my husband and myself, I will never do a big bird in the oven again!

Made this for Christmas Eve and everyone enjoyed it. I added a bit of water in the bottom of the slow cooker and rubbed the turkey with butter. Couldn't have been simpler.

So... I am a single man who likes to cook, but I work two jobs.. so when is there time?  I find I've gained weight because fast food is just not good for you.  I reclaimed my croc pot!  About two weeks ago I bought a 6.5 lbs bone in turkey breast, thinking Christmas day would be the start of my new years diet, and what is more Christmas dinner than Turkey?  So I thought I'd try this recipe.  The turkey is moist and delicious, didn't come out dry as I saw one poster said.  I did take a tbsp of butter and greased the croc, as well as drizzled 2 tbspn butter over the turkey.  I followed one of the other posters idea and put 3 cut up celery stalks at the bottom of the croc as well as rubbed the turkey with other spices, it turned out fantastic.  I do wish though that the stock would have been more of what I'd like for a soup, but I can always find a way to turn it into something.  Thanks for the lovely idea, this will become a staple in my home!

Best ratio of good-to-easy that I've ever found, turkey or otherwise. I'd recommend one change: popping it in the oven for the last 30-45 minutes!  Crisps the skin beautifully without taking anything away from the tender juiciness of the meat.

Also scattered pearl onions, carrots, broccoli in the bottom for the chicken to sit on and covered those just to the top with garlic-flavored chicken broth.  Made a brilliant side dish with no extra work.

Doing this again next Thanksgiving for sure.  Thanks, Ms. Sally!

I was skeptical at first about this recipe. Let me tell you it is AWESOME. I will never make a turkey breast any other way. Everyone wanted this recipe. The only thing I did was add half a stick of butter, cut it up and placed it on the top. I cannot brag enough on how good this was.

The turkey was dry and lacked flavor.  I love slow cooker recipes; however, I will stick with cooking my turkey in the oven.

I fixed this turkey breast last year for Christmas.  It was delicious, moist and fall off the bone tender.  Plan on doing it again this year.

I love this recipe! So easy and so yummy! I made just one modification, I cut up 1 stick of butter into tablespoon sizes and put 3/4 on the bottom of my crock pot and then I put the rest on top of the turkey.I will be making this for many more years to come!

I used a different recipe I found on here for Rosemary Roasted Turkey, but I did cook a 3lb breast in the crock pot and WOW! Best Turkey breast I ever had. Never thought it would be so tender in the crock pot. I would really recommend to anyone to give the crock a try for turkey breast! I also added turkey broth to the crock, with potatoes quartered and some carrots. YUMMMM!!!!!

I have this cooking in the crock pot as I type this.  I've made it several times and it comes out perfect.  I do not use the onion soup packet (has MSG).  Instead I use butter or olive oil with black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  I add potatoes and carrots toward the end of cooking.

Another stellar review for this dish. "Excellent" was the comment. So flavorful and moist!! I only had a 3 pound boneless breast and was worried about it sitting in the bottom of that big crock pot, so I threw a few carrot and celery pieces on the bottom and added a half cup wine. I'm really not sure it was necessary but it made me feel better!! Lol! The only thing I would do differently is put 2 boneless breasts in. I had plans to make turkey pot pie and turkey salad and there isn't enough left! Thank you I will definitely make this again!

I put a couple of cut up carrots, a couple of potatoes a stalk of celery on the bottom of the slow cooker. when it was done I took the turkey out and put it under the broiler for 4/5 minutes to crisp the skin. To make gravy, I take the liquid and defat it, put it in a small casserole, add the cut  potatoes, carrots and the celery, bring it to a gentle boil and then I use the immersion stick blender and puree it.    do not have to use thickener at all.
after you use if any left over can be frozen

5 stars just for the idea of cooking it in a slow cooker. I never cooked a turkey before and made a 3 lb breast for just my boyfriend and I. Cooked it for about 6 hrs on low and it came out great. I don't know if I would use the onion soup though. I just put a little bit of turkey broth on the bottom of the crock pot and sprinkled the breast with saltnpepper garlic and basil and it was wonderful.

I give this recipe 3 stars and won't make again, but I will use the technique. I used a 3.5 pound half turkey breast & just didn't care for the onion soup with it. I'd use regular poultry seasoning next time. It also came out a little dry probably b/c I left it on Warm too long.

Made it as-is.  Pretty bland.  But then I'm used to more flavorful turkey grilled on the Weber (charcoal)...may be good for those brought up on oven-roasted turkey...

I had zero intentions of using a bone-in turkey breast and read through enough reviews to know that I could use a boneless breast. However, no one adjusted for cooking time with a smaller breast in the comment/original recipe and mine came out almost dry (I didn't think anything like this could come out dry with so much liquid simmering in a pot all day...but it can! I think at come point it starts to dehydrate). I will adjust for next time. I don't cook meat that often, so it kinda skipped my mind to check it earlier than indicated....figured it just weighed less because there was no bone (mine was almost 4 lbs. and the recipe called for a 6 lb. bone-in). The seasoning was super easy, and smelled just "okay" in my opinion. Didn't smell like turkey cooking...so if you want that added bonus (I remember my grandmother's house smelling like that at Thanksgiving and Christmas!), you won't find it here. But 5 stars, anyway, because I realize most of my issue is that I'm a vegetarian who tried to cook a turkey breast for the holiday...and 5 stars for finding out this can be done in a crock pot! So easy and relatively painless for a vegetarian cooking meat! I would love an alternate way to season it so it smells more like a holiday meal or traditional turkey baking smell.

This turkey breast was awesome! I would suggest adding a few spices of your own, the taste of the onion soup mix is fairly strong. All of my family really enjoyed this, wonderful!

I served this turkey breast on Thanksgiving day, it was the greatest and easiest receipe I have ever done. Every one loved it. My turkey breast was 7lbs. I used only 1/2 of the onion soup with turkey gravy.  I used the left over juices to make a turkey vegetable soup.

Since we were invited to friends’ for Thanksgiving, I made this turkey breast so we could have “leftovers” for turkey sandwiches here at home.  This is a great way to cook a turkey breast!  I think my slow cooker may run a little hot, so I would cut back on the cooking time just a little next time.  And I think I will skip the onion soup mix and use other seasonings.  This recipe gets 5 stars from me for ease and simplicity!  11/27/14 UPDATE:  Made this again using a 6/34 lb. bone-in turkey breast.  In my 6-quart slow cooker, it too exactly 5 hours.  This time I used a garlic and herb soup mix and added one can of chicken broth.

Five stars for the technique, but the french onion flavoring just didn't cut it.  I made it per instructions, and had to doctor the turkey before actually serving it on Thanksgiving.  It was definitely juicy and easy to cut, and as others have stated, there was plenty of broth for gravy and stuffing.  I will definitely be using this technique again, but with my own seasoning choices this time.

WOW.  That's all I could say with the 1st bite.  This came out so moist and juicy and fall off the bone good, I will definitely use this recipe again!!  I did put a little unsalted chicken stock in the bottom for a bit more moisture, but again, WOW.  Never have I had turkey this moist and tender.

This is the best turkey I have ever made!  I added some chicken broth and carrots on the bottom.  The turkey practically fell apart while I was taking it out of the crock pot it was so tender.

Made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and I was extremely pleased with the results!  I have a tendency to overcook my turkeys leaving them dry and needing to be bathed in gravy ... but not this time.  My kids and hubby all commented on how juicy and tender the meat was along with comments on the amazing flavor.  Like some other reviews, I added a few celery stalks, chopped onion, pats of butter and 1/4 cup of chicken broth to the pot.  I'm making this again for a Christmas party in a few weeks.  It doesn't get any easier than this!

Disappointing!!! I thought for sure that this would come out falling apart and possibly the MOST juicy turkey I had ever had... so I made it for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner with my brother's family, and it was dry if you can believe it! And the flavor was just OK. So disappointed!

I made the recipe exactly at was posted here, and it is five stars on all accounts.  Simple and delicious, nutritious and inexpensive.  Don't forget to buy the dry onion soup without monosodium glutamate (MSG).

We tried this for Thanksgiving this year and it was moist and delicious!  We layered in celery and green onions for extra flavor and it paid off!  We used (boneless) turkey breasts and left it on the high setting for about a half hour longer than the recipe calls for.

Easy as can be and perfect every time. The cranberry recipe on this site simply adds jellied cranberry sauce to this recipe and is better. IMHO.

Excellent! My picky family has been begging for this on a weekly basis, and it is so easy and delish that I am more than willing to oblige. I have cooked it as original recipe stated and also added white cooking wine. Both ways equally good. Thanks for this wonderfully easy turkey recipe!

I just made this last night and this is a really good recipe.  I also made this on thanksgiving along with roasting a turkey in the oven and I actually like the slow cooking concept better.  The only changes that I made was to add onions at the bottom and greased the pot with butter.

Simply amazing!  Couldn't be easier or tastier.  I was worried the onion soup would be overpowering...but it wasn't at all....just the most moist delicious turkey ever! Great to leave the oven free for sides.  Rave reviews from my 10 dinner guests.  Thank you for sharing!!!

I was leery of this recipe since I am not a fan of dry onion soup.  I thought the onion soup would over power the turkey but it doesn't.  I used a 3 lb boneless turkey breast and it was moist and absolutely delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly, just rubbed the inside of the crock pot with a little bit of butter. It turned out perfectly! Fell off the bone -- barely needed a knife! I will make this again for sure!

This recipe is just oh so good!  I've never made a turkey before but I love the bird :D I usually have to wait for Christmas or Thanksgiving to get my fix.  What a great find - now I can have it whenever the mood strikes.  The only thing is - I didn't add the dry soup mix (didn't have any)  I did put some celery and onion on the bottom of the crock pot and some butter on the bird with some poultry seasoning and sage right on top.  Didn't seem to affect the meat but boy was that gravy good :)

Wow! Who knew you could put a turkey in the crock pot?  I made the recipe exactly as stated but I added a couple of tablespoons of butter that I rubbed all over the turkey as other reviewers suggested and it came out wonderful. I will experiment in the future with different seasonings.

I make this all the time and it never fails to come out beautifully.  Would have never thought of this myself, but it's brilliantly simply.  I do use half a stick of butter or so and cut into pats that I tuck in and around the turkey breast.  I also just use whatever spices I feel like on that given day.  There really is no messing this one up--it's FABULOUS!

What a great idea! I have made this several times, it always turns out great. I have added garlic and italian spices (oregano, basil, or whatever I've got on hand) and its good like that too. I always add potatoes, they are SO good! For Thanksgiving last year, I made one turkey in the oven, and threw a smaller one in the crockpot with this recipe and that was my backup turkey in case I needed more (which I did!) Great recipe, can't believe how SIMPLE it is!

simple, tender and moist. Best combinations you can ask for. I tried this several ways and I must admit we liked it best without any of the "extra suggestions". Try it as is first, I doubt you'll regret it. Very flavorful. The thing I did do, rubbed some butter on the crock pot so there was no sticking.

I have never liked turkey, I thought it was too dry.  I tried cooking it this way & can't believe how tender, juicy & tasty it was.  I now cook one every week & use the meat for sandwiches.  I will never cook a turkey in the oven again.  Thank you for this recipe Ms Sally

This turkey was so moist and good, and I normally don't like white meat as much as dark.  I put a chopped yellow onion and some celery on the bottom, and rubbed olive oil on the turkey before putting on the soup mix.  A gravy packet came with my turkey breast, so I put that in there too.  I will definitely make this again.  You could certainly add some garlic and other vegetables or spices for even more flavor.

This was really, really good.  I made this in my electric roaster.  The pan drippings made a great gravy.  Even in the electric roaster, I had a nice, crispy crust because of the buttering I did.  Thanks so much!

Sooo flavorful!!  I cooked on low for 9 hours due to my Turkey was partially defrosted.  I added some chicken seasoning and also a few pads of butter to the crockpot and it feel off the bone!!  I was able to also slice the meat and it made a delicious meal.  Will definately make again.

Every now and then I try a recipe that everyone raves about, and it just doesn't turn out for me, and I wonder what I did wrong. This turkey cooked fine, got done earlier than expected, but looked terrible. It was all slimy, white-skinned & gross looking with very minimal browning towards the bottom of the cooker. I put it under the broiler on a lowered rack to try to brown it up so it wasn't so unappetizing.  That was hard to do, because the meat was falling off the bones and hard to transfer to a roasting pan. Now I have the slow cooker and a roasting pan to clean up. So if you don't have the couple hours it would take to roast a turkey breast in the oven, and you don't care what it looks like, I guess you would like this recipe, but I will stick to the conventional way of roasting in the oven.  How people got it to brown is a mystery to me.

this is a great option for turkey breast.   I used it after Chrismas for a small gathering. Used the veggies in the bottom and spayed the sides to help prevent sticking.  I'm sure the onion soup gives a nice flavor but it is VERY high in salt, so i will stick to a few basic spice powders without the salt.

I used two packs of soup mix since my turkey breast was almost 8 lbs (doubt it was needed, though) and it was delicious!  I hate to admit this, but I have NEVER even cooked a turkey or turkey breast before and was SO excited to see a recipe for the slow cooker.  I will be making this regularly...easy to freeze for sandwiches, salads, etc....no basting, no hot oven on for hours...what's not to love?

A great way to cook a turkey breast!  My husband said he didn't like turkey because he's eaten too many dried out, stringy turkeys.   But I made this and the meat was so moist and tender it was falling off the bone!  He enjoyed this and I shredded the leftovers for a hotdish.  The juices were not very flavorful even with the packet of onion mix so the gravy needed a lot of seasoning help.  I will make this again but will add some more spices to flavor it.

This was so handy!  Much easier than dealing with all that mess in the oven.  I used a 5.5 lb turkey breast and put some pats of butter under the skin, sprinkled with salt, pepper and some Montreal chicken seasoning.  I was worried about the lack of liquid to cook in, but it produced plenty of its own!    I thought the meat turned out just slightly dry, but my husband thought it was great - overall I think it was much better than most cooked turkey.

This was ok... but I didn't think it was any better than just oven roasted turkey breast. I thought the meat was actually less moist and juicy than oven roasted meat. However, it did make a large amount of awesome gravy, since more moisture collected in the slow cooker than it does in a roasting pan.

I  added chicken broth, as other reviewers have suggested, and added too much (probably 2 cups). The breast was done much earlier than expected, and OVERDONE (my fault). Still made great "falling apart" meat, but too done to slice. Will follow recipe next time!

This recipe was great for my small family, with enough leftover for a couple of days but not too much. a Super timesaver for busy moms or even dads. The meat was moist and it can be sliced or shread. A little to salty for my taste, so I will be using a rub of butter salt and garlic next time. Hint: my turkey breast did not take 8 hours to cook, more like six or five and a half. so please do check your turkey if you do not like it overdone. If you can not slice it maybe you overcooked it. But it is still great shreaded. Thanks for the recipe. ;>

I made this for Thanksgiving this year, with a few modifications.  I added celery, onion, carrot, garlic, and apple to the bottom of the crockpot, as well as about an inch of chicken stock.  I also rubbed the inside walls of the crockpot with softened butter.  Before adding the turkey, I rubbed inside and the outside of the skin with dry onion soup mix, as well as salt, pepper, garlic powder, and some dried herbs.  Then I browned the turkey in a fry pan for a few minutes, to get the skin golden brown.  Cooked in the slow cooker for 1hr high and about 5 or 6 hours low and it was literally falling apart.  I had to take a pair of tongs to get the meat out, since the bones and skin were just falling apart.  It was good -- very moist and tender -- although next time I think I will skip the onion soup mix.  It added a flavor that I thought was a little strange for turkey.  Also, I made gravy by straining a cup and a half or so of the juice into a small saucepan and adding a couple tablespoons of flour and milk.  Heat over medium heat on the stove to thicken it.  The gravy was DELICIOUS and tasted fantastic over the turkey, mashed potatoes, and stuffing that I made.  I will definitely try this again, and just tweak the seasoning I use.

This is amazing! So easy, yet turned out to be the best turkey I've ever made.  I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday and my entire family raved about the turkey.  I will be making this again.

I cooked a turkey breast without the bone this way and it was yummy. It was done after 6 hours on high. I just let it cook in it's own juices.

This turkey was amazing.  It didn't shred like I thought it was.  It actually sliced :)  I was tempted to add liquid but I didn't and there was plenty of liquid to use for gravy.  The taste was amzing.  I cooked for the 1st hour on high then I stoke the meat probe to my crockpot in the meat and set it to 180 degrees once it hit that point, I took the probe out and remained cooking it on hgh for about another hour :)

I made this recipe and followed the directions very carefully.  This turkey was dry and shredded instead of sliced.  I would not recommend this recipe.

This was very very easy and did come out delicious and moist.  The only change I made was add a little poultry seasoning and some chicken broth.  Was done in only 3 hrs on high.  Will make this again for sure!

I love love love this recipe!  super easy, tastes great just as it is!  I even made it for a pot luck party at work, simply because everyone doubted me when I told them that it was a TWO ingredient recipe!  "But you've got to add XYZ!"  Needless to say, they're all believers now.  Thanks for this staple in my diet!

This was an easy & foolproof way to get delicious turkey.  You can get a turkey breast with a pop up indicator to know just when it's ready.

This was very simple and had a great flavor and put out a wonder aroma - my mouth was watering as soon as I got home from work. I made it as directed and it came a little dry, next time I will add some broth or wine.

I was skeptical about the onion soup mix, but I wouldn't change a THING about this recipe!  It's incredibly easy, tasty, tender and did I mention it was EASY!!??  I'm making this for a 2nd time today.  I take advantage of buying turkey breasts any time they are marked down at the grocery.

I added some pats of butter(unsalted) to the bottom of the crockpot before adding my 3 lb turkey breast.  Came out very salty.  If I make this again, I will reduce the amount of dry onion soup mix or use a different brand.  Kids loved it though!

I thought this was rather bland and although I cooked it for the amount of time stated, it was overcooked and a little bit dry.  I used a 7 lb breast.  I'll have to use it in recipes like turkey pie so it'll be in some gravy.  Sorry...won't make again.  back to the oven for me!

This recipe is awesome!!!  Did put a splash of wine & sliced onions as other reviewers recommended.  My hubby hates slow cooker meals, complained all day!  When he tasted it, he had nothing but great things to say.  He even wants me to make this for our Thanksgiving dinner.

I will be making this again! We did layer some onions and celery bits on the bottom for some extra flavor. Also, freshly minced garlic is a must for this family. This is a very easy recipe and I look forward to some turkey sandwiches tomorrow!

I used a 6.5 pound bone-in breast, sprayed the crock with non-stick spray, rubbed the onion soup on and under the skin and added a couple of pats of butter on the breast. Cooked per the instructions and thankfully checked at 7 hours as another reviewer suggested.  My breast was already overdone. Although the meat fell off the bones, I did not care for the flavor of the meat (and we like onions/dry mix I used) nor the texture. My partner and our teenage son liked it though. If you're looking for a traditional turkey taste/texture, this recipe isn't for you.  For me, it was a waste of a turkey breast.

The frozen bone-in breast was too big for my little cooker, so I opted for the 3# frozen boneless breast (butterball).  I added 1 Tblsp butter to the bottom of the pot, the breast (string still on), and dumped on the dry soup mix.  Cooked on high until temperature of bird registered 170.  It came out super moist.  I was surprised at the amount of fat.  Flavor wise, it needed a kick.  Maybe I'm just use to the gobs of gravy I use to eat (not anymore).  I think I'll try this one again, bigger crock pot and the bone-in bird, and follow suggstions by other cooks. I'm happy to have the turkey for future meals.  Will be freezing pre-meausred portions.  Love the simplicity of the crockpot.

I followed this recipe as written.  I only had a 3 pound turkey breast though.  It was perfect.  So yummy, my family loved it.  My sister and I have both decided there's really no need to do turkey dinner any other way if you're just trying to feed a smaller crowd.  I invited her and her family over for dinner; but was worried we wouldn't have enough turkey, so she slow cooked a 3 pound breast also.  We fed 10 and had leftovers for sandwiches.  PERFECT and really a no fail recipe!!!  My kind of cooking:)

Well, the flavor was good but it ended up overcooked.  :(  I knew the turkey would be in longer than the specified recipe time, but my turkey was 7 pounds and I left it on the low setting only.  I hoped that it would balance.  No.  If you work an 8 hour day like I do, this is probably not a good recipe to try on a work day.  Mine was probably in about 9 hours on low.  Oh well.  It will be fine for turkey salad.

The kids ranted about this, particularly its potential in turkey sandwiches later.  I thought it was a bit salty, but still very good.  Next time, I will simply use a little less onion soup mix.  Very tasty and easy.

I added half a can of chicken broth. Turkey was moist, flavorful, and delicious! So easy and a great way to get a homecooked meal on a hot day! I'll definitely be making this again.

Fantastic!!!! I am not a big fan of turkey and usually avoid it even at the holidays. I got a free breast for Easter and thought I'd try this recipe. This is the BEST turkey I've ever eaten. I will definitely make this again!!! Can't say enough.

The turkey came out perfect. It was so moist and delicious. I cooked it on low and it was ready to be served by 6 hours. My husband and 4 year old daughter loved it and said it was a keeper. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband likes dark meat not white meat of the turkery.  I heard complaints from him when he asked what was for dinner. HE LOVED IT!!! The turkey was so good and moist. I couldn't wait for dinner, because it smelled so good.

I was skeptical, but I needed a slow cooker recipe for a busy day. I followed the recipe.  It came out awesome. I wound up cooking it longer, and it was not dried out.  I did not add any liquid and it created quite a bit. The onion soup did not taste overpowering(although it smelled overpowering), or artificial. The onion soup mix made the skin look brown, giving the illusion of a roasted turkey. Looking forward to sandwiches today!

What a great way to cook a turkey!  I would never think to cook turkey for a regular weeknight meal, but this makes it so easy!  I followed the recipe as listed.  Mine didn't turn out quite as moist as I was hoping, but when I reheat for my husband later on, I am going to bake it with some of the leftover liquid in the pan.  I've already separated leftovers for turkey tetrazinni and turkey fried rice.  Three meals - one turkey!

Great recipe, tried it but did it a little different. I used turkey thighs as well as a breast since there are dark meat lovers here. I also added 4 cups of chicken broth and a tsp of poultry seasoning. I also cut up celery and had baby carrots in the bottom with the turkey resting on top. The breast was good and the dark meat was super juicy. This was a "keeper" according to my family. Thx for an easy and tasty meal!!

I cooked a 6 pound turkey breast this way, with the addition of two tablespoons of butter that I placed in the cavity of the turkey breast. I did not add any water or other liquid.  I also sprayed the inside of the slow cooker with Pam for easy cleanup. It turned out absolutely delicious! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

My family and friends love this recipe!! It is so good and easy to make. I made it for Thanksgiving last year in order to simply my life and received rave reviews from everyone. I have added other veggies to the crock pot on occasion just to vary the recipe a bit. It's been such a hit I have requests to make it for every gathering we get invited to.

So easy and good; especially if you are only cooking for 2! I've used this recipe the last 2 years for Thanksgiving and will continue too.

Super easy, delicious and economical.  I followed the recipe exactly; I was a bit concerned that it would not make enough juice to make gravy but it made plenty.  I too will never buy turkey lunch meat again - this is better!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Tender, tender, tender!  I added oregano and thyme as another suggested. I also added celery and onions to the bottom of the pot but it wasn't needed. I am not a good cook (my hubby has done the cooking for 25 years) but this one boosted my confidence!  My family raved that it was wonderful!! It was so tender that during clean up my hubby was able to reach in and pull out the wishbone! He said he has never had turkey so tender. Thanks for a wonderful Christmas Eve recipe!

The best turkey we have ever had!  I used onion mushroom soup mix, plus added a little sage, thyme, salt, and pepper to the skin and in the cavity.  We made it on a random Sunday and it was so good, we plan to make it for Christmas day dinner!

My first turkey and I plan to always do it this way.  Sitting the turkey on a bed of baby carrots, cut up celery and onion and a huge, cut up clove of garlic, I threw in several splashes of dry white wine and only used between 1/2-2/3 of the onion soup mix.  I went away for the day and it cooked on low for roughly 7 hours and warmed for about 3 more and it sliced beautifully, was so juicy and tender and the flavor was fabulous.

I was kinda scared to try something new, after all, it's Thanksgiving Day. But I made this just like the recipe said, and it was PERFECT.
I received so many compliments. For now now on, this is a family tradition, and so easy...I had time do so many other things.

I had a 4 lbs bone-in breast and it came out on the dry side... overcooked.  I should have relied on my meat thermometer instead of the clock to tell me when it was done.  I'm going to try this again, but will check on it earlier next time.

What an easy way to fix a turkey breast. I did modify slightly by adding about 1/4 chicken stock to pot before I put the turkey in. Turned out great!

I made this recipe yesterday and it couldn't be more simple.  The only thing I did differently was to add about 1 cup of water at the start.  Also if you want to slice the turkey, you may want to take it out sooner as mine fell right off the bone.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!!! I was skeptical when I first saw the recipe, but decided to give it a try.  I watched my 6 and a half pound turkey breast like it was a baby, just waiting for something to go wrong:  the first telltale sign that it might be burning, that it was drying out etc.  But, absolutely nothing went wrong! I rubbed both sides of the skin with butter before patting on the soup mix. And like a few other reviewers I got a little nervous about the lack of liquid, so I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  It wasn't really necessary though, as the turkey was juicy and did not fall apart.

I had mad similar meals with turkey breast using the packet of frozen gravy mix that comes with the breast and removing all the skin. But liked this too, was initially afraid there would not be enough moisture to dilute the soup mix but it turned out great-and then still had the gravy packet to actually make gravy to go with the meat and added mashed potatoes to round out the meal

Incredibly moist!  I think this is a good starting point for someone who has never cooked a turkey.  This was my first attempt at one, and I'm very happy with how it turned out.  I also rubbed a few tbsps of butter, thyme and oregano onto the bird.  It was 6.5 lbs., and I kept it on high for the first two hrs. just to be safe, and turned it to low for the remaining time.  Will be making again...and not just for Thanksgiving!

Really good!! I am beginning to love my slow cooker. The meat was tender and juicy, the recipe was fast and easy. I did add butter but that was my only change. I served it with stuffing and a veggie blend. Yum!

I've made this recipe many times and there's no need add anything. The turkey turns out moist but gives off enough liquid to make a wonderful gravy. Please try it the way it's written before you change anything.

I followed the recipe exactly, and my turkey turned out very dry.  Perhaps my crock pot cooks hotter than most, because I can't understand why so many others could have had good results when mine was so dry.

I did this using a whole oven roaster.  DELICIOUS!  And I made chicken/corn/rivel soup with the leftover chicken (got 3 meals of that). This was so good I sent it  on to some working friends.  Thanks.  Maureen

This was awesome turkey! I never knew it could be so easy to do a delicious turkey. I added a little "Mrs. Dash" type of seasoning (no salt, no msg). I'm going to cook turkey more often!

I used garlic and herb soup mix rather than the onion. Turned out wonderful. Also leaves the oven free for pies, sides, etc. A keeper fore sure.

Yummy, tender and moist.  From reading the reviews, it seems like how long it takes depends on how big and/or if your turkey has bones.  I added a splash of broth to the bottom of my crock pot but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  Who needs gravy, we just spooned some of the broth/"turkey juice" over the meat before serving.

I made this on Christmas Eve and everyone talked about how great and juicy the turkey was.  They were shocked when I told them how it's cooked.  I also added pads of butter to the bottom, 1 yellow onion cut in half, and rubbed the turkey breast with garlic powder, marjoram, and parsley as well as the onion soup mix.  It smelled great as it cooked.  I didn't make any gravy but just served the drippings on top of the sliced meat - will definetely make again!!!

I usually cook the turkey in the oven, but this seemed like something to try. Sliced carrots and celery, some pats of butter, and, because I just couldn't bring myself to cook the turkey dry, 1/2 cup water went into the slow cooker. The onion soup went both on the turkey and in the water. One hour on high and three hours on low (for a three-pound breast) produced a moist, delicious turkey breast with meat that just slid off the bone and will make great leftovers. Definitely a keeper!

Can I just say, "Thank you!"?  I have been looking for a good but easy Sunday meal.  We are at church all morning and into the afternoon.  By the time we are done we have three grumpy, sleepy, half starved (or so they think) little kids.  I needed something I could have on the table with in 15 minutes of getting home.  This worked perfectly!
I did put the butter in the bottom and I did cook it on high all morning.  I also threw it under the boiler while I used the drippings to make gravy.  I served it with boxed stuffing, canned green beans, and reheated sweet potato casserole.  Fantastic!

I kind of hate to review this because I worked more from the reviews than the recipe.  I smeared the inside of the crockpot with butter and added a little bit of water (maybe 1/4 cup max) and just let it cook.  Did not use the onion soup mix.  It turned out great - juicy and perfect for sandwiches and lunches.  If I'm planning on having it for dinner, I put vegetables in the bottom as others have suggested.

Just got done enjoying the wonderful turkey! It is so good.  They whole family raved.  I only had a 3 pound bone-in half breast, but it fit well in the slow cooker and at the beginning I only added one tablespoon of butter and a little water and voila!!  I can't wait to share this recipe with family.

Fast and simple recipe!  This made enough turkey for me to make 2 more dishes with the leftovers - one for lunch and one for dinner the next day.  My turkey breast was done 3 hours before I expected, so I turned the slow cooker to "warm" until dinnertime.  It turned out great!

As a busy mom of two toddlers, I look for recipes that are quick and easy.  I also love anything that cooks in my slow cooker.  Was very impressed with this recipe.  Read through the reviews and some said it was dry but my turkey came out very moist and had lots of juice to make gravy with.  I will not hesitate to make this again.

Realized we had a turkey breast in the freezer, that we never used at Christmas-time, so thawed that and put it in the slow-cooker this morning.  Like Cookin'mama, I added a bit of water just to cover the bottom of the crockpot.  And I too omitted some of the salty powder in the onion soup mix.  This turned out very tender and moist AND gave a TON of broth for gravy (my fave!  Had about 3.5 cups of broth)!  Served with peas and potatoes.  Thanks, Ms Sally!

Great, moist turkey breast!  We usually go for the dark meat because the breast can be so dry, but this was perfect for us! I used all the onions from the onion soup mix, but sifted out some of the salty powder.  As Breeze suggested, I surrounded the breast with onions, celery, and carrots and a tiny bit of water.  The broth made wonderful gravy.  As the recipe suggested, I cooked on high for one hour and then lowered the slow cooker to low.  My breast had a pop up timer that popped after four hours on low (I wouldn't have noticed but I actually heard the pop).  I debated whether or not to continue cooking according to the directions, but decided to trust the timer, and I'm glad I did!  Served with mashed cauliflower, roasted cherry tomatoes, and green beans, this was a hit!

This was wonderful.  I expect that some problems others may have had could be related to the different sizes of crockpots.

I checked it about 1 hour from done thinking it was hard and I would have to slice and add some liquid.  When I sliced it open however it was juicy and flavorful and people just raved.

Be sure to check your cook times - mine was a little overcooked and therefore, a little dry, but still delicious!  I gave 5 stars because I know that next time with a temp. adjustment, this will be absolutely perfect!  Even overcooked, it was excellent. 
Thank you for sharing!

I have used this recipe for years now, exactly as given and it has NEVER failed me.  I had a friend say she did it without the soup mix and it was still good.  Do be careful to choose a turkey breast that is not too big for your slow cooker.

Mine came out too dry. Flavorful, but dry. :-( I wish I'd read the reviews before trying this recipe. My family ate very little of it.

I’ve made this recipe several times. It’s quick and it’s easy; taste is just ok to me. I’d like to have one with more of a healthier taste to it, like maybe a sauce with cranberries or something in it. Hmm I may try that.

I made similar changes as LadaFun noted in her review. My breast was only three pounds and boneless so it only needed 3 1/2 to 4 hours on low in the slow cooker. I cut up a couple large carrots, a couple celery stalks, and an onion and placed them in the bottom of the pot. I added a 1/4 cup of chicken broth as well. After rubbing the onion soup packet on the breast, I also added a touch of oregano, sage, and thyme. The result was a super moist turkey breast that melted in our mouths. Thanks for the great feedback and solid base recipe!

I've done this many times.  I have to break the breast bone of the turkey to get it to fit in my oval crockpot.  I don't use onion soup mix, I add an onion, some celery and some carrot cut in chunks, some herbs and about a cup or so of dry vermouth which is my go-to wine of choice when cooking chicken.  When done I, I make gravy from the juices.  Some crockpots cook hotter than others so mine is done 5-6 hours.

Over cooked !  Use an instant read thermometer and cook till 165!  Use herbs and a bit of olive oil on the skin.  I add  a quarter cup unsalted chicken broth to bottom of crockpot.  Family favorite!  Garlic clove optional!

Made this exactly as the recipe stated and it was delicious--very moist.  It took the stress off entertaining  as it was one less item to deal with at the last minute.  Cooked for the allotted time, sliced and put  into a smaller crock pot to keep warm until all other items were ready to serve.  Have made it twice and will use this recipe again before the end of the year.

I needed extra meat for our Thanksgiving dinner and had bought a 5.5 pound breast, came upon this recipe the day before. I already had a half envelope of soup mix, so I used that. I didn't have as much time, so I cooked on high for 2 hours, then on low for about 3 and a half. It was very moist and tasty meat. I will definitely use this again.

I did add a 1/2 cup of chicken stock and I cut an onion into rings. The house smelled amazing and when the turkey was done it fell right off the bone! The meat was juicy and so tender you could cut it just by looking at it! The bones were clean, so no more spending a half hour picking the meat off. I will definitely do this again next year.

This recipe was so simple and easy to make! The only substitution was brushing the turkey with butter before rubbing the onion soup mix. I used a 5.25 lb turkey and cooked it for 5 1/2 hours which was a little too long. Next time I'll shorten the cooking time by about 45 minutes.

The turkey falls off the bone! My dad was worried when I didn't add any broth to it. Seriously, don't add any broth, you wont need it! Turkey was flavorful and juicy! Thanks for sharing!

I had no idea you can cook a turkey breast in a crockpot. This was delicious.  Came out moist and very flavorful. This is the only way I'll cook a turkey breast from now on. Mmmmmmm!

I was worried about how a turkey in crockpot would turn out, but due to busy work days, gave it a try and WOW. I used the 3lb frozen breast and let it thaw overnight in the fridge, put some celery and onion in the bottom as others suggested and put melted butter on turkey breast then the seasoning. It was juicy and perfectly seasoned, whole family loved it! Great recipe!

This recipe is a definite keeper. It is so simple! I did cut up celery, onions , red potatoes and added them to bottom of crockpot. I used the Lipton onion soup mix as directed. Terrific weeknight meal. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I had a 12 pound turkey, cut the wings and drumsticks off (vacuum sealed and froze for soup) and cooked the rest, turned out beautifully. Didn’t know turkey cooked so well in a slow cooker. Tender and moist.

We cooked a 3.75# breast and my family thought it was great. (I, on the other hand,thought it was a little on the dry side - even with adding sliced butter stickers under the skin.) BUT it was super easy and simple to make.

I always cook my turkey breast like this, except I add a few whole bay leaves to the pot while it cooks and remove them before serving.  I also buy a smaller turkey for Thanksgiving, and cook it in the roaster, while I put a turkey breast in the crock pot the night before and cook it on low over night, turn it to warm in the morning, and voila!  Remember,  as with any turkey-  let it rest with a moist paper towel or clean dish towel over it for 10-15 min before you carve it as well- it helps keep it moist.  A few other suggestions:  If your turkey breast is too large for the crock pot, and the lid won't fit snuggly don't worry- cover it with foil wrapped tightly around the crock pot , then put the lid on top of the foil- the turkey will cook down, and it will be OK- also DON'T OPEN THE LID TO THE CROCK POT!   each time you do, it takes 15 minutes of cooking time away from the crock pot!

made recipe to a T almost, chickened out and put some chicken stock that was in fridge in first, no butter on bird but some on sides of pot so seasonings wouldn't bake on, i saw this happening during first few minutes so had to be done, did breast up so seasonings had desired effect, also on the note of high crock pot temperatures, mine was made in 2014 and cooks on keep warm at approx 194 F so started on low for 1-1/2 hrs then keep warm for about 11 hours, internal temperature of the breast was 185 F upon completion, meat was still not dry like an overcooked oven bird, will try and keep cook time around 8 hours next time but this is a 5 star method of making delicious white Turkey meat!

I make this every couple of months, it is so good. I did a few modifications, one reviewer made. I layered the bottom of the crockpot with cut up celery stalks, one sweet onion and 1/4 cub chicken stock. Also rub some oregano, sage and thyme and minced garlic. Drizzle breast with tablespoon of butter. It always comes out sooooooooooo good.

I used a 2.8 pound bone in breast. I lined the bottom of the pan w/ carrots, onion and celery. I added about 1 cup of turkey broth.  I put a bit of ghee under the skin of the turkey. Because it was smaller I used med heat for about 4 hours 20 min and it came out amazingly tender and juicy!

It was ok. Put sliced onions, carrots, celery and garlic in bottom of crock pot. Put a cup of broth with that. 
I didn't really like the flavor very much.

I used " Kook's" Indian spice Rub instead of Onion soup. 3rd time I used both, the onion soup and the Indian Spice Rub mixed together.  4th and 5th times I used one inside Onion soup outside only and Indian Rub inside and under skin. I used a Bone-In Turkey Breast. It is best to use bone -In chicken / turkey when slow cooking in slow cookers ;  especially  Breast meat

This is really good. Couldn't find bone-in breast, but the bonless turkey worked just fine.  It came out very moist/ tender.   The recipe is super easy.  After cooking, I added a couple tablespoons of cornstarch to the juices to make a gravy. The leftovers were used for pot pie.

I made this turkey breast in our slow cooker for Thanksgiving of 2015 and it turned out wonderfully. For Christmas of 2016 the turkey breast I bought was a little too big for the crockpot, so I actually still rubbed the turkey breast with The Lipton onion soup and added a stick of butter to the rub, transferred it to my roasting pan and baked it covered for 4 1/2 hours on 325F. 7 pounds of turkey breast bliss!  This is an easy peasy lemon squeezey recipe that requires minimal effort which is great! I will make this again and again.

I used a boneless rolled 4 pound turkey breast and added about 1 cup of chicken broth to the bottom of the slow cooker. After cooking it on high for the 1 hour, I cooked it on low for  5 1/2 hours and it came out absolutely wonderful.  It was so flavorful and moist and juicy - it was perfect.  I would definitely make this again.

Made just as recipe called for.  Had half the size turkey breast, used half the amount of onion soup.  Had enough juice for a DELICIOUS gravy.  A keeper!

Easy cleanup. If you have baked on gunk  due to forgetting to add liquid during the roasting: Clean by filling the slowcooker with water and a teaspoon of dish soap to a little above the gunk line and turn it on high for a couple of hours. The gunk loosens and is much easier to get off.

We had an early Thanksgiving.  At age 78, I have only used a slow cooker a few times, so I was a bit skeptical.  However, the turkey was wonderful! I did lay celery stalks on the bottom.w/sliced onion, added some turkey broth, not necessary  , & some spices & of course the onion soup dry mix,Did on hi  one hr. & since mine was a bit smaller 5 hrs low.  While it rested, I used the juices in stuffing.  It will be made here a lot!!    Salcha

I admit I always go to Honeybaked but this year with 8 coming over decided to do a bone in turkey breast myself.  Cooked a 7 pound on high for almost 5 hours and it popped up that it was done.  I did use a garlic and herb injector I picked up and inserted in all through the inside of the turkey.  I used Pam spray, put 3 foil balls under the turkey so it wasn't sitting flat; put 1/2 c white wine and chicken brother in first.  Sprayed turkey with butter then rubbed with mixture of several dry spices mentioned by most.  Basted it every 30 minutes.  It made the house smell amazing, looks gorgeous and the taste "melt in your mouth".  I let it cool, sliced it, laid it flat on a baking sheet, covered it with half the juice (saving rest for dressing) covered with foil and will refrigerate until just before lunch.  Will sit out for 45 minutes then flash reheat for 10 minutes in 450 degree oven.  So excited and it's going to save me time tomorrow!!

I'm not being snarky, I just don't like the onion soup mix. However, I did find that adding a little onion salt, some thyme and sage (sage always plays nice with poultry), it was terrific. And oh, the liner was helpful. Guess what I'm going to do for Thanksgiving?!

I've been making this turkey for the past 4 years.  We are a small group and will all the sides it is enough for us.  We even have Thanksgiving and a 1/2 and I make it then too.  The only thing different that I do is spread some butter over the skin before I begin.  It comes out moist and delicious and makes enough drippings for gravy.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I didn't use the onion soup.  I just put it in my crockpot, FROZEN, the night before I wanted it, put it on high and let it cook.  If it doesn't fit quit right while still frozen but you know it will as it thaws, put foil over it with the top resting on it and as it thaws the lid will fit.  If you leave it on high in the morning it will be done for lunch, or turn it down to low and it will be done for dinner.  I put mine in just before I go to bed 'cause that way I am asleep before it starts making the house smell really good.

Good and tender but too salty. Will omit the onion dip seasoning next time. Will use again for those odd times during the year that I want turkey but don't want a whole T-Day feast.

I used a 3lb Butterball boneless turkey breast and added a bag of small potatoes. I also added a stick of butter. This came out really good. Thanks for the recipe:)

Family loved it and will use it in future. Only change was to add a root vegetable bed to crockpot. I had used a smaller turkey breast (less than 3 lbs) and using a thermometer to confirm I cooked 1 hour on high and about 31/2 on low. Was so tender and moist and family loved it. My Thanksgiving dinner consisted of 3 other recipes from this site along with some roasted potatoes which I did in my roaster oven out on the patio - Sweet Potato and Apple Casserole, Parsnips with Honey dish and Apple Crisp 11 - amazing dinner. Clean-up was easy too.

I lined the bottom of the crockpot with new potatoes, baby carrots and sliced onion that I had tossed in olive oil and Italian seasoning, S&P.  I poured about 1/2 cup water in bottom.  Covered the turkey in onion soup powder and placed on top of veggies.  This was great and I had a whole meal to serve!

I used a liner for my cooker. I thought it was pretty salty but still liked it. I put carrots and celery in the bottom of the pot to elevate the breast. It came out moist and very tender with a lot of flavor. I would make it again. I wish they would make a lower sodium onion soup mix. Maybe I should try the canned onion soup or some variation of the dry soup mix that wouldn't be as salty. I would make this again. I had an 8 lb. breast. It was cooked on high for around 4 hrs.

The most easiest and DELICIOUS Turkey I have ever eaten! I followed the recipe but also did as one other cook did, rubbed oregano, rosemary, garlic poweder, some salt.  Added 1/4 cup of chicken broth to the bottom of the crock pot,  with an onion and 3 celery chopped.  cooked on high for one hour and low for 7 hours.  JUICY and DELISH!!!  Meat falls right off the bone and is not string, like pulled chicken or pork! It's perfect! DO NOT HESITATE to make this way.  I have shared this recipe with all my friends!

This is so good! My son and son-in-law actually asked for the recipe. We are having It this year also. It is so tender and flavorful. I used herb lipton soup instead of the onion soup mix. Hmmm, I  may have reviewed this already. Well we love it so forgive me if you have heard this before!

I loved the cooking method and made this exactly how the recipe instructed. The turkey came out moist and delicious with plenty of juice for gravy. Next time i won't use onion soup though. I think i'll stick with the more traditional poultry seasoning. maybe soften some butter, add poultry season and rub that on instead of the onion soup. Recipe is a keeper.

I made this today for Thanksgiving dinner, and I have to say with having 3 kids, this was a great recipe for making life easier. The only thing I would change for next time is I would only use one packet of the onion soup mix. I used two, because the box came as a two pack and I put one packet inside the bird and all over the outside. The flavor was a bit overpowering, but my family still liked it. I think with just the one packet it would be perfect. This is also great for premaking meat for other recipes or even for sandwiches for the week. I highly recommend this for busy moms.

This worked out fabulously for Sunday dinner on a warm summer day.  Served with mashed potatoes, gravy and green beans, we enjoyed a turkey dinner in July.  The only thing I did different was add a layer of sliced onions to the bottom of the slow cooker before adding the turkey.  Great recipe. Thanks for posting.

The turkey fell apart if touched. However, I felt like the recipe was too salty. Maybe I'll just do turkey no seasoning next time and make gravy separate.

The only change I made was spread a can of low sodium cream of mushroom soup over the top of the turkey, then sprinkle the onion soup over this.  Everyone absolutely loved this.  You also have your gravy.

This was soooo easy.  If you messed this recipe up...you just can't cook.  Did this on Thanksgiving morning, the breast was ready by 2pm.  So delicious!  I'm doing this every year.  The only thing I did differently was add a little chicken broth 2 hours before it was done.  I had broth left over from another recipe and I didn't want to waste it...so I just added it.  Very good recipe!

Turkey was just as easy as the recipe said it would be.  I used Garlic and Herb Soup rather than Onion Soup mix. Rick added a bunch of onion, carrot, and celery chunks to the bottom of the crock pot before I put the turkey in. Also added some water and a splash of white wine. The flavor of the bird and the gravy I made from all the juices was very nice. Seven hours on LOW was WAY too much time as the meat got dry. Next time I want to put the breast in upside down and only cook for 4 hours on LOW.

I thought this was wonderful. I made homemade onion soup, a recipe also found here on Allrecipes.com since we are MSG sensitive, then I used the drippings from the roast a couple of days later and made a soup with the left over turkey.  Two wonderful meals!

I have been making turkey breast like this for years.  I use the gravy packet from the turkey along with a cup of chicken or turkey broth so the meat has enough moisture.  I use black pepper for spice as the gravy has enough salt.  White onions are a nice addition if you have them.  As with all slow cookers, the size of the breast and the cook time have to be adjusted.

It was a little bland needs more spices.  We set it to high for one hour and thenprobe to 170 and it only took 4.5 hours.  We left in on warm after thant and it dried out a little.

Amazing!  Cook it upside down like someone said (breast down) for maximum juicyness.  I hope this doesn't ruin my enjoyment of relatives probably roasted turkey every Thanksgiving from now on!

Made this today. Put it in the crock pot before work on low and came home to fall off the bone turkey. It smells wonderful and is juicy and moist. I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but this is a keeper!!

I loved this recipe!  I made this last year for Christmas and it was my first time making a turkey ever!  It turned out perfect!  It was juicy and flavorful!  I have no complaints! I will never bake a turkey as long as I have a crockpot!

This turns out perfect each and every time.  Husband and I have travelled for a couple of Thanksgivings and I always take the slow cooker so that we can stay in and have a meal with all the trimmings.  Don't wait for Thanksgiving.  This is so easy and soooooo good you can have turkey breast anytime!

I will never roast a turkey breast again. This is the no fuss no muss way to cook turkey. Plus I can do this all year round, even during the blazing summer months. I even let the turkey carcass simmer in its own juices, in the crock to make turkey stock.

OMG! This was AWESOME! We had this today for our Christmas dinner. It was so moist and delicious! I highly recommend doing a turkey breast with this method. Enjoy!

Can't get much easier than this.  Turkey was moist and tasted good.  Maybe I'd add some different spices next time.

This recipe was fantastic.  I used it for Christmas dinner and it turned out to be the juiciest  and tenderest white turkey meat I've ever eaten.  I'm not an experienced cook, but I put the breast of turkey breast side down in my crockpot.  I had rubbed onion soup mix over it as the recipe calls for and I put only a half cup of white wine and some fresh herbs in the bottom of the pot.  It couldn't have been easier and it turned out delicious, very flavorful and moist.  I will be making this recipe often from now on.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made it for the first time last weekend for a small gathering of 6 and had some left overs ... but not enough.  I cooked another one this weekend.  It's very good and simple.  Love it:)

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was incredible...can't believe how easy it was.  Put it in the slow cooker before I went to bed on Thanksgiving eve.  Waking up Thanksgiving morning with a moist, tender, and juicy turkey was a real blessing!  Will definitely do this again...

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was excellent. I did add onions and celery to bottom of c/p and some onion in cavity of bird. Put it breast down and it was very moist. Made plenty of juice with no water added. Only thing wrong is the looks of the breast when it is done, you couldn't put it on the table looking like it does.

This is one of the most moist & delicious turkey's I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  This turkey turned out wonderfully!   For those worried about no juice in the bottom of the crock pot to begin with - Don't.  Lots of juices as it cooks.  I did put a couple of pats of butter in the bottom just to help with sticking. I will use this recipe over and over again.  Absolutely the best!

We followed the advice of a reviewer and added some stock and veggies to the crock pot.  This turned out very tasty!  It was an easy and different way to prepare a nice healthy meat dish.  I only give it 4 instead of 5 stars because I heavily modified the recipe, and it's very, very salty.  Still delicious though!

This is a great recipe. I add 1 teaspoon of garlic powder to the soup mix!   I don't care for turkey, but this is wonderful!  I have passed this on to my kids and they love it!

What an exceptional recipe and easy way to have turkey all year round!  I added wedged onions and celery to the bottom of the crockpot, mixed the onion soup mix with 1/4 cup of soft butter and rubbed both under and over the skin.  I added no liquid and cooked as directed.  I took the leftovers along with all the juice and put it in the fridge overnight. It was even better over the next day or two!  I am definitely making this at Thanksgiving as 'back up' as I can now roast a smaller bird and have this in addition.   Thank you, Ms. Sally!

Ok, here the thing with this one. If you are dying to have turkey (or you need to cook some turkey for another recipe you'd like to make) and you don't want to go to all the trouble typically associated with making a turkey then use this recipe. My turkey turned out okay but it was kind of dry and not very flavorful.  However, if you want a "turkey" I recommend you skip this recipe and cook one the old fashioned way. Last Thanksgiving I used the "out of this world turkey brine" recipe from this website (because I'd heard so many wornderful things about brining).  It was the BEST turkey I ever ate, let alone made. Highly recommend brining.

Very tasty!  I was very surprised so little prep could be soooo good! :)  Never cooked a turkey in crockpot before!  I must add though I didn't cook as long as in the recipe, I feel as if I did it would have been too dry.  This was moist and very flavorful.  Will def. try again!

I will never bake a turkey in the oven again.  This was the most flavorful, moist turkey we have ever had.  I didn't even have to cut slices off, the whole breast meat portion just pulled off of the bone at once. Mmmmm.

This was simple and delicious, I followed the instructions exactly. I really was surpised I did not need to add any water. My only complaint was that it was a tad on the salty side, maybe a low sodium soup or a little less soup mix may help that.

This was awesome!  It was so good, that if we ever have a Thanksgiving with a small number of people, I"d rather make this than a whole bird. I did add one coarsely chopped onion and 3 stalks of celery chopped.  I love the idea that we can now have turkey year round with no fuss!

MMMMM! This turned out way better than any turkey breast I've cooked in the oven. I did place the turkey on a chopped onion and dot the top with some butter and a dash of poultry seasoning. The turkey was moist and flavorful even after cooking for 8 hours. I'd say this recipe is probably foolproof!

I never knew turkey could be like this.  I kept reading the reviews and couldn't believe how it could be true, but as soon as I put that first bite in my mouth, I was a believer.  White meat, to boot!  Used this i Thanksgiving sandwiches with cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo.  Awesome.

Very good!  I couldn't stop picking at the turkey as I was cleaning up after dinner.  I made the recipe exactly as directed.  I might put some carrots and celery on the bottom of the crockpot next time, but this recipe is great as is.

Awesome recipe. Great flavor and so easy. I served it with rice and the next night I made turkey quesadillas. I had to go to work so I put it in the crockpot on low for 8 hours and then it clicked down to warm setting for another hour. It wasn't as dry as I thought it might get. I think everyones crockpot cooks a little different. I look forward to making this again and cooking it for less time.

This was so easy, moist & excellent flavor!  I already had a boneless breast so used that.  It was 3 lbs. so reduced crock pot cooking time to 1 hr. on high and 4 hrs. on low.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is a keeper for sure!! I added a clove of garlic to the bottom, and 2 T of butter, one of which I did rub all over the inside of the crock pot. I seasoned the Turkey with a dry garlic and herb soup mix. It turned out GREAT!! it did fall apart as I was trying to get it of the crock itself, but that was expected. I was little concerned with there being no liquid, but I did not need anymore that what was produced by the turkey and the butter! Also made a great gravy!

I used a boneless turkey breast and was concerned that it would be dry. I added about 1/2 - 1 cup of water as well as onion and celery. I cut back the total cook time by at least an hour. It was delicious and moist.

This is a great recipe and a wonderful revelation that turkey can be done safely in a slow cooker.  I was nervous that it would not get thoroughly cooked, so I cooked it a little longer than the recipe says.  Mine was actually a little dry, but I assume full responsibility for that.  I will definitely make this again and again in the future for how easy and healthy it is.

The only reason I messed with this easy recipe, is because I have one person in the house who runs at the sight or smell of an onion!  So on one half of the breast, I used the onion soup mix, under the skin and out, but on the other half, I used KC Masterpiece dry seasoning.  Two      dishes in one!  Both sides turned out very well (how can you miss with such an easy recipe) but the side with the soup mix was twice as juicy.  Next time, he's just gonna have to run, because I'm using the soup mix all over!  Thanks for such an easy recipe. It's a 5 star keeper!

Well, I put this in the crockpot at 9:30 this morning.  It's 2:30pm now and the bird is cooked.  In fact, internal temp is 190 so I think it's been done for a while.  It looks and smells delicious.  I had to put it on warm, hope it's still good in 3 1/2 hours for dinner!  I added 1/2cup water at the beginning because I was doubting leaving it in there dry.  Totally unnecessary - don't do it!  There's practically turkey soup in there now from all the turkey juices.

I tried this with the celery and onion beneath as suggested by prior reviewers.  Put on before I went to bed New Year's Eve for a super dinner at noon on New Year's Day.  Moist and flavorful even though it cooked a long time.  Moved to a warm oven around 10 a.m.

You have to LOVE the onion soup flavor in order for this recipe to work. I didn't like it so much. I didn't have time to cook the turkey slowly, so I set it on high for about 5 hours. It was fine. A little dry, so I'm sure the slower cooking will keep it from drying out as much. I was shocked there wasn't any water or bouillon added. I will next time just to make it very juicy.

I made this tonight and was somewhat skeptical thinking it wouldn't brown up very well.  But surprisingly turned out pretty good and looked nice too.  My only complaint was that it was too dry, but I think that was my fault because I had a smaller turkey breast than the recipe.

I made this recipe on Christmas day. Wow! was that ever good. I don't think I will ever make a whole turkey again. I thought I would miss the dark meat but this was just as good or better. I loved not having all this work that you have with a whole turkey, no grease anywhere and nothing baked on. We already had it for three days now, today I made turkey tetrazzini with it and we still have half of it left, I know it will get eaten, it's only me and my husband. I won't wait for Christmas or even Thanksgiving to make it again.

This recipe was to die for!!!  I wanted turkey breast and had a workout class after work...no time to put together the turkey breast.  Then I dicovered this recipe.  Fantastic!  The turkey was moist and very flavorful and the gravy was great! I cooked it in the slow cooker for 8 hours and then had my work out class so I turned the cooker off.  When I came home, I turned the broiler on and browned the skin which completed the turkey breast!  Made some chutney to go with it ...yummy!

Very easy recipe!  I altered slightly to use the suggestions made by reviewers by tossing some chopped carrots, celery and onion and a smidge of butter and chicken stock.  This came out so tender and juicy!  Will be doing this again. :D

This was great!  Quick and easy!  Unfortunately I broke my own cardinal rule not to cook in the slowcooker while at home, and the aroma drove me nuts all day!  Now two days later and my house still smells divine!  My husband opened the pot to get the meat out to rest and then carve.  He picked up the meat and the bones fell into the pot!  Tender, moist and delicious!  Don't make the mistake I did and plan on jarred gravy!  I followed recipe completely and added no liquids, but still had half a pot full of fragrant juices to make gravy!  This will be a repeat as even my husband who hates onions liked it!

This is so easy and tastes great!   Meat was juicy.  I added some broth in the crockpot.  I also sliced butter and tucked it underneath the skin. My turkey wasn't quite thawed enough, I kept it on high for about 2 1/2 hours and then turned the heat down.  Total cooking time:  8 hours.

I am not a fan of turkey and I was skeptical only 2 ingredients? But this was very moist and flavorful. I did add about 3/4 cup of water giving me 2+ cups of gravy. Do not need the extra water. Will make again in the future

I made this yesterday (Thanksgiving) and it was an absolute hit.  Like some I added onion, garlic, celery and a bit of chicken stock.  It made plenty of gravy.  The house smelled festive without the hassle of a big turkey to baste.  Delicious and extremely juicy, tender meat...thanks for the recipe!  I won't make turkey any other way from now on.

I did it just a bit differently than the original recipe and it turned out great!  I used an 8lb fresh breast sprinkled generously with poultry seasoning and poured the turkey gravy that came with the turkey. Cooked on high in my slow cooker for 1 hour and on low for 5 more hours. I cut the extra skin off before putting it in the slow cooker and then before slicing I pulled the remaining skin off.  It was PERFECT!  Moist & tender, my picky son went back for seconds, so I'm counting that as a huge success!

I finally made a turkey everyone in my family loved!!! My picky 6 and 8 y.o. children raved about how good the meat and gravy was and even went for seconds!!! So simple to follow. The only thing I added was a can of mushroom soup that another reviewer suggested. Never again will I roast a turkey breast. Slow cooker all the way!

Very nice and juicy.  Made a 6 lb breast in about 6 hours, first 2 hours on hi, then on low for the last 4.  Very moist.  I liked the texture and flavor.  Some of the drippings went into the gravy and it made it very yummy.

We really enjoyed this.  I put a cup or two of chicken broth in the bottom of the crockpot to ensure it stayed moist.  I didn't have the onion soup mix so I just used some McCormicks Grillmates dry rub seasoning I had instead.  It was really tasty and moist.  The best part was the ease of just putting it in the crockpot and going to bed!

This is a very good recipe; however, the cooking time (at least for my crock pot) was way too long.  I had a 7 1/2 lb turkey breast, put it in at 6:45 am, took it out at 12:00 and it was overcooked. Next time I will rely on a meat thermometer to test for doneness.  I really don't think think you have to start it on high, just keep it on low.

Delicious and easy!  I've cooked this for Thanksgiving two years in a row, and as a beginning cook, it is so nice to be able to put the turkey in and focus on everything else with complete confidence that it will be totally delicious!  This year, I forgot to buy the turkey breast a few days in advance, so it was still partly frozen.  I followed instructions on About.com and ended up putting the mostly-frozen turkey in the slow cooker on high for TWO hours, not one, then cooked on low for 7-8 hours.  Turned out well.  Not sure if this is an FDA-recommended way to thaw a turkey, though, so weigh your options... and definitely buy early enough to thaw in the fridge!

I made this recipe as written, plus a little butter in the slow cooker as others had suggested.  The flavor was very good and it couldn't have been easier to fix, but it turned out very dry (I had to use gravy on mine, which I never do).  Next time I'll definitely add some chicken stock to keep it from drying out.

Perfect, Perfect, Perfect!!! My breast was 7.5 lbs and I had to snip the backbone a little so the lid would close. I also let it sit at room temp 20 min. before turning on the heat. No need for butter or oiling the top! Only dry soup mix I had was Savory Herb with Garlic.  The meat pulls away from the bone easily like a rotisserie chicken. Pour some of the broth over to store. Yum, Yum!!I'm eating a left over sandwich now, so moist and tender!!

The taste of this is good. The skin just doesn't look good, that's why I shredded it. I had a feeling that would happen, so we just topped are mashed potatoes with it. Tomorrow a sandwich or casserole. :)

This is even better than I had hoped: My kitchen smells like I cooked a Thanksgiving turkey! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and just rubbed on the onion soup mix to coat the turkey rather than using all of it. I also poured in enough water to cover the bottom of the pot, and cooked it for 4 hours. Tender, flavorful, and definitely a keeper.

Good to know that this is do-able in the slow cooker--it comes out unbelievably moist. However, the meat has little flavor. I wanted something more intense, less bland. Makes pretty good gravy.

Great! Foolproof for old and new cooks alike. I used one package onion soup mix for a 3 lb. roast, instead of 7 lb., so it was a little too salty. Next time I'll go for a larger turkey breast. My cooking time was about 2 hrs. on high and 2 hrs. on low, and it was just about right.

This recipes makes the most moist turkey breast you will ever eat. The only thing I did different was I omitted the soup mix and made my own spice mixture and rubbed it on the bird. Too good :)

SO easy and SO good!  My husband didn't believe that this would work or taste well.  But, according to the reviews, i was confident that we would have a delicious turkey and I was right!  I've used this recipe serveral times now and have added stuff here and there which is fine, but it's great with just the onion soup mix as well.  5 stars, for sure!!!

I added celery, onions, garlic and carrotts to the bottom as well as butter to the breats with the onion mix.  Mine needed to cook a lot longer, I think next time I will cook longer on high.  Aside from that it was moist and very tasty.

This was the first turkey I've ever made and it turned out great! So juicy! I put about 1/2 cup chicken broth in the bottom, rubbed on the onion soup mix, and added some salt, pepper, and garlic powder over the soup mix. Very good flavor!

My husband didn't want me to make this b/c he thought it would be too dry, but after reading some of the reviews, I decided to make it anyway. I made a 6lb. turkey breast and cooked for 1 hr. on high and 6 hrs. on low. It turned out moist and yummy. So easy!! I did add 1/2 water (probably didn't need to though) and put the gravy packet (included with the turkey) in and 3 Tbsp. flour after taking the turkey out. Will make my turkey like this from now on. Thanks for posting this.

This recipe is awesome. Who new something with just 2 ingredients could taste so great. My Dad cooked a turkey in the smoker and he fried one and I cooked this recipe for Thanksgiving. I must say everyone loved this one of the three.

Amazing!  I don't know why I hadn't tried this before!  I've never had luck cooking turkey, and this gave me delicious, VERY tender turkey.  I will definitely be doing this again!

I have never cooked a turkey breast in a slow cooker and boy I did not know what I was missing. The turkey was so moist and tender unlike any turkey i have had before. I took another reviewers suggestion and added celery and onions with a small amount of chicken broth in the bottom of the crock. I added some garlic powder, pepper and Mrs Dash along with the onion mix and it came out great. I will be making this again very soon. Thanks.

I made this just as written. I swear it could not get any easier than this.Because my family was ill on Thanksgiving we had to stay home instead of going to visit family.Not wanting my children to miss out entirely on Thanksgiving I made this and my children LOVED it and said it was the best turkey they ever had.It's a keeper!

While I love the idea of this, it just didn't turn out like I had hoped.  I didn't care for the flavor the soup mix gave it and I felt like the cooked turkey had a very strange texture.

This came out very dry. I guess I over cooked it. I will try it again with a much shorter cooking time and a bit of broth. I love the idea and alot of you did have good results so ... try, try again !

I made this for Turkey day this year was was completely surprised at how tender it was!! **I did rub the turkey down with a little olive oil before adding the onion mix.** This recipe has GREAT flavor and was falling off the bone! Wonderful!!

Excellent and easy!   Pop it in the crock pot in the morning and have a wonderful, tender turkey breast for dinner.  I did put a pad of butter in the bottom and that worked really well!

This was good, but I think I left the breast in too long a it wasn't as moist as I expected after all the reviews.  (I even added some apple juice and some butter in the beginning, too.)  I also found it a little bland -- should have used more spices.  But I definitely liked freeing up the over for other things!  I would make this again, but would spice it much more and probably watch it closer to make sure it didn't overcook.

We added only the butter pats to the original recipe.  We ended up cooking our 5 pound breast 7 hours on high, when the meat thermometer showed 170 per the instructions on the breast, then went back to low.  For all that, the meat came out well, good texture and came off the bone easily.  I wonder if the fact that our crock pot is the larger removable crock variety made the longer time & higher temperature necessary.  Or maybe we only thought it was necessary; crock pots have a large margin of error sometimes.

One outright positive was the ease of making a good gravy from the generous amount of drippings.  I used 1.25 cups of the liquid, 2T flour, and about 2T of milk, heating them in a large frying pan.

A life-saver for a large Thanksgiving crowd!  With 25 guests, this was so easy to do a day ahead then re-warm and mix in with the 22 lb. turkey.  So easy, fast, low-fat (no butter!), and tasty.  Be sure to double check the size of your turkey breast.  Mine finished cooking in ~4 hours, not the 8 hrs listed.  Definitely will make again.

This recipe scores high for being easy to make and the turkey was okay. But do NOT expect roasted turkey flavor in the "gravy." It's broth, pure and simple. My family loves homemade turkey gravy, brown and flavorful. So if you want great gravy, ditch the crockpot and grab your roaster.

This was good, though a bit dry, which may be my fault.  I followed other reviewer's advice and I added a tablespoon of minced garlic, a tablespoon of butter, a little pepper, some carrots, and celery.  Also, I rubbed the turkey with olive oil before the onion soup.

This was wonderful. I cooked on high for about 5 hours. Very moist indeed!
I also made gravy with the left over juice from the turkey and the onion soup.

this was really easy.  I layered the bottom with some celery and carrot too - though my carrot got overdone.  I added a can of vegetable stock prior to adding the turkey.  I accidentally left the slow cooker on high for three hours, then turned it down to low for another hour (my bone-in breast was six pounds).  My turkey FELL off the bone and was still moist.  I shredded it and added a steamed "freshlike" bag of vegetables right before serving to make a soup.  Add some fresh ground pepper and you're good to go!  I served with grilled flatbread.

This turkey was great, so juicy and tender.  I followed the suggestions of one of the other reviewers and added onions and celery and made a rub for the turkey out of garlic, sage, thyme, etc.  I also added a little chicken broth and drizzled 1Tsp of butter on top.  Turned out perfect.

I don't know what I did wrong but my turkey was just bland with lots of juice in the bottom of the pot.  It was also tough but I assume it was my turkey and not the recipe.  I will try it again and rerate it if it turns out better next time.

this recipe is definitly a keeper however, I cooked a 7 lb turkey breast today and it was done in 4 hrs so be very careful with the timing i  did exactly what the recipe stated I did not modify it at all.  It was delicious, but I can't believe you would cook this 8 hrs.

Followed directions to the T but mine came out so dry. I'm guessing cooking times may need to be adjusted or I would skip the 1st step of cooking on high for the first hour. Oh well, win some-lose some.

This is a great recipe!  I did cut up half an onion and some celery and put that on the bottom with a little butter and just a splash of water.  I also put a little butter on the turkey before I rubbed on the onion soup mix.  I used a breast that was just under 7 lbs and cooked it on low for 7.5 hours and then it was on warm until I came home a couple hours later.  It didn't need all that time but I was at work so it got that full time.  It was still moist and flavorful and the drippings made the best gravy I have ever had.  I put a few cups on the stove and added a little flour/water mixture to thicken it up.  I was thrilled with the results. 
An excellent way to have a full turkey dinner midway through the week!

I gave this 3 stars becasue the recipe was very easy. However, I did not care for the onion soup flavor on turkey. I like this much better on beef. It was not bad, but I don't think I would try again on turkey.

Iloved this. You can adjust the recipe for as many as your crockpot can hold. Or just a couple. I added some sage. Also at the very end of cooking I removed the turkey breast added a box of Stove top, it wasn't as good as thanksgiving but wasn't that hard either

Juicy and delicious...started with bed of veggies & chicken broth and topped with boneless breast rubbed with Italian seasoning packet (instead of onion), sage, thyme & a bit of oregano.  

Fantastic!

Very good.  My hubby commented to bad you cannot cook a whole turkey in a crockpot.  (well I guess you could if you had a huge crock)

Made this for Thanksgiving, not as moist as  some said theirs was but very tasty. Next time I may add a little broth. Great way to make some turkey for two or three people.

I am a vegetarian, but I volunteered to host Thanksgiving this year and promised to make a turkey for the other guests.  I wanted something that wasn't too invasive and would require as little work with the turkey itself as possible.  This recipe was BY FAR the best that I found.  I put a few pads of butter in my crockpot as recommended and rubbed the turkey breast down with a Lipton onion soup pack, then slipped it into my crockpot.  I put it in late last night, let it cook on high for an hour, then set it on low and slept while it cooked the rest of the way through.  I woke up to the most wonderful aroma, and while I made the rest of my dinner (using my oven as often/much as I wanted!) I set the turkey on "Warm".  I didn't have any of the turkey, but I got nothing but rave reviews; guests couldn't believe how tender and juicy it was.  This recipe deserves an A+ for simplicity and taste!  Thank you for it!

Well, I followed the recipe.  I used the pkg of onion soup mix and put it in a oven bag and shook the turkey breast around.  It was alot neater.  I cooked a 4lb bone in turkey breast.  I used about 4 pats of butter in the bottom of the crock like others did and cooked it for 1 hr high and 3 hrs low.  It was dry.  I was going to cook it 6 hrs instead of 8hrs but pulled it at 4 hrs and wished I pulled it earlier.  Wasn't home.  I will try it again, but I think I will add marsala wine to it and just watch the cooking time.

I used tenderloins.  Went ahead and cooked on high for an hour and low for 5.  It was a bit dry, even adding chicken broth to begin with.  Will try again with the bone in breasts.

This was yummy!  I added some veggies and broth and made a gravy out of the juice. The kids and hubbby loved it :)  A little too salty for me...I will try to find a reduced sodium onion soup mix next time.

I used a "Turkey Breast for London Broil", threw in some onion mushroom soup mix and some low sodium chicken broth.  Cooked it on low for 10 hours and it turned out really dry, but I won't fault the recipe for that since I didn't use a full turkey breast...I'll just need to adjust the cooking time in the future.  However, the 'london broil' shredded really well so shredded the whole thing, put the shredded turkey in a tupperware and poured the leftover juices on top of it. Although it's still a little dry for my liking, it tastes great. Would be great with mashed potatos. This recipe is a great starter, easily adjustable to suit your taste. Thanks!

The turkey was dry.  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the drippings in the slow cooker and it made a very nice gravy.  The turkey itself was very dry.  If I try again I will cook for considerable less  time.

New to slow cooker using - haven't found many recipes that do it for me.  I was very skeptical about this one. 
It's a hit.  It really was done in 8 hours, the onion soup gave it a "browned" feel, it permeated the entire turkey breast.
Definitely a keeper, definitely a make again.  Gives me the  incentive to try some more!

I couldn't get my turkey breast to fit in our slow cooker, so I used a chicken instead, and my boyfriend loved it!!  I used the onion soup mix and a little bit of chicken broth in the bottom.  I was a little crunched for time, so I put it on High for 2 hours, and Low for 3 hours.  It was perfect!

Easy and simple. Coated lightly w/ olive oil. Used half a pack of italian grill seasoning instead w/ a little water. Let sit overnight.  Turned slow cooker on low next morning on my way out the door to work. Turned out perfect when I returned home.  Very moist and delicious.

THANK YOU SO MUCH!  This was the EASIEST part of Christmas dinner- my first to cook everything on my own, and my first turkey ever.  Next time I'll cook the turkey breast maybe a half hour less.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and made it with Easy Turkey Gravy from this site, then put them together the next day with the Thanksgiving Leftovers Casserole recipe.  Both turned out great.  Thanks again!

I tried this out last night and it turned out a little dry an the onion mix started to burn. I think that next time I will not cook it as long as the recipe says to. Other then that it had a good flavor and was tender.

We thought this was great.  I was very suprised.  I used a boneless turkey breast from Costco and it came with a gravey packet.  I just mixed the gravey packet in with the drippings.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  LOVED the easy prep work (I even used one of the slow cooker liners for easier clean up).  The turkey was very moist and tender ... the best I have ever made.  I would like more flavoring and will add more the next time I make it.

I made this & followed the recipe exact.  I have to say the turkey did create a lot of juice for gravy & the meat did fall off the bone but it was terribly dry.  I was able to salvage it & make a terrific turkey salad.

One word... excellent!  This was wonderful.  The turkey was juicy and was great the next day on sandwiches.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

So unbelievably delicious and as simple as it states. I used a fresh 3 1/2 lb. bone in turkey breast. I have been rating recipes for 10 years and this is my first 5 star rating.

I had to substitute. I don’t like doing that when I first try a recipe but I have Celiac and onion soup mix is not gluten free so I had to. I rummaged in my kitchen to find alternatives. I used dried onion flakes, poultry seasoning, celery seed, garlic, season salt and pepper. Then added a little bit (maybe a cup) of turkey stock from last Thanksgiving’s turkey I froze. I topped it off with a tablespoon of lemon juice, a few carrots and some pats of butter under the skin. When it was done, I poured the juice into a sauce pan, added a bit of Cabernet and reduced it to pour over the meat. The slow cooker method makes the turkey SOOOO tender and juicy! I never would have tried to do it until I stumbled on to this recipe.

i never would have thought...  it was amazing! Moist, delicious and easy.  Great idea to cook in slow cooker when you don't want the oven on or if you need to cook an extra breast but don't have room in the oven!

Thanks to all who previously reviewed this dish and gave me the confidence to try this for the first time for our family Christmas day gathering.  I was only able to find a 6-pound boneless breast (with skin on).  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was so simple!  It also received rave reviews from all!

So good and so easy! I used a 4 lb. bone-in turkey. Put chunky chopped onion & celery in the bottom of the cooker. After rubbing in onion soup placed bacon over breast. Roasted 5 hours. Sliced meat off bone & put in fridge overnight. Made 8 cups of gravy and refrigerated that overnight too. The next day I layered the meat & gravy in the cooker (used a liner for easy clean up) Reheated for 2-3 hours on low. Transferred to a serving platter & presto! a no fuss way to serve a small dinner party or potluck l.

Delicious!!! The only change I made was to pour 1/4 cup of pinot grigio over the turkey breast. My bone-in breast was only 4.5 lbs so my roast temp was at 165 in 4 hours. Slow cooked to moist and tender perfection with delicious gravy.

I have used this recipe for years with a 3lb. boneless breast. I start on high for an hour then reduce to low. Instead of a timed cook, I use a temperature probe set to 155*. Cooking time is just a little over two hours. Perfect every time.

Let me start by saying I cannot cook. I literally hurt people with my cooking. I tried this recipe yesterday and followed it verbatim. I put the turkey in the crockpot at 9:00 in the morning. At 5:00 in the evening I was eating the most delectable  turkey I have ever had in my entire life! I took pictures as I was cooking to prove that it was me that actually made this. I cannot thank you enough for this recipe!

I used 4 small turkey frozen breasts which weighed about 4 pounds in total.  After rubbing them in the onion soup mix, I sat them on top of baby carrots and a quartered onion.   On high for 1 hour and low for 3 hours.  Excellent...will make again.

I made it exactly like the LadaFun reviewer and it was magnificent. I am normally a dark meat eater since I find white me too dry. This recipe made the turkey so moist and fall off the bone tender. This is a fantastic recipe.

It doesn’t get easier than this and it turned out delicious!  Had a 2 lb bone-in turkey breast and cooked it on HIGH for 1 hour and on LOW for 2-1/4 hours.  Cooled it and sliced it with my electric carving knife....perfect for sandwiches.  It makes a delicious gravy also!
PS:  The 2nd time I made it I added garlic powder and black pepper to the onion soup.  Made it with turkey legs and it was delicious!

This was extremely moist and a different flavor/texture than an oven roasted turkey breast.  Pros and cons to each method, but you certainly can't fault the ease of this one.  Followed the advice of another reviewer and put the turkey on a bed of carrots, onions and celery and poured some broth over, for use in making gravy (I used the packets that came with the bone in skin on turkey breast).  All in all a solid recipe.

Mine came out very dry.   Like very, very dry.   Gravy made it edible.   I find slow cookers don't do well with most bird.  Red meat cooks fine because it has more sinew and fat, generally speaking.   This wasn't awful and it couldn't have been easier, but mine was way over cooked and I followed instructions to the T.

My family absolutely loved this! I served it with mash potatoes, seasoned slow simmered green beans, mash potatoes and gravy with stuffing. I’ll definitely be making this again.

This was so easy and turned out tasty!  I couldn't lift the turkey out to slice it, however, as the meat was falling off the bone!

Very good! Removed one star only because it didn't brown the way one might be used to. Definitely no need to add liquid, though the inclination to do so was hard to resist! I normally hate when people review a recipe when they haven't actually followed the recipe. In my case, I'm partially guilty because I used my own spice mix instead of the dry onion spice mix. I don't think there's any harm in using your own desires spices here, since the spice pack seems to have been just a time saving device. Using the slow cooker saved enough labor (no basting), and absolutely allowed for a thoroughly cooked and very juicy turkey experience. People who may be intimidated to use the oven should feel encouraged to go with the slow cooker method and feel confident!

Very easy! I used a 48oz. boneless turkey breast but still used the full onion soup packet. Definitely add 1/2 c. or so to the crock pot to keep the turkey moist! Cooked on high for 1 hour, but it was done after 4 more hours on low. DELISH!

I’ve made this many times and it’s always excellent!  I’ve done both the slow cook - 7hrs - and the fast cook - 4 hrs.  I didn’t really notice any difference.  Both were super moist, tender and delicious.  I just layer the bottom of the crock pot with onions, carrots, and celery. Sprinkle some poultry seasoning on the breast, add 1/2 C. Water, and in 4 hrs, I’ve got a delicious turkey breast!

This was unbelievably good and so easy.  I accidently got a turkey roast (frozen) which inclludes some dark meat.  Next time I’ll be sure to get turkey breast and I’m thinking it will be a five!

It was ok. Based on the reviews I was expecting a better tasting turkey. I will cut up the rest and use for sandwiches. I did put carrots, celery and onions on the bottom. Not for the flavor, but  because it made an easy side dish. The flavors did get into the vegetables and they were tasty.

I made a 7 lb turkey breast and followed the recipe exactly. After the first hour on high I turned the slow cooker down to low. After 4 1/2 hours total cooking time the pop up timer popped. I checked with an instant read thermometer and the breast was done. I had to wrap in foil and hold until all my side dishes were done, but the turkey was moist and delicious and my family gave it rave reviews. Next time I will plan on much shorter cooking time.

I didn't have any onion soup mix on hand, but the bone-in turkey breast came with a packet of gravy mix, so I used that instead. I also added a bit of sage and thyme, and threw a few baby carrots into the chest cavity. After 7 hours on high, the turkey was juicy and delicious and literally falling off the bone.

It was great! Added some butter, chicken stock, white wine, and some seasonings like garlic powder and various Italian seasonings. Leftovers are great for sandwiches and I made great turkey enchiladas with them.

I can't believe how easy it was to make it! I just thawed the turkey breasts, seasoned it with Montreal Steak seasoning mix. Turned on the slow cooker and it was cooked, juicy, and delicious by the time I got home! Definitely will be doing this again!

I changed the serving size from 12 to 6 and the cooking time did not adjust. NOT GOOD, used the original cooking time and it dried the turkey out. I fortunately removed from slow cooker with 2 hrs. left. After the fact I did a google search and learned the cook time should have been 3-4 hrs, NOT the 7-8 hrs. the directions stated for serving size for 12.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  Maybe it was the turkey breast I used.  Cooked in less time then stated and my turkey, while not dry. was tough and chewy.  Threw most of it out.  I didn't use onion soup mix, but celery and onions in bottom of cooker and added a cup of broth. The gravy turned out great. Might try this again with a different name brand turkey breast or thighs, maybe a whole chicken.

Love this!  I've done it several times now, and I've even tried using a whole chicken, and that turns out the best fall-apart , tender chicken EVER!

I followed the directions exactly.  I was a little skeptical about not adding any liquid.  It turned out GREAT!  It was so moist and tender.  It had a good amount of juice at the end and I made a nice gravy from that.  I will definitely make this one again.

Cooked it an hour less than called for, and it still came out dry. Very little flavor. I think cooking a turkey breast in the crockpot is a nice idea, but this recipe came out very bland. I didn't add all the liquid, and still had juices in the bottom of the crockpot. Served that over the turkey to try and hide the dryness of the meat. Won't be making this recipe again. Sorry.

Couldn't bring myself not to add some chicken broth--but the onion soup mix really gave those horribly drab turkey breast cutlets a TON of flavor. Served with my stuffing and roasted Brussel sprouts.

I loved this dish. I had a left over turkey breast in the freezer.  I cut up a few stalks of celery and a carrot and put those at the bottom of the crock pot. I took 4 slices of bacon, and wrapped the onion soup covered turkey pinning the bacon with tooth picks. Put the turkey in the crock pot on top of the veggies and cooked on hi for an hour and on low for another 4 1/2 hours.
OMG was it delightful! The carrots, celery and broth from turkey breast were delicious on mashed potatoes.
This is a simple keeper!

This was soooo good last week that I decided to make it again today! My kids (who are extremely picky) loved it and wanted it again! So easy! The only think I did different was that I added 1 cup of water, 1 chicken bullion cube, I lined the bottom with 6 red potatoes and some carrots, then placed the meat on top! So easy and then I had the sides to go with it!

I love how simple this recipe is and the turkey breast was amazing. I did not alter the recipe, except that I used a breast about half the size (couldn't find one larger) and my meat thermometer showed it was ready after 1.5 hrs high, 2.5low.

This recipe turned out great.  Considering the cost and simplicity of the recipe makes this is a solid recipe.  Slow cooker recipes are easy...but I mean this was ridiculously easy!

Great way to do  a turkey breast! I added some herbed butter under the skin.  Also put some onions  in the bottom of the pot.  I cooked less time than called for and stuck the turkey breast under the broiler at the end to crispen up the skin while I made the gravy,  which was delicious! Will cook even less time next time as the breast  was  dry.

Followed exactly. Personally thought it was a tad dry, although I don't have anything to compare to as I have never made a turkey breast before. I have only made whole roasted turkey in oven.

I followed the recipe to the letter and the turkey breast came out fantastic! I took the tip and spread some butter around the edges of the crock pot and this made the skin golden brown.  It was tender and delicious.  I made the gravy from the drippings and it was very good also. This is the only way to cook a turkey breast.   B. Roundtree

I had hoped to add turkey to our rotation since my husband likes it. But we thought this was dry and just okay. Since newer slow cookers are known to run hot, I cooked the breast for 4 hours and added ½ cup of broth. I even used someone’s suggestion to cook it with the ribs up and breast down.

Best turkey breast ever! I have done this a couple times and have had such success with it that I knew it would be our Christmas dinner. The only thing I do differently is to rub the turkey inside and out, and under the skin, with butter. I have used both the onion soup mix and the herb and garlic soup mix. I get compliments every time, and my husband can't get enough of it! Great recipe!

Great Idea, Good Recipe;   BUT, I noted users who stated Turkey was DRY and Overcooked.  Used 3.6 lb Bone in Breast, put two pats butter in Bottom of Cooker added 1/4 cup Chicken Broth , cooked on High for ONE HOUR, Low for NINETY MINUTES - - Noticed Meat separating at Bone - -Meat Thermometer Read 175/185.    TURKEY WAS DONE.   Recommendation-- - This is an EXCELLENT WAY TO PREPARE Turkey - - But watch the TIME & Use a Good Meat Thermometer.

Loved this easy recipe for fresh turkey breast.  I look forward to making it again several times this winter so we have sandwich meat.  I combined several suggestions from the reviews, but I think as long as you have an up-to-date slow cooker, you can't lose.  Enjoy!

This was easy and since I didn't have onion soup mix I just sprinkled a poultry seasoning over it. I also put celery, carrots and onion in the bottom with turkey breast on top. Turned out good but not quite 5 star.

It was good except I cooked it only 6-1/2 hours on low and it was a little on the dry side so next time I'll only cook it for 6 hours and see if it's any better.

We used a 7 pound breast and followed the cooking directions..  At 6&1/2 hours it was already 170 degrees so we turned it from low to warm.  I suggest adding, "Cook on low until meat thermometer reads 165 degrees in the thickest part of the breast."

Very easy and came out very tender.  Not much flavor so need to come up with some additional spices.  Will definitely do this again.

Great idea and SO easy! I did inject some butter into the breasts. Only caution I'd have would be that it cooks faster than you think. I did one hour on high and then put it on low. Breasts were done after about 2 1/2 hours on low. Moist and delicious!!

I added 1 and a half cups of chicken broth, because I added diced potatoes and an  onion after the first hour, and broccoli and cauliflower about 3 hours later. Turned out great.

Should have made the modifications listed in the top review as the turkey lacked flavor.  Also I cooked this on high for 1 hour, then low for 6 hours and it was too dry.  Next time I would decrease the cook time to 1 hour on high, 4-5 hours on low.  My turkey breast was just over 5 lbs.

This was really good and easy.  I followed the recipe only my turkey breast was a little under 5 pounds so it didn't cook as long as the recipe stated. I love turkey sandwiches and we had
turkey enchiladas also. This was so convenient and simple that I am sure I will make it again.

Quick and easy! The turkey breast came out flavorful and very juicy. there was a lot of juicy on the bottom of the slow cooker at the end of cooking. I made gravy with it by removing it from the cooker and thickening  it with flour.

So easy and so delicious! I added 1/2 cup chicken broth to the bottom of my crock with a chopped onion. I also brushed the bird with melted butter and sprinkled with powdered garlic and poultry seasoning before rubbing with the soup mix. The meat fell off the bone! It was so moist. I served it on a platter with the drippings sprinkled on top. Very flavorful! This will be my new go to recipe for turkey.

I had to make changes because I realized at the last moment that I had NO soup mix.  I improvised with various spices... garlic, salt, pepper, thyme and sage.  It was wonderful and was so moist you could gum it. YUM!!! I will definitely make this again.

This is a great way to make turkey or chicken breast.  I can not use soup mix (MSG in them) so I used the chopped celery and onion on the bottom  and put the breast on top  and some chicken broth in the CP.  It was really good. Everyone loved it .  Very tender and moist.

I put my crock-pot without the lid inside the oven with about 45 minutes left to brown. (Baste drippings!) - Very tasty, could've used more seasonings though.

Made this today for a late Thanksgiving dinner.  We really liked it.  Next time, I might take it out and try to crisp the skin under the broiler in my oven.  Good flavor, and very tender.  Will definitely make this again.  Almost forgot to say, I added about 2 ounces of water at the beginning.

It's super easy and tasty I really loved this, but do use a thermometer i think I over cooked mine and it wasn't dry, but not as moist as others and I read a review about how crockpots now have higher cooking capacity. So something for me to remember next time. This will be my go to to prepare turkey each year.

This recipe does not work, without adjustments, for a 3 lb boneless breast. I do not know what I was thinking, but I used a boneless breast and then followed the recipe. I came home to a scorched crock pot and a burnt turkey breast. My best guess is 1) adjust the cooking time to maybe 4-5 hours; 2) add at least a 1/2 cup to 1 cup of liquid.

Used this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and what a relief it was to have use of the oven while this was cooking!  I too added broth for moisture and gravy.  Next time will cook the bone-in turkey breast with the breast meat facing down and will also cut down on the cooking time.

Deeeeelish, simple, a way to enjoy your day and keep the oven off,  Moist, sliced to perfection with gravy from drippings.  I did add some vegetable broth to pot to ensure I had gravy.  With the onion soup already cooked in and on the breast.....WOW what a tasty home run for Thanksgiving..

I had a 6.5 pound turkey breast, bone in.  I only did one hour high, and 5 hours low.  I would say it was a smidge over done, for my taste .  Next time, I'd try 1 hour high and maybe 4 or 4.5 on low!  Thx u!

Thiis is so easy.  I made a turkey breast in the crock pot (fam doesn't much care for dark meat).  It came out juicy and delicious.  I didn't have any onion soup on hand, so just left it out.  Put cut up onion and celery under the breast and in the cavity.  Also added a cup of turkey stock.

This recipe was yummy and very easy!  I combined this with another recipe I wanted to try, so I did everything as per this recipe and added the following:  I greased the crock pot with 3 pats of butter, I added chopped celery to the crock pot plus 1 cup of broth, and I added chopped fresh sage, thyme and rosemary to the onion soup rub. My turkey breast is bone-in and 8 lbs. I left the pit on high for 3 hours then reduced to low. I cooked it for 8-9 hours and it was moist and literally fell off the bone. Definitely a keeper!

I wasn't sure but cooked it in my Simply Ming slow/pressure cooker an it couldn't have been better. I did add some poultry seasoning to "feel the season" but I'm sure it wasn't a huge departure from the original. I was very pleased and must admit it was better than cooking it in my large roaster in every way. The meat remained tender, very moist, sliceable and cleanly slid off ever bone! Clean up very minimal! Five stars and two thumbs way up!

I've made this for years but a different way. Get a slow cooker liner for easy clean up.  Spray the breast with cooking spray and set aside.  Slice onion for the bottom of the pot with some fresh sage.  Salt and pepper the breast and place it upside down in cooker.  Make sure salt and pepper are on this side too.  Put in 1 stick of butter and few slices of lemon.  1/2 cup of chicken stock and cook this for about 4 hours.  Juicy and flavorful.   Happy Thanksgiving or any day.

This is a very easy recipe and makes a very moist turkey breast with lots of au jus.  I add 1/2 orange juice and a can of whole berry cranberry sauce.  It is fantastic.

I made this for Thanksgiving potluck at work and by the end there was nothing left but the boned carcass! Needless to say it was a hit at the potluck. I didn't add any liquid and I had a 6 lb turkey. I had to tuck the legs in the bird to fit the lid on the crockpot,and let it cook on low 7 hrs overnight. Like other reviews I  used butter and rubbed on the skin and added chopped celery,onions and baby carrots. I also added a few shakes of Mrs.Dash salt free seasoning and a couple of shakes of poultry season. Juicy,tender bird with lots if flavor and yummy broth if you like to make  your own gravy to go with the turkey. I highly recommend this recipe!

Wow! Didn't expect such flavorful turkey! 
Did a 7lbs bird with onion powder, garlic powder and some pepper. For 8 hours on low and we love it! Turkey is so moist, only better way to cook a bird is to smoke it.
Have never done a bird in the over and now never will.

I used this recipe with a 7.25 lb turkey breast. After reading the other comments, I added some chopped celery,onion and carrot and a can of turkey broth. I was able to make a delicious gravy by adding some flour after draining the liquid. Sadly the turkey breast was over done after following the directions. I let it sit for about 10 minutes and half the meat shredded when carved. Oh well. I will try this again with a shorter cooking time.

I've made this several times, with minor modifications each time. So far, the most successful version ( see also: my girls BOTH ate it) is: 
recipe as described,
1c chicken broth (or enough to cover the bottom of the crock),
1/4c butter

I throw the butter in with the broth, and baste twice while cooking.

Soooo easy and very tasty!  With the leftovers, I made turkey tetrazzini, BBQ shredded turkey sandwiches, and turkey noodle soup for a family of four.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I made this and it was a hit with our family.  I used some other recommendations and put cut up onion, celery and onion in the bottom of the crock pot.  The frozen turkey breast came with a gravy packet that was easy and great on top of the meat.

Yes.  I found 'Ladafun's' suggestions:  added 1/2 c. Broth, 3 celery stalks and 1 sweet onion, 1T melted butter drizzled over it,  rubbed with sage, thyme, 1/2 T garlic, and perhaps poultry seasoning, and of course still the onion soup mix.  My husband and I adored it.  Yum!

Only change I made was to sprinkle breast with fresh ground black pepper, not a bunch, and then placed 6 tabs of butter under the skin and cooked per directions. Turkey breast was scrumptious and made excellent sandwiches with leftovers. As per comments via Valerie, I think your slow cooker was used on high the entire time or your slow cooker is not working properly. That's why they call them slow cookers and the purpose is to make all meat within tender and moist.

I used a 5 lb turkey breast and it was done after 30 minutes  on high and 4 hours on low.  I suspect it would have been done and a little juicer with 30 minutes less cooking time.  The juices made a nice gravy.

It really was that simple. I followed the recipe for the turkey breast, added some carrots, onions, and potatoes to the crock pot when I got home from work, and 2 hours later we ate a fantastic dinner. Great flavor, juicy meat, and so easy.

No additions needed. The only thing we did different was   to cook on low for 10 hours because of our schedule. It was cooked well and moist. Super easy for a great home cooked meal during the week.

I made this today. Turned out really great!  I used only the packet of onion soup mix and spread it underneath the skin of the turkey breast. I did place a cut-up onion, some sliced celery, and baby carrots in the slow cooker along with it. I had a 7 1/2 pound breast, so I had to kind of move it around periodically so it would cook evenly. The lid would barely close!  It came out very moist and tender.   I was a little hesitant about leaving it in there without adding any liquids, but after reading other reviews, I thought I'd give it a try. I'm happy I did!  It produced so much juice!  I was able to combine about two cups of the juice with the sauce packet that came with the breast to make a delicious gravy. I did make a slurry of some cornstarch and water to thicken it up a bit. Even my three-year-old enjoyed it!

Made this using an 8 1/2 lb. bone in turkey breast.  Rubbed a little butter on in, sprinkled the onion soup on & started it on high for the first 2 hrs.  Then cooked on low for another 7 hrs.  It smelled soooo good & tasted fantastic!!   The meat was so tender it fell off the bones.  Used the liquid as gravy for our mashed potatoes.  I will make this again for sure.  I think i will even try making it this way with chicken too.

This was great.  Mine was done in 5 hours, much less time than indicated in the recipe, and I was using a larger turkey breast (8lbs or so).  Check your temperature along the way so it doesn't overcook and dry out.

I cooked it in crockpot for about 4 1/2 hrs on high. It was the juiciest turkey breast we ever had. I used the dry onion soup mix, chopped a few stalks of celery and some onion , put under it and added 1 1/2 cups chicken broth, also drizzled a lil butter over it. Highly recommend crockpot turkey breast!!

I made this for Christmas as a second meat and it was wonderful. The only changes was to add sliced celery, garlic and onion to the bottom of the crock. The meat was moist and flavorful. Very good the next day.

It was so easy, and you wouldn't think the soup mix would flavor the meat so wonderfully.  My guests we're raving about it!

So easy I was afraid it would over cook because of some the reviews, but it didn't.  I kept it breast side down for the first several hours to keep it a juicy as possible.

I used a smaller turkey breast. I 1st rub it with couple spoons of butter, then used my home made onion soup mix ( from this site ). And, I reduced the cooking time, on low, to 6 hours. 
I still got a very dry turkey breast ! I made some gravy with the juices rendered and smothered the turkey meat in it to make it edible.

This is now in the keeper category. So easy, Two ingredients, no work,  just plug in the crock pot and let it cook.  Didn't change a thing.  When it was sliced and on the platter I took the juice and drizzled it over the turkey, so tender and most.  Great!  Leaves your oven free for all the other oven dishes.

Made this for Thanksgiving. Used a 6lb bone-in turkey breast (not frozen). Made a bed of celery stalks and 1/2 an onion in bottom of slow cooker. Smeared turkey with a little bit of butter before sprinkling onion-mushroom soup mix in and on it. Cooked on high 1 hour, then low for about 6 hours. I had a little extra room in my oven, so moved turkey to a baking dish, basted with some of the drippings, and popped in the oven with my sides at 350 for about 30 minutes. It browned beautifully, and the meat fell off the bone when carving! I made gravy from the drippings, right in the slow cooker. Everything was delish!!

Easy and made the house smell like heaven! But...the turkey came out a bit dry AND some parts of it were still pink. I think I'll stick to oven roasting...

I didn't have plain onion soup mix so I used beefy onion (I've used that with poultry before and it's always been good).  DELICIOUS!!!  And SO EASY!!

This may be my husband's favorite meal I make. It is sooo easy and moist - and the flavor is perfect. I make it with a turkey roast (we like that better than the turkey breast - have tried both). Also, I toss in a bag of frozen green beans and a couple of cut up potatoes. For the sake of the spuds, I put a bit of sea salt on the top. But if you leave that out, it is still amazing.

I made this as stated. No extra seasoning as I figured the soup mix would add enough salt. It was perfect! And so simple! I served it with homemade mashed potatoes and bacon-wrapped green beans. I will definitely make this again.

Modified it slightly... Used a 3 lb turkey breast, a little olive oil on the bottom of the slow cooker before putting the turkey down, then only cooked on low for about four hours before checking it. Took it out and cut it up and put it back in juice (put the skin back on top of it) then cooked for 30 more minutes on low. Let stay on warm for 3-4 more hours to soak in the juice. Incredibly tender!

MY HUSBAND LOVED IT!!  Made today for Thanksgiving.  6 lb bone-in turkey breast.  Only changes were to add cayenne pepper to the onion soup and put some celery in the bottom of the slow cooker.  Wanted to deviate more, based on other comments, but decided to stick to the recipe.  Only took 6 hrs to reach 170 degrees.  Cut off the bone with ease.  Not dry, plenty juicy and sliced perfectly.  Never made a turkey with such raved reviews in the oven.  Strained juice from the bottom of the slow cooker is being saved for left overs.  I don't eat meat, but based on my husband's reaction, I may have to re-think!!  Turkey in a slow cooker.... who would have thought?

I made this and it was AWESOME! The best turkey I have EVER had! My mother in law bought a turkey breast from a gourmet grocery chain and mine was so much better. So juicy. You can't screw this up! The only thing differently I did was put chicken broth in the bottom of the slow cooker, just to cover the bottom. I will never make turkey a different way again!

I used a Cajon seasoned turkey breast, and added a little chicken broth...served with cranberry sauce, stovetop dressing, and salad. I added a few tablespoons of drippings to the gravy, and thickened it a bit, and it added a little Cajon zing to it.  Easy feast!

Made as directed with some cuts if butter under skin. Flipped a couple times. Drizzled juice in top. Just barely fed family. Could have been bigger bird or two birds? Don't use target cook in bag pre seasoned.  Go to cub or byerlys.

Great in oven, too.  Added melted butter about 2/3 through once flipped to breast side up.

We thought it was very good.  Unfortunatly, the store did not have a large breast so they convinced me to use 2 , 3 lb breasts.  I did thd hour on high and 7 on low gthen let it sit on warm about an hour or so till we were ready to eat.  It was a little dry, but the juices from the bottom of the pan fixed that.  Maybe having 2 smaller pieces dried it out a little.
Next time I’ll get the bigger piece.

I am cooking a turkey breast this way for the second time. The first time I tried it the meat was moist and flavorful, everyone loved it. It is so easy to make. I will continue to make turkey breats this way.

Awesome turkey!  We made this for Thanksgiving and it was stellar!  I had some chicken broth leftover from another use, so I poured that in the crock pot at the beginning, as some folks had suggested, but it wasn't necessary.  Stick to the recipe and you'll be delighted.  Used the leftovers to make Turkey Salad Sandwiches (turkey, mayo, sliced red grapes, celery, and dillweed).  That was fab, too!

This recipe was a disappointment.  Unfortunately, it was not as flavorful and moist as I had hoped, even though there was a lot of juices in the crock.  The breast hardly fit in my crock pot.  The only positive was that since I was making it for Thanksgiving, it freed my oven up for all the sides I was also making.  Next year will be back to the oven for my Thanksgiving turkey.

This was a winner with the fam! We had time to turn the slow cooker to both temps and to make some of the adjustments mentioned in the reviews. The meat was tender and awfully juicy. Can't wait to use it for leftovers as well.

I had this recipe saved for more than a year before I finally took a chance on it. I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. My "slow" cooker did overcook it a bit so it had some dry areas but overall it was a hit. Will make this again soon!

I have made turkey breast in my slow cooker for years and it is always moist  and tender; hard to achieve that in the oven! I started this at Thanksgiving, while I still do a turkey in the oven but this allows me to do a smaller turkey and have a lot more turkey breast, which is our favorite anyway.

This was so easy that it even came out excellent for me.  I added a few drops of liquid smoke on the breast is the only thing different I did, but will try some of the reviews ideas.  Whom ever come up with this recipe is to be commended.  It is a no fuss no mess meal.  Thx.

Yummy!  Instead of the onion soup mix, I rubbed some Mrs. Dash over the turkey.  It came out nice and moist, unlike most turkey breasts.  I usually prefer dark meat because white always comes out so dry, but that wasn't the case with this recipe! :)

Wow!! Never would have thought about cooking a turkey breast in a crockpot.  Sooooo moist.  Followed recipe plus added the butter as recommended by others. Loved the onion soup, but will be experimenting with all kinds of seasonings now. ThankyouThankyouThankyou

This was the moistest white meat turkey I have ever had.  I normally like dark meat the best.  I put some carrots and celerey in the cavity of the turkey breast and on the bottom of the crockpot just for some added flavor.   This made really flavorful drippings.

loved it! i never considered cooking a turkey breast in the crock pot before. i used a 3 lb boneless breast. i slathered the breast with softened butter, under and over the skin. same with the soup mix. i also coated the crock pot with butter. cooked on high for an hour and switched to low for 3.5 more hours. i put it in a hot (450 degrees) oven for 10 minutes. it was moist, tender and flavorful. cooked while we were at church! next time i'll cook skin down, and maybe i can avoid the browning step at the end. thanks!

The outer part of the turkey breast was a little dry, but the meat was very moist and pulled away easily.  Does not require entire package of Soup Mix, maybe 3/4 for slightly milder flavour.

very oniony flavour of the gravy that I made after.  I added about a cup of water before turning it on, used a turkey breast skin off, and slow cooked the afternoon away.  Tasty!

Perfect! Can't believe how great this was with only 2 ingredients. I made up my own, onion soup mix from online somewhere to cut the sodium. I also rubbed the breast with it while frozen and defrosted overnight. I didn't do the full hour on high(had to leave for work). Cooked 10.5 hours on low, and it was cooked perfectly and really moist! I used th liquid that came out and mixed with a low-sodium pack mix for some gravy and had the perfect not quite Christmas dinner on a Tuesday. There are leftovers and I cannot wait for a sandwich with them! Will definitely make this again, Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe two nights ago.  My husband and I both enjoyed it very much.  I used a turkey breast with out the bone.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was written.  However, I only needed to cook my turkey breast on low for four hours, after turning it down from the one hour on high.  Do not change a single thing.  Next time I will use a turkey breast with a bone in it.   I will make gravy with the drippings from the bottom of the crockpot.  Great recipe.  I liked it especially because there was only two ingredients.  Thanks for this great tasting recipe.

I was really surprised as to how good this was.  I used a 3lb boneless turkey breast and just added the onion soup.  I cooked it in the slow cooker for 3 hours on low then put it on warm for a couple hours.  It turned out perfect and sooo easy.  Will definitely make this again and again.

I have done this for years.  As another option, I done turkey legs this same way.  First of all, I put them in frozen, on high.  For this recipe I typically use the Herb and Garlic, but have used other seasonings such as Mrs. Dash, season salt and pepper.  The one thing that is important is that you only put only about 2-4 tablespoons of water in crockpot.  I end up with browned turkey legs at the end of the day.  I do not reduce the heat.

I tried this recipe with a 5.71 lb. breast, and I overcooked it on slow for 5 hours.  I also found the meat to be flavorless.  I'm a novice at cooking, so I'm sure I did something wrong.  I want to try it again, only with some of the suggestions that were posted on the reviews.  Especially the meat thermometer and and the chicken broth.  I am also going to change to a cajun type seasoning and insert it or inject it into the breast.  I'll let you know!

This was absolutely incredable.  I have never eaten turkey that was as tender as this was.  I will never make turkey any other way.  So good that my 12 year old who hates turkey (because it's so dry) had a second helping.  Did what another person suggested and put celery and onion on the bottom of the pot and added some herbs.  Thanks for this one!!!

The best turkey breast I've ever made.  I didn't have onion soup mix, so I made up my own.  The flavor was there and the turkey was fall off the bone tender.  My family loved it!  I think I will do this in the crock pot from now on even with different seasonings.  No muss no fuss!

We had this for Thanksgiving (there are only 3 of us), and it was perfectly cooked.  There was plenty of liquid for a yummy gravy (I strained it, and added a little flour).  I also smeared the slow cooker and turkey with butter and added a tiny bit of water to cover the bottom as many reviews suggested.

I made this to supplement my Thanksgiving Day turkey and it was great.  It came out very flavorful, tender and moist.  I added 2/3 can of jellied cranberry sauce (berried would work too) along with a cup of chicken broth to this recipe.  Be sure to use a whisk to mix it all together before pouring on top of the turkey breast. The sweetness of the cranberry sauce helped to balance the oniony flavor to produce a very pleasing dish.

We absolutely loved this idea and will definitely do it again. After reading the other reviews, I to tweaked it a bit. I used Morton's Nature's Seasons and a cup of blush wine. Cooked it for about 7 hours and it was so tender and so moist, I couldn't believe. I will definitely make it again.    After Thanksgiving, I took some of the leftover turkey, added some green beans, carrots and gravy. Placed it in a glass baking dish and topped it with dressing. Made a quick, easy meal, served it with a salad. Yum Yum

This was exactly what my roommate and I needed for Thanksgiving! I cooked it exactly as directed, except used a 3lb. turkey instead, since it was just the two of us. Was very moist and had a great flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe (although my turkey breast was around 8 pounds) with the addition of maybe 1/4 cup chicken broth in the bottom of the slow cooker. I cooked it on high for around three hours and then on low for around four hours. The gravy that the broth and juices made was lovely, but the turkey had a funky flavour to it. I'm not sure if the slow cooker sort of intensified the turkey taste (in the same way that we don't like the flavour of ground turkey) or what, but it was off-putting... It may have been our turkey, though it's a well-known brand I've purchased before without problem. I don't think I'll do it again with turkey, but definitely with a chicken! Thanks for sharing, Ms. Sally!

This was great!  I did put some onions and celery on the bottom of the slow cooker, poured in about 1/2 can of chicken broth and then placed the turkey breast on top. I cooked it for 2 hours on high and 2 hours on low and used a 3 pound boneless breast because thats what I had on hand.  I came out moist and very tasty!  Great meal!  Thanks!

Who knew you could cook a turkey breast in the slow cooker? This was excellent. I prepared this exactly like the instructions and it was delicious! I did have to cut the entire breast into two pieces since it wouldn't fit in my crock pot. Luckily I had two so I could cook both pieces at the same time.

The only thing I did different was put enough chicken broth to cover the bottom of the slow cooker.  The best turkey we have ever had.  Lots of flavor and very moist.

Easy way to make it, but once the button pops, take it out!  Will dry up if you cook longer.

Turkey cooked up nice.  I decided to add some carrots, onions, and celery to the recipe like others said.  Also threw in just a little bit of butter.  The turkey came out really tasty, although I would say it was a little dry but was nothing a little gravy didn't fix. My slow cooker boils even on low so I am not sure if it cooked too high for too long.  Either way it turned out really good and I would say this was the easiest way to cool a turkey breast :)  Nothing beats an oven roasted turkey, I missed the crunchy outside.

Wow.  This was so easy and turned out great. It fell off the bone and had so much flavor. I will make this again soon.  We may even do it this way for thanksgiving this year. :)

I love this recipe! It's the easiest and tastiest way to make a turkey breast. I don't know why, but when I make it, it's done before the 8 hour cook time. The meat is so tender, it falls off the bone.

This turkey turned out moist and very tender. I lined the bottom of the slow cooker with baby carrots,onions and celery and 1/2 c. of chicken broth. The turkey was a little bit salty but otherwise very good.

Very easy and my husband liked it. I could not get a turkey breast as big as that called for, so I cooked it less time and added water to dilute the onion soup mix. Pured the liquid into a pot and added cornstarch mixed with water while the turkey rested to create gravy. An easy dinner entree. Thanks.

I will never bake another turkey ever again.  This was too easy.  Obviously, if you are going for the pretty golden skin bird, this is not the one for you.  But if you want to most moist turkey ever, try this one.  I did cut up a small onion and a few stalks of celery and put underneath the bird in the slow cooker.  I added just enough chicken broth to cover the bottom of the dish.  8 hours and cooked to perfection.

This came out quite dry.  There was a lot of juice at the bottom of the crock pot so I just served the meat in a deep dish with the juice.  This seemed to help with the dryness.  There is enough juice to make gravy if you prefer.

Did this for T-Giving (along with a slow cooker ham in a second pot).   Good but so tender it tended to make shredded meat rather than slices.   Maybe slice it sooner and then finish cooking?   I will make this again.

Gave this 4 stars because it was very moist.  The flavor however was not as good as a roasted turkey breast.  I sent my husband to the store to buy the turkey breast and he said that they only had bone in 3-3.5 lb turkey breasts so he bought two of them.  

Well, since I had two 3 lb turkey breasts I decided to do a taste test.  I used this recipe for one at 1 hour on high then 1.5 hours on low.  The other I baked with salt, pepper, garlic, and poultry seasoning.  The one that I baked was far more flavorful but a little on the dry side.  The one that I used for the recipe here was very moist but the onion soup was not something that we liked on the turkey.  
If I make this again I will do something other than  the onion soup.

The turkey was great (though it was done an hour earlier than stated) and the drippings made some awesome gravy! I just mixed in some Wondra and cranked the slow cooker up to High.

This turned out surprisingly delicious.  After reading the mixed reviews I was concerned it would be too dry, so I watched it like a hawk and basted it a few times.  Probably would have cooked faster if I hadn't opened the lid so much.  I made this one to ensure we didn't run out of turkey (we also roasted & fried one.)     I put some pats of butter under the skin, rubbed the turkey with butter; added 2 sliced garlic cloves slit into the breast,  1/2 cup vegetable stock and threw in some extra chopped onions to the bottom.  My husband raved about it.

The turkey turns out so moist and juicy, it was fabulous and easy.  I took some of the previous reviewers' suggestions and added some onion, celery and chicken broth.  I think I might try it next time without the onion soup mix, I think I'd like it better just rubbed with butter, kosher salt and pepper. 
Thanks for the recipe!

WOW this is fantastic.  The only things I did differently is I did cook the turkey breast in 1 cup of chicken broth in the bottom of the slow cooker.  I also put a few pads of butter in the bottom of the slow cooker.  To add my own little touch I also minced up some fresh garlic.  I rubbed the garlic on top of the turkey breast, and added some to the bottom of the slow cooker.  The drippings and broth from the bottom of the pan can be turned into a great gravy.  My husband loved this recipe, and asked if we make out Thanksgiving turkey this way.

We cook this turkey breast a lot, only with a can of beer added.I will try it without the beer now! Great for use in the camper, when we are out fishing all day, and the left over is so good for sandwiches!

I gave this a 4* because I did not like the onion soup flavor. I did not make any changes to the recipe. The gravy was a bit to strong with the soup. I will try again with my usual turkey seasoning.  
But, I am convienced that the crock pot is the way to go for a very tender turkey
breast.

Excellent recipe.  Like others, I put some water at the bottom of the pot.  Thanks for sharing!

This was incredibly easy and sooo good!  I did cut a lemon in half and stuff it in the turkey's...you know...  Mine did come out a bit dry, but only because I was worried about undercooking (it was still a bit frozen in spots).  Next time I'll thaw completely and follow the timing of the recipe.  The drippings made into gravy on the stove with a little cornstarch was delicious as well.  I'll definitely make this again and again!

Wow! This seemed to simple to be possible. I used Knorr French Onion. It does give the bird a bit of a distinct flavor, but still delicious and moist and very tender. I think almost any good packaged soup mix would work, and give you tons of recipe options. I did rub butter in the bottom of the crock pot to prevent sticking, instead of adding any liquid. I put it on late so I cooked on high for 3 hours and on low for a few more. What an awesome lowfat alternative in the slow cooker. I may never put a chuck roast in my crock pot again. Simply genius!!!!!

I like the idea of this recipe but it should suggest adding a little water or broth and maybe injecting the turkey breast with a seasoning of choice. I just cook mine today and it turn out great with the suggestion I recommand. Thanks for for the lipton soup suggestion.

This was so easy and the results were so, so delicious. The juiciest turkey I've had in so long! I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and added a little butter to the bottom of the pot, as well as a little water. After the ease of this recipe, I can't imagine making a turkey breast any other way. I had a 4 lb turkey and cooked it on low for 7 hours ... I probably could have gotten away with a little less.

P E R F E C T!!! My husband requested that I make another two days after Thanksgiving since there were no leftovers. This is "a must try" turkey for all. Enjoy.

Well, I'm a big crock pot fan, so I thought I would like this more.  I have used this exact recipe with a pot roast, and everyone loves it here.  I didn't care for the onion soup flavoring on turkey breast.  Maybe that's just my opinion, however.  Sure was easy!

I followed the recipe and added celery and baby carrots. I also added garlic powder. The turkey was very good. Very moist. However my veggies weren't done all the way, and I even prefer them a little on the"Al Dente" side.I think a little more liquid and starting the veggies earlier, and this would have been perfect

I thought this was ok...It was very simple to do.  It did fall off the bone when it was done, but I think I prefer my turkey breast cooked in the oven or on the grill.  I'm using the left overs to make the southwestern turkey soup recipe on this site which is really, really yummy! I'll keep this recipe in my slow cooker file for those busy days.  Thanks for sharing!
