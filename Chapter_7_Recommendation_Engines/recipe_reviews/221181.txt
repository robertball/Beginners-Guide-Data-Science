I made enough for three people. I did not worry about pan frying them, I just heated them on both sides of the tortilla in the skillet, took the tortilla out, laid the warm tortilla on a foil lined cookie sheet and topped it, then baked it until everything was warm and melty. I served this with my homemade salsa. I loved the simplicity of this recipe (the kids thought that tortilla pizzas were great) and it used the rest of a package of tortillas I had to get rid of.  Win/win. I'll make this again.

My family LOVED these and they are so easy to put together!  I did use chives instead of green onions because I have an herb explosion in my backyard right now--including cilantro!  These are perfect for a quick Cinco de Mayo party, and so simple to do you can throw a party in minutes ; ).  We ate ours with sour cream and taco sauce.  Thanks Lucylove!

A very simple quick summer night meal, especially if you let the hubs do the tortilla cooking while you cut everything up. He actually cooked both sides of the tortilla, then we topped with the toppings, the beans were so hot the cheese melts when you put it over them. We actually make this often but use flour tortillas in a burrito style so corn was a nice treat. I checked three stores and the largest corn tortillas I could find were only 5 1/2 inch, but still worked fine. Oh almost forgot this was the recipe of the week selection. Thanks Lucy.

Used flour tortilla instead (none of us likes corn tortilla, just a personal preference) and everyone enjoyed it. Made it the lazy people's way... browned them in a skillet on stovetop and then added beans and cheese and heated it more and then removed them, topped it with everything else and moved them to preheated toasteroven for a few more minutes to keep them warm. Voila! Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  I added avocado and didn't have the cilantro, so I left that off, but it would have been great with it.  Loved it!

I admit to changing the method a tad but these were good. I used the recommended grill method and after burning the first batch I lowered the heat and slowly browned them(it took about 10 minutes a side). I did both sides prior to topping them and did not replace to melt the cheese. The shells stored well until dinner and we just topped and served. No soggy crust. They were nice and crisp so we ate them whole like tostadas rather than cutting. I made this for last week's recipe group.

This is my recipe and I must apologize for the stated 7-inch tortillas. I've no idea how that happened. I use the standard 5-6-inch ones available in most supermarkets. Do avoid tortillas marked "Thin" or "Extra Thin" because they usually won't stand up to the toppings. For a nice touch, drizzle taco sauce or thinned sour cream over the top. I use a narrow-tipped squeeze bottle.

Recipe Group Selection 8/17/2013 -  I wasn’t crazy about these, but to be honest I didn’t follow the recipe exactly, using flour tortillas and omitting the cilantro because I don’t care for it.  I liked how easy they were to prepare; and it was a good use of the plum tomatoes in the garden.

Made this for Recipe Group...These were delicious! The only thing that I didn't have on hand was the cilantro, but I wish I did b/c it would've been a wonderful addition. I just made enough for me for lunch today, but I plan on making more next week for dinner (with cilantro, lol), b/c I know hubby will love them. I ended up folding it in 1/2 and eating it like a taco. These would be great served w/ a bit of sour cream and salsa, which is what I plan to do next time. This is a winner~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this recipe for Recipe Group. I served this for breakfast and liked this. I remember I tasted something similar in Greece, just without beans. I used flour tortillas and white beans. I didn`t have Mexican cheese blend, so used a regular hard cheese I had on hands instead. Didn`t have geen onions, so used  basil instead. Actually you can play with the ingredients in this recipe. I would add garlic too. Goes well with tomatoes and cilantro in this recipe. Thank you for the nice idea, definitely will use this recipe again. Tasty, refreshing and nutricious.
