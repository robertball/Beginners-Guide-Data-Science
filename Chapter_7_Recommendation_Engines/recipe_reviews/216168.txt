Wow!  These are really nice.  As the first to review the recipe I'm glad I could give it a high rating.  The flavor ends up being more cinnamon than chocolate, because the Mexican chocolate is spiced with cinnamon.  The dough was really easy to mix, and in the baking process the cookies don't spread much, which means they can be baked in bigger batches.  The baking time is right on - since I live at a higher altitude, 12 minutes was perfect.  For those who are not familiar with Mexican chocolate, it comes in a hexagonal box with four round, scored blocks of chocolate.  I've found it in my local supermarket in the Mexican food section, and also at Amazon.com.  My husband and I are both really pleased with these cookies.  They are filling the house with a wonderful aroma as I write.  Thanks for a great recipe.  This is a keeper.

Thumbs up from everyone who tried one.  These bake up much lighter than my usual oatmeal cookie recipe, which we liked.  The Mexican chocolate and cinnamon flavors are subtle and well blended.  I cut the brown sugar back to 3/4 cup and the white sugar back to 1/4 cup and we thought they were sweet enough.  I got 48 nice size cookies and 11 minutes seemed to be the right baking time in my oven  Thanks, Swooda these will become part of my cookie repertoire.

Yummy!!! I used cinnamon chocolate chips as that's what I had on hand and because they were cinnamon chips I didn't add the cinnamon, I might next time though. Thanks for the recipe will make these again.

I had the Mexican chocolate and the oats in my cupboard and a new Ninja Blender to try out, so I decided to give these a try. We really enjoyed them. They have a very delicate, but perfect balance of chocolate and cinnimon. I considered adding cinnamon chips, but I'm glad I didn't. They don't need a thing! The texture is better than most oatmeal cookies, probably due to the use of the blender to cut the oats up in smaller pieces. I used my medium size scoop for the dough and it made exactly three dozen 2 1/2 inch coocies. We give this recipe two thumbs up!

These cookies bake up beautifully and taste great!  I used 2tsp of cinnamon which was the perfect compliment to the bar of Mexican chocolate.  And I agree with others, 12 minutes to bake is perfect.  This will be a recipe we use regularly.  Thanks Swooda!

These cookies were yummy and baked up very nicely, but had much more cinnamon flavor than I expected, especially considering that I only used 1 tsp. instead of the 2 called for. Next time I try these I plan to only pulse the chocolate until it is the size of chocolate chips.  My only real complaint with the recipe is that it doesn't state a precise measurement for the chocolate, but I used about 3.5 oz. of a bar of Ibarra Mexican Chocolate and it seemed to be about the right amount.

I placed a heart shaped red hot in the center of each after they came out of the oven. Yummy.  I also made sure to roll each into a ball so they baked up nicely.

amazing, these are so good and i was able to get 4 dozen easy out of this recipe using a small ice cream scooper. They were easy to make. If you like cinnamon you have to make these cookies.

I baked these cookies today, and I really wanted to like them. My husband and I agree they are OK. The cinnamon taste comes through, but that is really all.  Admittedly I used cocoa, 6  Tb. and a couple drops of almond extract, along with 3 tsp. of cinnamon since I wasn't using Mexican chocolate.  I was a bit stumped on the quantity of cocoa since the Mexican chocolate quantity wasn't specific. The dough was very heavy. I flattened the cookies after they were on the cookie sheet, so they flattened a bit. Without the flattening they just rose without spreading really at all. I won't make them again.

Only had to substitute 3 Tbsp. Cocoa for the Mexican chocolate.
