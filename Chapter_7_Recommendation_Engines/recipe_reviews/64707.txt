This is one of the best soups I've ever tasted.  I made it for my girlfriend several months ago and she fell in love with it.  Since then we've made it for our friends and they also fell in love.  The only thing I leave out is the Worcestershire sauce and I don't miss it for one second!  I do add a few jalepenos and some crushed red pepper...I like it hot!!!

i made this recipe with thin sliced Boca Italian Sausage instead of the Smoked, it's some of the best soup I've made at home and it was simple and quick to make. I actually left out the worchestershire (sp?) sauce and hot sauce and just added a little salt and pepper to season. This soup is filling, simple to make, and scrumtralescent!

Not impressed.  I love boca sausages cooked on the stove top, but did not enjoy it in this soup.  Would be better without the sausage.
