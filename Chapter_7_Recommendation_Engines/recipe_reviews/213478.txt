Awesome recipe! My entire family loved it and none of them besides me loves Marmite. Excellent recipe and works great with substitutes like ground beef or cabbage.

I had never had Marmite before, but picked up a jar last month and was looking for a recipe to try it in before I tried it on toast. This was excellent. It added a nice yeasty tang to the dish that I really liked..
