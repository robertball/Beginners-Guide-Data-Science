This was really good. I made a half recipe since there are just two of us. I used yellow hominy since that is what I had growing up. I used about 1/3 of a small can of green chilies. This was a winner. I made this with the baked Sicilian chicken, asparagus. I made a sauce for the asparagus from white wine, butter, black pepper and 2 garlic cloves.

I love hominy and this was a tasty recipe to have it.  I did drain the hominy and there still was a lot of  liquid after baking that I drained off Might be better to make a cheese sauce with a bit of flour and then bake it all together
