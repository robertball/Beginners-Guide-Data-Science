yum yum yum!  made almost exactly to the recipe and was very good.  The only change I made was to saute the vegies in water instead of butter in order to reduce the fat and calories.  I also used evaporated fat free milk instead of heavy cream.  def a keeper, thanks for sharking

VERY good! I doubled the recipe because it said it made four servings.  SERIOUSLY?  How big are those servings?  I have SO much soup left over.  It's very rich also so I recommend just a light salad and maybe rolls with this meal!  I did add some instant potatoes to thicken but otherwise I stuck to the recipe and my family loved it! The cayenne definitely added a kick.  I added about 1/2 tsp. since it didn't say how much.

I made this with very few modifications and it turned out superb. I used my own homemade chicken stock and ham stock which I had leftover in the freezer. I used a little less flour just because 1/4 looked like too much. I didn't have any heavy cream but half and half seemed to work just fine. I didn't add any cayenne pepper because my toddlers aren't big on spicy just yet. I did a few drops of Franks RedHot (a cayenne pepper sauce) to my bowl however. I'll be making this comfort food regularly.

This was soooo good! I had leftover Easter ham that I wanted to start to use up, and im so glad I found this recipe. 
One change I made based on what I had on hand was that I used 2 cans of potatoes. 
I also used a can of corn instead of carrots, based on preference. 
I will be making this again! I dont always have ham on hand, so next time I make this, I will be trying it with kielbasa. 
Thanks for the recipe!! :)

I've made this recipe a few times now, and whereas I may add some extra seasonings and/or veggies, the basic recipe is fabulous! I usually have to make double if I want any for lunch the next day! Oh, and use the amount of flour called for if you're looking for something thicker than broth-based soup soup, it's a perfect ratio!

I'm what you'd consider a non-cook.   If it has more than 2 steps I'm usually lost.  The first time I made this recipe I followed the video recipe for it (found on this site and on Food Wishes).  I was so pleasantly surprised when the soup came out exactly as I thought it should.  I now make it every week or two and I am as happy with it now as I was back then.  Creamy and flavorful without being overpowering, it's everything I look for in a comfort food.   I do leave out the cayenne now, though it's tasty either way.  That's just my personal preference.  Don't miss the video. There's nothing like Chef John's good humor to make you smile while you cook.

We eat a lot of soup because it's the perfect way to camoflauge vegetables for my picky husband. He devoured this recipe. I did make some changes for a soup we'd be more accustomed to eating. First, I used chicken broth in place of the water, added another 1/2 pound of potatoes for a thicker soup, and added other herbs/spices such as parsley, paprika, onion powder, and just a tad of chopped jalapenos. (Hey it's TX, we live spicy) ;) great soup and a delicious meal!

This is so easy and a perfect way to use up the leftover Easter ham.  I made a few revisions..used all chicken stock (low sodium) and no water and substituted fat free half and half for the heavy cream.  Also, I didn't have any fresh chives, so I added dehydrated chives to the soup (approx. 1 tbsp) the last 15minutes of cooking.  My family loved it and my husband said it was one of his favorite soups I make (and I make a lot of soup)!

Simply perfect for those cold days (I'm in South Africa, it's winter here). Doubled the recipe, but, thanks to everyone going for second helpings the pot was empty by the end of the day! Keeper, no changes needed.

I made this with leftover Easter ham and didn't even need to use the bone which I had given to my sister. It was great. Wasn't sure how many potatoes to use so I used 4 medium sized ones. I also used the water I had the potatoes soaking in for the water(I know it makes gravy better, so I thought it would flavor & thicken the soup a bit). I didn't have cayenne, so I used a bit of homegrown Serrano pepper flakes. I also didn't have cream, so I used milk and threw in a few handfuls of grated cheddar cheese. This will be a recipe I make again.

This soup was so delicious!!  My teenage boys fought over the last bowl.  I used a whole ham steak from the grocery store and the extra ham was great and made it a meal.

I made this using leftover Easter ham, and would warn folks to be careful not to use the parts heavily glazed. It's like adding a few tablespoons of sugar to the soup. This is a good recipe and I'll definitely make it again.

Add this one to your soup repertoire because it’s super delicious, easy to make, and so comforting on a cool evening. Oh, and only one stockpot to clean. Made exactly as written other than adding a ham hock (discarded after cooking) and replacing salt & pepper with 1/4 teaspoon Sazón seasoning. Added the optional cayenne pepper but omitted the optional chives for garnish. The flavors are so good that this could be converted to a great ham & bean soup by subbing white beans for the potatoes. Superb recipe, Chef John.

This is by far the best soup I've ever made!  It reminds me of my mother's potato soup, but much more flavor (sorry mom)!  Will definitely make this again and again!

This soup is like being wrapped in a blanket on a cold winters night!!!
I follow the recipe as is, with ony a slight change or two.  Being from MN/WI, everything is better with cheese!!!! I usually add a cup or so of shredded sharp cheddar or for a smokier taste with a bland ham I've used smoked gouda. Also, I love thicker soups (the kind you can mop up with bread) so as the soup 
bubbles on the stove, I take out a cup or so and let it
 cool slightly. I then puree it in the blender until 
smooth and then return it to the pot and incorporate it back in.  This really releases the starch and thickens it up nicely.  **I usually do the last step with any of my cream-based or thicker soups.**

Both my husband and I very much enjoyed this soup. Using a good chicken broth (I used homemade and even used broth were water was called for) and a good smoked ham are key. We however prefer a thicker chunkier soup. Next time I will use more potato and more ham. We add cream per individual serving per individual's taste as well as the cayenne. Flavor is fabulous and it is also very easy to make. I used several spoonfuls of instant mashed potato flakes to increase the thickness this time but am hoping next time with more potatoes not to have to do this.

just the "RIGHT AMOUNT" of garlic and spices.   Perfect. ! !  Cooking it with chicken broth and the cream made it so tasty. Just for the last few minutes, I added whipping cream just until warm, then 1/4 c.of sour cream.   Such a great taste.  I have made it both ways. You just can't go wrong. We have this at least 2 to 3 times a month.  I have also added chopped bacon.

This was a very easy & VERY GOOD recipe.  Had some left over Easter ham cause how much ham can one really eat?  Anyway, followed the recipe but added 2 more carrots & 2 more ribs of celery to amp up the veggies.  I also subbed more chicken stock/broth for the water.  I will be making this one again!

Excellent. I followed the recipe exactly and the soup had a really delicious flavor with just a hint of creaminess. I am not a big fan of creamed soups so, this was a winner for me. I used a one pound ham steak and there was plenty of meat to go around. I think the cayenne pepper is pretty key in this soup, I wouldn't leave it out.

Excellent! I have made this recipe 4 times over the past 3 months and have enjoyed every cup or bowl. It's easy to make and takes minimal time to prepare. Please be advised the Cayenne Pepper is essential. Should you not like spicy soup use 1/4 teaspoon, those more adventurous 1/2 is recommended. Don MacLean

This recipe is the bomb.com. My girlfriend and even my kids loved it. She says it's even better than her mom's but will NEVER admit she said it lol. The only thing that I really changed was instead of smoke ham I used bacon. I just fried it up in about 1/4" chunks and then added it to my stock pot. I also added some corn as well just to make it a little heavier as a meal. I am actually making it again tonight because both of my kids chose this meal over PIZZA! This is not a misprint, they actually chose it over PIZZA. That should say it all about this recipe.

I mostly did this recipe as written but omitted the water and added ham with the potatoes in step 3. Even so...after mashing a few times...still fairly thin soup. So, I quickly cooked 3 more smallish peeled Idaho potatoes (cubed small) and added those in. Much better! I like more potatoes and less liquid. I did add a few more herbs/spices I wanted and did use your normal baking type potatoes. Personally, I don't feel the water is necessary and make a couple more potatoes then called for. Good base but for me, it needed to be less thin and more chunks of potato. Thanks CJ for the good start! I forgot, I did add around 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar and really liked that addition. :)

I tried this before it was published...my Dec. 2011 review: Excellent soup, even better the second day. I did add more ham, celery and carrots than recipe, but still kept everything else the same. So just a bit chunkier. Used our leftover Christmas ham.

Disappointing!  This had a pretty good flavor, but it wasn't thick and creamy like I had hoped.   I followed the recipe exactly.  I did add a sprinkle of cayenne pepper and thought it added a nice little kick.

Love This Soup!!! Will be in our recipe box to make over and over. Followed the recipe except that we were about 3 oz. short on chicken broth, so made it up in beer! Added Pale Ale. Turned out awesome! Thanks so much!!!

Very good soup.  Made this for diner this evening using left over ham.  Came out very good.  I also threw in the ham bone while the soup cooked.  I doubled the recipe and substituted milk for the water called in the recipe.  Next time i will use a bit more potatoes and ham in the soup.

This is the first thing I've ever reviewed on here, but I've been using Chef John's recipes for a long time!!! This soup was so  good! I had 4 bowls of it for dinner, 2 for breakfast and the rest for lunch! I told my kids it came out too spicy and they wouldn't like it, just because I didn't want to share it! I'm a terrible person! The only thing I did differently was throw more onions, celery and carrots in it. Thank you chef John!

Simply delish! After a very long day at the grocery store, I dreaded the thought of fixing dinner & knew my tootsies were pretty much done in. Then I remembered I had saved Chef John's Ham & Potato Soup recipe. Saved is right! This was easy-peasy to prep, & within the hour, hubby & I were licking ours spoons! Served with a side of grilled cheese & beefy tomatoes sandwiches. Perfect ending to a not so perfect day! Thanks Chef John!

On this cold, wintery day in Ohio, this was truly a comfort soup. I doubled the recipe to freeze for another day. It is delicious and I changed nothing. Keep sending us your recipes Chef John, I have not tried any of your recipes to date that have been anything short of wonderful and dependable! Jenny in Ohio

This soup is so good, made just as Chef John did, except I added more celery and carrots. Was so easy to make and it makes a large pot of soup. I will freeze the left overs, because its just me and my husband.

I rarely review BUT this soup is excellent and needs to be shared as the go to recipe for Potato/Ham soup.  It was tasty the first night but just OUTSTANDING the next day.  It is perfect for post holiday ham and I followed the recipe fairly close and you can just tweek to your family's likes.  Can't go wrong, easy too!

I had left over ham from Easter dinner that I had cooked in a recipe from this site which included brown sugar. As i was making the soup and test tasting it I found the sweetness of the brown sugr just a tad overpowering so I added a tsp of dill weed (a family favorite) and a bay leaf.  It helped decrease the taste of the brow sugar and while the soup was simmering at the end I added a about a tsp of sherry wine vinegar to top things of.  My DH who rarely says much about his meals told it was one of the best soups I had ever made. I am going to try this again the way it is intended the next time with the smoked ham and see what he says.

Very good! Didn't have celery, so left that out and it was still delicious.  Also used a slow cooker to simmer over night after the initial pan work.  The color changed to orange rather than the creamy white, perhaps from the carrots and long simmering, but the flavor quite was very deep. Added the cream right before serving.

Not being fond of the potato soups I have tried in the past, I found myself with 200 lbs of spuds. I thought I might try my hand at soup, thinking it would freeze well. I tried several recipes, without being impressed, until I tried Chef John's. I have been making it by the gallon and have yet to freeze any.  
Everyone LOVED it. I used turkey ham in one batch and it was great!

I have made quite a few soups and have to admit that this wa an execellent one. I only made a minor change which was add an additional cup of chicken broth instead of one of the cups of water. Truly an excellent soup and will warm your tummy on a cool  autumn . day. Thanks Chef John....now to look for other soup recipes you have on here.

Didn't have quite enough potatoes, so instead of running to the store I used some left over french fries (chopped) and some leftover mashed potatoes. Didn't have to use as much flour, because of that. Made this on a rainy day with some cornbread and thumbs up all around. This is a good one for keeps

Most of the ham and potato soup recipes I found online had a 50/50 ratio of chicken broth and milk.  I hesitated to make Chef John's recipe because it is mostly chicken broth and water.  Not to worry!  The final product was thick and flavorful.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Note that I left out the celery because I didn't have any on hand and chose not to peel the potatoes.  Yum!

Delicious and perfect ratio of flour to butter. (I've never gotten this right before!) I did Chef John's recipe but added dried sage, more carrots and a can of black-eyed peas. It was wonderful and got rid of the Easter ham. Thanks, Chef John!

Chef John scores with another 5 gold star recipe with this one. I made it according to the  recipe, including the cayenne pepper. The whole family enjoyed it.

Tip: I use sea salt in almost all of my recipes for more flavor. I live at 6500 ft elevation and I had to simmer the potatoes for 25 minutes but that's what I'm used to and it isn't a big deal. In the video, Chef John didn't cut off the fat rind from the ham whereas I always have. I don't know why I do that when I make baked beans with raw bacon.

Chef John, thanks again for this recipe. I enjoy watching your cooking videos!

This is still in the pot finishing up...excellent soup.  I had to leave out the onion due to food allergies, added some crushed dehydrated green scallions during the initial cooking process.  Even with that change its a great soup...

This is an excellent (and simple) recipe with layers of flavor and a bit of french technique. Not a creamy  version but once you taste what browned butter and fresh ingredients produce you'll wonder why you haven't done this before. A solid recipe that can be built on with substitutions or additions (smoked Salmon Potato and Asparagus soup perhaps) Made this exactly as written and everyone went back for seconds. Makes plenty for four with leftover to lunch on later. This is a keeper. Be sure to brown the butter. Yum!

This is really good. I did change a couple things though to eliminate dairy and wheat. I used oil instead of butter. Eliminated the cream, and used 2 cups of rice milk mixed with 3 tablespoons of cornstarch to make a slurry instead of a floured roux. I added the milk/cornstarch slurry the last few minutes of cooking and it turned out great. I also added a handful of frozen peas at the end to give this some nice colour contrast and flavour. My kids also loved it which is a huge bonus!!

I made a small batch of this as written. It was too bland for me. The next batch I made, I caramelized the onions, ham, and potatoes before adding fresh chicken stock (no water!!!). Why on earth wouldn't you try to extract as much flavor from the ingredients?!? Mine turned out with a much better depth of flavor from just a few extra minutes work. There's no reason that soup can't be more than the sum of its ingredients. It's a perfectly adequate soup as written but I need more flavor in my soup. Thanks Chef John for a jumping off point. :o)

I thought this was very good. Aside from my scalloped potatoes with ham, I was trying to think of another way to use up my ham and this was perfect. I also added corn the next day. I will be making it again.

What is there to be said? It's delicious! Must admit that I used more (like twice) ham. And I was very free with the cayenne pepper. UMMM. Thank you, Chef John.

Very good soup. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream and it was still good. Didn't need any additional salt (as long as you don't use low-sodium chicken broth). Used leftover HoneyBaked Ham, so the soup was slightly sweet, which tasted good! I didn't use any celery either. Next time I make it I will reduce the water to 1-1/2 cups.

I swear this soup just cured a horrible cold I've been suffering with for four days!  

Best part about this is the simple ingredients, yet the taste is rich.  Not too filling like many potato soups, yet hearty enough to be a meal in itself.  I followed the recipe exactly, though doubled it so have plenty to freeze.  Thank you, "Chef John!"  Even the pickiest eaters in my household loved it.

Yummy!  This was so good!  I used regular baking potatoes, leftover ham, homemade chicken broth, and 2% milk instead of the cream.  I also mixed in some chopped parsley at the end, which gave it a nice little flash of color.  My husband and kids all enjoyed this soup.  Will definately be adding to my recipe box and making again!

5 STARS - definitely!! So much flavor! For me, the ham added to the flavor. But for the vegetarians in my family I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and left out the ham and they loved it!  My husband said I was getting to be a better soup maker!  Thanks to Chef John :)

This was incredible! I brought it to work and got rave reviews and even I LOVED IT - and I generally don't like soup. But following some basic rules (like how to make a rue, correctly!), it was thick, creamy and super tasty! Thank you Chef John ;)

This was delicious...I pretty much followed the recipe, but used red and yellow pepper because I did not have carrots. I also used half and half because I did not have heavy cream and it was fantastic. I also added asparagus...Yumm! This would be great after Easter!!!

My wife and I love this soup. I've made it several times with variations. I added smoked apple wood bacon to it and, wow! It was a huge hit. Then I poured a bowl and added 4 drops of black truffle oil and the earthiness that was added was over the top. As long as we were experimenting I poured a second bowl and put five drops of liquid smoke mesquite in it. Just saying, you need to try this.

Followed it for the most part but used crispy bacon, added a half cup of cheddar cheese and a tablespoon more of flour for a thicker soup. All in all it was great.

Delicious soup! I had a ham bone with yummy ham bits left on it from Christmas so I was looking for a ham soup recipe to cook with it. I had to make a few changes to use the bone- I started with  4 cups of water, 1/2 cups chopped celery, 1 cup chopped onion, 1/2 teaspoon thyme, salt and pepper, and a Bayleaf. I brought the water to a boil and let the hambone simmer for about an hour. I let it cool a little bit then pulled the meat off the bone.Then I basically jumped to step two of this recipe using my water instead of the chicken broth and adding the potatoes, etc.  I also added some shredded cheese right before serving, because we Wisconsinites love our cheese! Thanks for the creamy soup- it was perfect for a chilly January day!

Wow, this really turned out great. Followed recipe exactly except used half and half instead of heavy cream. The ratio of meat, potato, vegetable and broth was perfect. Did use a few chopped chives and 1/8 tsp of cayenne, which was plenty. Definitely will be making this again and again. Thanks for recipe.

You know as I went to add the cream I thought does it really need this? It didn't. The cream ruined this soup. Next time: NO CREAM it didn't need it! 
BTW also added a small bay leaf and a couple of cloves.
Probably would have been awesome senza the cream.

I made the soup exactly as directed and while it tastes good I found it to be too thin. Next time I would not add the water up front but add as needed after thickening.

Great recipe!  I used frozen hashbrown potatoes as a timesaver.  Very flavorful.  I highly recommend using the cayenne as recommended and then garnishing with a little cheddar and chives, but cheese really isn’t necessary for this full flavor soup.

This is an excellent tasting soup!  The family loved it.  Definitely added it to my favorites list.  I used ham that was leftover from Thanksgiving dinner.  My only modifications were adding a tab bit of corn starch to thicken it and sprinkling some grated cheddar cheese on top of each bowl full.  I made some garlic toast out of a loaf of French bread as a compliment.  Seemed to go perfect with it.  We'll be revisiting this one again soon!

I just finished slurping down a huge bowl of this and am floating in comfort food bliss.  It must be the sixth or seventh time that I've made this and I still follow the recipe to the T.  It's THAT good!  I like it thick, so I usually run the immersion blender a bit to finish it all off.  As dumb as it sounds, I've been waiting for it to get cold outside so that I can make this soup.   Please try this.  You will not regret it.  A nice big bowl of this soup with some good crusty bread...  A meal you won't soon forget.

This soup is good but I found some alterations that I feel improved the texture and taste. Use twice the amt of potatoes-combination of white and red, with a coupe of peeled russets. 
I added a half pkg of frozen petite peas, doubled the carrot and celery and used 12-14 ozs of ham.  Add the ham with the potatoes  and peas after cooking the stock and veggies for 15 min. Red pepper flakes is a must.

Probably the best potato soup that I have ever made.  Rather than mash the diced potatoes, I cooked 1/2 lb separately in 2 cups of the chicken broth.  I then pureed this in the Vitamix to create a thick base and added it in at the point when I added the remaining potatoes.  Additionally, spiced it using a few pinches of Paula Dean’s House Seasoning ( 1pt Salt, 1/2pt black pepper, 1/4pt garlic powder.)  Also, the cayenne is a must!

Delicious, like a few other s have written and say they like a thicker creamier soup, I'm the same, so I always add a cup or two of instant mashed potatoes....depending on how thick I want my soup, I use (Hungry Jack) potatoes I imagine any brand will work.....No need to prepare them, just toss them in, they will thicken the soup...

This is a excellent hearty soup. The only change I made was making a ham bone broth instead of the chicken broth. When we finish a ham with bone I usually make bean soup. This time I simmered the ham/bone in about 6 cups water about 1 1/2 hr. then remove ham from the bone. Then I followed Chef John's recipe. By the way, Yukon gold potatoes are the best even though it's noted any potato can be used. Yummy is right !

This is such a great recipe. It's easy, it's fun, and it tastes DELICIOUS! I'm a big soup guy and I even eat soup in the middle of August in Texas. I think the key is to get more hammy, and or smoky flavor is to get a hold of some real or smoked ham steaks. Using pre-packaged diced ham is nice and easy, but it really just adds little chewy cubes of meat. When you get a nice piece of ham, and cube it up it adds just a touch of hammyness/smokiness that really makes this dish. Even if you can't get a nice cut of ham, don't let that keep you from making this recipe! Do it even with the packaged ham it's worth it!

This is the best potato ham soup ever. The sprinkle of cayenne pepper really sets it off. I add that to my individual portion. I also made corn muffins with it. Yummm.

I did not use Cayenne pepper as my husband can't take the 'heat'. I don't think that amount he will taste it, but you know you have to please the hubby! My recipe is excellent so I am sure this one is just as good.

This was great!!  The only thing I did different was put in one cup of water instead of two.  Oh, and I didn't do the mash the soup step, mostly because I don't have a potato masher, but it didn't need to be done anyway because it was already thick & creamy.  We had it with a few slices of warm Asiago cheese bread.

Doubled recipe. Used up some nice thick smoked bacon. Added to soup and used drippings along with some butter to sauté vegtables.like some had noted my soup turned out a little "thin". To thicken it I heated up an individual serving until it was starting to boil. Took it off the heat and added some Idahoan brand instant mashed potatoes. I eye balled the amount stirred it added a little more stirred again and it was TERRIFIC. I am not sure how well the addition would freeze so I plan to add after I thaw a portion.

Yummy.  I added crispy shredded bacon and carrots and a few shrooms but otherwise totally followed recipe. BTW Chef John- how do you get an Art Major off your doorstep? Offer to pay for the Pizarro! Am not a smarty pants, just the mother of a San Francisco Sous Chef. When ever she is here (not very often as I an sure you know) and I yell for help she just walks in and says,  "Oh mom just do this, " turns and walks out.

This one is very good.  Also, that bit of information from JOHN, How to get rid of an art major.  Thanks. Loved it. I've been chuckling about that for the last 15 minutes, and probably will for the next several days.  Also, for those who would like it a little thicker, just add some instant  Potato buds or potato flakes.  This works very good, and it's a quick way to thicken your soup..

Made this today, just as Chef John says!  OH MY!!  Delicious, simple comfort food. I did not have cayanne to use. I doubled the amount of veggies and ham. Still used the 6 cups of liquid. It does make more than 4 servings.  I need to make soups more often.  Loved this.  Never added any salt due to chicken broth. I added rosemary and thyme for seasoning.  This truly a great soup you can add layers too.

This was nice and thick. I used 6 potatoes. However I felt like I spent a lot of time at the stove.  Next time I think I'll try the slow cooker recipe on site.

I made this today for the first time ever (I've never made soup before besides from a can), and my hubby loved it.  I know a meal is a hit when he keeps complimenting it for an hour or two after he's done eating.  That happened today.  I did not put any celery or milk in it because I didn't have either, but my hubby agreed celery would be a nice touch in it.  The milk is not needed, though.  I am only giving this four stars because this isn't a recipe that blew us over, but it is very good and will be added to my rotation of "now and then" foods.

WIth our leftover Easter ham, I tried this recipe.  My husband and children loved it!  I probably put more celery and onion than listed, but otherwise stuck with the recipe.  My family isn't big on soups, but they asked for seconds and to have this soup again.  Simple, easy, and filling.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks Chef John!

This was a terrific recipe, and I found the video helpful.  Chef John is a great teacher and entertaining to boot.  I mistakenly added only 1/2 the suggest butter and cream and still the soup was rich and satisfying.  Thanks Chef John!

The first few times I made this recipe, I did it by the book (minus the cayenne). With each time after I started just tossing in amounts that seemed right/better to my preference. The second to last time I made it I added red pepper flakes as a substitution to cayenne because then I didn't have to buy another spice. 

This last time though, I went all out. I added a lot of extra ham, steamed a head of cauliflower prior and used half of it - diced small - added half a bag of frozen corn and pease each. and technically added extra potato (russets) but less than I normally do to make up for the cauliflower addition. I didn't have any cream or half and half today, so just through in like a cup of milk... I don't know, I just poured it from the gallon. And of course pepper flakes/cayenne.

This soup, no matter what I do to it, turns out amazingly, and never wrong, and I always have multiple bowls of it a day! This is a keeper!

This is a great soup. I followed Chef John's recipe adding fresh, large chunks of cauliflower when I added the potatoes. A bowl is a meal. Hearty. The touch of cayenne, which I normally skip in recipes, was perfect.

Added more ham than the recipe stated.  I also added a bouillon cube for extra flavor, so very little salt was needed.  My family absolutely loved it.  Adding it to our favorites!

Wonderful soup!  I added the potatoes with the broth and let it simmer slowly for about an hour or so - very easy! It was nice and thick when I served it.  I used potato flour since I have a child with a wheat allergy and waited to add the cream to individual bowls when serving because I have another child with a mild dairy allergy.  The rest of us tried it both with the cream added and without and found only a slight difference in the richness of the soup (just fyi: the kids thought it was a bigger difference than the adults did and much preferred without the cream added.) Overall, though, it got thumbs up from the whole family and will definitely go into the recipe box for making again.

This was absolutely FANTASTIC!  I made a pot for our office lunch and everyone wanted the recipe.  The only difference I did was to use a ham bone I had in the freezer, along with leftover ham from Christmas.  I simmered that for a couple hours in the broth, then followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I could not get enough of this.

Best soup ever.  I used low sodium broth and half & half instead of heavy cream.  I also only had Russet potatoes at home and they were just fine.  The potatoes ended up taking closer to 25 minutes to cook.  I'd plan for longer cooking time than the suggested 40 minutes.

Yum!  Did not add the cream - just mashed up the potato a little more.  Also doubled the carrots & celery.  Used about 8-10 yukon gold potatoes.  Topped with a little shredded cheddar cheese.  A new family favorite!

The flavor of this is very, very good. It was a bit thinner than I would have liked and I used less water than the recipe called for. I should say that I served this as the main course for dinner so I wanted it hearty. I will make it again but I will use more potatoes and mash them to make a thicker, heartier meal. Be sure to taste before adding salt. With the ham and the chicken broth, I didn't need to add any.

I used all the ingredients but used russet potatoes. I put in double the carrots and celery (we can always use more veggies). The base to this recipe is awesome! If you at all know how to cook and just toss things together like I do(don't measure things to the T), you'll have no issues with making it how you like it. Not only is this recipe simple, fast and delicious...your picky kids will like it. My daughter doesn't like cooked celery, carrots, or ham but she ate this soup right up! My husband loved it as well. All in all, this is on my favorites list of quick and easy recipes!

This was the best soup I've ever made!  So flavorful.  I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly.  It doesn't end up like a thick creamy soup, but it is packed with flavor.  If you want it creamier I would add a few more potatoes.  I used about 8 russet potatoes, but I might use around 10-11 next time.  I added some ritz crackers to it and it thickened up real quick!

Wasn't as thick as I would have liked, but next time I will just add more potatoes. Mashing the potatoes in the soup left it with an excellent texture. The soup was gone within minutes of serving.

This soup was absolutely wonderful and enjoyed by my whole family. The cayenne adds a wonderful little kick to it.
 Will definitely make it again.

This was really good!  I followed the directions, just doubled them for my family of six.  Also, used half and half instead of heavy cream.  Served it with shredded cheddar cheeses and croutons like they do at our local steakhouse.  It was great!

I had a ham bone with meat on it leftover, so used it to make a stock with onions, garlic, carrots and celery.  Used a can of chicken broth with the butter/flour and the stock for the remaining liquid.  Also had 3/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar I tossed in.  Wonderful!

This is really good soup.  I put ham hocks in my pressure cooker for 40 minutes.  Made the soup while they were cooking.  Then stripped the hocks of all their smokey meat.  A hearty soup that fills the tummy.

Wow did this hit the spot!!! We had a smoked butt ham the other day and I wanted to use up all the small pieces left. Followed the recipe exactly, flavor of the smoked ham bits and cayenne (just a pinch) was perfect.

Made it when it was 85F, a front rolled in, temp dropped to 60F. Never seen a happier bunch of potato soup eaters. Easy to make, simple, no brainer, I don't measure exactly, but it turned out fabulous anyway. Held off on the chili, kids involved, added my own cholula sauce, which took it from delicious to "out of this world". Thank you Chef John!

This was enjoyed last night. Turned out great -- I followed the recipe except I did not have cream so I used skim milk in place of water and whole milk in place of cream. Probably added a bit more skim than 2 cups ----   used about 12oz of ham and 3 pounds of potatoes. Tasted great with fresh cilantro added

Very good. One of my family members doesn't like creamy soups, so a little bit of cream can be mixed in to the individual bowls of those who do.

Really easy and really tasty. The only change I made was to replace the splash of cream at the end with a splash of buttermilk. It reduced the fat and the tangy taste  of the buttermilk was very complimentary to the potato flavour. I will use this recipe frequently.

Maybe go light on the cayenne pepper. I used 1/2 TSP. I would probably only use 1/4 TSP to make sure other wonderful delicate flavors are not diminished.

I loved this soup.  It’s way more than the sum of its parts.  The flavors are well balanced and it goes wonderfully with a crisp green salad.  We have this at least once a month and the family is happy to see it on the menu every time.

Followed the recipe to the T except, I didn't add the heavy cream. The soup consistency was perfect as is. Loved it and will make it again!!

This was excellent.  I used 6 regular sized potatoes (diced) and had two leftover baked potatoes that I added to it to thicken it up even a little more.  Used 2 celery stalks and 2 large carrots but everything else was kept the same on this recipe - everyone liked it!

Used 2 cups half 'n half so reduced water.  Didn't have cayenne pepper so used paprika.  Very tasty and delicious.

excllent.  i actually made this about a year ago andwas cleaning out my freezer and found some frozen.  then i remembered how good it was (we dont freeze bad recipes) so i made it again, even my fussy teen son liked it.  i added some extra potatoes and ham and i doubled broth.  i didnt have chichen broth so i used turkey broth.

It's worth mentioning that this makes 4 generous servings.  Not knowing this, I changed the servings to 6, just to be safe.  I'm thrilled to report that I have tons of leftovers.  This soup is perfect!  Absolutely delicious, and very filling.  I never deviate from any of Chef John's recipes, because it's never necessary.  The only thing I did differently with this one was to add a large sprig of fresh thyme to the boiling soup, simply because I had it, and it was about to go bad soon, and why not.  This recipe will forever go hand in hand with every ham dinner I ever make.

I made this for dinner and Wow! my wife was just in "heaven" with each spoonful.  The smokiness of the leftover ham adds an entirely different flavor profile. I didn't need to add much salt (brine of the ham) was just enough. This is definitely a keeper for those cold winter evenings. I didn't alter the recipe at all...to me it's just perfect!

Absolutely delightful soup! I did forget the celery, and substitute coconut cream for the heavy cream - it was still perfectly delicious despite the modification for our low-dairy needs.

This was easy and delicious!  I omitted the celery and cayenne pepper (a toddler was eating) and used milk + cornstarch as a substitute for cream.  The also used beef broth.  The soup was flavorful and had just the right thickness through the cornstarch.  It also tasted good the next day.  When I was packing up the leftovers, I added in much more ham (I pulled it from a full cooked ham - not smoked) and through in some frozen corn as well.  The corn was very complimentary and I'll add it next time from the get-go.  Recommended for all soup lovers!

So, my experience with making soups is heating up Campbells Creamy Tomato in the microwave. Decided tonight to surprise sweetie with a meal once she got home. This was outstanding! A few notes: first watch the video and learn about roux. Second, I didn't bother with peeling the potatoes because it was safer for me. Otherwise followed the directions precisely and it was as advertised. Third, probably the most important step was to use the potato masher at the end, it was daunting to contemplate, but eezy-peezy and it made the consistency perfectly smooth and creamy. Finally, season to taste. It's inferred in the recipe, but take the time to figure it out.

Thanksgiving Leftovers - I made this soup substituting 8 oz of leftover smoked turkey and 1 1/2 pounds of mashed potatoes. It was a delicious way to use up some of those Thanksgiving Day leftovers.  1 batch was approx 7 cups of soup. It was gone in a flash!! Thanks for the yummy recipe. :D

Comfort food was the order of the day. This wonderful soup fit the bill. Full of enticing aromas, bold flavor, and a balance of all those things we love on a cold winter-ish evening. Spend the time, and enjoy the enhancement of a great soup.

This is truly a five star recipe and it is really in the technique.  I’ve made potato soup before with the same ingredients but  never with the same delicious result. Something about the steps and the layering of flavors makes all the difference, so don’t try to rush it. Take your time and follow the recipe. You won’t regret it!

I have made this soup many times just as directed.  My husband and I can not stop eating it.  I have to double the recipe so it can last longer than one day. I could make this by memory but Chef John is so funny that I love to watch the video while making it.

OMG. Rich and creamy. Do yourself a favor and salt and pepper at the end. Taste. Then add Cyan. The cyan is just right for this.  1/2 tsp does a lot.
   I added a sprinkle of dill weed. Thank you for this recipe.

Exactly as written, except I added 1/3 cup of a good Chardonnay wine when sautéing the vegetables, let that reduce before adding the flour, and 1/3 cup of New Mexico green chili , chopped, with the potatoes.  Crazy good! Not too rich, and very satisfying! Warms the soul!  Thanks Chef John!

I will definitely make this again.  I made it exactly as written with no changes.  I served it with a green salad and toasted french bread.  My husband loved it too.  This one's a keeper!

Excellent flavor. I can’t figure out where all the flavor came from because the ingredients are simple. Use the best ham you can find.

This is one of the BEST Ham and Potato Soups I have ever had!  I made it as written with one small exception;   I boiled a ham hock in the chicken broth for one hour prior to following the rest of the recipe as written.    I did add just a pinch of the  cayenne pepper and it brought this soup to the next level!    Thank you for sharing!

Tasty soup recipe and a great use of all that leftover ham after a holiday dinner. The ham makes it plenty salty, so I recommend skipping the added salt and use low sodium broth.

I love a good soup especially on a chilly, wet Spring day.  I had leftover ham from Easter Sunday and all the other ingredients so I pretty much followed this recipe just as Chef John presented it, complete with the cayenne and black pepper.  This turned out to be a wonderful soup, you'd have to be completely absent upstairs to bungle it.  I'm sending this out to my grand daughter, she's out in the world now on her own and is a newbie cook who doesn't like complicated dishes, this is perfect!  Plus, I sent her a ham for Easter too, so I'm sure she has all the ingredients.  This is so much better than all that canned stuff!

My husband says this is the best soup ever! I don't eat meat but I tasted the broth to check the spices and it was fantastic. The cayenne pepper is essential and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne was just right for our tastes.  I had a ham bone leftover from an Easter ham, and simmered the bone in a can of chicken broth plus the 2 cups water for about three hours, then strained it and used for 3 cups of the liquid. I used chicken broth for the rest of the liquid. If I don't have a ham bone next time, I'll use all chicken broth for the liquid. Also, I used 2 cans of Non-GMO diced potatoes instead of fresh potatoes, adding them during the last 5 minutes of cooking, and followed the directions for mashing some of them. The soup turned out fantastic!  I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This was okay...just a basic fast soup. I think John might have made it simpler for the person "on the go".  I had to ad some flavour and something extra to thicken it more.  I find that pot or pearl barley is highly underrated in today's recipes.  They add a nice flavour, texture and thicken soup broths very well. I also added I tsp of mustard (an old Grandma secret).  One could even add a can of mushroom soup and bacon bits.

Wow! Really good! I made a double batch for a family of 5, so just doubled all the ingredients except the extra water and cream at the end. Stayed nice and thick, and plenty for leftovers.

This was delicious!  I changed it up a bit so my son, who just got braces, could eat it.  It was good to hide the onions and celery from him anyway!  After cooking the vegetables, I put them all in the blender with 1 cup of broth and blended until smooth, then put back in the pot and did the rest as directed.

Delicious!  Used ham bone broth, no additional salt needed for us, other than that made as directed. 1/2 tsp of cayenne was a great subtle kick in flavor, really sets this apart. Will be making again, soon.

I added a ham hock to the broth, and used 6 quarts of chicken bone broth.  Also found out that a little cayenne pepper goes a long way!  Perfect main course - very hearty and filling.  Delicious!

Awesome recipe! Living in Louisiana, I added more cayenne & we do love our garlic. ?? Instead of a heavy cream, I used cream cheese - 1st time trying that but one of the local country cooks here recommded it. Love! ?? And of course, used 5# of the golden Yukon potatoes - didn't peel - their skin is thin enough that you don't have to & provides more nutrients. When I cook I make a lot to share & freeze. This will be my 'go to' recipe for potato soup from now on.

I substituted frozen cut up veggies for those indicated in the recipe and instead of heavy cream used a mixture of milk and cornstarch.  It was great my family thought so as well.

Fantastic! I made exactly to recipe, and it was wonderful. Great balance of flavors and textures! (One thing: I don't own a potato masher, so I used a slotted spoon to scoop out potatoes and pureed them in the food processor. After heating and stirring a few minutes, they blended back in really well.)

Made exactly as listed-it was awesome on a cold rainy night! The added bit of cayenne at the end gives it a little kick. I just printed it out to save to my recipe favorites!! Will make again for sure.

I used chicken stock instead of broth and used more of it. Additional salt and pepper to taste. It was delicious!

Very good - but I saw things that need improvement with this recipe. Recommend to add 1 tsp fresh diced thyme, 2 bay leaves, 2 carrots (instead of 1), 3 stalks of celery (instead of 1), 5 large potatoes, 1 cup of soaked split peas, do not add water, use 1800ml chicken stock (which is exactly 2 Canadian 900ml sized containers - with no wastage). Whip cream works well. Would make again using the aforementioned. Serve with sharp cheddar on top and perhaps a dollop of sour cream. I also think some crush tortilla chips would go well.

Our family really enjoyed this delicious soup so much that we plan to make it regularly and even freeze some for crock-pot nights.  We add a little more pepper and garlic. 

We are making it again. right now!!!

SIMPLY AMAZING! !   Wanted some comfort food in the aftermath of snowstorm "Harper"  and had some leftover ham.  This ham and potato soup is the best I've ever had!  I'm glad that I doubled up on the recipe, because my family devoured it.  Thank you Chef John!!

My 8 year old daughter loved it! I substituted onion powder because I didn't have an onion.  I added a cup of water,  more carrots, ham and 1 Tbs of butter.  For spices I added several shakes of Paprika and McCormick Cajun seasoning. It's is relatively easy to have older kids/teens to help peal potatoes & dice the ham.

Whenever I look for a recipe and see Chef John's name attached, I read it, and more often than not, make it. I followed the recipe nearly exactly. Added an additional rib of celery, and a little more carrot.  Probably not the amount of potato called for.   Didn't have cream on hand so did the substitute, milk and melted butter. The " serves 4" served the 2 of us for dinner!  My Hawaiian raised Husband said " broke da mouth"!! That's good. Will definitely make again'

I'll start by saying that you'll never go wrong with a Chef John recipe, but this one won over my uber-picky 10 year old.  She rarely asks for seconds (and usually doesn't finish the firsts) , but tonight said, "mom, this soup is great!".  When I asked if she wanted more she said , "definitely".  I told her I'd review and if she wanted to give 5 stars and she said 10 stars and also that I need to look up more "John recipes".  I watched the video (always amusing and helpful tips) and followed recipe with maybe a bit more celery/carrot and ham and maybe a bit less flour.  I had 1/2 and 1/2 and used that .  Will have to make again b/c my daughter has only about 4 meals that she loves .  Thanks CJ!

I have food allergies so I adapted the recipe. I used grass fed ghee instead of butter, ultra fine rice flour instead of flour, sweet potatoes (light flesh- not yams) instead of potatoes and full fat coconut milk instead of cream. I did not add the water based on comments. This soup was great!

I followed the recipe with one change.  I didn't have fresh chives, and added dried chives to the soup before I mashed the potatoes.  I used white potatoes.  I loved it!!! I will always use this recipe for potato soup.  Thank you, Chef John, you always come through with the best recipes.

My grandson choose this over most of my specialties even taco salad. I have made it at least once a month and more often if the Grand's are coming. 
I will be making it for our family Christmas on the 29th of December. 
Wonderful, flavorful, definitely a keeper.

Omg!  Delicious!  I didn't have heavy cream, so I used 1/2 cup milk with 1 TBSP cornstarch (whisked).   I should have made a double batch...it's almost gone!

This soup was delicious! I know that reviewers get all kinds of upset when someone rates a recipe after they’ve changed it, but you have to use recipes as a “base” to build on. With that said here is what I changed... First off, I’m a vegetarian so use “faux” ham broth/base along with vegetarian ham. I used 2 whole onions and at 6 cloves of garlic. I did make a triple batch of this soup so that required far more onion & garlic than the recipe stated, along with more potatoes. Also, my husband doesn’t do well with half & half or heavy cream so I used cream cheese. Some people like a milder soup and some people like a spicer soup. I’m from Texas so I like things spicier. I added cayenne for a little extra zip. Using this recipe as a “base suggestion” yielded an amazing tasty soup that everyone I gave some to LOVED. I followed the recipe, with the exception of a few things, and it turned out awesome. I HIGHLY recommend it. Anything that Chef John makes is amazing! Thank you, Chef John for this awesome recipe! Keep them coming!

Delicious and satisfying. Made it almost exactly by the printed recipe, except for a cup or so of instant mashed potatoes for thickening, and a cup or so of grated cheese in place of the cream.  Easy to make after you get everything diced up. Recommended, literally--I told several friends about it.

I made this soup thinking it would last me a couple of days. This  is so good my husband ate it too! Only difference I made was used the broth from the ham bone instead of chicken broth and no water. I will be making this again.

Like Chef John said "You can use any potato you want." So I used some new potatoes I had sitting around. The recipe worked out fine. Very tasty and easy enough to assemble.

OHHH BOY!!!! this is by far the best soup I have ever made. Thank you so much for not only the best ingredients , but sharing the proper technique as well. I didn't have any celery so I added ground celery seed. I did the same with the garlic.  I will make this over and over again....

Love the recipe. Very easy to make. Instead of partially mashing the potatoes for thickness I added instant potatoes to thicken. I also had a ham bone and made my own stock. Very delicious!

This soup was exceptional.  I followed the recipe as directed, but it had a weak taste, so I added the ham bone used to cut  the ham for the soup and OMG it  was tasty as ever.    Served with Italian bread.  Definitely will made again.

OMG, this is beyond delicious. Changes I made was; 2 carrots, 3 celery sticks & I used 40,000HU Cayenne pepper 1/4tsp.....that's all. I followed the recipe all the way & it was so amazing delicious. Will def. be making this soup again. Wow. Oh....I did add in some chopped kale at the end, which did not affect the flavor at all. But it added some nice color.

This was wonderful.  The only change I made was omit the cayenne, and I added just a small amount of cheese.  It had wonderful potato flavor. This is my new go to recipe for potato soup.

I used a left over smoked ham that was pretty salty, so I didn't  add any additional salt to the recipe.  I did add some diced squash in place of some of the potatoes.  The cayenne added a nice little kick to it.   I will definitely make this again.

I cooked the vegetables, ham and broth in crockpot on low while I was at work.  When I got home I mashed the potatoes a bit and made the roux (thickener).  I whisked in the roux a bit at a time to the broth mixture in the crockpot.  I let it cook again for about 1 hour.  It was delicious.

This was a great way to use leftovers from our Easter meal. I used chicken stock instead of chicken broth, and the outcome was great! I will definitely make this again.

One of the best soups ever! I get a thick slice of ham from the deli then cut it up. I use 1/2 & 1/2,instead of heavy cream. It is still nice and creamy. One of our favorites!

Good soup, I will make it again. Only change I made was instead of 4 cups chicken broth I heated up 4 cups of water and used 1 tsp vegetable base, 1 tsp ham base and 2 tsp chicken base. I also used 2 smoked ham hocks which I removed after soup was done.

Well first of all it's Chef John! and can't go wrong with him and the 525 5 star reviews.  As far as my son and sister it's the best soup I ever made and they are right about that!  Followed recipe except didn't have the chives.  You are the man Chef John!

Part of the reason this soup was a winner is because I had read the reviews about it having a thinner-than-desired consistency.  With that in mind, I added 2 more carrots and 2 more celery sticks on the front end and added closer to 2# of potatoes.  During the final stages of simmering, I left the lid off so some of the liquid could evaporate.  All of this made a medium consistency, which is what my household prefers for this genre of soup.  I never want a soup that is overly thick.  Another reason it was so good was that for about 1/3 of the total amount of the broth, I had mixed in some homemade ham bone  broth along with some chicken broth.  Wow--what flavor!  I will be keeping this recipe and continue to make the changes as I did the first time.  Without these changes, it would only have been a 3-star recipe.

This was the BEST! I used slices left from a brown sugar ham and diced them. Soup is easy to make and so tasty. The texture is perfect. I took it to work and everyone commented on how good it smelled and looked. I ended up bringing a bunch the next day to sample- it was a big hit!

I rate the recipe 4 stars as is. I made a couple minor changes, instead of water I used chicken broth, I added 2 carrots and 2 ribs of celery and rather than mash the potatoes I added 3/4 of potato flakes. This is a very easy recipe to make or tweak it to your tastes, will make again!

This is an excellent recipe, easy to prepare and uses pretty standard pantry items.  I followed the recipe exactly, however, found that the chicken broth flavor overpowered the ham. The soup was still very good, but next time I'll either use water instead of the chicken broth or use a meat with a more robust flavor such as andouille, bacon, a spicy smoked sausage or perhaps just more ham than the recipe called for so the chicken flavor won't be the predominant meat flavor.  

For those who felt this wasn't thick enough, try adding instant mashed potatoes in small amounts until the desired thickness is obtained.

Made this with leftover New Years ham. So delicious. I think next time I will garnish with crispy bacon crumbles, a dash of shredded cheese, and the chives. Top Notch Recipe.

Very good!  My issue was my chicken broth. I didn’t have any homemade and used a boxed free range organic stock. No flavor. So I wound up doctoring a little. Next time I’ll use homemade. Definitely a keeper!  I don’t care for cayenne so I used Frank’s Hot Sauce and it was great.

I made this soup for dinner.  It was very hearty and delicious.  Followed the recipe except I didn’t have cream so just used milk.   Served it with cornbread.

Eh, I'm usually a fan of Chef John's dishes, but this one is just OK,  not as good as the reviews make it sound.  Used left over Christmas ham.   Are these helpings supposed to be served in a bucket??  Had so much left over, even after 2 servings a piece!  I know it wasn't  supposed to be a heavy cream soup, but it was runnier than I expected.  The cayenne pepper is a nice touch!

Really quite good.   I made half a recipe and had to use milk but added extra butter as I didn't have heavy cream.  But otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Excellent was to use up leftover ham and extra potatoes.

I made this and followed it exactly. Delicious and perfect! I made it with leftover ham from Chef John's Honey Glazed Ham recipe - also absolutely perfect - leftovers from Christmas. Would make again and again!

This was an awesome dish. I seasoned and smoked a big ham shoulder for Christmas deboned it and put the weird shaped pieces in the fridge In a separate container and saved all of the juices from the ham and put in a sealed container in the fridge as well. Next day I chopped up the ham pieces, 1 whole onion chopped small 1 TBS of Preminced garlic, Browned the onions and garlic in 2 TBS of Canola oil. Then took 5 carrots chopped thin, 5 stalks of celery chopped thin, and 5 Golden potato’s CHOPPED BIG. Everything else was as recipe except I didn’t use the heavy cream, cayenne pepper, or the garnish.  Put all of it in a crock pot with a liberal amount of Italian season (kinda hooked on that stuff) 1 box of chicken broth and all of the juices (fat skimmed off the top...it floats and hardens in the fridge and is super easy to skim off that way) cooked it 8 hours on low and everyone (2 teenage girls) loved my ham better this way than when it was freshly smoked LOL. Definitely making this everytime I smoke a ham from now on!!

I made it and it turned out great!  I too added instant potatoes to thicken it based on feedback from the family. 
 I also substituted smoked turkey for ham and...BAM! Awesomeness! Thanks Chef John.

I made the recipe following all the ingredients. My final result looked like the photo. I added the heavy cream at the end. It looked like White clam chowder. It was delicious all the way around. I was a little hearty with the carrots and ham. The bigger pieces of ham helped with thickening up of the soup. I mashed half the potatoes with a masher and left the choppped up ones alone. I added a little more salt and some frozen corn kernals that was it. And the half cup of heavy cream at the very end. I stirred the cream in for a few more minutes then I turned the stove off.  Kudos to Chef John! I will definitely make this again. It was delicious!

I happened to have all the ingredients on hand--followed the recipe exactly (except I subbed half & half).  Very flavorful and hearty.  Definitely worth the effort.

Made this a few nights ago, and it was wonderful! Although I didn’t measure all the veggies, and used more than called for except for the potatoes, it was the best ham and potato soup we ever ate! Will definitely make again.

I made this with leftover spiral cut ham so it had a definite sweetness to it.  I still thought it was good, but think it would be better with just a smoked ham, rather than sugar-coated spiral cut.

Chef John, you did it again!  I cooked a ham for New Year's dinner and thought I'd make a  soup with some of the leftovers.  This soup is absolutely amazing.  I am east of Toronto and it's frigid here right now so your soup recipe really hit the spot.
The only change I made to this recipe was using Half & Half because I didn't have any heavy cream.  I think it worked beautifully!

I had leftover Christmas ham & a veggie tray.  I followed this recipe, also throwing in the broccoli and cauliflower from the tray.  Delicious!   I also forgot to put in the cream but the soup was still good without it.  Love that I was able to use last night's dinner in a new and tasty way.

Really good. I made it in the crock pot. I threw everything in on low added  a pinch of thyme and a tsp of chopped parsley and let it cook for 4hrs. I added  a full cup of heavy cream , 1/2 hr before serving and a 1/4 C of parmesan cheese.

Delicious! The changes I made were shredded part of the carrot and diced the rest, used1 cup half and half, no water. I transferred this to the crockpot to cook on low for six hours. Everyone loved this soup, I will make it again and again. Thank you Chef John.

This got rave reviews from the family.  I did make a couple changes.  I didn't have fresh potatoes on hand so I used leftover mashed potatoes that we originally had with the ham the day before.  It thickened the soup up to a nice creamy texture.  I also added additional ham and veggies and corn and we didn't miss the chunks of potato at all.

I changed most everything...turnips, not potatoes, no water, doubled the garlic, bacon bits not ham, xanthin gum not flour, added Worcestershire, some hot sauce plus the cayenne. It was pretty good.

My husband rated it a “6” because it was so good..  It was delish! Looking forward to leftovers!  I did substitute  canned milk because I was out of cream  and added some kale just because I had some.  Loved the extra color and added texture..

This soup was absolutely brilliant. Everybody loved it. The only changes I made were because of the ingredients I had on hand. I used creole seasoning instead of the cayenne pepper. I also used unpeeled red potatoes instead of the Yukon gold. 

 I made a double recipe for a large gathering at Christmas. It was devoured very quickly. And everybody wanted the recipe. As a sidenote, I made it two days in advance and it was perfect on Christmas.

I was making a triple batch for a crowd. To bulk it up a bit I  ham, carrots, celery and potatoes in addition to what triple the recipe called for. After the potatoes simmered the soup looked a little thin. Before adding the cream I thickened the broth with some cornstarch and water. The result was a creamy awesome potato ham soup. Some guests asked for the recipe.. I was happy to send them the link. This is a substantial soup which I will make again.

You betcha this is a five star soup recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter with one exception, I put in two carrots for color and flavor. Would not change a thing. This recipe is just enough for two people and that meant two small bowls for each. Yes, stir, stir, stir the soup while cooking and the peas break down nicely. I added garlic and butter croutons before serving. Chef John, your recipes are the best.

My son and I made this today as a way to use up some leftover Christmas ham. It took us quite a bit longer than the advertised prep and cooking times, but it was worth it in the end. The whole family absolutely loved this soup. We stuck pretty close to the recipe, and had to cook the potatoes for about 10 minutes longer than described. Great stuff!

Used left over Honey Baked ham  that was a Christmas gift and followed the recipe to a tee other than that. Served it in sourdough bread bowls. My soup hating wife had seconds and took what was left to work for lunch the next day. Chef John comes through again.

I had a ton of leftover Christmas ham, coupled with subzero Cleveland temperatures, so I decided to make this well-reviewed soup. Talk about super easy and equally flavorful! I made no modifications to the recipe, but because I love a little “kick” to my soup, added approximately a 1/4 tsp of cayenne. I only wish I’d had the chives to make the soup even better!

We made this almost exactly as the recipe stated and it was delicious and very filling. Our only changes were to use the red and russet potatoes that we had on hand instead of Yukon gold and scallions on top instead of chives. We also left the cayenne out because some members of the family don't like spice. Those who do added some to their own bowls. It was a total hit with plenty of leftovers to take to work this whole week. No tweaking needed on this recipe.

Awesome comfort food and not hard to make.  I stuck to the recipe but added a couple shakes of cumin and parsley the last few minutes. Thanks Chef John..This isn't the first recipe of yours that I have made, and I love the videos.

Great job as always Chef John!  Followed this almost exactly but had to use 1/2 and 1/2 because I had no heavy cream.  Even  sent my husband out to the garden in the freezing cold for the chives.  Very delicious and will make again when I have leftover ham.  The one I had was pretty salty so I didn't add any to the soup.  Glad I tasted it before adding any!  This is a keeper especially for a very cold day!

This is now my hands down favorite winter soup. It is easy to make, and delicious. I used a ham steak and cut it into cubes for the ham in the soup. I forgot to put it in until the very end and it still turned out great. I think the trick to this soup is really taking the time to add the liquid slowly and let the soup thicken.  I also used unpeeled little red potatoes and cut them in half. I also used half and half.  This recipe definitely goes into rotation at dinner time.  If you want to, I also think that you could add broccoli and it would be great too.  Excellent soup!

Very good! Followed the recipe to a "t", although I used 2% milk because that's what I had on hand. Will use this as my go-to potato soup recipe going forward!

Great flavor and a filling soup.  I don't think it's something I would really crave, but if I ever have potatoes and ham I needed to use up, this a great recipe for the job!  I only had heavy whipping cream so I just boiled soup longer to help it thicken up, but I could probably just lessen water next time.  Also, I used one of those "elephant" garlic, sliced as thin as possible.  It was a huge piece which I was afraid would be overwhelmingly garlicy - but I guess this type of garlic is actually more on the sweet side?  I didn't think I'd be able to eat the garlic slices, but when I did I didn't realize I had because either it was a light, sweeter garlic flavor, or the soup just sucked up all the aromatics from it, but turned out great! - I didn't have to worry about picking the slices out!  Also, I didn't have any chives I just sprinkled some basil and parsely.  I feel like the basil maybe wouldn't go with the soup so much, I only did a small amount and then decided to overpower the basil with the parsely but really it was more for aesthetics.  And I forgot about the cayenne pepper so I did without it.

This is really good soup! Instead of a carrot (which I did not have) I added half a bag of heated through frozen carrots and peas and since I didn't have heavy cream I used half and half.  Still awesome!

We have gluten and dairy allergies, so I skipped the heavy cream and used gf flour. This was delicious. Even the kids (9, 9, 7, 5, & 5) gobbled it up. I’ve added it to my saved recipes and printed it. Fantastic.

Not that special. I actually completely skipped the water, because I was afraid it would get too watery and bland tasting, and I am glad I did. The cayenne does add a nice kick to it. I also added 1-1 1/2 teaspoon vinegar to it, to give it more flavor.

I loved this soup! I always double a soup recipe so we can have lunch and another dinner out of them. No need to change a thing once I seasoned it to our liking. More cayenne and pepper but a wonderfully easy, yummy recipe. Thanks Chef John!

This was super easy.  I didn't have any cream, so I used 2.5 cups of homemade ham stock, and  2 cups whole milk instead of the chickenstock and cream.  It came out very creamy, and so yummy.  Whole house gobbled it, no left overs

I made it a lil bit thicker, and added 1/2 cup more of diced ham.
My husband, children, and grandchildren absolutely liked it a lot.

OUTSTANDING!!!  I made this pretty much as written, with the exception of about 1 cup extra diced potato, so that when I mashed up some to thicken it, I'd have plenty of chunks left, and I added a few spices.  And what a delectable one-dish meal, finished perfectly with a loaf of freshly-made, crusty bread. This is comfort food to the max! The flavor is homey, and this really "sticks to your ribs," as my mom used to say. I chopped up a little bit of fresh rosemary from the garden, and added a few shakes of thyme and marjoram. Also added a couple of pinches of turmeric. It makes a big pot, so it's a main meal for 4, with enough left over for a couple of lunches, making this as economical as it is delicious. Cold weather dinners don't come any better than this.

I've made this many times and LOVE it!  Only changes I make is to omit the water and use all chicken broth instead and then at the end I add quite a bit of sharp cheddar cheese.  To me it just wouldn't be right without cheese!!  It does take a fair amount of salt and pepper because potatoes are bland if they aren't properly seasoned.  I also found that this soup freezes very well, when I thawed it and warmed it back up it tasted just as good as the first time around!  Excellent recipe in my opinion!!!

Made it as directed.  First, I am amazed at how easy this is to make (I can actually remember how it's done and won't have to look it up everytime  I want to make it.  Second, as soon as I added the broth i tasted it and I just couldn't wait until it was actually done; the soup was just wonderful tasting.  Third, everyone gave it a compliment!  Thank you Chef John!!!

This soup is a family favorite, and today I tried it in my Instant Pot. First, I sautéed the onion, carrot, garlic and celery. Then I added the flour and stirred. Next I turned the Instant pot off and added chicken broth and potatoes. I cooked it on high pressure for 10 minutes, followed by manual release. I mashed some potatoes and put the ham in.  I put it on sauté for a few minutes then turned it to warm. The cream and seasonings,to taste, went in last. Yummy!

Followed the recipe but used a few more carrots, celery and potatoes than it called for. Great way to use leftover ham from Easter dinner. The recipe was very easy to follow and everyone loved the soup. Will definitely make this again.

I made this yesterday and OH MY! it was delicious! It is definitely being added to my list of favorites. The only thing I did differently was I boiled the leftover ham bone in the chicken stock. It added a nice rich flavor.

I followed the recipe as is and thought it was delicious. I thought the broth tasted great and was a bit hesitant to add the cream, but did so as the recipe instructed. It came out even better. I will definitely be making this soup again.

It was really good! I am pokey and it took me about 2 hours from start to finish due to chopping and potatoes taking longer to soften. Worth it though.

Great soup.  Wife asked me to make sure to print and save the recipe.   Only change I made was to increase the carrot from one to two.   I did steam some broccoli separately and we added some to our  soup bowls  to make it healthier.   Fantastic soup.

Very good potato soup. Used my immersion blender instead of potatoe masher and left just enough chunks. Did not add the milk or half and half and it was still delicious.

I made it as directed with the exception of substituting cornstach for flour.  We eat gluten free due to "celiac."     My husband is not a "soup fan" but he absolutely loved it!   Very tasty....easy....and quick!!   Had GF  biscuits and apple butter to accompany it....absolutely delish!    He even asked me to be sure and put it in our "favorites" cookbook!   Thank you for this submission!!!

Really good. Didn't need extra salt because I used regular chicken broth. I used only a light cereal cream and less of it for less calories. I also skimmed most of the butter off at the end but left a little for the yummy flavor it adds.

I made this for my husband and nephew, and it turned out great without the cream!  I didn't add any salt because of the sodium in the chicken broth and ham, and it came out fine.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Very good.  One tip-don't use a ham that's really sweet because it takes away from the flavor of the soup.  A plain smoked ham is best

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception that I doubled it but forgot to get enough chicken broth for doubling but did have enough vegetable broth.  One of the other reviews I read made the comment that the reason for doubling was because the recipe said it was only four servings. As the other review said, I don't know what size servings this recipe is referring to because it made so much soup! Also, the next time I make it I won't double, completely, all the solid ingredients because there  was so much vegetables and potatoes compared to liquid. The taste was very good and it was just thick enough.

My husband loves potato soup, but I usually hate it.  I decided to give this recipe a try, and I'm glad I did!  
I used white pepper instead of black pepper.  I added a little turmeric and smoked paprika with the cayenne, and used sliced green onion instead of chives, but otherwise followed the recipe as shown.
Delicious!!!  I will be making this again.

Made this soup today as I am looking for a recipe to feed about 50 people for a Springer Spaniel Dog Club. I look for filling, warm, and somewhat cost effective ideas.  Well I must say....absolutely delicious. I did add a little salt/pepper, but I like a strong flavor so I put in 2 teaspoons of Knorr's Chicken Flavored Bouillon. It put this soup over the top. I rated this based on what I tasted before adding the extra bouillon granules; it was delicious.

I have lost count how many times I have made this delicious soup.  I have never been a ham lover but this is a fantastic soup.  I have to stop myself to making it too often.

I made this following the recipe pretty much exactly except for 2 things: I used leftover potatoes au gratin and I had to use ham luncheon meat. It was still delicious and so easy and fast.

Perfect!!!! I used homemade chicken broth that I had in the freezer and did not add extra water. Threw in some frozen peas and a lot of fresh chopped dill in the last 5 minutes. Delicious!

Fabulous recipe!  Getting into the soup season and this recipe is a keeper.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for adding another great recipe to my "dormant season"(winter) file.

My family and friends love this soup! I usually make it as it is written but sometimes I make slight variations depending on ingredients that I have on hand. It always turns out delicious. I love the touch of cayenne pepper!

So good! I tend to make it with leftover scalloped potatoes from Thanksgiving or Christmas in order to give it a really creamy taste; plus, it's a great way to use leftovers. A little dash of nutmeg can really give this recipe a nice kick.

I made this according to recipe ... AWESOMELY YUMMY doesn't do it justice...the recipe is easy to follow and with the addition of the video it allows the "novice" cook to shine like a professional. Going to made it again today but instead of using ham I am going to try it with Bacon Bits... one of my family members does really like ham but LOVES bacon.

This is delicious.  The only thing s I did differently is to use all chicken stock instead of the broth and water.  I added a red bell pepper just because I had it on hand and used fat free half and half instead of the heavy whipping cream.  The chicken stock gives it a wonderful flavor.

I doubled the recipe and used slightly less broth and water than it called for.  Also left out the carrot (forgot to put that on my list.) It was wonderful.

Made this today, followed recipie exactly,  except made my own ham stock to replace chicken stock and added some veggie stock to equal recipe amout.  Also used half and half instead of cream.  Husband says it's the best soup he's ever had..to quote "the depth of flavor is amazing".

Great recipe!  I'll use the same base for my next cod and corn chowder.  I added two tablespoons of yellow mustard, a couple glugs of Worcestershire Sauce and substituted the heavy cream for half-and-half - totally delish!!!

Made this for dinner - followed the directions pretty much to a T and it came out superb.  Chef John does it again.  I am not a great cook so his videos always help me out tremendously.  Husband said it was probably the best potato soup he's ever had & we are big soup people.  
We had some Parmesan crisps purchased from Whole Foods  deli & I wound up using that crumbled up on top as a type of cracker which added another awesome element.
I'll be making this one again and again.
Thanks Chef John

Well, this soup certainly turned out to be a hit! So simple, yet rich & comforting. It came together quick, on a weeknight, and went well with a crusty loaf. A great use of our ham dinner scraps. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Another hit from Chef John. Thank You.

Perfectly delicious and comforting!
I did add !Cayenne...I put it in my hand first to make sure I didn't dump too much in by mistake...learned that the hard way along time ago...wound up adding a little more...Very easy!
I will be making this again and again! Thank you Chef John!

OMG, hubby can't get enough of this! I left out the two optional ingredients but otherwise made it exactly by the recipe. With just the two of us, we had left overs so not only did we have it for dinner, but hubby had it for lunch for two days after and still asked me to make it again the following week!

After reading the nonstop raves, I made this almost exactly as written (I added more potatoes (about 2 pounds) and used all chicken broth instead of water as others reccommended.)

It is OUTRAGEOUSLY good! The kids said it was the best thing I've ever made, and I had to tear myself away from it before I ate it all.

Best of all, it's something that's extremely easy to make because all you need is the ham - chances are you already have the other ingredients on hand. It comes together quickly for a weeknight, and is a hearty meal all by itself. The cooking times are spot on, as well.

I would love to know if it freezes well, because next time I'd like to double the recipe.

A little too much work to make it, especially after long day at work, but it sure worth it! I also add corn. If you find that soup is not as thick as you would like, add a little instant potato. Thank for sharing.

This was a great soup!!!! However it was a bit more watery than I wanted (I did double the recipe). Next time I will one less cup of water and one to two oz. less of the broth. I will definitely be making this again.

Loved!  Loved!  Loved it!  I used the broth from a ham bone instead of the chicken broth.  Also omitted the  cream and the cyanne  pepper as it was hearty enough!  A real meal in a bowl!

Made this per recipe but skipped the cayenne. Instead I added some smoked paprika and a couple dashes of Chipotle Tabasco sauce for some extra smokiness and heat.   We stirred in shredded cheddar to our individual bowls. My husband and I thought it was great and very filling.

The first time I made it ,I mistakenly used chicken stock instead of broth. It still came out great. The second time I added an extra tablespoon of butter.  This recipe is  a keeper. I'll be making this soup  many more times.

I've made this many times and everyone loves it. I forgot to add the second cup of water this last time and liked it even better. I also cook the onions and celery way down as my husband doesn't like veggie textures.

I've made this soup a few times and love it every time.  It has been the best when I've started it with a ham bone, though.  If I have a ham bone, I put it in a pot with enough water to cover it and throw a bay leaf in.  I use that "water" and homemade chicken stock and it comes out very flavorful.

I made this and my husband just lived it!! He loved it so much he asked me to make this again for a party we were going to! I added as a garnish... if you choose to.... Shredded cheese and chives! It was a big hit! 

I have to admit I added sauted onions and garlic to enhance the flavor.

I found the flavour was very nice but the soup was very thick. I would probably put less flour in next time, if any.  The potatoes thicken the soup on their own.  After refrigerating, the soup was solid. All the liquid was absorbed.

This soup was delicious with our leftover spiral ham from Christmas.  The only change I made was use chicken stock in place of the chicken broth and water.  I also opted to use the cayenne pepper.  A definite keeper.  Thanks again Chef John, your recipes are always winners!

Easy and delicious. Was using up Christmas ham and threw in much more than called for which was extra tasty.  Took more like 25 minutes for my diced russets to soften.

This is more of a poor man's velouté sauce with ham and vegetables added. Five minutes is more appropriate to cook the flour taste from the blonde roux. You shouldn't have to "mash" a soup, nor skim fat from it, especially if you are using a broth instead of a stock.

I followed the recipe and turned out great. The only thing I would like it to be more creamy not sure if more flour might help. I didn't have any cayenne pepper so added hot sauce and it had just a little bite. I will make again.

My wife said two things that give it 5 stars: "I literally can't eat this fast enough!" and "If I got this at a restaurant I'd love it!".  The prep time is worth it although next time I might just buy a bag of frozen diced potatoes.

Prepared as written sans the cayenne pepper. Very rich flavor worth all of the effort. Potatoes took 45 minutes instead if 15 perhaps because I kept the burner on low to prevent sticking,

Update: I made this a second time but did not have Yukon Gold potatoes so I used russet potatoes. Soup had a totally different texture because the russet potatoes broke down. Be sure to use Yukon Gold potatoes.

I'm making it again for the second time and for Christmas Day lunch/dinner. It's a great soup, I add more of the veggies and ham for a hearty soup. At the end where you're supposed to mash some of the potatoes, I don't do that, but I add about 3/4 cup instant potatoes to thicken it a bit. This soup is a major crowd pleaser that warms the soul

Delicious and fairly easy. I made this pretty much exactly as written, except I used red potatoes because that's what I have in my kitchen--I generally prefer them--and I didn't use any cayenne or chives. Very pleased with this, will definitely make it again next time I've got ham leftovers.

Very good and so quick and easy to prepare. From prep to table in under an hour! That is a huge plus in my book. Note the quantity of liquids, this makes much more thank just four servings.

Oh my goodness! This is fantastic! So simple and easy to make but it tastes like you fussed and fussed over it. I sometimes throw in some barley for one more texture (I love the chewiness of barley!) and even a bit of shredded cabbage once in awhile. But even when I make this exactly as written, it is a five star soup!

4 stars as written - 5 stars with my modifications:  I used all chicken stock instead of stock and water.  Also, to thicken it at the end, I used instant mashed potatoes instead of cream.  So good!

Fantastic! My hub is not a really big "soup person" and he LOVED it!! Went back for seconds. Hearty, and creamy, perfect for a cold day. Used all "Brodo" (bone broth) and did not cut with the water. Also used russet potatoes. Don't skimp on the cream at the end! It's a magical moment when it goes in. It is instantly transformed into a restaurant quality soup. This will become a winter staple for us. Great way to use up leftover ham from the holidays. Thanks Chef John!

Super YUM!! The only change I made ( because other reviews suggested) was to use chicken broth instead of water... I will use that water next time. Seemed a little TOO brothy, salty, and too much like chicken soup with ham. ;)  it was still yummy and TOTALLY my opinion about the broth! Thanks Chef!

I normally do not review recipes, but this one I had to rate.
I did not change a thing with this soup, the flavor and consistency was wonderful.
My family enjoyed this soup.  I REALLY enjoyed this soup.  It will be part of my winter line up.  Thanks Chef John you hit a homerun with this one.

Excellent,  my family loved it.  It does make more than for 4 servings though.  But that is ok.  I just freeze the rest for a night that I do not have time to cook.  I did grate up some Gruyere Cheese to put into the soup.  Makes it especially good.

I wanted to make this soup without using the dairy items in the recipe, and I found a good way to get there today, with very tasty results.  Here are my modifications, etc.
1.) Substitute Coconut Oil for the Butter
2.) Substitute Cauliflower for half of the potatoes 
3.) Skip the heavy cream
4.) I used about a teaspoon of spiking salt (a mix of herbs and sea salt) in place of salt & pepper for seasoning
5.) Use about 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper

The cauliflower (and small gold potatoes) were cut into small pieces before cooking in the soup pot, then hand mashed in the pot after cooking.  The result was a thicker soup than the photo of the original recipe shows.  I enjoyed it, and my wife, who is not a fan of ham soup  - rated it 8 out of 10.

Here is a little hint on how to thicken the soup without mashing up your ham and other vegetables in the process.  When the soup is essentially finished, slowly add in some premium brand (not cheap generic store brand) instant mashed potatoes until the soup is to your desired thickness.  Remember, it will continue to get a little thicker after adding, so slowly stir in thoroughly a little bit at a time.  If the soup does become too thick, you can always thin it with more chicken broth or a bit of water.  Again, check the seasonings, as this will tend to tone down the saltiness.  Some diced red bell pepper is also a great addition to the flavor of this soup, and for cryin' out loud, add the cayenne pepper!

I've made this many times. It's always good, but it's the best  when I smoke a ham and use the leftovers. Very rich, thick and filling. We make a meal out it with bread and a salad.

Awesome soup that can be made within an hour, especially when you have tons of leftover ham from thanksgiving or Christmas. This is not super creamy or thick so if you are expecting a thick, chowder like soup this isn't it (although I would argue that adding some corn starch and water can thicken this right up to your liking). In my household this recipe is kids approved, and this is one good way to get them to eat veggie.

Delicious! Made it mostly as is except used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream.  I was looking to use up leftover holiday ham, but I would buy ham just to make this again.  Great comfort food on a cold night.  I doubled the recipe and am so glad to have leftovers for tomorrow.   I can always count on Chef John to make me look like a good cook - love his sense of humor too!

Easy and VERY good!!!!   Combined a splash of milk with 1/4 cup light sour cream instead of the cream, otherwise used all other ingredients as listed.  I heated up the sour cream in the microwave before adding it to the soup so it would not curdle.  Do add a few sprinkles of cayenne.  Gives it a little kick.  Took out 1/2 of the soup, picked out the ham and blended in a blender.  Made for a nice texture - some blended and some chunks.

I was skeptical while it was cooking.  It looked a little thin and just not that great.  The last steps of mashing some of the potatoes and adding the cream brought it all together.  It was REALLY good.  I think I ate three bowls.  My daughter said it was good, and she doesn't usually like real food.

We made two pots, because my wife is gluten free and in her pot we used gluten free flour in place of the 1/4 flour.  She said hers was great too.  We may be making this often.

I made a few small changes, I used celery salt instead of the actual vegetable (because I did not have any), and I used the whole pint of heavy cream and 1 extra can of chicken broth because I used more potatoes than the recipe called for. It was delicious and I would def make it again!

Best ever potato soup Ive made. Even though you could use any potatoes. I think the Yukon gold added to the creamy, buttery flavor. Don't pass on the cayenne. Just a shake makes a difference.

This is a great potato soup recipe.  I made it as written with very few modifications.  It's a perfect soup for lunch this week.

Simple, delicious, and very filling. I think it makes more than four servings...but my husband hasn't tried it yet, so we'll see!
P.S. (next day edit) 
My family loved it. It is hearty, creamy and so tasty. This is definitely something I will be making over and over again this fall and winter.

My husband said it was the best I ever made.  I did make some changes.  I doubled the recipe and added more flour so the soup would be thicker. I used 2 quarts homemade chicken stock and added a few shakes of Italian seasoning. I also forgot the cream but was excellent soup for a cold rainy day.

Delicious! I used a fair amount of pepper and cayenne, but no salt. I also doubled the amount of flour to help thicken the broth, though it was still quite thin. Wonderful all the same! There are DEFINITELY more than four servings per batch though, so keep that in mind when considering doubling the recipe.

This was delicious! I like that it is a thinner cream soup. I was heavy on the pepper and I accidentally sautéed my potatoes with the vegetables. It still turned out great. Probably because I had not diced my potatoes too tiny. So good! Thank you for sharing!

Delicious! I did changes some ingredients, I use coconut milk instead of regular milk, added parsley, baby kale to put more veggies. You can actually add anything to it and still come out a great soup.

I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could.  Love Chef John's recipes! Just as I was about to serve this soup I realized I never added the water, but I think that worked out for the best.  I don't understand why this soup would need all that extra water.  The broth was plenty of liquid, and with mashing the soup and adding the cream, it was wonderfully thick and creamy. Definitely a rich, hearty soup. Great with rolls and salad!

This soup is very easy and delicious for leftover ham. The only thing I did was add a little wondra flour at the end because I like a thicker soup. Highly recommend!

Great recipe!  I didn't have smoked ham, only packaged diced ham so I used that and I thought it worked out just fine.  I kept everything else the same - the recipe is a winner as is!  Next time, however, I think I will increase the flour to 1/3 cup so it is a little thicker.  This soup made a wonderful lunch on a cool Sunday afternoon - I just wish I would've doubled it so there would be more leftovers for tomorrow!

I whipped this together for a late dinner, used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream because that's all I had.  I also added torn slices of American Cheese (8 slices altogether) and my family said it was the best soup they've ever had.  It would have been just as great of a recipe even without the ham.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I did the recipe as written.  The only thing I did different was I purée the soup without the ham.  After everything purée, I put the ham inside. Serve it with bacon and cheese. Yum.... Definitely a keeper.  
Thank you for the sharing this recipe.

Another Chef John home run!  This soup was easy to put together and was a great way to use up some ham leftovers.  I made the recipe exactly as written except I didn't have 3 cloves of garlic, so I used powder.  I also used low sodium broth and skipped the cream at the end to save some fat grams, not sure it would have made things much better.  Next time, I may add a cup or two of shredded cheddar cheese.

We love this recipe and have been making it for years.  The only change I make, to cut down on the fat, is to peel and cook an extra potato on the side and mash it up and add to the soup in place of the cream at the end to thicken and add body.  I've also used fat free 1/2 & 1/2.  I also cut back on the salt a bit.

Really tasty! It's simple to make, but has excellent flavor. I figured I'd need to add more spices, but found I like it just as written. I used low sodium broth, and the ham added just what was needed. I made a honey corn bread to eat with it - the soup is too filling for a side sandwich IMO...thanks again, CJ! I love your recipes & videos!

We love this soup. It's so easy and you can add more of everything, you dont have to be exact it's all good. 
I double it because it's so tasty! You wont have lumps in your soup adding the flour this way. Love it! Thanks  John.

We really liked this soup. We like the cayenne pepper in it. Gives a little extra warmth on cold winter days. Very easy recipe to make.

I've made this soup twice this week. The only thing I changed was I added 2 bay leafs, and parsley for color. Best potato soup ever!! A new winter comfort food, added to our rotation.

We liked this and it was kid approved too.  I used vegetable stock and a bit of chicken bouillon since that's what I had on hand.  I also added some frozen corn at the end.  Thanks for another great recipe.

Can not beat this on a cold winter day to fill the belly and raise the core temperature. I double the ingredients to make it worth while and I used my home made ham bone and chicken broth as the stock base for this great soup. Another home run Chef John lead on.

I made this soup for my husband & son and I have to tell you it was out of this world .I followed the recipe as directed and there isn't anything I would do differently. However my son added 1/2 package of equal to his individual bowl and it enhanced the flavor brought all the different flavors out ever more. I would recommend this soup to anyone who wants to warm up their tummies. Will recommend this to all of my friends. 
Thank you Chef John

As I watched the snow falling yesterday and thinking of an easy comfort soup to warm up with, I  ventured upon this great potato soup recipe.  The only changes I made were to add 2-3 teaspoons of Minor's Chicken Base to 6 cups of water and 1/2 cup of fat free milk.  The results were superb!  I diced up 6-8 ounces of leftover smoked ham, a few shallots that were beginning to sprout , an onion, carrot, stalk of celery, few bulbs of sliced garlic , and "voila"!

Very tasty!  I threw my taters in shortly after adding the broth.  I never added extra water.  It came out nicely thickened. I did add the heavy cream but I think next time will add a dollop of sour cream instead.  Topped with a sprinkle of shreddy cheddar and some green onions.  Yummy!

Tried this soup tonight. It turned out great. Even my picky twelve year old had seconds. The only change I made was to add some left over mashed potatoes to the broth.

I made this soup today but doubled everything, I also added a 1/2 tsp. of dried mustard and used the cayenne pepper.  Before serving I added shredded cheese and scallions on top of each bowl.  It was absolutely delicious.  I was going to put bacon bits on top as well but realized I didn't have any.  I'll try that next time.  Great recipe, thank you.

This is a delicious soup. I have made it several times and have made it as is, as well as substituted cooked crumbled bacon instead of the ham. I have also added fresh corn off the cob, different seasonings and it is perfect every time. This recipe freezes very well and is definitely a keeper. You won't be disappointed.

Delicious! Great way to use leftover Thanksgiving ham. I substituted butter for 3 T of olive oil, used 3 cups of chicken broth, and 1 cup of water. I also omitted the heavy cream, you won't miss it.

Thanks Chef John!

This soup is delicious! For such inexpensive ingredients it fools you into thinking you are eating an expensive restaurant soup! I double the amount of carrots and celery to make it more nutritious and you can sub half and half or milk for the cream. SO good!

Thank you so much.  I made this exactly as written and Chef John, you have a winner here!  Everyone enjoyed this soup and not one complaint.  I did take the option of the cayenne pepper and it was perfect, just one eight of a teaspoon.  Again, thank you for sharing.

Oh my gosh! I just tried this recipe and it is delicious!  Chef John, you can cook for me any time! In fact I will now only go to your recipes when I need something!  Thank you so much!  And I like the hint you gave about "no lumps!" It worked!

Also, what I did was cook the leftover ham bones (3) in the chicken stock and water and then added it to the veggies.  YUM!

This is a great recipe, I've made it a few times already and there's hardly any left-overs. I didn't have any heavy cream and substituted with milk, which worked just fine. I used a smoked ham steak and I made my own broth making half with ham bullion and the other half chicken. It was awesome!

I can't stop eating this soup! My husband who is not a soup fan even liked it. I didn't add celery because it's not something we normally keep stocked. I used bouillon cubes to make the broth (which is a little less flavorful than canned broth I think) so I used only one cup of water. I still had to add quite a bit of salt and a little pepper so next time I might not even add water at all or add an extra cup of broth instead of water. Anyway, this is one of my favorite recipes ever! Thanks Chef John!

It's a good basic recipe. I tripled the carrots and celery. And I think the cayenne is definitely needed for flavor!

Add more carrots and celery.
Needs more thickening, don't skimp on potatoes

I made it for my family and everyone loved it! It was a huge hit, even more when you know that some don't even like garlic, onion and celery! 
I now make it at least once a month.

Like some of others I doubled the recipe...holy cow that's a lot of soup.  Very good soup...but a lot of it!  Nicely done, Chef John.  Extra pepper and cayenne for us.  And, don't be tempted to put the potatoes in earlier than recommended.  Well done.

This is a great recipe!  The cayenne pepper adds just the right amount of bite.  My family are not fans of split pea and ham soup but absolutely love this recipe. Thank you Chef John!

Delicious -- where have you been hiding Chef John? Where are your other recipes?  

I was at the butcher and he had some ham ends, I had everything else on hand.  In my husband's words, "this is really good."  Simple and easy; plus, Chef John's voice is so soothing as he talks about putting the dish together.  I even made one mistake and it still came out great.  Thank you, please post other recipes and make them easier to find on this website.

Great recipe! I did a few changes, put in less onions ( personal prefernce ) added garlic powder and more than a pinch of Tony Chachere's! Loved it!  I  made  this again on 12/26/15, this time used Brisket instead of ham but like before, it really needs spice to kick it up a notch.

Very tasty!!!  Due to a food allergy, I made mine gluten free by substituting cornstarch for the flour. I waited until the end before I thickened it.  Arrowroot would work too.  (Just mix about two heaping tablespoons with a bit of water before adding to soup. The soup will thicken as it simmers.) I will make this again!  Like other reviewers said, you can use the basic recipe but make modifications based on what you like and/or have on hand.  I didn't have celery or carrots so I eliminated them.  I did add celery salt and butter beans.  Then I topped it with shredded cheddar instead of chives...Delicious!

This soup was excellent.  I followed the recipe almost to a T except that I used smoked sausage in place of the ham and added a couple extra tablespoons of flour to have it thicken up a bit more.  Other than that the recipe was easy to follow and will definitely make again.

This is excellent, rich and flavorful. I made it just as the recipe states, without the optional cayenne. Next time I will try it with half and half instead of whipping cream to cut the fat content a bit. This is a keeper recipe!

I found this recipe today, and made it today. Very good flavor but I did add a bay leaf and a pinch of thyme for added flavor. Will make this one again for sure. I made it for 8 servings and there was plenty for leftovers.

What a delicious soup!  I had about 1/2 cup of a homemade cheese sauce leftover from some macaroni and cheese that I'd made a few days ago that I threw in with the soup.   I have 3 picky eaters and all three kids gobbled this right up.  This will be going on a regular rotation in our home.  Thanks!

Just finished my first bowl of this delicious soup.  Was good as written but I kicked it up a notch or two by adding more potatoes and cheese per husbands request. Definately will make again and again.

This soup was absolutely delicious!  My husband loved it and asked me to make it twice in one week, he loved it so much.  Will definitely make again with my leftover ham.

Great recipe! It's easy and quick to make. I've made this soup twice already and my husband and kids love it.  Also the video that goes along with it wonderful. Love the art jokes in it too.  I didn't change a thing.
