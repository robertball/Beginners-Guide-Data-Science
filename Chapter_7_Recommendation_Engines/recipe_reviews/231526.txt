Loved the tangy horseradish in this. I used a kurabota ham from Snake River Farms...so tender and delicious!

At first, I was starting to doubt this recipe but when the ham was complete, I was pleasantly surprised! Itâ€™s not to sweet and not a whole lot of spice. It was also good even for leftovers.
