This recipe is amazing, it will surprise you!  My husband was skeptical (to say the least) when he saw me cutting up all the root vegetables.  I followed the recipe exactly, my husband and I were astounded at how good this turned out.  I cut the jicama and turnip into med-small chunks, about thumb size, to help them bake easier.  I baked my vegetables in an 11x15 pan for about 70 minutes and stirred them several times while they baked.  The vegetables became sweet and slightly caramelized, so good!  Thank you for this recipe!!

very good.I cut the salt back to 1 tsp though...1 TB of salt is a lot and need to keep things healthier for hubby with high blood pressure. For personal reasons I cut the rosemary in half because I do like it in moderation but am not fond of a strong rosemary flavor. Gets a 4 due to seasoning changes. For me it has to be perfect as written to get a 5.

OH YUM! I used the root vegetables that I had on hand so I did not use jicama or turnips. Doubled up the others. Used about 4 Tablespoons of olive oil and a Tablespoon of fresh snipped rosemary. Perfect and simple and I will make this again & again. Thanks for sharing!

I had received some fresh root veggies in a local produce box I ordered, and decided to use them in this recipe. I did not have jicama, so I replaced it with fennel as another reviewer suggested. I used fresh rosemary and thyme from my herb garden- about 2 Tbsp each. I used a little less olive oil and salt than called for in the recipe, simply based on my personal tastes. Save for those slight adjustments, I stayed true to the recipe and really loved it. Everyone did! The veggies get that sweet, caramelized flavor when they're roasted. Just delicious. Will make this again!

This was really delicious! I left out the potatoes because I was also serving garlic mashed. My supermarket didn't have jicama. I substituted fennel. It was amazing, a great complement to roast lamb for Easter dinner. The fresh rosemary is very important, don't leave it out!

This was really good and will make again. The next time, I shall put the turnip and parsnip in about 15 minutes ahead of the rest of the veggies.  They took a bit longer to cook.  Very flavorful!

This works with all types of vegetables.  I usually use unpealed redskin potatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes, acorn or butternut squash, shallots or onions, garlic, & mushrooms, tossed with olive oil & whatever spices you like best.  Green beans & beets are good, cauliflower & broccoli work, too, but may take less time to bake.  All vegetables taste better roasted until they caramalize.

I chop my veggies & put them in a large bowl.  Mix sesonings & oil then pour it over veggies & mix well.  Put them in a foil lined pan for easy clean up.  Also check fridge for veggies that might be ready for veggie heaven.  Chop them & add to mix.  I like this with smoked sausage.

I actually added chicken to this bake, added 1/3 cup water, mixed it all together, cooked it covered for 20, and uncovered for 20. It was DELICIOUS!!! My husband loved it.

Great idea. Admittedly I only had potatoes carrots and turnips on hand. Also I added dill and pepper to the mix. And threw a couple salmon fillets on top for the last few minutes. Great idea though. So delicious with Greek yogurt and tobasco.

I thought this was really good. :) I used dried rosemary, and that was a mistake. Next time I'll use fresh rosemary because it was like pine needle on top of my tasty vegetables. This was a great recipe though, simple, and really filling. My boyfriend ate all of his in like ten minutes. :P

Delicious.  I bake mine longer and prefer to steam my carrots a bit prior to roasting as I don't want them to be hard.  Beets make a nice addition.  I always add some onion too.

5 stars! I went back for 3rds. I think it was the variety of root vegetable flavors with the perfect seasonings. I used red potatoes with skin on, yams, sweet potatoes, carrots, and onion for the vegetables. I also added cooked ground hamburger and melted cheese on the top at the end. I did these two things to make it more kid friendly, but it would have been just as good without the hamburger and cheese. The rosemary and garlic were spot on.

Used half as many veggies, and dried rosemary.  Fresh would have been better. I also added onion at 35min and topped with cherry tomatoes for some acidity. Served with grilled chicken breast. Delicious!

My husband and I both liked this. It has a Thanksgiving type of flavor. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use jicama because I couldn't find it at the store. You can kind of mix it up depending on what you like (add more sweet potatoes, less turnips, etc.).

this is so delicious.  i used white yams and they stood out in such a tasty way, it was fantastic.  the jicama added great texture.  this dish is perfect if you want something cozy and healthy to eat; and to make your home smell like heaven.

I was encouraged to try jicama so I was looking for recipes and found this one. Since I had a bunch of other root vegetables I gave it a try. The flavours were great I just found that it took longer to get everything fully cooked to the texture I like, which may have been a result of my chunkier chopping. Will definately use this recipe again.

Loved it!  I added more taters, carrots and parsnips and only used 2 tsp of salt.  The jicama ended up still a little crunchy compared to the rest of the veggies but was still yummy.

Have made this root roast for years...I also add fennel and butternut squash.
