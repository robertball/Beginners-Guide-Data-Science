Outstanding! Increased sugar to 1/3 cup and that was perfect. I didn't have powdered milk so I cut water to slightly over 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup milk. Chose light crust setting. Came out perfect. Will definitely make again!

This is the best bread machine recipe ever!!  It actually tastes like my Grandma's homemade bread.  I was so impressed.  In general, white bread recipes turn out ok, but this recipe turned out great!  It think it's the egg that makes it taste that much better.  This bread doesn't stay around too long!

We attacked the defenseless loaf hot from the machine. Armed with serrated knife, cutting board, butter and homemade jam, we fell upon the loaf and eradicated half its ranks. Excellent delicate crumb, fabulous flavor; makes delicious toast the next day...if any survives that long.

I followed the recipe exactly. Too many people rate a recipe after making sevearal changes. In my opinion you can't rate a recipe when you entirely revamped the given recipe. 

Great texture & appearance. Tastes pretty good. I feel like something is missing. Perhaps a little more sugar &/or butter instead of oil? I will definitely use this recipe as a base for future experimentation to come up with breads that I like even more.

I am not a huge fan of bread machines, but we were out of bread one night and I thought to haul mine out to make a loaf. I used this recipe and it turned out so good that it was gone very quickly. So I sent my husband to the store for more yeast, and began to make a second loaf. This time, I put the whole package of yeast in the machine (because more is always better, right?). I set the timer for overnight, because it was late and the next morning I had a Lucy Ricardo moment when I walked into the kitchen---the bread had exploded through the top of the machine! Not being one to waste anything, I salvaged most of the bread by breaking it into pieces, drying it out, and making a bread pudding. For my third try, after spending close to an hour cleaning up the bread machine, I measured everything precisley. Unfortunately, the bread machine had not survived the previous ordeal, and refused to turn on. So I dumped it all into my Kitchen Aid and used the dough hook. I let the dough rise in an oiled bowl for about an hour, punched it down and then put it in a loaf pan. This time the bread was perfect! It looked like real bread--no holes on the bottom from the bread machine. I have made this several times since. The only change I make is to use 2T sugar, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups bread flour. It couldn't be any easier.

P.S. I threw out my bread machine.

Only having made bread with bread flour, I was curious to see what this loaf would be like with its two cups of all purpose flour. Using vegetable oil was a first for me too. I was very pleased! There is nothing not to like here; it's a moist, flavorful and tender sandwich loaf with just the right balance and measurements of salt, sugar and yeast. Great recipe!

I make this bread 2-3 times a week! The texture is great. I use the light crust setting.  Great for sandwiches. Sent a copy of this recipe along with a bread machine to my dad for Father's Day!

I made this last night and it did turn out good. Nice consistency.  I won't lie though, it didn't drive me mad with desire. I'm not sure I would make it again. Decent recipe though.

Good lord this is to die for! The only thing I did different was use all regular flour as I did not have bread flour. Just give me a knife and some butter and leave me alone with my bread... you gotta try this one!!

This is really good. I used the 3/4 cup water/ 1/4 cup of milk that another reviewer suggested and was happy with the results. This bread was the easiest to slice.

Wonderful recipe!  I took the advice of someone else as I had no powdered milk and it works wonderfully with regular milk.

This is the best bread recipe I have ever used!! We decided to start using the bread machine or throw it out.  Tested several recipes and this has become the family favourite.  We use Olive oil and sugar substitute.  And we make some loaves with multigrain flour instead of bread flour.    Recently started making just the dough, freezing it then take it out in the morning or night.  Leave in bread pan covered with a cloth.  After it rises, cook at 350* for approx 30 - 35 minutes.  This bread cuts beautifully and toasts perfectly without breaking apart when you butter it!! Don't waste your time searching for other recipes - just make this one.  Note- I make this with either active yeast or fast rising bread machine yeast. Both produced the same results.  If using active dry yeast, add it to the wet ingredients and let sit for a few minutes.  Regardless of the bread machine suggestions.  Enjoy!!!

When i first made this i took the suggestion of many others and increased the sugar to 1/3 cup.  I liked it, it had the perfect bread texture, but it was a bit on the sweet side.  So i went with the original recipe that ron had, except i added a smidge of honey.  OH man did that turn out perfect!!!!! Ron I have to say that that was the most beautiful bread i have ever made!!!! not too sweet, with perfect texture, and boy does it make one heck of a ham and swiss sandwhich!

This bread was delicious and simple. True to it's description, it lasted for longer than I expected (not that it needed to). I did make it with Splenda, but other than that, it's a no changer. Thank you! I will do this again.

This recipe makes a very good loaf of bread but I substitute olive oil for vegetable oil & add 1 Tbsp of finely groung peppercorns & 2 cups coarsly grated parmesan cheese (not canned) at the beginning of the last needing cycle to male the most amazing parmesan cracked pepper bread. The smell of a slice in the toaster is heavenly. Only real butter will do on this recipe!

This resembles the recipe that came with my bread machine. I doubled it and mixed in my stand mixer though. I think this was the best bread I've made! When I make this in my bread machine I don't recall it coming out this good. I think it's because my machine makes an abnormally shaped loaf that can't be cut the right way. If it's possible that the direction of the cut affects the taste/texture then that's it! I'll be making this for awhile! We used 1 loaf for dinner (grilled cheese with bacon and home-cured pork loin aka Canadian bacon) and the other loaf will be croutons for my daily lunch salads.

a great basic white bread recipe, i make this all the time now and rarely buy a loaf of bread.  i don't like the huge square bread machine loaf so use the dough cycle and bake it in the oven.

After trying many recipe's for breadmaker bread and being dissappointed everytime I was about to just give up on the breadmaker, thinking I just didn't like the product.  Too bad considering how east it seemed to make.  I decided to give it one more go - and this is the ticket!  I follow the recipe to a tee and have now made this quite a few times and am very pleased.  It doesn't get much easier than this.  The bread turns out great, it is softer than all the rest that I've tried.  ALL bread is great when it fresh and still warm, but this bread tastes great 2 days later....not that it normally lasts that long.  The only suggestion I can give is to set your crust setting on light, it turns out perfect and golden brown.  Enjoy - and don't store your breadmaker just yet - try this recipe first!

Ron, you are a baking god! This is the absolute best bread machine recipe I've ever found (I don't create recipes, thus my moniker, but I collect wonderful recipes).  We made this with minor alterations (due to lacking funds and exact ingredients), including using one medium egg instead of an extra large, and using all purpose flour throughout, but I truly doubt that they changed it much from the original.  It was so light, yet chewy...and the crust was perfect. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Oh my!! My first real review!!   Got a new machine, lost the booklet with recipes that came with...went online, found Ron's white recipe...it's THE best 'home made' bread I've ever had...EVER. The crust (not one of my favorite things) was phenomenal. I didn't even stick to the recipe! I made a few small blunders, but it still came out superb!! I will let you know that I heated the water/milk a bit in the microwave, added the yeast and (honey instead of the sugar), the salt and whisked it well, then added the egg and whisked some more! I put all of that in the machine, then added my flour!! I used ALL PURPOSE (didn't have bread flour) and turned on the machine....it was THAT easy!! Thank you Ron...on to some fruit bread next!!!!

No milk powder on hand??  Instead of using water and milk powder (which I rarely have), I just used a cup of milk.  Turned out great.  I also added extra sugar.

loved it... the crust was a bit to crusty, though, so perhaps the light setting on the bread machine would be better

I've been searching for the perfect bread machine recipe on this site, and I think this is it.  I really like the look and texture of this bread, and it seems chewier rather than crumbly, probably because of the milk powder and egg.  I used 1 c whole wheat flour and 2 cups all-purpose flour.  Try this out!

Outstanding! Like many others, I did increase sugar to 1/3 cup. Hubby said this is the best bread he has ever had.  Thanks Ron.

This turned out really good. I had to use 3 cups of all purpose flour because I didn't have any bread flour, and it still came out great, if just a little dense. I would recommend eating all on the day you make it though, since it dries out pretty fast.

One word: AMAZING! This bread was light and fluffy, but 'sticky' enough for sandwiches. This is my new white bread recipe. I will probably use this til the end of time!

I was pretty convinced that this wasn't gonna turn out in my machine-it wasn't looking very promising during first or second rise cycles(it rose just not like others I had made)but I decided to just ignore it and see what happened...and I peeked about 15 minutes before it was due to be done and to my amazement it was GORGEOUS!Cooked on 2 lb cycle and set for light crust and it ended up looking like the cover of a magazine!AND it is fantastic.I recommend it HIGHLY..tastes is fantastic-will impress!***took a loaf to my mom last night of this-she called today and asked from now on if she asked for bread if this would be the recipe I would make her(and this is a woman who does it all by hand)

This is a great recipe.  If you increase the sugar to 1/3 cup as suggested and use melted butter instead of oil it becomes perfect.  My whole family loves this bread.

EXCELLENT!  This is one of the best white bread loaf I have ever made...and I have made lots of them... The reason, I think, is the egg.  I added 2 Tablespoons of sugar instead of one..because of a review I read. All other measurements I followed exactly as listed.  (Be sure to take your yeast out of the fridge measure it into a little dish and let it warm up for 15 or 20 min. before you use it!)

I've made this recipe a couple times now and it works great for me. I have a Breadman Pro breadmaker and I cook is as a 4 pound loaf, even though it's not that big.

The only change I made to the recipe was that instead of using bread flour (I never have any on hand) I added 3 tablespoons of Bob's Red Mill Vital Wheat Gluten (1 Tbls per 1 c. flour). This addition makes all-purpose flour behave like bread flour -- more fluffy and more elastic.

I do have to keep an eye on this at the beginning to make sure that all the flour gets incorporated -- there is usually flour at the edge of the pan that isn't getting pulled into the dough ball. But scrape the edges with a soft spatula to get it pulled and we're good to go.

This loaf turns out with a nice crunchy crust. I let it cook to medium darkness and then I rub it with butter and wrap in in a towel right after taking it out of the pan to let it steam a couple minutes before cutting it. Inside that crispy crust is a soft, fluffy inside. It has a great texture that is easy to cut and isn't spongy with too many large holes through it.

I'm a fan. This is the only recipe I'll use for a basic white loaf.

This bread is absolutely perfect. Excellent crumb, beautiful crust, moist without being soggy, light but without large holes. Just beautifully delicious. This will be the bread I make every time. Just simply a perfect bread recipe.

I've been trying to find a bread that is favorable, easy, and you can cut it.  This bread was perfect.  It didn't last the rest of the day.  Friends came over and said it was the best 'non sourdough' bread they've ever had.  I did add a Tablespoon of honey  to the recipe, but kept everything else the same.  I'll have to make another loaf in the morning.

So far this is the best recipe I have tried. Since I didn't have powdered milk I put 1 cup of milk in and on the second loaf added 1/4 cup sugar. I like my bread a little sweeter. Overall very tasty!

I substituted white whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the all-purpose flour.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I used "dough" cycle and baked the loaf in the oven for easier slicing.  The loaf was beautiful, high and brown.  The crumb and texture were perfect, no crumbling or air bubbles.    It makes wonderful toast, and tasted better the next morning than it does hot from the oven.   I will definitely make this one again; maybe I'll try adding raisins and a little cinnamon or grated orange rind and dried cranberries.

Excellent recipe!!! I am super sensitive to soy and soy bi-products so have recently begun (again) baking my own bread, as almost everything on the grocer's shelves contains soy or soy bi-products. This recipe proved to be an excellent first choice. I decided to make a slight change the second time around, as I was out of "bread flour" and substituted regular self rising flour and as an experiment added a second egg, and instead of the vegetable oil (which often contains soy oil) I used light olive oil. I was very pleasently surprised with a very rich, light loaf of very tasty bread, with a wonderfully nutty light crust. I will use this recipe many times over.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I "proofed" the yeast first.  I usually bake bread in a pan in the oven but was rushed with other activities so left it to bake in the bread machine. It came out perfectly.  The flavor was really awesome.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I have made this bread several times and it is great!  I never have “bread” flour in my pantry.  I have made this bread with 3 cups of all purpose or two cups of all purpose and 1 cup of wheat.  I have also used crisco in the place of veg oil.  And I always use a bread machine adding the ingredients as they are listed in the recipe.  I will never use another bread recipe again.

I had no dried milk so I used 1/4 cup half and half with 3/4 cup warm water.  I do not use large eggs so I used a medium egg.  I used 2 Tablespoons of butter instead of oil along with 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Yes, sugar was also changed to 2 Tablespoons.  2 teaspoons active dry yeast. My bread turned out fluffy, flavorful and totally yummy!

This is our favorite bread. I start it in the bread machine and then transfer it to the convention oven  at 350 for 25 minutes. As soon as I take the bread out of the oven i brush it with olive oil to keep the crust soft. We also make hamburger and hotdog buns by separating into 12 portions and then baking in convection  oven 350 for 12-14 minutes. These can be pressed into in sesame, poppy seeds, onions, garlic or cheddar cheese before baking  for extra flavor. Nothing is better than fresh buns for sandwiches. The Buns don't fall apart!

Fantastic!! I substituted regular milk, instead of powdered milk; and 3 cups of regular flour, instead of 1 cup bread flour, 2 cups regular flour. PERFECTION!!

If using a bread machine, add all wet ingredients to your pan first, then add dry ingredients (except yeast). Make a small hole in the middle of the dry ingredients and add yeast. Do not get yeast wet - the machine will take care of that for you.

This is the best white bread recipe I've ever tried with our machine. I skipped the powdered milk and went with a half cup of water and half cup of milk. Instead of vegetable oil I used 2 tbsp of butter, but otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter. Perfect, tasty, not too sweet white bread. I will definitely be remaking this.

fabulous recipe-I put the breadmaker on the dough setting, then in a greased loaf pan. Let it raise another 30 minutes then bake at 350 for 30 minutes. It comes out tender and yummy and looks like a regular loaf of homemade bread. I don't buy bread anymore........

I exchanged powdered milk for liquid (and reduced the water), used King Arthur AP flour (it's high protein/gluten), and did an even exchange of oil to butter, and it turned out lovely! I think I had a touch too much liquid, as the bottom of the bread was slightly more dense than the top, and the top cratered a tiny bit, but I'm still learning my brand new bread machine, so it was prob user error.

So good!  Increase sugar to 1/3C, use 1/3C milk and 2/3C water in place of dry milk.  Make as dinner rolls, shaped into 12, baked in a buttered round cake pan.  Delish!

After finding this recipe, I no longer buy bread from the store.  I know the recipe by heart (I use 3/4 c. Water and 1/4 c. Milk) and it comes out awesome every time.  I make it so often that I think I may be wearing out my machine, which I got as a wedding gift in 2002!

This is the best bread machine recipe, I didn't have AP flour so used bread flour 2 cups of white and 1 cup of whole meal. I have made it completely in the machine and it worked perfectly soft tasty bread that lasted up to three days. I have also made to the dough stage and then let it prove in the loaf tin covered by a tea towel for 1 hour, and baked for 20/25 mins at 180 C fan oven, again a perfect loaf that lasts.

I used this recipe in my first ever attempt at using a bread machine and this was a huge hit with my family.. They gobbled this whole loaf up in single digit minutes..I had to make another loaf a few minutes later. I was so excited I even took some to work and my co-workers loved it... I have been making this recipe very often of course tweaking it to my personal liking. Not that the original is flawed... but my preference... This a definite keeper!!

We had this with our dinner this evening and it had a wonderful flavor and moist texture. I have tried other recipes that generally have turned out too dry or hard. This was soft and moist. After reading other reviews, I chose to add an additional Tbsp of sugar and it turned out great, not too sweet. It is a great recipe for toast, sandwich bread or bread to serve with a meal. I will definitely make this recipe again!!:) I wish I could post a picture put it is not allowing uploads at this time.

I enjoyed this loaf, but my wife wasn't so fond of it, so I adjusted it. 

First, I don't like the way things come out of the bread maker, so I use the mix cycle only.  After this cycle, I place in a warmed bread pan, and let rise for an additional 15  - 25 minutes.

I use 1 tbsp of canola oil in place of the veg oil.

My wife and daughter love it in this way.

I am beginner and used the Zoji breadmaker, basic program, medium crust for this recipe.  I followed it exactly with the measurements & ingredients.  While it is not a bread with a wow factor it is a nice solid recipe.  It came out in a good consistency.  Not crumbly and easy to slice.

This recipe is great.  I have to say, though, that I never bake bread in my machine.  Instead, I use the dough setting and then place it in two oiled bread pans to raise, then bake in my oven.  It makes excellent toast and sandwiches.

This is very good bread, but uses slightly more ingredients than other bread.  I added the yeast to water that was 110 degrees F for about 2-3 minutes before adding the other ingredients.  I also had to add more flour while the dough was in the bread machine because it way very, very sticky.  Once I added a few spoonfuls of bread flour, the dough felt fine.  I also upped the sugar to 1/3 of a cup, which makes the bread very sweet.  I might take it down a little the next time.  Overall, it was very good white bread!

I made this in my bread machine on basic setting. Dough was firmer than any dough I've seen and I've seen a lot of dough. The bread was a stale texture so I used it in a french toast casserole recipe which made the bread VERY useful. I would not use this for sandwich bread but I will use it when I have a recipe for stale bread and no other stale bread is around.

This bread was great. I did what another reviewer did and changed the sugar amount to 1/3 cup and that made the bread taste a little along the line of hawaiian sweet bread, which we love. But, I believe it would work quite well with just the 1T of sugar. It all depends on if you want your white bread a little sweet or not.

This was a nice soft loaf of bread that tasted great just with a bit of butter. I did sub milk for the water and added 3tbs of sugar. The egg also gives it a lovely golden color.

I have made this bread twice.  Absolutly delicious. Stays fresh for days which I love cause there are only 2 of us now.  I mixed it in the bread machine, but because it makes a 2 lb load, I followed anothers suggestion of letting it rise - punching down and letting it rise again in the loaf pan.  Then I baked it in a 350 degree convection oven for 20 minutes.  Best bread ever

This turned out wonderful... I didn't have bread flour, so I subed in whole wheat because that's what I had on hand.  Great texture and crust... I made mine on the dough cycle and baked it in the oven @ 375 for 20 minutes (I don't like the square shape of my bread machine pan).  I agree with other reviewers that it does need more sugar and I'd like to see it taller so I'll be experimenting with this recipe to see if I can get a bigger (taller) loaf.  Thanks, Ron!

Epic failure, and I followed the recipe exactly.  Not sure what happened, but it was a big disappointment :(

A good, all-purpose white bread recipe.  This didn't rock my world BUT it's so nice to find something a tad different.  It baked up perfect and I did add a bit more sugar then called for and am glad I did.  I will make again and put this baby in my recipe box.  THANKS FOR SHARING and I feel this is a total 5 star recipe....IMHO.

How could a recipe so simple be this good? If you like a crispy crunchy crust that is not too thick with a light and fluffy white inside..you will love this recipe! Entire house fought over slices.  I substituted olive oil for veggie oil - otherwise followed recipe to a T.  Very very good!!!

I always use regular white and/or wheat flour, instead of bread flour just sift it well, I use splenda instead of sugar, and splenda brown sugar to replace brown sugar when a recipe calls for it.(cut amount of splnda brown sugar used to 1/2 of what recipe calls for, and I use powered butter milk.  Excellent recipe the bread turned out so well I made more loaves to give away.

I made this bread exactly as written.  I thought my other bread machine recipe was good, and it is, but this is GREAT!  The bread was so soft and delicious!  We ate almost the entire loaf with dinner tonight.  This will be a regular recipe that I will use all the time.

I have been working my way through all the bread machine recipes on this site and so far this is my second favorite next to "Best Bread Machine Bread." This however has been my boyfriend's fave. This wasn't as light and fluffy as the BBMB, but the flavor was much more homemade tasting...now if I could combine the two with fluffiness of the BBMB(the technique didn't cross over when I tried) and the flavor of this. WOW!

This came out perfect! Great shape, great taste and good texture. I just have one question that applies to all machine breads: How do you keep them from drying out fast???? I still haven't figured that out. This was wonderful though, I tried another recipe the same day and this one was much better!

This bread is FANTABULOUS!!!! I have made several loaves and every time me, my husband and 3 kids gobble it right up!It's soft and scrum-diddly-umptious!! It reminds me of this bread we used to get at a restaurant back home in MI when we went christmas tree shopping...brings the memories right into my kitchen. I dont bake it in my bread machine after the dough cycle, I pour it into a greased bowl and let it rise for 40 mins and then punch it down. pour it onto a lightly floured surface and knead into a loaf shape, plop it in a loaf pan let it rise another hour and bake it for 25 mins at 350F. brush the top with butter and eat right away!comes out perfecto every time :) Thanks for this superb bread recipe!! It's a keeper!

This is a very tasty bread. I used milk instead of water to enrich it for my bread loving daughter. I didn't have dry milk-so I used coffee creamer! My family loves it and I am making it again for the second day in a row. We especially loved it for toast this morning.

The loaf was absolutely beautiful.  I made it exactly as described.  It had a nice texture as well, but the flavor was very bland.  It also did not seem to stay fresh very long as compared with the recipe that came with my breadmaker.

This bread was delicious. I made it for a luncheon with a couple of my co-workers. We used it to make BLTs and it was great. The only changes I made were: 1) substituting about 1/4 cup of the water for milk and omitting the powdered milk. 2) increasing the sugar to about 1/4 cup. 3) I just made the dough in the breadmachine, then let it rise for about 45 minutes, then brushed the top with melted butter and baked it on a pizza stone dusted with cornmeal at 375 for about 22 minutes. It was very good and had the perfect amount of sweetness.

Very good and easy recipe.  Made one loaf on Sat and another on Sunday.  Used the last of the first loaf tonight for some cheese toast to go with the tomato soup for dinner.  Very yummy.  Plan on making our staple bread.

I used all bread flour for this recipe and had to add about an extra cup to make the proper consistency. It rose a little too high for my machine so next time I will bake in the oven. But, WOW! Everything looked, tasted and smelled divine! Awesome recipe!

Pretty good and standard recipe... it actually cooked evenly in my bread machine (something that has not happened with any other recipe). I added warm water for the yeast, but kept the milk cold so the egg didn't cook before the flour was added. Good sandwich bread! I used small loaf setting w/ light crust.

This bread is pretty good, but not worth the extra ingredients when you can make a comparable white bread without milk and eggs.

Wasn't as Yeasty as we'd hoped, but was a delicious bread, and tasted great.  Will keep in the files!  It rose to a good consistency, not too airy, just about right.  Worked great for our breakfast caserole.

I made this recipe and found it excellent but I followed some recommendations from other reviewers and add more sugar. This, however is a recipe for an excellent loaf of bread and I have shared it with others who agree.

Very good bread. I added a little extra sugar after reading one of the reviews. It was good, but I'm going to add 1/3 cup sugar (instead of 1 tablespoon) next time I make it, since that is the perfect amount in our favorite bread recipe.

Makes a beautifully risen loaf with great texture- and it keeps well, but the taste wasn't quite all there for me.  I like a bit of sweetness and flavor to my breads perhaps.  I might keep this recipe and try again with a couple modifications.
...ok, I tried this recipe again, added more sugar, and added another star.

Delicious and soft! I added 1 tsp apple cider vinegar, used 2/3c water and 1/4c almond milk, used 1 Tbsp honey instead of the sugar, and 2tsp instant yeast.

I didn't have milk powder so I substituted 40ml of the water for milk, I added too much salt by mistake but it was still great. Crunchy golden crust and soft crumb. Saving this recipe.

Took suggestion to cut water to 3/4 cup and 1/4 cup milk and increase sugar to 1/3 cup. Bread had brioche texture, very delicious.

I made this bread tonight to go with sausage gravy. My husband loved the bread the flavor was not over powered by the gravy but held its own. I followed the recipe not changing the ingredients at all. I did hear my egg, water, and oil together in microwave for a short time to get them warm. I would say that this bread is a very big hit with my husband and I will fix it gain.

I was looking for a bread recipe that used all or some all purpose flour because I was really going through the bread flour since I make all of my breads and I fell upon this recipe and have made it a couple of times now and love it. Not the sandwich bread but toast it even a little and you can eat it with anything!!

Instead of powdered milk, I used 1/4 cup of whole milk with 3/4 cup of warm water. The bread is very crusty and fluffy - a delight! Also used the light crust setting.

I made it exactly to recipe and the rising of this white bread recipe was better than other recipes and it was with almost half of the yeast that is used in other similar white bread recipes. I like how the bread flour was cut with all purpose. The vegetable oil did come through in the taste so next time I'm gonna try and use the equivalent in soft butter.

I followed the recommendation to use 3\4 cup water and 1\4 milk, the first couple times i made i loved the taste, now I've begun to put my breadmaker on dough and rolling out the dough on the counter then rolling it up the dough and placing it in a 9 by 5 pan and letting it proof on the counter for 30-45 minutes, then scoring it 3 or 4 times. Then cooking in the oven at 350°F for around 20 minutes.

I took others advise and upped the salt to 2.5 t. the bread didn't fall and came out with a nice texture inside. I also added an extra T. of sugar as I like my bread slightly sweeter. 
The crust...I first set the bread makers crust to medium which was to hard, at least in my bread maker, but then made again with the crust setting on light and it was perfect for sandwich bread. Overall good bread.

Dug the bread machine out of the attic and found this recipe. Good texture and taste, super easy to make. I was sure to buy fresh bread flour and yeast before I started. Turned out great!  I’ll try more.

Beautiful! Light and fluffy! Followed exactly as written except used whole wheat instead of the  1 C bread flour. Only change would be to set machine to light crust next time. And there will be many next times!

I've made this recipe the only bread machine bread I make! I follow recipe exactly, only omitting salt, as I have to have minimal salt in my diet due to health reasons. What can I say??? I've made this bread dozens of times, PERFECT every time!! Smells great, tastes fabulous, and looks beautiful too! Ok, I'm excited, but it's that good! I don't buy bread in the store anymore. Thank you Ron!!! ??????

This is an exceptionally nice, white sandwich bread.  The texture is just perfect - not overly dense but with good texture for sandwiches.  Also very happy with the moisture content, it feels like it will indeed keep for a bit longer than most home made bread does without drying out.

Update:  So, this loaf does indeed "keep" way, way better than most home made breads.   The first time I made it I did have to add about 3/4 cup of flour but I thought maybe I had mis-measured.  The second time I had to add a half cup.  So, that might be the size of the egg differences.   Watch your loaf while kneading.   

I was looking for a cinnamon bread loaf and couldn't find one with reviews I was happy with so I upped the sugar content on this one by adding two tablespoons of brown sugar and then a tablespoon of cinnamon.  It made a lovely cinnamon bread loaf too.  

This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I made this bread to give a gift, and the recipient loved it.  It made a very light, pretty, high loaf.  She said it was delicious.

This is the second loaf of bread I've made on the Dak machine I recently got. A few noteworthy changes I made, not because I thought the recipe wasn't good enough, but because I was curious. I did 1 cup whole wheat bread flour and 2C AP flour. Also didn't have dry milk powder, so I put just a tad bit of whipping cream in with my water to make a total of one cup. (It's all we had in the house). Oh yes, and used instant yeast instead of active dry. Probably would not have made a difference. Cooked it up on the white bread setting, and voila...yummy, good bread. Thanks.

This made the best bread I've gotten out of the Oster yet. I was out of fresh eggs so I subbed in Ener-G egg replacer. I followed the instruction to use the medium setting for the crust even though in the past I've gotten better results out of light crust from that machine. I'm glad I listened, because medium crust turned out perfect! This recipe is a keeper.

Just got my maker and the 1st loaf I made came with the machine. Uh, yeah, I won't do that again. But it did provide some good guidelines. My 2nd loaf was Ron's recipe and wow! I am now a bread making fool.. Thanks for the recipe. My taste buds are very grateful; my cholesterol, not so much.. :-)

I've tried this recipe several times now, and can say it comes out perfect each time, no matter how much I mess it up (I don't like to measure, weight, wait, and my tablespoons are always missing when I need them). The loaf disappears as soon as it comes out of the machine, kids and adults all come to the cutting board and devour it scorching hot before it makes it to the table.  The crust is crunchy but not too much. The inside is soft and just crumbly enough, but with just enough elasticity to cut with a knife without breaking too much.  It toasts deliciously as well.

hubby and I had this tonight with  chicken over a garden salad. I adjusted it a bit to suit our health requirements I.e no salt and 1//2  quantity of sugar, I used just a pinch of Splenda crystals. We need more roughage so I substituted  1/2 cup of breakfast oats for 1/2 cup of flor. tasted really nice, good flavor and will be great as piadinni  sandwiches. Will definitely make this again.

This was the 4 loaf I've made with my new bread machine. It was delicious. I didn't change anything. I was worried that it would dry out because my husband couldn't wait more than 10 minutes to dig in. However, entire loaf was gone in 20 minutes. We enjoyed it with Haitian style cinnamon oatmeal. Will definitely be my white bread of choice.

This is the best Bread Machine Bread recipe I've tried so far. In fact, I am making another loaf right now! I am not an avid baker. However, this recipe is so simple. The bread comes out looking perfect and tastes exquisite! I followed the recipe except I did not have powdered milk. So, I substituted 1/4 cup of water for 1/4 cup of liquid milk. The bread came out perfectly.

This bread is really awesome! I didn't bake it in the bread machine - I made dough and put the dough in a loaf pan to rise for about 20 minutes and baked it in a 350 degree oven. It made a huge beautiful loaf - nice soft texture. This is my go-to keeper bread recipe! Thanks Ron :)

Loved it! I have been searching for a bread recipe for years. My husband hasn't liked anything, until this recipe! The only thing I did was exempt the the sugar (that's just because my husband doesn't like anything sweet). It was great! He wants me to make more this morning

Wonderfully easy, super tasty. We made a large salad for dinner and I had just tried this recipe for the first time. Turned out to be a great dinner combo. I cannot comment if it lasted well or as good as regular store bought bread because our loaf is all gone. Gonna make another one right now though. Great recipe!!!

This is going to be my go-to recipe from now on! I have had my bread machine for a couple of years now and had pretty much given up on making a bread that wasn't a hockey puck or a door stop.  I tried this recipe today and out came the most amazing bread! A success, finally!  It is delicious and just the right texture, not too light for a white bread. I think it might be the added egg that makes the difference. I'm so glad that I finally have a bread I can trust that I am not embarrassed to serve. Good job!

This bread was yummers, with a lighter texture than many bread recipes I've tried. I didn't change anything except to use all purpose flour exclusively, since I don't have bread flour. I've also tried with partial whole wheat flour (replacing one cup) and it is still fluffy delicious goodness. Thanks, Ron!

The best white bread recipe I have used. It stays fresh for longer than any others I've tried, and is always soft and moist. This makes a perfect loaf of plain, white bread.

I have never made bread before in my life , but enjoy it greatly with melted butter. Thanks to Ron's recipe I have successfully made two beautiful loaves so far and plan on using Ron's white bread recipe over and over again. Thanks Ron... yours truly Breadlover...

This was the first recipe that was successful in my bread machine. The crust is crispy and the inside is so soft and chewy. Yummy!!!!! I think that this will be my recipe for white bread from this point on. I did add 1/3 cup sugar as other reviews suggested, but no other changes.

I made this for my family and it was gone within an hour of cutting it!! The loaf had a crunchy crust with a soft interior. One thing should be noted-- I had to add 2 tbsp of flour because the loaf was very wet. Other than that, this is the perfect basic white bread. I'll definitely make this again and again!!

Followed the recipe exactly twice and failed both times :-( and the bread is super salty but that could be because it didn't raise or anything.  And yes I was sure to separate the salt and yeast from one another and yes the yeast is fresh.  It just didn't work for me.  Off to find another recipe.

We make bread all the time, but our kids won't use it for sandwiches (which they eat every day).  Until we found THIS bread -- which does the trick!  It holds together without crumbling and can be sliced thin enough for a sandwich.  Not to mention it tastes great. We only put the egg whites in (we eliminate the yolks to cuts down on fat and cholesterol) and it works just as well.

I have been trying to find a white bread recipe for my bread maker that was as light and spongy as a store bought sandwich loaf, without all the unnatural preservatives inherent in store bought bread. This is it!  This loaf rose to an impressive height, while not being too tall. It is light without being too airy. It is spongy without being like glue. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. I now finally have my default white loaf!

It was great! My family ate it all up!  I did like others that didn't have powdered milk - I substituted with really milk.  So instead of the 2tbsp powdered milk and 1 cup of water, I used slightly over 3/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of milk.  Can't wait to make it again!

This is the Greatest recipe, now my go to recipe for white bread. It makes a very tender, tasty bread, rises very well, uses less Bread flour and yeast than most recipes and overall makes a better bread. I do not make the loaf in the bread machine, just use it to do the mixing, etc. (dough cycle). An all-round wonderful bread. Thanks, Ron.
Just thought I'd add I made cheese onion bread this week  Mar. 2011)  1 cup sharp cheddar, 1/3 cup Parmesan, 3 tbsp dry minced onion. Really good. Oh and I use olive oil or grape seed oil and honey instead of sugar. This recipe was used for communion at our old church, served by breaking bread and dipping in juice.  Really enjoyed by all.

This recipe was great, I didn't have the milk so I replaced it with sugar (not sure why it worked but it did) and replaced one cup of flour with whole wheat flour. The bread cam out perfect, soft and yummy. My 2 year old loves it!

I followed this recipe exactly but I also added some minced garlic, basil and oregano and this was the best recipe thus far for making bread ina bread machine. This was the first 2 lb loaf I made but the size of the loaf was the same as my 1.5 lb loaves. The texture was great. I did add about 2 tsp of flour during the second kneading (per my machines's trouble shooting guide) as the dough felt a little too tacky. I will definitely use this as my basic recipe. I think the egg must have been what made the difference. So moist and tender, easy to cut. I used the light crust selection on my maker. I took this to a church BBQ for Memorial Day and cut into litle chunks and made an olive oil with oregano and ground multicolored pepper for dipping. Everyone raved. Thanks for a great recipe! I may add an entire package of yeast next time. I do live at 6244 ft altitude and that may have made a difference as to why it did not rise higher than I expected.

I've made this bread several times, and I have not ever had to revise it. It's a wonderful bread that really does last for several days. Other breads last for a day or two at the most, but this one stays moist and delicious even longer.

Cool recipe. The addition of the egg makes this recipe unique and extra awesome.  I like my bread rich and buttery so I made a few changes.  Instead of water i used warm milk. Instead of 1 egg I used 1/4 c egg product. instead of 1 T white sugar, I used 1/4 cup confectioners sugar. Instead of 2 T oil, I used 1/4 cup butter. Everything else I left basically the same: 3 cups flour, 1 1/2 t salt, 1 1/4 t yeast but then added an extra 1/4 t yeast. I let the yeast sit in the warm milk for about 5 minutes then mixed everything together in the bread maker! Pulled it out about 10 minutes early cuz I like my bread my chewy soft and underbaked. My family loved the flavor and texture of this bread. Ive made bread-maker-bread lots of times and my mom said this time was the best Ive ever made it.

This was the very first recipe I tried in my new bread machine and it turned out very well. I did substitute 1/4 cup of milk for the powdered milk and I reduced the amount of water to 3/4 cup to compensate. The only thing I'd do differently is to use the light crust setting instead, as my crust turned out rather thick and hard, but it still tasted really good. Thanks for the great recipe!

I increased the sugar from 1tbsp to 1/4 cup. The bread, freshly baked was delicious and had just the right amount of sweetness. The fluffy and soft flesh was great. I don't know why, but the crust (the parts that touched the bread machine) were slightly thicker and very chewy - to the point where my jaw hurt by chewing on a big mouthful of it. It tasted much better in smaller portions or dunked in some warm milk. Maybe it's my breadmachine that's the problem. 
The crust at the top (where it didn't touch anything) was perfect and golden. After a day, it was still delicious, but had lost some of its fluffiness.

I made this as written yesterday and everyone absolutely loved it.  Not too sweet but sweet enough.  It'll definitely be a staple for us.
