Just a note here,
Peoples pies were probably runny because one package of pudding mix requires 2 cups of liquid. This recipe has more than half a cup extra. No more than 4 cups liquid should be used. ie: 2 1/2 cups milk and 1 1/2 cups pumpkin. (12 oz)
This will give you a nice firm pie.

This is a very quick, easy recipe to make that has everything going for it - low fat, low calorie, higher fiber than a typical dessert, very filling and two very enthusiasic thumbs up rating from hubby. The only reason it did not get a five star rating, was due to texture and pumpkin flavor being a bit overpowered by the spices. I modifed the recipe slightly to include 1 packet of unflavored gelatin diluted in 1 cup of boiling water, which was then added to the pumpkin mixture, for a pie slice that holds together a little better, and a 1/4 cup of sugar/splenda to mellow the spices. 
Excellent pie though! Will make again:).

This recipe is FANTASTIC! My whole family are pumpkin pie lovers, and this really hit the spot without the fuss of baking! 
One word of advice use a Name-brand pumpkin or make sure that what you use is well drained or it will turn out like pumpkin soup in a crust.

I made it with only 2 cups of 2% milk and left it in the fridge all day.  Mine turned out fine like that.  A little rich, though. I would make it again.

Fast and easy to prepare. Tastes wonderful for a low fat and sugar desert.

Last night was Thanksggiving and I made this pie for my family.  I made it on Wednesday to get it out of the way, I covered it and refrigerated it just as the recipe directed.  When I carried it into the dining room after our Thanksgiving meal and removed the cover with anticipation, I was devestated to find a gooey, runny mess in the pie crust.  We had to dish it up in bowls and plop our cool whip onto what looked like watery sand.  The filling tasted okay, but it just wasn't pie.  This was my first Thanksgiving home from college and my first attempt to prepare a holiday dish for my family and the fact that the recipe doesn't work was quite a let down.

I really wanted to love this pie, but it was ok at best.  Was not set up and very hard to serve.  More the consistency of pudding.  If I ever make it again, I'll layer it in parfait glasses and not put in a pie tin.

I made this for the first time on Thanksgiving for my friend's diabetic father. He absolutely loved and said he would not eat any other sugar-free pies but mine.

I love this recipe.  I go with no more than two cups of fluid total just as people have suggested and it works great.  Even if it doesn't set quite right, it has always been servable and very much enjoyed.

THIS PIE WAS AMAZING!!! Even my dad who claims he "doesn't like pumpkin pie" loved it! We made it for Thanksgiving and everyone in my family says I HAVE to make it this Christmas. Great recipe. Thanks!

There is WAY too much clove in this recipe! It totally eclipses all of the other flavors. Also, we could really taste the bite of the sugar free pudding, even with all of that clove. I think that half the clove, and maybe some Splenda might make it better in the future. As is, just not anything to get excited about.

I made this recipe to take to a friend's house for dessert.  I followed the instructions exactly and it was a runny mess....it didn't set up!  Thank goodness I also brought a traditional pumpkin pie or dessert would have been a disaster.
