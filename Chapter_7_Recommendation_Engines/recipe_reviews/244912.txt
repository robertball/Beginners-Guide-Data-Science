Tastes INCREDIBLE! The first time I made it I added 2 eggs (I don't know why) and also didn't drain the soaked bread enough so I ended up with a delicious meat pancake. hahah. But today I made it perfect and can't wait to eat it in a few minutes when it's done baking! :)

Oh my goodness, this is so delicious! I followed the recipe as directed (I've never soaked my bread in milk like that but have since seen it in other recipes). My husband can't wait for me to make it again. Yum!

I have to admit, this is the first time I've followed a receipt to the T. I need to do this more often. This dish was so amazing, we'd made two to share with our single friend....we ended up keeping it, and was gone in 2 days. This is a great, great dish.

not a huge fan of ground turkey, but this was good!  made it twice in one weekend.  i didn't really measure my ingredients, just used what i wanted of each, and added more seasonings to my taste.  came out great!

My family LOVED this meatloaf.  It was moist and they enjoyed the flavor.  This recipe will definitely be a regular at our table.  I didn't have the worcestershire sauce so this ingredient was left out.  Even still a smash hit!
