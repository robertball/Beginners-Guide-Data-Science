This recipe started when I had a cooked leftover pork tenderloin to use up and this recipe was the perfect start. The only change I made was I didnâ€™t wrap in the fat casing but instead decided to bind them like a crab cake or chicken croquettes. 
So I mixed in a few eggs, bread crumbs, and mayonnaise and shredded cheddar cheese and these were absolutely delicious.
