I followed this recipe as is but next time I will make a change. I loved the taste of the shrimp which was stir-fried with garlic and ginger but the tofu was very tasteless. Next time, I will stri-fry the tofu with the shrimp to give it more flavor and firmness. But this recipe is a good start to something great.

Hey...this was surprisingly good!..lol  More like 4.5 stars.  I doubled the shrimp (I used bigger ones and cut them into thirds).  After the soup was finished and heated through I added some fresh cilantro, and about 3/4 t. liquid smoke. 

It was even better the second day! Next time I'll up the ginger, garlic, and have some fresh cut green onions on hand for a topping.   

It was also a recipe that was easily converted to a Weight Watchers recipe.  Made with fat free chicken broth it was only 2 pts per serving!!

This was very easy and tasted great!  I made this for my grandmother, and because she can't swallow large pieces I chopped the shrimp into smaller, bite sized pieces, which worked out great for the kids too.  The only other change I made was that I doubled the cornstarch. (I liked the soup a little thicker.)  We ate it over white rice, and everyone, including the kids liked it.  My husband says it's a keeper.  (And that's saying a lot.)  Thanks for the great recipe!

My kids ate TOFU!! Everyone loved this! I'm glad I read the reviews, otherwise I wouldve used rice vinegar. I found rice wine next to the cooking wines at my local market. Make sure you use fresh ginger (smelled amazing) and firm tofu. I added scallions and served w/white rice and soy sauce

DELICIOUS! I added chopped leeks to the soup (just the green parts) and more green peas. I used a can of small shrimp that had been cooked, rather than uncooked shrimp, and the taste was great. Thank you!

Delicious. Husband and I both enjoyed. Didn't have ginger on hand - used Chinese 5 Spice blend. Used reviewer's suggestion to stir fry the tofu. Added nice flavour. Finished with a handful of fresh cilantro from our garden and served over white jasmine rice. Looking forward to the leftovers for lunch.

This recipe was just wonderful!
Instead of the peas I used a little bit of cabbage. I let the cabbage cook with the broth, I skipped on the starch. It still turned out great. My two and four year old loved it, so it is a keeper. Thanks!

I found this recipe very bland, so I decided not to serve to my guests.  I later added noodles, broccoli, and an asian spice packet I had gotten at an asian store.  My husband and sons ate the whole thing up immediately.

Easy and tasty.  A great weeknight meal that is healthy and satisfying.  I added a handful of sliced mushrooms, which I would do again.  I also used precooked shrimp, thawed them out with the oil and garlic ginger mix, then cut them into spoon sized pieces.  Use firm tofu...embrace this - it's tasty and much less expensive than meat!

Great recipe! It is easy, quick and light. I would recommend sauteeing the tofu with the shrimp and adding a bit of cayenne in the soup for a little kick. Also, i add some greens such as beans or cut up spinach to help add nutrition.

the idea of the soup was great but I felt it needed more flavor in the broth than just chicken stock. I added some soy sauce some additional garlic powder and a generous squirt of sriracha hot chili sauce. I also added frozen spinach to the soup and it was quite delicious.

This is a great, easy recipe that my 8 yer old loves to make - and our family loves to eat!. A few changes we've made: 1. excluded the ginger (family doesn't like it) 2. excluded the peas (family doesn't like it) 3. add sliced mushrooms to the broth 4. add cilantro to the broth 5. add a pkg of rice noodles 10 minutes before serving

I love ginger and this was gingertastic! I agree you may need to add more then the recipe calls for. And yes add the tofu with the shrimp for more flavor. I also added cumin and coriander powders to the stir fry and red pepper flakes instead of salt. I am a broth lover and the amount of cornstarch was just perfect for me! My boyfriend doesn't eat seafood so I will try it with chicken maybe next time. YUM YUM.

This recipe is so yummy and fast!  I didn't have the exact ingredients, so here is my interpretation: frozen shrimp rather than fresh, frozen broccoli rather than peas, and ground ginger rather than ginger root.  I also added: small can of mushrooms, minced onion, chives, cilantro, and dash of chili powder, and I did not add the corn starch.  I'm sure the basic recipe would have stood well on it's own, but I like to add my own twist to things. :) It was very filling, very healthy, and very tasty!

This soup is quick to prepare, tasty, & healthy.  I've made it several times now and usually substitute cabbage shreds for the peas, although this last time I used both.  I also adjust the salt level with Tamari soy sauce (instead of regular salt) and prefer a thicker consistency with double the cornstarch.

This was a really great base to work with.  I sauteed beet greens and stems with twice the amount of garlic and ginger called for, and omitted the peas. 1t of salt makes the soup very salty and overpowers the spices, so I used 1/4t salt.  More can be added at the table.  I also added a can of water chestnuts -- many variations can be made to this great start.

I pretty much followed this recipe. I only had cooked shrimp, so I marinated it in chile sauce and hot chili oil and added it at the end. Added scallions and cabbage. Used firm, pressed tofu, but forgot to marinade it- bland. I did stirfry it in place of the shrimp. It was great.

This was wonderful! I used more garlic, shrimp and tofu and omitted the ginger (we're not fans). I cooked the shrimp and garlic in sesame oil and used soy sauce to add flavor to the soup. I didn't have any peas so used some corn and spinach. It was restaurant quality!

I followed the recipe, then added canned baby corn for extra crunch (cut into chunks)chopped scallions and cilantro. I would have included sliced water chestnuts as well, but didn't have any on hand. Also added a few dashes of chili-sesame oil and very little white pepper for a kick. The original recipe was slightly bland for my taste, but with the additions the soup turned out pretty good!

The reason im giving this only 3 stars isnt cause its bad. But for me it was very bland by itself. This was a great starting point for something great. After the additions i made it was easily 4 stars.   I took the advice of the previous reviews and saute the shrimp + tofu in the garlic + ginger.   3 large cloves of garlic (instead of 2)  8 oz shrimp (instead of 6) olive in place of vegetable oil  I added:  2 large handfuls of bean sprouts 3 green onions sliced 1 teaspoon rice vinegar 2 tablespoons seasame oil 3 tablespoons soy sauce dash of red pepper dash of cheyenne pepper  served with edamame   delicious!

I made the recipe as is and, although it was good, it was a little bland. I agree with the other reviewers about stir frying the tofu, adding green onions and cilantro. This was my first time using tofu & it wasn't bad. Even my husband went back for seconds and he likes very flavorful foods. Thanks for the recipe!!

I really liked this.  I slightly increased the ginger, and b/c I'm not crazy about peas I used escarole instead.  I also stir-fried the tofu with the shrimp.  I have also made this soup with diced chicken breast instead of the shrimp and it is great!

Easy and good.  I didn't have tofu or peas so I threw some black beans and broccoli.  Served over brown rice.

This recipe was my first time with tofu.   I followed exactly but I will likely make a couple of changes the next time I try this.   I will cut back on the salt, maybe by about half.  Also, I've been told that tofu takes on the flavor of the food it is cooked with, which I didn't find the case in this recipe.   I just don't think it was a part of the whole dish long enough to get those flavors.   As some suggest, I may stir fry it next time, and yes, there will be a next time.   The rest of the dish is fantastic.   The ginger/pepper/garlic mix is perfect.   I questioned using black pepper instead of white, but the black was definitely the way to go.   Thanks for a great first time and this gives me a great start.

Quite tasty, but I did follow the advice of others and upped the garlic. I also added mushrooms.

Needed to spice up quite a bit. I don't really like bland food and I thought it was bland. Liked the healthy aspect of it.

I love this!  I made this last minute and unexpected, based on what I had on hand. The only thing I was short on was fresh ginger, and didn’t want to run to the store for just that. I did however have ginger paste. It was a great substitute and blended well into the recipe. It was a nice soup to eat with an upset stomach and great for leftovers.

Very quick and easy soup. As mentioned in past reviews, I fried the tofu along with the shrimp. 1/2 tsp of pepper is too much - I'll use 1/4 tsp next time. I also added some Maggi sauce to it. Tasty!

I cooked the shrimp and tofu together as other reviewers suggested. This was so flavorful and delicious my 10 year old came back for seconds. It's a great base and you can change up the ingredients to suit your tastes. Next time I'll add water chestnuts and more vegetables.

It was GREAT! The only thing, your picture showed noodles so I added about 2 cups of cooked Chinese noodles. I pre cooked them so they didn't affect the rest of the recipe. Really nice flavor. I added this recipe to my favorites!

White pepper, not black makes a big difference.
Add additional cornstarch for body and texture. Try 1-2 tsp more at first.
Sliced scallion for garnish before serving.

This is a very tasty and simple soup to pair with a stir-fry dinner. I used frozen shrimp meat and that worked great. Also, I used extra ginger to give it a bit more zing...

I just made this soup today and it is FABULOUS!!  Super easy to make, so tasty, lots of flavor.  This was my first attempt at using tofu so I followed some of the tips from previous cooks.  I sauteed the tofu with the shrimp in the garlic and ginger.  I did not have ginger root so I used ground ginger - about 1 tsp.  I also used more minced garlic than called for.  I added sliced green onions, white mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, fresh spinach and substituted fresh sugar pea pods for the peas.  This soup is so incredibly delicious!  I will most definitely make this again!

Excellent item.  We made it as a side soup but made it our main meal.  Added spinach to the mix ten minutes before serving and made it with vegetable stock instead of chicken.  Used baked teriyaki flavored tofu and it was delicious.

I grated the ginger (I keep mine in the freezer, which makes grating easy) and substituted Chinese greens and broccoli slaw for the peas. I also added enoki mushrooms, used size 31/40 shrimp and added an extra pint of broth. I didn't bother thickening with cornstarch. It worked out beautifully!
