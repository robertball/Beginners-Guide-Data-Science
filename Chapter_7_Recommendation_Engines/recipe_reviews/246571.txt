Enjoyed this salad very much. Changes:  increased the fruit-to-barley ratio, minced the red onion, did not cook the onion, and ate the salad cold. I thought the mustard in the dressing was way too prominent when first mixed, but fine after a few hours in the refrigerator. (I frankly can't imagine eating this warm, upon mixng, but that may just be a personal taste.)  I'm getting my appetite back following a stem cell transplant and I need to pack a lot of nutrients into what I do eat. My latest 'craving' is pasta salad, so I've been replacing grains for pasta in old recipes and trying new grain salad recipes. This one is definitely a keeper!

Trying to eat more grains & made this yesterday. The only changes I made were extra raisins, cranberries & almonds because I didn't have apricots. I liked, picky husband didn't. 
If I make it again, I will add garlic, celery and walnuts instead of almonds as others have suggested. It's a good base, better the next day.

I substituted balsamic vinegar for the honey mustard and left out the cider vinegar and salt. Very good!!

I was unsure about this recipe at first but was willing to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised. I thought the ratio of all the parts was pretty even. I toasted the almonds on the stove instead of waiting for the oven to heat up, which saved time. As mentioned by another review, I also thought the dressing was very salty on its own, however, once it is all mixed together the flavor is very subtle.

The dressing alone was very acidic and salty, but when added to the very bland barley it evened out.  I would like more onion to up the flavor a notch, or maybe leave the onion raw for stronger flavor and crunch.  Also, I might prefer bacon pieces on top rather than the almonds, but that would make it less healthy.

All the ingredients sounded great, but the whole salad just didn't taste right, like the flavors didn't blend.
