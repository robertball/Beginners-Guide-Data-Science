I enjoyed this...It was a nice change from your typical salad.  I added a little thinly sliced red onion to balance out the tart.  Next time I might add a little Feta or Goat Cheese.  A little of this goes a long way so keep that in mind when making the full amount..I think it serves more like 12 people.

I don't think it really needed the olive oil, but otherwise I liked it and will make it again.  I did add a bit of sliced red onion.  It was good without it, but better with it.  Also, the serving size is pretty generous, so keep that in mind. I made a fourth of the recipe, and instead of serving two people it could have easily served four.

This was delish... a really good way to incorporate grapefruit, especially if you don't particularly like it! I did change a few things... I added shrimp (suggested on a different recipe) and used Trader Joe's Rio Red Grapefruit juice instead of Orange juice. Also, I added Lemon Pepper and a little salt. Delicious!

Love this salad! As is, or add some lettuce, nuts, sesame seeds, anything, avocado and grapefruit just go well together. The "dressing" is perfect on green and fruit salads too. Great recipe Sugar-n-Spice, thank you!

I didn't have enough grapefruit to make it as written for everyone, so I made a traditional green salad and added the grapefruit and avocado, along with a bit of diced red onion.  The dressing makes this salad!  I could drink it, that's how good it is.  This is such a nice change, thank you!

The red grapefruit is so sweet right now in TX, just cut out the honey and added a few chili flakes.   Delicious, healthy and light.

Nice comb. Salad dressing just right. Yeah, you'll add more stuff to the salad once you've had it because you a foodie but to start you off, it's great.  Thanks sugar-n-spice, it is a great change up from the other salads.

Made no changes other than to reduce the amount of servings. The man devoured it and wanted something to sop up the dressing! It was quite delicious. Making it again now that I looked up how to peel grapefruit sections quickly and without tearing them into pieces.

Delicious light dressing.  I drizzled it over the Jasmine rice I served with the salmon I prepared with this meal.  Was perfect with that, too.

Made this tonight over a bed of romaine, added pistachios. Thinly sliced red onions are a must. Also added a little Dijon mustard to the dressing. Pomegranate seeds would be fun too. It was awesome - a keeper. Served with chicken on the grill and rice, but would go great with shrimp. Definitely making again. This made a huge amount, enough for lunch leftovers, and plenty of dressing for another time.

I made this for dinner tonight it was so good! I served it as a side to my baked chicken thighs and cheesy shells. I ended up using just three grapefruit and two avocados wich worked great. I put a squeeze of lime juice and salt and pepper. I didnt have honey, and I left out the oil as some suggested, didnt think the juice was necessary so I didnt add that, but it still was an awesome side dish that even my picky husband loved :)

This was a hit with the whole family.  I made it true to the recipe.  Next time, I will use less oil and a little more honey and lime as a personal preference.  Yummy!

Made as is and will again. Added feta as a pass around and everyone enjoyed it that way.
