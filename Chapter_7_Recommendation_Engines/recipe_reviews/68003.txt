Being latin I have tried many different Chimichurri recipes, I added lots more garlic, lots more Parsley and half the salt.

SOOOOO AMAZING!!!!  I made this dipping sauce today to go with a roasted chicken recipe on here- but I did change it a bit... I didn't have fresh parsley but since I always have (and love) fresh cilantro I used that instead- I figured it would compliment the cumin nicely and it was SOOOOO GOOD!  Everyone LOOOOOVVVVEED it!!!  I'll try the parsley but the cilantro was so delicious I know I'll use that again.  Thank you! :)

I made this as written except I used cilantro (and plenty of it) instead of regular parsley. It is very good and stores well in the fridge.

We also served it with the Simple Whole Roasted Chicken recipe that everyone else raved about. It was very good although it somewhat obliterated the nice flavor of the chicken.

I've heard chimichurri referred to as the Argentinian equivalent of ketchup, so I have been trying it on different things. We've had it on steak - excellent. I've used it on sandwiches - excellent.

It seems to be a very good all purpose sauce.

I'll have to try it with the parsley one of these days.

This recipe needs a lot of work. Use 1 bunch of fresh Parsley, minus stems. Use 1 bunch cilantro with the stems. Use 1/2 red onion, and 2 cloves fresh garlic. Nix the cumin, dried oregano and add some lemon juice and the recipe is golden.

CookinCowgirls Rock!  I live in Mexico and there are an abundance of Argentinian restaurants serving Chimichurri Sauce.  None, and I mean None, serve a better sauce than this.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks!

I made this to go with the Simple Roasted Chicken Recipe that was recommended and it blew my wife away.   The first time I made the Chicken dish on its own and my family still enjoyed it.  However, this time was special thanks to the Chimichurri sauce.
  My wife was laughing with excitement.  I threw in chopped carrots and cauliflower together with the chicken and they were great having been marinated in the juices from the chicken and the ingredients.  After I advised my wife and father-in-law to spread the sauce, of which they were curious as to what it was, it was OVER!
Thank you, this recipe is a definite mind-blowing keeper.

Yummy!  I had been looking for something yummy to serve with my grilled chicken.  I did add a little extra parsley and garlic.  I also chopped up some green onion as well and added them.  Taste just like the sauce we got in a Brazilian restaurant we have visited.

I tried this recipe and found it a very good match for my tastebuds.  Although I liked it very much, not ALL of the family did.  That is just a difference in people, NOT because it is a bad recipe.

Love. I did listen to other reviewers and did half cilantro and half parsley. I used a Louisiana hot sauce and up'd the garlic. It is an amazing sauce. I served over flank steak with caramelized onions - perfection.

I used italian parsley, 4 garlic cloves, 1 tsp of red pepper flakes instead of pepper sauce (could have used a bit more) and it was the hit of the party.  I blended all of the ingredients except for the parsley first and hand chopped the parsley.  Then I added the parsley and pulsed for a bit until incorporated.

ok, I'm not sure if this is the chimichurri sauce that INDRIANI  said she served with her Allrecipes recipe for Simple Whole Roasted Chicken, but it's the one I chose to make and serve with it.  WOW!  I have made her chicken recipe several times since I discovered it and this chimichurri sauce takes it up a notch!   It added such a nice, fresh element to the dish!  SO glad she suggested it!!!! Thanks, INDRIANI !!!!!!!

OK, everyone is going to think this is weird, but I had this sauce at an Argentinian restaurant, but they did not use it for meat.  Try dipping crusty french bread into it.  I'm an bread and olive oil fan and this recipe lends itself perfectly for that.

I was looking for low-carb/low-sugar sauces/marinades for meat and decided to try this as it fits the bill.  DEEEElicious!  
I've used this as a "paste" to encrust pork chops and tenderloin, chicken and beef ribs.  All were great.  I even put a big spoonful in omelets & scrambled eggs.  Try a spoonful in tuna salad instead of relish.  Wow!  Whatever you can imagine, you can put Chimichurri Sauce on it.

Sauce? Dipping?  This makes WONDERFUL salad dressing! Toss it into a chopped green salad and add nuts, seeds and what have you.

I can't get enough of this stuff. It's great on everything! I don't add as much cumin as it calls for - I like the fresh taste of all the parsley. I think I've been adding about half the amount of cumin, and it is still delicious and flavorful.

Consistently excellent! This is our favorite sauce to make for summer grilling when we don't do Korean BBQ. We've made this as written and also with cilantro and basil instead of parsley and it turns out great every time. Highly recommended!

I used cilantro and 1/2 cup basil to suite my families taste.  For those who haven’t ever made this sauce you DO use the stems, it adds a nice texture.  I also added 2 tablespoons of lemon and pepper to taste.

I had brought Trader Joe's Chimichurri Salmon a few weeks ago and loved it! I went back for more and there was none in stock and they don't expect a new shipment for at least two weeks. I was so disappointed but I really wanted the dish again soon. I decided to buy some salmon and make the sauce myself. I used the tweaked recipe below to marinade and top the fish. It was wonderful! My grilled salmon was so tasty. I plan to try it with steak next. Thanks for the recipe!

Changes: 
I omitted the cumin. 
I decreased a few things: I used 6 tbsp EVOO, 1/2 tsp of sea salt, 2 tsp of dried oregano, and I substituted a pinch of white pepper for the black pepper. 
I also added some things: I used 1 tbsp of fresh lime juice, 1 tbsp of cilantro, and 6 cloves of garlic. It yielded about a cup of sauce.

This is wonderful on beef. I just loved it so much. My friend from Argentina really enjoyed it and her husband ate so much and loved it so I sent the rest home with him. To me that was a great success and I was so pleased to treat them to something they really enjoyed. Thanks for the recipe!

Used this as the base for making chimichurri for the first time ever today.  Tasted great and very similar to one that I have at my favorite steakhouse.  The key for me was to use more of all the other ingredients except olive oil for a higher concentration level of flavors.  I would also suggest making this hours, if not a day, ahead of time to fridge and absorb.  Parsley recipes have that tendency as tabouli is best served that way as well.

Yummy! I replace the parsley with cilantro and since I didn't pepper sauce I replaced that with about a tsp of red pepper flakes. WOW is all I can say. I will be saving and making the sauce often, esp in summer with all the bbqing! Excellent recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly, and it didn't turn out like any chimichurri sauce I have ever had. I think the recipe calls for too much oil, but I won't be making it again.

This was a hit at a dinner party I threw.  None of the other reviews mentioned using it with seafood, so I was nervous about using it with salmon, but it was terrific.  Our salmon was from Lake Michigan and can sometimes be too oily, so this fresh, tangy sauce was a perfect compliment.  I would use it with any fish.

not nearly as good as the one I had at our local Argentinean restaurant. Sorry - even tried to make some adjustments like adding lemon juice to brighten the flavor & more garlic, but it just wasn't the same. I think the red wine vinegar was the problem; next time I won't add it it all - just some lemon juice.

This was so much easier to make than I thought and I had everything on hand. It was a little drier than I would like, I will add more oil next time.

For some reason this turned out WAY too salty! I wish I put the salt in little by little and tasted it as I went.

This was perfect with grilled steak. Very refreshing. Made it exactly as written, although was very tempted to go with cilantro instead of parsley. Still think that would be really good too.

Wasn't a sauce for me.  I used it with the Simply Roasted Chicken as others did and was disappointed in both recipes.  I think I just got too hyped up for them with their great reviews, so my expectation was too high.

My introduction to this sauce was over crab cakes and I've used if frequently.  This is a nice version:

Shallots
Fresh Garlic
Olive Oil
Lemon
Parsley
Basil or Thyme (Your Choice)
Black Pepper

Dice Shallots and Garlic; one shallot to one or two large cloves of garlic, mix together in a deep bowl and season to your taste with black pepper. Pour in a good quality olive oil into the bowl until contents is well submerged then stir in diced parsley equal to about 10%-20% of the amount shallots and garlic, add pinches of thyme equal to about 1% of the added parsley.  Let the mix sit long enough for any dryed herbs to absorb the oil.  Then add lemon juice; for the above, about an once should be enough to bring the sauce to 'sweeten' enough for the lemon to lead in flavor.
Served over sauteed crab cakes is one of my favorites.

I had to create an account just to provide this review. This was OUTSTANDING! My husband said it was a "symphony in his mouth." I used about 1/3 cilantro and 2/3 parsley and served it with ribeye. Will be my go-to chimichurri recipe from now on!

Modified this just a bit. I didn't have red wine vinegar so I made my own with 3 tablespoons white vinegar and 1 tablespoon Zinfandel. Also, added one minced shallot, and about 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Was a big hit all around!

I had Chimichurri sauce for the first time at an eatery in California Adventures, Disneyland Park. It was the only place that offered fresh/gourmet cuisine in both parks and downtown Disney.  I kid you not!  Anyway, I became addicted to the stuff.  This recipe is pretty dead-on in flavor comparison.  Personally, I like the texture less creamy;  I can't do vinegar so I replaced it with lemon to taste...no big deal. Gosh, I'm craving it NOW!  :)  Bon Apetite!

This was pretty good. I had something similar at a Cantina, on vacation, and I really liked it. I served it with grilled flank steak, which is common. I made 1/2 recipe and got about 1/2 a cup total. I didn't think it would need the whole amount of seasoning, but it is the right amount. The only change I made per other recipes, I viewed, is add cilantro by doing half fresh parsley and half fresh cilantro. When I wrote down the recipe, I noticed I didn't write down the amount of salt. So, I ended up adding 2 pinches for half the recipe. I can't imagine adding the full tsp, anyhow, and I also added a pinch of garlic powder for a little more garlic flavor. ty

Definitely liked the chimichurri sauce. Didn't use a full 3/4 cups of olive oil...used a 1/2 cup, blended some more and then added a bit more. Came out great. I served this over skinless, bonless chicken breasts that I cooked in my Nu-Wave oven. It was great that night and even the next day as leftovers. Will make it again.

I didn't like this recipe. I guess what I was looking for was something with a little bit more kick to add a wow factor to the steak I made. For me this tasted more like grass with a little zing. I made it as written.

I had never even tried chimichurri but I was making flank steak and figured I needed to try this supposed delicious combination.  This sauce was amazing and it does in fact pair perfect with flank steak.  I made a dressing out of the leftovers by mixing it with mayo, yogurt and milk and that also came out great!

Great recipe!  A quick and easy way to add great flavor to meat.  We had it on top of a pork roast, and added only about 1/2 tsp cholula hot sauce so our 2yo could enjoy it too.

I used cilantro instead of parsley, and  we liked this quite a bit.  I did find it a little to salty and sour so next time I will reduce salt and vinegar more to our taste.  I served it with roasted chicken, then with BBQ steaks the next night, dropped a dab into my Brazillian Sean Stew and finally mixed it in with some mayo to put on Angus roast beef sandwiches.  Lots of uses, all of them yummy!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this sauce to go on Red snapper and it was great.  I wanted something way different than the old stand by tarter sauce.  I did add a sliver of red onion, and used fresh oregano, and a half cup of olive oil.  Over all great, I'll make this again!

I tried this recipe exactly as stated, and it was okay, so I made some modificaitons and it was MUCH better. First, I used cilantro instead of parsley, and I also doubled (at least) the garlic and Tabasco, and cut down on the olive oil. I would say about one third to a half a cup of oil will do the trick. I marinated sirloin in this mixture and then poured some more on as it was cooking, and served the rest on the side. It was AWESOME.

This was super good. However, I don't realy know the way it is to taste, for I could only use what was on hand.I used 3/4 c dried parsley, balsamic vinegar, basil for the oregano, granulated garlic and sweet chili sauce. but it was so good. My three year old even loved it.

This is very good. It is an unusual flavor, unlike anything I've tried before, but so fresh and dazzling on the tongue. I tried it on the Simple Roasted Chicken recipe from here and look forward to trying it on some steak or burgers soon.

This recipe is spot on! I looked it up to specifically copy a recipe I had at a restaurant: rigatoni pasta, snap peas, mozzarella cheese, cherry tomatoes, tossed in the chimichurri sauce. It sounds a little weird, but it's a delicious, healthy twist on a caprese salad.

This is always a hit in my home. The hubby and I even made a large batch for a family reunion cook out and everyone loved it. We have been making this recipe for about a year now. The only change we made was to add more garlic.

This was the hit of our 4th of July cookout. Folk were using it for a dip as well as on top of their meat, grilled Brazilian style. I upped the garlic to 2 TBSP and I trimmed the parsley stems.

Tasty! I substituted cilantro for the parsley.  Plan to serve it over sliced steak and herb salad.  Next time I make it i will blend half in the blender and chop the other half by hand to yield a sauce with more texture.  I figure this will be great on nearly anything grilled so I doubled the recipe so to have some handy for later this week.  Wonderful summer staple, thanks COOKINCOWGIRLS!

Excellent - served it twice to family and friends before and they enjoyed it a lot and have asked what was in it..  I've made it using parsley and also substituted with cilantro... both are very good but my personal preferrence is with cilantro..  I also add a little bit more garlic as others have mentioned.

I've never had chimichurri sauce so I have nothing to compare it to but it was good in my opinion and it looked really pretty on the plate with the steak rollups I made. It was bright green with a yellowish outline. My friends said it looked very gourmet! I didnt have fresh parley so i just used parsley flakes and it tasted very vinegary which was likely my fault since I dont really measure things. Will use this recipe again even just to make the plating more attractive :)

This is a wonderful sauce for anything grilled.  It reminds me of my favorite Carribbean restaurant in New Orleans.  Takes me back to that little table with a white table cloth.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Never had sauce before but it tasted great. I only used 1/2 c of oil instead of the 3/4 and omitted the oregano due to other reviews. Will definitely try to mix it up a bit in the future with cilantro. Cilantro is one of my fav herbs. Thank you cookinCowgirls for sharing!

EXCELLENT! Added 2 Tlb basil, 1/4 onion & a jalapeneo. Tripled the garlic. Marinated skirt steaks with about 1/2 the sauce for 2 hours and grilled for 7 minutes each side - PERFECT.

Delicious. I held back a bit on the salt based on others' reviews, and I think I would cut the amount of cumin a bit next time. Other than that it rocked and was enjoyed by all my guests.

This was only ok - I dont think I would make it again, though the failure may have been from substitutions I made.  I like chimichurri sauce with cilantro, which I used from the garden.  I did not have fresh parsley so I used dried flakes - I think that was my mistake.

YUM!!! I've never tried a sauce like this before. Made it w/ grilled flank steak for a casual dinner w/ neighbors. It was a total hit. Everyone loved it and kept adding more sauce to their plates. The leftover sauce was great the next day over grilled chicken. This is a permanent addition to my recipe book!

WOW! Used cilantro and parsley, which really adds something extra special to this Argentinian "ketchup" :)  Sauce was great by itself, but AMAZING drizzled over Marinated Flank Steak from this site and oozing into my homemade black beans, warm corn tortillas, fresh sliced avocado and Spanish Rice II (also from this site) for an award quality latin dinner.  Definitely a keeper!

I dont think its right to drastically change recipes and then give them a low rating.  In the food processer i added half an onion, lots o garlic and a seeded red pepper and then added chopped tomatoes to the finished sauce.  It wasnt my taste, (little too potent), but my very picky boyfriend gobbled it up and shot-gunned all the leftovers! Any recipe that can make him do that means i'll be cooking this again!  Thank you!

This was a good marinade for the tilapia, that I made last night. I added more garlic, red wine vinegar,and a little pinch of sugar. I covered the fish with the sauce and a can of diced tomatoes. Baked for 30 minutes at 350. Topped with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese. Turned out really well.

Wow. This would be great with any meat. I made the simple roasted chicken recipe from this site that recommened this sauce to go with it, and my husband and I loved it. We will use this combo again and again. We made leftover chicken sandwhiches with it and they were wonderful.

Awesome fresh sauce!  We ran short on dried oregeno so we used italian seasoning (thyme, basis, and oregeno).  I like saltiness, but it may be too much for some.  Next time I add a squeeze of fresh lime.

We loved this!  I had a chimichurri sauce in a restaurant last weekend, and happened upon this recipe by chance and was so excited to try it.  I cut it down to 3 servings and put it over 8 oz of pasta, and it was  hit!!!

I had Carne Asada with Chimichurri sauce at a local Spanish restaurant and I wanted to re-create it at home. I made this sauce and served it with grilled flake steaks. Everyone loved it! I will be making it again for sure.

I used a bit less oil than called for in the recipe.  This was great.  I served it with the Simple Whole Roasted Chicken and it was delicious.  A keeper.  Fast and easy.

This really was  a good recipe.  I changed it quite a bit because used it as a pasta sauce for angel hair pasta and served it with pan seared ginger glazed scallops and pinapple salsa.  Anyway, I didn't use the tabasco, instead I added 1 1/2 jalepenos.  I used 1/2 cup olive oil, omitted the cumin and used 4 cloves garlic, a dash of lime juice, 1/4 cup fresh parsley instead of 1 cup, used 1/4 cup fresh oregano and 1/4 cup fresh cilantro.  I put the jalepeno and garlic in my food processor first and minced it.  Then I added the rest of the ingredients and processed until they were all mixed together well.  Normally I run cold water over my angel hair pasta to keep it from over cooking after its been drained.  This time I drained it, put it in a bowl and then poured the chimichurri sauce on it and mixed it to cool it down and warm the sauce up.  It was DELICIOUS.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very delicious recipe! Probably doubled the garlic, although I didn’t measure. Also added a little more parsley to taste (and to get the color a little more green). Recipe turned out great - we served it on salmon and ended up dipping toasted bread into the remaining sauce because it was so good. Would definitely make again with salmon, shrimp, chicken, steak...  or really just anything!

I used less vinegar and a little more garlic than recipe called for.  Did not add hot sauce either.  Turned out perfectly and was so easy to make.  Served with a rib eye steak.  Leftovers keep for a while too

I made this as a chicken marinade for skewers, but left the garlic out, since the souvlaki ones I bought for dinner had garlic in them and one of my guests has a garlic aversion.
These were very tasty and the missing garlic was not missed by the garlic lovers who tried these.
I will make these again.

I loved it!  I did the half parsley half cilantro too.  (Hubby and I love cilantro!) I didn't have red wine vinegar, I had balsamic... I love the depth of flavor  balsamic has.  Try it, you'll love it too!??

Not bad but could be much better. Needs less liquid for the amount of parsley; also needs more garlic, comin, and oregano.

Made this as written, with some cilantro thrown in because I had it. Turned out perfectly! Absolutely delicious-- I will use slightly less oil next time because the texture just seemed a little thin to me. It's a keeper! But check your teeth after eating; you're going to have " a little something green" in them .

I like this recipe but it needs salt. I always have to add salt and pepper at the end. I also like grapeseed oil instead of olive oil it tends to have less aftertaste. I also never have enough with just one of this recipe, I end up doubling it every time.

I used cilantro instead of parsley, I also added garlic and onion. This was a big hit in my house, my parents aren't usually into these sauce flavor profile but they loved it. This went perfect over steak and some rice.

Excellent. I made the sauce as the recipe says, though I used much less hot sauce--barely an eighth of a teaspoon, nobody in my family likes much heat. When I first made it and tasted it I thought it might be too salty, but we put it on some pork chops for supper and it was wonderful. I might still cut the salt in half next time, but then again I might not. This was so, so good.

I only had dry parsley and it still worked. Used about 1/2 cup. Added a bit more garlic.      Made this recipe again with fresh parsley and used garlic scapes in place of garlic. Used a Ninja bullet and it came out great.

This was very tasty! My husband is obsessed!! Next time, I will add more garlic (made a 10 serving) so rather than use 3 cloves will try 5 or 6 and add a bit more heat- 2 teaspoons of hot sauce rather than 1 and a 1/4 teaspoon.

Took the advice of other reviewers and ended up with this:
 one bunch parsley, no stems
One bunch cilantro with stems
Evoo, salt, sprinkle of cumin
Two garlic cloves or more to taste
2-3 tbls red wine vinegar
1 tbls lemon juice

Blend it all up!
Even my two year old was eating it with a spoon :)

This sauce was very tasty, but it was missing some of the flavors of a chimichurri sauce. I'm going to keep looking for a more authentic recipe.

i just eyed the olive oil and I probably used less than a half cup. Used all other measurements like the recipe. It was very good. Will be using this recipe again for sure.

Followed the recipe and it had this awful bite to it. So this must be that sauce that accompanies a certain delicious Peruvian chicken we buy locally.
Anyways, I used fresh organic parsley and hated to just throw it away so I added the juice of 2 limes.  All of a sudden it was delicious.  I used it with Indriani's Simply Whole Roasted Chicken and really enjoyed it as a dipping sauce.

I didn't have any fresh parsley and used the cilantro I had in the fridge.  I added extra garlic and et voila!  This recipe is perfect!  I will play around with this recipe and add onion maybe some lemon juice as other reviewers suggested.  My kid loved it too!  I will be using this recipe throughout the summer grilling season!

I made the recipe as written, and it was way too liquidy. I didn't have any more parsley, so I added a BUNCH of basil until it was the right consistency like the picture shows. It was really good and my husband loved it over his flank steak.

Wasn't sure what to expect as I'd never tasted a chimichurri sauce but also thought it looked good in recipes!  This is good... leaves a lot of opportunity to tweak it to meet your own tastes!  Thanks!

I tried another chimichurri recipe after this one, and found this one to be the better (by far) of the two. I added extra garlic, but that's about it. It is a great condiment for steak, or even eggs.

I thought this was a great sauce! However great, instead of using parsley, I used an entire bunch of cilantro and added much more garlic, and Bam! Delicious.

Love at First Taste!  We have made this four times now and follow the recipe as written except I use half cilantro and half parsley.  Tastes fabulous on grilled steak as well as chicken.  i always make crostini's for this, too. Yummy!

I just made this and wasn't thrilled. My neighbor is Indian and her chimichurri sauce is bursting with cilantro flavor. I thought this recipe tasted too much like the oil & vinegar, than the cilantro taste I was going for. I'm going to try it again, and only put 1/2 cup oil in and 1TB vinegar next time. I may even just nix the vinegar all together. I'll rate it again once I make it.

This stuff is awesome!!I've never tried anything with a chimichurri sauce... had never heard of it, but one taste, and I have to make it frequently, and keep it on hand!! We use it to modify almost anything we eat, lots of other sauces need just a hint of this. It's even a good chip dip and dipping sauce for chicken. This has to be the best all-round sauce I've ever tasted!!

Very good. My husband picked this recipe out, and it is definitely one we will make again. We cut the oil back to a half cup, but it could probably be cut back a little more. We used cilantro instead of parsley and it was delicious! So much better than the stuff in the jar. Thanks for the recipe.

Good!  Served over "Marinated Flank Steak."  Makes a LOT of sauce.  Note:  I don't know if my dried oregano was expired, but next time I would omit it or use fresh.  It never really got "soft," even after a couple days in the fridge, and gave the sauce a bit of a gritty texture.

I added extra parsley and green onions (they were about to spoil).  The oregano taste is strong, so I would decrease that next time since I'm not a huge fan of the flavor of oregano.

This sauce is so simple and so good; I can't stop eating it! Delicious on bread, and I hope there is some left for our steaks tonight. I did use cilantro, lime juice, apple cider vinegar, and threw in a jalapeno pepper. I forgot the cumin, and didn't have oregano, but it's fantastic. Will definitely make this again.

This is a good sauce, but, in my opinion, it needs less olive oil. I used only about 1/2 cup and it was enough. Tried this sauce with salmon and we liked it this way.

love this stuff, but I used lemon juice and balsamic vinegar for the kicker.  I put it on red smashed potatoes and fresh green beans and steak--all over my dinner plate, yum! Then I had some left over for the next night.  Mixed in into some black beans and rice.  KILLER!

We really liked this. Used it in place of my regular chicken marinade. The chicken was very tender & flavorful. Great way to use up parsley! Not sure about the oregano though. Might use less next time. Thanks!

I had chimichurri steak at a restaurant recently and loved it.  This sauce was just as good.  Not too sour, just perfect. I will defintely make it again.

I make this almost every week! 
I put at least double amount of parsley and garlic like suggested.  I think it's a healthy sauce since parsley is a natural diuretic and great for people with gout (like my dad - and he likes it, too).
I have tried with cilantro as well AND both are well liked in my house!
Thank you so much for the recipe!

I needed a chimichurri Sauce recipe, and this was a good start, HOWEVER I feel the dried oregano gives this recipe a funky flavor and texture.

I will try a recipe next time that doesnt have dried oregano or just leave it out.

I find it interesting.  Unusual taste.  I've never had Chimichurri sauce before.

I loved this sauce.  After having it with roast chicken, I used it like a pesto on pasta!  I couldn't get enough of it!  I mistakenly left out the garlic, so I am sure it is even better with it!

Great! I would just reduce the salt, unless you don't use salt on the meat.

This sauce was so good. I made it for the Simple Whole Cooked Chicken as suggested and it was delicious! I will make it again.

I served this with the Simple Whole Roasted Chicken and some brown rice.  It was very good!  It has an unusual, bitter aftertaste, but maybe that's normal; I've honestly never had this sauce before.  I did love it though!  So yummy with the rice, especially.

I marinaded a rib-eye in Puerto Rican Garlic Marinade (from all recipes), then grilled them & served thsi sauce alongside. Really, really good but not quite five stars. I used fresh oregano & increased the garlic & I used curly parsley...would have been better w/ flat leaf (my flat leaf parsley petered out on me) but the curly was OK. You cowgirls sure know how to cook! ;o)

I've had this many times in Aruba so i thought i would try this recipe.  It was very good.. didnt add the whole amount of vinegar- which is good because it came out pretty strong.  Tasted really good on our Filet's!

The perfect way to top off a perfectly grilled London Broil.  Won't change a thing about this recipe.  It's classic and perfect.

We thought this was an interesting sauce, good for dipping pieces of meat into.  Had this, like others, with the Simple Roast Chicken recipe.

Very good, I made it with the Simple Roasted Whole Chicken but will definitely try it this summer when we start to grill out more.

Absolutely awesome. My guests enjoyed the whole dinner, but this sauce stole the show. I had to send everyone home with some. All night the phrase "please pass the green sauce" was repeated. It was actually quite funny!

This is great!  My family fell in love with the Chimichurri dip that the Gaucho Grill serves with their bread and we were looking to duplicate the recipe.  I have to say this one is even better and more flavorful.  I can't wait to try it as a marinade.

I have never had Chimichurri sauce, so I am rating it 5 because it was really good.  I made it along with the Simple Chicken recipe and it worked great together.  I wasn't sure I would like it and even my picky hubby really enjoyed it!  Thanks for helping to expand our tastebuds!!
