I loved this recipe, although I confess I didn't even add the dressing - I like my salad plain.  I would also add more egg next time, it was rather overpowering.  Made it as a side dish for pork chops, and it was quite filling.

This salad was delicious and easy.  My friends loved it and went back for seconds.  I served it with Dale's Swedish Meatballs.
