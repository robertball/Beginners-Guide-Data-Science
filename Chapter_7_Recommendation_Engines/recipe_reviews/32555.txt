This recipe is amazing.  I mixed it early in the day and put it in a crock pot for about an hour before needing it.  It made the whole house smell warm and festive.

I will definately make this again.

Wonderful...only be careful with the lemon.  If cooked too long it becomes to acidy.  Next time I am only putting it in the individual cups.

I made this for a holiday party, and it was delicious.  I was a little skeptical, so I also made plain apple cider.  Everyone wanted the cranberry, and it was so easy to mix up that I am sure to make it again.

This was fantastic!  I made it in a slow-cooker and it made the house smell heavenly.  Because I didn't want it too tart, I didn't add the lemon, and added a few tablespoons of real maple syrup, which made all the difference.  Next time I will only use 3 cinammon sticks, because I don't like cider that's so spiced that your mouth feels overwhelmed and I don't want to lose the flavor of the apples.  Served this at a baby shower and the guests loved it.

This is a great spin on a cold-weather classic.  I made something like this all last fall and winter, but have never thought of the lemon.  I used 1 cup of frozen cranberries because I didn't have cranberry juice.  Omitted the sugar, and yes it is very tart but that's how I like it.  Cooked in the crockpot for a few hours this afternoon.  The house smells heavenly!

This was just ok.  It was a little too tart, even for my husband who is cranberry crazy.  I would recommend using an orage instead of a lemon  to cut down on the tartness.  I did not do this but added more brown sugar.  This helped some but made it a little too sweet.

This turned out delish.  I appreciated whoever said to make sure and take the oranges or lemons out soon.  The first time I made it, I took them out once it started to boil and it was great.  The second time I was a bit lax and took them out probably 10 min. after it started boiling.  I could note a definite acidic/rind flavor, so be sure to do this.  I did use oranges instead.  I thought there was enough tartness with the cranberry and this complemented it nicely.

This cider has what I call a "kick" - a zesty, tangy afterbite after the initial sweet favor.  It will warm up you and your taste buds.  The aroma is fabulous too; I will make this in the future if anything to enjoy the natural Christmas-like air freshener.  Like many of the other reviewers, I had trouble chasing the cloves out of the final mixture so I poured it through a mesh strainer into a pitcher.  Problem solved and ready to serve!

My roommates and I had a Christmas party, served this with vodka in it (!).  Everyone seemed a bit skeptical at first, but it made the house smell great and once tried, everyone loved it!  I would say add vodka 'to taste', but we added about 3 cups or so to this recipe. The tartness of the cranberry really neutralized the vodka. Also, we added orange slices at the beginning, and stewed with that. A keeper!

Yum!  I've made this twice now & forgot the brown sugar the second time.  It still turned out great.  I did remove the lemons as soon as it was heated as other suggested.

Yummy!  I couldn't find apple cider so I used apple juice.  It was a bit sweet, so I didn't add the brown sugar.  The spices temper the sweetness.  Guests liked it and I will make again.

I served this at my cookie exchange this year and boy, was it a hit.  I put it in the crock pot early in the morning and by the time of the party at 2pm it was really wonderful.  I had to make more shortly into the party.  Of course, we served it with a side of Apple Jack.  (Kept the bottle right next to the crock pot so people could help themselves.)  We had planned to make everybody laugh by giving a prize at the end of the party to the person who drank the most cider, but we weren't able to keep track, everybody like it so much.  So far this season, I've had six people call and ask for the recipe.  That's a record.  Forgot to add, instead of the whole cloves, I added three pinches of ground cloves.  (I didn't want to have to dig them out later!)

Very good reception at a ladies' brunch I hosted.  Lovely flavor when made correctly!  Unfortunately, I left it heating too long and the second/third cups were too strongly flavored.

This recipe was great! If you brew loose tea at home and you have one of those wire-ball tea strainers, you can use that to hold the cloves; that way there's no loose cloves floating around. Also, give the cinnamon sticks a rinse (run some water through the cinnamon stick itself) to wash out any little loose bits before adding them to the recipe.

As for variations, I tried adding some whole cardamom pods along with the cloves, and we omitted the lemon. We used apple juice instead of cider so we omitted the brown sugar. 

I cooked it on HIGH in the crockpot for about an hour, turned it to LOW for a few hours after that, then turned it off for the rest of the day; between the three adults in the house, we polished off about 12 cups of the stuff (which was all I'd made). This is a wonderful wintertime drink and would be ideal for parties. :)

Very good.  Had a problem with some 'scum' that precipitated out of the mixture during the boil though would be easy to deal with using some cheese cloth and a strainer.

My mom made this every year for the holidays and I thought I'd lost that tradition.  I'm so thankful that I found it here.  This cider is so great!  We make it in a crock pot and just let it simmer while we eat, bond, and mingle.

This is wonderfully spicy and very easy! Brought it to a moms club potluck - what a hit! An added bonus: my house smelled like a Christmas gift shop after making it! This one and the maple syrup cider recipes are my favorites.

Yum!  I didn't find the lemons to make it too tart, although the cider I used was quite sweet with very little tartness, so that may be why.  This was very popular with everyone at Thanksgiving and I'll be doing it again at Christmas.

This is wonderful!  Lemon slices in individual cups are a must - also, don't be afraid of the lemon making it too acidic - I had the leftover cider refrigerated with the lemons in it for several days and it only got better!  A must-try for the holidays.

Terrific cider recipe.  My guests couldn't get enough of it.  Very refreshing on a cold evening.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year.  I put it in a slow cooker for the day and the house smelled wonderful.  Everyone enjoyed the cider.  I put lemon wedges on coffee cups for some decoration and they filled their own glasses.  I will be making this one again, thank you for the recipe!!

This is the first time, after years of using Allrecipes, that I have felt the need to comment.  This is the best beverage I've ever had.  I made it in the crock pot, like many others.  I wrapped the cinnamon and cloves in cheesecloth for early removal.  I let the lemon stay in for about two hours, and after tasting, removed and replaced with oranges.  My husband laughed at me, but my exact words were "This seriously wamrs my soul!"  The depth of flavors is a treat.  Thank you for the delicious (and easy) recipe.  It will definetely be at our Thanksgiving dinners from here on out.

Making it in the crockpot is a no-brainer! Thanks to whomever suggested that in the comments. It smells great in the house. People really liked this. I used cider from the store shelf, and 100% cranberry juice from the frozen can. I think you would want it in on high for 2 hours at least prior to the first cup you want to drink. It allows the spices to bloom a little. Delicious! Thanks!

I have been drinking this almost every other day for about 3 weeks.  For individual servings use the following measurements

Yum! I got mixed up and purchased apple juice instead of apple cider. It still was very tasty. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for our group of 10 at Thanksgiving. I'm glad that I changed the serving calculator to 35, because even at that amount, we just about ran out. This is an awesome recipe! I made it early in the day and put it in a stock pot on my wood burning stove. Heavenly! I believe it was an entirely sensory experience; the lucious aroma as they walked into the house, the nostalgia for my guests who ladeled it into their cups from atop the woodstove, the warmth in their hands as they wrapped them around their cups, and of course, the singing of their tastebuds as they sipped on it! Will definitely make this again...and again..and again!

This is a great recipe that I love to use during the holidays.  I put the spices, lemon and brown sugar in the basket of my coffee urn and pour the juices into the urn.  I then plug it in and let it brew.  When it is ready, I take out the basket and serve from my urn.  I put a small bowls of cinnamon sticks, lemon slices, and red hot candies by the urn and let everyone serve themselves.

I made this for an open house and got many compliments.  It is very good...something different than the usual plain apple cider.  It makes the house smell good too! I forgot to mention that I did strain my finished drink thru a cheesecloth to remove all the excess "debris".  I prefered to serve a clearer looking drink rather than have the clumped cinnamon floating around in it.

I really love this recipe.  Followed it as written except I put the whole cloves in a coffee filter and stapled it shut. I can't think of a special fall or winter occasion that I would host without serving this.  Will definitely make again.

I made this for my inlaws this weekend.  It was a total HIT!  I didn't have any cheesecloth, so I ripped a hole in a tea bag and replaced the tea with the cloves.  No floaties to worry about!  Because I didn't want to make a wasted pot, I put in both lemons and oranges, just in case.  It was great, so I'll stick with that.  Put it in the crock pot early afternoon, it was wonderfully hot all evening!  My mother-in-law tried it only to not hurt my feelings and ended up drinking six or seven cupfulls!  Even MY m-i-l can't fake it that much!  My seven year old loved it too!
Tart, but full of a variety of flavors and fun to drink.  Thanks!

Drinking this as I type! I put it in the crock pot on high while the spices were in and left it for about 30-45 minutes, 1 hour max, while I ran some errands. When I came back I took the cloves, lemon, & cinnamon out and turned it down to low. It's amazing!!

Made this tonight for a Halloween party.  Total hit.  So much better than the apple cider I made. This one is a keeper.  I too took out the lemons after boiling before simmering. Will make this on regular days when it's cold outside!

Delicious recipe.. but I omit the sugar.  I use cranberry juice mixed with other fruit juice for sweetness as to avoid high fructose corn syrup.

I made this cider with Christmas dinner and everyone just loved it.  Very, very simple, sweet, and delicious!  I used an orange instead of lemon and took it out right when it started boiling as others suggested.

This cider is delicious! I combined all ingredients, minus the lemon, in a slow cooker and cooked on LOW for about 2 hours. Whole cloves were expensive at the grocery store so I used ground cloves from my pantry, about 1/8 tsp. Lemon slices were offered on the side, but it was perfect without. I will be making this every holiday season. Thank you, Michele!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and everyone had something good to say about! I LOVE it, I make small batches just for myself whenever the mood strikes me! I will definitely be using this recipe for many many years to come. It's so simple and so good, those are the exact kind of recipes I like! Thank you for sharing!

Great recipe! The cranberry juice keeps the apple cider from being too sweet which I don't like.  My husband calls this Wassail.  I made enough for 100 people for a party.  We ended up with about 80 people but there was none left at all.  Everyone loved this!

Made this for an early Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. I used only 1/2 of a lemon and I think that made it just tart enough for us. Very easy and will definitely be making it again.

Awesome recipe!  I didn't want an overpowering lemon taste so I just cut the lemon in half and stuck the cloves into the zest of the lemon halves. I made this a hot toddy by adding some Bacardi rum!

This is delicious and so easy to make! We used Cranberry Pomegranate juice instead of regular cranberry. I followed all directions and then strained it and put it in the crockpot (as others suggested). It's easy to reheat, just turn it on warm! So wonderful, I'm sharing the recipe with all my friends!

I served this to my church choir Christmas party. I had over 40 people in attendance. Made a double batch and not a drop was left. I served it in my percolator. Easy for them to help themselves and not have a mess. They loved this. I shall definitely be making this recipe again. Having another party this next weekend and this drink will be on the menu. Thanks

I had 16 guests for Thanksgiving this year.  As the guests walked in, I offered them this cider or mulled wine.  It was sleeting outside, so most of the guests were soaking wet.  All of them were very appreciative to have something warm.  I plan to make this wonderful tasting cider all winter.  I put the fruit in at the end of the cooking process as to not make the drink too acidic....I also added a few more cloves to give it more of a punch.  Serve this cider at your next event on a cold night and you will make many guests feel very welcome and warm on cold snowy nights...

I cut the recipe in half and put it in my crock pot on high for two hours.  I added the lemon slices during the last 30 minutes. I served it to my book club tonight, and it was delicious.  Everyone raved about it.  I will definitely be making this again.

Yummy!!!  Made this for movie night w/ the girls, coulnt find apple cider so I used apple juice, and instead of the lemons I used oranges. Isnt a drink that I could drink a lot of (very spicy), but just a cup full was enough to warm me up!! I have made this 4 times in the 3 weeks that I found this recipe!

I recently made this for my Christmas Cocktail party as a non-alcoholic choice for my guests.  This is WONDERFUL for a party!  I made it about 3 hours before the start of the party after all the cleaning and other cooking had been completed.  After it was finished on the stove I transferred it to my Crock-Pot and my house smelled wonderful for the entire evening.  I followed the directions exactly and it came out delicious!  It wasn't overly sweet, or sugary, as I find most non-alcoholic drink recipes are.  It was wonderful to offer a beverage suited to adult tastes to my guests that don't choose to drink alcohol instead of a more child themed beverage.  Also, I witnessed many of the alcohol drinkers switching to this at the end of the evening as a nightcap.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I  made this for a recent party and I cannot believe how many comments I had on it and requests I got for the recipe!  The only change I made was to add some orange slices to it.

I liked this, but next time I'll use more apple cider and less cranberry juice.  I know it's supposed to be a combo of the two, but it wasn't sweet enough for me.  I do like things sweet though, so it could just be me!

I served this last week at my mother's book club, and it was a Huge Success.  We had 11 guests here for about an hour and a half, and would you believe it, there was not a drop left. They commented that it was just right - unlike the too-sweet warm punches they are so often served. Very fragrant and easy to do.  The one change I made was using cran-raspberry instead of straight cranberry.  As for method, I used a slotted spoon to remove the bits from the cider when we were ready to serve, but next time will use a fine mesh sieve. Otherwise the cloves are too hard to extract.  Really a lovely recipe though!

This recipe is quick and awesome tasting! I made it right in my slow cooker. I had it on high for about 1.5 hours before my guests arrived. It was plenty of time for the flavors to meld and acheive the warm fermented notes you would get by boiling it first. This one is a keeper! Enjoy!

LOOOVED this!! I'm not the biggest fan of lemon so I left it out and threw everything (put the spices in a cheese cloth) in a crockpot on high for an hour or two and then to warm - so delicious and the spice is just right!

Must make with cranapple! Delicious. 

**********If you use regular cranberry juice it is very TART. Made my dad start drooling. We think it is much better with  cran-apple or reduced sugar cranberry juice because we don't like drool inducing tartness. The spice mix is great.

Unlike almost everyone else's, mine was super/super tart (the lemon?).  Had to keep adding brown sugar to make it okay.  Fortunately, I had a "guinea pig" guest who gave me honest feedback before serving to everyone else.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was the hit of the party.  I did take out the lemon slices after simmering and transported cider in a crockpot (on low an hour before serving), and just before serving, added lemon slices for colour.  Very easy to make and definitely good to drink!

This is a great holiday drink to keep warm on your stove or in your slow cooker for guests.  I scaled it back this time, and next time, I will increase the cranberry juice over the apple cider, just because of personal preference.

I added cranberry/pomegranate juice to it instead of just cranberry juice and took out the lemons after an hour so that it would not have any effects from the rind. I also used 4 sm cinnamon sticks instead of the lg ones cause some people don't like it so strong and put some sticks in a cup on the side for those who wanted it stronger. It is always better to add later than to have it too strong.

This was great -- just what I was looking for. Followed quantities exactly, except that I made half for a small office gathering and the other half the next morning for house guests. The thing I liked best is that it wasn't overly sweet -- I was serving to folks who drink black coffee every day and knew something that was more on the tart side would go over well. This was festive, pretty and tasty!

Wow.  This was AWESOME cider!  Everyone at my Thanksgiving feast had cups and cups of this stuff!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated ~ after cooking on the stove, I strained the cider into a large slow cooker and kept the cooker on low all day.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this for a holiday event with reporters.  All of which sang my praises for the delicious cider.  I kept the cider warm by bringing my slow cooker to the party and used a ladel to scoop it out.  The recipe is very similar to my moms recipe that uses some of the same ingridients.  I did not keep the lemons in, as mentioned in other reviews.  

I have made this several times!  A sure winner!

Delicious and so easy.  I, too, removed the lemon slices after simmering and it was just the right combination of sweet and tart.  I also halved the recipe as I was just having just 6 guests and luckily only 2 chose to drink it (1 with vodka & 1 without).  It was gone in a half hour.  Next time, I may double the recipe just to make sure I have enough!

Delicious! I can’t speak to the original recipe as I made some alterations, but they weren’t major so I imagine had I made the recipe as written it would have been wonderful. If you’re curious, I used sweetened apple cider so I omitted the brown sugar. I had approx. 8 cups of cranberry cocktail (not juice) on hand, so I used all of that. And I didn’t have a lemon so I sliced up an orange instead. Heated it on high in a crockpot for 2 hrs.

Excellent drink for a gathering on a blustery day! Used orange wedge instead of lemon, let simmer in crock pot. Lots of compliments on this one!

MMM! Delicious. I made this on New Year's Eve, and just let it simmer on the stove all evening. It was a big hit!

This stuff is really good, and smells so great! I didn't change any of the ingredients. I made it in the crockpot so it could stay warm the whole party.

I hosted the In-Laws for my first major holiday last year, and, out of the many recipes that I pulled from this website for that Thanksgiving meal, this is the one that I am keeping forever.  It is a perfectly hot and sweet seasonal beverage.  Love it!

Awesome! I skipped the lemon and used 2 qts of cranberry juice cocktail. Also left out the brown sugar as the cider/juice is plenty sweet. I could drink this every day!

It smelled great, but the cranberry flavor was way to strong for me.  I like cranberry juice, but there were too many competing flavors in this.

This is awesome!  I like to make things from scratch so I didn't think much of the recipe when I read it.  I normally would juice my own apples and  cranberries, but thought what the heck.  It's great! love it.   I even like it better on the rocks.  I'm drinking it right now.

I didn't make this sweet enough so next time I will add more brown sugar.  I did add some floating orange slices with cloves poked through them.  I think I drank the most of everyone.

A great change of pace hot drink. I usually make Hot Russian Tea but wanted something different. I still like Russian Tea better but this a nice alternative. I think I will try orange slices instead of lemon next time.

My family wasn't excited about me changing their apple cider and adding cranberry juice.  But when they tried it they loved it.  I made this over and over again and it would disappear almost immediately.

The best spiced cider i have EVER had.  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  Even my husband who rarely likes hot drinks raved about this one.  Great family friendly festive drink and smells wonderful too.  I made it in the crock pot and let simmer all throughout the meal, worked out great.

This recipe is Fabulous!  I made this for friends last night and everyone loved it.  I have to admit that played a bit loose with the ingredients (didn't measure the cranberry juice, forgot the lemon), and it still was WONDERFUL.  I plan on making this all winter long!
Thanks!!

I doubled this serving made a giant pot of it for a party and it was ALL GONE by the end of the night it was amazing. 
I used allspice instead of cloves (didnt have it). doubled cinnomon sticks (since I doubled the recipe). It was a huge hit!

I made this in a 42 cup percolator. I used 1 gallon of cider, 2qts of cranberry juice.  I changed the rest of the ingredients to:
3/4 c brown sugar
1 1/2 tsp whole cloves
1 1/2 tsp whole allspice
6 cinnamon sticks
1 sliced lemon
I put the juice & cider in the percolator & the rest of the ingredients in the percolator basket.  I plugged it in & perked it until the ready light came on, about 30 minutes. It was delicious. Our guests really enjoyed it.  I’ve already passed the recipe on.

This recipe tasted great! I made this exactly as it is written and it came out really good. It wasn't too sweet or too tart for my family. They all enjoyed it and asked me to make it again.

Easy to make & delicious! I hosted an open house in a new construction home without any appliances, so I had to be resourceful. I brought the ingredients and a crockpot. That's it!
Everyone raved how delicious the cider was on a cool rainy afternoon! I used half orange half lemon slices added about 15 minutes before serving time, per reviewers advise.

This is wonderful! I halved all ingredients as I didn’t need so much. I used honeycrisp apple cider and used a cutie clementine instead of a lemon and left it in for the whole boil/simmer process. First time making it and it was fabulous! It was so good I had to make this my first review!

I absolutely love this recipe! I’ve made this cider every year for the past 7 or 8 years, and I always look forward to having it! It’s the perfect drink for the fall/winter seasons, and I’ve shared this recipe with so many of my friends, who all think it’s awesome!! The only thing I would change is to not boil the lemons directly with the cider, but to probably top it off right before serving. I usually just add a tad bit of lemon juice, which does the same thing. This makes it to where you can enjoy the lemon in the cider, or else it comes out to be too tart/bitter. Highly recommend, and it makes the house smell awesome!

This is a delicious alternative to your normal Hot Apple Cider. I have actually made it several times to take to different functions and received rave reviews each time. It's much better if it is made ahead of time so the flavors can blend.

From the first time I made this over 10 years ago, it was voted a necessity and added to our traditional line up! I won't cook Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner without this simmering on the stove. It is yummy, and its aroma is wonderful; its like liquid cheer! I suggest that if you do keep it on the stove for an extended amount of time you check it often to make sure the cloves and cinnamon do not become overpowering. Simply remove them if they start becoming a bit to strong. It is also easy to keep adding to it as it begins to disappear, so that there is always an ample supply of yummy cheer.

This was really good. With an orange instead of lemon. I put the cloves in the orange and cut the orange in half. Removed the cin sticks and orange  about 20 minutes after coming to boil.

Do be careful with the amount of lemon or how long you leave the lemon in it can get very tart. I am added white rum and pineapple, it was delicious.

This has been my go-to Christmas party punch for the last 3 years - it was such a hit the first year my co-workers ask me to bring it in every year.  I always get asked for the recipe when someone new tries it.

Have made this a few times during the holidays in the crock pot.  Do not make any chances much except maybe use raspberry/cranberry if that is what I have on hand.  Tasty and so nice esp. if the weather is cool.  Thanks Michele!

A total hit with my guests, so much so that they came back again and again and emptied my supply before expected!  I also suggest putting the lemon slices in as you are serving it to prevent a bitter aftertaste.  Perfect and so easy to make- and no changes needed!

I made this as a nice warm drink for Thanksgiving for when the guests arrived.  It was a huge hit with everyone who tasted it.  People couldn't get over how few ingredients were in it and how great it tasted.  I forgot the lemon, and it was great without.  I'll make this again in smaller batches for the family and me.  :)

I took this to an office pot luck and EVERYONE loved it!!  The whole office had the smell of this delicious cider.  Everyone asked for the recipe and wanted me to bring in more the next day.  Thanks for the great and different recipe.  It's a nice change from the ordinary apple cider.  You gotta try this!!!

This was a very good recipe, but it didn't wow me.  Very easy and everyone seemed to enjoy.

I made this at Thanksgiving. It was ok, but not a huge hit. The acidity from the lemon seemed to overpower the spices and gave it kind of a bad wine flavor. I won't make again.

Very tasty.  Worked well for handing a steaming mug to our arriving guests at Thanksgiving.  I didn't use the lemon and thought it was just fine without it.

This is a wonderful, soul warming recipe.  Everyone at my Thanksgiving dinner loved it.  My cider ended up with a "skin" on the top in addition to my floating spices, so next time I will probably pour it through a sieve instead of using a slotted spoon.

This was good - my sister-in-law almost polished it off by herself!  I thought it was just a bit on the sweet side.  Maybe b/c I couldn't find straight cranberry juice (do they even make that?) so I used the cranberry juice "cocktail" by Ocean Spray.

This cider was too sharp for my taste.  I don't know what else I expected from a cranberry cider, but this was not it.  It did make the house smell great. My husband liked it okay, but I probably won't make it again.
