Wow! Talk about refreshing. Nice combination of sweet and tart. Loved it with lots and lots of crushed ice, tall glass and a fruit kabob!Also did this recipe with cranberry juice. I have heard that there really is a cranberry gingerale out there, but I have never found it in any of the stores that I shop. This is a good sub. Thanks Kate.

I had some marachino cherries on hand (stemless). I made ice cubes with a cherry in each cube. It looked pretty and it was fun for the kids to see the suspended fruit. For the adults I served this in wine glasses with a splash of white wine to make it a cherry wine cooler. Refreshing! They liked the cherry ice cubes too.

I had frozen fruit cocktail juice on hand and mixed it with the ginger ale. Served at a dinner party, everyone was so impressed!

My kids loved these.  I had trouble finding just frozen cherry concentrate so I ended up using cherry/apple.  I did add cherries to it.  Thanks

Really, really good!  It's so simple but refreshing and tasty. I used regular cherry juice as can't get frozen concentrate. This is my new summer drink.

Such a perfect summer drink! Perfectly simple and refreshing! Couldn't find the cherry concentrate so we used an apple/cherry combination which worked just as good...we are going to try it with all the other fruit concentrates it was good! just keep in mind if the cherry fizz is not being served to a large group that the ginger ale can lose its carbonation...
