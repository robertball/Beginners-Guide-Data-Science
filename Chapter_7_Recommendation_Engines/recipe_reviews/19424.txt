This recipe is easy and better than box mac & cheese.  I use cream of mushroom soup insead and mix in quite a bit more grated cheese rather than slices of cheese.  I skip the tomato and then bake it with herbed bread crumbs and dots of butter on top.

This was a good base recipe.  Like other users had mentioned, I used 1 can each of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup.  I also used diced tomatoes in place of the tomato slices.  Instead of layering the cheese & tomatoes, I mixed shredded cheddar cheese and the diced tomatoes into the hot macaroni & soup mixture.  I also sprinkled breadcrumbs on top.  My husband and 3-year-old son loved it!

I really love this! Of course pasta and cheese IS always a winner! I did alter a bit, in place of two cans of cream of chicken I added a can of cream of cheddar cheese and a can of cream of mushroom. And also instead of the 4 tomatoes I used a can of diced tomatoes flavored with basil and garlic and mixed it right in the macaroni. Just sooo yummy!

This isn't bad, it just isn't great.  One benefit is that it makes a lot and is good for leftovers.  One thing that I did that my husband liked was add breadcrumbs to the top.

Very tasty. Instead of milk, I added Fat Free Half and Half - creamier and thicker than milk. I also used shredded vs. sliced cheddar so that I could top the bake with it to make it golden brown (and add a little extra inside for a cheesier flavor). I also topped with sprinkled bread crumbs and paprika.

This was really good.  I used whole wheat pasta and added garlic powder, onion powder, worcestershire sauce and lots of grated chedder cheese to the cream of chicken.  My kids loved it.

This recipe has become a staple in our household.  It's wonderful, and excellent for leftovers too.  The tomatoes add a fresh taste to the rest of the flavors.  It comes highly recommended!

This recipe was good for me, because I need to go grocery shopping & I didn't have hardly anything to make dinner out of. It was good for a quick throw together dinner, but I don't think I would make it otherwise--it wasn't quite cheesy enough for me. If I did make it again, I would mix the cheese in, not just layer it on top. I added breadcrumbs (which I did like), and I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used drained diced.

This recipe is good for when you don't have anything in the house but can pull a bunch of stuff out of the pantry that you will probably have on hand.

I wasn't in love with this. I did stray a little - I substituted one of the cream of chicken soups for a cheddar cheese soup and used shredded cheese in stead of processed since it's what I had. It just wasn't what I was hoping... Not all that cheesy.

This  is a very flexible and easy recipe.  I used shredded cheese and added fresh ground black pepper and mixed it all together.  No tomatoes or cheese slices used.  Next time I will  add a can of diced tomatoes and some diced ham.  Yum!

This is the best macaroni and cheese recipe that I've made. I did make a few changes based on other reviews: I used cream of mushroom soup, diced italian tomatoes, and shredded mild cheddar.

Made this using a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup, diced tomatoes with garlic & basil, and parmesan cheese all mixed up with the medium shells I had on hand. Layer more cheese on top with some breadcrumbs. SO GOOD!!!

This turned out pretty good. I substituted shredded sharp cheddar for the processed cheese and added stewed tomatoes (flavored with basil and oregano). Very tasty and easy to make.

I give it as written... BUT... After my alterations, it would be a 4 or 5 star :]  I added a couple cups of shredded cheese to the mixture and I added a scoop or two of sour cream and a scoop or two of mayonaise.  I added about 20 oz of noodles instead of 16.  I added some onion and garlic spices, and ome of my own special spice.  I topped with sliced cheese.  Oh, and my biggest change--I cut up some kielbasa and leftover cheese brauts... I wanted to make it a more complete meal... everyone loved it, definitely a keeper!! :D    P.S. I used two slightly smaller pans, it was OVERFLOWING out of the one recommended.

I didn't have tomatoes, but I really wanted to try out this recipe, so I left them out and sparingly sprinkled diced celery on top. It turned out really good. I can't wait to try it with tomatoes! My family enjoyed it as well, and it was extremely simple. I also added swiss cheese as well as the cheddar.

Great simple recipe.  I have made it several times.  I usually cut out the tomatoes and use one can of cream of chicken and one can of nacho cheese.  Gives it a little extra flavor and makes it even more cheesy!

Very good place to start - I was able to use what I had on hand and make something good for dinner.  Used shredded cheese and half & half (discovered I was out of milk after I started) and no tomatoes since my kids don't like them.  Would add some spices next time to kick it up a bit.

Used this as a starting point to try and create a lower fat/lower cal mac & cheese. The soup did a great job. I added about 1.5 oz sharp cheddar to help flavor. Kids and I liked it a lot.

This is a great dish for a small party, and makes a great side dish for barbecue! Especially when picky kids are involved. I make it up a little bit ahead of time and bake it just before guest arrive. perfect!

This came out tasty.  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to use two cans of cream of mushroom and I replaced regular milk with evaporated milk.  I also eliminated the tomatoes. I first layered the bottom of the pan with shredded cheese, topped that with sliced cheese, then layered the macaroni and cheese with the shredded cheese.  Next time I will try it with cream of chicken and see how that tastes.

This was good! The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it's not my favorite mac & cheese recipe. (However, for someone else it might warrant 4 or 5!) I made half the amount of pasta (whole wheat bow ties) and 1 can of cream of chicken + 3/4 cup milk. With this combination, the sauce was a nice creamy consistency. I used diced tomatoes and a good type of cheddar cheese. It was good, but I think I like recipes that include bacon and onions a little more. :)

I just made this. The only reason I gave this 4 and not 5 stars is because of the changes I made to suit our tastes and what I had on hand.
The changes I made were as follows:
Instead of cream of chicken soup, I used cream of mushroom, and a can of diced tomatoes that I put into the mixture, not on top. I also added a diced ham steak, and some cauliflower that I quickly steamed in the microwave. Finally I added dried minced onion, and used about 2 cups of grated cheese (1/2 cup in sauce) on top of everything. We all loved it, even my 10 month old! I will definitely make this again!

Pretty good.  My 10 year old loved it and can't wait to take it for school lunch tomorrow. Great for a quick meal and only calls for a few ingredients.

I love this recipe!  I have made this three times in as many weeks.  I have gotten rave reviews each time I make this.  I go with the cream of chicken soup, omit the tomatoes, and use more milk.  I also put freshly ground black pepper into the soup as it is warming.  Instead of the sharp cheddar, I use the Velveeta block cheese cut it into slices.  I use Kraft Pepperjack cheese slices too.  I put the two cheeses in between each layer, then break it up and put it all over the top.  It is wonderful!  I adjust the servings to 12 whenever I do this for a large group.

We rolled in some of the other reviewers suggestions by mixing half of the cheese right into the macaroni.  We then used the remainder, along with the tomatoes on top.  We also added a dusting of bread crumbs on top.

We really like this simple and easy to make recipe.  We've added a little salt to other mac n cheese recipes, but the chicken soup in this one took care of that for us.  We probably would have actually added a dash of pepper.  Our three year old devoured everything we gave her - a rarity.  Looking forward to making this again!

This was good, but liked it better with a can of seasoned diced tomatoes mixed in, and also mixed the cheese in.  For a more protein-rich meal, cook 1 pound of diced chicken for 15 minutes in 1/4 cup butter in a fry pan and add to macaroni mixture.  Top with the fresh tomato slices and bake 20 mins.

I added bacon and potatoes and it really gave it a delicious taste. I also diced the tomatoes instead of slicing them. I also preferred to use shredded sharp cheddar and jack cheese. It turned out super good and I got many compliments!

An excellent base recipe on which to add your own twist. Like some other reviewers, I added 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom soup along with 1 can of diced tomatoes (drained)and one can of sliced mushrooms (undrained). I used about 1 and a half cups of shredded cheddar that I mixed right into soup mixture. I spiced it up by adding a tsp of dried basil, oregano and hot pepper flakes. I topped it all off with a light dusting of italian bread crumbs, romano cheese and parsley flakes...turned out very yummy!

This was ok, I used seasoned canned tomatoes which I thought added some good flavor, but overall, this was just so-so. Maybe I didn't add enough cheese.

This recipe was pretty good. I used canned tomatoes, and used shredded cheese. It was a little dry, but very tasty. My husband loved it, and he normally doesn't like tomatoes.

I had to add lots of spice, but other than that, very good.
