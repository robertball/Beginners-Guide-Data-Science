Once you let the alcohol cook out, you're left with a nice sweet sauce with just a hint  of the bourbon flavor.  Very nice, and VERY easy, too.

Delicious!  What a great way to get the children to eat carrots.  Don't worry, the alcohol cooks out and you would never know it was in the recipe.   I didn't have Bourbon so I used Southern Comfort.   This is a keeper!

Great recipe!  Cook a little less to keep a little more crispness to the carrots.  I've also been using Crown Royal Maple to give it an extra kick.

For those concerned about the alcohol, most alcohol is cooked out before adding, plus this is 8 servings.  Do you leave vanilla out of baked goods that you serve to children? Here the bourbon is used as a flavoring, not an adult beverage.

Made these for Easter.  At very end, just before I poured hot glaze over the carrots I added about  1/4 tsp of fresh grated ginger.  After pouring over carrots I added some fine black pepper and a little salt.  It was wonderful!!  A new favorite way to cook carrots and SO easy.  ( I used bagged baby carrots- I had a lot since they are so much cheaper at warehouse clubs in large quantities!)

I was just about to make a recipe very similar to this, but had orange peel instead of bourbon.  Thought I'd try this one instead.  It turned out very good.  I'm not sure which one I like better.  Both are great!

I have made these carrots a few dozen times. We love them.  I have tweaked the recipe though.  I add a bit of cayenne pepper to the carrots once softened with the butter. I also changed the bourbon to Fireball cinnamon whiskey-try it you won't be sorry. Always, always, always a crowd favorite.

This is pretty much the same way I make glazed carrots except for the bourbon. The bourbon makes a great addition and cooks off so the taste is very subtle. I added a pinch of sea salt and cracked pepper to give it more flavor. Orange zest would be a nice addition also for next time.

I change things by using baby carrots in Insti-pot   for 10 minutes with pinapple juice added.  The glaze had a great taste.

This was really nice. I used baby carrots and more bourbon, because we are consenting adults. It had a light, sweet flavor with a punch of smoky butter. I will definitely do these again!

This dish was well received at our Thanksgiving dinner. I followed the recipe as written and added a bit more to the sauce as I had cooked 3 lb of carrots. More sauce is always good. The bourbon flavor was very subtle and added a bit of pizazz to the dish.

We've made this a couple of times now. 1st time was with the bourbon & the 2nd was with brandy. They were ok & different than just butter & salt/pepper, but won't make again probably. I didn't think you could taste the sauce much & my glaze was thick so that wasn't the problem.

Delicious, quick, easy, and the kids loved it!  Made it with margarine to accommodate a dairy allergy, and while I imagine it would have had a somewhat richer flavor and a thicker sauce with butter, it was still delicious and devoured!

I made this recipe today.  It sounded simple and tasty.  However, I won't be making this again.  I found the taste rather disappointing.  I thought with the bourbon, butter, and brown sugar that it would have a somewhat sweet, caramelly taste but instead it was just bland.

Since it was just me and the Mr., I cut the recipe in half.  We absolutely loved it!  2 suggestions we came up with were - .  #1 add another tsp of bourbon and #2 add a tsp of honey.  Delicious!

The kids love when I put the carrots in a skillet and sauté them to add a little brown.

I used a shot of Knob Creek, it smell heavy of bourbon but the taste was just right ... The family enjoyed it as well

Just okay as written. Something is missing in the recipe to make it less candy tasting.  Regardless, Thank You for sharing.

Tried this for the first time last night. Didn't have bourbon, so used whiskey. Cut up 1lb and it was perfect for me and my boyfriend. No leftovers. It was good, but next time I think I'll add a bit more brown sugar. Will definitely make again!!

Remember to cook the glaze on a low temperature. I had a novice cook help me and we ended up with bourbon candy

Really good.   Half of us liked it a lot and half not so much.   I think if I would kick back the Beam to 1 tablespoon it would be perfect.  BTW the half that didn't like it feel that glazed carrots should only be sweet.  Nothing else.   They are wrong :)
