SO GOOD!! My grocery store didn't have the right sausage so I substituted with smoked sausage. I used jasmine rice bc that's what I always use for white and I went with pinto beans. Awesome! Thanks Cathy!

Next time, I'll cook the rice separately and add it last.  It turned out mushy when added from the beginning.
