Good sauce for the noodles.  I just tossed it into our somen noodles and topped it with some catfish from another recipe (Honey Coconut Salmon).  It would be great with chopped cilantro and cashews and julienned peppers for color.

I'm a big fan of thai food but have never tried preparing it until tonight! This was great! The sauce had a great flavor and the spicy kick was perfect. I'm definitely making this again

Very Tasty and easy to make. I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen but other than that I did it exactly as per the recipe.

This was great and quick!  Used tofu instead of chicken and fresh broccoli with red bell peppers.  It was a little salty even with low sodium soy.  Next time I might use less soy and add a little water.

Very good!  I didn't have any rice noodles, so I ended up using udon and I actually doubled the sauce and put in 2 eggs.  It was fantastic!  Next time, I'll be sure to pick up rice noodles at the store because I'm sure that's even better.

Pad Se Eew is my favorite dish to order at Thai restaurants, but this recipe really didn't taste like it.  It was okay, but not great.

Didn't add chicken.  Was good for a quick dinner. Kids ate it up. Doubled the sauce...would have been dry without that.  Will make again.

Loved this recipe. The only addition I made was to double the sauce mixture. My first go round was a little dry, but with another pour of sauce, it was perfect

I made it for the first time for my son who loves this dish.  I used low sodium soy sauce & used one kind.  I also doubled the sauce.  The only thing I forgot was the egg & it still came out fantastic.  This recipe is definitely a keeper & was a big hit in my family.  Oh, I also used spinach instead of broccoli.  I blanched the spinach and then added it to the noodles at the very end. Yummy!

Very good basic recipe.  The other reviews are correct, double the sauce.  A few changes I've made.  Add bias cut celery and carrots (I cook the carrots and broccoli lightly before adding).  Cilantro is a nice touch as well as a large tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter to the sauce.  Sesame oil also give a nice added flavor,  add some to cooking and a little drizzle before serving.  Green onion also add flavor texture and color.  Instead of 2 T of white sugar (double the sauce)  I use one white and one brown sugar.  These changes make a good recipe great.

Tasty and healthy, I liked this quite a bit.  The only thing that went wrong was cooking with rice noodles; I keep over-cooking them and they get mushy...but that's on me, not the recipe.

Didn't taste anything like pad se eew, actually, but it was still pretty tasty! I'd make it again, but will try adding peanut butter for a nutty flavor next time, since it wasn't much like pad se eew anyway.

I agree with other reviewers -- the sauce needs to be doubled.  I added chopped onion with the garlic and chicken.  I subbed chopped cabbage for half the broccoli. This was delicious! Thank you, Robert!

I used this as a baseline, I did add some oyster sauce to the sauce when I prepared it. Also I added some onion, basil and carrot. Very very good couldn't find the wide noodle so I used a stir fry noodle. The fam loved it with absolutely no left overs. Thanks!!!!

Yum! I doubled the sauce and since we didn't have frozen broccoli, I added some fresh veggies we had on hand. I also added 2 eggs & double the garlic. I didn't use all of the rice noodles, as they would have completely overwhelmed the dish. Added about 2/3 of them instead. We loved it the way I prepared it!

Flavor is good, but a bit light.  I will double sauce and egg next time.  I did use tofu instead of chicken, so maybe that was the reason it was a bit bland.

I'm giving it a higher rating because it's one of the few Thai recipes on this site. It was hard to find flat rice noodles but I was able to find pad thai noodles at my local Asian market in the fresh noodle section. I also use fresh boneless, skinless  chicken thighs cut into strips instead of chicken tenders.

The wife absolutely loved it.  It was different than the typical Thai restaurant versions she is used to.  But honestly it was the best Thai food we've had in Hawaii

This is great! Pad Se Eew is our favorite at Thai restaurants. I changed the chicken to pork, which is regular meat in Pad Se Eew.

This is our favorite dish at Thai restaurants, so I was happy to find this recipe.  So far we did not find the wide rice noodles, so I used regular pad noodles.  Also, because we are a vegan household, we skipped the egg and chicken, and I added cashews instead and sauteed those with the broccoli.  Other change was that I only used one kind of Soy Sauce and used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  I will totally make this again, hopefully with the wide rice noodles if I can find them!  Really yummy easy recipe.  Last time our family of 3 ate out at a Thai restaurant the bill was $70 + tip.  I am glad to be able to make this at home!

Delicious! We used fresh broccoli instead of frozen. Everyone in my family loved it and we had NO leftovers.
