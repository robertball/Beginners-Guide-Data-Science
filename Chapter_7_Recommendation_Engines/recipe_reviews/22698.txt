i also grew up with this recipe. next time try this... when adding the onion soup, use a small strainer and sift the powder through and discard the flakes.
another simple variation is to use half sour cream and half cream cheese. always be sure to sift out all those flakes for a superb dip!

This dip is good, but I prefer the onion soup mix mixed with a container of sour cream instead.  This is good to make when you don't have sour cream though!!

I don't normally review recipes but this one was very easy to make and flavourful. I won't be purchasing any dips from now on...I will just make my own.

I ended up making this recipe twice. The first time i added the milk, and it came out a little thinner than i would have liked.  The second time i made it I cut the milk out completely, and i loved it.  It was a huge hit at my Chirstmas party.

I found this recipe much better than the standard soup mix and sour cream . I also lowered the amount of soup mix required (to my taste)I found it turned out much better that way.

I LOVE French Onion Dip. Especially with pretzels. Try it with pretzels instead of chips---a healthier alternative.

I took the advice of one other other reviews and sieved out the bits and pieces of dry onion. I thought it was a bit plain, something was missing. I added chopped chives, and that was better, it gave an element of freshness.

I liked this dip, however it tasted a bit too salty for my liking. Still tasty, and super easy to make, though. Thanks.

i have made this for years...i dissolve the onion soup mix in 1/3 cup of hot water before adding to the cream cheese...it makes the dip so much smoother and easier to mix...skip the milk entirely...you don't need it

Add a little hot water to the soup mix to rehydrate the onions. Let it sit about 5 minutes. Then add to the sour cream or cream cheese. That's how Mom did it!
Also, 1/2 an envelope makes a nice dip, not too strong.

As is, this recipe rates 3 stars from my family. With my additions, it gets 5. I add 1 TBS Worcestershire, I TBS garlic powder, a dash of red pepper and 1/2 tsp celery seed, omitting the milk.

I get many raves about this dip made my way and constant requests for the recipe.

People love it with pretzels!

Excellent traditional recipe as is the one with the onion soup mix and sour cream.  Now some leave in the onion flakes, like me, and some can't stand 'em and strain them out - its all a matter of what you and your family likes - I would say though, that if its the "crunchy" flakes that you dislike in what should be a smooth dip, make it ahead - and leave it in the fridge overnight.  those Onion flakes are dehydrated onion which means they need liquid to soften up.  If you like the onion and don't want crunchy make it the night before :)
- you can also add a bit more cream cheese or milk to make it thicker and or thinner for your preference and add a few other herbs and use only half the package of onion soup mix - a really nice change up is to use vegetable soup mix! or a garden herb or dry italian seasoning packet or... well I could just go on and on --- this is GREAT Dip!

I make basically the same dip except I omit the 1/4 cup of milk and use 1/2 cup of heavy cream and a few grinds of cracked black pepper. The cream not only makes it richer and more decadent but it thins it out enough so that chips don't break as easily. When I want to use it for baked potatoes I add some diced bacon fried very crisp, grated sharp cheddar and some sliced green onion tops.

Very good. I would recommend that you make it the night before. That way all flavors blend and the onion soup has time to soften up real well. For a crowd I would double up.

Stir up the store bought kind, put in a bowl, and you can't taste the difference.

This is so easy, and my mom made it for years, but I think it is better with sour cream and if you sift out all the thingys and add some chives. Another reviewer said they like it added to cottage cheese...there is a restaurant here in Denver that is semi-famou for their cottage cheese, and I am positive that they put onion soup mix in it!

My mom made this all the time when I was a kid - I grew up never knowing that "dip" was made with sour cream until I went away to college.  I use 1/2 a package of soup mix, add it to the milk for about an hour before mixing it with the cream cheese.  I add more soup mix if it's needed.  Add a little ketchup to the mix if you want another different taste (just use less milk then).

This is the recipe I grew up eating, with the exception of sour cream rather than cream cheese - a little more tartness than the cream cheese. Planning on a healthier twist to this version next time - using the recipe "Dry Onion Soup Mix" instead of buying a pre-made packet - I can control what the ingredients are and reduce the sodium and additives. Also using Greek yogurt rather than cream cheese or sour cream (although a reduced-fat cream cheese would also be a healthful alternative).

I grew up with the sour cream variety. the cream cheese is pretty good but where I live in France, I use creme fraiche which is right there between the milk and camembert

I gave this recipe a shot, as the use of cream cheese was intriguing. But I can honestly say, we found this dip way to thick, and the onion soup mix flavor was too overpowering.  This recipe needs something else, fresh herbs perhaps, to make it more palatable.

I grew up with this version of dip. I like using sour cream better but this is pretty good.
