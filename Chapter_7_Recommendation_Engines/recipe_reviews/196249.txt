This was delicious!  I made it veggie-friendly by using vegetable broth.  I also left out the white wine and just used a little extra vegetable broth.  Also subsituted the heavy cream with milk and it was still PLENTY rich and delicious.  I didn't have white pepper - so just used black.  A lovely way to use all that fresh asparagus!

Especially for this sort of asparagus preparation, I strongly recommend peeling the lower half (+/-) of the stalks to remove the woody outer portion. Once this has been done and the lower ends trimmed back, there will be 80 - 90% of the vegetable left, and it is SO much more delectable in chewing. That said, I have to dock this dish one point as the flavors are just too understated for my tastes. Next time, I will double the asparagus &, possibly, the onion (I used a Vidalia & perhaps a yellow would serve better). Will also increase the Parm by 1 T and pepper by 1/8 tsp. Possibly will increase wine to 1/2 C and reverse the water / broth ratio. Nevertheless, this is a most excellent recipe and it passed the "wife test" with high marks, which puts it into the permanent file.

Oh, this was soooo good! I decided to look for an asparagus risotto recipe after ordering this dish from an authentic Italian fine dining restaurant, here in Houston. It was so good and creamy, but the portion served there (even with us placing two orders) was not enough to please our craving. This recipe tasted exactly the same as the one we devoured at the restaurant and it was sooo easy to make. I switched the broth and water ratio but followed the rest of the recipe as is since this was my first attempt at making risotto. My husband has since asked me to make this at least twice a week and I haven't complained yet... I really can't stress enough how GOOD this risotto is!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

Oh my goodness, so good, slight changes I made were to use 3 cups of broth and 2 cups of water and used fat free half and half in place of the heavy cream--everyone loved it!

First try at Risotto and it ended great. Second try and deviated from this recipe and it ended uncooked after the 5th cup of liquid and ended up nasty. Maybe because I didnt use cream and I tried the italian style of putting cold butter at the end which made it worse??   Stick to this recipe, the whipping cream is key, it will make your risotto more favorable and rich and creamy. Butter instead of oil is another thing I didnt do the second time and oil is not good enough. Butter gives it a richer taste. All in all I will make my risotto just like this recipe except I will add other veg's and seafood.

It was phenomenal, but I used all broth and no water, I also used skim milk instead of cream.  I feel like it would have been very bland using water and it was still super creamy and delicious without all those calories.

Great recipe for my first time making risotto!  I made a few adjustments as well.  I used half and half and a little extra cheese instead of heavy cream, and vegetable broth instead of chicken.  I think I may have accidentally measured 3 cups veggie broth and 3 cups water, but still, each cup was absorbed nicely by the rice.  I added some chopped mushrooms since I didn't have a full pound of asparagus.  The result was a perfect contrast of creamy risotto and crunchy asparagus, and it actually took less time than the recipe anticipated.  Delicious.

Only four stars could be my fault.  I misread the amount of pepper and put in 1/2 tspn...too much.  The texture and flaver otherwise is excellent.

I have always been afraid to try risotto because I heard it is a lot of work.  HOWEVER, this was delicious and relatively easy!  My husband even said it was just as good as being out in a restaurant!  Thanks for this great recipe!

Took someone's advice and used 3 cups of broth (2 cans) and 2 cups of water instead of what was called for. Substituted evaporated milk for the heavy cream, omitted the wine and used regular black pepper. it was really delicious!

A good basic risotto recipe, and it can be tweaked to suit what you have on hand.  If, like I was, you are looking for something to do with that half pound of asparagus in your fridge, you can add a half pound of whatever else you have on hand - in my case it was turnips.  I wouldn't agree with whoever said 3/4 c. is enough liquid - it was still undercooked and crunchy for me.  If you add a little at a time and keep testing it till it's done, you'll be fine.  With that in mind I couldn't say how much liquid I used.  Also I wasn't about to run to the store for cream so I used milk, and it turned out great.

First time making risotto which is a fav of ours in restaurants. This is a wonderful recipe.  Followed the recipe using other suggestions about 3C broth and 2 C water.  It was totally amazing.  I didnt have cream so used skim milk and used a shallot since I didnt have an onion.  It was absolutely delicious and perfect. Skipped the salt too since broth is salty anyway and didnt need it.  Thank you for sharing.

This was so good!! I did add some minced garlic in with the onions. Could probably substitute milk for the cream to make it a little bit lighter. The only thing that could've made it better would've been a nice filet mignon.

Easy to make and absolutely delicious. I left out the salt, though, as the chicken broth made it salty enough for my taste.

Could not be better. Steamed the cut asparagus rather than sauted it. Creamy rice and plump asparagus make a truly delicious combination. A standout for our Easter dinner. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

This also was my first experience with making a ristto.  This far surpassed my expectations.  It is marvelous!!  I only made a couple of changes.  I used red wine instead of white as it was all I had on hand, and with the final addition of the chicken broth mixture, I added some diced raw shrimp.  YUM!  It is ahmazing and I'll definitely be making this again and often!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

Absolutely exceptional! I added portobella mushrooms and 50% more chicken stock and my family raved about it. Make sure to mix it almost constantly as the water is soaked up by the rice or the rice will stick to the pot.

If you're looking for risotto with asparagus, stop here and make this.  I did change the water amount to 1 1/2 cups and the broth to 3 1/2 cups, upped the onion to 2/3 cup, and the parm to 1/3 cup.  It's very good and satisfying, and turned out well the first try.  A suggestion would be to add 1 tablespoon lemon zest with the asparagus to add a lemony flavor, if you want to change it up.

Really mushy - if you prefer al dente risotto, quit with the broth after 3/4 of it is used.

This is great!  I made this with regular rice and it came out perfectly! I added 4 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water.  No other changes are necessary.

Delicious!  Tasted like a dish from a fancy restaurant.  I added Prosciutto ham to make it a main course.

I quite liked this dish. I've never made risotto before, so I hope I made it correctly. I used a shallot for the onion since it didn't specify. Very good!

This was so good!  I used 3 cups of white wine and herb chicken broth (College Inn) and 2 cups water.  Used black pepper instead of white and added some mushrooms with the onion.  Otherwise, exactly as written.  Will definitely make this again.

Well worth the time making this delightful dish! My family devoured this!! The only change I made was to double the asparagus and add just a touch more of the spices to compensate.  I will be making this again soon! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first time making risotto and it turned out perfect! It was delicious!!  I followed the suggestions of others and switched the water to broth ratio and also added more salt and more cheese.  This will be a staple in our house!!

This was totally delicious! I love risotto so much was tired of making the boxed kind. I switched the broth and water like some suggested and used veg broth to try and make it a bit healthier =) Even my picky family totally dug this! I made a batch that I'm going to bring over to a get-together tomorrow and reheat in the oven. I know they'll love it!

This is great.  I added a 14.5 oz can of fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic - drained.  Add it at the end with the asparagus. I blanch the asparagus as well. I've made a lot of risotto recipes and this one is my fave!

Risotto is a dish that you can add anything to and it comes out delicious.  The key is to not leave the kitchen while cooking this.  Also, heat your broth and/or broth water mixture for easy absorption and uniform heating.  You can easily cut the cream in 1/2 or not use it at all.  The recipe will still be delicious.  Use freshly grated parmesan (or my favorite) Parrano cheese for a standout dish.

This was my first time cooking risotto and it turned out amazing!  It is a little time consuming, but worth it and overall inexpensive in the end.  I made breaded chicken breasts (with flour, egg, and panko bread crumbs) and added it, which was bomb.  Ups the calories, but so good.  I also reversed the chicken broth water ratio.  Seriously, so good though.

This had the perfect taste and consistency a risotto should have. A bit hard to make, but worth the half an hour of standing by the stove. Everyone liked it, big and small. Healthy too!

I used pecorino as the cheese, and increased the stick so I used only 1 cup of water. This is a very fine risotto. I think I could have cut back in the cream a bit, but it was delicious.

I love this recipe!  I always add a small handful of sliced and sauteed shitake mushrooms to this, they add nicely to the richness.  I also use half and half instead of heavy cream and it still turns out wonderfully. Also, I use my homemade chicken bone broth for this, which may be one reason that it is so wonderful - note that if you use a canned/boxed broth, the rice will take on the flavor of the broth you use, so if you buy cheap or yucky-tasing broth you'll end up with an off-tasting risotto.  I just use a frozen container of my own broth (2-3 cups) and the rest water.

I have always wanted to try making risotto, but had always heard how difficult it was to get right. It turns out to be a little time consuming but not very difficult at all. Such a great recipe. THe only thing I did different was add a little extra parmesean chesse. Served with sticky rotisserie chicken from this site. Great meal.

Fantastic!  Instead of stock, I always have some chicken soup base at home.  For the liquid, I simmered 5 cups of water and added about 1/2 as much of the soup base as I would add for chicken soup.  It came out amazing!  Great recipe, I think I'll be making this frequently!

Good God!!!  This is FANTASTIC!!!  Cooking this dish is EASIER THAN IT LOOKS-reading the directions.  I must say though, I tried to reduce the amount of salt by about half of what the recipe called for and found that the second time I made the dish for a dinner party-which everyone positively commented on the dish-I used the required amount of salt and it came out PERFECT.  My boyfriend usually does all of the cooking, and I looked this up and decided to give it a try and he loved it.  I am going to try using a bit of garlic in the next attempt, but if you want to impress your friends or just treat yourself, TRY THIS!! You'll see.  3/5/2010:  I added a minced clove of garlic and WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  My boyfriend baked 2 salmon fillets and I made the Risotto.  This is an excellent accompaniment.  A nice dry chardonnay is definitely a must.  I will say that you must portion out and do all of the prep work before starting this dish.  The pepper, salt and cheese can be placed in ONE condiment dish as these are among the final ingredients added at the last stage of the process.  Whomever submitted this recipe, THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH.  I will be keeping an eye out for you!!!

Absolutely the best!  I have dined at some top Italian restaurants and this Risotto was just as great as what I had been served at these establishments.  I followed the recipe and it turned out perfect. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Out of this world. I change the vegetables everytime I make it but it just gets beter and better. My kids love. it. It takes some time but it is not difficult. Just time consuming. Do not plan to leave the kitchen for 45 minutes. You don't need to stir constantly, you just should not leave it unattended.

Easier to make than I thought. Sub Vegi broth for chicken broth. Very tasty.

It was my first attempt at risotto and it turned out perfect! I switched the ratio of water to broth as others recommended and also added shrimp when sauteeing the asparagus to make it a complete meal. Will definitively make again!

I doubled the recipe (12 servings), and at a dinner party for 7 nearly all of it was was consumed to rave reviews.  I made this without any modifications, and it turned out better than any risotto I've had in restaurants.  This one is a keeper!

I used milk in place of the cream and cooking sherry for the wine. I intended on serving this as a side but it was so delicous the main course didn't even get touched. 5 stars.

This was a good dish but makes a huge portion.  I should split it in two the next time I make it.  It also could use some salt and pepper.

I made this dish, and added the meat of one lobster and grilled shrimp.  My kids were licking their plates.  My Italian mother-inlaw said it was one of the best risotto dishes she has had.  This is a great recipe.

This was awesome!! I made it for my roommate who loves risotto and she said it was amazing.  I made a few changes, I used fresh grated parmesean instead and I used zuchinni and sun dried tomatoes instead of asparagus.  It came out great and I will make it again soon!

I followed the recipe to the letter, it needs a little more flavor, maybe next time I would use all stock and no water. Very nice risotto. I used larger asparagus and peeled them before I cooked them and it was very nice.

OK..Everyone..This recipe is DELISH but BE PREPARED to STAND at the stove thee whoooole time. The trick to risotto is stirring it and stirring it and STIRRING it. Think "cream of wheat"! :) BUT it is a major hit! I added asparagus and some sliced mushroons. Super yummy! P.S If you can't find the rice that the recipe calls for, I used japanese rice "Botan". En-Jooooyy!

First time ever making OR even tasting risotto - and this is definitely one of my new favorites!!   Made exactly as stated, except also cooked 1 1/2 cups of sliced fresh mushrooms with the asparagus, which i WILL do again next time.  Love this recipe!!

Very good...added about 1/4 cup extra chicken broth for high altitude.  Will try "fat free cream" next time to make a bit more healthy.

I made this for my wife the other day.  It took some time to cook, but well worth the effort.  I didn't have the rice the recipe called for, so I used a Japanese rice.  I thought it turned out perfectly fine! My 3yr old loved it! Will make again!

See risotto all the time on my favorite chef competition shows but never had it or attempted to make it before.  WOW, it was awesome!!  I now am a risotto lover and impressed that I could make it so well with the help of this recipe!  Only thing I changed was swapped the chicken stalk/water measurements and added more asparagus cause I love it.  Delish!!

Delicious!  I added vegetarian bouillon and poultry seasoning to the water to make this vegetarian.  Make sure your broth is flavorful, as it characterizes the risotto. I also added some carrot and zucchini ribbons to the onions, cut down on the wine and used evaporated milk in place of cream.  Ended up with a very creamy dish that's fabulous!

This was my first attempt at risotto and it turned out beautifully.  Delicious and creamy.  I used low sodium vegetable broth and subbed that in for the wine as well.  Really great recipe.
