I used green onions, no veggie oil, no peas or mushrooms.  I added hard boiled eggs to the spinach.  Everyone loved it.  The recipe Makes about six hearty servings.  The sugar could be adjusted downward perhaps.  Really loved it!

We originally had this at a high end restaurant. This seems like the same thing with one exception. They added thin slices of hard boiled egg to the salad. Highly recommend you try it with the egg. Fantastic!

Loved this recipe.  I added hard-boiled eggs instead of black-eyed peas. This was wonderful.  You can't go wrong with Chef John's recipes. I love just about everything he makes.

This is clearly the best hot dressing recipe there is. My spinach salad consisted of spinach, hard boiled eggs, tomatoes, cucs, carrots, shredded cheddar and restraint style croutons. My husband doesn't care for hot dressing and gobbled it up, looking for seconds.

This was my first foray into warm bacon dressing! So good! I don't even care for black-eyed peas but they were great in this dish.

This was truly amazing. Everyone at the table raved and I was sending them home with the recipe. Even small, picky children will eat their spinach if you make this one. It's often the simple recipes that are the best and this is definitely one I'll make often. Thanks, Chef John! Thanks for the video too.

This was very good and felt special, like something you would normally get in a high-end steak restaurant.  I made a few omissions, but otherwise followed the recipe.   I didn't cook the bacon in extra oil.  I just let it fry up naturally and kept the bacon rendering for the dressing.   I thought the dressing was a little on the sweet side, so will cut back on the sugar next time.  For the salad, I omitted the black eyed peas and tomatoes (DH and the kids don't like them).  Next time, I think I might add some sliced red onion and hard-boiled egg.

I followed the advice of others and cut the sugar back to about 1/3 of a cup and I still found the dressing to be quite sweet.  Next time I'll cut the sugar back to maybe a 1/4 of a cup and up the onions by a lot.  I'm also thinking about tossing the beans with the dressing first with the thought of making them sticky so maybe they won't all fall to the bottom of the bowl.  Wish I'd added a little more salt, pepper and cayenne than I did.  Overall a lovely recipe.

My wife made this tonight and it was AMAZING! She did cut the sugar down just a little from 1/2 C to 1/3 C, but it wasn't missing anything!

I made this dressing with leftover bacon fat from my freezer (I never throw it away after breakfast!) and much less sugar and it was delicious.  Try it on Trader Joe's crunchy blend of cruciferous veggies.  Half a cup covers a 10 oz bag.

I substituted red wine vinager for the rice, and left off the sugar (dietary restriction) but divine and satisfying meal.  Would be nice for a small dinner party.

Great salad recipe!  I left out the cornstarch as I found the dressing to be plenty thick on its own. The dressing was great served cold for lunch the following day too. Definitely one of my new "go-to" salad recipes.  I did not and would not change a thing.

Really delicious salad! 1 lb of spinach leaves is a heluva lot of salad... we used about half that and it was still too much salad for 2 people. More bacon would not harm this. A bit less vinegar might be good for those sensitive to acidity. Keep your dressing nice and hot if you want those leaves to wilt.

Perfect! I have been trying to find a recipe that was like the fancy salad that you get at those expensive steak houses! I also loved the pre made refrigerated one that they did have available and now no longer. This was perfect and the flavor was spot on! Thank you so much!

I used this dressing with basswood buds instead of spinach. I also added shrimp, peas, dried cherries and sesame seeds. it was a crowd pleaser. I had just needed the dressing recipe. it was fantastic!

Delish!  We will be making this again.  Used 2 shallots instead of onions.  And 2T honey and 1/4 c Splenda instead of sugar.   Added some crumbled Gorgonzola after tossing in the dressing.  Very good instructions.  Easy to follow.  YUMMMMY!!

I have made this twice now. The first time, I felt it was a little too tangy, so this time I cut the vinegar down to 1/2 cup total (1/4 cup of each type). This recipe comes the closest to the hot bacon dressing my grandma used to make each summer to put on the first lettuces picked from the garden. Yum!

I substituted yellow mustard for Dijon! My salad consisted of grilled chicken, boiled eggs, toasted almonds, strawberries and scallions! ABSOLUTELY AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!!

The dressing was way too sweet. I should have heeded comments by other reviewers. My bf thought it had fruit in it -probably the apple cider. Not a fan. First disappointing recipe from Chef John, but each his own.

Exceptional. Dream-like quality. Doubled the Dijon mustard and reduced the white sugar by about 25%. This one will go in my vault of all-time favorites. Been searching for this exact recipe for years. Chef John hit a home run. And you'll love the fragrance in the kitchen as this dressing simmers.

I made the dressing almost exactly as the recipe except I didn't have cornstarch so I used flour instead. Dressing is phenomenal!  I used veges I had on hand so no blacke eyed peas or mushrooms.  Still tastes great with spinach, tomatoes, scallions, bacon crumbles and smoked Gouda cheese.  Will make again.

Didn't have some of the ingredients, but my main purpose of trying this recipe was to find a good hot bacon dressing. 

And I did, my wife doesn't care for mustard, but the Dijon blends in so well with the maple syrup one can hardly recognize it as mustard.

This one is a keeper for me.

I tried this recipe and instead of beans used baby portobello mushrooms and topped the salad with pan seared scallops and shrimp. Also, i used thick cut applewood bacon and it was incredible. great recipe. thanks

almost too sweet, next time I'm going to halve the sugar.  I also used left over bacon and 1/3 cup olive oil.  Delicious.

This was very good. I made the salad with egg, a light sprinkle of low fat cheddar cheese, mushrooms and grape tomatoes. I read through the comments before making so I used only a 1/4 cup of sugar and actually added probably at least 3 more tbsp. of apple cider vinegar. The dressing was perfect.  With the leftovers (this makes a good bit of dressing) I plan on eating it  with some boneless chicken breast. This was fairly easy to make as well. It was really delicious. With all the other protein in it you don't need the chicken, but it would be really good with a  some grilled chicken laid on top.

I just made this tonight and it is my new favorite salad dressing!  Just like a restaraunts.  I didn't use the peas and added an egg, but it was just like I like it. Delicious!
