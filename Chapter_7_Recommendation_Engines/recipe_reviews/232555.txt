My 15 year old son and I made this for his Spanish class. Very easy for kids to make which was good as I was notified of it at the last minute. :/ This is a very sweet dessert so went over well with children. My son thought using a banana pudding mix next time might be a good variation. Presentation of this dish is very impressive. It was a huge hit and he got 100% of extra credit points!  Thanks for sharing - it's a keeper!

Absolutely love these!!!!!!! So easy to make. But instead of the pudding mix, I use vanilla ice cream.  They are a huge hit with family and friends!!!

Very tasty dessert that is quick to make. My family said it was like mock-deep-fried-ice-cream. :)

I hope you got 100% for your assignment!

I also made these for Cinco de Mayo and they were a hit. Very delicious - and easy to make. I ended up cutting the flour tortillas into 1/8's instead of quarters - otherwise you end up with something similar to a solid tortilla bowl instead of something closer to a small cup. I heavily coated the tortillas (both sides) with the sugar/cinnamon mixture so they caramelized nicely in the oven. Frankly you could eat them plain at this point without the filling - but make the filling anyway :). I baked them for 11-12 minutes instead of 10, but that's probably my oven. Note that even though it says to "fold in" the whipped topping, you really have to vigorously stir it in. The pudding/cream cheese/milk mixture is like a pile of (delicious) glue at that point so forget about being able to "fold" anything into it. A tablespoon of filling on each tortilla "cup" will suffice as these are VERY sweet. As a final touch, I finely grated some chocolate (a cold Hershey bar) over each one instead of the maraschino cherry. Make these and you'll be glad you did!

This was delicious! I ended up making about half of the recipe (24 tortillas) for a small group. I bought a medium sized tortilla which fit the cupcake pan better when cut into 4ths. I substituted cold, finely grated Hershey's chocolate bar (instead of syrup) over the cream filling and added a sliver of strawberry instead of the cherry.

I made this for Cinco de Mayo and it was awesome!  Everyone I served it to loved, loved it!  Easy and fun to prepare.  I would say though that this should be consumed the first day, the next day the tortillas were a little soggy.  Will be making often and sharing this recipe with many!  Thanks for a new treat for me and mine...

Made these for taco night at church. I had planned to double the  cream filling. But after making 48 tortilla cups, I had plenty of filling left from the original recipe.  Everyone loved this and are begging me to make it again soon. They suggested I make the fruit salsa (also from this site) to spoon over the tops! We also had condensed milk to put over the tops.

I found making the cups to be very time-consuming, so I cut the recipe in half, baked tortilla chips instead of cups & served them on the side with fresh strawberries.  Everyone loved it!

This was a tasty creative dish. The family was impressed and went for seconds. I halved the recipe because 40 was too much for us. I also did not add the cherries but think it was just as good. This would be great for a family reunion or party. It is pretty easy to make and would be great to make with kids. Will make it again.

This was super easy and a huge hit at our Cinco De Mayo party.  They were just the right size.  We used the smaller size soft tacos.  It was light and not filling.
