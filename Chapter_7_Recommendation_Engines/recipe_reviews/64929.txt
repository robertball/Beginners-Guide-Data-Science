I took the advice of some other reviewers and spiced this dish up a bit. Instead of just the regular diced tomatoes, I used the Del Monte brand with Garlic and Onions. I used the alloted amount of Italian seasoning and this dish turned out AMAZING! Served with some fried green tomatoes, I almost want to say that this was the perfect dish!

It is Yummy.  Great with Mash Potatoes. I didn't have any zucchini, will try this when I get some in the summer.  I cooked this in my slow cooker for about 4hrs.

Being half Italian, anytime I see the ingredient "italian seasoning", I automatically add minced garlic too. I sauteed the zucchini in a seperate pan, but followed the original recipe and added garlic otherwise - simple, inexpensive, and yummy. Will make again!

Nice simple dinner, a different idea for cubed steak, & tasted V. Good! I ommited the diced tomatoes & had mixed veggies on the side instead of zucchini. I also added about 1/4 cup water to the tomato sauce to make the sauce thinner (the flour thickens it nicely). My hubbie said it was "just like mom's".. that sounds like success to me! will definitely make again.

It was very bland.  I had to throw it out and start all over :(.  I added 1/2 of a bell pepper, 2 more Tbsp. Italian seasoning and 1 Tbsp. garlic powder to it and it came out wonderful!

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  Served over egg noodles, the cube steaks were fork tender and the zucchini was a good touch.  Hubby and I both give this a thumbs up.

My husband and I were housesitting last New Year's Eve. The house was on the water and Maine and we decided to spend the evening alone. Wanting an easy recipe we found this one and tried it -- we loved it. I think we ended up burning the tomato sauce a little, but it made all the better. We've renamed this "New Year's Beef."

DELICIOUS.
I added some garlic to the mix and didn't cook it quite an hour (we were hungry!) but the cube steak turns out very tender.  Will definitely make again.  Served over whole wheat spaghetti.

So easy to make and a good way to serve a boring cube steak.  I served this over egg noodles.  The family approved.

DELICIOUS!!!   This was amazing. I generally do not buy cube steaks as a result of how tough they always seem to turn out regardless of how they are cooked. With the economy and tough times that have set in I have had to look at things differently and buy cuts of meat that at one time I didn't bother with. I came on allrecipes searching for a way to try some cube steaks and ran into this recipe. WOW, fell apart in our mouths... amazing. Never have I eaten such a tender piece of meat. The tomatoes and veggies only added to the incredible eating experience. I will make these not only again but they are not a regular part of our menu. I prepare them at least twice a week. The whole family LOVES them! I do not see how you can mess this one up! I did add a little more seasoning as I tend to like it a little bit more seasoned than some. I also used yellow crooked neck summer squash and still... amazing! You have to give this one a try! THANKS!!!

This was great and very simple to make. I modified it by omitting the flour and olive oil (substituted a little bit of Pam cooking spray) and adding garlic and the onion when cooking the cube steak. After the meat was browned I put everything else plus some garlic powder in a slow cooker for a couple of hours. When I came home, I added the zucchini and cooked some whole wheat rotini to serve it over. This was delicious, simple and healthy. 5 stars.

This was ok. I thought it could use some more flavor, it was just sort of bland and tomato-y. I'll try it again, but I'll use more seasonings. We served it over whole wheat penne, it was nice that it made sort of a meaty spaghetti sauce in the pan.

I'm going to call this recipe Cubed Steak Cacciatore! I made it pretty much like the recipe called for, except adding minced garlic and Italian seasoning and throwing in some green pepper strips for 20 minutes at the end (I simmered the meat and sauce for one hr, then put in the green peppers for ten min, then added the chopped zucchini for a final 10 min.)I then served it over brown rice, but it would be wonderful over spaghetti noodles as well. As others have said, it's great to have a recipe that makes the rather lowly and unappealing cubed steak into a meal we look forward to and have definitely put on our Do-Over List!

I decided on this recipe last minute and was pleasantly surprised. I truly believe that the ingredients you use make all the difference. I used a can of diced tomatoes with green pepper and onions, and a can of Hunts garlic and herb pasta sauce mixed with about half tablespoon sugar to offset the acidic tomatoes. I use garlic liberally on most meats before cooking, and this just adds to the flavor. Simmered for about 40 minutes until tender. Served over angel hair, sprinkled with fresh parmesean. Served with a salad and whipped up fresh hot garlic bread. Wow, very tasty. Hubby loved it, too. IVe learned that when using a recipe created by someone else use your own sense of taste for the seasonings. Not everyone has the same taste. Thanks for  this wonderful recipe!

This was so delicious. I did not make any changes to the recipe at all. I served it with egg noodles and a salad as suggested and it was a great meal. This is a definite "keeper" recipe!

I am sure this recipe would be considered yummy for those who are used to eating fast food. However, I will not repeat this recipe. I should have known that the diced tomatoes would make it too acid.

This was a first. I don't usually buy cube steak, but it was cheap at the time so I thought why not? I dind't have any flour on hand and my husband doesn't care for gravy and I didn't bother with shaking it in a bag, instead I laid out my seasonings on a plate (I used garlic powder, italian seasoning, chopped onions, sugar, onion power, seasoned salt and regular salt) I also poured on a little worcheshire sauce before I browned the meat. Not a fan of Zucchini, so I used mushrooms instead. 
Came out great! Will use this recipe again, but will probably alter the seasonings a bit more.

This recipe turned out great! I added some minced garlic for more flavor. I forgot to add the onion but it still tasted great. Next time I will let it simmer longer than an hour because it wasn't quite as tender as I thought it would be.

Just tried this and it was very good.  I did add some sugar as I believe it takes the bitter taste away from the tomatoes.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe however i could in bulk for a company and i found that trying to let the tomatoes cook in the pan wasnt going to work so i panfried the steaks and then added the tomato combination over the top of the steaks and baked at 350 for 20 mins and this worked out very well and everyone enjoyed this.

My family loved this simple but tasty recipe!  Takes a little more time simmering than I expected, but the meat was very tender, the sauce rich and aromatic, and the whole thing was super simple.  I served over egg noodles, topped with mozzerella.

I made this tonight and it was so good. Whenever I try a new recipe, I tell my husband that it's " an adventure in eating" and I want his honest opinion on it. I followed the recipe exactly as it was and put it on top of egg noodles.  Topped it with Parmesan and served it with garlic bread.  It was a hit and I will make this again!

This is the best recipe for cube steak that I've had, which is so nice since it's so easy to make and uses ingredients that are usually on hand. My husband even said that this should always be my go-to recipe for cube steak!  I added garlic powder to the flour coating when browning the meat.  After browned, I placed everything in a slow cooker and set on high for about 3.5 hours (I always have to prepare meals during my kids' naps, so slow cooker is the way to go for dinners!)  I sauteed the zucchini/summer squash on the side, which was a good side dish, but I probably wouldn't put it on top, because the dish had enough flavor without it. Served on top of mashed potatoes--excellent.

I had to substitute a bit - no Italian seasoning, so I used crushed garlic and some basil, and diced tomatoes with chilis and yellow squash.  This was great on the pasta!

Tried this tonight...definitely yummy!  Used my home grown canned diced tomatoes and home grown italian herbs.  Added garlic as well.  Subbed yellow squash for zucchini...it's what I had.  Big hit!  It will definitely go into the rotation of my once a week beef meals.  Give it a try!

This was excellent, ud our homade sauce which already has garlic, mushrooms, olives etc. I made it about three weeks ago, and plan on making it again tonight, my wife and son loved it. I will probably incorperate this into my venison recipes. This was awesome thanks!

Very good! Im use to the basic cube steak and gravy but this was a nice change up. Cube steak meets chicken parm without the chicken lol. I did however follor reviews as well as my own taste accents with adding garlic, thinly chopped green pepper to simmer with the onion as well as def adding additional italian seasoning, a pinch of sugar, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Yum-o served over wheat penne with garlic bread and augratin potatoes! Family favorite!

This recipe was simple yet extremely satisfying and one of the best Cube Steak recipes I've prepared. Next time around I think I will add a little bit more Italian Seasoning, Garlic, and maybe a hint of Basil in order to really kick the flavor up a notch!

I made a few changes of my own but it was still ok. The only thing is that it is hard to brown them with the flour.

A very simple (& tasty) dish to prepare.  I found the sauce to be a little too thin so I added a couple of TBLS. of tomato paste.  I sautéed the zucchini & about 8 oz. fresh mushrooms in EVOO separately in order to “cook out” most of the moisture before adding it to the cube steak mixture.  The only change I’d make is the addition of a diced potato.

I GAVE THIS A 4 STAR RATING BECAUSE IT IS SUCH AND EASY BASIC RECEIPE THAT
YOU CAN REALLY GET CREATIVE WITH, OR FOLLOW EXACTLY FOR AN EASY MEAL. I DID
HAVE TO LET THE CUBE STEAKS COOK ALMOST TWICE THE TIME STATED IN ORDER TO GET THEM NICE AND TENDER. I SERVED OVER NOODLES,ADDED GREEN BEANS AND MUSHROOMS, SINCE I DID NOT HAVE SQUASH. GOOD WAY TO COOK CUBE STEAKS.

I was looking for a swiss steak recipe and this came up in my search.

It was very delicious. My husband loved it and he is the biggest critic of them all :)

Skipped the tomato sauce because I didn't have it on hand. Added a little bit of sliced green pepper and some garlic.

The steaks came out nice and tender, and I hate cube steak, the sauce came out very tasty.

I will make this again.

Really good recipe.  I left off the zucchini and used whole canned tomatoes instead of diced because that was what I had on hand.  Since I  had only two cube steaks, I have enough sauce left to use later with pork chops or chicken.

I not a fan of cube steak, but this recipe did deliver. The cube steak was tender! The sauce was amazing.  I also used seasoned panko on the steaks instead of flour which I thought added a little more taste.

Great.  I added black olives at the end and topped it with Parmesan.  The steak is VERY tender.

My only issue was putting the cube steaks in a bag and shaking.  They broke.  Just dunk them in the flour mixture to keep them together.

This is really easy to make, and the steaks are very tender.  I usually use Rotel diced tomatoes with habaneros because we like things spicy.  Tonight I didn't have any, so I used regular diced tomatoes and added a little more Italian Seasoning, Cumin, and a splash of hot sauce.  I was out of tomato sauce, so I used some pizza sauce I had on hand.  I also added a tiny bit of beef stock to add a little more liquid to the mixture.  In addition to the onion, I added a small amount of sliced green pepper.  I don't like zucchini, so I never add it. My husband gives it 5 stars.

Loved this! Thank you for giving me another way to fix my husband's favorite meat besides CFS! This was simply delicious and will be a regular in our fall/winter rotation. I served this with orzo and he loved every bite. Thanks for posting! The only change I made was reducing the quantity of meat by half.

Very bland, I should have marinated my steaks overnight because they had absolutely no flavor. If it weren't for my homemade tomato sauce, this dish would have been a total loss.

No zucchini so, I put in green pepper, fresh garlic, fresh herbs , peeled fresh tomatoes. Fresh grounded pepper. Then put it over organic wheat linguine.

Member comments were helpful, and was told it was excellent. I needed to know whether or not to simmer such a steak. I am not a meat eater. I made it for a family who is going through an unfortunate time. I made mash potatoes as suggested by a member.  I did marinate it in a lil olive oil & fresh seasonings for 2 hours. Looked good. This site was helpful.

As far as cube steak goes, this turned out real well. I am not a major fan of cube steak but even I liked it.  I made the recipe as shown but for more servings but layered it with a bed of white rice then a slice of provolone cheese then the meat/vegetable mixture. And finally topped with a sprinkle of grated fresh parmesan cheese. Everyone loved it!

This turned out to be at great dish that the entire family loved!  The cube steak was incredibly tender and it smelled great while cooking.  Even the kids commented on how good it smelled.  I added some garlic to the mix and a little cajun seasoning to the flour mixture before cooking.  It turned out a little spicy but delicious!  Not an everyday dish but good on occasion and a new way to make cube steak!

This was good, but has room for improvement. I pretty much made the recipe as is, but sauteed the onions with some garlic to up the flavor a bit. I also added a bit more seasoning. It's a good base recipe, so I will make it again with a few more changes.

Family loved it.  I had some frozen spaghetti sauce that I had made a few weeks ago so I used that over the meat.  I served the zucchini on the side since hubby doesn't care for it.  And I sprinkled the whole thing with mozzarella cheese.  I served it all with mashed potatoes.  Mmmm

Very good!  I considered trying it in the slow cooker, but decided to stick with the listed cooking method.  Glad I did because my husband said it was one of the best cube steak dishes I've made.  The meat was tender, flavor just right, a little saucy, but I like sauce (too bad I didn't serve it with rice!).  I'll make this again (lots of cubed steak in the freezer!), but may try the slower cooker next time now that I've tried the proper way.

Used deer burgers instead of cube steak because I accidentally defrosted them. Added mushrooms and a little Italian seasoning. Served with boiled potatoes taht were just barely mashed. Very yummy!

Well I have to say that I look at this website and have taken recipes which were ok. But this one deserves my stamp of approval. This was GREAT! I will be making it more often.

Thanks

This was great!! I didnt have zuchinni so I used mushrooms like some other reviews. I also added a clove of garlic and when I floured the cube steaks I added some steak seasoning. But this really rocked!!

I really liked this recipe.  Fed my family of four and they all liked it.  I didn't add zuchini, as I didn't think it would go over well with the boys.  I used Del Monte diced tomatoes with oregano, basil and garlic, so I omitted the italian seasonings.  It was very flavorful.  Thank you.

I thought this recipe was delicious.  The only thing I did different is that I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and added a little garlic.  LOVED IT!

The steaks were delicious and very tender but the df didn't enjoy the sauce much. Had to scrape it off for them.

Not bad. I sauteed the onion and zucchini with some garlic in the skillet, then threw the cube steaks in to brown. I added the rest of the ingredients, heated them through, then put them in a pyrex dish and baked them, covered, for an hour. The cube steaks turned out a little tough but this may well have just been those particular cuts, as the ones I've had before were quite tender. I liked the sauce more than the meat - reminded me of ratatouille. Over noodles, I think it would make a good vegetarian dish.

This didnt turn out good for me at all.  The meat was tough & dry & I added water.  The steaks shrillved to little shoes soles.  Not sure what I might have done wrong.  The recipie was so easy.
