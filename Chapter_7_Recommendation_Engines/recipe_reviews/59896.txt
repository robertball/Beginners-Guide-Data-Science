This was a good basic recipe and with additions/changes it was amazing! Used french bread and omitted the shrooms ( I do not like). Added balsamic vinegar and Italian seasonings. My guests loved and they all wanted the recipe. Thanks for a great idea.

Pretty good, but I'll not use mushrooms again.  They completely dried out
