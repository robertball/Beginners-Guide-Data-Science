This dish is a good simple dish, but if you want some real flavor, you have to nurture it a bit. I took this recipe, but changed it as such: It's fine to deglaze with the wine, but cook the sauce in a different skillet. When starting the sauce, use a bit of olive oil, and take some shallots, minced onion, or shaved red onion, and simmer it in the oil. Add a bit of minced garlic. Take some basil leaves and throw those in the oil for one minute, and then add the tomatoes, etc. The flavor will be MUCH more substantial. I found the regular recipe to be a nice family dinner recipe, but not much more (in case you want to impress).

I made this recipe after checking out the review and I too got the same review from my boyfriend, that it was restaurant quality.  Even my Italian roommate who's from Milan loved it and said it was great.  The only thing is I couldn't find Italian sausage at my local grocery store that was not already in a sausage casing. I bought it anyway and squeezed the sausage out.  It worked well but I also used hot sausage which I think added some flavor.  Considering the recipe doesn't call for any spices I think the spicyness enhanced the flavor.  Another thing I found was cooking the pasta to al dente was still too long and by the time it was baked in the oven it came out softer than I wanted it.  Next time I'll only cook the penne about 5 minutes in boiling water or I'll immediately submerge it in cold water to  the cooking.  Other than that the recipe is a keeper and I'll be making it again and again.

LOVED THIS!!! BUT, I changed it a tad, I used a smaller can of tomato sauce and used a jar of garden style spaghetti sauce (which has green peppers and mushrooms) instead of the tomatoes and tomato paste.  I liked subtle taste of wine in the pasta bake.  My family just gobbled this up.

My husband and I rarely find anything that we both like when it comes to just about anything, but especially food.  But last night we both loved this dish.  I knew it was a hit when he wrapped it up really well to save the leftovers.  I didn't have any wine, so I just omitted it, I added a dash of sugar to cut down on the tomato zing and added some oregano.  We will be having this again and again. Thanks!

This was a big hit in our house last evening. Yummy! I didn't have white wine in the house when making the dish, and it STILL tasted great. I also used turkey sausage in the dish, to cut down on some fat.

Rating based on changes noted below:
Cooked italian sausage w/o the onions & oil, used red wine instead of white wine, used cabernet marinara sauce, instead of the tomato sauce, used fire roasted tomatoes and garlic powder instead of canned tomatoes and garlic.
Once the pasta was cooked, I reserved some of the water, added the water to the sauce, added about 1 tsp of italian seasoning, and also added in some ricotta cheese.  Mixed the pasta, and sausage mixture together, and then put it into a casserole dish.  Instead of using all mozzarella, I used a 6 cheese italian combo, and then added a small amount of parmesan cheese...this was fantastic!

This recipe is missing two key ingredients - garlic and basil. Once you add those, it takes this up to five delicious stars! Also, when browning the sausage and onions (and this is the time to add the garlic, mince two or three cloves and saute with the meat and onions), you do NOT need to do this in the oil called for. The sausage will provide more than enough fat for the saute without adding more. It's a waste of your olive oil, so just leave it out. When you add the tomatoes to the pan, that's the time to add about a teaspoon of dried basil (and even a 1/4 teaspoon of oregano if you like, that adds a nice flavor to the dish too!).

We really liked this.  To make it more "kid-friendly" for my picky 11-yr old, I added pepperoni to the top of the casserole before the cheese.  He really liked it.  I also added about 1/2 tsp of Italian Herb Seasoning, although after eating it, it probably didn't need it. It was flavorful enough with the other ingredients.  The pepperoni will be a standard ingredient when I make this again, though.

Not being a big baked pasta fan, my husband saw I was making this and looked a little disappointed. But, once he ate it, he changed his tune. He really liked it and so did I. The only change I made was I added a couple of extra cloves of garlic while cooking the meat and onions.

The family really enjoyed this and it reheated very well the next day.  I will use spicy sausage next time though or add crushed red pepper.  My husband thought he could taste the wine (he didn't complain about it) but I couldn't specifically detect it.  Thought it had great flavor.

This turned out really well...even my picky husband gave me the "go ahead" and prepare again in the future.  Like another reviewer, I too used spaghetti sauce in place of all the canned tomatoes.  I didn't use near as much cheese called for...I sprinkled on just enought to cover the top.  I also used "hot" italian sausage which gave it a little kick.  Good Recipe.

I rated this recipe three stars, but my wife indicated it was more than three stars. To me, it was garden variety pasta; the 1/2 cup of wine didn't seem to add much to the flavor. I must leave open the possibility that I wasn't as hungry as my wife, tasting the sauce along the way to try to pump it up a little. I did add a little basil and salt. As it was, the sauce seemed a little flat. Since my wife ranked it highly, I'm giving the recipe the benefit of the doubt with four stars and will try it again sometime.

SOOOOO yummy! I made this to feed 25 high school girl basketball players ( I quadrupled the recipe) and it was a hit.  They went back for seconds.  IM giving it 4 stars and not 5 as I thought that the sauce as written in the recipe was a little too bland and acidic for my taste.  I like a little more robust flavor.  So I added minced garlic, beef base, chicken base, white pepper, italian seasoning, onion powder and red wine rather than white wine and white sugar.  I also only boiled the pasta for 5 minutes, and they came out almost too soft after baking ( I did use a nesco) so next time I will not cook the pasta at all.  Turned out great though!  I will make this again for sure, the sauce is a great base for me to use.

I fixed this last night and my husband and 2 year old daughter loved this! The only thing that I did differently was not adding the white wine. This was a last minute recipe and I couldn't find it at the local store. Also, our family loves cheese. So I added the mozzarella cheese, but I also added Colby Jack cheese on top of that. It was extra cheesy and so yummy!

I can't really rate this honestly as I, too made a few changes to the recipe.  I omitted the wine as another reviewer had and added sugar to the sauce as well as oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, basil and parsley.  It was a huge success with the husband for sure.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this the first time when we had a few friends over all day and I couldn't spend a lot of time in the kitchen. Still, I have a certain reputation (as a great cook) to maintain so I needed something easy that everyone would like. It went over very well. There were no leftovers and plenty of requests to have it again. 

I use garlic flavored olive oil, Italian flavored tomato paste and garlic and olive oil flavored diced tomatoes. 
Also, I use Beringer White Zinfandel. It gives it a great flavor. 
I don't like the texture of onions (but I love the flavor) so I sauté the onion separately and remove it before adding the sausage. 
I also add some fresh grated parmesan on top of the Mozzarella before the final bake.

With full size penne pasta, I like to add an additional half pound of sausage. I am considering trying mixing a ground chicken breast in with the sausage (in  place of the extra sausage) sometime. 

Today, I am making it again, using Barilla Mini Penne Pasta.

Listen to the "large, deep skillet" suggestion in the recipe.  I had to switch out my pan (too small).  It doesn't specify how to cook the sausage in the recipe.  I would suggest removing the casing after cooking it a little and then use a spoon (or spatula) to grind up the meat while in the pan.  This will resemble ground beef if done properly and will spreadload the flavor throughout the whole dish.  If you don't like chunks of tomato you can throw the diced tomatoes in a blender or processor for a few second and will have something a little thicker than sauce but not as chunky as salsa.  The recipe doesn't state where to use the olive oil but common sense would dictate that it is to saute the onions and sausage.  I also put a few drops in my boiling water to defroth it and add flavor to the penne.  Shoot me now, I used cheddar (white and orange) for this recipe instead of mozzarella as I had none.  The recipe was good not great, but could have been had I used the correct cheese with it.

This has become a staple of my repitroire (sp?).  I love it.  I use spicy sausage (or if not, then add some Cayanne pepper to the sauce), lots of garlic, add some frozen vegis, use more diced tomatoes as well as italian herbs and a tablespoon of sugar, and add parmesan cheese on the top.  DELICIOUS.  So filling.  So yummy.

I was forced to change this due to availability in my pantry.  First, I used hot Italian sausage from our local butcher and it is hot.  I didn't use the wine or tomato paste but rather Muir Glen fire roasted diced tomatoes and Contadina pizza sauce because that's what I had.  I added 3 cloves of garlic, a couple table spoons of fresh basil and some chopped flat leaf parsley mostly out of habit.  I took one reviewers advice and cooked the mini penne less than al dante.  I layered the pasta with the mozzarella because I always get it too crusty when I put it on top.  On top I used fresh grated Parmesian.  We really enjoyed it. Thank you for the post.

Tried out this recipe for the first time and my husband and I loved it! So much flavor and richness. I did have to make a few adjustments with the ingredients I had on hand... So I used polish sausage instead and put garlic powder in since I didn't have tomato sauce with garlic. A must try!

Excellent recipe. I used sweet Italian sausage. I didn't have the tomato paste so, I had to use a jar sauce (half a 16 ounce jar). I also had only red wine so, I used a little red wine and watered it down, I think I used only 1/4 cup of wine, instead of the 1/2 cup. The rest of the recipe I followed exactly and it was great! Such a wonderful flavor. Will make again! Thank you!

I hightly recommend this recipe for the sauce!!  The first time I made this dish, I loved the taste of the sauce, but wasn't pleased with the final baked dish.  So now I use this recipe for pasta sauce and serve it over shape pasta.  I love the Italian sausage in place of ground beef in the sauce, and my husband always RAVES about the taste (he loves all the meat).  My substitution were: adding minced garlic while sauteing the sausage and onions, using hot sausage or red pepper flakes to add some kick, and using chicken broth instead of white wine (don't ever have it on hand).  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it, everyone went back for seconds. I used half hot sausage and half sweet and the hot sausage gave it a nice spice flavor.

Super easy to make and very tasty.  I made it for Thanksgiving and my family loved it!  The next time I make it, I'll sautee mushrooms with the onions and sausages.  Like others, I didn't use white wine, but will try the wine next time.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe :)

This was very good. Even DH, who is not an Italian sausage fan, had two helpings. I cut back on the cheese to about 1 1/2 cups but wish I hadn't, even though I used a smaller, 8" x 11" pan. 
I also used rigatoni since I had it in the pantry and deglazed with white zin since I had it in the fridge.
Filling tasty and easy to prepare.

Exactly what I wanted. I made this using some homemade italian sausage, and it was amazing. The sauce was perfect, although I did add a little dried basil and oregano, and I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes with garlic. Didn't have any wine and it was fine without it. Make sure you cook the onions and garlic in EVOO first, then brown the sausage. Adding the raw onions in with the sauce is not a good method.

I made this exactly as written, and it was just okay.  Probably a one timer for us.  Basically a spaghetti sauce tossed with noodles, I felt I could had the same result with a jar of spaghetti sauce and not had to clean any pans :)

I haven't even put this together to put in the oven yet and the sauce tastes fabulous!  I'll come back after dinner to update the review.  BTW - I didn't have tomato sauce so I substituted a 14 oz. jar of pepperoni pizza sauce instead and add some fresh basil.  I may just have to use this sauce recipe as my go-to meat sauce recipe!  YUMMO!

My family loved this.  I too left out the wine.  I did add fresh zuccini both green and yellow and mushrooms. Since one family member is a vegitarian I made him a meat loaf pan size but I left out all sausage. It cooked in the oven along with the larger pan for the meat eaters.

We had this for dinner last night and it was a hit with everyone.  I noticed their are no seasonings listed for the sauce, so I went ahead and seasoned it to taste with parsley, basil, garlic & herb seasoning, and pepper.  It was delicious!  The cooking time seemed to be exact too which is always great.  Thank you for sharing, this will be going into our rotation.

This was really good! We're picky about pasta dishes and this was an excellent dish. Hubby thought it needed more sauce but what does he know? If he wanted spagghetti (again!) he should have said so! I thought it was perfect, and a nice change from the usual. I will definitely make this again.

This was very tasty and easy to prepare.  I changed a couple of things, first I added mushrooms and garlic and crushed red pepper flakes, I used sundried tomatoe sausage and substituted a can of spaghetti sauce in place of the tomatoe sauce as others suggested, I also topped with mozzerella, cheddar and fresh grated parmesan.  My husband, who is not a sausage lover, really enjoyed this recipe.  Will definitely be making again.

This is a very quick and easy recipe to put together that is hearty and satisfying and surpringly flavourful. I did not take the sausages out of their casings and simply fried them up with the onions and then sliced them into 1/4 inch medallions. Of course,you could add whatever else you wanted from the fridge - mushrooms, bell pepper - but honestly, this is very good as written and I appreciated having a simple but stick-to-your-ribs way to use up that otherwise-boring package of spicy sausages!

This recipe was great.  Even my husband liked it, without adding any condiment from the fridge, which he usually does (usually Tobasco)!  

I did change it a bit, as well, based on what I had at home and what other reviewers had said.  I didn't have wine, so I used a bit of white-grape juice, red-wine vinegar, and some water.  I also didn't have diced tomatoes with garlic, so I used whole canned tomatoes, cut them up myself, and added some garlic powder.  I also added some fresh basil and dried seasonings (bit more basil, since I didn't have much fresh, and parsley).  It was a bit oily -- I'm not sure you really need to use the olive oil, given how fatty the sausage is!  But when my husband went for seconds, I knew I should review this one.  

My kids were mixed -- 2 of 3 liked it.  The picky one didn't like the chunkiness of the sausage, but that's to be expected!  Will definitely make again.

This recipe is wonderful, so customizable.  I used wheat rotini noodles. Saute'd 4 cloves minced garlic in olive oil, put in cup of sliced mushrooms and dusted those with dried basil and thyme while they saute'd for about five minutes.  I did not have tomato sauce, so I opened a jar of store brand spaghetti sauce and poured over the mixture in the large saute pan. Added the drained noodles (do not rinse, just drain), mixed, and then put into the 9 x 13 glass baking pan. Topped with 8 oz of mozarella/provolone shreds and baked for 20 mins to melt the cheese. Final touch to sprinkle on fresh aged parmesan cheese on your warm serving.  FANTASTIC!

I really like to cook this dish.  I use Italian Sausage links sliced (into coins) and follow the rest of the recipe as indicated.  It's great, easy and works well any night of the week and for company.

I belong to a diva meal group, we each make 8 entrees once a month we can freeze and than swap.  My group asks me to make this for them on a regular basis.  It is simple to make, tastes great, and freezes well.

This was very good, a little mild so the Spict/Hot Italian Sausage is a must. Also, I recommend using flavored tomatoes for an extra something.

Yum!  After reading all of the reviews, I did add garlic and some spices.  We also get special italian sausage from a little bitty meat shop in Port Arthur, Tx.  It's called Nicks...best italian sausage I've ever had.  It made the dish...everyone pigged out!  Thanks for sharing!

So good! I added 3 cloves of fresh chopped garlic, dash of sugar and a little chicken broth. I followed the advice of others and used spicy italian sausage and some red pepper flakes. It was so zesty and flavorful! And the best part, the entire meal cost me less than $10. Can't beat that. Perfect to serve for friends/family.

I searched everywhere for a hearty vegetarian pasta to serve for guests.  I settled on this one substituting sausage for sauteed mushrooms and zucchini and whole tomato slices under the cheese.  Everyone *loved* it!  Next time I'll use sausage for my non-vegetarian family.  Cudos to a great dish with or without the meat!

This was not great. I noticed a very strong white wine flavor in the dish, and I am not a wine lover. I may have enjoyed it more if not for that flavor. I did not use onions in the recipe since my husband does not like them - but it could have used them. I gave the leftovers to my mom, who enjoys most dishes, but she didn't care for this one either.

My family really liked this.  It was quick and easy for a Sunday night dinner after working hard in the yard and household chores, I had little energy to put into a big meal.  It was ready and on the table within an hour and 10 minutes.  I added garlic with the onions and sausage and took another's advice and reduced the tomato by eliminating the tomato paste.  I also didn't have the type of cheese recommended, so substituted a little bit of chedder cheese on "one" side of the dish since some family members dont like melted cheese.  I also added some sliced olives and chopped marinated artichokes.  My 18 and 23 year old were actually fighting over the leftovers!  Thanks for the inspiration!

We all liked it but didn't care much for the mozzarella cheese.  Will leave it out the next time. May try ricotta cheese instead.  I used  link Italian sausage instead of ground, which was good.

DELICIOUS!!I made it pretty much as directed but after reading reviews, I added about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes.  I cooked the penne for 7 minutes instead of the 11 minutes on box directions for a la dente.  I did add about 4 or 5 tablespoonsful of ricotta for extra body.  Mixed all together, topped with  mozzarella and baked for about 30 minutes.  The texture was perfect--still a la dente and my husband LOVED it.  Easy, easy, recipe with great taste.

We loved this very easy and delicious dish.  I always have penne pasta on hand, that is, until today to make this.  No problem, the rotini worked out perfectly.  I used Johnsonville sausage because I think it’s a better quality sausage.  Also, I added a little leftover chopped red pepper I wanted to use up, and added minced garlic along with basil and oregano because I didn’t have the sauce requested in the recipe.  I wanted the sauce to remain moist so I omitted the tomato paste.  I put down a layer of pasta mixture and topped with half of the cheese, then the remainder pasta and cheese. It came out awesome.

This recipe was great and SOOO easy. I was able to just throw it together in about 20 minutes and let it bake for about 30 minutes. So yummy. 
I did make a few changes just due to what I had on hand and after reading some reviews. 

I used Hot italian sausage, thats what I had and also made seasoning very easy - I didnt have to add a thing!
I did not use white wine but that is because I forgot...
I used a large shallot instead of onion because I didnt have any onions
I added a large bell pepper, chopped
For my sauce, I found out that Prego now makes a "Spicy Sausage" flavor and that worked PERFECTLY for this meal. I also added a can of Italian flavor petite diced tomatoes just to keep it moist - I hate dry pasta...
Topped with mozzerrela and baked @ 375 for about 30 minutes.
Other than adding the pepper, I kept the recipe pretty much as is. I'm not sure what could be added to change it up but it was good and will be made again!

Delicious!  This is a wonderful recipe.  For those that like additional flavors or ingredients, I have added chopped red bell pepper, 1 cup of sliced mushrooms, 3 cloves of garlic, minced, and instead of the mozzarella, I add a bechamel with parmessan added at the end.  I do not use the tomato sauce or paste but use Classico Tomato Basil Pasta Sauce and San Marzano Tomatoes (I know, they are expensive) and a pinch of sugar.  You can sprinkle additional cheese on top if you like, then bake as written.  I make it especially for my 15 yr-old grandson.  He loves it.

I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.  After adding the garlic, parmesan cheese, and red pepper flakes, this recipe turned out great.  I mean delicious.

I substituted hot Italian sausage, because I already had that on hand, and that worked out well.  I really enjoyed the white wine flavor-glad I went out to the store to get that.  The only thing I want to improve next time is to decrease the fat (I could taste it), so maybe I will drain it on a paper towel and ommit the olive oil.  My brothers really liked it..they said it was "bomb," hehe

So  yummy! I made it exactly as it said with just a few modifications, I did use herbs and spices as well as red peppers and mushrooms and a big can of tomatoes not just the 14.5 ounce one that the recipe called for. This dish is really good

I enjoyed this as well as my two teenagers. Simple and easy dish. I was suprised at how much flavor it had for such a small list of ingredients. The only reason I didn't give it the full five star is because it was not a "wow" dish. I will definatly make this again.

I found this really good. I omitted the oil since sausage is fatty enough, worked just fine. I also put half the mixture in the pan, spread cheese over that, then the other half of the mixture and more cheese. I used a shredded italian blend. Definitely will make again.

A very yummy and filling dinner.  Good comfort food.  I used mild ground Italian sausage and it turned out great.  Originally I thought it might have too much of a tomato taste for my liking, but it really was great.  I think I'll try hot sausage next time to please my husband who loves a spicey kick!

This is a very easy wonderful recipe. I used only one can of vegetable pasta sauce and a small can of tomato sauce which was plenty of liquid. I also left my pasta a little under cooked for baking. I say it is a must to use the full two cups of cheese as topping. Great recipe....

This recipe turned out great!  I made some modifications I omitted the white wine.  Going off of the other viewers ratings I added 3 cloves of diced garlic and add about a tablespoon of oregano.  Instead of adding the olive oil I just bought the diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil.  As you can tell I love Garlic!  Hope this review helps!!

Nice dish, really heavy. I diverted from the recipe a bit; I used hot italian sausage rather than mild, and more tomato sauce and paste (2x's) as much as the recipe called for.  Without it the paste w/h been a bit dry.  The white wine gave it a nice flare!

This recipe was really good but did need added herbs and garlic. I sauteed 1 minced clove of garlic with the onions and sausage, and I added about a palm full of Italian seasoning and oregano as well as 2 cloves of minced garlic to the sauce and it turned out great. Thanks!

this was an amazing dish!  Even my super picky fiance loved it, he cant wait for me to make it again. It was so quick and easy.  I just made an easy version of it, i followed the directions, but instead of using all the seperate tomatoe cans, I used one jar of tomato basil pasta sauce and threw in some garlic along with the wine.  It turned out delicious! :o)

This is an excellent dish!  I changed just a few features based on the contents of my fridge... I used turkey italian sausage since my family doesn't eat pork (cuts some of the fat and calories too), and used Prego Classico in place of the tomato paste/sauce part.  I also added a scoop of Ragu Roasted Garlic Parmesan sauce and mixed everything together, then sprinkled the mozzerella over the top of everything.  My family is a little apprehensive of new recipes from this website due to a few disastrous attempts in the past, but they loved this one!  My husband called from work today to ask for that sausagey pasta thing for dinner. Yum!

This got great reviews when I served it at an impromptu gathering at my place. I must admit that I only glanced at the recipe and then kind of winged it from there. My boyfirend and I are vegetarian and our friends are meat-eaters...so I ran out and grabbed a package of veggie "sausage" which I was not a fan of at all, but the meat-eaters liked it. In the first step used a whole onion, about 7 cloves fresh garlic and a green pepper; I added to the pan with the tomato products a handful of basil, oregano, thyme and a little red anaheim for spice. I used dry red wine (a chianti...I didn't have any white). I set aside a portion of the sauce to make with gluten-free pasta for myself. My GF portion was great and while I didn't get to try the non-GF portion, my meat-eater friends and my boyfriend raved about the regular vegetarian version and kept going back for more. With three of them working on it there was only one portion left after an hour or so! All in all this recipe was a great guide, but the sauce definitely needed spicing up to meet personal flavor preferences as it is really bland as writen. I suggest reading a dozen of other reviews to see what people added and go from there.

This was tasty and easy.  I also "doctored" up the sauce with some basil, oregano, crushed red pepper and dash of sugar.  I also used whole grain penne to sneak some extra fiber in.  This will be added to the rotation.

Needed a recipe for some extra sausage, this fit the bill. Wonderful flavors. I used a chunky style tomato sauce instead of the tomatoes and tomato paste. Also added some portabello mushrooms.

A good recipe, but I agree with the other reviewers that spicy sausage is needed to give the dish some kick.  Also, I didn't have enough cheese on hand, so I just used about half a cup of mozzarella, and half a cup of Parmesan, and my family (who all LOVE cheese) thought that there was still plenty of cheese flavor.  Two cups seems like too much.
I also added squash and mushrooms to make it a little healthier.

This was ok. I thought it was really bland at first so I added some Italian herb blend, more garlic, a little shake of red pepper flakes, and I also added some extra-sharp Cheddar to the topping. If I were to make it again, I would use red wine - I didn't think the white added much to the flavor.

Additionally, italian sausage is not available in bulk form for about 60 miles, so I tried it with regular pork sausage.  Not a good idea.  It tastes like a very confused meal--breakfasty and dinnerish. Other than that I'm sure it would have been a good recipe.

This is a baked ziti (or penne) with sausage, without the ricotta, of course.  It was very tasty.  I added some oregano, parsley, basil, and sugar (to cut the acidity).  I made extra, so I put a tray in the freezer too.  Good thinking on my part, because my husband and son both said they hope we can have that again soon.  Thanks SadieQQ!

Absolutely wonderful!  I added about 1 tsp of orgegano, used can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, added some mushrooms and did not use the tomatoe paste because I didn't have any, but I will use it next time. Also sauted a couple of cloves of garlic with sausage and onions. It is so incredibly good.  Was going to have it for lunch, but my husband wanted it!  Thanks for a keeper!

This dish was wonderful!!  Not only was it easy to make, but there wasn't much clean up either. I took advice from a review to add garlic, use spicy sausage, and use pasta sauce instead of all the canned tomato stuff.  It turned out wonderful.  I will try adding chicken and more cheese the next time I make it.  This is a dish that will please any guest or family memeber!!

I'm sure people aren't going to like this because I basically ended up changing the recipe quite a bit but wanted people to know its very versatile.  First of all I used leftover sausage (smokies and not Italian style) that I diced up and fried again with the onion.  When onion was tender I added 1 tsp garlic and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning. The only sauce I used was one jar of pasta sauce (did not have wine on hand so skipped it).  I added pepperoni to the top as another reviewer suggested before sprinkling with parmesan and shredded marble cheese (because that's what I had on hand).   I'm not sure what made it so good... Maybe the combination of these basic ingredients... But it was delicious!!! It really tasted restaurant worthy! So, even though my creation was inspired by this recipe and ended up changed considerably,  it shows that it can be modified and still turn out great.!!!  :-)

Made this last night - hubby loved it!  Read the reviews & used some of the suggestions.  Used the fire roasted garlic diced tomatoes, added mushrooms & 3 garlic cloves.  Doubled the meat - 1 lb hot sausage, 1 lb regular sausage.  Italian seasoning & oregano.  Also, used a 6 blend italian cheese plus a little extra romano I had on hand instead of mozz. It was fabulous!  Almost forgot - merlot instead of white!

I really did like this recipe. I stayed pretty much in the perimeters of the recipe with the exception of the wine, I used just 1/4 cup of a good red, I smashed 3 cloves of garlic and added them (not minced) for easy removal,  I did not used a "bagged mozzarella" (too greasy) I used a good mozzarella which I shredded. I also added 2 TBS chopped Italian parsley toward the end of preparing my sauce just before mixing it with my pasta.  With a salad and crispy rolls this was a good winter time dish.  Next time I will try it with white wine, mushrooms and two or three TBS of cream.

A little bland. Perhaps more garlic, a splash of RED wine, and something green (spinach? Kale?) would add some "Oomph!" Or maybe use hot Italian sausage instead of mild...? As is, it was OK but nothing special.

Very easy to make.  I thought it was very good.  The guys said it could use a bit more seasoning.  I had added garlic salt since I used plain tomatoes, and a bit of pizza seasoning.  Still was a good supper dish with garlic toast!

Made this tonight for dinner and we liked it very much.  I'm glad I read other reviews because after the sauce simmered for the 10 minutes I tasted it and it seamed very plain.  I did take hints from other reviewers and added a little sugar, oregano, basil, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.  Maybe next time I make this I'll use hot Italian sausage instead of the sweet Italian sausage for even more flavor.  All in all this recipe is a keeper and was very easy to put together.  Thank you SADIEQQ for submitting this delightful, tasty recipe.

This is basic, good recipe. I've made a variation to this for ages. And it's never disappointed.
For starters:
Add garlic, ground turkey meat, basil, cilantro, oregano and sugar to the ingredient list.
Add 1, or 2 fresh garlic cloves to the onions. Add them after the onions become clear to avoid burning. * note: a bit of water lessens the onion/garlic burn. And allows for less oil * 
Mix half package of ground turkey meat & half package Italian sausage. Cook 'til brown. Add 1 can crushed tomatoes and 1 can diced. Mix. Add more fresh garlic. Add additional seasonings at will/according to taste. Add 1/3 cup sugar. Mix and simmer.
Cook pasta(of choice) in boiling, salted water for 9 minutes. Drain. DO NOT RINSE. Sprinkle with olive oil to avoid sticking. Set aside.
In a casserole pan add a half cup of cooked meat sauce to the bottom. Add pasta (of choice) to casserole pan. Add meat sauce to pasta. Mix. Bake at 350• for 25 minutes covered. Remove from oven. Top with cheese ( I prefer a blend of provolone, mozzarella & Parmesan ). Sprinkle dried, or fresh cilantro on top for color. Bake uncovered for 15 minutes. Remove, let sit for several minutes. Serve with salad, and warm garlic bread. Enjoy

This is a good, relatively fast casserole to make.  My only change, because of necessity, was to use monterey jack cheese instead of mozzarella. It is a good base recipe for those who like to tweek it to their preferences.  
Great as written though.

Very good for such simple ingredients! This is a keeper and a crowd pleaser!  I did add some basil and used a red wine (cabernet) in place of white wine but think the white would be fine too.

Meh. This was just so-so. I agree with many of the reviews on here. This needs SPICE!!! Italian-seasoned tomatoes will only add some flavor. I suggest subbing a HOT Italian sausage and / or seasoned tomato sauce and adding a handful of your favorite herbs to liven this up a bit. Without major modifications, this is a very bland, ho-drum dish. Maybe this will float your boat, but it did nothing for me. Thanks anyways, SADIEQQ. :)

The children liked it, but the adults found it bland tasting. It definitely needs some herbs and spices, like basil, oregano, garlic, and maybe some rosemary.

I always forget to review recipes, but I couldn't pass on this one.  I've tried a few baked pasta recipes, and this one definitely wins hands down.  Made a couple of changes--used a meatless meat substitute instead of the actual sausage, cutting fat and cholesterol, and added some oregano on top of the cheese because I saw people did that in the pictures and it seemed like a good idea.  Super quick; even turned the oven up a few degrees for the last few minutes to get the good crispy cheese on top, and it was still on the table fast.  Thanks!!

I have made this several times, even my picky kids will eat it.  It also freezes very well.  I vary the tomatoes depending on what I have on hand, and usually throw in mushrooms too.  This is a regular in our house.

Good base recipe.  My chardonnay gave the dish a subtle olive flavor.  We added spinach and used a few different cheeses.

I made this for my hubby and two teenage boys, added a salad, and everyone commented on how delicious the meal was and so for us it is definitely a keeper.  I started off by heating the olive oil, throwing in some minced shallots, minced garlic, chopped onions, frying for a bit before adding some hot italian sausage (the kind where you cut the casing and just use the sausage inside).  I used plain tomato sauce but instead of using regular diced tomatoes and tomato paste, I used "Aylmer Accents stewed tomates with Garlic and Olive Oil" and "Hunts Tomato Paste with Herbs and Spices".  The white wine really gave it a gourmet taste.  If you can take spicy like we can the hot italian sausage really added a wow factor, otherwise use the mild.  It was delicious!

This dish turned out really well.  I made the following changes: I used red wine instead (didn't have white) and chicken/turkey sausage to cut down on the fat; I added some sliced mushrooms, 1 sliced zucchini, about 1/2 cup sliced fresh basil, minced garlic and various spices to the meat mixture (parsley, oregano, pepper, a few hot pepper flakes).  I also used a mixture of grated gruyere, parmesan and friulan cheeses instead of the mozzarella (what we had in the fridge).  Tasty, with a little bite.  Even though I made changes, I was certainly inspired by your recipe.  Thanks!

Very easy and tastes great.  Used half sweet sausage and have hot sausage, fire roasted tomatoes a little red pepper flakes and cyan pepper, gave it just the right amount of heat. Also as others have mentioned did not add the oil, sausage doesn't need it. Also cooked the onion and garlic in sausage dripping and deglazed with red wine ( that's all I had) not sure why original recipie calls for uncooked onion, has to be an error. So few changes and little seasoning makes this an easy 5 stars

This was a great starter but needed a little help in the seasonings.  My family loves heat so we used spicy italian sausage, added some kosher salt, italian seasoning and let the sauce simmer for awhile.  This helps add a huge amount of flavor to the sauce.   My family loved it and the recipe made for than enough for my sister and her kids to join us.

The recipe was easy to put together and in a short time.  I did add seasonings to the sauce to spice it up a bit.  It was delicious and very filling!! I'm going to try to freeze some of it - I'll let you know how that turns out.

Made this tonight and both kids (15 and 12) went back for thirds!!  I added some dried basil and Italian seasoning to the meat/onion when cooking.  I had some Turkey Sweet Italian sausage I used and the canned diced tomatoes I chose were Fire Roasted with Garlic.  Delicious! Will be making again for sure!!
--update--this has now become a staple in my house.  I generally add more garlic and fresh basil.  Always gets rave reviews and have enjoyed this for years!

My family isn't big on the pasta dishes, but they all liked this recipe! I didn't have an onion so I used fresh minced garlic instead and I think it gave it better flavor. I also used a lot of pepper in the tomatoe sauce. I served it with spinach penne & my kids couldn't tell the pasta was green, so they ate it and loved it.  Best is that it is easy and quick to make.

I'm sorry to say that I did not care for this recipe.  It was too tomatoey for our taste.  Maybe next time I'll leave out one of the tomato products, either the tomato sauce or more likely the paste.

I made this for my husband and son the night before, so my husband had something to make for dinner taht he could handle. I used hot breakfast sausage and there was nothing but rave review.

I made this last night and LOVED IT. I had to adjust the receipe a little bit due to not having all the ingredients. I did not use the wine and instead of tomato paste - I used a half of jar of olive oil and garlic barilla pasta sauce. I used a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and herbs and I used two full cups of shredded mozz cheese. This is mainly because I love cheese.

It came out great!! Thanks for sharing!!!!!

Tasty recipe!  This is similar to another penne & sausage pasta dish I've made.  I cooked the sausage first.  Then set aside in a bowl and sauteed the onions with 2 cloves of diced garlic until the onions were golden.  Then I added the wine and other ingredients.  Then added the sausage back in.  However, I found it a little bland and also added some pepper, salt and some Italian Seasoning to the sauce mix.  Also, I sprinkled grated Parmesan on top of the mozzarella.  Yummy...kids ate two servings each.

Great start. I left out pasta, sauce and paste.  Added garlic, oregano, onion powder and parmesean cheese and topped it with mozzerella. Served with corn bread and have leftovers for great sandwiches. Thanks!!

I used spaghetti sauce and one can of crushed tomatoes. I also tossed the penne in ricotta and layered it like lasagna. Fantastic

Okay so this is a good base but definitely needs A LOT more in the spice department. I can't even really tell you how much I used of my spices because I just kept adding and adding to get it to have some sort of flavor.  I also used 1.5 pounds of Sausage, omitted the diced tomatoes, and used a jar of my family's favorite four cheese pasta sauce.  So I guess I changed quite a bit but overall this is a great base.  Also, definitely make sure you rinse the pasta in cold water so it stops cooking!

I used what I had in the house and changed a few things. I used 1/2 lb ground beef & 1/2 lb italian hot sausage. I also added some shredded carrots and sauteed them w/ the onions. After everything was combined, I added chopped fresh spinach about 1/2 cup . It came out really good & my hubby ( who is not a huge veggie fan) had two servings!

Very, very good! I followed this exactly with the exception of only using 1/4 C. of white cooking wine instead of the 1/2 C. Sometimes the taste of it can be overpowering, and I didn't want to risk it. It tasted fab! Thanks, this is a keeper!

5 stars with my changes: Used 2 cans of sauce because I used a little more pasta than recipe called for.  I added in some fresh garlic and italian seasoning.  I also used fresh mozzarella and hot sausage instead of mild.  I threw in some fresh grated parmesan as well.  Delicious!

the white wine makes ALL the difference.  SOOO good.  My family raved about this one!  :) I made mine with Whole wheat pasta, and I did add my own italian seasonings, and a bit of extra sauce, because I have 5 kids to feed.  I also used more onion that what was called for and added a bit of Zucchini.   Thanks for being my saving grace on another night I didnt know what to make for dinner!  :)

I used brown rice pasta (16oz) which worked great, only boiled them for about 6min. I used coconut oil to saute the onions and I also added a couple cloves minced garlic to that; my sausage was actually Chicken Addouille from Costco) which worked great, I just cut up 4 sausage links.  I used white cooking wine. Added some "21 seasoning salute" and oregano and basil to the sauce for some extra flavor. We also didn't have mozzarella so I used some raw aged cheddar and some colby/jack. Turned out YUMMY! Definitely will make again!

This was ok, but to me it just didn't have enough flavor. I even followed some of the suggestions from other users to add more seasonings and it still wasn't enough for me.

This was GREAT. I made as described except I cooked for five minutes more. Next time I will definitely substitute the spagehetti sauce instead. Easier and probably even more tasty. I threw in extra garlic and various spices as well. Very good.

This was good, although not a favorite for me. My husband and children liked it very much. I made a few changes to the sauce: I made the sauce in a separate pan: sauteed two cloves of crushed garlic in olive oil before adding the canned sauce, paste, and tomatoes. Then added 1 tsp. salt, 1 T. sugar, and some italian seasoning. Deglazed the sausage pan with wine, then dumped it all into the saucepot to combine. Poured over pasta in casserole dish and followed the directions for cheese and baking. I still feel it could have used something else - not sure what; maybe some parmesean?

Great base recipe. I also added fresh garlic, mushrooms, red & yellow pepper to the mix. And deglazed the pan with red wine, instead of white, I had to flavor the sauce better, with more oregano, basil, garlic powder, parsley & sugar and i cooked the sauce longer. It turned out Great!

I would actually give this recipe a 4.5. After reading other reviews, I added garlic to the sausage/onions, and added parsley and a little italian seasoning. I also increased the amount of tomato sauce by 6oz. It turned out great! I made dinner for my family and in-laws and everyone liked it. Will make again for sure!

I don't think this would have had enough flavor for me if I hadn't added fresh oregano, fresh basil, garlic, shallot and red pepper flakes.  However, this was a very quick meal and I will make it again with these adjustments.

This recipe was easy, and my family ate it, but I was a bit disappointed with the lack of flavor in the sauce.  I think jarred spaghetti sauce would have tasted better.  However, I used sausage links that I sliced and browned.  The recipe doesn't specify, but I'm assuming it wants you to use bulk sausage, which may help flavor the sauce better than larger chunks.  I didn't feel the oil was necessary for browning the meat.

Easy to prepare, filling, but unremarkable. I won't make this again. Much prefer spaghetti, or lasagne. This seemed like too much penne, too little sauce and hardly any flavour.

Great family pleaser.  I've made this three times now pretty much sticking to the original recipe.  Every time, I've chopped one or two cloves of garlic and added it towards the end of the sausage/onion browning and also stirred in some chopped fresh basil to the sauce. 
It's not an elegant dish but it is simple to make and everyone likes it.

I left out the white wine, because we don't keep that on hand.  Also, instead of the tomato products, I used a garden vegetable pasta sauce (because that's what I had).  In the end, though, it was great!

This was good to make, although I didn't quite follow the recipe to make the sauce up the way it was suggested.  I made my own pasta sauce the usual way and just used this recipe as a base and it turned out awesome.

This was very good and very simple. I didnt use the cheese because my hubby cant eat cheese, but the kids ate it, and I ate it for dinner, I think 3 days straight. I usually omit wine just because I never have it on hand, but this time had some. I could have probably done just fine without it, but the wine did give the food a nice little flavor.

I have everybody asking for a second plate!, I did not have all the tomate paste etc, so I only use a  regular spaguetty sauce ( garlic,onions ) I think what really gives the touch is not so much the sauce but the italian sausage.I love it, it was so easy to put together, just add a nice Greck salad and some garlic bread and you have a fancy looking meal!

As written it's just a 3 star in my opinion.  It lacks flavor.  It needs seasoning, herbs, etc..  If I were to make it again I'd use crushed or minced garlic, fry it with the onions and sausage in a little olive oil.  Add the tomatoes, basil, oregano, salt, pepper and depending on the taste adjust it with more garlic powder.  With the addition of the "seasonings" it was good.

I used some homeade marinara sauce that I had leftover (instead of the tomato paste/sauce) and it turned out great.  I think the wine is what really boosts this recipe.

Needed a quick meal last night with ingrediants I had on hand.  Found this and decided to try it.  I had to use hamburger because I didn't have sausage but preferred it anyhow.  Used about 6 cloves of fresh garlic when browning the meat and onion, used fresh Basil and also some dried oregano and Thyme.  Used a bit more than two cups of cheese on top and when done, decided that instead of just the cheese on top, I would enjoy it more through-out so I added more to each serving and microwaved it until melted.  It was very good, rich and filling but even my picky 9 yr old son who doesn't eat homemade spaghetti sauce ate a plate of it!  Good to take to a potluck because it's pretty easy and looks nice.

Pretty good. Kids really liked it, my husband thought it was just okay he thinks it needs more sausage. I liked it, I thought it had a good flavor and was easy to make. I will make it again but will add more sausage for hubby.

My family loved it! I took some of the suggestions from other reviewers and substituted the plain tomato sauce with my favorite five cheese pasta sauce and traded out the mozzarella with an Italian cheese blend.  I also added some pepper and Italian seasoning to the simmering mixture. It was definitely a winner at my house.

I really liked this as a base recipe.  Reading other people's reviews was very helpful and I also used some ideas from baked ziti recipes on this site.  I added seasonings (garlic powder, basil, oregano, chili flakes and parsley) to give the sauce more flavor.  I also substituted the standard Italian sausage with HOT Turkey Italian Sausage and I used red wine instead of white.

I also used a cassarole dish to bake it in.  I put 1/2 the pasta mixture in the dish then spread a layer of a combo of cheeses (motz & para) w/ fat free sour cream over the pasta then covered with the rest of the pasta mixture and sprinkled with cheese (got this idea from a ziti recipe on this site).  I cut out a lot of cheese in this recipe.  I didn't want to overpower the sauce.  ...and I wanted to cut back on the fat too.

So in the end I modified this recipe a lot, but like I said, it's a GREAT base recipe.  I will make this again.

My husband and I liked this a lot- but I made some changes. I only used half a jar (maybe 1 cup) of pasta sauce and a couple tablespoons of tomato paste. Anything more than that and it would have been too much! I added a lot of onion and fresh garlic when cooking the sausage. I served this with garlic butter and toasted rye bread. It made a very nice meal that I'll definitely make again!

Loved this sauce!  I needed to use up some fresh pasta and found this recipe in my search for a quick and easy dish I could put together in less than an hour.  I used bulk mild Italian sausage and deglazed the pan with Lambrusco...really good!  I only used half of the sauce on pasta and made french bread pizza with the rest the next day..yum!

Yum!!!  Made this for dinner tonight & everyone really enjoyed it.  I accidentally forgot to simmer it for 10 mins. before mixing it with the pasta and baking it but it still turned out good.  I added 2 garlic cloves to the sausage & also added 1/4 Parmasean to the top.  Most definately a new family favorite.

Quick, easy and very good, especially in the fall weather, serious comfort food.  To spice it up more you may want to use medium to hot Italian sausage and I also added additional garlic.

Similar, but due to the lack of layers not as good as some of the Baked Ziti recipes on this site.  I even added provolone and ricotta cheeses.

Anything that gets my picky eater to ask for seconds gets my vote. I couldn't get tomatoes with garlic so added 3 cloves of garlic to the onions and sausage otherwise followed recipe exactly. Going in the family favourites for definite. Thanks.

I made this the other night for my boyfriend and he really liked it. We had it with garlic bread. This is a really good basic recipe that allows space to add your own personal touches! I left the sausages whole after debating how to cook them, I was out of white wine (and could buy any due to my age) so I deglazed with chicken broth and didn't make a difference.

I made this recipe for the first time for 3 of my college-aged friends.  They fell absolutely in love with this recipe - it's one of their new favorites!  However, if you're a meat-loving crowd, I might consider upping the amount of sausage from 1 lb. to 1.5 or even 2 lbs.  I also put in 3 cups of cheese instead of 2 for extra cheesy goodness!

This dish was the best!  I credit Edward's Meat Market for the greatest Itlian sausage ever made!  I added a bit of basil, chopped garlic and a pinch of sugar ( to kill tomatoe bitterness) to this wonderful dish--everyone like it!  Will fix again, and again, and again.

Because some previous reviewers thought this was bland, I used one link of hot italian sausage and two links of mild, plus a dash of hot pepper flakes, some canned mushrooms and chopped garlic.  While making the sauce I was worried there was way too much for 12oz of pasta, but it worked out great.  We added grated parm at the table.

I would say this is gets a 3.75 in my book.  It was good.  I made some changes.  I added ricotta cheese with egg mixed in.  I also used chick broth instead of wine.  Good recipe.

I also layered in ricotta cheese (seasoned with salt, pepper and one beaten egg). Came out excellent.

This was better than a similar dish I made a few days ago but still needs a little more kick. I used fresh minced garlic and some fresh basil as well as red wine instead of white. Next time I might use hot Italian sausage instead of mild.

This was EXCELLENT.  Next time I will add some fresh mushrooms.  My roommate who never eats leftovers ate this for lunch and dinner the next day.  One of our favorites - and so simple!

Quite a tasty meal. Did change a few things though - used 1/2 lb. hot italian sausage and 1/2 lb. lean ground beef, added a bit extra garlic, a touch of brown sugar, and used chicken broth in place of the wine as I didn't have wine.  As well, I did not bake.  Husband and I enjoyed it.  Will make again.

I was not impressed with this meal.  If your looking for a little twist on a simple meal, this is not the reicpe to try.  Stick to your own recipe. I found it bland and a little salty.

Made this tonight - left out the onion and added some fresh sliced mushrooms.  
It was excellent!  Next time I think I will add a green pepper - will go nice with the sausage.
Thanks for submitting this recipe!

Very good.  The only change I made was adding the garlic separately and since I didn't have any wine on hand, I used vegetable broth. Hamburger instead of sausauge works too.  This recipe was so easy and came out great...I will never buy the jar stuff again.

Nice.  A funky kind of mild with the wine (maybe it was just the new pasta sauce I used).  Makes a nice leftover from frozen.

My twelve year-old prepared this.  We were somewhat disappointed with the too tomato-y taste.  I suggested she try adding a little sugar next time.  We only had chardonnay in the house which proved to be a bit overbearing. Again, I suggested deglazing with broth or red wine next time. She also snipped and added fresh oregano, Italian parsley, thyme, (basil's not ready yet) a couple cloves of garlic, salt and freshly ground black pepper.  She said she may even try a little crushed red pepper in the future.  We both feel the additions salvaged the dish.  Though she was somewhat disappointed, she feels the overall ease of preparation is worth trying again with the modifications.

This was very good, and my family enjoyed it, but I think it needed to be kicked up a bit.  Will use a mixture of sweet and hot italian sausage next time.  This was very cheesy.

This meal is good as a basic, but with my 4 touches it makes it really good! 1) I use half lb. of italian sausage, and a half lb. of ground chuck. 2) I use red wine instead of white (Pinot Noir). I also reduce it down a lot further so the wine is more concentrated and not like adding grape juice to my sauce.  3) I use a can of diced tomatoes, with garlic, oregano, and basil( Red Gold). 5) I use a an Italian cheese blend, and i put half in the middle, and do the same with some grated parmesan(middle and top). I make this all the time now that way, and i even made one for a party one day and it was devoured. The best part is that it is quick and easy, and can make it after coming home from work.

Added garlic when cooking the sausage and onions, and added basil when adding tomatoes.  It's an easy to prepare, tasty casserole.

I followed the recipe this time. I think it had good flavor but it was VERY acidic. Next time I will try a suggestion I read and try adding a little cream cheese or ricotta and cut back on some of the tomato. I think that might help level it out.

I made a few changes.  I added green peppers to the sausage and onions, but adding them to the pan midway through, so they didn't get mushy.  I also shortened the time the pasta cooked/boiled by 2 minutes, as they would cook more once in the oven.  I have made this several times and it comes out perfect everytime.

I cut the recipe in half and still eat it for 2 days with a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 young kids). I also used vegan cheese because my kids are allergic to milk and it turned out as good as original recipe.

Wonderful recipe - quick prep, easy to put together.  I did spicy Italian sausage as we live a bit of kick to our foods.  Agreed with other reviewers that al denote is a bit too soft for the pasta; next time the penne will boil only 5 minutes.  And there will be a next time!

This is a good, easy dish.  As there wasn't a drop of wine to be found in my house, I de-glazed the pan with chicken stock instead.  Next time, I'll add  Parmesan cheese to the mozzarella for a little more flavor.

It was very good.  Before I put it in the over to melt the cheese I added three teaspoons of capers (drained).

I added chicken and broccoli, substituted the mozzarella for italian blend cheese and seasoned it a bit to give it more taste.... the kids loved it.
This is something that can feed a big family like mine without breaking the bank.

This recipe is really quite terrible. It's way too acidic and has little to offer other than tomato. If you look at most of the top reviews, they all changed the recipe. This recipe is a base at best and even then, it's a poor base. I can't believe it has the stars it does. It needs garlic, sugar, basil and a few other adjustments to be good. The base recipe is just not good.

Overall flavor and texture is good. I did sautee the onion and garlic with the sausage and added 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper for a little heat. I replaced the sauce with 25 ounce pasta sauce because we prefer less tomato sauce in our dish.

I made this last night and it was good. I modified the recipe some. I added 3 gloves of garlic in with the onions since I love garlic. I also added 1 teaspoon of dried basil, 1 teaspoon of oregano 1 teaspoon of Italian season. and 1 teaspoon of fresh ground pepper. I also added lots of parmesan cheese with the mozzarella cheese. It was really good I'll differently make this again.

This is my go to recipe when I need a delicious meal that’s quick and easy.  I always get compliments and have no left overs!  Definitely recommend.  I sometimes substitute chicken broth if I don’t have white wine and it’s delish!

This was a hit with everybody. The only changes we made was  we replaced the white wine with water and instead of the italian sausage we just added spices to hamburger. It tasted great!

I'm a beginner and just learning how to cook and this was straightforward and delicious. The wine really gave this a kick. However I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and browned the onions first before adding sausage, then the sauce and wine. The onions really make the sausage pop so make sure you work those in nice before starting the simmer.

Added some simple spices and mushrooms and carrots (yes...carrots). Added 2 big carrots, peeled and sliced to 1/8" thick, 10 ounce can sliced mushrooms (squished to remove liquid), 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, heaping tsp Italian seasoning, used ground sausage instead of links, Hunts Thick and Rich Spicy Red Pepper & Chiles sauce instead of plain tomato sauce, 2 tsp minced garlic in oil (no such thing as too much garlic). Carrots are a different taste than one would expect in an Italian pasta dish...but when your child wants more veggies...you add them. I don't know if I would call this restaurant quality but I wouldn't be disappointed to be served this in a restaurant and will make this again.

This was wonderful, thanks for sharing! 
I didn’t have any wine on hand, so I used chicken broth instead... other than that, followed exact instructions. My son loved this and called it delicious. Will be making this again :)

Great recipe. I cut  chicken breast in to bite sizes and added basil and oregano.  I also used around 800ml of tomato sauce and skipped the diced tomatoes. Loved the white wine in the sauce! Flavour was awesome! Will definitely make again, but I'm going to add fried mushrooms next time

I gave this dish a 4/5 because I had to substitute many ingredients. I used quality jar pasta sauce adding more Italian seasoning.  I also used provolone and parmesan instead of mozzarella. I added onion and red bell peppers.  Overall this was a great weeknight meal.

Very easy and took but 45 minutes. I added some garlic.  My son will surely be able to cook this one.   I normally like red wine with pasta.  This recipe was the exception as it was fun to sip the white as the dish was cooking

Not bad at all for a pretty simple recipe.  Tweaks I made were adding some Italian seasoning and I didn't have any white wine, so I used red.

Absolutely delicious. I used fresh mozzarella and added some basil and oregano. Everyone who tasted it wanted seconds and even thirds. I am gluten-free, and it's difficult to make gf pasta that tastes as good as regular, but by cooking it until it's just barely al dente, and then baking it with the sausage, tomatoes and cheese: perfecto!

Easy to make and so delicious.  I substituted Penne with Rotinni out of necessity.  I didn't have enough Penne on hand.  Everything else I followed to the "T".  So worth it!!!

I had one serving after the next! I've been craving something like this the past week. I did add a couple bell peppers, spinach, & mushrooms. I like to stick to low carb and used 3/4 of the pasta. I also added some garlic powder to my vegetables being there are a lot of water content from the vegetables and didn't want the pasta to turn out bland. I sautéed the vegetables separately from the meat, which I think in the future I can cook them together and strain them all at once. The amount of cheese is perfect! I topped my pasta with some fresh chopped basil and threw them in the oven. I'll definitely make this again.

This is super easy to make and delicious!  I did add 2 tsp of minced garlic, 2 tsp of italian seasoning, and a 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes to the sauce, but other than that I stuck to the recipe.  My husband loved it, and ALL THREE KIDS ATE IT!  It was a miracle!! :)

It needed more seasoning. I added basil, garlic, and oregeno. The wine added a nice depth and shouldn't be skipped.

Excellent recipe. Very easy and kid friendly. I added a dash more garlic, but otherwise kept it as written. You could also add diced veggies to this.

First time was a hit! I did not use white wine as the recipe called for, but instead used some oil to sautee the onion and a few cloves of garlic first. Added the sausage to brown into this and then followed the recipe from there, adding 1/2 tsp of dried basil and 1/4 tsp of dried oregano to the sauce before mixing and baking. Delicious and will definitely make again!

I definitely will make it again.  I just added a little oregano to the sauce and, after baking it, I sprinkled a little chopped fresh basil on top (like in the picture).  Don't change anything else!!!  Make sure you add the diced tomatoes w/garlic, as the recipe calls!! Enjoy!!!

Great recipe!  Easy & FAST!  I followed the recipe with only 2 additions:  seasoning,  added fennel seed,Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes, and second a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, to cut the acid.  Delicious .

I didn't realize that I was out of white onion and tomato sauce so subbed red onion and spaghetti sauce and it was still delicious. I also used fire roasted diced tomatoes just because I think they have more flavor. Agree with advice to only boil penne for 5 minutes. Served it over a bed of baby spinach (the heat from the pasta was enough to wilt the leaves). Will definitely make again.

I altered the recipe a tiny bit by using spaghetti noddles ( and accidentally leaving out a few things), but it still totally works. I would defiantly recommend this recipe!

Overall this was a excellent meal to make for a group, and wasn't too challenging. However, I felt it lacked flavor. The addition of salt, oregano, basil, and rosemary brought this dish to a level that I found more enjoyable.

I made this last night. Turned out great but I too modified it to fit what I had on hand. I cooked mild Italian sausage, drained and set aside. Boiled pasta for 4 minutes, still kind of cheery. Cooked onion and garlic until just translucent and added 1 1/4 jars Prego garden sauce.  Mixed noodles with sausage and sauce then added half to a 13x9 baking dish, layered 6 slices of Provolone then the rest of the pasta mixture. Topped with 2 cups of mozzarella and covered.  Baked on 325 for 45 minutes and let stand. Yummy!

Big disappointment! Dry, boring, too much tomato paste. I am hoping that warmed up left overs will be better with the addition of some olive oil and fennel and more cheese.  I think the mozzarella should have leached some oil/fat down into the penne, but it stayed on top and everything under it dried out.  Will not make this again.

This was quick, easy, filling & delicious! I used turkey sweet Italian sausage in the casings and just squeezed it out. I also used wheat penne pasta. I seasoned the sauce with fresh ground basil & Italian seasoning blend, garlic powder (because I didn't have fresh garlic. If I did I would've added minced fresh garlic with the onion to the oil) salt, pepper and a little sugar to taste. I also at the last minute decided to dollop a few spoonfuls of ricotta on top of the pasta in the pan, before adding the mozzarella. My husband, who's a picky eater, loved it! He didn't even know it was made with turkey sausage & wheat pasta! ;)

Added garlic, 1/2 pound ground beef, used 1 pound of hot Italian sausage ... 2 x the amount of tomato sauce, fresh thyme, oregano, basil ... added 1/2 cup water and put the pasta in raw (without cooking it) used rigatoni ... used mozzarella, fontina and parmesan cheese for the topping.  I will make this again for sure!

This is a good, basic recipe for someone who is just learning to cook.  Beware that the tomatoes with garlic & onion don't add much in terms of flavor. I fortified this tripe with just a dash of the usual italian herbs and spices. 
Overall, it was quick, it was easy, and the family liked it.

FYI, I didn't make this exactly as directed, as I had no wine on hand and also had to keep my family's finicky eating preferences in mind.  That said, I used this recipe as the bones of my own recipe, and was not disappointed!!!

I thought this was amazing, as did my family! I did make alterations though, sorry I am that kind of cook. ;)  My changes: I added 3/4 a brick of cream cheese to the sauce, omitted the wine but substituted the water from the cooked pasta, and topped it with pepperoni before I put the cheese on top. It was SO GOOD.

I make this recipe a lot and love it. The only changes I have made is not using the white wine and adding some basil, oregano, sugar and garlic to the tomato sauce to give it more flavor.  
This makes a lot for just two people so I usually split this into 2 - 8x8" pans and freeze one for an easy dinner later.  For the pan you freeze just don't add the mozzerella on top until the pasta cools down so it doesn't melt before you cook it or wait until you take it out of the freezer and are ready to put in the oven to add the cheese.

After reading the reviews, I sauted the onion and used turkey Italian sausage. I also added a few cloves of garlic,then deglazed with a little red wine. I also substituted a jar of marinara sauce for the tomato sauce and added little dried basil & oregano to give more flavor.Yummy and definitely a "keeper" recipie for my hubbie & I!

I've made a baked pasta a million times mostly from memory or what I had on hand.  Never really made it with sausage before, but gotta say....this was delicious!  I looked for recipes with Italian sausage for dinner last night and this was the only one that came up that sounded any good to me (I'm not a big fan of sausage because I always wonder what's in it!).  Anyway, I made this with a few tiny tweaks with the tomatoes I had in my pantry, but basically made it according to recipe.  Of course, I used EVOO and more garlic and had no white wine but added a splash of beef broth to deglaze the pan.  It was really yummy and made a lot of leftovers for me and my husband (we LOVE leftovers for lunch or when I don't feel like cooking anything else).  Put this in my recipe box for future use!  It's really good!!!!

Very good!  I omitted the wine and olive oil, used a  large can of Cento tomato puree instead of the other tomatoes, used hot sausage and added 1 tsp. of sugar, 1 tsp. of basil and 1/2 tsp. of oregano.  I would make this again.

Made this with Italian pork sausage. Sautéed the onions first then added the sausage. I followed the directions as recommended & it was good, but the sausage was too spicy on my stomach. My kids didn't like the tomatoes, but my husband loved it!!

Good basic recipe but it does need at least a good handful of Italian herbs and sugar to counter balance the acidity of the tomatoes. Other than that: it's fast, easy, and good. And no, you won't impress anyone much with Italian food.

Very Tasty!! My family ate it up - even my picky husband who isn't usually a fan of new recipes commented on how good it was.  I added fresh garlic, oregano and garlic powder to the mixture and allowed it to simmer for about 25 mins. prior to adding penne to the sauce.

I needed to add oregano, basil, a bit of red pepper flakes and powdered bay leaf. Otherwise it's pretty good. Sort of like my mother-in-law's baked ziti.

A really delicious and easy to prepare dish.  The sauce is incredible.  It freezes well, also.

We liked this dish, but I have to wonder if substituting a jar of spaghetti sauce for the diced tomatoes and tomato paste but otherwise following the recipe would yield pretty much the same result.  This would be a good dish for a pot luck.

Great recipe made it for my girlfriend and she loved it! Only thing I changed was I added some crimini mushrooms and olives, which took it over the top!

This wa another great dish and way better than the worlds most famous lasagna. I used red wine instead of white because I had an open bottle from last night. I also added two cloves of garlic and mushrooms because I had them and we love sausage and mushroom pizza.

Cooked per the recipe and it was a little too tomatoey for me. Overpowered the sausage. Will not use tomato paste and use a jar of garden style spaghetti sauce instead of the 15 oz. can of tomato sauce if I make it again.

Made this for dinner tonight. I did not add the wine, not into alcohol flavoring. But still tasted amazing! Hubby had seconds! Highly recommend. Easy to make and had lots left over for our lunches tomorrow and maybe another meal this week.

3 words.....FAB U LOUS!
I am always looking for great meals that can be precooked and warmed up before rushing out the door to hockey or baseball with my young boys! This was amazing. I used 4-5 hot Italian sausages from Costco and only cooked the pasta for 5 minutes. I baked the sausage in the oven, sliced it them stuck it in pan to brown a bit more with onions and some cloves of minced garlic! This could be served at a restaurant! Delicious

We really liked this, even my picky 12 year old loved it. Can't wait to have another night. I used freshly made Sweet Italian Sausage from a local market. What a wonderful taste!  Will make this again for the rest of the family!  Thank you for posting it!

My husband and I loved this recipe as written. It appealed to me because it did not call for jar sauce. I used a high quality local Italian sausage and the spices in the sausage flavored the sauce. It was delicious!!!!

This recipe never fails to please crowds at get-togethers.    I use sauce as a base for all my red sauce pasta dishes.  Sometimes using ground beef, sometimes spicy sausage...whatever I have on hand.

I just made this tonight and it blew my socks off! The only change I made was that I used spicy Italian sausage and it was out of this world! An easy dinner idea that I think everybody and the whole family will enjoy!

It was ok.  I used red wine instead of white because that's what I had.  I also added some basil and oregano.  I'll make it again but it's not very exciting.

This was very good - exactly as written.  I was afraid it wouldn't have much taste but boy was I wrong.  The sausage really added a lot of flavor.  It was VERY easy to make too, a definite plus!

We LOVED it!  I made it with the tomato products listed, added the white wine and used sweet italian sausage. I had one serving but the other three family members had two! Everyone just loved it and agreed - this tastes like it came from a restaurant. Can't wait to make a double batch for my extended family.

The sauce needs a little sprucing up, IMO. Bit bland. I'd be tempted to add some Italian spices next time.

Excellent dish and very satisfying. I made far too much of course but they all loved it. Cut the skins off my sausage and rolled them into meat balls. The melted mozzarella was just perfect on top. Lovely!!!!

This was a great meal.  I would argue it takes a bit longer than 15 minutes to put together...say more like 25 or so for a single dad with little help from the kids.  BUT, the kids loved it.  SO, it went into the hand written recipe book.  Very good meal with left overs.  YES!

I made this but with some minor changes. I added some Italian herbs and omitted the tomato paste. I was making a half size version for just two people and using a whole can of dices tomatoes just worked better for me. My wife liked it which is saying a lot.

made this last night (exactly per recipe).  Hubby's only comments were, 'needs more meat, less pasta.'  I thought it needed a little more kick, too.  OK, I'll probably try this again and will use 2 lbs. mild/sweet Italian sausage (or 1 lb. Italian sausage & 3/4 lb. ground beef); add 1 tsp. minced garlic; 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes; 1/2 tsp. dried oregano.  And only 8-10 oz. pasta.  I like the flavor of the Italian sausage, instead of plain ground beef, and I like the mozzarella cheese all on top instead of mozz/cheddar all thoughout.  Thanks for the recipe.  Think this will make a nice occassional Italian dish in my rotation.

This was awsome and put into my rec book at home. It will become a regular on the  menu.
I used hot Ital sausage and added 2 cloves of minced garlic.
Nxt time I will use twice the cheese and this dish deserves the best. I used store brand :-(   as it was my first try, won't do that again, but still it was great. I also used t. paste with Italian seasoning in it.

I made this recipe tonight and was totally disappointed.  I had to doctor it up in order to make it pallitable.  Those who used a jar of pasta sauce made a good decision.  I won't make it again!

Made this recipe tonight. I thought it was quick and easy. It was also very delicious! I didn't have wine but it still was great. Next time I would add some mushrooms to make it even better! Delish!

Recipe is excellent.  I didn't have wine in the house nor tomato paste so I increased the recipe to 16 oz of tomato sauce and 28 oz of diced tomatoes.  Turned out great, will definitely make again.

Pretty good!  Followed the recipe as is but added more garlic powder and seasonings (oregano, basil).  Will definitely make again for a quick weeknight meal.

Super easy and yummy!   I used sweet italian sausage because the kids don't like spicy, and it was wonderful!  Definitely will make again.

My family loved this - I had a yellow squash that I needed to cook, so I cut it up and added it to the sauce.  Yummy!

This was a nice quick dinner. I did add dried basil, oregano, thyme and red pepper flakes to the sauce.  It was a really rich red colored sauce, thick without being gooey, and stayed on the pasta.  I broiled mine for 5 mins to melt cheese and get it to brown slightly.  Overall this is a great dish and I will make it again!

I made this recipe with gluten-free pasta since I am allergic to wheat.  My family usually doesn't like my gluten-free dishes, but this recipe worked well with gluten free noodles.  Like another user suggested, I also used the hot italian sausage squeezed out of the casings, and my husband liked the extra kick of flavor.  My kids also really enjoyed it.  I am sure I will make it again.

Great recipe with a few changes.  
First- I used diced plum tomatos instead of the canned ones.
Second- I used spaghetti sauce instead of the 15 oz tomato sauce
Third- I used red instead of white wine
Fourth- I added fresh thyme and basil to the "sauce"

Overall a great base to work from :-)

I made a healthier version of this great pasta dish! 
Used whole grain wheat penne. Use 1 can of spaghetti sauce with mushrooms instead of the tomato sauce, diced tomatos, and paste.  After cooking the onion in garlic and oil, added mushrooms and a tablespoon of red pepper flakes for a little kick! Then added white wine, a teaspoon of basil, oregano and the pasta sauce along with 1/2 cup of frozen spinach and 2 tablespoon of grated paremesan.  Used only 1.5 cup of low skim mozzarella and baked for 15 minutes. My husband enjoyed it!

I sauteed a mess of fresh minced garlic with the onion and I added a teaspoon and a half each of dried basil, dried oregano and brown sugar. We really liked this! Very simple and very filling, not to mention budget friendly.

My husband really enjoyed this. Instead of shredded mozzarella cheese, I used cubed cheddar and pepper jack, his favorites. I mixed the cubed cheese with the pasta and sauce  and also put some cubes on top so it would be cheesy throughout.

Absolutely loved the taste the wine gave the sauce... I used the Johnsonsville hot Italian sausage without the casings and it was great!! I decided to add spinach, which gave it a great color... I've made this time and time again. my bf loves it!! It's better than your ordinary spaghetti sauce, wayyy better

Great dish.  I added a little bit of Italian Seasoning (about 1/2 teaspoon), basil (about 1/4 teaspoon), and sugar (about 1 tablespoon) and it gave it a little kick.

This was good.  I used turkey Italian sausage, but made no other changes.  There is a slightly different flavor using these ingredients rather than a jarred sauce and it would good to have a change.

Easy weeknight meal! Very filling and delicious. I used petite diced italian tomatoes. I also added a few hearty shakes of italian seasoning to the sauce and sauteed the meat with the onion and garlic.

As is, this recipe is good for a quick-fix meal... it is easily adaptable to suit your own personal taste... I added 3 cloves chopped garlic, basil and oregano, green pepper then let it simmer for a bit, then just before adding the pasta, I tossed is 2 cups roughly chopped fresh baby spinich... kids loved it.  Thanks for a good jumping off point!

Very good pasta dish!  I added some seasonings (minced garlic, basil and oregano) and substituted the white wine with 2 TBSP apple cider vinegar/water mixture.  I'd make this again.  You might even be able to sneak in some spinach or other vegetable in it.

Maybe I just don't like penne pasta...  I used the same italian sausage I always use and this just tasted wrong for some reason. My daughter said it was okay but didn't ask for seconds.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I always use spicy Italian sausage and like to add a teaspoon of crushed red peppers.  Then I substituted an onion for a chopped green bell pepper.  And finalizing the dish with a sprinkle of dried parsley leaves.

I loved this recipe and the fact that it was easy to make.  I did not have a can of diced tomatoes so, I chopped up fresh tomatoes and added a garlic clove.  I overlooked that it also called for tomato sauce, but the tomatoes and paste still made a great dish.

This was pretty easy to make and quite yummy. It's very cheesy, so if you're not a fan of cheese, maybe reduce it to 1 cup. Instead of the tomato paste and canned sauce, I used a mushroom pasta sauce and added dried basil, oregano, thyme and garlic powder. I did not have white wine on hand, so I omitted it.

Yummy Yummy!! And, my kids liked it which is always a plus. I did add a dash of red pepper flakes some basil just to kick it up a bit. Will absolutely add this to my regular recipe file.

Very good and very easy.  The family loved it.  And it would be so easy to improvise if you are missing an ingredient.

Love this recipe...I did use a smaller can of tomato sauce and 1/2 the amount of the tomato paste.  Also, I substituted Italian Sausage for  bratwurst.  Usually, I have a difficult time finding things to do with bratwurst but this was awesome!!! My husband loved it!!! Thanks!

I was excited to try this recipe because I actually had everything in the house for it!  Unfortunately, even after adding extra garlic, basil and oregano, and using fresh mozarella and shredded mozarella, it was very bland.  DH though it was "ok".  I won't make it again.  Sorry.

Totally love it!  I think I'll cover it next time I put it in the oven to bake, because the top of the pasta dried out.  I love the fact that you can add in whatever meat you have so it's an excellent way to redo the leftovers.

Love this dish.  I have made it twice.  The first I followed the recipe, but the second time I used a jar of pasta sauce and a can of diced tomatos.  It added more flavor.

This recipe has become a staple... I make it about every other week!  It is delicious.  I modified it by sauteing extra onion with three cloves of garlic THEN adding the tomato and sauces.  I also add fresh chopped basil to the sauce and use flavored tomato sauce (onion and garlic).  It gives it a little kick.  Delicious and I would definitely recommend it!

This recipe is very easy to make and has nice flavor.  I made it exactly by the recipe except I used hot italian sausage.  My family really enjoyed it, even my picky eaters but I felt it could use a little more flavor.  Maybe some garlic and oregano.  Will definately make it again though.

I decided to make this thinking I had everything on hand. Well, I didn't have penne so I had to use ziti. I know, not much dif. I had only plain diced tomatoes, so I added a tsp. of minced garlic. The wine I had was a reisling - Italians please don't cringe too much! What I thought was shreaded mozzerella was actually Italian blend. I know these are minor things, but I think next time I will do it the same way because it came out pretty good.

I thought this was really very good.  I made what I think are a couple of minor changes.  I added fresh basil and garlic to the sauce.  I was out of tomato sauce so I used marinara which worked fine.  I had to add some water because the sauce was thick.  I did it all in one pan that went from stove top to oven.  Boiled the noodles then drained them and added the sausage- cut up into bite size pieces with the onion (no extra oil and it didn't need it)  added then wine and deglazed the pan then added the rest with seasoning.  It was a delicious one pot meal thanks!

This was very good. I looked at some of the reviews and made some slight modifications. I doubled the sausage, onions, tomato paste, and tomatoes. I added 2 tomato paste cans full of water, 2 Tbs of butter, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp of basil, and 2 bay leaves. The sauce was delicous. If I had not increased the ingredients it would have been very dry. I also found that the penne pasta in my store was a 16 oz box. This filled up a 13x9 pan and we had about 12 servings. I also added some pepperoni on the top. The kids loved it.

It was okay.  Definitely nothing special.  I stuck to the recipe and wish I had taken some of the recommendations.  It definitely needs added spices.  I would use the spicy italian sausage instead, or some other more flavored kind.  I did add some garlic, but wish I had added more.  If I made it again, I would use a sauce that has vegetables, and more stuff in it rather than the bland marinara sauce.  It tasted okay, but I probably won't be making this again unless I make some major changes.  Definitely needs salt and pepper added as well.  I'm not sure why that wasn't included but it is a MUST!  Hope the rest of you can do a better job with this one than I did...if you follow the recipe exactly, you're in for quite a letdown.

This is a good basic recipe. I almost thought it was too basic until my husband couldn't stop raving about how much he loved it. Sold! I used hot italian sausage removed from the sausuage casing. I added garlic, onion, mushroom, and fresh basil. Delish!

this was okay.  just kind of blah.  a little too much work/money for what the finished product is.  probably cheaper to just buy a boxed frozen version.

Great tasting especially with lots of mozzarella cheese. Easy to make! Only problem is that it dries out quickly and doesn't take that great reheated. But out fresh when you're done cooking it, it's good. Definitely add lots of seasonings

I added 1 clove of garlic and about a tsp. of crushed red pepper to the sausage and onion mixture. I also added a small can of sliced mushrooms to the sauce. Very delicious. My husband loved it!

This was pretty good.  It tastes just like the lasagna I make, but without the cottage cheese.  It's def easier than lasagna to make though.  We didn't think it was spectacular though.

Tasty. I've made this with italian sausage and ground turkey. Both times it came out wonderful. Per reviews, I added two cloves of garlic and lots of italian seasoning, crushed red pepper, and basil.

I gave it a four because my husband said it did not taste very good, but I thought it tasted just fine and so did my two year old. I used a can of 14.5 oz basil, oregano, and garlic flavored tomatoes, 6 oz can of tomato paste and then I used the 14.5 oz can once it was empty and poured in some 4 cheese spagetti sauce. I also did not use wine and added a little more oregano, and some garlic, I used an Italian Cheese blend on top. It was super easy to make.

Great recipe. I added about a tablespoon of sugar and some italian seasonings for some extra flavor.  Also, I chopped some garlic to add to the sausage and onions.  Definitely a keeper!

This was really good with a little tweaking - added about 4 cloves of garlic, basil, oregano, pepper, sprinkled the top with romano cheese in addition to the mozz and used spicy italian sausage.  I made this as an early V-day dinner for my boyfriend and he loved it, we will definitely use this recipe in the future, thanks!

A fantastic recipe, and a unanimous hit with everyone in the house. I used fresh garlic instead of in the can, and added oregano and basil. Beyond that, I wouldn't change anything.

I used hot Italian sausage as a few people suggested and my husband and I both liked the extra flavor it added. My husband hates tomatoes, so I used prepared sauce (almost 2 jars!) in place of making my own. We both thought it was good and I will be making this again!

Changed almost mothing, except I forgot to cook the onions with the sausage. (I used half mild and half hot.)  And I didn't want to take the time to sautee them in a seperate pan, so I threw in a big handfull of dried onion flakes at the last minute while the sauce was simmering.  I know, nothing like the real thing but I keep them on hand so my kids won't wine, "But we don't like onions."  Also added a shake of italian seasoning.  Also used pepperoni slices after reading other reviews and next time I will use diced so it incorperates better.  Yummy.

Super easy, and has a wonderful home made taste.   I had forgotten to buy the penne, so I substituted farfalle.  My kids loved hunting for the bow ties under the cheese.

I prepared this following the recipe exactly and the sauce in this dish was just too "tomato-ey".  It overwhelmed any other flavor.  Out of my family of 4, no one liked it, which is rare.  I will not make this again!

This is a great recipe that I will make again. I omitted the white wine. Next time I make this, I will probably use less of the pasta. I might layer the pasta/meat mixture with the cheese instead of just having all of the cheese on top. Definitely give this recipe a try!

So, so good...a lot of flavor in such an easy dish.  I added some fresh garlic and basil and used hot Italian sausage. Just delicious.

My family loved this recipe.  The only change we made was to add a bell pepper.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This was delicious.  The only thing I did differently was that I added 1 can of regular diced tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomatoes with jalepeno in it.   I also only used 1 cup ofmozzarella cheese.   Finger-licking good.

Really good recipe. Easy and quick to prepare! I added a little arrabiatta seasoning (spicy) and sprinkled some oregano on top before serving. Very good!

I made this dish and it was terrific. It makes a pretty large amount and the sauce was excellent. My kids even liked it and they are kinda picky. I recommend to try this recipe!

Had good flavor - the white wine & italian sausage set it apart from most tom-based pasta recipes.  Easy to prepare.  I will make again.

This was really nice. I added some chili for a little more bite. My only dislike is that I find Italian Sausages very fatty however my fiance loves them. Thanks for the recipe.

My family loved this!  Used mild Italian sausage instead of spicy, left out the wine, used tomato sauce with mushrooms and added a little extra cheese.  It was fabulous!  The leftovers were just as good as the first night!  I'll make this again.
