This is a delicious way to dress up green beans. The first time you make this I would recommend going easy on the allspice, you can always add more before serving, as I did.

This recipe was great, except there was a little too much allspice. Just half the amount in the original recipe and you will love the results!

All spice is kind of overpowering and yucky for green beans.  This recipe would be better without the allspice.  Great way to prepare green beans though.  Great texture and consitancy.

I scaled the allspice down by half, with the addition of some thyme and brown sugar this recipe gets five stars from me! :)

The flavor didn't really do the job for me.  Maybe it was the allspice.  This is the very first time I have ever taste the allspice, was not thrilled with it.

Following the advice of others, I was cautious with the allspice;   will add more next time as well as more garlic.   Also, I will add a little more water and simmer them a little longer because two of the four trying this dish wanted the beans softer.

Nice quick way to dress up string beans. I would echo the comments of others and scale the allspice back and add to taste at the end.

This was pretty good.  I would go a little light on the allspice though. I used fresh green beans.

They're definitely good.  They could use a little more "umph" but they're definitely tasty!

Very good.  I just left the allspice out altogether though (didn't have any).  Many compliments on this dish.

Not exactly a great pairing of ingredients.  Maybe too much allspice in the recipe.

We didn't particularly like this, to be honest. My bf said, 'all I could smell was cloves', which turned him off. I personally felt that this recipes was not rounded enough and a bit bland. Thank you!

Great way to jazz up one of my favorite veggies. Watch out for overcooking. I had fewer beans than the recipe called for and I think I used too much water. :(

I made this with 1/2 the allspice, and it seemed like about the right amount.  In my family, reactions ranged from "they're delicious" to "I give them 2 stars."  We did like the texture of the beans, and may adopt this cooking method for use with variations on the spices in this recipe.

Too much spicve and too little water. The green beans were very overpowered and basically burnt! I would rather settle for plain, fresh green beans.

My boyfriend really liked these- I thought they were pretty good but nothing too special! Used olive oil in place of veggie oil.
