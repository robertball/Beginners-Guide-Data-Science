We are well aquainted with Chuy's Creamy Jalapeno and everyone in the family makes our own version. This is a nice spin on it with the homemade green sauce. I usually use an entire bunch of cilantro and half sour cream/ half non-fat yogurt. Wonderful dip with crudite veggies or tortilla chips.

Okay, so this is what I did. I followed the recipe exact only using one full batch of Scotdog's dry ranch dressing mix minus the dry buttermilk powder, which I ended up stirring in after all once I tasted it. I think this dip is GREAT. The cilantro with the tomatillos and the ranch and the peppers all work together with the sour cream base into this dip of wonderfulness. New favorite dip. It's really great. I think this would be a great topping for a low-calorie nacho plate or part of a sour cream filling for burritos/enchiladas. I might just use it. Way to rock it, BBQgirl. NOTE: I did not have whole pickled jalapeno peppers, so I used pickled jalapeno rings....gosh....a good handful.

I had all the ingredients execpt the Ranch flavor dip was the the Fiesta Ranch flavor. I followed the directions and the dressing came out fantastic....  Different, not the same old boring dressing.

This recipe is yummy!  I don't think it doesn't taste like Chuy's jalapeno ranch, but it is still really good in it own way.  It is good by itself or add salsa and cheese on top for a dip.

I am giving this 3 stars because it is a wonderful idea.  However, I thought the recipe still needs some work.  I think 2 Ranch dressing mixes was too strong.  I will try this again but with only 1 package and add the 2nd a little at time until it is the way I like.

I had to bring a salad for Christmas dinner, so I made a couple of dressings to go with it.  This one was the biggest hit!  It was so easy too!  It would also be excellent as a dip or on top of a baked potato.

This is yummy, but not quite Chuy's to me. I did some adjusting and came up with a recipe that I think is even closer to Chuy's deliciousness.

First, I had to learn what a tomatillo is (LOL). Recipe is perfect for salad or dipping. We dipped chicken fingers and even the fries. Did anyone mention using this as a sandwich spread? Yummy on roast beef and turkey or chicken !!!

I substituted one serrano pepper instead of the jalapeno since we prefer the flavor of serrano. This was incredibly easy, I threw it all in the ninja and it came out fantastic. I have served it as a dressing for salad and by itself as a dip. Everyone who has tried it has asked me for the recipe.

Very good dressing!  This can be tweaked to your taste.   I used my homemade dried ranch seasoning mix; used a fresh seeded jalapeno as well as about 7 or so slices of pickled jalapeno; used 1 cup non-fat Greek yogurt and about 2 TBS mayo, squirt of fresh lime juice along with the tomatillos and cilantro, plus a little more garlic and cumin.  I know  I didn't follow EXACTLY but that's why I gave it 5 stars.  It worked with my own measurements of ingredients of what I had on hand,  and still came out the way I wanted it.  Tastes best the next day - however, mine was kind of hot, so will not use as many jalapenos next time.  I still love it hot though!  : )

Skip the tomatillo. We were grilling burgers, so I decided I wanted to make my own Monterrey Melt like Whataburger. The recipe says to make & add the green mixture a bit at a time. Rather than having waste, I made 1/3 the green mixture, w/1 tomatillo. Not having enough pickled jalapeno, I used what I did have & added 1 fresh whole jalapeno to the blender with the rest of the ingredients. It was very runny & the flavor wasn't quite right. Not having more sour cream, I added mayo, more & more as I tasted. That fixed it, but over all, it wasn't quite right. I looked up other recipes to compare, & this was the only one w/tomatillo. I suggest 1/3 bunch cilantro, 2 fresh jalapenos (probably). Zero tomatillo. Have extra sour cream /yogurt on hand to add as needed. You'll end up with A LOT.

Oh man, this recipe was so easy and so incredibly delicious. I used 1 fresh jalapeno in place of the pickled, and the heat was spectacular. This is a great dip for chips or veggies!

I had to change a few ingredients depending on what I had in my kitchen!! I used 3 very small poblano peppers instead of tomatillos and jalapenos. It turned out fantastic!! If you want to make a thicker dip, just use more sour cream.

I thought this was a great way to expirament with a new ingredient.  The resulting creamy dip was not bad, but I just think we don't like tomatillos.

Great!  I made a few adjustments to the recipe, and it came out delicious!  I kept the amount of tomatillos and cilantro the same, but I used 2 fresh jalapenos instead of pickled jalapenos, and I only used 8 oz of sour cream (fat free) and 1 packet of ranch like another review had suggested.  Definitely spicy!!

I have never heard of Chuy's, much less tried their dressing so I can't compare. However, this is very good.
