I'm from Louisiana, and this recipe takes the cake!  It's one that tastes like you spent all day in the kitchen, when you didn't!  Kids love it too.  Wonderful with a salad, bread and glass of wine.  I highly recommend this one!!

Hotter'n Hades and VERY fishy-tasting. But EXCELLENT !! I substituted skim milk for the half & half and used low fat Velveeta cheese. Takes a while to prepare but worth it. Yum yum yum :)

This was very good.  I'm from Louisiana and have eaten my fair share of crawfish fettucine and this was really great.  I left out the cayenne pepper so it wouldn't be too, too spicy.  But I used the called for amount of cajun seasoning.  I think next time I make it I'll use a different type of pasta----maybe thin spaghetti or linguine.  Last time I made it I put it in the slow cooker for a work potluck, and it was better than baked.  I didn't cook the noodles and put it on high for 3 hours.  Much creamier than baking.

I THOUGHT THIS RECIPE COULD HAVE BEEN VERY DELICIOUS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN SOOOOOOOOOO! VERY HOT.  I SHOULD NOT HAVE USED AS MUCH CAYENNE PEPPER AS THE RECIPE CALLED FOR. I COULD TELL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DELICOUS OTHERWISE, BUT IT WAS REALLY TOO HOT TO ENJOY.  I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN, BUT NOT WITH THAT MUCH CAYENNE.

This recipe was (IS) delicious!  I am a true Cajun from South Louisiana, and I served it to my family (extended, of course) on Good Friday, instead of the traditional crawfish boil.  Everyone loved it!  It was a little too spicy for the kids, but these kids are all under age 5 - a little less cayenne pepper would likely have made it more palatable for them.  This recipe is a keeper.  I will definitely make this again!

So, I had to comment on this recipe - it was fantastic! However, I would STRONGLY recommend the following substitutions:  - reduced fat cream cheese for "processed cheese food"  - light margarine for butter  - fat free 1/2 and 1/2 for the regular  - add green onions!  Additionally, I didn't bake the dish. I didn't see the point, and it would (I assume) dry out a FABULOUS dish. I also substituted red bell pepper for green (based on what I had around). The above substitutions greatly reduce the "guilt" of this "guilty pleasure" without sacrificing ANY taste! I don't really see how the processed cheese food would work in this recipe, but cream cheese makes it so decadent! I just had to put it up in my fridge to stop eating it! A+

OH MY GOSH!!!!!  If we could rate this 50 stars!, man this is goooooood stuff.  Served this at a dinner party and everyone could not believe how good (NO GREAT)it was (is).  The only thing I'll do different next time is not bake it in the oven, it sort of dried the fettucine out.  But still it was awesome. Thanks X 100.

This recipe is very good BUT watch out!  it could be a killer!!  I added only 1/2 the amount of cajun seasoning and 1/4 of the cayenne pepper and it is still SPICY!!!!  I think it needs salt as well.  I will make this again !!!!!!

This recipes was delicious!  I only used 1 tsp of red pepper as per suggestion from other reviewers.  It turned out great. My friends were begging for the recipe.

I am from South Louisiana and this is almost exactly how I make mine. There is very few differences, I add 2 tablesppons of Parsely flakes, & 1 tablespoon of Jalapeno's (we like the taste it adds) Yes I do sprinkle w/ Cayanne pepper. You can use Old Bay season instead of Cajun Season. I do not add Parmesan cheese and I do not bake it. If I don't have time to chop the cajun trinity (vegetables) I use a bag of Season Blends (found in freezer section next to frozen vegetables. I serve this with garlic bread and salad with italian dressing.

Loved it.  I didn't have enough processed cheese so I used what I had AND Cream Cheese.  Instead of baking in oven, I shortened stove top cooking time on everything by 5-10 min and placed in crock pot to cook on low for 2 hours. This kept my house from being too hot and the dish still remained creamy in texture.

Very good recipe. We eat a lot of spicy foods so this is pretty mild for my family. Good with side salad and a crusty bread.

I am also from southern Louisiana and I LOVE this recipe!! It is so easy to make and delicious. I like trying it with different kinds of pasta. I like spicy food so I add a little extra cayenne pepper. I recommend using less than the recommended cayenne if you are not a fan of spicy or are serving it to guests.  I skip the oven step.

This dish is definitely a crowd-pleaser! As per the suggestions of the other reviewers, I reduced the amount of seasoning from 2 tsp each cayenne and tony cachere's to 1/2 tsp each, figuring I could add more if need be.  Even with that small amt. of seasoning, it was spicy!  I'd also like to try it with some bow tie pasta.

Made this for the first time and it was pretty tasty. It does take a long time to make, but it's worth it :) I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 because the sauce was thick and sticky when I went BACK for seconds. Maybe I didn't prepare it correctly? I'd make it again ??

This recipe is tasted great and was very easy.  I do have to say that it wasn't as good for leftovers.  I would only make it again if I knew that there wouldn't be any leftovers.  The fettuccine was a little on the dry side, but I'm sure some adjustments could be made and it would turn out better if I make it again.

Really, really good stuff.  I had to make my own processed cheese (just heated about a cup of half-and-half and added  1.5 cups shredded 4 cheese mexican blend - all I had on hand) and it turned out wonderfully.  I also halved the cayenne and substituted Stubbs Barbecue Seasoning when I discovered I'd run out of Cajun Seasoning.  Also had to use garlic powder instead of fresh and ended up adding about a cup of milk toward the end as the sauce was really thick. Oh yeah, hubby hates celery so I used quartered artichoke hearts. No baking either.  It would have probably rec'd five stars if I'd had all the original ingredients on hand, but was SO happy that this turned out so very, very well.

I hate it when people change recipes, too but here goes: Trader Joe's sells 1 lb. bags of a combo of shrimp, scallops and calamari and I used that instead of crawfish and also added a couple shakes of Old Bay Seasoning - it was really outstanding - was a little skeptical of the Velveeta but it worked out great - thanks for a recipe I'll use again!

This was way good! I made as low fat as possible. I used low fat cream cheese and fat free half and half. I also used whole wheat fettuccine and served with whole wheat rolls I made. I also put shrimp along with some frozen crawfish meat that I had put in the freezer from a crawfish boil.  This came out so good...my hubby took one bite and said please make this again. it is a little spicy but very tasty

My Fiance and I loved this recipe. We used shrimp instead of crawfish and we skipped out on the cayenne pepper all together instead we just used cajun seasoning and red pepper flakes. We didn't cook it for as long as it says but we were also only making enough for two.Tahnks for a great recipe

Absolutely great.  We made this with shrimp instead.  Forgot the flour step and didn't cook it as long as recommended at all (also didn't bake it at the end) - and it was the perfect consistency.  We will be making this again, and often!

Wow! I'm another native Louisianan who thinks this is the real deal! Easy to prepare...even though it does take a bit of time, but it is well worth the wait. Thanks for posting this one.

I didn't bother to check the prep or cook time for this recipe, and it was VERY time consuming.  All I have to say is the time was well worth it.  My husband helped me make it and we both had to pry ourselvels away from our plates.  Ciao.

Delicious.  Used 1/2 lb crawfish and 1/2 lb shrimp, 1/4 tsp cajun and 1/4 tsp cayenne (gave it a little kick but mild enough for everyone).  I used half a box of fetttuccine pasta and mixed cheese sauce in noodles, skipped baking process. Served as a side dish with leftover roast beef and side salad.

Just cooked this pasta for dinner. It was very tasty and creamy. I suggest the following changes (per other reviews). Reduce the cayenne by half or even more if you don't like it spicy. I am from Louisiana and love the heat but 2 tsp is waaay too much. If you like saucier pasta definitely skip the baking step and either double the cheese sauce ingredients or reduce the amount of pasta. The proportions as written in the recipe will produce dry pasta.

My husband said this was delicious which means a lot.  I subbed shrimp for the crawfish because I had those on hand.  Will try crawfish next time.  Loved the cayenne.  We love spicy!!

Great recipe and was a big hit at our party.  I was a little leery about adding Velveeta, but it worked out great.  I only added 1 tsp cayenne after reading other reviews, but might kick it up to 1 1/2 tsps next time for a little more spice.

Highly highly disappointed. I have been using this site for years and always go off of the other reviews. I followed the recipe exactly except used 1/4 tsp ceyanne because of all the reviews. The came out like the flour did not dissolve. Let me know if anyone else had this problem PLEASE!

I gave this recipe to my daughter (a new cook) to try for a family dinner.  It turned out great!!  Not to hot at all, but then we are Louisianians and used to a little spice!! In fact, she added quite a bit of Tony Chacheres'(a local seasoning)! It was very easy for her to prepare and praised by everybody, which made her day!!

I just recently had a superbowl party..GO GIANTS!! Let's just say this was the hit of the party. I changed the servings to 24 and used shrimp instead -it was perfect! I am from Baton Rouge, LA and know what spicy is, I did not use any cayenne pepper but used plenty of the cajun seasoning to make it just right. I found that the sauce went to the bottom of the pan, so I chilled it for about an hour and stirred the mixture in the baking pan to make it just right..PERFECT! It was great, I never knew how to cook this and always wanted to learn, Thanks for making this my new favorite! It is very easy too. :)

Prepared for a group this past weekend, and everyone went wild over it... Served it with a spinach salad that had strawberries, toasted almonds, and a dressing made with sesame seeds, poppy seeds, olive oil, rice wine vinegar, sugar, worchestshire sauce, garlic powder and a dash of cajun seasoning. Served also with some good garlic bread, and made raspberry bars for dessert. Left everyone raving.........

Very creamy and the velveeta was very potent!  Not a big fan of "processed cheese food".  I would try previous suggestions with cream cheese over velveeta.

WOW! This is my NEW favorite dish.  The only thing different that I did was add one chopped fresh tomato at the same time that I added the cheese.  I actually picked this dish for my valantines dinner and could not be happier with the ease of preperation, presentation, low-cost, and...of course the taste!!  Fabulous!  Thank you for sharing!!!!!!!

We have been making this recipe for 3 years and it is one of our favorites! The only thing I do differently is that I use cream cheese instead of processed cheese and I do not bake it. We eat it right after we combine the noodles and the sauce. Otherwise, we follow the recipe and it always turns out sooooo good! We love it!

I tried this recipe using cream cheese instead of processed cheese, and I used 1 tsp of cayenne. My husband LOVED it, saying it was one of the best things I've ever cooked. The 1 tsp of cayenne was spot on - goodly heat, but without detracting from the enjoyment of eating the dish. The only changes I might make next time will be to cut back a little on the cream cheese and increase the half and half to make it a bit creamier, and/or make the dish in my slow cooker as per some of the other suggestions.  When I cooked the dish in the oven, I covered it with foil until the last five minutes, to keep the fettuccine from drying out. Delicious!

This is a really good dish. I substitute rotini pasta for the fettuccine.  I also add 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 can Rotel, (sometimes hot Rotel.) Add these in with the cheese and half and half.  Really takes it up a notch!  Instead of cayenne pepper I use a sprinkle of my favorite hot sauce as well. Everyone loves it!!! One more thing, I'm also from Louisiana so I always use the Louisiana crawfish tails in the store, no matter how much they cost!  It's worth it. I have also made this with pieces of boneless chicken breast which have been sauteed and spagetti pasta.  Pretty good as well!

I didnt like it very much.  The cheese made it too thick and the oven made it dry.  I also feel that the cajun seasoning made it salty.   I'm going to make some adjustments to the recipe and make it my own because I think it can be delicious for my taste.

This was so easy to make.  Cleaning crawfish is really gross though.  The end result tasted so good I couldn't stop eating it.  I was surprised because I didn't think the processed cheese would be a good idea, but it was.  Great recipe and will definitely make again.

My husband and I really, really enjoyed this. Will definitely make it again ~ especially for company.  Cooking for 2, I halved the first 4 items. Once the onions were soft, the heat was reduced to low (to keep it from scorching or getting too pasty). Added  approx. 2 lbs tail meat from a recent crawfish boil. Instead of "processed cheese food" I used 4 oz low fat cream cheese.   All that tail meat made it pretty thick, so I ended up using 1 1/4 cup fat-free 1/2 & 1/2. Also added 3 thinly sliced green onions. So many reviewers said it was too spicy, so I used 1/2 tsp cajun seasoning, 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper, and a dash of salt.   It heated over low for over an hour.  The crawfish stayed tender, the flavors blended VERY well, and the spice factor was perfect. Wonder if mascarpone would be an alternate for cream cheese.  Did not bake... doesn't seem like there's enough liquid.  Added a ladle of pasta water to the crawfish sauce & tossed it with the fettuccine.   YUMMY.

I had this recipe saved for a while and finally decided to make it.  It was fantastic.  I followed past reviewers and only put in 1 tsp of cayenne pepper, tasted it after it simmered a few minutes.  It does NOT need the 2nd tsp.

This is a great recipe.  I bring two pans to pot lucks and it always disappears.  I do cut back on the cayenne because it can be a little spicy.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.  This recipe is always requested and I gladly share it.  Everyone loves it.

Oh my this is one spicy but awesome dish!! I used already cooked tails so 
I did not add them until I added the cheese. I also cut back on the
cayenne to 1 teaspoonful. Would of given it more stars if I could.

It was quite spicy but the flavors seemed to mix well together.  I did use shrimp, scallops, and crab instead of crawfish but it was great.  I'm wondering though, why is it necessary to simmer the sauce for almost 40 minutes?  I couldn't notice a change in the consistancy of the sauce after the half & half and cheese was added during the simmering process.  Thanks for the recipe!

Holy Moly this stuff is hot!  Don't get me wrong, it is really good but I thought that the other reviewers were just being wienies when I read about cutting back on the cayenne pepper. We all eat really hot stuff but boy was I wrong. Cayenne pepper is not to be toyed with! Delicious none the less, I will just heed others advice in the future. Thanks!

HOLY $#%^ this recipe is awesome. Although crawfish is rather expensive up here in AK, this recipe makes it well worth it. The sauce and everything was well balanced and tasted just right, creole but not TOO spicy. Cheesy, but not too alfredo... great mix. I switched it up a bit and used 5oz Smoked Cheddar spread with 4oz Velveeta to give it a little smokey flavor (alaskans seem to dig the smokey stuff more that the state... hmmm) Anyways, it turned out great, next time i would actually ALMOST double the the veggies('cept the celery)... OH, and i used 1 Bell Pepper and 1/2 Red Pepper.... would double that and the other veggies(except the celery). Serve with a nice salad, and your golden.

I made this as one of the dishes for my Mardi Gras party and it was a great hit.  Everyone loved it.  I used H.E.B.'s Easy Melt processed cheese instead of Velveeta and I used 2 cloves of garlic.  I will definitely make this again.

Awesome! I used Boudreaux frozen crawfish tails and frozen shrimp from my local Walmart store. My family loved it and my hubby who doesn't care for seafood or tails went back for seconds. I also used Tony's Chachere's Orginal Creole Seasoning and a pinch of cayenne pepper, velvetta cheese, and shredded Parmesan cheese.  I will be making this again and again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty. I didn't use enough flour though. (I added a smidgen more butter and half/half) I also added shrimp and scallops since I didn't have as much leftover crawfish from the boil that I wanted.

Just wanted to say that this is the best crawfish fettuccine that I have had in forever. I am from New Orleans and I have ate lots of fettuccine, but this one was delicious. I am cooking it tonight but I am replacing the crawfish with shrimp. I will let you know how it turns out.

Delicious! I also added a can to drained rotel and added the seasonings to taste.

Awesome recipe...made a few changes.. instead of green pepper, use a red pepper (sweeter) & instead of crawfish use canned (real) lump crabmeat.  It makes this fantastic "fancy macaroni and cheese".  Adjust the level of spice to your liking.

This was great. Too hot, though. I almost cut back on the cayenne but decided to just follow the recipe straight. I wish I would have because it was too hot to even enjoy. My husband asked me cook this again tonight, but without so much cayenne! Other than the spice I thought it was wonderful. Baking the dish really made the sauce thicken up so you can enjoy it without having to lick the bowl - it's that good!

A new family favorite! Creamy, rich goodness. I used a little less pasta (I like lots of sauce), used less cayenne (I only used 1 TSP) and didn't simmer as long since I used precooked crawfish tails. It was perfect! I also used a red pepper instead of green, for a little sweeter flavor and omitted the celery altogether (can't stand the stuff!)I'd be curious to try it with other types of shellfish like other reviewers. That sounds good too!

This was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for using spinach and plain fettuccine) and it was excellent.  Easy to make and made a hit with everyone at the dinner!!  Served with some garlic toast and that was all that was needed!  Thanks, Cynthia, for sharing this wonderful recipe.
