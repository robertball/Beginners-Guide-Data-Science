NOTE: should also go under 'Tabouli' : Turkish Version. 

this is great, and i more or less did it the same...BUT i will ONLY make this on the weekend bc mincing takes forever and makes me tired as does cleaning and picking apart parsley and mint. the reason mine is different is because i got tired and wasn't chopping up more stuff. my husband loves this salad, but without the olive oil (it's great and refreshing without it) and with some extra hot pepper flakes. the ingredients i put less or more of in: 1/2 onion (more or less minced PLUS 6 green onions, the latter i took from another, similar recipe); 1 large tomato (one more would have been good, but got tired); 1/2 red bell pepper (it's what i had on hand and was also more or less minced); about 1 cup of parsley, and about one 1/4 cup of mint (more mint would have been better, as in the recipe); and no pomegrante/balsamic (i did add about 1/2 tspn of salt). more mint, or more of most ingredients would have been wonderful. this is a flexible keeper of a recipe that you can totally have fun with...thanks for sharing it :)

As is it is good but usually you add red pepper paste(biber salcasi)to this if you can find it. It is an excellent flavor that makes this even more delish. Thank you!

A great recipe for Bulgur (aka Tabbouleh) Salad.  We enjoyed the addition of the pomegranate molasses.  I left out the green bell pepper as I did not have any on hand.

You don't want to heat the olive oil and cook the onions.  I used succulent red onions. Also, if you can find sumac, add a tablespoon  of it.

It is much more than 6 servings.  I will not be able to keep it all. Perhaps half the ingredients next time.  I plan to use it as breakfast and lunch entree but if the calorie content isnâ€™t enough then it may end up as a side dish.

I made it yesterday. It's nice but it needs salt and more olive oil.

The way we make it is, we cook grated onion with olive oil, a table spoon of tomato paste and a table spoon of red pepper paste. Then add this to softened bulgur. then add green onions, parsley, salt, red pepper flakes, lemon juice and /or pomegranate molasses. We don't put tomato, cucumber or red bell peppers into kisir. But I'm sure that makes it delicious :)
