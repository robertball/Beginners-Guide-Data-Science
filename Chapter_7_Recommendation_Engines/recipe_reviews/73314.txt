these were okay. not really much flavor, other than it tasted like a cresent with some sun dried tomatos in them. now i didnt really understand the directions on the rolling part. that was kind of confusing. so i made up my own way to do them. after dinner i put the leftovers in the refrigerator, and they were better cold. they were okay, i dont really think they will be made again unless i have some sundried tomatos lying around.

I thought these were super simple to whip up, and I just adjusted a tad to make it easier for myself.  I used the food processor to chop the sun dried tomatoes, then added the remaining ingredients and pulsed together.  It worked perfectly for me.  I was a tad confused by the instructions to roll up; it's probably me, but I didn't understand why you couldn't just roll up starting on one end, so that's what I did.  I also didn't flip in the oven; I would've made a mess, knowing me, so I just let it bake for 10 minutes total on the same side and it worked fine.  Served as a side with some soup and it made for a filling and warm dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe.  It can be made as is or with extra garlic to make it more flavorful.  My family likes it either way.  I used only the egg white to brush over the top and they are delicious either warm or cold.  Also, very easy to make.

These were so yummy and tasty!  Instead of chopping sun dried tomatoes I just used sun dried tomato pesto, and sprinkled with the cheese.  I'll bet these would be delicious with basil pesto, too.  Great little appy or nibble for soup or salad.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.  This is a keeper and a do-over for sure.

I made these yesterday for Mother's Day and they were a hit! They were all gone in a matter of minutes. I did add 2 more garlic cloves (you can never have enough garlic) and I used extra sundried tomatoes. This was delicious and will definitely be made again. Quick and easy!! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

3.19.18  My sun-dried tomatoes were julienned, rather than whole, so I had no way to really accurately measure how many I needed for the filling, can only say that I needed more.  I will not bother to flip the palmiers half way through the cooking cycle next time.  The one thing that I didn’t care for was how the tomatoes on the bottom  had a bit of a burned taste.  I’m thinking that may be because they already were browned/cooked before they were flipped.  Not sure, but it’s worth a shot.  This is a very easy appetizer and one that I think can go from 4 stars to 5 with a bit more attention on my part.  Thanks for sharing.

I wanted these as appetizers, so I cut the dough lengthwise, and made little palmiers. I used my black and decker chopper to make the mixture with the sundried tomatoes and the garlic. I added a tablespoon of dried red pepper flake. Then I used a spatula to spread the mixture on the rolled out dough. Then I sprinkled a small amount, maybe a few tablespoons  of shredded parmesean cheeze over mixture. I cut them approx 1 inch long each, then baked per the recipe. Approximately 4 minutes each side. I didn't need to oil my pain, I thought the mixture and dough was oily enough. People raved about them.

Fiancé loves these. Simple to make and delicious to eat. I don't use the exact measurements, but the taste of the combination of the tomatoes with the cheese is delicious!
