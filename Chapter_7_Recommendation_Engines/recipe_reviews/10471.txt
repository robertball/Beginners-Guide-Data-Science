This recipe is awesome!  For my French class, the final was to make a recipe and then do other work showing how to make it, etc.  I chose this recipe and my class loved it.  I didn't use almonds, however.  Instead, I used crushed cinnamon graham crackers.  Believe me, it is a great alternative to use rather than the traditional almonds.

I made these for my French class, and they were a big success.  I would recommend using a food processor for the almonds and the chocolate.  It's a huge time saver and it's really easy.  I just used a small one that attached to my blender, so you don't need a big fancy one.  Also, when you bake them, don't use a convection overn.  I did, and my cookies didn't turn out as crunchy as I had hoped. 

This is a great recipe, I'm definately making these again!

I made these for my French class and they all loved them! Definitely use the crushed almonds, as they give the cookies just the right amount of crunch. P.S...These aren't the easiest or quickest cookies to make, and that's because you have to roll them in the coating one by one. I've found it easiest to do that part with my fingers, but if you do, clean and dry your fingers often or the cookies will stick to them making the cookies impossible to handle.

I used a bread knife to cut up the chocolate and a coffee grinder to crush the almonds. Those two things made this easier and I have been making these every year for Christmas for the past 4 years. They are always a BIG hit. I suggest using the almonds and not substituting with graham crackers.

These are only ok. How they taste is definately not worth the amount of work that goes into them.

I'm 17 and I had to cook for international day in my french class. I didn' want somethin g that would require much work but this recipe was well worth it. It took me about 4 an a half hours and i used cinnamon graham crackers instead of almonds and they turned out really good. Everyone was asking for the recipe and came back for seconds. It has just the right balance of chocolate and isn't too sweet nor bitter. I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to impress a crowd or to spoil someone.

I am a horrible baker with no patience, so these were a little tricky to make with having to hand grate the chocolate (it can be a lot of labor).. but it was worth it!  I have made them twice and everyone that has tried them loved them.  They are not too sweet and they have a wonderful texture.  They are great to toss into a tin and give as a gift.  I am looking for an alternate way of getting the chocolate in the recipe, though.

My daughter made these for French class.  These were very tasty, but she rates them 4 stars because grating the chocolate is a bit of a chore.  We followed someone else's suggestion & used crushed cinnamon graham crackers for about 2 cups of the ground almonds & left out the cinnamon in the recipe. Also added a couple of drops of almond extract since we left only 1/2 cup in the recipe.  The kids loved them & wished we had made more!

this is a great recipe and these were fantastic. i made them for the french club's table at international day at my university and they were a hit. i even bought some of my own cookies, they were so good. 

instead of chilling the dough for one hour, i let it sit overnight so i could do the rest of the steps the following day.

i used slivered almonds & ground them in my coffee grinder but i have seen ground almonds in baking sections at some stores.
i used ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa (bar form) cut it up into small pieces and put it in the coffee grinder.

a must try! very easy if you can take the time for the steps.

So much work for not alot of yield.  Not a great taste but the texture was good.  I may try again and use a different chocolate.

Really, really delicious.  Kind of like a cross between marzipan and truffles.  I also used a grinder for the chocolate - it was just taking ages to grate it by hand.
