I agree with the previous reviewer. The flavors are on the subtle side. I doubled the garlic, cumin and canned tomatoes. I also added 2-3 teaspoons of Tapatio hot sauce. Like the previous reviewer, I’m no Peruvian chef. While I feel my changes gave a better flavor profile—U worry that I might be steering away from Peruvian cuisine. My next thought is to add interest with the rice. I’m going to look for a cilantro-rice recipe.
