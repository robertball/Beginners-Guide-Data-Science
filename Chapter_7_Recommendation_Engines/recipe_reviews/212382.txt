These were really good and easy.  I added some jalepenos and baked them with no oil, just spray and they turned out perfectly.  Served as appetizers.

DOH!  Why didn't I think of this before?  I made these in appetizer size and they were gone in a flash.  For speed, I used thawed frozen hashed browns, and they worked just fine.  Just enough kick to be interesting.  I would suggest using a quality cajun seasoning.  (If you're looking to watch your sodium intake, there are many fine salt-free cajun seasonings available.)  I'm certain that I'll try these latkes in other ethnic incarnations as well:  mexican, etc.  Thank you, CC!

I was tired of hearing my Jewish friend brag nonstop over her husband's latkes, so I decided to make a more flavorful version. ;)  These were very good.  I used the exact amount of Cajun seasoning, and thought it was perfect...flavorful, but not overwhelming.  I would make these again.

These were fantastic! I halved the recipe just to try them and wish I hadn't, as they really had great flavor. I used refrigerated hash browns instead of fresh. I did use more cajun seasoning than called for, and added a bit of garlic powder. SO YUMMY! I will definately be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Loved these!  I defrosted frozen shredded hash browns in the microwave for a quick fix.  I added  3 cloves of minced garlic and I used olive oil, as that is the only oil I keep in the house.

These were really tasty. I added fresh parsley, garlic & a handful of shredded Asiago cheese too. However, I should not have let them sit for an hour before frying or I should have strained the juices first. They were a bit mushy in the center but still very good.

It took a while,  because I was doing this for a school project  and I didn't buy pre packaged ones so I had to peel and shred 8 potatoes, Also, there was a lot of egg.

DELICIOUS!!!  Hubby and I filled up on these and left almost all of the BBQ ribs on the platter!  I used half bacon grease (I'm old-school) and half canola oil. I may add a little garlic next time, but the recipe is great as-is.

I only had blue potatoes and figured I would give this a shot. My food processor has a shred disk. Very good, but I may use an electric griddle next time instead of using all the oil.
