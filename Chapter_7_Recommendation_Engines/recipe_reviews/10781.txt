Fun! I followed the recipe exactly - and added a candied espresso bean to my nests with the chocolate covered raisins. It ain't so easy to form the nests with a spoon, let alone 'make an indentation.' I ended up just piling my nests with my fingers - messy, but more effective. Thanks for the recipe!
