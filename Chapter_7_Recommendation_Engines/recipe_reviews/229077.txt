As a vegan dish, really tasty!  We didn't even use the vegetable juice or soy-based liquid, and it was a hit with our vegetarian-leaning brood.  Thanks for sharing the recipe. Cheers!

Surprisingly very good dish! As a substitute for real ceviche- no: the cauliflower does have a completely different taste/texture that stands out (in a good way!). As a different and unique dish that captures the "spirit" of what ceviche flavor is (spicy, citrusy, juicy)- absolutely! Definitely agree with other reviewers and reccommend that you let this sit and marinade for a bit before digging in- the flavors just intensify and really come together- sooo good! Thank you, Michelle, for sharing! (^v^)

Amazing! I had to make a few changes- added corn, and used spicy Rotel instead of fresh tomato & peppers bc I didn’t have them... also didn’t have any fresh cilantro, but I didn’t miss it. I can’t wait to try tomorrow after the leftovers have marinated overnight! I will definitely make this again. ??????

Excellent.  A bit like a gazpacho.  As noted you can add a variety of vegetables.  I overdid the heat( picante) a bit but still very tasty.

I added shredded carrots and sweet bell pepper. I also put a bit of garlic powder and half spoon of apple cider vinegar and I turned out great. Even my non-vegetarian friends liked it

Soo good better the longer it sits if you can make it and refrigerate over night better!
