Here is how NOT to make this recipe: The first time I made it, I poured the sugar syrup into the glass baking dish, and because the glass was cool, the sugar hardened almost immediately. So after I spent the next 30 minutes chipping a rock-hard blob of sugar out of the bottom of my dish, I tried it again. But this time, I put the baking dish in a hot oven for about 5 minutes before adding the sugar. The hot dish kept the sugar liquified just long enough for me to get an even coating. After I learned that trick, the flan turned out very well. I made this for dessert after a Mexican-themed dinner, and everyone really liked it.

I let this flan sit over night in the fridge, but when I flipped it out of the pan the next day, almost all of the caramel stayed in the pan with hardly any of it at all on top of the flan. What am I doing wrong?? Can anybody help me??

so good, so creamy! I don't usually care for the regular flan consistency, so I tried this creamy one - oh my so good and so easy. I didn't use their caramel recipe though - too many people seemed to have problems with it.  I used a carmel recipe I have (1 small box brown sugar, 1 stick butter, 1 cup half and half, pinch of salt, tsp of vanilla- boil for three minutes).

This is my grandmother's recipe.  I love it!. Have been making it for years.  TIP:I just put all the ingredients in the blender and it makes a very smooth and creamy flan. Great time saver!

I havent made this recipe but it is exactly the same as mine, so I bet is the best one on this page!! =D
One person said that she poured the caramel in a cold glass baking dish and it hardened immediately, so she had a hard time taking it out and doing it again.. Let me tell you, I have made this recipe for years and sometimes it hardens like u said and theres no problem, since you normally put the flan mixture on top and its going to be cooked in the oven, melting the caramel again, evenly on the bottom. So, if the caramel is not spreaded evenly at the beginning, dont worry, the flan is going to turn out amazing anyway..

This caramel flan is perfect.  I have made it twice, once for a dinner party and once for a wedding reception.  Everyone who tries it LOVES it, even people who don't necessarily have a liking for flan.  People also keep asking me when I am going to make it again.  The melted sugar is very simple if you pay attention because it will seem like the sugar will never melt and then all of sudden it is brown and fluid.  Simply pour into the pan quickly and try to coat as much as possible before it hardens.  It doesn't matter if it coats the bottom of the pan unevenly because the flan mixture sitting in the pan for 8 hours while it is refrigerating, will smooth out the melted sugar and make a perfect topping once it is flipped.  (Trust me, both times the sugar hardened too quickly but the end result was perfection.)

This tastes really great - the whole family loved it! I made it exactly as written. Some other reviews had trouble with the caramel but I made mine - just sugar - in about 7 minutes. I did warm the pan in the oven while it was heating and everything turned out a dream. One note about the pans - you really need a proper deep cake pan (NOT springform as water will get in) - I used an 8" pan with 3" sides and it was perfect. I did have a 10" pan but found it wouldn't fit into any of my baking pans for the "bath" - I also would find it challenging to find a 10" rimmed platter (and it does need a rim as the caramel is runny) - so the 8" was great to fit into a baking pan and onto a plate.

Loved this recipe! I made three for a big party and it was great. Some tips I used were to let the eggs and cream cheese come to room temp before mixing, be sure to beat well after each egg is added for the lightest texture and don't overcook sugar in the first step. If you do make more than one at a time like I did, do not try to do the carmelized sugar in one large batch, it will not work well, I had brittle sugar by the time it had all melted, then I redid it in individual batches. But I used the brittle for decoration.

delicious.  i substituted melted vanilla bean ice cream for the sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 and 1/2 for evaporated milk & it turned out great.  when melting the sugar for the sauce, use med. heat, keep stirring constantly & remove from heat as soon as it turns brown & liquefies.  if sauce hardens too quickly before spreading in bottom of pan, microwave it for 20 secs or so & it'll spread fine.

This is not a Spanish flan (which is "eggy"), but an excellent Costa Rican flan (which is more like caramel cheesecake)!  Some tricks to make this easier...  (1) Let all ingredients come to room temperature before beginning.  (2) Place baking dish in a larger dish that has one inch of warm water in it.  This will warm up your baking dish for pouring in the caramel, and then you can just leave the baking dish in the water bath instead of using the towel.  (3) Add just a little water to the sugar, it will take longer to carmelize, but it's much harder to burn!  Also, you'll have a little more time to spread it in the baking dish before it hardens.  (4) To minimize spillage...mix the flan ingredients in a blender, pull out the oven rack, place baking dish in water bath on rack, pour flan into baking dish, and slide rack back into oven.

This is good.  Maybe a first cousin to cheesecake. It's not as "eggy" or custardy like traditional flan, but much creamier and denser.  Very much like eating cheesecake. I doubled the recipe and used a pound cake pan (not bundt - it wasn't a decorative pan, but flat and round) to bake in. I was a bit lazy when making this so instead of melting the sugar and pouring into the pan, I sprayed the entire inside with cooking spray and sprinkled the bottom heavily with turbinado sugar.  I put the pan in a 350 degree oven for about 12 minutes to semi-melt the sugar, and then poured the contents over. After mixing everything, I used a hand blender to completely combine and make it smooth.  Don't like those cream cheese chunks! Baked in a water bath. It was ready in exactly 65 minutes. Internal temp should read 180.  Will make again.

Cream cheese-based flans are typically less popular in Latin countries, but I believe if enough people foisted this recipe on friends and family all over the world, we would never hear of the regular run-of-the-mill flan ever again.  You can't do better than this recipe, but if you wanted an even creamier consistency, use 5 jumbo-sized eggs (this recipe doesn't include the recommended size of the egg), removing the egg white from one (if not two) of the eggs.  When cooking the sugar, remember that it will continue to cook for a while after you've taken the saucepan off the flame. If you're worried about the sugar burning, take it off the flame when there's still a few clumps of sugar waiting to dissolve.   To those perplexed by the amount of sugar that remains stuck to the pan when turning over the flan...don't be afraid to experiment: Chip away at the sugar and dump it into a bowl and crush the sugar into bits, after which you can sprinkle it atop the flan. (Or place the sugar, in shards, around the flan; people, trust me, will love munching on it.)  Also, I find that using a disposable aluminum pan produces significantly tastier results. That said, aluminum pans are rare in 10-inch sizes, so what I do is make two little flans (with the excess batter) in two small creme brulee dishes, letting them cook next to the bigger flan in the water bath.

This is a great recipe, been a guatemalan, I know flan, and there is several different tipes of flan.  My favorite one is Flan de Queso (cheese flan, this one), because of texture and because it is sooo creamy.  The "real one" or the one many reviewers are seeking is not made with cheese.  This recipe has nothing wrong, the "problem" is that this is a variation, there are also fruit flans, even a chocolate flan.  So this one is ment to taste cheesy.  If what you are looking for is the "real flan" (the basic recipe) don´t try this one, look for a recipe that does not call for cheese, fruit or chocolate.  I strongly suggest to try this one, my favorite, though.

This is my first time making flan.  This recipie was a hit.  Instead of using a round baking dish I used a cupcake/ muffin tin to make individual servings for a mexican luncheon.  The sugar mixture hardened before I could coat the sides of the muffin tin, so I decided to just pour it on the bottom. This worked well. I did have to adjust the cooking time, as it doesn't take as long because of the smaller individual portions.  I think the total time was about 20-25 minutes.  I made three batches, the first one I overcooked, even it was good.  The subsequent batches however, were MUCH better.  Be sure to take it out of the oven when the center is JUST set, for a creamy treat.  Also, under no circumstances should you ever touch the liquid sugar no matter how cool you might think it is.  If you choose to ignore this advice, please don't stick your flaming finger in your mouth...trust me, it's just not a good idea ;)

Fantastic! Here is how I made it:

- The first time I tried to make the caramel, it struck me as strange that it didn't contain any water. So, I added the amount of sugar mentioned (3/4 cup) and just a little bit of water. Result: It liquified, but never became brown, so I waited and all I had in the end was brittle sugar!
- The second time, though, I used JUST the sugar at first. When it became brown and started to liquify, I used a couple of tablespoons of water, and there it was: Perfect caramel syrup!
- I cooked it in a water bath, used aluminum foil all the way, waited 2 hours with the oven door open and then refrigerated it. Finally, before turning it upside down, I dipped the bottom of the pan in boiling water for 5 seconds.

Results: Perfect flan consistency, elegant presentation, divine taste! My fiance loved it, and even I, that I am not a big caramel fan, couldn't get enough!

Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

After reading a good deal of the reviews, I tried this recipe, but I decreased the amount of cream cheese to 4oz. I was looking for a creamy and light flan (rather than thick and rich and cheesecakey). This was perfect! The caramel is the hardest part, followed by the whole water bath process... but the results are well worth the effort. Many reveiwers mentioned that the caramel "never set up." Traditional flan does not have gooey sticky caramel, but rather a light thin caramel sauce. It's not supposed to set up. Anyhow, this flan recipe is delicious and creamy, with perfect caramel sauce. I don't plan to try any other flan recipes. This one is perfect.

This was awesome! I took the advice of some & warmed my baking dish in the oven prior to filling it. I used a little over a cup of sugar & didn't have any trouble making caramel but I used a diffuser under the pan. I decreased the cream cheese by half & subbed a half a can of pumpkin puree instead, I also added a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg & a pinch of cloves. Yummy! I will be repeating this for Thanksgiving!!!

This recipe was so delicious!  I would suggest not to add water to the sugar.  Just be patient!  It takes about 30 min or longer.  Use a good heavy saucepan, stainless steel.  Don't stir the sugar too much or it will clump and take longer to melt.  Once melted don't get discouraged if it cools to fast to spead over the entire bottom of the baking dish.  When it gets cooked it will liquify and spread.  I baked this for 1 hr and came out perfect.

I absolutely love this flan, it is creamy and smooth. I do however have some warnings. 

First, The only way you will get a creamy consistency is by using a blender, DO NOT use a mixer because it will not blend the cream cheese well, what you will be left with is a clumpy mess. 

Lastly, the longer you leave it in the fridge, the tastier it will be. For this dessert time is essential, the longer you leave it, the creamier it will be.

It is a lot faster and easier if you just put all the ingredients in a blender and blend till smooth. Make a little extra caramel, and pour into the pan that has been warmed for easier spreading. Delicious. Thank you for sharing.

I made this recipe once. I made it in 8 individual flan dishes. The taste and texture were fantastic. My man loved it, as did our guests. I'd give this recipe 5 stars if the caramel didn't stick to the flan dish.

*****
Okay, I made this recipe one more time. This time I added water to the sugar to make my caramel. It was easier to control. The sugar syrup slowly boiled away and turned into a beautiful caramel.

This time I also cooked the flans in a microwave.

My first desert ever made. It was an INSTANT success! It was a little too sweet so next time i'll use 2/3 or 1/2 of the sweet condensed milk can. I also used 1/4 of the cream cheese. My whole entire family LOVED it. I was a bigger success than my mother's famous flan. Definitely worth making!! You'll love it!

This recipe turned out great! Instead of mixing the liquid slowly into the creamcheese... I decided to blend all the liquids together in my blender then I added cheamcheese chucks slowly while the blender was on low. Blended perfectly! The sugar hardened to my bowl like everyone else commented that it would.. I just didn't worry about it. I added the mixure and baked. The caramel sauce will evenly distribute over the bottom while it's baking. :) So no need to warm up your bowl before putting the caramel sauce in it. Just too much of a hassel for something thats going to fix itself in the oven anyway.

The recipe is similar to the one I've made over the years, we use only 4 eggs and always, always use 1/2 C sugar, once it's yellow in color we add 1/4 C Caro corn syrup.....it will never, ever harden on you.

This was the best flan I have ever had. It was 100 times better than any restaurant. This was my first time making flan.  I follow this recipe exactly and it came out perfect. I just added one additional ingredient which was cinnamon. The cinnamon gave it an intoxicating aroma. Everyone in my family loved this. I will defiantly make this Again!!

It was really good, I had to make it for my Spanish class at school. Mostly everyone liked it, but one of the problems was that I let the sugar cook for too long so it became too dark and tasted a little bitter. So you have to make sure to not overcook the sugar.   It's also important to have the water bath because I made it once without it and it turned out to become a disaster.

WOW..I LOVED this recipe so do my husband and my friends, I can eat a whole flan all by myself. I made this morning and had it after dinner about 8 hours in the fridge.Blended all ingredients in the blender to make it fast and smooth and not messy. I had no problem with the caramel sauce, it turn out great..I used 1 cup instead of 3/4 cup and heat it in a sauce pan for medium low heat about 25 mins, be patient, don't stir, but you can swirls, I did not used a towel and bake it for about 1 hour and let it cool in the water bath about an hour before you put in the fridge. I will make this again..LOVED IT

I thought this dish was wonderful. Although, not quick, it wasn't too difficult.  Since it was my first time making and eating Flan, I wasn't sure what to expect.  My sister said that it tasted like the authentic stuff she had while she was in Mexico, so definitley a compliment there!  Thank you for the recipe and I'll be making this one again.  Note: don't stick your finger in melted sugar no matter how cooled off you think it is (I learned that the hard way)!!  I found that the ideal cooking time was 52-53 minutes for the perfect texture.

Okay so I cheated, but it turned out great and we loved it! Creamy, soft, but not too spongey like regular flan.

I'll go ahead and say what I did, for the other idiots out there who are as horrible in the kitchen as I am that can benefit from this. 

I tried cooking the sugar… but I burned it and ruined one of my pans. So I used Smucker's Caramel Spread instead. Then I followed the instructions on the flan, but I realized too late that I was missing an egg, so I just used four. (P.S. Prep took longer than 15 mins, bit I didn't have a mixer so I twirled my whisk between my palms and it worked just as well.) I couldn't "beat the cream cheese until smooth", until I added the eggs and milks. The extra liquid made it MUCH easier.

I baked as instructed, then let it cool, and refrigerate over night, but when I cut into it I discovered only the top had set. So I just slid the pan back in the oven on 450 (minus boiling water and other pan) and left in there for about 30 mins, let cool, and stuck it in the fridge. 5 hours later, I served it as desert and my family loved it! It turned out perfect! Thanks AllRecipes, and Jo Poynor!!
XoXo

Everyone who eats this is always impressed by how delicious it is! Make sure to soften the cream cheese for a few hours; it will mix into the rest of the liquid more easily. Beat the mix for a few minutes to make sure the cream cheese doesn't float in little chunks to the top. Also, I usually use 1-1 1/2 cups of white sugar for the topping. More is always better. An amazing, delicious recipe.

Absolutely divine.  Smoother texture than regular flan.  Perfect flavor combo.  Alternately good when caramel is omitted and topped with a dab of fresh whip cream.

We grew up eating "leche flan" growing up in the Philippines.  Since it was expensive to make, calling for a lot of eggs, it was usually made only for parties and special events.  I like flan that is dense and has a deep flavor.  At first when I read this recipe called for cream cheese, I thought, no way, it'll be too dense and would completely change the flavor of flan, but I made it, and oh man, this is even better than my childhood memories of leche flan.  Don't change a thing, please.  And it is better if left to set overnight.  I made this once for my husband's potluck at work, and they couldn't believe it was home made.  Thanks for the recipe.  It is fantastic.  I will be making 2 for the holidays.

For a cheesecake lover like me, this was HEAVEN! So rich, creamy and DELICIOUS! Definitely not the "eggy" spanish style flan you may be use to.In my opinion this is better! This should be called Cheesecake Flan. 5+ stars for sure!**NOTE: to all who are complaining that it is not a traditional flan, are you not reading the submitters note when described as a cross between flan and cheesecake??.You are making this with cream cheese..DUH!

This turned out great. As far as the sugar goes, I used over a cup. Once I flipped the flan out of the pan there was still some hardened sugar left in the pie pan so I put it on the stove with a little water, melted it again and poured over the top. My husband is cuban and a picky flan critic and he loved it, texture, color and all. Make sure not to overcook the sugar and make it too dark.

This is my favorite recipe, I have done this flan several times now and every time I get lots of compliments.   The first time I followed the recipe and even though it came out great, I’ve now modified some  things.  I use 1 cup of sugar for the caramel, and tried to heat the pan before pouring the caramel since it hardens very quickly.  Because this flan is very good, I tried to cut on the calories to not feel so guilty eating more than one serving.  As other members have done it too, last time I only used ½ of the cream cheese (low fat), used low fat evaporated milk and used only 4 eggs and it still came out great, you can't notice the difference from the original recipe.  Also, I noticed that it tastes a lot better the next day, so I try to prepare it a day in advance.

This was so incredibly easy to do and looked so pretty. I like to make my caramel in the microwave. It is easier and less messy. Put the sugar and some water in a pyrex glass (like the glass measuring cups) and heat on high until the sugar turns an amber color. It will take a while, about 10-12 minutes but it depends on the wattage of your microwave oven. When it is ready, pour it on the pan you'll use for the flan and quickly move the pan around so that it covers the bottom and sides of the pan before it hardens up. Don't worry, it will work though some of the caramel might stick to the bottom of the pan when you flip it but most will end up on the flan. I've done it a thousand times. You can also use that sugar to make decorations (like spun sugar). Drizzle some on parchment paper and let it dry. It hardens and you can use it as decorations. This flan is very creamy as stated on the recipe title so it doesn't even make sense for people to post a review stating they didn't like the flan cause it was too creamy, or not the original...etc. If you still want to try it out but think it might be too creamy for you, cut the amount of cream cheese in half like a few people have done, it will still come out and it will be delicious as well.

This is an awesome recipe! 

After I struggled with the carmelization process some others report: it cooled too fast to spread in the pan. I adjusted the carmelization process: using 1 cup of sugar mixed with 1/4 cup of water direcly in the Pyrex flan pan on the stovetop. When done, submersed in a tepid water bath to stop the cooking process. The carmel came out perfect.

Thanks, many times over, for this recipe!

This was very good! I have made it several times with many compliments. Very easy. Both times I too had a problem with the sugar syrup instantly hardening right in the center of my glass pie plate but I didn't have enough ingredients to start over so I just continued on. Once baked the sugar liquified again and it came out perfectly, it fully coated the bottom. So, no need to panic if you start with a big blob of hardened sugar in your dish, it will still turn out correctly!

I made this as per the recipe and it turned out great. We had a family dinner for Mother's Day and it was a BIG HIT. Two things I will do next time: have custard cups ready and I might try the blender trick that another reviewer mentioned (put the batter in a blender as a last step before baking). I used my stand mixer and it turned out fine, but I thought it looked a little "grainy." I don't have a 10" round dish so I used an 8" Pyrex round dish, like for apple pie, and I had batter leftover. I quickly caramelized more sugar and put it and the batter into a couple of individual pyrex custard cups and baked as recipe instructs with water in the pan (no cloth though). Those worked great too. I heated my baking dishes in the microwave before putting the sugar in since it does harden quickly. But of course, as you bake it the sugar evens out anyway. It turned out perfectly with only a coating of sugar left in the baking dish but there was plenty on the flan so I didn't care.  I served it with fresh sweetened strawberries and homemade whipped cream. Wonderful recipe! Thanks Jo!

WONDERFUL and super easy!!  However, I'm giving it only 3 stars because of the sugar situation.  I'm reading that several others had the same problem with the sugar hardening immediately and then sticking when it was inverted.  I followed the directions word for word and this still happened.  So...it tasted so good that I'm willing to give it another try.  I'm probably just going to sprinkle the pan with brown sugar and pour the filling over that.  It should work...we shall see!!!

It turned out really good but next time i'll only use 4 oz. of cream cheese.  I had to do the sugar twice to get it right because it turned rock hard but the next day it was perfect.  Actually I did'nt wait until the next day before digging in.  Very rich and creamy.

Being a hardcore flan lover, I liked the idea of a creamier flan so I tried this but with only HALF a package of cream cheese.  It turned out awesome and I love it.  I halfed the cream cheese because I wanted this to be a creamier FLAN and not a CHEESECAKE with flan flavoring.  Also, as a side note, the caramel does not have to be distributed evenly at the bottom.  Remember it gets baked for an hour so it will melt again and redistibute anyway.  Also, you can use any type of milk (whole, non-fat, 1/2 and 1/2, evaporated...).  It always turns out great but if you do decide to skip the sweetened condensed milk like I do then remember to add sugar to taste.

Very good recipe. Make sure you warm pie plate before pouring the sugar in our it will harden almost instantly.

Happy Cooking

I meant to rate this in 11/06.  I made this once b4 the holidays to see how easy it really was (and gain confidence) it was DEELISH!!! I followed the recipe exactly. Thanksgiving came around and I decided to make it for my co. annual T-giving potluck.  I added 1/4 can of pumpkin and 1 tsp of pumpkin spices W-O-W what a HIT!!! I've been invited to a Luau and I'm thinking of adding crushed pineapple (maybe puree) for a Luau type taste!  I will update.

If you want flan, stick with the traditional. Everyone who ate this was confused because you're expecting flan's silky texture, and this is a cheese-cake.
If you want cheese-cake, throw a crust on this and you're set.

Because I'm new to this baking thing, I need very specific directions to what I'm supposed to do and use.  I had no trouble creating the caramel glaze, but what I *did* have trouble with was deciphering if I was supposed to use a dish or a pan.  In my vocabulary, a dish is made of glass and a pan, metal.  I think my problem may have been that I used the dish called for in step 1, because the caramel did NOT set up at all.

I just wish I had more than five stars to choose from.  I made this for guests and it was the hit of the party!  So easy, quick, easy and one of the best things I have ever made.  You will not regret making this recipe.  I overcooked the sugar and it was at the hard thread stage but even that did not mess this up.  It still made a beautiful topping and the flavor is still being raved over.  Wonderful, wonderful.

Delicious!  The flan I normally make doesn't contain cream cheese but is very similar so I tweaked a bit.  I used Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese and covered the baking dish with aluminum foil. I also used fat free evaporated milk and 1 cup of sugar for more syrup and it came out fantastic.  The cheese actually helps balance out the sweetness and makes it extra rich and creamy.  I'm definitely making this from now on.

I made this yesterday. Easy enough to make I guess. BUT, we were very disappointed in the end result. It was more like cheesecake then custard. I was looking for a moer silky feel. I guess next time I will just do regular flan......

This is an excellent flan.  I've made this for a couple of get-togethers now and people love it and ask for the recipe.  Make it faster: after coating the dish with the carmelized sugar,  simply use your blender for a few seconds to blend the other ingredients, pour into pan, and proceed as usual. Blenderizing doesn't change the texture at all and saves time.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I've made it three times.  Once, I took it out too early (it had baked for the full 60 min, but still wiggled too much) and it never set up, but it was still a delicious custard.  I'd recommend using a touch/firmness test rather than going exclusively by the clock.  A winner!

This turned out great! It looked very professional. I did panic a bit during the first step. I did heat my dish and sprayed with PAM  prior to pouring the melted sugar in, but it didn't spread very well. I discovered that the worry was for nothing! when it bakes in the oven the sugar re melts and i turned out perfect. It seemed to cook quicker than an hour, it only seemed to take about 40 min. When I served it everyone cleaned there plates! even the person who stated that they don't like Flan!

How to keep sugar melted--Just got back from El Salvador where a cook named "Paz" showed me how to make flan. Just make the recipe as stated but place pan holding flan in a shallow pan (broiler pan for example) with water.  Doesn't have to be much--enough so the water doesn't evaporate. Paz called it a "Baño Maria".

This is the first time I made this flan and it turned out great.  First, I cooked the sugar in a saucepan and it did take a while to melt so you have to be patient.  I read some of the review and warmed my 10 in cake pan in the oven but it still didn't give me enough time to coat the entire pan.  I was a bit worried but proceeded to the next step.  I then poured the mixture to the pan and cooked as directed.  Next, I turned off the oven and left the flan sit in the oven for one hour to cool.  I left it over night in the refrigerator.  Finally, it was time to remove flan from pan.  I ran my knife around the pan and flipped it over.  I was greatly satisfied with the outcome and everyone loved it.  Like another reviewer said even people who don't like flan will appreciate it.  My whole family thought it was better than flan because it's a very creamy cheesecake texture.

This is possibly the best flan I've ever had, and it was so easy to make. You don't really need to tilt the pan to coat the sides with the caramel, as it will spread while it cooks. I can already tell I'm going to be making this frequently.

I probably wont make this again.  It was NOTHING NOTHING like flan.  It was pretty much just a flan flavored cheesecake.  It tasted fine, but not at all what I was looking for.  If your wanting actual flan than look elsewhere.  The title is all wrong....again, it is cheesecake NOT flan.

This was a great recipe! Yes, I can say this was not an authentic flan and the name should be changed to reflect that it is more of a cheesecake flan of some sort. I am a real flan lover but my husband isn't and he really liked this as a desert. When I made this Creamy Caramel Flan or should I call it Cheesy Caramel Flan, I used only the egg yolks rather than the whole egg. It came out wonderful and rich. Still a great recipe.

The flan was great!!  It was simple and felt light although cream cheese was added.  
Note: I had baked enough for 20 people. I served it after chilling it for 10hrs in the refrigerator.  It was just ok and I was not so sure if I would want to try this recipe again. However, I had left overs and when I tasted it again after allowing the flan to be in the refrigerator for 24 hours when the flavors had settled in, it was absolutely delicious. My family then loved it.  Thanks for sharing it.

I used half as much cream cheese for fear it being too much like cheese cake. It did take a little longer in my oven that what it called, but that was not a big deal. I let it rest over night and then got a lovely site as it came out perfect on the plate when it turned it over. It was a huge hit with everyone. Will make again. Just don't get in a hurry trying to get the sugar to melt. It takes a bit of time and perfection with surgar takes patients.

I really don't think it's possible to screw up this delicious flan. I agree with others....the cream cheese really makes this special. I made this for my coworkers and I can't tell you how impressed they were with the beautiful presentation of this flan as well as the taste. If you're looking for an easy to make flan that will wow your friends and family you have to try this!

I have been looking for a really good flan recipe for a long time.  One that is easy and still has that authentic taste.  This one is a little denser than what I have had in restauarants but the flavor is great.  My husband, who feels he is an expert on the subject, loves this one.

I loved this recipe.  I grew up in a border town where I'd go to Mexico often and I always loved Flan.  I was always too afraid to make it and boy am I glad I finally decided to make it.  I had never had it with the cream cheese and I'll have to admit it gives the flan a genuine flavor.  Absolutely fabulous.

Wonderful recipe! First time making it and it was great! Yes, when I made the caramel and put into pan, I had to work quickly with a spatula to spread around as much as possible because it does harden up quickly! But it's OK...when it bakes, it'll become juicy. After I flipped it out of the pan, there was still some hardened caramel in the pan, but I just stuck the pan in boiling water to remove and it worked great. I actually used a 9" pan instead of 10 (was all I had) and that worked just fine as well. It set up nice, flipped out nice and overall, looked wonderful. Everyone loved it! Will definitely make again! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for a work luncheon and everyone who tried it went back for more! I got die-hard Flan-haters to even sample, then rave :) I took the advice of another reviewer and didn't worry too much about coating the pan with the sugar mix "evenly". It turned out coated well with caramel sauce even though I missed some spots.

This was my first time ever making Flan and it turned out perfect! I read some reviews saying that their carmel hardened to quickly and they didnt get to spread around in the pan much. I warmed my pan up a little bit then pour in the carmel, but it still hardened pretty quickly. But that was ok because by the end result it was perfect. This recipe was easy to follow and I will be using it again! Everyone loved it!

fantastic! I've never been a huge fan of traditional flan, but the cream cheese in this puts it over the top.  I've already had ppl ask for the recipe. I used brown sugar, butter, and half and half for the caramel.

I'll give this recipe two stars only because it wasn't the worst thing I've ever tasted. It looked easy so I thought I'd give it a try for a small dinner party. It took me two tries to make the melted sugar layer, by finally taking the advise of another reviewer who suggested putting the baking pan in the oven for a few minutes so that the sugar doesn't harden as soon as it touches the pan. That worked much better. Then I followed the directions exactly. The next day I unmolded the flan and it looked gorgeous, but everyone who tasted it said it was too heavy or too much like cheesecake and the day after that it seemed even more thick and dense. Next time I will stick with a different recipe that is more like traditional flan, lighter and more custard like. If the name of the recipe was "Cheesecake Flan", then it would make more sense to me.

I have used this same recipe for years when I make the cream cheese version of flan. When we place the pan in water it is called baño de maria.  Ensures it stays creamy and thick! Delicious and perfect every time!

just made this for a dinner party, and everyone loved it...and as everyone else says, even those who aren't flan lovers were fans.  used 1 cup of sugar since a fair amount stays stuck to the bottom of the pan. also took the suggestion to warm the dish in the oven for a few minutes first, so the sugar doesn't harden immediately upon contact. 

not the most amazing dessert i've ever had, but effort vs. result definitely warrants 5 stars.

This was extremely easy to make! I followed the directions exactly, except I used six ramekins instead of one round, and baked for about 35 minutes. The flavor is fantastic - not too eggy.

Wonderful recipe!  I made this for my husband because he was really in the mood for flan.  This recipe was very easy to make, and I plan on making again in the future.  I plan on reducing the amount of cream cheese to just 4 oz though so it doesn't taste too much like cheesecake.  :))))

This was a beautiful dessert - very impressive looking!  It came out of the pan easily and I made it the day before serving, which was convenient.  For us, it took longer to cook than the directions stated.  I should have followed the other reviewers suggestions and cut the cream cheese in 1/2.  8 oz cream cheese was a bit too much cream cheese flavor and heaviness.

This is my absolute favorite flan recipe. I followed another reviewers advice and put everything in a blender. I also make sure to warm up the pan in the oven so when I pour the melted sugar into it, the sugar doesn't immediately harden. I recommend you bake for at least 60 minutes as whenever I check after 50 minutes, the center is still a bit shaky/undone. Also, I tend to melt 1 1/4 cup sugar instead of 3/4 just because I like a lot of the carmel syrup.

This recipe is fabulous just as is. If prepared as suggested, there is NO problem with sugar, etc..
I make this in individual ramekins and reduce baking time by about 20-30 min. I then invert them (run a knife around edges to release) onto individual dessert plates and surround with fresh fruit. My guests think I have gone to so much trouble, and it is SO easy to make! Love it!!!

Awesome.  Made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  For caramel I melted in the cake pan I was baking flan in.  Just put sugar in the cake pan and melted on stovetop.  That way I didn't have to worry about transferring it.  I used 8 inch cake pan which I'm glad I did because a 10 in one would have been too thin I think.  I only used 4 oz of cream cheese so as to not get too much of a cheesecake taste.  Again, glad I made this change.  Baked for 40 min at 350 in water bath.  After taking out of oven left flan in water bath on counter for an hour then refrigerated.  Took out of fridge about 20 min before serving, and flipped onto serving plate. Awesome...see photo in my profile.  Seriously looked and tasted unbelievable.  Love this recipe....

I have made this many times for the parties and every time it was gone quickly.  The minor change I made to this recipe is to use 4 ounce cream cheese so it's not too dense.

I'm not gonna complain that this didn't taste like typical flan because I did expect something different, but I was a bit disappointed with the result. The flavours were nice but the flan was too dense for me. If it doesn't jiggle then it ain't flan! The cream cheese could be halved to help this. Also the caramel took me two attempts to get right and I normally don't have a problem making caramels.

This was a very sweet dessert that worked well with a Mexican-themed dinner. However, the some of the caramel stuck to the bottom of my pan instead of to the flan. The caramel was also really runny, but I may not have chilled it long enough (2 hours). It tasted very sweet, but was almost too rich for most people's tastes.

Got curious about this so I wanted to give this a shot since I've never tried a flan with cream cheese. I followed it exactly and the outcome was a bit strange and gave me flash backs when I made a japanese cheesecake once and turned out to be a total failure.  The creaminess? It wasn't creamy as I was hoping for; the texture was more of a wet spongy cheesecake. The only good side to this was that I tasted the actual sweet caramel flan taste that's why I rated average.

Made this flan for a picnic.  Received lots of compliment.  I baked for 55 minutes, but it may have been better if a bit shorter.  The edge came out a bit hard.  The taste and the texture were excellent.  I will make this again for sure!

For I Need Help.  The sauce needs to be warm for it to run all over the flan.  You cannot refrigerate.  It needs to be served shortly after baking.

I can't say enough about this recipe!  It was very easy to make, I didn't have any trouble caramelizing the sugar and the flan didn't stick to the pan.  It was a huge hit, so rich and creamy.  I would name it cheesecake flan because it tastes like flan with the creamyness of cheesecake.  Only tip would be to make sure to pour the filling through a sieve to catch the small pieces of cream cheese.  Also, it's a must to warm your dish/pan before pouring in the sugar.  You'll love this recipe as is!

I followed this recipe exactly but I must have done something wrong because it did not turn out for me.  It looks good but the texture is kind of grainy, without being grainy if that makes any sense -nothing like cheesecake like I expected after reading the reviews.  We didn't care for the flavor much either.  Not sure what went wrong here.  Thanks anyway.

I think just about everybody liked this one.......me too!   It really is more like cheesecake in texture than traditional flan, but it isn't nearly so 'eggy' tasting either.  YUM!

OK.......the second time I made this I just used a 3 oz. pkg of cream cheese and found the consistency to be more like a traditional flan. Tried adding a tad of water to the sugar for the carmelizing step as somebody suggested.  Can't say that it helped at all.....it had to boil off before the sugar could dissolve.  Won't do that again.

I've been on a quest to find the ultimate flan; this is probably the fifth recipe I've tried and hands down, it has the best taste, reminding me of leche flan. It's sweet and didn't taste too eggy (some taste like a dessert omelette). I expected it to be rich and creamy from the description but next time will reduce the cream cheese by half.

Great, easy recipe for my first attempt at flan.  I had no problem unmolding it by following directions I found online - remove from refrigerator 20 minutes prior to serving, run a sharp knife around the edge, invert serving platter on top of flan, then turn over.  It came out nicely.  And as the instructions said, some of the caramel is going to remain hardened in the bottom, but you still get a lot of the sauce coming out - spoon more on top of it.  The third step in this recipe should really be to start a pot of water boiling.  I ended up with all my ingredients ready to go, then had to start a pot of water.  Also, it worked just fine by putting everything into the blender.  It was smooth, creamy, and delicious!

I love this recipie! It tastes like what a friend of mine used to make that took her 4 hours!! Here's the way I did it, I heated the pan in the oven while I made the batter and after I made the batter I sat it to the side and I melted the sugar. Then while both the pan and sugar mixture was hot I poured the sugar mixture and then the batter in the pan... perfect!!!

This recipe only gets four starts from me only because of the process by which it bakes(in a roasting pan of boiling water) Otherwise it was great! I made this for a spanish class and it went over very well. It is more like a cheesecake than a flan I feel. It has a texture more suiting for most palettes. I followed the directions to a tee and it came out very well. Note: be sure you move very quickly while coating the bottom and sides of the pan with sugar.

This was a great recipe! I loved the flavor! And the egg didn't overpower the taste of the flan. It was actually a very easy recipe to follow. We were so eager to try it as soon as it came out of the oven, but we waited overnight for it to cool in the fridge. One note: I ended up putting the flan to bake more towards the higher oven rack, and when the 60 minutes were up, the flan didn't seem to have cooked thoroughly so my mother suggested we try moving it more towards the bottom of the oven. We actually "really" ended up cooking it another 60 minutes for a total of 2 hours completely. I was kind of afraid it would burn, but It did not. The results were amazing. I also did not have a round 10 inch pan available, so we ended putting the batter in a 9x13 inch glass pyrex. When we poured in the caramel it only covered the middle and it cooled to quickly before we could evenly spread it throughout the entire pan. But it actually ended up distributing evenly by itself while it baked and the whole flan was glazed at the end. So delicious! We will be making this flan forever!!!

My husband who loves flan, did NOT like the flavor of this recipe. He loves original egg flavor flan. I love cream cheese & cheesecake so, I did like it. I would RENAME it though, to Cream Cheese Flan.

Delicious! Not everyone likes the custard texture of flan. This recipe replaces it with a rich texture more similar to cheesecake. It was very easy to make, although I have to agree that it's important to warm the pan prior to pouring the sugar. I used a glass pie plate and not only did the sugar harden very quickly, it cracked my pyrex dish! It also melted the spatula. If you've never made it before, expect the sugar to get very hot! Aside from that, it was very easy to make and impressive to serve. It's also gluten free! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Wonderful idea about adding cream cheese. My family couldn't even tell that I added it! It turned out delicious. The hardest part is evenly melting the sugar. It took me 2 tries but I did it. A helpfull tip for those having trouble with the sugar would be to put the glass baking dish a in the preheating oven before you pour the sugar into it. Just be carefull though because it may be hot if you let it sit too long. Also, don't worry if there's small lumps in the melted sugar. As long as they're pretty small they shouldn't bother anything.

Wonderfully, rich and creamy!! I don't care for the "eggy" aftertaste that most flans have, this one couldn't even taste the egg. I used 4 eggs not 5 and it still held together, kept rest of recipe the same. Made one for my family and one for bridal shower and everyone just loved it. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

A wonderful flan!  It is the perfect mate for a cup of coffee or hot cocoa.   I increased the sugar to one cup and used my favorite vanilla "Watkins" double strength.  I also followed another’s advice to heat the pan first.  Eight ounces is just the right amount of cream cheese, it enhances the texture but not at all like cheese cake.  I would not recommend lessening the amount of cream cheese and increasing the amount of eggs, it's perfect as is.  I did not use the towel trick but instead rested my baking pan on tooth picks to raise it off the floor of the water bath pan.  This will be the center piece desert for my Christmas dinner.

Regarding the caramel, to me that is not enough sugar and it needs some water.  In my recipe i use 1 cup of sugar and a little bit less than 1/4 cup of water.  Stir with a wooden spoon until it's caramel consistency, can start with medium high heat but then keep it at medium.

Delicious! This is the best flan I ever tasted! My family can't get enough of it. The only thing I changed was the caramel. I use 1 cup of sugar and 4 tbsp. water.

This is an amazing recipe!  I made it last night at work when i was bored.  I took the advise of past reviews and increased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  It was the perfect amount of sauce once cooked, chilled, and flipped over, ready to serve.  That is the only thing i changed.  Do not expect a true flan texture because it is not.  It is in between and true flan and a cheesecake.  I don't like cheesecake but i LOVED this!  I tried it both warm and cold and both ways were very pleasing.  The warm was more the texture of a true flan.  This is the perfect, fast, easy, make ahead, desert for any occasion.  Give it a try, you won't be dissapointed!

I love this recipe!!  It's delicious.  I'm Puerto Rican and my family is Cuban and every time I make the recipe the flan is a hit!!!  Instead of being a traditional flan it's a "flan de queso" - cheese flan.  The only thing I alter is that I do it with about 1 cup or 1 1/4 cup of sugar and I cook the sugar on medium high without stirring it and let it become caramel.

Eh, this was ok.  Not what I was looking for.  My fiance is French and his family makes flan to die for, so I should have known with the ingredients, but thought I'd try it anyway.  I had a problem with the sugar, someone should tell you the sugar is supposed to get clumpy before it gets liquidy.  Threw the first batch out because I thought something was wrong.  Then the second batch did the same thing.  My caramel also turned very hard and cracked when I put it in the pan.  After chilling some of it became a liquid, but there was a good amount left hard and stuck to the pan leaving me with not enough caramel.  Maybe I cooked it to long or not long enough.  There is a real science to melting sugar and making any kind of candy.  I also thoight there was way too much vanilla and could use a little lemon zest to cut the sweetness.  I'll keep looking for a more authenic recipe for flan, one with a very smooth texture.

This turned out fantastic.  I added about 1/4 cup water to the sugar to help carmalize, which took about 10-15 minutes.  Do not stir the sugar, instead swirling the pan using the handle.  Make sure the sugar has clarified (occasionally remove pan from burner) before allowing sugar mixture to boil(stop when deep amber color is reached). After allowing 24 hours to set, it came out perfectly to rave reviews.

Oh My Goodness!!! I made two of these for a potluck and YUM!  Everyone raved about how beautiful it was, and how good it was!  My only problem when making them---I made one Tues night, and one Wed night.  When I melted the sugar, it took forever (30 min??) to turn 'golden' and never did turn into a liquid.  I finally just dumped it in the pie plate and finished the recipe.  It still tasted great, but the caramel topping was a much lighter color.  The 2nd night when I made the 2nd one, the sugar melted in 5-10 min, to a liquid, like it was supposed to...Strange. The only thing I did different was that I washed the pot out with soap and hotwater first (maybe it was still a little damp when I put in the sugar, and that helped it to liquify faster?) and I also used a silicone spatula to stir instead of a spoon like the night before.  Both tasted AMAZING, just the 1st one I did had a lighter colored caramel topping, but still came out great.

This was very good, actually better than I expected.  The only problem I had is that there were a lot of bubbles on the bottom (top when inverted) around the edges of the flan.  I was hoping for an all-over creamy texture.  Anyone know why this happened?

One word - wow!  I've been looking for a recipe for flan like the one I ate down in Cabo every night of my honeymoon (at a little resort called Club Cascadas) and this is it!  Nothing like the kind made by JELLO ;-)  Only difference is they didn't use the melted sugar type of caramel sauce, it was more of a creamy sauce that they coated the plate with before placing the flan on top.  If I can only perfect that I'll be in heaven!!!
I will take other reviewers suggestions, however, and either strain the mixture before adding it to the pan or put the mixture in a blender to make sure the cream cheese is fully incorporated.

My aunt (who by the way is Mexican :o)), has been making the same recipe for many, many years.  It is a family staple at all of our gatherings.  Infact if she shows up with out it, we all revolt!  LOL  Anyway, the only difference in hers is that she puts all the ingredients in the blender and puts it on high for about 30 seconds or until well blended.  Less clean up and quick too.

This made a wonderful dessert...despite the worries I had when 1) the caramel hardened in the pan prior to my being able to to coat the entire bottom, 2)I didn't think I beat the the cream cheese long enough because I had small clumps, and 3) I had difficulty filling the roasting pan without splashing a small amount of water on the flan.  Despite my fully expecting a disaster, it turned out PERFECTLY!  It is so creamy and smooth.  We loved it.

The custard was absolutely delicious.  Addictive. Unfortunately the directions for the caramel are poor, so, if you've never made a caramel topping before you might end-up ruining the dessert.  Find/follow a different recipe for the caramel topping and you'll have a fantastic flan.

Wonderful, rich flan!! Made it for my friend next door ( a traditional Latino woman who usually is teaching me how to cook ) and she loved it and asked for the recipe! That was a first. ** Do not use a 10" pan unless you want a very flat flan - I would use an 8" one next time and perhaps lengthen cook time slightly **

This is excellent. I put it in ramekins, which gave me 10 individual servings.
I made this several times and once with out the Flan sauce (melted sugar)
I served it with maple syrup drizzled over the top. Great flavor and a lot less work.
Next time fresh raspberries!!
Thank you for a great simple recipe

Wow!  It was delicious and so easy to make.  I got scared when the caramel hardened on my pan before it was fully coated... I was then concerned when I accidentally spilled a little water into the batter when I was filling the roasting pan... Regardless of my fumbling, it turned out perfect!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Crazy good!  I had some flan at a mexican restaurant the other night and it was so good that I wanted to learn to make my own.  This recipe makes an exact clone!  Rich, sweet, thick and caramelicious!  The cream cheese really adds that kick.  I will be making this MANY more times.

This flan tastes better than the flan at our local authentic Mexican restaurant.  In fact, I'm taking the recipe to the owners.  I'd never attempted to make anything like this before but it turned out just beautifully.  And was my husband ever impressed with my culinary skills!

I have had this recipie for many years!!! I am so glad many others are able to enjoy it as well. However if you want to make it a bit more lucious,  after the flan has cooled and you have inverted the flan try lightly sprinkling over it with your favorite almond liquor or orange/grand manier..   DELICIOUS!!

I love flan, and I liked this one very much.  The only problem with this one is that it is quite thick and a little more like a creamy cheese cake. The flavor was pretty good, you could taste the sweetened condensed milk though.  I think I will stick to the more standard baked custard type of recipe, those seem more light after a heavy meal of "enchaladas".

My Flan came out so perfectly. :-)
I decorated the top with some fresh berries and mint. It was a beauty and tasted awesome.
My boyfriend is a huge fan of cheesecake, and I love caramel flans. So this is basically something that makes everyone happy. Will do it again for Valentine's dinner.

I wish I could give this more than five stars! I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out perfectly! A very impressive-looking dessert. My guests had no idea I was 'such a good cook'. I'm not! But this recipe is apparently fool-proof. Delicious too! Thanks for a great recipe.

For a 1st time Flan maker the outcome was great. I improvised a bit by adding an egg and taking the sugar up to 1 cup. Patience is a must when melting sugar. You want to be careful not to let it burn. I also added just a touch more vanilla. We loved the rich creamy taste and texture.

I've never been a Flan fan ... until now!! This recipe is soooo creamy and with the carmel topping, it is simply scrumptious!!!!  I didn't add the vanilla and used regular milk instead of evaporated milk (a suggestion from someone who gave me the recipe). Never made flan before, but found this recipe fast to prepare (the carmel part the longest) and well worth the wait while it cooks and chills!!

This turned out perfect. After beating everything together, I noticed some really small lumps of cream cheese, so I poured the mixture through a wire mesh strainer into the pan. No lumps to mess up the texture! Delicious.

I followed the advice of other reviews and mixed the wet ingredients at room temp before starting on the sugar. I used a handheld mixer instead of a blender and it turned out great. I have never made caramel before so when my sugar started clumping and taking forever to melt I did freak out a little bit.  After a couple of calls to my mother, I was assured it was normal and the sugar melts soon after it starts clumping, which in this case it did.  Don't be scared to use med-med high heat otherwise you'll be stirring the sugar for 45 min just like me.  While I was making the caramel, I put my glass dish in the pre-heated oven so that when I poured the sugar it would not immediately harden.  I also put my dish in a (hot - I forgot and put cold water) water bath for even baking.  I didn't know what the recipe meant by "set" as I have never made flan so I baked it until it was firm which made the consistency closer to a cheesecake than a traditional flan which wasn't a problem because after refrigerating it, it was delicious and creamy!! Also - I added vanilla to the wet ingredients.

I am a big flan lover but a novice when it comes to cooking.  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  I took another reviewer's advice and made the caramel with 1/4 cup water and 1 cup sugar in the microwave.  I put it on high in 2 minutes increments.  I would stir it every 2 minutes.  Mine caramelized in around 5 minutes.  Also II mixed everything in the blender and strained it.  it was Sooo perfect.  Thank you

This is EXACTLY the thick flan recipe I was looking for! I had an amazing special flan dessert in a Tex-Mex restaurant called "El Jarrito" in Katy, TX. Their flan was thick, almost as thick as a cheesecake, but soft and creamy. This was over 5 years ago and I still remember how great it tasted and loved its texture. This recipe is just like what I had - I'm so glad you wrote that this flan was a cross between an egg custard and cheesecake because that's exactly what it is. Thank you, Jo, posting this recipe - it's perfect!

Very good basic flan recipe. I substituted low fat evaporated milk and low fat sweetened condensed milk for the full fat versions and the flan still tasted very full bodied and rich. We couldn't tell the difference. Very tasty

This is a great recipe! The flovor is even better than yu find in Mexican restaurants. I top the flan with fresh blueberries and strawberries then I pour on the caramel. I only have a 9" pie pan so I have to make it in two batches. The two batches work out well because we eat one flan warm and let the other chill over night. It is a big hit with the husband and the kids.

I'm not quite sure how I feel about this recipe.  I've made a lot of individual creme caramels, using heavy cream, eggs and sugar, and they always turned out silky smooth.  This had a texture to it I can't quite describe; it may be that I baked it a smidge too long.  I did what a lot of other users did, used only 4 ounces cream cheese, and used my blender to mix everything together.  I let the blender run for quite a while.  The caramel set up before I could coat the bottom and sides, but I knew that it would melt in the bain marie.  I baked at 350* (convection) for exactly 50 minutes.  The custard had browned on top and there was very little movement in the center.  Had no trouble inverting the flan onto the platter, and the caramel covered it nicely.  It tasted good - if I hadn't known there was cream cheese in it, I don't think I would have noticed it, but it just had this indescribable texture.  I almost always use the convection feature on my oven because the temperature isn't calibrated quite right, but I think it was a mistake in this case.  At any rate, it was super easy to make, and I'll try it again.

I make a Dukan friendly version of this, just the base - without the caramel coating, and it turns out perfect. Instead of condensed and evaporated milk, I use 5.5 cups (50 fluid ounce? almost 2 liters) of skimmed milk and 1.5 cups of sweetener, and I let the mixture steam over low heat until the liqid is halved, for almost an hour.  For the rest I follow the recipe exactly.

great recipe! i would definitely at least double the sugar. one thing u can do is to make more sauce after it is finished since most of it sticks to the bottom of the pan when done cooking.

Easy.  Everyone at work loved it.  I did follow a reviewers suggestion, I cut the cream cheese to only 1/2 the package.  Will make again.

Great recipe! Although don't use a plastic spoon when making the caramel (duh!). On my second try I used a wooden spoon...it kinda burnt the spoon and the burn gave the caramel an almost alcoholic flavor. Other than that, everything set up perfectly!

This was easy to make and very good even though I forgot the vanilla!  Aside from that I follwed this recipe 100%.  Don't fret about the carmel hardening so quickly after pouring in the  pan because it liquifies as the flan sets up inthe refriderator. I had never made a recipe like this before.  My husband and I both loved it!  Will surely make it again.

I am not a fan of flan, but this recipe was so easy to make and all my friends and family loved it.  Heating the pie plate in the oven worked well to help spread the caramel on the bottom and sides of the pan.

This was REALLY creamy and smooth and absolutely perfect, AND it was the first time I've ever made flan, so I'm pretty happy.  The sugar took forever to melt down.  I think I was stirring it too much because once I left it alone for about a minute, it finally started to melt.  So don't be afraid to turn the heat up a little if nothing is happening, and let it melt a little before you stir it.

This was a little like a crustless flan-cheesecake.  I have flan all the time in Mexican restaurants, and I always enjoy it, so when I made this flan, even though it was really yummy, I was a little disappointed because I like the original so much.

First, this is not traditional flan, and doesn't taste like it at all.  It's definitely much thicker and creamier, but maybe you'll like it that way.

For a Mexican-themed party, I made 3 versions of flan: the traditional recipe I grew up with in Mexico, a traditional choco-flan recipe, and this recipe. The first was the biggest hit, and the other two were barely eaten.

Again, this is very thick and cheesecakish, and though some might like it, I found myself wanting it to be EITHER a real cheesecake or a real flan. Not a fan of the in-between.

Made this in my pressure cooker and it turned out beautifully.  Put mixture in springform and covered tightly with foil.  Placed in cooker on rack and added 2 cups of water to base of cooker.  Brought to boil, put cooker lid on and brought to pressure.  Once at pressure started timing for 10 minutes.  At end of time, took cooker off heat and let pressure reduce naturally.  Removed from cooker and put on wire rack to cool one hour, then refrigerated.  Also have made successfully using aluminum cupcake liners inside baking pan placed in cooker.

I love this recipe! I have made this flan numerous times and it has always been a hit. To make things lighter, I use 1/3 less fat cream cheese and fat free condensed milk. Also! I had a slight pinch of cinnamon... yum!

I just made this flan for a Mexican themed party and it turned out great!  I had never made flan before so I was very relieved that this turned out so well.  I used scalded whole milk instead of evaporated.  I also used 3 yolks, and 3 whole eggs.  Everyone liked it, even people who said they didn't like flan.

Good, but it was difficult to get the sugar caramelized.  It also turned out a little dry.  I have a feeling the results were because of me, though.

Yet another delicious recipe at allrecipes.com.  This was the first flan I made and have used this particular recipes several times.  This is definitely just as good as the flan you get at a restaurant.  It's moderately easy, a little tricky if you've never made flan before, you just have to pay attention though.  Thank you much for the recipe!

This is an easy recipe which can be made the day ahead.  I made it in 8 ramekin dishes which I greased first.  The second time I made this recipe, I added a bit of butter to the sugar which seemed to speed up the melting process with no adverse effects.  Very delicious and rich dessert which was enjoyed by all.

This was my first flan I have ever made. It was amazing! I made it for my dad on Father's Day. Our whole family loved it. It was very creamy and the caramel was lovely. When I first started making the caramel I thought it wouldn't work because it hardened so much. All my worrying was for nothing because the next day I flipped it over and it was just fine.

I'm not a big fan of flan, but love cheesecake and this sounded like a happy medium.  It is very good!  Everytime I make this, I get the same reaction from people, "I don't like flan".  Every person, but one, that has tried this, eats the entire piece and raves about how good it taste.  This is not your typical flan, that is why I like it so much, and so do my guest.  I took the advice of one other reviewer and heat my pan before putting the sugar coating, it makes it easier to spread and it doesn't harden right away.

This recipe is wonderful!  Instead of one large flan, I made several small ones in ramekins for a dinner party tomorrow night.  My husband and I just taste-tested one and neither of us can stop raving about how delicious it turned out.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! Thick and creamy with the perfect amount of caramel.The only thing I didn't do is chill it for 8 hours. I waited about 4 and it came out perfectly.

To the lady whose caramel stuck to the pan so that she had hardly any on the flan, next time use a round cake pan that has the gizmo on it you turn around to loosen/scrape the cake pan.  Most pans come this way.  Hope this helps.  Great dessert !!

To be honest I haven't tried this yet but it sounds very much like one I have made before.  I did want to give a TIP: rather than using white sugar use natural cane sugar.  By using this sugar you don't need to wait for the sugar to brown to get the coloring you need for a traditional flan.  Just cook the sugar enough for it to liquefy and poor it into your baking dish.  I hope this helps.

This recipe is perfect!  I did not change a thing about it.  If you hate the gelatin type flan and love the rich creamy type of flan... this is the recipe you are looking for!  The only thing I would reccommend is make sure the cream cheese is soft and mixes entirely with the other ingredients.  My cream cheese was not mixed thoroughly and there were a few small chunks.  Still delicious though!  Next time I will just mix long and start with very soft cream cheese.

This flan has a really good flavor but was a little to cheese cake like for me to call a flan.  I prefer the custard texture and flavor myself.  Over all though, I thought it was really good and if I were in the mood for a caramel cheesecake this is where I would come.  A note with the sugar glaze:  I have done flans with and with out that.  I prefer with.  I like the burnt sugar flavor but it also works really well with just caramel ice cream topping pored in the bottom of your pan. It is not as rich a flavor but good anyway.  If you do a flan with the ice cream topping be careful poring in the custard filling as it will stir up the caramel.

I am no baker...Never ate/made this before...loved it!!!  Its something different for dessert and came out great...heating the pan before coating with melted sugar was important for my non baking self and I also added a coffee liquor to sugar/carmel combo during reduction...great recipe and directions!

Made two my first time ever two days ago - what a hit!  I followed the suggested caramel recipe of:  1 (16oz) box brown sugar, 1 stick butter, 1 cup half and half, pinch of salt, 1 tsp. vanilla, boil 3 minutes then remove from heat - the BEST caramel I have ever tasted - I was licking the sauce pot afterwards!  Followed the recipe for the flan, however I used two deep-dish pie plates and split the caramel and the custard between both plates.  This made a thin flan, but it is so rich and creamy that it was a perfect after-dinner treat.  Easy easy easy..... and everyone who's had it has begged me to make more!

I  guess I was expecting flan.  The end result is a cheesecake. It is not like flan at all, the title is misleading.

Being no fan of the eggy-ness flan nor the denseness cheesecake, I found this recipe a great base to work well for my palet. I did make changes:  1. Put the pan in the oven while you pre-heat when melting sugar. Take it out right when your ready to pour sugar. Sugar will not harden when you do this. I use a 9 x 13 glass pyrex pan.  2. Added 7 eggs instead of 5. This gives an even balance of light texture of flan as well as richness of cheesecake. Almost like a French cheesecake texture.  3. 1c or more of sugar than 3/4c...I like lots of caramel. Also, when caramel is stuck on the bottom of pan...I heat the pan on my (FLAT RANGE) stove top  with water. The more water you use - the thinner you caramel will be and won't stiffen when it cools down.  4. 1tsp of vanilla. Everything is room temp before you start.  All my Latin friends love it this way...and request for more, more, more!

This is different than what I expected. It's dense and heavy like a cheesecake and cream burlee. I was expecting some more like a pudding. But the taste is not bad at all. I agree with some reviewers that the caramel is the most difficult thing to do in this recipe. You just need to coat the dish fast. It literally solidified within 8 sec.

Very good flan. It helps to be patient when doing the sugar. You shouldnt go over medium heat and dont stir the sugar constantly. If you wanna mix up the texture, replace the evaporated milk with whole milk......

Not a traditional flan, the texture is definitely not an eggy custard. But it is a delicious treat for sure!  My husband, always on the quest for the perfect flan, loved it even though it wasn't traditional. I did heat my pan in the oven while it was preheating to ensure the melted sugar spread evenly. I made the recipe as written and everything came out perfectly! I used a 10 inch round cake pan and it worked great.

WOW!!  I am so pleased with myself and my hubby is too!  I carefully read all the other great reviews, tips and suggestions.  It was my first time making a flan.  Without all the other advice (read: the sugar) I probably would have been frustrated and mad.  Thanks everyone.  It takes a village to nail a recipe.  I luv this website.  Ready for my second piece now.

This is the way my grandma taught me to make flan when I was kid. I do mix all of the ingredients in a blender. It is delicious just the way it is, but sometimes, for a change, I add a jar of Guava Jam or paste, and for Thanksgiving, I add a can of mashed pumpkin to the mix. The kids love it!

This was good! I followed this recipe EXACTLY (except I heated my pyrex pie plate in the oven for 5 min. so it would be warm before pouring the caramel into the pan) Worked perfectly. I was nervous because I was still making the filling and the sugar mixture started cracking in the pie plate before I was able to pour the mixture in. No worries, it melted back together in the oven!! Let cool IN the water bath - then remove, cover and put in the fridge for at least a few hours. I did mine overnight. I was so anxious to flip it over before serving... I was hoping the caramel would come out drizzly on top and it DID!! Woo hoo- great presentation. Thanks!

Very very yummy.  Didn't expect it it to be QUITE so thick; next time I'll use half a package of cream cheese.  Took another reviewer's advice and poured the caramel into a pan that had been resting in the preheated oven. Also put the mixture through a strainer before pouring into pan to get out any remaining lumps of cream cheese.

My husband made this last night.  It was wonderful.  I am not a fan of flans "eggy" texture, but this was creamy and delicious with a cheesecake flavor.  We both love cheesecake and he loves flan.  The best of both in an easy to prepare dessert.  We will definately be making this often.  Thanks for the post!

I've made this before and it's delicious.  There used to be a bakery in Hialeah that made this and it was called Cheesecake Flan.  It was very popular. I was so glad when I found the recipe, it's so easy.

This is an incredibly easy recipe to make and it turned out a hit my friend's BBQ party.I didn't bother with the towel trick and it cooked to perfection although the top cracked a little bit.This is most probably because the recipe didn't specify to cover the dish with aluminum foil like other flan recipe.So,will try to cover it next time.Great recipe ta!

This is indeed very nice. Try adding 1/2 cup of whisky, my boys love this when I add the whisky to it. To be able to get all the caramelised sugar out before you invert it, dip the bottom in hot watter for a few seconds. The caramelised sugar gets all soft and you can invert it without any problem.

This was super easy to make and so good.  The only things I changed were using 4 eggs, no towel trick, and I didn't wait 8 hours to flip it over.  After cooling it for an hour, I ran a knife around the edge, put a plate/platter on top and flipped it over.  I had absolutely no problem with the caramel.  I made it in the morning and it was ready for dinner.  YUM!

After trying 3 flan recipes that call for cream cheese, I've discovered I don't like cream cheese in flan. It makes it too heavy. I recommend using HALF the cream cheese and adding a couple of eggs.

This turned out perfectly - so creamy and light. I got rave reviews from all 10 people that had a slice. I topped each slice with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of chopped/toasted hazelnuts. I too had the problem that some of the other reviewers experienced with the sugar hardening when it hit the cool baking pan. However, I found that as long as the melted sugar covered the bottom of the pan (not the sides), as it cooked all the caramel bubbled up along the sides and it still turned out perfectly without precoating the pan. The only slight variation I made was adding about 3 times the vanilla. I will definitely make this again!

I tried this after reading all the glowing reviews - it was OK.  This is definitely a twist on the traditional flan.  Not authentic. Texture was smooth but way too thick. Too much cream cheese and ends up looking like flan but tastes  like a light cheesecake with a caramel sauce on top. The Spanish Flan from this site is definitely the authentic way to make flan and is delicious.  I'll not make this again.

Because this is a very dense flan, I added extra sugar for the caramel sauce (it could have used a little more in my opinion), so I think next time I'll use 1 1/2 Cups instead. This dessert is a cross between cheesecake and flan, and although it's not an authentic/traditional "Spanish" flan, my family and I thoroughly enjoyed it. For those of you who prefer a more silkier flan, this recipe may not be for you, but still worth the try. Overall, it's a keeper!

I love this recipe! I've made it twice with great results. The changes I made are adding a bit more vanilla and the second time I made it I accidently used  Fat Free cream cheese and had a good result, but it  wasn't quite the same. I also didn't bother with the towel; I just used a water bath. I would recommend not eating it until 24 hours later because the flavors and textures are much nicer.

Tastes just like the flan at our favorite Mexican restaurants. (Now we know their secret!) We, too, increased the amount of sugar for the caramel.  Great recipe! Will make again and again!  Thanks!

Came out great! I was a little worried when the flan didn’t drop out of the mold. After a couple good smacks it dropped and when I pulled the mold away. Well, all I can say is WOW, did I make that? It was like a work of art…. Thanks great recipe the family loved it.

WOW! This was marvelous! I like a little armaretto in mine, I may try that next time. This is very rich, I recommend eating in small doses (even though you will want a bigger serving after the first bite).

This was fantastic!  It is kind of a flan/cheesecake hybrid.  Not your traditional flan; better, in my opinion.  Don't give up with cooking the sugar, it will melt.  It was beautiful when it was turned out of the serving plate.  Thank you for this recipe.  I didn't change a thing and my husband wants me to make it for the next time we go to a gathering with his family.

Oh my God. I searched for "flans" after my granny made me her Vietnamese/French (she's Viet-French) flan. I got addicted to it, and wanted to make it on my own. She wouldn't leave me the recipe, saying it was too hard for a 13 year-old, so I found this recipe instead. It came out beautifully, and now my granny is jealous! Also, I would add extra vanilla and maybe extra milk. Topped with vanilla ice-cream, this flan is blisssssss!

Kind of a cross between flan and cheesecake. Amazingly good, and pretty easy to make. It's the closest flan recipe I've found to my absolute favorite restaurant dessert: the flan at La Calle Doce in Dallas, Texas.

A very good recipe!  I've had horrible luck with custard based desserts and I tried this one last night - it came out perfectly!

A few notes - I'd never melted sugar before and couldn't believe that a pot of just plain sugar could melt and carmelize without water or something else, but be patient, it did melt and carmelize.  I kept the baking pan warm on a back burner but the carmel still didn't coat the pan as much as I wanted, but like the other reviewers said the finished product was fine - the carmel turned into a light liquid during baking.  The taste definitely has a cheesecake flavor to it - next time I make this I think I'll try halving the cream cheese to see how that turns out.  It's very good, and looks impressive!  I'll definitely have to try making individual servings for my next dinner party.  :)

This dessert was SOOOO delicious. I'm not really a dessert eater, but I had to make it for a potluck.
While the oven was preheating, I put my pyrex glass pie pan in the oven to keep it warm. I transfered the caramel into the pan after it was warmed. That gave me enough time to coat the bottom.
Since the pan was still a bit warm, the caramel started to crack a little when I poured the water into the larger pan.
After it baked, I was REALLy worried that the caramel would be too hard & would get stuck on the pan.
After I refrigerated it, I looked under the pan & I still saw those huge cracks in the hard caramel. I was so worried that I made another dessert just in case!
But, when I actually took the flan out, it came out perfect! There was only a thin layer stuck on the pan but it didn't affect the actual dessert. Everything came out smoothly.
This flan is very creamy....so delicious & easy!

I made this for Thanksgiving at my sister's and it got raves! I just had a hard time transferring the caramel from the saucepan to my cake pan because it hardened too fast and couldn't spread up the sides of the pan.  I had to place the cake pan onto one of the burners to warm up the caramel.

This is the first recipe on the website that I did not like.  Perhaps a name like "Flan Cheesecake" would better represent it.  If you're expecting traditional flan, you will be disappointed in the texture and taste of this recipe.

WOW! I've made this twice and both times the flan was gone in 10 minutes. Nothing but rave reviews.  I did, however, use half the cream cheese.  It comes out exactly like the picture. Delish!  My latina friend uses 4 whole eggs and and 4 egg whites and 1/4 package of cream cheese.  We usually have Flan off's at the office.  There is never any left and it's a split decision.

I was looking for a creme brulee or flan recipe using whole eggs, for I had to bake for a crowd and I didn't want to end with lots of unused egg whites. I found this recipe, and I thought it would make the deal for this single occasion. But I was wrong: this is the best flan recipe I've had for years. Not only is it tasty, it's the easiest as well, and I will bake it on a regular basis. I omitted the caramel step, but sprinkled white and brown sugar on the top of the flan after refrigeration and grilled it under the oven broiler to make a mix between flan and creme brulee. Got compliments from everybody. Thanks a lot for sharing such a recipe.

ok so this recipe is not authentic spanish flan, the texture is very, very different, but this recipe holds it own, and is pretty good. If I serve this to friends/family I wont call it "flan" maybe "caramel custard cheesecake"(my mom would think I was crazy if I did call this flan), anyways, it is a nice change of pace from the original version. I might make again.  I used 1 whole cup of sugar also.

It wasn't quite the texture I was looking for - almost too firm and cakey for my taste.  Initially I thought I may have overcooked it but it was in the oven just under 50 minutes.  If I do try this again, I may strain the entire mixture before pouring it into the flan.  I remember my mom doing this with her recipe, which was much more custard-like.  However, the taste was good.

I picked this recipe for a class in school. I really like this recipe. It's probably the best flan I ever tasted. The only problem I had was melting the sugar but it just takes time. My entire class enjoyed the taste even though it was a bit heavy. Everyone should try it if you like flan!!

I am not a lover of Flan, my husband is, and he could not stop raving about this recipe nor could he stop eating it! It was easy to make, I followed the recipe to the "T" and it turned out perfect. I can't wait to make it for my in-laws. Thank you Jo Poynor.

A really good, innovative flan. Very rich and creamy, the cream cheese adds a new flair to this recipe. I did however find the melted sugar to be a challenge, but added a caramel topping on top of the melted sugar glaze.  It worked out perfectly.  Thanks. Ü

We each had a slice when it wasn't completely cooled and was very similar to a light custard. Then the next morning, my wife and I each had a refridgerated slice, and it was rich and smooth like cheesecake. Very versatile in the texture department. Thanks!

I don't think I beat the cheese mixure smooth enough because it was not creamy, more like lumpy custard.  Flavor was good but texture was a little off.

My husband has been making this flan for years for him and his family. They just love it so this is his 5 star rating. The caramel takes soooo long to make. I dread helping make it because of that. I made a suggestion to my husband that next time we try another caramel recipe.

I made this today.  Was very excited to think it would be a creamy flan.  Unfortunately, still turned out with that slick eggy texture, even with the cream cheese, I used a glass 10" pie plate and the recipe was way too much for that size pan.  I am looking for a recipe my daughter-in-laws grandmother made almost 8 years ago.  It was perfection.  Smooth, creamy, and I can still remember the wonderful rich flavor and texture that just melted in my mouth.  She had lived in Peru awhile as a missionary, and I believe the recipe might be from that area.  Alas, she is unwilling to part with her recipe, so I continue my search, and many flop recipes, as this one was.

I made this recipe with the following changes: Instead of condensed milk, I used whipping cream and instead of vanilla I used a teaspoon fresh lemon juice. On the next day, I made a lemon meringue and pour it on the cheesecake instead of a crust.This was a surprise for my son,and he loved it.

I just wanted to add something about the caramel,  If you poor it into a cold glass pan and it hardens, there is no need to panic.  All you need to do is continue with the rest of the ingredients for the flan poor it over the hard sugar/caramel then bake it in the water bath and the temp from the oven will melt the caramel and it will turn out just fine. I learned this on accident.  I did the same thing as Nicole on a different flan except I didn't start over I just went with it.  It was delicious.  As far as the flan that the caramel stayed in the pan well that might be because it wasn't caramelized enough when you pored it.  Or it just could have been a fluke. :) Happy baking everyone

So Yummy! It's consistency is more like cheesecake. Hardest part about the recipe is waiting the 8 hrs until you can eat it. Will definitely be making this again.

This flan was so creamy and delicious! I only used 150 gr of cream cheese and sieved the batter into the 10' baking pan and baked it on water bath instead of the method in the instruction.

My flan was so smooth and even tastier after sitting on the fridge for days:)

Delicious recipe. I was able to spread the carmelized sugar easily by setting the cake dish on a stove burner as I poured the mixture. Unfortunately, when I flipped the flan over half of it stuck to the cake dish and the presentation was ruined. It tasted awesome though. I had some left over filling that I put in a separate cooking dish that I sprayed with Pam cooking spray. I drizzled the carmel topping on the TOP of the cooled flan and it was delicious with a great presentation. The next time I make this dish I will do it that way.

Although this recipe was really good, we prefer a more of a custard texture.  This was almost like a cheese cake.  We did eat it all and licked our lips!!

This is a good recipe, but it assumes that everyone knows how to caramelize sugar...and the directions aren't EXACTLY correct.  When making the caramelized sugar, I add two tablespoons of water and a drop of lemon juice.   Then stir ONLY UNTIL the mixture starts to boil...after that...don't touch it.  Some processess will say that you can 'swirel' the mixture but don't.  And the temperature depends on your electric stove top...mine requires almost a Medium temperature.  I added in the zest of 3 limes...fantastic...but don't read this caramelized sugar at face value.  If you unfamiliar with the process, then look it up on the internet.  To follow these directions as written will only cause you multiple problems.  Otherwise...a tasty recipe.

This is a tasty twist to a traditional flan.  If you don't like the consistency of traditional flan, but enjoy cheesecake, this is the flan for you.  I found the carmel topping easy, but would make it after mixing the flan ingredients.  Also, making sure you have your flan pan set up in the roasting pan, and a easy pouring spout for your boiling water is a must.

I loved this flan!!! I was disappointed that only my daughter loved this, but boys are quirky anyways when it comes to sweets, so I tried to not care too much. I followed the recipe to a T, did not make any changes and the result was total yummy creamy caramel flan perfection. If you like flan, you will love this!

This flan was the BEST! You can't taste the cream cheese very much at all, which was something that I was worried about. It just adds a dense, creamy texture and cuts the "egginess" that flans sometimes have. This will now be my flan recipe! Yum!

This is my very first flan, and honestly I was not confident I was going to be able to pull it off. It seems like many people had problems with the sugar syrup. I was very patient, and took my time stirring and like Carolynweb said, it feels like its never going to happen, and all of the sudden there's your syrup.  I also took Nicole's advice and put the baking dish in the oven. As she said, the hot dish made it so easy to coat the dish completely before the sugar gets hard.  This morning I ran a knife around the edges, flipped and it came out perfect!!!! The taste and consistency is great!!!   This is a great recipe.. definitely a keeper.  The only change I made was I added more vanilla than what the recipe called for.

WOW!  This was received by family and guests with great gusto.  They loved the texture and taste.  I found it easy to make; just be prepared when your sugar has turned to liquidy golden brown.  The flan comes out very easily and makes a beautiful presentation with the caramel flowing around it.  Wonderful dessert!

Exquisite!  Looks sooo fancy once plated.  I was getting nervous with the sugar, but hung in there and soon, those "chunks" of sugar turned into a beautiful caramelized liquid.  I was prepared to work fast once it was ready to be poured into the pan, but as others noted, my anxiety was all for naught as it works out in the end.  But,there definitely should be a note in the recipe that speaks to warming the pan/dish before pouring the sugar in.  My anxiety was soon alleviated when I inverted the flan and it all came out beautifully!  I don't care that it's not the "real" thing; this is one beautiful dessert!  Thank you for allowing me to try and for sharing this beauty!

I made this and was surprised how easy it was. I was afraid to melt the sugar..but surprisingly..if you 'swirl' the sugar (not stir) it melts evenly and nicely. I left my pan to warm in the oven until ready to add the melted sugar..simple..it hardened but it 'softened' once in the oven baking with the 'custard'. I used my 'outboard mini motor' so that I would not have too much cleanup -worked like a charm! Excellent and easy recipe -has people thinking you spent more time in the kitchen than you actually did! Used the exact recipe - no 'tweaking'.

Amazing! A little denser than the flan I've had, but that may have been because I let it mix too long. As the other reviewers said, don't worry if your carmel sauce is kind of chunky in the pan- it'll smooth out when it's in the oven.

Best flan ever! I ended up making my own caramel, with just melting butter and brown sugar till smooth then adding a little bit of baking soda! I also heated up the dish before putting the caramel in it! Great recipe I plan to make it alot!

My son requested a flan, and since he also loves cheesecake I chose this over the more traditional flan. I didn't actually get to eat any of this! It was GONE! Everyone (and there were many) said it was delicious and wanted my recipe! The sugar did take too long, so I turned up the heat a little. Just remember to remove it from the heat as soon as it is golden. I warmed the glass dish in the oven as was recommended by other reviewers. It was beautiful! I didn't get a chance to take pictures. It was cut then consumed. Excellent recipe and will remain in my recipe box. Thank you to Jo Poynor for this easy, perfect recipe!

Delicious!.. I followed the recipe exactly and found this wonderful in texture and taste!  The cream cheese gives it almost a cheesecake taste while you can still taste the eggs but like traditional flan which is more eggy tasting imo!  Also note that the sugar will clump up and get crumply before it begins to melt but it should be liquid in about 3-6 min. depending on how hot your burner and pan get.  Once it's liquid and caramel in color it's ready so cooking it longer will make it too hard; pour into pan quickly because it hardens really fast being carful not to drip any on yourself like I did (ouch)...  I was able to get it spread around the bottom of the pan but there wasn't enough sauce or time to get it up the sides before it hardened.  The sauce will harden but will turn back liquid when the flan is ready!  I'm going to make this when my Latino side of the family comes over; I think they'll be impressed! :)

There has GOT to be a better way to make the caramel topping.  It took FOREVER, at over an hour and a half, I finally turned the heat up to medium.  It finally got liquidy brown, at last.  I went to pour it into my warmed 10 in pan, and it covered about 1/4 of the pan and immediately hardened.  I was unable to spread it or do anything with it.  I will try the rest of the recipe again, but I will definitely find a different method for the caramel topping.  What a waste!

Amazing. Perfect mix of custard and cheesecake. MMMM. I used brown sugar and the only way I could get a syrup was to add the tiniest bit of water. Next time I'll use amaretto!

I actually thought this was a little better than cheesecake because it's lighter and less sweet. Only half of the sugar came out for mine-the other half stuck. I cooked mine in 7 6-ounce ramekins, which made for nice individual portions. I threw everything in the blender-probably the best choice. Thanks for a nice alternative to cheesecake!

This was my first flan from scratch so I was really hopeful. The taste was great but the texture just seemed wrong to me. I did like it but will continue to look for a more velvetty/smoother texture.

This was so yummmmmmy !!! The only problem  Ihad was my caramel stuck to the bottom of the pan. I warmed my pan before hand and it still happened for some reason. I'll have to figure out a way to keep that from happening again. But other than that it was perfect. =)

Delicious! Very creamy and rich. Got raves - was the hit of the dinner party.  Very beautiful presentation.  Served with optional crushed raspberries or chocolate sauce, but neither was really needed. Will be making this again!

I made this for a get together and it turned out so good. It is very rich- even for my sweet tooth- and tastes great with coffee. My sugar also hardened while spreading it but it did melt in the oven. I even left the flan in the pan overnight and when I inverted it, the sauce still ran down the sides.

This was really good.  We did two small alterations for our taste/convenience. One, when we doubled the recipe, we did not use double the condensed milk.  we used one can condensed milk and one can whole milk (otherwise too sweet for us.)  Two, we omitted the sugar/caramel step, and instead poured a layer of prepared caramel over the top of the dish when done/cooled a bit.  This was easier for us and w/out risk of error.

Very creamy and delish! Tip: mix the eggs, cheese, milks, and vanilla in a blender -- that's much faster. Buen provecho!

This is a lovely recipe. I'm really impressed by how nice it turns out. One note of caution: Yesterday, I poured hot caramel into my (room temperature) ceramic baking dish and it cracked immediately! I would recommend heating the baking dish (a toaster oven works great) for five or ten minutes before pouring the caramel in. Also, weird twist, but rather than baking it in a deeper dish, I like to steam it in a wok. Just put it on a steamer rack and pour boiling water until it reaches halfway up the pie dish; cover and steam on medium heat for 1 hour, and voila! Maybe it won't suit you, but I like it. :)

I enjoyed reading the reviews of this recipe and decided it was exactly what I was looking for. I hosted a party for Mexican Independence Day a few days ago and needed a dessert that would serve 18. I doubled this recipe and made it in a large bundt cake pan...baked as directed, but for two hours. It was a huge hit at the party. Came out of the pan easily and looked very pretty. My husband, who does not care for flan, liked the creamy but firm texture.

This is a wonderful recipe. It turned out perfect.  It is the first time I have made flan.  Everyone loved it.  I want to thank Nicole for her suggestion on heating the baking dish for 5 minutes in the oven before adding the melted sugar.  I am sure this helped in being able to coat the dish.  Thanks for a great recipe.

this is a good recipe if you are wanting something similar to cheesecake, but it is not a traditional flan or "bolo de pudin" in portuguese.  The cream cheese is what changed the consistancy, follow this recipe without it and it will be a true flan!

This was the first time I had ever made flan - and it came out perfect! I'm glad I read a bunch of it's reviews first though, because I would have made a few mistakes otherwise...(Such as making sure that the pan was heated before pouring the melted sugar in).

I'll definitely be using this recipe again!

I would rate this 3.5 stars.

I followed the advise of other reviewers and did not use the caramel directions. Instead, I had a copy of Dec07 Gourmet which featured a Coconut Flan and used their instructions (1 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup water).

I followed the rest of recipe for the flan except substitued the vanilla extract with 3 Tbs of spiced rum.

The flan was very rich and dense, similar to a light cheese cake. I'm not sure if I would make again but everyone enjoyed it.

Strange... my flan-lovers didn't care for this as much as a traditional flan, while the flan-phobic DH raved about this being one of my best desserts ever.  

I found the texture to be a bit too firm for my taste, not really creamy at all.  I couldn't detect the cheese flavor (it was a bit too sweet for me to discern the cheese) but my kids did and liked it.  

I melted the sugar, w/o stirring, in a Calfalon fajita pan and it took FOREVER and it ended up with that slightly burned taste.  I also had the pan warm and had no trouble speading the caramel in the pan.  I needed a round cake pan and two custard cups to hold all the flan and set them on a wire rack in the water bath.

Like many others i had problems with the carmel.  I tried the heating up of the dish and this helped it not stick while i spread it.  When i flpped it half of the carmel stayed but the flan was amazing.

In response to one of the reviews... It's ok if the syrup hardens right after you pour into the dish, even if it's not spread evenly. Once you put it in the oven, it will melt evenly. Also, there is no need to chip off the hardened syrup, just soak it in hot water and it melts right off. I absolutely love this recipe and have been making it for ten years, however I only use 4 eggs and it tastes just as great!

I just learned from my neighbor that this is called Flan Napolitano and is traditionally made with manchego cheese, but I've seen many recipes using cream cheese so I guess that will do also.  I will try this again with that in mind and ask my neighbor to taste test.  My first impression was that I didn't like mixing cheesecake and flan tastes, they just don't seem to go together.

I have been making this recipe for years now and I absolutely LOVE it!!! You have to be patient with this recipe, it does take a lot of work but it really pays off! It tastes the best after you've let it cool overnight!

My brother wanted creamy flan.  He was sick of me buying them from the grocery store all the time, so I decided to make this highly rated flan.  And he loves it!!!  I too was a bit scared with the water and towel bit but everything turned out beautifully.  I took the advice of one reviewers (my heartfelt thanks) and kept my pan in the oven til I was ready with the caramel and then poured it in the warm pan.  I then put it back in the warm oven and left it there til I had the flan mixture prepped.  What a wonderful idea.  Oh, I don't know what the other's mean about it being a cheesecake or a different sweet dish and not flan... to me it's flan.  Not eggy... no hard... just rich creamy flan!  Wonderful!  Thank you for the recipe!

I made a bunch of these and brought to Mexico with me to try at a fiesta of 200 people, got RAVE reviews! It's not altogether authentic, but most of the women who tried it asked me for the recipe.
One thing I changed:  skipped the sugar for the caramel---I use Cajeta Quemada, basically a dulce de leche/caramel that you can buy premade in most grocery stores and is what my in-laws often use for regular flan. My husband can't get enough of this!

I made the original recipe and loved it, but wanted something still creamy but not as thick.  The 2nd time around, I made the recipe using 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 2 oz cream cheese, 4 egg yolks, 8 egg whites, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and the normal evap milk and sweetened cond milk.  I used by blender both times and it made a smooth flan.  My version turned out just as good as the original but not as thick, its the best flan I've ever tasted. Suggestion, try sprinkling a little bit of sweetened shredded coconut on top of the flan prior to baking - It's delish.  Let the flan refridgerate overnight.  All my friends and family love this dish!

Great recipe - very dense but delicious!

When you coat the bottom and sides of the baking dish, make sure that you tilt the dish (to spread the sugar out) quick enough as the sugar solidifies very fast.  I used about one cup of white sugar instead of 3/4 cup to yield more caramel glaze and thus a sweeter flavor in the end.

Also be careful when you invert the pan after chilling for 8 hours as it plops right out along with lots of liquified glaze!

This was very easy to make. It turned out great! Excellent taste, and it looked beautiful too! Tasted very similar to my Mexican mom's flan. I did not need to put a towel in pan. Will definitely make again! Thanks!

I've been making flan for years and I wanted to try something new. I was not too happy with this variation, my flan was dense and a bit gritty. I'll stick to my orginal recipe.

This flan is to die for!!  The recipe is easy and no-fail.  I couldn't believe how creamy it was!  It has the smoothest texture.  I couldn't stop eating it!  My husband loved it also.  If you've never liked flan, you will after you try this recipe! This is a keeper I will definitely make again!

I never liked flan before, but I made it for my in-laws when they came to visit.  My mother in law always brings flan to family parties, and she immediately asked for the recipe and declared this would replace the flan recipe she's been making for 30+ years!  The consistency is great, and the cream cheese adds richness without being as heavy as a cheesecake.  This will be on our holiday tables for years to come!

This is amazing.  It has a fantastic flavor (a total blend of cheesecake and flan) and it was one of the quickest, easiest desserts I have ever made.  Also, cheap ingredients.  Doesn't get much better than that!  My dad couldn't stop raving.

This is the best flan!  I was looking for something creamy, not jiggly like some flan that I have tried.  This is very creamy and delicious.  I add a splash of water to the sugar when melting, it makes it melt much quicker.  After trying other recipes for flan, this is definitely the best! Thanks!

I am so happy with this recipe! It was so easy... I accidentally spilled some of the water bath into the flan before baking it and it still turned out great. I made two flans: one exactly as the recipe stated, and for the second I only used 4 eggs and substituted 12 oz mixed-berry flavored cream cheese for the 8 oz. regular. Tastes exactly like the cheese flan a friend used to make in Puerto Rico. This is definitely a keeper.

The same thing that happened to FHIEDA also happened to me .. the caramel layer (which was kind of thick because it hardened so quickly!!) cracked and stayed in my 8-inch round pan, but when I shook the flan out onto a plate, a good layer of caramel-ish syrup stayed on top. It was yummy and different-tasting (a little thicker) than regular flan. I also messed up before baking it; the cream cheese became kind of piece-y because I didn't cream it well enough (used my KitchenAid mixer -- next time will mix by hand), and a bit of boiling water got into the round pan while I was pouring it into the roasting pan (next time will pour the boiling water in first before putting the round pan in), so I was convinced it was going to be a disaster.  In the end, it worked out great! My husband and the people in his office LOVED it. Thanks for the recipe!

I never had baked anything in the manner you do for this flan, so I was quite nervous.  The flan turned out just wonderful and everyone at work raved about it.  One lady even said after barely finishing one bite, "Oh you have to give me your recipe."  :)  I would definitely make it again.

This recipe was wonderful ! I ran into some troubles with the can sizes for the condensed and evaporated milk (Canadian cans are different sizes) and yet with the improvization it still turned out perfect ! I thought it was unbelievable, however my boyfriend who loves cheesecake, but hates flans/custards still didn't enjoy it... but unfortunately for him I will be making it again

I am from Puerto Rico and grew up eating flan.  We do have to kinds (vanilla flan and cheese flan).  This recipe is for cheese flan and taste exactly like the one my mom prepares.  I think this recipe is delicious and very authentic!

I LOVE flan and I love cheesecake....this recipe puts the best of both into one! Although it does not taste like the authentic flan I've had from my mexican bakery and resturant; it's still holds it's own. Even my sister who doesn't like flan was impressed by this. I will continue to make this recipe forever! Mmmm...it's that good... :)

I actually got this recipe from my sister-in-law. It's absolutely the best flan recipe out there.  It's rich and creamy.  The only thing I would suggest is to use only half the cream cheese and you will get a lighter, not so "cheesecakey" flan.  That's how I make mine and it's still comes out nice and creamy.  Try it, you'll love it!

This is absolutely delicious! I like the cream cheese in the mixture-definitely gives it a richer taste than traditional flan.

If you are looking for cheesecake, keep going, if you want flan (a sinful pleasure ) this is not it!!  I tried the recipe hoping to recreate that little dessert I save room for at my favorite mexican restaurants, and should have taken heed at the description and the need for cream cheese.  I had none of the problems with the sugar being hard or creating a creme brule crust, but the heavy texture just makes it all too sweet.

Just like the Flan at a Wonderful local Mexican restaurant. My father in law even asked for the recipe, and he never asks for ANY recipes. I also used 1 cup of sugar.

Made this as a birthday cake for a friend who can't eat wheat.  It was a big hit!  Nice and creamy and the caramel turned out perfectly...  my only problem was ending up with a bit of a "crust" on the top (which became the bottom).

HEAVEN ... PURE HEAVEN! This flan is by far the best I have ever tasted. I got RAVE reviews from everyone who tried it at a Mexican themed party I brought it to. And it was my very first flan! Simply put ... TRY IT! It is out of this world!! :) I wish I could give it 10 STARS!

It's midnight.  All the guests are gone and I sit here so proud that this recipe was the perfect end to a Mexican Fiesta for fifty people!!  I was a bit nervous when the caramel didn't "coat" the pan.  It quickly became rock hard, but when it was time to unmold the flans -out came beautiful liquid caramel!!  WOW!! I did it! Thank you!

This was my first flan, and was received very very well! I could not have been more pleased with its turnout... except I noticed that much of the caramel was left in the pan, hardened and stuck to the bottom, after the flan was chilled and inverted. That was probably my fault anyway, being a first time caramel sauce maker! But even so, it was wonderful. This flan was far better than my very first flan I had tried just nights before at our local (and usually delicious) Mexican restaurant... I can only describe what I had there as "eggy" and lumpy in texture. I thought as I ate it that I could probably do better myself, and this recipe certainly helped me achieve that!

What I produced using this recipe was smooth and velvety, creamy and delicious. I used a variety of sizes of ramakins, from a 6 inch diameter for a "multiple person" flan to about 2.5 inches in diameter for wee little personal flans (adorable). All were easy to cook in the water bath, despite the size differences, and when I unveiled them by turning over the ramakins, I was amazed at what I had made!

A truly wonderful recipe, whether "authentic" or not. I have nothing to compare it to besides my awful experience at the local restaurant, and the image I have in my mind of what it should taste like. And to me, this recipe yields a dessert which tastes like flan should taste!

This is an excellent recipe, I've had this one in my family for years, and it is always a delightful treat. But because of fat and high cholestrol I modified the recipe to, light cream cheese and instead of 5 eggs, I use three. It is just as delicious and no one has noticed the change.

My aunt (who's been to Spain) said this tasted like "authentic flan" to her!  It was delicious.  We had trouble with the caramel hardening up before it covered the entire bottom of the pan - next time I'd probably warm the pan first to keep that from happening.  Very good!

Oh, this is soooooo good.  It is not that hard to make either.  I love the "not too reach" and "not too sweet" taste. My 2-yr old son usually doesn't like sweet stuff but he loves this flan so much. He called it,"ice-cream." 
I love this recipe and I will definitely make it again.  The only thing that I am kind of worry about is the baking part.  When I bake the flan in the oven, smoke (or maybe it was steam)started coming out from one of the stove burner on the top of the oven.  Anyone out there know why?

Great, Exellent, Delicious, amazing...
This is the best flan that I have ever taste. My whole family loved it. My sister who doesn't like cooking wanted to learn how to make it. She took it to a potluck at work and everybody loved it too. Now it is one of our family's favorite desserts.

This recipe is so good. I was a little intimidated at first because I've never made anything like this but it turned out perfectly. I took it to a party and people raved. I think because it's a little more like cheesecake than a true flan. A huge hit!

I decided to add this to my Thanksgiving dinner menu. Very easy to make, and I made it the night before so I didn't have to worry about it on Turkey Day. I thought it was a little sweet though, but I loved the creamier version of the flan. My dad, on the otherhand, didn't like it. Turns out he doesn't like cream cheese. Oops.

I had a difficult time making the sugar syrup stuff.  I ended up using the sugar syrup for peanut brittle and turned this dessert into a variation of creme brulee.  It was very rich and creamy.  Even my sister-in-law, who doesn't like eggy or custardy foods, really liked it.

My husband loves caramel custard so I was a little reluctant to try this new version.  To my surprise he loved it and so did my family, who don't normally eat custard.  The cream cheese adds a whole new dimension to this claaic desert.  I will make this again, for sure.

Recipe was excellent. Because I was nervous about burning the sugar, I didn't let it get dark enough. That affected the depth of flavor, so when I make it again I will be more confident.

First of all I will start by saying that I have never ever ever rated or reviewed a recipe. After doing this recipe a few times, I finally got this recipe right, I had to write a review. I followed the recipe ingredients to the T..don’t change a thing..BUT I feel the cooking time is a bit off. This recipe call for 50 to 60 minutes. I suggest you bake it for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Believe me you will not regret it.

This recipe is amazing and simple!  For the sugar, I took others advice and put my glass pan in the oven first. This make it easy to coat the bottom of the pan.  Also I let my eggs and cream cheese get warm, helps with lumps!

I had started to write a review but it was submitted prematurely. This flan is the splitting image of the best one I have ever tasted. That was about 7 years ago and the recipe was never to be found again. I did remember the majority of the recipe, just not how many eggs. This recipe was exactly the same and gave me a measurement for eggs. It turned out exactly like how the other flan tasted! I was soooo happy! I couldn’t wait overnight to eat it so I placed it in the freezer before unmolding and just remember the sugar and added some water to the caramel to give me more sauce. The caramel sauce is my favorite part.      I usually dislike the eggy flans since most people curdle them and they are barely smooth. Flan de queso is my favorite. (I am Cuban). This is an authentic recipe!!!

Goodness, gracious ... this was so good. I used 7 eggs instead of 5 because, I thought it called for 7. It was so easy to make. 

You will eat the whole flan in one sitting. If you’re planning on losing weight, stay away from this recipe. You’ve been warned.

This recipe is DEE-LISH! I melt the sugar last after I make the custard filling so that the liquid sugar doesn’t have time to harden before it goes in the oven.  I make it in a scalloped bundt pan for a more decorative look. I also toast some flaked coconut before I start and add it to the liquid custard prior to baking, setting some aside for a garnish just before serving.  I  rim the bundt pan with a knife a couple times before flipping it over to serve, and have not had an issue with anything sticking to the pan. I double the recipe to fill the bundt pan and let it bake for about 75-90 mins. Also, I would get some of the boiling water in the roasting pan first, rim the bundt pan with the melted sugar and set in in the water, then pour the filling in which will weigh it down. Add enough water to go about 2/3 the way up the side of the bundt pan.  Haven’t had a person yet it that didn’t LOVE it!

I've made the recipe 3 times now . On the 2nd and 3rd try I decided to lighten it up a little and used only 4 eggs and 4 oz. of cream cheese.  My guests loved it. The texture was still beautiful.

Absolutely delicious. I followed ever detail of the recipe and it turned out great. You really need to follow the after baking instructions and allow an overnight cooling. Very rich. Very good. This is the flan I crave

I’ve never made or even tried flan until I made this for my sister-in-law a few days ago. She said the taste was great but perhaps it was cooked a little too long. Next time I make this, I will take it out of the oven at approximately 45 minutes.

I cooked it for an extra 22 minutes because the water bath was not at boiling temp when I put it in the oven. Haven't eaten any yet.  As I can't post with out giving it a rating I will rate it 3 stars now and adjust after I and my guests enjoy it.

I made the mistake of just mixing everything together at the same time the cream cheese was a little clumpy. Also make sure you let the Carmel harden before pouring the mix into the baking pan. But it came out delicious! Will be making again soon. Reminded me of home in Miami.

Very well received dessert. I put everything in the blender and stained after to ensure no lumps.  Very creamy texture and the inclusion of cream cheese cuts down on the usual sweetness of this dessert. With regard to the caramel, I made the custard first and let that sit while I did the caramel so there was not a chance for it to get hard.

Flan de queso mm my favorite type of flan! I admit that I used a jarred caramel sauce because I made this recipe to use it up, but I know the original would have been better! I used very high quality eggs and vanilla bean paste. My cream cheese wasn't quite soft enough so I poured it through a sieve before putting in the dish. Wonderful flan!

Good in flavor, but very much like a cheesecake.  Very dense and a small piece goes a very long way. Flan from what I've been making is definitely not similar to cheesecake.  But I suppose this recipe would suit those who dont like the taste of egg in a dessert. My family thought of this as more of a caramel flavored cheesecake, and I only added half (4oz) of the cream cheese.

This was my first attempt at making flan. I followed the recipe exactly as written and my flan came out perfect. I was nervous this morning when it came time to flip the flan onto another plate as I keep thinking that the flan was going to split or crumble into several pieces. I decided to let the mold sit in a pan of warm water for a few minuets just before flipping (like you’d do with a jello mold) It worked out wonderfully. The flan released and remained intact with all that delicious caramel sauce oozing on top. I made this as my Christmas dinner and boy was it delicious. This flan was creamy, smooth and rice. It will now be something that I will make on a regular basis.

The flan part was delicious!  Tasted just like flan I had in Ecuador. However, the sugar stayed hard so there was hardly any liquid sugar on the flan. Will try it again but change that part.

It’s tastes amazing and everyone loved it. The only problem was that it was cooked unevenly, which really bugged me. The middle cooked slower and by the time it no longer resembled pudding, the edges were very thick and eggy.

VERY good recipe! Still, it needs a few tweaks to be perfect, for my tastes. Next time, I will add 2 or 3 more eggs, to lighten the density and I will double the caramel sauce. 

A few tips, for less experienced cooks:

Mix it in the blender! Start with the eggs, blend until light and foamy. Add softened cream cheese and blend until mixed, then add the rest. 

If you're not experienced at candy making, try caramelizing the sugar with the wet method. 

Don't worry if caramel hardens, as long as you have spread it in baking dish. It re-melts, in oven. Don't overcook it, easy to do. 

Before unmolding, put baking dish in pan of hot water for a few minutes, to help soften caramel.

My entire family loved this recipe. My only suggestion would be to mix the ingredients in a blender. The first time I made it I used a mixer and it came out lumpy. The second time however, I used the blender and what a difference that made.end result was creamy and smooth.

I never written a review on a recipe before....this one deserved it!  Fabulous.  Made exactly as written.  My book club raved about how good it was and all wanted the recipe.  Sinfully yummy.  Make it!  Hint:  warm baking dish oven before pouring the melted sugar and coating.  Gives you a little more time to get the liquid distributed before it hardens.

This is a delicious flan. I would recommend to start by boiling the water first to have it ready and make sure you have a baking dish that is taller that the dish where you will put the hot water, so that if the water boils in the oven, it doesn't get into your flan.  When you make the caramel, the trick is not to let it burn and also work QUICKLY turning the dish, so that it sticks to the edges without  solidifying.  Also be careful not to burn yourself with the hot water when you take it our of the oven.  I made the recipe exactly as it was described and it was just wonderful!  It tastes like a flan with a cheesecake texture. Very yummy!

I made my caramel in the pan that I was going to bake the flan in - one less dirty dish and the caramel sticks to the pan better. Give the caramel a chance to cool off or when you pour the mixture in the pan it will make the flan have cracks in the flan. Came out super creamy and now I have to make another one as the one I made has seemed to have disappeared.  :)

I have made this many times for my fiance, since flan has been his favorite dessert ever since he had it in Mexico over a decade ago.   

I initially chose this recipe because I had never even eaten flan before (let alone made one), but I knew how to make a cheesecake so I figured I would be less likely to screw it up.   I'm glad I picked it, though, since he absolutely ADORES this recipe!  All of our friends go crazy for it, too!

Made this a few times now for pot lucks and  special occasions. It seems to be a hit with everyone. I've even had a few requests!. The only change I have made is by adding orange, lemon, or lime zest. All three flavors are delicious it's just personal preferences, vanilla is ok too.....but it's vanilla:)
A tip to avoid the melted sugar hardening quickly in the pan. Put the pan in the water bath in the oven while the oven is pre heating. Take the pan out of the oven once your melted sugar is ready and pour the melted sugar into the hot pan and set aside until you have the egg/cream/milk mixture ready.

Loved it and so did all who had some. Even those who don't really care for flan because it's too custardy. Creamy and delicious!  And don't be afraid of the caramel....it just takes being patient!
And make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature.  Otherwise you’ll have lumps.

So delicious! A lot of people complimented me on it. I followed the recipe as is, except that I used 4 eggs, and I can't say 5 would have changed anything. All my ingredients were room temperature. I used a 10 inch springform pan that I sealed with foil to prevent all the liquid from seaping through during baking.  It was a little thin though, so next time, I might use a smaller springform pan. I also put all the ingredients in my blender.. easy easy and fabulous!!

this is my same recipe. We cook it in baño maria. put the flan in an aluminum bowl, cover it with aluminum foil and place the bowl inside of a pot with boiling water about half way up the bowl. Also, if you put the ingredients in a blender, it makes the filling extra creamy. VERY good.

Yummy!  The flan I've made in the past didn't involve cream cheese, but I love the addition of it to make it creamier.  There was some of the caramel left/stuck to the bunt pan, but the flan was covered enough when I turned it out.   If you like a lot of sauce, I'd melt more sugar.

It was a total hit! My family, friends and I loved it. It's great that it only takes 5 eggs. I've seen recipes that requires almost up to 12 eggs! I will definitely do this again! It's so easy and very creamy and delicious!

I just put it in the oven. What a mess. I guess 10" baking dish does not mean a 10" pie dish; what size eggs? The caramel is so hard I'm afraid someone will break their teeth. Hope it's good.

I made this recipe and had GREAT TROUBLE with the sugar/caramel part. I saw, as I just looked through, that you have a good article on making caramel, but I was unable to copy or put those instuctions into my recipe file or to print the various ways make the caramel. Would you either e-mail the instuctions or tell me how to copy your article. Tonika. arnold6297@cox.net

Delicious.  I prefer the less eggey consistency of this flan.  I did not have any problems with the caramel.  I also sprayed PAM on my pan, which might have helped.  Either way, the caramel will breakdown in the fridge and become a sauce, so don't worry if you have problems.  I used a 9" cake pan.  Very easy to make.

So delicious! Brought it to a work potluck, and my coworkers loved it. A few mentioned that they liked it better than the traditional (read: eggy) flan. I used the ingredients as listed; even though I had read the reviews about using a blender, I thought, "Surely my trusty Kitchenaid mixer will make it smooth." Nope ... I ended up pouring it into my blender;. the cream cheese would not blend in otherwise. I realized when I was pouring the custard into my pan that it was too small, so I made one 8" and two little custard cups. I will buy a 10" round pan just to be able to make this again! A delicious and beautiful dessert.

To those who get concerned about the caramel going hard immediately after it's poured... don't worry about it. Leave it like that, pour the flan mixture and bake... the water and the heat takes care of it!

This is delicious as is. It is really creamy if you are careful not to overcook it. Mix ingredients in a blender and pour through a strainer over carmelized sugar. That will get out any cream cheese chunks you might have missed. I used light cream cheese (Neufchatel) all the time and you can't tell the difference.

The flan has a good taste but you need to double the prep time.  It took about 25 minutes for the sugar to cook and that was on medium heat.  I didn't have a 10 inch round pan so I put it in a 9-1/2 inch pie pan and it worked out fine.

Per the other reviews, the texture of this flan is much more akin to a cheesecake.  I also failed to heat the baking dish before adding the caramelized sugar, but it distributed just fine after the flan was baked.  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, and several people commented that it was reminiscent of pumpkin pie.

This flan was very simple to prepare, but it was just a little too thick for my taste.  I was wanting more of a "custard-like" consistency, but this turned out pretty solid and sticky.  It still had great flavor and since it was so easy, I'll probably make it again while I keep looking for the perfect recipe that is more like a custard-y.

My husband being from Spain and my Mother in Law a wonderful cook, I was skeptical about making this.  But WOW!!  The best compliment I can give is that I have been told by my Father in Law that it is the best he has ever had.  I work with many Cubans and they laugh at how the "Gringa" can make Flan better than any Spanish decendent they know.  Thanks!!  I make about 12 of these each holiday for family and friends.

it lived up to the description and was surprisingly easy to make. I think i would lighten up on the cream cheese just a little bit. this is a good recipe.

i followed this recipe and had no problems. my carmel sugar did harden quickly but after thinking about i realized it was going to melt in the heat of the oven and should be fine. (i did end up greasing the sides of the pan that didn't carmel with butter to make sure it wouldn't stick.) i had no problems getting it out either.

This recipe is almost identical to the flan napolitano recipe my friend from Mexico City gave me.  The only differences were that she used 5 eggs and no vanilla, so I compromised and used 5 eggs with your recipe and kept in the vanilla.  First time I did this it turned out great.  It was helpful to read the reviews regarding the sugar part, as it is a new technique for many.  The second time I made this all of my caramel didn't liquify, but I believe that was due to a) using a bundt pan with deep wells and b) making twice the amount of caramel.  I tried making more caramel because it's so delicious, and I can't seem to find any caramel recipe to make extra caramel for this flan that tastes as good. Great recipe!

The camelized sugar makes a nice presentation, but it really doesn't have any caramel flavor. If I make this again, I will make my homemade caramel sauce (carmelize sugar in water, then mix with half & half or whipping cream), and drizzle the sauce over each serving. This recipe is very easy, but I was a bit dissapointed with the result.

Exactly what I expected. I was a little nervous about flipping it over after reading some of the reviews but mine came out perfect. I just followed the directions as they are. It's like a Leche Flan but thicker but not as thick as cheesecake.  I'm not a big cheesecake fan so I was a bit nervous it would be too heavy but it's not. It's just right. I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely wonderful!!!  I took this to a family potluck today, and it was a big hit.  If you want to melt your sugar perfectly, absolutely do not stir it, that makes it carmelize -- shake it and swirl it in your pan, and it will melt like a dream.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.

This is a great recipe that I received wonderful reviews about. A few things I learned. Warm up the pan you are transfering the carmel to, don't stick your finger in the carmel you WILL get an instant blister! No matter how cool your cake plate is you HAVE to have one with raised sides otherwise you will have carmel everywhere and if you are like me and transporting it you will be wearing carmel.

This is the best dessert!  My husband loves it, and he's not a dessert person!  It's so smooth and creamy.  I had tried another flan recipe, but it turned out tasting like sweet scrambled eggs.  Eww.  This, however, tastes like the perfect caramel cheesecake.  It's phenomenal.  We will definitely be making this again in the future, as well as sharing it with our family and friends!

We've made this recipe about half a dozen times now-- following the recipe just as written-- and really enjoy it!  I do pop the pan in the oven for a minute before pouring the caramel in, just to warm it a little and buy myself some extra time to get the caramel evenly spread before it hardens.

For my first time to attempt flan, this was wonderfully easy! However, the texture is more like cheesecake (according to my husband, resident flan afficianado). Also, I think placing my dishtowels in the baking pan turned them yellow. Kinda sad about that -- I liked them (Baker beware!). Probably something a more accomplished cook would avoid. For ease and taste though, I'd definitely make this again!

Although the trick to a good flan is the pan.  If you come across something called a Caulero or small cauldrin it does the trick!!  You can melt down the sugar in the pan and then put the mixture for the flan directly into the pan.  Then put it in another pan with water almost like a double broiler.  IT's MUCH cleaner and comes out perfect!  Plus if you do 4 eggs with 4oz cream cheese with the cans of milk it's a much better balance.  Try it you'll see!!

OUTSTANDING!  The BEST I have ever made, easy quick and well worth it. People at the party who did not enjoy flan, Loved this one. The texture is the key, it was not to eggie.

YUM!  My husband finds most desserts too sweet but he loved this, and so did I.  I used 6 6 ounce ceramic cups to bake it in and it fit perfectly.  I overcooked the sugar, and it stuck in big clumps to the bottom of the cups, even though I heated them first.  No big deal-it formed a nice syrup anyway, but that did make some craters in the surface of the flan.  I'll have to read up on other reviews for suggestions about caramelizing the sugar.  This will be great to make for company, especially after a light meal, because it has some substance to it.

This is a wonderful recipe! I made a low fat version by substituting lite cream cheese, non-fat condensed milk, and low-fat evaporated milk. It still had lots of flavor and smooth texture.

I loved this, but I don't normally like the texture of flan, custard etc.  This was more "cheesecakey", therefore right up my alley.  I was worried about not being able to spread the carmelized sugar enough, but it spread out when cooked.  My guest enjoyed adding some fresh strawberries that happened to be on the table as well.

I've never had flan before, so I don't have much to compare it with.  I liked it, but our guests didn't seem very excited about it.  :(  I had a really hard time getting it out of the dish, so I put it over a pot of boiling water to loosen it up.  After a couple of tries, it finally popped out.  The middle of it caved in a bit.

I got a recipe similar to this from some Puerto Rican friends but misplaced it.  After finding this, everyone always asks for this anytime dessert is involved.  AWESOME dish and easy to make as long as you get the center settling correct.

I made some changes to this recipe and it's even better. keep the teaspoon of vanilla and the evaporated milk
I used 1 cup of white sugar.
6 egg yolks
1 can of half n half (measure from evaporated milk can, still use the evaporated milk)
I put the sugar in the baking dish and placed it on medium heat until sugar melted then I made sure to coat the sides of the dish with the caramel.
After making this, my family tells me this tastes even better than the flan from the restaurant.

I used small custard cups for this recipe and made the mistake of cooking the flan too long.  However, of the eleven individual flans I managed to cook one appropriately, yum!  I recommend if using small custard cups to cook for about 30 to 40 minutes in the water bath.

I agree with others that this is more of a hybrid of flan and cheesecake. I changed this recipe as follows: 1)Used 4 egg shaped (4x6) tin-like pans (bought it at my local Asian market) 2)Placed the tin pans directly on the stove and melted 1/4 cup sugar in each tin.  Make sure to move around the sugar while its melting.  3)Take tin off the heat when sugar is melted and lightly browned, and cool for 15 minutes.  The sugar should harden and you should hear the sugar cracking.  4)I didn't bake it, but plcaed it a large steamer on the stove for 1 hour because that's how my mom makes regular flan.  It turned out delicious and everyone liked it, but I still prefer the original.

My husband and I devoured this! I don't like flan, but made it for my husband and I actually loved this! It isn't as intimidating as it seems, just make sure you are patient with the sugar and heat it up slowly...

What a wonderful caramel flan!!! I had family over for lunch yesterday and I served them the flan for desert. In fact I was looking for a flan bresilienne recipe. So I made this flan, topped it with heavy cream and ground bresilienne nuts. Just so delicious!! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! And it does not taste like cheese at all. If you don't know, you wouldn't tell.

This was the best flan I have ever tasted, including from restaurants. The texture was rich and creamy, not too sweet and not too eggy. Everyone who has tasted it is hooked, even the ones who say they don't like flan. This is the best flan EVER!

Up until last week, I had never eaten or made a flan. I did a lot of reading on this site, other sites and took out several Mexican cooking books from the library. I was invited to a Cinco de Mayo party and was asked to bring dessert. I wanted to bring something authentic. After reading the reviews of this recipe I chose to make a trial flan from one of the books last week. It was wonderful!!! Everyone enjoyed it. So, I made another one for the party yesterday and there was not a bite left. Everyone enjoyed it so much. Since this recipe had such rave reviews I also made this recipe for dinner today. It was a disappointment after the "real" flan. I now understand why so many people said it was not a flan. It is an okay dessert, but it is not a flan and it is not a cheesecake. I have great cheesecake recipes from this site and a great flan recipe. I will not be making this again. It was just okay.

This is the first time I made flan and I think this was great. I was so nervous about the whole towel/water thing, but it turned out ok. The presentation is nice and it tastes good too. The only thing is I'm not sure if it was a little too sweet, but then again I tried it warm because I just couldn't wait. Maybe when it cools it will be a little less sweet.

This recipe was very easy to make, and absolutely marvelous. The cream cheese makes it a bit denser than normal flan, a cross between cheese cake and flan. I made it for my Supper Club and everyone loved it. They even took home leftovers.

mmMMmmm!!!! So delicious! Everyone loved it! I had a problem with the carmelized sugar hardening and sticking to the utensils and pot, but I let it soak in hot water and that loosened things up. When the flan was finished (after refrigeration) and I placed it on a serving place, there was a lot of hardened carmelized sugar in the bottom of the baking dish. ?

This is by far the best flan I have ever had! It works best if you don't stir the sugar constsantly! It's really hard not to eat the whole pan myself!:-)

This was sooooo good!! It is the easiest dessert that I have ever made next to the pre made cookie dough I can purchase from my daughter's school.  I am very glad that I read the reviews or I would have definately thrown out the sugar; just be patient it does melt and don't add water or use more than what is called for you will have plenty!!  My friends thought I was kidding when I told them I made it myself; next time I am going to try to add a little shot of flavoring like amaretto for a kick.  Thanks for making me look like a pro!

After reading all the great reviews this recipe had, i thought i give it a try and i gotta say im glad i did. At first i was a bit skeptical of the outcome because i didnt have sweet condensed milk so i had to make a substitute instead and everything turned out great. The flavor is awesome and the texture is just perfect...I will definetly be making this again and again. Thanks!

This wasn't easy- I thought it was hard!  It took me 30 minutes to get my sugar a little bit brown (clumps here and there) so I just threw the sugar in the pan.  Watch out for leaking springform pans!  It still turned out well, though the sugar was a bit lumpy on top.  The rest was smooth.  The flavor was a little eggy/evaporated milk tasting. This is my first experience with flan.  But the texture was amazing.  I will probably stick with cheesecake next time, since I like that flavor better.  But a fun recipe to try!

This was so easy to make and a total show stoper at church brunch today. I baked it in a square pyrex pan because i didnt have a round one, sliced it into squares and there you have it. I do call it a cheese cake flan though, as traditional flan doesnt have the cream cheese.

This flan was pretty good.  It was very thick as most reviews said, but still good. I think I will take the advice of others and half the amount of cheam cheese.  My brother-in-law, who is from mexico said that it was great. He said that it doesn't taste like flan from mexico, it's different but better.  He loved it!

Excellent, a friend of mine, who is from Mexico said it tasted just like what his mom used to make. Easy recipe to make. I think next time I will use at least a cup of sugar to make the caramel so it will be thicker. Thx!

My housemates didn't like it as much as the "Caramel-Glazed Flan" because it was too rich and too cheesecake-like. The baking process went smoothly though. Didn't run into any problem.

This recipe was great! I've made flan before and it was too "eggy". The cream cheese addition toned down the egg texture and made it just perfect!  I used the whole 8oz. package of cream cheese and I thought it was fine. I did use 1 cup of sugar for more topping and it was just enough.  I can't say enough good about this recipe. I will make it again!!

Let me start by saying I love to cook, but I am not a baker...I wanted to find a recipe for flan for family member's bday who likes flan but hubby hates the texture and will not eat normal flan.  This was terrific and enjoyed by all, even hubby.  Thanks for the recipe!

It came out really nice and everything, and for once I finally succeeded with making caramel! However, my entire family and my bf all thought it's way too sweet, and no one liked the cream cheese addition (I cut it by half as suggested, still shouldn't be in the recipe), along with what many reviewers mentioned the caramel being stuck to the bottom (some came out but there's still a layer)
Would try again with creme broulee instead.

I made this last night and sampled it this morning. 
This was really tasty. I love flan and this was my first attempt at making one "form scratch".
 I took the advice of another reviewer and used 4 oz of cream cheese. The texture of the custard was fine by me. The caramel did harden and was more like creme brulee. Not all of it liquified, so I found myself having to soak the ramkins to get them clean. Next time I think I will add some water while it is melting. Otherwise, this was delicious. Thank you Jo!

This is the best flan ever i loved the texture. Just make sure that you beat the cream cheese separate before adding anything else otherwise you will spoile the whole thing. another thing is the sugar can't let it get too dark because it wont be sweet.

I just made this flan and am so surprised at myself! I always thought flan was super hard to make. It tastes just like the flan we have at our Thanksgiving/Christmas get togethers, except we pay $20 a pop!

I love the thicker consistency. The only change I made was making 1 cup of caramel instead of 2. I had soo much batter, I made two small (about 8") rounds and they weren't flat. A lot of the caramel stuck to the bottom when I flipped it so I'm glad I made the extra syrup. Definitely pegged to be a family tradition! Thanks!!

Absolute heaven!  Even my spouse, who doesn't really care for the texture of flan, loved this one!  Our guests were raving how smooth and creamy this turned out.  After spending the evening with my head inflated from the compliments, I had to deflate over night and the next day email them each a link to the website.  Thank you, Jo, for a new way to gain pounds!

This recipe is very easy to make and has a delicious taste.  I use cheesecake flavored cream cheese and it tastes like a combination between flan and cheesecake. My husband can't have enough of it!

Very Good!  It was a little dense and cheesecake-like, but it could possibly be b/c I over baked it a bit, but the flan was still delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly as given, and found it quite easy to make.  Though I was a little dissapointed, it tasted just like cheesecake.  Granted a really good cheesecake, but less like flan.  If I wanted cheesecake, I could make that.

I've never made or eaten flan before, so my opinions may not be as unbiased as others, but I thought that this was marvellous. I was initially worried about how quickly the caramel hardened on the bottom of the baking dish, but it ended up coming out just fine. A perfect halfway point between custard and cheesecake.

We made this the other night, and it was a smash!  My parents came over for an impromptu dinner and we just happened to have made this earlier.  I've had flan before and to me it was very authentic.  My husband loved it too!! Thanks a lot.  We already have the ingredients to make it again.

This is a fantastic recipe.  Moderate difficulty.  Extremely pleasing to my mother-in-law, who is "the expert" on "authentic flan."  She approved of the cream cheese addition, as did my husband, who has never liked flan before, but said several times that 'this is the best thing' he's ever eaten!

Not enough burnt sugar to coat the bottum, but really neat!  It looked great.  It was a cross between a custard and a cream cheese pie!
Thanks

Not a flan fan until now!  I had problems with the caramel topping.  Threw the first one out - it hardened too fast before I could spread it.  Tried it a second time with water.  Turned out perfect!  Guests loved it!

It was good but I like more caramel topping.  Also, I think next time I'll stick with a flan that doesn't have cream cheese.  When I have flan I'm looking more for a custard.  For those who like cream cheese in their flan this is a fine recipe and worth a try.

This was very tasty but very heavy.  I thought it would be a little lighter and creamier.  It was quite dense although it had fantastic flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I made this for a family dinner, everyone commented on how delicious it was. This flan is more cheesecake texture than custard, but it is excellent.
