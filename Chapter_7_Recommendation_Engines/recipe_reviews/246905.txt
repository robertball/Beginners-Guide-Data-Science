Love!!! I’ve made this recipe three times now, as muffins. I too have decreased the sugar as noted in previous reviews. I’ve also added more walnuts and threw in some ground flax seeds as well. Once I run out of zucchini, I plan to use grated carrots! You’ll not regret giving this recipe a try!

This turned out excellent. I made one loaf and 12 muffins. The taste is very good. I did add 1/2 cup more zucchini and substituted 1/4 cup of brown sugar for 1/4 cup of white sugar

I will make this again.  I did make some changes.  I used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar as suggested in another review.  I also added 1 tsp baking powder because another recipe I have for zucchini bread has baking powder as well as soda.  I saved a little flour to dust the berries with so they wouldn't sink.  Made the recipe into large muffins and dusted with large grain sugar.  nice recipe

Made exactly as written, turned out exactly as expected. This is a definite keeper. It took less than half an hour for a whole loaf to be consumed.

My wife's diet is very restricted due to allergies, we used coconut oil, chopped almonds and Ener-g egg replacer.  This may be the richest baked item either of us has ever had.  She swears it tastes like it has chocolate in it.  We both love it.

What a great recipe!  Lot's of good and good for you ingredients.  I would add about 1/2 t. extra baking soda next time i make them.  I will be making them again- delicious, nice texture, beautiful.

I used coconut oil as per the suggestions.  It was so tasty!  My companion stated that it's amazing how you can taste all the flavours indivially.  I only made half the recipe because it's just the two of us, however it didn't last long on the counter. Should have made 2!  So good!!

This is a nice variation on the traditional zucchini bread.  I used fresh blueberries and coconut oil.  It had a nice, moist texture.

07-21-16 ~ We enjoyed this moist, flavor packed bread. I followed the recipe, only my blueberries were frozen, and I didn't thaw them before using. I baked in 6 (6"x3.5") bread pans. I kept one and gave the other five away and got great feedback from those people. I poured two pans before adding the nuts and then added the nuts to the remaining batter for the other four loaves. I thought I might hear some resistance from my coconut hating guys. Nope, not a word.......they didn't ask what the white things were and I didn't tell. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Barbara.
