This smells just like the recipe my former father-in-law used to make, except he didn't put potatoes in his. He'd simmer it down and serve it over hot buttered egg noodles. I gave it 4 stars because it was too salty for my tastes. Next time, I'm omitting the salt, as there is plenty in the onion soup mix and canned tomato sauce. I also use beef broth base, which is much lower in salt than bouillon. I don't use canned veggies, so I used fresh potatoes. Here's what I did:

3 lbs stew meat, 1 1/2 lbs potatoes, 1 chopped onion, 2 cups carrots (I love carrots), 1 8oz can tomato sauce, 1 cup water, 1 small bottle (single serving size) of Gallo Cabernet Sauvignon and enough water to make 1 cup, 4 tsp Orrington Farms Beef Broth Base & Seasoning, 1 envelope dry onion soup mix, 1 tsp dried rosemary, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp of fresh ground black pepper, 1 small can of mushrooms, drained. You can thicken it with either corn starch or flour, as directed, but other methods such as using potato flakes like Potato Buds, or pulling out some of the potatoes, mashing them, and stirring them back into the broth work equally as well. I prefer to mash up some potatoes and stir into the broth, which is why I upped the quantity of potatoes.

Have to admit to NOT being a fan of slow cooker recipes. Boy was I wrong on this one. The only changes I made were to throw in a bay leaf and leave out the canned potatoes (I didn't have any) I added additional fresh potatoes and carrots the last 90 minutes of cooking and this was delicious! Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this for our Yule celebration. VERY TASTY! The only thing I changed is I added 4 tablespoons of flour instead of cornstarch. I really did not want to go out in the blizzard to buy cornstarch. The recipe was so perfect, nothing needs to be changed. Defiantly a keeper!

I liked this recipe! Next time, I might use a little less rosemary. But all-in-all, I think this is something I will make again. I didn't use canned potatoes. I bought 2 regular potatoes and diced them into cubes. I also added an extra carrot as I felt 1 was not enough. Next time I'd like to add peas or another veggie :) Thanks, klar101!

Excellent,  this will replace our old slow cooker beef stew recipe.  My family liked the gravy as well as flavor.

This got an immediate "make this again" from the family. It is a good starter base. I used all the spices, but omitted the cornstarch. I also slow cooked it for 10 hours on low and added 8 oz mushrooms sliced.

I made a few alterations, but this recipe made a brilliant "jumping off point". I used Irish slow cook beef cut into chunks and Knorr beef stock pots instead of bouillon cubes. My alterations included: I coated the beef chunks with flour and browned them in a skillet before placing them in the slow cooker. I substituted marjoram for rosemary, and I made my own "onion soup mix" (using the Dry Onion Mix recipe found on this site but leaving out the bouillon granules). For veg, I used fresh potatoes, peeled and cut into small chunks, fresh baby mushrooms cut in half, and (because I didn't have fresh) tinned baby carrots, which I sliced and held off adding until the last hour of cooking. My very picky (very English) husband loved it.

I made a 10 person batch for a Super Bowl Party.  People raved about this stew.  I cooked it on low for 4 hours and high for 2.5 until the carrots softened.  You could taste the red wine in the background and the tender ingredients were superb in the tangy broth!

As I was cooking for 2 I halved the recipie. I first seasoned the beef covered in flour and browned for a few minutes before putting it in the slow cooker. I used regular potatoes instead if canned cut up in large chunks so they world not overcook to  mush. Along with tomato sauce I added 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce and 1 tsp hot sauce.  Also added a small bag of mixed frozen vegetables one hour before the end. It was good and will make it again

Here is the ultimate test of recipe:  was there any left?  I planned on leftovers for a few days, but the entire batch was devoured!  The wine really enhances this recipe and the use of the beef bouillon enriched the sauce.  I also used full sized carrots which are much sweeter.  This was excellent.  Thank you.

I think I found my go-to recipe for beef stew.  Everyone thought it was quite tasty and I loved the deep rich color.  For more veggies I added some broccoli and peas.

I used part of 2 different stew recipes on here.  I used raw vegetables. I am making it right now!
