Have made these using 3/4 cup whiskey, then they were simmered in the crockpot for about an hour! the additional whiskey makes a wonderful difference! They are yummy!!! It also helps to use 2 lbs. of little smokies.

I think the "kid friendly" rating shouldn't be averaged in because it pulls down the average unfairly!  Not everything needs to be for kids.  I didn't have ketchup - used what I had, which was 6 oz. of chili sauce.  This made PLENTY of sauce for a pound of lil smokies -- the full recipe would surely be enough for 4 pounds of sausages!  I love easy recipes, which this certainly is.  And tasty! Larger amount (full bottle of ketchup, more sausages) could be done in a crock pot for a crowd.

These are great little appetizers.  I use a bit more whisky and brown sugar, with the same amount of ketchup and you can taste the different flavors a bit better.

This is the only cocktail weinie recipe that I really like.  I got it about 20 years ago from (get this) "The White Trash Cookbook," which was written partly as a joke, and partly because it had some good recipes.

These were fun.  I added a bottle of beer, a splash of brandy, some maple syrup, chopped red onion, dash of Worcestershire, and some crumbled bacon.  Cooked on med-high in uncovered slow cooker for about 4 hours until mixture was thick and syrup-py!!  BIG YUM!  They went quick.  Served with homemade bread.  Had extra sauce leftover, which I froze and will use to marinate and baste some barbecued chicken!

YUM!  Of course the day that I want to make these, the store is offering rain checks for the lil smokies.  Sooo, I found Johnsonville little "brat bites".  Worked great (maybe better).  I used only a 16 oz. bottle of ketchup for 2 lbs. of the "brats" (I thought the 28 oz. to be way to much), and I used about 1/2 cup of whisky.  I also added about a tbsp of grape jelly & that seemed to take away the ketchup taste.  I will use again, thanks Linda!

Everyone enjoyed "Drunk Dogs". I agree that 1/4 cup of whiskey is better than recipe amount given. As suggested I used Jack Daniels. I tried to find little brats (my husband is a cheesehead from Wisc) but not in any stores around my home so got two pkgs of Little Smokies. Only put 1-lb in the slow cooker. Next time will do 2-lbs at outset as there is indeed enough sauce and people won't be disappointed when they go back for more and the Smokies are all gone. I've prepared other similar recipes for potlucks but didn't really care for them personally. That's why I was looking for something better when I found this one. I have to admit it, I was one of those disappointed when I went to get a few more and they were gone. But then, these are so easy to prepare I can toss everything in the slow cooker for myself anytime I want.

Wonderful sauce! I used hot dogs, smoked sausage, and little smokies. Also doubled bourbon and added cayenne. They were gone very quickly:)

I added a little more whisky and a table spoon of lime juice! I let it simmer for an 1 1/2 hrs, until the alcohol was cooked out.  Even the kids loved them!

Made this several times during the holidays using little smokies, catsup, brown sugar and good BBQ sauce.  The addition of 1/2 cup whiskey added a good "whang" that no one identified on their own.  There were lots of raised eyebrows...discussions about what kind of BBQ sauce was used...  Every time my dish came home empty!

My family loved it! I again (as always) cheated! We didn't have enough ketchup, so we used barbeque sauce as well. We used Evan Williams whiskey w/ the full amount 1st & then the next day I just added however much I felt like. We let the dogs cook for a long time in the crock pot. We used little smokies the 1st day. The 2nd day I used some little smokies, cut up smoked sausage & 4 hot dogs.

I put 1 C kethcup, 1 C BBQ sauce, 2 T whiskey and 1/4 C brown sugar in my crock pot along with 2 dozen of the cheapest wieners. I cooked on high for 1 hour and they were done. I took this to a potluck where there were lots of kids (hence the cheap wieners) and to my surprise, the adults loved it. I had several even ask for the recipe. It was so easy, the wieners stayed really moist, and you don't need other condiments (just buns) so I'm rating it 5.

I used a mixture of bbq sauce, ketchup, and whiskey for this, & didn't really measure. This is the only way I will prepare hot dogs from now on! This could be easily done in a slow cooker, just keep an eye on the liquid level if you choose to eyeball-measure. Thanks so much, this is the BEST way to eat the dreaded hot dog!

Kudos to the inventor...great for any gatherings such as the Super Bowl or just the plain old "get together". They are sure to be a hit but disappear rather quick!!

These are awesome. Our family recipe just adds 4 green onion tops chopped to the recipe & said, "The cheaper the hotdog, the better they turn out."  Kids shmids, the alcohol cooks out.  We always ate them when my parents served them at parties.  Can't remember having gotten drunk once.

These were incredible! I added just a touch of an asian 'chili with garlic' sauce, just to give it a bit of kick. Really, really yummy and so simple to make. Thanks for the recipe!

We've had this recipe in our family for years. What we do is equal amounts of ketchup or BBQ sauce, whiskey (Captain Morgan's is great, too!!!), and brown sugar. Heat over low for about 45 minutes until the sauce is THICK THICK THICK!!!! Then, add cut up dogs or cocktail franks (kielbasa, little smokies are good, too) and cook over low stirring frequently for about 2 hours. Sauce should be VERY THICK. This dish is always empty at every family gathering.

oh my gosh are these good!!!  I used a 1/4 to 1/2 cup whiskey and they went so fast.  I also put my sausage balls in the sauce.  We had some leftover bacon from breakfast and my husband wrapped the little smokies with the cooked bacon and then put it in the sauce.  Next time, I will make more bacon because YUM YUM

A great appetizer for a cocktail party! Only changes I made were to increase the whiskey and sugar. I also added some diced onion per my neighbor's suggestion though it truly didn't seem to make any difference. Great!

Way too too much ketchup!  I made this for a 2008 New Year's Party; I am glad I tasted it before I took it to the party.  I tossed this one straight down the garage disposal; a total waste of good Jack Daniels.  I will try this again, but instead of ketchup, I will try a barbecue sauce instead and twice as many wieners.

I was looking for a recipe that was close to my Mom's and this was it...I added an extra 1/2 cup of bourbon as well as 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce and let it simmer for a few hours on low.   I also HIGHLY recommend trying it with kielbasa cut into chunks....I put both  kielbasa and cocktail wieners in... It was a smashing success!

The best part was that even when the meat got low, I was able to add another package and let it simmer for an hour or so to replenish.

Quick, easy, and a great appetizer!  I put this together in a slow cooker and the wiskey cooked completely out by the time everything was good and hot.

Drunkin' hotdogs, as we call them, are a family holiday tradition.  This recipe is almost correct, but 2 tbsp of whiskey? HAHAHAHAH  We usually use at least a cup of Seagrams,  but we let it simmer for 8 hours on low in a crockpot and there is no alcohol taste left at all, only a delicious sauce.  We are going to try Bourbon this time though as we are all out of Seagrams.

3.12.18  Mixed this up, let it cook for about 15 minutes, and then tasted it.  All I could taste was sweet ketchup, so I then added more whiskey, and cooked for about another 10 minutes (also, not convinced that this needs an hour of simmering).  I don’t think 2 tablespoons of whiskey for 28 oz of ketchup will infuse any flavor at all into this. Nothing fancy here, but as modified, this was a very, very simple and quick appetizer.

I am reviewing the actual recipe as written. For me it tasted like cocktail winners bathed in ketchup.  My guests asked if I forgot to add other ingredients or if it was simply ketchup.  Highly disappointed.

Use all beef dogs.  The cheaper beef/chicken/pork mix will swell up like marshmallows and won't absorb the sauce.

They were great! I added some blackening seasoning for a little salt/smokey flavor.

double the recipe and used little beef smokies - kept warm in a crockpot for 7 hours - serve with wooden skewers - easier than tooth picks. I also added more Jack Daniels as others suggested - very good and I don't normally care for sausage.
