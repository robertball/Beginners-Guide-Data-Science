First, about the fat content-the calculation was based on 4 srvgs. When I read the nutrition info I was shocked and then did a little investigation. This is enough pork to feed 6 generously. One cup of olive oil has about 225 grams of fat! So if you use all of the dressing and serve four, the fat and calories ARE correct. That being said, no need to dump all the dressing on, DRIZZLE it as suggested  and reduce the fat and calories by a HUGE amount to about 22 grms fat per serving if you use just half the dressing.
Second, this is absolutely delicious, so fresh tasting. Thanks for posting, I have never used kale before and am glad to have found this recipe! And most of the fat is the heart healthy kind anyway!

The best pork tenderlion I've made thus far.  This recipe is great, because I've been trying to eat kale twice a week because its one of the healthiest vegetables.  I subsctituted garlic salt for about three cloves of fresh garlic and I used fresh cilantro.  I also zested one of the limes.  I whirled everything in the cuisinart.  I also seared the tenderloin before I put it in the oven.  AWESOME!  SO TENDER AND TASTY.   And for those who don't like cilantro, the lime kills the bitter cilantro taste.

I cook lowfat so I only put about 1/3 c of olive oil in the dressing.  I was only cooking for two so instead of the tenderloin I used a boneless loin chop.  The chop was only okay, but the kale was very tasty.  Next time I think I will broil the chop with the marinade.

This looks like a wonderful meal.  I do have a question for Margaret before I prepare it as I try to eat helthy.  It doesn't seem possible that one serving would have 722 calories and 61g of fat. Is this an error?  Thanks

Fantastic!!  I made 2 changes:  1st -Grilled the pork outside.  2nd - Used only 3 tsp EVOO and replaced the difference with fresh squeezed OJ.  Fantastic and MUCH healthier than written. Thanks so much for the recipe!!

I didn't make the tenderloin, but I used the sauce with the kale, and I thought it was really wonderful. The dressing was wonderfully savory and really complemented the meal.

My family loved this dish! The dressing was yummy! I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt and used a hand blender to mix the dressing. I had enough left to use as a salad dressing! Yummy!

I made this as listed except added fresh garlic to marinade. I thought it was good, but not great. Seemed to be missing something. Used dried cilantro - will use fresh next time. The kale was wonderful - my new best veggie! Thanks for sharing. Will make again, but might add something else to give it some zip!

THis is great, but it doesn't need all that olivve oil! Just give the loin a good rub down with it, and baste it with its own juices! The Kale is awesome.

I have never cooked a pork tenderloin in foil before, but I am so glad I tried it.  The pork was very tender and flavorful.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and made a couple of changes.  I browned the pork before putting it in the foil, and added some minced garlic to the dressing.  I didn't have brown rice so served the kale and pork on a bed of white rice.  The lime dressing was great on the kale and rice.  Yum.

My husband, 8 y.o. and 6 y.o. loved this recipe, and asked for seconds.  I too drizzled a small amount of the dressing on the sliced pork and kale, and reserved the rest for later.  Also,  I added some roasted shallots to the finished dish of kale.  Excellent.

Not a fan of the dressing; too much olive oil taste; sprinkled apple cider vinegar on the kale to make it edible.

This was pretty good however, being that I’ve never tasted kale before I wasn’t really impressed with it. The pork tenderloin flavoring was good even if my fiancé & myself didn’t eat the kale. Made this with OU Corn Casserole from this site along with strawberries flavored with plain yogurt, vanilla, & sugar.

The pork turned out great, but I'm not a big fan of kale which is the only reason why I didn't give it five stars.

I used the best/freshest ingredients on this recipe, and it ended up tasting like newly-mown grass clippings with fertilizer and mint.  I think this is a big waste of food.  Too much olive oil, the cilantro and lime do not go with pork, and the kale was not good steamed (plus it takes a lot longer than 20 mins).

Never tried Kale before, we enjoyed it this way.  I cut the dressing in half and it was sufficient for us.  We will have this again.

This was easy and tasty. I used 1/4 c olive oil, and 1/4 c lime juice, fresh cilantro, fresh garlic, and sea salt in the dressing. Made plenty, used about 2 Tbsp on the tenderloin. Great basic recipe, and will be in my summer rotation!

This was a great dinner! I cooked the Kale in a couple tablespoons of  grapeseed oil in a pot on medium high and added some garlic then covered.  When it was tender (about 10 minutes), I plated up the Kale and pork and drizzled the dressing as directed and paired it with a tropical quinoa (mmmm).  It was so delicious!  My loin took much longer to cook, though.  I would say about an hour and a half, actually.  I didn't have quite enough lime juice so I used a little lemon and it turned out perfect. Great healthy recipe!

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because you do not want to cook pork to 170 degrees.  155 is the chef recommendation for medium well and this is where I cooked it to.  Any further and it would have been too dry to eat.

Also, that is a lot of oil.  Next time I will cut it down by at least half (that is all I put on the dish anyways).

Otherwise...

Very good and very easy.  My husband loved this dish and my children loved the pork (the kale was a bit too green for them)!

One thing needed to make this delicious- HONEY!  The marinade seemed like it was missing something, so I drizzled some honey over the pork before baking. Then I mixed some honey in the leftover marinade to drizzle on top of the pork once it was done. Yum!!  It was a big hit.  I don't usually like kale, but I drizzled the marinade (with the honey) over top and it was really good.  Also used fresh cilantro and didnt use nearly as much olive oil as was called for- prob half or less.  Without the honey- don't know if I would have loved it. With the honey- will definitely make again!

This recipe was great!  I did have to cook the pork for double the amount of time.    In my recipe, I used 1/2 cup OJ instead of all of 1/2 cup of the olive oil and it was just a little too citrusy (??).  Next time I will use just 1/2 cup of olive oil and not add any OJ.  Also, because it was St. Patty's Day, I used Cabbage instead of Kale and it was great.    Either way - this is a recipe I will use again!  Thank you for posting it!

The pork was ok - nothing great, but the kale took forever to steam to an edible condition.  I live at an altitude of over 6000 feet, so that may have had an effect.  I will probably not bother making this one again.
