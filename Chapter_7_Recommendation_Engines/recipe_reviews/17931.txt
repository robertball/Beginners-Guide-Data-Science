I made this for my boyfriend's birthday this past weekend, and it turned out great!  The only reason I gave it four stars rather than five is that I made a few changes to the recipe that I think made it better.

Acknowledging some of the previous reviews, I increased the ingredients by half by scaling the recipe to yield 36 servings instead of 24.  With the increased amount of batter, I was able to make a layer cake.  I also used strawberry yogurt instead of sour cream and added the juice from the bags of frozen strawberries I used.  I chopped the berries rather than mashing them.  I also used about half a small bottle of strawberry extract.  The flavor was still subtle, so I'm glad I added that.  I added a little extra flour to compensate for the extra liquid.

I also used 2 parts baking soda and 1 part baking powder for a lighter texture.  Also, be sure to beat the batter well to make the cake nice and fluffy.  We used cream cheese frosting and it was great!

I went looking for a strawberry cake for my husband's birthday and found this recipe.  It looked easy and I liked the fact that it did not use gelatin or packaged cake mix.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use chopped strawberries instead of mashed and making two 9" cakes instead of a sheet cake.  It was a hit; several guests came back for seconds.  The texture was great - dense but not too rich.  And the taste of the lemon glaze was perfectly suited to the strawberry cake.  My husband has declared this cake his new favorite. Thanks!

Delicious cake - moist, fragrant, tasty, just sweet enough ( I used 3/4 cup of fine white sugar to make it.) In spite of my miscalculations (I baked it in a 7-inch springform pan, which required 15 minutes more baking time than the recipe says), the cake rose to the top of the pan and came out fine, at least I think so. I did not frost it but served each slice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and pur√©ed fresh strawberries. After refrigerating what was left, we found out that the cake was very nice when warmed up for a few second in the microwave: the fragrance of the strawberries comes out beautifully. I'll surely make it everytime strawberries are in season.

I made this for a New Year's get-together with some friends, and it was a big hit.  The coloring that turbinado sugar made it resemble something like strawberry bread.  It was very moist and not too sweet.  I wanted to make a 2 layer cake, so I applied what little geometry I remembered to see how much cake batter I would need for 2 9-inch round pans with 1.5" depth.  I added 50% to the batter ingredients and it was just about perfect.  I also wanted to use a real frosting on it, so I made the Buttercream Icing recipe from this site.  I added in approximately 1/2 cup of non-sweetened strawberry puree (a defrosted 20 oz. bag of frozen strawberries makes about 1.5 cups of puree).  That did thin the frosting up a bit, but not too much--I guess I could have added a little more confectioner's sugar to thicken it, but it was still okay for frosting the 2 layers.  All in all, I was very pleased (especially considering this was my first cake.

What a great recipe!  We made it for friends after a big dinner, and it was an immediate hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe.

We cut the sugar back to 1 cup (and could have cut it a little more).  The one thing we found was that there was not enough icing.  We doubled the recipe, and that made plenty.

Very, very disappointed in this recipe.  I chose it because I DID NOT want a strawberry cake made with white cake mix and gelatin.  I followed the directions, except for adding some chopped strawberries along with the mashed strawberries to give it more strawberry flavor.  After the 30 minutes of cooking, the whole cake was very brown but not done in the middle.  So, I had 2 choices - one, let the cake burn to get the center cooked, or take it out then and have the center not be completely cooked.  So, now that the cake has cooled, the center has dropped.  And, as you know, the cake is not more than an inch thick to begin with, so this cake will NEVER make it to the picnic I had been planning on taking it to.  I am not an amateur cook, so I know how to adjust things, but this one was a complete disaster.  If I could just frost it, then it would be fine, but the center of the cake is not even 1/2" thick.  I had decided ahead of time not to make the glaze because of reviews about it. Very sad that this did not turn out like most of the reviews had said it would.

I've made this cake 3 times.  My husband really likes this cake made with fresh strawberries.  The only problem is that the cake is somewhat dense/heavy.  Next time I make it I will try adding baking powder to see if that makes a difference.

I halved this recipe and made them into cupcakes. I also used white sugar and creamcheese frosting. They came out moist and delicious, I'll definitely make these again.

My family really liked it.  My husband is not a real big fruit desert person, but this was one he liked. I didn't double the icing this time, but I will next time.

I made a large layer cake with this recipe. I doubled it.  I spent hours scouring the internet for the best strawberry cake and settled on this one.  Made it exactly like the recipe.  Dense, dry, bready, and not very sweet or strawberry like.  I have made other natural scratch strawberry cakes, and this was not one of the better ones, in my opinion.  It would be tasty warmed up with lots of frosting.  If I made it again I would use oil instead of butter because it creates a moister crumb, and add about 1/2 cup buttermilk for moisture.

This cake was fabulous.  I must admit that I did make some changes based on previous reviews.  First of all, I used 1 cup mashed strawberries + 1 cup pureed strawberries, then added about 1/4 cup additional flour to compensate.  I couldn't find raw sugar at my store, so I used 1 cup refined sugar.  The result was a dense, but oh-so-moist cake that had plenty of great strawberry taste.  I opted to use cream cheese frosting, which was great because the cake wasn't overly sweet so the frosting complemented it instead of overpowering it.  My whole family loved it!

SUPER YUMMY!  I sifted the flour, used brown sugar instead of turbinado, 2 cups slightly sweetened strawberry puree instead of the mashed (since all I had was frozen berries), and used strawberry yogurt in place of the sour cream.  The strawberry flavor was subtle and the lemon flavor was wonderful.  Needed to bake a bit longer due to the extra liquid, but was wonderfully moist.  Could have doubled the glaze and made it a bit thicker, but it tasted divine.  I'll make this again!  Thanks!

My experience with this cake does not reflect the submitter‚Äôs description.  (I did not make the frosting)  It was not ‚Äúlight.‚Äù  It was rather tough with an odd texture, more like a muffin than that of a cake ‚Äì but not exactly like a muffin either.    It was neither ‚Äúsweet-tart‚Äù nor ‚Äúberry-infused.‚Äù  In fact, uninformed partakers would have difficulty identifying it as a strawberry cake were it not for the 1-1/2 tsp. of pure strawberry extract I added to the batter.  And it was just barely sweet, again, more suitable as a muffin (quite suitable actually) than a dessert.  It also had a brownish color, not necessarily what I‚Äôd expect for a strawberry cake.  (Dare I say it again, that it was more like that of a muffin?)  Still, it was pleasant enough.  Mild flavor, mildly sweet, but greatly improved and enhanced prepared like strawberry shortcake ‚Äì with sweetened fresh strawberries and whipped cream.

This cake was great.  It reminded me of the strawberry cakes my made for me as a child.  It was wonderful!  I used a strawberry buttercream frosting and it was delicious! Based on reviews I added some strawberry extract - 2 T -to have a stronger strawberry flavor.  I can't wait to make this at the height of berry season!

I've made this for multiple birthday parties and have received rave reviews and recipe requests!  I do puree the strawberries since my kids don't like fruit pieces.  I also  make a strawberry cream cheese frosting with extra pureed strawberries.  It has turned out perfectly every time. Awesome!

this cake is excellent.  I'd give it six stars if I could.  So happy to have a cake with real strawberries instead of a mix.  It has a wonderful *real* strawberry flavor that gets stronger the next day.  I've made it several times now, and it's always a hit.  I double the recipe and get enough batter for a bundt pan and 12 cupcakes.  I don't use the lemon frosting.  I like to make a strawberry sauce with strawberries, a little lemon juice and sugar in a food processor.  I drizzle the cake slices with the puree, some fresh sliced strawberries that have been sitting in a little sugar for a while and fresh whipped cream.  amazing!!  I like to freeze the cupcake and surprise my kids when them in their lunch boxes.  Thanks Jesse and Steve for a wonderful recipe!

I made this to bring over to a friend who just had a baby, along with a chicken dinner.  She LOVED it and asked me for the recipe.  It was very easy.  I followed one reviewer's suggestion and made extra glaze.  I made 1 1/2 times the suggested amount, and that seemed perfect.  I also made it in a 9x9 pan and it turned out great!

Delicious!  I used white sugar and made cupcakes so it would be an easier treat to bring into work.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  It came out really well and I definitely plan to make them again!

I cannot believe that I forgot to rate this cake.  It was SO incredibly good!  I made this for my son's birthday and had to use white sugar instead of raw sugar and left out the almonds.  I also chopped the strawberries instead of mashing them.  (I know, I know--rating a cake despite changing things but it was so good that I had to rate it)  The adults LOVED it.  The kids preferred the chocolate cake that I made (even the ones that typically preferred strawberry).  If you are used to the "gelatin" cakes this may not be for you, but this was definitely a keeper for us.

I made cupcakes from this recipie. I did as the other reviews suggested and used a little more strawberries, I used strawberry extract and strawberry yougurt instead of sour cream and.. they turned out to be muffins... actually fairly heavy muffins... I had to almost double the cooking time... but that could have been because i used a silicone dish.They had great flavor to them however probably will not make again and just continue my search for a great strawberry cake recipie from scratch...

Excellent! For my daughter's birthday, I doubled the recipe, used Smart Balance instead of butter. I poured two 9" springform pans to make a 2 layer cake. For "frosting", I took one container chocolate Kozy Shak real pudding, 1 can Reddi Whip real chocolate whip cream, and 2 blocks of reduced fat cream cheese, whipped, and spread.

I have to say that I agree with another posting here that it IS terribly hard to find a REAL strawberry cake recipe! This one is excellent--I could hardly quit eating it, and I don't even like strawberry cake (made it for hubby). Make it, you'll enjoy it and besides it really isn't harder than using Jello.

I don't know why I waited so long to make this cake - it's delicious! I think my pan was larger than 13x9 because the cake was rather thin, but not heavy - lovely texture. Not too sweet and the lemon glaze is just the right finishing touch.

I know I must have done something wrong. I'm just not sure what. The cake was so dense, it was absolutely ridiculous. I imagine I'll try this again using cake flour.

Awesome cake--a huge hit at my daughter's birthday party.  I used whole wheat pastry flour, a little extra mashed strawberries (~1/8 cup more) to keep it really moist, and doubled the frosting so there was enough to cover the top of the cake.  Will make again and again.

oh yeah this is GOOD!  I chopped my berries, and used regular sugar.  I didn't make the glaze as I didn't have any confectioners sugar, so instead I just pureed some strawberries with alittle sugar and spooned over each serving.

I was so happy to find a "scratch" strawberry cake recipe.  To add more strawberry flavor I added twice the amount of berries and reduced them on the stove by half.  Double the flavor without adding more wet ingredients.  I also used a cream cheese frosting since it was for a birthday, but plan on trying the suggested topping next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

The only word I can think of is: NUM!  I didn't use turbinado sugar (AKA: Sugar in the Raw), just standard granulated.  Upped the berries to 1.5 cups, pureed.  For the icing, I left out the zest and almonds. Perfect!  Not too tart / not too sweet.  *Made into 24 full size cupcakes.  18 minutes at 350.  Will definitely make again, but will try with the suggested sugar.

Fantastic cake. I subbed flax for the eggs and baked this as two 9" round cakes topped with a strawberry cream cheese icing. The cake is moist and an excellent flavor of strawberry. Will definitely make this again when strawberries are in season and I can use fresh puree instead of frozen.

This was the first cake I've ever made on my own, so I was very happy when it came out tasting great.  I added some fresh strawberries halved on top and sprinkled with almonds like the recipe said and it looked gorgeous. I baked it for my friend's birthday and since they had never seen me bake before no one believed I could bake something so good and nice looking! I also did what someone in a previous review did... some strawberries I mashed and some I just chopped up.  I love this recipe because it's tasty, impressive, and impossible to mess up!

It's a great recipe just for the icing alone!  I would reccomend dicing the stawberries instead of mashing them for more of a strawberry flavour.  Otherwise the main flavour is lemon.  A good way to use up those remaining strawberries.

This cake was wonderful -- more like strawberry bread (along the lines of banana bread when I made it). I added a different icing -- 1/2 C butter, 1/2 C pureed strawberries, 2 tbsp frozen lemonade concentrate and ~4 cups of powdered sugar. The icing sweetened it up!

i loved this cake!  i was very nervous after reading about it being dense and not a strong strawberry flavor, especially since i have only made a couple cakes from scratch.  i went for it anyway and it was a bit dense but just reminded me of the texture of carrot cake but with strawberry flavor- yum!  i did follow one alteration suggested a while back about doubling the strawberries, then i pureed them in a processor and reduced them on the stove.  i was hoping for more strawberry flavor-less liquid but since i haven't followed the original also i can't say for sure this made any difference.  i thought the flavor was delicate but delicious coming from fresh berries rather than a box or gelatin.

This cake is delicious! I am by no means a baker and it was easy for me to make and came out perfectly. It garnered many compliments. I chose not to use the almonds and baked it in two 8 inch rounds for 25 minutes. Excellent!

I was so excited to find this recipe, and I bake from scratch A LOT, but something went horribly wrong.  It was probably an excess of strawberries, because I really wanted a good strawberry flavor in this.  I took the advice of others and used two cups of berries.  The cake is really flat and very wet.  I had to use frozen berries.  Would love to try this again with the chance to adjust amounts, but am disappointed today in it.

Excellent, thanks for the recipe!  I ended up using a pound of the frozen strawberries, that I put thawed in the blender.  Increased the ingredients by 50%, and I reduced the baking soda to a 1/2 tsp and added 1 tbsp of baking powder, mixed into the flour.  It came out on the moist side, but I'll always pick that over dry!  Cream cheese frosting is good on this, too!

I'm obsessed with this cake! I'm not even a strawberry lover. But this recipe is just so fresh and simple and tasty. I like to use this recipe for cupcakes (also using Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site). I use strawberry yogurt instead of sour cream. Seriously, don't even bother with those white cake mix/strawberry jello recipes, this is THE strawberry cake recipe.

This turned out pretty well with a nice texture and not too sweet flavor. I used the ingredients as listed including the raw sugar. I followed the advice of others and used 1.5 cups of strawberries pureed in my Cuisinart. I also used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site. The results were pretty good. I was surprised at the relatively mild strawberry flavor considering the berries I used were quite flavorful. Give it a try.

I made this for my stepdad's birthday who love's anything with strawberries. There wasn't any cake left that day. I didn't have turbinado sugar, I used 3/4 cup white sugar, like one other veiwer did. I iced the cake with cream cheese frosting, and placed soem sliced strawberries on top. It was wonderful... Thank you

I was disappointed by the recipe. I made some of the modifications suggested by others (adding more strawberries for one) and though the flavor was okay (including the glaze) the cake itself was dense and more like a bar cookie. With all the modifications suggested throughout perhaps someone should just write a new recipe!

The recipe was great but I had to make a few changes... I didn't have sour cream, so I used low-fat strawberry yoghurt instead. I think this enhanced the strawberry flavour of the cake. As the yoghurt has some sugar in it, I cut the sugar requirements by half.

Wonderful cake! I've made this 2x for groups and am making it again this week for a birthday. It doesn't rise very much, at least for me, but it's very moist. My husband (not a "sweet" eater) loved it. Actually, several people have said it's their favorite.  I topped it with fresh whipped cream, strawberries, and drizzled ganache over the berries. Yum!

Yum!  This cake is delicious.  I agree with other reviewers on several points:  it is very difficult to find a real strawberry cake recipe-all include jell-0 so this was a pleasant surprise, also I agree with doing this as a layer cake, it is perfect in 2 9 inch pans.  I used a different frosting but really enjoyed the cake, it was great.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I thought this recipe was great. I changed a couple things though that I thought made a big difference. I made two layers of cake and doubled the frosting, I put one frosting layer in the middle, halved strawberries over that, and also covered the top frosting layer with halved strawberries. No nuts on top.

Great cake!  I needed a strawberry and lemon cake for a birthday and tried this one.  I used 2c reduced strawberries and a lemon filling for the middle from Martha Stewart recipes.  The cake tasted like strawberries.  I skipped the almonds and dressed up the top with strawberry halves and lemon rind.  The only negative is the cake color.  It is not "pretty" even though it is from  scratch and all fresh.  Next time I will use clear vanilla- but if anyone has ideas on how to make the cake a nicer color, please share.

This cake was good. I reduced the sugar to 1c which was certainly sweet enough. I've never cooked with turbinado sugar before and it had a raisin-y smell which I noticed with the cake, too. I don't know if this is typical for that kind of sugar or not, but I'm not sure I liked that... I would also like it to have more strawberries. Generally a good cake and it got a lot of compliments.  I did not make the frosting, instead I covered it with a Grand Marnier ganache, which paired well with the cake, I think.

This was really good! Easy to make. Only thing is that I had to cook it a little longer. Total 50mins. It came out golden brown. I think it had to do with the sugar that you use. Even the inside didn't look pink. But it was good!

Awesome cake!  The only two things I did different was to add 2 cups of mashed strawberries instead one (because of reviews that said it lacked flavor) and frosted it with the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting from this site.  It turned out very moist and flavorful.  After all the compliments I got at the dinner I will definitely be making this cake again.  Thanks for posting!

YUMMY!!! I always use to make boxed cake when I wanted strawberry cake & I was looking for a homemade cake that didn't need geletin. This was awesome!!! The only suggestion I make is I think next time I will double the amount of strawberries to add more of that flavor to the cake since you really couldn't taste it & maybe even a teaspoon or so of strawberry extract. That would bring out the strawberry flavor a little more. But other than that great recipe!!

This cake was so good. My husband and I loved it. The only thing I changed was I did not put the almonds on top.

Thanks for the great recipe!  As per other comments, I substituted part of the turbinado sugar with granulated sugar.  I also increased the amount of mashed berries to 1.5 cups.  I used frozen berries (no added sugar).  I also let it bake for an extra 15 minutes.  Perfect with cream cheese frosting and sliced berries on top!  Yum!

I just made this cake and actually, it's really good. I was surprised at the color and density -- though not as dense as a muffin as someone put -- but mine came out more like a carrot cake or apple cake. I think I was used to the white cake mixes with jello and forgot that this had real fruit mashed in it, so of course it's got those dense, fruity areas. Not a pretty cake, again because it's natural. but yummy. Will make again.
Oh, I used 1 scant cup white sugar as I had no turbinado sugar. Next time I would bake it in an 8x8 pan to get it some height.

I made the cake "as is" and put it into two 8 inch cake pans to make a double layer because my mother-in-law is allergic to processed sugar.  The cake itself is not bad, but not super either.  It is very heavy and the grainy as the sugar doesn't melt very well.  I also had the problem of the middle of the cake not cooking all the way.  I had to put it in longer and thought it was going to burn.  Suprisingly it didn't, I think the sugar makes the cake look very dark, but it is a very moist cake.  

I tried to improvise on the frosting by making a lemon juice & zest glaze. (Skipped the almonds after trying a bite, it just didn't seem to fit)

I really liked the combo of the strawberries and lemon and would have given this a higher rating if I could figure out how to A. work on getting the sugar to melt somehow so it's not so grainy and B. figure out how to lighten the cake a bit so it's not so heavy.

I do think that this could make a great tea time cake though with a little work.

This was fantastic! Moist and delicious. I used yogurt instead of sour cream, and I used a cream cheese frosting instead because I wanted to decorate it for a child's birthday but for adults I would try the lemon, it sounds wonderful.

Nice to find a recipe for strawberry cake that doesn't contain jello powder.  My strawberries had been in the fridge so were hard to mash - I diced them very finely and used about 1.5 cups.  Instead of turbinado sugar I used brown sugar and sucanat (it's made w/evaporated cane juice and is not as refined as white/brown sugars), which I find is interchangeable with turbinado and has a finer texture.  I baked the cake in a 9"square pan for 30 minutes.  The strawberry flavor is very pronounced and the glaze goes well with the cake.  Delicious.

Sorry, but I did not think much of this cake.  Was'nt very moist and didn't have much of a strawberry flavor.  Maybe if you use it in a shortcake recipe?

I totally messed up while making this cake, and it still came out fine.  Used a 9" springform pan, and added some chopped strawberries to batter to give it some texture.  Came out great.  Next time, will just drizzle some of icing over top, not too much, very lemony, but good.

Did this recipe exactly as is.  It looks like it's not enough batter for a 9x13 pan, and it barely is; the layer-cake might be a good suggestion if you want a tall cake (instead of a quite flat one).  It rose enough to be tasty and "light" though, so no complaints, just a possible "appearance" problem.  Used suggested lemon frosting, which was nice, though I forgot to mix in lemon zest and just sprinkled it on afterwards.  Reminds me of strawberry muffins!  Try it if you have a few berries to toss in.

Great strawberry taste.  I used a 7 x 11 pan and it was the perfect size.  I found the lemon icing too overpowering.  I am making again today and will put cream cheese icing instead.

This was a big hit. I doubled the icing recipe and that worked out great. I used regular sugar, and no one seemed to know that it tasted any different. I would make this again for another BBQ.

Have been making this for years and just realized that I had never rated it. What a fantastic cake! Everyone who tries it, absolutely loves it. Usually use frozen strawberries instead of fresh, bake the full recipe in a smaller pan, but it still works!

I made a double batch (I had a LOT of strawberries that needed to be used up!) I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, and I added some red (pink) food coloring to the batter to brighten it up a bit.
areas with the strawberries were a little too mushy (I did mash them, but I guess not good enough), where the rest of the cake seemed a tad on the dense side.  
Next time, I would probably use processor to destroy the strawberries, and add another half tsp of the baking soda, just to make it extra fluffy. Maybe use cake flour instead of AP.  
Great Recipe! Great taste and I would try it again.  It's definitely one of the best simple recipes out there!

Fantastic cake that is going into my cookbook.  I didn't even frost it. I topped ours with whipped cream and a strawberry/blueberry compote with lemon juice.  When that ran out we ate the cake by itself. I think it would be delicious in a trifle with a layer of meringue.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I really wanted a strawberry cake, but I'm vegetarian, and most of the recipes I saw called for gelatin. I was so happy when I found this! I used more like 1.5c strawberries and plain yogurt instead of sour cream, just because that's what I had on hand. Came out delicious, with an excellent consistency. I teach cake decorating, and every one of my students and coworkers who tried it asked for the recipe!

Delicious cake! I made this for my Dad's 60th birthday and it was a hit! I used the raw sugar but I was concerned the stuff I had was too coarse so I put it in my food processor to make it finer. I also pureed the strawberries instead of mashing them. My Mom said it was one of the best cakes she's ever had, and she always cooks from scratch. Definitely recommended.

This was my first ever made from scratch cake and I have to admit I was skeptical. I made a few changes like the others mentioned. Instead of sour cream I used strawberry yogurt (yoplait one reg size container) I added a tsp of baking powder and 1 tablespoon of strawberry extract. Other than those few items I kept the recipe as is. It turned out wonderfully.

The cake tasted great!! I used raspberries instead of strawberries, because that's what my friend likes and that's what we have in season. I also used soy free, dairy free "butter" and regular sugar. I didn't add that sour cream, because my son can't have dairy and tried a little banana as sub., but I think that may have caused that cupcakes not to raise. I think next time I might try a little vinegar. The height of the cupcakes were the only disappointment. The taste was amazing!!!!!!!!!  I used a cool whip frosting with fresh berries on top. They were a huge hit at our party. I plan to make these again this weekend for my son's first birthday!

This is really delicious, and to think I was actually contemplating buying a "strawberry" cake mix, because I wanted to make cupcakes for Valentine's day.  These actually would also be great just served as muffins I think, but I did mine with (pink!) cream cheese frosting and V-day sprinkles.  I'll be tempted to make this cake from now on every time I see strawberries in the store...  thanks!

I have to agree with the rest of the reviewers... it is difficult to get a good Strawberry cake from scratch recipe and boy i was glad i found this one. I wanted to bake a strawberry cake for my husbands birthday and thanks to ur recipe i made a wonderful cake. Except for the color of the cake everything else was perfect. Instead of the turbinado sugar, i used regular sugar... Not sure if thats why the cake looked a bit purplish in color... Please let me know how i can get that pinkish shade for my cake... Other than that the cake was really good... Every one loved it.

I'm just not loving the texture.  The amount of strawberries made the texture much different than your standard cake.  I tried using strawberry yogurt instead of sour cream.  But, I think this made the cake too sweet.  If I had to repeat, I think I would stick to the original recipe using sour cream.

I'm sure this cake would've tasted fantastic if made by someone else.  I tried...pitifully, and it came out tasting mediocre, which says a LOT about the recipe itself when put into my hands.  Let's see...I forgot to add flour so I pulled the cake out of the oven and added flour, mixing it together in the pan, then stuck it back in.  That was about 10 minutes after it had already started baking.  Strike one.  I defrosted strawberries I found in the back of the freezer and used those when I realized I was out of real ones.  They were a few years old.  Strike two.  Then I used granulated sugar for the icing.  I eyeballed the amount I used.  Strike three.
Based on other reviews, I can tell that this is a good recipe.  Maybe I'll get my mom to make it next time.  My version tastes very good mashed with ice cream though, it masks the metallic flavor that somehow worked its way into the cake. Hm.

Don't worry, I'll post a decent review once I figure out this baking stuff.

This cake was pretty yummy. The cake itself didn't have as much strawberry flavor as I would have liked but maybe it has something to do with me using brown sugar (I don't know that is just what I had on hand). I made 2 9 inch round cakes and layered them. I put sliced strawberries in the middle of the layers and used cream cheese frosting. My family loved it.

Thank you so much for this recipe. I made this for my daughters birthday. I made to 9 inch round cakes. Then made fresh whipping cream (sweeten with icing sugar) with food colouring to make pink and put between layers with fresh strawberries. Then iced the cake with whipping cream and decorated with sliced strawberries drizzled with chocolate. It was a big hit.

I followed the cake portion of this recipe exactly and adding a creamier frosting.  It didn't last the evening! It has such a fresh taste, not to sweet, and very moist.  This is an absolute winner and a keeper!

This cake is amazing!! I was happy that it did not require a mix or gelatin! The mashed strawberries really made the cake, as well as the sweet icing. I made this cake for a large party and won the cake-off! This is a keeper :)

For my birthday, I was craving strawberry cake with cream cheese icing, so I decided to try this recipe out.  Like another reviewer, I opted for strawberry yogurt (cream on top Stonyfield Farms) over the original sour cream, and I used a cream cheese icing.  It was absolutely fantastic--perfect texture, fluffiness, softness, denseness.  Everything a cake should be, and then some.  One of my friends had four pieces.  Eat this.  For the children.

Great cake, and easy to make...don't let all the ingredients fool you.  I gave this a 5 because it's one of the few cake recipes that call for fresh strawberries, not jello or a box mix.  I made this for friends, and everyone loved it.  I only made a few changes.  I tossed a handful of sliced almonds in the batter instead of toasting them and putting them on top.  I added a teaspoon of almond extract to the batter, and a squirt of red food coloring to give the cake a nice deeper pink color.  I had to bake the cake an extra 15-20 minutes; maybe that's my oven's fault, it's old.  I put the glaze in a sandwich bag and piped it on the cake.  The glaze adds a nice tartness.  Next time I'll probably cut the sugar in the batter back to a cup or less.  Thanks for a nice cake recipe that travels well!

tastes great, though for my teenaged son a chocolate icing seemed required. To improve mass appeal I plan to try adding grated chocolate to the batter and dusting with powdered sugar.

I didn't like the icing for this cake.  It was also too flat for me.  Although it is the best recipe for strawberry cake.

I liked the cake well enough but made 2 small changes: I added the called-for mashed strawberries + more sliced strawberries. I added a bit more flour to compensate. I also used plain yogurt in place of sour cream. The frosting was much too sweet for us so the next time I made the cake I whipped fresh cream and topped the cake with that and more sliced strawberries on top. I also added the lemon zest on top as well.

I made the cake exactly as the recipe states...well maybe a touch more mashed strawberries, I guess. It was FABULOUS! This was a 'dry run' for my granddaughter's first birthday cake. It does end up being very thin as others have said so I decided I'm going to double the recipe and make the cake two layer for her big day. I also ditched the recipe's frosting as I'm a big fan of sour cream cream frosting. I softened and creamed together 8 oz of cream cheese with 4 TBS of butter, 2 TBS of milk, and 1 cup of powdered sugar. YUM! But it only frosted the top...so for the final plan will be to do 2 1/2 x the frosting described for the two layer final birthday cake. Go for it an try this...I think you'll love it! :)

I chose this recipe  because I needed to make a birthday cake and I was low on sugar and I had lots of strawberries. I did use buttermilk instead of sour cream which improved the batter consistancy. As the cake was baking I went to the refridgerator and I had NO lemons, but I had limes. Lime frosting was absolutely incredible on this cake, everyone loved it. The cake was thin but not too much so and it baked very well. I will make this again!

A great recipe! My husband likes it and he isn't even a dessert eater. I like to make it a day ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator. I think it's even better chilled.

Since I'm lactose intolerant, I used almond milk and substituted the sour cream for Silk vanilla yogurt. I added cinnamon as suggested by some. The cake is moist and the tart lemon frosting really compliments it. My son (who is not a fan of cake) even liked it.

I can not believe ANYONE could give this less then 5 stars!!! This cake is the best! We make it for all our family birthdays.  All my friends, co workers, family request it.   Super moist and so tasty.  I don't alter any of it.  I think the reviewers who had problems must have made mistakes.

I had some extra strawberries and wanted to put them to good use. This was the perfect fit! We never put frosting on our homemade cakes yet this one was an exception! Everything came out perfect and light so it didn't feel heavy when you ate it. A few variations:  I used high quality butter and whole wheat flour. YUM!!!

Oh boy . . this was absolutely fabulous and easy to boot. Rather than icing the cake, I put lime zest over the batter before baking and then topped each piece off with whipping cream and fresh strawberries. Everyone loved this cake and looks forward to a repeat!  Thanks.

It took a while to find a recipe that was not made with cake mix. I would give it a 5 star if I didn't have to modify it so much. I used others recommendations and made my own adjustments.
I times the batter by 1.5 to fit my cake pan.
I put 2 cups of sliced fresh strawberries.
I didn't have sour cream so instead used cherry smoothly I had on hand.
I didn't just use baking soda but instead did 2 parts baking soda and 1 part baking powder.
I just used white sugar.

Topping:
I put 1/2 cups of almonds I chopped up.
I added sliced strawberries on top. The sliced strawberries ontop  made such a difference. I would have added even more to have more of that strawberry taste. So yummy!

In the end it was a yummy moist cake.

Next time I will try substituting the butter with oil to make it healthier. We'll see if it's still a good cake.
For the topping, next  time I will grind up the sugar to make it icing sugar. The regular sugar made the topping quite crunchy.

I was able to achieve a great texture using cake flour along with 1 tablespoon of soda and 1/2 tablespoon of baking powder. However, even after using 1 cup fresh strawberries chopped plus another one pur√©ed, there was nothing strawberry about the taste. It was incredibly disappointing.

Great tasting cake.  I did add  a few extra strawberries (1/4-1/2   CUP) and did not have any issues with it not being cooked enough.  As long as you make sure the cake springs back in the center before taking it out you should be fine.  Definitely make the recipe frosting to top this with.  The flavor of the lemon in the icing paired with the strawberry cake is what really makes this so good.

This is terrific cake. The fresh strawberry flavor was just what I was searching for. I made a buttercream frosting with lemon juice and some leftover smashed strawberries that was just perfect on top! I can't tell you the amounts on that because I just threw it together.

I've had to start pureeing & freezing strawberries so that I can make this cake in the dead of winter whenever my family needs a little bit of summer in our lives.  It's so fresh & delicious.  I always make a double batch of the icing, though ... yum!!

The cake by itself was very sweet, with frosting on top it was too sweet.  I think this recipe would make wonderful muffins, but not a cake.

Made this last night and it was so good! Going to make it again tonight so I can bring a cake in to work tomorrow just for fun. I followed the recipe except I used regular sugar cause that was what I had and two cups of diced strawberries. I also used a cream cheese frosting instead. My husband loved it too!

This is an awesome recipe! It took a while to find a strawberry cake recipe that didn't call for Jello, but it was worth it! This recipe is super moist and yummy.

For anyone who is interested, though (I don't know if it mentions in the recipe) it doesn't actually have to be a strawberry cake. I've tried it a few times with other fruit as well. 
First with blueberries, which was... interesting. Tasted fine, if not particularly strongly of blueberry (maybe a pie filling would work better?), but it was rather interesting looking - especially when cooked. 
I made it with Banana as well, for my dad's birthday - that turned out AWESOME. Especially since I used a chocolate frosting. It was really heavy, though. I probably shouldn't have made it a layer cake... LOL.

Every time I bake this cake I get compliments. It's a VERY moist cake, and thus I don't make the frosting.

We had a bunch of strawberries, no cake mixes and no gelatin and I felt like baking.  This recipe was a winner!  I chopped up some strawberries and poured them over the top as I didn't have the xxx sugar on hand either.  Everyone loved this cake; we finished it for breakfast.  The sour cream is a must - gives it a very moist consistency!  Thanks for a Strawberry Cake recipe that does use prepackaged items such as cake mix and gelatin.

Ive made this three times so far and each time it was finished within 24 hours!! I always make this as soon as strawberries come into season! and I've even tried it with frozen strawberries, which was good, but fresh was better. thanks for a great recipe!

I scaled this to 36 servings and made it into a layer cake as another reviewer suggested.  Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly.  It was a delicious cake!!  It was very moist but I didn't have any problems with it dropping or being too flat.  I used a lemon filling from this site in the middle of my cakes and on top.  My father-in-law made a special trip to my house the next day for another peice!

I made this cake last night.  I used frozen strawberries.  I allowed the berries to thaw and then mashed a cup of them.  I also used regular white sugar.  My cake turned out very moist but I did not taste a lot of strawberry.  Next time, I will add more berries and add strawberry extract.  I iced my cake with homemade cream cheese frosting.

It's pretty good.  I prefer the strawberries pureed instead of mashed though so there's no wet chunks in the cake.  Like some other reviewers said, it's a nice cake for at home, but not a show-stopper.  Will probably make again sometime, thanks for the recipe!

Soooo good! I used fresh strawberries pureed, and it was a huge hit for hubby's birthday! I also used a bit of cream cheese frosting since I made it a layer cake and required a bit more frosting then the recipe called for. Yummy! Will make again!

I have mixed feelings when it comes to this cake! It was very moist and delicious, and the sweet and tart lemon icing was a great compliment. I just don't think it's "wow your socks off" good. I made it to take to my boyfriend's parents' house for the 4th of July, and instead of the almonds I sprinkled blue sugar , and then with the pale lemon icing and slices of strawberry on top, it was easily patriotic. I think it's a nice cake to make for the family, but not something to pick if you're trying to impress.

This was a delicious cake I just made for my husbands birthday.  I followed the recipe exactly and I am pleasantly surprised by the results.  I think I will chill this over night and serve it tommorrow for a barbecue in small little squares a bit like petit fours.  Love this recipe!! Very easy and fresh.
