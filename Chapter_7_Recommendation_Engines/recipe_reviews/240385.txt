I didn't care for the combination of apple and egg and couldn't taste the Boursin cheese at all.

Great dish and easy to make.  Added shallots since I had one that needed to get used and it really brought out the cheese flavor.  Also I cook everything in my iron skillet so if you have one, no need to dirty a pie plate.
