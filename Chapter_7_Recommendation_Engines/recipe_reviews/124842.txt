My daughter and I love this recipe.  The only variation we use is that we leave out the cilantro.  It's a real crowd pleaser on new years eve.

I love this recipe.  My picky children even ate it!  One recommendation, don't use light cream cheese.  I tried it and the dip did not set as good.

You really should make the salmon mixture ahead of time to allow the flavors to blend.  I added more salsa to give the salmon spread more vibrant tastes.  This appetizer should be refrigerated more than a few hours so that it chills/sets so that it is easy to slice up.

I made this as an appetizer at my son's 27th Birthday party. Everyone loved them (except my 17 year old daughter, but she's picky)! I used 1 1/2 6 oz packages of Chicken of the Sea Salmon instead of the can and added some sour cream in addition to the cream cheese. I substituted thinly sliced green onions for the parsley and omitted the cilantro altogether. I forgot to buy the salsa so I used some well-drains Rotelle tomatoes and also sliced up a fresh Roma tomato that I had on hand. They were delicious but a little mushy to cut even after being refrigerated for 2 hours. I think next time I make them I'll use 2 tortillas instead of just one I think also next time I would increase the cumin just a bit. Awesome recipe though and very versatile. It would be great with pineapple, black olive and bell pepper too!

Very good! We literally had nothing in our refrigerator or pantry when we came home from vacation....but somehow we had these ingredients! I didn't feel like going to the store, so this was a perfect dinner for two tired people!

Made as directed except I used pico de gallo instead of salsa.  These were so yummy.  Everyone wanted the recipe and commented on how addictive they are.
Will make again for sure...and with the pico since it gave a tad of crunch.

Good recipe as a starting point.  Because of plenty of food allergies in the family, I had to make substitutions, and most don't like hot spicy foods.  So, these were good, but on the bland side.  Next time I will add dried dill weed and maybe some onion and garlic powder in place of the cumin.  I kept some of the rolled, unsliced appetizers in the fridge wrapped in plastic wrap to keep moist.  My husband liked these the best as he could grab a roll and eat it as a snack.  Thanks, Evelyn, for an appetizer that's different from the norm.

I made these for a Pot Luck for my husbands work. What a hit!! It's been months and people are still asking him when he is going to bring them back in. Easy and perfect for the nicest dinner party. Add some color by using different flavors of tortillas.

we thought this recipe needed a little more flavor, was a bit bland for us.  If I make it again, I'll add a little more heat

I was excited about this, but the results were not to my liking.  And no one else in our home cared for these.  They were not bad, but not really anything I'd crave to have again.  I'd rather have a canned tuna fish sandwich...

I had no idea that a 15 oz can of salmon included things other than salmon and just small fish bones, like vertebrae, spinal discs, scales and fins.  Took me 30 minutes to go through and get all the yuck out. Finished dish, brought to a potluck, and people said they liked it but nobody ate it.  Never again!  Recommendation: buy small cans of Salmon instead, they don't have all the junk.

These are easy and delicious!  I used homemade salsa for freshness, and also after spreading onto the tortillas, I sprinkled with fresh chopped cilantro before rolling.  Chilled for 4 hrs and they sliced beautifully.  Thanks for sharing.

Great stuff! Interestingly enough I wouldn't change a thing...  other than suggesting one use packaged smoked salmon instead of canned (wince).

I read all the great reviews and decided to make these for a holiday party. Big mistake! Mushy and bland! Can I take away the one star and give them zero stars? Horrible!!! One person at the party spit it out!

This was a hit for the 2011 SuperBowl as written.
The next time I made it, I added:
2 marinated artichoke hearts, drained and diced, +
4 tbsp diced green onions or leeks. Plus I used
Whole Wheat tortillas
These were also a hit.  I'm sure you could be quite creative as long as the basic proportions of salmon and cream cheese and salsa are kept.
This is definately going to be one of my "standard" appies.

Pretty good. I only had plain white tortillas, but I bet this would be tastier and prettier with whole wheat or spinach ones.

This was absolutely delicious!  Very easy to make, even my sister who 'cringed' after hearing what they were made of before trying, ended up taking most of them home with her :(  I used Pace Original Picante Mild salsa, and green onions to replace the parsley and cilantro, as others suggested, also used about a half tablespoon on cumin instead of the teaspoon.  This made so much I was able to cover 2 and a half large plates.  Next I will be making this just for myself, freezing some and eating the rest throughout the week.

Loved it, Loved it, Loved it.  I did alter the recipe a little according to one reviewer suggestions.  Instead of using salsa, I used Pico de Gallo and I used a tomato flatbread from whole foods and it was fabulous.  I am going to make these again for the next 2 Christmas parties that I will be attending in the coming weeks.

I thought these were okay!  But I just might not like salmon that much or the extra work of de-boning was not fun.  Sorry but they are off my list!

I brought this to my family thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I added more cumin though and some black pepper. I really enjoyed them dipped in horseradish, it's great if you like a little extra kick!
Thanks for posting this!

not bad, needs more veggies (i added olives), or something to break up the flavor. Maybe capers or onions.

EXCELLENT RECIPE!!  I did not have canned salmon but I had a fresh salmon fillet in my refrigerator so I baked it, flaked it, then added the ingredients.  YUMMY YUMMY!!  I used cilantro salsa.  This will go to my recipe box!

Very good and easy to make.  To me, they are a little dry.  Try adding 2 tbls. of sweet relish.

I enjoy this recipe. I use garden spinach herb wraps instead of regular flour tortillas, and I throw in a little green onion to the mix. Also, I do not use canned salmon, it sounds disgusting and seems like a hassle to pick through for bones; I bake the pre cut fillets. Has been a hit every time I've made it; never any left overs.

I had some leftover salmon and cream cheese and decided to try this.  Although I like salmon and salsa I was skeptical about combining the two.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Nothing to write home about.  I had some leftover cream cheese that I need to use up, or I never would have tried this recipe.

I've made this many times and it's always a hit - either as an appetizer or to accompany soup for lunch.

This is a real easy recipe to throw together as an appetizer for a party. However, I found the combination of the cream cheese and the salmon was very sweet tasting. If I can find a way to cut the sweetness, then it'd be perfect.
