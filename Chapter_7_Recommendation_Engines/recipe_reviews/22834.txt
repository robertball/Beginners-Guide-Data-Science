This is very good dip. I tasted it before adding the almonds and just felt it needed a little something. I added 1/4 tsp. of almond extract and was very pleased with the result. I also toasted the almonds and let them cool before adding to the dip. Very tasty!

Wonderful! I did not have almonds, so I just added some almond extract. I served it with a big fruit platter as dessert. The kids did not like the dip, but I loved it and even my husband who had tried to get out of eating any fruit ate his and then half of the kids'.

It goes wonderful with grapes, apples, bananas and oranges.
