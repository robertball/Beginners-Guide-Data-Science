Me and my husband really loved this soup!!! I had regular bratwursts so I added a quarter cup of bud light. Also I did cut up a large potato and cooked it with the bratwursts and carrots beer and water! Turned out great! Will make again, for sure!

Iâ€™m surprised something from a can is able to be created into another soup where it almost loses the taste of starting from a canned soup! I made this in my instant pot 5 minutes with just the water (1/2 cup) and carrots, onion, and brats, then after the first 5 minutes I drained the water and added in the soup and milk. I also added in some potato gnocchi. This was good!

Substitute brats for beef. Sub onion for chopped potatoes. So good!!!
