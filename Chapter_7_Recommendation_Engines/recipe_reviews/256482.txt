I’ve used this recipe for the last several years for our traditional New Year’s Day panettone French toast.  It’s perfect.  But we cook way more than one slice at a time!  For 1/2 of a large panettone, I quadrupled the recipe (1 cup milk, 4 eggs, and a generous shake or two of cinnamon).  I used an electric griddle and found that 300 degrees worked well.  (375 degrees made it too brown/burned while the middle was still soggy.)

Yummy! I like to melt the butter in the syrup and pour over toast keeping it nice and warm.
