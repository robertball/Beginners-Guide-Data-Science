We really liked this recipe.  Even my picky teenager came back for seconds!  I totally skipped dipping the pork in the egg and dredging it - still turned out fantastic and crip!  Not big on green peppers, so I chopped them up fine.  Except for the flavor they added, no one really noticed they were there...  For those of you who looked for "Tapioca Starch" and failed - look for "Tapioca Flour" instead.  It is actually one and the same!  Bob's Red Mill is the brand I came up with and it is found in most of your health food aisle of your grocery store.  The Tapioca Starch/Flour adds an additional slight sweetness to the recipe.  You can substitute corn starch for this tho'.  Use 1-Tbsp corn starch to every 2-Tbsp Tapioca Starch/Flour.  If you have problems finding "Plum Sauce", you can usually find that in the Asian aisle of your grocery store by the other speciality sauces they offer...

This is a fantastic recipe and as I'm Singaporean, I can tell you that it's certainly authentic! I think one step was missed out, as pointed out by another reviewer - after the water, salt and baking soda mix, dip the pork pieces in beaten egg before drenching in tapioca flour (which, incidentally, is easy to find and fairly cheap in Singapore). The oil will turn cloudy and blacken while deep-frying and I had to change the oil in the wok several times. Oh, and I also recommend halving the amount of plum sauce and vinegar,as well as adding more sugar, as I personally found the sauce a bit too sour/tangy. If you don't have plum sauce, you could use the pineapple juice in the can (if you're using canned pineapples).

This was really great, and I am one who makes a lot of Asian food. Don't worry if you don't have tapioca starch, regular cornstarch (or sweet rice flour) works fine.

Delicious recipe and easily adjustable to what you have on hand. I think you are supposed to beat the egg into the salt, soda, water mixture-then put the pork to it and then drop it in the cornstarch or flour. Don't worry if you don't have tapioca FLOUR, use cornstarch or all-purpose flour (do NOT use regular TAPIOCA it is for making pudding or thickening pies)! I used pork sirloin chops cubed-then fried them til well browned over medium,not high, adjusting the heat accordingly to avoid burning, this takes about 20-30 minutes depending on your heat etc. To make sure they are done cut open one of the larger pieces and check it. I used only pinapple chunks, thinly sliced carrot, and green bell pepper& yellow onion cut in a one inch dice.For extra zip I added some pepper. I did not add tomato, red chili pepper or plum sauce, because I didn't have it on hand and the recipe turned out just fine.

I made this several days ago and the family is already asking for a repeat!  I dredged the meat in corn starch rather than tapioca, and I omitted the tomatoes.  Thank you for sharing this one Jennifer!

This turned out to be really good.  I didn’t have any “tapioca starch” (I hear they have some in Singapore, but I couldn’t afford to fly there) so I used corn starch instead.  I also beat an egg and dipped the pork pieces into it before breading, even though the recipe left this step out.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.  I’m giving it 5 stars because it really is that good.  Next time I will add some crushed red pepper, and use 2 red chili peppers instead of one because I like the heat.  Then I’ll give it 6 stars.  This was easy to prepare, and tasted great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful dish, but it involves a lot of care! I used flour instead of starch (didn't have any handy at the time)... keep your skillet clean, flour will brown and burn after a while, giving your dish a blackish tone. Also, drain the excess oil and burnt flour before you add the vegetables, I don't recommend simply using the same skillet right out...

Cut the fat out of the pork... it tastes terrible when cooked!

We love this recipe! It was quick & easy to prepare and the sauce is delicious. I didn't have plum sauce so I used the syrup/juice from the pineapple instead.

I first made this recipe several years ago. Now, I double the sauce component and use dried red pepper flakes in place of the whole pepper and omit the tomatoes. The pepper flakes give it a nice zing, I think.

This recipe was amazing!! We made it last night and couldn't get over how well it turned out...better than takeout by a mile! Will definitely be making again.  I followed most of the recipe exactly except that we also added in broccoli (we love tons of veggies).  For the pork, however, we made some changes.  First of all, we used leftover pork tenderloin cut up into cubes.  Instead of breading and frying it the way they do in the recipe, I used another technique that I use for other dishes as well, its called 'velveting'.  You marinate the pork cubes in a mixture of 1 beaten egg, 1 TBSP cornstarch, 1 TBSP cooking sherry or beer, 2 TSP sesame oil, and 1/2 TSP salt.  Cover and put in the fridge for at least 1 hour.  Before you are ready to cook, take the pork cubes out, drain the marinade, and dust in more cornstarch.  Then fry until golden brown.

a great recipe, I used the syrup from the can of pineapple instead of plum sauce. But no major changes needed. I will make with chicken next time, but that really is just personal preference, nothing to do with the recipe itself! it was a lot of work, but tastes good so it's worth it as long as you have the time.

After making this recipe for the 5th time recently, my husband declared, "you can make this every week and it would not be enough." Although this is sweet and sour pork, I have only made it with pork once and instead I have substituted chicken breast in cubes all the other times yielding with wonderful results.

This came out absoutely amazing!  I didnt have two things the recipe  called for. A red chile pepper and tapioca starch.  I simpy substituted with crushed red pepper flakes and cornstarch. Also, I only used about 2Tbs of sugar and I think next time I'll only use 1.  You get enough sweetness from the pineapple and plum sauce. I wasnt sure how this would come out but it was super delicious.  Will definitely be making this again.  As other reviews stated the recipe skips the part where you add the egg.  I added it to the salt, baking soda, water mixture.

Really Good. Turned out better then I expected. Just like the Sweet & Sour Pork I get for take-out. The only change I made was I used cornstarch instead of the tapioca starch and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes instead of red pepper cause its what I had on hand. I will make this again.

This was absolutely delicious! The batter on the pork was a little strange, but we figured out the egg should have been in the salt and baking soda mix so will do it right next time.  We didn't have tapioca, so used corn starch, nor did we have plum sauce so used pineapple juice.  It was savory, sweet, sour and beautiful.  Way better than in many restaurants.  Thanks, Jennifer!

Great recipe.  Made as directed except subbed pineapple juice for the plum sauce and water.  Next time I would use pineapple tidbits instead of crushed, but that is just my preference.  Will make again.

husband really like it!!  pretty simple and i even had some tapioca starch laying around because of a different chinese meal i made one time. the only problem i came across is that the ingredients called for 1 egg but no where in the recipe does it mention to add any egg.  anyhow, it turned out very good.  i left out the tomato and added water chesnuts.

This sauce is really good.  I had some leftover cooked pork loin roast that I cut up in small cubes.  I coated the pork cubes in cornstarch and browned in canola oil.  Then I sauteed red bell pepper and onion-I did not use tomato or red chili pepper. In a small bowl I combined the sugar, no salt, cornstarch, white vinegar (only used 2 and 1/2 tbs per another reviewer), ketchup, used hoison sauce, and water. I did add a splash of lite soy sauce and the juice from the can of pineapple chunks. I combined the browned pork cubes, peppers and onions, pineapple, and gravy sauce and cooked until bubbly and thickened.  Very tasty!

This dish was way too salty for me.  I don't usually have that problem, but the salty flavor seemed to be way overpowering.  I was suprised how easy the recipe was, though.  I used regular flour like some other users said because I couldn't find tapioca flour.  I also couldn't find plum sauce, but I made do with what I had.

Just like the other reviews say... this is fabulous!  I didn't bother looking for the tapioca starch I just used the corn starch like another reviewer suggested.  Good stuff.

I found this recipe really easy, but I did not deep fry the pork...just did it as directed in 2 Tbsp of oil for 10 minutes.  With constant stirfrying it did not burn at all....SO tasty!

We had it over crispy fried chinese noodles YUM

To quote my husband..."this one's a keeper!"  Excellent and easy. I put aside some pork and vegetables before adding the sauce for my picky four year...she gobbled it up.  Like some of the other reviewers, I used all-purpose flour instead of the tapioca.  Thank You Jennifer!

This was the 2nd recipe that I have tried since finding the site in the last 2 days which is pretty good for someone that hates cooking.  I was a little skeptical when making the sauce as it was a kind of pink color and I thought this is so runny its going to look and taste awful, but, after following the directions all I can say is this was bloody lovely and even my hubby who hates sweet things enjoyed it.  I will definitely make this again.  If I could give it more than 5 stars I would, so thanks for sharing the recipe, it was a winner.

I tried it as written the first time, and did not like the tomato in it. So now I just add an extra pepper and keep the recipe as is! Family favorite by far.

i didnt have any egg, so i dipped the pork in milk first then dipped into 4 tbs cornstarch, 4 tbs flour and 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt. and sauteed it. i sauteed my vegetables  in another pan.  the sauce i used the pineapple syrup from the canned pineapples and a little spicy chile sauce also didnt have any vinegar and used sake instead.  overall a really good recipe will try again with vinegar.

I really liked this.  I thought it was the perfect balance between sweet and sour.  I am used to sweet and sour being "red" and this was not.  That was a bonus to me.  My husband isn't crazy about sweet and sour and he did not really like this.  He thought there was too much pineapple in it. He ate it anyway though.

I have tried a few sweet and sour pork recipes and this one is the best.  It was tasty and looked almost exactly like what we order at restaurants.  I used pork for stew to speed up the cooking time.  Next time I will add more pineapple.  This recipe is great!

This was a great recipe and tasted a little different which is good.  I was scared about the tomato but it was great.  I think corn starch tastes a lot better for the batter than flour.  The sauce was tasty too.  It was actually better than some restaurants that I've been to.  I gave up on the bag and just treded the pork.  I made a huge mess in the kitchen but everyone like it.  (I double battered the pork and cooked in the deepfryer and doubled the sauce due to my preference).  I used pineapple juice instead of plum.

My husband and I found this recipe to be very tasty, and I would definately make it again.  I think next time though I will cut back on the amount of salt used in coating mixture.  Also, since I was unable to find Tapioca starch, I just used regular flour which worked fine.

Delicious.  I would cut out the sugar a little next time.  Didn't have tapioca so just used corn starch instead.  Didn't have plum sauce either so I used sweet chili which gave it a nice kick.  Also, passed on the tomatoes.  Just seemed weird.

Better than anything take out and well worth the work. I used regular cornstarch as that is what I had on hand but have since found the right ingredient for next time.

This recipe is fabulous! I doubled the sauce and used spare ribs. I didn't have any tapioca so I just tossed in flour but otherwise followed exactly. I will keep this recipe for the future! Added bonus - my 2 year old loves it!

Great recipe!!  Added carrots to the veggies.  And too reviewers suggestion to marinate pork in 1 egg, 1 T. sherry, 1 T. Cornstarch, and 1 1/2 t sesame oil and a little salt.  Then drained, dredged in rice flour and fried.  Used red and yellow peppers rather than green.  Prefer the taste!  Will def make again!

I have to admit I used this recipe simply for the sauce which was fantastic! I simply dredged the pork in arrowroot flour, and chopped up a mixture of vegetables I had on hand. I made the sauce the way it was written except for substituting rice vinegar for the white vinegar, and leaving out the salt. Everyone loved it and I will be making this again.

I am sorry, I did not see where the gg in the recipe comes into play. It is in the ingredients but not the directions.
It takes about 2 hours to make unless you are set up as a restaurant.
It takes 4 times the flour and 8 times the oil. You can't use 1/4 cup of flour to coat 1 pound of cut up meat, perhaps if it was not cut up 1/4 cup would be enough but then it would be a pork roast. After making the adjustments it did taste good.

5-star, despite the two typo errors (i.e. the egg, and the reference to corn "flour").  I left out the egg altogether; it wasn't necessary. A red bell pepper can be used in place of a red chile pepper for added colour to the dish. Also, the pineapple doesn't have to be crushed; it can be in tidbit or chunk form. I didn't have tapioca starch, so I just used cornstarch. For a little heat, I added a 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes when the sauce was added, but aside from that I followed the recipe. It was great and I'll definitely make it again ! Serve with white or fried rice and an egg roll or two each, and this makes a tasty meal.

This was so so good and not difficult at all. Followed the recipe but used cornstarch instead of tapioca flour and it was great.  Will definitely make again and again.  Husband said to put it in the rotation for sure!

I have been using this recipe for years. I put my own meat and veggies in, but I always finish with the sauce mix. Makes a yummy perfectly thick sauce that tastes great.

I put in sliced carrots and omitted the tomatoes, used pineapple juice instead of water in sauce. Used canned pineapple chunks (1 cup). Put in 1/4 tsp. Of crushed red pepper. I also used cornstarch instead of arrowroot. Yummy sauce. Will definitely make again. Served with rice.

This is fabulous!  I only had white wheat flour, so that's what I used and it was perfect, crispy, even with sauce.
Thank you so much for sharing!

It was awsome and very easy to make.  The only thing is that it does´t explain what to do with the egg. I just mixed it in the meat after adding the tapioca starch (I used corn starch)

I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time.  We loved it.  I used fresh pineapple and homemade spicy plum sauce and it was really tasty.  Thanks for sharing.

I couldn't find tapioca starch so I used tapioca from Minute Rice. The texture was very strange, very "bumpy" for lack of a better word, and chewy. The sauce was wonderful, however. Is tapoica starch something that asian stores carry? The extensive ethnic food section at my favorite grocery store didn't have it...nevertheless, I served these with Crab Rangoon II and it was great together.
