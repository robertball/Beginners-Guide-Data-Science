I made these cookies last week.  They are "just" another peanut butter cookie.  I gave some to friends and they had the same opinion.  They are actually a pain to make. Cutting the dough and flattening is a pain, the dough sticks to your hand and is greasy. They are a good friendly comfort cookie but I wouldn't make them again.  Not worth it.  Better recipes out there.

A peanut butter cookie with a creamy filling.  YUM!  I made a double batch.  They go quickly!  Tip: Keep the filling mixture under 1 inch so you have enough for all the cookies.

My sister made these cookies and we couldn't stop eating them. The only complaint she had was that the dough was a little too hard to work with (too sticky). We liked them so well that I decided to make them myself today, but I was out of peanuts and I didn't have the cookie dough. So I used a cookie dough recipe from this site, Dad's Favorite Peanut Butter Cookies, and I made them without the peanuts. WOW! Even better! And the dough was easy to work with. Thank you, Carolyn. These really are million dollar cookies! P.S. To get the right amount of filling, cut it into 24 pieces, just like the dough, beforehand. You will then have the perfect amount for each cookie.

This cookies were crispy, I prefer soft and chewy.  Also, the peanut butter filling was very runny, so added additional powdered sugar to make it easy to roll into balls.  Good flavor, but not a "do-over" at my house.

I thought these were great.  The creamy middle was a nice contrast to the crunchy cookie, and it was the cinnamon/peanut mixture on the outside that puts them over the top! However, they were messy, and more work than "from scratch" cookies.  Also, I only got about 19 cookies so I will have to measure the dough better next time.  Also watch time; they continue to cook a little after taking them out.  Thanks for million dollar winner :-)

What's the point of having a recipe that uses cookie-dough? You can't get this stuff everywhere in the world - not good for international users.

MMMM!  I cut down on the cinnamon, but next time I won't, it gives the cookie a little something different.  These are awesome, a little time consuming but worth it for the result.  Thanks!

In the interest of cooking science, I made these exactly as written. I could not find the name-brand dry roasted peanuts in my area, so I used Safeway brand. Then, I made an 'all-homemade' version, using natural peanut butter, and a homemade cookie dough (Classic Peanut Butter Cookies) from this site. Nobody at work could tell which one was which. The prizewinner's peanut butter center did work slightly better than the homemade version's middle (Go Carolyn Gurtz!), but you did get a creamy middle in both, so the homemade version worked, too, which surprised me. Great cookie!

Everyone is my family adores these cookies! I usually leave out the chopped nuts and just coat them with the cinn/sugar mix. I also bake them on parchment paper on an airbake pan, and they turn out perfect!

This seriously won?  For all the work you have to do, they are just "alright."  I was not impressed.  My twin daughters and I watched the Bake-off competition on the Food Network last week, and wanted to try the winning recipe.  WHAT A PAIN this is!  I ended up doing most of the work because I didn't want my 5 year olds touching the dough as much as you need to in the recipe.  I don't even think the proportions are correct for the "inside" peanut butter mixture - I needed to add more 10x sugar to make it even workable!  After all the work...I thought they tasted good....but definitely not worth all the time.  I would not make it again, nor would I recommend it to a friend.

Taste great, but takes too long for using refrigerated cookie dough. I only got 18 balls out of the peanut butter/powdered sugar combo. I would much rather make other peanut butter cookies for the mess these made. Won't make these again, Sorry. Just my opinion.

Crisp around the edges, soft in the middle and filled with silky and sweet peanut butter. The recipe may be simple, but the outcome is supremely good. Congratulation, C. Gurtz!

This is the best peanut butter cookie ever! I could eat all of them if I let myself. I was really hesitant rolling them in the cinnamon mixture, so I only did half. Now I wish I would have rolled all of them. They're delicious with or without it, but those flavors really go well together. I'll be making these often.

I didn't think these cookies were all that exceptional in taste to be a winner in a Pillsbury bake off.  Very time consuming and the dough is sticky...dust your hands with a bit of flour.  I managed to get the proportions right and could cover each ball with cookie dough, but the cookie is really not worth the effort.

These cookies are tasty, however I would dissagree that the recipe is simple or accurate.  One roll of dough is hardly enough for 24 cookies and 1 inch balls of peanutbutter center is far too large for the size of dough called for the recipe.  My boyfriend loves them, so the taste is there.  The baker gives 3 stars and the taster gives 5!!  Ill try it again, but make changes for sure.

Soft and chewy cookie.  We loved these at my house.  Takes awhile to make, but worth it.  Use a cookie scooper to make 12 balls, then cut in half to get the 24 middles.

This recipe is from the Jif peanut butter website.  It has the same name and everything.  I've made them before and they're really only for peanut butter lovers.  It's just a peanut butter cookie with a gooey center which seems to contrast poorly with the crispy cookie.

This recipe appeared in my local newspaper this week and I had to try them.  My husband loves cookies and especially peanut butter and he loved these cookies!  I have always used my mom's peanut butter cookie recipe, but this recipe is a delightful change.  Next time though, I will not remove the Pillsbury dough until the very last minute.  Mine got a little soft before slicing.  Congrats to Carolyn!  Your son was right, these are winners!!!

These cookies are awesome!  My 12 year old daughter made them and followed the recipe exactly.  They were outstanding.  I wouldn't change a thing.  My husband said maybe a bit less cinnamon but he ate most of them.  Congratulations Carolyn Gurtz!

These cookies did not work all that well for me at all. I didn't have peanuts so maybe that was my mistake, but they didn't firm up the way a cookie should. Maybe I will try them again but make sure that I have all the ingredients!

This recipe is great for an easy and fast fix, but if you have the time, I highly recommend making homemade peanut butter cookie dough from scratch and then using the "middle" with it.  Yummier!  Nothing against ready-made cookie dough, but homemade always taste better.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was exceptional!  I really don't like peanut butter cookies but I thought a million dollar recipe must be good!  They are fun to make and so simple. My family devoured these and I certainly ate more than I needed.  Fantastic!  Thank you!

These are the best cookies I have ever had. I made them exactly as the recipe is and they turned out great. They are very easy too. They are now my favorite cookies!!
