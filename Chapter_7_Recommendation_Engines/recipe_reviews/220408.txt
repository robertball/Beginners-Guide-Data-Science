I like that I can use the egg whites and not the yolks since I have extra whites when I make certain pastries, I did still use the pecans because I don't like walnuts.

I used a spice cake and butterscotch pudding combo and it was great , very moist but a bit heavy.. the sauce was amazing but way to sweet even for me.. I also used crushed walnut  and it was really good but I'd suggest cutting the recipe down by at least half as I have a ridiculous amount left over.. overall it was great

I was searching for a recipe for a black walnut bread roll like my grandmother used to make for the holidays. I found out what she made was actually a Walnut Poteca , when I discovered the recipe on here. I pared back the recipe to make a small amount since I had never done it before & it was a test. I still had a large amount of nut filling. It immediately reminded me of German Chocolate icing, which I looked up on Allrecipes & the only thing I had to do was add butter & cook to thicken my filling. It turned out very well, esp. Since I was using left overs. I would add some vanilla or coconut extract next time, but good recipe.
