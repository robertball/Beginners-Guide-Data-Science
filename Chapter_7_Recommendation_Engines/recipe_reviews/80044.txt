YUMMO! What a great breakfast treat! No need for the salt and to make it even more special, I placed a poached egg on top. Delish!

I used pancetta instead of prosciutto, because the pancetta was cubed and I was tired and lazy.  I also added some fresh basil.  This is rich and creamy and outrageously good.

Exceptional taste; even those not crazy about the thought of grits will give these powerful flavors a big thumbs up!

awesome!!! my first time as a first reviewer for an allrecipe! my boyfriend & i both like grits but avoided the recipes which seemed laden with butter or cheese (or both). i followed this recipe as directed, making only a couple modifications such as substituting olive oil for vegetable oil & omitting the salt because the ham & cheese are loaded with the stuff. lastly, my prosciutto should have been sliced thinner but still fried up fine. next time i'll make sure it's cut paper thin. the subtle flavors in this dish mingle well together. hot cereals make wonderful comfort food. thank you pam!

Delicious even without the prosciutto if you want to make the recipes even healthier. This has become a go-to breakfast item!

I loved this recipe.  I also love grits, and think that most people who "hate" them have never tried them when questioned!  I subbed canadian bacon for the prosciutto and it was good.  But is outstanding with the prosciutto.  Pancetta (italian bacon) makes it very special also.  When losing weight, it never hurts to splurge a little and make yourself feel special!

This was great I made it for my husband this morning and he loved it. I baked the prosciutto in the oven instead of frying it.
