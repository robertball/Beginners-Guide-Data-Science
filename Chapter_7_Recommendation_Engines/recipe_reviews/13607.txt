This was very good, but I cut back on the amount of liquid and only used milk. This was the first time I made this recipe in a dish rather than a muffin pan. I found that I prefer the individual muffins as they come out so much prettier. A good basic recipe that went nicely with our prime rib. Thank you!

Perfect side to my holiday prime rib roast.  My wife said the neice and nephew wouldn't like the dinner.  Boy! Was she mistaken!  When it came time for them to leave, the boy said 'be sure to let us take some of that stuff!' meaning the Yorkshire Pudding.  (Now I have to say this nephew is 21 and his sister is 17, so I wouldn't call them 'kids.'

Pretty good.  It stuck in a few places.  Be sure to swirl hot fat around pan and then pour batter into center of pan.  A nice additon to the usual potatoes.

This recipe was simple but did not turn out for me - it was tough and not like yorkshire pudding you can buy in the mix. not a keeper for me.

This is the traditional English version of Yorkshire Pudding that my English grandmother used to make.  She never made her Yorkshire pudding in little cups.  We always ate this with roast beef and gravy with English roasted potatoes.
