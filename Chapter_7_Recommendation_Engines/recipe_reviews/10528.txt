Very good cookies, received rave reviews, had no leftovers.  I did increase amount of raspberry preserves, 2/3 cup not enough.  This is definitely a keeper!

Not a bad square but a tad bland. I would up the sugar a bit in the base and put about 1/2 cup more preserves.

I followed this recipe exactly the way it said.  The dough in the bottom didn't bake all of the way. I think if I were to make it again I would try to bake the dough first (like a pie crust) for 5-10 min before putting the jam and topping on. Just an idea but haven't tried that.

I was a little hesitant to try this recipe it had really mixed reviews but I thought they were really good.  They bottom layer is not dense and crunchy like a typical bar it was more cake-like. I would make again.

This is a very good recipe with one addition. I added 1 tsp of both vanilla and almond extract to the crust.

My husband and I didn't like these cookies at all.  They have a weird taste I can't put my finger on, but almost a spoiled taste.
