This was one of the best recipes I've tried recently.  Made it twice in the last two weeks and plan to make it again!  The only changes  made were because of not having some of the ingredients - I used 1 box of  couscous (about half of what was called for) with 1/3/4 cup water,  1 T powdered ginger instead of fresh, and feta cheese instead of bleu cheese.  Since I live alone, I've eaten it about 8 times in the last two weeks and STILL want more!  Healthy and delicious.

Needed more dressing and spices. I topped this with tofu marinated in Jerk seasoning and sautéed.

I made the recipe as written and loved it. I also think it will be a recipe that I can ply with since we are looking for more meatless entree’s. Next time I’ll try feta cheese and kalmata olives. I’ll let you know how it goes.
