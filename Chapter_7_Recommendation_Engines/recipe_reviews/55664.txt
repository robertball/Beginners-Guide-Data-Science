Since it looks like I'm the first rating this I felt I should cook it exactly as suggested - only change -I cooked rice instead of couscous since we are not fans of it.  I was only cooking for two of us and I'm glad.  We ate it but it was bland, bland, bland for out taste.  A waste of great pork chops.  I was excited about this dish since we love cumin, coarsened black pepper and the flavor of orange.  We would have been better off adding some oil to the pan and frying the chops with the seasonings and stopping right there.  At the end of cooking I thought about thickening the sauce but was slightly turned off already with the taste so I didn't bother.  Will check back to see how others reviewers feel.
