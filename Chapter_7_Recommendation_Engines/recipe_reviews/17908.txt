Classic custard cream recipe. If you want it thicker the trick is to use 3 tablespoons of flour or starch per liter of milk. Stir that into the egg/sugar mixture well so no clumps are left. Also, instead of whole eggs use egg yokes, make the custard as usual, then wait to cool to room temp and add the cooled cream slowly, while beating, to hard beaten egg whites (so they look like whipped cream). Beating the egg whites separately will give the cream more texture and thickness.

Super simple and delicious added vanilla and put on direct heat since the double boiler wasn't working for me and that did the trick just stirred continuously until it was the right consistency

I liked the fact that it was just simple ingredients although i added vanilla.  Not overadorned with cluttery extras!

Easy to make. 
I read the reviews and decided to exchange:
Milk - I used a can of Carnation evaporated milk
Sugar -  I used a can of Eagle Brand condensed milk and added vanilla.
It tasted like a light Creme Brulee.

Perfect boiled custard!  FYI, this is SUPPOSED TO BE thinner than pudding (hence custard and NOT pudding) as you can either eat it plain or my favorite way:  pour it over cake, ice cream, fruit, pie, etc...just wonderful!

I made this recipe for 7 (because that came out to 3 eggs).  I used 2/3 cup of turbinado (raw) sugar instead of the 1C and 3 TBS white sugar it called for and I would still cut that in half. Of the 4 & 2/3C milk, I used 2C Rice milk, 1 can evaporated, and the rest heavy/whipping cream. I also added a splash each of vanilla and almond extracts.  I'm pretty sure I cooked it too long because it started to get little bits in it.  It stayed thinner than spoonable, though the recipe does not specify if this is like the drink called boiled custard you find in The South around the holidays or the kind you eat with a spoon.  All in all I think it was pretty darn good considering all the changes I made and the over cooking. Great taste, and it freezes VERY nicely!!!  Like really good ice cream!

Being pregnant in the summer and craving boiled custard of all things made me try this recipe.  I didn't want to make the full 12 servings, in case it wasn't that good...no offense Angela...so the only thing I altered with this recipe was the serving size to 4.  After about 30 minutes of stirring, the custard finally started thickening up.  Looked like boiled custard...smelled like boiled custard...but when I tasted it, the egg was the only flavor to really come through.  I didn't feel like finishing off the egg shake I had made so I'll just wait until November 1st...when my local grocery store says they will carry it.

Pretty good- I took another reviewer's suggestion and added some flour for a thicker texture.  It took about 30 minutes to cook.  I also added about 1 tsp of almond extract before cooking and then served with kiwi, bananas, and oranges.

This is exactly what custard is suppose to taste like.  I held back a star because I prefer it a bit thicker.  If you used only egg yolks it would be, but then you'd have the hassle of extra whites hanging around.  So I think that this recipe would be improved with the addition of corn flour.  I used this as a base for ice milk and it works perfectly.

I wanted to be able to rate this higher, but following the directions and not changing anything yielded a wet soupy mess. The only way to get it thicker was to add a thickening agent (flour, cornstarch etc.,).

I made banana bread to run this weekend and wanted to make ice cream as a side. I used this recipe as a base. I added 2 tbls. Walnut oil, 1 tbls. Vanilla, cinnamon , nutmeg, 1 oz. amaretto , and about a cp. of crushed walnuts. Ice cream mixer for four hours, then freezer over night. It came out fantastic. You can use this for any flavor.

I made this to go with a pear cake I made. I subsituted half the milk for french vanilla cream and added 1/4 cup white sugar, and 3/4 unpacked brown sugar because I was out of white. But it turned out deliciously. and thickened beautifully.
