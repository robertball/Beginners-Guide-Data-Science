Followed the recipe *exactly.*  

They came out like rocks - I was sincerely concerned those eating would break a tooth. I should've known that boiling them before rendering would leach out all the moisture, but followed along nonetheless. 

Pork belly is my spouse's favorite meat and he had two bites and stopped eating. Complete waste of $15 meat.
