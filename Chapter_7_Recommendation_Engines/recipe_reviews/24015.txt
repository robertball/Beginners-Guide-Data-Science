It's been a long time since I posted this recipe. I'm glad others are enjoying it! 

These days I make it without any applesauce and just use the whole 15 oz can of pumpkin. Add a few spoons of water if it needed but keep in mind this batter is thick.

I also add 1/3 cup chopped walnuts and 1/3 cup dried cranberries (Craisins).

I cut the sugar back to 1 cup as well.

Both my husband and I love this bread!  We made a few changes, but it's fantastic as it is.  We substituted 1 cup of splenda for a cup of the sugar and used a total of one cup of whole wheat flour (non-pastry) and 2/3 cup all purpose flour.  We also added half of a cup of raisins and extra spices since we love cinnamon and nutmeg.  Super fast and easy to make - perfect for the holidays.

Another great recipe using flax.  I am always looking for good recipies that incorporate this fine source EFA's.  Flax adds a unique texture to this recipie that holds moistness and combines with the pumpkin for a great taste.  I added whole flax seed to the mixture for a more crunchy nutty flavor.

I was a little worried about this recipe when I poured the batter/dough into the bread pan. First, I must say that I had to substitute for the applesauce - I didn't have any. I didn't want to use oil, so I used plain yogurt (I know, not cool for vegans, but?). And, I used a whole can of pumpkin (15 oz.) instead of the 1 c. called for in the recipe. Since these two substitutions seemed to make the wet ingredients even wetter, I used a little more flour - a little over 3/4 c. regular wheat flour (I didn't have pastry flour) and about 1 1/4 c. bread flour. Because of these alterations, I also modified the spices and baking powder ever-so-slightly. So, why did I worry? There was a ton of batter! I probably could have put this into 2 pans. I didn't, though. What worried me even more is, when I dipped my finger in one of the spatula trails left in my mixing bowl and took a lick, it was pretty bland. I wondered if it was because this recipe uses a fraction of the sugar called for in other recipes or if I didn't add enough spices or what?! Well, I stuck some pecans in the top of my loaf and stuck it in the oven and hoped for the best. What came out was one of the BEST loaves of pumpkin bread ever! It was plenty sweet and otherwise flavorful and moist. It was beautiful! I can't wait to try it with applesauce and the pecans mixed right in (instead of just on top). Thanks so much for this wonderfully nutritious, low-fat, creature-friendly treat!

AMAZING! My son is allergic to milk and eggs which makes baking a challenge. He LOVES these muffins so I make them frequently. They are plenty sweet with only a 1/2 cup sugar and not too dense if you use all whole wheat pastry flour. We make 12 muffins instead of bread...baking for 18-20 minutes. Raisins are a nice touch too! THANK YOU, THANK YOU for a great recipe.

Excellent base and wonderfully moist, but had to make a LOT of changes before I got a "Wow!" response.  I upped the water to 8 tablespoons, added 2 tablespoons of molasses, used an entire 15-oz can of pumpkin and left out the applesauce altogether, reduced the sugar to 3/4 a cup of brown sugar, changed the flour to two cups of white spelt flour (can't eat wheat), upped the baking powder to a full teaspoon, and changed the spices and amounts--2 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1 teaspoon cloves, and 1/2 teaspoon ginger.  I kept the nutmeg the same, but changed the salt to a scant teaspoon, and I sprinkled the dough with brown sugar before baking.  I also divide the recipe between two 7x5 bread tins and bake them together for 47 minutes.  In the space of a week, I've made at least ten loaves, and my husband and friends have gobbled up every crumb!  The bread comes out very dense, very moist and plenty sweet, but when divided into 8 thick pieces per loaf, each piece only has 108 calories, almost no fat, and only 30 carbs--less than a small box of raisins.  Makes a delicious, filling afternoon snack!

This was fantastic! My boyfriend has high cholesterol, so I have been looking for healthy recipes and this certainly is. I used all whole wheat flour and only 1/2 cup of sugar as some of the reviews suggested. I also made muffins. All in all, they came out delicious! Thank you.

This is very good for how healthy it is!  It is somewhat chewy in texture.  I used mashed bananas instead of pumpkin, and it was very good.

This is great pumpkin bread! I was looking for recipes that had no dairy or egg in it and this one came up...I too have done what the previous reviewer mentioned and tried this with the Splenda/sugar baking mix and it was excellent as well.

My whole family loved this!  I did make a slightly healthier version.  I used 4T flax, only 1 C. sugar, the whole can of pumpkin, 3/4 C. applesauce, 1C. whole wheat flour and 2/3 C white flour.  Turned out very moist and just the right amount of sweet!

This bread turned out really dense and glue-y.  The only way to get it down was to slice it, butter it, and toast it.

I used a 12 cup muffin pan and the muffins were tasty.  The texture is a little gummy, but the outsides were crispy and the flavor was great.

I just pulled this out of the oven and let it cool down enough to have a slice, and it's very good. 

I made the following modifications: 
4 tablespoons of ground flax
1/3 cup sugar
1 can of pumpkin
2 chopped apples
all whole wheat flour (not pastry) 
Added a little extra spice

I think I went overboard on the cloves, as it's a little strong; next time I'll stick to the recipe on the spices. The sweetness is almost perfect, it wouldn't hurt if I had added more sugar but I'm really trying to cut sugar out of my diet. The apples that I added in are very chunky and moist and I think they make a nice addition to the bread and add some sweetness. I really like all of the healthy aspects of this bread and I think it will become a permanent addition to my recipe list :)

This was really good! It had a different texture then other pumpkin quickbreads but I guessed that it might. It was good right away but great the next day, in fact we thought it just kept getting better! Because it is more dense, it was hard to tell if it was done. I baked the loaf for 65 minutes and my tester came out clean but the top of the center pieces were a bit doughy so next time I will bake longer. I doubled the recipe and made 1/2 into muffins and used the other half for a loaf. I used a lg. can of pumpkin puree and reduced the sugar per other reviews. Thank you for the recipe!

These weren't too bad, but they probably aren't something I will make often. I was looking for something to use flax in, and they were fairly nutritous otherwise, so they do have some redeeming qualities. I substituted pumpkin butter for the applesauce, and added 1 T of oil to keep them from being rubbery. I cut down the sugar to 1 cup and didn't notice them not being sweet enough. These are something interesting to try anyways...

This has good flavor and impressive that it has no oil or eggs. My kids loved it. But it was a little too moist and rubbery for me. I also only added 1 cup of sugar, and that was more than sweet enough.  I would suggest using pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices. Way too much clove.

Good lowfat bread.  I used only 1 cup sugar, and it was sweet enough.  I also used 2/3 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 1 cup unbleached flour.

For best results, make a day ahead of time ! I concur with reviewers who say that the flavours develop over a 24 hour period. They do. I reduced the sugar becasue I knew I would make a glaze for the bread and I added a hint of vanilla to the batter.  The vanilla is not neceassary, I simply like vanilla.  The flax seed will give the bread a different crumb texture. Some have defined it as "gooey".  It is not "gooey", it is simply characteristic of flax. Yes, the bread is mosit. I recommend keeping a watchful eye on the baking process starting with the lowest cook time and increading it in increments of 5 mins, if needed. Your bake time will differ from oven to oven, obviously, and will also differ depending on the flour you use and the type of pan. I used a super shiny aluminum pan (Williams Sonoma) and lined it with parchment paper. The bread was done in about 50 minutes.  I do not recommend dark pans for baking anything.  With heavier batters, they tend to cook uneven. This is a good easy recipe. As an experienced cook, I recommend it.

Pumpkin quick bread has been a staple in our house, but with a little one with egg and dairy allergies, i wanted to try out a new recipe.  This was okay but I wasn't wow'd.  I found the bread to be much too sweet.  Even moreso than our traditional "unhealthy" recipe.  I think if we try it again, I will cut way back on sugar and increase spices.

AWESOME!  I used regular whole wheat flour and the texture was still great.  It was the PERFECT amount of sweetness and nuttiness with the flax.  I also added pecans.

not terrible. definitely tastes healthy/fibrous. i threw in some raisins - definitely a good call. you need at least raisins or walnuts in there, otherwise - you will just be very sad eating this. :(

This was incredibly simple and incredibly delicious. I took others' advice and only used about a cup of sugar (more than enough); I also used pumpkin pie spice since that's what I had on hand with a little extra cinnamon. I used all whole wheat flour and you can't tell the difference at all--King Arthur is my brand of choice. It's a very fine, delicate flour. It's very dense and moist in the middle. Next time I will probably add chopped pecans or walnuts to give it a little extra crunch.

I made this and found it a little too dense and missing something flavor wise.

this was an easy recipe to put together. I didn't add all the sugar, 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2. I added craisins on the top & a sprinkle of sugar before cooking. I was eager to try this right out of the oven. It looked done on the outside but was mushy inside. After it sat in the fridge it had the consistency of zucchini bread. VERY good! We argued over who got the last piece!

I was looking for a recipe that would be similar to the pumpkin loaf at St**bu**s Coffee, and this one did the trick!  The modifications I made were: 1C white flour & 2/3C whole wheat, 1C sugar, no cloves, but some allspice instead.  It was SO good, and WAY healthier than the coffee shop's pumpkin loaf- I should know, I work there.  It was FABULOUS!

This recipe is TO DIE FOR! Unfortunately I had to leave out the Flax seed meal, so I reduced the water to 4 tablespoons. Still, it came out to be the absolute, most delicious pumpkin bread I have ever tasted! I can't imagine ever eating a different kind after tasting this one. I must say though, a bit too much sugar (and that's saying a lot because I LOVE sweets!) and I even used Splenda. Next time I'm thinking of reducing to 1 cup of sugar. Also, I used only whole wheat flour. INCREDIBLE!!!

Very yummy and moist, I ate half the batch myself!  A great flax recipe.  Great add-in's may be raisens, whole flax seed, or apple chunks.  I made these into 12 muffins and baked them for 35 minutes, which was perfect.

Very good! I used white whole wheat flour, added one egg, and switched half the sugar for honey. I baked it in a 9x13 pan, and it made a delicious dense and moist breakfast bread.

This is a WONDERFUL dairy free & egg free recipe!
I used a bit more whole wheat flour & a little less all purpose flour than was called for to make the recipe more healthy and it still tasted great. I also used less than 1/3 cup sugar but I used homemade (unsweetened) applesauce, which was naturally very sweet, and I like my pumpkin bread more on the bread/hearty side than the sweet side.
I baked this for my 1yo. so I dropped the batter in lightly oiled mini muffin pans, preheat the oven @ 325 and baked them for about 15 minutes. They came out perfect. They are moist and soft and a great healthy breakfast or snack for my little one (and me). This recipe yielded a little over 2 dozen mini muffins so I plopped the extra batter on a greased cookie sheet and baked those the same way. They're not as pretty but they still taste great!

WOW! I love this bread. As with other reviewers, I cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup and used 1/2 cup oats, cutting back the white flour to one cup. I also cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. and replaced cloves with 1/4 tsp. allspice and threw in a few chopped walnuts.  I plan on making this bread frequently and can't wait to send some in my daughter's next college care package.

Oh my...wonderful!  I did make some slight changes, though -- added raisins (75g), and used orange juice for my liquid, and used all wheat flour.  I also subbed in fruit sugar (fructose) and only used 150g, and it was plenty sweet.  It tastes wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe! ^_^

I have children who are allergic to eggs, so this recipe is a godsend this time of year!  I made it as muffins, and they were so moist and yummy!  I also used only whole wheat pastry flour, so other than the sugar these muffins are very healthy!  You have to try them!

This is AMAZING bread. So moist and flavorful - and somehow it gets the nicest, sweet, slightly crunchy top on it when it bakes.

I've made it twice - and both times didn't have applesauce - so I just substituted all pumpkin. It's delicious.

Thanks for sharing such a healthy and tasty recipe!

Very delicious! An excellent vegan recipe. I'm not vegan nor do I like pumpkin pie but I LOVE this stuff. To make it even healthier I sub the sugar with Splenda and I used 1 cup whole wheat flour with 1/4 cup wheat germ. Because of those subs I did have to add a bit of water to make it a good consistency. I also added 1/2 cup chopped pecans. YuM!

Very moist and flavourful!   I had to substitute the applesauce because I was out, so I added a half cup of plain yogurt.  I also added walnuts and chopped dates and raisins.  They were a hit, will definitely make again.

This is way too sweet., so much so that I can't taste the pumpkin.  I gave it 4 stars because I think it would be excellent with that one adjustment.  Next time I will use 1 cup, or even less.

I am far from a "cook" but I am trying to learn with my 3 year old beside me.  We had no eggs and I didn't feel like going to the store and came across this recipe.  It was great!  Somewhat chewy but very moist and my 3 year old called it "cake".  Husband liked it too.  Quick, easy, yummy.  I will make this again for sure.

These were wonderful!  I made muffins, using a total of 2 cups of flours, including the flax meal, coconut flour, rye flour and unbleached.  I cut the sugar to 1/3 C per other recommendations.  I used a total of 2 teaspoons of spices; the recipe calls for more, and next time, I'll make sure to do that.  I had home-grown, pureed pumpkin in the freezer so I used a cup of that, and a 1/2 C plastic cup of applesauce.  Because I was making these for coworkers and because I knew that "fat-free" would have a different consistency (sticky / gummy), I added 1 egg and 2 T oil.  Once I started stirring and judging consistency, I knew that it would need a bit of liquid so I added 3 T cranberry juice (the straight stuff, NOT the juice cocktail!). I used 1/4 C batter and got 13 muffins (12 in paper liners in my muffin tins and the last in a silicon cup in the microwave like I do corn muffins...I would NOT recommend micro-cooking them in the future! that one WAS rubbery!). Coworkers loved them; boss, who makes whole-grain flax muffins, was impressed with the moistness (I'm crediting the pumpkin). I have a friend who's just been diagnosed with a number of food allergies (wheat, eggs, dairy...), and the recipe as written will work GREAT for her. Thanks so much for sharing!

I made mine with a whole can of pumpkin and no applesauce.  I also used pumpkin pie spice in place of the other spices.  I made as muffins.  The taste was very good so 5 stars - I just have to figure out the proper cooking time.  I baked for at least 28 minutes and they still seemed not done in texture but very tasty.  Will make again

I just made a batch! They are quite nice & tasty, and mild. I made muffins & I used a convection oven set at 350 for 28 min. I tried 20 min but they weren't done. I used 4 tbsp of water & 3 tbsp of molasses. I used 1 1/4 cup organic brown sugar.( not packed) I also used 2/3 cup Living Intentions Sprouted Flour
(Gluten free for those who need that.)  & 1 cup One Degree Organic Sprouted Whole Wheat. I used 2 tsp of baking powder & omitted the soda. I forgot to add the raisins! Darn it! Next time! I think if I had they would have given them a bit more sweetness & a 5 star plant strong rating. :-) Very nice recipe! Thanks.

Very good vegan bread recipe! It is very moist. I've tried it both with and without applesauce. I replaced the applesauce with vegetable oil in one version and it was delicious, though of course not as healthy as written. I also reduced the amount of cloves to 1/8 tsp, reduced the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp, increased the cinnamon to 2 1/2 tsp (don't do this unless you love cinnamon, it is very pronounced!!), and added 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger. We liked it with vegan cream cheese spread, whipped with a hand mixer with some additional cinnamon and a bit if vanilla extract! 

Also--my oven bakes VERY hot, and as other reviewers mentioned you may need to drastically reduce the timing. My bread was done at 35 minutes.

This tasted great.  Yes, it was gluey, but that's why the bread held together and didn't crumble and fall apart; the only way to make it un-gluey would be to add egg and butter and oil.  I also remade this using 1 cup applesauce and 3/4 cup pumpkin as that was what I had.  It turned out great either way.  This is a great recipe that you can change to suit your needs.  BE CAREFUL how long you bake this, however:  I left the first loaf in for 20 minutes and it was perfect.  I left the second one in for 30 minutes and it was burnt.  60-70 minutes would not have worked with my oven.

It's probably but own fault this didn't come out better as I did make quite a few substitutions (cut sugar in half and used sugar/splenda combo, all whole grain flour).  It was very difficult to cook fully in the middle even with mini loaves.    The tops got quite burnt.  Not likely to try again.

Unlike others, I think this actually needed a bit more sweetener for my taste, so next time I may use a blend of white and brown sugars. Texture was moist,not gummy.  I will probably add some toasted walnuts next time too.

Fantastic! I followed the recipe almost exactly (except substituted 1/2 c of the sugar with the equivalent of Stevia and used 1 c AP flour and 2/3 c ww flour) and the bread was so moist! I made mine into muffins, as I find it easier to get the 12 servings that way. Otherwise I don't quite get 12 slices out of the loaf! I baked them at 350 for 23 minutes. They came out great! Thanks for sharing.

This bread was amazing! I used a whole can of pumpkin, and 1/3 cup of applesauce. Only2/3 cup sugar. It tastes even better the next day :D

This is a fantastic recipe!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Except for adding 1/4 cup of pecans.  Next time I think I will leave out the applesauce though...it seemed to give it a little bit of a chewy texture and doesn't really add to the flavor.  Will definitely be making again and again!

This is my favorite recipe, I have made it several times this time with banana instead of pumpkin, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup wheat germ instead of wheat flour since I was out, and added 1/3 cup all purpose flour because I think I added too much bananas and it wasn't a very thick batter. Hope this helps someone out!! Enjoy the yumminess! Smile Always

Great healthy recipe. I used all whole wheat flour (I am sure it would be even better with some all purpose). I replaced 1/2 cup sugar with maple syrup and added 1 cup of raisins. I also used 1 and bit tsp pumpkin pie spice in place of other spices.

Oh my goodness was this delicious!  I just used the whole can of pumpkin b/c I didn't want to waste it and used only 1/4 C applesauce instead of the 1/2 C so that it wouldn't get to watery.  It turned out so moist, spicy, low fat and good for you. I will be making this again for sure!

Excellent!  I used a tart applesauce, and it added so much flavor- try it with the applesauce before you sub. in pumpkin.  The loaf is moist, fragrant, and you can taste each spice.  My kids ate half of it before it was even cooled off!

Mmmm this was so good!  I made the changes that ASTROPHE posted (no applesauce, whole can of pumpkin, 1 cup sugar). I also added 1/2 cup walnuts.  I was SO surprised by how moist this bread turned out with no oil!!!  Will definitely make again- next time I'll try using all whole wheat flour.  I baked mine for 65 minutes and the toothpick came out clean, but was a tad gooey in the middle when I cut into it an hour later.  Maybe it's just my oven, but I'd let it bake 5 minutes longer next time.  I'm skeptic of vegan baked goods normally, but was so pleasantly surprised by this recipe... try it- you will like it!

I had to cook it longer than stated, but I followed the recipe exact, made two loaves (a whole can of pumpkin, 15 oz.) and my house smells devine.  I only tasted a small piece (realized I wanted to put it back in the oven as it felt too moist) and it tastes good.  It is a very dense loaf.  Shocked at no eggs. :)

This was a hit in our house.  I made it into muffins.  They freeze well, and although they do not have a typical quickbread texture, they are a health variation.

Absolutely loved the recipe!  My daughter is allergic to milk and this was a hit for everyone!  We have made the recipe many times already. I did use 1 c whole wheat flour (not pastry) and 2/3 all purpose.  The first time I tried it with 1 cup sugar and the second time I tried it with 3/4 cup brown sugar instead.  Each was equally good!  We enjoyed them as muffins better in our family (4 yr old and 2-1 yr olds).  My husband enjoyed it when I split the recipe and put chocolate chips in half of them!

For being healthy, this is a great recipe.  I made two seperate batches.  the first was not too good.  i had the most success w/ the second batch. i used the applesauce (the first batch i used only pumpkin).  i think the a/s gives it extra moisture.  I also used more water in the second batch and it was much better.  very easy and very good!

This is a great, satifying treat - perfect for fall and the holidays ahead. This being my first experience using flax meal, I am thrilled with the results. Also, as far as sweetener,I used a half cup of brown sugar combined with a half cup of Splenda. The sweetness was just right for us. Also amped up the spices a bit and today am going to add a little maple extract. Thank you!

My sister and I were just starting on a different pumpkin bread recipe when we realized we were clear out of eggs!  So we looked for something eggless and found this!  It's great!  Ultra moist and tasty, everyone loved it.  We didn't bother with the applesauce, just used pumpkin for the full amount.  We also used pumpkin pie spice (alot) instead of all the individual spices and added raisins.  Mmmmm, we'll be making this again!

Delicious!  I've never made or had pumpkin bread before, but always wanted to try it.  I was about to make another recipe when I realized that I was clear out of eggs!  So I found this one and am I ever glad I did.  Based on the reviews I didn't use any applesauce and just replaced it with more pumpkin.  I added some raisins and instead of individual spices I put a lot of pumpkin pie spice.  I baked it for 40 mins in an 9 x 9 square pan because I didn't have any loaf pans, and it came out awesome!  So moist, and with great pumpkin flavor!  Absolutely delicious, and great texture too.  You would NEVER know it wasn't chock full of oil and is eggless.  I am impressed, and I'll make this again!

This was pretty good. It was a bit chewy though. I was a tiny bit short on pumpkin, so I added a little extra applesauce. I'm not sure if that would make a difference. Other than that, I used regular whole wheat flour. It's not as good as a 'fatter' version, but it is definitely healthier!

This was so yummy! I recently gave up dairy. I used real pumpkin (verses canned) and it was so tasty! I forgot to add the spices in the batter until I'd already poured it in the pan so I just sprinkled some cinnamon on top and it was perfect.

I tried to make this in the breadmaker on the quickbread setting...and it was a mistake!  It was undercooked and rubbery, so I wouldn't recommend trying that.  The flavor was good, but the texture was not.  I will have to try it again in the oven sometime.

I thought this bread was delicious and really easy to make! I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1 C whole wheat flour, and 2/3 C all purpose. I also cut back the sugar to 1/2 C, added a little extra pumpkin, and threw in a handful of chopped walnuts. Both my fiance` and I agreed - DELICIOUS!

I thought this was great. It is light and well leavened very unlike vegan baked goods I have tried in the past. It is great as written or one can easily reverse the proportions of white to whole wheat flour and half the sugar and still have a very tasty bread. I have also added grated carrot and/or grated zucchini with excellent results. Any way you like it is a very nice treat with a cup of coffee or green tea.

This vegan bread is wonderful! I cooked mine for just 45 minutes and the result was a very moist treat. Top with a little butter and cinnamin/sugar and even my husband will eat it! ;) Can't wait to make this on a beautiful Autumn morning...

This was exactly what I was looking for! I cute the sugar to 3/4c, and upped the whole wheat four by an additional 1/3 c. I made 12 muffins and baked for 25 minutes... Awesome!

This has become my favorite quickbread recipe.  I have made it many times for parties, pot lucks, brunches, etc.  I always get great feedback - people can't believe there are no eggs or oil/butter in it!  It's so good you won't believe it's also so healthy!  I like to use about half the sugar called for and serve it with apple butter. Mmmmmmm....

Love this! Made it for Thanksgiving using a the Voicipe app, which read the directions while I prepped. I used half the sugar and it still came out moist and delicious!

I have finally found the pumpkin bread recipe I’ve been looking for.  It’s moist and so flavorful.  Granted, I had to alter from the original recipe (I know, I know....) because I don’t keep wheat flour and I didn’t have applesauce (I thought I did.  I used all-purpose flour and a full can (15 oz.) of pumpkin purée.  I also added raisins.    The consistency of the baked bread was a tiny bit rubbery but that may be because I didn’t use a bread flour  or because I stirred the batter too much.  I welcome input if anyone can confirm my hunches.

Another keeper recipe! Please do add the word "Vegan" in the Recipe title. I ended up using Coconut Oil instead of Canola Oil since I didn't have any on hand. Baked it in a disposable aluminum foil pan that is slightly smaller than the size recommended, lightly sprayed with non-stick oil all over for easy removal. It puffed up really nicely & was super moist!

This recipe is delicious just the way it is!  Even the non-pumpkin lovers in my family LOVE this bread.  No one in my family is vegan, but my youngest son is allergic to lots of foods including eggs.  I love it when I can make a recipe all 6 of us can enjoy.

I accidentally used a tablespoon of ground cinnamon instead of a teaspoon. I also added half a teaspoon of ground pumpkin spice for an extra kick.

The mixture was extremely easy to blend and took little to no elbow grease to make it smooth and creamy. I let the bread sit for about 5 minutes after taking it out of the oven.

It was extremely moist, but I think the extra cinnamon and personal touch of pumpkin spice was almost necessary to ensure the "pumpkin" stood out.

I made this last night because I had some leftover pureed pumpkin and wanted to make something relatively healthy with it. The only change I made was using 1/2 cup of Splenda in place of 1/2 cup of the sugar, and adding a little more pumpkin and a little less applesauce. And this bread is GOOD. It's moist, it's well spiced, and pumpkin-y. Oh yeah, I added a few mini chocolate chips to appease my kids, but it would have been good without, too.

Fantastic!  Followed the update from Astrophe and used the whole can of pumpkin and no applesauce.  Also increased whole wheat flour to 2/3 c. and white down to 1 c.  Will probably use all whole wheat and some add'l gluten next time. Blended whole flax seeds in the blender to make flax seed meal. Made 12 muffins that were delish!

Fantastic bread. I often make a pumpkin muffin (not vegan) that my family really likes, so I was not sure about this, but I am SO glad I made it. It is really good for you compared to traditional versions and is so moist and delicious. Some vegan things forgo the texture, but this one is SUPER. A for sure keeper. I ground the flax seed in my flour mill and will try that more in recipes for a little "kick" of healthy. Thank you ASTROPHE for submitting this one!

I made these into muffins and they did come out very dense.  Next time I will also add more spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves) the listed amount just isn't enough for me.  A very good, healthy alternative though!  I didn't use any applesauce and used wheat flour (nonpastry)

I took the advice of a previous poster and used AP, WW and wheat germ.  I also subbed apple pie spice and used Turbinado sugar (white sugar is NOT vegetarian).  The texture was a little too chewy, so I might try to decrease the applesauce.  I'll be making again soon...this time adding chopped pears or apples and nuts.  Thanks for a quick vegan sweet bread recipe!

Very good, definetly need's more spices though. I almost doubled the cinnamon and I may add more next time I make this. I used one cup ww flour, 1/2 bleached flour and 1/4 cup wheat germ, also added the whole can of pumpkin. I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup and added 1/3 cup honey. I sprikled saltless sunflower seeds on top before baking. Great (and tasty) way to add some flax seed into your diet.

WOWWWW!!! This bread is simply amazing. I have another recipe I've been using for years with lots of sugar, oil, and eggs. So when I found this one and saw all the rave reviews, I had to try it for myself. Mixing flax meal with  water is a perfect egg substitute. I also added 1/3 cup chopped walnuts and 1/3 cup craisins. I subbed 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice for nutmeg and cloves. Most healthy breads are not moist, and very unflavorful. This one will fool everyone! I can't wait to share it with family this Thanksgiving!

I thought this was excellent because it was very moist and pumpkin pie-ish. I added extra spices because I always do, along with walnuts, craisins, coconut, and chocolate chips and the result was delicious. Next time, I would omit the chips because it was so delicious on its own and the chocolate almost detracts from the wonderful pumpkin flavor. The coconut was a very nice tough though. Great recipe; thank you

I love this bread.  I made a few changes to the recipe and it came out well.  I used 1/4 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet for me.  Also, I used just more pumpkin instead of apple sauce, and another time tried some left over prune puree instead of the apple sauce.  Both times worked out well. I am thinking of trying it out as a cake for a vegan birthday party - just have to figure out the icing...

This came out really tasty.  I don't usually make vegan baked goods - the texture is really dense and drier/less oily than most similar breads, but I sort of liked that.  And I love how healthy it is!  I made it with a butternut squash that was given to me.  I couldn't find sugar-free applesauce (living in Australia) so I just tried to add more squash as people have suggested.  Looking at the recipe author's own tweaks, I cut back the sugar to 1 cup, and half of that was brown sugar.  I would love to try it again with the applesauce this time, if I can find it!

My family really likes this Pumpkin Bread.  It has no eggs or shortening yet comes out moist and delicious and rises well. A great recipe for someone who has an allergy to eggs or is looking for a heart-healthy recipe.  I added one-third cup of raisins and one-third cup of chopped walnuts.

Pretty good.  I have been having a cravaing for pumpking bread for a while.  I added raisins and this is really good and simple - great with a little natural peanut butter on top.  The flax seed meal is a great egg replacement (my son is highly allergic to egg, so i wanted a recipe that i could make in our egg-free house) and i really liked it.  I did drop the sugar to about 2/3 of a cup as suggested by some others - it was just right. Just a side note - i tried the version of this bread offered by KychynWych and it isnt a pumpkin bread at all - it is essentially a gingerbread - i ended up throwing the loaves out :(  If you want a typical pumpkin bread, dont try that version.

This bread is outstanding! Ever since I made it for the first time I have made it over and over. I have significantly cut the sugar (down to about 2/3 of a cup) and I think it tastes delicious that way.  I have also added cranberries and chopped walnuts (sometimes together, sometimes just one or the other) and it has tasted delicious. Definitely recommend this recipe to others!

I halved the sugar to make this recipe more of a bread than a dessert, and it was delicious!  My only problem was that the consistency-- the bottom half rose and the top half became condensed.  This is heavenly warmed in the oven a topped with some almond butter.  A definite repeat recipe, though I will have to work on how to achieve a better consistency.  Thank you so much!

I have made this twice, and both times I followed the directions exactly and the loaf was very gummy and chewy. The 2nd time, as soon as the loaf was cooled, I sliced it and left it uncovered overnight, hoping that would help dry it out a little, which it did.  Has anyone else had this "gummy" problem? I'd love to read your solutions.  Thanks!

Holy smokes! I can't believe how tasty and moist this is! I said 'no butter?! no oil?!' I made it just like the recipe said, no changes, and it was so moist and flavorful. Next time I might try trading more of the white flour for the wheat and see how well that tastes.

WOW! This quickbread taste like it is full of fat. I added some vanilla, used 1/3 the sugar and the rest was erythritol and a dash of Sweet and Low brown sugar and it was just perfect. This also made great muffins and you would never know there was any flax in it. This is a keeper!

This is wonderful!  I reduced the time and made muffins, threw them in the freezer.  We take a couple of them out of the freezer and warm them in the microwave for 40 seconds.  Yum.  My son, who rarely comments on food, asked me to make them again!

This recipe is awesome as is, and with any personal touches.  I made 2 batches to start with - 1 as written with a loaf and it was perfect (just cut back the sugar by a quarter and subbed half the sugar for splenda).  The other I added a 1/4c unsweetened cocoa powder to it and made mini muffins and they were phenomenal!  The best part about this recipe is that it's so moist and delicious and really good for you, too.  This is such a great Fall treat!!

Yummy!  I loved this moist, good healthy bread.  I only used 3/4 cup of sugar, added a little more cinnamon and a little vanilla.  I am going to try to up the whole wheat pastry flour next time, but this was so good.  Mine cooked in a shorter time- like just 50 minutes.

Really Yummy.  I replace 1 cup of sugar with granulated splenda.  Sliced the loaf into 12 slices and individually wrapped each slice and froze for quick breakfast.  Was worried that the bread would be rubbery because of the lack of fat in the recipe, but its very moist and flavorful.  I baked for only 50 minutes.

These were awesome!!! I've been trying to eat healthier so these are perfect. I did make a few changes. I added about a tsp of wheat germ.. however next time I will prolly add more. I used 1 cup all-purpose and 2/3 cups whole wheat flour (trying to make it a little healthier, will try working my way up to whole wheat since I just started eating like this). I made these into muffins so I can wrap individually and put in the freezer to put my lunches later. I added a little brown sugar on top to some of them which makes them just a little better but still great without it. I also tried added raisens. The muffins are very moist and delicious and easy to make ahead and freeze. Good grab and go snacks! Permenatly on my list of foods to make!

Wow - delicious.  I used 1 1/3 whole wheat flour and 1/3 white flour, and I did not have any flax seed meal, so I used wheat germ.  Also, I left out 1/2 cup of sugar, and it was still plenty sweet.  Thank you!  I was so happy to find a vegan pumpkin bread recipe!

I TRIPLED THE RECIPE since I only had a big can of pumpkin puree (and no other pumpkin recipes I felt like making at the time) and made medium loaves as my reg. large loaf pan is MIA. 1 can of pumpkin puree makes a triple batch and when I did that I lowered the sugar only by 1/2 a cup total and only used 12 TBSP of water instead of 18 (since a can of puree is technically 3 1/2 cups I felt that was enough moisture in the batter). It was excellent, not too sweet-just right! I also used brown and white sugar in the recipe instead of only white sugar. Also added dried cranberries to the batter. Gave one of the 4 medium loaves to my neighbor and they too LOVED IT! I love when I find dairy/egg/soy free recipes because I can make them for my kids who can not have dairy and share the recipe with family members who have dairy/egg/soy allergies.
Yes, I changed it quite a bit, but I don't usually follow recipes to a T.

So moist with no fat!  I did make a few changes to make it even healthier (and reduced by 40 cal/serv).  Reduced sugar to 1/2c sugar, 1/4c molasses, 1/4c Splenda.  Added whole can of pumpkin and disregarded applesauce.  Reduced white flour to 1c and added 1/3c wheat germ.  Fabulous!

If you're looking for a super moist, spicy, and healthful pumpkin bread, look no further! This is a dream come true! I "healthified" it (as I do with most recipes) by using 1c whole wheat flour, 1/3c all-purp flour, and 1/3c whole wheat pastry flour. I also used only 1/2c (heaping) white sugar and 1/2c brown sugar, and it was plenty sweet! I did not level the spoons of spices, since I wanted a bit more 'zing.' I also added a dash of allspice and ginger... All in all, this will be served for breakfast all year long in my home!

Yum, yum, yum.  I got applause for this recipe.  I added raisins and walnuts (1/3-ish cup each).  

Whether you like her or not, I was shocked to hear one skeptical family member tell me it looked like something from Martha Stewart!  Definitely didn't tell the family it was so healthy before they tasted it.  ;)

This bread is phenomenal. So healthy, so delicious... I made one loaf, but it was gone by that night so I made two more. I took people's advice and put in a little more wheat flour, applesauce, and pumpkin and less sugar, and it still tasted amazing. Great with peanut butter on top. I would make this again. And again. And again...

I altered this recipe by ONLY using regular Splenda - not the Splenda baking mix.  I wouldn't suggest doing this. It is edible but sort of rubbery and has an aftertaste. I used two cups instead of 3 cups of splenda (I doubled the recipe) and it was more than sweet enough.  Just wanted to caution people considering doing a complete Splenda replacement that this may not be a great idea.  However, if you are diabetic, it isn't awful, so it may be worth trying if you absolutely can't have sugar.

Marvelous. I loved this. I was looking for a lowfat, no butter version - delicious! Crisp, chewy outside, moist inside, and the flavor is a perfect amount of spice. I love the flavor. I also cut the sugar to 1 c., replaced the applesauce with more pumpkin, and used all whole wheat flour (no white or pastry flour). Oh, and I used fresh cooked pumpkin that I pureed in the food processor. So good.

A great pumpkin bread.  A bit denser and moister than I usually like my breads, but delicious.  I cut the sugar to 3/4 of a cup and used a little less than 1 c. pumpkin (I divided one can between two loaves), but otherwise followed the recipe.  So yummy!

After reading the reviews, I also reduced the sugar to just under 3/4 cup brown sugar, added more spices, and chopped walnuts.  I also substituted over half of the all purpose flour with whole wheat flour.  It turned out great, and next time I will only use whole wheat flour and more pumpkin and applesauce.  I have shared this recipe with a lot of vegan and nonvegan friends, and it is the only one that we make!

Very yummy. Only modifications I made were to add raisins and sprinkle flax seeds on the top. I think the next time  around I'll use Splenda baking mix, as another reviewer mentioned, to cut the sugar content a little. Fairly easy, too, as breads go.

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE!! I LOVE TO TRY MANY DIFFERENT PUMPKIN BREAD RECIPES...THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST! IT CAME OUT SO MOIST & DELICIOUS.  I ONLY CHANGED A FEW THINGS. I SUBSTITUTED OAT FLOUR FOR THE WHEAT FLOUR(DIDN'T HAVE ANY)AND ALLSPICE FOR THE NUTMEG.  IT WAS SO GREAT & THE FLAX IS SUCH ANY ADDED BONUS!! EVEN MY 12 YEAR OLD SON LOVED IT (HE HELPED ME MAKE IT) AND THAT IS A RARIETY (HEE HEE)!!  THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE..WILL DEFINATELY MAKE THIS AGAIN & AGAIN & AGAIN!!  YUMMY!!! :)

Great recipe - I made this a while ago and about to make it again because my boyfriend requested it.  I added raisins and chopped walnuts for extra fun.  I eyeballed the baking time (I think it went a little longer than the recipe called for) but I had no problem with the texture of the bread - on the dense side but very moist and delicious!

This is fabulous- as moist, rich, and spicy as any pumpkin bread out there, and much much better for you.  I'll add raisins and maybe walnuts next time to make it more interesting.
