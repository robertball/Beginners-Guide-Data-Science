Other than using Ghiardelli chocolate (no offense, Baker's) I didn't--and wouldn't--change a thing. Perfectly chewey and fudgey.

I just made this recipe this afternoon! I followed the recipe except i prefer to use baking cocoa. 3 tbs. of cocoa and 1tbs. of shortening or oil equals one square, so 12 tablespoons cocoa and 4 tablespoons oil or shortening equals four squares of baking chocolate! I only like to use powder because I always have it on hand. Delicious!

BEST. BROWNIES. EVER.  
These are really great!  The flavor is a little buttery, but it really compliments the chocolate flavor.  If you would prefer a less buttery taste, you could probably do half butter and half canola oil.  I added about 1 teaspoon of instant coffee and topped them with "Hard chocolate Glaze" which is also here at A.R.  I will always make these instead of buying a box from now on!  LOVE!!!

I consider myself a very good cook, and an awful baker.  But these were foolproof!  LOVED them!  Very brownie like - dense and super moist and chocolatey.  I had a little mishap with the vanilla and added a bit more (please refer back to note on being an awful baker;o)    - probably had 2-3 tbsp of vanilla.  I also added about 2 tablespoons of brewed coffee.  I find it makes the chocolate flavor a little more complex.  I omitted the nuts - I'm not a fan.  FInally, when they were done, I piped about a half cup of nutella over the top and sprinkled with about 1/4 cup of chocolate chips.  Put them back in the oven for about 3 minutes.  They were wonderful!!!!!!!  Thank you!

This recipe is great! I have been making these for years and they are the basic delicious brownie. I usually just lightly dust these with powdered sugar. I make these with nuts, plain, and also add milk chocolate chips. I used plastic cookie cutters to cut these, which makes a nice presentation. So easy, but yet so simply delicious :)

The first problem I had was the size of the pan. Once I saw the amount of batter I had I knew I should have used an 8x8. I did use the 13x9 as suggested and the brownie mix barely covered the pan.  I followed the recipe exactly, and while these were in the oven I could hear sizzling. The entire top of the brownies were covered in a bubbling mess of butter! I spooned off as much as I could, and let them cool. My hubby and I tasted them and they were SO bitter! What a waste of ingredients!

Positively delicious!!!! This made the moistest fudgiest brownies I have ever made at home. I used walnuts, but next time I will leave them out at hubby's request. Everyone raved over this batch of brownies. This was sooo easy, all mixed in 1 bowl, which I liked.

This is the best brownie recipe out there. I use this as the base for regular brownies, cheesecake brownies, caramel brownies, and loaded brownies.   It consistently yields moist, chewy, dense brownies.

I think this has the potential of a 5 star, but I cooked the 30 minutes and that was too long so they were a bit dry.  I'm thinking the pan might be a bit large for the amount of batter which could have contributed to the dryness.  Other than that they had great flavor!

This is my go-to brownie recipe after several years of trying different things. I never add nuts. I always under bake. Occasionally I add chocolate chips, or bittersweet chocolate pieces, bits of candy bar or a little instant espresso into the butter and chocolate mixture.

The texture of these brownies is great.  But I didn't like the buttery taste at all.  I think that this recipes calls for too much butter, but I thought I would give it a try.  It was not a success for me. I also used a 8x8 pan.

These are the best!  I think brownie mixes are one of the few things that taste really good NOT made from scratch, and these taste just as good.  They are also just as easy, but with the added benefits of being cheaper and not having all those unidentifiable ingredients.

A very good GO-TO brownie.  They are rich and soft inside, with a nice little crispiness on the top and sides.  Nice and sweet.  They were so gooey that they were difficult to cut.  I baked mine in an 8X8 glass pan at 325 for I think it was about 50 minutes and they were perfect--I think they would be too short/flat in a 9x13.  Expect to really like them, but they are not the BEST I have ever made.  (But the best brownies I ever made were time consuming and the recipe had many steps.  Not something I would make often.)  I gave these brownies five stars because they are really good, really easy, people will like them, it's what you expect from a brownie, and I think the results are pretty consistent.  These are the ones you whip up when the kids need two pans for school or someone has a sudden brownie craving, or you want a to send a pan over to the neighbors.

Moist! Baked just 30 minutes. I skipped the foil, did not have enough, just greased the pan and came out fine.  Brought a batch to work and got rave reviews.  Used store bought milk chocolate frosting on top.

These are the BEST homemade brownies ever!  I usually leave out the walnuts, (I'm just not a fan of crunchy things in my brownies) and I use a 1/2 cup of butter and a 1/4 cup of veg. oil - the brownies come out chocolaty and moist, with a real nice, subtle buttery flavor.

I've made this twice already. The first time I mis-measured the amount of chocolate and I had to throw them out. But I tried again, paying more attention, and everyone loved them! I used 4oz of 100% cacoa and 1oz of regular baking chocolate and decreased the flour by about 1/2 cup. Delicious!!!!!

I use chocolate chips and cut down on the sugar. Instead of nuts, I used chopped snickers minis for something a bit special. Turned out wonderful! They are very moist brownies.

I made these fabulous brownies and brought them to work to share.  They are by far the fudgiest delicious brownies I have ever had.  I added some chocolate chips to the mix for a little more chocolaty excitement.  Thanks Bakers!

I always seem to come back to this recipe for a good, basic brownie recipe.  If I choose to use nuts I usually prefer walnuts, though.  These are also good with a handful of chocolate chips sprinkled on top, or I sometimes add one more square of chocolate.  I wouldn't do much more than that, though, because the simpler, the better with these!

I was very surprised to get very soggy, buttery brownies despite such rave reviews for the recipe. I did not think much of the recipe...

I have to agree with the one reviewer who said it was too buttery.  The texture was good however.  I think Katy Brown was right when she said that the best brownies come from a box mix.  I have not had a better brownie than Ghiardelli boxed brownie mix.

Fudgey brownies that were as easy to make as those in the box. Super sweet. Could use less sugar and be fine.

I have these baking right now, but I can already tell they are going to be awesome. I followed the recipe except I used powdered cocoa and shortening instead of the baking chocolate because that's all I had on hand. I melted those things in a small sauce pan with the butter (used smart balance) then mixed that in with the sugar in a bowl. mixed in 3 eggs worth of egg beaters and vanilla with a beater then mixed in the flour and nuts (walnuts). Definitely use a 9x9 or 8x8 square pan. 9x13 would be way too large. The batter tasted EXCELLENT! I've made a lot of brownie recipes from this site and none of them are every very good. I think this one might be the winner!

I've been using this recipe for years and I am always pleased with it.  I do make one change and that is the pan size.  A 13x9 is too small in my opinion, I use an 8x8 for a thicker brownie.  I also remove the brownies BEFORE a toothpick comes out clean or they are over baked.  When a bit of batter is still sticking to the toothpick they should be taken out of the oven as they will continue to bake a bit out of the oven.  The aluminum foil is a MUST too. I prefer roasted almonds to any other nut but of course that is optional.

These are fantastic.  Too fudgy for me, next time I'll reduce Baker's chocolate.  Tastes like melted chocolate chips in the middle, very rich, I wouldn't frost these.

was a good brownie but after I halved the recipe to serve 12 it barely satisfied 6, plus it was tricky to time the baking, I rescued them just in time afer just under 20 minuted.

These were simply delicious--fudgy, and the nuts were a wonderful contrast to the chocolate!
