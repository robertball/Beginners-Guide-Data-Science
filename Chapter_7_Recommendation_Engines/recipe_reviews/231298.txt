This was easy and tastier than anything I've made before.  I rate it a 5 but my wife and son said 4 - so 4 it is.  We will be making it again.  We didn't have the arbol peppers so next time we will be sure to find those and that will likely give it the pop worth a full 5 rating.

I made this for my daughterâ€™s grad party and friends and family alike loved it!  It was gone within a few minutes from me putting it out.  Speaking as someone who has never made guacamole before, I was amazed at how easy it was to make!

Living in central California, I have had more variations of guacamole from different areas of Mexico than I can count. This is an authentic, delicious recipe worth doing again and again!
