This was good.  I boiled the potatoes and carrots (because of other reviews stating that the the potatoes were under done) for about 10 minutes, then followed the specified roasting times.  The dish came out great.  I also added about a cup of diced celery too.

I admit: I hardly follow a recipe once I've mastered it, often adding a little bit of this and that to make it better.  I often make roasted veges, using this as my base recipe. I omit the lemon juice and use a lot of dried herbs instead (oregano, basil and sometimes, paprika to add some spice).  I also like to mix the veges in the herb oil mixture before spreading them on the roasting pan, just to make sure that the veges are evenly coated.  Yummy roasted veges!!

This was delicious! I didn't have eggplant or red pepper so I used cauliflower instead and threw in a couple garlic cloves whole. Before serving I drizzled a little balsamic vinnegar over the veggies.  Thank you for sharing!

I have made these 3 times in the last two weeks. They are easy and so tasty. I left out the eggplant (personal preference) and didn't miss it a bit.

I think the timing is off on this one. I put my carrots only in the oven first for a half an hour and then added the rest of the vegies. In the end, the carrots were still crispy and the rest of the vegies were over done. Maybe I should have par-boiled the carrots first.

This was okay.  A tad more oil than I would have prefered and my BF thought it had too much garlic.  I love garlic so I didn't really agree with that.  Also, I used a regular oven and didn't see until afterwards that the recipe recommends a convection oven.  My vegetables were still very firm.  I'm sure it would have tasted much better had I cooked it longer.

This dish is wonderful.  It went will with a roast turkey I made!  I added all of the vegetables at the same time before tossing with the marinade, they cooked up really nice.

I don't know if it's because I have a regular oven, but some of the vegetables took WAY longer than indicated in the recipe. Despite the fact I boiled the baby carrots for 5 mins before roasting them, they were virtually raw, as were the potatoes which I had diced small. This was after over an hour in the oven. I will try this again with less rosemary, more garlic, and DEFINITELY no eggplant - I have decided once and for all that I hate it any shape or form.  Thanks, Maryanne!

I really loved this! I agree that I found the timing off when it comes to the potatos and carrots, so had to do them for a bit longer. I would also recommend that you add some chicken strips/pieces to this dish (make extra of the oil and marinate first) as it compliments the dish really well.

Great recipe. Although I'd probably cook the potatoes a bit first. It took SO long.

Nice and easy to make, but some of the vegetables burnt a little; this could be due to me having to use an unfamiliar oven.

It's nice to have good tasting veggies for a change!  Each flavor is distinct but they all taste good together.  I served it with breadsticks.  Yummy!

This was pretty good. I couldn't taste the lemon juice, next time I would use more. It needs a lot of salt and pepper to help with the flavor.
