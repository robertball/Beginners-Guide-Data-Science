I must say these are different Im not sure if I love them I may try them again and tweak the igredients. At first it looks like there is no way these will fry up and stay together but they did. My daughter who is 14 said they are a 4 star!

I've made this before using fresh corn and it was delicious! I used frozen corn this time, and it was still good, not quite as amazing though. It was exactly what i wanted to substitute for cornbread tonight!

Excellent!  I added a chili garlic paste for that "umph" per another reviewer's suggestion, and it was just the ticket.  Thanks for the recipe: it was a late night treat.

Good basic recipe but needs more flavour.  Add minced onion and/or green pepper, mild tabasco sauce and more salt. The batter was too dry - added 1/3 cup milk and 3 T. flour for a smoother batter.

Bland and dangerous - the fresh corn was full of moisture and kept exploding. 

This needs some tweaks.
