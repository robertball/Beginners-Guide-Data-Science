Hello all!  As the submitter of this recipe I wanted to point out you should use a lasagna pan not a  9 x 13 dish as stated here.  Lasagna pans are  a bit larger and you'll have issues with it bubbling over if you use a smaller pan.  Happy cooking!

I love lasagna and I'm always on the lookout for a new recipe.  I was cautious about this recipe since it only had two reviews, but the ingredients seemed fabulous so I thought I'd try it - I am VERY glad I did!  This was the best lasagna I've ever made, and easy too!  I followed the recipe completely, only adding more mozzarella.  I did follow the tip about using a larger pan - I used a ceramic lasagna pan and it fit great.  Also, for those of you that have a limited produce section, Baby Bella's are the same as cremini mushrooms.

I recently was made aware that two of my precious angels didn't like ricotta. About the same time, I read in a book a reference to lasagna w/ bechamel sauce, so thought that might take the place of the ricotta. Oh, yes, it did. Family loved it and only requested that I add more Italian sausage. Obviously, I left out the ricotta. Oh, and I added lots of garlic. Took some to another family and child there wanted to know why my lasagna was better than his mom's. Guess I have learned that everyone doesn't like ricotta. Wonderful recipe!

Very good, I doubled the sausage, added some hot pepper flakes and used a whole 8 oz bin of mushrooms but other that i followed the receipe.  Definetly use a deep deep deep lasagna dish.

This was fabulous!  I loved the addition of the bechamel sauce.  Next time, I would add a lot more Italian sausage.

Really good. After reading reviews I used a 13 x 15 pan since I did not have a "lasagna" pan. I used more noodles because of the bigger pan, I also doubled the sausage and used more mushrooms. I did not increase the liquid and it did not need it.  Everyone really loved it and those that don't like mushrooms did not even realize they were in there. The only complaint my husband had was that he likes more meat. I would definitely make this again doubling the meat again (so 4 times the amount recommended).

This lasagna was definitely out of my comfort cooking zone but it came out delicious. I did use a mix of Italian Chicken sausage and Hot Italian Pork sausage. In my Béchamel sauce I used Almond milk because I don't drink regular milk. Its rich and yummy boyfriend approved.

To be honest, this wasn't as fabulous as I was expecting.  I followed the recipe as written, with the small exception of adding some Parmesan to the bechamel (it seemed flavorless).  For such a decadent recipe, I expected something more...  fabulous.  It's good, don't get me wrong, but not something I would prepare as a special meal for company.

This is, hands down, the best lasagna I have ever eaten. I've made it several times now and there are always some guests that tell me that this is the best they've eaten as well. I make it exactly as the recipe is written.

I made it for Mother’s Day.  There were only five of us so I had lots left over, sent some home with others.  Rave reviews from everyone!!!  It was delicious!  The bechamel sauce gives it a richness and cuts the acidity of the tomato sauce.  I omitted the mushrooms but added chopped fresh spinach.  I will make it again but will probably cut the recipe in half.  Not only was it delicious, it was a beautiful presentation.

Loved it!  I used 1 lb. of sausage instead of half, used cottage cheese  because I didn't have ricotta.  Will make it again.
