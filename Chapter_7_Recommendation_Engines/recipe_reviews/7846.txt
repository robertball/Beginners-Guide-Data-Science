What a delicious quick dessert to make. I used Cherry Icecream with whole cherries in it and this cake was a hit!! I'm going to make Raspberry Sorbet in my icecream maker next time and try a raspberry version. Yummy!!!

my mother used to make this but cut the angel food cake into 5 thin layers and added fresh strawberries and and drizzles of choc sauce on each layer and then froze it for a couple hours while we made dinner and ate. it was after doing the dishes we had dessert. drizzle a little choc sauce over each slice. i hadn't thought about this cake in years. thanks marilynrg

So I took some liberties but stayed true to the concept (kinda). I decided to use the vanilla creme cake and purchased Blue Bell vanilla ice cream (boy am I glad it was on sale so good!). I cut the pound cake into three layers. Layered with cake ice cream cake ice cream and last layer of cake. Froze to firm up the ice cream. Then I spread cool whip like icing all over cake and added decorations (was my daughter's birthday cake). EVERYONE not only loved it but were highly impressed that I'd made it! The cool whip hide the fact that it looked messy due to my imperfect technique (first time doing something like this). It came out so delicious and easy!! Next time I'll try the chocolate creme cake and rocky road ice cream. The possibilities are endless!

Great recipe! As suggested by other reviewers I sliced the angel food cake with a serrated knife and then Just pick your favorite ice cream and toppings and go crazy! Do prepare the day before and put on the freezer take it out when you serve dinner or about a an hour before you need to serve it. I ve made this three (3) times and friends keep asking me to make more! You can make a sauce to complement the ice cream you used if you want to be fancy and/or the occasion demands it (use chocolate syrup for kids!). Last time (for a friend s 40th) I used strawberry sauce (laced with wine) to soak the cake it was really nice. Thank you! I don t have to bake cakes anymore!!!!!

Today was my daughter Ashley's birthday and she loves angel food cake. As much as I love cooking that's how much I loathe baking which was one of the reasons this recipe caught my eye. I'm sure both of my Oma's are looking down in despair! Anyway like others I changed it up a bit. Instead of breaking up the cake I split it put the ice cream on the bottom layer topped it and glazed it with "Tunisianswife's chocolate glaze on this site. This was a great start Susan and we all (especially Ash) thank you for simple but delicious submission!

This is delicious! I just made it for a birthday cake and used strawberry ice cream and added confetti sprinkles to the batter for a festive look. I did make a modification however--instead of layering I just mixed the angel food chunks in with the ice cream. Thanks for the great recipe!

I sliced the angel food cake into three layers and used vanilla ice cream to construct the dessert on a plate. I froze overnight and then applied a layer of raspberry sherbet - kind of like a (raspberry) creamsicle. Served with a simple raspberry sauce everyone loved it!

This cake came out great except that you can see all the imperfections in the cake on the sides from the layers of icecream and ripped up cake. Also if and when you put icing on the cake it doesn't go over too well on the sides and gets quite messy.

I thought this was great! I had to add a little something though! I made homemade Ben & Jerry's Strawberry ice cream and bought an Angel Food Cake from WholeFoods. Layered it in a class bread pan...angel food dry quaker oats ice cream...repeat! IT WAS DELICIOUS...i absolutely love oatmeal in pretty much anything and it worked great with this. I find that even though it doesn't look AMAZING in the dish it didn't matter because it was simply delicious! THANKS for the idea!

I wasn't impressed with this recipe it was dry. My mom said it would be better if I made my own angel food cake instead of store bought. I will probably try that and see if it makes a difference.
