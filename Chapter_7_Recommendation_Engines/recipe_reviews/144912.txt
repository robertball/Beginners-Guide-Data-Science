I really like this recipe--It's a very good way to have plantains without all the oil--  I had them as a side dish for an indonesian-style chicken curry, and it was delicious.

We had this recipe in a Healthy Cooking Class and not even a Chef could make this work. They ended up doing it the next day with Bananas.

Liked this recipe but it was more sweet and not really spicy. The plantain was also a little mushy. Might be better with fresh pineapple perhaps.

I found this recipe incredibly easy to prepare on my own and I just started taking cooking seriously.  My family enjoying trying plantain out for the first time.  I would save pineapple juice to add after cooking because I found that the plantain drys out quickly.

I agree, this did not work. The cinnamony combination of spices made the plantain taste gummy. I'm going to try a savory type of recipe instead next time.
