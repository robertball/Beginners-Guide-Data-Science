This is a very chunky sauce. After adding the chopped green chiles and smelling the pot, I was a little wary, but it turned out great. I had it on homemade pizza, and when I  was spreading it on the crust, again, I was a little wary about it being too chunky, but, again, it was great. I let it simmer longer than called for, and I think that helped break down the whole tomates. It has a great flavor and will be much better served plain on pasta than a regular sauce would be.

Horseradish makes this sauce.  Pretty good!
