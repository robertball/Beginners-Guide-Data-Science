I love peas and I thought this recipe sounded scrumptious, but I wanted more of a main dish salad to take to work for lunch.  So I added about 8 ounces (dry) of cooked teeny-tiny whole wheat (gotta get those whole grains in) pasta shells and some already diced ham they sell at the supermarket.  I used half mayo and half Miracle Whip because I wanted the slight sweetness and tang Miracle Whip provides.  I also added a few diced onions.  In addition, I grated the cheese instead of dicing it (because I'm lazy). This was a very good salad, Joa.  It kept me fed all week.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

As I started to prepare this salad, I discovered to my horror that we were out of cheese!! I decided to make it anyway and it was sooooo good that I can't wait to make it again after I've bought Cheddar cheese. I used Miracle Whip because that's what we keep on hand.

All the ingredients seemed like they would work together, but something was missing.  I would recommend  blanching the peas.  They were a bit too raw tasting.

My Mom use to make Green Pea Salad all the time, with either fresh peas from the garden or frozen baby peas thawed. I use 1/2 Mayo & 1/2 Miracle Whip (for the tang that you get from Miracle Whip). I also add 1 small red onion finely diced and 2 hard boiled eggs, diced. I use Kraft Shredded Cheddar (much easier). Mmmm think I'll make some tonight :-)...Also, I don't use dill pickles.

This recipe WAS great!! Only suggest using a little less mayo. Use your eye; I preferred less mayo. But the red pepper is great!! Would make again.

I added diced red onion, crumbled crispy bacon, and a little mustard powder.  My additions really made this dish something.  Don't use green peppers-red are just so sweet and work really well!  Lots of good flavors and textures; will make this one again!

The hot pepper cheese sounds interesting.  Smoked gouda is wonderful, too.  I like some red onion in mine.  I slice it really thin then cut it about an inch long.

I've been enjoying this salad for over 50 years,  for those who thought it needed a bit more flavor, you might try adding "celery seed", it really adds a great depth of flavor and taste, and of course, if possible, make the salad the night before your going to serve it.

I love pea salads....I never use just thawed peas...I always blanc, they taste better. I added diced red onion and omitted the pickles because I didn't think the taste went with it at all.  I realize this changes the dish but I added flaked crab meat and tiny shell pasta. I used mayo, but I have used Marzetti veggie dip before.......its also good in red potatoe salad...SO GOOD! My add ins makes for a one dish meal for hubby and myself  at lunch time . So Good!

A chilled green peas salad is refreshing fare in this desert climate. I tweaked it. I roughly halved the amount of mayonnaise. (I don't care for gloppy mayo-rich dishes and who needs the extra calories?!) I used just enough to bind. 

I eliminated the celery; it adds no flavor. (However, add it for crunchiness if you'd like.)

I added about half a diced red onion. (Use red, not white -- more zing!)

I eliminated the pickle. Not a big fan and didn't see that it'd really work with the other ingredients. Also eliminated the cheese; no need for the extra fat with the mayo.

The red pepper gives it the zing this salad really needs.

In short, with the various tweakings, I really didn't use this recipe after all! Regardless, I had to chime in because there's room for tweakings and improvements. 

Also, I'd definitely NOT use green pepper as the poster suggested. First, this salad benefits from more variety of color -- personally, I'd add a yellow pepper with the red -- AND the green pepper flavor's all wrong. This salad needs the zing of red peppers, yellow pepper, red onion, not the subtle sweetness of green pepper. (Something to remember particularly if you're using the amount of prescribed mayo -- it's a sweetener -- AND sweet pickle to boot!)   

As is, this recipe is too sweet and blah (not to mention loaded with too much fat from the mayo, which defeats the purpose of salads, n'est pas?!).

I made this as a main dish and added extra celery and red bell peppers, also added cubed ham.  I reduced the amount of sweet pickle as well.  Used Miracle Whip light for extra flavor.  Will definitely keep this recipe.  Thanks for submitting.

My daughter n law gave this recipe to me but changed the mayo to half miricle whip light and half mayo but added 4 green onions chopped. I loved it and so did everyone I have made it for so far. My daughter asked for the recipe and I gave it to her she just loved it. It is a keeper.

EASY REALLY GOOD   Whole family loved and cleaned plates.
Very nice , easy to put together summer vegetable. Travels well.
I used relish because I didn't have pickles, and did not 
use that much mayonnaise. Just tablespoon at a time till
it's what you like.

This is delicious.  As I was making it, I kept eating spoonfuls "to taste" it.  (Right!)  It is good.  I put cheese on my first portion only and frankly, I couldn't taste the shredded cheese.  I will cube it tomorrow to try again.  I didn't have sweet pickles, but will try it with dills tomorrow.  Even with just the basic ingredients (peas, mayo, red pepper, celery, salt, pepper), it was delicious.  By the way I used only a small amount of mayo,  just enough to coat the ingredients.

One change to make if oyu are concerned about calories and fat:  substitute lo-cal ranch dressing, either plain or spicy.  We like the latter!

Very good.  Didn't use the celery and used a lot of pickles.  Will be making this again.

This was ok, but will not make again.  It seemed  though it lacked something. I really wanted a good recipe to add to my rotation.

This pea salad is real good, but even better with a 1/4 cup chopped smoked almonds added it it. Yummy!  Be real careful with the salt, it is kind of blah without it, but easy to over do it.  Can't wait to share it with family tonight!
