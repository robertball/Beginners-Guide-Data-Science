I used a mix of fresh fruit that is half Bosc pears and half Spy apples, along with some apple sauce to create a pie filling.  This turned out excellent.  I am about to make this again.  Got great reviews from our dinner guests.  No problem with the fruit dispersing into the batter evenly.  Be sure to follow the sequence shown in the recipe.  Also, this is really good cold as well (maybe even better).

This was a delicious cake.  I didn't have cider, so used apple juice instead, and it was very good.  However, the apples didn't stay up in the cake like pictured. What would have caused that??

I used a store brand apple filling and substituted 2 1/2 sticks of butter (room temperature) instead of the oil.  I greased the bundt pan with butter then generously covered it with powdered sugar, which created a sweet, crunchy and buttery top.  I also baked it for 70 minutes.

Loved it!!! Super easy, delicious.  Added an orange glaze of my own (1 cup powdered sugar plus 1 Tbsp orange juice, add juice to desired drizzle consistency).  It was a family hit.
