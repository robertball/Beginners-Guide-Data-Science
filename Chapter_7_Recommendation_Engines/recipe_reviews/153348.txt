This pie is sweet! But perhaps too sweet if you follow the recipe exactly. It ended up being way too sweet and almost inedible. Next time I would not even add sugar at all, since you get enough from the crust, the strawberry, and the juice.

This pie was great!! From reading other reviews I omited the sugar. But when we ate it it was a little sour. So I guess next time I make it ( witch I will) I will add the sugar. One thing I want to advise it that you sift the corn starch over the juice. Other wise it will get lumpy...  Thank you for sharing. Don't forget the whipped cream!! :0)

My mom has been making this pie since I was a little girl.  It is great.  I hate that fake gel you get already made in teh store.  This is light and wonderful.  One change, mom uses water instead of juice and a regular baked pie crust.  Top with cool whip!!!!

This is a great, easy pie. For years, I've made one similar to this. (water instead of apple juice and sugar-free jello instead of regular jello)Either way, this is a delicious pie. This go around, I used a baked pastry crust instead of graham cracker crust because I happened to have one. Both pie crusts are great. Kids and hubby loved it. Don't forget the whipped cream.

This was a great recipe, BUT I did not have any sugar at all to put into the initial mix, and boy am I glad I didn't! It was sweet enough. The pie was awesome, but the crust wasn't tops...I think I'll have to stick to my own home-made graham cracker crust :)

This was tasted great, my husband loves it.  Took the advice of others and did not use sugar.  In fact used sugar free Jello, so this made a tasty low calorie dessert, except it is hard to eat just one piece!

I added pineapple to the pie instead. The flavor was very good. i just couldnt handle the texture. It was too gummy. I wanted something more jello like I guess.
