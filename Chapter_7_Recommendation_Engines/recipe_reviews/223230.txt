Used this recipe to make the cakes and we thought the Walleye Cakes were very good. Great way and change to make Walleye instead of battered and fried or broiled. I was concerned they would fall apart in the pan, but they held together perfectly (used Just Mayo since I can’t have eggs with no problem). I used Jan’s Old Bay Seasoning Substitute on this site and omitted the salt in this recipe. The only changes I would make next time is to lightly sauté the onion before adding to the mixture, which is a personal preference, and maybe reduce the amount of Old Bay just a tad. Enjoyed the texture and flavor of these though. Next time, I may add some grated cheddar to the mixture. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made fish cakes with carrots in them before and they make them too sweet for our taste so I left them out. I really liked this recipe and it was a nice way to change up the walleye fillets that I have in the freezer. Walleye is so mild in flavor that it really takes on any flavor you add to it. There is one flaw in the recipe and that is that you really have to add a beaten egg to the mixture as a binder. Once I had everything mixed up and tried to start forming patties I could see it wasn't going to work. I added a beaten egg and that did the trick.  Thanks for sharing!

made a half batch ,  excellent flavor, but they all but one fell apart in the pan while browning. In all fairness i think i caused them to  fall apart by using too much oil in the pan as if i was deep frying them.
will definitely make again but maybe with an egg in the mix to help bind them together and using less oil.

Very good cakes. I used trout and added crab meat as well. For the sauce added 1 teaspoon of honey. Best fish cakes I have made yet.
