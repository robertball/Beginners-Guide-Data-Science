This is a very versatile and forgiving recipe, as well as delicious.  Before anyone jumps on me for rating a recipe I did not follow exactly, the day I made this we had 40-50mph winds, so I was not about to go out to the store...I made this with what I had on hand, and it was WONDERFUL.  I plan on making it per the recipe in the future, but here goes...did not have walnuts so used pecans/almonds...used peeled, cubed, sauteed eggplant instead of the mushroom, used cream cheese thinned with a bit of heavy cream instead of the cottage cheese, and finally a cheese blend in place of the swiss.  I halved the recipe and it made 2 small loaves.  Served it with a onion gravy...WE LOVED IT!  Like I said, this is a very forgiving recipe so don't be afraid to explore some substitutions...it works!

I use Allrecipes all the time and joined because of this recipe. It was wonderful, an amazing vegetarian addition to our Thanksgiving.

I used cooked red quinoa instead of brown rice for more nutrition, and 10 oz of Parrano cheese rather than swiss because I had it on hand. I also let it cool in the pan as I was in the middle of cooking many dishes. I have a feeling this recipe is pretty forgiving because it came out wonderfully.

I cut about 11 slices, and it came out to 361 calories each, 13 carbs, 17 grams protein, and 27 grams fat.

I will definitely make it again!

I cut this to 1/4 of the recipe because I had no idea what I was in store for except for the fact that I like every ingredient called for!  My biggest issue was finding the right size baking dish, and I didn't really find it.  You'll see from my photo that it was very flat.  But it is really good.  The only substitution I made was to use a mix of Swiss and gruyere cheese.  My cooking time was down to half because of the thickness of this.  I will look forward to having more of this, as I DO have leftovers!  Supreme, indeed, awakeninggoddess66!  Thanks!

I know you're trying to imagine how this tastes, it tastes delicious. People who aren't adventurous with food may not like it, but it's perfect for vegetarians and gluten-frees looking for something different.

I am not vegetarian, I just thought this looked really good.  My friend made it and raved, so then I made it.  WOW!  One of the best recipes I have found on the site (and I use the site a couple times a week).  Holds together beautifully, great texture and flavor.  A must try!

Made this for Thanksgiving, and followed the recipe almost exactly.  I replaced the walnuts with hazelnuts, and the bellas with local chantrelles I found on craigslist.   I called mine an "Oregon Loaf".  Both my non-vegetarian husband and I enjoyed it as a very satisfying centerpiece of our meal (covered in elegant chantrelle gravy).  The bake time for this was perfect .  I would suggest lining the pan with parchment paper, as getting it out was very difficult.  It broke in two.

I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner with friends.  I intended it as a substitute  for turkey for the vegetarians, but  everyone tried it and loved it. It was a big hit.  I could not get a hold of pecans, so I used cashews. It turned out absolutely delicious.  Great with gravy too!

Hi all!
I made this without any of the herbs listed. I know, I know. I didn't have any of them on hand and I was too broke to go on an herb and spice shopping spree. The loaf still turned out amazing. I just through in some extra garlic and salt to make up for the lack of flavors. 
I am sure the loaf would be way better with the herbs but it is totally doable without them. 
Also, I subbed whole-fat yogurt for the cottage cheese because that's what I had on hand.
All together, it's easy to make this dish your own. It's tasty and has a lovely texture.

I've made this twice now, with the 3rd time being tonight.  So good!  It's great leftover sliced and served on white sandwich bread with ketchup.  I've used other shredded cheeses besides Swiss and it's equally as good.  I am so glad I found this recipe!

No changes to the recipe, really liked it. Will definitely make again. Slices nicely, if you let it cool for 15 minutes.

I made this and it is delish. I used onion powder instead of onion. Baked it in a parchment lined loaf pan for 1 1/2 hrs. It was delish. will make again for sure. I ran everything through a food grinder so my hubby would not know the difference. He is a picky eater..Try it, you will not be disapointed.

This was excellent.  Even though I'm not vegetarian I made it for Thanksgiving for something different. I served it with Punk  Rock Chickpea Gravy (look it up as I don't think it's been posted to AllRecipes) and it was delicious.  Just as satisfying as real meatloaf.

This was good, but it was just missing something. I got the feeling it would be amazing if I found out what that missing item was.

With the leftovers, we added acid (lemon juice and apple cider vinegar), cayenne pepper, and Worcestershire sauce trying to find it. 

Next time I make this i'll definitely add cayenne and worcestershire. I'm still not sure I found the missing item, but this is worth a try.

My first nut loaf and it wont be the last, it was delicious.  I did make a few substitutions, made only with pecans as we have a tree in the garden, brown rice for wild rice and used tasty cheddar cheese for swiss cheese.  There was enough to feed four adults for dinner (non of us are vegetarians) and lunch tomorrow.

This was great! I followed the recipe exactly except for using the mushrooms I had on hand instead of the type listed. Prepped the ingredients the night before and tossed them together to bake the day of, it made a large loaf that filled my loaf pan perfectly. The Turkey eaters at thanksgiving even enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again!

I'm no vegetarian but I liked the notion of nutloaf when I first heard about it so I searched recipes. I only had three changes to this recipe. I toasted all the nuts involved beforehand, served them in acorn halves, and added a little ladle of chicken stock on top. I chose this recipe because it was so foreign and interesting and am glad I did! The Swiss cheese was a wonderful addition.

My family is full of happy carnivores.  When my vegetarian husband started coming to our family's Thanksgivings, my Mom was at a loss for an entree that seemed appropriate for the holiday.  We've been making this recipe for about 5 years in a row now (in addition to our turkey) as a great vegetarian option and it's been a big hit!  Everyone loves this recipe honestly.  We typically make a mushroom gravy to serve with it.  It goes great with the mashed potatoes, green beans, cranberry sauce, etc.   To simplify things we use dried herbs and buy the Uncle Ben's microwave ready rice to use in this.  Highly recommend!

UPDATE: OK this year I hosted my in-laws for Thanksgiving (all vegetarian) and made them this.  They LOVED it.  Also I had planned to use dried parsley but apparently I was out.  We googled what herbs can sub in best and I used oregano instead.  Still turned out great.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was my first attempt ever at making nut loaf/roast - but it took me WAY longer than 20 minutes to prep this. I also dirtied  more dishes than I would have believed - I already froze half and won't have to make it again for a while, so it was worth it. The loaf was really delicious - wonderful texture and flavor, and I enjoyed it very much. I made it with walnuts and cashews (not overly fond of pecans), and lite jarlsberg instead of swiss. (I'm on 1200 calories/day, and was looking for ways to reduce the cal count.) Fat-free cottage cheese, too. I look forward to making this again - other than swapping out the nuts, I wouldn't change anything (except the calories!) - it was golden brown and a little crispy on the outside, and the butter in the pan was bubbling around the edges...Wonderful!!

Not bad.  It was nice to find such a unique vegetarian recipe.  I found this took close to an hour of prep time because I chopped up and then bashed the nuts with a rolling pin.  I will definitely make this again and try increasing the amount of spice, and different types of cheese (I used a mix of mozzarella and cheddar).

Excellent! The family loved it, even my meat-loving husband. The only changes I made were using long grain brown rice instead of wild rice because that's what I had on hand, and I had made banana cream pie I (recipe from this site) and had leftover egg whites, so I used 2 eggs and 3 egg whites instead of 4 eggs. Will make again!

Wonderful alternative to meat loaf. I think I would have no fear substituting any white cheese for Swiss. This recipe made enough for 2 loaf pans or 1,  9x13 baking dish.

I can't believe how much this looks like meatloaf! I thought it was delicious. We used fewer mushrooms than it calls for, but it turned out great.

The whole family enjoyed this. Took me longer than the 20 minutes prep time suggested, maybe next run through I will be quicker. I used tasty cheese rather than Swiss. This may have made it saltier than I would have liked, so next time I will reduce amount of salt and cheese.

We followed the recipe exactly as written.  I would recommend a blend instead of Swiss cheese on it's own.   Perhaps the Swiss we selected was too sharp, because it left the loaf tasting bitter.  I'd also cut down on the cottage cheese or replace it with something different as some other had mentioned.  If we make it again, I'd grind the nuts into smaller pieces, or perhaps grind them completely.

Hubby and I made this together while on vacation and loved it! I thought it might be yummier with even more mushrooms but he liked it exactly as is. Leftovers last longer than regular meat loaf because it's more filling. Love it!

I substituted wheatberries for the rice - spectacular. Everyone raved about flavor, texture, appearance. Next time with mix of white and wild rice, not as good. Made about  50% more to have a large and a small loaf.
