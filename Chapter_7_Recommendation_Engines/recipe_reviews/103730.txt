This was a wonderful, light dish. I had to make a few changes. I couldn't find the roasted garlic rice vinegar, so I used their seasoned rice vinegar instead. I had some chicken breasts in the refrigerator that I needed to use and cut them into strips. Instead of serving on top of pasta, I mixed my bow tie pasta into the chicken mixture and served with shredded parm. cheese. Will make again.

This recipe is great however, I added a medium onion instead of the small one.  I also eyed the basil and salt measure.  The only thing I would do different next time is probably double up the sauce so there is more to serve with the pasta.  My kids also loved it just make sure to cut up the tomatoes some so the picky ones don't see them.

This recipe sounded interesting. Had I known the "seasoned rice vinegar-roasted garlic" was sweetened, I wouldn't have tried it. The stewed tomatoes also have sugar. I don't like "sweet" entrees. I did add mushrooms w/chicken, onions & garlic, & some dry white wine to the tomatoes. I might try this again with regular rice vinegar and regular diced tomatoes.

Very fast and very good!  Like others, I made a few substitutions due to limited cupboard inventory.  I used diced tomatoes, made my own chicken tenders by slicing chicken breast, plain Nakano Rice Vinegar instead of Roasted Garlic.  It turned out great!  The chicken looked a little "pale" at first, but after adding the rice vinegar and keeping it on very high heat, (probably several minutes longer then suggested) it acquired a very appetizing browned color.  Will definitely make again.  (would also be good with sliced zucchini added with the onions, for those trying to slip undetected vegetables to their family).

I made this recipe tonight after I received it on "The recipe of the day"  It was Delish!!!  However I didn't have any Stewed tomatoes on hand, so I used a can of minced tomatoes and green chiles.  It gave it a spicy kick, and everyone loved it!  Also, I added a little bit more Garlic & Salt, because of my taste preference.  MMMMMmmm.

I found it to be rather dry and bland. There was little "sauce" left after cooking over high heat.  In addition, the large pieces of stewed tomatoes seemed out of balance with the size of pasta and chicken fingers.  Perhaps diced tomatoes would work better.  However, I doubt if I will make this recipe again.

This is a very easy recipe and good if you're short on time.  I really liked it, and my 3 year old said, "What's this dinner called? ...It's really yummy."  He ate some of it, but not what I'd call a lot of it.  Once he discovered the tomatoes all comments pertaining to "yummy" were silenced.  One reviewer said it was really sweet
(but light tasting) and I think that's a very accurate description.  I used a can of diced tomatoes and added an 8oz. can of roasted garlic tomato sauce, so everything was a little more saucy, which I really like.  Basically: Sweet Chicken Spaghetti.  I'm not sure my husband will like it, so that's why it's getting 4 stars (It's a 5 in my book because of ease of prep and overall tastiness, but I'm sure he won't want me to make it very often at all...maybe  times per year.)Try it at least once!

This was delish..the seasoned vinegar is the most important ingredient.  Spend the $$ for the flavored, and it will turn out great!! Husband loved it.

Very good. I used the Pesto Rice Vinegar, since that's what I had and it's basil-y. I used sliced stewed tomatoes, but will use petite diced next time, as the pieces were a bit big for my kids.

This was great.  I used white wine vinegar (it was what I had) and the flavor was delicious.  I would have liked the sauce just a bit thicker, but I would def. make again!

It was a great meal...very filling! Might make the sauce a little thicker next time though.
