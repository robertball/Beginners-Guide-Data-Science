This receipe was great! Our entire family loved it. Very simple to make. I had to make a few substitutions such as I only had 1 cup of chicken broth so I also added a 1/2 tsp  of the solid "better than boullion" in the jar to make up for the 1/4 c of broth. To make it less fat I combined both 1/2 & 1/2 and the heavy cream. Also, I did not have the garlic spread, so I mixed in 3 cloves of garlic to the green onions and chopped them up together.  I will be making this again.

I happened to be out of green onion, I used one medium sized sliced sweet onion in it's place. I also increased the bell pepper to one whole large. Instead of heavy cream, I used equal amount fat free evaporated milk which gave the dish that same creamy feel but for less fat and I used whole wheat linguine. This was a very simple dish that my family enjoyed. I'm always looking for a way to use Johnny's Great Caesar Garlic Spread and Seasoning--this dish was perfect for it. Next time, I'm going to try this with BLSL chicken breasts. I bet it would be just as good.

To the basic recipe I added 1/8c dry sherry, 1/4c of thinly sliced celery, 1 T lemon juice, 1 T chicken bullion and Salt/Pepper. Omitted the almonds because I didn't have any on hand.  Pretty good recipe, my husband had two servings.

I used deli turkey and placed sliced almonds on top.  It was pretty good that way.  I also used fat free half and half to cut down on the calories.  Good!

Great dish and quick. I used a fresh turkey breast instead of turkey leftovers. the meat I marinated with paprika, pepper and cajun mix and seared the meat short. I didn't bake the dish and it was a great and tasty sauce.

The flavor of this dish was very good. I have never heard if the garlic spread listed so I used savory garlic Philly cooking cream. and evaporated milk in place of the cream. It all worked out perfectly. It was a hit with my family. I think i would have preferred a crumb topping with the parm and almonds added to it though. Next time I will try that.

I also changed a few things when I made the recipe.  I added asparagus with the sweet peppers and onions.  I did not have the garlic spread so used minced garlic.  For added seasoning, I used Cajun seasoning to both the vegetables and sauce.  I didn't have any cream so I used evaporated milk as a substitute.  Very good recipe.

Tried this with my turkey leftovers from Easter tonight. It was a hit with my Girlfriend and I. I made some substitutions; regular onion instead of green onion, skim milk instead of cream....butter and cream seemed a little calorie rich....used Herb and Garlic light Philly cream cheese instead of whatever that other stuff is (never heard of it) and put whatever turkey I had left over which was way more than 2 cups.  It was very yummy but probably could have used a bit more seasoning...more garlic maybe...Definitely a hit though and I will do it again.

A great use for leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  I used 4 minced garlic cloves because I didn't have any Johnny's seasoning.  I added cooking sherry and thawed green peas to the mix as well.  Very easy recipe to make, which is important to me!  Very Very rich with the heavy cream, which I might use part milk next time.

This is a great foundation recipe as you can add/delete whatever ingredients you prefer.   I used ground thigh turkey meat, which was great.  Really good.  Instead of red pepper I sautéed leeks and green onions with the mushrooms.  I used a combination of brown mushrooms and white button mushrooms.  Used my own seasoning preferences and garlic powder.  My husband really liked it.  We're trying to get away from red meat so this is a great alternative.  Highly recommend this recipe.

I thought this was a great recipe for leftover turkey. I am single, so it makes enough for a few meals. I took some to work, heated it up in the shared microwave, and several people asked me about it. After sharing a little of my lunch with a few, I ended up passing along where to get the recipe, as much as I wanted to say it was a “secret family recipe!”

This was a great way to use up our thanksgiving leftovers! I have to admit I used this recipe as a base but changed things because I wanted to use what I had on hand. I used egg noodles, instead of linguini and I added some frozen chopped spinach. Also I didn’t have heavy cream so substituted half and half. I even used up my French fried onions on the top! I called my sister while I was making it and she decided to make it too, also adjusting to what she had on hand. Thanks for the great idea!

I used 8 oz cream, 1/4 C white wine
I added 1/2 C frozen peas
I used chopped tomatoes instead of pepper (only because I had them)  
I sprinkled panko on top of cheese
It was to DIE for!!!

Nice way to use my leftover turkey.  My husband thought it might be a bit bland, but turned out he loved it.  Will make again.  I followed the instructions fairly closely, left out the almonds just in case I was feeding it to allergy concerned people.  Added a few peas, just cause.

I made this for dinner last night, excellent flavor.  I only substituted the turkey with 2 boneless chicken breasts that I cooked in oil with garlic on my cooktop and cut into pieces.  I also used 1/2 chopped red pepper but I did not sautéed the sliced mushrooms, they cooked up perfectly. Absolutely delicious, had leftovers today.

My family devoured this dish ... I spiced it up with 1 can of drained Rotel, using the Rotel liquids in place of some of the chicken broth.  I used Queso cheese in place of the Parmasean cheese. I added thawed peas.  To decrease the fat content, I substituted 1/2 & 1/2 for the heavy cream.  Bread crumbs on top instead of almonds gave it just the perfect crunch.

Made it almost exactly as the directions state.  I agree with others; fresh garlic, extra seasoning and the cooking Sherry.  Better the second night for leftovers!
