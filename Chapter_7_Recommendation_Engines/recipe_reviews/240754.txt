I am the submitter of this recipe. A couple of things here....this is a very soft chocolate so it needs to be kept cool or it can melt very quickly. The original recipe called for two eggs but I switched to egg substitute (to avoid salmonella poisoning potential in raw eggs) and it still works great. Hope you enjoy this smooth and creamy chocolate treat.

Totally yummy, but I used 1/2 cup of dry “Egg Replacer,” the powdered egg. The recipe left me second guessing whether I should have reconstituted the egg powder. In the end I had to add water, so I am guessing the author used liquid egg substitute.
