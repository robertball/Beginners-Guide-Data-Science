We're big on smoothies in this house.

I scaled this down to make for myself,
as I didn't want the kids drinking raw
eggs. It scaled down well, I used two
tablespoons of vanilla pudding mix, which
thickened up the homemade eggnog up really well. I also added a couple ice
cubes. Oh, and I used a tsp. of rum flavoring in place of the alcohol. Now
that I've made the trial run, I'll be
sure to make this again for my husband
and I with alcohol. (Didn't want to waste
alcohol in a drink that may or may not be a wash.)

Tasty.
