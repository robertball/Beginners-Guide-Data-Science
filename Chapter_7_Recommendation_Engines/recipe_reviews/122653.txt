This bread is really good, but very rich. The only 2 things I did differently was use Italian bread because that is what I had and added about 3/4 tsp. garlic powder to the mix. I will definately be making this again. The family really enjoyed it. Thanks!

Sooooo good!! I made it for my family and everybody loved it! I did however do what your supposed to not do....I used light mayo. *GASP* Still turned out awesome though and maybe not as rich.

This was delicious!  But I have to admit since I didn’t have a use to the rest of the green onions in the bunch, I used them all, finely sliced.  I can’t wait to make it again, thanks for sharing!

I love black olives.  One thing I am going to add next time I make this.........a dash of hot sauce.  It seems to cry out for a little more oomph!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I'm not a huge fan of ripe olives so I always use green olives.  It tastes great and the pimentos really make it colorful.

I saw this and thought it sounded good however, my family is more of a fan of green olives that black so I made it with green. Came out great. Thanks for the posting the idea!

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added about 1 tsp of garlic powder. I put it on the grill with steaks and it crisped up nicely. The recipe might be a bit much for one loaf of bread. The toppings were pour off the edge. Next time I will cut back the butter in half and use only 1 cup of cheese. I think that will fit better on the bread. Tasted great as leftovers too!

Unbelievable. I did not think this would taste so great since I was skeptical. Wouldn't change a thing, it was perfect.

This is super creamy and super tasty! I was just going to make this as a snack, but it's so rich and filling I'm eating it for dinner instead. Yum!

WOW!  This is fantastic.  Wish I could give more than 5 stars.  We love ripe olives so I used almost, but not quite, double the amount called for and I chopped them.  Other than that the only change I made was that I sprinkled a "little" garlic powder on top of each piece.  May try some chopped tomato on top too as I have so many from our garden but with or without tomato, extra olives and/or garlic this is absolutely wonderful and obviously adaptable to personal preferences.  We ate 2 hours ago and my husband is still commenting on how good this was.  I cannot say enough.

I forgot to buy the green onions, so left those out.  Used the olive oil mayo that has cracked black pepper added... the cheese I had was the 'Mexican blend that is mostly monterrey jack with some other cheese added.  I thought the bread was GREAT and liked that it was easy to do.
