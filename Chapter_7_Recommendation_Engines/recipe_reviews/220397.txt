This soup is one of my favorites. It can be varied with different broth and spices used. When I make this with cumin, I like to also add oregano, coriander and some chili powder and throw in some sauteed red pepper when I puree the soup. Another way I make this soup is to roast my cauliflower with thyme, puree it with chicken stock and add sauteed onion and minced garlic and a touch of extra sharp white cheddar cheese. GREAT low-carb faux-potato soup and great for those on a tight budget but need something warming/filling for take-in lunch. This both re-warms and freezes well.

The taste was good, texture, color and curb appeal left a lot to be desired. I topped the soup with sour cream, croutons,and chopped chives to give an appealing look to the soup.

This recipes needs tweeting but has possibilities.  I LOVED the cumin in this recipe.  Perhaps my Magic Bullet pulverized the soup too much, but I would prefer it chunkier and thicker. I added some chopped red onions near the end of the cooking with the broth and added shredded cheddar cheese on top when serving.  There will be a next time!!!  I think I will thicken it with a slightly thickened white sauce.  Yeah, I know, more calories, but we just like thicker soups.

For a slight twist to this favorite soup at our house, we save about a third of the flowerettes  before pureeing the cooked soup to add back to the pot. They add a bit of solid interest (pun intended) to the visual and tactile presentation of the dish. Thanks Amy Rose for your recipe.

Very good! I ended up having to add more vegetable brith because I boiled it down to long and them added garlic salt. It was so good! I will make it again!

I was truly surprised by how good this soup is.  I made it according to the recipe with the exception that I set aside about 1.5 cups of cauliflower chunks before blending with the hand blender.  Thanks for a great soup recipe!  I will definitely be making again -- it was a hit with the family.

Made exactly as written and it was really good.  Can easily play around with the spices for different flavor next time.

Simple and delicious! Topped with ground red pepper and sour cream. Couldn't get enough. A tasty and economical dish.
