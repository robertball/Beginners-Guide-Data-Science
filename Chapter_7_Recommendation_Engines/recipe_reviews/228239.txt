This stew was pretty good, but it was lacking in flavor. With added seasoning, it would have been MUCH better!

I also found this to be lacking in flavor. I floured the beef before browning to see if that would help thicken. I used broth instead of water. I used chili garlic sauce instead of tobacco, and I put in 2 Tbsp of worsterchire sauce. Still, the only thing I tasted was pineapple, and it was thin.

This "Caldereta (Filipino Beef Stew)" recipe provides a lovely "sweet and sour" dish. It has a festive bouquet of colors and flavors: red peppers and tomatoes; white potatoes; black olives; orange carrots; yellow pineapple chunks; beef-stew meat; and mini cocktail sausages. I added a lot of pepper and the full tablespoon of optional hot sauce, and it still wasn't especially spicy relative to the spicy food we typically eat at our home. I am guessing that maybe the natural sweetness of the pineapple juice cuts any spiciness, but I really don't know. In any case, we quite enjoyed it. Thank you Moaa for sharing your recipe.

I like a thicker sauce so I used flour and butter and thickened all the juice. Used the recipe "as is" beyond that. My little ones loved it for its sweet and sourness.
