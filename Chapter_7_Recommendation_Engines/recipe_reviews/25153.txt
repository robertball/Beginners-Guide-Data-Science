Because this called for raspberry vinaigrette, not balsamic vinaigrette, that's what I used. In fact, rather than using a bottled vinaigrette, I made "Raspberry Vinaigrette," using fresh raspberries, submitted by Dorothy Smith. The salad on it's face is merely lettuce and peppers, not really a recipe. Mediocre bordering boring, but a good way to use up mixed peppers.

I tried this recipe and found it a nice refreshing dish. I did however add a quarter of a red onion sliced thin and prefer a balsamic vinegarette in place of the raspberry one.

I agree with the previous reviewer, using a balsamic vinegarette was better than the raspberry dressing. Pretty salad but felt it was missing something. I ended up putting in some red onion and toasted pine nuts as well.

Really good, but I followed other reviews opinions and used a balsamic vinaigrette and toasted nuts.

Very nice flavor - nice and colorful.  I made the Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing recipe by Jan W on this site to add on top and it was lovely.  Nice mix of flavors.  Thanks for sharing
