I'm giving this recipe a "4," mostly on potential.  Maybe it will be a "5" with some tinkering.  It's pretty good, as is, but as Reynbow correctly pointed out, it lacks a little flavor.  For those that prefer a subtle, laid back flavor--this recipe might be okay "as is."  For me, next time I make these, I intend to add about 1/8 cup sugar and maybe another half can of pears.  One thought; Holly may have intended for this recipe to use vanilla yogurt, which already has sugar and offers more flavor than plain yogurt (without sugar added).  I've only been cooking for a few years, but I've learned that the best recipes are usually specific, so the cook doesn't have to guess.  Finally, I wonder if bumping up the nutmeg and cinnamon would help the cause also.

We liked these.  They are very tasty when added flavorings (suggested by previous reviewers) are used.  I doubled the amounts of pears, cinnamon and nutmeg, added a tablespoon of ground flax seed, and used vanilla yogurt instead of plain yogurt.   

To skinny it down for my diet plan, I used unsweetened applesauce (for the oil), 1/4 cup egg substitute for the egg, and fat-free yogurt.   

This is a keeper!

I wanted something to use fresh pears, so modified this recipe using 2 fresh pears diced.  Did not have the whole wheat flour, so used all-purpose.  Overall successful - passed family test - did use orange zest and a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg and vanilla yogurt for additional flavor.

I chose this receipe because the yoghurt,honey and pear are healthy,yummy and so,ingredients that are often in my fridge!I had to take a bit of a risk(normally I am very cautious especailly when its my first time to make something)and use guess how to make them because I have no way to measure some of the quantities I see in alot of on this site like 6g,2g (I put in 3 teaspns of baking powder to nearly 2 cups of plain flour, I don't have baking soda so I leave that out instead of 235ml of canned pear(I grated two fresh pears)I used "greek style" natural yoghurt and tasmanian leatherwood honey.They turned out light and moist with delicate flavours.

Replaced pears with 2 cups blueberries--didn't use nutmeg or cinnamon. Added half a cup brown sugar and 1 tbsp vanilla to liquid mixture. Good!

They turned out nice and moist, but lacking flavor.  I would add sugar and another cup of pears.

Muffins have a very mild taste.  I tend to like sweeter but these would be great for breakfast.  I might add more pears next time.  I like pears.

I used fresh (very ripe) pears and the zest of one lemon. I also added 1/3c of maple syrup. Be warned that these rise a lot in baking .... So only fill your muffin tin 2/3 at most.

I used 2 cups of pears, because I love the taste, I add 1/3 cup of honey, and cinnamon. I used olive oil, the result was good, not too sweet even though I added sugar. I used 1/3 cup of chopped almonds and 3 eggs, which I batter until they fluffed, the result was good. I think is a good muffin for breakfast and diet, something to treat you but without all the calories

I baked it in a loaf pan,baking a little longer...frosted the cake with homemade chocolate frosting,it definitely was a winner,mostly because it gave me the opportunity to use our own homecanned pears from our garden!

Really good, not-too sweet, muffins you can feel good about!  Will make these again!    [I used fresh pears instead of canned, which reduced the sugar content.]

I rate this 2 stars because it is edible.  There is nothing wrong with the recipe, it just doesn't produce a good tasting muffin.  They aren't foul, just not really tasty.  Too much work for a bland, boring muffin.  I doctored the original recipe, using fragrant, ripe pears and added more spice.  It didn't help.  I would make banana bread or blueberry muffins instead.

These are really good!  I used vanilla yogurt and canned pears in syrup.  Also, I ran out of honey, so I added enough brown sugar to make 1/3 of a cup.  I used half a cup of oat bran and half a cup of graham flour instead of whole wheat to boost the fiber content.  These are not too sweet, not like typical American style muffins, but just sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.  I will make these again.

I actually really liked this recipe.  We eat no sugar and I only use sprouted wheat flour, so not every recipe works.  I used sprouted wheat flour, doubled the spices, and added 3/4 t. vanilla.  I also used melted butter instead of oil.  I used several small, over ripe fresh pears.  The resulting muffins were very moist and I told my family they were mini pear puddings and we ate them with spoons.  They loved them!

It didn't have much flavor and I even tried adding instant vanilla pudding mix.

Not bad, but not overly impressed.  Did not throw them out, but not something I will be wasting my time, resources, ingredients, money and energy on.  I'll find some other way to use up some canned pears I'm trying to get rid of.  There are better muffin recipes out there.

The recipe itself was kind of bland.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1/8 c sugar, used vanilla yogurt and added some lemon zest, and that made it better, but still lacking flavor.
I also grated some asiago cheese on top and put the muffins under the broiler for a few minutes, and that greatly improved the overall taste.

They're pretty good! They're definitely healthy too! I used vanilla yogurt instead and it could still use a little more sugar. But then again, that might defeat the purpose of being healthy. :)
