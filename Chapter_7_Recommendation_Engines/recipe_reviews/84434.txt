Every so often I like to play around with egg salad to do something a little different from the traditional mayonnaise/celery thing.  This was sensationally delicious!  I used full fat sour cream and mayo, green onion other than the red, and real, crumbled bacon, but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written. And I will next time too! Looking over the reviews, if you omit bacon, omit onion, omit the mustard, etc.--are you really trying or reviewing THIS recipe?  I like the addition of sour cream (I do in all my mayonnaise-based salads as well) as it mellows out the tang of the mayonnaise. I've used Dijon mustard before and love it, but it was the bacon and horseradish that really were this recipe's claim to distinction!  Loved it!

Wow! This definitely is "Awesome Egg Salad"!  My husband loves egg salad as do I and he loves bacon so I thought I'd give this a try.  I'm so glad I did.  This stuff was really good!  I love horseradish and this definitely gave a nice twist to regular 'ol egg salad.  I did replace the red onion with green onion and used smoked paprika instead of regular (just because I always have it in my pantry) and it was a nice compliment to the bacon. This was great on toasted bread and crackers.  I would definitely make this again!

I make this all the time.  I have put the bacon in before, but prefer it without. I scale up or down the horseradish, depending on who I'm serving it to.  I also love to add a bit of celery and some sliced green olives with pimentos.  Excellent on toasted sourdough.  Always a hit.  I love to see people trying to figure out what's in it.  Thanks.

Wow!  Was this ever good!  I scaled it way back because it was just lunch for me, so I may not have gotten the proportions exactly right but they were close.  I used a piece of real bacon and onion powder since I didn't have red onion.  Ate it in a pita, and finished wishing I had more.  Yum!

This is without a doubt the best egg salad recipe I've had.  I wanted to try something different and this truly fit the bill.  Don't let anything out, especially the bacon.  I didn't measure my ingredients and it turned out great.  I put a little too much mustard in but that was my fault.  I didn't think that I had Dijon mustard so I put spicy brown in and then found the Dijon so added more.  It was still, as the title says, awesome egg salad!

AWESOME!  I used 8 eggs (all I had), so I scaled to 1/4 cup + 1 TBS Mayo and 1/4 cup + 1 TBS Sour Cream.  I used 2 tsp dry mustard powder because I didn't have any Dijon (I'll use Dijon next time).  I used yellow onion, because that's what I had.  I omitted the bacon (personal preference).  Added 1 tsp dried dill weed.  I too, thought that 1 teaspoon (rather than 1 TBS) prepared horseradish was sufficient for my taste, but hey, I am a coward.

Excellent!! I halved the recipe and used double the amount of green onions instead of red. I used horseradish to taste, ending up with 2/3 the recommended amount which was perfect. I should mention, I don't care for horseradish in the least on its own, but if you're careful and add it to taste, you can't really tell what's in there.  It adds a zing though. I used full fat mayo and sour cream because life is short and next time will leave the bacon in strips and place them on top of the egg salad, in an onion roll with butter lettuce and tomatoes. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

This was GREAT.  It will be my way to make egg salad from now on.  Really didn't notice the horseradish, but the bacon and sour cream made it so good.  Okay, so my arteries are clogged now, but *dang* it tasted good.

I really liked this recipe.  The only thing I might change is omitting the bacon, don't quite understand why you would want bacon, but I would also up the horseradish.  Mine also turned out very runny, not sure if that is from the sour cream, but I might either use regular sour cream instead of light or omit it all together.  Other than that, the whole family enjoyed it.

Really good! I didn't use quite as much horseradish because I wanted my kids to eat it (9 and 7).  Everyone loved it.  Thanks

I was craving egg salad so used this recipe as a starting point. Substituted regular mustard for the dijon. Left out the horseradish, bacon, and onions. Added chopped celery and baby dill pickles instead. The original recipe would have been saltier and had more of a kick than I could handle, but it got the idea across. I liked the result with my substitutions which I enjoyed in a whole wheat pita. Crunchy and tangy!

Halved the recipe for me and my husband.  Used light miracle whip, light sour cream,  paprika, spicy brown mustard, creamy spicy horseradish, green onion and turkey bacon.  Next time will use real bacon.

This is ridiculously good.  My husband isn't usually a big egg salad fan but he goes crazy for this recipe.  Marke sure you use real bacon bits though as it adds a lot to this recipe.  You can buy real bacon bits but I usually just make up my own.  The only thing I do differently is that I usually use green onions instead of red.  Fantastic recipe!

My husband and I have laying chickens and I am always looking for things to do with eggs. This recipe was really good and easy. Had it w/tomato soup for dinner and had it for breakast sandwich at work. I like that it can serve as 2 meals. However, I left out horseradish for fear of overkill w/dijon and added celery. Thumbs up on this one.

I usually HATE egg salad and I thought this was DELICIOUS!! Since it was just the family, we halved the recipe, and had it on toasted French bread with Swiss cheese. I did think the horseradish was a little strong, so we may add less next time. Thanks so much for sharing!

We thought this was very good.  The combination of the dijon and horseradish was very good.  I didn't add quite as much horseradish and dijon as called for, as my husband doesn't like these much.  I'm not sure what to think of the bacon bits... I might skip them next time and add some celery instead.

If you LOVE horseradish, this is for you. My hubby does and he enjoyed this; in fact, he said it was probably the best egg salad he's had. BUT, I only added 1/2 of the horseradish and I could hardly eat it, it was too strong for me. After a day or two it mellowed out and then I too could eat it and enjoy it. I can't imagine eating it right away with the full amount, nor could my hubby. So, I would recommend either making this ahead and/or reducing the horseradish. We enoyed the bacon addition! This makes a lot so you may want to 1/2 the recipe if you aren't feeding a family.

This was so good. So. Good. I used half the mayonnaise/sour cream called for and I used fat free sour cream. I used chopped crisp turkey bacon, too. In this house, it served four.

My husband loved this! The only changes that I made was using spicy brown mustard with horseradish already in it and added a couple shakes of dill I also used onion powder because he doesnt like anything crunchy in his egg salad!

This was good...  I personally liked the bacon as I like bacon and eggs, and will probably scale down the horseradish next time (personal preference).  That is the part that gives it the kick!  Next time I will also add some celery - that's part of the reason why I liked the bacon, for the crunch, so I think the celery would be a nice addition.

Excellent Egg Salad!  I make my deviled eggs the same way subbing chopped green onions for the red onion.  Don't omit the bacon or you are short changing this recipe.  Some say it is weird, but Eggs & Bacon go together!   For those of you that thought the prepared horseradish (grated horseradish) was too much, you might want to try horseradish SAUCE next time instead.

Wow, this was good!  I used a little less horseradish than called for because I wasn't sure how I'd like it, but otherwise made it exactly as written.   I think the ingredients mushed up with the yellows then stuffed in the whites would make a really good deviled egg too!

this was really good - we had it for lunch on Triscuits, and it hit the spot!  I scaled the recipe back to 6 servings, made a few small adjustments- white onion since that's what I had on hand, and omitted the bacon- didn't have any.  I also just estimated the amounts I added to minimize clean-up - my proportions were close, but you could certainly tweak this recipe to taste. Definately one I'll be making again soon...

This is a pretty tasty salad and nice to have some different flavors for a change. I personally prefer more of a vinegar/mustard base than this with the horseradish, but we definitely ate it all, so that says something. Definitely better after some fridge time.

THIS IS AWESOME! My Light Substitutions were: Miracle Whip instead of Mayo, fat free sour cream instead of regular, turkey bacon instead of real bacon, and I had to use ground mustard because i had no dijon in the house.  I also added two tblsp of sweet pickle relish!  It was awesome!  The bacon idea was great!  Thank you!

This isn't bad.  I wasn't able to put everything in as called for, as I didn't have bacon bits or onions.  The sour cream is a nice addition, although it seems too much.  That could be my fault as I may not have measured correctly.  Used more paprika than called for--love paprika!  Thanks!

Great recipe! I omitted the red onions and added celery.  This worked out great for eggs that were supposed to be deviled eggs (but I did such a bad job peeling them).  Yikes!  I highly recommend this one!

This is not your mother's egg salad!! This recipe is awesome because it is so versatile, you can add more or less of the ingredients & turn out with a wonderful salad! I used a mixture of yellow mustard & sweet mustard, but I think the Dijon would be even better! I also cooked & crumbled some turkey bacon, that was definately worth it! I think I'll even make this without having leftover Easter eggs to use up!

We loved this!  I took others' advice and left out the bacon.  Also, didn't have a red onion.  Otherwise followed it exactly.  Horseradish and sour cream makes it different (and better in our opinion) than regular egg salad.

This is my "go to" egg salad recipe.  I make it with my niece almost every Saturday.  Delicious, fabulous, fantastic.  The only thing I ever add is a tablespoon or two of my favorite hot sauce, Franks Hot Sauce.

Great egg salad when you want a change. Next time I think I may increase the horseradish since I'm a big fan and add some crumbled applewood smoked bacon instead of the bacon bits. Thanks for this post.
Update: I made this today with applewood smoked bacon that I crumbled into it and greek yogurt with just a small amount of mayo in place of the mayo-sour cream mixture. The bacon really kicks it up and the yogurt mixture makes it healthier and lower in fat.

Great taste, but leave out so much liquid, probably cut back on sour cream.  I used 12 eggs and all exact measures from this recipe but it's too runny.  I boiled 4 more eggs and added and it's right. I cooked 2 slices of thick cut bacon and chopped it very fine, added this and it's great for tea sandwiches.  I made this for a party and everyone loved it, not a sandwich left...

The horseradish and sourcream is great in this!!  To be honest I just added everything but the mayonnaise - then added a little bit of that at a time as I went.  Needed a lot less then it called for but the ingredients make this the best egg salad!

I used full amount of horseradish and deli mustard instead of dijon.  Mine was still a bit on the mild side, the flavor really depends on your strength of horseradish.  I would start with 1 tbl and taste and add more if necessary.  Bacon bits were a nice touch, I also added some finely diced celery. Very good recipe.  I might add a dash or curry powder and garlic powder next time.

We probably all like our Egg Salad at different creaminess levels. For me, this was way too wet and I didn't even use the full amounts called for. I also couldn't find my horseradish, so I added in some Cayenne Pepper for a bit of kick. I'm not a big fan of bacon, so I left that out.

My husband loves it and I like it too but I feel like I should have cut the mustard in half.  It drowns out the flavor of the egg.

this was good. I will probably not make it again, just was not the flavor I was craving. This reminded me more of a deviled egg than an egg salad.

Dad likes devlied eggs with horseradish so this recipe caught my eye.  I omitted the bacon as I made this for a Friday lunch during lent.  I'm not sure if I added too much horseradish or if mine is just stronger than most.  The horseradish was overpowering so I will need to reduce the amounts suggested to suit my tastes.  I liked the sour cream/mayo combo.  I was missing that crunch from my normal egg salad recipe so I think celery and green onions might be a good addition.  I am excited to make this again with a few small adjustments and will be adding the bacon next time as well.

This was pretty good.  I also added crushed red pepper, a little diced green olives with pimento, a little diced hot jalapeno, sliced green onion, and a little bleu cheese dressing.  It was served on open-faced rye toast.  It was a great way to use up those extra Easter Eggs!

This is the recipe I have been looking for - it's not your bland, boring egg salad. After reading reviews I questioned the bacon, but added it and am glad I did. I also upped the horseradish and red onions a bit, and served in onion pitas. My husband gave this a mid-mouthful "this is awesome!" - will definitely make again (maybe tonight!) Thanks!

This is a keeper! I love egg salad but find it a little bland when only made with mayo. This recipe is delicious and easy. However, if you aren't a huge fan of horseradish, I suggest you halve the amount. Also, I used left over bacon and a Walla Walla Sweet Onion. I wil make again.

Really different, I held back one tablespoon of dijon and one tablespoon of horseradish just to make sure it wasn't too strong and I didn't add in onions because my daughter doesn't like them, but added some onion powder. We both liked it, but thought that the bacon was odd. It didn't add a lot of flavor, and the texture was kind of weird. I will make it again, but next time will go ahead and add the rest of the horseradish.

I'm not a big fan of 'everything but the kitchen sink' egg salads, but I have to say I thought this was pretty good. I think I preferred it without the bacon - I used regular bacon that I microwaved til crisp - but the rest of the flavors complemented each other nicely. Thanks!

6.17.17   I left out the bacon bits, otherwise, followed the recipe.  The one thing that I didn’t care for in this egg salad is how wet/runny its texture is.  If I make this again, I’ll cut back on the sour cream.  On the positive side, it tastes good, and I like what the horseradish brings to its flavor

Made this for the 4th with chibatta bread lightly toasted with olive oil and pesto....I omitted horse radish bc of my girls and honestly, tripled the amount of bacon and onions, added celery and pickles...it was to die for...I love the addition of sour cream, puts it on another level.

Wowwwwww...... i just finished gobbling this up. Now, my mom makes an amazing egg salad, but i am sad to say this tops it. It took like 5 minutes to make (i buy the eggs already boiled and peeled), it is very low carb, and SOOOOOO satisfying! If you like deviled eggs and horseradish, you will LOVE this. The creaminess and consistency was perfect! I followed the recipe exactly, except i used white pepper and added fresh dill. I also used full fat mayo and sour cream. Thank you so much for this recipe! It's making my low carb diet so much more enjoyable!!!!

I loved this recipe. I like the classic egg salad recipe, so I was nervous. I read the reviews, and I was afraid the bacon would be too much, so I cooked and crumbled it, but I sprinkled it on top. Otherwise I made the recipe as written. It was very good, but I'm glad I did that, as I  prefer the recipe without the bacon. Still 5 stars. My picky kids liked it too.

This was okay. I liked the bacon in it. It will not replace mt egg salad. Mirical Whip and eggs nothing else.

I found this to be somewhat bland on its own, so I added hot sauce and Jack Daniels Spicy Southwest Mustard. I also cut down a lot on the horseradish, mayo, and sour cream because it was getting too thin.

My husband doesn't like egg salad and he ate this and said it was pretty good.  I served it on toasted onion buns (think this was important to make the overall texture more appealing to husband). I subbed Woeber's Sandwich Pal Horseradish Sauce in place of the mayonnaise & horseradish just because I had it on hand. Was a good way to use up left over Easter eggs!

This was okay, and given I used some substitutions I'll rate this a 4. Instead of bacon and mayo I used "Baconnaise" (bacon-flavoured mayo), Greek yogurt for the sour cream and added celery. It seemed kinda runny for an egg salad and lacking in something.

Very good! I halved the amount of dijon & horse radish to suit Alfonso's taste. Also added half of a large jalapeno, seeded and diced fine.

My husband and I felt like egg salad tonight and wanted to try something other than regular old egg salad. This was the best egg salad we have ever had! It has just the right amount of kick to it, not too hot. We served it on russian rye bread slightly toasted because that's what we had in the house and it was excellent! Next time I might add a little finely chopped celery because I felt like I wanted a little more crunch to it. Thanks for the recipe!

This makes a super sandwich.  The only ingredient I changed was to use green onion instead of red.  I sprinkled the bacon bits on top instead of adding them to the salad.  Next time I make this I will add a bit of honey for some sweet contrast to the savory.

Made this following the directions but did omit the horseradish. I think it had enough kick without it. I am not a huge egg salad fan but I think this tasted great. I think the combo of mayo/sour cream/dijon gives this a better taste.

I liked this egg salad recipe.  It was tasty but in my opinion it had too much mustard.  I thought it over powered the other flavors.  I will make this again but cut back on the mustard.

Good recipe, thanks Megan!  I liked the touch of bacon, but I'd toss in some celery & carrots next time, too...  I left out the horseradish, because I'm a wuss, but I'm sure my husband would have loved that part!

This was so good!! I loved the dijon/horseradish mix.  I skipped the red onions and instead added thinly sliced cucumber.  The sour cream was a good idea, I don't like mayonnaise too much, so it helped the flavor a lot.

Made this today and it was the best egg salad I've ever had in my life! I substituted a little onion powder for the raw onion as I'm not a fan of raw onion, but followed the rest of the recipe to a T. I have found the only way I will make egg salad for the rest of my days! Thanks so much Megan for posting your recipe.

My favorite egg salad so far! I used smoked paprika instead of regular just because I didn't have any in the house but other than that followed the recipe. I'll definitely be making this again.

Delicious!  I had pretty much everything at my house.  I didn't have any onions, but I put in some crispy onions (the kind you put on a casserole :-) ) and it turned out delicious.  I did use full fat mayo and sour cream.  Perfect recipe for someone cutting carbs served in a lettuce leaf.

This was very good and a bit 'fancy' for egg salad. I left out the bacon only because I forgot to cook it and I didn't want to wait. I liked the taste of the Dijon mustard over regular and will use that from now on. Something I would serve when someone drops by at lunchtime unexpectedly.

Made it exactly as listed because I like to give stars based on the actual recipe. I love egg salad, so it's hard to go wrong.

Wonderful combination of flavors!  The only changes I made were to substitute green onion for red and sour cream for half the mayo.  Have received raves for this dish with real bacon, and commercially prepared real bacon bits.  A true winner.

Thanks for sharing.

Excellent! It made plenty (extra) for 2 with the flavor improving overnight.  I used 10 eggs & a little less of everything else.  Hadn't made egg salad in years & it was always plain. Sometimes a sandwich is just what the Dr ordered! Yum

I riced my eggs to make a smoother texture.  The second time I tried it, I used cajun brown mustard, left out the sour cream, added fairly fine chopped sweet pickles and a little finely minced pickled jalapeno peppers, a heavy dose of rough ground black pepper and finely minced green onion leaves.  A WORLD of difference.  I have since made it with some chopped crawfish and again with chopped boiled shrimp.  Served on gourmet crackers with just a touch of chile sauce garnish, this is a KILLER snack.

First time making egg salad (though I've eaten it many times!) and I would definitely say this recipe is a 5!  I did not use the sour cream as we eat a "low carb high fat" diet - the fat in the mayo doesn't bother us!  I also only had turkey bacon bits and white onion but they both taste great.  I image real bacon and red onion like the recipe called for would be divine.  Loved this!

I enjoyed this different variation with the bacon. I used both light mayo and sour cream, as well as smoked paprika and green onions. For my personal taste, I'd go a little lighter on the Dijon. Overall, a very good recipe!

So easy and delicious, I've made this multiple times and it's always a hit. I sometimes swap out most of the mayo and use an avocado instead, I never add salt, and I do add some garlic powder. I make this in my food processor, add everything except eggs, mix, then add eggs last so they aren't too mushed.

Very tasty. Added some more red onion and a little (tsp) lemon pepper (a kitchen staple here). Added the horseradish to taste. She likes it milder, I like it hotter.

This is a very good egg salad recipe.  I suggest cutting back a little on the horseradish and Dijon-I enjoy both ingredients but they are a little overpowering in the written amounts for my taste.

Love it, although I don't usually have sour cream around and just use more mayonnaise.  I am careful with the red onion and the horse radish, but they definitely take the standard egg salad sandwich up a notch.

I've made this a few times, and it's become my favorite egg salad. The first time I made it, I took it to my small group. They loved it. If I don't have horseradish, it's still good. I use regular mayo and plain yogurt because that's what I stock.

Wasn't so sure when I tasted it last while making...let it sit overnight and yum!!!  I used real mayo and sour crime and cooked 3 strips of extra thick bacon...could use more. Added about 1/4 cup of sweet onion finely chopped today to add crunch and flavor.

This is pretty good. A little mustardy, so I may decrease that a little bit. Definitely taste it before you add salt, mine didn't need any at all. For those looking for a way to make eggs peel better, after they're cooked, drain off the hot water, then cover them with ice water and let sit for 20-30 minutes. Drain off all but a couple inches of water, put a lid on the pan, then shake it vigorously for a minute. Add a little more cold water and let them sit another 20-30 minutes. The peels come right off.

This recipe is delicious!  I love this recipe because I am not a big mayo fan and with the sour cream and mustard you can't even taste the mayo.  I did not have bacon but next time I will absolutely include it as bacon would add a nice salty taste and crunch.  I used 1 Tbsp horseradish sauce as I did not have horseradish.  I did add some celery for crunch.

Love this egg salad recipe. I omitted the bacon & added chopped pickled jalapeño because we love the heat. Will definitely make again. Thnx for sharing.

I made this exactly as written and we all loved it. 
I didn't have any bacon but will use that next time to see.
Hubby doesn't care for horseradish but I keep using it in various recipes and he eats it. Hope when this chills the horseradish will mellow.
We like the creaminess and did not feel it was to wet. We love deviled or stuffed eggs and I may try this next time for them.
Note: It takes me 20 minutes just to peel a dozen hard boiled eggs and they are not pretty. Any hints for that. I follow the directions listed here for that but they rarely peel nice even within the same batch.

Best egg salad ever!!! I reduced the mayo and sour cream to a 1/4 cup each and amped up the red onion and horseradish a bit. Hands down the best egg salad I have ever had!

I just made this and had a toasted egg salad sandwich for lunch. I had 5 boiled eggs on hand and needed to do something with them so I chose this recipe. I had to use horseradish sauce as that is all I had. I also 'eyeballed' the amounts and taste tested as I went. Other changes due to what I had on hand were spicy brown mustard and yellow onion. I added a dash of garlic powder and celery salt as well. This is a good recipe but I rarely eat egg salad and my taste buds are wanting something more. Now that I have had my sandwich I am going to add some chopped pickled jalapenos to what is left.

Made it without the paprika because we were out and used yellow onions instead of red since that's what I had on hand, otherwise followed this recipe exactly.  We thoroughly enjoyed it, especially the extra zing from the Dijon and horseradish. Making it tonight for the second time.

I varied this slightly by adding freshly chopped or shredded pepper Jack cheese and reducing the amount of horseradish to appeal to my pickier eaters. I've been making this (without the horseradish) for a few years, and it's always a hit!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Eggs-act recipe. It was okay, but I thought it was lacking something. I don't know how, because it seems to have more pizzazz ingredients than most. Perhaps my horseradish has lost its zing.

This was so good. I did not add any bacon because I don't like it and I used half the amount of horseradish so my 2 year old would be able to eat it.  We all loved this!

I find low fat mayo and sour cream thinner overall, so I decided to go for the regular versions of both in this salad after reading the reviews. I had 12 slices of thick cut bacon to use up, so I cooked and crumbled those instead of the bacon bits. I also added a packaged bunch of fresh chopped chives and a stalk of chopped celery for crunch and left out the red onion.  My horseradish was extra hot, so I added half and tasted before I added the rest, it wasn't needed. Waited until after it sat for a bit and the bacon meshed before adding salt. Served on seeded French bread and topped with  cheddar cheese, broiled for a split second.  Cured all of my cravings!!! Anyone second guessing these ingredients together just has to just think about how well they go together with a roast beef and baked potato, LoL.

Too mustardy for me.  Was also runny. Made it again decreased mustard to just a tad/squirt and no sour cream which I enjoyed much more.

I originally made the egg salad exactly as stated in the recipe but found the horseradish to be overpowering.  I wanted to preserve the added flavor but tone down the horseradish so I took 3 stalks of celery and chopped them up and added them.  I would strongly recommend adding celery.

I don't like egg salad, but was making it for my husband...needless to say, I found I do like egg salad. We prefer food on the spicy side, so I added a pinch of cayenne pepper. Really tasty! Will definitely make this again! ( I left off the bacon because I'm vegetarian, but next time will have bacon handy for my hubby.)

Delicious, not too much mayonnaise.  I subbed plain kefir for the sour cream and added celery.  I also left out the bacon bits to keep it veg.  Salad was great with a little bit of vinegar.

This was very tasty.  The only change I made was to use real bacon.  I toasted the bread and added sliced tomato & lettuce.

Yum! I did not use bacon bits because of all the reviews.  I did not have onion but can see why red onion would be very tasty.    Next time, I would 1/2 the sour cream and mayo just because we don't like it sooo creamy.  Also, for the kids, next time I would only use 2 T mustard.  Otherwise, I really like this salad and will make it again come Easter, I'm sure.
