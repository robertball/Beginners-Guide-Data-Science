I made this dish twice.  The first time for my French husband using a BC Wine White (slightly sweet).  It was VERY tasty and my husband loved it.  The 2nd time I made it as for my mom & dad and used my mom's white cooking wine.  It wasn't as good.  I would recommend using a white wine that you will be drinking for dinner.  Adds more flavour than regular white cooking wine.

Great recipe!  We love it...had never tasted brie before, and though it's rather "bitter", it's super in this recipe.  While my chicken cooks, I take 1 lb. of cherry tomatoes and cook them down in 1 TBL EVOO.  When done, I add 2 TBL good basalmic vinegar and sprinkle with thyme.  It sets until the end...I put tomatoes on top of brie before final oven bake.  This "tangy" tomato taste really complements the brie!

This is a great basic recipe that you can get creative with. I made the additions of garlic and Italian seasoning. It's important not to over melt the brie, so keep an eye on it or it mixes with the wine remaining in  the dish to create a very thin sauce...best to just let it melt slightly.

Delicious!  The chicken comes out extremely juicy and flavorful.  The brie adds a really nice touch and bite to this baked chicken dish, which can otherwise be quite dry and boring at times.

It was nice; my french husband prefers his brie with a baguette though. I added a couple cloves of garlic (sliced and placed on the chicken) and it was a nice addition.

This turned out really yummy and was juicy.  Like another poster, I used the wine we were going to drink.  I sliced a small amount of red onions and placed them on top of the chicken about 20 minutes before adding the brie.  Next time I plan to bake some grapes in with it as well!

I made this recipe twice, once following the directions, and once making substitutions.  As is, the recipe is decent (if you take "to taste" to mean WAY more than 1 teaspoon of oregano).  It is moist and has an interesting flavor.  I liked it a little bit better with my substitutions, though.  I made the chicken as directed and baked it for 20 minutes.  While it was cooking, I diced up and cooked down 2 cloves of garlic, a red onion, two Roma tomatoes, and a handful of red pepper in 2ish tablespoons of olive oil in a frying pan.  I added that to the top of the chicken, baked for 15 more minutes, and then added the brie.  This version has a stronger, tangier flavor, and better suits my tastes.  As is, though, this recipe is definitely worth a try.

I enjoyed this. I am not sure why people said the chicken came out dry. I thought it was quite tasty, though I think I will try a sweet wine next time, as I used a wheat and fruit based beer on this run.

I made a very different version of this recipe and am reviewing it in case other cooks don't have wine in the house.  Basically, the only ingredients I had in the house were the chicken and the brie.  I ended up making a chicken broth as my liquid.  I added garlic and green onions and baked it till the chicken was done.  Then added the brie.  We liked it very much.  I know that my version is not very close to the original version but wanted people to know that if this is made without wine, it is stil very good.  Thanks for the recipe!

I found that the cheese did not melt and the chicken to be rather dry.  I was not a fan of this dish...

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. I wanted to make this as written to review it fairly and with so few ingredients I thought I would have to add something to give it more flavor. I made this with a dry white wine and we loved it. The chicken was juicy with lots of flavor and the brie was brilliant. Thanks so much for this recipe!

Had great flavor. Was expecting this to be much more bitter. I used a pinot grigio and also used previous reviewers suggestion of cooking cherry tomatoes in olive oil with a tb or two of balsamic to put ontop of chicken. This was a grrreat addition. Brie melted off of chicken very quickly so watch it in the oven!

Loved it... The chicken stays moist because it cooks in the wine. I added the cheese about 15-20 minutes before removing from the oven. I also added basil seasoning to the chicken. Will make it again and again!

I forgot to buy the brie, so I used sharp provolone on top.  I also added thinly sliced onions and minced garlic when simmering in the wine and I added chicken broth with the wine, as we like a good amount of sauce.  I dredged the chicken in flour & pepper before browning.  It turned out wonderfully!

Oh WOW.  How is everyone not raving about this??  It was fantastic!  I used a regular non-light beer and I didn't let the Brie melt too much, just let it soften and get warm.  I have no idea how this dish works, if the beer soaks into the chicken or what, but I swear, some type of magic happened in that pan that I don't understand, and that is fine by me :) As long as it will work every time I make it!  I made this just for myself tonight and I can't wait to wait to make it for my boyfriend, possibly using a nice wine.  Thanks so much for this one, I am going to be craving this often!

I made this for my picky husband. I used a good drinking wine. And I cut the brie longwise to cover the chicken. Why anyone would take the rind off brie alludes me. It melts wonderfully. My husband loved it.

This was easy and good. I had some asparagus that needed to be used so I pounded the chicken and wrapped it around the asparagus spears. I used plain white cooking wine and it came out very juicy and flavorful. The brie melted quite fast. It only needed 2-3 minutes.

This was so surprisingly elegant for how simple it was to make. I made this for a dinner party and it got rave reviews! I used Italian Seasoning instead of only Oregano, and when I put the  Brie on the chicken, I placed a large fresh basil leaf under each piece.  DELICIOUS! Great presentation too!

Liked this quite a bit... doubled the quantity of everything except the brie....was really good!!  Family loved it.  Agreed with others though - a sweet, full-bodied white wine works better than a dry.  Yummo!!!

Easy to make and delicious.  I added dried rosemary instead of oregano and cooked bacon for a different taste.

I give it 5 stars because it was so simple to make. My man who is a lover of the red meat, who doesnt say much when I say its fish or chicken for dinner, told me this was the best chicken I have ever made. I about fell down. The only thing I changed was I used the seasonings I wanted on the chicken, and I broiled the tops a little crispy before adding the brie, I used wine not beer. Next time I am going to add some raw  thinly sliced red onions or aspargus under brie for some crunch!

Delicious!  I used whatever open white wine I had in my fridge.  The chicken was moist, and the oregano and brie complimented each other nicely.  Be careful not to heat the brie too long.  If it melts too much, it runs off the chicken.

Delicious! The chicken was extra juicy and the cheese created a succulent combination. I was impressed with how easy this dish was, while the outcome made me feel like a gourmet chef! I served baked acorn squash and sauteed mushrooms and onions as sides, which complemented the dish very well.

Good, safe recipe. The cheese should probably go on the chicken no more than 20 minutes into cooking otherwise the chicken will begin to dry, and it will take at least 5-10 minutes to melt. Be sure to pour some of the cooking wine on top of the chicken for moistness.

Edible, but won't be making it again.

We used a pretty decent pinot gris, followed the recipe to a T, and ended up with dry chicken swimming in wine with a film of greasy brie and rinds over the top.

The concept of the recipe intrigued me though so I tweaked it a bit and the results were much better with my own version.

Brown the chicken in a deep skillet and add minced garlic and onions.  Once translucent, add the wine and simmer,  covered, for 10-15 mins, then uncover and top with brie with the rind removed.  Let the brie just soften onto the chicken, not melt into the sauce as brie has a tendency to release its fats and get gummy.

This was good, something a little different.  I followed the recipe but took 1 suggestion from a reviewer and added a spoonful of sun dried tomato bruschetta under the brie.  I was glad I had added it because I don't think there would have been enough flavor for us otherwise.  If I make this again I will use more seasonings and maybe try cooking it in beer.  We used Chardonnay.

After dinner my husband insisted on dish washer duty, as I "prepared the 5 star dinner". So, what more needs to be said? I did slightly alter the recipe, I baked at 375, and next time may even try 350 . Because I love Rosemary, and had some fresh in my garden, I substituted that for the oregano. I followed some of the suggestions regarding tangy tomatoes, after 20 minutes of roasting I generously covered each breast with Bella Sun Luci sun dried tomato pesto. Another 20 minutes and it was ready for the Brie. I had a small amount of Brie leftover so I crumbled it into the wine. After the chicken was transferred to a serving plate, I used a whisk to blend the sauce, and then drizzled it around the chicken. Delicious, elegant, easy, I will absolutely be making this again!

I've rated this 4 stars only because even watching very close I couldn't keep the brie on the chicken like in the photo. I made the recipe with 6 breasts for a cooking club dinner last night and cut each into about 5 pieces and plated on a bed of shredded cabbage. Look and tasted fine and was all gone at the end of the evening. I wish I had cut the rind off the brie as it didn't melt at the same rate as the rest of the cheese. and left unsightly white lines behind. Could have been the brand of the brie.... I don't know. Make it again? Sure! Tasted good and was a quick dish to put together.

This wasn't great. The brie melted oddly and gave the chicken a sort of greasy taste.  I am not sure if the brie and the beer were supposed to mix together to create a smooth sauce, but it didn't. I will not be making this again. It was a great idea though.

I really love this recipe, it's become a regular in my rotation.  It looks much more elegant and complicated than it really was to cook, and tastes wonderful!  The only change I make is to remove the rind from the brie, as my husband and I don't particularly care for it.  That's completely a personal preference though.

Got to admit it, it wasn't my favorite Chicken Recipe of all time, but it was nice. Needs more flavor and spices. I wanted to coat the chicken with a flour/spice rub but told myself I should stick to the Recipe; sooo to say the least I stuck to the recipe. It was Ok but needs a little "tweaking"

For so few ingredients, this was a pretty decent chicken.  I did use season salt and alot more oregano than the recip calls for because I was worried it would be pretty bland without it. Oh, and opted for beer instead of wine because there were a few sitting in the fridge. The rind on my brie did not melt down well at all, so it looked sort of weird coming out of the oven but I am thinking it is more the brand of the cheese.  All in all a decent recipe - nothing completely mind blowing, but it gets points for being easy & cheesy.  Thanks for sharing!

I was somewhat dissappointed in this recipe. It was good, nothing wrong with it but it was just nothing special. I even added some sliced almonds and fresh basil under the cheese. I don't think I'll make it again.

I am not a big fan of baked chicken. This, however, was excellent!  I didn't have wine so I used chicken broth and made a couple of slits in the chicken before baking so it would absorb more juice.  I took the rind off the brie and topped the finished chicken with fresh parsley.  Incredible!!

Very easy!  Since it was just my husband & I, I cooked 2 chicken breasts.  And, I used Chardonnay.  I sprayed the cooking dish before adding the wine.  I liberally covered (ie didn't measure the amounts) the chicken with salt, pepper & oregano. Next time I will remove the outside of the brie to help it melt better, look nicer. This was a hit!!

The chicken turned out somewhat dry, but I think I should've added more wine (I was making six servings and used 1.5 cups). I followed the advice of the other reviews and used a sweeter savignon blanc, which worked well. With the brie, I wish I had cut thinner slices and removed the rind so it would melt better and look more like sauce than melted slices of cheese. This is strictly for presentation sake; it did not affect the taste.

Easy to put together and cook. Brie did melt off the top of the chicken but that's because I left it in the oven a bit too long. No problem though as I just scraped it back up onto the top before serving and the melted brie in the wine made a lovely sauce to pour over. Served with roasted tomatoes and garlic with steamed green beans and sliced baguette to mop up the juices. Very yummy! Good recipe to do if you have friends round and don't want to spend a lot of time slaving away in the kitchen cooking.

Yum! Simple recipe with great results. The only change I made was to use garlic salt in place of the regular.

Just realized I had a round of Brie I didn't use at Christmas and had just bought some chicken breasts.  Looked for a recipe using both and lucked out with this one.  I substituted cut grape tomatoes and added more mushrooms.  DELICIOUS.  Will make it again next week for my daughter and her husband(still have more Brie to use up...lol)

This was perfect: Simple, few Ingredients (all of which I had around the house) and - tasty.  The only changes I made were based on what I had available.  I used a sauvignon blanc, thighs and Italian seasonings.  I served with roasted potatoes (easy to cook with the chicken - and the sauce goes well with potatoes) and creamed spinach.   My husband and I both loved this meal.  I will be making this again!

Made a few changes, added some spice (dash of cayenne, paprika and cajun spices). Also left out the oregano. I used a red  wine and chicken legs instead of boneless breast (increased cook time by 10 min). My husband loved it! Will definitely make it again.

This was just OK.  I used a pinot grigio white wine.  It was a wine I had never cooked with before.  I put it together and covered it since many comments mentioned it was dry.  While it  was cooking all I could smell was vinegar.  I tried a sip of the wine I used, and it tasted fine.  My hubby came home and asked if I had spilled a gallon of vinegar in the kitchen.  I uncovered the chicken and added the brie.  It was OK.  I probably wouldn't make it again.  Being that I covered the chicken, it wasn't dry.

Awesome, easy, elegant!  Generously seasoned chicken with italian seasoning and pepper (a little salt).  Cheese melted nicely and tasted fantastic.

This was good. I used the Longboard Island Lager and it smelled amazing.  
The cook times and temperature were a little off for my oven but I kept an eye on it so it came out nice and tender.  I cooked it at 375 for about 30 minutes before adding the brie for another 7 minutes.
I served it with rice and poured the juice from the chicken over it, which was yummy. Overall this is a good solid recipe which I will use again. I'm going to try wine next time and maybe basil instead of the oregeno.

This was just okay.  Easy to throw together, but the flavor didn't impress me too much. I used the same white wine we were drinking with dinner but I still found the chicken a little bland. Might be a good base recipe, but needs something else.
