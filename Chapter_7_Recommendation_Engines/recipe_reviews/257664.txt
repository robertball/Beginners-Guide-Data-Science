This was yummy (with a couple tweaks). Maybe I'm a lightweight, but I thought it was overpowering where the gin was concerned. So I halved the gin to one oz and tripled the red wine to 1.5 oz. I didn't have "tropical" fruit unfortunately so I used frozen strawberries and added about 3 oz of pineapple juice. I like how the frozen berries cancelled the need for ice that would have watered it down. Cheers!
