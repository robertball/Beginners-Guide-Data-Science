Very, very good. I made the following changes based upon other reviews and my own preferences: I subbed 1/2C whole wheat for the same amount of white flour. I added a dash of cinnamin and 4 T applesauce as well as about a 1/2C of craisens. To sweeten them up a bit, I made a drizzle for them from fresh squeezed OJ & powdered sugar. They were delicious! I will definitely make them again.

I made these muffins four different ways last weekend and they were all absolutely delicious!  I made strawberry, blackberry, blueberry and raspberry, all with the same flavored yogurt as the fruit I used.  They are so easy to make and look like I spent a lot more time on them than I did.  They are so pretty on a tray and very moist.  We loved them, so I will be making them quit often now.  Thanks!!

This is a great recipe.  I made this as a quick bread, using an 8x4 pan and baking at 350 for 40-45 minutes.  It came out excellent.  I used more zest and it had lots of orange flavor.  Definitely a keeper!  Will make this often.

I varied my recipe based on the other additions / deletions as follows. Replaced sugar with 2/3 cup of splenda (sugar substitute). Also, always substitue butter or oil in EVERY muffin recipe and subsituted with whatever low fat yoghurt I have in the fridge (in this case it was mango/peach. Additions were 1/2 cup of cranberries and /2 cup of walnuts & 1 tsp of vanilla. I made this recipe twice and changed my cranberries/walnuts to 1/2 cup of dark choc. chips and 1/2 cup of dessicated coconut and sprinkled extra on top of each muffin. Great basic recipe. Sometimes I don't bother with plain flour & baking powder and use self raising flour which has both ingredients in one. Of course I will make these again, they look great, taste great too! (sounds like an ad, oh well!)

I did tweak the recipe a little after having read the other reviews.  I added 2TBS more sugar, the zest from the whole orange, and in addition to the orange juice, I squeezed the juice of half an orange.  I made mini muffins and baked for 18 min - wonderfully crispy top and soft center.  I will make these again!  Thanks!

The orange muffins were yummy--I made mini muffins, and it made around 28.  I only had to bake them for 18 minutes.  When they came out of the oven, I brushed the tops with melted butter and sprinkled them with sugar for an added touch.

These were good, but not the best I have tried, I am still out on the search for the perfect orange muffin recipe. Had to add 3/4 cups white sugar and 1/4 cup orange yogurt to give it some extra flavor.

These muffins are easy and a pleasant change from the old routine.  Next time, I plan to add a touch more sugar and perhaps devise some sort of orange juice/sugar glaze.

I like the flavor, but I do not like the texture. Its too dry. I baked at 390 and added a couple drops of vanilla and a dash of cinnimon. I also added a bit more orange juice than it said to. Once it cooled, I brushed a little orange juice on top of them and sprinkled sugar. It improved them.

followed recipe exactly (which is something i don't often do) My daughter enjoyed these, and i mostly did. My husband took one bite and handed it back with a firm 'no thank you'. I didn't care for the orange zest in it to much, i think i would have liked it better with just the OJ. Other then the zest.. i found there mild orange flavor to be great. 400 degrees was a bit to hot. i took them out 4 minutes early and the bottoms were still a bit.. to well done.   ate them with a cream cheese frosting.. this worked great!

I like these muffins a lot.  I baked my first batch for 20 minutes and they came out a little too dark.  17 minutes was just right.

Very good did add cranberries. Did a orange glaze on top too.
Update: Took them to work to share with my co workers and several asked for the recipe.

This is not very moist and more like a biscuit than a muffin. There was also not enough orange flower. It might have been better with more orange juice.

I threw most of these away, because the texture was just too rubbery. It was almost like eating a sponge. The flavor was good, but for some reason it was not as a muffin should be.

I needed to use up some of my oranges and found this recipe. I am glad that I did! The muffins were yummy! I did take the suggestions to add more sugar, juice and zest. I used 3/4 c sugar, a whole orange - zested and then the juices from that orange. I plan to modify this recipe for my friend that has a child with milk, nut, soy and egg allergies. Thank you so much for the great recipe! 2/7/09 - I substituted the egg for 2 TB of cornstarch and gave the recipe to my friend... She made the muffins and sent an email saying this "These were soooooooo good! I even made a glaze with orange zest, powdered sugar and orange juice. The first batch went so fast, I had to make another! Thank you!

My roommates preferred to call these biscuits instead of muffins. Not at all soft or moist. Definitely not enough orange flavor.

I thought these were okay. I did use white whole wheat flour, so they were more dense than usual.

These were very easy and good. The only thing I changed was to do half wheat flour and half white flour. Very simple recipe. I think I may add craisins next time for a pop of color and flavor.

Ok the recipe was good because it was really easy and quick to make. I liked the muffins. They werent dry. I didnt add orange zest and I used fresh orange juice. My husband said the flavor was too strong. 

So i give this recipe three stars.

I think a little bit more flavour is needed.  Make sure you use the grated orange peel.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe and they turned out great.  I made half the batch in a mini muffin pan and the other half regular size.  I did alter the cooking degree and time to 350; 10 minutes for the minis and about 13 for the regular.  I also made a little orange glaze which I recommend if you want more orange flavor.  I used p. sugar, oj and zest.  Will make again!

When I first took these out of the oven I thought that I baked them too long....they looked dry.  But when I tasted one it was delicious!  Flavorful and moist (but not like those greasy, store-bought muffins).  I made an orange glaze - yummy!!  Will be making these again.

These muffins are incredible! I juiced the orange and added the orange & flesh as part of the 3/4 cup of orange juice. I also added an almond streusel topping. Very moist and tasty with deliciously crunchy outsides.

I didn't add any extra sugar because I had some fairly sweet oranges that I used up in this recipe.  I thought the muffins were very good.  I did add a lemon glaze to the top of some of them for some added zing and prettiness but it was good both ways.

I really enjoyed these muffins. They were delicious! I did do a few changes though. Firstly, I did add a little extra orange zest. Very good. Then I added extra orange juice (freshly squeezed, about 1-2 oranges) and a bit of water to actually work with the mixture. Then I added chocolate chips... YUM! Gave a great taste to these muffins.

Loved this recipe.  Like many other reviewers I made some minor changes.  Instead of oil I used low fat yogurt and I also added pomegranate.  I also added a tsp of ground ginger for a little kick.  They turned out great!!

I made these a while ago and really liked them, but my family wasn't very enthusiastic...  (Could be I put chocolate chips in some and it didn't go over quite as well as I was expecting...)

Since I live in "Mile High Denver" I always have to revise any recipes that are baked.  When I mixed this batter it was very stiff, too stiff to work with and I added 2 tbsp. honey and an additional egg.  I cut back on the baking powder and cut the oven temperature back to 375.  They came out great. Butter on the warm muffins and dipped them in sugar, a product called True Orange and some cinnamon resulted in a really good muffin.

my rate can't really count, because I varied the recipe and didn't love how it turned out. I had a lot of oranges that needed to be used, so I found this recipe, pealed my oranges threw them in the blender and used that instead of the juice or zest. I added a ton (much more than the 1 cup) of the pureed oranges. rooky mistake? I don't know I am not a big baker. They were too dry, and didn't turn out as good. I should have read all the reviews (I usually do) but I was in a hurry. I have taken more of the puree and added pow. sugar for a glaze, that helped. my next batch I added a little water (maybe 1/4 cup) that helped a lot. I was also making banana bread and took part of my banana bread batch and added the orange puree, those were yummy! So live and learn, I will do these again, they were still yummy. I just need to try out some more ideas, and I will definitely try the cinnamon, great idea.

Such a tasty (and easy) recipe! Not too sweet and the orange flavor was not overpowering. I "hid" a little spoonful of orange preserve in the center of the muffins before I baked them and they turned out to be a huge hit with my family! :)

These are some good muffins.  I made them into mini muffins.  I used yogurt instead of oil and added some vanilla and they turned out great.  The only thing is that they smell more orangey than they taste.  Next time I'll add more orange zest, probably double the amount.  They puffed up really nicely though and are light and fluffy!

These muffins were super yummy! I did change the recipe alittle just to bring out the orange flavor. I put 1 cup of orange juice instead and added 1/2 a cup more of sugar. I also added 1 cup of pecans. Put in the zest of 1 whole orange plus the juice of that orange. They were very moist. I think maybe in the future i will figure out a frosting that will work great with these. The whole family loved them! Thanks a bunch!

Extremely tasty, though I did change a few things (I nearly never follow the recipe exactly):
2c flour->1c white bread flour and 1c whole wheat flour. 3t baking powder->2t baking powder. 1/2t salt->1/4t salt. 3/4c orange juice-> 1/2c fresh squeezed o.j. 1/3c vegetable oil->1T vegetable oil. 1T orange zest-> 1 1/2T orange zest.  I also added 1/4c brown sugar, 1/2t baking soda, 1/3c plain nonfat yogurt.  I tested this out and it was delicious, though with the rest of the batch I added two cups of diced rhubarb and wow did they turn out tasty!

I was afraid these muffins would not be orangie enough for me so I changed 2 things. I used 1/3 cup of orange juice concentrate and 1/4 cup of all fruit orange marmalade.  It was wonderful.  My family raved and raved.

I made these with dried cranberries and they came out a little dry - so the next time I added more OJ and they were perfect!
It would also be good with cranberries & walnuts.  I'll try that next time!

These are absolutely the BEST! They're moist and have great flavor.  I needed them for a holiday tray, so made them mini size. I used Splenda instead of sugar, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and finely chopped 1/3 cup dried cranberries and stirred them in. These were the first to go, and everyone wanted more. I'd give them ten stars if I could! A definite keeper!

Loved this! Cut sugar back to 1/3 cup, included some pulp with the fresh squeezed orange juice, and made as mini-muffins, cooking 15 minutes.

I had to add more juice because the batter was too doughy and thick.  It also needs more "orange"taste, but it was fine as is.  The taste went well with my coffee.  I will probably experiment more with the ingredients proportions. 

 I used a jumbo muffin pan which makes six.  The baking time was about 25 minutes, but you'll probably need to do the toothpick test when the tops are brown.  I don't like using paper liners.  My muffin pan is non-stick, but I did grease the bottoms and sides with butter.  The muffins pop right of the pan.

I used this as a base recipe. I wanted to use up some oranges that were about to go bad. I mostly followed the recipe, but used 2 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of baking soda and added some sweetened coconut flakes to the batter (didn't measure, just eyeballed it) and added an orange glaze on top and I baked them at 350 for the same amount of time as specified. They're not dry or biscuit like, they're dense. They do become more moist and flavorful after sitting a couple days, covered. Not a bad recipe, glad that I tried it!

This was outstanding. Moist, tender and the orange was not overpowering. What an easy recipe for a quick item to whip up. Used Truvia baking sugar, 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour. Very nice.

They are beyond wonderful and delicious! They are light and fluffy and moist! They are more like cupcakes, though.

A fun little twist is to reduce orange juice by 1/4 cup and add 1/4 cup cherry juice.

I made these with half honey substituted for half the amount of sugar, a little more orange juice, a little less orange zest, apple sauce instead of oil, and all whole wheat flour. I cooked them at 400 for 15 minutes. My husband said these were fine. I thought they were a little more like a corn muffin but he likes them so I gave this recipe a four.

Terrific muffins! The taste was the perfect orangey-sweetness that's great for anytime of the day. A couple of things that I realized were that the muffins were done in about 15 minutes at 375 degrees Farenheit, and even then a bit overbaked. I had mixed my flour 1 cup all- purpose and 1 cup whole wheat. I added more orange zest, like one reviewer said, and it's tasted wonderful. However The texture was kind of dry.

My favorite muffins. Flavorful and not overly sweet like many muffins are. I add a tsp of vanilla. Sometimes I add a crumble topping of butter, flour, brown sugar, and almonds.

I really liked these! Exactly the orange flavor I was looking for. I did use applesauce instead of oil and a couple of spoonfulls of vanilla yogurt. They are moist and delicious.

These make lovely breakfast mini muffins. I used freshly squeezed orange juice and substituted half of the AP flour for whole-wheat flour. I topped the muffins with a glaze I made from the extra orange juice and confectioner's sugar. Yum!

I just made a dozen of these muffins for a family brunch tomorrow. I found them a bit dry and hard to swallow they're more like biscuits rather han muffins, I followed the recipe except for the orange zest, I wish they were sweeter and tasted more like orange. Next time I'll add more orange juice and sugar

I made them exactly according to recipe and just added 1/2 tsp of orange extract based on the numerous reviews noting lack of orange flavor.  They came out way too dry (another reviewer correctly noted cornbread similarity), but cornbread at least has some texture. These are lacking in all departments: no flavor, no texture, mediocre taste overall.   This is not even a good basic muffin recipe. If one has to add applesauce, spices, raising, etc. then it's another recipe - sorry! I will not make them again and honestly don't understand how could anyone rate them with 5 stars.

Really good and I'll definitely make these again.  I cut the sugar in 1/2 and substituted the other 1/2 with sugar substitute for baking.  I also cut the oil with applesauce.  I added the orange glaze like several suggested and I was very happy with the results.

Great stuff.  Cooked at 350 for 20 mins instead of 400.  Added 2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 4 tbs of unsweetened applesauce, an extra tsp of zest (because I overdid the zesting) and used freshly squozen tangerine juice (all suggested by various other reviews).  Also added some juice/powdered sugar glaze, as suggested.  Very delicious but more of a dessert than breakfast muffin.

Unfortunately these muffins reminded me of corn bread!  (I'm sure that wasn't the goal).  However, I will probably try the receipe again, but I'll try to bake them at a lower temperature.  400 degrees is too high for most muffins.

Recipe was great. i paired it with a betty crocker orange glaze (1/3 cp margerine, 2.5 cp conf. sugar, 1T orange zest, 4T Orange juice) and they were terrific. i added extra sugar as was mention in other reviews, and found it gave the muffins a far too crumbly texture, so be sure to  a little extra oil!

Very subtle, delicious, and not too sweet.  I only had mango/orange juice on hand so I used that and squeezed a couple tbsp. out of a fresh orange.  I also halved the recipe since there's only 2 of us and we don't need a dozen muffins.  I cooked it in a 6-muffin pan for 16 minutes and they're perfect!

made this as directed but used 2 tsp orange zest. it was orangey enough but not very sweet. sprinkled a few with an OJ/powdered sugar mix to see if it would sweeten it, but we decided we liked the original better. still yummy but just know they won't be very sweet.

I made this because I originally planned to make the lemon cranberry muffins from this site but the cranberries were so tart so I didn't think that it would be good and since I had already mixed the dry ingredients I came upon this b/c I was looking at a little box of oj and an actual orange on my table that my daughter decided not to touch after crying for them....so I made the following changes: 1 extra egg///subbed canola oil for vegetable//added walnuts and cinnamon and fresh squeezed orange juice///i also used honey and the outcome was yummy! I am sure that they will be even better tomorrow morning!Thank you for sharing!!!!!

These were very easy to make, and have a very nice orange flavour!  I didn't read the reviews before making them, which I usually do.  I think the suggestion of using plain yogurt is a good one, and will try it next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Nice simple, healthy recipe with a delicate orange flavour.  The kitchen smelled like heaven! I made these over the holidays for my family and they were met with rave reviews.  After reading other reviews I followed some of the suggestions: used fat free plain yogourt instead of oil, subbed Splenda for the sugar, added extra OJ (just sort of eye-balled it until the consistency of the batter looked right)and doubled the amount of orange zest.  I also folded in a generous 1/2 cup of sliced almonds, which really added to them.  I will definately make them again but next time will add even more zest and maybe some orange extract to really make them orange-tasting!

I made these at my husband's request.  I thought they were kind of plain, but my husband enjoyed them.  I will probably make these again.

these were delicious, a little tip i learned while working at a bakery to get even distribution for blueberries, spoon in 1/4 batter, add berries, 1/4 more, add berries, 1/4 more berries, top w/ remaining 1/4 batter

I did not taste any orange in this AT ALL. I didn't goof up; I followed the recipe to the letter. 
It was just a nice tasting bread, no orange flavor whatsoever. Sorry.

These weren't really muffins at all, as they were rather dry.  I agree with the person who stated that they were more like biscuits.  They were, unfortunately, also pretty tasteless.

I only had tangelos and used the zest from one large one instead of orange juice.  I added extra orange juice, 1 tablespoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg, and they came out awesome.  Perfect for breakfast or an afternoon snack with tea!

These were ok.  Not the best I've ever had.  Maybe if I had made a glaze with them, I would have like them better.  There wasn't enough orange flavor in them.  I don't think I'll be making these again.

They were pretty good, but they were a little too dry. I added a sprinkle of shredded coconut to the top of each muffin before baking. This added a bit more flavor

Very good, texture was light and airy. next time I will try adding blueberries or swirl some jam through the batter. To add more flavor try more zest.

these are indeed tasty.  i added: 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon and the juice of the orange from which i got the zest.  i also substitued whole wheat pastry flour for the all purpose.  the texture resulted in a corn muffin type.  delicious!  i also used whey-low sugar.  what a great breakfast muffin!

Good but not great.  Orange flavor is subtle and muffins were a bit dry, but my picky hubby liked them.  I baked at directed temperature and after about 19 minutes, the bottom tasted a bit burnt (looked a bit dark, but nothing to arouse suspicion of burning).

I can't say that these were a big rave.  They really needed doctoring.  I added even more zest and also some lemon zest as well.  They baked nicely and are not really sweet.  I think they would be a good breakfast muffin and that is about it due to the lack of sweetness and 'zing'.  I rated it a '3' because they did bake up nicely and were easy to prepare.  A nice recipe for breakfast if you want to do something a little special for guests and don't want anything very sweet.

One of my favorite combinations of flavors is dark chocolate with oranges.  Strangely, I enjoy the tangy, slightly sweet oranges against the bitter chocolate.  This recipe, therefore, was the perfect pallet for me to play with. I added 2-3 tablespoons of 80% dark chocolate, chopped, to the batter.  I then sprinkled each muffin top with pecan pieces and 1 teaspoon of sugar (1 tsp for all the muffins combined).  Also, as I adore giant muffins, I used a jumbo muffin pan.  Delicious served warm with fresh fruit!

These were ok, just not very sweet. I was hoping for a little more orange flavor. I followed the advice to add cranberries, which kept these from being very bland.

When my 12 yr. old grandson Brandon comes to visit, he always asks if we can make some of those great 'Orange Muffins'?  They taste great and are simple enough for my grandson to make without my supervision.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

This would make a nice muffin to use with a brunch salad.  It has a delicate orange flavor.  I used half pastry flour and half unbleached flour.  It makes muffins very tender.
