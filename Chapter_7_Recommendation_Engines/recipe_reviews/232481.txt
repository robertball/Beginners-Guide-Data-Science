I added 1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum to the dry ingredients, (which I add to anything calling for gluten-free flour) and they turned out fantastic. I was able to make them thin and they're flexible enough to roll into a burrito shape without cracking. A new staple recipe for my kitchen! Used Gluten-Free King Arthur Flour.

These tortillas turned out very well. They taste so much better than the standard store-bought flour tortillas and much lower in sodium. I did cover the pan so they would cook through, they puff up but will flatten out when cooled.

This is tough to judge! Gluten free will taste different, and even cook differently.  I just haven't adjusted my taste buds, though!  This really has a "dry" taste to it.  I could not cook this the same way I made whole wheat flour tortillas because this breaks apart if rolled out thin. If left thick, these 4" cakes couldn't be called tortillas.  Either way,they fell apart when cooking!  With a desire for gluten free tortilla shells, possibly substituting another kind of flour for some of the gluten free flour might help!

Added 1 teas. xanthan gum(check if allergic before using) per cup of flour, to allow rolling them out. Tweaked the baking powder a bit less and the second time making these, used coconut oil in place of the shortening. I believe my third attempt to be better the last one...these tortillas are worth trying, very good flavor and texture. Will try making these with an alternative for the xanthan gum after a few more times.

Impossible to roll out, pick up, get to skillet without tearing it, rolling up the edges, etc. Total pain, and I didn't like how they taste.

I am new to gluten free, but these were good!  The only thing I did different is to add xanthan gum.  I made them more like flat bread.  I loved the taste!

for gluten free I thought it was great. Bland taste but good texture. Usually gluten anything is dry this was not. I dod add the 1/4 teaspoon xanthan as suggested by others. Don't know if it made a difference or not but. I did however add a little more flour after kneading so I could actually form into balls. I  flattened in the pan itself as I thought that was easier. All and all I thought it was pretty good. I will make it again. It was easy to make and that's a plus for me

This was terrible. Why wouldn't you use corn masa flour to make a traditional corn tortilla? If it ain't broke, don't fix it! Bleck.

These turned out ok. The taste was pretty good. I did add 1/2 tsp xantham gum. I think next time I will use 1 tsp. I did have trouble getting them off the plate once I flattened them. I reheated one in the microwave the next day and it held up and was flexible enough to make my breakfast wrap without splitting.

Really good gluten free recipe.  It did not need nearly as much water as the recipe stated.  Great for folks with corn allergies!

They were okay.  I would recommend adding xanthan gum to the recipe because they fall apart trying to get them on the griddle and they were not very flexible.  I will try again adding xanthan gum.

The texture reminded me of a frozen pot pie crust that had been cooked in the microwave. Not worth the trouble. Next time I will just use corn tortillas which are naturally gluten free.

I just finished making these and found them to be wonderful!  Will definitely make them again!  I did add xanthan gum as suggested by several others (1 tsp.per cup of flour) but will try it next time with half that amount.
