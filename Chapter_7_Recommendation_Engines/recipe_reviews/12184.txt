I was a little disappointed with the texture of the pie -- it was runny, especially toward the center of the pie.  I even baked it several minutes longer to try to firm up the pie, but it would not become firmer.  I brought it to a potluk and many people liked it a lot, but to me the taste was a little too sweet (the taste of sweetened condensed milk was too obvious/strong).  However, this pie was very easy & quick to make.

my husband loved this pie! only I live in Italy, and can't found cans of cherry/apple/cranberry/whatever filling, so I put some blueberries under syrup in the condensed milk.
It was very good all the same.

While this pie is simple to make and uses ingredients I mostly have on had, the taste leaves much to be desired. Even with addition of fruit, all you taste is the sweetened condensed milk. I almost feel as though I am simply eating a solid form of it. It just isn't appealing.

This pie is super easy, but it is also crazy sweet (and I have a bad sweet tooth). If I make it again, I'll save the cherry juice to thicken with cornstartch and swirl on top and I"ll increase the lemon juice.

This was a HUGE hit the night I made it for the family and an even BIGGER HIT when I took it to the family barbeque for 4th of July.  There was nearly a throwdown for the last piece!!  The only thing I did in addition was to add some of the cherry juice (reducing a little of the lemon juice) to get a pink color and I chopped the cherries.  I also used a regular pie crust which cut a little of the sweetness from the filling.
