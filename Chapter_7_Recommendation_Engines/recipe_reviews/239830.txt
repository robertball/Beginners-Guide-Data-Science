I used vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth and fresh spinach in place of the frozen kind.  I served this on rotini pasta.  This smelled great, and tasted deliciously spicy!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe as my base and found it really useful. I used veg stock instead of chicken, ended up adding a little more water, didn't bother with the salt, loved all the spices, but added more of some, like cinnamon. But it's my go-to dal recipe now, which is great. I also used what was left of a plastic box of baby spinach this time, with some thinly sliced Brussels sprouts to make up the difference.

This was fantastic! The flavors were excellent and we ate it with pita bread. I did add diced tomatoes to the recipe.

Delicious a bit spicy but very good. I made the chicken broth fresh, boiled some chicken thighs then shredded the chicken and added the chicken back in with the lentils. No other changes served over rotini

I made this for a book club potluck dinner with an Indian theme. Since we agreed not to make anything too spicy, I left out the cayenne and reduced the chili pepper by half. It was delicious! If you like the spicy flavor, then add those items back in, but when I make this again, I will do it the same way.

Loved this recipe! So easy, yummy and filling.  You can totally make it with or without the spinach and even add carrots etc. I didn't have a bay leaf and used fresh spinach.

Very tasty & easy! Definitely a keeper, I think next time I'll reduce the amount of salt, though.

This was very tasty with a little bit of hot kick to it.  I did not use the cayenne pepper.  The cinnamon is repeated in both the ingredients list and the directions.  
The garlic is used in two different places but it took me a while to figure that out!

Really good, not too spicy
2nd garlic ingredient must be a mistake
