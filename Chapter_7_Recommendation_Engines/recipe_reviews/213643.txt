The three major food groups ~ bacon, asparagus, cheese ~ all baked together resulting in one delicious brunch recipe.  Instead of steaming the asparagus, I simply cut into bite-sized pieces and sauteed it along with the onion and bell pepper, then mixed the cooled veg with the eggs and bread instead of layering.  Baked covered for the first 30 min, then removed the foil for the remaining time.  Perfect.

Really easy and good!  I added more spices such as hot pepper flakes and parsley.

This was good and very simple to make. I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 Pyrex dish which worked very well. I had an abundance of leftover Easter ham, so I used that in place of the bacon. It's all pig, right?

I served it for Easter brunch. The taste and texture were great, but it wasn't as visually pleasing as I would like it to be, and it was a hard to serve because the asparagus spears made it hard to make neat cuts.  Still worth it, though.  Next time, I will take more time to cut the bread so it makes a precise top and use a super sharp knife to make neater serving pieces.

Very tasty! The only thing I changed was I left out the red pepper. Didn't really like the sound of it in there, and I'm glad I didn't add it. I brought it to a dinner party, and everyone really enjoyed it :)

My family gobbled this up Christmas morning.  A hard group to please all around; not one negative comment and barely a piece left for me!

While mine is definitely a custom version, I think that since I primarily stuck with the original recipe, that I can safely rate the original.

Changes: halved the recipe; did not steam asparagus, but cut into pieces; used only five pieces meaty bacon; used EXTREMELY dry little under 1/2 of a baguette; used dijon-style mustard (not powered); used sharp cheddar, Mexican, and gouda cheeses; omitted red or green pepper; used part of a shallot; layered bread, asparagus, bacon, shallot, and cheese 2x; covered in foil and baked for an hour.

Absolutely drool-worthy - so much so my husband took a photo of it!

I didn't let it sit overnight.  Instead, I soaked each slice of bread for a few moments in the egg-milk mixture and then poured the remaining on top per the instructions.  It came out great.
