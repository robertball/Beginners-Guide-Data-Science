FANTABULOUS! I cut this recipe down to 6 servings and made it in a 4-quart crock pot and the results were divine! I am not a dressing girl myself but this recipe had me going back for seconds. Even though the ingredients were cut back, I still cooked everything on LOW for 5 hours and the consistancy was just right - moist but by no means mushy. Absolutely perfect. I didn't have day-old bread so I just cubed up a loaf of French bread and toasted the cubes in a 350 degree oven for maybe 10-15 minutes, stirring them from time to time with a wooden spoon until they were dried out giant croutons. I have been searching for a super fantastic dressing recipe and am so happy I have finally found one. Big bonus being able to cook it in the crock pot, leaving the oven open for other projects!

"Moist" is an understatement. I followed the advice of another not-so-thrilled cook and left the lid off of the crock pot for the last hour. STILL mushy. I won't use this again.

Wow this was some awesome stuffing!!  I made a few minor changes, such as fresh mushrooms, and I added a little more bread than it called for, but it came out marvelous, and everyone loved it.  I will definitely be making this again. :)

Turned out great for Easter.  Very moist as it says.  I left the lid off the crock during the last hour or so to dry it up a little more. (we don't like our stuffing mushy---more like stove-top)The flavors were wonderful, I will definitely make again.

I followed this recipe almost exactly- except that I added homemade chicken stock instead of the canned. It was superb!

I added 1 cup finely chopped apple and 1/2 cup apple juice to this recipe and it was great. This is a really good recipe.
