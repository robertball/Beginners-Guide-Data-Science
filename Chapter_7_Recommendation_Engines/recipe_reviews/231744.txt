This turned out perfectly! Only two things I did differently was #1: I rolled the batter into 1" balls, I got 41.. so to even things up, I HAD to eat the extra one! ??#2: I used a favorite homemade cream cheese frosting .  ..tip..don't overbake the batter..they should be pretty soft in the center but somewhat firm around the edge..

This was pretty good. Tasted exactly like the cake. But if someone tells you to make a clean, non-mess cookie, this is NOT the cookie for you. This is definitely more of a sloppy cake than a cookie. But delicious if you love cake

Wow! So good! Instead of slicing, I rolled them into patties, which was a lot easier. My family loves them!

I just finished this recipe and it came out great! I made 3 different types of cookies: Red Velvet, Blue Velvet and Orange Crem√©. This recipe works with any type of Duncan Hines cake mix.

For high altitude I added an extra egg and a 1/4 cup of flour to the dry cake mix before adding other ingredients  - came out perfectly!

This recipe is easy. Any level of baker can manage it.  You MUST refrigerate the dough for at least an hour to minimize sticking and crumbling. This is a necessity. Also, instead of cutting into those 1/4 inch round, just roll the dough, pat. and rou d by hand. Far easier and a lot less breakage.

I'm disappointed in the outcome. They taste ok but the cookies hardened within an hour of baking them and they look way different from the ones in the picture. I will be finishing them but not remaking this recipe

really a good cookie just need to make sure to preheat oven and bake a bit more than  like 14 minutes instead of 12.
My family ate 2 batches in 2 days.

Based on other comments, I used 2 large eggs, refrigerated the dough for an hour but rolled it into 1 inch balls and patted them into patties, baked them 7-8 minutes (in an oven that gets too hot), and used my mom's cream cheese icing for the filling. I was kind of disappointed in the cookies. They were flat and dry and didn't taste like much. They were ok as a vehicle for icing, but I wouldn't make them again. It's a very effortful recipe and it doesn't pay off well enough.

Would make again . Rolled into log covered with plastic wrap and put into split paper towel tube for 1 hour in frig to keep round. Will just roll into balls next time and flatten with a glass.
