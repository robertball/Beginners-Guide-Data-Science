i love this recipe between my son and husband who each eat 2 packets almost every morning i go through almost 2 boxes of the store bought every week! this recipe is great for me because i am an avid baker i have all these ingredients laying around my house already i also dehydrated some strawberries,blueberries,bananas,peaches blackberries and raspberries to make "cream" flavored oatmeals AWESOME!!! i just put the oats and mixture into ziplock baggies add the dried fruit and they just grab them up and throw it in the microwave with 2/3 c water and breakfast for way cheaper than before this is a 5 star recipe for taste ease and money saving!! thanks so much for posting it!

I make this all the time, but have changed the recipe quite a bit.  I use 1 cup dry milk powder, 3/4 cup icing sugar, and 1/3 cup brown sugar.  I don't use any salt.  Then I add whatever spices and dried fruit I want.  My stand by is about 2 tbsp cinnamon and 1 cup raisins, but I've also tried it with dried blueberries and it turned out great.  I eat it every morning, and love that it isn't as sugary as the packaged instant oatmeal!

We loved this, in spite of the fact that I accidentally used old fashioned oatmeal instead of quick-cooking oatmeal (OK, so it had just a little more "texture"), but that's my mistake, not the recipe's problem.  I actually cook with cardamon quite often, so when I saw that ingredient, that was enough to send me to kitchen to mix this up.  That and the fact that I had a box of nonfat dry milk powder sitting around for what seems like forever.

Wish I could rank this 4 1/2 stars, my family eats oatmeal enough that this could save us some money which is great! The flavor was good but next time I make it I plan to leave out the cardamom (I think that was the flavor my 7 year old was not thrilled with).  Oh another thing I like about this recipe is I have been watching my weight so this gives me the option of a nice quick and easy breakfast and I can put as little or as much of the mix in as I like. I don't have a choice with the packets.

My husband goes through 4 packets of the storebought instant at a time.  And my 3 yr old is quickly gaining on him.  This is a wonderful recipe.  Tastes like a cross between cinnamon spice and maple brown sugar.

I made my own Pumpkin Pie Spice 1 from this website.  It is a little heavy on the ginger.  I add a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar, which my kids enjoy doing anyway, to even it out.  Thanks!

Excellent substitute for the store bought and way more economical.  I did cut back on the confectionary sugar by half, and it was still great.

YAY!!! i never know what to do with the "original flavor" instant oatmeal that comes with the variety pack that no one in the family will eat. i hate throwing them out and there is no recipe that uses instant oatmeal. At last...this recipe is perfect. my 3 year old daughter doesn't even notice that this was the plain, doctored up! i add a scant tablespoon of this mix, 1/2 cup of boiling water.

i didn't add cardamon and i didn't use the powdered milk because i don't have any, and...well, its EXPENSIVE! i don't have any other need for powdered milk so i didn't want to buy just for this. i figured i could add a splash of milk or cream to the prepared oatmeal if needed. Well my 3 year old daughter gobbled it up and that was without the splash of milk!

thank you soooo much for this recipe :)

We enjoy this a lot. I like the idea of having preservative free flavored oatmeal at home. I usually make regular oatmael at home because the flavored stuff at the store has so much sugar and preservatives. With this recipe you can control the sugar amount (I used half and still tasted great). I just wish I could figure out how to make strawberry flavored, peach, etc.

Good, but not super flavorful. I like it, and I like giving it to my toddler, but my husband uses five servings in his bowl to get it to his liking. I only used cinnamon, and it was good that way, although next time I will use more. It's easy and quick for a good morning breakfast.

Worked GREAT!!  I didn't have Cardamom or use the cinnamon and I used the old fashioned oats (oops, bought the wrong thing), and my picky 6 year old still ate it!

DISAPPOINTING.  My kids refused to eat it, and they love oatmeal.  If I could rate it less than 1 star, I would. Maybe it would be better if the dry milk was omitted.  I think that changed the consistency, and not in a good way.  Now I'm trying to figure out how to salvage it so that all those great ingredients don't go to waste.

I don't usually review recipes, but I wanted to give a quick "thanks" to the submitter of this awesome recipe. I used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and left out the other spices, and it tastes exactly like those expensive little Quaker Instant Oatmeal packets! Thanks again :-)

Excellent recipe & much healthier than the over-packaged, pre-mixed versions in the stores. I make it with slightly less sugar & sustitute brown sugar instead of confectioners. I keep the mix in a jaw in my cupboard & it's ready to prep when I need it. I put about 4 servings of oats into a baggie & put in the correct amt of mix. Then I add 1 Tbsp of raw & ground flaxseed to the baggie as well as sunflower seeds, chopped almonds & dried cranberries. Yuh. Umm.

Fabulous!  I have given this mix to parents and friends with the directions and recipe printed out and taped to the container.  We've used a variety of fruits; our favorite is fried apples.

I LOVE this stuff! Like many of you, I take a ziplock bag of oats with this flavoring to work every morning. Quick, easy and much less expensive and no "chemical taste" that I am finding with the store-bought kinds. I did omit the cardamom, and have tried it with freeze dried strawberries, all very yummy options.

*****In case anyone needed to know i weighed all ingredients and found that there are 3 CALORIES PER 1 GRAM OF THE TOPPING!!*****  I thiink I need to do something here.  I didn't add the pumpkin or nutmeg or cardamom.  I don't care for pumpkin flavor, but I think I may add nutmeg to it becuase as is, it's kinda bland.  I also may have not put enough of the powder proportionatly to the amount of oats I had and I brought it to work to try it for the first time.  so that could be my error. I'm used to the very sweet oatmeal.  When I go home tonight I'll add the nutmeg and maybe a little mulling spice and some more brown sugar. And if that doesnt work, I'm sure my taste buds will adjust to this.  I can see this saving me a ton of money!  I eat a lot of oatmeal, and even on sale it can be expensive!---UPDATE!!! I made the changes and this definately fits my sweet tooth for oatmeal now.  I needed a little more spice and more of the mix for the oatmeal!   GREAT recipe!  Looking forward to saving money now!!! THANK YOU!

I had to increase the brown sugar to make it actually taste like the store bought kind.  But as other reviewers have stated, if you want less sugar than what is found in the store-bought varieties this is a great alternative.

My kids really enjoy this oatmeal. Much healthier than store bought. I decreased the powdered sugar. Used two tablespoons of mix to one third cup oats.

This is amazing! The first time I made it exactly as written, which is very good. The second time I used Stevia in place of the confectioners' sugar to cut calories. This is great for taking oatmeal to work. I use 1/3 cup quick cooking oats, 2 tablespoons mix, 2 tablespoons dried fruit and about 2/3 cup hot water and let steam for about 5 minutes. After making this mix, the oatmeal can be packaged in individual containers or zip lock bag. Incredibility easy.
