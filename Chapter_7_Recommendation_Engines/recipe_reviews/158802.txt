Even though I made a few changes, the recipe rates 5 stars just for the versatility. I used angel hair pasta instead of bow tie, and only crab for the seafood. Because of this, I skipped the second part, and just used the 'sauce' section of the recipe. After I made the sauce, I threw in fresh spinach, chopped sundried tomatoes, the crabmeat and then tossed with the cooked pasta - topped with grated parm. I will try this with no seafood for my 'no seafood' husband, but what a great base to play with - simple, quick and tastes great. This is worth a try - Thanks for the recipe!!

Just like the submitter’s mother-in-law, our family’s Christmas Eve tradition is also a dinner of fish and seafood.  It’s called The Feast of the Seven Fishes, and my guess is that Janet P.’s mother-in-law is Italian, as I am.   In keeping with tradition, we tend to have the same seafood dishes year after year, but it was fun to try another family’s dish.   I loosely followed the recipe, opting out of the oysters and using scallops instead.   I sautéed the shrimp and scallops until nicely browned, then deglazed the pan with both lemon juice and a little white wine.  I used Alaskan King Crab, only because it was left over from another meal.  I didn’t bother measuring the ingredients precisely, just enjoyed myself with the “a little of this, a little of that” approach, totally immersing myself in the enjoyment of the cooking process. This is an absolutely exquisite dish that needs no amendments.  My adding wine, while a nice addition, certainly wasn’t vital – the recipe stands on its own.  If it wasn’t for the fact that our Italian Christmas Eve dinner menu is so carved in stone, this definitely would be a beautiful part of the meal.

This came out beautifully!  Have to admit I added 10 oz. of frozen spinach (thawed) to the butter sauce because hubby and I needed some veggies...but the seafood came through nicely and the sauce really added richness.  I'm sure it would be perfect without the spinach as well.  I also served steamed veggies on the side.  Very elegant!

I used canned clams and calamari in this recipe and omitted the oysters. When making the sauce I used extra lemon juice, cayenne and a can of artichoke hearts. I also added an extra clove of garlic. 
The clams gave the seafood a lot of flavor and I did not have to use salt. When cooking the seafood, I sauteed a small onion and added 1/4 tsp of cumin and dried Italian seasonings. I also used more cayenne. I did not use butter when cooking the seafood. Overall the dish was phenomenal and very versatile! This is a great dish for the cook who likes to experiment.

I also added spinach, cooked and drained.  I used about 1/4 cup of the liquid from the oysters to add to the butter garlic sauce, I put the rest of the liquid including that from the canned crabmeat into the boiling water for the pasta. I reduced the butter for the frying pan by half.  It is a quick and easy recipe but it still seems to be missing something.  I didn't use salt and that maybe the key.  I think I'll try green onions, basil, and oregano next time.

This recipe was very good.  However, I omitted the butter.  I also followed   another person's suggestion and added fresh spinach to the pasta.  I did not have fresh parsley so I used dried.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicous!  My guests are still talking about it.  The only changes I made were to use whole wheat fettucine and add sliced cherry tomatoes.  I also added more shrimp and crabmeat and grated parmesan at the end.  It made enough to feed 10 people!

I do not eat seafood, but my husband does! I made this for his Valentine's Day dinner, and he said it is the meal he's been waiting for his entire life. Then he declared it the dinner he wants for his birthday, too. I think that makes it a winner! The only thing I added that wasn't called for in the recipe was a couple of handfuls of spinach. Thank you for helping me make my hard working man's stomach happy. :)

Phenomenal and simple to do! I also went with spinach rather than parsley, giving it even more chewiness.   For more crunch, stir fry noodles could be added uncooked (like in salads)

This is a great recipe with a lot of flexibility.  I used oysters, some shrimp, and bay scallops.  Made a smaller quantity with penne pasta and it was really good.  I can see other variations, but the basic butter, olive oil, garlic, and (Italian) parsley works great.  Steve W.

I was looking for something that I could substitute in quinoa to make a gluten free dish and this turned out delish! Cooked the quinoa as directed and used instead of pasta but didn't end up using all the sauce since the quinoa is very absorbent. Also only had crab meat but will try it with oysters and shrimp next time. Served this with Balsamic Baked Tilipia also found here and steamed broccoli. Nice seafood night!

the recipe as is, was a little bland for me and just too oily.  Next time, I plan on making the sauce Alfredo.  I will also add more vegetables; spinach, mushrooms, asparagus.

A weekly staple in our household! I'm not a big fan of tomato sauce and my partner is not a big fan of parmesan, so that eliminates most types of pasta for us. This recipe is the sweet spot. Points for versatility and consistency!

I have to say I was very skeptical of this recipe, due to all the butter and olive oil!  Boy, was I wrong!!  It cooked down and landed a wonderful flavor!  I followed the recipe as stated, but at the end I added some fresh spinach and sundries tomatoes.  Excellent is all I can say!!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this as directed but like I think everyone else, omitted the oysters.  Sorry to go against all other reviews but I was not impressed. It was just far too much oil for me! Melted butter plus oil was not good. If you are spending good $ on crab and shrimp MUCH better alternatives, I salvaged what I had by adding cream, wine, onion and a bit of saffron…. Basically, a whole new sauce to mix in as I simply could not eat it as it was… sorry!

I needed to use up some oysters and frozen seafood - this fit.  But my version was very bland since I didn't have any herbs except dried parsley and Italian seasoning and my pasta was very old.  Nonetheless, it's a fine recipe for fresh ingredients.   I'll make it again and it will be better next time.

This is a great dish as written. My 100 yo Dad liked it a lot also. I take him lunches at his  assisted living place (they provide dinner). He said it was better than the provided dinner. We like oysters and the other seafood. Also...it's not following the recipe to a T when you add or subtract things. It's a flexible recipe.

I don't think I followed the recipe exactly, but turned out good. I used 1 tbsp of margerine (that, I can tolerate) added garlic, onion and tomatoes. Sauteed for 3-5 min. Added oregano, lemon juice,  salt and crab meat.  Cooked for 5 min until crabmeat soft and mixed it with previously cooked pasta.

I stead of that next 1/4 cup of butter I added 1/2 cup the starchy pasta water. Also threw in can diced tomatoes, whole bag of spinach and white mushrooms. Topped with some parm. Well enjoyed by all, especially my

Delicious! A used only crabmeat,  a 1/4 cup of olive oil seemed plentiful, and I also added fresh diced tomatoes, green onion, capers, and artichoke hearts. Great easy dish.

I made this meal for my husband and I.  the only thing I change was the pasta. I used zucchini noodles instead.  just make sure the noodles are dry buy putting them on a towel and absorbing the liquid from the zucchini.  we loved it.

This is a great recipe to make as is or build upon. I didn't have oysters, and I cut the butter & oil in half (it still made enough broth).  I also added a lot more veggies. Mushrooms, scallions, roasted red peppers, cherry tomatoes halved and some fresh spinach. You can add just about any veggies your family enjoys. Thanks for this versatile recipe!

I took this recipe and combined it with another, eliminated the oysters (didn't have any and wished I did!!) and added cherry tomatoes, capers, and fresh basil from the garden.  It was so good.  Not overwhelming.  I used jumbo shrimp and cooking them this way made them have a lovely lobster-type texture.  Perfecto!

I liked this recipe. It was pretty easy and tasted good. I cooked spinach, but decided to leave it out. Once I saw the dish, though, I wanted to add some color so I used a 1/4 cup of chicken broth in the pan that had the sauce in it and quartered about 10 plum tomatoes that I had left from another recipe. I cooked it over medium heat for about 5 minutes and stirred all of the left over sauce and spices down. I then poured it over the completed pasta dish. This added color, enough tomatoes for me, and just enough extra liquid. I also added italian seasoning to the shrimp and crabmeat, I didn't use oysters, used only 2.5 tsp garlic, and I didn't have enough parsley, so I used fresh basil to make up the difference. I also used regular spaghetti. I will try this again. I wish the recipe said how much a serving is so that I can more accurately account for it on my points plus, but it's worth the dish to be off a little!

I added a cup of white wine to the sauce mix and it was so wonderful. Great recipe!
