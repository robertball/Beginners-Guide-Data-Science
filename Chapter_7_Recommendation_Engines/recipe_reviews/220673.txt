Pretty basic recipe.  I would normally have added a can of mushrooms but wanted to follow the recipe more closely the first time.  I did however use beef broth instead of chicken because that goes with the rest of dinner better.  Thanks!

There's nothing wrong with this but it's really nothing more than rice cooked in broth with a little onion added.  Fairly basic, average and nondescript.  I used butter for flavor rather than vegetable oil  and added peas, red bell pepper and a pinch of saffron to jazz it up a bit.

Best recipient ever.  Not too fancy but a wonderful change to a plain side dish.  Great flavour especially if you caramelize the onions

I make basmati rice all the time and this pilaf was wonderful with chicken, chops, all kinds of things.  It is also very easy to make.  I cook exactly as stated and its fab.

This was a very good rice pilaf recipe. These are the changes I made: I added about 1 teaspoon of tomato paste and 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder.

This was my first time making basmati rice and it turned out great.  I usually use chicken stock in my regular rice and the bay leaf added great flavor.  Thanks for sharing, will be using this again.

I used butter instead of vegetable oil and beef broth instead of chicken (I made meat loaf with beef, I wanted to match all the flavors of dinner together). I also threw in one minced clove of garlic in with the onion. The rice turned out great, the family ate every bit of it.

We loved this simple rice! No, it's nothing major as far as flavor goes, but it's just enough to take it up from plain and bland. I served this with our favorite red curry chicken...perfect! A keeper for us~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a very simple and quick to make side dish for a weeknight meal.
I used 3/4 cup rice and 1/4 cup orzo, and subbed butter for the vegetable oil for added flavor.
The taste and texture were perfect.

This is really good and a perfect accompaniment to grilled meat. I used vegetable broth. The bay leaf really adds a lovely dimension. Thank you for the recipe.

Yum! Everyone liked! Used jasmine rice instead of basmati. Doubled recipe for 4 of us and no leftovers. Saved a step by not heating up chicken broth and used 2 c of broth (as liquid amount on rice directions) instead of the called-for doubled amount of 1 1/2. Added margarine when added broth. Simmered for 20 min.

This was my first time making basmati rice. I followed the instructions exactly and the rice will still under cooked after 20 minutes. I added more stock and cooked it longer but it still didn't seem to cook thoroughly. I ended up burning it and threw it out. The basic cooking instructions on the bag said to cook it 40 minutes and this recipe said to cook it only 20 minutes. Either I needed more stock or longer time. Not sure but will definitely try again as I did like the flavor.

Absolutely delicious, and the secret to it is using basmati rice.  It cooks up perfectly, and doesn't leave you feeling bloated, as happens with other types of rice I have used.  I added some minced garlic to the onions and bay leaf, and a touch of black pepper.  I used chicken stock this time,  and plan to use the beef stock in the future if it goes with a beef dish.  Many thanks, Carol,  for sharing this with us.

This pilaf makes a wonderful side dish.  Its flavor will not overshadow the main dish, but can easily be adjusted if you would like a pilaf with more jazz. This is a good, basic pilaf.  I used my homemade chicken broth which is more flavorful than the store bought kind, and used butter instead of vegetable oil for sautéing the onion.  I chose this recipe to use up some nearly empty packages of rice, so this was a combination of basmati rice and long grain white rice, and it worked out very well. Thanks Carol for sharing!

This is a good basic recipe but I made the mistake of making it with brown basmati rice which I've found out take much more water to cook properly.  I followed the recipe and luckily checked on it while it was simmering and found that all of the water was gone and the rice had started to burn.  I added more liquid and was able to save the dish.  It took much longer to cook though also.  Lesson learned.  I would give it more stars if not for this mishap.
