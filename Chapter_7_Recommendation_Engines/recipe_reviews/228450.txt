My family loved it. I don't agree that it will serve 8. At least not 8 adults. I think 4-6 is a more accurate number.
I was rushed for time so I used southern style frozen has browns (the chunks, not shredded)and ham already cubed. (It comes vacuum packed in a zip bag) I think next time I might use frozen O'Brian potatoes and that way I won't have to mess with chopping the onions and peppers. I just threw the frozen potatoes in the butter with the ham, onions, and pepper and cooked them until they were thawed and warm. I cooked the carrots and celery in the microwave just a few minutes until they started getting tender. Talk about fast and easy! It was delicious too!

This was very good.  The only changes I will make the next time will be to be sure and drain the ham/onion mixture before adding it to the potatoes.  I would also stir the sauce into the casserole rather than just pouring it over the top.  The flavor was very good and I will make it again.

This was very well recieved by the family. I skipped the roux and added 1/3 cup cheese blend powder to the milk and only used enough shredded cheddar to sprinkle a token amount over the top. This helped me keep the fat down but it remained creamy and cheesy.

This is a great way to use up ham and potatoes and it is wonderfully filling. I agree that if you have a big appetite this will feed about 4-6 adults and stirring the sauce into the potatoes helps get it distributed because it is pretty thick. Next time I will saute all my veggies and only boil the potatoes and some broccoli. The sauce was very cheesy (yum) but next time I will add a little nutmeg and some sour cream and use some parmesan too for a little more depth.

I made this tonight and followed the recipe except for the green pepper (I do not like cooked green pepper!) and it was a family hit!  We sat around the table talking about the next time I make it that I should add broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms and could even put it in pie crust to make it like a pot pie.  This will definitely be a make again and I may try changing it up with sausage, smoked sausage, or other meats!  5+ Stars!!!

Wow, very nice!  I substituted frozen peas and carrots for the bell pepper.  I doubled the amount of potato and doubled the cheese sauce.  So glad I did.  It needed pepper.  I loved the sauce and there was lots of it.  Next time I would add more ham and peas/peas and carrots.  Definitely comfort food.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was delicious. I did make some changes though. I doubled the cheese sauce (used half cheddar and half Swiss) and potatoes and only used one fresh carrot. I also added a bag of frozen peas and carrots and substituted the onion and breadcrumb with a large container of French fried onion rings. I put half in the casserole and half on top. Seasoned with garlic powder, rosemary and freshly ground pepper.

My whole family loved this.  Three small russet potatoes and a 12 oz ham steak were perfect.  I almost left out the green pepper, but I'm glad I didn't.  I also made 1 1/2 times the sauce so there would be no chance of it turning out dry.  For the bread crumb topping, I mixed them with 2T melted butter.  Very good!

It was a hit but will need to make a larger amount so that 3 adults can have more leftovers. We barely had enough for leftovers due to seconds. I have been looking for ways to use up leftover ham and we now have a winner. It would be easy to substitute any other veggie that might be available in the fridge.

This was really good. I never thought to use a cheese sauce with potatoes, but this will definitely be in my recipe box.  I did make a few changes (so rated 4 star):  I saut√©ed all the veggies (other than the potatoes) in a bit of butter and oil.  I also added 2 tablespoons stone-ground mustard to the cheese sauce, to give it a bit of an extra zip. I used panko, and worked in about 2 T of butter into them before spreading on top, giving them an extra crunch.  Otherwise I followed the directions as printed, and it turned out very well.  I can see adding broccoli to it, and/or cauliflower.  Maybe some peas.  But really good, and I agree, the number of servings seems off.  My husband and I just ate half of it for dinner, and probably will eat the other half tomorrow...and we're not really big eaters. :)

I did not like the sauce. It was bland and pasty. I think 3 Tbsp of flour may have been too much flour. The sauce needs to be cheesy and instead it was too thick and very bland. My husband and I ate a little.

This casserole is perfect for what it's supposed to be: warm and cozy comfort food.  Even though I didn't have some of the ingredients (celery or bell peppers, which my kids wouldn't eat anyway), this casserole was very tasty.  The only thing I added was to season with fresh ground pepper at each step, not just when making the cheese sauce.  The casserole had plenty of flavor and was a great way to use up leftover ham.  We all had seconds and there's enough left for my lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I am not a casserole person but this was really yummy. I added about two tbsp of sherry to give it a subtle sweetness and it was wonderful. I also used seasoned panko instead of breadcrumbs and it complemented the dish very nicely. Perfect for the cold snowy weather we are experiencing in CT. I will definitely make this again.

I liked this one, I did decide to add a little milk and cheese to increase the sauce. I added very little salt & pepper and used white Cheddar and mozzarella cheese. It was still very flavorful.  The breadcrumbs are a must.

This is quite good!  A wonderful comfort food.  I pretty much followed the recipe, except I did not boil the celery with the potatoes and carrots.  Instead, I sauteed it with the ham, onion and green pepper.  It added a nice bit of crunch to the finished product.  I also added two cups of cheese, as I love cheese, and thought the cheesier the better.  That meant I added a bit more milk as well, although I am not sure how much- I just eyeballed it.  Finally, I put all of the ingredients (except the bread crumbs) in a big bowl, and tossed it with the sauce to coat.  Then I put it in the casserole dish, topped with the bread crumbs, and baked.  YUM!  Very tasty, and an excellent use of leftover ham :)  Nest time, I may add some garlic, and maybe some peas.  I also think this would be good with Swiss cheese!  But delicious as is!

I thought this was good but my husband and son thought it was great and want it again.  I ended up using more milk (about another cup or more) because I wanted the sauce thinner to cover the vegetables.  It seemed to me that with 1 cup it just clumped.  I guess it depends on how much you cook the rue.  That was the only change I made.

I tried this tonight, probably the BEST casserole I've ever made. We were feeding 3, and 2 cups of cut potatoes didn't seem like enough so I used about 4 cups. I also added about 1/4 cup more milk. It didn't look as creamy as I wanted, so I used a can of cream of chicken. I also didn't have any fresh carrots so I used part of a bag of frozen mixed veggies. And then on top I sprinkled cheddar cheese.

My husband and I enjoyed it very much.  I used a whole small onion and half a large red bell pepper, because I thought it would need more flavor. My white sauce looked like it would be too thick, so I also added additional milk.  I used a bit more cheese than called for too, because I love cheese.  I do believe the portion size should be revised, as the two of use ate half the casserole. We're looking forward to leftovers tonight.

I will definitely make this again. It had a great flavor. I put the cheese in the white sauce  - and I used chicken broth rather than water . I  mixed the sauce with the ham and vegetables, and then sprinkled shredded cheese over the casserole. I also put hash browns and broccoli  in with the ham - it was excellent

Really liked the veggies in this, particularly the cubed potatoes.  We enjoyed it, but thought the flavor was a bit flat.  It needs some seasoning but is a nice casserole and a good way to use chopped leftover ham.

This was awesome!  I'm not a big fan of casseroles in general but had a great ham that I didn't want to see go to waste. I sauteed the carrots, celery and onions instead of boiling. I added chopped snowpeas instead of green peppers and used lower fat swiss instead of cheddar.  Wow! It was a hit all around

This recipe was fantastic.  The only change I made was leaving out the bell pepper and the salt.  Other then that, I followed the recipe completely. It was a great dinner and great leftovers. Thanks

This is probably about the 4th time I have made this dish. I cooked it exactly as the recipe calls for with the exception of common sense such as draining the ham & onion mixture before adding to the potato, carrot & celery mixture along with stirring the roux after I poured it into the dish. It is a very good recipe and great to cook when you need to get your celery and other items used before they go bad.

Used leftover baked ham. I made more sauce by adding extra milk to the sauce recipe because it was really thick. I prefer more sauce on most everything so this worked out fine for us. This is a great comfort food dish!

We had to make some changes due to food allergies - soy milk and gluten free flour and we added a can of mushroom bits and left out the added salt, but they didn't change the end result too much.  We loved it and will definitely make it again.  We also agreed it would be great as a pot pie.

This is a great recipe for leftover ham.  I followed the recipe exactly except for one very minor change.  I used creole seasoning instead of salt as I do this with my chicken pot pie and I think it gives it a nice flavor boost. The creole seasoning is salty so adjust according to the saltiness of the ham (I used a tsp).  Oh, I also didn't boil the potatoes.  I just added them raw to the mixture and they cooked nicely in the oven. The ham I had was very salty so I used unsalted butter as well. As the recipe suggested, I added a little more milk to thin the sauce to the desired consistency.  This recipe is a keeper for me.  Thanks for sharing.

Very nice way to use leftover ham. I followed reviewer suggestions to stir fry the celery (nicer texture) and to double the potatoes and cheese. The extra potatoes should definitely provide 8+ servings.

Every member of my family likes this.  It is easy and pretty quickly prepared.  I divert from the original by using dried minced onion but otherwise I keep everything the same and it is delicious.

This was a yummy supper on a cold winter night. I did not peel the potatoes, and used a bag of mixed Mexican cheese that was in the fridge. Other than that I followed the recipe. I have ben asked to make it again!

It was incredible. The entire family loved it. They asked me to make it again. 

The best part may have been the left overs the next day. For a casserole this size to only last two days for a family of three, is a huge compliment.

Another time, I might not cook the diced potatoes so long as for them to be completely cooked. Also, I might try it with American processed cheese instead of cheddar. There was just something missing from the taste, and I think it was that. All in all, a good recipe and we enjoyed it.

I made it exactly to use some ham I had on hand. I did increase the milk and the cheese by half  for my husband who likes casseroles "cheesy and soupy". But the recipe was excellent by itself, thank you for submitting it.

I know everyone hates when you change anything in a recipe but sometimes you have to bc you don‚Äôt have all the ingredients or something just strikes you. This was awesome by itself but I used a ham steak for the ham potato  soup so it was left over so when I saut√©ed in butter and onion I added a dash of ground cloves and 2 tblsps of chopped celery with the onion. I did add 3 carrots with potatoes because we like carrots and extra potatoes. And I followed everyone else‚Äôs lead and made it a cheese sauce and mixed it together before putting it in the casserole and instead of breadcrumbs I used French fried onions- which made the dish awesome! My husband loved it, sent home leftovers to m6 daughters house and they loved it! Comfort food at its finest. Try the ham and potato soup- amazing!

This was delicious. I added peas and carrots. No pepper. I used Panko bread crumbs for better texture. May add bacon crumbs next time. My oldest son who never comments on anything asked for leftovers the next day. He said it was really good mom! Definitely going in rotation.

This was very tasty.  I doubled the sauce, boiled the veggies in chicken broth and used the liquid in the casserole.  I loved the suggestion of fried onion sub for bread crumbs.  Would work for Pork rinds as well, adapting for Keto.  Radishes, cauliflower as well for Keto family.

Not bad.  Could be worked up to a better dish with other additions (peas, etc.).  Definitely not for 8 people as a main dish - only as a side dish.

Cook the carrots & celery a bit before adding the potatoes.  my potatoes ended up mushy (but still good).  I used sharp cheddar (and more than 1 cup!)  It was VERY good an the fam said print it and keep it!

This was So-o-o-o good!! On faith, I doubled the recipe, put it in a 15 x 10 1/2" dish, and took it to a church potluck lunch.  There was one serving left.  So I came home and made a second, single recipe batch.  The only difference in first and second makings was that I added 1/8 tsp of curry to the cheese sauce.  (My wife is a curry fan, and she in not India.)

I added a bit of fresh garlic since my family likes to combine garlic with onions. I didn‚Äôt have a green pepper so I used a red one and it added a sweetness I don‚Äôt think the green one would have. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly. I found the potatoes where a little too cooked after the boiling step so next time I may add them to the celery and carrots later so they‚Äôre firmer when I combine all the ingredients.

We enjoyed this hearty meal.  I followed the recipe since it was my first time making it.  Next time I would add some ground mustard to the sauce for some extra flavor and mix butter with seasoned panic bread crumbs for more of a crunch.

You are using 3 separate pans to cook plus the casserole dish!  Way too much.  I make a delicious ham casserole using one saucepan and one casserole dish.  Bland sauce.

The recipe had too many steps, in my opinion, for the final result.  My family found it to be too bland for their tastes and weren't enthusiastic about the potatoes.  I would not make it again, but would use egg noddles instead of potatoes, heat the ham in the oven, then combine cooked noddles, cheese, and spices in a bowl, pour over heated ham.  Put back in the oven for maybe 20 mins.

My husband asked for more carrots next time, and I think I'll add a bag of frozen peas.  I also added a little leftover shredded cheese on top of the bread crumbs.  We're big fans!

This is a good, basic casserole. I used leftover smoked pork loin instead of ham, and I was in a hurry, so I used a bag of potatoes O‚ÄôBrien instead of chopping and cooking the potatoes, onions and peppers. I used the whole bag of potatoes, so I doubled the sauce. I also used pre-shredded carrots, and instead of saut√©ing them, stuck them in the microwave to soften. With those short cuts, it was very fast and easy to throw together and get in the oven for a quick meal.

It didn't make sense to me to put carrot and celery in with the potatoes, so I sauteed them with the ham green pepper and onions. I added the flour right to that mixture and added milk and stirred a can of celery soup with some black pepper and Paris Bistro epic cure spice blend . Took my drained salted potatoes into a buttered baking dish then poured the mixture on top. I did not add cheese to the sauce instead I sprinkled it on top of the mixture and added the bread crumbs..it was pretty good.

Hubby and I liked this quite a bit, but I found it a bit on the salty side.  I definitely wouldn't add table salt (the ham was salty enough), but otherwise I'd keep the remaining ingredients the same.

Great way to use leftover ham. My changes were that I pre-cooked the potato, carrot, and celery in one or those microwave steam bags to tender crisp stage. I had red bell pepper on hand so I saut√©ed that and the onion in the 1/4 cup of butter then added the flour. I was generous with the pepper, onion and cheese. We had this with a green salad, rolls, and tea. I'm looking to sub cornstarch for thickener to make this gluten free for celiac family members.

Awesome recipe made some changes just in the veggies, used what I had on hand, frozen peas and corn and fresh mushrooms instead of carrot, celery and green pepper, added minced garlic and doubled the recipe, I cooked it at 300 degrees for approx. 1 hour, I also omitted the bread crumbs and put in extra cheese and stirred it all together.  This was an awesome recipe, my family LOVED it!!!

Tasty.  Only issue I have with it is the part where it says it serves 8.  After making it and feeding people, it seems closer to 4 to 6 servings there.

My boys loved it!  I basically followed recipe but added a lot more milk.  White sauce was thick  and pasty like mashed potatoes so I added milk to make it more liquid. I also mixed the sauce into the ham and veg instead of just pouring on top. Gave 4 stars because there is no way this serves 8 if you follow the recipe as is.  Granted I have 3 strapping 6 foot tall boys but it made 4 maybe 5 servings max if not big eaters.  Will definitely make again just double everything.

This is delicious. I added a small amount of cauliflower that I had on hand. Also added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the onions. I omitted the bread crumbs.  Bake uncovered. The cheeses sauce gives it a scalloped potato flavor. Delicious, will be a family favorite.

I made this to use up leftover ham.  It was very tasty and is another great recipe to add to the "leftover" collection.  A few things.  Agree with other reviewers that 4-6 servings is more accurate unless you are feeding 8 children or people with limited appetites.  The sauce is VERY thick!  Either use more milk or less flour.  I would say 2 Tablespoons would be adequate.  It's easy to substitute other vegetables or meat than those listed here.  It's quite filling!

A very reasonable weeknight meal, a good way to use leftover ham, and a nice way to get kids to eat veggies. I needed another 1/4 cup or so of milk and put a little more cheese on top. I didn't get the value of the breadcrumbs on top -- they just sat there under the cheese -- perhaps with more liquid something good would happen?

I drop this to 4 stars because the kids didn't eat very much. So not a home run, though my wife and I liked it. Solid.

6 21 17  ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/228450/ham-casserole/ ... Homey, but good.  :)  'Short for time so cut the potatoes to 1/2" & put in water.  Turned on the heat.  Boiled 5 minutes.  Added the onion (1/4c), celery & carrot.  Boiled five more.  In the colander, I placed the ham.  Drained the potato mixture over the ham.  Added the sauce, 8x8.  It was a little too small for it, but hey, no big deal.  For the sauce, I used my white gravy as a reference since some had issues.  I melted 3T butter, added 2T flour, 1c milk, 1/2t salt, 1/4t pepper.  It's a stringy sauce, but in a casserole, that's fine.  'Got rid of leftover Christmas ham & gained freezer space, too!  K, 18, said she liked the potatoes.  :)

This was an ok casserole that was easy to make.  A good midweek meal, or a game day meal.  I would have given it a higher rating, but the bread crumbs just didn't cut it.

I made this for a large family gathering and it was a hit.  I doubled the vegetable and meat recipe for a 9x13 pan and tripled the sauce recipe.  I did mix the sauce in with the meat and veggies.  It was perfect and everyone loved it.  I'll definitely make it again.

I liked it.  I didn't use potatoes.  I used the package of 15 beans instead.  Did not use any milk or cheese.  Put all the rest if the ingredients in a slow cooker.  It was wonderful.

I thought this was very good. I left out the celery and added a little celery seed. This was just personal preference as I'm not big on celery. I did not have to boil the potatoes for 20 minutes, mine only took about 10, and I added a little season salt, and garlic powder to the milk and cheese mixture. I still had to add more salt and pepper at the table, but otherwise this was really good!  Oh, and instead of bread crumbs, I crushed up some Stove Top Chicken Stuffing and moistened it slightly with a little water and used that as the topping instead. It was delicious!

Loved it, but the cheese sauce needed a little tweaking. I added more milk and extra cheddar and parmesan cheese to it. I also substituted crushed Ritz crackers for the bread crumbs. This was a big hit with the family, and is a great way to use up leftover ham.

I made a few changes. I used a 9x13 casserole dish instead of a 2 quart pan. I didn't measure the potatoes, I just peeled and cut up about 5 potatoes. Then when I made the cheese sauce I used 2 cups of shredded cheese, we love cheese. Other than that I stuck to the recipe and it turned out great. My family loved it. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

This is great way to use ham! The recipe is so diverse! I added snap peas & carrots along w/the listed veggies. I love that you make your own cheese sauce. It‚Äôs not overly cheesy. I used seasoned Panko along w/seasoned breadcrumbs. Even better the day after!

made a half recipe, changed cooking method - saut√©ed veggies in 1/3 C butter, til slightly brown and tender.  
Microwaved in a steamer bag the sliced/chopped/peeled potato.  
When veggies were about done, added  chopped ham and potatoes,  stirred well. Added flour and milk as needed. Added about 1/8 tsp garlic powder.  Used more milk than called for a 1/2 recipe, prefer lot of sauce. 
Used fine shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  Crumbs as called for.  
After baking sprinkled about 1/4 cup of shredded sharp cheddar, as we like the taste.  
A forgiving recipe, can see this being a regular in our family of 2.  Might substitute cooked wide egg noodles. Or pasta shapes.  
Thank you for submitting this, it's a keeper.
Oh, easy clean up, one fry/sautee pan, throw away steamer bag.

This was delicious.  We didn't have the carrot, but it was good without it.  But it doesn't serve 8, at least as an entr√©e.  Double it, and you're good.  Like scalloped potatoes with extras!

This turned out so well, everyone loved it.  the only change i made was the bell peppers, I did not have any.  I added 2 tablespoons of jalapeno peppers (seeded, didn't want it too hot), amazing.  will be making it again,

This was a terrific dish!  What a great way to use leftover ham.
I didn't have regular bread crumbs, so I used Panko bread crumbs.  It gave a nice crunch to the casserole.

I agree that it feeds fewer adults than the recipe noted, but we loved this dish. I made a few variations to use what I had on hand. Instead of carrots and celery, I used chopped tomatoes and added cilantro (love cilantro). I also beat six eggs and poured it over the mix before the cheese and before baking. It turned out incredibly tasty and easy to make. This one's a keeper.

Yummy! Very good comfort food. Easy enough to prepare during work week. If you're planning to feed 4 adults, you should double the recipe though! Thank you for a great recipe!

It was so delicious and my husband told me to add it to my top 10 list. He had three helpings. I didn't like that there is a lot of butter and cheese. Next time I will modify with low fat cheese and Chicken broth instead of the butter.

I took the advice of others and saut√©ed ham, onion, celery and carrots together and then drained.  Cooked potatoes separately.  Decided to not include green pepper.  Also, stirred sauce in and not just pour on top.  It was good.

Very good and I will make again but, a few things: DOUBLE the cheese sauce!! It definitely needs it. I disagree with the prep time but I am not a fast vegetable cutter haha. This literally took me hours to prepare (I did make 2 of the casserole at once). If you keep your veggies already chopped on hand or use frozen veggies it definitely could be a quick, go-to meal! Also, this is hyped up to be a "one pot meal" but till I boiled the potatoes, cooked the ham, and then the cheese sauce, all in separate pans and pots, I had a sink full of dishes :(. Just a tad misleading in my opinion, but it tastes very good!!

This is my "go to" recipe after the holidays when I want to use up the leftover ham. I have been making it for several years now and it always gets an enthusiastic response. In fact, I'm making it for the second time this holiday season, on request. I add some nutmeg to the sauce, but that's just my personal. Taste preference. And I actually don't add cheese because of a family member who is lactose intolerant. It's still delicious!

Comfort food good.  I used ham steaks cut up combined with some Canadian bacon chunks.  4/5 kids loved it, the naysayer doesn't like anything creamy so his vote does not count.  I would definitely make this again.

Pretty good. Everyone liked it and it was a good way to use up some of the leftover ham. We added sour cream on top when we made our plates. Next time I will add some chopped green onions on top as well. Oh yeah, I left out the carrots because my husband doesn't like them.

This was very good.  Made good use of left over Christmas ham. Made it as it without the peppers as none were on hand.   My teen son recommended next time that I double the delicious cheese sauce.  I will mix it in with ham and onion next time.  He went back for seconds.  There were no left overs.   Overall a yummy recipe.  Will make again.

Better than I thought it would be, flavorful and satisfying. Good way to use up leftover ham. Since this was my first time making, I made exactly as recipe calls, except I steamed the potaotoes, carrots and celery versus boiling them. Wouldn't change much, the cheese sauce turned out nice, perfect consistency and browned nicely in oven, I would err on adding more cheese than less. Might change the breadcrumb topping, by making my own or using panko crumbs tossed with butter next time.

absolutely loved it. My 3 girls are picky eaters and they couldn't get enough of it. I had to double the recipe to make enough for 5 people. Super easy to follow. Only thing i might change next round is adding more ham. I love LOTS of meat in my casserole's.

I put a little more carrots in but other than that, I made it as directed. I would mix the cheese sauce in next time I make it, although when spooning it up it kind of mixed together a little so not a big deal either way.

We thought this was wonderful! Great flavor, and an excellent way to eat a ton of veggies. This was easy to make, even if it took a while to chop up the vegetables, but definitely worth the effort. All three of my kids ate this, and two of them wanted second helpings. So this will be made again in our house! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Very good. I will make again.
Changes: double the recipe (!), it only fed 3 servings. In my single batch I doubled the carrots, 1.5 the potatoes and let most skin on, took out celery (substitute for can of peas) and almost tripled the peppers.

It was well-received.  My daughter says it's a keeper.  I did leave out the green pepper because I didn't have any on hand, but I don't think it really needed it.  Can't wait for the leftovers tonight!

I made this casserole this past week, and my husband and brother liked it so much they had me make it again just last night.
However, I omitted the green peppers. It is SO yummy! 
It will quickly become a favorite in my house.

To save time, prepped everything in advance except the potatoes.  It still was more labor intensive than expected, but definitely delicious!  Don't care for green peppers so always sub jarred roasted red peppers, which gives any dish a bit of a kick.  Also would add another carrot.    Panko bread crumbs are preferred to regular for extra crunch.  May cut down on the cheese next time, but definitely will make again, especially in cooler months.   As another reviewer mentioned, 8 servings would not be enough for several adults, unless they're tiny portions and accompanied by a salad. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

Both my husband and I were disappointed with this recipe.  It tasted OK, but not worth the work or dirty dishes created.  I agree with other reviewers about the flour - to get a sauce consistency, I had to add at least another cup of milk.   We will not be making this one again.

Wanted something different and this was just the ticket.  I halved the recipe because I made it just for me.  I didn't have celery, but had broccoli, so I added that instead.  Delish!  I'll bet the leftovers will be just as good when I take them to work tomorrow.

This was very good which I'm glad because it's quite a lot of chopping and prepping.  I put around 1 3/4 cup of milk and it took a very long time for the sauce to thicken.  There's no way this is for 8 people.  More like 4 good plates.  I'll make again!  :-)

Excellent one-dish comfort meal.  I used 1 1/2 big russets, celery and carrot per recipe, and half a head of cauliflower and broccoli, which I boiled with the carrot for 6 minutes with the potatoes, which i boiled for 20 minutes. I found smoked ham steaks at the market and diced them. I doubled the sauce, (very necessary), and tripled the milk. The roux was very thick, but worked well as it melted into the dish while baking. I used swiss and cheddar in the sauce. For topping I used crushed Texas Toast croutons. Yum. I added 2 photos.

I followed the directions exact. It was okay. The sauce was pasty, so maybe less flour. My kids did not enjoy it at all. I probably won't be making this again.

The sauce is very bland. I added 1/2 tsp. dry mustard, which helped. Next time I'll use more.

I made this basically unchanged but added a pinch of Red Pepper Flakes, 1/4  teas.Granulated Garlic and 1/4 teas. Salt rather than 1/8 teas.
I made this for tomorrow night because I will be busy then so I increased the milk to 1 1/2 cups because I know the potatoes will absorb the moisture.  It tastes great.
Thanks for submitting this.

This is a good base for a ham & potato casserole but it is way too dry.  It also needs a LOT more seasoning (I think white pepper is best in a white sauce since it gives it a little zing).  I doubled the amount of sauce and added peas and extra carrots & onions.  This makes closer to 4-5 servings.

I made the recipe as written except increased the cheese and milk a bit.  The cheese sauce was too thick to really coat the rest of the ingredients, so it seemed a little dry to me.  There was really nothing to bring it all together, so it seemed a little bland.  It wasn't a big hit in our house.

Great base recipe,  definitely comfort food! I'm the only one who likes green peppers in our household, so I used frozen peas instead. They were great,  and I was told to put more keys and next time! I also doubled the potatoes, but everything else was left the same.  I thought the sauce was perfect.  The recipe (with doubled potatoes) fed five hungry adults, with requests to make it again.  Oh, I did toss the breadcrumbs with a few tablespoons of melted butter before putting on top of the casserole for a little more flavor and color.

This was a great easy recipe.  Turned out perfectly. I did add a bit more milk as I found sauce too thick. I would recommend and I would definitely make this again.

My husband and I liked this very much.  His only recommendation was to up the pepper to 1/4 tsp and, instead of bread crumbs, use crushed Lay's Potato chips for the topping to give it that little extra salty crunch.

We all really liked this, but I made some changes based on what I had available.  I used broccoli (and a lot of it) instead of carrot.  I substituted swiss cheese and put a red raspberry-wasabi mustard (about 1/4 cup) into the roux which added great flavor.  I did not use butter when sauteing the onion/ham and did not miss it.  I did stir well before baking.  Next time, to make it healthier, I will add a lot more vegetables, either more broccoli or additional carrot.  Cauliflower would be good too.

I made this in my ninji cooker except for the flour milk and butter. I did that on the stovetop then poured it into the ninji cooker on top of everything else. I also did not need to bake it the 30 minutes. I also used a small sleeve of ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. It was outstanding. My only regret is that I did not double the receipe so we could have leftovers. I will make this again. I may even make it using smoked sausage instead of ham because I think that would be really good as well.

in the sauce you can add some nutmeg or cumin or what ever flavor fits you...also if sauce is too thick add more milk because if its thick before it goes in oven it will be really thick after...

I made this exactly as written. The sauce was way too thick and there wasn't enough of it. 1 Cup of bread crumbs was way too much and they just sat on top of the sauce while the sauce sat on top of the ham and vegetable mixture. I would definitely make a thinner sauce by adding maybe another 1/2 C of milk and stir it in instead of just pouring over the top. Use only 1/2 to 3/4 C of bread crumbs.

I've been making this for years and love it, thanks!  I am lazy so just add cream of mushroom soup instead of the white sauce...my mom also often used  wide egg noodles, and added corn.  I get annoyed with reviewers who say "it's ok but here are my changes.." so I'm saying yours is GREAT!  I just wanted to give some options.  The cheese is a great idea, and the bread crumbs!  Thanks!

I made this tonight and it smelled wonderful while cooking! I agree it could be spiced up with some dry mustard powder or a tiny bit of nutmeg in the sauce. We do not like green peppers so I substituted frozen peas. I also picked up shredded carrots, diced onion, and chopped celery from our grocer's salad bar to speed things up. This was easy and tasty! I would make it again.

A lot of work for something without much flavor. I made a lot of changes first being using  the same cheese sauce I use for my regular mac and cheese.  Used diced green and red peppers instead of carrots and celery.  (don't like cooked carrots) and used a can of cream of celery soup.

I love recipes that are a good base that I can play around with to suit my family's taste. I doubled the sauce recipe, using corn starch as we are a wheat free family, added a good dose of Slap Your Mama for a kick & also used ground turkey instead of ham because that's what I had on hand.  I also used a bag of frozen fajita veggies instead of the fresh peppers and added garlic to that as it sauteed.  I ended up with enough to do 2 casseroles, one that I'm going to stick in the freezer to see how it fares as a freezer meal. Admittedly I didn't measure my veggies, just used a bag of red potatoes, a bag of carrots & a bunch of celery, but I think that's what's wonderful about these types of recipes. They still turn out beautifully even when you're a mish mash cook like myself.

My fussy men couldn't get enough of this. I changed it up a bit, added flour to can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 and a half cups milk. I went heavy on the cheddar too. Also topped it with stove top. Great way to get rid of stuff in fridge.

Definitely comfort food. Good for 4-5 adults with moderate appetites. I substituted Parmesan cheese, added herbs and I was happy with the results. Because of the butter and cheese I wouldn't often make this dish, but next time I will add kale or broccoli.

I made this casserole the other day and my husband loved it. I followed the recipe fairly closely accept I cooked the ham, onion and green pepper in olive oil instead of butter. I also added mushrooms which I needed to use up to that mixture. Because of lack of time instead of making my own cheese sauce I used a can of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup of milk. I heated that on the stove to melt the cheese. For a topping I used Panko crumbs which gave the casserole a nice crunchy topping. It was scrumptious and I will definitely make it again.

Boring. The sauce was just plain bland and thick. We could barely taste the cheese, and I used sharp cheddar. Next time I would cut the flour in half, and add more cheese. Additionally, this recipe would in no way feed eight people (adults) unless you had a lot of sides to go with it.

This was great in the slow cooker as well.  I skipped the boiling and sauteeing steps and put all of the raw veggies and ham in the slow cooker, then made the cheese sauce and mixed it in with the meat and veggies.  Cooked on High for 3 hours.  The cheese sauce initially looked too thick- but it thins out a lot while cooking so by the end it was a perfect consistency for casserole.  When it was done I added the breadcrumbs and stuck the crock under the broiler for a few min. The green pepper adds that extra something that most ham and potato casseroles are lacking.

I've tried this recipe twice and both times I custom make it to what we all prefer and I make it based on how much ham is left over. I don't use butter often so for the onion and ham I heated with coconut oil. I also used whole wheat flour and that worked just fine for the sauce! My family has loved this recipe twice , we literally eat ham once or twice a year, so for the day after, this is perfect! Next time I may try with a different vegetable, maybe yams!

This recipe was extremely good. I had sharp cheddar on hand so that's what I used, and also used skim milk. Followed rest of recipe exactly. I agree that it only serves 6, at most.

It was just ok.  The potatoes & carrot need to be undercooked prior to going into the casserole, as they continue cooking in the oven.  The sauce needs to be cooked for quite a while to blend the flavours so it doesn't taste like flour paste.  Additional cheese would help too.  It was rather bland.  Not great, but not bad.  I might use it as a starter base if I had the leftover ham & potatoes again.

This was good but next time I would add half the green peppers they were over powering and I would skip the rue and make a sauce similar to one used in cheesy hash browns and add a packet of dry ranch.

It was fantastic. I didn't drain the ham saut√© and I did almost double the meat & veggies. Also added broccoli & left over saut√©ed mushrooms.  And added an additional cup of Parmesan cheese. Was delicious-not bland nor pasty. Thanks!

Excellent casserole Jodster! I took the advice of another and used 1 bag of cubed frozen potatoes and doubled the white sauce (butter, flour, milk). I don't have bread crumbs so I topped w/ cheddar cheese. Thank you for a great recipe. I have 2 teenage boys that are eating machines! I have to keep some kind of cooked casserole in the frig at all times. Today these boys went paddle boarding in our neighborhood lake and came back w/ their friends and ate the whole casserole! It didn't even make it to the frig. Oh well, I'm off to make my 2nd batch - LOL.

This was surprisingly good.  I was leary while making it but the reviews were good and I had some ham that needed to used.  I added some fresh mushrooms when I sauteed the onions and I left out the salt as my ham was very salty.  It was very good and my husband and I both loved it!

This was just OK.  Very bland and too much bread crumbs made it dry.  I had to throw out the left overs because no one would come back for seconds.  I'll try it again using some of the suggestions offered by other raters and maybe a couple of my own.

Somewhat bland.  I added lots of fresh ground pepper and dill, but it wasn't enough to wow me.  I highly suggest extra seasoning.  I used a smoky, picante flavored provolone cheese instead of the cheddar for an extra kick, which was great.  I also subbed in sweet red and orange peppers for the green bell pepper and doubled the amount of carrots and celery.  I will probably make this again, but with extra seasoning.  Great for leftover ham after a holiday or once spiral hams are on deep discount following the holidays.

Weird, but not offensive. The kids wouldn't eat it, so I threw a frozen pizza into the oven for them. The milk/cheese layer wasn't able to be poured because it was a congealed glob, so I spread it on top and there it stayed even after baking. It didn't seep into the cracks and crevices like I expected. Also, far too much prep work, pre-cooking, and dirty dishes to try this again.

Very, very good - even with my changes. There are only 2 of us so I cut the amount of potatoes and ham in half. After the casserole was built, I felt like it was actually too saucy (hard for me to imagine!) so I added a really well drained bag of thawed, frozen spinach. It worked but we still ended up with one meal for tonight and one to freeze (YEA!). I only used one pot for the prep - when the potato group was done cooking and draining, I used the same pot to cook the rest of the veggies and ham. Then they were mixed in with the potatoes and the sauce was constructed using the same pot - it worked just fine. Thanks for the recipe - we'll use it often for our left over ham!

This recipe was the perfect casserole to use up the leftover ham from the holidays.   I preferred this over scalloped potatoes because it has other veggies in it - and goodness knows it is hard enough to find a way to get the kids to eat their veggies.  I doubled the carrots, onions and peppers and there was plenty of sauce to cover it all.  Another plus was that it was easy to make and used ingredients I always have on hand.  I will be making this one every time I buy a ham.

Good and easy way to use leftover ham. Next time I will probably use butter tossed corn flakes instead of bread crumbs to top the dish. I also used a little less butter than the recipe called for and it was still good!

This was surprisingly delicious.  I didn't change a thing except made one and a half times the cheese sauce and mixed it in a bit.

We liked the dish however we used a small onion - chopped, 1/4 green pepper - chopped, 2 carrots and prob 2.5 - 3 cups of potatoes.  Great dish that could be made ahead of time too!

My family loved this casserole.  I had made a large ham and had leftovers to use.  Be sure to drain the potato, celery and carrots really well so that it doesn't get watery when baking.  The creamy cheese sauce on the top added a lot of flavor to the dish.  We had one serving left and our son stopped for lunch the next day and finished it off!

It was pretty good, a little dry though. It might not heat up well the next day in the microwave if it is already a little dry.  It only serves 6 unless you serve small portions.

Very good recipe for using leftover ham! I boiled the onion with the potatoes and carrots, saving 3 tblsp of butter from my fat content! Did not saut√© the ham or use celery or green pepper (but they would have been tasty additions). Used Monterey Jack, which I grated directed into the butter-flour sauce to melt. Did add pepper but no salt. After pouring sauce over the ham and potato mix, I spooned a layer of Greek nonfat plain yogurt on top and under the crumbs, to add a sour cream effect. Used about 8 Ritz crackers in place of crumbs. Put it all together early in the day to cook later; by that time, the cracker topping was soft (like soft bread crumbs). Thanks for sharing!

Tried this tonight.  It did have good flavor but my husband did not care for it because he said it was too dry.  I think next time I might double the sauce portion.

This was a good basic recipe. I knew as soon as I made the gravy that it was going to need more moisture. I added 1 Cup chicken broth & turned the heat up to 400¬∞ for the last 13 minutes. That still wasnt enough moisture at serving time. Next time I am going to add 1 can of cream of chicken soup & top it off with 1 can of water. This will also give more flavor that was lacking. Also added fresh diced mushrooms.

Delicious way to use leftover Easter ham. I really liked this casserole. I have made several ham and potato casseroles over the years and this is one of the best. Served with cinnamon applesauce and biscuits. Great comfort meal.

It was OK.  Made 4 fair sized portions so definitely double in you are cooking for 6.  My family liked it, but I though it was fair at best.  The cheese sauce had little flavor.  Not enough meat.  I maymake this again.  It was just kind of "there".

This turned out really good. All my kids (minus one because of the onions and peppers) gobbled it up. Even my husband loved it. It was pretty easy, and I wouldn't change a thing. Can't wait to make it again.

Very delicious, but it needed way more than 1 cup of milk. Next time I'll start with two, and maybe a little more cheese...also, stir it into the potatoes. There wasn't enough sauce, and it didn't get bubbly, but the taste was still great!

Really good tasting casserole. Couple of items that may help... I had to bake for 40 minutes until bubbly. I threw away about half the carrot, just to much orange from a large one.

This was surprisingly delicious.  We had tons of ham leftover so I decided to give this one a try and my husband really enjoyed it as well.  The only substitution that I recommend is crushed cornflakes on top instead of breadcrumbs.  I used a little extra ham and potatoes, just to use it up which was fine.

I just wrote a review of this recipe and LOVED this cassrole, but I forgot to mention that I added melted butter to Panko bread crumbs and used that for the topping - made a nice crunch.  Also, I didn't have any bell peppers so I didn't use them - only onion.  I used 1/4 tsp. of both salt and pepper in the roux which was perfect for our taste.  This casserole is one of our favorites and an excellent way to use left-over ham.

Very simple and a great way to use up leftovers we had from Christmas.  Had leftover ham and some oven potatoes that I diced up with the rest of the vegis.  True test was that the kids had seconds and that never happens!

Very good! I don't use green peppers so we used orange for this recipe but kept everything else the same. The girls (ages 15, 17, and 18) loved it. The husband said that he didn't like the peppers (not a surprise) but realized they were important so said to make it the same way next time. Victory! This dinner made a lot of dirty dishes though. Going to try to modify the cooking (maybe use a dutch oven) to reduce that next time.

This was awsome I used half cup whipping cream and half cup milk but ended up using more milk because it was too thick, used sharp cheddar cheese.  My 8 & 10 year old cleaned their plates.  This is a keeper!
