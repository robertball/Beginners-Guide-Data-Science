Classic!  This is THE method to use for really good mashed potatoes.  It is essential to add salt to the cooking water - oh and start with cool water - bring to temp and then reduce the heat so the water just simmers, not boils.  This way the taters cook evenly.  Thanks for posting this Chef John.

Thank you to Chef John for making the video. I couldn't figure out why I kept getting starchy water until he explained the method of cutting the potatoes lengthwise vs. cutting into cubes. I ran out of whole milk, so I used buttermilk. Plus, to make them extra creamy, I added 3 tbs. of sour cream. 

By making those adjustments to the recipe, I'll just say that they were such a hit at thanksgiving dinner, all we had to take home was the container I brought them to dinner in!

Fluffy, flavorful clouds in my mouth.  And so easy.  Followed exactly except used 1% milk (was on hand).   As for the masher, my sister has our Mother's which he recommends, so I used mine which he doesn't like.  Still, the potatoes were wonderful!!!  His video shows the techniques very clearly. Find at foodwishes.com.

This recipe could be perfect if the measurement for the potatoes was given in a measurement that isn't subjective. your large may be medium or extra large to someone else, which will change the end product. It should be revised to be by weight or cups.

These potatoes come out well (and the instructions make them very easy to make), but they are bland.  I learned the hard way that my family expects more to mashed potatoes.  If you like good, old fashioned "just potatoes" then this is definitely the recipe for you.

This really is the simplest and tastiest way to make mashed potatoes. I like to use warmed evaporated milk instead of whole milk. This recipe makes the fluffiest potatoes. NOTE: This is also good with a couple cloves of homemade roasted garlic.

Thank you Chef John!  I got so tired of watery mashed potatoes that I started buying the Bob Evans in the refrigerated area of the grocery.  My husband couldn't believe it, I told him I had yet to make any better than Bob.  That is until now!  I made these last night with some country steak and gravy and they were delicious!  I did just as the recipe called except I only had 2% milk so that is what I used.  Luckily I already had the right potato masher and not one of those other weird looking objects that Chef John was showing in the video NOT to use!  Thanks again, I'm planning on making your mushroom gravy this evening to have with some more mashed potatoes and meatloaf!  We can't wait!

Thanks for posting this video as I needed something simple to follow for my office Thanksgiving Potluck. I waited until about 11pm the night before the potluck, before getting this going, so a lot of the pointers like how to cut them in halves helped out in the process for boiling them. Along with what masher to get which I picked up the same style one Chef John recommended, and the other little pointers given, all a big help in keeping me moving along with the prepping, and cooking, and mashing (at the ridiculous hour I was cooking these!)  I made just over 10 lbs so I got done about 1:30am!  All around a big thanks for the informative video.
 
 Russet Potata!!! I love how he says it. This guy's personality is awesome. "What the hell is that?" ..."Two Laps ...Restrain Yourself" ! Thanks Chef John.

I 'inherited' the retro potato masher from the '60's, but had never used it.  Always used the mixer to whip my potatoes--same ingredients.  WOW!!!  What a difference this process makes in the end result!  The potatoes cooked much better cut lengthwise; the water I drained off was still clear, not starchy.  The potatoes mashed perfectly, creamy not sticky.  Will never use my mixer again to make mashed potatoes! I do recommend you microwave the milk slightly to warm it so the potatoes don't cool down as quickly.

Always make them like this but they are much better if you heat the milk first! Always smooth and fluffy!

good recipe, but i really believe in heating the milk before you add it to the potatoes.  but here's the kicker, if you go to watch his videos, I stumbled on his cheater pierogies and THANK YOUUUUUU for pointing out wonton wrappers.  OMG you don't even know how happy you've made me.  Can't wait to use your cheat!

I live in Costa Rica, for some reason the mashed potatoes usually come out pasty till now. I tried this way, followed the recipe exactly and am very, very happy with the fluffy non-pasty mashed potatoes. We have not been having mashed potatoes for over 3 years here, that is now changed, both the wife and myself love these mashed potatoes, this is a blessing, great recipe John, thank you!

I thought I made great potatoes but these are my new favorite. My family loved them and all of us had seconds and were still looking for thirds. The only thing I did differently is used 5 large red potatoes because that's what I had. Also, the recipe doesn't state how much salt to add to the water, so I added 1 Tbsp. Just another 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/4 tsp of pepper at the end and they were perfect. Thanks for the recipe. Yum!

needs sour cream instead of milk (milk is bland) and a pinch of cayenne (just a pinch) to open your eyes.  And garnish with some chives.

Ok. I was skeptical, but I needed some "leftover" mashed potatoes for another recipe, and I had the russets (I usually use red-skin-on for my mash), so I figured I'd try this recipe. I had to watch the video to believe that you only have to cut each potato in half, but I followed the directions and ingredient amounts (except I used 2% milk, cause that's all I had). All went well, until I added the milk, and the potatoes turned soupy, and I thought "oh, NO!". This is the first time I've ever followed amounts for the butter and milk, so I just figured it was too late, so I might as well keep stirring. Well, didn't they just tighten up to the perfect consistency! I was amazed (and relieved). Mine are not completely lump-free because I was mashing in a non-stick pan (the only kind I own), so I could have mashed more vigorously, but they are probably the best "plain" mashed potatoes I've ever made. My mom always used a motorized hand mixer for mashing her potatoes, so for all I know, I grew up eating gluey potatoes. No more for me and mine. Thanks, Chef John. You made me a believer. 4/4/15 UPDATE I just made these using four Yukon golds, and they came out great with a slightly shorter cooking time (15-17 minutes). I omitted the pepper because I'm using the mash in a roll recipe, and I did an extra couple of turns with a regular dinner fork to take out the lumps (I'm still using non-stick, so I have to be careful not to scratch the finish). Thanks for the forgiving recipe.

You can't go wrong!  I've always preferred using the "hand mashed" method rather than whipping potatoes to death with a mixer!  They get rubbery! (gross lol) anyway - these are perfect and i did purchase specially white ground pepper.  I've never liked black pepper much, the white is perfect!  thank you!

okay I know you think you know how to make potatoes but um... when you make this and follow exactly you realize you don't.  Potatoes are so simple but so easy to mess up.  This is how to do them right.

Everyone seems to be able to make mashed potatoes... but not me.  I know I  never added this much butter & milk.  Maybe I over or under cooked the potatoes before?  I'm not sure how else I could goof up something so simple.   I followed this & they turned out great.  Thanks for the help Chef John.

My 1st review and on something as simple as mashed potatoes but I feel like it's the right place to start and I'm a big fan of Chef John.  He has inspired me to find my way in the kitchen. I have been slowly learning his recipes week by week. I think if you start with mashed potatoes just to ensure you know how to make a simple side dish that makes any meal a little better with some fresh mashers. The secret and what helped me by far is that 30 seconds back on to evaporate any left over moisture. 

I encourage you to follow it exactly like he shows in the video. Mash without any butter first, then add your butter and milk, I like to use buttermilk sometimes. Master this and then venture out. I can almost make a meal out of some mashed potatoes.  Thanks Chef John, the very best to you and your loved ones over this upcoming holiday season.

Honestly, I'm a mediocre cook and having been making mashed potatoes for 25 years with mixed results.  Foolishly, I hardly ever watch the attached how-to videos because I always assume I know what I'm doing.  I mean, mashed potatoes- how hard can it be?  Wow.  I had no clue what I was doing wrong.  Followed the recipe and video tips and the potatoes were outstanding!  Chef John, I am now a devoted fan and clearly I need to pay more attention to your videos.

I followed the recipe exactly, and they were not "fluffy and lump free". I ended up having to add more milk and butter than the recipe states.

Watch the video and cook these following the recipe exactly.  Perfect!  AND they stay a perfect texture as leftovers.  We heated in microwave three days later and they were not soggy.  The best straight-forward mashed potatoes recipe ever.  Thank you again, Chef John.  You are my go-to recipe submitter on this site.

These were terrific...and I quadrupled the recipe. I've never had a tried and true recipe for mashed potatoes, and did quite a bit of research for thanksgiving dinner. Chef John's recipes never fail. Especially helpful in his video were the hints for cutting the potatoes and proper mashing techniques. Will absolutely make these again!

This is the absolute best way to make the PERFECT mashed potatoes.  I did a test of this recipe before the first thanksgiving I have hosted for my family.  I found that using white pepper was a MUST. The only modification I made was that I put 2 cloves of garlic in the water while the potatoes boiled.  Thank you chef john!!

I've made them this way for many years, with a few variations. Add 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise.(less whole milk) Also 1 tablespoon sour cream! Be careful when adding and blending/mashing to NOT make them to watery/whippy. Taste is outstanding! (Yes they are very fattening, but ultimate comfort food;-)

Chef John  thank you for this recipe. And video very helpful. 5stars I make mashed potatoes at least once a week. Always your recipe. Sometimes  I add garlic to the water then mash as usual. Follow this recipe you can't go wrong. Watch the video.  Helpful hints  many people are saying this is bland..  Season your food to your liking. Start small.  Taste. Add a little more.  I always add more butter.  2% milk or some half and half. Sometimes  cheese really good cheese.  Whip with a good wire whisk..     Keep warm.   Enjoy this recipe.     Thanks chef John.

Love this recipe. Watch the video as it'll tell you about technique which is really important. I didn't have the mentioned/preferred masher and mashing twice over was not enough, there were still some clumps.  I also had a lot of potatoes so I guess you have to adjust accordingly. That said whipping them really did make them fluffy. I feel that this recipe needs a bit more in terms of flavor. You could make them garlic mashed or with sautéed onions. That's why I gave it 4 stars: a little bland.

This is exactly what I do only I use regular all-purpose potatoes.  Mashing them with a masher is the way to go.  Don't use a mixer unless you like Elmer' s glue consistency. Also I warm up the milk in the micro first.

We could probably make an advertisement with this recipe.  'Nothing gets between me and my mashed potatoes.'  Keep it simple and let the mashed potato strut its stuff.  Very good.

I made this recipe almost exactly like it asked.  I only have 2% milk, and had whip cream.  I used 5 potatoes and 3/4 cup of milk.  1/2 of 2% milk and added the whip cream to 3/4 cup....followed it exactly!!!

I am surprised to see people, let alone Chef's, still making this mistake. Once the potatoes are lightly mashed add just the butter and fully incorporate. The butterfat will cover/coat/surround/encapsulate all the starch molecules before they are watered down by the milk. I add the salt and white pepper at this point and mix again. Then start adding whole milk and whipping with a fork, drizzle, whip. drizzle, whip. Adjust anything as needed, put in a bowl, top with a pat of cold butter, and feed to the animals.  Try it and you will see a difference. Same goes with using white pepper.

Super easy directions for superior mashed potatoes. Who knew it was this easy to make great mashed potatoes?  All these years I've been overcooking and overbeating and wondering why I ended up with a starchy, gluey white glob.  I LOVE it when you find an easier way to prepare a dish and it gives you superior results!  Not fancy, not with a bunch of extras added in, just good ole basic potato flavor in mashed form that delivers an incredible, light and creamy dish. Real food prepared the way it should be. That's a win-win recipe!!  I didn't tell DH I was making mashed potatoes a new way, just waited to see if he would notice.....and he did, he absolutely loved these!  My hat's off to you Chef John! Thanks for another great recipe!

This worked exactly like Chef John said it would.  It was a revelation!  Easy, straightforward and very good.  I think I like my potatoes a bit creamier,  but it may be the way I boiled the potatoes.

Very good! Covering the potatoes with salted water BEFORE bringing to a boil is so important (I sprinkled 2T of salt over the potatoes). My potatoes took about 30-35 minutes but I am also at high altitude. I somehow don't have a masher, so used a fork with no issues at all. I was very pleased with the texture and taste, though I added garlic powder after taste-testing because GARLIC! This is a great basic recipe; feel free to mash in non-salt seasonings, herbs, or even vegetables. Made it twice and will keep making!

This is not a fancy bells and whistles recipe (and I prefer my potatoes like this) just simply delicious and perfectly textured classic mashed potatoes. I made recipe exactly as written (I always do the first time I make something) and it is perfect as is or as a base for more flavor variations.  I am definitely using this recipe for Thanksgiving/Xmas coming up, a nice upgrade from the  homemade glue-like potatoes like last year. It's all in the technique..

I've always made decent mashed potatoes and took for granted that it is a "no brainer" thing to make.  So out of curiosity, I tried Chef John's directions figuring there would be no way his technique would make a difference.  Holy Cow was I shocked!  The taters were so light and fluffy and delicious.

Perfect, creamy, fluffy mashed potatoes every time!  When I boil my potatoes,  I add a chicken bouillon cube and some garlic to the water for extra flavor. Delicious!

This was easy and delicious. I did substitute buttermilk and 2 tablespoons of sour cream instead of the whole milk.  I will definitely make these again.

And they really are perfect! Cutting the potatoes lengthwise? Who knew? All I can say is that's it's great to see a simple, honest recipe with some great new technique.

Fast, simple, tasty. I used Yukon gold potatoes and use the masher in stead of the whisk. Mashed potatoes have a few lumps by not using thevwhisk but I like my potatoes this way.

I have been making mashed potatoes for well over 40 years.  This is a basic mashed potato recipe for those who do not know how to do it or are unsure of how much butter and milk to add.  What makes this perfect is "salt and pepper to taste".  If your taste says these are bland, add more.  Mashed potatoes, basic mashed potatoes, included these ingredients, nothing more, nothing less.  So rate this according to that rather than how YOU make mashed potatoes.  Personally, I do not use an electric mixer. I use a masher. For me, with my experience, that makes them most fluffy. For others a mixer works best.  I would not rate the recipe on my preference.  I would not rate them as "bland" because I failed to "season to taste", either.  Nor would I downgrade a recipe rating because I am experienced and prefer evaporated milk to whole milk or cream cheese to whatever.  The point of this recipe is not to make the perfect advanced mashed potato recipe but rather to make the basic that experience will allow you to adjust to your taste.  Like adding chives, bacon bits, omitting the pepper all together and adding garlic powder and minced onion, which is our favorite.  Thanks, Chef John.  Your recipes are always spot on for perfect beginnings.  Your more advanced recipes are perfect for me, as well.  Love your recipes, videos and more!

I've been known for my mashed potatoes as well but this recipe solves several logistical problems i.e. Cutting the chunks to equal size, not over beating. I'm impressed. I was skeptical but when he started the video recommending russets, I decided to give it a listen. Glad I did. Excellent.

If you add cream cheese to these mashed potatoes you will want to save them all for your self.  You might gain 50 lbs. but well worth it.

Best mashed potatoes I've ever made in my life. Period. I usually like to tweak mashed potatoes because I don't find them interesting. Well, now I know why. I wasn't making them the right way. No cheese, spices, or funky twists needed here. To me eating these potatoes pure were the proof that they were perfection. They were amazing. Didn't need changes. Didn't need additions. Just didn't need anything except a big helping. I already know how I'm gonna make my mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving. Thank you Chef John for opening my eyes to what mashed potatoes are really all about.

I loved the tip to just cut the potatoe in half rather than in chunks or quarters. I have been doing it the other way for years, and I have to say, Chef John's technique was way better. PLUS, is saves time on the chopping block. PLUS, I think the potatoes mashed more evenly this way. Thanks Chef John!

Not perfect in my opinion. I give 1 Star because this recipe calls for no sour cream. Yes, adding sour cream to your mashed/smashed potatoes makes a world of difference! It gives them a great flavor and makes them less dry. I’ll stick with my recipe for mashed potatoes.

No changes.  I believe the secret  is in draining the potatoes and adding them back into the hot pot for 30 seconds to dry them out.

Awesome taters!  I normally just buy them pre-made or resort to using instant because all my previous attempts with homemade resulted in dense, heavy potatoes .  These were perfect-light and fluffy just like the video promised.  Will be using this as my go-to recipe from now on.
I have to admit I was skeptical because the video made it look way too easy but Chef John has never steered me wrong in the past and certainly didn't this time either:)
Thanks Chef John!

I've always cut my potatoes into small pieces (in my mind, to get them to cook more quickly).  Chef John's method of cutting them ONCE down the middle saves so much time, and the potatoes really did come out fine.  I used half and half instead of milk because that's what my mother-in-law uses.  Otherwise, followed exactly and they came out great!

These were a little bland so the next time I made them I added some sour cream.  This makes for richer mashed potatos. If I am out of sour cream I use just cream just like my grandmother made them.

LOVED these potatoes. They came out light and fluffy. No lumps. 

I added roasted garlic to them. I, also, 1/8 cup milk and 1/8 cup of heavy cream. It made these the best mashed potatoes I've ever made.

Very bland.  I made them better by adding a bit of 1/2 & 1/2, additional sea salt, lemon pepper, and a spice blend called, Spike.  I also decided (on my second try because I usually love Chef John's recipes so much) to boil the potatoes in organic chicken broth.

I only give it a three star because I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't really work out as it was describe. The potato took way longer than 20 min to cook. And the amount of milk and butter is too little. My mashed potato came out so dry! But it tastes pretty good. That's the upside. I will make it again in the future. Just have to add more milk and butter perhaps.

This is a simple and basic recipe, but gives you excellent mashed potatoes that are evenly cooked (please do look at video for tips and tricks) and perfectly seasoned.

The ingredients are simple and good, 
the method is laborious. I suggest investing in a potato ricer.
Fast, easy, consistently perfect mashed potatoes!

These were so much less time consuming than every other recipe I've tried! I just threw the potatoes, butter, milk, salt & pepper in my Kitchen-Aid mixer and started on low and then sped it up to whipped texture. So good! And so easy! My toddler will eat anything if surrounded my mashed potatoes.  This is a game changer!

UPDATE: I tripled this recipe and used red potatoes this year for Thanksgiving, and then added the full Boursin garlic and herb, packaged soft cheese.  It was great - easy!

While they were still hot I briefly used the stir setting of my blender instead of a potato masher. Mine were not as chunky, they were more of a smooth texture similar to instant but we loved every bite and after it sat for a bit to come back for evening seconds was even better than when they were fresh. When I get a masher I will try it the proper way but as far as I am concerned they were perfect in every way. As good as what granny used to make if not better. Thank you Chef John!

Mashed potatoes were the one thing that I stopped bothering to make from scratch because they were always inconsistent, dense, dry, etc. But OMG! These are in fact better than Bob Evans's refrigerated mashed potatoes. Amazing! My tweaks: Instead of adding salt to the water, I added two packets of Goya's chicken bullion (game changer) and italian seasoning for a bit of color and extra flavor. I didn't have the masher, so I used a large silicone whisk. Perfect! They whipped up in seconds. I stopped eating to write this review. They were that good! :)

Best mashed potatoes I have ever made. The video was helpful. The only change I made was using nonfat milk, but I added a dollop of sour cream. They were a hit. Perfect consistency and taste! Thank you!

Finally! I can make mashed potatoes that everyone raves about! It was great to not bring out or clean up a mixer. I needed to watch the video also, as the technique shown make a big difference. I also warmed my milk (used part 1% and part half and half). Loved the white pepper in there. Thank you Chef John!

I love this easy recipe. I used 1/2 cup of canned milk instead of whole milk and WOW. my potatoes came out much creamier and a fantastic taste. So my suggestion is instead of whole milk, try  can milk (evaporated milk). U will be amazed at the difference it makes.

This is exactly how I make mine, including the drying after draining and the dry mash, followed by butter mash, followed by milk!  But I'm anxious to try just cutting the potatoes in half length-wise.  Thanks Chef John...you always give me something new to try!

Classic, perfect mashers! May I add 2 options? First, use heavy whipping cream, go all out for even tastier spuds! Second, if you can steam the spuds rather than boiling, try it. Lastly, a trick from a chef friend in the Air Force--to resuscitate cold leftover spuds, nuke them until hot and rewhip with more butter and cream. You'll swear they are fresh-made, it's amazing! Try it, your family will be impressed!

He's right, perfect fluffiness! I used 2% milk and they were fine. A little more butter would be even better, but these were good as is without being too fattening for a regular meal.

PERFECT! Boiling in salted water, slicing the potatoes in half length-wise only, and returning the pot to the stove just after draining the water to dry the potatoes before mashing were all new, essential tips. Turned out amazing, impressed all of my Thanksgiving guests. Thanks Chef John!

These potatoes are soft, fluffy, delicious and really easy to make. I served it with Chef John's mushroom gravy and it was such a hit at the dinner table. Thank you for this recipe!!

When I usually make mashed potatoes I have some left for a lunch meal the next day; when made this for my family there was none left after supper!  Chef John’s instructional video gives some great tips and make the difference we all tasted.  I did “tweak” Chef John’s recipe ever so slightly; Chef John called for ½ cup of milk and I used 2/3 cup of milk. This seemed to make the potatoes a touch creamier.  I recommend this recipe highly as does my family!!

This is an easy and tasty way to make mashed potatoes. I never knew all those tips and tricks he mentioned! I added basil, chives, and sour cream to mine and used 2% milk. These make perfect mashed potatoes - I'm going to make these again soon!

This guy is hilarious.  "Red potatoes with skins, yuck."  I feel the same way even though my boyfriend and mom don't.   When I first saw the ingredients list I thought, no way, this is too simple.  But after I saw the video I like how he doesn't just tell you what to put in the potatoes but the METHOD for cooking perfect mashed potatoes.  I am also a "mashed potato freak" and will correct all the my mistakes.

Very good! And yes, I did watch the video on making mashed potatoes....and I did actually learn something new and that was to let the excess water steam off the potatoes after drained and before mashing....I have never done that before. All in all, a good mashed potato and we gravey for the top with our meatloaf. Thanks!

Chef John, I married my Carlos 22 years ago. His mother showed me how to make these tatoes. She/ I use much more pepper, so you can See the pepper and we keep the peel on. Mom used to peel them after. I am lazy and love the peel, so I mash the whole thing!  These are my sons Favorite, minus the skins:) Thank you CJ!

This is a great recipe that I use often but on special occasions I
use red potatoes and evaporated milk. This makes the taste distinctive and very yummy!

I know making mash potatoes should be basic 101, but I came across Chef John's video and I found out the easy little mistakes I made, thinking I had made great mash. Guess wrong. Chef John simple and easy to follow directions, made me, make the best mash my family has every had... at least that is what my wife said!!

These are better that 5 stars. indeed perfect potatoes! Check out his video for easy step by step instructions.  Also check out his other recipes and videos posted. I can't wait to cook more of his dishes.  Chef John should have his own show on the FoodNetwork.  Thanks Chef John for your awesome contribution to this site.

I was skeptical about using a whisk to produce perfect, fluffy mashed potatoes! I decided to re-enact Chef John's video for our dinner guests one night, not knowing what the outcome might be. These are, by far, the best ever! Fuffy, pure, perfect!

This is a perfect recipe.  I haven't made box mashed potatoes in forever.  I was wondering what to make for dinner tonight and had come across the video for this recipe a couple of days ago and was sooooo tired of eating jasmine rice with every meal, so this was a life saver.

This made just the right amount and everyone loved them.  I paired it the the homemade chicken gravy recipe and it was even better than KFC's!!!  :) Thanks

Loved the video and now I know how to make perfect mashed potatoes easily.  My mashed potatoes sometimes were runny or like glue but these turned out nice and fluffy.  Can't wait to try it again but will add sour cream.

I have always been scared of making real mashed potatoes. But this recipe makes it so easy! I make them exactly according to the recipe however, at the end I add about a half cup of sour cream and some extra milk. I like my mashed potatoes really creamy. The taste is fantastic. Finally, I can make mashed potatoes from scratch!

Wonderful (but don't forget the pat of butter and chives on top!) This will be my go-to method. Thanks Chef!

I love mashed potatoes but hate the thought of eating a ton of butter and cream which most recipes call for.  These really are perfect.  I make them all of the time now and always have leftovers in the fridge.  My husband makes a fantastic tangy 24 hour Greek yogurt that we stir into the potatoes after reheating which makes them even more creamy and delicious.

Chef John you rock! These potatoes are light and fluffy and paired with a roasted chicken and gravy. Love the video. I did add a couple of tablespoons of cream cheese and some sour cream. Kids licked the plate.

This is a really solid recipe, but not exotic in any way. If you are looking for an excellent recipe for basic mashed potatoes, this is it. Follow Chef John's video and you will be good to go. I ended up with slightly thinner mashed potatoes than I wanted. My wife said they were great and the taste was awesome, but next time I'll remember to add the milk slowly rather than all at once, so I get the consistency I want. Thanks, Chef John.

I have been doing this completely wrong for years and didn't realize how simple it could and should be. My mashed potatoes always come gluey or starchy or heavy. I was not only amazed at how fluffy these were (had to use a fork since I didn't have a masher but they came out great otherwise!) but also amazed that when I reheated them, they retained their fluffiness! That has never been the case in the past when I made mashed potatoes so it's something that boggled my mind haha. I will never try another method again aside from investing in a quality masher. Thanks for your many phenomenal recipe additions to the app Chef John! I seek them out and check them first when I see Chef John has added a recipe for something I'm searching for.

I’ve been making mashed potatoes for years the hard way. Dicing them is a waste of time and it cooks unevenly as Chef John pointed out. This is the simplest and best way.

I learned to cut my potatoes lengthwise.   Should always start the boil with cold water - after rinsing the raw, cut potatoes - I think that's important to get rid of a lot of initial starch.  These are good.  I like them.  My family prefers a dollop of mayonnaise and sour cream added as well (and a little onion powder and garlic powder), but this is a great recipe for basic mashed potatoes!

I consider myself a pretty good cook, but my mashed potatoes always turned out horrible!    Too soupy or too sticky.  Then I tried Chef John’s recipe.   My mashed potatoes turn out perfect every time now!    Thanks!

Eh these were ok, but we’ve made better mashed potatoes before.  Seemed to be lacking sour cream or maybe cream cheese or parmesan and could have done without the chives.

This technique and recipe is absolutely perfect! I am not a huge fan of mashed potatoes, but I like these. I now have mashed potato duty each Thanksgiving and the family of 10-15 scrapes the bowl clean (all 5LBS of potatoes worth).

this was really simple. I'm a broke cook so I had to improvise a little bit on the tools, but even with a hand whisker and a metal spatula it worked out well. I did leave the skins on and added some chives because I like that farmhouse flavor, but other than that when I took a tasting bite after I was done it was mommom giving me a hug. Amazing.

An excellent, easy side dish, especially for meal prepping. Definitely make sure to try poking the potatoes with a fork before mashing to make sure they are done enough to easily mash. I usually just go ahead and cook them longer. Margarine will result in a different (better?) flavor but not as good of texture.

Came out amazing, super simple recipe. I did use evaporated milk rather then whole milk and added some rosemary. Thank you, chef John!

LORD HAVE MERCY! I love mashed potatoes but have always been disappointed with so many homemade recipes that I’ve tasted over the years. I followed your recipe to the T, and added a little Rosemary to it. OH MY GOD, that was my first attempt to making mashed potatoes from real potatoes and it was just PERFECT!!!! Just the way I like it! Thank you so much!

after 61 one years I have found a GREAT recipe for mashed potatoes. I stopped making real mashed potatoes many, many years ago cuz they always came out much to thin. I guess I could have called them a potato  puree ;) any-who this will be my new staple go to recipe. Thank you Chef John for all your wonderful easy to follow videos I hope every one who is going to use your recipes use them so many wonderful tips.

Great tips to make it, but it lacked flavor.  Added some sour cream, and garlic salt which helped.  Guess its a nice base to make into whatever you want it to be!

This is our 3rd time making this.  My girls love making it with me and love eating it.  One loved it so much she asked “why do we have to make something else with the mashed potatoes?”  She wanted it to be the only  entrée! I never had anything so simple taste so good. Perfect video explaining the mashing process.

So quick and so easy. I made it as is the first time and added a cup of shredded cheddar the second time. Both were a hit and made just the right amount for 4 people- despite the fact that 2 of those are athletic boys!

Wow! This was such a simple recipe, but they turned out really good. I did not have russet potatoes so I used gold instead. I cooked the potatoes a bit longer, and did add a bit more butter, but that could be due to the different type of potato. I loved that they weren’t watered down potatoes either. I will be using the techniques in this recipe going forward.

Perfect!  I used red pot as that is what I had on hand.  I watched the video as others suggested and did exactly what Chef John instructed.  I used half /half that I had on hand and only used 1/4 cup as I like mashed pot a little thicker.  Next time I will add the entire amount just to see what happens.  They were delicious.  Will never use a mixer again.

Dwarf chef JOHN, please don’t take this the wrong or creepy. But you are the funniest chef and I enjoy all your YouTube videos.  I need a good laugh in my life.  My husband love MASH, this was /is the best.  Thank you for saving the day.  One more weird thing my favorite video is the green bean casserole, such clean and fun humor.

Great easy recipe. I left the skins on the potatoes while boiling them on because they come off easy after you remove them from the water. And I warmed the milk before adding them to the potatoes.

You would think mashed potatoes were as easy as boiling water, but it takes little tricks of the trade from someone like Chef John to perfect this comfort food.

I followed this recipe to the letter except I used half & half instead of whole milk. Lots of salt and pepper to taste, and these were the most DELICIOUS mashed potatoes I’ve had in a long while..... I usually douse my potatoes in butter on the plate, but these didn’t even need anything extra~ no gravy or butter, eating them plain was satisfying enough so that should say a lot!! Cutting them length-wise to cook was new for me but worked well. The finished product was light and fluffy and not glue-like at all which can sometimes happen to my potatoes.... thank you so much Chef John for a wonderfully simple yet delectable recipe!!

I made these with yellow potatoes for the family Christmas dinner and they turned out fabulous. It's hard to believe that I've been eating and making poorly prepared mashed potatoes for nearly half a century. Will always use these tips from now on!

My daughter LOVES this recipe and so does my family.  We've made it 4x now and after the 3rd time, she asked for it again for Christmas dinner.  She's a very picky eater at 16, so it's PERFECT for our family!!

This is the only way I make mashed potatoes! My daughter raves about them. You do need to season to taste and I highly suggest warming the milk first. Just a minute in the microwave (for the milk!) will do!

Loved this! I can't understand the reviewers who call it bland. It's basic, yes, but delicious! It's good on its own (we ate it as is and everyone liked it) but I can see it as a great canvas for bacon, cheese, roasted garlic, chopped green onions...

I used yellow potatoes and more chives but followed everything else and I'll have to say, "I made the best some pretty good taters".

You can learn simple but ultimate techniques. Because it is based on the basic taste, you can add your favorite  - such as Palmesan cheese.

Excellent recipe, Chef John! I love all of your recipes and videos. Thank you for the knowledge and skill you impart to all, beginners to experienced.  I have been cooking for 60 years and still enjoy learning new (to me) recipes and techniques  from you and AllRecipes.

I tried  this recipe for Thanksgiving 2 years ago. It is the only way I make them now, All 4 of my children love them and they say they're the best they've ever had  They won't even eat them out at restaurants and when I say I'm making them they dont care what else comes with it .

Followed recipe exactly and turned out perfect. First time making it and my entire family loved it. Tried it with red potatoes, but needed to add a little bit more milk. This will be my go to mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving.

Hey, I can make mashed potatoes now, yay! I only had medium russet potatoes on hand, so I used 4 and figured that would come out to about what this recipes calls for. I also only had 2% milk in the house, so I don't know if that affected the outcome. But I'm very pleased, these were simple to make and had a great end result!

I wanted to make simple fluffy mashed potatoes. The dish I would serve over it already had gravy so I didn’t need doctor’d up mashed potatoes. This recipe came through and was so simple to prepare. I followed the directions to a tee and had great mashed potatoes to serve with my other Chef John recipe, Chicken ala King. Try it!

Just awesome mashed tots.  So simple; so good.  This is your basic mashed potato recipe.  You can do whatever you want to them, for example, leave the skins on, add garlic, chives, etc.  Just please follow the technique because THAT's the trick to flawless mashed potatoes.  Thanks Chef John.

I love this guy. "And that, wha, what the hell is that?" So funny. I also love these mashed potatoes. Delish!! I so wish my mom was still with us. Her favorite food on the planet. She planned dinners around mashed potatoes. She would have been so proud to let me take over her mastery of mashed potatoes.

Fluffy and buttery. Without a doubt a solid five star. Don't skimp on the potato masher during the first break down of the spuds. I mangled my wisk in the process, worth it!

I had to write a review on this simple, yet amazing recipe! I have tried other mashed potatoes but this beats it all! I used half and half mixed in with 2% low fat milk instead and added a little bit more butter than the recipe says and it still turned out great. I’m looking forward to try other recipes from chef John!

Pretty straightforward and good. I used buttermilk because I had it on hand, and why not. My son loved these and so did I. This seems like a good baseline and I look forward to experimenting a bit with variations, but as is it’s really good.

I love the ratios in this recipe, as well as the techniques for boiling the potatoes. I don't have the masher Chef John specifies, so my mashing method is slightly different, but I am still very pleased with the outcomes each time.

Chef John is my go to guy! Apologies for taking so long to rate this awesome recipe. Hands down it’s the best mashed potato recipe ever. Fluffy and lump-free!!!  By far the easiest way to make mouth watering mashed potatoes, off course add salt and pepper to your liking. Thank you Chef John!

Huge winner in my home. 2 of 3 Kids finally like mashed potatoes!  I add a large dollop of sour cream and scale back the milk. Best mashed potatoes ever.

GOOD FLUFFY.   Right now I like these best. Followed 
recipe , added cream cheese. Could add just a touch for flavour, either, cayenne pepper,  paprika , or red pepper 
flakes.

Fantastic method to make the best potatoes, all the spices blended in perfectly and the butter made it smooth and creamy. The russet potatoes also gave it a classic white/gold colour. However, this recipe took an unexpectedly long amount of time to make. The russet potato was hard and took about 45-50 minutes to cook, and in the end we ended up beating it with an electric mixer to remove lumps. In conclusion, this is fantastic recipe and deserves all the rage, though not good if you need to make mashed potatoes in a hurry.

This recipe and video finally taught us how to make light and fluffy mashed potatoes. So for that, 4 stars. I took off 1 star because they are very plain. We like a bit more zip, whether that be some sour cream, cream cheese, or garlic mixed in (in fact, the second time we made them we threw in 4 garlic cloves to the boiling water and mashed them in with the potatoes, along with a good dollop of sour cream. Those potatoes turned out phenomenal).

Definitely used condensed milk instead of whole milk. Be sure to overcook the potatoes and mash it more than "two times around restrain yourself" if you want non-lumpy potatoes.

I made this the first time for our family's Thanksgiving dinner.  Nervous, my Mom has always made the mashed potatoes, I followed the recipe to the letter. 
They turned out so well I was asked to make them again for Christmas.
My Mom tends to try and make everything more healthy, using chicken broth for half of the butter.  My mashed potatoes were so much more flavorful and creamy.  I believe that you shouldn't skimp at the holidays, it's a time for celebrating most everything including food.
Happy Holidays!

O.k.  I made these as a side for Chef John's recipe for Simple Beef Pot Roast (which was an absolute hit for my hungry family)!  Who knew it wasn't just the ingredients but HOW you made the potatoes that mattered so much!  I know cooking with starches can be tricky but Chef John left nothing to chance. His video was precise, funny, and perfect!  I slightly undercooked the potatoes (my fault - I was impatient because the pot roast was ready and I was HANGRY).  But even so, they came out delicious.  I doubled the recipe and used 12 small russets instead of 6 large (like the ones he had in his video).  I mashed them and seasoned them exactly as he instructed but used half and half instead of whole milk.  Never making mashed potatoes the old way again!  Thank you, Chef John!  You've taught an old dog new tricks tonight and my family appreciates it!

These were my very favorite mashed potatoes. They were not super creamy but still had some texture that was just perfect. People were laughing at me at Thanksgiving for being the mashed potato dictator and watching like a hawk how my assistant was stirring, but it payed off as they were delicious.

His video tips were perfect. I would have never thought such suttle things would make such a difference. They are light and fluffy... perfect texture. I have already cut the potatoes before I watched the video but I think The Secret is in the matching. This would be the only way I make mashed potatoes from now on. Thanks chef John they really are perfect

Have made it twice for Thanksgiving and turned out great!   5 lbs. of potatoes is great for about 12 to 16 people. We served 16 people and there was one small bite left over!  Of course there were a Lot of other dishes. I would suggest halfing the recipe for a normal dinner. We loved it and loved having the potatoes ready and warm in the crock pot so you have one less thing to try and keep hot and serve at the same time!  Thank you so much for the recipe!

AWESOME!! WATCH THE VIDEO

I really can't believe how amazing these mashed potatoes are. But the key is you have to watch the video because he gives you tips that are full proof.  I made it with a 5 pound bag of russet potatoes and I used two sticks of butter and 2 cups of skim milk. I used black pepper because that's all I had and they were out of this world good.

Definite keeper. At first you look at the recipe and think why would I need a recipe for something so simple. It has since changed the way I prepare mashed potatoes. I prefer the skin on my mashed potatoes so I don’t even peel. I let the milk sit out at room temp while I boil the potatoes to help take the chill out. And I add a heaping scoop of minced garlic to make garlic mashed potatoes. I think definitely letting them sit in the hot pot on the stove helps and a measured amount of milk so they aren’t too runny. Also I notice red potatoes have a lot of starch so I prefer baking potatoes

I used Yukon Gold, diced into one inch cubes, and used half & half instead of milk. Added a tsp of garlic powder and topped with some fresh snipped chives. Sublime!

I will make it again and everyone loved it, but I think it was lacking a little bit in flavor...totally personal preference of course. I followed the directions as stated, but used 5 potatoes so i added a couple T of butter and a splash of milk. I also put a little sour cream. I would have liked some garlic, but like I said..everyone else loved it. Super fluffy! And easy!

Simple straightforward recipe. I doubled it because my family loves them some mashed potatoes! Very rich and buttery, doesn’t even need gravy!

I doubled the recipe, added little bit of garlic powder at the end. It was perfect! :D just like it said. Perfect for the potluck I'm gonna bring it to. Thanks for this simple recipe!

for the salt and pepper, looks like I added good enough for my taste.

These really are the best and so easy. I used season salt instead of regular salt and used a little more than what was called for.  The video was very helpful.  I learned that I was always over mashing/mixing.  This will now be the way I make my mash potatoes!

If you thought like me "Who doesn't know how to make mashed potatoes !" Believe me, you will lean a tip or two from this recipe, especially if you watch the video !
I followed closely, except by using the potato masher I have in the house, that is the one with holes. I will continue using that one though because it's made of hard plastic and that's better for my non stick sauce pans.
The result was very fluffy, melt in you mouth mashed potatoes.

Very good. I did follow another review and added 3 Tbsp of sour cream. I don't know if it made a difference or not. Next time I'll omit the sour cream and see.

They probably love this around the world. As do I :)
This recipe has the basics covered pretty well

three quick tips to be able to serve this recipe here (belgium)

1. Nutmeg! There's no way the dish comes on tables without it
2. add an egg yolk 
3.  warm your milk before adding it to your mashed potatoes

Try! 
Cheers,
T.

These are good. Pretty much your basic mashed potatoes recipe. Top with butter, gravy or your choice. I cook mine in the microwave though and "mash" in the food processor. Comes out the same but I can also add various ingredients like scallions, cheese, bacon, chipotles etc....

These are delicious though without a doubt.

Saying to add things "to taste" does not a recipe make. Every already knows they can add more or less according to their wishes. Also, I found the description of "three large" potatoes unhelpful as I had no idea as to what "large" was. Which may be why my resulting recipe turned out dry and I had to add more butter and milk. Won't be making again.

Excellent.  The texture, taste and appearance were near perfect.  I made it just as the recipe calls (except instead of whole milk, I used half-and-half milk).  Absolutely amazing.  You need to try this.  Follow the directions precisely and you'll have a perfect serving of mashed potatoes.

I love mashed potatoes doctored up with garlic, sour cream, & other additions, but, there is nothing like the classic mashed potatoes that I grew up with.  What makes these stand out is the cooking method.  Perfect every time!

Excellent mashed potatoes.  We warmed the milk and butter together in the microwave before we added it to the potatoes because mashed potatoes get cold so quickly.    Great taste and texture.

Perfect mashed potatoes! Reason I only gave it a 4 is because Way too much salt. I only added about 1/2 what it called for and  that was fine.

Love these mashed potatoes.  I have always used russets for mashing, but never knew to dry them in the pan.  This makes all the difference in consistency and taste.  Thanks Chef John!

Followed the recipe except instead of the potato masher, I used fork and the steel whip. Came out perfect! First time to make mashed potatoes and I'm so happy with the result!

My first attempt at mashed potatoes in a long time, and now I have a reason to make it more often. The recipe is really simple, the process is straight forward, and the end result had a simple taste that was great by itself, yet easily allows for additional flavoring.

I have a relative that has a dairy allergy, so I substituted Earth Balance Olive Oil spread for the butter and Silk Coconut Milk for the whole milk. Not bad at all if you are looking for a dairy free mashed potato recipe.

This is how my grandmother, mother & I did it before they invented electric hand mixers! Always works, but if you add minced onion right after draining, and then the milk (skip the butter) then whip with ele.mixer they come out awesome. Doesn't hurt to add some cream cheese (chive) too!!

OK,  I have not yet made them (from this recipe) but it is very similar to how I make mine but I'll have to dry splitting the large potatoes length-wise and, I bet, that w/improve them.  One thing I would suggest is briefly heating the milk...just to warm before adding.

Amazing! Finally a healthier recipe that does not require sour cream or/and cream cheese! Be sure to use a large pot, and eat it with some gravy on top! Thanks for this recipe Chef John! These make the PERFECT mashed potatoes!: )

Wow, this recipe turned out so well.  Light, fluffy, flavorful, and, best of all, quick and easy!  I am a novice in the kitchen and I watched Chef John's video and followed it to a 't' and ended up with the most wonderful mashed potatoes!  THANK YOU!

As a long time lover of homemade mashed potatoes, I was very pleased with this recipe.  I appreciate the simple ingredients and the suggestions on how to avoid gluey potatoes.  I usually heat my milk and butter prior to adding to the potatoes and I use white pepper with the salt to flavor it.  My children eat these potatoes until they are stuffed!

Having grown up on instant mashed potatoes, I had no idea how EASY making them from scratch could be. 

My 3 large russets were about 2.5 lbs to give you a reference point. Having said that, the ratios of milk and butter seemed to be right on point.

Take the time to watch the video so you get all of the tips. Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks? I didn't know that I've been making mashed potatoes the wrong way all of these years (using a mixer). This recipe is now my go to for mashed taters.

I use to  prepare  so many times mashed potatoes. I like this way to cut them  and I believe it 's the best!  Now, my way to spruce up the flavor of the mashed potateos:  add two or three peeled cloves of garlic  and a half or one if is not to big parlsey root when you boil the potatoes. Remove the parsley root before you start mashed them but don't worry about the garlic. Believe me , this is the best flavor ever!!!!!!

This is such an easy and useful recipe. I realized that I really did not know how to make mashed potatoes properly at all! Who knew that you could mess up such a simple side dish. With the techniques that Chef John shared, I was able to make the fluffiest and smoothest mashed potatoes of my life. I have never used so little butter nor milk but all those perfect proportions acheived that incredible melt in your mouth texture. Unfortunately I did not have the right masher and I had to mash the potatoes in a very atrocious manner. Rest assured Chef John, I will be getting one soon! Thank you for all your entertaining and educational videos!

Light and  fluffy  are  the best words to describe  these potatoes.  I added a couple tablespoons  of  sour cream  just to amp up the  flavor a bit. Thank you Chef John for sharing  the  proper  mashing technique. No more gluey potatoes!!!

Very good recipe.

We used Yukon Gold potatoes as they are our favorite and we added lots of fresh garlic during the mashing stage.

I will never make these any other way! The texture was perfect!!! I did make one single change, but it was only adding some roasted garlic because I love it.

Very good. I was afraid of making mashed potato, but this recipe gave the confidence. Like other reviewees I only had 2%, so added 3 tbs of sour cream and it made it flow and creamy with a dash of garlic powder. ..potato confident now....

Great basic recipe to.work with, had to make it low sodium, just gave one shake of the salt shaker instead of the recommended amount during the boiling. And had some small potatoes, cut them in half and quartered the large ones so they were more uniform in size. Also, added 1/2 cup of half and half  with the reduced fat milk I had on hand to give it some more cream. Wish I would have used all half and half, as it was still a little runny. It was fine once it cooled and especially when we had it for leftovers.  Thanks Chef John,  it was great!

Hands down the best recipe for fluffy, light, creamy mashed potatoes. Follow the recipe EXACTLY as it is written. It is all in the "technique" of cutting and cooking the potatoes. Make sure you also dry them like he suggests by putting them back over the stove for 30 seconds after they are drained. I also reallyyyy salted the water. The only minor change I made is I added a dash more of whole milk. Thank you for the easy and delicious recipe!

I've never found such a quick, simple recipe for homemade mashed potatoes. 

I adhered to all the instructions, but I used half-and-half instead of milk and added Jane's Mixed Up Crazy Seasoning along w/ salt and fresh, cracked pepper. 

My son groaned in ecstasy  as soon as he took a bite.  He absolutely loved this! I get a thrill when I hear moaning and groaning over my cooking. Thanks for making me look like a great cook!

This recipe is the best! The mashed potatoes came out so fluffy & delicious! I followed every step as stated & even went out to buy the potato smasher Chef John suggested to use.  The only thing, the potatoes tasted kind of bland so i tried adding a bit more salt & pepper to taste but still nothing & i didnt want to ruin the bland taste to too salty so i served em aside with meatloaf and salad and just sprinkled table salt while having dinner. The family loved it & i will now keep this recipe handy! Thanks Chef John!

You can't beat this recipe. It's a classic recipe! Simple to make, creamy, the leftovers (if there are any) are great for shepherds pie.

The mashed potatoes turned out great and since Mom and Sis took some home with their pork chop this recipe was a success! 
I followed the recipe as best I could. I only had a plastic  masher and it did the job alright this time.

This was my first time making mashed potatoes from something other than a box.  I'm no cook, and I never paid attention to the way mashed potatoes were supposed to be cooked. What a difference - I'll never do boxed again.

I've been making this mashed potatoes for years! The only difference is I dont add the salt and pepper in the water, I add it in the end when mashing the potatoes. I also dont use whole milk, I use 2%.

Perfect!  I was skeptical about cutting them into halves, not smaller pieces, but the outcome was perfect and even Hubby approved.  

I had to adjust the quantities for 8 people:  11 small-medium russets + 1 large russet, 1/2 C butter, 2/3 cup warmed 2% milk. 

I followed Chef John's method exactly as he demonstrates in the video.  Perfect, fluffy, mashed potatoes!

This is a simple recipe for great mashed potatoes.  We like buttery potatoes so we add enough to make them a little more yellowish.

First time using a recipe for mashed potatoes (have been cooking for 50 years). They were seasoned perfectly and so light and fluffy.  Used a crock pot on low and they stayed hot for four hours for thanksgiving dinner.  Love all Chef John's recipes and his sense of humor too.

Turned out really well! Didn't follow the recipe exactly though.  I used a pastry blender because I don't have a masher; the texture turned out perfect.  Used 6 potatoes, 1.5 sticks unsalted butter, and 1 cup half + half instead of milk.

I like others thought I knew how to make mashed potatoes from scratch. I'm so glad I came across this video. Thank you! The only thing I would suggest is that: It's called a potato not a potata! That drove me insane!!! ;)

Thanks ever so much for sharing this recipe! It was easy and quick , which I love. The way I was shown took way too long and came out awful when I made it, lol. I would definitely make these mashed potatoes again. Think I'll tweak  them just a bit however.

I used organic Yukon potatoes (as always) and kept the skins on. Cutting the potatoes in half lengthwise is really key in cooking these potatoes thoroughly.

Delicious, didn't have a potatoe masher so I just used a meat tenderizer hammer, still mashed well and I used Idaho instead of yukon. Whole family loved it and will definitely make again. Tastes great paired with chicken tenders.

Oh made these tonight. I watched the video and cut my potatoes length wise as shown in video, and I liked it, easier, and faster. This is how I shall be boiling my potatoes from now on. They were delicious. Thank you Chef John.

Priceless potato advice!! I will make again. I left the peel on, didn't have salt (used garlic salt in the water) and didn't even have a masher, just used a fork, and against all odds  they turned out really good. I added a little bit of sour cream.

Big fan!  The only real difference from what I've done before is drying out the potatoes in the pan before whipping them but that had a much bigger impact than I could have imagined.  Light and fluffy.  Fantastic consistency.

Good recipe. Mild in flavor so you can dress them up however you like. Will increase the recipe next time, though. This didn't make that much.

Perfect technique for perfect potatoes. I went crazy and used cream instead of milk.

Best mashed potatoes I've had. My husband loves them and he's picky. I just use a whisk instead of the potato masher and they still turned out great. I've even added a tiny bit of cream cheese at the end and they've turned out yummy that way too. Great even without gravy.

Chef John's recipes very rarely disappoint, and this mashed potatoes recipe is classic, delicious, and easy!  If you want garlic mashed potatoes, I just add them after they've been cooked and drained, and mash in a clove or 2 along with the spuds.  Thanks Chef John!

This is THE ONLY way to make mashed potatoes as far as I'm concerned! I've been making them for close to 15 years now and they were always good but then I found this and now they are amazing. Best advice is to watch the video. I don't know how or why any of those steps changed the outcome and I don't care because all I can say is that it does elevate your potatoes! This year I made them for my new fiance's family for Thanksgiving and kept getting asked for my recipe. Also my soon to be mother in law said that they were they best mashed potatoes she's ever had. That is saying a lot!! Only thing I do different is use garlic salt instead of regular salt, but we love garlic. And sometimes I use half heavy cream and half milk for extra richness. I also was asked to make "my potatoes" for a church gathering recently. I varied the servings and did it with 15 lbs of potatoes and it was still perfect! Watch the video and give it a try!

I love mashed potatoes but never get them the same twice in a row.  Well, I didn't, but now I do.  I think the key is to make sure there is no moisture left.  I never did that before.

NO SUBSTITUTIONS. Chef John really knows what he's doing! Careful, but easy-to-follow technique is finally leading me away from my dependency on flaked instant mash. Best I've ever made.

A homerun!  The video tips were outstanding.  This is basically my Mom's usual Thanksgiving recipe that I've used for years but understanding the techniques helped me realize why some years our potatoes were amazing and other years a little lumpy and average.  We've followed this 3 times now (including with Yukon Golds instead of russets) and each time delicious mashed potatoes and lots of compliments!

I tripled this recipe for our Thanksgiving dinner.  The potatoes came out PERFECT.  My husband was dubious that they would turn out without using our mixer to mash up the potatoes.  However, I followed Chef John's instructions exactly and we were not disappointed!  This will be our go-to recipe for mashed potatoes forevermore!

I quadrupled this for my family of 8 and followed the directions mostly to a T (instead of whole milk I used half light cream and half 1% milk) and it turned out amazing. So super easy and perfectly fluffy. This made it into my recipe box!

I substituted buttermilk since I had no whole milk on hand.  Also boiled the potatoes with skin on because the family likes the skin. Dee-licious, fluffy potatoes!!  Thank you Chef John!

I started making mashed potatoes like this when I was a kid back in the 50s!  It was the way my mother, my grandmother and my great grandmother had made them before me!  As to having watery mashed potatoes, drain them properly and it won't happen!  And bland?  Taste them and add more salt, pepper or butter as needed!  And smart cooks will save the potato water to use in their gravies as this is where all the vitamins and minerals are from the potatoes!

To add a little more flavor to the mashed potatoes, instead of plain salt to season while mashing, use seasoned salt!

This is a good basic mashed potatoes recipe. However, for proper mashed potatoes steaming instead of boiling is the way to go. It holds more flavor and your choice of the steaming solution can add even more.

I steamed for 25-30 minutes using a 50/50 cooking wine/water mixture and sprinkled salt and pepper on the potatoes. After mashing, without adding anything extra, they were flavorful enough.

To take it to the next level I used salt, evaporated milk, a little butter, 3 cheese blend, chopped garlic and sprinkled dill weed on top. Then threw it in a glass baking dish overnight.  The next day I baked it at 300 degrees for 20 minutes covered and 5 uncovered at 30 minutes. Just make sure you add enough milk to keep them moist before baking...awesome just awesome!

For a really creamy experience use frothed milk from your coffee machine - we use latte style milk from our Nespresso which results in velvety smooth mash!

I thought these were a good basic mashed potato. I had a bag of potatoes that had 5 russets in it. So, I did 50% more milk. However, I just kept the butter the same. I am glad I did, because it seemed like quite a bit a more butter, even, than I normally would use when adding it. They were still plenty buttery. I boiled my potatoes in a large wide 3" pot with a lid. I have never just cut a potato in half once and boiled. I actually think I like that method better. The potato really held together. Be careful when draining. I normally use a strainer and doing the from pot method I nearly gave myself steam burns on my hands and a free steam facial. I am not sure I recommend that method of draining. After reheating the potatoes to dry them some as suggested I had to do the mashing process in a large bowl. I unfortunately do not have a coated masher and did not want my non-stick pot getting scratched up. This recipe, overall, is a good guide for someone trying to learn to make a simple mashed potato.

This is the recipe I grew up with, traditionally made Irish mash. The step of returning the drained, boiled potatoes was what my Irish father called "flour-ing off"  the potatoes. The residual water is steamed away leaving the potato edges with a slight look of dry flour. The centers will still be moist and the butter and milk flavors will dominate and not be diluted by that water. One difference at our house: we prefer some lumps for texture and only used a large fork to "mash" the potatoes. Thanks again as always, Chef John, for improving American home cookery one dish at a time.

Loved these potatoes!  The simplest recipe but always great results.  I usually add some roasted minced garlic (I'll throw in a head of garlic to roast with whatever I"m cooking along with the potatoes) but that is the great thing about this recipe, it's easy and basic enough that you can add whatever you like.  I've made with both skim and 2% and would recommend the 2% if you have it.  One time I tried throwing in a couple of spoonfuls of cream cheese with the skim and it actually worked pretty well - but the 2% will give you better results.

These are certainly the perfect mashed potatoes. They're incredibly light and fluffy. Only changes I made was I used skim milk instead of whole because it was on hand, and I added a clove of finely chopped garlic.

I spray the inside of a baking dish with oil, add potatoes and top with bread crumbs with your favorite cheese for a nice casserole. This way you can easily prepare it in advance, or keep the potatoes warm in the oven while the rest of the meal is cooking

Thanks Chef John!  My family now loves my mashed tomatoes.  The salted water at lover temps is the key.  Sometimes , I had a couple of Ts of sour cream.

Thank you for the great tips! The potatoes turned out wonderful, but it was a little salty for us. Next time I think I will leave out or half the salt when boiling the potatoes.

Made these for Thanksgiving, I followed the proportions exactly however I used half and half and butter...used the Russet potatoes, forgot to mash them before the addition of milk and butter, but they came out great! Best mashed I have ever made...first time I used a recipe too, go figure ;)

I loved the simplicity of this recipe.  This was smooth and yummy!  My kids loved these mashed potatoes!  I also like that Chef John uses milk instead of cream in this recipe.  I made a beef stew and served it over these mashed potatoes....heavenly :)

Perfect mashed potatoes is right! I think the key to this recipe may be in using the potato masher instead of an electric mixer. I went out and bought a potato masher specifically for this recipe and it made a huge difference from my past experience when I used the electric mixer. The potatoes were so creamy. I made these the day before Thanksgiving and then put them in a crockpot on low the day of Thanksgiving (I was trying to do as much as I could ahead of time) these potatoes came out excellent!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Hey, I just made perfect mashed potatoes! ;-)  I have been making mashed potatoes for years with mixed results. I followed Chef John's directions and recipe exactly as demonstrated/written and I finally know how to make proper mashed potatoes. I really appreciate the tip about cutting the potatoes lengthwise. It did make a difference. Also, in my past attempts, I think I tended to over-mash them. His technique and timing was right on. Thank you Chef John!!!

These turned out perfect with very little effort. The video was helpful, I found I had previously been doing a few things wrong. I only had skim milk but it still turned out pretty good (I'm sure whole milk would be better though). I also add about 4 ounces (half a tub) of chive and onion cream cheese to make it a little creamier and add flavor. My picky husband loved these!

Flavor was ok. Was using hot turkey commercial sandwiches so didn't want to go crazy with too many flavor a. What I loved was the video instructing on the mashing. For years I used electric mixer. NEVER AGAIN! Turned out perfect. Can't wait to make again and flavor them up!

Delicious and perfect!  What was I thinking all those years using salted butter or margarine while unsalted butter was the secret ingredient all along.  I was also using the  wrong masher while the suggested one  was sitting right next to it!  Overmasher no more!  Your added tips in your videos are precious!

Perfect consistency! They were a little bland but that's the way hubby likes them. Personally I would spice them up with some garlic salt at least, but either way, these are great mashed potatoes. I only have 1% milk so I used a little less than noted in the recipe so they wouldn't turn out too watery.

Fantastic! Really delish. I've made it for my family and they absolutely love it! Just to make a suggestion, I added Oregano to it, just to give it a little more taste. But overall, it's out of this world. Thank you, Chef John.

Delicious! Oddly enough, I never made mashed potatoes before. This recipe was so easy to follow. I used a little bit less butter and 2% milk. Next time I'll try it with whole milk. It was great. Next time I'd love to add a bit of garlic or green onion and bacon. Great recipe!

I have made this simple recipe a few times and my family destroys it. I never have whole milk on hand so I mix fat free with half and half. I think the key to this is cooking it on a high light after you've drained the water. Let the heat evaporate any remaining water. Delicious!

I love the technique to this.  I was hesitant to double the potatoes, as i always have trouble mashing it, but it ended up being easy after all.  Of course, season/taste as you go....

My grandmother taught me how to make mashed potatoes, and she learned from her mother, who learned from her mother.. you get the point. My family has always cubed the potatoes, not halved them, but when i tried it your way, they mashed MUCH more evenly and I didn't have those un-catchable little chunks you can never mash. Thanks Chef John, but now I'm afraid for my life! My grandma is going to whoop me for not using her recipe!
Recipe was perfect, as is. Didn't tweak or alter a thing. Delicious. And nothing was left over, even though I doubled the recipe. Even my grandma had seconds of the potatoes. But she doesn't know it was her recipe, hahahaha.

The potatoes texture came out great but they were a little bland. It felt as if they were missing something but couldn't figure out what! Other than the bland taste, the potatoes came out great.

Just made this and even though I've made mashed in the past I kind of just forgot due to lack of practice.  With this quick recipe I was able to make... I do not even eat mashed potatoes... I cook strictly from how they should smell... I only had 2 potatoes, and I accidentally used the same ingredients for milk and butter... butter was okay, but I didn't want runny potatoes... so I had to scoop out some of the extra... luckily I was only feeding 2 people potatoes!  :)  Thank you John for this perfect recipe!

Wow, these really are perfect mashed potatoes!  Funny how I've always used these same ingredients, but with less than stellar results.  Such a simple method.  My potatoes turned out amazing, with no mealy mush in the pan.  So glad to have found this!!

Well, I've been making mashed potatoes for about 35 years and I have to say this is absolutely the best method for fluffy, flavorful mashed potatoes with the perfect consistency.  I only have non-stick cookware so I did have to use one of the "banned" mashers but I have to say, they were still perfect!  This is how I will make my mashed potatoes from now on.

Watched video before following his directions. The mashed potatoes were the perfect, fluffy consistency. I've served them just as the recipe suggests, but I've also amended them with blue cheese, cheddar cheese, white pepper, and garlic.  This recipe gives you a great foundation for a versatile side dish.

Absolutely delicious! These were the creamiest mashed potatos that I have ever made! I added some salt to the water and also added 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar cheese and 2 tbsp. bacon bits after mashing in the milk and butter. These potatos were fabulous! I highly recommend using this recipe for any occasion!

Hands down THE best (and easiest) mashed potatoes I've ever made in my life.  Follow the directions to a "T", and you'll agree that they are everything they're advertised to be.

Thanks for sharing, Chef John!
