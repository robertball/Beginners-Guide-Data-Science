Wow, this was the easiest mousse I've ever made.  Beware, as it is rich so portion sparingly. Mmmm!

I too used Kahlua, will try brandy next time *but* it's already perfect. I used 1/4 cup sugar to make it less sweet, and also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk. Don't know what some people are doing but mine set up perfectly!

Unfortunately when I made this mousse it would not set, and I found the brandy flavour to be too overpowering for my tastes.

I'm sorry, but I found this very rich & very sweet to eat- 1 or 2 bites was all I could handle.

Good and easy! I cut the sugar back to 1/4 c and made the batch without alcohol. I poured most of the mixture into the cups and returned a small amount of the mixture back to the blender and added Irish Baileys Creme. Yum!!!

Awesome quick dessert! I used a giant dark chocolate bar I had on hand and took the sugar down to just 1/4 cup. Also, I used Irish creme for the liqueur. Very tasty!

all I can say is WOW! I used Heavy whipping cream in place of the milk and added vanilla extract and Kahlua in place of the brandy. Those that are complaining about this being too rich and sweet I don't get! Chocolate Mousse is supposed to be rich and sweet! Wonderful topped with freshly whipped cream and sliced strawberries!

Very rich, good taste.  This recipe does not work with white chocolate, probably because of the different oil content in white, vs. dark chocolate.

I agree, not only was it sickeningly sweet, it did not set up. It had a horrible taste. A waste of food.

I would call this a chocolate paste rather then a mousse, but it is very tasty nonetheless. I made it with a stickblender and used crème de menthe instead of brandy and dark chocolate instead of semisweet. The result was a very lovely "after eight" dessert. 

First I blended the sugar with the crème de menthe and the eggs. After that I blended the chocolate in and the hot milk last. Gave it a few more pulses before pouring into the bowls. The dessert set up for me in about 1 to 2 hours in the fridge.

I think this recipe would also make a marvelous cake filling and icing. Will try that with a chocolate cake and cointreau instead of brandy.

Like others, the mousse never set up. I think the directions may be unclear, because the top layer was mousse-like but the rest was pure liquid. The taste was good though (with half the sugar and just a splash of brandy and vanilla) so I may try again and keep it mixing for much longer, until the consistency looks more foamy and less liquidy.

Used 2T rum extract instead of brandy, but it didn't set after hours in frig, so I moved it to the freezer where it mostly firmed up, except for a tiny bit in the middle that stayed runny. If you remove the brandy and don't sub another alcohol, cut back on the sugar. This is very rich, so portions would be enough at 1/4 C. I probably won't bother with this again, and will look for a more reliable recipe.

This was so tasty!  I cut sugar to 1/4 C.  In place of brandy, we used some starbucks liquor since that's all we had.  It was SOOOO good.

This is really a easy recipe, but very rich. You have to be sure the milk is quite hot. I use Kahlua instead of brandy.

This was really delicious and quite rich!  I made it just as directed, except I omitted the brandy.  Next time I think I will use some orange flavored liqueur.

I added everything as directed. I did not add alcohol. Let it chill for well over 2 hours and was still more soupy than mouse like. It was also very grainy... I own a professional blender.... perhaps the milk was not hot enough? overall poor recipe. Still soupy 2 days later...

I tried it with half chocolate chips, egg whites blended first,  and powdered sugar.  Trying to make it lighter.  very tastey though
