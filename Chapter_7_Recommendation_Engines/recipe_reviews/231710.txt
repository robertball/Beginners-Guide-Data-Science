Made this for Recipe Group...DELICIOUS! I used brown rice to make it a bit healthier. Great flavor! I did add a bit of salt per our tastes, and sprinkled the feta on top of each portion b/c my little guy doesn't care for it. We eat rice every week, so this was a nice change from the usual, and is definitely going into the rotation~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used red Quinoa instead of rice.  I used 3 cups of cooked Quinoa.  I skipped the feta because I added to much salt.  And I also added a few sun dried tomatoes.  This was fabulous!!!  I am adding this to the side dish repertoire.  It was so quick and easy and full of protein and fiber!!!  LOVE IT!!

This has become a weekly staple in my house. My family loves it. I do add a half a lemon to add a little tang.

Recipe Group 01/24/ 2015: This was a lovely, healthy, all-in-one side dish I served with baked salmon. The leftovers should make a nice light lunch, as well.  I followed the recipe as written except for the following changes which I don't believe significantly changed it: I used brown rice and added 1/4 tsp. of Greek herb mix since the feta I used was plain.  I will definitely make this again and will include sauteed onion or shallots and some oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes for extra flavour. Thanks Terry for sharing your recipe!

Absolutely loved this! We eat a lot of rice so this was a great departure from the norm.  I doubled the amount of rice and  added 1-2 T. of capers, but the rest was as directed.  Delicious!! Thx for sharing!

I added a bit of salt, extra olive oil, and some bell peppers and zucchini that I wanted to use up.  Super tasty recipe.  It would probably be excellent if you wanted to substitute the rice with quinoa or couscous; I'll think I'll try one of those options next time I make this dish.

I made this for recipe group 1/6/15. My only change was to use fresh kale instead of frozen spinach. I used about 2-3 oz, sauteed it lightly and set it aside to add when indicated. The texture of frozen spinach in this would be a big miss for us. We enjoyed it but next time I would cut the artichokes smaller. They stood out against the other ingredients in a way I didn't care for. Too big and very contrasted flavor compared to the rest.

I added a zucchini and yellow squash that I had on hand and didn't want to go bad. It was wonderful and went great with baked salmon.

Outstanding! Instead of rice I roasted mini potatoes then mixed in all the other sauteed ingredients. Yum!

Recipe Group Selection:  24, January 2015 ~ A different twist on Fried Rice. I made the rice in the morning and refrigerated it, all day.  I like the texture of fried rice using cold or frozen rice.  It doesn't get soft/mushy when using cold rice.  In place of the frozen spinach, I had fresh on-hand and I used it.  It does wilt very quickly once added to the pan.  The feta cheese was a really nice finish to the dish.  I enjoyed this more than my DH, but that is okay, as it reheated nicely for my lunch the following day. I enjoyed it as a side for dinner, but really enjoyed it for my lunch.  Not too heavy, just a nice light lunch. Thanks Terry Inskip for sharing your recipe.

Tried this recipe for dinner and it was great! However I did add red onions and scallions for ever flavor! I also used non-diary Parmesan cheese to make it a complete vegan dish!

Great recipe. As I was stir frying the rice and spinach I felt the proportions were off, so I added more rice, probably another 1 to 1 1/2 cups. That was the only change I made to the recipe as submitted. It was the perfect accompaniment to marinated, broiled chicken breasts. I will definitely make this again.

Great!  Even the kids liked it.  Ended up using the full can of artichoke hearts (not marinated) just so I didn't have to store the rest.  I did make with rice using broth instead of water.  Fast and easy.  Thanks

Awesome dish, I added an extra jar of artichoke hearts for flavor and a 12 cup feta cheese to balance it out.  My family adores it including my 22 year old son who doesn't like spinach or artichoke, who knew?!

Tasty dish and easy enough to throw together once your rice is cooked and spinach is thawed and drained. I added a few kalamata olives before serving. Next time I'll try adding a handful of chopped onion with the garlic. Healthy and colorful!

It was great. I left out the spinach because I think frozen spinach is gross. I doubled the artichokes, doubled the feta and added a little more Greek dressing just because. Good dish to bring to a party. It's pretty.
