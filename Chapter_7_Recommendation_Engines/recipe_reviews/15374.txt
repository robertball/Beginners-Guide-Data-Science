The pie was very good but since I've worked in kitchens all my life I knew that this recipe needed some tweaking. when making the meringue the recipe doesn't specifically tell you how many egg whites. and two will hardly do the job if you like meringue. If I am going to go through the trouble of making this masterpiece I want it to be spectacular. so I used 5 egg whites. if you've never made anything with stiff egg whites. whip them like crazy. make sure they are stiff peaks, you should be able to turn the bowl upside down with out them so much as moving. The meringue will fail if you do not get the whites whipped correct. I did not have a problem with the filling it was very good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the issue of the egg whites. that was quite confusing in the recipe especially if someone has never made anything like this. These are fun pies to make! good luck and good eating!

I made this pie tonight, I haven't tasted the finished product, however, the chocolate custard is very good. 

One BIG note, however, if you are trying to fill a 9" pie crust you MUST TRIPLE the recipe.  I wound up making 2 batches, one regular (which only filled about 1/2" of the bottom of the crust) and one double batch.  Tripled this recipe fills the pie to the edge of the crust.

I ended up having to triple this recipe to fill the pie crust.  I added extra egg whites because we like our meringue piled high.  The pie tasted good and I will make this again.  I gave it 3 stars only because I had made and poured the first batch before I realizes that I would need more filling.

The Meringue Recipe turns out runny, and is not user friendly to new cooks who do not realize that meringue should be beat with only the egg whites for a long while before adding the sugar.  However the recipe could be reformated to make a wonderful Chocolate Meringue Pie.

Maybe I made some huge mistake, but this recipe did not work for me at all.  The chocolate pudding filling never did become the consistancy of pudding.  I had to add lots more flour to get it thickened.    There was not enough filling for the crust so I added layers of banana to fill it up to the top.  I also doubled the meringue.  The pie tasted good, but by the time I was done altering the recipe, it was not the same recipe.  Maybe there is a mistake?  I'm usually good at following recipes, I don't know why this one flopped for me.

This is very good, just what I've been looking for. I usually make a cream pie so I'm used to a lot more filling and meringue. Next time I'll double the recipe which will take care of both problems for me. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe didn't work for me.  It didn't set up well and was sickningly sweet.  There wasn't enough merengue until I added 3 more egg white.  This one is not a keeper for us.

Super easy and a real crowd pleaser.  Non-baker-types are always soooo impressed with any type of meringue and just have no idea how long it takes!  I have a very small apt and can only cook 2 9" pies at a time in an oven and I easily made 10 of these babies in just over an hour and 20 mins.  Only thing I'd recommend is adding 50% more egg white for the meringue.  I didn't feel it had enough meringue!!!!  Other than that - spectacular!

This was a pretty good recipe, although I did change a few things at the advice of others on here. I doubled the recipe to make enough filling. Also, I was having trouble getting it to thicken up, so I added a little cornstarch (dissolved in water first), which did the trick.  If you double the recipe, you get 4 egg whites for the meringue, which is plenty.

This is the closest tasting recipe to my grandma's chocolate pie that I have found. A couple of small additions to the directions: Stir all your dry ingredients together very well. Add milk. Stir over medium heat until warm. Take a few spoons of the chocolate mixture and mix in with your egg yolks BEFORE adding to the rest of the chocolate mixture. It will help it blend better and reduce the risk of overcooking your eggs. This ingredient list does need to be at least doubled for a 9 inch pie crust, and with the additional egg whites you have the option for more meringue. It's simple, my five year old can make it, and everyone loves it!

Wonderful pie and I gave it 5 stars becuase all the other reviewers had success but must have done something wrong.  The meringue turned out great and the flavor is wonderful but my custard didn't set properly.  This is the first meringue pie recipe I've tried to make.  Any ideas or hints for the amatuer?

For my first chocolate pie (and first review) this was a great pie. I did also tweak the recipe. If you double the recipe it is to much for a 9" deep pie crust. You can do 1 1/2 times the recipe and it is perfect. Also, I agree that you need more egg whites.  5 was perfect.  Pie is delicious and recipe is easy.  Thanks everyone for the comments to help my first pie be a GREAT hit with my family!

I followed the recipe exactly and the filling was.not enough and did not form. The marangue was short a few egg whites and would have been short as well for a 9 inch pie. first I will find a functioning pudding recipe then attempt this again. epic fail!

Just made this for a pre-thanksgiving dinner.  The chocolate pie and the meringue was great.  I read what another reviewer wrote and used five eggs white for the meringue.  You have to do this because there is NO way only two would cover the entire pie top.  Also, I cooked the pie for 10 minutes let it cool then added the meringue and put it back in the oven until golden on top.  Don't know if this made a difference or not.  Just did what another reviewer suggested.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  Instant hit! My cousin demanded that I send her the recipe as soon as I got home!  A word of advice...don't triple the recipe on the first try.  I ended up with two pies and two trays of meringue cookies.  Also the meringue on the pie shrinks a bit, but still tastes amazing!

I've been looking for this recipe for a long time now. I loved it. I agree it's a little too sweet, next time I make it I will reduce the sugar as suggested. Very easy to follow.

Turned out pretty well. I had no problems with either the custard or meringue (be sure to chill the bowl and mixers and put the egg white back in the fridge after separating them until just when you need them). I also used WAAAAY more cocoa powder for the custard because I'm a chocoholic..I used about half a cup. Only thing...a little too sugary for me. I will surely make this again but with just a little bit less sugar in the custard. I also used a chocolate pie crust I made from scratch and not the one provided. Good recipe though.

This turned out well, except I personally would have preferred the taste of smooth rich chocolate opposed to the taste of the cocoa powder in this recipe. Despite that, this was a good dish. Although I decided to make my own Short pastry and made the pies into miniature individual sizes rather than one large pie. Turned out good. Thanks.

I loved this recipe. I did add more merigue then the recipe called for. Also if I make this recipe again I will prbably put it into a graham cracker crust instead of a regular pie crust. The filling was excellent!

The only thing I would change has already been noted by many other, to just add more egg whites. It is a wonderful and super simple recipe. Some said they had trouble thickening and I thought I was having the same problem, but as I was reading people's solutions I was stirring more slowly and that seemed to be the solution. It took about 20 minutes of stirring at a fairly normal speed and hen another 5-7 minutes of stirring slowly.

I have made this pie a few times over the past few months. I did change a bit.
I used
 3/4 cup of white sugar + 1/4 cup brown
3 TBSP of cocoa powder 
2 1/4 TBSP white lily flour 
1 1/4 cups milk
Pinch of salt 
5 yolks
1 TBSP butter
1/2 TBSP bourbon 
1/4 TBSP vanilla 
1/4 TBSP pure coffee extract 

And I use my tried and true meringue recipe

5 egg whites 
1/2 tsp cream of tartar
1/2 cup sugar 

This pie is one of the favorites in my household. I do find that the extra yolks add way more creaminess. And the addition of the  bourbon and coffee extract bring out a beautiful flavor in the custard. Plus, making it to these specs make just enough filling for the pie crust. The meringue is considered "high-hat", because it ends up being about 3 1/2 inches tall.

First time I made this last weekend and was very disappointed.  Didn't have enough filling and didn't set up like it should have.  However the flavor was great.  After reading other recipes, this is the only one that I found that didn't call for corn starch and cream of tartar.  I did increase the egg whites for the merange.

I was looking forward for trying this recipe for a party. It was my first time making meringue so I didn't know what to expect. I was skeptical at first,since i thought meringue had to be stiff, but I followed as the recipe said. It was soupy and not nearly enough to cover the whole pie, and after baking it didn't harden at all. It is in the fridge now so I am hoping it will set.

This is good and easy to make.  Very good chocolatey flavor.  It did take quite a while to get the filling to thicken up.  I ended up turning the heat up some.  I doubled the recipe and that was a good amount for one pie.

It was my second pie & my first batch of meringue ever but I anticipated that I would need to add to the recipe by a 1/2 as I usually do with cakes & pies. It was exactly what I was looking for. I luv all recipes for hobby cooking!

the meringue didn't work out so well but the chocolate pie itself was amazing, one of the best chocolate pies i've eve had. It was thick and very rich almost like fudge. I replaced the meringue with a whipped cream topping since mine fell after taking it out of the oven.

I make this recipe all the time...it's my favorite pie! The custard tastes darker at first than it really is. It gets much, much sweeter after it cools. Everyone who has tried it loves it. Highly recommended!

I failed horribly at the eggs and making them peak, needless to say I have a soupy layer of egg mush on my chocolate filling. Would having a mixer with whisk attachments help, or did i not do it long enough? It looked so easy online. Otherwise everything else was fine.

I just took the pie out of the fridge, this is an all together fail, I have chocolate, egg, soup.

I didnt have a clue what I was doing but did all the step and got the best pie ever. My husband and child ate all of it the first night no left overs in my house. I guess I will have to make two next time to get just one piece. Thanks for such a good recipe

I followed the recipe and didn't have a problem with the custered being runny.  It was super sweet, I plan on making it again with less sugar.

Disappointing results- proceed with caution. Do not use a pie pan larger than 8" or the pie will be really thin. I am not new to baking so the fact that the filling is runny and there it not near enough meringue is not due to inexperience. The recipe for Grandma's Cocoa Meringue Pie is much better and does not have to be multiplied and tweaked as this one does.

delicious but I needed a lot more filling.  Pie was very "short"!  Probably will double next time.  Used with "EASY PIE CRUST" recipe and it was really good.

Very good pie base, meringue I actually just did myself, meringue is really easy to make. However, the chocolate custard base in this pie is super easy to make(for intermediate bakers) and tastes great, I added a teaspoon more of sugar to make it less dark chocolate tasting. Also put chocolate curls on top of the pie to make it more aesthetically pleasing. yum

I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out really bad; it was way too runny.  The pudding did not thicken as much as it should have and the meringue shrunk.  I would not make this again, looking for a new recipe. It was like soup.

I dont know what I did wrong but followed recipe exactly and the "custard" never got pudding thick. I added cornstarch and it still did not ever get thick. I will never attempt this recipe again.

I too doubled the recipe. It certainly filled the pie crust and the meringue turned out good. It also was a little runny, but sliced fine after refridgerating it for a while. It's a  bit chocolatey rich, which is good if you like. I had yet to make a meringue pie and this was a simple to follow recipe.

I agree with the majority of the comments. The pie was runny and I had to make a double batch to fill the pie shell. It had a good taste but the chocolate filling was way too runny. I was disappointed with the results.

I made this pie as one of my desserts for Thanksgiving.  It looked beautiful.  The filling was perfect, The Meringue made up wonderfully and baked wonderfully.  I took it out of the fridge a couple of minutes before serving and when I cut into it....it was pure WATER!!!!!!  Nothing from this pie could be saved.  I have been cooking for 15+ years and this just suprised me.  
I would not make this again.  The filling was great reminded me of pudding.

This pie was not very good.  The chocolate did not set properly and there was not nearly enough filling at least for a deep dish pie crust.  If I were to make this again I would double the filling and cook for double the amount of time until it is extremely thick.
