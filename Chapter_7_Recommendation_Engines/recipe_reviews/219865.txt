Nice flavor. I made a tripled the recipe to feed 10 and I also seared the chicken then loaded seared chicken and all the veggies into a roaster pan baked for a little over an hour was much easier with feeding such a large crowd and I could do other preps while it was cooking and not watch it so close. Made enough for leftovers.

Very VERY good despite the fact that I did not have all of the ingredients on hand (missing cilantro chipotle peppers tomato). Have made it twice and will make it again and again. Next time might try using a spicier pepper than the poblano.

I have never had chicken chilaquiles before so I had no idea what to expect. I didn't have poblano peppers so I substituted serrano peppers. The dish wasn't spicy but we added hot sauce to spice it up. I have one question about the recipe. The directions didn't include any steps using the rest of the chopped onion the chopped tomato the sour cream or the lime juice. I mixed the onion tomato and lime juice together and put some on each plate. Was that what the recipe author intended? I put a glob of sour cream on each plate too. We liked it but I agree with others that it was a lot of steps.

This was tasty but a bit labor intensive. Also my corn tortillas kind of cooked up to mush not sure if this was what was supposed to happen or not I liked it but other in my family did not.

This recipe took me about 2 hours to make. I cooked the chicken by itself in salt pepper and cumin. It took the tortillas almost and hour to brown at 350. Maybe my dish wasn t big enough. I cooked the veggies as directed. I then add the chicken to it when it was down and used a hand processor when it was all together. After that I put it on top of the baked tortilla and added the cheese. It tastes so good!

I have had Chilaquiles my whole life. I gave it a 5 star rating because these are the best chilaquiles I've ever had. I think the most difficult part or making chilaquiles is making the salsa. the process given in this recipe is simplified and you get the same result.

EXCELLENT!!!! What a keeper!! The whole family loved it. I do feel that the serving sizes are off- I halved the recipe and wound up with 4-6 servings despite the entire recipe supposedly making 4 servings. I baked the half recipe in an 8x8 pan. I made a couple of minor changes- my husband is trying to stay relatively low-carb so I used low-carb flour tortillas in place of the corn ones. After blending the sauce was a bit mild so I added about 1/4 cup of salsa and a small sprinkle of onion garlic and chile powders- seriously just a little sprinkle of each to push the flavor over the top. I did steam the poblano per the recipe and it worked fine although I have always roasted them in the past. We will definitely be making this one again and again!
