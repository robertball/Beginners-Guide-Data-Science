Very bland and kind of dry. Great for picky kids, however.  Bad for gormet husbands.  Tisk, tisk.  Could be improved, I think by thickening sauce.  Perhaps a white sauce or soup (ie. mushroom--very midwestern!) instead of just milk.

I liked this recipe a lot! It's one of my favorites. I don't use kohlrabi but use chopped onions and celery instead. yum!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was rather bland. The veggies were the best part. I think with some tweaking it could be better. I think adding some thyme and basil to the pork chops when I brown them will help perk them up, and I'll use cream of something soup with the milk. I'd also like to try adding garlic and onions. Not a bad base recipe, I'll try it with modifications next time.

I followed this recipe to a T despite the reviews about blandness.  Although I love curries and other spicy foods sometimes something subtle is great.   This was one of those which had enough natural flavours to make it great.  I will definitely make it again.  It was the dish for Kohlabri!

This was very good.  I'd never had kohlrabi before and fully intend to use it again.  I added a little spice to it before putting it in the oven and it turned out superb.  The chops fell apart easily and the veggie blend (I added celery) was a great compliment.

Not a lot of flavor.  Will use more seasonings next time but we still enjoyed it.

I personally love this recipe.  I serve it with garlic bread and cream pie. Kids love porkchops. So if you don't like kohlrobi and sweet onions.

I was looking for something to do with the Kholrabi I grew (we usually eat it raw).  This recipe was excellent, the flavors of the ingredients just meld together for a great taste.  And I love putting together a meal in one dish and baking.  I'll grow mor kholrabi this year!
