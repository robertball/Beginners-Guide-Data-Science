This was a recipe I'd been trying to track down for awhile (so happy to find it) You MUST use raw beets or the cake turns into muck.  Excellent cake, very moist.  Goes great with coffee.  Served at a bridal shower and got rave reviews.

I found this cake to be very moist and tasty. My kids and husband all loved it. I have passed along this recipe to a few people and have good reviews as well.  I used a cream cheese icing instead of this one though and it's good with or without icing.

Sadly, I was dissapointed. The ingrediants did NOT flatter each other very well, and moisture was lacked in this crummy recipe!
