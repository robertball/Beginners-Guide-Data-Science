This was a tasty, colorful salad. Next time I will save more dressing to put on the salad. The chicken was delicious! Easy to put together.

I cooked the chicken in the crock pot instead - just dumped half the dressing/marinade in there with frozen chicken tenders.  The dressing wasn't as sweet as I was expecting it to be, but adding some sugar even after it was all made up did the trick.  Good recipe - wish the rest of my family liked cabbage as much as I do!

This was really tasty! I made this vegan by substituting the chicken with seitan and even tossed in some chopped up kale...so good!

This is the best Asian Chicken Salad recipie I have used.  I used to have one from a long time ago and lost it and this is the closest one.  The only thing I do different is that I don't marinade the chicken because it takes too long and I double the sauce and use two bags of shredded cabbage to make it easier.  Great recipie!!

This was delicious even before it was chilled. The only substitutions I made were chives and red onion (in place of the green onions). Absolutely fabulous - a perfect summer meal!

I can only rate the dressing, which was excellent.  Next time I will use just a tad less ginger. Otherwise it's nice and tangy.  I put it over some green lettuce with chicken (sauted w/ a little sesame oil and sesame seeds), I also added cashews and crunchy Asian noodles (the generic Chung King kind).  Delish!

yummy    I didn't use any chicken because I didn't have time to cook it that day but it was very good. I am sure it will be even better next time with chicken. I also added some uncooked ramen noodles for some crunch.

Just made this tonight and we loved it!  I added extra chicken and veggies to make it a substantial dinner and DH had 2 full servings!  I took another reviewer's idea and threw frozen chicken breasts into the crock pot on high w/1/2 the marinade. After 3 hours I pulled it out, diced it up, and tossed it back in for about 30 minutes to soak up all the juices. It was perfect! I did have to make a little extra sauce b/c of the extra ingredients added, but this was a great recipe!  It'll definitely go into our dinner rotation!

This is a simple, colorful recipe.  I took another reviewer's advice and doubled up on the dressing.  The chicken was wonderfully flavored and tender and I only marinated it for 90 minutes. I thought the coriander and ginger enhanced the flavors.  I doubled the recipe for a pot luck and added toasted sesame seeds.  Delicous!

We enjoyed this and I'll make it again.  However next time I may make it easier on myself and just cook the chicken on the stove without marinade.  There really wasn't enough left over to use as a dressing.  I used a packaged slaw blend.  The only change was that I forgot the garlic.

Turned out great.  Only substantive change was using using pre-cooked chicken breasts (from the refrigerated section of your grocery store).  I marinated the chicken in the dressing for about 30 minutes, before cutting it into thinner strips and adding it to the salad.   Good time saver and a terrific quick recipe.

Exactly what you want in an Asian Chicken Salad!  The dressing/marinade is so delicious!  However I think I may cut back on the ginger next time, it was a bit overwhelming.  Only change I made was omitting the green onions due to personal preference.  I also added chopped water chestnuts, crushed ramen noodles and sesame seeds.  So yummy and easy!

Really good! This recipe has great flavors. I just made two tiny changes to really knock it out of the park: I cooked the chicken in a covered dutch oven WITH all of the marinade (don't discard it) so that it retains all of that moisture. Then after  it's cooked and you shred it, put the shredded chicken back in the dutch oven with the juices and bake for another 15 minutes or so. This will ensure that the chicken is nice and moist and flavorful.  The shredded chicken really soaks up those juices. The second change I made was I toasted the almonds in a frying pan until they were a nice golden brown.  Delicious!

Overall a good recipe, but too much ginger. I added honey peanuts instead of almonds and dried cranberries to boost the flavor.

I used fresh ginger in the dressing and made extra so we had plenty for the salad. I also added rice noodles and some peanuts along with the almonds. This was a hit at our house!

Made as directed. and took to a "girls' " lunch.  The girls enjoyed it, but I found the dressing had something of an off taste, maybe the coriander or the prepared mustard?  Probably won't make again because of the problem with the dressing, but can't fault the overall recipe.  Thanks, emilyk, for the recipe.

This salad is quite tasty.  I left out the coriander, cut down the ginger by half (personal preference) and used powdered mustard, but it was still very good.  I rolled these up in flour tortillas for a meal.  My husband even liked this!  Next time I will double the dressing/marinade, as I felt it was a little dry.  Very good flavor though.

It was not what I expected. The dressing left something to be desired. The sesame oil came through very strong. If I make it again I will use less of it. Neither hubby nor I were impressed with it.

Used all green cabbage just sliced slivered very thin and added slivered green and yellow bell pepper. I found it easier to julienne the carrots rather than shredding. Used toasted almonds and topped with toasted sesame seeds and crumbled uncooked ramen noodles. This is a fabulous salad, the dressing really makes it! The second time I made the dressing I added one teaspoon of Garam Masala seasoning. Also great with grilled chicken seasoned with teriyaki marinade and just as good with lightly seasoned boiled chicken breast shredded on top when you don't have time for marinating and cooking.

This is delicious. I don't stock sesame oil in my pantry so I used peanut oil instead and the vegetable oil was omitted. The peanut oil was plenty. I also used fresh ginger that needed to be used up. Thank you for a very good recipe.

I just grilled the chicken then chunked it when done.  I imagine marinating it would have added more flavor, but I didn't have time.  It was still fabulous!  I went looking for a can of mandarin oranges to throw in, but couldn't find any in the cupboard.  Next time I will try that and maybe some toasted coconut.

I made the salad without the chicken as a side dish for an oriental meat dinner party and it was hit! I had to make more dressing next day to finish the salad and later meals but without green onions to preserve it. I vegan guest ate it over the rice because she liked it so much!

Very good and delicious however I thought the dressing would be too strong as sesame oil is very powerful and can overwhelm other flavors- same with the yellow mustard and ginger. I used half of what the recipe called for- 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, 1 teaspoon of mustard, and 1 tablespoon ginger. It turned out a lot better!. I also decreased the amount of cabbage and added romaine lettuce to it- very tasty! And the recipe calls for marinating the meat for 30 min- 1 hour but I did it for 5-6 hours and tasted great!

Easy and delicious. Next time I will use less ginger or real ginger. I found it too gritty.
