I thought this was pretty bland as written and could benefit from some acid. I didnâ€™t want to start adding a bunch of things, since that would ruin its simplicity. I gave half a fresh lime a good squeeze, and that brightened the flavor.  And I wouldn't skip the parsley, it adds color to the salad as well as flavor (which it needs). Although its eye appeal is pretty nice when initially made, it wilted quickly, darkened in color, and after chilling, ended up more like a relish than a salad.  If I were to make this again (doubtful), I would cut the olive oil back to 1 Tbsp (or less), and I would shred the radishes and refrigerate, if I want to prep early in the day. I would then mix up right before serving to preserve freshness and crunchiness, and boost the salad's presentation.
