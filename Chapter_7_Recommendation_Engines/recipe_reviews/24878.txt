This is a great weeknight recipe that we make at least twice a month!  Sometimes we use the Pillsbury pizza crust dough and other times, we make our own.  But either way, it is delicious. NOTE: The best way I've found to pre-cook the chicken is to place each breast in the center of a square piece of aluminum foil and sprinkle on both sides with salt (and pepper, if desired).  Fold up the sides of the foil to form a sealed packet.  Place the packets on a baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour.  The chicken will come out moist and delicious.  Simply cube the chicken and it is ready to add to your recipes  (chicken salad, chicken ala king, etc).

Many of the reviews seemed to take issue with the ingredient amounts so I used my cook's intuition and eye-balled everything.  I omitted the pepperocinis (better served on the side like Papa Johns), approx. doubled the chicken, kept the rest of the measurements approx. the same, and made TWO medium pizza crusts with the ingredients instead of just one.  The key to keeping the chicken moist and flavorful is mixing a few TBSP of BBQ sauce into the cubed chicken before topping the pizza.  Otherwise, the edges tend to dry out while cooking.  Also, slice the onions super thin so they will cook more quickly.  If you have the time, I would definitely recommend making Jay's signature pizza crust over using a store-bought kind -- it turned out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Homemade crust is surprisingly easy to make, tastes fresher, and saves a lot of money. This pizza tastes great (very close to CPK) but I gave 4 stars because of the modifications.  This recipe will probably taste great with some pineapples too (similar to Davd & Buster's BBQ hawaiian pizza that seems to have disappeared off the menu).

Good Recipe.  My boyfriend and I always eat the chicken barbeque pizza at California Pizza Kitchen, and this is very close.  I don't know about the peppers though.  I love them, but not on my pizza, I don't think that would taste right.  I also used 3 chicken breasts instead of 2.  And whoever suggested making pizza dough out of bisquick is wrong.  Bisquick doesn't make pizza dough.  Thanks for turning a perfectly good pizza into chicken and barbeque sauce on a biscuit.  I did it to try and save money like they did and it was not very good.  First of all, 1 1/2 cups of bisquick only made about enough "dough" to cover half on my pan.  Next time, I'll try using a real recipe for pizza dough.  Other than that, the pizza was great.

You're right when you say it tastes like the CPK pizza! Yummy!  I ommitted the pepperoncini peppers and substituted it with green bell pepper.  I also used a mix of mozzarella and monterey jack cheese.  Make sure you slice the onion and pepper thinly (it tastes best that way).  I just had regular bbq sauce, so I added a dash of hot sauce and boy, it gave it a kick.  Good stuff, will be making again.  Thanks.

This was really a quick and easy recipie and my husband loved it.  To make it a bit cheaper, we made a Bisquick pizza crust (1 1/2 cups Bisquick and 3/4 cup very hot water.  Mix into dough then spread on pizza stone/pan).  Just put the topping on the uncooked crust and bake it for 15 mintues.

I've been wanting to make this for a long time.  I mixed my BBQ sauce right with the shredded meat of 3 breasts before then spread it over the crust.....sprinkled it with a diced fresh jalapeno (didn't have pepponcini)and covered with mozzarella and cheddar (didn't have cilantro or red onion).  IT WAS GREAT!!! I can't wait to try it again WITH the red onion.  The hot pepper gave it just a bit of heat.  Went great with the chicken.

I made this exactly like the recipe says (except the peppers because I didn't have any) the first time and found the bbq sauce quite overpowering. since then, i add a few tablespoons of my favorite bbq sauce to prego spaghetti sauce, and spread that mixture over a boboli crust (i'm lazy!!!) and top with all of the toppings except the peppers (they are too expensive). when served with salad and a nice red wine, it makes for a very fun meal!

Used Bobolis in the small size to make individual pizzas. I cannot say enough good things about this recipe. I do think some of the measurements were off on the recipe and just eyeballed the amounts that I wanted on each one. Definitely use the pepperconi and red onion, it helps round out all the flavor of the pizza, otherwise you have come BBQ chicken on a crust. Also, used regular BBQ sauce but dashed on some Tabasco. Used a combination of mozzerella and mild chedder cheese. It looked so good even before I put it in the oven. Plan on making this again tomorrow night for friends. This recipe is terrific and I wouldn't say that if it truly weren't. Easy preparation also. I eat CPK BBQ pizza all the time and this is pretty much on it if not better.

I really like this recipe a lot and you can cater to your own taste. I used Stubb's spicy BBQ sauce. I marinated my chicken with a little mesquite sauce and seasoned with some salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic salt and red pepper flakes. I also put a couple tablespoons of the BBQ sauce in with the chicken while it was cooking on the skillet. I cut my chicken into cubes before cooking so it didn't take as long to cook on the skillet. I sauteed some white onion and green bellpepper with a little diced garlic (instead of using peppers and red onion). I also only used about 3/4 cup of sauce to spread on the crust. I sprinkled a little mozzarella cheese on top after I layered everyting else.

Who would have thought that chicken on a pizza could be this good!  My husband does NOT like new things.. picky picky.. but he offered to try it, because he didn't know what was beneath all that cheese!  Surprised? HE LOVED IT!  It's a new favourite!  Didn't use the pepper's they called for, but used roasted red peppers.. and Bullseye original BBQ sauce.  PERFECT!

Worst homemade pizza I've ever had.  I agree on the ingredients to go in it as I've made something similar.  The amount of ingredients stated for this made it taste like a pile of hot garbage.  I've made BBQ chicken pizza before and it is much easier to gauge how much you put in it by eye.  Good ingredients. Awful amounts.  Also I recommend 
buying dough from a pizza shop.  I make (great) homemade pizza frequently and this is by far the worst one I've had.  Gauge the ingredients by eye.

I make a pizza almost identical to this recipe in my own kitchen too and it's always a big hit! My recipe does not include peppercinis and I use a sweet sauce because I don't like spicey. I use a boboli pizza crust. Everything else in my recipe is the same as this one. It's quick, easy and tasty. 

I put the cilantro under the cheese to protect it from wilting. 

I jazz up the pizza a little by adding flavor to the chicken. I cook my chicken by brushing a piece of foil with BBQ sauce and adding salt and pepper to taste. Put chicken on top of foil and brush top side of chicken with BBQ sauce and add more salt and pepper. Fold up foil to make a sealed packet. Put packet on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 for 50-60 minutes.  Take chicken out of packet and let cool before shredding. Add several tablespoons of BBQ sauce to shredded chicken to coat chicken evenly.

I also broil the pizza for 3-4 minutes on low broil to give the chicken and onion a little extra crisp.

I made my own yeast pizza crust and then used my judgement as to how much of each topping to put on. I baked in a 450 oven until brown enough to suit me. I did use approx 1/4 cup pepperoncini peppers chopped finely. Left off the cilantro. Really good pizza if you use your own judgement with amounts of ingredients. I also cooked two chicken breast fillets in a little butter and seasoned with salt and pepper then cubed. Four stars as written because of excess in ingredients...five stars with these changes.

Use grilled chicken, cooked crumbled bacon, green onions, Sweet Baby Rays honey BBQ sauce, cheddar & Monterey Jack. Any pepper & the cilantro overpowers the rest of the ingredients. I drizzle mine thinly with ranch dressing. Great the way it is, this is just a preference & another option, ;)

Were the amounts on this recipe wrong??
It took less than 1 cup of sauce, way less cilantro, a teaspoon of peppers, a teaspoon of onion, and about 1 1/2 c. cheese.  How could anyone even eat this with the amounts that are listed??
I made this because it was rated 5 stars.  But I have to wonder what the right amounts were supposed to be.  This much stuff wouldn't even fit on a 12" pizza crust.

Excellent pizza! I used Sweet baby Ray's BBQ sauce, dried cilantro, smoked chicken leftover from another meal, and a five cheese italian blend instead of colbyjack cheese. I left off the peppers. I'm sure I didn't use a whole cup of sauce, I used a bottle with a squeeze top so I just squirted it on the crust, but it was maybe closer to a half cup worth. This got raves here and was the first pizza to go.

Leave off the peppers and use smoked gouda instead of colby.  Also if you want it really tender, use grilled boneless, skinless chicken thighs and shred them instead of cubing them. Then mix them together with the bbq sauce.  (Use a little less sauce to spread on the crust.  And GRILL the pizza on your grill...charcoal or gas...for the absolute BEST flavor. (You can go to the related article on Grilling Pizza on this site if you've never grilled a pizza...you don't know what you're missing!!!)

YUMMM!!!  This is so good but only if you're a fan of BBQ sauce.  I used way less cilantro and a little less chopped onion.  I also put on jalapeno peppers instead b/c that's what we had on hand.

I loved this recipe, although my kids didn't.  As mentioned before, make sure you love the flavor of the barbecue sauce you use.  The onions were a bit heavy, but that didn't stop me from eating the left-overs for breakfast the next day!  Yum!

This was amazing....used a Boboli crust, Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce (our fave), a container of Lloyds BBQ shredded chicken, red onion, green peppers sliced thin instead of the pepperoncini and the Colby/Jack cheeses.....just delicious, messy and and very easy. Made this on the grill. Thanks!

I could literally taste the cilantro from down the hallway in my apartment. The cilantro and onions were overwhelming and I didn't even use the full amounts. I just wasn't digging this, sorry.

This pizza was very blah. I followed recipe exactly. I made two different pizzas that night (good thing) and this one was a bust with everyone. :(

I subbed vegan "chicken" (Gardein) and vegan mozzarella for the meat and cheese.  I added carmelized onions and one roasted red pepper (diced) to mine. I used my favorite (Stubb's Spicy) BBQ sauce. This pizza turned out FANTASTIC!!!

This is scrumptious.  It would be so helpful if reviewers would not give recipes less than 5 stars based on their own modifications to the given recipe. Please rate the recipe based on the ingredients and directions given and then add your own comments. Allrecipes should state the rules for reviewing as such. Some people might pass up a really great recipe due to rating based on another's modification! Thanks, KIMIRAE for your contribution. I will add homemade crust is the best.

I've made this several times and my family always raves about it.  I left out the cilantro and pepperoncini since I don't always have those on hand but it makes a quick dinner that is very tasty.  Not having pre-baked crusts on hand either, I usually use the basic dough from this site's Focaccia Bread without the extra spices as it's quick and easy - another recipe that I always have staples on hand for - it only has to rise 20 minutes then I press the dough into the bottom of my deep dish pizza pan and pre-bake the crust while I'm putting together the sauce for this one.  Yum!

Great pizza, nice change from the usual toppings. I didn't have fresh cilantro so I used ground cilantro(Coriander)it added a nice flavor, I mixed it with the onions.We also added a handful of pineapple pieces to the toppings. Ate the pepperoncini peppers on the side,going to try Banana Pepper Rings next time, thanks for the great recipe  KIMIRAE

I've never had barbequed pizza before, and it was only at the suggestion of my husband that we make it. But I have to say this recipe was amazing. We followed it exactly and used the "Quick and Easy Pizza Crust" on the site. We also used Kraft Hickory BBQ sauce. I've never had pepperoncini peppers cooked on a pizza, but I will do it from now on, it was sooooo good. This pizza was to die for. Thank you so much for this recipe, it will become a regular in our house.

This was amazing. my husband loved it. We omitted the cilantro and pepperoncinis and added pineapple to it. We loved the sweet flavor of it with the KC Masterpiece hickory and brown sugar bbq sauce. It has been added to our recipe menu for future use. YUM!!

My husband says this is the best pizza I've ever made!  I only used 1 chicken breast (and it was plenty!).  I added 3 strips of cooked bacon (chopped up), and I carmelized the onions in a frying pan before adding them to the pizza.  Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle bbq sauce has just the right amount of heat.  I used a shredded 4 cheese Italian mix.  I buttered the whole crust, slathered in minced garlic, and baked for a few minutes before adding the toppings.  YUM!

Love it! I use two packs of generic pizza dough mix (for a slightly thicker crust, which I pre-bake a bit first), and two medium chicken breasts. Cook and dice the chicken & coat with BBQ sauce first before adding to the pizza. I omitted the peppers completely and use an Italian seasoning on it before baking instead of the cilantro, which I rarely have on hand. I eyeball all of the ingredients and it comes out delicious!

If your near a Trader Joe's, buy the pizza dough. Easy to make and super fresh. We bought garlic pizza dough.

i thought this was a great base recipe. ive never had the pepperoncinis on the pizza and i thought it could be good but my boyfriend said no! so next time i will try them on the side. i read most reviews and it said that a cup of sauce was too much, so i tried 3/4 C. and both me and my boyfriend thought it was too dry. i also thought 2 breasts was too much chicken. we are having it for dinner this week and i will try just 1 large chicken breast. i liked a little more cilantro. the best part of the pizza though was when i sliced the red onion VERY thing and let the ends get a little burned. it gave the pizza a great smokiness... wonderful! experiment and have fun with this one!!

Absolutely AWESOME pizza recipe. I hadn't ever tried a BBQ pizza..and my picky husband wrinkled his nose...but we were BOTH blown away! Delicious flavor combos, everything on the pizza adds something really nice and it all blends perfectly with a flavor and nice heat that dance on your tongue and leave you wishing you'd made two! Very good balance of flavors!

I used a 14-inch pre-baked pizza and the amount of sauce required seemed excessive. I think it would have been better with about 5-6oz of sauce. Also, I too reduced the amout of onion. One cup of chopped onion seemed like over kill. Overall the taste was good, but again way to saucy. When I took the pizza out of the oven the toppings started to slide all over because they were swimming in the sauce.

This is an excellent recipe.  BBQ chicken pizza was always a favorite of mine at one of our local pizza parlors.  Now that I know how easy it is to make I don't ever have to order out again.  I used a spicy bbq sauce and skipped the pepperoncinis (but had some on hand for my fiance who thought they were excellent).  After having this for dinner once, I made it again less than a week later.  Big hit with me and my man!  :-)

The only change I made was to add some fresh garlic and Italian seasoning.  I made it on my lunch break and left it for my husband's dinner.  He raved!  And when I got a piece of the leftovers I raved too!  Absolutely delicious and so easy!!

This actually went over better than I thought it would.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce (SO YUMMY), but skipped the brown sugar and molasses, as it would make it too sweet.  For people who are questioning 'half a bunch of Cilantro' about two tablespoons chopped seemed good.  I also added about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese to the top of everything; that with the Cilantro and Gouda were a perfect combination of flavor.

this was very good, I sauteed my chicken in bbq sauce like it said to in another recipe, and the ingredients listed were enough for me to make two pizzas, but the flavor was very good. I will definitely make this again, will less cilantro next time.

The pizza turned out very good, and that was even without the cilantro and peppers (my husband objected to both). Will definitely be making this again!

Great recipe! I sauteed some diced chicken with s&p, chili powder, and basil. I also sauteed my onions a little with garlic and bell pepper, just until a little tender. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce, and threw some green onions on top to use them up. Husband loved it!

I changed this up quite a bit.  I sliced green bell peppers and red onions and sauted them in olive oil, along with a can of sliced mushrooms.  I tore the chicken breasts up and warmed them along with the veggies.  I used 2 Bobili pizza crusts, added about half a bottle of BBQ sauce to each and topped them with the sauted veggies and chicken.  I sprinkled cilantro on top (no where NEAR 1/2 a cup) just some, and then topped it with shredded cheese.  Baked for ten minutes at 375 and it was very good!  I think the key to this is to use the ingredients you like in the quantities that you like.  Very versitile and yummy.

This was a very good recipe. I agree with some of the other reviews that a little less bbq sauce would be better. I used chopped red pepper instead of the peperoncini peppers and fresh chopped parsley instead of the cilantro.

This pizza is GOOD!!! I am pregnant and this totally fulfilled my craving for BBQ chicken pizza. I only used half the cilantro on the pizza, and it was still a little strong, but it was still good. Definately a keeper.

The only change I would make would be to pre-bake the crust before adding the toppings because it came very soggy.  But it was still delicious!

Delicious! I've made this several times, and you can adapt it however you like. I tend to use a lot more onion as we love it, but I stick to the amount of bbq sauce stated in the recipe as we don't find it over-powering. I cut the chicken into small pieces and boil it; it works well - nice and tender. Also, I make it with a pizza crust mix (I forget which brand) - I find the ready-made crusts dry and cardboard-y. Great recipe!

Good, but the barbecue sauce was overpowering and very messy. I added sliced mushrooms and used a Boboli crust and baked at 450 for about 10 min. Next time I will use less sauce and cilantro and add some sliced black olives.

Delicious pizza recipe.  Next time I would reduce the barbeque sauce to maybe 3/4 cup, it was a bit too gooey for my taste.

My famiily loves this recipe!  We did omit the peppers and added a can of drained pineapple tidbits to make a Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza.  The kids really go for the extra sweetness.

Recipe is good as a base recipe but I honestly didn’t pay much attention to the measurements, I just went my chefs intuition for it & it came out great. I made my own pizza dough & put some thyme & basil over it before i prebaked it for 10min. As for the bbq sauce I took normal original flavor bbq sauce & added a bit of wostershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, some green (jalapeño) tobassco sauce, & a dash of sugar, then heated it for 30sec in the microwave. For th chicken I boiled a chicken breast in some water with salt garlic & olive oil till is was cooked just enough to shred. Shredded the chicken & mixed it in with some of the bbq sauce. Next put the sauce on the pizza, then the chicken, then red onion slices, topped with mozzarella, then put chopped spinach and cilantro, topped with a bit more cheese and some fresh diced jalapeños. Came out really good!

This is a great recipe as it stands.  I BBQ the chicken breasts first. I already had a pound of frozen/refrigerated pizza dough, so I substituted that, divided it into 3 pizzas and BBQ them - see the pictures. By making three, I was able to not add items that others might not like. I also used sliced banana peppers because that is what I had and they worked fine. I followed the remainder of the ingredients, then I BBQ the pizzas and they came out wonderful.  I'm sure you could also BBQ using the pre-made pizza crusts and it would be good, too.

Very nice. I used up some leftover baked chicken and homemade bbq sauce from AR. I cooked the onions first for personal preference. What a good idea and nice change from a bbq chicken sandwich.  Thank you KimiRae!

Tried and loved it!  Used a little less BBQ sauce because the wife doesn't like a saucy pizza.  Also pre-baked the crust for about 8 minutes, brushed the crust with olive oil, and added fresh garlic.  It was an instant it.  Family can't get enough of this one.

I cut out the pepperoncinis and added seeded and diced tomatoes. It was a wonderful switch out! I also used mozzarella instead of monterey jack. Overall the pizza turned out very nicely. :)

Awesome recipe. I left off the peppers and added bacon. Used a thin pizza crust and cooked it for a few minutes on a baking stone before topping it. My husband loved it - only suggestion would be to water down the bbq sauce a little so it doesn't sweeten up as much!

This is a terrific, quick meal that my whole family really likes.  I add some BBQ sauce to the chicken while it is cooking to add a little flavor, as well as some garlic and spices to dress it up.  The amount of cilantro is a bit much, so I adjusted that, too.

After reading all the reviews I was a bit conflicted about how to proceed.  So, I reverted to the half and half approach.  On one half of the pizza, I followed the basic intent of the recipe.  I used shrimp instead of chicken, a substitution I often make.  And, I used a mix of colby and pepper jack for the cheese.  I also added a bit of freshly chopped garlic to the crust before adding the sauce.  The combination of flavors is excellent and for us the amounts are off.  I used only 1/2 cup sauce on the entire pizza and it was plenty - one cup would have been way too much for our tastes.  I also cut down on the amounts of all the other ingredients.  I guess I tend to take a 'less is more' approach to pizza toppings.  Adjusted for the half of the pizza, I used only 1/2 the amount of sauce and probably 1/3 the amount of the other ingredients listed in the recipe.  On the second half I subbed a mix of mozzarella and colby, and I left off the pepperocini and subbed carmelized onions for regular.  That half was also excellent - a far more mellow approach.  Of the two, we preferred the original combination of flavors designated in the recipe - just at much smaller amounts.  Flavor = 5 star, amounts = 3 star for an average of a 4.

This pizza is so easy to make. I had to make four of them for a group of 10 and everyone was raving about them. Only change was taking one of the reviewer advise and soaking the chicken in bbq sauce before putting on the crust. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious after I made a few tweaks! I used my own whole wheat pizza dough I made myself, and brushed the pan with olive oil, sprinkled with garlic salt and Italian seasonings. I really enjoy that flavor of Bull's Eye Original BBQ sauce and it doesn't have any high fructose corn syrup in it. The taste of the BBQ sauce really matters. I also sometimes use mozzarella cheese instead, and it is still wonderful! Great recipe, and I get a ton of compliments on how tasty it is!

Delicious and quick! Followed recipe, but used a store bought pizza blend (mozzarella, asiago, Parmesan, and smoked provolone) for the cheese.  Also followed other reviewers suggestion of baking the chicken to keep the juiciness and it worked!

I decided to make this recipe because I had lots of left over BBQ shredded chicken from sandwiches I made a few nights ago.  I threw this recipe together real fast, making the pizza dough in my bread maker.  This pizza was delicous!  It is super easy and fast to make for dinner.  If you like BBQ sauce, you will most definitely like this pizza!  In all honesty, I wasn't sure if I would like it, but it was delicous!!

This pizza was AMAZING!!! I used a mix of Jalepeno Jack and Habenero Jack cheese (from Trader Joes) and the pepperoncini pepper is a MUST!  It adds a little kick to the pizza.  So good!!

loved it ! it was easy and the results were famblouse. quite fast too . so it basically depends of ur bbq sauce taste it before using it if you can imagine your self eating on a pizza crust then do it . i added salt to taste, 2  tbs of Parmesan cheese to sauce and chucnks of fresh tomatoes without squeezing the juices out . a sprinkled origami on the cheese . finally mixed quarter of the sauce 's cup with the toppings before adding

We liked this pizza, but I think the crust is what was "off" for us.  Going to try it again with a different crust.  I used a BBQ from this site "Grandpa Crott's" on this and it gave it great flavor.

Absolutely delicious!  I, too, just eyeballed the ingredients.  I used homemade pizza dough from my breadmaker, canned chicken (because it was a lot quicker, and didn't taste any different), and added some water to the store-bought BBQ sauce to thin it out a little.  I also left off the pepperoncinis.  It was so yummy!  I've made it twice now, and will definitely make it again in the future!  So much cheaper than CPK!

delicious!  Loved the cilantro.  I used Tyson frozen grilled chicken strips.  I heated them in a pan with some BBQ sauce while I prepped the remaining ingredients.

Yum, 1 said better than the local  place, the other didn't agree. I liked it and it's all gone. I did leave out the cilantro because my husband doesn't like it.

A really easy and tasty recipe!  I left off the pepperoncini peppers (didn't have any) and cilantro (don't like it) and my boyfriend added crumbled bacon to his half.  It was a fun change-up to our usual at home pizza toppings.

For my personal taste, I think the 1 c. of barbecue sauce and 2 c. of cheese was too much.  However, I did like the addition of the pepperoncini peppers.  There is another bbq pizza recipe on here that I like better.  But this one is not bad, just needs tweaking.

This was AMAZING. I cut out the peppers and cilantro, and I added fresh garlic to the homemade crust (I used the pizza crust recipe from the Joy of Cooking). Definately a keeper!!!

this came out very well!! I only made a few changes. I didn't use the peppers, and instead of colby-monterey jack cheese I used a mixture of mozzarella and gouda. I cooked the chicken cubes in a mixture of olive oil, bbq sauce, and hot sauce. I also baked the crust for a few minutes before adding the toppings and baking again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good and easy recipe! I recommend using less sauces; however and perhaps just a regular BBQ sauce will do. My husband and I like spicy foods a lot, but I think the spicy BBQ sauce overpowered the other ingredients. Great weeknight recipe!

I have been making a version of this pizza for many years. My version is just a tad bit different. I grill the chicken, but leave it just a little bit under-done. I spread BBQ sauce on the chicken while grilling. I also use Boboli Bread crust which really compliments the flavors. I also carmelize the onions instead of adding them raw. I omit the peppers (not a fan of them) and use mozzerella cheese along with Colby-Jack.  Cilantro is the key to this pizza. The more the better!

I make something similar & we love it!!  Like some other readers, I too mix the chicken in a little bit of bbq sauce prior to putting it on the pizza.  You MUST use red onion as this caramelizes when the pizza cooks & makes it taste yummy!!  I just sprinkle slivers of the red onion all over.  I also add thinly sliced roma tomatoes to the top.  I have never used the peppers that this recipe calls for; instead I use thinly sliced fresh jalapeno peppers on the top.  Yummy!!

YUMMY! This definetly rivals my favorite bbq chicken pizza from my favorite deli. I did think it had too much onion and cilantro, so I will cut back on them slightly next time, but omg it was soooo good!

I thought this was really good, I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because I did change the recipe somewhat. I grilled the chicken and added bbq sauce at the end of grilling. I also used green peppers and grilled them along with the chicken to make them more tender. For the sauce on the pizza, I used a combo of bbq sauce, ranch dressing and wing sauce to tone down the sweetness. I used 2 pouches of pizza crust mix, topped it in following order...sauce combo,  cut up chicken (tossed in a bit more plain bbq sauce) cilantro, green peppers & green onions and cheese. Yum!

Pretty good! All the flavors worked very nicely together; I especially liked the cilantro. I added pineapple chunks to half of the pizza and that was a great addition. I definitely did not need a full cup of barbeque sauce. I used just enough to cover the crust in a thin layer and tossed the chicken in a little bit of it before topping the pizza. We're not big on store-bought pizza crusts, so I made our favorite one off of AR (Jay's Signature Pizza Crust). Delicious! Thanks :)

This is a 5 star recipe with some changes.  My husband doesn't like red onion so I used a bit of green.  Like other reviewers have said you need way less of some ingredients such as BBQ sauce and yellow peppers.  We added crispy bacon to the top and it was delicious!  I also used pillsbury pizza dough in the can and did not pre bake it before adding the toppings.  Turned out great!  Will for sure make this one again!

This was an amazing dish!  I was happy that the recipe was very easy to make.  My husband and mom loved this pizza.  My mom is a very picky eater so I know it was good!  My pizza actually looked like the picture posted.  I did not alter anything on the recipe either.  I will defintely be making this again.

GREAT GREAT GREAT!! I have been looking for a similar recipe to Macaroni Grill's BBQ Chicken pizza and this is pretty close. I did make some changes though: I didn't have any spicy bbq sauce, so I mixed 1/2 cup KC Masterpiece original sauce w/ 1 Tbl Franks hot sauce. I also seasoned the chicken w/ onion powder, salt, and pepper, then grilled it and diced it and mixed it with about 1 Tbl of regular sauce just to get it a little coated. I layered the pizza as such: sauce, cilantro (which I won't use next time-a little over-whelming) 1/3 of the onions, chicken, cheese, then the rest of the onions. I didn't use the peppers-I set those out if anyone wanted them after the pizza was cooked. This will definitely go on the regular menu!

This tastes just like the pizza I get from the local eatery except for the cilantro.  Sorry, but my family did not like the cilantro.  I made a second batch without it and enjoyed it so much more.

This was delicious!  I couldn't find pepperoncini peppers so I used a combination of green and yellow bell peppers.  And instead of Colby-Monterey cheese, I used a combination of Mozzarella and Cheddar.  It was very colorful, and was a satisfying meal.  I will make this again.

I love BBQ pizza, and I like all the ingredients in this recipe, but this recipe honestly didn’t cut it!  It’s definitely not a five star recipe.  The taste was off and I seriously would question the amount listed for each of the ingredients.

This was yummy, but I do not see how it can serve 8 people. I could have eaten 3 slices. I added mushrooms to my pizza which worked out fine. Next time I would put a thinner layer of BBQ sauce on as 1 cup was a little bit too much.

Great basic recipe- changes I made- added a few tsp hot sauce to the bbq, sauteed the chicken in a few tblsps of the bbq sauce to keep it moist.  added pineapples on the pizza to balance the spice.  Did not have red onion so I just sliced up yellow REAL thin so they would cook.  Also topped it off with a bit of oregano.  I did not have pepperocinni so I used some canned jalepenos I had on hand.  Delish!  Thanks!!

5 stars is not enough!!!  This recipe was so good.  My family loved it.  My picky children asked for more 3 times.  I used bobali pizza crust.  I kept the rest of the recipe pretty much the same.  We really liked the peppers.  All the ingredients together really made a special taste.  I love making these great recipes!!  Since it is a very untraditional pizza, could be served for company and they would be impressed with your gourmet pizza.  I also doubled it so there would be more leftovers.  Will DEFINITELY make again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a quick and easy meal!  I pre-made the chicken in the Ziploc zip and steam bags in the microwave and cut it up. I also caramelized the red onion (recipe on this site). My husband put the dough on the grill and cooked one side first, then flipped and we added all the toppings. He turned the grill on low to let the toppings warm and cheese melt. We felt like we were eating something from a restaurant.

Very good.  I used all of the ingredients but I did not follow the quantities (less of almost everything).  I just eyeballed how much looked good.  I finely chopped both onion and pepperoncinis and just sprinkled them over the pizza for a more even flavor.  But even with a much smaller qty. it had some kick.  Yummy!

Fantastic! Made a few changes, though. I had to use turkey breast--our grocery store didn't have any boneless skinless chicken (not sure how they managed that one). I also added about a teaspoon of chipotle pepper to the bbq sauce, a tablespoon of garlic powder and a tablespoon of honey (I used KC Masterpiece Original). And I used white onion because that's what I had. Make sure to use the cilantro, it makes such a difference! The husband LOVED it!

We love this pizza.  Definitely try it with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site.  I add pineapple and leave off the peppers and cilantro, and it's fabulous.  The flavor of the barbecue sauce is very important, so find a spicy one you love.

I made the recipe the first time as is and it was good.  With minor modifications it was even better.  I used a little less bbq sauce and less pepperoncini because they tended to overpower the pizza a bit.  I browned my chicken in olive oil and Mrs. Dash.  The best change was that I carmelized my onions in butter, a touch of balsamic vinegar, and a spoonful of brown sugar.  This was delicious!

This s a great recipe. I only changed 2 things. I used Trader Joes ready to bake pizza dough. The only other thing I did was add the cilanto and red onion after the pizza was comlete. Cilantro get wilted and bitter. Whe added after it is fresh and crisp!

Delicious idea Kimi!  I definitely prefer this to regular pizza unfortunately my family does not.  I made quite a few changes to suit my tastes.  I made my own pizza crust, used a mild barbecue sauce, used mozzarella cheese and added pineapple.  My husband thought it looked disgusting but it was wonderful!  I forgot about the red onion but will definitely add it next time.  Thanks for the pizza recipe!

Delicious with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust recipe on this site!  The only change I might make next time is to cut back on the pepperoncini peppers...they added a little too much heat for our tastes.

This was fantastic!  We made it for a pizza night with friends and everyone loved it.  I tried the trick of coating the chicken in the BBQ sauce before putting it on the pizza and it came out great.  We are putting this at the top of our list of pizza night favorites.

This recipe is great, but changed a few things.  First, I used Jay's signature pizza crust recipe. (on this site) For the chicken I pan seared the breasts in olive oil and lime juice until golden brown and then cut in bite-size pieces.  I also carmelized the onions until they were tender.  My husband requested gouda and mozzarella cheese and I topped that off with a little provolone.  It melts the best.  This pizza was excellent.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!!

I made this exactly per the recipe, and it was awesome! Very, very good pizza. We used KC Masterpiece spicy original for the sauce and cut up a precooked rotisserie chicken for ease. I used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust (perfect) from allrecipes.com. I would make no changes whatsoever - it was the best pizza I've ever made!

This is an excellent recipe.  I made one slight modification.  Instead of using the recommended chicken breast, I purchased a whole rotisserie chicken from my local supermarket.  After removing the skin, I chopped up the white meat and used that for the pizza.  The result was terrific. Also, if you decide to use a rotisserie chicken, don't forget to throw the leftover meat and bones into a pot of water to make a delicious chicken stock for soup.

I thought the recipe was OK but only if you use like less than half the cilantro, it was sooo overpowering. My husband didn't like it too much.
May try again with lots less cilantro.

This was great and so easy!  I used a Boboli crust and a bag of shredded four cheese blend to make this super fast.  Also, I used way less than 1 cup of BBQ sauce; it would have been WAY too overpowering.  Plus, I didn't use the cilantro on my side of the pizza, I hate that stuff!  All in all a delish recipe!

I don't think I've ever eaten a pizza I didn't like...until this one.  All I could taste was barbecue, which was not compatible with a pizza crust.  My husband, a fellow pizza lover, ate a couple of bites and gave up.

This was a nice combination. Make sure you use plenty of BBQ sauce as the base tends to soak it up and the flavour gets lost (I have learnt from my mistakes!).

This was very good - husband and all children loved it. I used a store-bought pizza crust, but I think I would do homemade or Pillsbury next time. I sprinkled the cilantro on top for a pretty presentation.

This recipe was tough to rate. There were several opinions from the family on this one. My oldest daughter LOVED it! My husband and youngest daughter didn't like it at all. They both said the BBQ sauce was way too overpowering (we used our very favorite, too). I didn't eat any but must say it smelled and looked wonderful. It was a very easy recipe to make. So, all in all, this was a good recipe but just not fitting for my whole family. Thanks anyway!

Very good.  Be sure to make sure the crust is pre-baked.  I made the mistake of not pre-baking it...and it was a bit soggy.  Good flavor though.

Maybe its the sauce I use, but this was too sweet.  I wish I could find something that wasn't so sweet.  I even added tomato sauce to my bbq sauce, maybe I'll try it again and add more...

First I have to sayI thought 1 cup is too much barbecue sauce , I used maybe 1/2 that. Super Good! I used a homemade boboli-type crust I had in the freezer, vidalia onions,green peppers, didnt use the cilantro and it was fabulous! My "I only like regular pizza" husband loved it!

Wow, I made this today, minus the peppers and it was excellent! It takes a little bit of effort to make this, but is well worth it. I used only half a cup of the onion, which was plenty for my tastes. I found that it needed to be baked longer than 15 min. I baked it for 20 minutes at 350 and then put it under the broiler for a few minutes to get the cheese crispy. Thanks for such an awesome recipe!

I'd give this a 4 1/2 if I could but as it is, I'll have to give it a 4. Used half a white onion instead of a red one, left off the peppers, used mozzarella cheese, and added sliced mushrooms--all on a Boboli crust. Very good, but not fantastic. Will probably make again.

I really liked this recipe.  I did fracture the recipe somewhat, though.  I added red peppers and mushrooms.  I also added lots of cilantro because that is why I love BBQ pizza so much.  It was even more delicious heated up the next day.

Very Good !!! A great way to use left over chicken breast. It was very easy to make, the only change I would make next time is use less bbq sauce.  It made  our crust a little soggy.  Oh and I omitted the onions.  We don't like them.

If you like Hawaiian pizza you'll love this. We left off the onions and cilantro and extra cheese was added, for our kids. We used a mild honey barbacue sauce. Pick a sauce that is right for you because it will have the most impact towards the pizza flavor. Two thumbs up!

I used my own favorite BBQ sauce, but this pizza turned out so good! I also made my own pizza dough, but I have used pre-baked pizza crusts before and they are very good as well.

Every one tops their pizzas different.  I used all the ingredients in this recipe, to my liking.   The very thinly sliced onion, pepperoncini's, cilantro and stubs spicy bbq sauce made this over the top!  Is now one of my favs!

We liked this pizza with few changes. I made  my own pizza crust and pre-baked it for 10 minutes at 400. 
I used green bell pepper for pepperoncini. I wanted the taste of chicken to be predominant so I used only half the amount of the vegetables.

This is a really great recipe how do I did a few different things. I bought go balls from the local pizza place here in my town. If you want deep this you really need to let it rise I use cast-iron skillets let the doughballs rise for about an hour. I used Monterey Jack cheese it does really well contrasting between the sweet barbecue sauce. I also use cast-iron skillets to cook them. Turned out delicious. I will be making this quite a bit there was no pizza left!!!!!

We love this! I've never added the pepperoncinis as my husband is not a fan. I just serve them on the side. I add thinly sliced green peppers, mushrooms, and spinach. This pizza is quick, easy, and leftovers are great!

I loved this! New favorite food. I left of the pepperoncini peppers though bc I'm not a fan of them. But terrific tasting, easy, and quick.

Quick and easy! I added some bell peppers and subbed mozzarella cheese instead of Monterrey (personal preference). Will definitely make again.

Easy peasy and yummy! I always like to rub a little olive olive oil on both sides of the pizza crust. Way better than CPK!  We GRILLED it!

Excellent base recipe, though I think the ingredient quantities are meant for 2 12" pizza crusts.  I cooked a couple of chicken breasts in the oven and then diced them and coated the diced chicken with bbq sauce (to keep the chicken from drying out).  I usually use Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle bbq sauce with this recipe, but I have also used regular bbq sauce mixed with a little bit of hot sauce.  Also, I think adding some smoked gouda cheese brings this recipe to the next level!  As most reviewers have said, leave the little peppers as a side.  Great recipe, thank you!

I literally made this pizza 2 days ago and omg it was amazing! It was my first time making a pizza too so I was worried but it came out perfect. I love it and will be making it at least once a month for my family because of my family's request for it.  I added sausage to mine and I didn't put the cilantro on it because the cilantro went bad in the refrigerator but next time I will might add cilantro if I remember because the pizza was so perfect that I kind of don't want to change it even though cilantro would be such a small adjustment.

We loved it, but I had to change several ingredients because of our tastes & what was in the pantry: No Cilantro- we don't like that stuff. I used VIdalia onions, plain ordinary barbecue sauce and no peppers, and I guess my eyeglasses were dirty so I saw pepperoni & I substituted diced sausage for that- The cheese was a combination of mozzarella, cheddar, and monterey jack with jalepenos. I sprinkled the chicken breasts with "Everglades" and something called "Mojave Fajita seasoning Red" before sauteeing in a non-stick pan covered with cook spray & a splash of Chicken broth. I had a Pillsbury crust in the fridge so I pre-cooked that according to directions and after browning the chicken I cooled it and diced to bite size. It was set aside and the sliced onions were sauteed in the same pan with a lil cook spray & chicken broth.Last I added the diced sausage. Finally, I piled the chopped chicken, onions, diced sausage, 3/4 cup o BBQ sauce & another splash of chicken broth back into the pan & stirred until the consistency of the whole thing looked "right".  I spooned that combo onto the pre baked "crust" and piled on all that delicious shredded cheese blend.  It ROCKED. It really hit the spot.The Fajita seasoning made up for the difference between spicy & "plain" BBQ sauce. I'm going to make it again -closer to the recipe (Still no Cilantro) .IT's a great addition to my recipe library! Thanks :-)

This was delicious and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the proportions are so off. I used two chicken breast fillets and I just cut them up, sprinkle them with season all and threw them in the skillet. I used about 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, half a small red onion, thinly sliced, 1 cup of the Colby jack cheese and about 1/2 cup Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. I only put banana peppers on my slice because my husband isn't a fan but this was fantastic! Super easy to make, it had wonderful flavor and I think it's just as good if not better than California Pizza Kitchen. I'm definitely making this again! I just wish I hadn't spent so much time messing with the amounts but now I know!

Great and easy! I poached and shredded my chicken mixing it with a small amount of BBQ before putting it on the pizza.  I also used the colby-jack on half and mozzarella on the other half.  I'm not sure which way was better.  I put the cilantro on after it came out of the oven so it was easy to control the quantity on a piece by piece basis.

Easy and great tasting.  Add a bit of crumbled bacon makes this even better. Pepperocini on pizza is my favorite.  I used Famous Dave's Texas Pit BBQ - it's a got a nice kick.

Great pizza!  I used a homemade crust and left out the peppers (because I don't care for them).  I took one reviewer's suggestion to mix a little hot sauce into regular BBQ sauce.  Excellent!  I'll definitely be making this pizza again (and again and again)!

AMAZING!  I boiled 2 chicken breasts with garlic cloves, salt, and water and then chopped it before I put it on top of the pizza.  I can't believe how good this was because I normally don't like BBQ Chicken Pizza.  I made this on a week night and will be making it again soon!

I loved this recipe. It was so much fun to make and the smell was so good. I would suggest to use a thicker BBQ sauce if you could. My favorite BBQ sauce wasn't thick and it just didn't hold together like a thicker sauce would do. But anyways great!

Good, simple recipe. I had to make a few modifications -- used a little dried cilantro and some fresh parsley, used some unidentified peppers instead of the pepperoncini peppers, and sauteed the onions up before I put them on the pizza.

Delicious. Added some pineapple and used Jay's signature pizza crust as recommended by another reviewer.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious! Loved the cilantro.  I made with a yellow onion instead of red (personal preference) and Pizza Dough I from this site with rosemary added to the crust.  So good!

This is wonderful! I did not measure BBQ sauce...just spread about the amount of pizza sauce I would normally use on the crust. I used cooked rotisseree chicken from the store, cubed it and tossed with a bit more BBQ sauce. Used red bell peppers instead of pepperoncini. I tasted just like a BBQ chicken calzone, only much quicker to make. I used Jay's pizza crust (from this site) and made it in the bread maker. Delicious!

We enjoyed this pizza, but I don't think we will make this often. I used KC Masterpeice sweet and tangy, and boy did it make my lips tingle! I also had to use dried cilantro, as my store did not have any fresh today. I would like to try it with the fresh cilantro. This is a great "different" dinner!

I made this for my fiance last night. I pretty much kept to the recipe except I used 3 chicken breasts instead of 2 (just because that's what came in the package), and I halved the onion because 1 cup seemed excessive. I also reserved some of the BBQ sauce to mix with the chicken before putting it on the pizza, as some reviewers suggested. The pizza was loaded, but my fiance insisted that it was not too much, but just right. He kept going back for more, and asked several times to make sure that I saved this recipe and will make it again. Considering there was only 1 piece leftover, it's a definite keeper. Very yummy!

Great recipe! I used store bought dough (will try with my own dough recipe next time) and it was still delish!  We added red peppers and green peppers to the toppings, and used regular Mozza cheese. It was still awesome!

This was really good! I made my own crust (Garlic Lover's Crust from this site). I used 2 chicken breasts and sauteed them in olive oil, then chopped them up. I used Head Country BBQ sauce, and skipped the cilantro and red onion, using minced onion in place. I mixed the chicken with a little BBQ sauce before adding it to the pizza to keep it from drying out in the oven.

I made this for me and my boyfriend with  gluten free pizza crusts (homemade)and rice cheese (we have food sensitivities). I also added grilled zucchini to the mix because I love it. Although I'm sure it did not taste entirely the same, it was still delicious.   Thanks.

Fabulous!  When I baked the chicken, I used Italian seasoning and seasoning salt to give it some flavor.  I spread some PC Gourmet bbq sauce on the crust, sprinkled with cut-up chicken, some crushed pineapple, and mozza cheese.  My husband and I love this recipe - will definitely make over and over again.

So, so good!  I followed the suggestion to coat the chicken cubes in BBQ sauce before topping, and my chicken was moist.  Used KC Masterpiece brown sugar BBQ sauce.

Yummy!  This is a pretty simple recipe.  I left the peperoncinis on the side since my boyfriend doesn't like them.  A real crowd pleaser; all of the guys devoured it.

Exellent flavor! I loved the cilantro on a pizza. Adding the peppers (I added only 3/4 cup)and onions are a must. I used a pillsbury dough (from the can) and we grilled the chicken. I mixed a bit of BBQ sauce with the chicken before topping the crust as another reviewer stated so that it wouldn't dry out. I also added another cup of cheese.

I made this with Pillsbury pizza dough....it turned out very good. I'm not a huge BBQ fan...just my personal taste.  So otherwise based on the rave reviews I got from three grown men who devoured this!!! The comments were "this is the best stuff ever"  "what's this recipe called again?"  "this isn't like anything   i've ever ate before!!"  Yeah they loved it!!!  This was gone in a flash...served with a salad.  Any easy meal!!!

Okay, this was not even close to what I was expecting.  My pizza crust must have been too small, because there was WAY too much bbq on the pizza to even enjoy it.  Too much work to be so dissapointing.  My husband ate one piece and said he was done.  :-( just not good.

I liked this recipe! I was missing a few ingredients (cilantro, peppercinos) but it still came out pretty good. Needs a "kick" of something, next I will add the hot sauce suggested by others.

Awesome! I didn't use the pepperoncini since I didn't have any, but used green bell pepper.  I cooked the chicken with some mexican-spice rub in a skillet.  I also didn't have any spicy BBQ, but mixed my 'regular-flavor' with some wing sauce.  I used a pita-pocket for my crust and it was perfect!

Delicious.  This is much better than the frozen kind, and much cheaper.  I coated the chicken with BBQ sauce before putting it on the pizza, which added to the BBQ taste.

It was okay.  Using chicken breasts made it a little dry.  I would use boneless, skinless thighs next time.  I've had better.  The crust I used didn't help it any.

Good, quick and easy recipe and great for chicken leftovers. I think I'll use mild pepper rings next time, though. All those pepperoncini peppers were a little tooooooo hot for me.

Quick, easy, and tastey! I omitted the cilantro and used white onion as I did not have a red onion on hand. I sauted the cubed chicken in bbq sauce as other have suggested. I used a Boboli premade crust and will probably try a different brand next time. My boyfriend said it was the best pizza he'd ever had! Great recipe!

Great recipe.  Very similar to the California Pizza Kitchen pizza by the same name.  Loved it!  Served at a recent Christmas Party as an appetizer. GREAT!

I didn't use cilantro and i didn't use the banana peppers. I really liked the pizza tho and it was like the kind you get at restaurant. I liked it with the whole wheat/wheat germ pizza dough recipe on this website.

Fantastic recipe & sooo easy, especially if you use pillsbury pizza crust & leftover shredded rotisserie chicken!! Yum Yum.  I even left off the pepperoncini & cilantro (my daughter doesn't like them) but I bet they make it even tastier!!  Thanks for an awesome recipe.

ehhhhh. For one, it calls for too much red onion. I used about a half of one, and it was too much, it adds good flavor, but you'll start to find yourself picking them off when you're half way through. And it really doesn't like BBQ chicken. It is a bit festive looking, I'll give it that(I had had oragne bananananana peppers(banana peppers are the same as pepperonchini peppers)). Picky eaters will probably cover they mouths and hide behind the couch, but I'd say cook it once, but proceed with caution.

I made this for dinner tonight.  I used Bullseye Raging Buffalo flavor BBQ sauce.  I was nice and spicy, but I think the sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste.
I think that this recipe would make a great appetizer.  I would cut the slices much smaller and serve it that way, instead of as a main course.

My husband really liked this. I thought it was okay. That is why I gave it four stars. Plus, I did use suggestions from the reviews. I sauteed diced chicken with salt, pepper, chili powder, and basil. I sauteed the onions and green pepper with garlic powder until a little tender. I also used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce. I think I will try a different BBQ sauce next time.

Spicey and fabulous!  Served it at a beer tasting party and it was gone before I even got a piece.  I had to make a second one just to try it.  Make sure you use good BBQ sauce, that's the secret.

Very good. It was a little on the "barbequey" side, but overall the taste was great. Next time, I'll lay off the sauce a bit. I did coat the chicken lightly with the BBQ sauce (I used a honey variety with about a tbsp. of chili powder to spice it up) and the chicken was nice and juicy, even after bacon. I also put the chicken, red onion and cilantro under the cheese layer, which definitely kept the cilantro from withering. Also added a couple cloves of garlic - rarely cook anything without it. Very good!

This is such a great way to use up leftover chicken. I don't care for pre-made pizza crust so I used Pillsbury in the tube can. Added seasonings but no cilantro as none of us care for it. Used whatever cheese I had on hand, which in this case was Harvarti. Delicious Kimi and thanks!

i always make my own crust, so i used one from the freezer and prebaked it a little.  i cook boneless chicken in bbq sauce and it gives the chicken just the right flavor.  lots of other folks thought this recipe too sweet, you can serve sour cream on the side and it cuts the sweetness.  i also mix cheddar with mozzerella.  very enjoyable.

Had a really cilantro-y flavor (even though I only used half the recipe called for), ended up throwing it away. My husband said it tasted like soap. I haven't made it again but if I do it would be to eliminate the cilantro all together or maybe sprinkle some on individual slices right before serving.

This was a pretty good pizza.  I used green onions instead of red onions and used regular barbecue sauce.  I used a Boboli for the crust.

This was very good but I wonder if this recipe was for 2 crusts?  Outside of the chicken, the rest of the ingredients seemed like way too much, particularly the bbq sauce and the cilantro.  I used about 2/3 or so of a cup of bbq sauce and it was swimming in it and way too overwhelming.  Same with the cilantro.  I used probably 1/4 cup and it was still quite strong.  I probably only used 1/3 - 1/2 of the pepperoncinis and onions and only needed about a cup or so of the cheese.  All in all, a very good pizza, I would just cut way back on all ingredients except the chicken.

Rave reviews for this pizza. Per previous reviews, I used exact ingredients but eyeballed the measurements.  My husband nearly ate the whole pizza.

I was hoping this would hit the spot - and it did! AMAZING I will try this next time with less pepperoncini peppers.

My 14 yr old son made this for us for dinner.  It was easy to make and very good.  We didn't use the total amounts of the ingredients because it seemed like too much.  Also since we live at higher altitude, it took longer than 15 min. to cook; we cooked it 20 min. at 375.  Definitely use spicy bbq sauce--if you use normal, the overall taste will be too sweet.

This was a great recipe, although I left off the peppers and sauteed the diced chix breast in minced garlic, using just a little olive oil to coat the pan. No need to do what I did.... I just had too much time on my hands last nite!! Thanks for the recipe Kimi.

As hubby was eating the leftovers the next day he said, "This pizza ROCKS!" 
I mixed 2 Tbs pizza sauce from a jar with the Bullseye BBQ sauce and a dash of our favorite green hot sauce.  I think that gave the sauce more depth. 

Then I layered on in order after the sauce: Mozzarella Cheese, Chicken, Red Onion, Mushrooms, Red Bell Pepper, cilantro leaves and a sprinkling of grated five cheeses from a package.

All this was done on a prebaked frozen pizza dough.  Delicious!

I baked this with a low fat pizza crust and used reduced fat colby-jack cheese.  This pizza was FULL of flavor!

This pizza was delicious.. by far my favorite pizza yet.
To cut down on prep time, I used a thin Bobili crust and used
a honey jalepeno rotisserie chicken

I thought this was wonderful.  I used a Boboli crust, regular BBQ sauce, and added some diced bell pepper.  I liked the pepperoncini, but my husband didn't, so next time it'll only be on half.  I bought a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store to make this easier.  It was very good.

My husabnd and I thought this was a very good pizza recipe.  The only thing I did differently was use more cilantro and serve the pepperoncinis on the side rather than on the pizza itself.  I also made the thai chicken pizza from this website.

I used a bread maker to make the pizza dough and did prebake it. Used Kraft Original BBQ sauce with enough Chipotle hot sauce to make it spicy.  Mixed about 12c. of sauce with the chicken before applying to crust--really brings out the flavor without overpowering.  Didn't use peperoncinni but did use fresh red bell pepper, chopped small, instead. Makes a beautiful pizza and very tastey!

This recipe is really good, although I would advise against too much BBQ sauce and cilantro, both can overpower other flavors.  I added jalapenos and mushrooms to mine and it tasted great.

I made this pizza using the Jay's Pizza Crust recipe found here and we loved it!  I made the Buffalo Chicken Pizza and this.  I couldn't imagine using as much cilantro or red onion as the ingredients call for.  Our alterations made for a really delicious meal.  Thanks!

This was so simple and good! i can't say enough about it. It was quick and filling. I used the store bought  premade pizza crust , mixed the bbq sauce and the pizza sauce that came with the crust. I was scared that the bbq sauce along would be too strong. But this is an easy recipe! delicious!!!

Delicious, quick and easy! I used Stubb's BBQ sauce & Quick and Easy Pizza Crust (also from this site) ... I did layer it opposite of what it said but I think I'll do it the way it says next time with the cheese on top of the toppings - I can see how it would make it even better. I did leave out the peppers due to personal preference, still fabulous!!

oh so good!  i did not have peppers so they were excluded.  i did add smoked gouda cheese and mozerral cheese instead of colby cheese.  this pizza is so good, i cannot get enough.  i used jay's dough recipe to make the crust.  might want to add seasonings (basil and GARLIC) to make it more interesting.

My family loved this pizza. My daughter liked it but I think my husband and I enjoyed it more. We left off the peppers and instead of a store bought crust I made my own crust. We will definitely have this again. AWESOME

This was absolutely delicious!  Everyone who's tried it has loved it.  I only used about 3/4 C. of bbq sauce.  I left out the onions and pepperoncinis and added red peppers and feta cheese.  I made the pizza dough in my bread machine, and man was it good!

I found a sweet barbeque sauce (honey/brown sugar)and prepared this dish with grilled chicken breast. I left off the peppers, and it came out EXACTLY like the signature pizza of California Pizza Kitchen! My family was in heaven! The recipe was just the right size for a family of 5.
