This has become one of our favorite recipes.  I use a crock pot so I only use about half of the sauce while cooking and use the other half as garnish when serving. I omit the cloves and add 10 to 12 drops of hot sauce, and I also use whole cranberry sauce rather than the jellied.

I too did this a little differently.  I read that someone else had soaked the roast in brine first so I did that too (1 quart water, 1/4 table salt, 1/4 brown sugar, and some rosemary for a 1.5 lb roast).  Instead of cranberry sauce I used some cranberry/orange relish that was leftover from Christmas.  I combined the relish with the juice, sugar, mustard, and cloves.  I roasted the meat for about 2 hours and then served it right from the oven (I omitted the cornstarch and water at the end of the recipe).  The result was the juciest roast I've ever made with a delicious cramberry crust on top that tasted sweet and delicious.  The roast had a slight rosemary flavor and was nicely complimented by the cranberry.  This was such a hit that even my picky little 4 year-old ate it!  I'm sure the original recipe that is posted is yummy, but the way I made it was so good I'll have to do it again this way next time.

Made this for a dinner party last night.  Used a 4-1/2 lb. loin pork roast without the bone.  For a party of six we just made it with only one slice of meat leftover.  The cranberry glaze did wonderful things to the roast.  Very flavorful.  I added additional cranberry juice to the pan half way through roasting.

I made this for 50 people at our church. It got rave reviews. I used 3 whole boneless pork loins. The only thing I changed was to brine the roasts in salt, brown sugar, garlic and rosemary for 3 hours and I also added rosemary to the cranberry glaze. I will definately use this recipe again.

This was fabulous! I made one change as I forgot to buy cranberry juice, so used fresh orange juice instead.  Everyone raved about how tender the pork was.  Thanks.

Cooked in a roaster oven for just under 6 hours and had a wonderfully tender roast, but almost no flavor to the roast and the sauce is sooooo boring!  We tried to figure out what to add, but it's not good enough to even bother with.

I have used this recipe for years now it's so good everytime. But I use the crockpot for this,
everything the same except halve the ingredients
and use a 2 lb rolled pork loin roast.

Tried this recipe for Christmas dinner.  The roast was very tender and the glaze on it was delicious.  However I did not add any liquid to the pan while roasting and the glaze burned in the pan and I was not able to make the gravy to go over the pork.  I was a little disappointed and luckily had some chicken stock on hand and made some gravy with that for the mashed potatoes that went with our meal.  Everyone loved the roast and said it had good flavor and I agree.  The meat as I said was so tender.  I will try again and add water to the pan next time so I can make the gravy next time.

Absolutely fantastic!!! I followed the advice of others and brined the meat for 3 hours before putting it in the slow cooker.  Once the meat was done, I skimmed the fat off of the juices and made extra glaze from the remaining broth. I served it for Christmas dinner and got rave reviews.

I made this for christmas eve with my parents.  It was the best pork roast we ever had! The cranberry sauce makes the roast very tender.  Halfway through cooking I added 2 cans of sauerkraut around the roast.

I've made this recipe 3 times now, twice in the oven and once in the slow cooker. I have to say I like the oven method better because the roast & sauce both were  more flavorful. My husband and 2 teenage sons love this roast and have me make it with garlic baby potatoes, green beans & french bread on the side. YUM.

Every Christmas my brother demands I make this recipe.  The only change is I use a fresh ham since I have so many mouths to feed.  I throw the ham in before I go to bed on Christmas Eve and voila!  It is all set for us to eat on Christmas Day!

Yum!  I made this for my Dad staff Christmas dinner for 20 and it was a hit.  I doubled the recipe and used whole cranberry sauce instead of Jelled.  The smell was wonderful and the taste was even better.  I cooked it at 275 for about 5-6 hours and then turned it back until about 30 min. before the party. I took the pork out and then thickened the sauce while keeping the pork warm in the oven. I made two 5 lb roast (precut) and there was only two pieces left!

This recipe was just okay.  I was unsure whether to put it in the oven covered or uncovered, so I opted for loosely covered.  I cooked for 6 hours, and the meat was not tender, but rather a bit tough to cut.  As for the flavor, well, the meat was rather bland and the sauce was too sweet.  Our family ate it, but I do not think I will make this one again.

Used homemade cranberry sauce--make sure to cover with foil; not in recipe directions. At first I didn't cover it; the sauce started drying out so I added some more cranberry juice and stirred up the thickened sauce--covered the roast and it was really good. I think I could have done without the added sweeter, kind of sweet to me.

Very good.  Makes a lot of sauce mixture.  Save it for dipping when you serve it.  The add to shopping list options puts in pork chops instead of a roast.  I bought a roast and cut it into chops

I use one 16 oz. can of cranberry sauce for 2.5-3 lbs. of pork roast.  I put it in a slow cooker/crockpot and it's awesome.  It makes a wonderful juice that you can make a gravy with.  It also is great the next day if you pull it apart and make pulled pork sandwiches.

The great thing about this site is that most recipes are a great starting point. This for example, had reviews that used a brine so that's what I did,  I had a 9 pound pork roast, brined for about 3 hours, rinsed well, and then covered with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I then topped with sliced onions And scratch made cranberry sauce on top. More onions in the pan with some beef stock. Covered with foil and baked 30 minutes at 450, and then at 325 until it hit 150 degrees inside. I made gravy that needed no seasoning. This came out super tender, juicy, and amazing.

Just not a fan.  There are so many good pork roast recipes that this one just won't make the cut.  I prefer something that uses herbs and makes a nice crust on the meat.   I am also not a fan of recipes that add sugar (adding sugar takes something healthy and makes it unhealthy) but I thought I'd give this one a go.  Just not for us.  I can see how some might like it though.

I had the butcher slice my pork loin for me & made this recipe in a slow cooker at the same temp, however, it only took 3 1/2 hours! I did add some extra cranberry juice for moisture as it was drying out some at the end. It tasted fabulous! Especially with the heart healthy rice mix we made. We poured broth from the slow cooker on all instead of turning the broth into a paste. Mmm delicious! The next day it was even better!

I love cranberries, so I was excited to see this recipe. As usual, I read the reviews and took some into consideration, making only minor changes to accommodate what I had on hand.  I gave this recipe 3 stars because, while it works,  it needs seasoning... And I can't believe I didn't consider seasoning the pork with salt and pepper before adding the sauce ingredients.  How I made it: I halved the recipe for 2 people with leftovers; used about 2.5lbs of pork tenderloins and whole berry cranberry sauce (which I mashed with the back of a spoon instead of a potato masher - it's not necessary) b/c I already had these 2 ingredients. Instead of buying a big container of cranberry juice, I followed another suggestion of using OJ instead (Simply Orange brand). And, cranberry/orange go together like salt and pepper. I baked at 275F for about an hour and 40 minutes, but I was also having trouble with both my meat thermometers (instant read and leave-in), so I can't really say how long it would have normally taken to cook pork tenderloins to the ideal temp. Because of my thermometer problems, I ended up overcooking my meat - and that has ZERO to do with my rating. I don't rate recipes on my errors/problems, just on the base recipe and flavor outcome. The only other, and real significant change I made was not using sugar (b/c I thought it would be cloyingly sweet with as much called for in the recipe), and I used about a tablespoon of pure maple syrup instead. With that, I thought it had

This recipe is a keeper for sure.  I did my roast in the crock pot and added 1/2 of the garnish at the beginning and the rest about an hour before serving.  Turned out great.... Everyone wanted more of the Cranberry garnish...

Even slow cooked pork chops on top of the stove in the same way and they were great!

This is a great dish! Very good. I used 1 can jellied cranberry sauce and 1 can with whole berries . I didn't have any cranberry juice on hand but it was still delicious without it. Will make this many more times in the future. Yum!

I just made this tonight for my family and we LOVED IT!! I  did make a couple of changes: I was short on time so instead of cooking the roast whole, i sliced it into chops (this was a boneless roast). I made the cranberry sauce according to the recipe but instead of adding it before cooking, I cooked the chops for about 20-25 minutes at 385 degrees, then I added the sauce over each chop and continued cooking another 15 minutes. Then on the gravy, I used all of the juices from the pan and also added 2 ladles of the cranberry suace and wisked it into the pan drippings. I used flour instead of corn starch to thicken (thats all I had on hand). I served it with stuffing and it was very "Thanksgiving like" on a typical Sunday night. My family went back for 2nds on the chops and raved about it being an amazing meal! Thank you!
