The parm on our dish burned a bit, so I think I should have covered after 10 mins in the oven.  We didn't have creme fraiche on hand, so I substitued 1 1/3 cups of sour cream, 1/3 cup of plain yogurt, 1/3 cup whipping cream and 2 T of brown sugar and healthy dash of salt (another cooking site recipe).  We doubled the curry, and it was just delicious!

Great "Company" recipe. Our dinner guests were very impressed and my husband asked if we could have this dish be our new "holiday dinner" recipe.

My husband loves this recipe....Creme Fraiche can be quite expensive, so we have substituted sour cream or Loblaw's Double Thick cream, and added a few extra capers because I love them so much!!! Guests love it when we have it!

I had a little bit of phyllo dough, fresh cherries and left over Thanksgiving turkey to get rid of and came across this recipe.  When I told my husband what I was making he gave me more than one disgusted look.  We both ended up loving this.  Besides the turkey for chicken, the only other change was the amount of phyllo dough.  I only had enough to put about 4 to 5 layers on top and bottom, but again, I thought it was great.  Will definitely make again.
