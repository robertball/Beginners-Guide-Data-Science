Thick, dense loaf!  I used honey instead of brown sugar, and used 1/2 water and 1/2 soy milk for the liquid, while omitting the dry cow's milk.  Because of using only whole wheat flour, I didn't even use as much flour as the recipe calls for.  Great taste!

I made it but I don't own a bread machine. That isn't real bread. The taste was fine. But I will have to tweak it.
Recipe should have alternate baking instructions.
