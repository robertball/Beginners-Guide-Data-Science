I followed this recipe exactly, except I baked these at 450 degrees for 10 minutes instead of frying, and skipped the freezing part.  I have also halved the cheese and doubled the spinach on some batches to make them a little healthier. Very good this way too. At others' suggestion, I served this with "Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce" from this site. These were excellent and healthier than the original recipe. Very yummy!! Next time, I plan to add avocado to the rolls right before rolling. I think they'll be even better. :)

Great recipe.  Family acutally preferred the tortilla vs egg roll wrappers.  If you want to serve the sauce a chain made famous for these egg rolls, mix: 1/4 cup smashed, fresh avocado (about half of an avocado), 1/4 cup mayonnaise, 1/4 cup sour cream, 1 tbs buttermilk, 1 1/2 tsp white vinegar, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp dried parsley, 1/8 tsp onion powder, dash dried dill weed, dash garlic powder, dash pepper.  Let the flavors set up overnight prior to serving as it makes the sauce so much better.  Enjoy!

Sweet fancy Moses these are yummy!  I tripled the ingredients and placed the filling in egg roll wrappers and ended up with about 2 dozen rolls.  I baked them and served them with another reviewer's tip on a dipping sauce-the sour cream and salsa mixture.  These were incredible!  I plan on making more this week and freezing them. One note about freezing these-par bake them prior to popping them in the freezer so the egg roll wrapper doesn't break down.  I can't wait to make (and eat!) these again.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Trust me on this -- make this recipe using eggroll wrappers instead of tortillas, roll them up eggroll style and fry them -- no need to freeze them.   They are de-lish!!   I usually leave out the spinach to make them like a nearby restaurant does.  Yummy!!!

Wonderful recipe! I left out the spinach,since no one in the family likes it. We're cutting back on fat, so I baked them in the oven at 475 degrees for 15 minutes.They got crispy just like in a deep fat fryer. Served them with sour cream and guacamole! Thanks for sharing, Jackie!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and I was extremely pleased with the results. I did, however, modify the recipe slightly. I sauteed the chicken breast with a little salt, pepper and garlic powder. I also used canned chopped green chiles instead of red bell pepper, cilantro instead of parsley and I added a couple squirts of lime juice to the filling toward the final stage of cooking. I used creamed spinach and doubled the amount. I decided to bake them at 425 for 15 minutes (sprayed with cooking spray) and they were crispy and delicious. I served them with cilantro cream sauce from this site. I will definitely make these again and again!

Wow! This is a great recipe that I fix about once a week.  The only thing I changed was no freezing and I bake at 350 covered for 20 to 25 minutes, and I remove the foil after 15 minutes so the tortillas get crispy. I serve with Ranch dressing or SW ranch.

This is just like Chili's!
Delicious....I know how to make Philippine egg rolls, so it was a breeze for me to make this. I used egg rolls wrappers, added a little more spinach to make it healthy. Cilantro or parsley, it does not make a difference. Roll the egg rolls tight and seal the eggrolls using water (wet the end. I usually fry it, but lately, I sprayed them with cooking spray and bake...Yummy......For the sauce, I serve it with low fat Ranch dressing( 1 cup dressing plus 1 TBS Chili powder.

I had just bought a bunch of canned chicken from Costco and was looking for something to do with it. I just added the drained, canned chicken into the mixture in the pan and broke it apart.  I highly recommend this.  It also works well with rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  With one can of chicken I felt the need to double the onion (used yellow onion) and bell pepper and needed about 1/2 can or more of black beans.  Also, I changed up the other ingredients a bit to suit our taste - eliminated spinach, jalapenos, parsley and cayenne and added 1/2 can diced green chiles, 1/4 tsp. onion powder and fresh ground pepper.  Kept the measurements on the seasonings as listed in the recipe.  I used soft taco sized flour tortillas but didn't stuff them as full as you would a burrito.  I ended up with 6.  No need to use toothpicks.  Placed them in a 9 x 13 pan lined with heavy duty foil and sprayed with PAM and baked at 425 for about 15-20 minutes.  If frozen (not necessary but good option) you'll need to cook longer.  Excellent result considering you just cut out a ton of fat by not deep frying.  Everybody loved them.

The entire family loves this! All four of my boys asked me to make this 3 days in a row.  Thankfully I quadrupled the recipe and had left overs for them.  Its a new family favorite.  I did bake them, used cilantro instead of parsley and used green chiles instead of the jalapenos only  because it was what I had.  I also served with spanish rice 2 and Amy's cilantro cream sauce--both amazing and both from this site!

Honestly, I'm giving 5 stars based on the filling alone. Good Gravy! This stuff's YUMMY! I tripled the recipe with no changes other than I sprinkled my chicken breasts with Adobo before cooking them. Rolled in egg roll wrappers, sprayed with non-stick spray & baked @ 375. I just couldn't get the wrapper "crispy" like I thought it should be. Now granted, the original recipe called for tortillas & deep frying, so I'm not taking anything away for that. BUT I made quesadillas with the extra filling - and Man Oh Man!! Seriously good eatin'! Next time, I'll just go the quesadilla route & keep the filling the same.

i used flour tortillas, not eggroll wrappers and it worked great. i left the toothpicks in to cook and served with a creamy dip (cilantro cream dip) i found on this website also. this as a little time consuming, but i made and froze them the night before, and it's worth all the effort!!! also, this recipe made 9 rolls for me. Make a triple or quadruple batch, you'll be glad you have them in the freezer!!

I'm only giving this three stars because though the filling is great, trying to roll them like an egg roll using trotillas is impossible.  I think next time I'll try using egg roll wrapers or puff pastry.

I made these today for a super bowl party and they were a HUGE success!  I doubled the recipe, used cilantro instead of parsley and added a tsp of garlic powder.  I also used eggroll wrappers instead of the tortillas.  They tasted almost exactly like the ones from Chili's.  I also made the Amy's cilantro cream sauce for dipping YUMMM!

These were absolutely delicious.  I read all the reviews and debated whether to fry or bake them.  Since I was trying to recreate the ones from Chili's that my husband loves I decided to fry them, and the result was amazing, they were almost identical.  The only thing I did different was to omit the jalapenos and use pepper jack cheese instead.  I served them with Amy's Cilantro Cream sauce and it was a perfect pairing.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!
P.S. I made these a second time with egg roll wrappers instead and I definitely prefer them this way! The egg roll wrappers were much more delicate and easier to eat. And if you use this method don't freeze them, just fry immediately or refridgerate.

DO NOT DEEP FRY!!!  This dish is so full of good for you veggies it is a sin to deep fry!  Just bake in the oven at 475 for 15 minutes.  They get very crispy in the oven!  You don't have to freeze them either if you bake!!

I have made these twice.  Once for company and once for my family.  I love these!  I ommit the beans and add more chicken and I also did not put in cumin, because I didn't have any.  Even though there are jalapenos and cayane pepper, this recipe is VERY mild.  The cheese and tortillas cancel out the flavor.  If you love spice ADD MORE!!  Also, I used extra virgin olive oil, because I just use that for everything.  And of course, I do not deep fry, I bake em!!

Oh....My....God!!!! OMG OMG OMG.  These were phenomenal.  I use the website so often.  I'm always looking for new things to try and can't wait to hear my husband's reviews. But this one is ALL for me! :0) After the first bite I was prepared to tell him he could order pizza for himself and I'd eat the whole darn batch myself LOL.  Not necessary at all, he loved them as much as I did. Pretty much made as written with exception that I made 1/2 with tortillas and 1/2 with egg roll wrappers (double-wrapped the egg roll wrapped ones).  Both were good, but the egg roll wrappers were by far the best choice for these.  These were so, so good. They tasted just like I was hoping they would. 10 starts from me!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!! It is bar far one of my favorites

These are really good, I did 1 1/2 recipe for filling and used 8 egg roll wrappers instead. The egg rolls were on the smaller side and one adult could easily eat between 2-4 egg rolls for dinner.  Added a little more spinach and baked in the oven for 12 minutes at 400.

This recipe was really good. The only thing I didn't have was the parsley so I subbed some cilantro. I think that's what it was missing when people said it was just ok. They tasted very close to chilis. I also threw in a little garlic. To those that said it was bland, do you not taste your cooking before proceeding?  Yes it was a little bland, but I added seasoning until it was to my liking. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I had a little trouble when it came to frying these.  Was I supposed to leave the toothpick in when I fried them?  They came unwrapped and it was a mess.  The filling was awesome though.

For a lighter version:  Preheat the oven to 425°F.  Lightly oil a baking sheet with cooking spray.  Place the sealed egg rolls on the baking sheet seam side down and spray the tops of the egg rolls with cooking spray.  Bake for about 15 minutes, or until lightly brown, turning halfway through baking.

We love this recipe!! We were searching for recipe like this and we're so happy we found it. It is a fun recipe to make together with the family. My husband I compete to see who can make the best looking spring rolls. 

My sugg. is to roll them as tightly as possible because they sometime try to come loose when deep frying. 
We have tried the recipe several times and like to use eggroll wrappers instead of flour tortillas but both ways are wonderful.

I made these for a football party last night and they were a huge success.  I tripled the recipe and used eggoll wrappers until I ran out but then tried flour tortillas.  I also served them with a jalepeno ranch dressing.  Our guests loved them and my husband couldn't stop bragging about how good they were.

awesome!!  I make these alot, sometimes using tortillas, other times egg roll wraps, which are alot easier to roll and fry.  I usually make double b/c i try to use the whole can of beans & box of spinach  so I just freeze the leftover filling for next time.  Definitley serve with "Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce"!!--that just puts it over the top!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were fantastic!  Even better the next day.  Also used Amy's sauce from this site and baked instead of fried them.  YUMMY!!

The filling was delicious and I could have eaten it with a spoon, but once assembled I think they were more like a burrito than an egg roll. I did bake them instead of fry. I will make these again.
**I had to change my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars. I froze the extra's and baked them a few days later, they were even better than the day they were made! I also forgot to mention that I used fajita seasong in place of the cumin.

Exellent. I don't know about other people, but I left the tooth picks while frying and it worked out really well. The egg rolls where perfect. I just took the tooth picks out after the frying. Everything was really, really yammy. I left the egg rolls in a freezer for over night and I don't think it would hurt them to stay in there a little while longer.

This was just what I was looking for! I added extra spinach and used eggroll skins to deep fry right away.  No restaurant in town has a better southwest eggroll than this! Highly reccomended.

I made this recipe with egg roll wrappers rather than tortillas (and a few in little bit size ones with wonton wrappers that I had leftover!) and rather than making 5 servings I made 60.  I cut the cheese in half.  They weren't just good, they were AMAZING!  I laid them on wax paper and froze them individually in the freezer and then dumpted them in bags so I'll have plenty to cook when I want them.  I'm sure they'd be great baked, but they can be fried from frozen in just a few minutes!  Yum!

These were great. We used egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas, brushed them with olive oil and baked for 10 minutes at 450 degrees. Also, for dipping sauce, we mixed sour cream, avocado and garlic. Will definitely make again!

Oh. My. Goodness. These are HEAVEN! These are my FAVORITE item at Chili's Restaurant and I must say, mine were much better, definitely healthier, and obviously cheaper! I took the advice of other posters and used eggroll wrappers, brushed them with canola oil, and baked them at 425 for 15 minutes. Absolutely delicious!

I really don't know what took me so long to make these...they are AWESOME! I quadrupled the recipe to use up all the ingredients and have leftovers in the freezer. The list of ingredients seem like a process, but this came together super quick and very easily! I cooked my chicken the night before, which made the process go even faster. I served these w/ 'Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce' for dipping, which was a great combination. These really did remind me of the famous chain's version and something that I will be making often! Thanks for sharing. :)

These are much better with eggroll wrappers.  First time they were kind of dry.  Second attempt I used creamed spinach - HUGE difference and so much better!!!  Taste exactly like the restaurant version.  They also freeze well and reheat great in the oven or toaster oven.

These were delicious, but had too much jalapeno for our taste buds!  I baked these and served with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce which I also highly recommend.  I will make these again with less jalapenos and try them with egg roll wrappers also as others have suggested.

We love these and so does anyone we've ever served them to.  Two things we did different.  We simply added all ingredients together - didn't cook on stove (except chicken).  We did this ahead of time and put in fridge overnight to let all ingredients come together.  Instead of deep frying, we put in over for 8-10 minutes on each side or until slighlty brown & crispy ...  Much healthier and absolutely delicious!  Try dipping in Wal-mart's Spicy Ranch dressing ...  So yummy!

I love this recipe!  I tripled the recipe and made 20 rolls for my book group thinking I would have lots of leftovers, but the 6 of us ate all but 5 of them! Here are the suggestions I used from other reviews; I used green chile instead of red pepper, creamed spinach, cilantro instead of parsley, Pepper Jack cheese and eggroll wraps. They couldn't have been yummier!  I also tried a whole wheat tortilla sprayed with oil and then baked for 15 minutes in a 350 degree oven and it a very good healthy alternative!

Instead of making eggrolls, I used this as a filling for quesadillas.  Very yummy!  I didn't add the jalapenos and went ahead and used the full can of corn and black beans, otherwise they probably would have went to waste.  I added some chopped cilantro and think I would make them this way again.  Thanks for sharing.

All I have to say about this recipe is "FANTASTIC". Thank you so much for sharing Jackie. My husband loved it as well. They're alot of work to make, but they freeze so well it's worth the effort to make extras like I did (quadrupled the recipe)and store in the freezer for future use. Make sure you don't insert the toothpick so far into the tortilla that it's hard to remove. I removed them as soon as I got them out of the fryer, which made them very easy to remove. I also, had sour cream and hot sauce with ours and would have tried Ranch dressing if I had any on hand at the time, which I'm certainly going to try the next time.

I made these for a pot-luck lunch for work.  They were a hit!!  I did not fry them, so they were kind of like mini-burritos.  They would also be good using won-ton skins and frying them.  I converted the recipe to serve 25 people, and the spinach did not convert right.  I only used one package of spinach.  They were great.  If the Jalapenos were left out, I think kids would really like these.  They were a little spicy, but had an excellent flavor.  I will definately make these again!

These SW Eggrolls are the best.  They beat every restaurant I have tasted.
The mixture of ingredients is poportioned just right to give it the proper texture.
After tasting the mixture before stuffing, I changed only one thing by adding a 
bit more cayenne to up the heat but the taste was great even without it also.

These are awesome. I followed other posters' advice and baked at around 400-450 for around 10 minutes.  One suggestion that makes them better: lightly brush the outside of the shells with olive oil, so the shell doesn't get too crispy.  Even a very thin coating makes a big difference.  Also, I have made the mixture the da before and stored in fridge to make on "as needed" basis; the flavor just gets better! Love these :)

These are awesome!  we bake instead of fry and also use the egg roll wrappers.  

Note: don't make ahead of time and let sit in fridge before baking.  Don't turn out too well.

It came out perfectly awesome.....I added sum extra cheese because I'm a cheese fan but the overall taste was great!!! :)
One little thing is that even though I froze them a couple opened when I dropped them in the oil but that was fine because I put them right in the oven.

I made these for a baby shower, everyone raved about them. I thought they were better than Chili's not so "pasty". I tried both tortillas and egg roll wrappers. The wrappers were much easier to roll and fried up crisper and more tender.

I used egg roll wrppers and baked on 400 until golden brown.  Do not waste any ingredients, just go ahead and double or triple the recipe because you will wish you had.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I would suggest using Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce with this.

I used traditional egg roll wrappers, as the fat content and carbs were about the same as the flour tortilla wraps. I added avocado's and made an avocado-ranch dipping sauce! So good, my family loved them.

Amazing little snack.  Don't underestimate the freezing step, they seem like they will fall apart, but once frozen they will stay together.  I used my deep fryer to heat these bad boys up.

These were great.  I made a few changes, due to what I had on hand.  I used egg roll wrappers, instead of tortillas and added more cilantro.  Since we had just moved and my deep fryer was packed up, I baked them.  THey turned out great.   However, I have no doubt they are awesome with tortillas and next time I will definitely deep fry them.  Also, I took 8oz velveeta melted and added a can of  rotel to dip them in.  Made these for a party and was lucky I even got one!  They were eaten almost as quickly as I put them out!  Thanks for sharing!

These are delicious. I spray them with cooking spray and bake them in the oven instead of deep frying. A new favorite in our house.

These are soooooo good! I made them with tortillas and egg rool wrappers, they were much better with tortillas! I also baked mine vs frying for a healthier option. Will be making this again!

This was delicious - made a couple of additions that were also terrific.  Added 1/3 cup plain cream cheese (you can use whipped or regular)and 1 avocado (chopped).  I mixed in the cream cheese when the chicken mixture was still hot when removed from stove (incorporate well so you don't have blobs of cream cheese) and mixed in avocado right before putting into tortillas (incorporate gently).

Also cut way down on the oil for frying - used only about 1/4 of olive oil and it was plenty to make them gold brown and melted inside.

Used multiple dipping sauces including:  jalapeno ranch dressing, guacamole, salsa and sour cream.  Highly recommend this recipe!

I'm always looking for a great recipe that I can turn vegetarian, plus I love Mexican food--the spicier the better. I've made these twice now using fake chicken strips that I chop into cubes. I much prefer the egg rolls to the tortilla version. They are lighter and crispier. I used black soybeans the second time because that's what I had along with pepper jack cheese. Definitely worth doubling or tripling the recipe because these are fantastic! I dipped them into El Torito's cilantro salad dressing as a dip. They are a bit greasy like anything deep fried, but that just added to their deliciousness. Next time I'll try baking them.

These are AWESOME!! I made them 2 days ago and changed up the recipe a bit, to my tastes. 
Used carrots instead of spinach, serano pepper, garlic and some white onion as well as the green onion, cilantro instread of parsley, squirt 1/2 lime juice over mix after cooked. I added cayenne, S&P, garlic powder and chili powder to my chicken, and chili powder and cumin to my mix. VERY Flavorful! Wasn't lacking anything. I also used lumpia wrappers instead of tortilla or egg roll wraps, altho they are similar to egg roll wraps, they are sooo much better! I also brushed them with canola oil and baked them at 425 degrees for about 15 mins flipping 1/2. They were good, then the next day I made them again and fried them instead and they were FANTASTICALLY AWESOME!!! 
With my mods and frying them, they were AMAZING! Also, I wanted to make the cilantro cream sauce with them, but that was more than what I had on hand, so instead we ate these with SPICY RANCH!! That was AWESOMER!! haha All I had to do was buy a pkt of hiddenvalley  spicy ranch mix and add 1 c each of mayo and milk... it is the perfect dipping sauce, and NO not really spicy, just awesome flavor! THANKS!!

These SW egg rolls are fantastic! I followed the recipe basically as written, but without the jalapenos. I also added fresh cilantro instead of parsley. Will definitely make again and again. I served it with Creamy Avocado-Ranch Dip from this site. Excellent combination!

I followed this recipe exactly except for frying them only because I was out of oil and didn't realize it so I baked them. They still turned out very good. I do want to try frying them next time and maybe even try with egg roll wrappers instead. Thanks!

So Yummy! Did recipe exactly but used tortillas because that is all I had on hand and I also baked them to make them healthier.  Since we have little ones I omitted the cumin and jalapenos but added it to ours before wrapping them.  I cheated and used premade frozen buffalo wings and diced them up, but it was so tasty in the wraps and made it super spicy. For the little ones, I used premade popcorn chicken and diced it up.  I don't like to cheat but that's all I had on hand and it worked perfect.  Will probably use a real chicken breast next time so there's not as many preservatives.  Perfect quick and easy recipe!  Something I will definitely add to the weekly mix.  Great served with homemade salsa!  Next time I will use eggroll wrappers instead of the tortillas.  The tortillas were a little too much, I think the wrappers will not be as overbearing in taste!

These were a huge hit at the  "Fajitas & 'Ritas Party" we had last night!  I'm not a cook by any means but I followed the recipe to a T and they were delicious!! I will definitely make these in bulk to keep in the freezer for an easy appetizer in the future!

I made these for a family party and they were a hit!  I boiled chicken breasts and then shredded the chicken rather than dicing it.  Before adding the mixture into the wrappers, I also added some more spices for flavor (garlic powder, onion powder, cayanne, etc.).  

I also used the egg roll wrappers - I found that they were much easier to deal with than the tortillas.  I made the egg rolls a couple days before the party and froze them.  Then I baked them on the day of the party for 15 mintues at 450.  As others suggested - I served with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce.  

Highly recommend!

Like others, I used egg roll wrappers and stuffed with 2 tablespoons of the filling.  I tripled the filling and had enough for 20.  Lined a baking tray and sprayed the tray and rolls with vegetable oil, baked at 425 for 10 minutes, flipped and gave the other side of the rolls a quick spray of oil and baked for another 5 minutes.  Served with avacado sauce.  LOVED THEM!!!

These egg rolls are great and I've been making them for quite some time. However, while recently making some Chinese egg rolls, I noticed virtually the IDENTICAL recipe on the wrapper of the egg-roll wrapper package. So although these are definitely delicious, the recipe is definitely not original...

These were great.  I left out the spinach and used wonton wrappers instead of tortillas.  I would have gone for egg roll wrappers but the grocery store was out of them.  It pairs nicely with ranch dressing.

I thought these were amazing!! I left out the corn because I didnt have any and didnt put the beans in because I dont like beans.. But other then that followed the recipe exactly as is and these were amazing.  I used egg roll wrappers instead.  I also fried some and baked others based on other reviewers and the fried ones are 100x better! I'll definately be making these again!

This was my first attempt at any sort of egg roll. I thought the flavor was great, though I did double all of the spices. I left out the chicken and doubled the black beans and used egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas. The family loved them!

Yummy! Not sure why it was necessary to freeze them for 4 hours- mine were still a little frozen on the inside even after deep frying them.

The flavor of the ingredients blends so nicely.  I skipped the freezing and baked, rather than fried, and we were still very happy with it.  What was nice was that I was able to cook everything without the chicken in it to make a couple of rolls for my vegetarian, then added my cooked chicken for the rest of us.  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good. Used Amy's Cilantro Cream sauce as a dip. Rolled them, placed them on a baking sheet, sprayed with Pam, baked until golden brown.

YUM! That is it. =) I used eggroll wrappers like a few other people.  Thanks for a super delicious appetizer recipe.  They rocked at our Iron Bowl party!  There is a cilantro dip recipe somewhere on here and I made that to dip them in, it was so good!

I absolutely love this recipe! Instead of raw chicken, I used Tyson's Grilled and Ready, fully cooked, Fajita chicken strips.  I tossed those around in the frying pan with a little olive oil.  When they were tender, I chopped them up, in the pan, with a metal spatula.  I didn't have any parsley, so I used fresh chopped coriander (cilantro).  I didn't have canned spinach, but I did have some fresh spinach in the fridge; I chopped that up. I used a jalapeno pepper,instead of canned.  I added some chopped Mexican onion, minced red onion, fresh organic chives, and chopped green onion. I used fresh cumin seeds. I didn't have black beans, so I used red beans instead.  I used egg roll wrappers, instead of tortillas.  I used the Kraft Mexican mix cheese instead of just plain Monterey Jack.  I used Birds Eye Specially Seasoned, Southwestern Style Corn, which came already mixed with chopped green and red peppers.  Because the chicken and the corn mix were already seasoned, I didn't have to add much salt.  After chopping the chicken while it was still in the pan, I just tossed everything else in, cooked for a little while.  If you know how to cook, then you'll know when it's ready.  I added a couple dashes of seasoned salt at the end.  It was great!  I used avocado ranch dipping sauce.  Wow!  Amazing!  Also, I would like to add that I deep fried mine in sesame seed oil, instead of vegetable.

Made quesadillas out of it instead and added fresh basil and used chopped yellow onion instead of green onion--no parsley.  Topped it with light sour cream and fresh salsa--Yummy!!

These egg rolls were beyond good!  I used egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas and baked them in the oven at 425 for 15 minutes and they came out crunchy and delicious! I added sliced carrots and omitted the spinach.  Definitely a keeper!

I cut back on the chili powder and jalapenos, but these were still delicious. Also baked at 450 degrees for 10 minutes instead of frying. Served with guacamole and sour cream. They were a big hit. Going to try making them spicier next time and looking forward to it.

I have to admit this recipe is pretty tasty but its not getting all my stars for 2 reasons.   1) I cant stand it when recipes don't use the full unit size of ingredients for instance it called for 2 tbsp frozen spinach, now what do I do with the rest? This is the case for most of the filling ingredients. I now have left-over spinach, frozen corn, black beans, and a partial pepper   2)way too many steps for a weeknight dinner. I used egg roll wrappers and I boiled them before filling so that the flour was cooked. then i baked  as other reviewers had suggested. I served it with a mixture of blue cheese dressing and salsa I will probably use all the left over ingredients to make the filling again and just cook it up quesidilla style because i really do like the flavor.

This recipe is delicious.  Upon reading a couple reviews I noticed that this recipe is a version of a popular restaurant.  So no wonder its so good!  There is a avacado ranch dipping sauce thats supposed to go with them that isnt included in this recipe.  If you do a simple search for these, you will be able to find it on zaar if you like.  I just dipped them in salsa and sour cream and they were delicious!  If your frying these use egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas.  Tortillas would be better if your planning on baking them in the oven.  These are great to make a big batch and keep in the freezer, so when you want some you'll always have them ready and you can just pull them out and fry them up!  A favorite!

The only regret i have is not trying this sooner!!! I absi=olutely loved this recipe and will make it over and over and over. I baked the tortillas and served it with a combo of 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 salsa. Top 5 off AR i've tried.

Wow!  I cannot believe how much I enjoyed this recipe.  I originally decided to make this recipe because my husband is a huge fan of the Southwestern Egg Rolls at one of our favorite restaurants, and I was never really a fan.  However, once I tried them, I loved them!!  I made a few adjustments in accordance with the ingredients that I had in the house.  I used a frozen combination of red and green bell peppers and white onions in place of the red bell peppers and green onions, as that is what I had on hand.  I also used a cherry pepper from the garden in place of the jalapeno pepper as I did not have any.  I also did not have any cayenne pepper, so I skipped it.  After reading previous reviews, I noticed that many people were using egg roll wrappers in place of the tortillas.  Because I had both in the kitchen, I made half with egg roll wrappers and half with flour tortillas.  My husband and I both agreed that the egg roll wrappers were the best.  Next time I might try baking some of them, as others have suggested.  I cannot wait to make this as an appetizer for an upcoming party.  I know that it will be a hit!

I omitted the chicken and oil, adding more spinach. It was easy, I just mixed everything together and made triangles w/ wonton wrappers and baked. Much healthier.

So good!  I followed the directions to a tee, but baked them off instead of frying.  I rotated them once during the baking process and they browned on all sides.  This recipe is delicious and these are really as good as the ones at Chili's, if not better.

This is an awesome recipe. My family loved them. I made them without chicken and they were still great. I doubled the recipe and froze the extra to fry later. This recipe freezes very well. I cut the edge from the ends of the rolls on some of the rolls. It made them less bulky and my family enjoyed eating them better. Also when frying them I placed the edge face down in the fryer which seemed to keep the edge from separating. They are a hit.

AWESOME!!!  My husband and I love Chillis' southwestern eggrolls, in fact that and their soup is all that I every order there.  My husband said this recipie was BETTER than Chili's and I agree 100%!  I have never tried a recipie better than this and I've tried hundreds!  Definately take out the parsley and put in cilantro.  It has an awesome kick to it just the right amount of spicyness.  I have tried deep frying, baking and microwave, they are all good but I prefer oven baked.  These are a great nutritional substitute to the frozen burritos you buy at the grocery store.  Make a ton of these and freeze them for a quick dinner or after school snack, great for college kids or those that live on their own!!  If you have even one teenage boy and husband you need to double or triple the recipie!

These are great! I seasoned the chicken with chili powder before cooking and it had a blackened cajun flavor. I also used cilantro instead of parsley. I used eggroll wrappers and baked them at 425 for about 35 minutes and they turned out nice and crispy. Served with avocado ranch. I will be making these again. They reheat well after being cooked and frozen.

These were very good.  Used flour tortillas and I baked them at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes until they were brown and extremely crispy. Who needs deep fried when baking works.  Just served with sour cream but will work on what to serve it with - so many options.

I slightly changed the recipe because I needed to make it that day and could not wait overnight.
I used eggroll wrappers and deepfried them.  I also used ranch dressing as a dip.  Our friends loved
it.

Amazing egg rolls - 5-stars from this household! I used all of the ingredients listed, with the exception of the oil for frying, as I baked ours.  I mixed everything up, and formed the egg rolls. I placed them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and baked them at 450° for 10 minutes, flipping them at the 6 minute make.  My DH & DS devoured these in no time flat!  I served them with 'Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce' and 'Tasty Spicy Rice Pilaf' both from AR.  With school getting ready to start, I plan on making a large batch of them and freezing for a quick meal.  Thank you, Jackie, for sharing your recipe, it is a winner!

These were a hit for a family party. I actually cut them in half and served them with a cilantro dipping sauce as an appetizer. I followed the recipe as much as I could but I only had canned corn and I used 8 inch tortillas. I opted to use the larger tortillas since I knew I was cutting them up as an appetizer. I get requests all the time to make them. Now I just quadruple the recipe and keep them in my freezer. This way if I have somewhere to go or have people pop over I can just quickly stick them in my deep-fryer and they are ready to go. Yum!

These were awesome. I made these for a mexican themed potluck and they were a crowd pleaser. I used some leftover grilled chicken breast I had in the fridge. I used the flour tortillas, sealed them with a flour and water paste and deep fried right away. No freezer time! and they came out perfect. Served with Amy's cilantro lime cream sauce. Delicious!  This will be a go to recipe in my house.

The filling is great! I found the preparation to be needlessly difficult, though. Skip the freezing and frying, and just fill the tortillas and bake them at 350 instead, flipping half-way through. It was only 30 minutes start to finish this way, including baking.

Kind of a pain for such a little amount of food. The flavor was good, though. Next time I'll probably skip the novelty of trying to roll them like an egg roll and I'll just make burritos out of the filling. I used green peppers instead of the red, a full can of corn and black beans, and no spinach.

My family loved these!  I used egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas...I made a double batch and froze some to fry later.  This is a keeper.

I followed this recipe to a T -- except -- baked instead of fried. They were restaurant quality, very yummy. 

Be sure to use THIN flour tortillas, not the soft/puffy variety. To bake, place rolls on a baking sheet covered with parchment if you have it. Coat rolls with cooking spray and bake on center rack at 450 for 10-12 min., checking halfway through, until dark golden brown. 

I doubled the filling recipe and made 8 rolls using 8-inch tortillas, adding avocado slices to half of them before rolling. Sliced finished rolls in half on the diagonal to serve. Worked out very nicely.

I baked them at $25 for 20 minutes and put chile verde on top. And used corn tortillas I'd oiled in a pan first. Yumm!

Good.  Made with egg roll wraps.  I wrapped and then refrigerated, then baked.  They were kinda hard/chewy so maybe that's not the best thing to do!  I didn't use spinach because I didn't want to open a ten-ounce box for two tablespoons.  Also, next time, I would up the ratio of veggies to chicken.

These were amazing!  I also baked these (at 450° for 10 minutes, per another reviewer) instead of fried them to keep it a bit healthier, but I imagine they're great fried, too -- I'd love to try them with a crunchy tortilla.  Anyway, I served these (again, with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce... a wonderful recipe, and they went great together... though I'd eat that sauce with anything) as appetizers for a dinner party, and they were gone almost immediately!  They are a bit filling, so I would actually caution anyone else to serve them as an appetizer.  Next time I make them, it will be for dinner.  ;)  One comment on the name of the dish -- they seem more like spring rolls than egg rolls.

Absolutely loved it!!!  The great thing about this recipe is that you can switch up the vegetables depending on what you have on hand, just make sure you're tasting along the way to measure spice/flavor.  Instead of chicken breast I used canned chicken, and then just increased the vegetables to compensate for the additional chicken. I used swiss chard instead of spinach as well as fresh carrots, corn, and anaheim peppers.  If I had more tortillas, I easily could have made a dozen rolls (maybe double if I used less filling in each one).  I froze some of the rolls for later, but baked a few fresh at 425º for 10-20 minutes on a wire cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet (to allow for air flow) until lightly browned and crispy.  Next time I'll definitely make avocado ranch to go with!

The first time I made this recipe, my husband thought I had picked up takeout with my favorite appetizer. They are time-consuming but WORTH it! I've made big batches and they freeze great. Perfect for an indulgent treat or a party. I make them exactly as stated and they come together JUST like the restaurant ones that I crave.

Great basic recipe and you can definitely modify it to suit your tastes.  I didn't follow it exactly but that's the beauty of it. Versatile. And I did bake them @ 450 like a lot of others to make them healthier.. and I had a couple of really lean leftover pork chops (you know the ones that are so lean they are really not good as leftovers b/c they are tough).. I just chopped those up really small and used them instead of chicken.. no one knew the difference.

Taking all the high ratings into consideration, I expected to love these. While they were good, they werent my favorite dish on the table. I didnt add the chicken and made in eggroll wrappers and baked. My father in law loved them and kept going back for more. Ill make again, next time with the chicken.

These were pretty good. Can't say I found them full of flavor but were a joy to cook. Might try adding a bit more spice next time as most of the ingredients were just fillers for the wraps. Went good with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce from this site.

I made these eggrolls for a Christmas party and everyone love them. I had to use corn tortillas because my family is gluten free and was a bit worried about how they would turn out. They turned out great! Thank you for the recipe.

These were amazing! I didn't freeze them and deep fry them though.  I followed the instructions exactly, then at the end I sprayed them with cooking oil and baked them at 450 degrees for 20 minutes, flipping them and respraying half way in to make sure they were nice and crispy on both sides. 
Absolutely fantastic! Thanks for sharing!

My family enjoyed these.  We used spring roll wrappers and didn't freeze them.  Next time, we will use the egg roll wrappers since we all agreed that there wasn't enough roll to filling ratio but the rest was great!  We will play with the filling a little bit because as much as we enjoyed it there was just a little room for improvement for our personal preferences.  Thank you for posting!

If you haven't tried these you are missing out. Everyone who has tried them has loved them. Another reviewer suggested eating them with Amy's Cilantro Sauce from this website. Great idea, I am eternally grateful! 5/29/12- Tonight I baked these at 450 for 15 minutes like another reviewer suggested. They were awesome! No freezing required.

These were very good!  Best baked at 425* for about 15 minutes.  They DO taste like Chili's Southwestern Egg Rolls, but do yourself the favour and deep fry them - there's something to be said for a little bit of deep-fry!

We fixed them for a party at our house and they went over very well. I baked rather than frying and they were still very good. I had to cut back on the heat in them. Additionally I used a whole package of frozen chopped spinach and corn.

Believe the reviews! These really are amazing! I made these for a get together and doubled the recipe. They were a HUGE hit! I used won ton wrappers and baked them instead of tortillas and frying. The jalapenos I used were VERY spicy so made them a little hotter than I had expected. I also served these with "Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce" and they were wonderful. Even my husband who 'dislikes' mexican food LOVED them! Thank you Jackie!

UPDATE!
So I was curious to see how the recipe varied by using egg roll wrappers or tortillas, and a frying or baking each of them. I have tried all 4 varieties and have to say that the method of frying the ones in the egg roll wrappers are by far the best! I thought this was the best recipe ever until I tried this and they're even that much better now!

All the great reviews pretty much say it all. I used egg roll wrappers and sprayed with cooking spray and baked in the oven at 425 for 15 minutes. They were perfect. Everyone thought they were fried because they tasted so good and crunchy. Made everything else exactly like recipe. Can't wait to make again.

These were really good!  They tasted a lot like the ones from Chili's.  I kind of just eyeballed the ingredients.  I also ended up using four 10-inch tortillas instead of the 6-inch ones because that's what I had on hand.  Like other reviewers, I baked mine.  I sprayed the bottom of a pan and then sprayed the outsides of the egg rolls.  I baked them for 15 minutes at 475, turning them midway through.  They came out nice and crispy.  I will definitely be making these again soon!

Everybody should try making these. They are that good. It is easy to make additions and subtractions to meet your liking. I tried with both tortillas and egg roll wrappers and I like the wrappers best. They weren't as thick and they were easier to wrap (though they don't stick with the Southwestern theme.) Like others, I chose to bake them. Why add all that grease when they are great just sprayed with a little cooking spray and then baked. With 2 table spoons of this and 2 table spoons of that you should really take a little time and just make a huge batch since they do freeze so nicely. If you bake them before you freeze them, they are great in lunches. Try making a sauce of sour cream, salsa and cumin for dipping. I will definitely spend the time to make these over and over again. Yum.

Sensational Jackie! I make traditional egg rolls all the time so I was really excited when I ran across this Southwestern version. Instead of chicken I used ground turkey and just because I'm not a huge flour tortilla fan, I used regular egg roll wrappers which I doubled.  Spicy Ranch dressing made for some really nice dipping. Everyone loved these Jackie and you can be sure I'll be making these over and over again. Thank you so very much!

OUTSTANDING!! I used whole wheat tortillas, olive oil to cook the chicken, cheddar cheese (was all I had on hand) and canned corn instead of frozen. Sprayed the rolls with vegetable cooking spray and baked 375 for 25 minutes, spraying again at 20 mins. Dipped in ranch dressing with chili powder stirred in!! Now a favorite!!

I made these as written with the exception of using egg roll wrappers as many others did, and baking rather than frying. (I also didn't use the spinach - who has two tablespoons of frozen spinach just hanging around?) They were good. I'm just not sure they are exciting enough to justify going through all the prep work to put them together.

This would be 10 stars if I could give 10! I did change a few things, but none of them were things that would affect the overall taste of the original recipe. I omitted the bell pepper because we're not crazy about it, used leftover chicken that I'd roasted over the weekend and baked them at 450 for about 17 minutes. SO GOOD! They taste just like the ones we always enjoy at Chili's and are so much more quick to make than I'd have ever guessed. Thank you for a recipe we will have again and again.

These were really pretty good.  I made them 3 different ways ... all baked, though ... I put some of the filling in flour tortillas, some in egg roll wrappers and some in phyllo (fillo) cups.  Family didn't care for the ones in the tortillas, but the ones in wrappers and cups were devoured! Couldn't really taste the chicken, so I won't hesitate to make these without chicken if I don't have it on hand.

So glad I read the reviews before making this - I followed the recipe with some changes:  I used egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas because I did not want to deep fry these; baking the tortillas would have given these a thicker shell which I didn't want.  The egg roll wrappers worked out well and were very easy to use.  I cubed and cooked the chicken in garlic and onion and (1) package of fajita seasoning, then diced and added (1) red pepper, (1) jalapeno pepper, (1) green pepper, and (1) hablano pepper - cooked all that together, then added (1) cup instant rice and (1 1/2) cup chicken broth, corn and black beans and fresh parsley.  When the rice absorbed the liquid I spooned about two tablespoons mixure onto an egg roll wrapper, then wrapped and placed onto a greased cookie sheet - then I sprayed them with olive oil and baked at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, turned over and lightly sprayed again, and baked another 5 minutes.  Served with my own creamy cilantro sauce (1 pkg. lowfat cream cheese,  1/2 cup lowfat sour cream, tsp. each salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, 1/2 cup minced fresh cilantro - mixed and then pureed with an immersion blender until smooth).  The egg rolls were a huge hit and the sauce that was left over was eaten up with tortilla chips.

I had this recipe picked out to make for dinner on the 3rd of July while I was making a few other recipes from the site. When I had bought the ingredients for this recipe, I was using the version posted here, which did not specify what kind of jalapenos to use.... so I bought a fresh jalapeno. Since the site was down on the 3rd, I was forced to find the recipe elsewhere - where it specified to use pickled jalapeno slices (the ones in the jar). I used the fresh jalapeno instead, and I wish I hadn't! Using the amount of fresh jalapeno in this recipe tastes fine, but it was NOT worth my burning eyes when I tried to take my contacts out later! I know I should have used food-grade gloves when chopping the jalapeno, but I didn't have any lying around. In the future, I will always use the jalapenos in a jar!  Oh... and the recipe was delicious! I used more black beans than the recipe called for... just because we like them. I rolled in egg roll wrappers, and baked in a 425 degree oven until the egg rolls were golden and crispy - I think it was about 10 minutes. Also served with "Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce" which made a fantastic dipping sauce.

How can so many wonderful reviews be wrong!!  These were great!!  I used egg roll wrappers and baked them-didn't freeze them either.  Baked at 450 for about 15 minutes.  Used 1 can of chicken, i can of black beans and almost all spinach and it made about 16 rolls.

Just wonderful!  Definitely use egg roll wrappers, as others have suggested.  Lightly spritz with olive oil and bake at 450 for 15 minutes, flipping once. I make these vegetarian by substituting finely diced tofu for the chicken and they come out hearty and delicious.  Serve with a Mexican soup like tortilla soup.

These are fantastic! I sprayed them with veg. oil spray and baked them at 425 for about 12-15 minutes. They came out crispy! Next time I will double the recipe and freeze some to have on hand. My husband and I were surprised how filling these were. We had planned to have them as an appetizer but that ended up being the meal! Definitely try Amy's Cilantro Cream sauce with them from this site, perfect combo.

I made these as written, except that I went with reviewer, Emily's method, and brushed them with canola oil, then baked them at 475F for 15mins (from a frozen state), rather than deep-fat frying them.  They turned out really well.  Served with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce and Garden Tomato Salsa, each from this website.  Thanks for the recipe, Jackie!

LOVED THEM!  I left out the frozen corn & spinach and used a 15oz can of black beans.  I washed the beans to get rid of that weird canned bean smell.  I used cilantro instead of parsley and pepperjack monterey cheese instead of plain monterey.  I used un-cooked tortillas.  I warmed them up slightly on the comal and wrapped them tigtly. They stayed put without having to use toothpicks.  I froze them overnight.  I brushed them with vegetable oil and baked them 450 for about 30 minutes. (Also double the jalapeno, spice level is too weak)

I made these with fresh spinach instead of frozen, a serrano chili in place of a jalepeno, and I omitted the parsley as we aren't big fans. Like others, I also baked them in the oven (brushed them with a little melted butter first). I served them with a little sour cream mixed with lime juice and fresh snipped cilantro. The flavor was good but I wish I'd upped the ground cumin, and added some garlic powder too. I'll definitely be making these again but will try them with steak. Thanks, Jackie!

AWESOME!!  I, too, baked for 15 min. at 425, mainly because I didn't have four hours to freeze before frying, but we loved them so much, I don't know that I would fry them next time either!  I only had cheddar cheese at home, and it tasted great!

My husband adores these. I swapped the parsley with cilantro, and baked these at 425 for 17 minutes. These are spicy, so I served them with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce and it was the perfect compliment.

This recipe is so close to the real thing at Chili's!! Served with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce recipe on this site, I had a winner combination!! I don't think they need to be frozen for 4 hours though...maybe just refrigerated for while...TIP: DON'T remove the toothpicks before frying them..they will unravel and a mess you will have:( Next time I will double or triple the recipe and keep them in the freezer so I can have them anytime I want!! They are soooo GOOD!! Thanks!!

I've been making this for several years.  Instead of monteray jack and jalepeno's I just use pepper jack cheese.  I always spray mine with oil and bake at 450 for 15 minutes for a slightly healthier version.  Also consider doubling or tripling this recipie and freezing, then you will have some ready anytime you have a craving.

These were the best.  I had seen them on another site, but had forgotten about them.  When I saw them here, I knew I had to try them.    I served them with an avocado dipping sauce that's to die for.  These really are fantastic!

1/4 c avocado, 1/4 c mayo, 1/4 c sour cream, 1 T buttermilk, 1/8 t each salt, dried parsley, onion powder, 1 1/2 t white vinegar, a dash each of dried dill weed, garlic powder, and pepper.  Enjoy!

Wow these are awesome - taste just like the chain Chili's southwestern eggrolls, which my brother loves.  Made these and froze them before frying them (tripled the recipe), and going to give them to my brother for Xmas with a Fry Daddy Jr.  Hope he likes it.  Boiled the chicken for 20 minutes and shredded them instead; cooked the red pepper, then dumped in everything else and cooked for several minutes.  Stuffed about 14 8" tortillas with the tripled recipe.  Great stuff.

Tastes like Chili's! I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was excellent.I tweaked the recipe just a little.I added a package of chili mix instead of the chili powder. It turned out perfect.This is the second time I made this recipe.The first time it tasted too spinachy. This time it was the best!!!!!!!! I made enough for 30 eggrolls!

This was so easy to make.  I used the homemade tortillas they sell at Trader Joe's which are thicker than the tortillas sold in Grocery stores, and I think they were a little too thick for eggrolls.  My friend like them a lot, but he said they were more like chimichangas than eggrolls.  Another friend requested that I make these for her upcoming wedding shower.

This recipe was awesome! Guys and girls alike were drooling over the results. I only froze them for 30 min and they were perfectly fine. I served them with a 50/50 mixture of sour cream and fresh salsa as a dipping sauce, which added a nice coolness to heat (from the frying and the chiles). I'll definitely make them again! I might also add a little avocado into the mix.

This was really excellent! I took another reviewers suggestion and baked at 400 for about 15-20 minutes. I also sprayed them with butter flavored cooking spray. Nice and crispy. I just wonder how egg roll wrappers would be if baked?

The first time I made this,  I deep fried them in egg roll wrappers, based on the opinions of other reviews. They were very good, but also very greasy, and I cringed at the oil left on them, even wrapping them in paper towels after cooking.
   The second time I made them I baked them (2 in egg roll wrappers and 2 in soft taco wraps) at 475. I set the timer for 10 minutes, but removed them a little earlier (taking them out  when browned). I was surprised that both turned out crispy and  tasted REALLY good when baked. My wife liked the ones in egg roll wrappers better. She like the texture of the crispy egg rolls (the egg roll wraps really do crisp up nicely in the oven). I agreed, but also really liked the ones in soft taco wraps as well. 
   Based on my experience, if you are going to deep fry them it's important to cool the final mixture in the fridge until it's cold. I didn't cool the mixture completely, and the result was that when I deep fried them, the mixture turned out a little 'mealy', due to the high heat of deep frying.

These were very good, but a little bland. I tasted the seasoning before rolling and it tasted like plenty of salt. But after cooking, some of the seasonings seemed to mellow. However, I modified the servings, which can change the outcome. Easy fix. The chicken to vegetable ratio was a little heavy on the chicken. I will add more veggies next time. My husband cleaned his plate, so I definitely count that as a win! He's extremely picky and seemed disappointed when he saw the chicken mixture. But once I hold him I was going to wrap it up and fry it, he perked up. I did us egg roll wrappers.

I was making these egg rolls with Barlow's Blackened Catfish (also 5 stars try it as well) so I left out the chicken and I don't care for black beans so I left those out as well. Still awesome! Five Stars! I making 5 more tonight! I baked mine as well to cut down on the calories and they are so good you eat one before you sit down to eat your dinner! Five Stars! Thanks!

My daughter is the usually the one who inspires me to try recipes and mimic restaurant food items, if I don't when we go out to a family dinner she always picks the same places. She has decided she loves these more than the ones at Chilis, she even said last time we were there that theirs did not taste as good anymore. Unfortunately, these are not too healthy with the frying of tortillas, but I still make them occasionally. To reduce the unhealthiness I just make the filling for lunch without the cheese, and pair it with some beans or quinoa. This recipe is a keeper!

WooHoo. These were yummy.  Made exactly as written except I doubled the corn and omitted the beans. I froze these for a week and they still came out great.

I used a lot more of the ingredients in this recipe.  I cooked two chicken breasts, used 1 cup of black beans, 1 cup spinach, tripled seasonings, and baked as others suggested.  Some of the amounts in the recipe are just too skimpy.  Everyone enjoyed them.  It's a good recipe that can be adjusted to your taste.

Very delicious! I used Tofu crumbles instead of chicken breast and I put this in a burrito sized tortillas to make it a meal. I also doubled the spinach, corn and black beans.  I followed another reviewer and opted to skip the freezing and bake for 10 minutes at 450.

I make the filling and serve as a dip with tortilla chips.  Everyone raves over it.  Once I used cajun seasoned smoked chicken quarters.  Since the chicken was already cooked, I skinned, deboned and chopped the chicken in my food processor.  I just added it in at the end of the cooking with the cheese. I was able to use half the amount of oil doing it this way.

Very Good! Make sure to keep the rolls from touching each other when you put them in the freezer, they will stick together.

I really love this recipe.  I did cut back on the jalapenos but added a tbsp. of chipotle-flavored hot sauce.  After I'd mixed everything in but the cheese, I felt that something was missing.  I added 3 tbsp. of chopped cilantro and it really added just the right flavor.  I'd better state right now that I increased this recipe to 30 servings for a party.  I also baked these at 450 for 12 minutes and served them cut in half with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce from this site.  I will be making these again.

These are delicious!  I did not use chicken and made them vegetarian, and I did not use parsley.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and used 1/2 a flour tortilla rolled up like a taquito.  I fried them in a pan, I don't have a deep fryer.  I made the avocado dip that another reviewer suggested.  These were really great, will definitely make again.

Awesome! Made these for super bowl and everybody loved them! I followed the recipe exactly except I put avocado in the rolls, and baked them at 425 for 15 minutes flipping halfway through, like others had suggested. Tested just like chilis except much better! I also made avocado ranch dip to go along with it. Sooo yummy!

I made these last night for the first time. They were good, but they didn't have enough of a kick for me. I see I am going to have to tweak the recipe a bit to get it to my spice liking. And I also made the avocado dip that someone recommended. I was a little disappointed since I thought the dip was going to thicken, but it was actually a bit runny. But it still tastes good. All in all, this recipe is a good base and I will definitely be making these again in the future. Thanks for sharing.

I made this over the holidays and it was a huge hit. My 13 year old son went back for thirds, everyone loved it. I left out some of the heat due to the bf not being able to tolerate, but will definitely make again.

We were looking for something similar to Chili's Southwestern Rolls and these were perfect!  As other posts, we baked in oven, but still delicious!  Going to make them for my husband to take to his fire station tomorrow.  Hopefully, they will all enjoy as we did.  Thank you!

Loved these!!! Yummy! I needed a cool dip; so I took about a cup of sour cream and added 1/4 tsp chili powder, a pinch of cayanne pepper, 3 tbsp ranch dressing and thinned with a couple tablespoons of milk.

This recipe was very good, the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I didn't care for the flour tortilla, it was to thick.  I think next time I will use egg roll wraps, they are light and fluffy. Over all this was a very delicious recipe.  Thanks

These turned out great.  I baked them instead of deep frying them to make them a little bit healthier.  I will definitely make these again.

Made these tonight and they were delicious! A few changes I made is that I didn't add the beans because we didn't have  canned black beans and didn't want to spend 2+ hours cooking them. We also  used eggroll wraps just because it gives it a thinner, crispier crunch. Also, we didn't freeze them. Just cooked them straight away. I will definitely make this again and again!

Wonderful recipe but didn't want to deep fry so used medium size tortillas folded in half w/filling in middle then browned them in a skillet. They freeze nicely and make a great meal in a jiffy. I also use salsa and guacamole to top them.  Reheating can be done in the oven or microwave. I use the micro to defrost them and finish them up in either the toaster oven or a skillet.

I think these have the possibility to be very good, but next time I won't be adding so much jalapenos. I like spicy, but not so spicy that I can't taste what I'm eating and that's how these were. First of all I doubled the recipe because I was having just appetizers for dinner, so I wanted there to be plenty. Even in doubling the recipe I only added 1 additional tablespoon of jalapenos and diced them up very fine. The filling was fairly easy and quick to make, cutting up the chicken took the longest of course. I also used egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas like a lot of others had suggested. It was my first time cooking with wrappers so they got a little burnt in the oil and one was still frozen in the middle. I will make them again, just gonna tweak the recipe a little bit more.

This was great! I also baked it instead of frying.. baked at 425 for 15minutes and it was perfect and crisp. I wish I would have made extras! Added more jalapenos, because we like it alittle more spicy.
Thanks for the recipe! Will be making again and again.

I made this for my family, with a few tweaks. I use egg roll wraps instead of tortillas, and I don't really measure out the ingredients, just eyeball them. I also add some homegrown sprouts.This has become a staple in my house. I just double or triple the batch, freeze them, then take them out for whenever we want them!!!

I thought these turned out great and were pretty easy. Like some others I baked them in the oven and brushed with some oil before but because they weren't fried the tortillas were a bit dry so I dipped in guacamole but will probably try some cilantro lime ranch or something next time, cause I"ll make them again for sure!

Super recipe!  I made mine with eggroll wrappers, deep fried w. my Presto Deep Fryer and multiplied the recipe by 5.  To set the eggroll wrappers I made an eggwash out of a mixture of egg and milk and brushed it over the outside.  If you do it this way - and you have never used eggroll wrappers make sure that the individual servings aren't touching because they have a tendency to stick.  Wrapping was time consuming because of the quantity I made but I fried immediately without freezing with beautiful end result.  I was sloppy on the measurements but they came out wonderful.

I didn't get the chance to try these at all, I made them for my mother for a party she was hosting, I used egg roll wraps and froze. She told me she fried them prior to the party and put them in the oven to warm them up once guests arrived. They were so enjoyed I got asked for the recipe by about half of the guests. As I didn't get a chance to try them I don't know if I should add anything like cilantro or extra garlic.. I will be making again today following the recipe as is (well aside from using egg roll wraps) since they went over so well the first time.

I made a lot of changes to suit our tastes, but the base recipe is still utterly solid.  I doubled the recipe and distributed the filling among 12 tortillas instead of 10, used sauteed okra in place of the corn, shredded carrots in place of the spinach and cilantro in place of the parsley.  I also used ground chipotle pepper in place of the cayenne and added a few spoonfulls of medium salsa to the mix.  Finally, rather than frying, I coated these lightly with cooking spray, placed them in a glass baking dish and baked them for 30 minutes at 350.  Served them with salsa for dipping, and they were awesome!  While they were fabulous, however, chopping everything (even with a food processor!) took awhile, so we will not be making these often.  Good Sunday meal, but not convenient for weekdays.

YUM!  I have a picky family when it comes to food, so I adjusted the recipe by not including cheese or corn or spinach.  (Although the next time I'm going to make a batch with those for myself!)  We used eggroll wrappers and it was delicious!  My family learned to like black beans now so that's a bonus.  

Special note!  We made these twice.  The first time I accidentally spilled too much cayenne pepper and they turned out sooooooo tasty!  The second time I used just the right amount and they weren't quite as tasty.  I think for us, the spice was the trick.  So try adding a little extra cayenne if you like a little kick.

This recipe is fantastic! Excellent as written or additionally deliscious with some add in's like rice or steak.  Fried it is tasty, but we also ate just in a tortilla and it was just as good.  Will make again and again

Awesome! I used eggroll wrappers and baked at 425 and they were done in less than 15 minutes, but that was too hot for them to get brown up evenly. Next time, I'll probably go down to 400 and start with a foil cover for the first few minutes. Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce was perfect for dipping.

I scaled this recipe to 40 people and  took these to Christmas Eve where there were lots of people and they were completely gobbled up in no time! I made some with won-ton wrappers and some with flour tortillas.  I served sour cream on the side and left out the chicken just because there was so much food and I wanted to make something more snacky.  Everyone loved, loved, loved them!  Great recipe!!

Really this should be 10 stars.  FANTASTIC!!  I left out the chicken and just used old cheddar instead of Monterey Jack cause that's what I had.  Next time I make them I'll add lots of more spinach just cause I really like spinach.  Served it with sour cream and salsa for dipping.  I made some for my mom and rather than using oil, she just used a no stick frying pan and browned them in that and said they were just as good without the fat.  Thanks for posting!!

Awesome, we used egg roll wrappers instead.  I put a thin, but long slice of avocado in them too.  I made them twice the second time the first time I super stuffed them, they looked horrible.  The second time I barely stuffed them, I also left out the jalapeno.  The first time although uglier much tastier.

Healthier version - I love this recipe.  I make a triple batch as it is written and individually wrap each one in saran wrap.  I leave them in the freezer until I need them.  Believe it or not, they come out wonderful if you grill them on low heat.  They end up perfectly crunchy without the fat.  We sometimes throw them on the grill when we are grilling other things and they are a great addition to our meal.  They are great on their own, too.

If I could rate this recipe 10 stars I would.  These are even better than from the restaurant.  It's the perfect blend of flavors with the perfect amount of heat.  I've made them with and without chicken and both ways they are just as good.  They are a little time consuming, but it is more than worth it. I highly suggest that everyone gives them a try at least once!

I didn't have black beans or tortillas, so I used egg rolls wrappers.  Very good!  I used the the entire box of spinach (squeezed liquid out) and used hot mexican chili powder.  I did boil the chicken breast in water w/chipoltle pepper & 1 tbsp adobo sauce.  Nice and hot!

I've made these twice in two weeks and they were a hit both times! My entire department now has the link to this recipe. And at a Labor Day potluck, I was the only one without leftovers.  I used egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas. I grilled the chicken on my Foreman instead of pan frying. I froze them overnight. Instead of deep frying, I brushed them with olive oil and baked about 8 min. a side at 450.  The first time, I only froze for an hour, sprayed with cooking spray and baked at 425. They were good, but the second time crisped up much better.

Amazingly delicious recipe. I usually double the veggies and make extras. I've made this deep fried per the recipe, or also baked (for a lighter, healthier version). Both were very good.

I made a triple batch of this recipe for a party.. SOOO GOOD! nothing but compliments.. and everyone said this was the best version they have ever tasted. I also omitted spinach, and used egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas. I fried all of them 2 days before party, wrapped them in plastic wrap, placed in fridge and reheated at 425 degrees for 10-12 min. Not as crispy as when they are first fried.. but not soggy either. I served this with ranch dip that i added chili powder to. Next time I will try baking to make them a bit healthier. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that I will definetly be making over and over and over again!

SLAP ME SILLY THESE ARE FINE.  I was a little hesitant to try this recipe because it seemed a little time consuming.  The outcome was worth every minute. Turns out I didn't have plain black beans when I got ready to make this, but I had a can of Bush's Black Bean Fiesta Grilling Beans that I used instead.  I think these may have made the flavor even better because the Black Bean Fiesta has chipolte sauce in it.   Otherwise, I would not change a thing in the recipe.

These were pretty good. I definetely recommend using the toothpicks because I couldn't get the tortillas to fold securely. I would use smaller ones next time. It was almost too spicy for me so I suggest tasting as you go.

Wow! Unbelievably good! No spinach in mine. Used cilantro instead of parsley. Made a couple vegetarian, just leaving out the chicken for my vegetarian friend. She still loved them! I sprayed with butter Pam and baked at 450 for 10 minutes, flipped and baked for 5 minutes on the other side.

YUM!  Like other reviewers, I baked them instead of frying.  I upped the recipe to 20 servings and they flew off the plate!  I made an easy mix of an avocado and ranch dressing to dip them in.  Going into my regular rotation for party appetizers!

I made this many times. My very picky family loves it. I double recipe, add one can of black beans, subbed half can of rotel for jalepeno peppers, didn't include any chicken, green onion or spinach (last few times, I was in a haste), sprayed all over with cooking spray and baked at 450F until crisp. But it taste really good, nonetheless! Thanks for the recipe.

I am the chef at a sports bar and grill in Dania Beach, Florida. My clientele consists not only of local residents but tourists from around the world. I am expected to prepare extraordinary soups and specials on a daily basis...on a limited budget with limited time. My ratings are based on customer response...so take them seriously. I have earned the reputation as the Soup Nazi (Seinfeld  lol).  I use egg roll wrappers which are much easier to work with. Instead of using water to moisten the wrappers, I make a sauce and use a paint brush to moisten the wrappers before I put in the stuffing and roll them-ranch dressing with dijon and hot sauce is a good combination to paint the wrappers with or as a sauce to dip them in. The recipe is great as is but feel free to play around with the ingredients and spices.

MMMmmmmmmmmm. This is really, really good. I used the cilantro cream dip recipe from this site, and they are so good together! I also baked it on 475 for 20 minutes and sprayed with oil first. If you are hesitating to make these...don't!

Since I am vegetarian, I used LightLife "chick" strips instead of chicken. I used fresh spinach, and I did not have a jalapeno, so I left it out. I do not deep fry any food, so I baked these at 450 for 13 minutes - turning them half way through.  They were loved by all, even my 2 year old. I will definitely make this many times over.

What a great recipe!  I loved it!  I didn't have some of the ingredients, so I just added what I had.  I also added tomatoes to the mix of things.  I also used corn and flour tortillas.  I read the other reviews and baked them instead of frying.  I baked them at 350 degrees for about 10-15 minutes with foil then baked them at about 400 degrees to get the eggrolls browned, without foil.  I brushed a little olive oil on top of them before baking.  This is a keeper!

We loved this recipe.  Followed the ingredients in this one (not the cooking method) to a T. Even measured ALL them all.  At first, when tasting the filling before rolling I didn't think there was enough flavor but decided to leave it alone.  I made them at around noon, put them in the fridge and cooked them around 7pm.  After they were cooked the flavor was really enhanced!  So good! Not sure if was from resting or just cooking or both but they were just great!  We did brush them with oil and baked them instead of frying them.  I'm sure they would taste even better fried (as most things tend to do...) but baked is wonderful too.  Thanks for the recipe!  We served these with Baja sauce from this site.

These were great - I think my husband may love me a little bit more each time I make this recipe :)  I love the fact that it's actually fairly healthy, and can be used as a main dish - not just an appetizer.  I followed the recipe exactly, I simply chose to bake them at 400 for about 15 minutes instead of frying.  This actually makes the recipe much more quick and easy too - after filling, simply spray with olive oil spray and bake until crispy (no need to freeze!)  I was able to put these together in the morning, refrigerate until our party, then bake at the last minute - which is SO handy.  Since we liked these as is, I probably won't try the egg roll wrappers, as others have suggested.  I am going to try making the filling, and freezing it in batches for quick preparation in the future!

These were very very good.  The filling was very easy to make.  I prepared exactly as directed, but I thought the filling needed a bit more pizazz so I added some lime juice and chopped cilantro.  This really brightened the flavors.  

I used the flour tortillas as the recipe suggests, but I found rolling them a bit tricky and I think I would prefer a thinner wrap, so next time I will buy the square egg roll wrappers (in my opinion easier to work with than circular).  

I made my own dipping sauce with ranch dressing, sour cream, franks red hot, and a bit of chopped cilantro and scallions.  Next time I am going to try guacamole :)

Yum! I served these up as an appetizer to a small corwd and they were gone within minutes! There may have even been a fight over the last one! I made the stuffing just as the recipe states, but I didn't fry them, I brushed them with oil and baked them. I also used the wonton wrappers instead of tortilla wraps. I served them up with "Baja Sauce" (recipe from this site) which made these perfect and irresistable in every way!

This is a great recipe that you can do a lot of different things with.  My favorite option is this:  First, use diced steak or stir fry beef instead of the chicken.  I add a little extra cayenne and chili powder to give it more of a kick and leave out the spinich (personal preference).  Instead of deep frying them, I roll them up and spray them with 0 Calorie spray butter (it's really just a soybean oil blend) on both sides and then grill them up in the George Forman until they start to get crispy and have toasty grill marks.  They're always a hit!

OMG this was so good.  It tasted just like Chili's southwestern egg roles.  The only modification i made was to bake them instead of frying them.  This recipe was a hit with my family, especially my husband.

I doubled the chicken, used 2 sweet red bell peppers, no spinach, removed seeds from jalapenos, used 1/2 tsp dried parsley, 1/4 tsp fresh ground cumin, no chili powder, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper,  mexican blend cheese
Kept the following ingredients the same: corn, black beans, green onions, salt, oil

Made about 12 egg rolls.  When wrapping, put an additional 1 tablespoon of cheese on wrapper and then filling. Use egg yolk to seal wrapping - no need for putting in the freezer if you are going to fry it the same day.

Served with cilantro cream sauce from this site.  Received RAVES!!!

Update: Use Chinese Egg Roll Wrappers

My mother is the queen of great Mexican food, and even she agreed these were absolutely delicious!  I also served with the cilantro cream sauce, adding a whole jalapeno to add spice.  AND- I used uncooked tortillas (found at Costco) which proved to be more pliable, crispier after baked, and held together without toothpicks.  TRY THESE- your family will love you!

Loved these! I did microwave the corn along with a few handfuls of chopped fresh spinach & drained before adding to the filling mixture. I doubled the recipe, not doubling the jalapeno peppers because I used pepperjack cheese. They were perfectly spicy. I do recommend FRYING these. Maybe I will try the baking method too, but really - just use around 1 to 1 1/2 inches of oil in a deep pan, turning once & drain on paper towels. They aren't too oily!

These egg rolls  have good flavor.  But what ever you do "DO NOT OVEN FRY THESE EGG ROLLS.  I make alot of egg rolls and I read a few reviews that said they cooked them in the oven. They are no good this way.  You are wasting your time unless you deep fry them. And Egg Roll Skins work the best.  Tortillas make it too doughy tasting.

These turned out wonderfully! I substituted an extra chicken breast for the black beans because my husband doesn't like beans and wilted/chopped fresh baby spinach leaves myself. I ended up with enough filling for 10 appetizer sized rolls.I also baked them like suggested in other reviews @ 475 for 15 minutes, brushed lightly with a mixture of olive oil and melted butter from a frozen state. They were delicious and I'll definitely make these again!!

Wal-Mart sells a "Southwestern Blend" of veggies with corn, black beans, green and red peppers, onions and tomatoes. I used a whole bag of that, a handful of frozen spinach, two 5 oz. cans of canned chicken breast, and doubled the seasonings. I ended up using about a cup of shredded colby/monterey jack cheese blend. I didn't have any jalapeños on hand, but I used a good tablespoon or so of Valentina's hot sauce. It made enough for about ten rolls. Then I rolled them up and browned three on the skillet with Pam  (to cut the fat) without freezing. WOW! What a result. I froze the other seven and will try them in the oven (spray with  cooking spray and bake on 475 for 15 minutes) as suggested. These were fantastic!

It's my 2nd time making these, and  
I use real egg roll wrappers and sliced advacado inside instead of the spinach. then garnished it with fresh salsa and sr cream, scallions, and black olives

Yummy.  I used egg roll rappers (thought tortillas would be too thick), and baked in oven as per other reviewers.  
Served with Ranch dressing mixed with some chili powder, to taste.

I love the taste of these egg rolls. I bought a package of Pictsweet brand authentic mexican seasoned corn and black beans (which had onions, red & green bell pepper already in it) in place of most of the veggies in this recipe. Absolutely great. I will not fry them the next time, even though it was great, just trying to cut fat as much as possible. I will definitely make this often.

Yummy! We used the suggestion to bake it at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. It tasted great! We omitted the jalopeno and bell peppers because we just don't like it. Next time we will add diced tomatoes. Thnaks for a great recipe!

This gets a solid 5 stars!! The only change I made is I substituted fresh cilantro for the fresh parsley - I would highly reccommend doing so. These are fabulous and so much cheaper than getting them at Chili's.

I made these vegetarian by omitting the chicken and adding extra red peppers, beans and yellow peppers.  I used tortillas and fried as stated though the next time I will try baking them after brushing with olive oil.  Cheesy and delicious.  I made a cilantro dipping sauce to dip the rolls into.

These are good!  I made a few changes like omitting the spinach, increasing the amount of chicken, adding about 1/2 can of Cambpell's pepper-jack cooking soup, and used pinto beans instead of the black beans.  I used large tortillas and cut them into small squares to make mini-rolls.  I sprayed the tops with non-stick cooking spray and baked them.  Turned out great and everyone loved them - great appetizer!

These are so good.  I varied the recipe a little by cooking the chicken in the crock pot all day because I like shredded chicken.  I also skipped the freezing step and baked the eggrolls instead of frying to make them more healthy.  I will be making these very often!!  Loved them!!

Delicious!!! I used won ton wrappers and baked the rolls in the oven using Butter flavored Pam. You need to turn them once or twice, and they browned up very nicely. After I made my first batch, I made another omitting the chicken....just as delicious! Followed advice from others and made Amy's Cilantro sauce (dip) too. A big hit during the super bowl!

These were really, really wonderful! Definitely going into my favorite recipe collection. I can see these would be perfect for the super bowl party!  I followed the recipe to the point of freezing the egg rolls. Once frozen, I tried deep-frying half of them and baking half of them. Both ways turned out great but we preferred the baked ones (they did get really crispy) because the fried ones were greasier (I think tortillas absorb more oil than regular egg roll wraps so perhaps better to make them with egg roll wraps if deep-praying). When frying the egg rolls, they also unrolled because I took the tooth picks out - resulting in funny looking egg rolls (but tasted fine still).

I order these all the time at restaurants because I love them so much, and these tase just as good, if not even better than the one's I've had prior to making these.  They are kind of a pain to prep, but well...well worth it!!  Can't wait to make them again!

Okay, these are more than wonderful. I've made a triple recipe twice in the past couple of weeks and can't wait to make them again. I added lots of cilantro, used egg roll wrappers, and sprayed them with olive oil cooking spray and baked them at 450. Oh, how I love these! I, too, made Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce to go with them. The best!

These are hands down far better than any restaurant verison I have had.  I made a quadriple batch so I always have a few in the freezer to cook when wanted.  I bake make at 425 for 15-20 minutes just because I don't like dealing with the mess of deep frying.  I made half of mine out of corn tortillas because they come out really crisp.  But be warned, corn tortillas are harder to shape and work with.

This recipe was fantastic.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I made this with eggroll wrappers (so easy), cilantro instead of parsley, and cooked at 425 for about 25 minutes.  I also served it with a sour cream wasabi dipping sauce.  Will make again and again.

These are great! I've use both cilantro and parsley (for those picky ones who hate cilantro) and both are good but the cilantro was my favorite. After rolling in the small tortillas I skip the toothpicks but instead I wrap each individually very tightly in plastic wrap twisting the ends like sausage casings before freezing. It's an extra step but you can ignore the toothpicks and they hold together nice and tightly when frying and look perfect.

WOW! Great flavor! I used egg-roll wrappers, as suggested by others, tripled the recipe, shredded the chicken, and added about a cup of rice I had leftover in the fridge. I sprayed them with butter-flavored cooking spray and baked them at 425 for about half an hour--it took that long for them to brown.  I also tried a few rolled in corn tortillas--really good! Served with sour cream/salsa mixture. Friends said this was "phenomenal." Thanks so much for this tasty recipe!

WOW!  These came out just like Chili's Southwestern Eggrolls.  I tripled the recipe and used 20 wonton wrappers.  I froze them as directed and they fried up perfectly.  Served to my Bunco group with salsa mixed into ranch dressing and they were very impressed.

I added spicy fat free refried beans when I made them and also quickened the recipe by using a taco seasoning (fiesta party Tastefully Simple) but any taco seasoning would work. I also made ground beef ones. Any meat would probably work. My family loved them and I have had several requests for the recipe from friends. I also baked the eggrolls instead of deep frying for a healthy alternative.

I tried this with wonton wrappers & didn't have very good luck.  I think taking the extra step with the tortillas is a must.  Served these with a spicy ranch dressing dip.  Great recipe.

I used a can of chile peppers instead of spinach and jalapenos and used 2 chicken breasts instead of 1.  The mixture itself is VERY good and will make this part again but deep fried...it seems to lose some of its taste and the flour tortillas seem to retain a little too much grease for my taste. The end result is similar to a chimichanga. Still, they're good and could be made into a main meal with some rice. However, I might try baking this or just use this as taco filling and skip the freezing/deep fry steps.

Did not change recipe. I've made this 5 times and have been using egg white to moisten edge as I wrap it. works better than a toothpick.  I also individually wrap in plastic wrap to hold tortilla edge tight so egg white sets. I freeze them with the plastic wrap on .  I also triple the recipe and keep them in freezer until I need a great appetizer quickly.

This is yummy! I used 1 Gardein (vegan) scallopini cutlet and some other minor substitutions based on family preferences, baked them (with ends tucked in), and served with avocado slices and Cilantro Cream sauce. Makes 2 large tortillas.

These were fantastic. My husband can't get enough. I used flour tortillas instead and baked them at 400 degrees for a healthier alternative.

Amazingly good!  I baked them for 10 minutes instead of frying them, and they came out great!  I ended up making a larger batch the next time I made them, so they were more burrito-sized than finger food sized.   Great recipe!

Doubled this recipe for a small party and there were no leftovers!  Wonderful flavors and very similiar to those at Chili's!  I chose to bake instead of frying and they were still wonderful.  Bake at 425 so the tortillas crisp up a little.  I will make these again and again and most likely triple the recipe next time!  Thank you!

Made this for football food. Big hit! I baked them instead of frying at 450 for 10 as another reviewer suggested and they were perfect. Big hit and easy to do!

I doubled this and did not freeze ahead of time.  Next time I will freeze because this made 15 burritos and I still had filling left for two or three but I was out of tortillas.  I made cilantro cream sauce to go with this and was very impressed.  I will have lunch for a week.

YUM YUM! - if I could sum this recipe up. The one thing I liked from the Chili's restaurant were the southwestern egg rolls. Since I don't live anywhere near it, this recipe definitely satisfied my craving! I scaled down this recipe and it still felt like a lot of filling! I had egg roll wrappers on hand so I went ahead and used those in place of the tortillas. However, either or tastes great! The egg roll wrappers gave me that crispiness that I was wanting. It was served along side some avocado-sour cream puree concoction that I put together. I had some egg rolls left over that I warmed up the next day. The crisp from the wrappers was lost which of course was a bummer- so I recommend eating this same day. Definitely will be making this again and again regardless!

These were delicious. We grilled some corn on the cob and used that instead of frozen. We skipped the spinach (didn't have any on hand)  and didn't freeze them. We also baked them in the oven instead of frying in oil. We will definitely make these again.

Definitely a 5-star recipe and just like the ones at chili's!  These were amazing & everyone loved them! I tripled the ingredients & used three chicken breasts to make sure I'd have enough for everyone to try and have some extras in case anyone wanted another one (by doing this i ended up with about 12 eggrolls) - good thing - because they went fast!! I chopped up/minced a sweet onion instead of green onion & chopped up fresh baby spinach instead of using frozen. I also omitted the cayenne pepper since we didn't have any and some don't care for things very spicy anyway. I used shredded Colby jack cheese since that was all I could find at the store and used the flour tortillas.  I made some as the fried version & some as the baked version and both were excellent! Fyi-I also omitted freezing them before cooking them and they stayed together just fine - just used a toothpick to keep them together while cooking them, then take the toothpicks out before serving them. For the dipping sauce I made a guacamole dip (using a packet from the store & fresh avocados) and then added sour cream and some ranch dressing. It turned out really good! Everyone loved the eggrolls (and the sauce), even those that don't like things too spicy, so they had just enough of a 'southwest' kick without going overboard. Will definitely be making these again, I just wish it had made even more the first time so that I could have had some to freeze for next time :)

I've made this many times. I use egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas. I also refrigerate the filling before stuffing the wrappers and then pop the filled rolls into the freezer before frying. It helps to keep them together and frying evenly.

Perfection as is! (Don't you love when that happens?) I used carrots instead of red pepper for the kiddies and they flew off the table. Baked at 425 instead of frying and they were still crispy.

I made the recipe to the t last time. I thought it was not spicy enough for my family so I added some more cayenne. My very picky adult daughter did not like the taste of the spinach so I used fresh spinach which seemed to fix the complaint the second time. Also I used boneless skinless thighs since I had them. I added a little garlic powder. Its summer here now so I didn't want to fry these. So I did not freeze them instead I brushed oil both top and bottom and baked them at 375 for about 20 minutes till brown on the bottom and then broiled them till tops were brown. I also think calorie conscience could easily cut down on the cheese. Maybe even omit it because the filling is so good which I will experiment with next time. I made a  different sauce. I had some left over chipolte and took some sour cream, lime, garlic powder, a pinch of salt and blended well. It added a lot. Guacamole is great. Plain greek yogurt, or salsa all would be great. SO basically just add or take away to your tastes and make your favorite sauce and enjoy. Great basic recipe.

The whole family really liked these. The only thing I don't like about the recipe is it uses such small amounts of some of the ingredients, leaving you with leftovers to use up, and I happen to be horrible at that! So the next time I used 2 large chicken breasts, the whole can of black beans, 1/2 of a large red bell pepper, 1c. corn, 1 bunch of gr. onions, 2 cups pepper jack cheese, and the whole 10oz pkg. frozen spinach. I adjusted the rest of the ingredients/spices accordingly (this amount makes at least 20 egg rolls). Instead of sauteing the chicken and then everything else, I sprinkled taco seasoning and spread salsa on the chicken and baked at 375* for 30 min. Meanwhile, I sauted the bell pepper, then added the spices and everything else except the chicken and cheese. When the chicken was cooked I chopped it finely and just mixed with everything else in a large bowl, along with the cheese. I baked the egg rolls at 450* for 10 min. turned them over and baked another 10 till they were finally golden and at least somewhat crispy. Served it with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce. So good!

I have made this recipe so many times and my husband and I love them!  I made these once with the egg roll wrappers, but now I always make them with tortillas and bake them I prefer to make them a little healthier and they still taste great!  I also make a dip sometimes to go with them - just put cilantro, avocado, ranch sauce packet (dry) and sour cream or yogurt and blend in a food processor.

Amazing, slight modifications: no spinach, used green chiles instead of peppers.  I also doubled recipe but only used 1/2 cheese. I sprayed these with Pam and baked at 450 x 10 min.  Can't recommend this recipe enough!

I used 1 lb ground chicken instead of a breast. I added 2 cups of cheese because that is what my family likes. Cut down on spinach and added more beans. I also baked instead of fried because I didn't want to waste the oil if I didn't have to. 350 for about 20 minutes was perfect after I sprayed them with PAM and sprinkled with paprika and cilantro. Very nice! Mine came out more like burritos, but that was fine. If I want the egg-roll type thing, I will buy egg-roll wrappers next time.

I work for the chain that serves these DELICIOUS eggrolls, & I have to say that after a couple of (small) additions, they taste like a copycat recipe!!!  They are absolutely wonderful!!!  I would definitely recommend using the eggroll wrappers vs. the tortillas though.   I would also recommend using a rotisserie chicken, finely chopped/shredded, and adding a "good" amount of Liquid smoke.  The restaurant's recipe uses smoked chicken & using the liquid smoke certainly gives it the smoky flavor, & more flavor!  I did spray them well with cooking spray, & baked them @ 450 for about 20-25 min to achieve a good crisp!  I would HIGHLY recommend to (atleast) triple the recipe, as they are AWESOME, and you will wish that you had more!!!!

So very yummy. I've made this several times now. I always use egg roll wrappers. My neighbors even loved them and I shared the recipe

Yummy, I rolled them up and baked them as well and they were wonderful (had to help the fat/calorie count as well) Now I need to find a dip to go with it...

These were a hit at my Cinco de Mayo potluck. The only changes I made was omit the jalapeno peppers and changed the monterey jack cheese for pepper jack cheese. I am asian, so I opted for the traditional eggroll wrappers over the tortillas. My only mistake was not doubling the recipe as it went quickly. Thank you!

Amazing.  Everyone loved!  I cooked chicken, had ALL other ingredients in one bowl, removed chicken, placed all ingredients in pan and cooked then added chopped chicken, keep it simple it won't be a pain.  Used tortillas placed tight in a baking dish on parchment paper and baked 10 min at 450.  Shells stayed crunchy but soft, very good.

Yummy! These are not difficult to make, but I did a few substitutions to accommodate what I had on hand. Used fresh spinach rather than frozen, forgot the parsley and didn't freeze them, just fried them right away for maybe 2 minutes each. The only thing that was really different for me is that it took closer to 40 minutes for me from start to finish. Definitely plan to make these again- only will likely double the recipe. This recipe only made 8 eggrolls using homemade-style 6 inch tortillas.

Okay this is seriously delicious!  We're eating them right now.  We made them with both the tortillas and egg roll wrappers and the egg roll wrappers were better but the others were very, very good too.  We served these with Amy's Cilantro Sauce from this site and it's delicious and perfect with these egg rolls.  We also baked them and them came out nice and crispy.  I will definitely be making these again!

These are great. I first made them exactly as posted but over time have adjusted to my preference, and to make it easier :) I usually leave out chicken and double most of the veggies. I also bake them instead of frying, about 20 mintues at 350. They are awesome fried but the process can be messy, I think they are just as good baked and of course healthier.  My sauce of choice is raspberry chipotle, YUM! These are a hit with anyone. And if you're cooking for one or two, you can always freeze extras for another time.

I heated them in the oven for 10 mins at 450.  PERFECT!  I used egg roll wrappers.  These were beyond good.  I served with creamed spinach to use up my spinach.

Just made these for dinner tonight, and they were awesome! Only thing I did different was use fresh spinach, whole wheat tortillas and baked them on 450 for 10 minutes. I also served them with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce (on this site). Gotta try this recipe, thanks for posting!!

These are soooo good!  I always make a bunch of these at a time since it involves alot of prep work. I use my stovetop veggie steamer to get the tortillas moist and flexible.  The steam makes them a little sticky which helps alot when you are rolling them up. I don't have to use as many toothpicks that way. Also, then I don't have to freeze them.  (The first time I made these I froze them and the middle never got hot enough. ) Now they come out perfect! This is one of my favorite recipes!

So good! I used eggroll wrappers instead of tortillas and did not have to freeze before frying them.  I also served it with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce from this site.  The sauce was 100% better when served warm with the eggrolls.

I didn't change this recipe much. I used all the same ingredients, just added some garlic, a small pablano pepper and extra spinach and I substituted Cilantro for Parsley.  To make it easier on myself I chopped up the chicken and cooked it then added the onion and so on... instead of cooking a whole chicken breast removing it then chopping it, much faster and easier.  I also did NOT fry these! Turn the oven to 450 and bake for 10-15 minutes they turn out crispy and delish! Yum!

These are SOOOOOOO AWESOME!!! I've made them for parties, and just for the family at home and they are ALWAYS a hit! So delicious- I always make with the creamy cilantro sauce. No changes needed to the recipe, I sometimes make it a day or two in advance and keep it in the freezer until I'm ready to fry them. Some other reviewers said that they use egg roll wrappers, but i find that the raw flour tortillas work great! I highly recommend this recipe!

This is one of my favorite meals!  I always double it and keep some in the freezer for a quick dinner.  I usually use 1/2 the jalapenos and some green chilies and substitute fresh cilantro for the parsley.  Goes great with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce!

Fantastic! We served this to company and it is absolutely great.  No need to make any changes or adjustments to recipe.  I'm thinking of making a couple of batches and keeping them in the freezer!

These are simple delicious, perfect for freezing. Now I tried the filling before adding the cheese and I think that next time I will cut on the cheese. It might have been that I used 2% or that I used Colby and Monterrey but I felt that the cheese overshadowed some of the other flavors. Also, I had no jalapeno and no red cayenne pepper so I added more cumin and red chili.  I didn't fry them, I sprayed them with Pam and baked them at 450.

These are SO good, and I didn't even fry them (and I'm sure they are even better fried).  Just baked them in the oven (with a little oil rubbed on the tortillas) until crisp.  The filling is very good.  I usually make these when I have leftover creamed spinach.

Wow!!!  These are awesome!  We didn't deep fry them as originally suggested and they came out delicious!  We also substituted the parsley with cilantro one night and it was even better! Mmm, this is definately a recipe you'll make over and over again :)

I went with a couple other reviews that said to use egg roll wraps and canned chicken and bake it. Canned chicken & baking - yes. Egg roll wraps - no. Wonderful mixture though. I left out the jalapeno, chili and cayenne pepper since we're not fans of spicy and it was still VERY GOOD. I will definitely make this again.

These are delicious! We have served these at 3 different parties so far and they always go fast! I even triple the recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. It's nice to have a helper when making these because I manage to make quite a mess! I would recommend heating up the tortillas one or two at a time. They stated to tear when we were rolling them up if they dried out or cooled off too much.

I made these for an early Cinco de Mayo party this weekend and there wasn't a single one left.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and tripled the ingredients, used egg roll wrappers, and baked them for 25 minutes covered, then an additional 15 uncovered.  I also deleted the chicken, as I was serving w/chicken tacos and didn't want an overload.  Our guests loved these - will definitely make again.

Delicious! This was seasoned perfectly. The only change i made was using  egg roll wrapers instead of tortillas. Tortillas just seemed like it would be to thick and hard to work with. Serve this with AR's Amy's cilantro cream sauce. It was sooo good!

This was very tasty! Just like Chili's! I did bake mine at 450 for 15 min and i brushed the top of them with oil and covered before putting them in the oven. Came out great and my friend's loved them! For the dip I mashed avocado, added ranch dressing and some diced tomato - it was perfect with the rolls - Gotta try this one people!

Very good; followed the recipe except used minced dry onion flakes which I simmered into the bell pepper; I also baked mine on an oiled pan, sprayed some cooking oil on top and baked at 425 for 17 minutes...  YUM!  Served with sour cream with some lime juice, cilantro and chives.  :O)

I made this recipe for our Super Bowl party and it was a huge hit! I used the uncooked flour tortillas from Costco which made them much easier to roll and they tasted delicious after freezing and deep frying them.  I tripled the recipe and used an entire can of black beans and drained canned corn.  I also used drained canned spinach.  I served with Hidden Valley Buttermilk Ranch (mix can be found at grocery stores) with avacado mixed into the ranch. I am looking forward to making these again and will probably leave some extras in the freezer to fry up when I want to eat them.

This was fantastic! I made a few minor changes after reading some of the other reviews. I did not freeze. Baked at 425 for about 20 minutes and they were perfectly crispy without the greasy feel of a fried food. I did not use the onion or bell pepper. I sauteed the chicken breast in garlic and olive oil before slicing. I used 4 cups of fresh spinach, 1/2 cup of sun dried tomatoes. I used a whole can of corn and an entire can of black beans. I used cayenne pepper instead of cumin and no salt. I will definitely make this again.

I made these for New Year's Eve appetizers and they were fantastic!  I didn't have time to freeze them, so they were a little difficult to fry, but that wasn't a huge deal.  They taste very close to the version that's served at Chili's restaurants.  I duplicated the avocado ranch dip that Chili's serves with them by mashing an avocado and mixing it with about 1/2-3/4 cup of homemade ranch dip.  I ended up with enough filling for 7 egg rolls instead of just 5.  Good thing, because everyone gobbled these down!  Since it's a lot of work preparing the filling, I think I'm going to make up a bunch of these to keep in the freezer so I can fry up a few whenever we want them.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I fixed these as an appetizer (the baked version) for our dinner group with the recommended Cilantro Cream Sauce and they were a big hit - everyone wanted the recipes!  Save time by using roasted chicken (from Sam's Club) - great flavor!

BAKE THESE! No need to deep fry, I am glad i listened to all of you, 450 for 15 minutes. I sprayed the bottom of a cookie sheet with Pam, placed eggrolls on top then sprayed the tops of the eggrolls, both sides were crispy and browned. Quadrupled the recipe and it made 18 rolls with 1/3rd cup of filling in each. I also kept the spinach and it was yummy. Didnt have a red bell pepper so i used roasted red peppers from a jar, delicious. Also took the advice and used a can of diced green chiles instead of the jalapenos, family of 5 here loved it, even the 9 year old!

YES! These are AWESOME!! We baked them instead of frying and they are super. The cilantro sauce that everyone recommends goes perfectly with these as well. These are already a favorite in our house. Thank you SO much!

My husband made these as his second foray into sharing the dinner duties.  What a great job he did; these  were fantastic. He followed another reviewers suggestion to bake instead of fry - great great great. The sauce was fabulous.

We love these! I like them with shredded chicken and to save time have used a rotisserie chicken. I usually make a lot and freeze them without baking so we have them on hand for whenever we want to throw them in the oven.

These are a family favorite and I've made them (by popular request) many times.  The recipe can be tweaked in many ways, and there are even short-cuts.  For instance, I've used the "Mexicorn" cans before when running short of prep time.  They turned out just great.  I must say that I've never fried these - I always always bake them.  They come out with a great crispiness but without the unnecessary added fats by frying.  A definite keeper.

It's very yummy! I recommend using uncooked flour tortillas. Just make sure you run them under warm water before trying to wrap them. They are not pliable straight out of the fridge. The water will make them pliable and sticky so the burrito will not come apart when you try to fry it. Uncooked tortillas also fry up better then cooked.

My DH swore with his first bite, I thought maybe he bit his tongue-  but no. You know how profanities can slip out in a moment of bliss. Im not kidding, this may have been one of the best dinners I ever cooked. I used soft taco size tortillas (made 6 eggrolls) and served with a lowfat sauce (1 c plain yogurt, dashes of garlic powder, salt, pepper, tbl ranch, tbl mayo, chopped cilantro). Baking was a delicious way to cook these, and I don't think anything was lost except fat. These were just amazing. Had carrot sticks on the side since the sauce was so delicious.

Our family loves these.  The only change I made was to bake instead of frying.  We always double the mixture and make them into burrito size instead of appetizer size.  We like Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce with these.

I made these eggrolls pretty quickly in the morning before work. I forgot to defrost chicken so I doubled the beans.  I also added corn. I also used egg roll wrappers instead of tortilla's.  These were great and tasted wonderful with your basic ranch dressing.

great recipe. I used egg roll wrappers and chilled them in the freezer for about an hour and they came out great! I boiled chicken breasts until tender (I was careful not to over cook these) and after they cooled a bit, I diced the chicken and seasoned with a dry Jamaican Jerk rub type seasoning and left in the refrigerator for while as I went about preparing the other ingredients...when I had everything ready to go I esseintially stirred fried the chicken in the skillet, added everything but the cheese and transferred to a bowl where I added slowly mixed in the cheese. I filled the egg roll wrappers and sealed with an egg and water wash and they set up nicely in the freezer and fried perfectly in a deep fryer. I barely had put the diagonal cut on these before my poker buddies devoured them!

The one word that comes to mind is YUM. But it isn't enough. This is a really good recipe. The hint about freezing is a MUST. I tried without and it did not work. Follow this recipe EXACTLY and it will be worth it, I promise.

I did not fry the rolls, instead I baked at 350 for 20 minutes covered in foil.  I removed the foil and baked for another 10 minutes.  These are absolutely delicious.  I made some with the cheese and some without because my husband is lactose intolerant and he loved them.

Absolutely delish! I've been wanting to try this for a couple of years and never seemed to get the chance. I used olive oil due to preference and substituted cilantro for the parsley since I had cilantro on hand for the dip (Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce this site)and used colby jack instead of plain jack cheese. I wanted to try them deep fried and they were wonderful but I will probably bake next time just because it's healthier. Great recipe; thank you.

I went with the suggestions to triple the recipe, using eggroll wraps, and baking them. It was a HUGE success.  The other changes I made were to leave out the spinach and to marinate & grill the chicken.

Absolutely fantastic! 
I just made these for dinner tonight along with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce. Whoever first came up with the idea to combine those two recipes I have to give you a pat on the back and thanks! 

I used egg roll wrappers because I had some leftover from an Asian meal I cooked last week. Plus I feel like if I had used the flour tortillas it'd be chimichangas and not egg rolls. I also brushed a bit of water on the egg rolls to seal the seams so that they wouldn't come apart while frying. 

I made a few variations, but not much. 
Instead of dicing the chicken after it was cooked, I shredded it using the 2 fork method. The chicken goes a lot farther this way.

Instead of parsley I used cilantro. I also used diced chiles instead of a jalapeno. I also minced a small clove of garlic. The best change I think I did was that I used a tablespoon of the adobo sauce from the chipotles that I had. For once, I didnt actually add a chipotle pepper but I probably will next time. As far as cheese, Sargento has a Chipotle blend that goes great with this. I didn't freeze them and they cooked rather quickly when i fried them. They came out perfectly. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

My family loves this recipe.  I have altered it a bit.  I only pan fry just to get the outside golden brown, and finish in the oven.  A majority of the remaining oil comes out and they are just as delicious.  Fast, easy, somewhat healthy and with a salad, is a full meal.  A keeper for our family!

Great for something different! I paired it with Raspberry Inferno Sauce from this site & everyone loved these. Very easy to change up. Made a few with no beans, for a friend who HATES beans. Next doing a few w/o chicken for my vegan nephew. Different color toothpicks make it easy to tell them apart. Also I use eggroll wrappers, they crisp up beautifully!

These tasted great! I cooked my chicken in a crockpot with beer, and used canned diced jalapenos instead of fresh... Added Excellent flavor and lots of spice! I did not use tortillas, I used spring roll wrappers.. They were great! Light and crispy, but not greasy!

This recipe was awesome! I omitted the spinach and added onions and minced garlic because I didnt have the green onions. Came out delicious! Only reason I give it 4 stars is the frying time. I fryed it in my deep fryer and almost burned the shell. It came out dark brown after frying at 375degree after only 6 mins. I think next time i'll just fry it for 3-4 mins and it should be perfect! Will keep this as one of my favorite recipes. Actually tastes just like the tex mex egg rolls at CF.

I agree with everyone else, these egg rolls are awesome!  I used the raw tortillas that you can find in Costco, or Walmart with the Mexican cheeses.  They were really easy to roll nice and tight in the raw tortilla.  The first one I fried started to unroll as the dough cooked and expanded, so each one from there got a toothpick to keep the dough together.  That worked great.  They were a hit at our party and will be made again for sure!  **A couple substitutions - cilantro instead of parsley, canned green chiles instead of jalapeno pepper, and taco flavored cheese.  Also, I have a 6-month old, so I have to time things carefully.  I made the filling in the morning, then put it in the fridge (never froze it).  At noon, I rolled all the tortillas and put them back in the fridge until I was ready to fry them that night.

Delicious! I made a vegetarian version by omitting the chicken and doubling the veggies.  The filling is so good that I am going to try it with enchiladas or soft tacos.  I lightly pan fried the egg rolls and didn't miss the deep fry at all. As others suggested, I served with the "Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce" recipe from this site - this sauce really compliments the egg rolls.

Had a few people over these went great with my Mexican theme of skewered beef fajitas, jalapeno poppers and salsa and chips.  Made mojitos magarita style (crushed ice).  Only 8 people and everything disappeared (I even doubled this egg roll recipe).  For the dip, I just bought a bottle of Hidden Valley Ranch buttermilk dressing and put in some chopped red and green bell peppers just to make it pretty.

This is a great basic recipe that you can jazz up to fit your tastes. I used what I had on hand, left over bbq chicken, onion and a tablespoon of Taco Seasoning, and added some extra heat with a little bit of hot salsa. I used more black beans and frozen corn than the recipe called for because I like them! I rolled the filling in tortilla shells and froze them for an hour, then in the fridge for a couple of hours. I baked them off at 400 for 20 minutes, then the last 10 minutes at 425 and sprinkled some cheese on the last 5 minutes. My hubby thought they tasted just like the restaurants!! I will be making these again! Thanks so much for sharing!

I doubled this recipe and made half with eggroll wrappers and the other half with tortilla's, but fried all of them.  Next time, will do what others have suggested and use the tortilla's and bake them.  These fell apart, once they hit the oil...don't get me wrong...we still ate them!  The inside's are JUST LIKE the one's at Chili's.  Even one of my son's won't eat the ones at Chili's, but ate 3 of mine!!!  SUCCESS!  Thanks for the recipe!

wow!  These are worth the work!  I actually tripled the recipe and made a dozen egg rolls.  I substituted cilantro for the parsley (I had the cilantro in the fridge cause I made the Cilantro Cream sauce for dipping).  I used egg roll wrappers and deep fried them.  They didnt take nearly as long to fry but it may have been because my oil could be too hot.  Didnt effect the incredible taste!  I cant wait to serve these to my Bunco group!  :-)

Perfect just the way they are.  I made no changes to this recipe.  I make alot at one time and freeze them.  Cook at 450 for 15-20 minutes. Delish!!

To make it healthier, I decided to bake it in the oven instead of frying it, which made the flour tortillas too thick to manage.  Instead, I used 2 layers of spring roll wrappers.  This made the rolls nice crispy and flaky.  Served them with a homemade salsa and sour cream.  And yes, they do indeed freeze and reheat well!

The title and photo of this recipe led me to believe that it was an appetizer, but when I made this for my husband and I, they were more of a main dish. We could each only eat 2 or 3 because they were larger than I expected. (I used Gordita tortillas, which may be slightly larger than 6" but was still able to make 5 from the original recipe.) The only thing that tasted a little out of place was the tiny amount of spinach in this recipe, I could take it or leave it.

We quadrupled this recipe for a large party. It was a hit, everyone loved it. We baked instead of fried. I used a can of diced green chiles instead of jalapenos, because I didn't have any.
We made some with flour tortillas and some with egg roll wrappers. We liked the egg roll wrappers better.  It was a bit of work to chop up and prepare the filling, but it's great that they can be assembled far in advance and kept in the freezer until ready to be cooked and served.

I make this recipe too much, it is great.  I bake them, like many others have stated, and I also change the proportions a little.  I make 3x the veggies and 2x the chicken, that seems to make a double batch for me.  mmmmmmmmm, I got to go make some now.

These were a huge hit at the New Year's party.  People said these could be a signature dish that everyone always hopes I bring to gatherings.  Baking was great- I went with 450 for 12 minutes with a turn in the middle.  When you do it, make sure they are wrapped tightly and place them on top of the fold or they will come undone and the tips of the tortilla get too crispy.  I also added green chiles- awesome.

We followed the recipe exactly except for we grilled the chicken rather than sauteeing.  Because we used the tortillas, the end product looked kind of clumbsy, but tasted great.  Restaurant quality flavor.  A lot of work to make, though, with all the fine chopping...then again, we tripled the recipe.  We served them at a holiday party with the Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce from this site and they were the hit of the party, none left and I was told that this would be the thing that I would have to bring from now on.  I might try wrapping them in egg roll wrappers the next time for more of a sophisticated restaurant look.

Great! Taste just like the ones at Chili's except a little less spicy. I recommend deep frying them at 350 F instead of 375 F to cook throughoutly without burning.

I made these for the boys birthday party and everyone claimed it was the best dish. I used egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas. I make asian egg rolls all the time, so when wrapping these egg rolls, I wrapped them tightly too. However, you shouldn't do that because the filling for this recipe contains more juice from the vegetables. If you do, it'll tear the wrappers. Finally, for the dip, I just combined sour cream with salsa topped off with sliced green onions.

I served these with mexican rice and they were great for dinner.  I have made them twice and the first time I used egg roll wrappers and they turned out just okay.  The second time a used flour tortillas and they were much better.  They also freeze well, too.

These were so good.  I did make some changes to suit my tastes.  I am a vegetarian, so I didn't add the chicken. I did double the veggies and the cheese and used cheddar and a fiesta cheese blend.  I made some with flour tortillas and some with corn.  I think I liked the corn a little better.  They had more crunch, but they were both good.  I didn't freeze them, and it didn't seem to matter.  I baked them at 450 for about 15 minutes.  I will definetly make them again.  I felt they needed a dipping sauce and used what I had on hand, ranch dressing with a little taco seasoning mixed in.  It was pretty good. Maybe next time I will try the avocado dip or the cilantro dip others mentioned.

Just like the ones at Chili's Restaurant!  I made a huge batch (8 times) and froze them.  Excellent with ranch dressing.  Really good baked. No need to deep fry these and I left out the oil to prepare the chicken.  I poached it to keep the fat content down also.

This was a huge hit but I did make some minor changes.  I substituted plenty of cilantro for the parsley and I placed the stuffing into fried corn tortillas which I rolled and pinned with a toothpick.  I then baked them long enough to heat through and set the tortilla so it wouldn't unwind.  We call them Southwestern Taquitos at our house and everyone raves about them.  I serve them as a main course with Mexican rice, pinto beans and a green salad.  They were also a big hit at our Superbowl party.

This was a big success for a dinner party we had over the weekend.  Everyone LOVED it -  I followed the directions exactly.  The only thing that threw me off was the cooking time.  First of all I used a Daddy Deep Fryer, but I only fried them for 5 minutes.  The outsides looked a little bit browner then I like for them to look, but they did not taste at all over cooked or burnt.  If I fried them for less time then the inside was still frozen.  Anyway, besides my frying time varying ~  These little appetizers are wonderful!  Next time I will make a double batch and freeze them!

This recipe was great! Relatively easy and very impressive looking. I baked the Rolls until they were a little crispy and warm- instead of frying them. They turned out perfect. Probably not as good but still yummy!

I've made these twice in the last two weeks because they are now on high demand in my house.  I chop everything and throw it in my skillet as directed but I use a can of chicken to save time and can't tell any difference. Absolutely the best...

Yum!  Changes made:
doubled chicken and cooked with salt and pepper; whole wheat tortillas; chopped instead of minced everything; canned instead of frozen corn; kidney beans not black beans;  cilantro not parsley; a little less chopped pepper;  no cayenne pepper; shredded cheddar and white cheese; 

  Changes to try:  slice chicken breasts in half to cook quicker; use food processor for quick mincing; less corn but more spinach and other veggies; use lots of pepper (was afraid of it before but it's bland without it); go a little easier on the salt, it's easy to oversalt this!  Want to try microwaving them but not sure how to prevent them from drying out-- maybe a wet paper towel and try for 2 minutes on high

I have made these for a few years now--they always outshine everything else at a party.  Be prepared for many recipe requests.  I follow Jackie's recipe except I omit the red peppers and the jalapenos.  I double it, too, so I can stock my freezer with them.

These were given top rating at our super bowl party.  I added cilantro to the chicken mixture.  Also, I didn't want the mess of frying, so I brushed them with butter and baked them at 350 until they were nice and golden.  Also, I used ~1 1/c of blcak beans and ~1 c of corn.  YUMMM!!

Oh, I thought these were AWESOME!! I did tweak it a bit myself...I used egg roll wrappers, sprayed them with Pam, and baked them. I took them to a Bible study and they got eaten so quickly that some folks didn't get one. I doubled the recipe...will have to at least quadruple it next time...it's that good :)

These are the best.  I use regular eggroll wrappers (use water on the edges to seal them)and Pepper Jack Cheese. Make them a bit smaller for easier eating. Fry them immediately instead of freezing. Awesome!

DELICIOUS!  My only change was to use egg roll wrappers.  I started using tortillas and they were falling apart.  I stopped midstream - unrolled all of the tortillas - and went to the store to pick up egg roll wrappers.  So much easier and no need for toothpicks!

I made these Southwestern Egg Rolls the center of a Southwestern Themed Christmas Eve dinner.  Everyone loved them and I have made extra to cook up later.  I added a bit more spinach and the kids didn't even know it was in there ! I did make a fresh Pico de'Gallo and boneless Buffalo Chicken to go with it.  Made some dips as well.  It was a big hit .. Thank You !

The family loved these. Even my 1 and 2 year old sons. We used egg roll wrappers as suggested by other reviewers and did not freeze. I also used leftover turkey instead of chicken. Served with the cilantro cream sauce. My husband is already asking for these again.

These were fantastic!  I made them for a party (omitting the chicken to make them vegetarian) and everyone LOVED them.  Serve them with fresh salsa or salsa con queso for a real crowd-pleaser :-)

These are great!!!! I tried flour tortillas and lumpia wrapers (thin egg roll wrapper.  you can find it in the oriental stores).  They were best with the lumpia wrapper. They were actually alot better.  Great recipe for today.  I made a test run and my husband loved it.  Great recipe.   I made it with the avacado ranch dip and subbed cilantro for parsley.

Unbelievably good! I made these with some substitutions: cilantro, corn, smashed pinto beans, & Mexican cheese blend (instead of parsley, spinach, & Monterey Jack), then wrapped mixture in a variety of Asian food wrappers (wonton, egg roll, potsticker) before deep-frying. Also used puff pastry sheets once & baked. Always works out great, with any wrap & with or without freezing first. Served with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce from this site & they disappeared in moments. Thanks, Jackie!

These deserve more than 5 stars. I took them to a cookout and they were gone in a minute.I did add pepper jack cheese in place of part of the cheese that it called for.I used egg roll wraps and baked @ 425 for 20 minutes.YUM YUM

Great recipe I also used cilantro instead of parsely.  Had the oil too hot for the first one so I had to remove it from the oil quickly, I finished it off in the microwave for 1 minute and it turned out fine.  Adjusted the oil temperature and they came out picture perfect. I am going to try changing the recipe a bit and make chimmichangas and beef and cheese burritos.  Nice to have fresh homemade items on hand in the freezer!

AWESOME! My husband has asked for these everyday for three days in a row after I made then for a party. Everyone forot the other dishes I prepared and gobbled these up quickly. My husband even makes them himself; adding his own twist. That's a lot for a man who doesn't do much cooking. When I first made these I followed the recipe and the measurements exact, but now I just throw the ingredients together and it still comes out great.

AWESOME!  I doubled the recipe as I had rather a large crowd to feed but I should have tripled or quadrupled it.  They were the first thing to go!  I used the Tyson pre-cooked chicken breasts to save a little time.  I wrapped them up individually as another reader suggested (without the toothpicks) but some of the ends came unraveled during cooking so I will make sure to not skip that step in the future.  I mashed up a couple of fresh avocados and blended them with some Ranch buttermilk dressing for the dipping sauce!

This was a really good recipe...I tried it 3 ways. I baked some using eggroll wrappers, baked some using tortillas and deep fried some using eggroll wrappers. I liked the deep fried ones and the baked tortilla ones the best. The baked eggroll ones tasted fine but did not look that appetizing. I did not try deep frying the tortillas, but maybe I will try that next. I did serve them with Amy's cilantro dip which is divine. Thank you for sharing!!

THESE ARE SOOOO GOOD. THEY TASTE JUST LIKE CHILI'S. I TRIED 1/2 WITH THE FLOUR TORTILLAS AND THE OTHER WITH EGG ROLL WRAPPERS.THEY WERE BOTH REALLY GOOD. I USED RANCH AVOCADO DIP JUST LIKE AT CHILI'S.  JUST TAKE AN AVOCADO BLEND IT WITH BUTTERMILK RANCH DRESSING, AND VOILA. IT WAS SO GOOD, THE WHOLE FAMILY ENJOYED IT.

This recipe is awesome! Very close to the southwest egg rolls served at chillis! My husband and I love these & plan to make them again! We didn't have time to freeze them except for maybe an hour but, they still turned out great! We even made extra, mixed in some extra cheese and some refried beans & used it as a dip for chips. It was great!!!

The filling is out of this world!! I used both tortillas and eggroll wrappers.  Freezing the eggroll wrappers wasn't the greatest idea because they are so fragile and can stick together.  I fried some and baked some.  We really like the the fried ones, tasted just like a restaurant, the baked ones weren't as fluffy but a little more heathly.  The totillas were also good a little thicker but still very enjoyable.  Either way you do it...these are just wonderful!!!!!!! Thanks:)

This took lots of prep work, but went together pretty quickly once all the ingredients were chopped.  We loved this appetizer. Tastes a lot like Chile's southwestern eggrolls.

These are really excellent, even when they're just baked in the oven.  The only problem is that they take a little effort... try to get a partner to help you with the chopping and the rolling, and it might be a little speedier.  I whipped up a ranch/cayenne/cumin dipping sauce to go with 'em, and the result was fabulous.

Very good!  To simplify matters, I used taco seasoning in place of the individual seasoning blend.  I also tripled the recipe.  My fiance ate FIVE for dinner, then took FIVE more for lunch!  He couldn't believe they were 'from scratch'...he swore up and down I had bought them pre-made!  The only thing that kept this recipe from five stars was due to my own fault, I believe...instead of letting the eggrolls freeze at least four hours, I couldn't wait and only let them freeze an hour, so when I cooked them, a little oil seeped in the filling and they were a tad greasy.  but rest assured, this weekend I am whipping up another batch and this time it will be done right!

Great recipe!!  When I made it, i made a huge batch.  Instead of using the recommended amounts of chicken, corn, beans, and spinach, I used a 2 pound package of chicken, a whole can of drained corn, a whole can of black beans and a box of frozen spinach drained. Instead of the regular seasonings, i used a bit of taco seasoning that you can find at any grocery store and I used eggroll wrappers instead of tortillas.  This cut down on the time to freeze, and to me tasted even better.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The first time I followed recipe and it was good. The second time I  used smoked chicken breast and it taste identical to Chili's. I used the dry ranch mix with 1/2 mayo & 1/2 sour cream with a whole avocado for the dip.....was delicious.

Awesome recipe ... followed instructions as is with the exception of adding orange and yellow bell peppers to go along with the red bell peppers ... also used fresh spinach (hate frozen/thawed spinach) ... as suggested by another reviewer I baked them in the oven instead of deep frying ... they were great ... crispy and delicious ... I made a jalapeño dipping sauce by mixing 3 tablespoons of Jalapeño tapernade (From H-E-B) with 2 tblsp of sour cream ... (you cans add more or less based on your taste) ... These were great !! Co workers loved them

I made this without the chicken and they were amazing. I baked them at 450 for 10 minutes with a coating of cooking spray on top and bottom.  Delicious! Everybody loved them.

These are really good!  My version was 5 stars but I gave this one three b/c of the alterations I felt necessary: 1) I used cilantro instead of parsley (duh) b/c why would you not!? 2) I increased the corn and beans by about double and might do even more next time; otherwise its mostly chicken and hardly any corn and beans, 3) I skipped the freezing - I have no idea what the point of that would be?? ...waste of time and energy, and 4) I used egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas - I didn't want to mess with the toothpicking (why not just use a product that's designed to wrap, stay closed and be fried?) or the inevitable cracking of the tortilla.  Also the egg roll wrappers are thicker - to me its more about the filling.  We LOVED them and I will be making a double batch next time for leftovers.  I made a quick sauce in the food processor w/yogurt, cilantro, cumin, S&P, some mile pepper and lime juice.

This recipe is awesomely flexible & quicker than 4 hours!  It only takes about 30 minutes to prep & cook.  I've made this recipe a few times (changing the ingredients up each time)... Every time I've made it they came out great- my family loves it! 

First off I don't freeze them which saves a ton of time. I also use a smoked or rotessie store bought chicken or canned chicken.  I also bake them (450 degrees for 15 minutes). There's no need to freeze them! I prefer the taste & texture of flour tortillas (easy to wrap without toothpicks if you push the ingredients to the outter edge of the tortilla, fold the sides around the ingredients & start rolling).  I bake them flap side down- always comes out perfect without loosing any ingredients.

I double the recipe which makes 12 full & 24 cut in half.  After baking they cut easily, looks just like the restaurant!  Also to save time & money (avacados can get pricey).  I've used Hidden Valley Ranch Avacado Ranch dressing to dip them in... My family couldn't tell them difference & it actually has less calories. 

I've also left out ingredients like jalapeños, parsley, & green onions & used canned chicken before (mainly because I didn't have them in the house & my 2 and 6 year old can't eat spicy foods) and they still came out awesome!  

I've also added cream cheese to them, my 2 year old says "delicious" when I make them this way.   But def adds more calories- but you should try them this way if calories are not a concern. Like my gr

Love this recipe. I have always hated southwest egg rolls from restaurants but then I did these and WOW. I used egg roll wrappers, took out that evil weed they call spinach, and used Habinaro jack cheese. I like  things spicy. Also replaced the green onion with a Spanish yellow and put dashes of chalula   in the mix. I am making a bunch for the super bowl.

Great recipe!! I did make some adjustments, which made it turn out fantastic.  I boiled the chicken- I am able to get it into much smaller pieces that way.  And I really don't like to fry anything, so I baked them at 475 for about 8 minutes (or until browning) and they were delicious!

Too much cheese.
Would be good with added salsa or dunk in salsa.
Did egg roll wraps and flour burritos.  I preferred the burritos, some kids preferred the egg roll wraps - I thought they were too hard.  Sprayed pan and top of egg rolls with Pam and cooked at 425 degrees for 10 minutes (too much, do 7) then flipped to brown the other side.

Awesome !   Think tortilla shells would be too much and too hard to roll, and did not want to deep fry so used egg roll wrappers. Filling was exactly as written in original recipe.    Made night before, placed in casserole dish then refrigerated covered with wax paper on tope of rolls to stay moist.  Baked next day- yummy !  Stuck a bit so will spray dish next time.  A keeper in my house.

Baked it instead of frying since don't have deep fryer, which may have made it even better. Also used egg roll wrapper instead of tortilla, but again think if followed recipe would have been better, especially since I don't know what to so with left over egg roll wrappers. Despite the differences the egg rolls still turned out very good & I'll probably make them again in the future!

I was going to pass this by but felt led to give it a shot. Now I am kicking myself in the caboose for only making half the recipe :) Very good, didn't even need dip! Only thing I added was shallots and garlic. Didn't freeze it either.  Thanks Lord for a great recipe!!

Very dry for surly needs some kind if sauce. I dipped mine in salsa and they still needed something. Not very flavorful ether. Oh well, I am glad I tried them, since it does give me some inspiration for my own recipe.

I made this last night and put it in the freezer. I really liked it, but I will try it without freezing it. The first 3 I fried was still froze in the center. A little less filling, a little tighter roll and these will be perfect. I LOVED THEM!!!!!!

YUMMY! I made these for Superbowl night!  I'm allergic to avocado :( so I made spicy ranch dressing to dip them in, even adding hot sauce to super-spice it up. I also made some rolls without spinach for the  anti-spinach-ers - ha. And some without chicken for me(allergic again!) I used eggroll wrappers instead of tortillas 'cos imho they're lighter. Also, I didn't bother to freeze them.  I'm addicted to these-so delicious & haven't made me fat! lol You don't have to add everything like corn either. I like trying different fillings. AWESOME.

With the exception of freezing, I followed the recipe to the letter an was not at all disappointed.  

After the first bite my husband said these test like one we had at a restaurant...Chili's.  I loved them.  

I used the flour tortillas because I like them.  Not too doughy for me.  I fried them because I didn't care if they were healthy or not.

I suspect the freezing step was to help hold them together when fried.  Since I didn't freeze them I a stuck a wooden skewer near each end through all the folds.

Love it!  Well worth the little bit of effort.

Delicious base recipe. I used more cumin than suggested, added sweet baby ray's bbq sauce, and loaded it with curry as well. I also uped the amount of beans and spinach to make it a bit healthier. I did not fry these, just baked em as others have commented about. :)

This is extremely popular with my family.  It's one of the few ways I can get my picky toddler to eat veggies!  I use the ingredients called for in the recipe, but I'm very flexible with the quantities.  I just throw everything together and heat it up.  I use either egg roll wrappers or tortillas, depending on what I have on hand, and I spray the egg rolls with cooking spray and bake them at 450 until they're lightly browned.  I don't freeze them first.  I serve the egg rolls with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce for dipping.

Very nice recipe, and pretty easy to make.  I substituted kale for spinach, and used fresh ingredients instead of frozen, just stir frying them together with the red pepper and onion.  I don't deep fry, and instead I pan fried the rolls in a little oil on the stove top, turning them when browned.  I didn't freeze the rolls before cooking either and they stayed together nicely, as long as I fried them seam side down first.  Husband loved them and wants them again soon.  Next time I might try baking them.  Served them with a little sour cream and some Cherry Republic green salsa, lovely.

Another great knock-off recipe that uses whatever ingredients you have on hand. I have used pulled pork, rotisserie chicken, all sorts of veggies, and various cheeses.  Texas caviar would work very well in these (without the dressing, of course).  To cut fat content, I spray the tortillas with olive oil and bake them at 400 for 10-15 minutes, turning once to brown all around.  A crowd favorite that always goes fast!

I have made this recipe a few times. I leave out the beans (don't like beans) and use egg roll wrappers. Did some with tortillas but liked egg roll wrappers best. I always double the recipe. I like these better then the ones at Chili's.

I made this for new years eve and it was a hit! I omitted the jalapeno as I didn't have it on hand and it was still phenominal! Was told to keep on making them for all future parties.

Loved these and so did my husband and 1 year old! I didn't have jalapeños or parsley but I put in extra spinach and extra salt and they turned out perfectly. I only put them in the freezer for about and hour and they still fried very well.

These were so delicious. instead of the tortillas I used egg roll wraps, instead of the parsley I used cilantro, and instead of cayenne I used black pepper. Did not use cumin because I did not have any on hand.  I used red, yellow, and green peppers, and didn't use any spinach.  I also place a toothpick at the bottom lip before cooking them so they would not come apart. I did not freeze them.  I deep fried them for about 3 minutes 3 at a time.  They came out amazing.  Brought them to work for lunch and had one person try them now everyone wants the recipe.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

This recipe is awesome!  My teenage son who "doesn't like vegetables" requests this.  I bake them instead of deep frying also, there's really no need for the added calories, it's a healthy YUMMY meal.

Amazing. I have made these with and without the chicken and enjoyed them both times. Served it with Amy's cilantro sauce from this site - so, so good together. Will definitely make again (many times)!

Great recipe - but i did make changes.  Instead of jalepenos, added a small can of chopped chiles, instead of green onion, i just added regular onion,and instead of parsley, i used cilantro.  I also added lime juice and salt to taste. As suggested on previous reviews, i baked instead of frying them at 450 for 15 mins.  I sprayed the tortillas with pam, put the mixture in, rolled it, sealed with a couple of toothpicks and placed them on baking sheet. Leave space in between each roll (if you get them too close together the sides will not get crunchy.  They turned out great..huge hit at my Bible study.  Paired this with Amy's cilantro sauce on this website as well.  Thanks for the recipe!!  Will be a keeper!

I have never reviewed anything during the 10+ years I have been on this site, until now. What a 5-star killer recipe!! Made it for a family party, and they were gone so fast, I thought someone was playing a prank on me! I followed the recipe as written, and couldn't have been more pleased. My nephews wife demanded the recipe.  For your next party, or just for family snacking during the game, make this a go-to recipe. Try the creamy tomatillo avocado sauce (found here) with it for the perfect match.

BETTER THAN ANY RESTURANTS!!!  A little time consuming, so I'm glad I doubled the recipe.  I have another PERFECT 5 in the freezer for a treat in the not so long future.  Thanks for sharing.

I host 10 football coaches for appetizers and film study every Monday night for my son's football team.  I made these last week and I had SO many compliments.  A few even went home and asked their wives to email me for the recipe!  I changed just a few things - used pre-diced jalapenos and left out the spinach and cayenne pepper.  They still had just the right amount of spice!  Instead of frying I baked them at 425 degrees for 15 minutes and the tortillas were nice and crispy.  Definitely will make this one again (and again!).

I love Chili's Southwestern Eggrolls and these came kinda close. Tried to make then healthier with less cheese and more veg. Also pan fried I stead of deep fried. Next time I'll try baking them instead. Oh, and I used Eggroll wrappers instead of tortillas. I used a yogurt ranch dressing for dipping. Very yummy.

10/10 would make again. I doubled the recipe then doubled the onions and red bell peppers. I omitted the parsley and the spinach, and I used egg roll wrappers instead of the tortilla. It made about 38 egg rolls. I also tried to recreate the Arby's "Lime-Chili Ranch Sauce" I used the juice of 1 lime (about 2-3 tbsp,) 2/3 cup of ranch dressing, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp paprika. (I haven't tasted the actual arby's Lime-Chili Ranch Sauce in years so I have no clue if its an exact match but it was amazingly good)

Freezing Tip: First time I made these I froze them on a baking sheet then put them in a freezer bag. The egg roll wrappers dried out and the edges were chipped. This time I wrapped each individual egg roll in plastic wrap and put them in freezer bags and froze them. To cook I defrost them overnight in the refrigerator and then fried them. It came out great!

I don't get this fancy.  I just roll up mild green pepper and pepper jack cheese in a flour tortilla and fry.  Top with sour cream and fresh salsa and some avocado on the side.

I made these for a work potluck and everyone loved them. I actually ended up making 40, which I thought would take forever, but the process wasn't too brutal. The flavors are amazing!!! I am a cheese lover and the recipe may seem like it calls for too mcuh cheese, but I thought that it was just the right amount, definitely not overwhelming. The only down side was that the egg rolls tend to lose their crispiness fairly quickly; however, they were still amazing! GREAT recipe.

I am not an egg roll person at all! When my husband said he was going to make these for our anniversary, I was offended at first. But he promised me I would like it and if not, he would go get me anything else I wanted. 
I love these! They are super delicious and filling. They freeze great so you can have leftovers (if there are any!). The only change he made was to use egg roll wraps instead of tortillas. They came out crispy and perfect. Great choice!

This recipe is amazing! I always double or triple it because it is so nice having these in the freezer for when friends come over. It is a little time consuming since you have to chop everything up so small but it's worth it! I serve them with Chipotle Ranch or Spicy Ranch dressing for dipping. So delicious!!

Made these tonight and they were pretty good. Per other reviews, did not use spinach and baked them at 450 for 12 minutes instead of frying. Otherwise, followed recipe as is and it yielded 6 egg rolls. Tortillas came out a bit dry, so will tinker to remedy that (perhaps using egg roll wrappers next time). Great idea to pair with "Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce". Thanks to OP and other reviewers for sharing:)

My family loved this recipe but seriously, you have to double or triple everything to get enough for 3-4 people. I added cilantro and took out the spinach. I went with the flour tortillas and the oven baked method that others suggested. Fantastic!

LOVED THIS! I skipped the jalepenos & cayenne & added some crushed pepper flakes instead since I don't like a lot of spice. I used 2 chicken breasts since I was making this for dinner & used lots of freshly chopped spinach & corn. I baked these for about 15 minutes and they were AMAZING! My boyfriend loved them! Thank you for sharing!

I love this recipe and make it often.  It is a bit of work but it is worth it.  I recently made it for some friends and they were fighting over the last one!  I've tried several variations to this, and the original in my opinion is the best.  I've tried the baking and while they are good, they are not near as tasty as the deep fried version.  I even did a side by side comparison, and the deep fried won hands down.  But if you are watching calories, the baked version is still good.  I also tried the freezing vs. no freeze and when deep frying, even with them secured with toothpicks the ones I didn't freeze came open during the fry.  I serve these with a quick mixed avocado dip (smashed avocados, sour cream, chopped tomato, onions, jalapeno, and cilantro).  They are so good and so worth the effort.

Easy to deep fry in a sauce pan with about 1/2 oil. Just roll them around until golden on all sides.

Like many others, I baked them. 375 for 22 minutes, or until crispy. Cut them into thirds. More than doubled the recipe and used 8" flour tortillas and got 11 out of the batch(33 pieces). Used a whole can of pinto beans (I was out of black beans), added 1 TBSP minced cilantro, 3/4 cup frozen corn kernels and 1/2 cup spinach (these ingredients are more than doubled). Also used a Mexican Four Cheese blend instead of just Monterey Jack.

I used 3 times the amount of spinach and substituted cheddar jack for monterey jack. Turned out great!! This recipe is a keeper.

These were so good. Very similar to Chili's. I baked them at 400 for about 15 minutes, turning once. I did not have to use a tooth pick; they stayed together just fine. I left out the spicy stuff for one roll and my picky 5 year old ate the whole thing!

Taste was very good, I tried to used egg roll wrappers and I think next time I'm going to just follow the recipe and use flour tortillas.  I did bake them as well but they were not crunchy enough for us so I wound up deep frying them for about 2 minutes

Loved it!  Very much like the southwestern egg rolls from "Chills" restaurant It was a little dry but that could because I left it on the stove too long.  Will be adding this one to my book.

These were awesome. The filling is so good that they work as a simple wrap, oven baked or deep fried. Deep fried gives them the best crunchiness I found however which adds a really nice dimension to the dish.

Baked them instead because it's Healthier and Soooooo Tasty! I don't like Avocado Ranch Dip like they serve @ Chili's so I simply use ranch. :)

These were sooo good we ate them everyday for a week.  Only changes I made were using wonton wraps instead of tortilla  and using less oil and turning half way through during frying.

Huge hit!! I love when I get asked for a recipe at a party. I baked them instead of frying them. I'll probably make this a staple in my home. They can be made and frozen ahead of time, then put directly into the oven for an easy dinner during the week.

I am so excited!  I was looking for a recipe for one leftover chicken breast and blackbeans for dinner for two!  This was quick and easy to make because the chicken was already cooked and so were the baked beans.  I used some spicy jack and cheddar cheeses- this is oh so good!  I baked them too.

Better than any southwestern egg roll I've ordered in a restaurant. My changes were insignificant: I don't do spicy so I omitted the jalapenos and cayenne. Didn't have frozen, so I used canned corn. Finally, I used wheat tortillas cause I love wheat. 

The trick to the wheat tortillas is not to get the fancy-schmancy expensive ones (they taste like cardboard). La Banterita or Azteca tastes great. I thought rolling them was simple, just fold them up and pin with toothpicks as instructed. 

Also, I doubled the recipe. This recipe although not hard, isn't worth the time for just 5 or 6 egg rolls. You can just leave them frozen if you don't want them all at one time- amazing!

These are delish! Made these for a family bbq and they were gone in a flash. These take a little time to make (mincing ingredients and rolling ) but when the end result is top quality taste such as these it is well worth the effort! I quadruple the recipe as they freeze nicely. I use foster farms precooked southwestern chicken breast strips usually found in the meat department and skip the cooking of the chicken breast to cut down on time. Thanks for a "keeper' Jackie!

This is the most amazing recipe ever! It is a bit time consuming to prepare but it is everybody's favorite meal including the most pickiest eaters. I serve it with avocado ranch dip and use the 8 inch tortillas (I multiply the recipe by 5 and get about 18 egg rolls)

I made these, exactly as written to try as an appetizer in my cafe... they were excellent!  I doubled the recipe which gave me 4 orders worth and I sold out in 20 minutes and have been asked for them since, so they're going on the menu permanently!!  Super delicious!!  Oh, I used flour tortillas and lightly fried them.

so easy, and taste great! Did everything exact except just sprayed with cooking spray and put in oven 350 for 10-15min (more healthy) I love that i could make a big batch and store some extra! You HAVE to make with "AMY'S CILANTRO SAUCE" made the dish perfect!

I didn't do this recipe exactly, but I had to give it a five based on the great mix of ingredients and spices!  I made the chicken, jalepenos, corn, full can of spinach, and spices into quesedillas with considerably less cheese than called for and they were awesome.  When I have more time I'll try the actual egg roll recipe!

Anything less that 5 does not justify this recipe!  If my fiance wasn't home I likely would have eaten them all by myself.  We are dieting and though there are so many healthy things in this recipe, frying them destroys that... but we did anyway, as a treat to ourselves.  I will definately double batch next time (i have left over egg rolls anyway, which can freeze up to 2 months) because I just don't think there were enough. we will no longer buy the frozen kind at the store or get them at the restaurants because we both agree these are WAYYYYY better anyway.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have Monteray Jack so I used Colby Jack cheese and my local grocery store ran out of green onions so i just dashed some onion poweder on the peppers as they were cooking. I wouldn't want to use tortilla rolls only because I think that would give it more of a quesadilla effect than an egg roll.  We've already decided these will be the appetizers the next time someone comes over, and probably every other time as well.  There is no recipe that compares to the goodness of this! TY for this recipe... you have totally made our day (and many more days to follow)

Tastes just like the rolls from Chilis. There is a cilantro and lime sauce that goes well with these, it's on this site, i forget where though

I made these as written and they came out great! I followed another reader recommendation and made Amy's creamy cilatro sauce to go with them which was a perfect combination. At that point I decided to make a beef and seafood version of these and make it a dipping meal. For beef I had some leftover pumpkin turkey chili (from this site) which I mixed with mexican cheese blend and wrapped them up in 10 inch tortilla's, fried them then served with caso cheese sauce. For the seafood I used imitation crab mixed with red onion, garlic, red pepper, black olives and mixed in some monterey jack cheese, then fried. i paired the crab wrap with peach mango salsa. yummm... I found that 10 inch tortilla's work better and next time I will bake these instead.

The only thing I changed was that I baked them instead of frying. I put the oven on 375 for 20min then put under the broiler for a few min to brown. I also made an alvocado ranch dipping sauce. VERY TASTY!!

Love this recipe! The egg rolls were just the way I like. I used Belpaese cheese instead of Monterey Jack, because when I decided to prepare them I couldn't find it here (Lima, Perú). Now I've found Monterey Jack cheese at a supermarket and I'm happy, I'm going to make them again :-)

This was a great meal. I think next time I will refer to the other reviews on this recipe though and use the ready made egg rolls for the outer shell so I don't have to freeze them. The filling smelled so good I wanted to eat it right then!

Fantastic! WOW... I decided to bake these from other suggestions and they came out crisp enough without needing to fry them.  I used "Amy's Cilantro cream Sauce" (from this site) as the dip. My dinner guests loved these

I loved this recipe!!!  I wasn't expecting it to taste so great.  I want to make these again soon, but the fact that they are fried is the only thing holding me back.  I really loved these and gobbled them up very quickly.  Some things I changed up were:  eggroll wrappers instead of tortillas, no spinach, cilantro instead of parsley and I salted and peppered my chicken before cooking it.

I too left out the spinach and used eggroll wrappers, and they were AWESOME!  Quick tip on the chicken: I marinated mine in lemon juice, salt pepper olive oil and some basil for 2 hours before I cooked it. Chicken was incredibly tender and added a ton of flavor. Super YUM!

These were tasty! I used wonton wrappers, and canned chicken (so much easier and faster and you can't really taste the difference mixed in like this). I also baked per other reviewers advice and served with sour cream.

Great idea! I baked mine and used cilantro instead of parsley. I also used red onion instead of green and skipped the spinach all together. I also used a little egg wash to hold it together. If you bake them only do a few at a time. At 475 and 6 minutes they were brown. But then I tried to put 30 in the oven and they never got brown. So just do a few at a time and they will be crunchy like a fried one.

Pretty good but need way more flavor.  Added habanero to ours and upped the spices & it really still needed a bit more kick.  Not a big fan of the spinach in there either.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE spinach, but it seems out of place here.  Served with cilantro lime dip (recipe also on this site).

I made these for 2 separate parties already.  Everyone loves them!!! I have had to email the recipe to so many people already.  I used egg roll wrappers, and I deep fried them.  I made a cilantro dipping sauce for them also.  PERFECT!!!

These were WONDERFUL and they are a much healthier alternative to buying frozen taquitos/burritos/southwestern egg rolls. :) I added more black beans and did NOT add corn (in my opinion, corn does NOT belong in mexican food...) or spinach (I just don't like spinach). Thank you, Jackie!

Soooo good. Just like cheesecake factory! I doubled the recipe and I am so glad I did because it would only make 5 tiny egg rolls if you didn't... which would be way too much work. I also baked them and used whole wheat tortillas. Next time I will use less cheese to cut calories too. These are totally worth the effort!!

These little things rock! I would highly suggest to use egg roll wrappers. They are super easy to work with and look great. I sprayed the tops with Pam and baked at 475 for 10 min. I made guacamole to go with. Delicious!

This is the best recipe I've gotten off of this site and I've gotten many. These are outstanding. I made these for an appetizer for a dinner party and they were a HUGE hit. I kept some uncooked ones frozen (about a month) and just heated them up in the toaster oven yesterday for lunch. They don't even need to be fried to taste delicious. Next time, I'm going to spray them with Pam Olive oil spray before baking and see how they turn out. They were fantastic BOTH times I had them-fried or baked. (of course fried was a little better. :-)

I've been a loyal subscriber to this site for years and this is the first time I've felt compelled to offer a review - THESE ARE FANTASTIC!!!  I got lazy and didn't want to fry them (plus, why make something that could be healthy bad for you!?).  We used the filling in the tortillas and ate like soft tacos with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce spread inside.  THEY ARE JUST AS AMAZING SUBSTITUTING SHRIMP OR GRILLED FISH FOR THE CHICKEN.  I can't recommend these enough!!!!

Update: I officially never make this as egg rolls - I double the veggie mixture, tossing with half of the spice mixture and then season grilled/baked/broiled fish (halibut or cod) with the other half of the spices. Fish and veggies are served in a tortilla and topped with the cilantro sauce mentioned above. This is DELICIOUS!!!

My only gripe is that this recipe didn't make more! These were so good. I served with Guacamole and a Cilantro Salad Dressing for dipping. I used large Egg Rolls instead of tortillas, so I didn't have to freeze them. I only got 4 large egg rolls (which looked like mini burritos). I don't like to deep fry, so I pan fried them and they turned out wonderfully. I think it would have been a lot more time consuming if I didn't have leftover shredded chicken and leftover black beans from last night's dinner. I will definitely be making these again--and will be doubling the recipe!

These SW Eggrolls were amazing!!!  Only changes that I made were subbing cilantro in place of parsley and we did not fry them.  Instead, we rolled the egrolls up and sprayed they were non stick cooking spray and baked! I sereved them with Jalapeno Cream Sauce and Spanish rice.  SOOO good, and so much more healthy than Chili's version!  Thank you for an incredible recipe.

Really liked these...they were time consuming, but I am so glad that I made the recipe scaled for 20.  Even my picky kids tried  them.  I used egg roll wrappers and cilantro instead of parsley.  I used a small paint brush to seal the edges with water, and fried them.  2 lbs of chicken, one whole box of frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained.  I  made 21 rolls total, exactly enough to use up all of my egg wrappers.  Made an avocado/ranch dip with 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 packet hidden valley ranch mix and an avocado & cilantro...gave it a whirl in the food processor and added a little milk to thin.  Yum!

Loved them! I wanted vegetarian so I left out the chicken and the cheese. Used red and green pepper; I think I added extra cumin because we love cumin; CILANTRO instead of parsley; could have used a bit less corn. I ended up using about 17 large tortillas; I cooked the filling, rolled and refrigerated about two days in advance (to save prep time). Baked at 450* for 10 minutes - I found the whole wheat and low carb tortillas cooked very nicely, as they are a bit more thin than regular white tortillas. To serve, I cut them diagonally in halves. Served with Spicy Cilantro Dressing - really, really super!

These were delicious!  I followed other reviewers' advice and served it w/Amy Cilantro Cream  Sauce and boy am I glad I did!  it just took this recipe to the next level.  Oh the only changes i made  were that I didn't freeze it and i baked it at 350 for 15 mins instead of deep frying it.

Absolutely divine!  I used about 1/3 c. fresh chopped spinach instead of frozen; 1 T. Jalapeno peppers diced; 1 T. cilantro instead of parsley; and egg roll wrappers instead of flour tortillas.  Instead of deep frying, spray the pan with olive oil & also spray the tops of the wrappers with oil and bake at 450 for about 10-15 mins until lightly browned.  They are wonderful with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce from this site.

Instead of deep frying, I used as a filling quesadilla style- browning the tortilla in a skillet with some nonstick spray and then slicing into triangle pieces.  Served with ranch dressing spiced with cumin and chili powder.  Excellent!

Made as recommended (except I sprayed with olive oil & baked). They were great - just like Chili's southwestern egg roll.  Served with avocado dipping sauce from other site - delish!

Very good! Served at a baby shower and everyone thought they were from a restaurant.  We stuck with frying them. Tip:  Be sure to keep the tooth picks in when frying and be sure to have the tooth pick with equal portions showing on each end. This will help secure the wrap through frying. Great recipe!

I made these for Superbowl game night gathering at my house. I always get nervous when we invite people over..especially to eat. Cooking and feeding people is an expression of love from me so I want EVERYONE to be happy when they eat my food. Well guess what? These eggrolls were a SMASH HIT! I used the eggroll skins instead of the tortillas and they turned out perfect just the way they were suppossed to be!.  I love spinach used in Southwestern cooking and all my guests were pleasantly suprised with the spinach in the eggrolls. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very tasty! I baked them to be healthier. They tasted more like southwest burritos. I will probably make these for a crowd and double the recipe. I feel like I had a lot of ingredients left over. Amy's cilantro cream sauce is wonderful with this.

Delicious! I tweaked it a little bit cus it needed more spices: i replaced parsley with cilantro and doubled the amounts of cumin, chili powder and cayenne, then added onion and garlic powder. then I added about three tablespoons of my favorite salsa cus I think it needs some acid for a more robust flavor. I also baked them on 425 for 15 minutes instead of frying them. They were beyond delicious! Excellent base recipe!!

Love, love, love these...these taste like the egg rolls at Chili's.  Even my mother-in-law asked where I bought them (she thought they were frozen).  She was impressed when my husband told her that I made them from scratch!  Easy to make - I just have to remember to be more careful when I'm freezing them, because the toothpicks went into the egg rolls on top of them, and I had to separate them after they were fried, which made kind of a mess.

UPDATE:  Won an appetizer cook-off contest at a Super Bowl party yesterday!  You MUST use egg-roll wrappers.   Here's what I do:  I use a pastry brush to "paint" the inside of the wrapper with southwestern ranch dressing before rolling them up and had no problems with the seal holding.  Using egg roll wrappers, use 1.5 Tablespoons per wrapper.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T.  Yields 10 egg rolls per recipe using my method.

FANTASTIC!!!!  Very filling and so delicious.  These are better than restaurant quality!  A few helpful hints : The first one I fried got too dark, without cooking thoroughly. I had set my fryer at 375, which was too hot.  350 worked perfectly.  Also - secure your toothpick through the very end of the flap, making sure it stays tight.  A few of mine seperated during cooking, causing the flap to get too dark.  Other than that, they were perfect!

I omitted the onion (used powder instead) and the peppers.  I felt the spice was lacking something so I added about 1/8 cup of taco sauce (smooth). Instead of wrapping/frying, I spooned the mixture into baked won ton wrappers.  Yes, I totally butchered the recipe but it was a great recipe to adapt and make my own - thanks!

Very good, I used a mix of salsa and sour cream to dip them in. I am sure they are even better deep fried but I also baked them for a healthier dinner.

DELICIOUS!  Just like Chili's!  I was in a hurry so added taco seasoning instead of individually measuring out seasonings.  The possibilities are endless for the filling.  To cut back on some of the fat/calories I brushed them  with olive oil and baked them until crispy (turned them a few times).  Served them w/an avocado ranch dipping sauce that was the perfect touch.

I love getting southwest rolls when we eat out and these tasted even better without the deep frying.  I omitted the chicken and increased the corn and spinach and black beans.  Instead of jalapenos, I added a 4oz can of diced green chilies, and replaced cilantro for the regular parsley.  Wrapping the tortillas neatly wasn't the easiest, but after folding and rolling, I stuffed the sides into the middle and placed in a rectangular pan to hold shape.  I didn't use toothpicks or freeze, just kept in the fridge overnight.  Brushed with butter just before baking in 400 degree oven for 15 minutes, turning once.  Delicious!

These were easier to make than I first thought when I saw the list of ingredients. I decided against deep frying and instead sprayed them with Pam and cooked them at 425 for 15 minutes (as suggested by reviewers). They were very crispy. I think they tasted even better the next day. Maybe next time I'll let the ingredients rest together for a while before making the rolls to allow the flavors to marry.

They were great and a big hit. The first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly but I found that when I fried them the outsides were getting done quicker then the filling could heat so the second time around I rolled several just like taquitos with flour and corn tortillas and sealed them with toothpicks and fried right away - no freezer time and they turned out a perfect golden brown and didn't have to fry as long!

I used egg roll wraps which were a little flimsy. Found I only had to bake for about 7 minutes at 450. Delicious.

Very Yummy and went over big a tailgate party served with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce from this site. I doubled the recipe and used 2 large chicken breast. There seemed to be so much meat that I eyeballed extra corn, spinach, and other veggies. I also used egg roll wrappers and made 26 egg rolls. Sprayed pan and egg roll with some Pam and baked for 15 minutes. Loved them!

These were terrific and I'll be making them for my upcoming fiesta wedding shower that I'm throwing.  After reading reviews I decided to bake instead of fry.  I added a coat of egg white wash over tops so they'd be crispy.  Next time I might just go with cooking spray.  I used rotisserie chicken to save time.  I also tried both wonton wrappers and tortillas.  I liked the taste of both, but the wontons gave it added "crunch" and I think they looked a little nicer.

The filling was delicious! I opted to spray them with non-stick spray and bake them. Not really a good idea. They were too dry. Next time I will cook them in oil. Goes great with Amy's Cilantro Sauce. Yum

Love the flavor of this recipe!  I double all ingredients and prepare exactly by the recipe up until step 5.  I still use tortillas and warm in the microwave, but once I fill... I eat. Although I love fried food, I try to stay away from it when cooking at home.  And even though I know some people baked, I just can't wait that long.  These are so good I want to eat right away.

Excellent recipe! It definitely was a bit time-consuming and next time I will double the recipe so that I can freeze half for a later date. Very delicious! I followed the reciped almost exactly, I just used egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas and baked them at 350 for approx twenty minutes. They still came out crispy and yummy! Will be making these many more times - super healthy too!

Absolutely delicious! I did use regular egg rolls instead of flour tortillas to get the full effect and were definately a hit! Will make these over and over again!

I made these and served with the Annie's Cilantro Cream sauce recipe like others recommended.  I had to double the recipe, and baked them like another reviewer recommended at 450 for 10 minutes.  I also added a couple of teaspoons of Mrs. Dash's chipotle seasoning.  Everyone raved about these!  Great recipe!

These are very versatile! The first time I made them I stuck to the recipe, now I just use what ever random veggies are in my fridge at the end of the week. I like egg roll wrappers and I bake them since the clean up is easier. So easy and very good.  They go well with salsa, guacamole, or a cilantro sauce.   This is a real crowd pleaser.

These were so good! I used egg roll wraps instead of tortilla and I used my deep fryer. My hubby even likes them.

A huge hit at the office!  Except for doubling up on the ingredients to make more, I went by the "book".  Tasty!  One thing to note (if not already noted) is that you should leave the toothpicks in until done frying.  That may be common knowledge for most, but being a novice in the kitchen, I had to pull my first one out of the oil after it started unraveling.  Lesson learned.

OH MY GOOOOOODNESS!!!  yum!!!!  mmmmmm!!!!  aghhhh!  get the point?!  lol these are fantastic! i have been looking forever for a recipe to indulge in and this is definitely it!  i did use eggroll wraps instead and tried half of them double wrapped and the other half single wrapped.  i think the single wrap was enough unless you are really eating this for a meal in itself then go for the double wrapped.  i did also use cilantro in place of the spinach and pepper jack cheese instead of the monterey jack and omitted the jalapenos.  LOOOOOVE IT!

The beauty of this recipe is it is easy to modify the ingredients to meet your personal preferences and what you have on hand.  I did not use spinach, japaleno, parsley or red pepper but added diced avocado, cilantro and a few squeezes of fresh lime juice. I also used vacuum packed sweet corn in place of frozen.   I diced the chicken before cooking, then sauteed it in a little veggie oil, adding the remaining ingredients to the pan when the chicken was cooked most of the way.  As others have recommended, I used egg roll wrappers and made Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce from this website.  Amazingly good! Highly recommend adding avocado.

I was able to find tortillas that hadn't been cooked yet, it made the wrapping easier (kinda like won ton wrappers).  I used some left over pulled pork instead of chicken and avacado chunks!!  SOOOO AWESOME!  I paired it with Amy's creamy cilantro dip, which another viewer suggested.  That was easy and very good too.  I didn't freeze them either and they turned out great.

Great Recipe...they were a hit at the party I took them to last night.  I made a few substitutions for what I had on hand: I used pinto beans instead of black beans and cilantro in place of parsley.  Also, I had some extra shredded chicken that I was using for another recipe...so I used that.  I baked mine in a 475 degree oven for about 15 mins...oh and I didn't freeze them cause I didn't have the time.  Turned out great.

These were really good.  I baked them instead of frying them at 475 for 15 minutes and they were nice and crispy.  Next time I will use a little extra vegetbles and a little less chicken.  We had them with sour cream and even the kids loved them.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

YUMMY!! I used 8 inch flour tortilla's (all I had) diced up rotisserie chicken, replaced the spinach with chopped up cilantro and added a tad more jalapeno's for some kick. After rolling them up I coated them lightly with olive oil so they would get nice & crispy! I baked for 15 mins at 425. Served with Amy's Cilantro sauce from this site and it was SO GOOD! Next time I will try frying them and serve for my next family function!

I had Amy's Cilantro avail in my fridge, glad I stumbled on this one =-) Shortcuts: Placed 2 whole roasted breasts [well seasoned from the crockpot & chopped] in a large bowl, added 1/2 red bell pepper[minced]whole can of La Costena black beans [drained] 4 tb fresh spinach and 1 jalapeno minced, 2 tb cilantro, 1/4t ts ground cumin, pinch of cayenne, pinch of salt, about 1/2 C shredded Jack I had left in the fridge, covered and microwaved the whole thing for 4 minutes to soften peppers/fresh spinach, stirring every 2 minutes, OMG! Instant heaven. Also microwaved 16 medium sized tortillas in a gallon size Zip bag for 1 minute to soften [unsealed] the zip lock kept them pliable for a long time, the wonderful rolls were baked w/PAM as other suggested. Thank You!

Fairly time consuming, but, yummy!  As others suggested I think these would make really good appetizers using wonton wrappers instead & making each one much smaller.  Also made the Black Bean and Corn Salad II and it served as a great side for the Southwestern Rolls.

These are a little time consuming with all of the ingrediants, but they are well worth the effort.  I can't tell the difference between them and my favorite restaurant's. I did freeze the extras and I put them in the oven instead of frying them.  I love mine with honey mustard so I made a home made honey mustard with mustard, honey, pepper, and mayonaise. I just did it all to taste. It also tastes like my favorite restaurant's. DELISH

These were fabulous! What a great flavor!  We did not freeze them before cooking.  We used egg roll wrappers and baked them at 450 degrees for 15 minutes.  They came out perfect!  We used the creamy cilantro sauce recipe on this site for dipping which made them even more delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly expected I used Quorn Southwestern "vegetarian" chicken wings. I also brushed them with olive oil and baked at 450 for 15 mins. I did not freeze them. My family raved and raved about these. They were so good I was eating bites right out of the pan. YUMMY!!! This is deff a 5 Star recipe!!

I did not completely read the recipe  the night i decided to try it. Thus, i did not leave time to freeze the rolls for 4 hours (more like 20 minutes!). I didn't notice any drawbacks with the decreased freezing time. I used whole wheat tortillas, but otherwise followed the recipe. It was a big hit with my husband, 20 month and 3 year. I served it with toasted corn salad and called it a perfect light meal. will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe as is. 5 stars. I'm writing this review to suggest that you triple the recipe so your ingredients don't go to waste, plus it's a time consuming recipe. Freeze the rolls and you'll have them when you need them. Tripling the recipe makes approximately 20 egg rolls. Which is how many wrappers come in a pack.  You'll use an entire bunch of green onions, a whole red pepper, a lot of the corn, more of the spinach. Almost the whole can of black beans, a whole 2c. package of shredded cheese, etc. It will cost about the same and you have less waste. Anyways, great recipe. Hope that helps.

This is so good I could not wait to make this again.  I baked them the first time and the second time I deep fried them.  Both ways excellent.  I also used egg roll wrappers, personal taste. Used Amy's cilantro cream sauce for dipping.

This is my favorite recipe on this site to date.  I doubled the recipe, used flour 'Fajita' size tortillas, replaced the Parsley with Cilantro, and baked 10 minutes at 425.  Fresh jalapeno salsa was used as the dip.  This was a crowd favorite at my Super Bowl party.

This was as good as the previous reviews stated.  I have made them 2 ways: baked using tortillas and fried using egg roll wrappers.  Definately the best way to go is the fried and egg roll wrapers.  They are easier to use than using the tortillas and fry up better.  I have made these probably 5 times the the last month for different gatherings and such and get asked for the recipe every time.  I did not change any of the ingredients except for the wrappers and I doubled the ingredients and there was still none left.  They taste just like something you would get at Chili's Restaurant.

Very good, I omitted the spinach and followed the suggestion of baking these at 425 for 15-20 minutes, they needed to be covered about half-way through. Used one can of Costco chicken and extra corn and black beans. I ended up with nine.

My fiance did not initially like these, but once they came to room temperature he ate them all.  They were really good! The ONLY thing I did was not put in the green onion because I didn't have any.  Otherwise followed the recipe to a T.

Love 'em!  Great duplication of the ones served at Applebee's.  If you want more authentic use egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas.  I think I'll also use more black beans and less chicken.  For dipping sauce I just used ranch dressing (Hidden Valley make your own) and spice up with cumin and paprika.

I made the mistake of using egg roll wrappers instead of the tortillas. The filling I think is way to dense (and perhaps to moist) for the delicate egg roll wrappers to handle.  ---But that was my mistake, not the fault of the recipe.  It sure did have a kick to it!!  Pretty good...I served with sour cream.

Really really good.  I made these into Quesadillas for a quick lunch.  I didn't freeze the mixture.  I am going to make the eggrolls this weekend with an avocado and sour cream dipper.  Thanks!

These are amazing!  I baked instead of frying (didn't miss the extra fat at all) and I also didn't freeze them first.  They were exceptional.  I am so going to make this recipe again.

These are soooo awesome! I added a bit more cumin, for a distinct taste, I also seasoned the chicken with Mrs. Dash Garlic & Herb seasoning and it was awesome! Sargento makes a nice shredded 5 cheese mix that goes perfectly with this dish! and I'm glad I used the Tortillas over the egg roll wraps

These are DELICIOUS. I followed the recipe exactly but baked them rather than deep-fry. SO SO SO good! I'm going to make these again but quadruple the recipe so that I have plenty of leftovers to pop in the microwave as a quick meal!

Wow!!! These egg rolls were soo yummy!! I made them for a party I was having & my hubby thought they tasted really similar to chilli's egg rolls! My only regret was that I should have made more!! They were gone in no time! Even a friend of mine that isn't a fan of black beans tried one & then couldn't get enough of it!! This was a GREAT recipe & I will definatley be making this one again, as a matter of fact my hubby already requested this for dinner sometime this week since he didn't get enough of them they went so fast!!

Very different! The only thing I did differently was use rotisserie chicken instead of regular chicken breast. This added more flavor, in my opinion. Like others, I served this with Amy's Lime Sauce.

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME! I cut back on the amount of corn and added more cheese and a little more cumin. I used eggroll wrappers, then after freezing them I put a few in the oven and a few to deep fry to figure out which I liked better. I'm SO sorry to report that deep frying is SO much tastier, doesnt even compare! I plan on making more and keeping them in my freezer, I've never done that before as I like everything fresh, but this is one of those that you need to keep frozen and you are going to be craving alllll the time!!! easy snack filled with healthy stuff (ok so the deep frying isnt healthy i know i know!)...10 STARS ALL THE WAY!!

These egg rolls are absolutely awesome. I have used egg roll wrappers and flour tortillas they both are great but I like the egg roll wrappers the best. I have also used wonton wrappers to make mini egg rolls for a party, everyone was in awe! This recipe will be in my personal recipe box for a long time. Thanks!

This is the first recipe I've ever rated, but I felt I had to because these are AMAZING!
I've made them twice now and everytime guests have asked for more than I made!
I did banke them instead of deep frying but either method would be equally tasty. 
The first time I made these I made them with Amy's Amazing Cilantro Dip as a few other reviewers had suggested, first time trying cilantro and not a fan, but everyone else loved it! The bowl was licked clean!
I would definately reccomend these as an appetizer for ANY get together!!

These were pretty good.  I used cilantro instead of parsley and doubled the recipe.  I also baked them instead of frying them to cut down on calories.  Will make again.

They were awesome!  My whole family came over and I made these as an appetizer.  There was not one left on the plate and when it came time for the main course, everyone was full of the SW Egg Rolls!  

I left out the red bell pepper.  When I cooked them in the hot oil, they were just from the freezer and they were golden brown and the middles were still frozen, but I cheated and popped them in the microwave!  The outsides were still crunchy and mmmmmmmmmm, everyone loved them!

10 stars if I could!!  I used the mini wonton wrappers and made bite size ones.  I made these vegetarian as well-added extra beans to replace the meat.  They were SO GOOD!  I fried them too-and I really recommend it.  I know it's fattening but so worth it sometimes!  This is a really impressive appetizer (especially when served with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce from this site) that I'll be making again and again!  Thank you thank you!!

EXCELLENT DISH. I made it two days in a row. I changed around some of the ingredients the second day to suite our taste and used the Costco canned chicken instead which made it quick & easy. I also followed others advice to bake & that was way better than fried!!

We absolutely LOVED these! They were SO fast and easy to make:) I added about 3/4 cup sour cream to the chicken mixture for creaminess. I also stuffed the mixture in egg roll wrappers, and cooked on 425 for 10 min on each side. They were AWESOME!

Love this recipe except I don't fry the egg rolls I bake them at 350 for approx. 10 minutes (assuming the filling is still warm, 30 minutes if made ahead of time. Serve with sour cream and Ortega Medium Hot Sauce mixed together (my husband calls this Awesome Sauce). Every time I make this I get requests for the recipe.

I've made this a couple of times and every single time I make it I get rave reviews. I have tried the deep frying method listed and baking, comes out good both ways. Also when I don't have the patience to wrap the rolls, I serve this as a fancy dip with tortilla bowls. Great!

I can't believe I made Southwestern Egg Rolls and they taste good!  I left out the chicken and didn't measure anything.  I also used traditional egg roll wrappers and it worked out perfectly.  Baked 12 minutes per side at 425 degrees with Pam Cooking Spray.  They're nice and crispy.  Thank you for the recipe.  Will make again.

These where pretty good I followed the recipe except I do not like Hot peppers so I did not add those. I am not sure that I will make this again mainly because it is a very time consuming recipe. Though it looked really nice and colorful. Thank you for the recipe.

These things are amazing. We served them with guacamole and sour cream for dipping for those who desired to do so.  I used 8" tortilla shells (because that's what we had in the fridge) and doubled the filling mixture, if you do this don't overstuff the tortillas or the outside cooks faster than the filling and you end up with a barely warm center.  Keeping them the diameter as shown on the picture probably works best. I cut back just a little bit on the amount of jalapeno used and it had just the right amount of kick. Can't wait for football season to roll around so I have an excuse to make them more often!

Awesome knock-off! My husband asked me to add this recipe to our weekly menu. I made all of the recommended changes from the most helpful review. I highly recommend using flour tortillas (corn don't wrap as well) and deep-frying. The texture and taste was perfect. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I used egg roll wrappers and browned the egg rolls in a little oil on the stove. The filling was DELICIOUS and turned out great. I will definitely make these again.

Great recipe!  Filling is delicious and would be great as a filling for other Mexican dishes as well.  I don't recommend using Spring roll wrappers as others had tried.  When I used them they were entirely too thin and hard to manage.  Horrible texture (slimy when trying to fill them).  Tortillas gave a better mexican taste and texture!  I also baked instead of frying to keep down calories/fat.

This recipe is awesome!  It tastes almost identical to Chili's southwest eggrolls.  We used lowfat, lowcarb, wheat tortillas and they still turned out amazing!  We also just used a little bit of oil in the frying pan and just kept turning it until it was browned and crispy--to save on a little bit of fat from frying it.

Wow! These were great!!  I used the egg roll wrappers as many suggested.  Next time, I think I'll try the flour tortillas.  I think it will give them more of a Mexican flavor.  Followed the recipe exactly, yum!

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed these.  For the most part, I followed the original recipe.  However, as suggested by other reviewers, I used egg roll wrappers.  I also added some additional seasoning to the chicken when cooking it the first time.  Next time, I will briefly fry, then bake.  I will add avocado to the mixture.

These were very tasty and easy to make. I also baked them as other reviewers suggested and they came out somewhat crispy.  In my opinion deep fried would be best.  I also ommited the spinach and served with a spicy southwestern ranch dip. Thanks I will definately make again.

These were very good.  Served with Amy's creamy cilantro dip (this site).  I used leftover chicken taco meat and sprayed with cooking spray and baked at 425 about 15 min - turned out crunchy.  I tried wonton wrappers (for an appetizer version) and 8 inch tortillas.  I thought the tortillas were a little thick so next time I'll use egg roll wrappers.  Make sure you use enough cheese or the mixture will be too dry.  Very good, even the next day.

Thee taste like the ones I love from Chili's. I suggest using pepper jack cheese though. You could even omit the minced jalapenos if you do that.

This is a great recipe.  I did take the advise of other reviews to bake these at 450 degrees for about 15 minutes - very nice and crispy.

I mostly followed the recipe.  I added extra chicken, spinach and corn.  I did not include the beans.  I also added tobasco to add an extra kick.  I sprayed both sides of the tortillia with cooking spray before cooking.

Next time I will add chopped green chilies. 

My husband is on Weight Watchers and this is approximatley 7 points per serving - that is using 2.5 chicken breast.

These were really good.  I sprayed with cooking spray and baked at 475 for 12 minutes.  I also used the chopped jalepenos that are jarred (in the produce dept with the jarred minced garlic).  I added a bit more chicken (boiled in garlic and salt then shredded) and corn.  They were a hit even with my picky husband.  Thanks for sharing

These were awesome, next time I'll see if I can find egg roll wraps or something similar since the tortilla's are too big. I added avacado and a bunch more red peppers, so good! They bake nicely too!

so good! i omitted the chicken as i am a vegetarian and actually forgot to pick up spinach so added extra beans and corn. i also baked instead of fried them (350 for about 25 mins) and they were heavenly. served them at a party with ranch dressing and they were gone within minutes.

This recipe is very close to ones you get when dining out. I made these for my family and they have been raving about them ever since! I only added carrots, shredded, celery, garlic, green pepper, red onions all minced and sauted. I used flour tortillias and deep fried them and also used a sour cream dipping sauce. Very Very good and this recipe is a keeper!!!

I quadrupled this recipe for a party, and made them with egg roll wrappers rather than tortillas. I didn't freeze for the full four hours -- probably not even two -- but they still came out great. The egg roll wrappers, sealed with a bit of water at the edge, hold together very securely. After I fried them (no deep fat fryer, so did this in about 1.5 inches of oil in a deep skillet on medium high), I blotted them on paper towels and put on a foil-lined cookie sheet in a 200 degree oven to keep warm. Except for the frying, a pretty low maintenance party appetizer. I served these with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce, and both were AMAZING - this is definitely a show-stopper recipe!!

These were almost as good as Chili's southwest egg rolls.  Very simple to make.  My only complaint is that they did not hold their rounded shape.  I also suggest that you double or triple the batch so you can have some for back-up in the freezer.

AWESOME! Everyone at works now believes I am an awesome cook. I told them I just followed the directions. However, I did use red, orange and yellow bell peppers. I also used hot peppers instead of jalepenos (WEAR GLOVES WITH CHOPPING HOT PEPPERS) I didn't know this and had burning hands for a couple painful hours!! I also added black beans. I deep fried because everything fried seems to taste good. The only change I will make next time is to make my own flour tortillas. Store bought are thick, which was good, but would be better with a thinner wrapping. I will make a lot next time, freeze and keep on hand as this was a little time consuming for me. My husband is a plain eater (Meat and Potatos) and he Loved these...Amazing Thank you

Although I did change this recipe to suit what I had on hand, this was excellent! I used won ton wrappers and baked them in the oven after spraying them with a little oil. I omitted the cayenne and jalepeno so my kids wouldn't complain...but these were very tasty! We dipped them in a combination of salsa and plain yogurt. Delicious!!! Thank you!

These taste even better than the ones at Chili's and are better for you if you bake them!!!  I made the filling as stated and ended up with 8 egg rolls, I did not freeze them but put them in a 450 degree oven for about 12 minutes. I flipped them halfway through so they would be crispy on all sides and served them with Amy's cilantro cream sauce from this website. My husband gave them rave reviews and wants me to make them again soon!!

I made these tonight and they were excellent. I followed the advise of other reviewers and baked mine.  I sprayed them with cooking spray before baking at 475 degrees for 10 minutes.  I think I'll lower the temp to 450 next time because the edges got a little too brown before the rest of the roll browned. I had wondered what to do with the partial package of frozen spinach left over since my family doesn't like spinach. But after eating these, I realize that won't be a problem.  I plan to buy the ingredients to make another batch tomorrow and freeze them for weekend ballgames! Definitely a keeper.

These were awesome!  I added bacon and a bit of coriander just because of personal tastes.  Even my picky 5-year-old loved them!

These are great, but much better deep fried instead of baked.  Not as healthy, but much better tasting.

this was wonderful!!! I did leave out the spinach as no one in my houseld cares for it.  Doubled the recipe to make 10 rolls.  Then, I cooked right away on a cookie sheet.  I sprayed the sheet with canola spray and then on top of the rolls after placing on the sheet.  Cooked in 425 degree oven until brown.  I just like to fry food a little as possible.  Maybe next time I will try Pinto beans for a different flavor.

This recipe is awesome. I crave the ones from chilis and they were perfect. The mixture alone could be used for soft flour tacos. I made avacado ranch to go with them. My family and neighbors all loved them!

These are fantastic:)  I used tortillas and baked them in the oven for a healthier dinner, plus less mess.  Still great.  I only had pepper jack cheese and an orange pepper, but that seemed to work fine.  I will continue to make these.  Super great and fairly easy!

I sort-of liked this dish. My biggest problem was it didn't make enough filling. I should have figured that out sooner because most of the ingredients are in tablespoons. I didn't fry them, I baked them instead. However, I think frying them is the better way to go taste wise. Also, I baked them at 475 degrees they got too dark on the edges. I turned it down to 425 degrees and they did better. I also had on hand won-ton wrappers and just used those instead of the egg roll wrappers. I was trying to make these like Applebee's Fiesta Wrappers. I think they came semi-close but weren't creamy enough. If I make them in the future, I think I will keep making them in the won-ton wrappers, freeze them and then fry them. I might also had a touch of cream to the mixture to make it creamier.

Fantastic! I did add a few things...juice of one lime, added some chicken stock to the mixture once all the ingredients were in the the pot (seemed a bit dry), 1 tsp green chiles, didn't bother with the cheese/onion (didn't miss it) and used egg roll wrappers. LIGHTLY brushed oil on egg rolls and baked at 425 for 25 mins. Served with Amy's Cilantro Sauce!  Next time will double recipe and stock the freezer!

Really delicous!  I quadrupled the recipe, used a can of chile peppers instead of jalapenos, and had enough filling for about 30 rolls (recipe yield x4 is 20).  I opted to bake these after brushing with canola oil.  I baked at 475 degrees for 15 minutes per other reviewers' suggestions and they came out crispy and cooked through (I cooked from the frozen state).  I served these with ranch dressing mixed with diced avocado, like Chile's.  My husband and I both thought these tasted just like Chile's SW egg rolls, but a bit healthier due to being baked.  Now I have leftovers in the freezer that I can bake for a quick dinner.

These are a lot of work, but well worth it I think. I quadrupled the recipe to make about 20, but I only got 18 out of it. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Didn't freeze at all, only put in a 9X13 baking dish, sprayed with vergetable oil, and baked at 425 for 10-15 minutes. The only thing, I didn't love, was the flavor the cheese gave. Next time, I might try cheddar or mozzarella cheese. All in all, pretty good recipe!

This recipe is fantastic! It takes some extra work, but it is well worth it! I used a box of frozen chopped chicken and wonton wrappers instead of tortillas. I doubled the recipe, but I should have quadrupled it! I made them the night before, put em in the freezer, and fried them before work. After tasting them, my husband suggested I leave the eggrolls at home and just take a bag of chips for the potluck! Everyone LOVED them and wanted the recipe, even without dipping sauce! I would recommend making extra just to keep in the freezer ready to fry up anytime!

Mixed thoughts. Tried some baked & some fried. The baked ones you could taste the spice, but the fried ones couldn't. We had 8" tortillas & had plenty of filling, but to much tortilla. Might try using egg roll wrappers next time since we like crispy & this reminded me of my fried burritos. Don't taste the mixture while cooking because it is real spicy (took my breath away), but don't make changes since it does calm down from the freezing. Will make again because we did like them.

Amazingly yum. I baked instead of frying & increased the filling ingredients (which I could have eaten by itself with a spoon) to make 8 total rolls. Looking forward to leftovers for lunch today!

They turned out great. I prepared them and froze them overnight and fried them in deep fryer for lunch the next day. Wife gave them the thumbs up and asked for me to make double the next time so we could freeze the rest to some on hand. We used Hidden Valley Ranch Fiesta Dip with them. I think I will make at least a double recipe next time and freeze extras for a quick meal or snack. Definately use the toothpicks and make sure you also put one in at the middle of the roll to keep the end (middle) from curling up during the deep frying process for a nicer serving appearance.

these were a definate hit!!  They are a little time consuming but well worth it.  I served them with Amy's cilantro cream sauce [as many others have recommended] I also used fresh corn tortillas since I live in Mexico they are very easy to come by.  The only thing was that I found them hard to roll into the little package so instead I made taquito or cigar shapes.  I did not deep fry but instead after the 4 hrs in the refrig I basted them with a bit of oil and baked them.  Next time I will try the egg roll wrappers and try them in the oven as well!  thanks

I omitted the Chicken and still got compliments. I also used eggrolls wraps, and the only reason I did not give this recipe 5 stars is because they were VERY greasy. I drained them on paper towels and everything but they were a bit too greasy for me and even my husband (which says ALOT!!) 
Maybe next time I will just spray them with Pam and try the oven??

Absolutely fantastic! Debated on whether to use egg roll wraps or tortilla-went with tortilla! Went easy with hot spices. Coupled it with the Cilantro Cream sauce (from AllRecipes). Did them in oil, (Canola) instead of the oven - not too oily after sitting on paper towels in warm oven. HIGHLY recommended - my 1st -5- rating!

I absolutely love the eggrolls at Chilis and now I can have them at home! I took the advice of others and opted for cilantro instead of parsley and baked them with a little oil brushed on to make them crispy. I know I will make these again and again!

Everyone just loved these!!!  I only made a few changes.  I didn't use spinach as I didn't think they needed it.  I used Egg roll wrappers instead and I didn't freeze them.  I just fryed them after making and they came out so wonderful.  I will make these again for sure.  My husband has requested I make a huge batch this week and we just ate them yesterday, lol.

This recipe is awesome! It was created by Todd Wilbur at Topsecretrecipes.com. It is his clone of the Chili's Southwestern Eggrolls.

Excellent!  I will definitely double/triple the recipe next time.  I used egg roll wrappers, fresh baby spinach, and pepperjack cheese. Baked @425 for 15 or so minutes. Like these better than the restaurant's version!

These are AMAZING.  everyone loved them.  I mixed white cheedar in with the cheese and the flavor was even better.  In addition, I wrapped them in red (tomato) flour tortillas and that added a great touch of taste as well.  Then, after freezing, I baked them at 425 for 12 minutes.
Perfect.  Serve with cilantro cream dip

YUMMY!!
I have made these twice now & they are SO good. I am living abroad and could not find some of the ingredients, so I used pinto beans instead of black, green chili peppers instead of jalapeno, and cheddar cheese instead of monterrey jack --- these still turned out excellent w/ all of the substitutions. This southwestern eggroll recipe is so delicious just like the ones at Chili's. Thanx for sharing :)

These are just like the popular appetizer served at Chili's. Don't stuff them too full or they won't get done. It's fine to fry them with the toothpicks still inserted. They'll come out easily once the filling is hot. We served them with a spicy ranch dressing as a dipping sauce and our guests loved them.

These turned out GREAT!!! I trippled the recie and altered it a bit by just adding the whole can of corn and black beans and a whole box of spinach just like one of the suggestions I saw here. (It would have just gone to waste otherwise). I also used cilantro instead of parsley. My husband gave me the 2 thumbs up on this one. Thanks for the recipe!!

This was good. I used SHRIMP instead. I am just tired of chicken. I think you can probably use beef too. Also, I gave it 4 stars because its excellent with this side dip I found on another site. DIP: 1 10oz can Mexican style tomatoes, 4oz Cream Cheese, 1 cup loosely packed Cilantro and  1 1/2 garlic cloves. Blend all until smooth. I served it with Mexican Rice and Salad for a Main Meal.Will hang unto it. Thanks.

Loved these!! Tweeked the recipe...but worth it. I used Perdue cut-ups (southwest style), 1/2 can mexi-corn, 1/2 can black beans, 1/2 can petite diced tomatoes with jalepenos, 3 green onions, 1/2 diced red pepper, 1/2 (3.5 oz) can diced green chilies, and 2 generous handfuls of Mexican shredded cheese.... I also used eggroll wrappers! Made 18 of the yummiest eggrolls ever. I served them with Mexican Rice and Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce also on this site. Excellent! Will make again soon!

This recipe was so good but a little challenging to make. I am not that great at wrapping tortillas. It was well worth it though! As a great dip for these I added 1 T chili powder to 1 C ranch dressing. Delicious!!

Awesome recipe. I used corn tortillas and lots of cilantro. Mine were in the freezer for one week before I fried them (only had olive oil and my husband liked the flavor that it imparted). Had problems getting the toothpicks out but as soon as they started to cook on one side, they loosed up and came right out. Dipped in ranch dressing. Served with a really cold beer with a wedge of lime squeezed in. Yummy!

Unbelievable!!  I served these with a "sauce" made out of sour cream thinned down with salsa picante.  Gone in twenty seconds!!  They were so good!  The only thing I changed was that I added habaneros instead of jalapenos because we like the extra heat.

Since this recipe only makes 5 eggrolls, save yourself sometime and triple or quadruple the recipe and freeze them for another day

Very good!  I also baked them instead, to save on fat and calories, and they were yummy!  I did 425 for about 15 minutes.  I used the larger tortillas also, I had a hard time with the small ones, maybe next time I will try the egg roll wraps.  My husband and son ate them all up and I served them with ranch mixed with salsa!

This recipe is simply unbelievable.  These eggrolls are a favorite of my husband and me.  We love to eat them for supper with sour cream.  They really don't need any other condiment.

Great!  It's nice to be able to freeze an appetizer ahead of time -- all you do is pop them in oil.  They tasted like something you would find in a restaurant chain -- I got a lot of compliments!  I used flour tortillas, but next time I might try regular egg roll wrappers to cut down on time.  Either way, DELICIOUS!

Been making these for years- sometimes as egg rolls (using wonton/egg roll wrappers as another reviewers suggested) but I've also hollowed out a bread bowl and used that or just used the filling as a dip. All were well received! Other changes- add a can of diced green chiles, swapped parsley for cilantro, added a few squirts of lime and don't be stingy with the spinach!

These are delicious! I've made them several times, and everytime I do, someone wants the recipe.  Grace not tried eggroll wrappers yet... the family prefers the tortillas. These freeze very well after baking/ frying if you wanted to make extra for an easy cook night the weekdays!

Great recipe. Rolls are very much like those at Chili's. I dice and marinate the chicken in the same spices, olive oil, and lime juice. I also use egg roll wrappers.

It was a really good recipe, i just simplified the cooking process. I used black beans, corn and spinach from a can. I used egg roll wrapping paper instead of tortilla shells. I cooked bell peppers, corn, spinach, beans ( all ingredients except chicken) all in one skillet, sauteed in my own special sauce). Marinated chicken overnight, then browned and chopped them up, added it to the skillet with the rest of the ingredients and seasonings. 

Rolled it up in egg rolls and baked it in light virgin oil for 15 minutes, then flipped it over and cooked it an extra 10 min on 350. The shells were nice and semi crunchy. It's an excellent recipe but it will be better next time as I now know what to do. Used honey mustard dipping sauce and ranch for dipping. It was a hit and everyone loved it. I need to make more next time so I will triple the recipe as opposed to doubling it.

BETTER IDEA! This is great but why bother wrapping it in a flour tortilla or eggroll wrapper. INSTEAD....in a small pan deep fry a couple of pieces of flour tortillas or egg roll wrappers. Mix all of the other ingredients in a bowl and crumble the fried choice on top. Drizzle with an avacado ranch dressing.

I can't make them fast enough for my husband.  I did add another ingredient just as a matter of convienence for my husband who takes them to work.  I added Picanta Sauce to each of them so my husband doesn't have to mess with dunking them in a small bowl of the sauce.

I triple or quadruple the ingredients and freeze at least half of them. We do them with egg roll wrappers and bake them on parchment at 400-450 until they are bubbling out deliciousness.

These egg rolls are delicious! I omitted the jalapeños, since I’m not a fan, and I amped up on chili powder. So much flavor! I used wonton wraps and fried the rolls in my air fryer to be healthy, but next time I’ll try the good and old oil, because the rolls became a little tough...

Make it as is! Don’t bake it, don’t change it, and then it’s great! One in my picture re was made as written. The other based on a reviewer’s version. Thankful I tried this out before a party or I’d have been embarrassed. If you don’t want to fry, the filling is also awesome in a soft tortilla.

I made a dozen of these for my husband's recent hunting trip. Followed the ingredients exactly. 
The only change I made was that I sealed and coated them with an egg white wash and baked them at 350 instead of frying. They came out AMAZING ! I will save this for future road trips and camping.

My daughter made it the first time and it was a disaster (her fault for not freezing for at least 4 hours).  The freezing keeps it from unraveling in the oil which will leave it a hot mess....literally!  I stepped in the second time and froze it overnight and left the toothpicks in while frying.  I am not sure if the oil temp was too high (medium?) but it was already very dark brown 1/2 through the cooking time.  I had to remove it to keep from burning.  The inside was warm (not hot) and the outside was overcooked.  Frying adds nothing to the taste other than grease.  I made a separate batch by baking according to the other reviews and it was a huge hit....surprisingly crispy and we will be making that again as otherwise, the filling per recipe is quite delicious (minus the jalapeños per my taste).

I found a prepackaged frozen bag of southwest vegetables with everything listed here, used all the spices listed above, sautéd in a skilled, added cheese, warmed tortillas, rolled filling in tortillas and baked the tortillas for 10 min at 400 degrees. AMAZING!!

This is a 5* meal but I have a few suggestions. 
1. Make sure you add plenty of veggies. Use a whole bag of spinach, chopped up, trust me on this one. The spinach will shrink so you'll need enough.

2. To get the best out of this meal, use the original eggrolls instead of tortillas; if you use the tortillas, make sure they are thin because I used regular but I most definitely prefer the eggrolls.

3. Make some chicken fried rice with this as it will a great meal. This recipe is dead on, it tastes just like the egg rolls from chili's. You will love it.

This is absolutely delicious!!! I made this and everyone in the family enjoyed it.  I did some in tortilla shells, baked, and then we ate the rest without the tortilla shells. Will definitely make this again. I did not freeze and the whole meal took me about 30 minutes to cook!!! I read some of the reviews about the flavor being bland.  I kept taste testing mine throughout cooking. For us, we like it a little spicy we used more seasoning. This will be added to our meal rotation!!!

This was a simple easy recipe.  I did make sure the chicken had some flavor to it, I season the chicken very well before cooking it. I added some season salt, garlic powder, a little hot sauce.  I made this for a football party and our guest loved them.

Absolutely the best! The only alteration I made was to use garlic jack cheese, and that only because that was all the store had shredded and I didn’t want to shred. I used the avocado dip recipe someone else posted in their review and it was delicious! Made them two days ahead and froze, then fried in an electric fry pan. I would have preferred the oven but I had other things in it.

I added 1/4 cup black beans and instead of corn I used corn salsa and fried in egg roll wrappers. With a homemade southwestern ranch as a dipping sauce. Yummmmmmmyyy

I doubled the ingredients and used wonton wrappers the second time. My family liked them better and they didn’t fall apart like the tortillas shells. We also preferred deep frying but I didn’t freeze them. Just  have to drain them on a paper towel well to get as much oil out as possible.

I doubled the recipe and made 12 eggrolls and still had filling for a few more and I even forgot the black beans.  That's ok, the filling is good over lettuce as a salad.

I use cilantro when I make this excellent  filling.  The filling  is
also great when used to fill Quesadillas (and eliminates the freezing step).

What a complete waste of time and money!!!!!   As soon as you put frozen rolls in oil, they open up and are completely ruined!!!   Followed recipe exactly!   I wish I could give -50 stars.  What a joke!

Made this recipe as close to the original as I could, except tripled the ingredients to make more.  I was trying to use up egg roll wrappers that I had leftover after making pork egg rolls, so that is one change I made.  I baked them at 450 for 13 minutes.  Although they were delicious, they would have been better fried and I might just go for it next time.  I just didn't want to deal with the mess.   If I was in a hurry I'd bake them again but brush oil on the outside of the wrapper first.  I used 1/3 cup of filling per wrapper and yielded 12 egg rolls.  Made the dipping sauce suggested by one of the top reviewers.  They were delicious and very much like those made famous by a certain restaurant!

I added a smear of re-fried beans on tortilla because I had some left-over. I also made some with egg roll wrappers. Both came out great. Family even said "good" for once.

Loved this recipe. I did not freeze these but right after wrapping them I put them on a cookie sheet and sprayed them with vegetable oil and baked them for 10 minutes at 450 degrees. Delicious. I will be making these again and again.

These were delicious. My only piece of advice is look for thinner tortillas. The brand I used is a little thicker. It was difficult to get them to roll as I wanted them to. The rolls ended up being a little thicker than I would have liked so I covered them and put them in the oven for a bit to make sure they were cooked all the way through. Totally my fault and not an issue with the recipe! Great recipe! Will definitely make again!

I have made this multiple times. Next planned is doing it in the airfryer.  

Today, I doubled the recipe and used the filling as a dip.

I've been making this recipe for over a year now and this will be the first time actually  frying the rolls. I've primarily baked the rolls, used spring roll wrap, rice wrap, wonton wraps for mini rolls and flour. I used the spring roll wrap for the fry and they came out excellent , reminiscent of lumpia with that awesome crunch! Awesome in a variety of ways, thanks!

Great recipe. Had to make a few substitutions for my familie's tastes, but all in all, great recipe.  

I used left over taco ground beef instead of chicken, and removed  the jalapenos.  The cumin and chili powder were all the flavor needed with very little "heat".

I haven't made these yet, but intend to.  Being as I patronize "La Cholla" in Tucson ,which is where the chimichanga was invented, I think these are really just another chimi. if you want egg rolls, use wonton.

Okay, these were incredible. But I did make a few modifications. 

First of all, I forgot to grab spinach, so I saved myself another trip to the grocery store and made do without. It was just fine without, although I don't doubt spinach would be great in it as well. 

Secondly, the chicken I used happened to be leftover from the night before. A large chicken breast injected with a mixture of store-bought butter injection and store-bought garlic injection (about half and half). Lightly seasoned on top with salt and herbs, baked for 15 minutes. Then had extra injection spooned on top the chicken and baked for another 10 minutes. I shredded it instead of cubed it, and it was still so juicy and tender even after a day in the fridge. 

Lastly, like most people, I used eggroll wrappers instead of tortillas. I did fry mine because I wanted them a little crispier. But next time I will try baking, as it seemed to retain a tad too much grease when frying (that could have easily been my fault. I don't know). 

Dipped in ranch, these were so, so amazing. Just as good as the ones you buy from Chili's. Cannot WAIT to make these again, and look forward to bringing them to parties.

This is really good.  I've made as the actual eggrolls (using egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas).  tortillas are really difficult to roll and get them to stay closed.  This is also really good for soft tacos or just for making a southwestern bowl.  I serve over rice, and top with sour cream and guacamole.

Followed the recipe and after hours of prep time and waiting I ended up with a fried burrito with uncooked black beans I'm going to use a different website next time this was a waste of a dinner

Revised:  years later. Still a go to for a meal. Always a huge hit and leftovers don't disappoint!!


Make this as a casserole. Brown turkey in olive oil. Add green onions, bell pepper, jalapeno, cumin (lots), cayenne, salt/pepper,  chili powder.  Add corn, whole can of drained beans, a package of Uncle Ben 90 second rice of choice spinach and cheese and bake for about 20 min.  Serve with Fritos, Sour cream and cilantro. This is a go to for us that is no fail!

I have made this recipe for about 3 years now, and it's a favorite with my family and friends as a snack or appetizer. They're very filling and satisfying. I eliminate the parsley and spinach and replace it with cilantro. The egg rolls keep in the freezer for at least two months.

I used egg roll wrappers and cooked turkey, otherwise followed recipe. Note the small serving. quantity (5) this recipe makes as you may want to scale it up.  Excellent served with copycat avacado/sour cream/buttermilk sauce posted in a review.   Will definitely make again!

I sort of made this.  I made the filling as directed, but instead of deep-fried egg rolls, I put the filling into my pre-baked wonton cups for appetizers, then baked just long enough to heat through and melt the cheese.  Delicious this way!

These were good. I used the flour tortilla,but the next time I will use an egg roll wrap. The filling was delicious,but the flour tortilla was too much,it was like a chimichanga. I did add a 1/2 avocado to the mix. Looking at the photo,it looks as if they used an egg roll wrap.

Great recipe. Followed exactly as stated. No problems rolling if you do what the recipe says and moist heat the tortillas in towels to make them pliable. Keep the toothpicks in while frying. I served them with a delicious two ingredient taco cream sauce. Mix 16 oz of sour cream with 1 packet of taco seasoning. Let flavors set up overnight in the fridge. People always ask for both recipes.

Use egg roll wrappers instead! These were a huge hit at the group camping "fry frenzy" this past weekend. Easy and awesome appetizers.

This is my first near perfect success at deep frying. I choose this simply as practice knowing it would still be good. They were mostly intact after frying but as soon as I added them to the oil they unfurled. I think a simple fix would be to crimp the last bit of tortilla and not take the rolls out of the freezer until you're ready to place them directly into the grease.

I love them,,,, I usually buy them from a pizza place.  I made them and I followed this recipe exactly.  I froze them for 4 hours and fried them as the recipe stated, let them rest on top of some paper towels and allowed them to cool down for a few minutes. I dipped them in a Creamy Chili Sauce I made, that I found here on this site and they were  Mmmm Delicious. I put the left overs in the refrigerator for the next day, warmed them in the micro wave  and they were even better. Thank you for sharing,,,I will be making them again!

I love this recipe! I just make a couple changes:

I use egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas, and I use a can of chopped green chillies in lieu of  jalapeño. To account for the difference in heat, I up the cayenne pepper until it has enough bite.  Fantastic for parties! Made this for the Superbowl this year. So good!

I made this for my Christmas party and I think it was the best thing I made!  YUM!!  I didn't use the toothpicks, but just froze them with the seam facing down. They do puff up, but none of them came open during cooking!  I also used all of the meat of a rotisserie chicken, instead of using chicken breasts.  I will definitely make these again!

I followed the recipe exactly.  The trick to rolling them is being sure the tortillas are warm and soft.  The recipe made more than expected.  I also made Amy's cilantro cream sauce for dipping.  Amazing combination.

These are absolutely delicious. I follow this recipe as is but bake them at 450 for 15 minutes. They're always a huge hit wherever I take them. 

I almost forgot, I add extra cheese to everything, so I guess that's not "as is."

Very good - after reading other reviews, we made these with egg roll wrappers.  Something is missing that keeps us from giving it 5 stars - the next time we make it, we're going to try adding bacon and sharp cheddar (more cheese too).

This was an awesome recipe. I did make a few adjustments after reading previous reviews.  I used eggroll wrappers because that is what I had on hand. I didn't add chicken or spinach. I made 15. Took them to a party and they all went. Took home an empty plate!

These are ok. I made them in the oven. I barely added any cayenne pepper and certainly I should have added more.

I really loved this appetizer. It's one of my favorites from Chili's. Me personally, I like a little kick in my food therefore I would keep the seeds in the jalapeno. Also some say that it is difficult to use tortillas, but if you warm them up (in addition to buying large enough tortillas) you shouldn't have a problem. The only thing this recipe was missing was a sauce.

Wow!! This is absolutely delicious!! The only thing I did different is doubled the chicken and used egg roll wraps instead of the tortillas because I didn't have time to freeze them for 4 hours. Everyone in my house loved this and I will definitely be making these again.

The filling is definitely 5 stars.  I'm only rating the filling because I could not get my tortillas to roll.  So I just used the filling and corn tortillas to make tacos.  The filling tasted great.

I baked mine at 450 just like a previous comment said for a healthier version, added some garlic powder, creole seasoning and substituted minced green onion for purple onion.  I will be making this again it was a hit with my company and their kids.

This is one of my go-to recipes! I left out the bell peppers, and added chopped up chipotles in adobo and it was delicious! I like to serve them with an avocado sauce or ranch dressing. Great for parties!!

The spicy filling is wonderful.  We love southwestern food and this was a great new take on it.  And as an added bonus they were easy to make.  We loved them!  I used egg roll wrappers as I wanted to use them up.  I omitted the step of freezing which allowed me to make them for a weeknight dish.  Sprayed them, then baked at 450 for 10 mins.  Served with ranch dip but I would like to find a spicy avocado dip to try.

This was amazing, this recipe will be used again.  We did make a few changes, adding cilantro rather than parsley and adding sliced black olives.  We used a variety of sauces for dipping and quite amazed that anything worked!  Salsa, avocado, blue cheese, tzatziki, it was all good!

These were delicious!  For a variation I omitted all the spices including the salt and instead used a tablespoon of Fiesta Ranch Dry Salad Dressing/Seasoning mix and it was so wonderful I won't make them any other way!  

If you like spicy you could also add a bit of shredded pepperjack cheese.

Also, if you don't feel up to making your own dipping sauce Hidden Valley Spicy Ranch (the bottled dressing) was a great compliment.

Easy & yummy. Filling smelled delicious! It was heavy on the cumin, next time I'll be halving it and adding more spinach. I think a little cream cheese would be good, too - they were in the dry side, but i did bake them instead of frying so that's probably why.

Came out really good! I baked them instead of frying and then didn't come out as crispy as I would've liked. Next time I will try frying them instead. I also added a little extra seasoning than suggested.  I will definately make again!

These were so, so, so delicious!  I tried the recipe because I've had something similar at a restaurant and I loved them.  These were even better because they were so fresh!  I did use egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas.  That is how I'd had them and I love the thin flaky texture of egg roll wraps better than the heavier tortillas.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe perfectly.  AMAZING!!

These were pretty good.  I baked mine and did not freeze them first.  They crisped up nicely.  We thought they were significantly better the second day.  I doubled the recipe and got eight total.  Next time I will reduce the jalapenos a bit as they were a little too spicy for us.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

I doubled the batch & cut in 1/2 for "happy hour" around the pool.  Everyone loved them.  Used Amy's dipping sauce.  I must respond the the person who wrote corn does not belong in Mexican dishes.  They sell cobs of corn on the streets in Mexico, there is corn in almost every Mexican dish.  They use corn masa for tamales and corn husks to cook them.  It is a staple down there.  It's like saying garlic doesn't belong in Italian dishes.

These were good but I did change a few things. First off, I trippled the recipe because I needed more than five. I also used eggroll wrappers instead and boiled my chicken instead of frying it. I also baked them instead of deep frying them. I also used extra virgin olive oil. Will definitely make again but will probably lower the amoung of jalapeno peppers.

These were fabulous! We didn't have time to freeze them so we substitued egg roll wrappers (instead of tortillas) and baked them for 20 minutes at 425 (turning 3/4 way through). Turned out great! Cut them in half and served with a mixture of ranch and sirracha for dipping. Definitely will make these again!

Very Yummy!!!! We did not keep them in the fridge that long because we had no time. We also used an egg wash to keep the tortillas from opening when frying.  Turned out GREAT!!!!

Sooooo good!  I have made many many recipes from this website, but this is the first one I took the time to review!  They're that good.  Here are the little changes I made: 1) I used canned chicken, so no need to cook; 2) extra red pepper; 3) double the spinach and I used fresh spinach - just rinse and place wet spinach in small pot.  Cook over med-high heat for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until wilted.  Let cool and then squeeze dry; 4) diced green chilis instead of jalapenos; 5) cilantro instead of parsley; 6) Pepper Jack cheese; 7) wrap in egg roll wrappers; 8) bake 350* for 10 minutes, flip over, and cook another 10 minutes.  I also made with Amy's cilantro lime sauce from this site.  YUMMMM!

I follow this recipe almost entirely and it absolutely ROCKS! Only change: don't bother with tortillas and use actual egg roll wrappers. Spoon small amounts of mixture into wrapper and seal with a dab of whisked egg. No need to freeze. Just arrange them in an oversized tupperware with wax paper between stacked rows. Stick in fridge until ready to fry. It's a good idea to make a huge batch since there's so much chopping, etc. Freeze any extras. I'm no Rachel Ray, but I ALWAYS get compliments when I bring a batch of these babies to parties!

These are great!  I doubled up on the cumin and added a little extra salt.  I did add in a little cabbage but I just wanted that extra crunch.  Served with some homemade wonton soup!  5 stars!

Tastes just like the restaurant appetizer! I omitted the spinach, but kept to the recipe aside from that. I sprayed with Pam, baked for 15min @ 450 and they were perfect!  Used Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce from this site as a side- dh & the fam loved it, I prefer just sour cream.

I used the low carb, 80 calorie each tortillas and pan browned these. With the calories saved, I added a little sliced avocado. I have no idea why the freezing step is there. (Unless you want to make these in large batches and save for later.) So I skipped that. I added a little diced purple onion. I  feel you really should spend a few extra pennies and buy the super sweet frozen white corn.  And a salsa ranch dressing is the perfect dip for these.

These were awesome but a little too spicy. I would tone down some of the seasoning. I baked mine fresh at 450 for 10 minutes, which is what someone else had done. I also froze some. They need cooked a little longer.

I have been looking for this type of recipe since I had something like this at a restaurant and these are PERFECT.  I didn't change a thing, and they came out very good.  I tried them with "Amy's Cilantro Sauce" as suggested by many other reviews, but I didn't think it was necessary.  Great recipe!

Excellent!! One of my favorite things at Chili's is the Southwestern Egg Rolls and these come very close..only healthier!    I baked mine at 450 for 15 minutes in a 9x9 baking dish sprayed with non-stick cooking spray. I also sprayed the tops of the Egg Rolls once they were in the dish to help brown them..they came out crispy and light.     I dipped them in store-bought creamy avocado dip. I will definitely be making these from now on!

These are so Yummy!!! I doubled the recipe and used egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas. I lightly brushed them with olive oil and baked them at 350 for 20 minutes. They were perfect. We liked to dip them in ranch dressing. They tasted just like what you'd get at Chili's or California Pizza Kitchen! Will definitely make these again!!!

The filling in this was good but maybe needs a little more moisture. I used a whole can of black beans and used egg roll wrappers. Lightly baked and then refrigerated for party next day. Came out soggy from fridge and when I heated back up, they were kind of rubbery. Have to try a different method next time.

I just made these today for the superbowl and they are AMAZING!  Everyone loved them and my husband says they taste just like Chili's restaurant's.  I skipped the freezing step and I fried them on med-high heat in a skillet of peanut oil since I don't have a deep fryer.  Definitely plan on making again!

OMG this was delish! I made two batches, one the regular recipe (taking the cuminm, cayenne and chili powder down to just a sprinkle for each because I really don't like too much spice). I used flour tortillas anf froze for four hours, but baked at 425 for 10 min. The second batch I didn't freeze at all, just baked right after rolling. I would make these every single night if I could! I served them with refried beans and sour cream. The next day I had a couple left over and microwaved them for a couple minutes, and they were just as good! This chicken mixture is even good in a salad with greens! Very versatile recipe, and the good thing is you can really tailor the specific ingredients to your taste if you follow the basic recipe of the chicken, corn, beans and spices. I added about 3 times the spinach and only a small handful of chesse to the second batch, and it was just as good!! Love it, and will definitely make it again and share it with everyone!

Very good. I doubled the meat, excluded the spinach, used cilantro instead of parsley cause that's what I had, and also used spring roll wrappers instead of tortilla shells. These turned out awesome and everyone loved them. I highly recommend dipping them in "amy's cilantro cream sauce". It's a perfect match. I will definitely make these again.

These are the best!  I took the advise of others and used a store bought roasted chicken.  Left out the onions and baked them instead of frying.  Served with sour cream and salsa on the side.  Great for dinner or an appetizer.

I love this recipe and have experimented with it several times.  I bake these instead of frying to cut back on the fat.  I have tried both egg roll wrappers and flour tortillas, and much to my surprise we prefer the flour tortillas hands-down!  I really thought that the egg roll wrappers would be the winner, and perhaps they would have been if I had fried them.  But when I bake them, the egg roll wrappers have a strong flour taste and are very bland.  Perhaps I am doing something wrong?  But the flour tortillas worked perfect.  Baking them totally changes their taste and texture;  they are crispy and flavorful.  I also tried using vegetarian "chick'n" instead of real meat, and there was no change whatsoever in the taste or texture. I used Cedar Lake brand chick'n strips made from soy and grain protein.  Even meat-eaters can't tell the difference.  I will definitely make this recipe again and again, but I will always bake instead of frying and continue to use veggie chick'n instead of real meat, which is easier, cheaper, and healthier anyway.   This is a super easy, economical and fast recipe - 5 stars!

I used this as filling for pre-baked phyllo dough cups (buy in the freezer section with pie crusts) instead of frying tortillas or egg roll wrappers.  It was much faster and made easy, bite-sized appetizers.  Plus, I didn't have the smell of fried food lingering in my house.  This recipe was a HUGE hit at the events I have taken it to.  For my versions, it was a little dry, so I now add a can of roasted diced tomatoes to it.  This is now my default dish to prepare for gatherings.  It really is as good as everyone says it is.  We even put it on baked tortilla chips one night for a reasonably healthy, but flavorful, dinner!

I thought the flavor of this was very good, but I think next time I will try it vegetarian as the chicken gave it a chewy texture the way it says to cook it. Maybe boil the chicken instead of frying it if you want to add that. They did all get eaten at the party so maybe it was just me.

Really yummy!  Per the suggestions I baked mine instead of fried them and I left out the spinach.  They were delicious and even my picky eaters liked them.  They were also great as leftovers.  I just popped them in the toaster oven to warm them up and they stayed nice and crispy.

Delicious filling that I could eat with a spoon. I used small flour tortillas - a little difficult to roll up - and baked them after spraying liberally with nonstick cooking spray. Went really well with the Creamy Cilantro Dip.

These were so delicious!  I followed the instructions of another reviewer and baked them in the oven instead of frying them.  In my opinion, they turned out just as good, if not better than ordering them at a restaurant (not to mention much cheaper!).

I've made these twice.  They are fabulous!  I wanted to make them lower in fat, so I used Weight Watchers cheese.  The filling is gooey enough they didn't need to be frozen before baking as others had suggested, 10 minutes at 450.  Thanks for the recipe!

amazing rolls!  I took the suggestions of others and baked for 15 minutes at 450, turning over halfway thru.  best idea ever!  I served with a sour cream taco dip (sour crm, mayo & taco seasoning) and they didn't last but 10 minutes on the table. I also doubled the recipe and cut them in half.

These are JUST like Chili's southwest eggrolls...actually, I've been told they're even BETTER than Chili's.  These are everyone's favorite appetiser.  I made these for Thanksgiving and for my niece's 1st birthday party and it was a BIG hit!  Measuring ingredients take too much time, so I just add as much as my heart desires.  No need to measure exact.  I always bake these eggrolls and they're so crunchy and golden brown!  As for a dipping sauce, I found a recipe for Jalepeno Lime sauce that goes great with it.  Hidden Valley Ranch dressing, chopped green chilies from the can, jalepeno peppers from the can and squeeze lime and blend and it's perfect

These egg rolls are so yummy.  I have never fried them, I just bake them for 10 minutes at 450.  I usually double this recipe because once I buy the frozen corn I have enough left over to double it...that way I don't waste the corn, beans, and such.  I usually freeze some (when I double it) that way I have dinner for another night!  You really should make Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce (on allrecipes) to go with this...they are amazing together!

Added a little extra of some ingredients to my liking. Wasn't sure how about it when I tasted the filling before frying, but it was outstanding. Served with Mexican rice and beans and sour cream and lettuce, and it's like mini chimichangas. Excellent dinner.

Yum Yum Yum......Very good recipe.  I did not use the spinach or parsley because I did not have any on hand.  Otherwise I followed directions, but doubled the cumin and chile.  Baked in oven using eggroll wrappers, and they turned out great!  NO reason to fry these!!!!  I am making them again Friday for my nephews birthday party, I think they will be a hit.  I made Cilantro cream sauce to dip them in!  Yummmmmmm

We loved these!  We used the tortillas although I'll try egg roll wrappers sometime as others suggested.  Also baked at 450 for 15 min rather than frying (no freezing) and they did great.  This is a new favorite for our family I'm sure!  Also, I didn't have black beans in my pantry so used pinto beans and they worked too.

This was amazing - I used egg roll wrappers instead, put in a pound of chicken, and I ended up with about 25-30 egg rolls.  For the chicken though, I cut it into 1 inch cubes and seasoned it with chili powder, garlic powder, EVOO, and sometimes a little sriracha sauce and let it marinate before I cook it, then I dice it up.  It adds a LOT more flavor that way. I also followed another reviewer's idea of leaving out the spinach.

I also make just the filling and then add a dash or two of soy sauce and roll it up in taco shells and eat it for dinner all the time :)

This is a very good recipe. Used all of the ingredients, but came up with my own porportions. Works out better if you customize a recipe to your liking. If you like more corn, add more corn! Just taste the filling before you stuff the eggrolls. One tip is eggroll filling can be made in advance, just don't add the cheese. Wait untill you ready to roll then put filling in a skillet and melt cheese. Or maybe microwave, but I'm not sure about that.... Will def make again! P.S. Does need some sort of sauce. I used sour cream/ salsa mixture, but nxt time will try something different. I also used eggroll wrappers

This was a hit! I tripled the batch, left out the spinach, skipped the freezing, and baked instead of fried. I used 10 tortillas (instead of the 15 I should have used since I tripled the batch), so they turned out to be more like burritos than egg rolls. Next time I'll add rice and substitute cilantro for the parsley. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I changed a lot of the recipe.

I have made this things several times now and everybody always loves them (including me). I usually just use what's on hand. Canned chicken works fine and is quicker. I have been omitting the spinach since it's not much and couldn't really taste it anyway; Pepper Jack instead of Monterey; and baking instead of deep frying. Still turn out great!

What a great flavor!  I was missing the black beans and jalapenos and they still were wonderful.  I tried these both with tortillas and won ton wrappers and prefer the taste/texture of the tortillas.  I also baked them with olive oil brushed on top and they came out nice and crispy.  I will definitely make it again.

I make mine with flour tortillas and fry them.  I have made these for three parties/holiday gatherings and EVERYONE raves about them.  They are usually gone before dinner starts and if someone doesn't grab one quickly they are  usually out of luck.  The Amy's Cilantro dip recipe goes perfect with them and is delicious on lots of other items such as a chip dip, fajitas, grilled chicken, etc.  As far as the eggrolls go, the only thing I change is I sub the parsley for cilantro like others have suggested. And as far as the chicken goes, canned chicken is what I use and is quick and blends well with the other ingredients.

These were delicious! I'm Vegan so I used the veggies only and Veggie Shreds (vegan cheese). They were pretty good. Next time I'll cut back on the bell pepper and increase the amount of beans, spinach and cheese. I'll also try the meat for my SO because he enjoyed them but mentioned, "where's the meat?" Haha! Thanks for sharing a lovely recipe.

Outstanding.  Not hard to make, but was surprised that there is no garlic in the recipe.  Added two whole cloves to the mixture and two to the chicken while it was sauteing.  Can't remember which person reviewed these, but the word is "voila", NOT "wala".  :)  Used egg roll wrappers and very pleased.  Made a sauce with ranch dressing and fresh avocado.

YUM YUM YUM!  I would make these at home in a heartbeat before ordering them at Chili's - they are even better!!  I too used egg roll wrappers and subbed cilantro for the parsley - I LOVE cilantro!  I doubled the recipe and got 15 good sized egg rolls.  Served with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce as recommended - this will become a 'show' meal for when we have company.  :)

Can I just say that "I LOVE THESE!" This is a great recipe base and you can use just about any veggie in your fridge! I make them all the time and put some in my freezer for a quick snack for my husband. He tells his friends that they have to try my "burrito rolls."  Thanks for this great recipe!

These didn't last long at all! I used egg roll wrappers and baked them. I made two more batches with pork and added some rice. Definitely a repeat. I will keep this one.

Excellent! It's easiest to have all of your ingredients prepped ahead of time, then just throw it all together quickly! I used egg roll wrappers & fried them im my deep fryer immediately after rolling all of them. They turned out perfect! I also served them w/Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce.

This was one of the best recipes! so delicious and easy to make!  I omitted the spinach and jalapenos.. Used Colby jack cheese (it was what i had in the kitchen) instead of monterey jack and in half the amount listed, cilantro instead of parsley and egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas, then baked instead of fried (450degrees, 10 minutes each side to make them crispy)(had to quadruple the recipe to completely use 20 large egg roll wrappers).  Also added slices of avocado while wrapping and before baking for a nice healthy meal.  came out so delicious we had it three meals in a row (didn't even make it to the freezer for future use).  now I'm not a good cook (i'm an eater not a cooker). this was so easy to make and it was the first time my husband couldn't get enough of the food! Goes PERFECTLY with Cilantro Cream sauce.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

These are absolutely yummy appetizers. However, I tripled the recipe because I was making it for a BBQ for about 100 people.  As far as modifying the recipe, I used the sweetest white frozen corn kernels I could find.  The baby spinach was frozen, thawed, & blotted dry before adding to the recipe.  The next time I make these I will definitely use the extra large egg roll wrappers.  They are more pliable and seal better than the tortillas, which were quite clumsy to work with and dried out before I could fold them.  Also, I found the recipe just a bit bland and wanted more 'zing' for my tastebuds, so I added some chopped cilantro and also some ground Chipotle spice (to taste).  Also added more Cayenne pepper, etc. until it was just right.  After pan frying the egg rolls, I sliced them diagonally and set them on end for better presentation.  The southwest egg rolls disappeared quickly at the BBQ. No leftovers to take home -- darn!  ;)

Really good..followed directions, except I left out the green onions (didn't have any on hand) I may try the cilantro instead of spinach as other people suggested. They are great even the day after! Thanks!

i always triple the recipe and spend some time on these to have lots in the freezer. i've never fried them but spray the tortillas with olive oil (when rolling) and bake them at 350-375 until they're golden-brown. when they're from the freezer it takes quite a while to get to golden-brown but they're totally worth it- delicious! just like the restaurant's!

YUM!  These are a favorite Friday-night movie dinner for us.  We use the egg roll wrappers, and I usually double or triple the filling to make extra for the freezer.    I always bake them, and they are always delicious!

I just made this last night for dinner and it was everything I'd been craving!!!  I need to get the knack of oven baking them but fried as a treat they were absolutely awesome.  My hunny even helped wrap them up (the easy part of course, but he gets points for trying) and he said it's getting on his list of special food requests second only to my rellenos de papa!  High praise, indeed.

EDIT: After making these again using tortillas and freezing beforehand I noticed I couldn't get them to cook all the way thru while frying. Probably my lack of oil thermometer.  To compensate, I fried them on medium low heat until golden brown, drained on a rack for a couple of minutes, and popped them in the microwave for 90 seconds.  This got them cooked thru and kept them crispy.  Next time, I'll skip freezing, seal the tortillas with water or egg wash and fry immediately.

EDIT: Sealing with an egg wash and placing seam side down for a little bit is the way to go.  Skip the toothpicks and freezing altogether.

This recipe was delicious! I am definitely holding on to it as a regular. I used five times the portions (I used the whole can of black beans which was 1 1/4 cups, and proportioned everything to that) and came out with 15 eggrolls. I also used eggroll wraps instead of tortillas. They were pretty spicy, but dipped in a sour cream and salsa mix cools it down and adds flavor.

The filling is delicious! I used egg roll wrappers and substituted cilantro for the parsley.   I got 10 egg rolls from this recipe, and baked half at 425 for 20 minutes.   They were good but I thought the wrapper was chewy.  I fried the others in 2 in. of canola oil.  No comparison - the fried ones were fantastic!  I can't wait to try these out at my next party!

I have been making these for my hubby for years. He loves them. I made them for a family gathering and literally cooked them on an open fire AMAZING the smokey flavor was a great addition. I have tried them with wonton wrappers, I did not care for them at all. The classic SW egg rolls are done with flour tortillias. Therefore i make them as they were meant to be. I do add extra hots and cyanne since we like our foods extra spicy. They are great just dipped in regular ranch dressing as well. I'm still looking for that over the top dip for on the side. Ohh yeah i also forgot, i use pepper jack cheese. Told ya we like it spicy!!

These are spot-on for Chili's Southwestern eggrolls!!!  There are Chili's in most large US airports, and when I return to the US after being out of the country for months or even over a year, I spend my layover time in Chili's and I always order the Southwest egg rolls.  Now, I can order something else.

I have tried A LOT of recipes on this site, and this is one of my absolute favorites--a recipe rock-star.  I omit the spinach and parsley and use cilantro instead.  Still awesome with less cheese.  Bake for 15 min. at 425.  DEFINITELY use spring roll wrappers instead of tortillas.  I get mine at an Asian market--they bake up super-crispy and wonderful!

I made mine with whole wheat tortillas because that is what we keep on hand and I baked instead of fried. I also froze them and baked a few when I wanted them. They were really good and taste just like the restaurants! I dipped in Amy's cilantro cream sauce from this site.

Excellent!!!  We follow the directions to a "T," but added green chillies and onion (sauteed them both).  We also had twice the amount of Monterey (1 1/2 cup) and a 1/2 cup of cheddar (great with Mexican/ southwestern food).  We also baked these and did it right out of rolling them (did not freeze), but we did think that freezing them would be good and deep frying would also be good for a change of scenery and for saving food and economic value.

fantastic I baked instead of fried and did not use spinach.  Instead of an itty bit of corn, onion, bell pepper I experimented and basically a balance of all the ingredients is great.  I did not freeze and fry.

Great base recipe. Bake (as others suggested) at 425 for 15 mins. I also skipped the cheese, to make these only 225 calories each! (4g fat/ 24 chol/ 200 sod/ 30 carb/ 2 sug/ 2 fiber/ 12 protein) Made avocado puree for dipping to make up for the lost creaminess of the cheese. Yum!

I made this and everyone loved it. I used the filling sauce parts to help the tortilla stick together when rolled instead of using a toothpick.  I baked it in the oven like everyone said and it turned out great.  My dad who is extremely picky said he LOVED it and that I should open up my own burrito shop he called it.  I'm making a huge batch for this week so they can freeze it. Yummy recipe~

Oh Boy! These are good. I basicly doubled the recipe, [maybe alittle more] I used a pound of ground pork, a whole can of black beans [drained] and just double on everything else. I'll make these again, when I do and I use the tortillas, I'm going to bake them. Frying these, with these wraps are a pain in the rear, they want to spread open. But if I fry them I'll use egg roll wrapers, those stay together alot better.

This is delicious! I made it twice for my roommate and friends in the past week and everyone loved it. I baked them at 400 for 12 minutes instead of freezing and frying. I also used cilantro instead of parsley. They would be better with some sort of dip, like a spicy ranch sauce. I think I'll try the cilantro cream sauce mentioned earlier next time!

These were so amazing that my hubby didn't believe I made them!  I baked them instead of frying them and I even forgot the cheese on the inside and they were still good.  I will be making them again soon because they were a big hit even with the kids.

Followed this recipe but opted for won ton wrappers as suggested in another review.  The rolls were a HUGE hit at our friend's party.  We will make these again for sure.

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY! This is rated high, because it is very easy and very very good! I froze them over night and baked at 350 for 20 minutes. Not sure freezing was neeeded, but it is good to know these can be frozen so I can make ahead for parties! Id love to try them fried next time!!

Great recipe.  I did use egg roll wrappers and did not realize until I was done that I had not put the cheese in.  They were terrific without it.  Have made several times - great served with a hot sauce for dipping.

We absolutely loved these "egg rolls" ... Very tasty stuffing and great having been deep fried! I do think though, that this dish needs a different name! Egg rolls reminds of Chinese food. A keeper for sure!

At first I was not going to use the spinach as called for in this recipe. I love spinach in all forms, however my dad and brother gag at the sight! But I decided to sneak it in there and they didn't even notice. Actually everyone in the household LOVED them...I got several compliments! I baked them instead of frying, that way I wouldn't feel so bad for smothering them in sour cream and avacados!

This is THE BEST appetizer recipe ever! I have never made anything this delicious. I don't cook too often, so my dishes tend to be average, but this was excellent! Everyone liked them, and said they taste just like the ones from Chili's (maybe even better). I followed the recipe exactly, except for the freezing time. I only had 1 hour, so I put toothpicks in them to keep them closed.

Sooo good. I made these with no onions and baked them for 12 min at 450.  I did come up with exactly five egg rolls.  They were gone!  I was waiting for one of my girls to not be able to finish the whole thing, but no such luck.  I had to split one with my husband.  Definitely will have to triple this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Okay, I wasn't sure how these were going to turn out because I thought I had black beans but turns out I didn't, so I used pintos. Didn't have any cumin either, so I just added other spices like garlic and onion powders. Didn't have red pepper either. Anyway, I doubled the batch and put it all in 8 flour tortillas, (didn't freeze), spritz with cooking spray and baked in the oven at 450 for 15 minutes. My ultra super extra picky son who is 7 RAVED about these! If I said there was spinach in them he wouldn't have even tried them, so I didn't tell them. He actually said "Mommy! WHY haven't you ever made these before??" LOL! He has now asked me to make them for dinner every Thursday night. My husband loved them too. Never thought about baking a tortilla like that and LOVED how it was crispy! I served them with ranch dressing and sour cream but want to try a spicy ranch or something else next time I make them (which will probably be next Thursday according to my son). Thanks for such a versatile recipe! I probably won't ever try frying because I never fry anything, but baked they were great!

I used wonton wrappers and intead of parsley, I used cilantro. I like it a little more spicy, so I added more chili powder.  They were delicious. I also used a dipping sauce with avacados, mayo,sour cream and a few other spices.

Made these this weekend.  Tried them both ways...fried and baked and actually preferred baked. Omitted the beans as a friend does not care for them.  Served with the cilantro cream.  I am taking them to a superbowl party.  Will have to tripple the recipe!

Delicious! The only changes I made were to leave out the peppers, substituted egg roll wrappers instead of the tortillas, and baked at 475 degress for 10 minutes for a healthier version.  Using the egg roll wrappers, I got 10 smaller rolls (instead of the 5 the recipe yielded using tortillas).

I made used the ingredients exactly has this recipe called for, however after freezing them I baked them for 10 mins at 450 like other reviews suggested. My husband will only eat egg rolls from Chilli's and said he doesn't like other egg rolls at all. In fact, I had to talk him into even trying these. He LOVED them (to my, and his own, surprise! Thank you so much, I will be making these again and again!

This was a hit at the New Year Party, and my family really enjoyed it. I made a few small changes. I added cilantro to the mixture, and I rolled them in wonton wrappers. I also used a more healthier oil in which to fry them in. I choose to fry any foods in canola, soy, and olive oils. They are better for the body than vegetable oil.

I used eggroll wrappers as suggested then backed them at 425 for about 10 minutes. My fried-food-loving husband loved them baked.

I took the concept of this recipe and ran with it. Ok, because I knew there was no way my family would be very happy with me if I gave them each one small little roll, I used the burrito grande sized tortillas.I then took all the other ingredients and used the quantities as I saw fit because I didn't want to measure. I used the chicken off of 4 barbecued chicken drumsticks i found in the freezer, 1 whole can of beans, 1/2 cup of corn, onions, green bell pepper instead of red, spinach, and some chopped jalapenos. I don't understand why everyone left off the spinach...I think it added something great. I had no parsely. The only cheese left in my house were mozzarella string cheese and provolone slices so I cut those up together to make about 4 oz. I stuffed my tortillas very well, 4 TB each, added cheese on top instead of blending into the mixture and baked at 475 for 10 min instead of frying. I've never deep fried anything in my life...not really about to start now. It made 7 big tortillas, but it would of been better had I made 8...I overstuffed them a little. I don't know but I tend to always over-"cumin" foods and this was no exception. I should of used 1/2 ts instead of 1. And I really wish I had a stronger cheese, like chedder or monterrey. I think I'll add some chopped tomatoes...that would be perfect. My favorite part was the yummy crispness the baking gave, never tried that before. can't wait to try other burrito recipes like that.

These are delicious and unusual.  My husband loves these.  I doubled the recipe, put them in 10 inch tortillas.  Deep fried them and sliced them diagonally down the center.  They look great and cool off quicker.  I also froze a few just in case someone stops by, i have something quick.

These are so popular with my family and friends for holidays and parties that I periodically make a huge batch and freeze them so they’re always on hand. If using flour tortillas, wrap them all and place on cookie sheets and freeze before putting them into plastic bags for freezer storage. Then when ready to use, preheat oven to 375 and bake for 15-20 minutes. They also come out great in the air fryer if sprayed with a little oil.

These were amazing!!!  I used did use egg roll wrappers, and did not freeze, just fried them up.  Also used Cilantro rather than the Parsley.  So yummy and will be making often!  As another review suggested I made Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce to go with it.

Hubby loved these! I made them vegetarian by just doing a can of black beans, a can of corn, and about half the package of spinach (and probably a bit more of the other things too).
I used spinach & herb wraps for the tortillas and baked them (350 covered for 15 minutes or so, then uncovered until crispy on the ends) instead of frying. 
I didn't measure the spices, just sprinkled and smelled, and they were a bit spicy for me, but just right according to my husband.
He wants them again!

Excellent! I tripled the filling ingredients, and added some fresh cilantro. However, I was rushed the day I made these, so I made them into quesadillas instead! They were a huge hit, and I saved quite a bit of time in the kitchen!!

These were wonderful!!! They are very easy- just a tiny bit time consuming, but well worth it. I did use the wonton egg roll wrapers instead of tortillas. I also, like most others, baked them (after spraying with cooking spray). They were really crispy and the best part is that they are so versitile. You could fill them with so many different combinations!

These are great and easy to make.  We dont eat meat so I used tofu instead of chicken.  With all the spices and cheese, it worked really well.  I loved the deep fried version the best as I did try to bake them and they werent as good...Thanks

This is basically the recipe that Chili's uses.  I make these a lot, but bake them instead of frying.  I double the 'stuffing' and use 10" tortillas.  We eat them as a main dish.

These egg rolls are amazing! My husband craved them for the whole week after. I decided to double the recipe and used full size (12inch) tortillas and served them cut in half. I also made a ranch and hot sauce mix for dipping. Thank you so much for the recipe! I'm sure we will make them over and over!

Whoa, these are excellent!  I'm having a mexican themed lunch for my daughter's 1st birthday and wanted to try these out ahead of time.  I think they will be the hit of the party, I can't wait to make them.  The only things I changed was to use regular onion and roasted red peppers cause it's what I had on hand.

I made this for friends and family.  It is AMAZING.  Instead of dicing the chicken I boiled it so that it would just pull apart.  I thought that the thin strips of chicken would roll better in the tortilla's.  I had a tough time finding a good dipping sauce without putting too much time into it, so I decided to just mix ranch dressing with Frank's Red Hot.  It worked really well!  The ranch helped tame some of the spices, but not too much.

Excellent recipe. I like it made with tortillas or egg roll wraps. Healthier when I use the tortillas because they can be baked rather than fried. Recipe is easily varied with whatever you have on hand. love it!

Wow! These were great! I needed a lot more than the recipe stated so I used 2 chicken breasts, 1 can blk beans, 1 c frozen corn, 1/2 a bell pepper & 1/2 a yellow instead of a red, and I trippled the rest of the ingred. I made 20 rolled in flour torts, brushed with olive oil and baked at 475 for 15 mins. I served it with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce from this site. This was a hit with all of my guests...Update** I use the filling for enchiladas and top them with this sauce... 1 can cream of chicken, 1/2 a pkt taco seasoning and 1 can of salsa mix together and pour on top.

I love these eggrolls. Like another member mentioned this recipe is like the one from Chili's. Instead of using tortillas i use 2 Lumpia wrappers for each eggroll. This bypasses the toothpicks. After frying these i put them in the microwave for a minute to make sure that the eggrolls are heated throughout. Guacamole is a great dipping sauce for these eggrolls.

This recipe was soooooooo good!  I used the egg roll wrappers instead of the flour tortillas.  I took them to work and they were gone in five seconds, and I got the best compliments on them, thanks!  I used the creamy avocado ranch dip from this site to dip them in, it was perfect! I will be making these again for sure!

These were really good the only problem I had was not being able to roll it up and it not come apart. Did'nt freeze them before cooking making some tonight for a get together Friday will try freezing. Update I used the egg roll wraper and fried them all thought they were easier to wrap the taste wasn't as good as the flour tortias. But still very good

Instead of frying I just brushed w/ oil and baked at 475 for about 15 min like the other reviewers.  I like to triple the recipe and have lots ready in the freezer.  Serve with Mexican Rice II recipe from this site, as well as sour cream, guac, and fresh salsa.

My guest LOVED these.  I used Tastefully Simple's Fiesta Party Dip (Which I sell) mix to season the chicken and used spring roll wrappers!  These didn't last long at all.  I woke up this morning and wanted more so I making them for dinner tonight!  Great recipe!

Big Hit!!!!
Have already made them tice & they disappeared fast. Even the kids liked them. I also made them the baking way. (had no non-stick spary so basted w/ belted butter.) Anyways to save time i also bought a rotisserie chicken from the supermarkets & shredded it. Can't get any easier. :)

Awesome recipe! I had bigger tortillas, so I doubled the recipe and stuffed them a bit more to make 6 medium sized 'burritos'. And I definitely added cilantro. :)

Very tasty!  I tried to cut the calories by baking the eggrolls and they were still really crisp and yummy.  We also rolled up the leftover filling the next day and had them as wraps.  Just as good!

Made these and froze them, then the next time we didn't know what to have for a quick meal we cooked these.  I brushed with olive oil and baked as others had suggested to save some calories.  We dipped in ranch dressing (there are those calories right back).  Were pretty good.  Don't know if they were good enough for all of the trouble though.

I enjoyed these as did my church. I served them with plain old salsa but next time would love to try the cilantro cream that other reviewers have suggested.

These were just OK - I followed the recipe except that I used cilantro instead of parsley and I baked them rather than frying. They were kind of bland - not as interesting as I had imagined they would be. Maybe adding some more spices would have helped. I topped them with the cilantro cream sauce and that stuff rocks - I'm thinking that I could use that for a lot of grilled recipies. I most likely will try this recipe again but it will need a bit of help.

Wonderful recipe.  I also baked them and I did not put as much jalapenos because I have some eaters who do not enjoy spicier foods.  Was still very tasty.  I made these as appetizers and cut them in half.  Perfect for a couple of bites and makes the dish go even further.  Served with the cilantro sauce on the web site.  Definitely a keeper recipe and will make many times.

We loved these! They were wonderful. I didn't have any parsley, so I added some cilantro instead, and we deep fried them in egg roll wrappers (skipped the freezing step this way), and they were sooo good! I served them with ranch and also Amy's Cilantro Cream sauce (which complemented the egg rolls perfectly, in my opinion!). We will definitely make these again!

I made these for a girls night appy and they were a hit.  I didn't have any spinach but seemed to work just fine. I baked them in the oven as well and they were great!  What a good recipe, thanks!  I'll make this for my next appy for sure!

These are fantastic. The spice combination is amazing! To make them healthier, I brush a little bit of olive oil over the top of the eggrolls and bake them for about 30 minutes at 450 instead of frying. I don't add the green peppers or bell peppers since everyone likes them better that way. I've also altered the recipe to make vegetarian eggrolls, and add 1/2 block of drained, minced extra-firm tofu in place of the chicken. My co-workers are always asking for these!

Great recipe!!  I just made a few changes: I skipped the spinach out of preference.  I boiled the chicken and shredded it.  I also spiced it up a bit by added chili powder.  Making the egg rolls is more difficult than I imagined.  It really helps to microwave them and keep a damp (more on the wet side) and wipe down both sides of the tortilla before rolling.  I also froze the egg rolls over night which I don't recommend--they took a lot longer to cook.  But don't skip freezing-it helps the rolls stay together when you cook them.

I loved this recipe...with a few changes of course. I made them two different ways, just to see what was better, and I have to say that the baked ones with the egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas were much better. Just make sure the bottoms get crispy too or you'll have some issues. And I left out the spinach, I was afraid the moisture content would make them soggy.

Taste great, just like Chili's! I didn't have corn and I didn't add the beans because I don't care for them. Also, I did not freeze for 4 hours (does anyone know WHY this step is important?? I think I fried mine to long....I have a problem with temp. of grease so I usually bake but I wanted them to be really crunchy......didn't work bc they came out a bit darker than need be! Next time will follow exact!

This recipe was very authentic compared to the dish I love at Chilli's.  I used egg roll wrappers and skipped the freezing process.  Yum - thanks for posting!

these turned out alright. my fiance loved them, but i didnt' care for them all that much. i didn't fry them i baked them ... maybe i shouldn't have done that lol. i was just trying to save some calories. my fiance always wants me to make them again but i didn't care for them all that much.so if you are going to make these i wouldn't recommend baking ... just deep fry them.

The filling was very good! Great flavor. We sprayed them with Pam and baked them like previous reviews suggested. The store bought tortillas were a little too thick though, in the future I will try using wontons shells.

These eggrolls were EXCELLENT!! I didn't change a thing. After freezing, I baked them at 425 degrees for 15 minutes.  Only adjustment would be to a more heat if you'd prefer.  Better than rolls at Chili's and Cheesecake Factory.  Thanks for the recipe!

I cut out the spinach and put the rest of the contents in the wonton wrappers I made from the Wonton appetizer recipe I got from this site.  Overall turned out very well but instead of mixing the cheese in with the rest of the ingredients, I just sprinkled the cheese on top and baked for a few minutes to melt and it turned out great.  i cut out the spinach because I think it would've been too soggy for my wrappers.  Instead of frozen corn, I used the canned corn and it still turned out well.  Spicy so if you want it a little more mild, definitely cut back on the jalapenos.  Overall great recipe and will make again!

I froze the egg rolls overnight and baked them to cut down on fat. My fiance and I agreed that these would be much better if I would have followed the directions to fry them, and also if I would have used real egg roll wrappers instead of the tortillas. The filling was wonderful though! Thanks.

This was very good. Just like chili's egg rolls.  However, I fried them as recommended and I had a problem with the outside burning before the inside was ready..:-(  so I would recommend baking, and I also agree with a few other users about the flour tortillas being too thick. Next time I will try the egg roll wrappers and baking them!  But over all excellent base recipe. Thank You!

Amazing! Made them for a tailgate, and fried them up on site, they were a big hit to say the least! I doubled everything and made about 12 wonderful egg rolls! used an egg wash around the edges and only refrigerated, the frozen one was still cold in the middle. highly recommend! Thanx for a great recipe!

I was looking for something I could use as a sort of finger food meal for the kids (an alternative to fish sticks or chicken nuggets) so when I got everything mixed up it looked like it needed a little more meat.  I added some sausage that I had cooked up and everyone of my very, very picky eaters asked for more!  And they hate beans!  Thinking about putting little shrimpies in it next time.  This one is a keeper!

These are amazing!  I made them last night for a couple of friends and they were so impressed.  I baked them in the oven like some others suggested and they were great...I wonder what the nutrition info would be with them being baked instead of fried.  These were every bit as good as the ones I've had at restaurants!  I'm so excited to have this recipe!  I mixed sour cream and salsa together to dip them in and that was really good.  Yum yum!

Outrageous!  Mouth watering and delicious! These took a little longer than mentioned to prepare. MAKE sure you freeze them 4 hours before deep frying. I found that putting a toothpick in the eggroll kept the wrapper in place. I've heard using egg could also keep the roll intact.  Next time!  Another reviewer recommended a sauce that was PERFECT! I cant wait to make these AGAIN and again.

Oh my Goodness!! This was better than the southwestern eggrolls at Chili's.  I baked 4 chicken legs w/garlic powder,salt&pepper at 475 and reduce to 350 after 45min.  Bake at 350 for 30mins. Removed skin, chopped and added to the veggie mixture which included mushrooms.  Heat the tortilla with butter in frying pan and ate the egg rolls right out of the Pan!! No need to Freeze if you can't wait.

This recipe was excellent!  I'd give it ten stars.  Instead of frying them I used the filling and made quesadillas.  I will try them baked next time as suggested from a previous review (that is if I don't eat the mixture right from the bowl first!)  Yummy!

these were good. the tortillas were a little thick for me, i'll use wonton wrappers next time (from this site). i used beef since that's what we prefer but i think they're probably good either way. i will make these again, they weren't very time-consuming. i'll probably add a cheese sauce to put on top of it.

Perfect! I used eggroll wrappers and fried them up. I did not freeze them at all. We made the pineapple sauce from Bennigan's to dip and it was great! My husband said this may be the best thing I have ever made!

These were good, they tasted just like the ones from Chili's, in fact, this is the EXACT recipe for the ones from Chili's.  I liked these but not enough to make them often.  I didnt add beans but did add extra chicken and corn.  I also used wonton skins instead of tortillas. I think tortillas would have been better.  Yummy, but not enough to make again for a while.

Really good recipe.  I always double the recipe and I prefer not frying them.  I either serve immediately while everything is still warm or will pop in the microwave or oven to reheat.  Everyone enjoys them cold as well, even though I believe they are best served warm.  A+

This was a great recipe. I didn't have cumin on hand so I used curry powder. I also made a dipping sauce from ranch dressing, red bell peppers, curry powder and chilli powder. It was great.

These were more work than I thought just getting it all together - little amounts of everything.  Family liked and I guess looking back the fact that you freeze them kind of makes it worthwhile and I will just make a big batch and kids can pop in oven whenever they want.  Hubby said he would prefer to just put the filling in a corn tortilla and eat as a taco.  It's funny cuz it seems in these comments most preferred egg rolls.  I made 1/2 of each and my family preferred the flour tortillas.  I will skip the corn next time and add more cheese.

Perfect!  Wouldn't change a thing, except next time, we plan to try in actual egg roll wrappers, the tortillas were a bit thick.  They were still great, however!  Will make again for sure!!

These are great! Made the stuffing and used a few tortillas, we thought they were to thick. Next day went back to store for egg roll wrapers! They were the ticket. Excellent! And it's great that you can freeze then bake later!

I had a mexican fiest last night and these were the favorite item.  They had the right amount of spice and were sooo delicious.  I baked them until they were lightly browned and crispy on the outside.  I also served with Amy's cilantro dip which was a great pairing with the eggrolls.  Gave out copies of this recipe to many guest.  Awesome!!

I made these with egg roll wrappers and in the end they turned out fantastic- I ran into problems when I froze them overnight.  They fried up perfectly, but the insides were still nearly frozen- so I ended up putting them in the oven for a while anyway to heat them all the way through.  Next time I will bake them instead.  I served with homemade salsa, and everyone loved them.  I will probably add some Rotel tomatoes in my next batch.  Thanks for sharing an awesome appetizer recipe!

This is wonderful.  Just like Ruby Tuesday's or Chili's.  
Don't freeze too long or the outside will burn while the inside it still rozen.  I like it better with egg roll wrappers and I usually fry them immediately, no freezing.  Serve with sour creme!

Fantastic! We'd been buying a frozen version of this, and I love the fact that I can make them (and more of them at once)! I tripled the recipe (doubled the chicken), making 2/3 with chicken and 1/3 without. I boiled the chicken, then shredded it. I followed the recipe as written, except I didn't add the chicken to the mixture until I'd separated 1/3 of it into another saucepan. I then added the chicken to one saucepan and some of the leftover  beans to the "veggie" version. I used soft-taco-sized tortillas and toothpicks to hold. I baked 4 right away for dinner and saved the rest by freezing them. I brushed 2 with olive oil and the other 2 I sprayed with butter-flavored cookie spray. I baked them on a cookie sheet (left toothpicks in) at 425 for 15 minutes, and they came out just right. I couldn't tell any difference between the olive oil and cooking spray...both turned out crispy and yummy.

I made these for dinner and I was disappointed. Based on the reviews, I was expecting something amazing. I followed the recipe almost exactly except I left out the jalepenos, used cilantro instead of parsley, and baked instead of fried. The mixture was very very bland. I may try to make it again and double up on the seasonings because these had no flavor whatsoever. Thank goodness I had made up a batch of Amy's cilantro dip and we dipped the egg rolls in there to give them some taste.

I revised this recipe a bit. I bought the Tyson's southwestern pre-cooked chicken pieces, used a whole can of beans, ditched the corn, cayenne pepper, and spinach completely, used a whole onion and a whole red bell pepper, and to make up for the unused cayenne pepper I used the same amount of mexican seasoning. Also, I baked the tortillas on 425 for about 12 minutes. They were great! It was paired with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce.

These turned out great. I have made them twice and enjoyed them very much. At first I was nervous about following the recipe exactly, but then I loosened up.  I added a few more flavors to the mix, such as garlic powder, freshly ground black pepper, and a little lemon juice. I add garlic and pepper to almost everything and I like just an edge of lemon in my chicken.  You can't mess this recipe up!

These are the best.  I would rather eat these than have them anywhere else.  Whenever I make them, they are a huge hit.  I like to increase the recipe to twenty servings and put them into 4 separate trays.  Cook whats in one and put the other trays in the freezer for another time.  I wouldn't think of ever trying another recipe.

WOW!!!! Outrageous, I added salsa, and cut them in half, then sprayed them with cooking spray and baked them at 450 for about 20 minutes.  Use creamy garlic ranch dressing to dip them in --Yumfest
thank you  thank you :)

I forgot to add the spinach and cheese so I put the spinach on the bottom when I served and the cheese on the top just prior to taking them out of the oven.  Used the oven cause I don't like to fry - thanks.  Will make again!

Very good recipe.  We tried baking them, but next time I think my husband will try to panfry them instead (we aren't big fans of deep frying most of the time).  I would like a little more heat so next time I will either up the cayenne or the jalapeno.

I enjoyed these very much and so did my family. I was in a hurry so I did not freeze these. I also "thinking they may need a little sauce combined 4 ounces of sour cream and 3 ounces of cream cheese to the mixture with a little of minced cilantro and a few dashes of Louisanna hot sauce and omitting the pepper. I made these into fried burritos. Loved them!!!!!!!!!

AWESOME - only change I made was using fresh spinach. I rinsed and dried it, cut the stems off, put in the food processor. Looked just like another herb. Kids and hubby (neither like spinach) never knew there was spinach in it.

YUMMY!  I made these last night and my boyfriend went on and on about them!  I did use eggroll wrappers instead of the tortillas like some suggested.  I think I will try the tortillas next time - the eggroll wrappers were a bit chewy I guess would be the word.  But they were still so good!  I didn't freeze them b/c I planned on baking them so they would be a healthier meal.  I refrigerated them for several hours and then baked them.  I served with Catherine's spicy chicken soup and Amy's cilantro cream sauce (both from this site).  Thanks for the recipe!

It was very good. I omitted the chicken, baked in oven for 15 mins, the part which was in bottom was soft but the top part was crisp. maybe next time i will add chicken and fry it for better taste, but this is a keeper. thanks for the great recipe.

I made these with large flour tortillas because that was all I had, I also basted them with oil and baked in the oven which made them taosty and crispy.  The jalapeno's I bought were just right - I often feel it is hit or miss how hot they may be.  I do still feel there was one missing ingredient but I will continue to make these and try a few new items inside!  Great idea, will make again.

This was a favorite for my family. The kids absolutely loved them even though they were full of spinach.  This will definately become a regular in my home.

Delicious! I didn't use chicken because I had a couple vegetarians coming. I made the day before and froze them so I didn't have to worry about the prep work and could focus on other dishes for my Mexican fiesta! Also - no deep fryer so I fried both sides and then popped in oven at 350 for about 15 minutes. Also - took tip from other review and left toothpicks in while frying.

Made a double batch of these for a party this weekend and everyone loved them.  I did use eggroll wrappers instead of tortillas and would definitely suggest it.  Other than that--awesome!

These were very yummy! I think they are just about identical to the "top secret" Chili's recipe. Regardless, they are great!

These are good.  I didn't have tortillas so I made them with wonton wraps. That was a pain. It took forever. I fried them in vegetable oil on the stove and enjoyed them.  I would try these again.  Thanks for the recipe. Update.  I have tried these again using eggrolls and tortillas. Eggrolls are enjoyed better by the people who tried them.  With the eggroll, it is now a 5.

I was reading reviews for Amy's cilantro cream sauce (very good) and quite a few people mentioned that they used that sauce for these eggrolls. So i  had to try, glad i did. Very good i left chucken out of mine only and they were still good. I also baked them, not a fan of frying. Although they are probably even better fried. Thanks

As good as chilis!  I did have some trouble wrapping them though... I would recommend a larger tortilla than what this recipe calls for.  Also, you will have lots of left overs for some of the ingredients - like spinach & corn - so I'd recommend making at least 2 batches at a time... they won't go to waste!  :)

These turned out perfect, except for the tortilla. I don't think I froze them long enough though. I added some diced zucchini to the filling.

Made these to serve as a snack for poker night.  I doubled the recipe and served w/ salsa and sour cream.  They turned out really good..not as spicy as I thought they would be but had a really good flavor.  Next time I am going to use egg roll wrappers for smaller portions.

This is a great recipe. I made the Chili's version and made my own changes like adding some additional seasonings. I used green chilis instead of jalepenos. And serve it with an avacado ranch dip. Mmmmmm. Very delicious.

Not a big fan of black beans so used ranch style instead and wrapped in egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas. These turned out so tasty. They were served with sour cream, salsa & guacamole to dip them in. yummmm! We have a lot of Tex-Mex and SW food and these will be a welcome addition to our menus.

These are awesome!  I had a party and served these, and everyone raved about them.  I did not deep fry them, I baked them in the oven at 400 until slightly brown, and they were just as good, not as heavy as if you did fry them.  I added hot sauce before I rolled them for a bit more kick!

Despite the fact that this recipe was very time consuming and messy to make (frying) I wholeheartedly give it 5 stars.  It tastes just like the famous restaurant chain's southwestern egg rolls, and I haven't tried it yet, but you could probably bake these to make them less fat and messy to make.  
If you can, when you make these, make extras to freeze for later!  You will be glad you did!

Excellent eggrolls!  I made these yesterday and everyone loved them.  I also used cilantro instead of parsley for more flavor.  The eggrolls have a subtle spicy-kick which really treat your tastebuds!

Exceptional!  For a dipping sauce, I use a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch "Fiesta" flavored, mixed with 16 oz. sour cream.  You can add a can of Rotel, if you like chunky sauce.

Yum! These are time consuming, but worth it.  I like to make them in big batches and then freeze them for later.  When I'm craving one, I just cook it in the deep fryer and then eat it with sour cream on the side!!

These are GREAT!!  Easy to prepare.  We made them as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and they were gone in seconds...  Had a hard time frying them without them puffing up and unrolling but if you freeze them and leave the toothpick in during frying it worked better.

I used about a cup of a southwestern frozen vegetable mix (black beans, corn, red pepper, green pepper, and onions).  I also added more seasoning (just kept adding till it tasted how i wanted).  I used egg roll wrappers instead of tortillas and baked them instead of frying.  Next time I might try sauteing the rolls in a skillet coated with cooking spray, hopefully that will give them a more "fried" consistancy!!  The flavor was VERY good...but I missed the fried flavor of Chili's southwestern egg rolls.  I will keep experimenting with cooking techniques because frying them just isn't an option for me!!  I accidentally used mozzarella instead of monterey jack cheese, but it still tasted alright.  I think next time I will use pepepr jack cheese, though.  I served with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce as suggested by other reviewers.  Yum yum!

These were a great hit a this year's Superbowl Party!  Now, I just need to come up with a way to keep the tortilla from unraveling during cooking (the toothpicks didn't cut it).

These came out great.  I did add some garlic powder and used eggroll wrappers instead of tortillas.

Excellent!  Easy!  I didn't have time to freeze them before baking, but it turned out great anyway!

Made this for friends the other night and was a big hit. Added  extra cayenne to give it a bit more zip.As stated in the recipe,be sure to micro
tortillas before you roll them or they have a tendency to break. Great party recipe since so much can be done ahead.
