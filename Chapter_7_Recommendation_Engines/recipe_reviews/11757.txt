Wow - this was good! I took some of the other reviews suggestions and did the following: cut the oil in half - used 1/4 cup of white wine instead, lightens the oily taste, minced 5 cloves of garlic. Slipped in a few LIGHT shakes of red pepper flakes - be careful - this added A LOT of flavor. I combined all ingredients except the clams and allowed to them to come to a boil. I prepared the sauce in a large deep saucepan. Added the clams 2/3 minutes before the Spaghetti is al dente. Drain pasta and transferred it all to the sauce, cooked it altogether for 2 minutes and removed. Don't let the clams cook too long, they will come out rubbery.

This was delicious.  Although, I have to admit to changing the recipe after reading almost all of the reviews, and looking at a few other recipes.  The compilated recipe follows:

1/4 c. butter,
2 T. flour,
5-6 large garlic cloves minced,
1 T. dried parsley,
1/4 tsp. dried oregano,
1/4 tsp. dried basil,
1/4 tsp. black pepper,
red pepper flakes-optional-to taste-pinch,
1/4 c. olive oil,
1/4 c. white wine,
2(6.5 oz) cans minced clams in juice,
1/4 c. whipping cream,
1 lb. linguine,
Romano or Parm. for sprinkling on top.

Melt butter in deep saute pan.  Add flour and spices, combine well.  Add olive oil, wine, and juice from clams.  Simmer over low heat until well combined and reduced a bit.  Cook noodles.  Right before adding cooked noodles to sauce add the minced clam meat and whipping cream to sauce--this keeps clams from getting rubbery.  Toss well to coat.  Serve with grated cheese.

Made for anniversary dinner.  Easy, impressive looking, wonderful!

My family loves linguine with white clam sauce. This proved to be a simple yet delicious recipe. Can't wait to make again. Spice it up with 1/2 tsp of hot pepper flakes. You'll love it!

This recipe went over big at my house.  My husband has instructed me never to buy canned clam sauce again.  He made me make twice this week!  I substituted one can of whole baby clams for one of the cans of minced clams...delicious!

Tasted pretty good, but made some minor changes.  Increased the butter to 1/4 cup, used 3 cans of clams, added 1/4 tsp thyme, and added 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup white wine.

Not being a huge marinara fan, I nearly always choose white clam sauce for my pasta.  So, I've tried lots of different ones.  I was very disappointed with this particular recipe.  (Sorry!)  I thought it used WAY too much olive oil.  (1/2 cup!)  The sauce was very thin and watery, even though I later tried to doctor it up by adding a slosh of heavy cream.  The flavor of the sauce was pretty good.  But it was much too thin and watery and oily for my taste.  Not a fan of this recipe, wanted something more rich and creamy.  Just my personal preference.  :-)

I have to shake my head at those who review this recipe and comment over and over that it is too greasy or oily....hello?  This is white clam sauce - it is butter, oil and garlic - it is supposed to be that way!  Throwing a lot of cream in, etc., now you are moving towards a heavy alfredo and that is not what I would ever expect.  Make this recipe AS IS, with a splash of wine.  It's delicious.

We are major clam lovers.  I used a 10 oz can of whole clams plus a 6.5 oz can minced and will double it, at least, next time.

Loved it. Made changes as per other reviews - only 1/4 C EVOO, 3 TB butter, 1 TB minced garlic (I LOVE garlic!), no garlic powder, only had one can of clams, and 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper. Also added a splash of heavy cream. Wonderful!

This recipe was wonderful.  I added more garlic and cut down on the olive oil.  Next time I will cut down even more on the oil but other than that it was great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very disappointed. I followed this recipe to the "T" and was very excited... but it did not turn white or anything near that color. it was watery/soupy and clear. i'm not sure what i could've done differently to fix it.

This was easy, fast and good.  I'll keep canned clams on hand to make this again when I need a quick dinner.  I used fresh parsley instead of dried, and whole baby clams instead of minced.  Next time, I might add a little crushed red pepper, too.

I used frozen clams from seaside, so the salt water that I included made this dish way too salty. I'll have to adjust that next time, but the flavor was good other than that.

I have been using this recipe for quite awhile and I forgot to review it.  This makes an excellent sauce! I think the measurements are spot on...the only thing I modify is the fresh garlic.  I double the garlic, because we love garlic.  I love the combo of the olive oil + butter.  This is the only recipe I will use from now on! Thanks for sharing, Angchick!

I enjoyed this recipe but the next time I make it I will definitely use much less oil and more garlic. It also works well with prawns instead of clams.

Fine recipe as-is if you are one of those folks that like this style of clam sauce; I prefer a much thicker sauce, so I simmered it for some time with a bit of white wine and all of the clam juice and reduced the sauce to nearly to a marinara consistency. Tasted excellent at this point, then I decided to great creative and added the clams, PLUS 1/2 tsp. or so of bittersweet Spanish paprika (avail. Amazon) which turned it into a red sauce (!) AND pushed the flavor WAAAY over the top. Served over linguine, and sauce was thick enough that none of it dripped through to hit the plate. Will need to do this a lot more often.

One of my family's favorite and so easy to make.  I cut back on the olive oil and add more fresh garlic.  Other than this, I follow the recipe pretty much exact.  It's so easy to make that I make this when I am stuck with nothing for dinner - these ingredients are easy to have on hand for an emergency meal.  I have all picky eaters and they all love this - we have it at least twice per month.

It is as good as in many restaurants!  Added extra garlic.  I like garlic.  Could have added a little more clams.  With garlic bread and salad a feast.

I just made this and it was amzing - with minor modifications.  I substituded white wine for half of the olive oil and I added 4 T. of flour when I added the spices.  Then I waited until right before I tossed the pasta and sauce to add the clams along with 2/3 c. of cream to the sauce.  Wonderful!

I tried it the 'tweaked' way. 1/4cup oil, 1/4 butter, 1/4 wine. I added both cans minced clams with juices. It was amazing with some parmigiana sprinkled on top. It looked and smelled fancy, but was simple!

I added the extra cans of clams as suggested and had way too many clams for both my boyfriend and I.  Neither of us were really interested in the leftovers.

Super fast!  Super easy!  Being garlic lovers, I doubled the fresh garlic.  Even my teenage son - who isn't a big seafood lover - had seconds.  Definitely a keeper recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

WOW! This was wonderful! We had not leftovers, we ate it all! I used chopped clams and whole baby clams just to make it hearty. Also, after I cooked the 1lb of noodes (we used angle hair) it was too much noodles to sauce (especially for our family of four), so I put half the noodle on a serving dish and poured the clam sauce on top. I served it with ceasar salad and the presentation was beautlful. Everyone had seconds.

Very Good!  I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder and added a pinch of cayenne pepper - these added just the right touch to a very good recipe.

This was good, but next time I will buy and use a bottle of clam juice!!! It was a little dry for me, even though I reserved the juice from the minced clams. Thanks for the recipe.

I am a widow. So I enjoy researching recipes according to what I have in my pantry. I was recently given 2-50oz cans of clams in juice. I used the compilation review of rdonahue. I adjusted some what for so many,many clams, but only slightly. And was I glad. The final product was "THE BEST" recipe I have tried in a year. The spices with the oh so delicate clams just sing together with joy. Cooks, you cannot go wrong with this terrific meal and so easy.

Great recipe! Used 3 cans of minced clams and not the full pd. of spaghetti. Like to have more meat in a pasta dish. Very tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

delicious!  made with whole wheat linguini, one can of clams (used most of the juice), and supplemented the other can of clams with chopped mushrooms and half of a white onion.

definitely agree on adding the crushed red pepper.  didn't have any basil on hand and was still great.  also, put water in it to make more dipping sauce and stretch it further.

my boyfriend finished two helpings before i'd even finished my first.  definitely a keeper!

This is really good.  No more canned clam sauce for me!  I tried some of the other reviewers suggestions, used 1/4 cup of olive oil and 1/4 cup of white wine.  Also, cut down on the butter.  Made this twice last week.

It was good but I made quite a few suggested changes, and feel like it still has to be tweaked more. I'd rather find a recipe that didn't need so many changes.

this was surprisingly fantastic. i say this because the inside of a can of clams isn't that appealing. when i told my husband what i was making he said, 'i don't think i like that.' well, he gobbled it right up, along with my 21-month-old. i couldn't believe it. i only used 1/2 a pound of spaghetti, so i cut the oil down to 1/8 cup, 2 TBSP butter, 4 cloves of garlic, 1 15 oz can of chopped clams, and about half the juice, along w/half of the spices. awesome. next time, i'll include some bread to sop up all the juicy goodness.

Yum! Followed directions from Sept 2008 review. I added a little less than 1/4 cup olive oil and very little butter. Added fresh parsley, basil and chopped fresh shrimp and chopped fresh clams so they wouldn't get "rubbery". I like that it's a little creamy when you add flour and cream.

This was very good, I liked it better than ready made because it is less oily.  I served it with parmesan topped garlic bread. Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy!  Tastes like a dish from our local Italian restaurant, except they add extra clams in the shell. I used less oil and more clams (baby clams, not chopped) and more clam liquid. I will either double the sauce or cook half the pasta next time. Will make this often!

This was great for a pasta dinner party. Everyone was wowed. Very simple but yielded great results. Actually used Italian seasoning instead of each individual spice and added a bit of salt. Also used parmesan instead of Romano cheese. Will make this many more times.

I have always liked white clam sauce but I had never had it homemade. This was very easy to make, I didn't change a thing in this recipe and I loved it! No more canned clam sauce for me. I am looking forward to making this again real soon.

Delicious recipe! My husband and I loved it. He said it is a keeper. In other words, make it again. We did not miss the wine. We find the white wine detracts from the delicious clam,garlic butter flavor and also thins the sauce some what  so it doesn't cling  as  well to the pasta.

This is the second time I’ve made this. Thie first time I made it exactly to the recipe and my family and Are certain that in our version of heaven this is served. As good as the best restaurant I’ve had it in. This time, in a ln effort to wait a little longer before going to heaven I cut back on the most delicious and most fattening ingredients. Used half the Olive oil and butter, 3 times the garlic and a couple tablespoons wine and the juice of one lemon.

This has become my grandson’s favorite meal - white clam sauce with fresh linguine. This recipe makes more than enough for one meal so I freeze a container for another meal. Sauces freezes well.

This sauce is AMAZING IF... you continue to REDUCE to thicken the sauce and concentrate the flavors. Start making this first before you boil water for pasta or prepare garlic bread. When you first begin adding everything to your cook pot it is extremely watery, and the sauce will not stick to your pasta, but after you reduce it to about a gravy consistency it is OMGEEE awesome! I used canned minced clams and use ALL the juice! Other changes I made is we love finely chopped onion and lots of garlic and those are sautéed in 1/4 c.  olive oil and 1/4 c. butter with all spices added. Once the onions are nicely browned I add the clam juice (save clams till almost ready to eat) and 1/4 c. wine (any wine will do).  Then while that is on low heat (stirring occasionally) I get to work with the rest of dinner (salad, bread, pasta). By the time everything else is done this is ready, thow the clams in the sauce and you are ready to eat. This is SO GOOD I now dislike restaurant versions of white clams sauce because they just do not compare!

We absolutely love this recipe!  The only "change" I made was where it said to add clams with some of their liquid, I drained one can only.  It's perfect!

This is delicious, but I don't like the original recipe, because a half cup of olive oil is WAY too much. I cut it to a quarter cup, added some white wine, and a tad more butter. I also added a liberal sprinkling of Trader Joe's 21 seasoning salute, and an extra can of clams.  The leftovers are great the second time around, too.

I love it..I did modify ..exchanged one can of clams for 12 live small ones, I did cut back on the oil and add white cooking wine in its place.  I used a little corn starch to slightly thicken because I wanted the sauce to cling to my pasta .

This is an awesome recipe. One of my favorites and now my wife and my kids love it, too.  

PERSONAL NOTES: I do not add the butter or margarine because it makes the sauce a little too oily for our tastes. I prefer to use all of the sauce from the clams and I even add some clam juice and a little white wine. Fino Sherry is great for this. I simmer the sauce until it turns almost creamy. I'm not a big fan of onions (actually, my stomach doesn't like them - I love the taste!) so I reduce that amount.  And of course my kids are not fond of black pepper so I cut that out.   But the basic recipe is great!

Used this for a cooking lesson with my teenaged son last night.  We didn't have basil so I used thyme.  Used 1/3 c olive oil and all the can juices.  Oh, and I always add extra garlic--3 cloves in this dish. Loved, loved, loved it.  Great recipe.  I think others have thought the sauce too thin because they didn't allow the sauce to reduce and thicken over heat.  Try that next time--simmer 10 to 15 minutes.  Yum.  And I simply added the clam in the last 3 or 4 minutes of cooking so they wouldn't get rubbery, as suggested.  Thanks for this really quick and easy, yet decadent, recipe.

I also lessened the amount of oil to 1/4 cup.  When it came time to add the clams and juice, I just added juice and let the liquids reduce to a sauce-like consistency by simmering.  Then I added the clams to cook for 3-4 minutes before I added pasta.  It was delicious!

This recipe is pretty good and I am not the best cook so that ought to tell you something. I am glad that I read the other reviews and took some of their suggestions such as:
cut the evoo to 1/4 cup
use 1/4 cup white wine
double the butter
add red pepper flakes
And I addeed fresh lime juice, I think lemon or lime works really
I was really impressed and it tasted better than the clam sauces from my local italian restaurants. Oh and I used Corn Starch to thicken the sauce instead of cream...I think clam sauce should be translucent, not white like alfred sauce.

Recipe is very tasty; I made some changes/additions.  Cut down oil to 1/3 cup ( using half roasted garlic infused oil and half olive oil), used two cans minced clams with all of it's juice, plus 1 can (14 oz.) artichoke bottoms, which I drained and diced), added 1 small chopped shallot, 1/2 tsp. crused red pepper, a little more of the parsley, oregano and basil, salt, put in a splash of white wine and a splash of lemon juice.  Make sure you whisk all the ingredients thoroughly before ladling on top of preferred pasta.  Deliciious!  My husband said he would not order pasta with white clam sauce at a restaurant, but if he knew it would taste like this did, he definitely would--he loved it.

I was looking for a white clam sauce to make.  This one looked easy, and I had all the ingredients already.  It was rated high by a good number of people too.  Well it was quick, simple, and excellent.  It's a keeper!

We love this recipe! My girls love to use Fresh Clams (we live in WA State) and they "have" to add cooked, diced bacon to the top and eat it with grilled French Bread. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was pretty good! Per other reviews, I cut the olive oil down to 1/4 cup, and upped the butter to 1/4 cup. I also used 2 10 oz. cans of baby clams. I used all the juice from the first can, but drained the second. We had leftovers, so I poured the remaining clam juice over the leftovers, since I knew the pasta would dry out a bit.
Because I doubled the clams, the spices were a bit bland, and I ended up adding seafood spice to taste. This is still a pretty bland recipe, but not too greasy (the way I made it). I think I would double the amount of fresh garlic next time.
Also, I don't have dried parsley, and I didn't have fresh, so I used some fresh basil (about 1/4 cup chopped) from the garden, which gave it a really nice subtle basil flavor.
My husband liked it, which is saying something because he only likes pasta with marinara sauce!
I will definitely make this again, and thanks for the heads up that this can be greasy with the 1/2 cup oil!

I don't have anything to compare this to.  I really didn't feel healthy eating this.  Lots of oil and didn't have as much flavor as I thought it would.  I guess I am the minority.  Kids decided they don't like clams either.

I used chopped clams, and DOUBLED the amount of clams.  Used every bit of clam juice. Not at all too clammy! Made it early in the day & let it meld. Everyone loved it - even the non-clam eaters! It's already added to my recipe box!
