I thought the bones were here, but it missed a little in the way of texture. I added shredded carrots, toasted sesame seeds, red cabbage, fresh cilantro, and a hint of fresh lemon juice. All the colors made it beautiful as well ;)

Loved it!!!
I did the following substitutions:
Chopped peanuts instead of almonds
One red chili and 3 cloves of garlic instead of the sauce
Wine vinegar instead of rice vinegar
Fresh pasta instead of the noodles and still it was great -- even the next day, though a little dry - add more water

Great basic recipe that  has so many possibilities.  Add tofu, shrimp chicken, other veggies. Eat it hot or cold. Spicy or not. Perfect for kale "newbies"!

I loved it.. But lol it COULD BE BETTER I've took your lovely idea blended it up add a touch of white wine it's now soup, Then I cooked the noodles half way, Everything is in the cauldron for half hour simmering for someone to eat ?. Thank you for this RECIPE.

This was my first Vegan dish, made it for my son's girlfriend who is a strict Vegan, she loved it! She wanted the recipe! The only thing I changed was adding some shredded organic carrots, the multi colored ones!

Great base recipe that's flexible for varied tastes and whatever veggies are on hand. I added more sriracha, as well as some chili oil into the sauce. I added grated carrots, thinly sliced asian cabbage, and sesame seeds. We subbed nori seaweed since that's what we had on hand. It was tasty just crumbled on top and mixed in.

Wonderfull recipe w/o peanut butter - we added Worchestire sauce and omitted seaweed, tasty.
