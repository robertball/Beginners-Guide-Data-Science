My husband and I thought this recipe was very good. I just used ordinary bacon and added a touch of basil and a little sugar. Most things with tomatoes needs a touch of sugar to get rid of the flat taste. Will make again.

I couldn't find Irish bacon and used Pancetta for the first time which made the flavor of this soup fantastic.  It's a true comfort meal especially when serving the recipe for Irresistible Irish Soda Bread.  Thank you for sharing which brought raves from my guests!

We loved this soup.  Used regular bacon and cabbage since that's what I had leftover.  One change is that it takes a bit more chicken broth and/or water.

I was kinda worried about this because it really didn't taste that great the first time around, but when we heated it up the next day it was GREAT.  I added chicken for extra protein and used regular cabbage.  Also added some minced garlic.  Potatoes were yukon golds, but I think red taters might taste better next time.

This is absolutely wonderful soup just the way it's written and I hate it when people try to rewrite someone's recipe, so just consider this a variation of this excellent soup:  The last time I made it, I used regular bacon and after that was sauted, I added onion & celery and cooked it for about 10-15 minutes.  Then I added the potatoes and browned them slightly.  Then I added the bouillon, tomatoes, 1 small regular green cabbage and salt & pepper and simmered it for about 20-30 minutes.  Lastly, I stirred in a can of mixed beans (pinto & great northern) and simmered it until it was heated through.  Delicious.  I think also, cumin would be good in this.

This soup is great. I only gave it 4 stars because I think it definately needs more chicken stock than is called for. I was making a double batch of this but I ended up using 4 (15oz.) cans of chicken stock & that was just about right. Also, I used regular bacon & cabbage. I added the cabbage about an hour before we were going to eat as I like my cabbage really cooked & not crunchy. It also allows the cabbage flavor to permeate into the soup better.I did add 2 Tbsp. of dried minced onion & some "little smokies" sausages that I cut up & that really upped the flavor quite a bit. All in all, a very good recipe. My "soup group" loved it!

yummy! I made a few substitutions. I used pancetta, a pound of mini gold potatoes that I quartered, and I didn't have tomatoes so I added some chopped carrots.  Also I used half a yellow onion and a few cloves of fresh garlic which I diced and cooked with the panceta.  I flavored with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  I used regular cabbage.  Most of my time was in prep.  Let me say that it was all worth it because this soup is amazing.  Even people who don't think they like cabbage will love this.  I will be making this again soon!

This soup was very easy and extremely tasty! Its a really solid base and can be tweaked with great results. I sauteed half of an onion in the bacon grease and also added extra cabbage, potatoes and broth. My boyfriend is Irish and thought it was great.

This soup is fantastic. Lots of flavor (who doesn't like bacon?!) and plenty filling. I will definitely make again.

My son in law raises pigs so I'm always looking for a good pork recipe. This one is great! I did make changes, I used thick bacon, next time I'll use chopped up ham. I used one large potato one cup of sliced celery, two carrots shredded (sneeking in vegetables) One med onion, sliced thin, I used about a quart, as needed chicken broth. I also used a med head of cabbage sliced thin and chopped.  I did not use salt but I added white wine vinegar to my bowl just a few shakes. Delicious I'll make it again, family loved it.

A very delicious, easy, and affordable meal.  Tasted even better the next day.  I used panchetta instead of irish bacon because it wasn't available where I live.

This wonderfully quick and easy recipe was my inspiration for dinner tonight.  I couldn't get Irish bacon, so I used Canadian Bacon instead.  I did what other reviewers suggested and added half an onion and a clove of garlic.  Frankly, I thought the soup smelled better before I added the can of tomatoes, though it tasted very good with them.  I will try it without them next time.   It also need another can of chicken broth and I added some water as well for more broth.   This is a very good base recipe.

The broth was very salty to me. I used the pancetta and it was stringy. I'd advise if using pacetta to cut it up in small pieces.  It isn't a dish I'd make again or feel comfortable serving to dinner guests. It reminded me of the cabbage soup diet.

I too used ragular bacon and diced ham for good measure which I cooked with the bacon grease and added to the soup.  I cooked in the crock pot all day, and it was delicious and had a lot more flavor than I expected, probably from the bacon grease.

Delicious! Used reg bacon & green cabbage Also I had a few veggies that needed to be used.  Sauteed onions, carrots & celery. Simmered with 2 cans ckn broth, 1 can veg broth 2 bay leaves & 1 scored pork hock for extra flavor. Veg broth added to ckn broth does make a difference. I learned this from a chicken soup recipe on this site

At one reviewer's suggestion, I sauteed onions & celery, and then browned the potatoes. I put the whole thing in the crock pot on high for 4 hours. Added more broth (1 cup of chicken stock, 1 cup of beef broth) even though I'd only used 1/2 head of savoy cabbage. This got RAVE reviews and is a definite keeper! (Added herbs de provence per our preference.)

This so absolutely yummy even though I had to use white cabbage.  Can't imagine how good it would be with the green!  I even over-cooked it a bit and it was STILL yummy!  But it was just as well that I over-cooked it a bit as it made it more of a stew consistency which pleased my non-soup eating husband greatly! The recipe is really good as is but a half a tablespoon each of smoked paprika and garlic powder, puts it over the top!

Really great recipe! Like others, I used regular bacon and green cabbage. I also added some onion and garlic (1/4 cup onion and a tsp of minced garlic), sugar (2 T) and ended up with a third potato and an additional 12 oz of chicken broth. Husband, sister and 3 yr old all liked it, although the 3 yr old didn't like the cabbage.

I doubted this soup because of the simple ingredients and the ease of cooking it, but make no mistake, THIS soup is fabulous! I really enjoyed it! When I make it again Il either add a little more chicken broth or cut down on the potatoes as the startch in the potatoes acted like a thickening agent and I prefer it a tad more liquidy...Thanks for sharing this one!

Cant stop eating it! Only had a cheap pack of bacon bits and normal cabbage, and my diced tomatoes were ones with chilli n peppers, but it still worked out absolutely delicious. Also threw in a big pinch of mixed herbs and a teaspoon of sugar. I'm eating it at the computer right now.  Can't believe how something so simple and so quick to make can taste so good.

This was good, but I didn't realize that Irish bacon is more like Canadian bacon, so I used regular bacon.  I felt the soup was very salty and the bacon got a little soggy.  Next time, I'll use Canadian bacon.  Then I'm sure I'll feel it's a five-star recipe.

Very good.  I added a diced onion and a bit of garlic.  I used regular bacon since I didn't have irish bacon (which is basically a smoked loin chop that's fried and very yummy) and regular cabbage cause I had to use it up.  Also added a bit of kale for the dark green color.  Very filling.  I probably should have cut my potatoes a little smaller, but I guess I'll just have to make it again soon!

This soup is excellent!  My husband, who is not a huge soup person, enjoys it and even has the leftovers for lunch.  I agree with adding sugar to help cut the acidity of the tomatoes.  (I used brown sugar for a little more flavor.)  I also took the bacon out and cooked onion and garlic in the grease from the bacon for some more flavor.  A little basil and garlic powder and it's good to go!  (That's the reasoning for giving 4 instead of 5 stars.)

Good recipe with simple ingredients. I used regular bacon, cooking it until crisp and adding it with the cabbage instead of with the potatoes. Next time I will use the petite diced tomatoes as there are a LOT of tomatoes (though not too many) and it would be nice to have them distributed a bit more evenly throughout the soup. My family enjoyed it. Will definitely make this on occasion. :)

This was pretty good...it wasn't what I was expecting, but it was still good.  I followed the directions, but also added an onion to balance out the taste of the tomato.  This will probably make it into my soup rotation.

This was a big hit with my family. I made some changes though. I used thick cut bacon and removed the crispy bacon from the pan. I then cooked a diced onion and shredded cabbage in the drippings. I also used Italian seasoned tomatoes as that is what I had on hand. I used an entire carton of chicken broth. Next time I may add chicken or shredded corned beef for some extra protein.

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my Irish boyfriend.  It's just different enough from traditional bacon and cabbage that he didn't have to compare it to his mother's, but still gave him a nice taste of home.  I totally faked the Irish bacon by letting pork chops soak in salt water(if you look online there are extensive instructions on making Irish Bacon)and it actually kinda worked.  I also added onion at the beginning.  Overall, a very tasty soup.

I like how quick and easy this recipe is.  I use thick cut pepper bacon and I add red pepper flakes and small cubes of lean pork loin.  I make it a day ahead of serving because it is even better the next day.  My family enjoys it so much I always have to make a double batch.

This soup is excellent!  To make it more "soupy"  I use a whole can of chicken broth.  I have made it twice using pancetta and while the flavor is exceptional, the pancetta is very expensive.  Next time I will buy back bacon from the butcher.

Sadly, this recipe didn't meet my expectations.  I found that the tomato overpowered the soup and I couldn't really taste much else. Since it is a "bacon and cabbage" soup I was really disappointed that the bacon and cabbage were lost in it. May try again without tomato and more chicken broth.

The reviews on this recipe sounded almost too good to be true.  I used pancetta, since I have no clue what Irish bacon is.  Needed to use 2 cans of chicken broth.  It was nearly too salty to eat.  If I make this again, I will probably not use pancetta, maybe just regular bacon, an unsalted tomatoes.

Yummy recipe ... I followed it to a tee except, I went to Whole Foods ... they didn't have Irish Bacon ... So, I had them slice (rather thickly) their smoked bacon and I simply cut it into large pieces ... I added Basil ... onion powder and garlic salt, regular pepper ... used regular cabbage ... delicious ... of course, I did use more chicken stock than called for ...   Very very good ... I served it with Irish Soda Bread with raisins ...  Try it on St. Patty's Day!!!  Perfect.

We love this recipe on cold weather nights.  I used regular green cabbage and trimmed the fat from regular bacon.  I also doubled the chicken stock, and added 1/2 tsp. dried Italian Herbs, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/8 tsp. pepper, and 1/4 tsp. sugar.  As with many recipes, any leftovers are better the next day than they were the day you made it.

I did Kielbasa instead of bacon and added diced onion and garlic while cooking the meat. I also used red potatoes and left the skin on. Added a pinch of basil. Delish!!

I replaced the bacon with kielbasa and added onions. And I started by sautéing the onions  and kielbasa first in olive oil with savory, basil, marjoram, thyme, sage, and rosemary. Then followed the recipe. It came out soo good. Everyone at my house loved it

Excellent  soup!  Now our family favorite! and we always have some in the freezer. As per other reviewers added a med onion, 1 garlic clove to the frying meat and lots more water and chicken bouillon cubes. Instead of canned tomatoes, I use fresh. I blenderize the majority and dice the rest - I like to see some of the veggies in my food! I also use regular green cabbage since Savoy isn't available where I live.

Update:  Didn't have bacon one day, so I substituted breakfast sausage (the breakfast sausage here in Costa Rica isn't fatty and there isn't anything to drain).  Turned out great!  B. sausage here is much cheaper than bacon so that's all I use now. 

Update:  I've started using other sausages now and it always turns out great!

Update:  Been using this recipe as part of a Grade 5 & 6 cooking course. All the kids love it!

Note to self: Doubling the recipe = 1.4kg of potato

a really easy, tasty and hardy dish. It's not a main course but a perfect side soup. I found using pancetta does not work as it is really salty and stringy That's just absurd and rude! Thanks for the great recipe Ita!

This is one of my favorites.  I make it every year for our St. Patty's Day dinner club.  I use pancetta sliced as thick as the deli can do it and then cubed.  It can be a little salty, but I just add more cabbage to dull it down.  It's a big hit every year.

This is fabulous.  The only thing I did differently besides doubling the recipe was to saute some green onions, a small leek and a few garlic cloves in the pan before I added the other ingredients.  I browned the bacon in a large skillet as I find it is easier to drain that way.  I will definitely make this again.

This was excellent. I used regular thick bacon and cabbage, and fire roasted diced tomatoes. I added 2 tsp of Splenda and fried a chopped onion with the bacon which also added that great carmelized taste.   I also used 2 cups chicken broth.

I made this recipe for the first time last week, and it was very good. Generally, I don't like cabbage (not even the smell of it when it's cooking), but it's hard to avoid cabbage on St. Pat's Day. So I thought I'd give this a try, and I'm glad I did. I've rated it four rather than five stars because I found that at least double the broth is necessary, and a few ingredient tweaks are also useful. I used regular bacon and regular cabbage, added 1 t sugar, 1 T Italian spices (oregano, basil, thyme, rosemary blend), and doubled the broth. Because I had too much to do on the 17th, I made this soup the day before but didn't simmer it long so that I could finish cooking it just before serving. It was very good, and the cabbage blended well with the tomatoes, potatoes, and broth; so it didn't overpower the other flavors. Thanks for the recipe, Ita.

This soup was really a pleasant surprise.  I was a bit leery about the ingredients but was looking for recipes for an authentic Irish Dinner party I had for my husband's St Patrick's Birthday dinner.  I have to admit, I could not resist the urge to "spice it up" quite a bit.  I made a very large pot, approximately 6 times the recipe.  I used regular thick cut bacon, cooked crisp. I also threw in a few cans of Rotelle tomatoes for added "zing."  While the listed ingredients were simmering, I sauteed a large leek, several shallots (all cut very thin) and quite a bit of fresh garlic in a separate skillet.  I added that to the soup and then boiled off the flavor in the skillet and added the extra broth.  I used a touch of basil with the salt and pepper and left the skins on my red potatoes.  It was quite delicious, and even better the next day.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  My head was in the clouds when I went shopping to buy ingredients.  I don't know how to find irish bacon so I bought pancetta as suggested.  But I didn't buy enough and ended up also using regular bacon that I already had in the fridge.  I also forgot potatoes but I found a few red potatoes in my pantry and used those. I also added a little sugar like another reviewer posted because I am also used to adding a touch of sugar when I cook with tomatoes.  Anyway, this recipe is easy and flavorful.  I will cook this again.  Happy St. Patrick's Day!

I bought the ingredients for this ON St. Patricks Day for dinner that evening, the store was actually almost out of cabbage! So I had to use the regular cabbage, not the dark kind, and they WERE out of bacon except for turkey bacon.  So I made due with what I could get, it would definitely be better with normal bacon, but even with the turkey bacon, this was a five star soup!  The tomato adds just exactly the right touch to the cabbage.  SO YUMMY!!!!

Made it many times. If you can't find back bacon use Canadian bacon - - basically the same thing. I often use chicken sausage, too - - plus, some onions, garlic, Italian seasoning and a few red pepper flakes. This soup has become a household favorite.

I absolutely love this recipe! I use regular bacon, 32 oz of chicken stock and pretty much a whole small head of cabbage. Everything else I keep the same and I just keep an eye on it and taste it. I cook longer than it says.

Very good!  I will make it again using Canadian Bacon or Pancetta. They are supposed to be good substitutes for Irish bacon.  I made it because I had some bacon I needed to use. It was regular bacon, so I just didn't cook it as crisp as I usually do.  I did make one change --- added a can of rinsed and drained navy beans.  I thought it was a relatively quick and easy soup, and actually could be made without the bacon as a good vegetarian dish. I just remembered --- I couldn't find savoy cabbage, so I just used the green cabbage available here. Served it as a meal with cornbread and a salad.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day and it was absolutely fantastic! I couldn't find Irish bacon for the life of me so I used pancetta instead. In the future, I would probably use regular bacon instead of pancetta, as I found the pancetta had a sweet taste to it that I could have done without. I also threw in a pound of sliced turkey polska kielbasa and a diced onion for some added flavor and some cayenne for a kick. It was absolutely delicious!

I just made this for supper and we loved it.  I may use hamburger next time instead of bacon.  But it is a great and easy soup.

I didn't have Irish bacon nor savoy cabbage so I used regular bacon and cabbage instead. I think that this is a good soup base but it needs tweaking. I had to add a lot more stuff after realizing that it's bland and it lacks flavor. I added a quartered onion, 2 stalks of celery sliced into 1/4 pieces, (which I removed afterwards because the pot was getting too crowded) basil and red pepper flakes. I also used low sodium chicken broth because I thought the bacon will add to the saltiness. I don't know if this is one of the reasons mine lacked flavor. The bacon did nothing to flavor the soup. They turned out mushy after being boiled. I most likely will not make again.

Per other "Chefs" in the audience, I upped the broth and added celery. Also used chicken sausage and regular bacon. Love the cabbage.

Just made this recipe tonight. It was awesome!  So, simple and so good. I was able to find Irish bacon at www.goodwoods.com.  The only thing I did different was to add a couple of chicken bouillon cubes to make it a bit more salty.  This was a great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Instead of the Irish bacon we used breakfast-style sausages. Back bacon is very expensive!
Used regular cabbage but even after adding it and simmering for at least 30 minutes it was still tough!
Also added a few sliced celery heart pieces. Used more canned tomatoes than is called for as well - approx. 28 fld. oz.

I was looking forward to how this soup would taste the 2nd day since so many reviewers said it was better reheated but it was so good the 1st day we didn't have any leftover. I'm going to make another batch in a few days in my crock pot after browning the bacon.  The only changes I made was to fry some chopped onion after the bacon was browned. I used regular bacon because that's what I had.  I also added a tablespoon of honey to offset the acid in the tomatoes & increased the broth slightly because it was too dry.  This soup is wonderful!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Very good soup. We put bacon and kielbasa in it however next time it will be bacon only.  Considering the ease of preparation and the few ingredients it had outstanding flavor.  Will definitely make again.

This was great! I added alot more to it. Added basil, oregano, minced garlic, corn beef. I used the Italian style diced tomatoes. I cooked the cornbeef in the crock pot adding the spice to this too. I used some of water from the cooked cornbeef plus 2 cans of chicken broth. I used the regular bacon and cabbage like a lot of the other reviews. It turned out very good. Took it to work and shared with the ladies in the office. They enjoyed it!

This was phenominal! Of course substituted Kale for the cabbage and Peppered Bacon for the Irish Bacon.  Flavor was wonderful without additional seasoning and was very hearty and filling.

I was not able to find the Irish Bacon for this recipe; however, I did research Irish Bacon and used Canadian Bacon...it was stated that they are similar.  The packages of Pancetta were so small.  I made enough for 20 people.  It came out wonderful.  I did as others had suggested and added onion and garlic.  Very good flavor.

This was very good, quick and easy.  Definitely a keeper, I used regular bacon and regular cabbage (didn't notice that it said savoy cabbage).  It probably would have been more flavorful with a different cabbage.  My husband loved it!

This gets a 4 for taste. It would be a 4 with some flavor added (garlic for those who can have it, onion). It isn't really a soup. More like a stew or even a casserole. There just isn't enough liquid in it to be called a soup. Up the chicken stock to about 4 cups for soup. Might be better to add a little sugar, not much, to take the acidic taste from the tomatoes. Perhaps add a tsp or two of basil. They have a natural affinity to tomatoes.

This is exactly how my Irish grandma and mom make it.  Very very good!  Home comfort food for me:)  loved it ty.   Ive also made it with Kielbasa, browning it first     then adding  the other ingredients.   Tasty, and filling.   I have added a chopped apple to switch up the taste a bit.    Thats good too.

I read several reviews before I made this. I did add some onion, celery, garlic and chicken to the soup. Served it to 6 ladies in my Bible study group. Not sure the bacon added much flavor to the soup. Several reviewers said the soup reheated well, will see then if the bacon is important. We did like the soup and I will make it again. I don't often use a tomato base for my chicken soups, so I was pleased with how this turned out.

I love this recipe, but as I omit an ingredient, I only gave it 4 stars.  It's full bodied and you feel like you are eating a meal!
Feel free to add more of every ingredient  to the broth amount.  The cabbage cooks down so well and juices out that the amount of broth can handle it.

I put  mine together in a slightly different order, adding the cabbage before the potatoes, in order to get it wilted down and merge the flavors faster.

Totally a great soup!

I really liked the flavor of this. I used pancetta. As it was precooked, when I sautéed it, there wasn't much grease so I chose not to drain it off thinking it would add flavor. Next time I will drain it because I found the fattiness was a little of putting. I think I will also put in more cabbage.

Amazing. I put in some butternut squash cubed just because I had it, also added fire roasted diced Tomatoes added wonderful flavor. Paired with Irish Soda Bread, was a perfect meal! Very filling and fulfilling.

Followed the backbone of the recipe to use with items on hand -- fully cooked sun-dried tomato sausage and a can of pink beans.  Broth was rich and hearty, savoy cabbage was perfectly savory.  Great flavor for any sub-ins!  Can't wait to try as written!

Surprisingly excellent! I did sauté half an onion and chopped carrots before adding the broth. Also used regular bacon since that’s what I had on hand. Added 2 TBS sugar since I’m used to that in cabbage soup. Will definitely make again.

This is a great base to work from as I improvised with red cabbage, 1/2 the bacon and crushed tomatoes instead. I added more spices(celery seed, tumeric, white pepper, crushed red pepper, pink salt, italian seasonings and let it simmer longer than recommended.  Husband I both liked it.

I added 2-3 garlic and 1 small onion and it still wasn't that flavourful enough.  My man didn't have 2nd's which is never a good sign.  I had to use a whole cartoon (900ml) of bouillon rather than the 1 cup  that was recommended.   Won't be making this again.

I followed the basic recipe, using pancetta. I added a chopped yellow onion after sautéing it in olive oil and adding a bit of basil. I didn't realize onion was not included in the original recipe until I pulled there recipe up again to give it to a friend. 

The soup was delicious. It was pretty salty, between the pancetta and the chicken stock. That's finer me because I seem to like my foods saltier than most people. But, if you are a low salt person, you may want to use low salt chicken stock or vegetable stock or use half water. 

The soup is very flavorful and easy to make. Perfect for a chilly and gray March day.

I like this soup but it really needs to sit for a day.  The bacon seems to give it an unusual odour but it disappears after a day in the frig.

I used rotel chunky diced tomatoes and green chilies, for my soup. All off the reviews, I didn't see where anyone mentioned how hot and spicy this made this soup! Next time I'm going to use regular tomatoes! I also used regular bacon, but plan on adding some chicken sausage. 
Very easy to make.

Nice and easy! and good!  I scaled it down to one big bowl's worth because I was assembling leftovers.  I used (about)  3/4 cup chopped canned tomatoes, 1/2 cup of 1-inch cubed russet potatoes leftover from breakfast, 1 slice thick cut hickory smoked bacon (also leftover from breakfast), 1 cup thinly sliced fresh savoy cabbage, and homemade chicken broth, and 1/2 cup (weighed 50 g) small chop chicken breast for added protein, and I had to use it up!  -- my soup not nearly as pretty as yours but it was still delicious and I was able to use up leftovers in the making.   Seasoned to taste.  A great lunch in minutes!

I made this with thick regular bacon and light green cabbage (what I had on hand).  I followed the advice on these reviews and added more chicken broth, a wee bit of sugar, thyme, basil, and a bay leaf.  I also added a cooked chicken breast, cubed, for extra protein.  On my own, I added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and tsp of minced garlic.  This was absolutely delicious!!   I served it with fresh bakery bread and butter.  Super good!!!!

I love to make soups and make most of my soups in the slow cooker and will try this sometime again by that method. I made this on the stove top and really changed somethings because of time after working till 5pm on St Patricks Day. I was making Rubens ( had just made Cabbage Rolls) and wanted something with them. I must have Irish food! I chopped and cooked 12 oz of pepperedbacon. When bacon was alomost done I addded a chopped onion, garlic and the sliced cabbage and sauted. Added the diced tomatoes. To save time i added 2 cans of loaded baked potato soup and simmered. Adding chicken broth to reach the right thickness. Really a huge cheat BUT really good! Went great with the Rubens and I cant wait for lunch today for leftovers!I will make this again! Thanks!

Absolutely awesome!  I was unaware that Irish Bacon even existed so I used turkey bacon and regular bacon in stead.  Also, I had some leeks getting ready to expire so I added leeks at the same time as the cabbage and it turned out great!  Great recipe!

I used regular bacon and the whole family loved it. Will be making it again.

This was delicious! I made it in the crock pot over my lunch hour so it was ready when I got home from work. I could not find Irish Bacon and wanted to cut the calories a bit so I made it with Canadian bacon slices. I browned the bacon with one yellow onion then added diced baby red potatoes, some herbs, garlic salt and pepper and covered it all with chicken broth. It did take a full 32oz container to cover it. I cooked it on high for 6 hours then added the chopped cabbage the last 20 minutes. It was wonderful! Thank you for sharing!

I halved the recipe and used regular bacon. I did not use any salt, but I added dried basil, oregano and parsley. It was a great hit!

Woke up to snow, again!  Wanted to make some soup.  Found this recipe in my e-mail.  Had Smithfield bacon and a bag of ColeSlaw mix so those were my only changes.  The soup was easy to make and tasted great.

My sister and I really liked it, but beware adding the rotel tomatoes as suggested by someone.....made for too much "kick".

We used the kielbasa and it was perfect!  We also made a soda bread that made this the perfect meal.
