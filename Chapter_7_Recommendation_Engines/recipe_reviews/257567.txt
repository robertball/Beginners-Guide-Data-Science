Not a bad recipe. I do not like prepackaged pancake mix so I added sugar to mask the taste and I also added some raspberry extract to give it a little extra raspberry flavor. If I made this again I would probably make my own waffle mix but that’s my personal preference.

I must be spoiled by homemade buttermilk waffles, because these were only barely edible. I am not a fan of bisquick and had hoped the remaining ingredients would mask the fact they weren’t made the traditional way. Good idea, but it didn’t work for me.
