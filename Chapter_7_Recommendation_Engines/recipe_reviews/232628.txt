I LOVE goat cheese and mango chutney, this combo was the best I've tried in years! Oh, I also added a lil' pepper sauce to the mango, that was amazing!

This was wonderful! I've never had mango chutney before and I loved it in this sandwich. The combo of the melted goat cheese and the chutney were perfect together along w/ the buttery, toasty bread...a definite keeper for when I have these ingredients on hand~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used what I had on hand, which was a blackberry jalapeno jam. It was fantastic. I will make this again, and vary it with other things. I think the mango would be amazing and plan to try that too.

Surprised to find my favorite grilled cheese here! I actually had 2 for lunch today This simple recipe also works really well using extra-old or sharp white cheddar, sandwiched between slices of homemade sourdough. I like adding some finely minced South East Asian type chilis as well, small the red or green ones. I used to use store-bought mango chutney but now use my own that I've canned, which makes this sandwich even better.

I mixed the chutney and the goat cheese in a bowl before spreading on the bread.  Yum!  Spread it on leftover hot dogs buns and a sliced loaf of bread from a restaurant.
