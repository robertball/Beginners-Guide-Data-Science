These muffins turned out delicious! I added a little bit more oil (about 1 T) because I didn't have any eggs, closer to 2/3 c sugar (I like things sweet), 2 T or so more flour, and almost 1 c of chocolate chips. The secret with muffins is DO NOT OVERMIX. I added the chocolate chips (or whatever your choice ingredient is) into the dry ingredients to prevent overmixing. When you add the wet to the dry, mix with big strokes until it looks like there is no flour left in the bottom of the bowl and then stop. The mix should look moist (stickier than cookie dough). Delicious!

The texture were very bread-like and pretty heavy. I added chocolate chips & coffee, so the taste was fine, but I definitely needed a glass of milk with these.

I used about 1/2 c bacon bits, 1/2 c cheddar cheese, one whole egg, only 1T sugar & 1/2 c ranch dressing. These turned out very moist. Everybody loved them!

Awesome recipe!!  I used a whole egg, and split the batch into 3 bowls; added dried cranberries and almond extract to one, hot chocolate mix and chocolate chips to another, and the last added parmesan cheese, rosemary, thyme, and italian seasoning.  They all came out great! Will definately make again.
