I read one of the responses to this recipe about not boiling the broccoli rabe. Boiling it is a must. My grandmom was from Italy and made broccoli rabe all the time. She would definitely boil it and the stems are supposed to be soft. Everytime my dad and I eat broccoli rabe somewhere he constantly complains if the stems are hard. It ruins the broccoli rabe. It is usually not a bright green color. It is more of a dark color. Take my advice!!

I grew up on broccoli rabe. If you love the flavor of hearty green vegetables, try making it like native Italians do. Instead of boiling add the broccoli rabe raw to the hot oil and garlic in a large skillet. Stir and cook until bright green and a little tender, less than ten minutes (or longer if you like it thouroughly cooked). That's it. 
Try it with some red pepper flakes. Enjoy!

First of all, remove stems, all you want are the leaves and the flowerettes on the top.  Boil in salted water.  Remove.  You can either saute this with garlic and olive oil, or parboil then finish cooking in broth.  Add a can of cannellini beans or dark red kidney beans.  Be sure to use fresh garlic.  A little onion powder and a bit of salt and pepper and you have a low calorie, very healthy meal.

YOU HAVE REFORMED ME!!  I have always wanted to love broccoli rabe, but have always hated the bitterness when you just saute it.  BOILING IS THE SECRET.  The bitterness is gone and it is delicious.  So nice to have a new healthy veg; I now cook it at least once a week.  I also used this method with Broccolini and it, too, helps eliminate the bitterness.  I am looking forward to trying this method with Chinese Broccoli from the Asian Market as that too is so bitter and very very similar to rabe.  THANK YOU!

I make this recipe often, with a few changes:

I serve this over penne pasta, use 4-6 cloves of garlic, and saute 2 large tomatoes, quartered. 

After I blanch and drain the broccoli rabe, I saute the tomatoes for approximately 10 minutes on medium low while I cook penne pasta in another pot. I then add the drained broccoli rabe to the tomatoes and saute for an additional 5 minutes. Served over penne pasta with a generous amount of Parmesan or Romano, this has become one of our family standbys!

Broccoli rabe is an acquired taste, even for native Italians (my dad is from Naples and mom is from Trieste - neither of whom would touch the stuff until I cooked it my way). The recipe submitted is basic but can be enhanced this way. Trim the ends of the stems. Bring a large pot or saucepan filled with salted water to a boil. Immerse the BR and cook for no more than 8 minutes. Drain immediately, flash chill and then spread on cookie sheet to continue cool down. The BR will be bright green yet tender. Cut the BR into bite size pieces. Saute some garlic to taste and a few hot pepper flakes in olive oil - about 3 tbsp. should do it. Then add BR, toss to coat and remove from heat when warmed through; you don't want to lose that beautiful bright green color. Place on a serving plate, top with a squirt of lemon juice and maybe some homemade toasted breadcrumbs. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and enjoy.

This was tasty and I'll make it again - but with less oil and maybe half as much time boiling.  The boiling seems to remove much of the bitterness from the broccoli rabe, although there's enough bite left that it still tastes like broccoli rabe should taste!  However, although the flavor was great, the texture got just a little mushier than I'd like.  Also, mine came out a little oily and I would cut down on the oil next time.  That said, I really liked this recipe and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sending it in!

I love veggies, but have never had broccoli rabe.  I cannot get it anywhere around where i am from.  Is there something that compares in taste that I might be able to substitute?...Thanks

I just finished making this and it is absolutely delicious.  I can’t wait to make it again.  The only thing I did different was to use 3 cloves of garlic and add a sprinkle of red pepper at the end of cooking.  Thanks for real keeper.

This is delicious!  I use a lot of garlic and I add crushed red pepper, season with salt and pepper.  We made this for a  roast pork sandwich with provolone cheese  and Italian long hot peppers.   Fantastic!

This was very good and my first attempt at broccoli rabe. I think maybe my husband over cooked the rabe but the flavor was great :)

i've boiled it, sauted it, microwaved it, added lemon, salt, pepper, honey, cross cut the stems, added parm cheese and the only way to get the bitterness out is to use another vegetable. This stuff cannot be made without the inedible bitterness. Chinese broccoli is totally different. Par boil Chinese broccoli first, stir fry it or saute it and it is the best.

I am a huge broccoli Rabe fan!! I have aways just sauted it a bit and add just a little water to get it cooked. The bitterness never really bothered me or for that matter, crossed my mind or taste buds. I figured that was the way it was supposed to taste. The flavor is Fabulous!! It can be hard to find but when I do, I grab a couple bunches,cook it all up and freeze asmall portions of it for later dinners. I do the same with collard greens.  If you haven't tried this spring time veggy, you Must.  It is very good, it's better with some bacon sprinkled in it too. LOL  Thank you Maria, I will be making this again and again!

This was a hundred times better than I thought it would be! We'd had this at our favorite Marble Falls restaurant, Cafe 909, and still remember it four years later. So when I saw it fresh in the store I picked some up in hopes to make something similar. This was above and beyond my expectations! I can't wait to make more.
Updated: Made more. Still just as delicious!

Add another voice that says you must either blanch or lightly boil broccoli rabe (a.k.a. Rapini). I like bitterness, but unblanched this vegetable is simply too bitter. An Italian friend told me the secret and now I love to have this vegetable from time to time. This recipe was perfect with my Chicken Cacciatore! Thanks for posting!

Thank you so much for this recipe! I removed the stems, my personal preference, but definitely don't need to. I just had a spinach in Bostons North End and I think this is exactly how they made it. I will try in the future.

I do not eat this myself, but I make it for my g/f all the time and she loves it. In case you are having trouble finding it in the store, it is also called rapini (guess it depends on where you are). My g/f likes it bitter, so she makes me look for the one with the most flowers, the more flowers in the bunch the bitterer it is

I had rapini at a restaurant not long ago and loved it. So I bought some and steamed it at home for dinner. Ugh!! It was so bitter I just about died.  Thank goodness for this recipe! After my first failed attempt, I tried again with these tips and it was much, much better. I would say that yes, boiling is the key to getting rid of the bitterness. Next time I might try this with a few drops of lemon juice...

My mother added olive oil to about an inch or less of water salted to taste. She cut off the tough thicker stems and added the clean broccoli rabe and plenty of chopped garlic to the boiling water, covered the pot, stirring as needed. Allow greens to cook down to that lovely green color which is just about tender or to desired tenderness. Delicious! No frying in oil needed!

I just made this for pork & broccoli rabe sandwiches and it came out great.  For years I have been steaming the broccoli rabe and then would saute it with the garlic, and it would still be pretty bitter.  Boiling is definitely the way to go!

This recipe was enjoyed by my Italian family for many years, except, we serve it over spaghetti.  It is also delicious over linguine or cavatelli.  If serving over pasta add more garlic and olive oil, otherwise, it may be a little dry.  For a little bite, add red pepper flakes.  Enjoy!!

I've been making this recipe for a long time and I am addicted!  I started making this dish as a meal instead of a side dish.  I add extra galic because we love garlic! I also add a few pinches of hot pepper flakes to spice it up.  When the rapini is cooked, I toss in some pasta or cheese filled tortellini. I comes out a little dry because there is no sauce, so I add more olive oil and throw in 2 or 3 diced fresh tomatoes.  Comes out great!  If I could eat this every day, I would!

This was pretty good. It definitely needed salt and pepper. Next time I will double the amount of garlic and skip the first step of boiling the broccoli, it came out too soft for our taste.

Excellent. My first experience cooking broccoli rabe. Will not be my last. Followed recipe but used extra garlic, and didn't use cheese (didn't need it!). Thank you Maria.

Wonderful and so tasty. Boiling (or simmering) does cut the slight bitterness a bit. I suggest cutting stalks in half and cooking the bottom stems for a bit longer than the tops so that the stalks are tender and the flowers are not overcooked. Enjoy!

I enjoy that the recipe is simple enough to enjoy the natural flavors. I usually reduce the amount of oil used and increase the garlic

This is the BEST way to prepare Broccoli Rabe.  Some recipes call for adding a bit of the cooking water...but that makes it very bitter.
I usually fry up hot Italian sausage links, then add them to the olive oil, garlic and Rabe....let simmer till done, add the cheese and eat with Italian or French bread.

Wow!! :D didn't have parmesan. Still great. Used like 3 garlic cloves. You could cut the oil down to 3 tbsp. Could be awesome with a bit of soya sauce or balsalmic vinegar thrown in after the garlic.

Very good. I did cut down the oil somewhat as a personal preference. One benefit to this cooking method, I was able to simmer the vegetable in an early stage of preparing a meal, shock it in cold water to stop the cooking, then hold it while I prepared other items, and sautee it just before service. Having read other reviews, I do have a few tips. Broccoli Rabe aka rapini is located with other cooking greens at my grocer, not with the broccoli and cauliflower. Look for perky leaves and few florets. Florets should not be yellowing. Also, bitterness compliments richness... I served this side dish along homemade fettucine alfredo.

I didn't boil the Broccoli Rabe before adding it to the garlic and olive oil. I just simmered the whole concoction for about 15/20 minutes. AMAZING!

Hubby loved this.  The kids and I liked it, but rappini is a bit too bitter for us.  I didn't want to overcook it, so I only boiled it for about 3-4 minutes until crisp tender, then finished it in the fry pan.  Maybe that's why it was a little bitter.  I think I prefer regular broccoli to broccoli rabe - but it's all just personal preference.  Still a good recipe.

The best Rabe is quickly sauteed in very little olive oil first to bring out all the color. Then add 2 tablespoons of water for a 2 minutes and cover. Do not overcook, watch it. At the end add a couple pinches of sugar to counter act the bitterness of the Rabe and a little salt, pepper, and vinegar....delicious.

This is a very good recipe. The only thing I changed was this: I cut the stems off the heads, about mid-way. I added the stems to the water and boiled for 5 minutes...I then added the heads and boiled for another five minutes. This allows the stems to soften and makes the dish MUCH better.

I always wanted to try broccoli rabe but wasn't sure how to make it until this recipe! I've made this twice so far and we love it! I use a shredded 4 cheese from tops (Parm, Romano, Asiago & Fontina) to top off this great side dish. I will definitely make this again :>)

DO NOT BOIL omg.  It came out like this green paste...green mush.  Broccoli rabe should be simply sautéed with garlic and oil stovetop.  The poster below is right to say skip the boiling.

Add some crushed red pepper, about 1/4 tsp for my taste, and you're in the money! Also, I have alternated using chicken broth instead of oil at times and it is very delicious too.

My grandparents and parents made this as well.  They (grandparents) came here from Italy. Trim the stem and pull leaves apart or break into large pieces. Wash thoroughly. Soften the garlic in olive oil in a stock pot. Then alternate layers of the greens, salt & pepper in the pot. Stir until they are all covered in garlic and olive oil. Add enough water to just cover the greens and simmer. Depending on how well done you like it-crisp tender or soft cook 15-30 minutes. A variation for flavor would be to brown some bacon in the pot first, keep about 1TBs of grease, add a little olive oil, sautee the garlic then add the greens. You also can make it 'soupier' adding more water, or by adding a can of Cannelini beans with the juice of the beans for flavor. Top with grated parm.. Mangia!

This is EXACTLY how broccoli rabe should come out, not bitter, tender and with a hint of garlic.  It is also an excellent base, you can add many things to this to make it a meal initself.  I love to add sweet italian sausage, white wine, and chicken broth.  Of course its fantastic as a sidedish too.  Toss with your favorite pasta (I prefer large shells) and you have a hearty pasta dish! The only change I would make is add more garlic!  This is the only way I will EVER cook broccoli rabe! Thanks!

This is just what I was looking for.  The only change I made was to sprinkle some balsamic vinegar on top once everything was done cooking.

I too have made this recipe for many years. The only difference is I peel the stems.  It is time consuming, but the rend result is that you can eat the stems as they are soft.  I learned that from Julia Childs many years ago to peel regular broccoli so that the large stems can be cooked and are soft and are really tasty.

I boiled in chicken broth instead of water, then prepared as recipe states, and it came out very good! Definitely a good "go-to" method for broccolini, and more than likely for any other bitter green too!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and we still found it to be very bitter.  I had rapini a while back in an Italian restaurant and don't remember it tasting bitter at all.  Maybe I'll try boiling it for longer than 5 minutes next time.

I agree with Cheereo. My whole family has always loved broccoli rabe, but I couldn't get past the bitter taste of it.  This recipe takes the bitterness out of it and we now have it 2 or 3 times a week.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made it as is and then taste tested...it was a little bland.  I added 2 tbs. of italian bread crumbs, a dash of red pepper flakes, dash of seasoning salt, and a dash of italian seasoning.  It was so good I had to have a small appetizer bowl for myself while I was cooking and throw in another batch for my family as I knew it for sure wouldn't be enough :)

This was my first time both cooking and eating broccoli rabe.  It was too bitter for me, but my boyfriend said he didn't mind the bitterness.  Overall, not too bad, but maybe next time I'll try boiling it longer.

I think a quick blanching at a rolling boil for 3 mins. is sufficent to not overcook the rappini. For an asian variation on this dish stir fry as directed and toss lightly with Oyster sauce. Delicious!

This was excellent.  Never ate broccoli rabe before and my husband and I gobbled up the whole pound!  I used much less oil (2 Tbs) and two cloves of minced garlic.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for introducing me to a new vegetable.

I was delighted to see broccoli rabe in my first CSA box this afternoon. It's been a few years since I cooked it myself. I chose this recipe to use because I vaguely remembered boiling my rabe and then sauteing the last time I made it. Some of my stems were still really hard, but the stuff that cooked right was WONDERFUL. The stems were probably woody due to the lateness of the season, not the recipe. In the future I'll cook rabe when it's still chilly out and check the stems out before I boil.

I like this recipe because it's basic and delicious. I had never even heard of broccoli rabe (rapini)until my best friend served it to me at dinner a few years ago using this same recipe. I became a fan.

I probably make this once a week and sometimes I serve it over fresh pasta.  I always add chili peppers and salt (but I like my rapini on the salty side).  It is absolutely delicious.  On the topic of boiling it first...I have done it both ways and much prefer NOT to boil the rapini first.  I find if it is boiled it takes on a completely different (less favourable) flavour.  I never have trouble with the stems being tough because I cook it in the oil for a good amount of time (approximately 10 minutes.

This is a good simple method for sauteing broccoli rabe.  I don't particularly like parm on mine, but the amount of garlic and olive oil is perfect.

This is just a nice Italian style way to cook any vegetable.  Especially great with string beans.

Good. I would give it higher ratings, but I had to substitute the main ingredient (the broccoli rabe) with spinach, since my grocer did not carry the broccoli rabe.

Broccoli rabe is a bitter green and is an acquired taste for some. Adding a pinch or two of salt when sauteing with the garlic will balance the bitterness.

Very good, but too oily. I decreased the oil, increased the garlic, and added red bell pepper for both flavor and color. Loved that addition. I'd give this after my tweaking to my taste a 5 star. The cooking method worked great for me, no bitterness. This will be a regular side.

This recipe was great!! I love broccoli rabe and this recipe definitely satisfied my cravings :) Couple of things though. Next time I will boil it for 3-4 minutes instead of 5 as it was on the soft side... I used less oil than the recipe called for, about 1-2 tablespoons and this was enough. I think if I would I used 5 tablespoons, it would have been too oily. Overall fantastic recipe!

Great recipe. Next time I will cut off a bit more of the "tough" part at the bottom -- a few bites were too hard and stringy.

This turned out great!  I followed some of the recommendations and only boiled it for 3 minutes. I also added a bit more garlic as well as some salt.  My whole family loved it, including the picky seven year old.  Our eight year old even asked for seconds!  We will definitely make this again.

This is a great way to prepare rapini. I put mine in an ice bath to stop the cooking after blanching. The blanching gets rid of a lot of the bitterness. Although it's great by itself, I like it with rigatoni, Italian hot sausage, and drizzled with a quality evoo.

This was the first time I've cooked or eaten broccoli rabe.  My children didn't like it because it was 'greens' but I thought it was great.  Something new to add to my diet.  Always looking for new things, especially if they are healthy.

This my first attempt at broccoli rabe, but certainly not the last.  I did find mine a little tough to chew, but I think that made us get full faster which is a good thing.  I skipped on the parmesan cheese and tossed it with stir-fried chicken and served it over rice.  Very yummy!

My husband, who hates vegetables above all else, stated that he loved how I did the broccoli before the rest of my 4-course meal.  He especially hates broccoli!!  I negated the garlic since the other parts of the meal were garlic-coated, but I'm sure they would have been lovely.  Put dollar store parmesian on top, put in 425 degree oven for 15 minutes, then stirred, added more cheese and toasted for 5 more minutes.  Amazing!!  I myself love raw veggies more so than cooked ones, but I could eat this for days.  I would make this a million more times for my veggie-hating husband and he would have no complaints!

Easy and yummy and not bitter at all.  Thanks!  I'm curious, though, if the boiling causes these healthy veggies to lose a lot of their nutritious value (especially since the cooking water was so green!).  Oh well!  :)

Delicious! I usually hate Broccoli Rabe and I couldn't stop eating this.

I love making this.  Last night, ended up doing some experimenting as well.  Fried up some bacon while the b.r. was boiling.  Removed the bacon when it was *almost* to the point we like it, and then sauteed chopped garlic and onion in the bacon grease.  Added the drained b.r. to the pan and sauteed.  When the b.r. was just about done, added the bacon back and finished cooking everything.  Added the parm while in the pan and mixed up a bit then served with extra on the side.  can't wait to do this again!

I don't know why everyone is changing the recipe.  It taste perfect just the way it is.  If I'm in the mood then I'll add some cayenne pepper but otherwise I leave as is.  Good job Maria.

This was quite good. I will agree with previous people and say that the boiling is the key! Also, I would use 2.5 tablespoons of oil next time. 5 is too much. Also I had to add some salt for taste and I added a tablespoon of salted butter as well. Made it taste perfect!

We were introduced to this veg. years ago in Europe but it does need careful cooking and either boiling or steaming it first is a must.    This is a good recipe just a little too much Olive oil. Also, cooking in chicken broth enhances the flavor.   If not using broth you need to use a pinch of salt to combat the bitterness.

I prepared according to recipe, as I have never cooked Broccoli Rabe before. It was very bitter, and mushy. I don't know if it was the quality of the rabe, or if that is what is supposed to taste like. I was dissapointed, as I thought it would be much better for the price it sells for in the grocery store!

This is wonderful and my vegatable hating husband LOVES THIS.  My only change is I steam the Rabe for about 4 mins. in a steamer bag with minced garlic and fresh cracked pepper.  After removing from the steamer bag I finely grate parmesan cheese on top.  My husband will eat this every day if I made it.

Fantastic!  I have to admit that this was our first time ever having broccoli rabe and I saw it at the grocery store and decided it was time to give it a try!  Prepared just as the recipe states boiling first and then sauteeing.  Really enjoyed this although my husband would enjoy the broccoli rabe more so in a dish (ie: with pasta and meat) instead of as a side (he found it somewhat bitter).  Served with Lundberg rice (blend of wild & whole grain brown - excellent rice!) and some baked chicken thighs (Kickin' Chicken from Eat Shrink & Be Merry)!

As other reviewers have mentioned. . .DO NOT boil your broccoli rabe. Use a few tablespoons of EVOO and chop up some garlic (the more the better) saute the garlic for two minutes (don't burn the garlic) add in the broccoli rabe until it turns a bright green color. Delish!!!!

If you want bitter broccoli rabe with tough stems then steam it. Otherwise be smart and don’t listen to this recipe. Boil it. Also don’t mince your garlic and add as suggested.   Slice your garlic and place in oil. Then you can take it out or serve the garlic.  You want a supple taste of garlic. Also you need a good amount of salt in the water.   Take it from me. I am first generation Italian and my parents owned Italian restaurants.  Si non mi creda fai quello che  vuoi.

Super Recipe!!  This was my first time making broccoli rabe.  I had always bought it from our local Italian specialty shop.  This is definately better.  I followed the recipe with two small changes.  I added red pepper flakes and increased the garlic.  Excellent!!  Thanks Maria!!!

So good. I cut off the thick stems, par-boiled the broccoli about 5 min., added garlic and oil and some minced onion to a sauté pan added the broccoli and cooked until tender. After removing from pan added some parm cheese. Perfect.

This is the authentic Italian way, minus the cheese. I believe boiling takes the bitterness away. I too cut off all the stems, who likes chewy rapini??!! This is such a healthy side!

5 minutes is definitely too long if you want the broccoli raves to be firm! Mine turned out to be soggy already... :( simple enough way to cook them though which is how I like it.

I grew up eating Broccoli Rabe (I just call it "Rabe") and as a youngster, wasn't such a big fan of it because it IS BITTER!!! 
 However, there is hope, if  you want to try it.  First of all, you really need to blanch it for 5 minutes.  It takes away the bitterness and it's quite tasty!  I usually add a can of tomatoes or just cut some up (if I have canned on hand, I use it, otherwise, I just grab some out of the garden).  Use however much garlic you like.  I like lots of it, so I'm heavy-handed with it.  I brown the garlic, add the steamed rabe,  and some cut up vegetarian sausage.  If you use real pork sausage, then make sure it is cooked THOROUGHLY!!!!  While the rabe is cooking with the garlic and sausage, I toss in a bit of vegetarian broth, the tomatoes and cover it for about 15 minutes.  While the rabe is going with the tomatoes and sausage, cook up some pasta.  Spaghetti, linguine or penne work well with this.  Mix everything together after the pasta is cooked, top with lots of Parmesan cheese and dig in!

Broccoli rabe takes some getting used to but it is so healthy so I tried this recipe to try something different than the traditional vegetable side dish. This recipe was really nice. I made it exactly as stated as I always do when trying a recipe out for the first time on allrecipes. It works exactly as  instructed. Thank you so much!

Oh my this was good! My husband and I are still talking about it. We grew up on broccoli rabe and love the simplicity of this dish. I always add a tablespoon(+/-) of sugar to the boiling water before adding in the broccoli rabe. This was a tip my grandmother always did stating the sugar takes the bitterness of the broccoli rabe away. Aside from that, I followed the recipe to a T. I would suggest using the best parmigiana you can afford and grate some shards on top as that adds an extra element in this dish. Next time I may add more garlic, a pinch of red pepper  & some shallots.

Excellent,  I think it depends on how young you're broccoli is as to how long you boil it, mine took about three minutes.  The flavor was not as bitter as usual.  Thank You for submitting a great recipe.

I agree that rapini is hard to find but if you're lucky enough to have a "Sprouts" in your town you can always find it there.  

I believe this recipe would be good with brocolini but there's nothing like the taste of broccoli rabe.  It's not something that everyone will like because it does have a strong (some say bitter) taste but but I believe that's why I love it so much. Five year olds may want to pass on it, but if your adults haven't tried it you're missing a real treat.

This recipe was delicious.

UPDATE:

For an ultra-delicious dinner, 
Saute some anchovies in a saucepan, since I love them I add a full can of them.  Saute until they're dissolved.  Add rapini and heat through.  Toss with any kind of pasta and you'll be licking the plate.

Hints:  Don't skimp on the Garlic and if you previously used EVOO  to saute the broccoli rabe, use some butter to saute and melt the anchovies.  After tossing the broccoli rabe with the rest of the ingredients (you did add some red pepper flakes, right?) sprinkle with some freshly grated Parmesan 

You're welcome ( if you're a broccoli rabe and anchovy lover.)  Otherwise, please disregard this post.

I didn't even know what Broccoli Rabe was until trying this recipe.   Though I cannot say I would make this every day, I can say it is good enough for me.  Tasty yet in a basic kind of way.  Not really an exotic flavor.

I suggest boiling your broccoli rabe before proceeding with this recipe. This is so easy to make and uses minimal ingredients, AND it's good for you!  I love this recipe and decided that I wanted to make it into more of a meal so I added in some shrimp which I sautéed in the pan right after removing the BR to a serving plate.  Delicious!

I did one thing different. I put some Parmesan on the bottom as well as on top. I did not have to use any salt because the cheese had enough in it for me. It was so delicious that I went to the market to buy some more for the next day and they were out.  One bunch is just enough for one person.

Love this recipe but changed it slightly.  I cut off the large ends of the broccoli rabe and then chop up the leaves, florettes and the thin stems.  I then blanch the rapi and drain under cold water.  I heat just a little olive oil in a pan and add mega amounts of garlic (sometimes 7 or 8 cloves minced) to 2 or 3 heads of broccoli rabe.  Saute garlic for about 1 minute then add rapi to pan, stir around with garlic, then add 1 or 2 cans of  cannellini beans (don't drain) and cook for a few minutes until hot.  No need to add salt.  Add some pepper, sprinkle a little parmesan stravechio and you've got a great meal.  I eat this on a weekly basis whenever I can buy broccoli rabe.  The absolute best.

I used this recipe as a base but with the following changes. 

First, I took the skin off the stems and I boiled them for 2 minutes at the most. With the skins off you don't need to boil it for long. 
I cooled the rabe immediately after taking it from the boiling water. I used continuously flowing tap water instead of ice water. 
I found another recipe that called for throwing away garlic after it releases the flavor but I like it fried too much so after 1 min I took it off the skillet and put it aside on paper towel, to spread it over the finished rabe after frying it a bit. I think if I left it in a skillet, even for another minute it would have burned.
And then, I didn't really fried the rabe, but rather made sure that the oil with the garlic flavor and salt (I added it to the oil) is spread over it, and that's it. Basically a minute while continuously stirring it. 
I didn't add any cheese but the fried garlic made all the difference! Too bad rabe is seasonal or I'd make it all year long.

Fantastic.  Just make sure you know how you like your Broccoli Rabe.  For that harder and bitter taste, boil for 2-4 mins.  Once I found the perfect boiling time.  You couldn't get any better.

This was terrible!  I ended up with a pile of green mush and I only boiled it for 8 minutes. The florets disintegrated!

This was another experiment with a new vegetable! It turns out that I am not the biggest fan of broccoli rabe. However, this recipe was simple, and it honored the vegetable. My dining companion discovers that he likes the vegetable, and he really enjoyed it!

I made this for a party to go on roast pork sandwiches.  I didn't love it, but it was a huge hit with my guests.  It was really easy to make, and was just enough for the six pounds of roast pork in gravy I had for the party.
