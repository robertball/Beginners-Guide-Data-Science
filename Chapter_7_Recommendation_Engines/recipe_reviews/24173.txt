This was a pain to make. The first sandwich came out ok, the second fell completely apart and ruined the oil, and the third got fried onto my spatula (yes, a metal one!) I think I'll try again with a skillet and only an inch of oil so I can control it better. If it still doesn't work too well, I'm giving up and going back to my homemade cheese sticks.

This is called "Mozzarella en Carozza" which means Mozzarella in carriages. It is Italian and is similar to the American grilled cheese. A great add is to serve over a touch of red sauce and top with garlic cloves sauteed in balsamic glaze and a few diced tomatoes..

This was ok, but to me it should be called deep fried grilled cheese.  I tried it thinking it would give the taste of mozzarella sticks ... won't be making them again.

My daughter and her boyfriend made these and they were a hit. Too greasy for me, but I was out numbered by everyone else who thought they were awesome. Thank you Carol!

I'm going to make this with fried zucchini or eggplant. Seems like it would be awesome. Thanks for the idea*

It is hard to call these sticks.  Sandwich is more appropriate.  I held them together with toothpicks.  They are best hot out of the pan.  I served these with marinara for dipping and a green salad.   Glorified grilled cheese at it's best.
