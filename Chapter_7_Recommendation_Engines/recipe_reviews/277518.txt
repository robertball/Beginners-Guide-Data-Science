Excellent recipe ~ the scones were perfect and exactly what I was looking for. I had a recipe years ago but couldn't find it and this was as close as you can get. I'm so glad I made these!

I just came across this recipe. I can’t wait to make these although I will need to wait until next year. I have two under two and it’s just not happening this year!
