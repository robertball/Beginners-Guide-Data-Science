My co-worker brought in a huge box of plums from his tree and I decided to make some bread.  Overall this is wonderful recipe and I think works best with plums that are not completely soft.  I used a potatoe peeler to peel these them and it helped alot.

Okay my experience with this is you can't get it wrong.  On a whim I decided to make this, I didn't have enought honey so I added a some sugar.  Didn't have enought sugar so I used splenda for baking for part of it and didn't have walnuts so I used pecans and the batter was dry so I added another egg and a little bit of milk to make the right consistency for bread(yes it was a cook on the whim because i wanted to but didn't want to go to the store).

This bread came out wonderful, moist in the middle and the sweetness &tartness of the plums was a nice touch.  

Very good and as you can see hard to mess up LOL

I rate this with 4 stars after I added an additional egg and about 1/4 cup of milk. Before the addition of these ingredients, the batter was  far to thick.

This makes a really great bread. But why are we peeling the plums? I pitted them, cut them in quarters and pulsed them in my processor 'til they were chopped. They worked fine, and we still had the extra nutrition in the skins. I did add 1/4 cup applesauce as suggested by previous cooks, since the batter did seem a bit dry. Loved the extra clove flavor.

I just made this bread today, using pitted prunes - it came out perfect, with a few changes, I reversed the amount of spices, less cloves and more cinnamon, and reduced the amount of sugar; also added a good 1/3 cup of milk and replaced the walnuts with pecans (the reason being that I have ruined too many recipes using walnuts since they almost always taste stale. The bread was chewy and more than sweet enough.

The plums have been changed from fresh to canned to more closely match the submitted recipe. Fresh, firm plums do not have the moisture needed for this recipe.

14-year-old daughter loved this bread, even though none of the kids ate the canned plums for lunch. (This is why I tried to find the recipe in the first place.) Didn't put in nuts, but otherwise followed the recipe. Definitely will use this over and over again.

SO delicious. I agree with the other reviwers that the batter was too dry. 
I added about 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of applesauce. Wonderful! Thank you!

Not a bad bread but I think the cooking time is too long. I used a glass loaf pan and the outside browned way too much. Will def try again and will cover the top to keep from browning so much and reduce the time.

Very yummy bread!...I rated it 4 stars only because I ended up adding about 1/3 cup of yogurt to the batter because it was so thick it almost needed kneading!  It was a great way to use up those leftover plums that had been lurking at the back of my counter.

I had a can of plums on hand and had no idea what to do with them, so after looking up "canned plums" on the ingredient-only tool I found this recipe. I wish I had looked up just "plums" (as I did later) because there seem to be a good variety of plum bread recipes that look better than this one. While I loved the spiciness of the cloves, the batter was far too thick and dry before I took others' advice and added 1/4 cup milk and an extra egg, and the cooking time called for dried out my loaf and made the edges burn, even though I took it out of the oven ten minutes early. I probably won't make this again, sorry.

My family loved this bread.  The batter was a bit dry so I added 1/4 cup of milk and it turned out great.  I made it 2 nights in a row with plums off our plum tree.  It was wonderful.

Very good, however I did add extra cinnamon and some applesauce since the batter looked awfully dry.  Nice and sweet, thanks much!

I am not a dessert person, but I love to bake. I made this twice, once at work and once for my boyfriends family. Everyone loved it!! The second time, my boyfriend wanted pecans instead of the walnuts and 1 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup. Needless to say, this is a great little bread!! Easy to make too!!

When I baked this, it browned on the top really quickly and did not cook through. However, when I ate the cooked parts, it was really delicious. I may try this again and try cooking it at 325 instead of 350.

I was disappointed in this bread. It just tastes kind of flat and isn't nearly good enough to justify how long it took to peel and chop the fruit! I think the lack of fat and salt in the recipe explains the flatness of the flavor.

We have a very prolific plum tree in our yard and I have been looking for recipes that would help use them up when I stumbled upon this one.  The bread is very good and easy to make!  It received 4 out of five stars based on the fact that I did change the recipe a bit by adding 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of applesauce based on other reviewers recommendations.  I also only cooked it 50 min and it was a bit burned on edges.  I will make this again, but next time at 325 degrees for 45 min. Overall the bread is yummy!  I loved the walnuts and cloves and will make it again as my tree still has a ton of plums on it.

Great use of abundant plums! The dough was pretty dry, but the plums were overripe, so after adding them to the dough it was perfect consistency - no need to add more liquid as others have done.

Good but not particularly great.  You couldn't taste the prunes/plums at all.

Very good. I agree, a great breakfast bread. A great way to use up over ripe plums. I made some substitutions, I didn't have 1/2 cup of honey so used 1/4 cup, I substituted nutmeg for cloves and used 2 eggs and 1/4 cup of milk like other reviewers. A very good bread, the plums add a great texture to the bread.

This probably would have been inedible in the hands of an inexperienced baker. I reversed the spices, added about 1/3 tsp salt and as I used home canned plums, I had to add quite a bit of the juice to make a usable batter. I think the addition of a bit of fat in the way of oil might improve the still very chewy texture. I might try it again but would have to fiddle with the ingredients more.

I loved this.  It reminds me of the plum bread I made with the canned plums my Mom did.  The spices were just as I remember.  I did use fresh plumcots and apriums in this batch and it turned out great.  Thank you for bringing back some great memories.

My sister and I made this and followed the recipe exactly. The batter was way too thick and needed some milk to thin it some. I was not a fan of the spices with the plums. I will never make this recipe again. It isn't moist at all and tastes really bland.

As written this is just a three star bread.  Way too dry as othere have written.  There was nothing special about it the first time I made it.  The second time I did not peel the plum but instead placed them in a food processor and chopped them. I used 2 full cups of chopped plum and added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar to counteract the tartness.  The bread turned out to be much better but still not exactly what I was looking for.

This was a good recipe for extra plums.  It was a bit too spicy for my family so I only used 1/2 of the spices.  It came out perfect.  Thanks for this one.

This is a great recipe! It appears to be a thick dough, but bakes up great with a slightly crunchy top.  The only bad part was how long it took me to peel the plums (which came from the back yard).  It was so tasty that I made another loaf for the neighbors.
