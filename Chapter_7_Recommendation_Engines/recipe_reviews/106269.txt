This is gourmet at home!  The only substitute I made was to use panko bread crumbs instead of the flour, other than these two changes I followed the recipe.  You will want to make sure to use unsalted butter as the serrano ham is MORE than salty enough.  Be sure to serve the sauce ASAP b/c it WILL separate if you do not!

This dish was met with rave reviews. I subbed pumpkin seeds for the pine nuts and apple juice for the apple brandy .(as that is what I had on hand.) Though the flavors seemed a strange comb for me it was delicious.

This is a delicious fish recipe with a lot of flavors. I used apple/white grape juice instead of calvados and didn't use ham. My only complaint was that the sauce was very buttery. So next time I will reduce the butter.

Delicious.  I didn't use the ham and substituted Grappa for the Calvados and used regular raisins instead of the white ones.   I also held back on the butter a bit.

Not bad. A little bland
