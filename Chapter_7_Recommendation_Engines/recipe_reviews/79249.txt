The name and description says it all...this is an easy and fun recipe. It was deliciously surprising(or surprisingly delicious)! I decided to try this because I had some orange flavored gin in my pantry, and I love olives. Since I had the orange gin, I seasoned my chicken breasts with freshly grated tangerine zest(I had no oranges), milled peppercorns, and salt-free chicken seasonings. I added some finely diced shallots with the garlic too. I also added sliced black olives in with the green olives. In addition to the gin, vermouth, and lemon juice, I added the juice from half of the tangerine I had just zested. I garnished the meal with finely sliced green onion and chopped fresh parsley. I served this with simple, buttered egg noodles, and fresh, crusty bread. What a wonderful meal! Thank you Jen for a great, fun, and easy recipe!

I love martinis and my husband loves green olives, so we enjoyed this dish very much.  Because we both like green olives so much, I tripled the amount of green olives (but if you're not a huge green olive fan, tripling it may be a bit much).  Also, there didn't seem to be a lot of sauce, and I was worried about the chicken getting dry, so I double the wet ingredients.  It turned out great!

This was quick and easy; and as a martini lover it was an awesome treat.  Very tender and juicy!  Next time I'll add more olives since everyone in my family loves them!

excellent. Substituting a good vodka for gin also is quite good. Found increasing sauce portion by an additional 1/4 or so is even better.

This tasted great.  I sauteed onions and mushrooms along with the garlic and added them to the mix.  I served this over pasta, but there wasn't enough sauce even though I doubled the liquid.  Next time I will triple or quadruple the liquid.  Too much sauce is better than too little; the extra can always be sopped up with some bread!

This was one of the best I have done in a while, and I've done lots.  I was surprised at the flavor, not at all like a martini, but the gin and vermouth did wonders to the olives, and that was the flavor that came through.  As normal, I only used 2 breast, but the full sauce.  Perfect!

Wow - this is great, especially if you are a martini fan.  Very easy, too!  I highly recommend adding some artichokes for added texture.  Yum!!

Delicious, easy, pretty quick. Only differences I made were substituting vodka for gin and using only 2 chicken breasts instead of 4.

Easy and tasty. I added some diced onion and followed other reviewers' advice and tripled the liquid to make more sauce and added more green olives, which made it a little too salty but yummy. Maybe should have tripled the lemon juice too since I felt it was missing something, which is why I give it 3 stars. But everyone enjoyed it. Maybe I'll add some chili flakes next time to jazz it up. I'd like to try it with vodka too, and maybe boneless skinless thighs for more flavour. Thanks!

This is wonderful.  I cooked it for my boyfriend and we both loved it.  I put about 1/4 cup of olive juice in addition to the ollives in this dish.  I like my martinis a little extra dirty!  I will definitely be making this dish many more times.

DELICIOUS! With the exception of S&P, I doubled the rest of the ingredients. I kept a lid on it while the chicken was cooking to lock in moisture - I made it before without and it came out a little dry/overcooked. Extremely flavorful and easy - will be making this again. Thanks!

Made this for some girlfriends and we all loved it.  It had a hint of a martini taste to it and love green olives so I used more then 1/4 cup.  Of course a little extra gin in there didn't hurt either.  I served this with Garlic Rice and they were great together.

This was a great chicken breast recipe.  I doubled the sauce as others suggested.  The chicken was very flavorful and olives were a wonderful addition.  I will definitely repeat this one.

Very nice dish, especially for gin fans!  I appreciated how simple and quick it was to make.  I did add one onion and one container of sliced baby bella mushrooms, and I also doubled the liquids as suggested by another reviewer.  Fantastic!

If you are making this recipe to serve over angel hair pasta make 4 times the sauce. I doubled the sauce recipe but it still wasn't enough.

Wow, do yourself a favour and make this recipe! The whole family loved it. If you prefer a vodka martini like me, it's no problem to switch the gin for vodka. I think I will double the sauce next time because it it so good.

Delicious and easy. Two of my favorite things when it comes to cooking.Wonderful blend of flavors with the right amount of pizazz. However instead of using the alcohol (makes me leary with the kids- even though I know there is no actual alcohol content left once cooked)and taking the advise of other readers about increasing the liquid amount, I used 1/2 C apple cider vinegar and 1/4 C apple juice, instead of any alcohol and it was awesome. The olives were unbelievably tasty, doubled the amount on those as everyone in my house loves olives. no other changes were made. Will  make this one again and soon!

Excellent! This recipe is very speedy to make, very unique and suitable for all ages. I substituted chicken broth for the gin (having poured all of my gin into a punch the night previous). I put in far more garlic and olives than the recipe called for. Don't overdo the olives if too much salt bothers you, though. This recipe has a delicate flavor, is almost dummy-proof, and, as other reviews have indicated, very adaptable to tweaking. I can't wait to make it again.

This is an awesome recipe and super easy.  I used others' advice about adding olive brine at the end and using blue cheese stuffed olives.  Great recipe for "wow-ing" company.

I've made this three times and really enjoyed it.  I double the sauce and thicken it with a bit of cornstarch & chicken stock.  I still feel like it's missing something, seems a bit like a 'single note' of flavor.  No idea what I would add though.

This recipe was really great. I'd give it a 5, but I baked it instead of sauteeing it. It came out lovely baked, I don't think it would have as much flavor sauteed.

Yum!! I doubled the wet ingredients because I like extra sauce and tripled the green olives. It was great with some garlic mashed potatoes.

good but next time I would cut up chicken to give it more flavor, double sauce and cook about 5 minutes less than rec.

Terrific.  Fed this to the whole family - finicky eaters all.  Went over very well - enjoying a martini while making is part of the fun.

If you like olives, you will love love LOVE this recipe!  The only change I made, like others, was to increase the olives to a good 1/2 cup.  I chopped them as well which made it almost like a tapenade... yummm!  I also pounded the chicken breasts down to about 1/2" on the skin side because I knew it would take too long to cook them all the way and didn't want to dry them out.  This also decreased the cook time.  They were absolutely perfect!!!  My husband and I fought over the leftovers!!!

This was delicious!  I doubled the wet ingredients and used olives that still had the pits (which, I think, adds extra yummy flavor).  This was delicious, I don't even like martini's, but this had an excellent, clean aftertaste and the flavoring was exquisite.

My husband and I absolutely loved this!  I used vodka but I doubt it changed the taste.  I did the rest by recipe, but I did triple the sauce.  I would even increase it next time.  I think I rediced it a bit too long, so we just had enough for 2.  So delicious I guess our servings of sauce went overboard!  I served it with the garlic spinach recipe on this site.  So fun to try 2 new recipes.  I checked out recipes that had ingredients I had on hand, and they are both great recipes!

Very easy and delicious! I didn't have gin, vermouth or lemon juice but I did have some grapefruit infused vodka which tasted great.  The liquids seemed to do away with some of the saltiness of the green olives.  Oh, I also added some chopped onion since I had a little in the fridge that needed to be used.  Both of my kids liked it (ages 13 & 9) but they like olives.

I didn't know what to expect with this??  I did double the recipe, and dice up the chicken rather then the whole breasts.  I used blue cheese stuffed and garlic stuffed olives.  I poured it over noodles.  If I make this again, I would probably make even more "sauce" it was a bit dry over noodles, the hubby poured some EVOO on the noodles which fixed the prob.

I made this for dinner Saturday night, and my husband loved it.  I floured the chicken with seasoned flour, (flour, salt, pepper and paprika), then followed the recipe at listed.  it was absolutely delicious.  Although the next time I make it, I will double the sauce. And I will be making this again, soon!

Wow, that was great.  I made it the first time and the olives in this dish was fantastic.  Wife just loved it and said I would be making it for her again soon.  I also had added about two two table spoons of finely diced onion.  Very good. I made it a second time and took the advice to add black olives too and it added a wonderful flavor to an already wonderful dish.   I put a picture of mine in my profile.

Other reviewers gave this such great ratings..Mine came out okay..I would try to make again just to see, but fiancee isn't a big fan of alcohol flavor..I substituted vodka for gin thinking it would be more mild- maybe should have stuck to original recipe..

Easy it was !!! I made this last night and everyone loved it. I loved how simple and quick it was to put together. I did follow some other reviewer's advice and doubled the sauce, which worked very well. This is definitely a keeper! Thank you Jen.

Wow, I loved this. Normally I like recipes that have lots of herbs and spices, but this was great! I did add a can of artichokes and a chopped, sauteed onion. Probably used a lot more olives than the recipe called for, and a bunch of black pepper. Followed other reviewers suggestions of doubling the sauce but I think I more like tripled it. Served on whole-wheat thin spaghetti. Something really new and different for me and I just loved it. Bonus is having left over gin, vermouth and olives :}

The concept sounded like fun, but we didn't find the resulting dish living up to all these stellar reviews. And, we followed the recipe exactly, doubling the sauce and olives as so many have suggested.

With all the high reviews I really thought I would enjoy this more. I pretty much stuck to the recipe. I just didn't find it very flavorful. The sauce was to runny. Maybe some tweaking can add some flavor to it. And maybe thicken up the sauce a bit. I served over pasta. It was good, but not what I was expecting I suppose.

Wow!  I impressed myself with this one!  The chicken was moist, flavorful, fantastic!  I did increase the sauce by doubling the olives, butter, gin, vermouth, and lemon juice.  I rough chopped the olives and also went a little heavy with the pepper just because we like it.  Served with Garlic Angel Hair Pasta.  Hubby and the boys all agreed that this was an awesome dinner!

According to my dad, the recipe was resturant quality!  So I take that as a compliment!  As a vegetarian, I made it with my fake chicken cutlets, and it looked just like the real thing! I also took someone elses advice and added onions and a can of artichokes!  Yummy! Will def make again!

I have made this about 4 times in the past two weeks it is so good.  I add some chicken broth to the sauce as well as bit of corn starch to thick it up and pour over the chicken.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes.

Yummy.  I am abig fan of Dirty Martinis so I figured why not.  This was super simple to make and had wonderful flavor.  The chicken was moist and everyone in the family ate it up.  I will definitley make again.

I chopped the olives, used vodka and olive juice. Also added sweet onions and mushrooms, and vest of half a lemon. Dish was fantastic.

I made this several times.  I did double the liquid as suggested by other reviewers.  It's a big hit in my house.  Specially with my daughter who developed a love for green olives at 5 because of this dish.

We're not martini drinkers, but this dish sounded too good to pass up.  I'm glad we tried it - we both loved it!  I followed other reviewers advice, and doubled the olives and sauce ingredients.  I served this over linguine.  The only changes I would make would be slicing or halving the olives, and at my husband's request, adding capers.  We'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Made exactly like the recipe  and our family thought it was very good.  I actually thought it tasted like  a less acidic  version of a chicken piccata sauce.  I would make it again, but add my personal adjustments for our families liking.  Rinse and add more olives.  Quadruple the sauce ingredients. Pound chicken( takes less than 2 minutes and we think its more tender this way).  Serve over angel hair,  or spaghetti noodles.

My five star husband(5*H) made this for dinner yesterday.  I had found the recipe on AR and it sound good and easy.  Plus the nutritional factors were just what our doctor wanted us to have.  5*H did the shopping for the ingredients as we had no gin or vermouth.  Then he went to work.  Taking the advice of other reviewers, he tripled most of the ingredients for the sauce. He only used 4 cloves of garlic. As this was cooking the fragrance was wonderful. He also fixed two lovely small salads, and medium egg noodles. 
After we ate, I telephoned all the children and adult grandchildren to brag on 5*H.  The meal was SOOOOO good. For those folks who look at the ingredients and feel hesitant, believe me - try it, you'll like it!

Delicious and easy! I made a few changes some reviewers gave me. Used half a medium chopped onion, sauteed that with the garlic for a while before adding the chicken to brown. I used chicken broth instead of gin because I didn't have any. I also quadrupled the liquid, but accounted that the chicken broth wouldn't boil off as easy, so I used 1/2 cup chicken broth instead of what would have been 1 cup gin. I chopped up the olives roughly, just a personal preference, and upped it to 1/3 cup. Came out wonderfully savory, not too salty, with an slight sweetness to it. My husband doesn't even like olives and he gobbled it up!

Few tips: If you can't have lemon juice (like me) use 1/8 tsp lemon extract instead. Some lemon zest would also do nicely. Also, if you need to reduce the broth further but the chicken is done, just take the chicken out and continue simmering the sauce for a bit. I also find using the fillet cuts (thin cuts) of chicken when pan cooking ensures more even cooking, at least for me it prevents overcooking the outside.

Great!! don't care much for breasts so used thighs, otherwise all the same.   My husband ate twice as much as usual, and asked me to make it again soon.   Forgot this, also had fried some maple flavor bacon for another recipe, so used 2 tbsps of the bacon drippings instead of olive oil.   Can't go wrong with that!!

This was good as written but not fabulous. I made it exactly as written. I had some left over which I sliced thinly and blended with the sauce...now THAT is 5 star flavor that just didn't pop until it was sliced and the sauce infused the meat. And, by the way, this made fantastic chicken for chicken salad. I will make again with this small modification.

Great way to use up leftover gin :) The gin flavor is not overpowering - definitely a hit for us!

Great recipe.  Ease of preparation an absolute plus.  Ended up adding feta and artichoke hearts, but flavor was was great before those additions.  Will probably add some black olives and/or some grape tomatoes next time for some color.

I will cut the salt out next time as I think the olives give it enough salt already, but other than that, I thought it was very good.

delicious!  I used the naked chick'n cutlets from quorn for a vegetarian option.  I also doubled the sauce as described in many of the comments and it turned out great!  Will definitely make this again.

My husband says that this is the best chicken dish that  I have ever made!  I left out the alcohol and it still had a good taste.  Thank you!
