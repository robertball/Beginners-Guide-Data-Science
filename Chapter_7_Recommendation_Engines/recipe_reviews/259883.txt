This was a fantastic recipe, but I did make some adjustments so I could use the ingredients I had on hand.  I did not add tofu, or miso broth, and subbed fish sauce for fish oil.  I also doubled the carrot, and used a bag of shredded  'cole slaw mix' to replace the 1/2 head of cabbage.  I also halved the salt because my chicken broth added plenty of salt.  Enjoy!

Delicious.  I didn't have fish oil, so I used a bit of fish sauce. Next time I will cut back a bit on the tofu.  This also tastes  good pureed  - adding the potstickers to the pureed soup at the end

I was disappointed in the cooking time instructions. I followed the 'simmer for 20 minutes at least' and the veggies were soggy.   To make it edible I added fresh bean sprouts to my bowl for some crunch. The flavour was good but  the sogginess  was  unappealing. Next time I will cut back the cooking time by at least 5 minutes, maybe more.
