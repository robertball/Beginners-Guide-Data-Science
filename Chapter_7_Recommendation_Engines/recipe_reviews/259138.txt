It's good, but I had to omit tomato sauce. I don't know what keto diet everyone else is on, but mine says no carbs or sugar, and tomato sauce is full of sugar. awesome recipe despite my concerns about that

This is fantastic and easy to make! Everyone in the house loved it! I did use the Rao's sauce (which doesn't have any added sugar) and remained in Ketosis.

Really good & love the pork rinds idea. 
I used normal butter though not ghee.

The only issue I had was the time, it took me much more time than noted to make this dish. I used the right size chicken pieces & so on but it took me much longer to get to temperature & also prepare the ingredients. Cooking time only 8 minutes, nope it took me much longer. The recipe takes longer than 28 minutes from start to finish.

This was really really good!  I  tripled it so I could feed the whole crew and did use the Rao's Tomato and Basil Sauce - it's pretty pricey but low in carbs and absolutely yummy.  Used my food processor to make the "breading".  Just pulsed everything together.  I made the whole dish a couple of hours ahead of time and put in oven at 350 covered for 20 mins or so until the chicken came back up to temp and then removed the foil and turned the oven up to broil (low) until the cheese was nice and bubbly.  Served with zoodles sauteed in lemon infused olive oil and a cesar salad (minus the croutons).  This one is a keeper.

Delicious.  The pork rinds make it nice and crunchy.  I used chicken tender size pieces and I would even use chicken nugget sizes and use the Marinara sauce for dipping.

Super good. I don’t know what it tastes like with the heavy cream because I did not have any, but I loved it despite not using it. It was SO yummy; filling and delicious! I used this recipe I found online(https://www.ibreatheimhungry.com/easy-keto-marinara-sauce-low-carb-gluten-free/) and made my own tomato sauce. I calculated the macros and it comes out to be less than 4 grams of carbs per chicken breast. I used 2 tbsp of Parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 cup of the tomato sauce per chicken breast! Highly recommend.

Absolutely delicious!  Our entire family enjoyed this meal - including our extremely picky 8 year old.  We doubled the recipe and since the kiddos were eating, we omitted the red pepper flakes.  Other than that, we wouldn't change a thing.

I was skeptical about this as I wasn’t sure about the pork rinds. They’re not something I’ve ever eaten before, but I’ve gotta say that this was AMAZING! I’ve had some pretty good chicken parmesan in restaurants before and this could easily rival any of them. It’s full of flavor and even my husband, who is not on keto, loved it. The only thing I did differently is I used olive oil to pan fry because I didn’t have ghee...still came out fantastic. Will definitely make this again.

Yes!!! So good! I’d leave out the red pepper flakes or use the very minimum though. Here’s the thing...my entire family hates keto! And really hates pork skins.  They went on and on about how they weren’t eating it. They loved it!!!

I was making 2 chicken breasts,so I made my own simple marinara sauce. Ingredients were sauteing 1 clove garlic in olive oil. I drained I 16 oz jar  of my own canned San Marzano tomatoes, then added the strained tomatoes to the garlic. I added 1/2 tsp basil, oregano, and 1/4 tsp course black pepper, and about 1/2 tsp salt. I let that simmer about 15 min while I incorporated the dry ingredients. After I processed the pork rinds, about 1/2 of a 5 oz bag to yield about  1 cup of finely ground rinds, I added all the remaining ingredients and included a tsp of flaked onion. I didn't  have garlic powder on hand so I used 1 tsp garlic salt and omitted the suggested salt  on the recipe. I made my own Italian seasoning  with 1/2 tsp basil, oregano, marjoram, parsley flakes, and 1/4 tsp black pepper .  I didn't use ghee, but really good butter work!

Fantastic!!!! Maybe even better than the regular breaded version.  I used tenders instead of full breasts for more crunch in each bite.

Actually this was pretty good.  I used some chicken breast and chicken tenders.  Increased the pork rinds and spices to accomodate all that chicken.  I used over 6 oz of pork rinds to make 1.5 lbs of chicken.  I will use this recipe quite a bit.  Thanks.

Following the keto diet (have been in ketosis for about 5 weeks now, could consistently losing weight) and made this recipe exactly as-is. It was absolutely delicious and I cannot say enough about the crunch - so good! Enjoyed one of the chicken pieces with San Marzano crushed tomato (~3-4 g sugar) and mozzarella cheese as described --- still in ketosis. The amount of carbs/sugar for one piece with cheese and tomato will not (and should not) kick you out of ketosis if you're not exceeding daily macros.

Literally SOOO good! And super easy. I had to leave out the pork because I don’t eat it and I made my own tomato sauce out of organic tomato paste (no sugar, no additives) and coconut milk. It came out perfect.

Wonderful recipe! My favorite chicken parm ever. Used the same skillet to fry and bake in, didnt transfer to baking dish and worked well. Also used more sauce. The sauce I used had no added sugar and was about 6 net carbs. Will definitely make this again.

I have chicken quite frequently so used pork chops instead of chicken for a change of pace. Otherwise, I followed the recipe closely. It was very good and approved by the family with the small exception of being a tiny bit too salty. Will definitely make this again with a bit less salt. I might even use chicken the next time!

Followed every direction. Only change was using Rao's marinara because it's very low carb. This was easy and delicious!

The coating all fell off the chicken in the fry pan, but it still turned out good.   I used no sugar sauce to keep it keto.

Is it just me or was there a lot of breading mixture left over after only doing two chicken breasts? 
Seems like for the macros to be accurate you need to adjust that part. I was able to bread 4 4oz chicken breasts and had none left over.

I used chicken breast tenderloins, Rao's, and omitted the pepper flakes. I shouldve doubled the dry ingredients to have enough for the chicken. 
Turned out amazing! Thank you!

If you're doing keto, you NEED this dish! Incredible flavor and tastes like the real thing. I didn't have enough pork rinds, so I crushed up some Whisps (parmesan cheese crisps) in with it and omitted the parmesan ingredient in this recipe. It was so easy and delicious. I also used avocado oil to cook the chicken to add some extra fat. Will probably make this weekly!

Best chicken I ever tasted. Didn't change a thing. Used low setting on broiler.  Chicken was perfect. This may just be my go-to recipe.

Used provolone slices of cheese instead of shredded mozzarella. This gave the the cheese a nice hard, brown surface while not melting everything off the top.

I made it Keto style for  Me and my older kids and traditional style for my husband. We all agreed that the Keto style  tasted better than the old way!! It was so tasty!! I dont think you need to add any salt to the breading though. The salt on the Chicharrones and parmesano is more than enough.

I made it for my family pretty much as written. My only problem was that I didn't want to cut the chicken breasts down and I had a hard time getting them done in the middle. Lesson learned; get those breasts nice and thin and you'll have much better luck!

I substituted mexican seasoning for italian seasoning (cumin, cilantro flakes, chili powder, pepper), used spicy chicharones instead of plain pork rinds, and in the same cast iron pan used for browning the chicken, spooned pico de gallo, a dollop of crema and a thin slice of goat cheese on each--turn the flame to low low, cover, and in 5 minutes, voila.  Add crumbled, crispy bacon with cilantro on top  before serving.

Loved it! My broiler burned it in under a minute so when I make it again I will bake it 20 min at 425. I will cut the salt and nix the hot pepper. I didn't have pork rinds on hand so used almond flower and flax. Next time I will use pork rinds out of curiousity but almond flower was just fine.

This flavor was really great. It was a little salty. I will cut the salt in half next time.
I didn't have pork rinds, so I used more parmesan in place of them.

WOW---this was DELISH!!  Huge hit with my husband and son, too!  Followed the recipe pretty close, but made a couple changes.  Had no ghee, so used around half each of butter and bacon grease to fry the battered chicken breasts. Used a generous amount of mozzarella, but still didn't look enough, so added a bit of parmesan on top, too.  Also, I used a good marinara sauce vs just tomato sauce (Lucini Organic Sauce Roasted Garlic Marinara--all organic and NO sugar added).  I doubled everything because I had 3 chicken breast halves.  Served it with fresh spinach with garlic, salt, and pepper sautéed in butter and bacon grease.

I did not follow the recipe exactly, some part from necessity and other parts from preference. For 1, even sugar free marinara is too high in carbs, so I used Alfredo sauce. I also don’t have ghee, so I cooked it in olive oil. I also finished the chicken off in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes because no way is 3 minutes on each side long enough to cook the chicken through. I did give the recipe 5 stars, though, for brilliance. Using pork rinds instead of bread crumbs as a low carb option is so smart, it blew my mind. It doesn’t taste like pork rinds, it just tastes like eating delicious, high carb chicken Parmesan.

Skipped the frying and cooked the chicken in the broiler.  Came out great - flipped it once before adding the sauce and cheese.  Was very salty, so next time I'll use only a 1/2 teaspoon salt.

This is amazing. I did some with the tomato sauce and some without as chicken nuggets. I could not believe how tasty it was because I have never cared for pork rinds. I could not tell the coating was pork rinds once I cooked it per these instructions.

This was great! I would use 1/4 of a teaspoon of black and red pepper next time...too  spicy. I ate this with zucchini noodles. This was the first time I’ve used pork rinds. ?? Will definitely make again for my family.

We all loved it - and my family has no idea I used pork rinds!! I did leave out the red pepper flakes since I have twin 5 year-olds. Thanks for the great recipe.

Easy enough and tastes great. Great leftovers! Used cayenne instead of red pepper... would use half as much next time.

It was great and easy to make. You do have to get over the taste and smell of pork rinds, if they are not part of your usual diet. The other spices helped!

I agree the time does not reflect the amount of time it really does take to make this dish. Took everyone’s feedback about the red flake chili peppers and I ended up using one of those Pizza Hut packets and only used one of those. Overall I really liked The Italian seasoning he think it’s what made the pork rinds taste different. :) I to use very little tomato sauce. On the back of the cab is has about 1/4 is a serving size for the nutritional facts in the back of Hunts tomato sauce, so are used half of that 1/4 of serving size to cut down on the carbs and sugar. :) I hope that helps! - Pebbles

I have made this. The first time it didn't look so good though still tasted good.  After reading some of the reviews prior to making this  I used less red peppers. Good thing as it was still a bit spicy. The second time I made it it looked and tasted very good. I didn't use the sauce. No other reason other than I don't like the sauce on my chicken. I used 1/4 tap of red peppers flake's. this was plenty for me. You can see the difference between the first and second time making this.

Hubby and I loved these. The only thing I have to say bad about them is that it looked like there was an explosion in my kitchen. They were messy to make. (maybe it was me)

Very good. You can'r really taste the pork rinds. However it made a great bread substitute.

I made this using pork loin instead of chicken. It came out very good. Be careful with the hot pepper flakes!

This turned out perfectly. The only change I made was to use spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce. The pork rinds were unique and added a lot of flavor.
