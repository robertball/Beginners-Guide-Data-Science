Do not use cheddar cheese; it was stringy until I put it in the blender, then it was very tasty.

1.28.17   I wanted to try this soup, but I just donâ€™t buy American cheese, so I did substitute Kraft 2% cheddar (it worked well, too).  Followed the recipe as written with the one sub mentioned and garnished with some paprika.  This is a solid, tasty cheese soup.  fuzzy656, thanks for sharing your recipe.
