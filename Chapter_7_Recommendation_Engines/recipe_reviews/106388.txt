This recipe came out perfectly with some minor changes--I do not use Splenda and didn't see that it was a Splenda-centric recipe so when I got to adding the sweetener part, I substituted 1/4 c. light brown sugar. I also left out the molasses altogether because I didn't want it to be overly sweet. I also doubled the recipe for our family's needs. The waffles turned out very fluffy, with just the right amount of pumpkin and spice flavor.

Wow! If you love pumpkin, you're gonna love this breakfast treat! What a great way to spruce up regular 'ol waffles with a nice touch of autumn flavors. I used a heaping teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice vs. cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. I also added a generous helping of vanilla to the batter. Next time I might add walnuts or mini chocolate chips. These were oh so good topped with maple syrup and a dollup of whipped cream dusted with a little pumpkin pie spice - YUM!!!

Absolutely delicious!  I normally like a lighter, crispier waffle, but these were so flavorful it more than made up for the fact that it never got crisp no matter how long I cooked it.  Only change I made was to use real sugar.  Barring a health reason, if you're just watching calories, I'm not sure why you wouldn't use real sugar...2T is only 96 calories, or 16 calories per waffle.  I'll leave the sugar in and skip the butter and syrup on top...these are so yummy they don't even need any topping!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious waffles. They do need a hair more spice though. I upped the cinnamon to 1 heaping tsp, nutmeg to 1/2tsp  and added about a 1/4tsp cloves. My family gobbled these up asking for more.

Turned out great. Don't use Splenda so just added 2 spoons of brown sugar and a splash of vanilla. Served with cream cheese and banana slices on top.

Incredibly moist and delicious. I agree they didn't have a super pumpkin flavor, but still very good. Added 1/4 C. chocolate chips which we both liked. I thought it may be too many flavors for chocolate chips, but ended up being delicious. I thought the molasses added the best flavor of all the ingredients. This recipe made 2 large round Belgian waffles.

Tried this today. Substituted persimmon pulp only because I needed to use that up and I would add a touch of sugar next time but otherwise it was great. Very light. Will make again

My whole family really enjoyed these.  I used unrefined sugar instead of artificial sweeteners, and 1/3 cup of pumpkin instead of 1/4.  They were very good, though I needed to cook them for 6.5 minutes or more instead of 5. Thanks for the recipe!

Super yummy, anytime of the year! I give it 4 stars because I didn't add the molasses and did not use artificial sweeteners. The batter was a good consistence with just the right amount of sweetness. A keeper!

I made a lot of modifications based on what I had on hand-so maybe I would've liked it better had I followed it exactly. I omitted ginger and nutmeg, replaced honey for the molasses, raw cane sugar for Splenda, unsweetened vanilla almond milk for milk, liquid egg whites for the egg, and unsweetened applesauce for canola oil. I also reduced the milk down to 3/4 cup, and increased the pumpkin to half a cup. It was good, but never got particularly crispy on the edges. It was decent once it had toppings-and my kids ate it, and they eat nothing. It made four large waffles-so you might need to increase based on your families size.

We Loved these!!! I didn't have any molasses, so I just used the Maple Syrup sweetened with Splenda(R). The recipe only made 4 waffles for us (which was perfect, actually). We will Absolutely be making these again!

I really enjoyed this.  It's an interesting way to mix pumpkin into a recipe.  This would be great to serve during the fall season.  There wasn't any aftertaste.

Kids loved this as their Halloween breakfast this morning!  Just sweet enough they didn't even need syrup.  Great flavor and a good way to use up that last little bit of pumpkin.  For me, this made 2 batches (8 total) of waffles.

This was really good! We had to use milk instead of buttermilk and I think it made it more moist because we couldn’t get it to crisp up at all. Next time I might try using a little less milk.

I thought this was good as written.  I did add a dollup of cool whip and a sprinkling of pumpkin spice to give a festive look as suggested by other reviewers.  This is an addition now  in my fall breakfast/holiday recipe book.

Wonderful!  My husband loved them!  I also substituted 1/4 C sugar for the Splenda.  The only other change I made was I used ground cloves instead of ginger.  We will make them again!

I'm a huge fan of pumpkin, but found myself disappointed by the lack of pumpkin flavor. I was really hoping for more PUMPKIN than WAFFLE! I'd make this again, but maybe try to alter it to fit my personal preference. 
Thank you Splenda.

Delicious.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used soy milk instead.  It's also fine without the molasses.  The recipe came out a little bit too thick so I added a little bit more soy milk.
