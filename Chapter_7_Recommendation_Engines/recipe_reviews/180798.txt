As soon as I came across this recipe in the reviews I immediately set out to try it.  Mixed this right up using my fav Coke Zero and I wasn't surprised at all when I found it...     delightful!  The best things come from simple yet creative ideas like this!

Great drink - my niece just loved it!  Definitely reminds me of a cherry coke. I'll be making this again.

We make this A LOT in this house. Works just as well with diet cola/"zero" cola. Awesome with a scoop of ice cream, too.

Whenever my brother & I went out to a nice restaurant as kids, I got a Shirley Temple and Timmy got a Roy Rogers. We thought we were so cool 'cuz they were served in 'grown-up glasses'. Thanks for bringing such great, ancient memories back!

If you like cherry cola, you'll enjoy this!  I use 1 teaspoon of grenadine, but you can adjust the amount to suit your taste.

I used one teaspoon of grenadine and three maraschino cherries, but didn't get that cherry coke flavour the other reviews raved about. Maybe because I used Coke Zero? I would use two teaspoons of grenadine next time... I prefer using Sprite, hence being a Shirley Temple (a little note... Try creme de menthe- the mint version of grenadine- in your Shirley Temple for a different twist).

Very good!  I like to save the cherry till the end when it absorbs alot of the coke flavor.  This is good make with sprite too.

This was great! It definately reminded me of a cherry coke AND a Shirley Temple, which was one of my childhood favorites. I used diet cola and two maraschino cherries....so refreshing and simple. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
