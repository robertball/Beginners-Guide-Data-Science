The first try I had at making this dish was a bit of a letdown - not the recipie's fault, my oven isn't the most even cooker in the world, so I ended up with burned glaze and half cooked pork.  The second time, after I played around with cooking times, it went straight to my family's "mum, can you cook that again, pleeease" list (even from the members who don't like pork, horseradish or mustard in most forms).  The glaze is wonderful, just enough of a kick from the horseradish to take away from the sweetness of the honey mustard and the pork.  It was well worth the second attempt.

Made just as the recipe said and it was delicious. My 11-year-old wanted to scrape the glaze off the leftovers and eat it with a fork! Peaches had good flavor - nice side dish to the pork. Will make again!

Wow! What a fabulous recipe!! Very easy and delicious! I prepared everything exactly as written with the exception of omitting the butter from the peaches. The peaches were wonderful without the butter. I have never used horseradish sauce before, but its addition made for a great taste for a sauce for the roast. The cooking time for the roast was correct and the roast was moist and delicious. I thought the whole recipe was great in presentation and flavor. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

I was slightly disappointed with this recipe...I found it lacked a little flavour.  I used a 1.75 lb pork roast (I was only serving 3 people), but I left the sauce ingredients the same with exception to the horseradish (I only used 1 Tbsp).  In the end, we found that while the pork tasted fine, I should have used all the horseradish to give it more flavour and the peaches didn't taste like anything except cinnamon.  So while it tasted 'fine'...I probably won't make this dish again because there are alot better pork roast recipes on this site.

Tasty for my sweet pork roast loving fiance. Added more brown sugar than recipe called for and used texas pete honey mustard for a kick.

Excellent recipe. My whole family loved this. I did add some cinammon to the glaze. Wasn't enough peaches for the whole family so next time would make more.
