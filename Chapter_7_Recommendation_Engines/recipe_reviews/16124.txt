Really liked this recipe except I don't care to much for rasins so I exchanged them for mandrin oranges the second time I made it.  I thought it was much better.  I will make it again.

This is the first Apple salad I have ever made or ever eaten!  It was delish!  Cutting and peeling the apples took longer than I thought.

Pretty sweet and fluffy--not the old-fashioned Waldorf Salad I'm used to--but a fun change and the kids gobbled it up!

Giving this five stars for quick & easy! I left the skin on some of the apples just for the color.  Used dried cranberries because I don't like raisins and cut the recipe in half for 6 people. It still made a lot, but it is a yummy snack. Thanks Kristine for posting this great recipe!

This was great! I used mandarin oranges instead of raisins, too. It was delicious and just sweet enough. The pinapple chunks are delicious. The only bad thing that happened was that it got a little "soupy" at the bottom. I'm about to take it to a Salad Supper at my church...we'll see how it goes! Oh, and it makes a TON of salad! Next time I might put a saucer upside down at the bottom of the bowl to catch the excess liquid that comes off.

Never made Apple Salad before and this was fabulous! Only change was that I used tri-colored raisins. Will make again!

This was not a good recipe for us; no taste/flavor to it.  the pinapple made it very sour.  Should have added something to the Cool Whip for more flavor.  If I were to try it again I'd add Jello pudding mix to the Cool Whip, but right now I'm not planning on making this again.
