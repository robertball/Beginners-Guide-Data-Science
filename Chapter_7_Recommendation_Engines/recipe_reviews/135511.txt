I thought this was OK but if I make it again, I will drizzle it with a little fat; olive oil, sesame oil...just a little something to make it a little more satisfying. Loved the soy sauce flavor, though!

This was FABULOUS! Snapper to me is somewhat strong, but this was the best. I did not have a lime so I used Pineapple chumks. Great combination with the Soy sauce. Family loved this!

We tried this tonite, but used Lemon & Oranges instead of Limes on Snapper fillets.  Quick, easy & light.  Will make again.

Had this tonight and it exceeded my expectations! The ginger made it really hot and spicy, and i didnt even put the full amount. I'm giving it just a 4 because i need about 10 minutes more cooking time and i found that the soy sauce was too much.

This was spectacular!  We grilled it, because it's summer.  We also used filets, because I bought the fish first, looked for a recipe second.  My hubby, NOT a big fish fan, said it is 5-star restaurant quality.  Definitely make again!

Fantastic recipe! 

I did do some slight changes - added chopped ginger and extended the cooking time by 15 mins because the fish was undercooked at 20 minutes when I opened the foil. I also reduced the soy sauce from 1/3 cup to 1/4 cup to make it less salty. Overall, a great Chinese-restaurant style dish!

The fish was very bitter. I couldnâ€™t eat it.

It was quite good and a great alternative for cooking fish. Had it with snapper and will try it with other fish as well.  Didn't change anything and don't think I would going forward.

I had a bag of red snapper that was frozen together in a clump that I had already cooked plain on low in a crockpot.   Found this recipe as I was looking for something to jazz up the plain fish.  I made a sauce with all the ingredients including  that I juiced the lemon and lime instead of using slices.    It was so delicious!  I would definitely make again.

I used about 3# of snapper fillets ranging from 1/4 - 1/2 inch thick.  They were baked to perfection after about 12 minutes.

I baked snapper fillets in the oven. I salt and peppered them, sprinkled crushed pineapple over the top, added sliced lemon and green onions. Covered with foil. Baked at 350 for 15 mins, uncover and bake another 10 and let stand for 5.
