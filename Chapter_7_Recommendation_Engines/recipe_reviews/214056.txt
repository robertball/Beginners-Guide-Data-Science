These were really good! Mine tasted great with the ranch dressing. I think it depends on the brand of ranch. Peppercorn might be too spicy... I used hidden valley ranch and it was very tasty. yum.

These deviled eggs were good, just different than what we are used to.  The bacon was a great addition.  The yoke was definitely better the longer the mixture set for the flavors to blend.  I will try these again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

LOVED these! I did add some finely shreeded cheddar as well. Would also be great w/ a little finely chopped green onion, which I will try next time. Couldn't be simplier! Thanks for sharing. :)

They are really good, but I added some sweet relish to tone down the tangy ranch.But overall if you like Ranch and Bacon you will like these.

These are a great twist on the traditional deviled egg. 

I definitely used way more bacon than the recipe called for... I can't say for sure exactly how much, but here's what i did: I cooked a pound of bacon. I took a couple slices and cut them into 1/2in-1in pieces. Then I put these pieces to the side. I took the rest of the bacon (minus the 2 or 3 pieces that got nibbled up) and crumbled it up and combined it with the egg yolk and ranch dressing. Once the deviled egg mixture was scooped into the egg halves, I decorated them with a piece of bacon I had cut up.

Good, but I thought it was a tad bland with just ranch dressing and bacon, so I added yellow mustard, paprika, and salt and pepper.  Made it a little tangy, which is good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Followed the recipe- we loved it. I like fixing deviled eggs due to the simplicity. Other than the time to fix the bacon, this was a breeze. I decided to make 2 bags of bacon so I could have some for cheeseburgers and breakfast the next day! Great twist on an old, easy favorite. Thanks for sharing!

This was not a hit. Tasted like eggs with Ranch dressing and bacon. Much too bland.  My DH asked "Where's the 'Devil'"?  Deviled eggs should have some 'bite'. 2 stars for ease and it might please someone who thinks deviled eggs are too sharp tasting.

This recipe came out perfect. I used a little more ranch in then the recipe called for, I just added a little more at a time until it tasted the way I wanted it to. My husband is allergic to mustard so the recipe I grew up making was out of the question. I invited many guests and they all loved them. I had no left overs and barely got to snag one for myself before they were gone.

Made this recipe for my whole company staff meeting and they were a hit! Two platters full and they were all gone in an hour. Great recipe one thing I would suggest is putting in a small amount of mayo with the ranch just to keep it balanced.

A big hit at the picnic.  With a little cracked/freshly ground pepper on top, these were rockin' awesome.  Didn't measure ranch, just kept adding until it was the consistency we wanted.

This sounds really good. However I would use turkey bacon (especially the kind Trader Joe's sells - less salty). As a former Weight Watcher I still check the points on every recipe before I make it and your's is a winner. I won't use all my daily points for breakfast. As a matter of fact I will have lots of point left over for lunch, dinner and snacks.

We loved these! What a nice change from the typical deviled eggs. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because we felt it needed a decent amount of spice (for our tastes anyway). We added a bit more ranch, a dash of red pepper flakes, black pepper, garlic salt, ground red pepper and ground mustard. Yummy!

I love this recipe!  I bought the ranch dressing with bacon.  Then sprinkled bacon bits on top. It was a nice change from the miracle whip I normally use!

Perfect for brunch or breakfast. This was a nice alternative to the typical deviled egg. I only gave the recipe 4 stars, because although everyone liked them, they were still a little plain. I may try to add a drop of salsa on top next time.

I'm not a big fan of deviled eggs, but I made this to bring to a dinner. It is easy to make and I love that it just has three ingredients. Everyone ate them up quickly, so most people must have liked them!

If you really like ranch then this is the recipe for you. I like ranch flavor, but maybe this would be better with mustard and relish added to it.

I added a little grated cheddar cheese.  I felt they definitely needed more ranch dressing.  I will make them again with changes .
