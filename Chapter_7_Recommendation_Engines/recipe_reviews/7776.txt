UGH, this was horrible.  Did not even taste like frosting for a cake.  Thankfully, I decided to test it before serving it to my family on Thanksgiving.

This is great when you want to make quick cup cakes for kids, and do not have frosting.  I use it as a base.  Add whip cream and/or butter for creamier texture. I like to add food coloring and fresh fruit (smashed) or fruit juice for variety.  Spinkles are a hit with any kid.

It didn't stay a thick frosting all day and it soked in to my cake. It wasn't over poweringly sweet, which i liked. But it just fizzed out after a while.

This recipe is almost the same as my grandmother's recipe from the depression days.(Note to everyone it is a recipe used in the days when money wasn't plentiful and neither were the ingredients you had to cook with.) We add some sugar and a bit more vanilla.  For those who can appreciate an old recipe from the "good ole' days" I rate this one 5 stars.

I really wanted this one to work for me but it just wouldn't get thicker! I ended up beating it for ten minutes and it just did not work for me, it was extremely liquidy.

This was not a very good recipe for frosting. It made more of a meringue. I'm going to use it to make fluffer-nutters a little later. I wouldn't make it again.

Not what I was expecting. If you want something different and your running low on supplies in the kitchen, this will work. It's more like Marshmallow creme, though and will not stiffen up like in the picture, even after 40 minutes. But I added about 3 heaping kitchen spoon fulls of powdered sugar and about 1/4 cup crushed almonds to it, and it turned out alright. I would make it again, but not as a cake frosting.

Never set up even when adding a third egg white and beating for over ten minutes.  Very bland flavor.  Will not make again.

yes, this IS a recipe for fluff not frosting but it is very good and VERY simple.....i do alot of baking with my 3 yr old daughter and she LOVES it. Plus it makes things alot easier when you dont have 7 or 8 ingredients to measure with my daughter in the kitchen...just keep it clean and simple.....we added melted peanut butter chips to ours and it tasted awesome....i will definately be using this recipe again, but remember, if you are looking for frosting, this recipe is NOT for you

This frosting is AMAZING!!!!! OMA!!! I can't believe how good it is! I made it to put on a cake for my family tonight, and it's a big hit! I put it on while the cake was still kind of warm, and it was perfect. The only thing I did differently, was I added 1/4 tsp. almond flavoring as well as the vanilla. It was great!!!! My mom and sister love it!!! My brothers keep eyeing it so I know it won't last long. I love that it's no-fat too. Thank you for this recipe! :)

The first time I tried this it worked wonderfully, but the second time, I couldn't get it to thicken to save my life! so I put powdered sugar in it until it thickened, and it worked like a charm.

I have to admit after reading a few reviews I was worried about trying this one but since I had plenty of time for redos I went with it & I am so happy I did because it's a new fav. for me! I think the title is getting a few people its more of a "fluff" than a frosting but looking at the photo you can pretty much see that. It's just what I was looking for, not overly sweet & "heavy" I'm usually that person scraping the frosting in the trash but with this I was the one scraping my plate to eat every last bite. I have tried with vanilla & with almond. I plan on trying with different extracts as I need it such as banana & rootbeer for my rootbeer loving husband! Great recipe thanks for sharing! For those who said it was watery & soaked into their cakes I don't know what happened but mine was perfect!

This is the easiest frosting I've ever made. It is tasteless, which is nice since it won't conflict with the taste of the banana cream filling I made. I was pleased by the results.

Very easy recipe to make!  I didn't have butter or shortening and this was a great choice.  I think perhaps people did not beat it long enough of on high enough beater who had lots of trouble.  It does taste like mild marshmallow cream, but it is a great alternative when you can't make regular icing.  I actually like the mild flavor, anyway!  I used a little extra vanilla.  I put it on a chocolate cake and sprinkled pecans on top.  Thank you so much for great, easy recipe!

No, this isn't a "traditional" frosting, and some people will be disappointed, but it depends on your taste.  I've had frosting like this before,and it's a big hit in my family.  It was great for the "Ariel (The mermaid)" b-day cake my daughter requested.  I added blue food dye and the peaks in the frosting looked like waves. Thanks :)

Great simple recipe made from pantry staples!  Very similar to the 7 minute icing made in a double boiler.  Makes plenty for a layer cake.  For a 9 x 13" sheet cake I would half it.

I was so excited to find this recipe since it didn't use confectioner's sugar and I was fresh out.  I was even delighted when my kitchenaid whipped it into beautiful stiff white peaks. and then i tasted it. and it literally tastes like nothing.  I should also explain that this makes more of a "marshmallow fluff" type frosting. Could get away with it on a cake, but probably wouldnt keep shape on a cupcake, and definitely not for a cookie.  I was bummed. :(

This recipe is super easy and tasty. Made far more than I needed for one sheet cake bit hoping the rest will keep for next cake.

Well, I understand why people wouldn't like this. I mean, you're probably not going to frost a cake with this, but when I read "Depression-era" in the description, I wasn't expecting something fluffy. I actually used this to drizzle over some turnovers. I feel like a lot of glazes soak through and this didn't do that. It does taste like marshmallow fluff, but I see so many possibilities with all the different extracts you can buy. I think this recipe could be pretty adaptable!

I tried this recipe to use on my cupcakes, although this frosting did not get thicker as I continued to mix. I mixed for around 10 minutes with my electric mixer, and it still stayed like a liquid. I decided to make use of the "frosting" and I tried using it as a type of glaze and letting it sit in the refrigerator for 10 minutes and they tasted great!

Have made the 7 minute boiled frosting for many years, but never again!!!  This was fantastic!  Definitely a marshmallow frosting, but that's what it is. Those of you who it didn't thicken up for, maybe you got some yolk in with the whites, or the bowl was oily.  I'm guessing.  It went together so easily I LOVE it.

Wish I would've read the reviews!!! The taste is yummy, but it's SOOO runny! I even beat it for 10 minutes AND added powdered sugar to try to thicken it up. I will definitely use it for marshmallow fluff, but it was a fail for my cupcakes!!!

This is a thick, creamy whip. It took me a very long time to whip it so it was think enough, but I liked its texture. I added about a cup of confectioners sugar powder and 1/4 tsp of almond extract and it is very yummy!

This recipie is soooooo DEEEEELICIOUS!!! :) but i do have to say, the consistency is EXTREMELY fluffy, and no matter how long you beat the frosting, it will always be fluffy. It isn't a very stable frosting, if you are relying on it to act as glue, don't, because everything will slip and slide......not good.  But it does deserve thd 3 stars for flavor, easiness and texture!

It was marshmallow fluff.  Did not hold a layer cake together like frosting would.  Tastes ok if you like marshmallows.
