After a fairly disappointing experience recently with another, similar, biscuit recipe, this one was a wonderful reward.  Whereas the previous biscuits were too heavy on the garlic and cheese, these gratefully had neither of those issues.  I did, however, skip the "Italian" seasoning, which I am not a fan of.  In its place I substituted fresh, chopped dill.  These baked up fluffy and plump, nice flavors, none overbearing.

My Mom used to bake biscuits like these when I was a child. Today was gloomy and cold so we cooked up some ham and potato soup and baked these biscuits per recipe but with slightly different seasoning. Fresh rosemary was used in place of the Italian seasoning. The biscuits were fluffy, full of flavor and a delicious compliment to soup. We will be making these again soon!

Not bad but flat tasting and a little greasy.  Made exactly as directed except used 2% milk instead of whole.

Followed the recipe exactly as written and my family and I loved it! I served this with beef stew. :)

I made these exactly as the recipe indicated but with salted butter. They turned out light and delicious! I will definitely make them again.

Loved this recipe! I only changed out a few things, just based on  what I had available. I didn’t have cream of tartar; I used white vinegar instead. I don't drink milk. So, I didn’t have that around; I used soy milk instead. I don’t eat cheese as much these days, so, I just omitted it from the recipe. I also used salted butter, because 1) that’s what I had and 2) I knew the batter would need some sharpness in the absence of cheese. 

Turned out beautifully! The biscuits were light, fluffy, soft inside, buttery, and a bit crispy/flakey (for lack of a more accurate word). I ate the whole batch, minus the few my partner ate. Definitely doing this again!

Extremely simple, very delicious! Didn’t have Italian seasoning, and had to add an extra splash of milk, but that wasn’t the recipe’s fault!

These were okay, but not nearly as good or as easy to make as the Cheddar Biscuits on this site.  Won't be baking these again.

I used salted butter but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. Surprisingly, it was not overly salty.

These were good, I cooked them only 10 minutes and they were perfect. I made them using a tablespoon so the biscuits were small, which I liked.

These were tasty! Might cut back slightly on the Italian seasoning next time though. Served these with home made chicken noodle soup for dinner. Kids gobbled them up.
