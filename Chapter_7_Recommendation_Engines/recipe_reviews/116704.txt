One of the few recipes that you can confidently prepare with no tweaking or changes necessary. It's creamy and delicious with a subtle Parmesan flavor. This would be an appropriate side dish for almost any meat or seafood.  A definite "make again" recipe. Simply perfect.

This is a great recipe, however, it seems there is a typo in the ingredient list....it should read 1/4 tsp. pepper, NOT 1/4 C.

Wow, this is going in my recipe box!  We tried it tonight, and it was awesome.  I added some sauteed shrimp that I had, along with a handful of green peas for color and texture.  DELISH.  This took me under 30 minutes the first time I made it - pretty good for a weeknight!  PLENTY of leftovers for lunch the next day.  The sauce is basically an alfredo sauce.  This is like "grown-up mac & cheese."  It's that creamy and addictive!  Add a nice glass of white wine if you like, a crisp green salad and a loaf of crusty bread with olive oil for dipping... MMMM, instant weeknight gourmet.

I didn't happen to have milk the day I made this, so I used some sour cream. OH MY GOD! It was so creamy, my boyfriend thought it was rissotto.

I'm only rating this one 4 stars because as it's written, the ratio of orzo to the other ingredients is a bit off. It was somewhat drier than I anticipated. However, this has definite potential to be a 5 star recipe, but you have to tweak it to get there! Either cut back on the amount of orzo by at least 1/2 a cup & follow the rest of the instructions.... OR, use the full 2 cups of orzo and you'll have to add more garlic, more butter, more Parmesan and more milk to reach the desired creaminess that you'd expect from this dish. Also, I read another review that suggested adding some spinach to this and I really like that idea. I will try that next time! Just do a little "tweaking" with this one and you will end up with a recipe worthy of all 5 stars!

Great side dish, followed directions but added 1 box thawed chopped spinach and a tad bit more milk and parm since the spinach absorbed what was called for. Family loved it. Next time I may make it an all in one meal by adding shrimp or bay scallops. Thanks for the recipe.

This was almost restaurant quality.  I made some changes to reduce the fat.  Instead of using butter, I sprayed the pan with butter flavored spay and poured some liquid fat-free butter spray into the pan.  The garlic sauteed just fine.  The end result was great.  It wasn't as creamy as I would have liked, but that was due to the butter substitutes.  I don't mind giving up a little creaminess for getting rid of all that fat.

Very good. I added onion, and a bit of cheddar cheese since I didn't have enough Parmesan. Worked well. Easy, fun, and tasty. What else is there to ask for? Thanks.

Wow! This was even better than I expected. Perfect in its blend of flavours and I could taste each one of them. I cooked up the orzo, had the garlic and fresh parsley minced, cubed the butter, and grated the Parmesan in the morning. Doing this ahead I was able to have this dish ready and on the table in under 15 minutes. Using unsalted butter gives the orzo a wonderful silky and creamy texture. It may seem like butter overload  but the cooked orzo is double the size it was when uncooked. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this side.

This is pretty good. I added more cheese because we like cheese but omitted the salt because I thought the cheese would be salty enough. Turns out I was wrong. It  definately needs salt. I bet this would be great with chicken parm.

This was so extra delicious! Halfed the recipe. Sauteed green onion w/ the garlic. Added some romano cheese and fresh basil b/c it was on hand.  Mine was no where near bland...and tasted nothing like alfredo...like I read in past reviews. I can not wait to make this again!

WOW this was delicious!  A great change from the usual side of pasta that will become part of my rotation.  Next time I might add more of either the parsely, pepper, garlic, or parm cheese, because it was a little too bland for my liking as written.  But that aside, AMAZING DISH!

With all the great reviews, I was surpised to find that we found this dish to be too greasy with all that butter. I love butter and use it regularly, but it was just too much for our tastes. The flavour was very nice, but we couldn't quite get over the greasiness of the dish. Probably won't make again.

This was REALLY good.  I did add a bit more milk (maybe 1/2c total or a little less) but everything else I left the same.  It smelled good and it tasted even better.  I'll definitely be making this often!

My kids (age 10 & 12) loved this and both wanted seconds. It's good comfort food and works as a great side item. It's also versatile and can be altered to one's tastes (or what groceries are in the house - mushrooms, fresh basil, sun-dried tomatoes, artichokes all work well - but the kids like it best as posted). Thanks!

This was really delicious with a few tweaks..  I cut the recipe in half, sauteed the orzo in a skillet with 2 tablespoons of butter until it was golden, then added like a cup and half of water, brought to boil, then simmered till it was cooked. I like the flavor and color of sauteed orzo :)   I sauteed the garlic which I upped to 2-3 full tablespoons with about 1/4 cup of minced shallots and then added those, with the parmesan cheese.  I used dried parsley and coconut milk.   This is divine!!  I took one star off because 1/2 of butter would be way too much, and I LOVE butter

I made this and changed the process a bit.  I already had cooked orzo in the freezer, so I used that, thawing it in the microwave.  I then sautéed the garlic in the butter and added it to the orzo, scraping all the butter from the pan into the orzo.  I covered and refrigerated it until it was time for dinner.  I reheated it in the microwave and then added the parmesan cheese, milk and parsley, salt and pepper.  This is a mildly flavored dish that would go with almost anything.  It wasn’t quite as creamy as I thought it would be, so next time I may try upping the milk a bit.  Regardless, this is a great recipe!

Great recipe.  Cooked the Orzo in Chicken broth, and added an extra 1/4 cup of milk.  Didn't have any parsley so I used chives instead to give it that bit of colour.  It was delicious!

Pretty good - but I did inadvertantly make a change.  I wanted to cut this recipe in half.  I only made one cup orzo, but then forgot and made the rest of the recipe as if I had 2 cups orzo.  It was very tasty!  Very garlicky.  I don't think we would have liked it as much if the orzo had been doubled.

Not a bad recipe. It's a lot of butter. I was going to use olive oil but my boyfriend talked me out of it and I wish I hadn't caved. I also used way more garlic which was a good idea. My biggest irk is the Parmesan cheese should not be added until everything is cooked through. When you add it with everything else and stir it together the Parmesan chunks together. Next time I would cook and stir until heated, then sift the Parmesan on top and let it melt.

Based on the previous reviews of this recipe I was looking forward to a tasty pasta side and we were very disappointed.  The recipe was bland even though I used more garlic than called for it was just missing something.  Maybe fresh parmesan would do the trick, maybe more garlic, maybe the green onions others mentioned are what's missing.  This is not a recipe I'll be making again without significant changes.

I wanted a side dish with some flavor but I wanted it subtle.  I didn't want it to steal the show! This delivered. I followed the recipe to the letter, but at the end decided to add a few more fresh herbs.  I especially liked the creaminess the milk (I used cream) and Parmesan provided. I know I'll be coming back to this recipe!

This was delicious, everyone loved it.  The only change I made was that I omitted the parsley (didn't have any) but would use it if I had it.  We usually have whole wheat pasta, and I can't find whole wheat orzo in my local stores so I'll keep looking but once in a while white pasta is ok I guess :)

I made this last night and everyone liked it. The amount of garlic, parmesan and salt was PERFECT. I did not have the fresh parsley so that was left out but I did not miss it. I did have to add in a touch more milk than called for but still a wonderful recipe. So quick, easy and inexpensive. This would go well with many things! I will make this again for sure and maybe even try different cheeses. Thanks!

Definitely need to drop the amount of pasta or increase the amount of sauce.  Other than that, it tasted like the Pasta Roni Parmesan flavored Angel Hair pasta, which I like.  With too little sauce, I like the Pasta Roni better.  I'll have to try it again sometime with a higher sauce to pasta ratio.

This was very easy to make and tasted great! I made it according to the recipe but also added onions to the garlic and then added some frozen corn to the pan before adding the cooked orzo. I think it needed a bit more salt but other than that, great recipe!

If I could rate this a 10****** I would....I just tasted it before serving and OMG!!!  Even my kids were like HECK YEAH that is so good!!  I will for sure make this again.  I used about 1.75 cups of dry pasta and put 3/4 of the cooked stuff into the skillet.  Everything else I did to a T.  FANTASTIC!!!  My Italian hubby said "man why have you not made this before...please make again soon"  Can't argue with the Italian taste buds!! Thanks Stephanie for a great one!!

Came out great but I only used 2 T of butter and it came out great. I can't even imagine how it would be with that much butter, but that much butter just doesn't fit well into my lifestyle.

this was amazing! Didn't alter anything in the sauce, but did add sautéd onions and peppers. Once I added the orzo to the sauce I did add fresh chopped spinach until it wilted. Unbelievable. I made this in a tight pinch budget wise, time wise and for our meatless Monday. I think I'll make this again on a night when I can add shrimP or scalloPs :) delish!

This was sooo good!!  I cut the recipe in half and used a lot of garlic (about 2 tsp. of the jared minced kind).  It tasted like something you'd get at Olive Garden.  A creamy, cheesy, and very garlicky sauce.  Will make many many times.

This recipe was amazing! The only change I made is cutting back on the orzo by 1/2 cup (when I inadvertently dumped about half that down the sink) This was creamy and flavorful. I will be making it again.

Not bad. Both my hubs and I enjoyed this. Although not as creamy or cheesy as I hoped for, this was decent nonetheless. A favorite local Italian restaurant serves the most AWESOME garlic crab pasta. This tastes EXACTLY like that (without the crab, of course!). NOTE: This is VERY rich. For this reason, I don't think I'd ever serve this alongside a heavy entree again. With our chicken parmesan and garlic bread, this was REALLY heavy - and garlicky (and I LOVE garlic!!!). Bottom line. If you are looking for an easy, flavorful side dish, this is it, but is a little overkill when paired with an already heavy meal. Thanks for sharing, Stephanie! :-)

So horribly bad for me, but I couldn't resist making it. It was simple and easy. I think it was too much butter actually and that it would have tasted better and less greasy with about half the amount. Again, not something I'd make often, but would be good for company. Served it with Chicken Breasts Stuffed with Perfection, also from AR.

Meh. I wouldn't make it as written; it's boring. I used about twice as much garlic, 3 times as much cheese and added some crushed red pepper and hot sauce. Better, but still needs more. It is a good base. I may make again with chicken and some bell pepper thrown in. Also, 1/2 cup butter? What??? That's silly.

I melted 1/2 tablespoon of butter in a sauce pan and added the dry orzo and sauteed until lightly browned. I then added 1-3/4 cup chicken broth and simmered until tender, about 15 minutes. I then finished the recipe as directed, omitting the salt and using one clove of garlic for 1/2 recipe. I really thought the garlic was going to be overpowering but once mixed together this recipe was perfect! A definite keeper in our house. A quick, easy and tasty side dish. Doesn't get much better than that for me.

Very tasty!  Since it says to prepare pasta as directed, I actually boiled the pasta in water with one chix bullion cube, as I like adding flavor to pasta without always using just salt.  That's the only thing I did differently.  I will say, I doubt it was necessary.  My husband was delayed getting home so pasta didn't stay as moist once it sat for a bit but I added some milk and it helped bring it's creamy texture back to life.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Oh, I did half the recipe also.  And because curiousity got the best of me, after I tried the pasta, I then sprinkled a little nutmeg on & found it to taste like fettucine, as I thought it would.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Will make again!  I served it with a lemon chicken recipe from this site, but next time I'll try topping the orzo with  grilled chunks of chix breast for a one bowl meal.

Awesome recipe.  I can feed my family spinach and the don't complain!  Took another posters hints and saute a bunch of minced garlic, then add generous amount of sliced mushrooms.  Once mushrooms have gotten happy with the garlic and EVOO, add the spinach.  Incorporate with the orzo and cheese, heaven!

Great taste. I have made before with broth but the milk is better. I cooked the orzo several hours before and than added to the butter and garlic to reheat in a  non - stick pan. Served with pesto cheesy chicken rolls (this site) as another reviewer of the rolls suggested and it was an awesome combination.

So good and easy! I've never been a huge fan of macaroni and cheese, so this will fit the bill. I took another reviewer's suggestion and threw in a handful of fresh spinach, which not only qualified as a serving of vegetables, but also gave the dish a bit of colour (the parsley the recipe calls for would do the same)

This was easy and had a great flavor but it calls for too much butter (I didn't even use the whole amount stated and it was dripping with fat/grease, especially leftover) and way too much garlic.  I'd cut both in half next time and it'd probably get 5 stars from me then.

This super simple recipe is fantastic.  I kicked it up to a main course by sauteing shrimp and finely chopped onion in a bit of butter, then adding the rest of the butter, parmesan and milk along with the orzo.  The sauce was not "creamy" per se but was more than sufficient for the amount of pasta.  The dish has a very rich texture and flavor.

I love this recipe. I thought it was going to be a little plain but it was really flavorful. I made is just as the recipe suggested other than the fresh parsley. I didn't have it and figured it was more for color than flavor anyway. I cut up a fresh tomato from the garden and ate it with that. It is a keeper for sure!!

Halved the recipe pretty much. I browned the orzo in some solidified chicken fat from the top of the chicken stock in the fridge.   Used chicken stock instead of water to cook the orzo in and used ROASTED garlic instead of fresh.   Also replaced the milk with half & half.   My oh my oh my! I'd never cooked with orzo prior to last nights dinner but this dish became a wonderful side for an inch thick grilled t-bone steak.

Excellent!  My test kitchen approved -- they all wanted seconds!  Instead of orzo, I used rice (1.5 cups long grain, 3 cups hot water, 1.5 Tbsp butter and microwave on 70% for 15 minutes) and it turned out wonderfully.  I used it as a side for Chicken Cacciatore.

My husband and I love this recipe.  We have made it over and over again, and don't usually change a thing other than to half the recipe because the full recipe it just too much for the two of us.

I always increase the garlic and parmesan in this recipe per my husband's taste. This is a yummy, reliable side that goes with anything.Sometimes I steam a bag of frozen italian veggies and mix them right in with the orzo, really good!

The Parmesan, butter, and parsley were satisfactory at best.  It could use a richer flavor.  Possibly green onion would do the trick?  It's worth making again to find out whatever is needed.  It's simple and my kids asked for more, always a plus.

I think this is a great base recipe to use, and I'll be using it again and again. We added a package of chopped frozen spinach, and also added at least 1/4 cup of shredded parmesan. It was DELICIOUS. I can't wait to try it again using different vegetables as add-ins. Great recipe!

Others described this as a creamy, aflredo-y dish that was delicious and full of flavor.  With the 1/2c milk, I found the pasta to be dry and almost sticky.  After adding approx. an additional cup of milk, 1 c parm cheese, and extra garlic/ salt, this was still a little bland.  I think I will stay with the routine alfredo for pasta, and make risotto if I want a creamy side dish.

This is a really easy & tasty recipe.  I added a sm. head of fresh chopped broccoli (w/ 2 min. of cooking time left for the pasta).  I also used about 2 less Tablespoons of butter & instead added about ¼ c pasta water.  Per other reviewer’s suggestions, I added a shake or 2 of LA Gold (hot sauce) & a little extra garlic.  I also threw in a large handful of fresh spinach (after draining the pasta), which was a great addition.  Dinner was on the table in about 20 min.

As written, which is how I made it the first time, this orzo is pretty boring, so I gave it a 3.  HOWEVER, made it again last night with a couple twists, and it was a huge hit: once you've softened the garlic in butter, add in the orzo & toast it a bit, then cook it in chicken stock.  Once it's done, add in plenty of fresh parm, and the key, a drizzle of white truffle oil.  Creamy, yummy, almost risotto-like.

Awesome, awesome, awesome! My husband took one bite and said "You can make this any time you want to!" I've made a similar recipe for a couple of years, but it uses quite a lot of butter instead of the milk, and quite frankly, the milk works better. It's rich and creamy and lower in fat. What more can you ask for?

This recipe combines a lot of my favorite ingredients, so I had to give it a try!  I used arborio rice since I didn't have orzo and I omitted the salt because I cooked the rice in chicken broth.  Delicioso!!!  I think I probably added a little more milk to make it creamier.  It was a filling and comforting side dish.

OMGoodness!  This is amazing (and SO simple too!)  Just doubled the sauce for a holiday party (with 2lbs of shells) to accompany meatballs and hot roast beef, yum!  I also made it with soy butter/parm/milk as I am currently nursing my son who has an intolerance to milk protein so this is such an easy and yummy way to still have a gourmet mac and cheese.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Cooked the Orzo in chicken broth versus water and per the package directions. Then followed the recipe as written but held back about 1/2 cup of Orzo based on previous reviews of it being too dry. I never used that 1/2 cup I reserved and indeed found it dry so I added a heaping TBSP. or sour cream and that worked great, certainly made it creamier. Got rave reviews and would have give 5 stars if I did not have to adjust for the dryness.

I made this recipe for 4 servings and it called for 2 tablespoons of pepper. That is way too much pepper for this, the orzo was black and way too hot to eat. I had to throw it all away. I would use a lot less pepper when making this dish, the dish looked great before I added the pepper!

This is in our regular rotation now! Everybody loves it - including my 18 month old. You DO have to serve it right away (so if you're hubby's running late it will still taste okay but not as good as it could) and it doesn't warm up very well but that's pretty normal for these types of side dishes. I still love it and make it at least every other week.

This is great! I made it for Christmas dinner last year, and everyone loved it. I never measure the parmesan cheese, I just dump it in. But then I believe everything is better with cheese, the more the better! Sometimes I don't have fresh parsley, so I use dry. It adds color, but still tastes great if you don't add parsley.

Absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe and it made a perfect side for three people. Also, to reduce pots, after draining the orzo, I used that pot to cook the garlic and butter. I added a little bit more milk as the orzo absorbed it almost immediately.

Simply delicious. No need to change anything. Although, I did cook my orzo in some chicken broth.   :)  Delicious ~

I loved this recipe!  I added 2 or 3 cups chopped mini portabellas.  I felt a little bad about using that much butter so next time i plan on cooking the orzo in veggie broth for added flavor, and using a lot less butter...then i can eat it everday guilt-free!

Simple and delicious!  I browned the orzo along with the onion in the butter.  I subbed chicken broth (homemade) in place of the milk.  I skipped the additional salt. I added some fresh basil and a bit of crushed red pepper.  So good!

Liked this a lot. Added a cube of chicken bullion to the orzo's boiling water. Used more Parm than indicated, but it was the cheap stuff because that's what I had on hand. I'd like to try it with the fancy-pants parmesan next time.

Really good side.

This is a great side dish that is very easy and tasty.  The flavor does not overwhelm the main dish.  We liked it as is, but it would be easy to jazz this up in multiple ways.

So good. Very cheesy and garlicy. I loved it. I don't mince my garlic. I use a garlic press and used 3 cloves. I skipped the parsley since I didn't have any and I didn't miss it.

Good. But too much orzo... a cupto 1.5 cups would have been better. It was pretty dry. Maybe they meant to say 2 cups "cooked" Otherwise very good. Wished I would have read a few more reviews before cooking!

This got mixed reviews.  Hubby is a rice fan, while I prefer pasta.  I thought this would be a good compromise.  Unfortunately, I was the only one who liked this.  Hubby said it tasted too "floury" (is that a word?) My 2 yr. old son and I ate this up....I will definately make again when hubby isn't eating with us.  Thanks for the post.

great side dish, but to cut down on the fat, and keep the flavor, I cooked the orzo in ff chicken stock, and omitted the butter, following the rest of the recipe as written. I would recommend this one....

I cooked the orzo in chicken broth (1 x 14.5oz can per cup of orzo, bring to a boil then cover and simmer for 15-20 mins) and also added sauteed shrimp (which were brined in salt water).  Worked out great as a main dish!

This was quick and easy and very tasty. I sauteed some shrimp and garlic in olive oil and then eyeballed the milk and parm cheese and pepper to taste. It was very good!

I have made this since, many times, as a side dish without the shrimp. It's very good. I often have to add more milk than is called for to make it creamier/smoother.

We enjoyed this dish.  I did not have fresh parm on hand so I used the other stuff.  It was still good, but I'm sure it will be better with freshly grated parm.  Because the flavor is understated, it makes for a great side dish to a more flavorful or spicy protein (like garlic lime chicken) as it does not complete.

This is a simple, very flavorful side dish that would work well with many dishes.  I served it with spinach enchiladas (on this site) and it worked well.  It is easy to taste the garlic and parmesan.  I made the mistake of adding all the topping ingredients to the pan and dumping the orzo on top before stirring.  I had a couple of cheese clumps I could not dissolve.  Still, very yummy.

Very creamy, like risotto without the work.  Good as is, I added some mashed butternut squash for a healthy boost.  Will try again.

I made this tonight and my 10 year old son said, "The chicken was delicious but the pasta was HEAVEN." It was really good.  I used 4 large garlic cloves and my son grated the paremsean and packed it into the measuring cup, so it was likely more than 1/2 cup cheese.  I will cut the butter next time, it was a little greasy.  Still giving it 5 stars, it was great!

Very easy to make and extremely delicious!  Only change I made was to reduce the amount of butter.  I only used about 4 large tablespoons of butter (about half the amount called for by the recipe).  It may have reduced the creaminess of it, but I added a bit more skim milk to make it creamier (and healthier than using butter).  Will definitely make again!

I have made this dish several times now to include at a buffet luncheon at the American Legion, there were no leftovers! If you let the orzo sit too long, it will clump, you simply need to use a little extra arm power to break up the clumps while adding it to the rest of the ingredients, it then keeps well on the table. Thank you for a great recipe. This is a great base for a main dish as well, I added leftover ham and asparagus from Easter, soooo good. Thanks again.

Very good!  I cut down on the butter by a little bit to save calories.  This was very good, I only used a little bit of salt.  Instead of parsley, I used dried basil.  Fast and easy to put together.  I cut the recipe in half and my family polished it off in one sitting!  Now if only I could find whole-wheat orzo.... lol.  We had this with Baked Parmesan Perch from this site. ********  Made again and used 1/4 cupchicken broth, 1/4 cup butter.  Served with fish again, and was great.

I thought this side dish tasted pretty good.  I ran out of Parmesan cheese and used a little mozzarella to make up the difference.  I agree with a previous reviewer who suggested using a little less pasta or a little more sauce.  I ended up using a box of pastina since I didn't have any orzo pasta in the pantry.  It does make A LOT!

This was so simple and very tasty.  I was expecting it to be "creamy" as some of the other reviewers stated, mine however was not and I followed the recipe exactly.  I even used the king of parms....next time I will use cream in place of milk and a bit more than called for.  Oh and I did a couple dashes of nutmeg for additional flavor.  Will definatly make again, thanks!

Outstanding!  Made this for the second time last night to accompany grilled pork chops.  Used 3 cups of orzo and increased the other ingredients proportionately.  Threw in a few handfuls of frozen english peas and it was perfect.  Had to increase the amount because the first time I made it there was absolutely NONE left.  It's only myself, my husband and two young teen girls so to say the least it was a huge hit.

This was really good...and a very nice change of pace.  I was concerned because I didn't have fresh parmesan, but it came out really good with just the kraft in the bottle.  Also I used dried parsely, and it didn't make a significant difference either...thanks for the post!

This was pretty easy to make, but I wasn't really impressed with the result.  The overall flavor was a bit on the bland side, and if I made it again I'd probably use about half the butter called for - it was a little too oily for my tastes.  I made it and served it to two friends, and just one of the three of us really liked it.

Wow I can't believe this dosen't have more reviews. This is so amazing and easy! I paired it with the Key West Chicken and it was a hit with the family. I did decrease the butter and omitted the parsely (didn't have any)and added some sweet onion. This will definitely be one of my new side dishes to serve.

The first time I made this I followed the direction and with one bite I was hooked!  I did brown the orzo in a little olive oil before cooking it.  I just made it again tonight still following the directions but throwing in some sauteed mushrooms, asparagus, scallops and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.  Soooo good!  I do not recommend adding the cheese until the end, when I added it with the rest of the ingredients it kinda melted and clumped together.

Needed to add 1/2 cup of milk instead of 1/4 and added a little more cheese (to flavor). it was good, probably would be good if mixed with shrimp or something (twist on shrimp scampi maybe?) definitely a side dish. maybe a tad too much butter.

This was fabulous.  I doubled the parmesan, just because I like things cheesier.  Other than that, no changes.  I would mention that if, like me, you like to cook the pasta before starting the sauce, I'd advise that you toss the orzo with just a bit of oil.  I didn't and ended up with a colander-shaped mass of orzo.  Still turned out great.  I even reheated it the next day and it was still mmm, mmm.
