My husband and I enjoyed this one--he went back for seconds!  Instead of broccoli and mushrooms I added some red and green peppers, and I also added some additional spices.  I left out the cheddar cheese and substituted more mozzarella instead.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe asks except for one wonderful change. I added a packet of dry Italian salad dressing to the chicken. yumm it was fantastic. I was concerned about the cheddar cheese but I really thought it added a uniqe and wonderful flavor. I am gonna go and eat some left overs for lunch now lets see if its as good the next day :)

I would suggest doubling the amount of pasta and chicken involved, and adding italian seasonings (and maybe some onion/bell peppers if you like spice) while still only using 1 jar of spaghetti sauce. Make these changes for a 5 star experience!

I found this recipe today. IT IS AWESOME!!! I used 6 skinless chicken breast diced and seasoned with salt, pepper and one packet of dry italian salad mix. I placed it in a ziplock back for 2 hours( had to pick up the kiddies). I also used fresh broccoli that i diced and steamed.  I mixed Mozzarella cheese and on top ( because this is what i had) i used  finely shredded fiesta blend cheese. ( monterey jack, cheddar, queso quesadilla and asadero cheese).  OMG!

This was a simple dish that my family really liked.  I made a couple of changes:  I used turkey tenderloin instead of chicken because that's what I had on hand.  I sauteed the turkey in butter which gave it a nice flavor.  I also used alfredo sauce instead of spaghetti sauce which was really good.  The only change I would make in the future would be to use less pasta.  I thought 16 oz. was way too much...half the pasta would have been better.

I doubled the pasta sauce as per other commenters, I also used whole wheat bowties (I didn't have any rigatoni), added some corn and sauteed onions, garlic and celery with the chicken.  I didn't use half mozza/half cheddar, and just used marble.  This was an amazing starting point for a recipe, and my  fiance loved it.  I will be definitely making this again!

Yum.. We liked this a lot.  I didn't chop up the chicken until after it was cooked; I cooked it just about 12 minutes until it was done and it wasn't dry.  The dish needed more spaghetti sauce but I noticed my jar was only 24 oz. and the recipe calls for 26!  I used regular broccoli because it's what I had! Thanks! :)

Good, but I preferred it without the cheddar cheese on top. I substituted more mozarelli.

I gave this 4 stars as written but with a few changes and tweaks to our tastes it's definitely a 5 star dish. Instead of chicken I use coarse chunks of well seasoned and browned chunks of lean ground beef. I add about 1/2 cup of red wine, I never measure, 4 cloves of garlic, smashed and then coarsely chopped. My husband is a real mushroom fan so I put in 5 medium sized button mushrooms very thickly sliced and give them to him. I like the fact that this calls for lots of cheese and pasta because we are real fans of both, I even add about a half cup of grated parmesan into the mozzarella. Not caring much for broccoli rabe I use diced zucchini and spinach. I think what ever your favorite veggies are will work great.

This recipe tasted really good. My kids really liked it. It was really easy and fast to make. I did not have spaghetti sauce with mushrooms in it so I added a 4 oz. can of mushrooms. It was delicious. I also did not have rigatoni so I used the pasta I had on hand and it turned out wonderfully. I will make this again. It was handy to have this as I did not know what I was going to make and I needed a quick supper fast.

This was very bland and the chicken was dry. I did freeze it and then baked it days later so that may have been why the chicken was dry. It needed more flavor but not sure how to give it more.

Super bland even though I added Italian seasoning to the chicken first. The chicken was delicious; everything else was weird. Who wants cheddar on this kind of dish? I should have trusted my instincts and omitted it, but I followed the recipe, and regret it. Not sure we'll even be able to eat this for lunch tomorrow

I modified this recipe - used Alfredo sauce with mushrooms and frozen broccoli, instead of spaghetti sauce and rabe. It was amazing! Will be making again.

Made this but I did it with the homemade spaghetti sauce I make. I just left out the meat in half of it for this recipe. Not only did I make dinner for that night but had enough sauce left over to make a spaghetti dinner with meat for another night since I can freeze the left over sauce. Is a really nice and easy recipe for nights that I really don't want to cook but need to.

I made it vegetarian and it came out great--peppers, asparagus, eggplant, zucchini, tomato, and a blend of Italian cheeses.
