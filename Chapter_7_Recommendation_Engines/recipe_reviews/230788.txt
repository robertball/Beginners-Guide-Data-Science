This recipe deserves more than the low rating it's gotten so far.  It's as bland or spicy, as interesting or basic as you make it.  This is the type recipe that is soooo flexible it's ridiculous!  :D  I sauteed some onion & garlic.  Added about 3-4c leftover chicken, 1 cream of chicken soup, sour cream, 1 can undrained rotel, a cup of cheese, half cup black olives, some green onions ... the dorito part was actually about half doritos & the other half bottomofthebag cheezits, tortilla chips, potato chips.  Oh, I added 1t spicy blackening seasoning.  'Fit in an 8x8 with more cheese then chips on top. Some black or pinto beans & corn would be a good addition.  Jalapenos on top.  'Think you could skip the sour cream in it & just save that per serving.  Tip: Watch the salt - meaning don't add any.  Those chips add enough.  This is quite filling, too.  I'm tempted to say it's "good teenage boy food"!  :)   A few days later: K said I can make it again.  :O  That's as close to a compliment as I usually get - especially for an entree.  Wow.  :D

We found it a little bland. I added hot sauce and it was better. I don't think I'll make it again.

Will definitely make again. The freeloaders requested smaller tomatoes and more cheese. Grownups went for more and saved the remainders from the less adventurous. Heads up, a whole bag of Doritos will give you the 4 cups. Open bag, let air out and go nuts crushing it.

This makes a simple weeknight meal. I made a couple minor tweaks to this recipe. I replaced the chicken with turkey. I browned that with two teaspoons of taco seasoning and added the diced green pepper to it as I browned the turkey. Beyond that, the only change was to replace the tomatoes with two cans of Rotel and I used double the cheese the recipe called for. Would I make it again? ABSOLUTELY.

It was amazing.  The only thing that I think could make it even better is some texture, like rice being added.

Lacking a good flavor, need some spices added to the meat.

Really enjoyed this!! I did add some taco seasoning to the mix just to add some seasoning. Next time I would later the top with Doritoes to get more crunch. So many ways to do this. Anytime my boyfriend has seconds that's a good sign.

Stuck mostly to the recipe. Used both ground beef and grilled chicken. Used regular tortilla chips and sprinkled taco seasoning on them. Delicious. Anyone saying it’s soupy, I’m not sure what recipe you followed but mine had a perfect casserole consistency. Love it!

Really loved this recipe!  I couldn’t find ground pork or ground chicken so I used mild ground Italian sausage and ground turkey.  It came out delicious!  The entire family really loved it!  I especially enjoyed how simple it was to make!  Will definitely make again!

I had significantly fewer ingredients on hand as I didn’t plan to make this meal. I didn’t use sour cream, I didn’t use ground chicken. I used spicy breakfast sausage and taco seasoning, cooked that down with rotel, added in the cream of chicken, and then mixed in the chips and cheese. I only had pepper jack cheese and I used the spicy nacho Doritos. It’s not bad, but not quite the recipe on here. I like that this recipe is so basic, the sky is the limit of how flavorful you want it to be. Use what you have and make it your own!

We personally don't like real spicy foods, so I use the Rotel mild (1/2 can) and blend cheeses into the mix as well as more on top that last few minutes.  We also do this with shredded chicken and no pork.

this was an easy recipe to make and perhaps i didn't put the right spices in it but it wasn't very good. the corn chip flavor really came through and that is not cool for me, couldn't taste the Doritos flavor at all. my husband loved though. will probably try again sometime but not to whoopy about it.

I thought this recipe sounded good and made modifications based on the reviews.  I added chopped onion, used ground beef with the pork and put a layer of cooked white rice underneath the mixture.  It turned out pretty good... different but good.
