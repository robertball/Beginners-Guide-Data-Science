Very good! Of course I tweaked it just a little. Instead of the processed American cheese I used a two cup bag of shredded sharp ceddar cheese; shallots instead of onion; 1/2c mayo & 1/2c sour cream; 2 cloves garlic. I threw the shallot & garlic in with the bacon during the last stages of cooking and then topped the potatoes. I left the olives out but that my personal taste. This really turned out to be a great recipe! Thanks!

I'm not sure why this is in the salad category. This is a good recipe. I would just use sour cream and forget the mayo- much more flavor. Also, skip the olives. One other thing, my potatoes came out undercooked- make sure you are just about there BEFORE you place in casserole as this oven temp does not bake the pieces the rest of the way.

I was inspired by the name of this dish to make a "Baked Potato" salad, rather than a casserole type "baked" potato salad.   I used 1/3 mayonnaise with 2/3 sour cream, bacon cut into one inch pieces and crisped, diced red onion, green onion, salt, and grated marble cheese to make a cold potato salad.  Tasted just like a loaded baked potato.  What a hit it was at my BBQ - especially with the boys!  I am sure to make this again and again!!!

I never was able to make a really good potato salad until this one.My brotherinlaw and I are the cooks in the family so when I bring something over I always want something that is going to be an wow recipe to him and This sure lived up to it. Every time I make it people talk about it. Very important tho. It deff needs to sit all night it taste so much better the next day. It is so easy and so good. every one loved it. Added more sour cream and part of the mayo.The first time we ate it we ate it hot out of the oven. Now I bake it and then refrigerate all day until evening.Or until it is very cold . I take it out and break it all up in a bowl and add more sour cream. Top with extra shedded chedder and mexican mix cheese and some more bacon. serve it cold. Every one loved it and wanted more when it was gone. Makes a really great cold salad. Also Im not sure how it said to do the onions but I chopped them up. quite a few and then carmelize them. The flavor goes thru the salad but no sharp onion pieces in the salad. Kids here that dont like onions love the carmalized flavor of them in the salad tho. Best salad going. Like I said Better the next day. Thank you for this recipe.

I am not really sure what I was expecting, but all I could taste was warm mayo.  Not being a fan of warm mayo, I added some sour cream, that didn't help and I ended up throwing most of this away.  I wish I had read other reviewers suggestions of just adding sour cream and not mayo before I started.  Also, make sure you leave your potatoes in large slices, most of mine fell apart and I boiled them less than the suggested 10 minutes.

It's rare I find a hit with everyone in my family but this recipe made the cut.  I made a few alterations however.  I did not put the american cheese in with the potatoes and mayo, instead I put in about a cup of cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon , I baked it for about 35 minutes and then put a layer of american cheese on top.  I put that in the oven until the cheese melted and then I put on a layer of sour cream, topped with crumbled bacon and sliced green onion tops. I omitted the black olives for my family. The true taste of a baked potatoe in a dish that everyone can easily enjoy.  Everyone had seconds!!!  Thanks for a keeper!!

I made this recipe for 4th of July.  Everyone loved it!  I followed others advice and I added 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  I added a mixture of cheddar and cheddar jack cheese and I omitted the olives.  This kind of reminds you of a twice baked - loaded potato.  Excellent!

This is definitely a recipe I will make again and again.  It is so delicious.  You can trust this recipe if you are making it for the first time and are looking to impress your guests!  I think it's a great "potato" alternative for a barbeque, although it would be delicious as a side for dinner.  (Or throw in some kielbasa sausage and make it the main dish!) Umm!  Note:  do not use imitation cheese.  Only real processed cheese.  If you use the fake stuff you will get an oily nasty mess.  Spend the extra 50 cents and get Kraft or whatever.

I'm confused, this is a potato casserole, not salad. Still, regardless of how this recipe is classified, it was a good sidedish.  I used half mayo, half sour cream.  I stirred halfway through cooking and turned out very tatsy.  Cheesy...but not too much. Thanks Tom!

Wow!  This is great!  I made a double batch for something new to go with our barbeque on the Fourth & everyone ranted & raved.  I did make a few changes...I used 1/2 C non-fat plain yogurt & 1/2 C low fat sour cream in place of 1/2 of the mayo.  I added 1/2 a packet of dry Ranch Dressing mix and some extra garlic powder and cajun seasoning.  I mixed minced green onions in as well as sprinkling some on top with a little extra cheddar cheese (which I used instead of the American processed) My husband thought he'd died & gone to heaven!

This is an excellent recipe!!! I used Velveeta cheese, 1/2C cup of mayo, 1/2C Ranch salad dressing, and 1/2C sour cream, so my potatoes came out extra creamy and delicious.  I will be making this again and again!!!

I found this recipe and decided to use it at our house warming party in Sept.  IT WAS A HIT!!, I got only one little helping and when i went back for more, it was all gone.  There is nothing like walking around at your party hearing your guest rav about your food!  Thank You!

note: try crumling your bacon first before adding it on top then place your blk olives over the bacon.  Crumbling the bacon results in ever person getting the chance to have bacon with every bit

Made this for a potluck dinner for work but instead of baking I mixed everything but the potatoes, added the potatoes, stirred and cooked in a slow cooker (high for 1hr and then low for 3 hrs) - WOW

This turned out great! To give the potatoes more flavor, I added 4 small chicken bouillon cubes in with the boiling water. This gave them a richer, tastier base. I also omitted the mayonnaise completely and substituted light sour cream. I sautéed the onions to tone them down a bit (and it gave them a better texture). I crumbled sharp cheddar cheese into the mixture and topped with the crumbled bacon. The texture was much more like a baked potato than a boiled potato! Delish!
We brought it to a church picnic... they were scraping the bottom of the pan to get the last bite! Not one drop was left!

I needed a side dish to take to a barbeque and this was perfect!  It's just like a potato skin, only in casserole form.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes and light Velveeta cheese.  And instead of mayo, I used 1/4 cup light mayo and 3/4 cup fat-free sour cream.  It was fantastic, thank you!

Actually pretty good. I had to make some modifications. Instead of slicing the potatoes, I diced them and I used mayo and ranch dressing mixture, cause I had no sour cream. I omitted the olives and also had no bacon, so I used crumbled cheese/garlic croutons to give it a nice crisp topping. I also used shredded yellow/colby cheese mixture instead of sliced cheese. My husband loved it, will definitely make again!

I thought it would be different, so I tried it.  I followed the advice of the others and substituted sour cream for the mayo and omitted the olives.  It still really was very watery and not too tasty either.  My family had asked me never to make it again.

Instead of processed cheese, I used a pound of shredded cheese.  Also, I layered it like you would make lasagna.  I made this for a party & everyone loved it.  It went so quick, I almost didn't get to try it.  I made half with bacon & half without, so my vegetarian friends could have some as well.

Wow!  This was so good!  I skiped the olives, used sharp cheddar instead of processed cheese, and added some garlic powder.  I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream like others had suggested.  I also mixed 3/4 of the bacon in with the potatos and sprinkled the remaining on top with some of the cheese.  I served it warm, but will try the leftovers cold for lunch today :) Update: It was fine cold but so much better served warm.  It's more like a potato cheese casserole then salad but still fantastic!

This is awesome!
The key is to make sure everythings coated so use enough mayo - the directions don't have to be precise....you can add a little more or add some sour cream (but it's not a must). I always omit the black olives (just not a big fan)However, I do use chives or chopped green onions. I also put the bacon on the inside not just on top. I sometimes use velveeta and sometimes use shredded....but I always put some shredded on top and brown it. It's just like building a loaded bake potato anyway you like it. A must try! This is one of my favorites!

I rate this 5 stars because it only took 5 ingredients (that counts pepper!) to make such a good side dish. I used amer. cheese and light mayo, and omitted the onions and olives. Potatoes were a bit mushy, only boil them 5 min. Wow..... I think I want seconds.

This was very good. I used scallions instead of regular onion, I used velveeta shredded cheese instead of the cheese slices, and I followed the rest of the recipe to the tee! Everyone liked it. My dad actually made the same one and he added garlic and peppers to it. And everyone actually LOVED that way! But either way it was a success.

I have made this twice so far... everyone loved it!!  I have sent the recipe to so many of my friends =) To make things a little more simple I used precooked bacon.  It tasted great!  In addition I used shredded cheese instead of slices of processed.

This is a good potato side dish (truly nothing like salad but uses similar ingredients), very similar to many other cheesey potato side dishes though.  I cannot believe how much american cheese this calls for though...24 slices if using a 1 pound package.  I used about 1/2 that and it was plenty cheesey.  I used reduced fat mayo and I used reduced fat sour cream, half mayo-half sour cream mixture.  Nice tasting recipe overall though.

I served this at a family cookout last Sunday with steaks.  I used 5 lbs. red bliss potatoes, and decreased the cheese to 8 oz, with another two oz on top.  Thanks to reviewers, I used cheddar, all sour cream, no olives, and a full lb. of bacon.  The bacon in and on top of this casserole makes this superb.  I cut the potatoes into large dices, skin on, and boiled them to near done.  I was delighted that they tasted like the had been baked, not boiled.  It was a tad dry, likely due to less cheese, so I will increase the sour cream the next time so they will be creamier when going into the oven, and there definitely will be a next time.  A wonderful side dish, that upscales your typical  Thanks!

Moooooo - this is so bad for you, but oh so good - Made this for a bunko party - first I used a bigger pan so I increased the potatoes to 12 - used a pound of bacon and I mixed half in with the mixture. I also used 3/4 cup mayo and added a cup of sour cream (used "light" on both). I saved a bit of the cheese (used cheddar) and added it on top with the rest of the bacon and sliced green onions halfway through cooking. And....here is the really bad part....I added about a half of a cup of the bacon grease into the mix. I also used garlic salt. Basically, you can make it any way you want - how can you fail with these ingredients? Thanks!!

This was a five star only after some alterations.  First, I cut the potatoes into chunks, not wedges.  I left out the olives and onion.  Used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 c. sour cream.  Used shredded colby/jack cheese.  Topped with chopped green onion before serving.  Great base recipe, Tom!

This was great. Everyone raved over this.  I used shredded Colby/Jack cheese instead of the American.

A very good recipe.  I think it was a bit dry, though, so I will use another reviewers suggestion next time and add 3/4 cup sour cream & 3/4 cup mayo.

This is a great recipe, tastes wonderful and it's so easy to make. I made this for our company picnic and everyone loved it. I substituted old cheddar cheese for the processed. Really excellent recipe, definately will make it again soon.

This is delicious - as long as you don't use American Cheese!  I use cheddar or the Mexican Blend instead and it is yummy.  I prefer green onions and the half mayo/half sour cream mix.  This is always devoured and enjoyed by all - my bunco group asks for this to be made as part of the snacks served at my house!  I've had to pass this recipe on to many, many people who've tried it.  It was the first item to disappear when I made it as a side dish for a camping potluck - and while I always make plenty....there were a few who couldn't help but whine about there being none left for thirds...

I was shocked at how good this was.  The picture doesn't do it justice.  I just substituted a few things because I didn't have the other ingredients on hand.  I used 1lb hot italian sausage instead of bacon, 2c shredded cheddar cheese, and 1c sour cream that I had just made into ranch dip earlier (using a Hidden Valley Ranch packet) instead of mayo.  My 2 and 3 year olds ate all their food and my husband had thirds!  This is definately something I'll keep in my recipe box.

I admit that I was put off by the idea of baking mayonnaise and potatoes. However, I'm glad I tried it because it is FANTASTIC!! Even my husband who doesn't especially care for spuds thought it was tasty! 3.21.06 I've made this lots of times since I first reviewed it, and now have it just right for our personal taste: skip the olives, add extra-sharp Cheddar cheese, a little more mayo, and also some Ranch dressing. I've made it with bacon bits, and I don't think it's nearly as good. This is always a winner at potlucks and cook-outs. Thanks so much, Tom!

This is a very good party salad. I did not add enough bacon or sour cream. I will next time I make this. Skip the mayo. Use sour cream. I used shredded cheddar cheese. Very good salad.

I have made this 2 times now, and think I perfected it by round 2.  The first time, I did what other reviewers suggested, and did 1 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup mayo.  Most people loved it, but my husband thought it tasted a little bland.  The second time I made it, I received RAVE reviews-  kept everything the same but added 1/2 packet of Garlic and Herb seasoning mix (by Lipton soups.  Threw some canned onion rings on top the last 10 minutes of baking, and voila!  Instant success!!!

I've been making a recipe similailar to this for years. It is delicious! I cook my potatoes with skins on until fork tender and then peel them and cube them, and sometimes I use little red potatoes and quarter them and leave skins on. I omit the olives and use scallions to top.

Loved this recipe for the basic idea and for getting me started... read some of the other reviews and made the following changes:  I cubed my potatoes (this how I personally like potato salad).  After draining and putting potatoes in a bowl I added 1 cup of Miracle Whip (what we use instead of mayo) and then sprinkled 1/2 package of "Hidden Valley Ranch Original" seasoning all over.  Added salt and pepper.  Add some dry minced onion (what I always have on hand) and a couple of handfuls of shredded colby/monterey jack combo cheese.   Mixed all together and put in casserole dish.  Topped with the rest of the shredded cheese and crumbled bacon.  This was DELISH and I will definitely make it again!  So easy and very tasty!

This was really good.  We used more sour cream, less mayo, mixed in green onion and used frozen cubed potatos instead of fresh. I made them ahead of time, we cooked them the next night on a camping trip.

I preferred this hot, but ended up serving it cold due to a malfunctioning oven, and it was a hit cold.  
I used all the ingredients but didn't measure anything. I boiled the potatos for 20 mins, cooked up TONS of bacon, and mixed it with mostly sourcream and a little mayo.  Used lots of cheese too.
Make sure to season with s&p.

Fabulously delicious! I recently tried this recipe for the first time & it was very tasty and fairly easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used light mayo & turkey bacon. Excellent! I will definitely make this again.

Amazing! I love this dish! This is more of a casserole than a traditional potato salad. Perfect side dish for anything from BBQ to steak. Instead of 1 cup mayo I just used 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup sour cream.

This was fantastic!  In the Allrecipes tradition, I made some alterations of my own.  I used vegetarian "bacon" and shredded sharp cheddar cheese in lieu of the American cheese.  Per others' suggestions, I used a combo of light mayonnaise and light sour cream.  I did cook my potatoes with a bouillon cube so I didn't even need any extra salt for flavor.  Also, I didn't have a regular onion on hand so I used green onion.  YUM!

Great crowd pleaser!  Pretty to look at too :)

I left out the olives, used red potatoes (skin on), 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream, green onions, and sharp cheddar cheese.  I cooked the bacon in the microwave to free up my stovetop for other things I was making for my dinner.

I do wonder, though if the step of cooking the potatoes for 10 minutes in boiling water is a necessary step when they're going to bake for an hour in the oven...

The best! Much better than a loaded baked potatoe. I used 3/4 C. Mayo, and 3/4 C. Sour Cream, 1/2 American, and 1/2 Shredded Cheddar Cheese, and cubed the potatoes, cooked covered until the last 15 minutes, uncover and broil on low. Thanks, Terri

Wow!  Made a half recipe, substituted onion powder for chopped onions, used half mayo and half sour cream, and skipped the black olives.  Chilled in the fridge a few hours then ate whole darn thing with the hubby!  Can't wait to serve this on the 4th.

I been using this recipe for 2 summers now and it’s a huge hit. Yes its not quite a salad but its perfect for BBQ's and yummy. What I do is cook the bacon and then sauté the onions in the bacon fat (drain the fat after they are soft.) I use half sour cream and half mayo. I use shredded cheddar cheese.  I always use a little more than whats called for when cheese is added in recipes, I just love cheese.  I use half the bacon to mix in with all the ingredients and then I sprinkle the other half of the bacon and more cheese on top. It just looks nice and its soooo yummy!  leave the olives out its just a personal choice.

Oh my goodness, this stuff is amazing! I have made it SEVERAL times, enough that I'm somewhat known for it now, and pretty much stick to the recipe every time. 

The changes I do make: 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream, the bacon goes in with all ingredients rather than just on top, and I add some Velveeta with the other ingredients and sprinkle Cheddar (or whatever is on hand) on the top. The Velveeta gives it a more cheesy flavor. Also, the onions get cooked with the bacon.  
This is a very unhealthy and delicious recipe! :)

This recipe was perfect for my picnic!  I did change some things though...I was making it for a big picnic so I increased the serving size and I only used 1 c. of Mayonaise and added 1 1/2 c. sour cream, eliminated the olives and used shredded montary and cheddar cheeses instead of american because that was what I had.  I also cooked the bacon but left it out and on the side for the vegetarians at the party.  It came out great and I had so many compliments on this dish.  It truly tasted like a baked potato and was even great heated up the next day!  I will definately make this again.

I used half sour cream half mayo, increased the bacon, used about 2/3 lb of cubed velveta and mixed the olives in but, added chives when it was done. We are waiting for it to cool so we can try it cold. The recipe says 12 servings , but not around here

Very good and flavorful recipe! But ALWAYS use sour cream instead of mayonaise. It turns out alot better. Also omit the olives. Wonderful recipe and thank you!

I made this for Mother's Day cookout.  It was excellent and I got a lot of compliments! I used cheddar instead of american, and added 2 cloves garlic,1 cup sour cream and 3/4 cups mayonnaise.  Very good recipe--thank you!

Excellent, but you really can't go wrong with these ingredients. I used sour cream in place of the mayo and I had no green onions. I will definitely buy them for the next time I make this, which will be soon I'm sure! Yummy!!!

This recipe was great!  I made it for a potluck and it was a huge hit.  I substituted "Classic Melts" cheese instead of American, and I used 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo.  I also sauteed the onions in the bacon grease before baking.  I will definitely make this again!!!

Good potato casserole with some modifications. The processed cheese is just too much with the mayo and the bacon.  I used shredded cheddar.  Much better.  Also, I mixed crumbled bacon into the casserole instead of layering it on top.  I omitted the olives and used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo. Try it--very indulgent!

this was the first allrecipes recipe I tried and it had me hooked! I've tried very low fat versions and the completely sinful ones of this recipe with great results everytime! Being a herb-lover, I add a nice bit of chopped green herbs to the mix which infuse alot of flavor into the potatoes while baking... I don't eat pork and tried different kinds of meat as the topping... this recipe's a really good base to work with.. thanks!

This is just like a big baked potato. Yum. For ease I used precooked bacon and Cheez Whiz, which made it a snap, and then put green onions on the top when it was finished cooking. I took this to Thanksgiving dinner with the inlaws and there was nothing left!

These potato's were great! I was hoping they'd be creamier, but I subbed chedder vrs. her velveeta. (Of course chedder isn't going to be as creamy)I'm sure velveeta would have made it more creamy. None the less,, the taste was fabulous and my husband will not allow me to rate this anything below a 5. (I also added some crumbled blue cheese and used 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream).This goes great with Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style on this site!

There was nothing remotely similar between this recipe and potato salad.  It was dry and disappointing.  I won't make this again.

Outrageous!!  I LOVE potatoes but I was skepitcal about this recipe.  I scaled it to 4 servings so I had some guess work but you can't go wrong with this recipe.  I used red potatoes and the combination of sour cream and mayo suggested by others.  Left olives out.  This can be made ahead.  I prepared it in the a.m. and put it in the oven when I was cooking dinner. Well, I prepared this for 2 of us expecting leftovers - we ate almost the entire dish!!!!  A few hours later I was craving for it and had the rest as a SNACK???!  Will make this real soon.  Thanks submitter!

What a HUGE surprise, i saw so many others reviews and though I was repulsed at the idea of this recipe, I tried it trusting all of you, I was not let down at all. This dish was wonderful.It is very forgiving and perfect for a beginning cook. One thing I will suggest is that it looks pretty, (for company) and a bit more apetizing with a sprinkle of paprika, some dry parsley and a few shakes of permasan. Then it looks as good as it tastes, also, I diced mine, and did not bother with peeling. Thank you!

This was so good. Like a loaded baked potato. My only questions were whether to peel the potatoes (I did not because my kids don't like it) and how much do I stir the ingredients together. I was afraid to mash the potatoes so I gently folded it all together. I don't think you can go wrong with this one. Just don't use a potato that would crumble too much like russets. And slice them about 1/4 to 1/2 inches thick. I used the olives too because I love them.

Absolutely delicious. I took the dish to a pot luck event and there was none left to bring home. I tried it for the first time myself. I used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream, and there was a small amount of tomato bacon dressing in a bottle in my refrigerator that I used up. I saved time by using a bottle of bacon bits- no mess no frying. Will make again, for sure.

I made this for the first time a few nights ago for a potluck. Everyone loved it! I even had a few requests for the reciepe. I did change it up a bit, as did some others. 1/2cup mayo, 1/2cup sour cream, 3/4cup ranch. I used large potato's so I only needed about 5. Very good, even as leftovers the next day!

Yummy!  Very simple to make and very tasty!  I used some of the other variations that seemed to work well.....1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and I also used shredded jack cheese.  This is sure to be a regular in our house, thanks for the recipe Tom!

This was great but a little dry.  We don't like mayo so I substituted 1/2 sour cream and half french onion dip - very tasty, but I needed more than the one cup total.  I'll make it again.

Mmmm. This was yummy. My mom makes a similar casserole by using frozen potatoes (like hashbrowns, or cubed ones). It is delicious.

I didn't have the bacon, and so I left that out of my recipe, but it was still very good.

I had to alter this one a tad bit because I was to darn lazy to go to the store. I used Colby jack shredded cheese instead of american and used bacon bits in place of real bacon. I topped it on there plates with sour cream and chives and the kids loved it. Thanks!!  :)

FABULOUS!
I had a potluck to go to so I made it once the night before to try it out, and I found out that we didn't like the olives it called for. The second time I made it...SUCCESS It was delicous It just needed to be cooked for the whole hour. The people were raving about and it was the first pan to be emptied.

We had this over the Memorial holiday and we thought it was very good.  I left out the olives, but next time I think I will sprinkle green onions over the top before serving so it is more like a baked potato.

Instead of the processed cheese I used about 3 cups of shredded cheese.  Served it with sour cream and salsa for a mexi flare.

I think I botched up the recipe, I think it needed more sour cream and cheese, as I probably put in more potatos than I should  I put in a lot more bacon.  Unfortunately, the potatos came out a little dry, so i listened to one of the reviewers and added more sour cream and cheese and served it cold.  A lot better I thought

Awesome potato salad.  Try substituting sour cream for the mayonnaise as well.

I can never go wrong when I make this.  I cube the potatoes and always use shredded cheddar.  I  skip the olives since I'm the only one who would like them.  Try it with breakfast - goes great with eggs.

OMG!!!!...I made this for the 4th of July and there was none left. Only thing I did differently was, I did a cup of mayo and a cup of sour cream instead of half a cup and I added half cheese slices and half sharp chedder cheese shreds. I also topped it with not only black olives and diced green onions too. It was a huge hit and now everyone is asking for the recipe.

Served this hot and it was gone!  I would change the name to Baked Potato Casserole.  I did make the changes noted in some other reviews.  Used 1 cup sour cream and about 1/2 c of mayo.  Turned out nice and creamy.  Changed american cheese to cheddar.  Sprinkled a little on top with bacon.  (Crisped some microwave bacon and it was fine).  Made it the night before and popped it in the oven an hour before lunch.  Big hit!

tasted good, but a little too greasy, definitely more of a potato and cheese casserole rather than a salad.

This is the 2nd time I've made this recipe and everyone loves it. I used 1 cup of sour cream and about 1/4 cup of mayo. I used shredded cheddar cheese and added extra on top. I omitted the olives. It tastes even better the next day when it's reheated. Also, I wasn't sure the 1st time I made it if you're supposed to leave the skin on the the potatoes. I did just to save time and it turned out great.

Pretty good.  A little too greasy for my sensitive tummy, but we both liked it.  I used dried minced onion and tossed in some parsley and Old Bay seasoning.  I halved the recipe and used some potatoes that I had baked in the oven with the skins on.  I didn't bake the full amount of time since my potatoes were already very done and I just wanted to warm the dish and melt the cheese.  45 minutes was perfect for that.  I did use mayo, but I just eyeballed it and I didn't notice the mayo taste (I'm not a big fan).  Great use for already baked potatoes--thanks for the recipe!

Huge hit at a BBQ last weekend!  I used nine small red potatoes boiled until I could stick a fork in them.  Left skins on, sliced after boiling.  I used turkey bacon (12 oz package), shredded sharp cheddar cheese (~3 c), and 1 c of sour cream.  I mixed it in a large bowl and left it that way!  It was delicious as a cold salad.  Will DEF make again :)

love love love it! I did the recipe for 12 servings and used a whole package (24 slices)of american cheese and added extra bacon.  I also used some ranch dip I had on hand and then added enough mayo to make a cup.  Since everything in it is cooked, you don't have to stick it in the oven for an hour, but it's sooooo much better if you do!  I didn't add the black olives on top, and next time I might sprinkle some dried onion rings or cut up some red bell pepper to dress up the top, just my personal taste. *Update* made this again, this time using what I had on hand, some purple onion, mayo and ranch dressing, and chedder instead of american, and bacon bits.  i double the recipe and we ate half of it unbaked like reg potato salad the first night, and then I put the rest in a baking dish, sprinkled some fried onions on top (just the last 10 minutes) and baked for an hour for the next nights supper.  I LOVE the idea of this!  I'm now going to try baking other potato salad recipes i have, and I'm thinking of trying this "2fer" on macaroni salad too!

I took this to a 4th of July potluck and it was the first thing gone. Everyone was talking about it! Like other reviewers suggested, I left out the olives and replaced with green onions. I also used about 3 cups of casserole cheese, 2 cups of sour cream and a 1/2 cup of mayo. Since some reviewers thought it was a bit bland, I added a few dashes of garlic salt as well. I mixed everything together and topped with another 1/2 cup of cheese and more crumbled bacon. I only had time to bake for about 40 minutes but it was definitely done. I will definitely be making this again and again! Thanks!

I love this recipe. I make every year for a family reunion. It is always one of the first things to go. I cook the onions in some bacon juice to make them a bit softer. I also use cheddar cheese instead of american. I use a half cup of mayo and a half cup of sour cream for better taste and I omit the olives.

I thought this was good, but kind of bland. The five stars is because my boyfriend LOVED it. Out of personal preferences, I chose to omit the onions and add a clove of garlic, chopped. I also used sour cream instead and just a dollop of mayo for some zing. I did mix the bacon in with everything instead of just topping with it. The dish did go well with our hamburgers, but I think it needs something...

I followed the recipe exactly. Except for the olives, they just seemed out of place.  This turned out VERY good.  However, I think it can be improved, next time I will add some more potatoes and maybe not cook it as long.  It was still very good though.

I really wanted to like this - mine was dry and potatoes did not cook all the way.

I liked it better before I baked it - it was nice and creamy, after cooking my cheese separated - and though I cooked my potatoes until they were just about done, it didn't seem as though they cooked further.  I didn't want them mushy, and thought they'd cook a bit further when baked.  They didn't.

I may try this again, but it definitely needs modifications and I wonder if the ingredient quantities are accurate.  I used fewer potatoes and had to add more mayo/sour cream & cheese just to adequately coat six sliced, boiled potatoes.

I felt it was more like a scalloped potato dish.

This is a delicious salad/cheesy casserole! :=) My family LOVED it! Hubby couldn’t get enough of it! He took it for lunch the next day & ate it again for dinner. He told me to make sure I saved it to make it again. My daughter loved the cheesy & crunchy bacon! I added the entire small can of olives. Since we love olives and it was FANTASTIC!  IT goes great with Chicken Marinara & BBQ Chicken. I WILL be making this again & again, especially this Winter (Hellooooo “Comfort Foods…LOL) Thanks for this, it was AWESOME!

We thought this was good, but it could have been better. I considered it to be like a twice baked potato casserole, so next time I would probably use all sour cream instead of mayo to give it that twice-baked potato flavor. Also, I used a cheese blend instead of the american cheese, so more sour cream was necessary since the cheese blend didn't melt as much and made it a little dry. But, the idea is great, and we'll be making this again.

This was really good. I am not big on too much mayo so per others suggestion I used sour cream and mayo. I used more sour cream than mayo. I think next time I will saute the onions before I put the caserole together. this was really good change from the norm

What a great dish. A unique twist on potato salad. Like others, I used half sour cream and half mayo. I also used shredded cheddar rather than American. So glad I did!

I wouldn't call this "Baked Potato Salad", but rather baked potato casserole. It is really yummy! I followed the directions exactly, but when I served myself, I topped a scoop of the casserole with a dollop of sour cream. I just felt it needed that extra creaminess. This is a great alternative to loaded baked potatoes, and would be great served alongside roasted chicken or grilled steak. I halved the recipe (I only cook for two) and it fit nicely in an 11 x 7 x 1.5 glass baking dish. I could take or leave the olives... next time I think I'll top the casserole with green onions instead. I really liked this recipe and I'm sure I'll make it again.

This dish was so simple to make.  I made a very large amount of it as a last minute side dish for a party I hosted.  I was afraid but chose this recipe because of the ratings.  All my guests LOVED it!  Everyone asked me where I got the recipe and that they've never had a potato dish like this before.  I will definately make it again.

Such an easy recipe and so yummy. Everyone at the picnic loved it! Next time I make it I would like to add the sourcream as many others have, I think that would enhance the flavor even more...

Family enjoyed this dish. Omitted the olives due to personal preference. Used maple bacon because I think the maple flavor goes better with potato soups/dishes.

This recipe is great.  I have made it several times -- once with the bacon and green onions and once with yellow onions.  Everyone love it.  I have never put the black olives in the recipe.  Also, I always add a touch of dry onion soup for flavor.  I would call this potatoes au gratin.

GREAT!!!  I took this to a BBQ/swim party, everyone loved it. I ended up putting twelve potatoes in it to make a full 9x13 pan.  I also used velveeta light and light mircle whip.  Very good, will make again!!!!!!!

This was pretty darn good!  I put in diced ham and left the bacon out.  We had this as our main dish.  I also used diced mild cheddar cheese instead of American.  It turned out great!

This recipe was quite tasty, but I wish I could have made it a little healthier.  I used red potatoes, and I also added shredded cheese on top.  I used 1/2 c. Miracle whip and 1/2 c. Ranch dressing and it had very good flavor.  I also used chives instead of normal onions.

This is FABULOUS.  My only substitutions: I used mild cheddar instead of American cheese, scallions instead of a regular onion, and added some sour cream.  It was a hit with the neighbors!

ONE QUESTTION I'M HOPING ANOTHER REVIEWER CAN ANSWER: DO YOU PEEL THE POTATOES OR NOT? I peeled but not sure if better not too. Has anyone tried it with red, unpeeled? Anyways, everyone loved it. I followed other reviewer's advice and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and I also used shredded cheddar instead of american processed.

This was delicious.  More like scalloped potatoes than a salad but a great side dish.  I added 3/4c. ranch dressing as others had suggested and I think it really made the difference in flavor.  My 10yr.old daughter made sure I was keeping this recipe! It's a keeper.

I made this for Easter dinner.  I liked it, but I think it is missing something.  I used half mayo and half sour cream with chives and cut out the olives.  I also used 1 lb of shredded cheddar cheese.  I will make this again and try to figure out what else it needs.

This recipe has very good flavor, but I found it to be a little dry.  I made it with sour cream instead of the mayo, as per a suggestion by another review. I will try mayo next time.

This was a huge hit at our 4th of July party.  I eliminated the olives and added sprinkled garlic chives on the top.  I also used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayonnaise and used real bacon pieces instead of cooking bacon...tasted delicious!  Everyone loved it and now I need to bring it to someone's party this weekend!

I took this to a church putluck dinner and it was gone before the end of the line!!  I think I will cube my potatoes nexx time as it will be easier to stir.  I also added 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo.  I might try adding some Bacon Ranch Dressing the next time as well.  I left the olives off the top.  Definitely a favorite in my books!!!!

Yum! Yum! Yum!  We had this for dinner last night, I left the skins on, since I usually like my baked potatoes with skins.  I also left out the olives since baked potatoes and olives don't mix well to my tate buds.  Thanks!

A friend of mine had gotten a similar salad from the deli and we loved it. After finding this recipe, I had to try it and it was delicious. I used cheddar cheese instead of American and left out the olives. I also left the skins on the potatoes to add to that baked potato feel.

After making the recipe, I tried it out on my wife (who is not a potato eater) and she exclaimed: "How creamy!" (Like her mac & cheese!!)
I used only 2 slices of bacon and left off the olives (didn't have any) and as 'creamy' as it was I only used a quarter pound of American cheese. A touch of oregano. Did not peel the potatoes.
As you can guess, I really enjoyed this combo however you categorize it.

This was SO good! It got rave reviews from everyone at our party. My son said forget regular potato salad. I made a double batch with bacon and one without, and it was delicious both ways. I cubed 15 lbs of russet potatoes and roughly tripled all the ingredients. Fried the bacon, sauted 2/3 of 6 chopped onions (we like onions) in bacon grease for the big batch and the rest of the onion in butter for the smaller pan. As other reviewers suggested, I used half mayo and half sour cream. I added 2 c cheddar cheese to the big batch and 1 c for the smaller one and it was plenty for our tastes. I just seasoned with salt and pepper and sprinkled the tops with paprika, although I think you can be very creative with spices in this dish since it is a very good base recipe. I made them the day before the party, so refrigerated until baking them at 325 only long enough to heat through because we were short of time and oven space. It's such a simple combo of ingredients but oh so yummy!

I loved, loved, loved...maybe more than baked potatoes.  Next time, I think I'll sporadically place chunks of butter around and maybe mix in some extra bacon inside.  I will also probably use the exact mayo amount as I used half and didn't feel it overpowered at all.  Lastly, once I plate..I just may put some sour cream on mine!!!  Loved!

These were very tasty potatoes. I added garlic powder with the s&p. In the picture it looks really creamy and saucy, but mine did not come out like that. The olives were kind of out of place but not bad tasting.

I gave this a 4 star as I made several modifications.  First off, 10 minutes was too long to precook the potatoes-they were way to soft.  Next time I'll do 7-8 minutes.It didn't change the taste but the texture was mushy.  I took the advise of others and did a 1/2cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream and substituted 8oz.shredded sharp cheddar for the processed cheese.  I also added about 1/2 cup green peppers and 2 cloves of garlic. It has a nice baked potato flavor and the bacon and black olives add a nice visual touch as well as flavor.All in all a great start to a potato side dish as I get tired of my basic cheesy potato recipe although it is much easier.

I wasn't sure what to expect with this recipe b/c either people loved or hated it in the reviews.  I'm so glad I tried it b/c it was amazing!  I fixed this for Easter and EVERYBODY loved it.  I did do as other suggested and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  I will be making this from now on.  Many, many stars.....

I really don't like giving bad reviews but neither me or my husband could eat this. When I make potato salad i like to mix it warm so i thought i might like this but the flavor of hot mayo out of the oven is not good.

Made this in my crock pot and it turned out great!  Used red potatoes, quartered and covered in water for about 6 hours on low, drained and stirred in other ingredients when I got home and let it go on high while I finished the rest of dinner!  How easy and delicious!!!  Had people over for dinner that night, and they raved over it.  Used the 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream suggestion and green onions.  WOW!

oh yes! i followed the suggestions from others about just using sour cream instead of the mayo. it was missing something, so i added a couple tablespoons of miracle whip. PERFECT! my husband loved it, i loved it, even my picky 13 year old daughter was impressed! just delish. oh, i didn't bother boiling the potatoes first. i peeled them and microwaved them 5 minutes, flip and 5 more minutes. then cut them up and mixed them in with pre-made real bacon pieces from a bag. made prep time super short. also, cut up 3 or 4 chives from my herb garden. great addition! thanks for the recipe!

I used red potatoes with the skin left on, shredded cheddar, and sour cream in place of the mayo.  I omitted the olives and used green onion and I thought it was pretty good.  I think next time I may add a small amount of mayo to give it a little zip.  I mixed everything together, including the bacon, while the potatoes were hot so the cheese melted.  Over all it tasted a lot like a twice baked potato.  By the way, I didn't even bake it as I didn't have time and it tasted fine.  I had leftovers so I'll probably throw it in the oven tomorrow and see how that goes.

A great recipe, however I did make a few modifications based on other reviews, and substituted green onions, cheddar cheese, and used 1/2c sour cream and 1/2c mayo.  I over-boiled my potatoes though(or maybe I sliced them too thin) and they all fell apart, so rather than stir all the ingredients together, I combined all the wet ingredients, then layered half the broken potatoes in the pan and covered with half the cheese mixture, then did a second layer of potatoes and cheese mixture.  The only thing I would change next time is double the sour cream and mayo (maybe because I used grated cheddar cheese, my mixture came out drier.  I added an extra dollop of each but it was still not quite enough).  The next morning I took some of the leftovers and fried them in oil and had some nice crispy, cheesy hash browns!  This is a wonderful and simple recipe.  I will definitely make this again.  Much less difficult than potatoes au gratin and just as good!

What a wonderful side dish! Mu guests and I enjoyed it very much and this recipe is now in my collection; I did follow the advice of some other members that said to mix mayo and sour cream. This was a cheesy delight that will again be presented on my table!

Pretty good. I took another commenter's advise and substituted sharp cheddar for american and added garlic.  I also replaced the mayonnaise with plain low fat yogurt and added steamed but firm broccoli.  The two pounds of bacon seemed like allot so we cut that in half and it turned out really good.  This recipe makes allot though, it almost didn't fit in my 2 quart baking dish and it made tons of servings.  I would probably half this recipe in the future to make it more manageable and so there won't be so many left-overs.

Really simple and easy recipe!  My husband immediately said "Mmmmmm, this is good!"  I substituted the American cheese for a mixture of grated cheddar and mozzarella, and did without the olives, since I didn't have any on hand.  The chopped onions were still a bit crunchy, so next time I will either try to saute the onions first or try green onions for color.  I also would suggest mixing the bacon with the whole mixture instead of sprinkling on top so that you get the full infusion of the yummy bacon flavor.

OMG! This was sooooo good! I deleted the olives. Used green onion, and changed the mayonaise to sour cream. It was wonderful!!! Everyone asked for the recipe! This will be a regular recipe in my house!

As written, made with only mayo, I don't think I could have even given this a 2*, but I'm not a fan of warm mayo.  Using 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream was perfect for my family, even good as left overs!  Thanks, this is a keeper!

I made this while I was visiting family and everyone was very impressed!!!  I had to give up my source and hand out the recipe - and it's so simple.  I loved the suggestions of using 1/2 sour cream, saving some of the bacon to sprinkle on top, and using chives on top for color.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of american because I prefer the flavor and I sprinkled some of that on top as well.  Enjoy!  Can't go wrong with this one!!!

This was a great potato-cheese casserole. I changed the servings to 3, only using two potatoes. After cooking the bacon, I added the chopped onions to the bacon fat and sauteed them; afterwards draining well on a paper towel. I used half mayonnaise and half sour cream, only needing about 1 Tablespoon of each for this smaller portion. I did not use olives, but cut some fresh chives and added them to the top of the dish before cooking. It only took about 20 minutes at 350 degrees to become light brown and bubbly; the taste was wonderful and it was plenty for two or three people.

This turned out very good. I cheated by precooking the potatos in the microwave.
I used half mayo and half sour cream.
My husband loved it. 4 stars.

Pretty darn good.  I used mostly sour cream and a bit of mayo, cheddar cheese, and no olives.  I also topped with scallions.  It was a big hit at the party.

Not like a baked potato and not like potato salad. Although it had a "just ok" flavor it was very bland.

This was soooo great! It definately reminded me of twice baked potatoes. I added some garlic powder and instead of onions, I sauteed some shallots in butter, then added them. For cheese, I used Kraft's Four Cheese Classic Melts (mostly because my family loves cheddar - and it is a combo of cheddar and american).  It was a big hit!! I will DEFINATELY make this one again.

Heeded others' advice and used half sour-cream/half-mayo.  Also, I only had bacon pieces (bagged kind) so I used those. Used shredded cheddar.  Threw in some scallions for good measure...delicious!

Delicious! I didn't realize I had forgotten a few things at the store so I had to make a few modifications. I omitted the bacon, forgot to buy an onion, and used a full  8oz package of shredded sharp cheddar, plus an additional cup of mexican shredded cheese. Since I was missing the onion in addition to the salt and pepper I used seasoned salt. For a little extra creaminess I added 4oz cream cheese. 
I mixed up all the ingredients before adding the potatoes and after it was all cooked up I topped each individual serving with sour cream-ranch dip.

I liked this because it wasn't the same ol' potato salad.  I took it to a luncheon and people were asking for the recipe the next day, so it was a hit!  I think it could use a little something though, to jazz it up.

I cubed the potatoes and cooked them in salted water until soft (to reduce baking time). I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup miracle whip. I ommited the olives but added green onions and also used shredded cheddar/colby.

This is awesome! We made it for Christmas and no leftovers.  It was requested for Easter and the same, no leftovers, it is creamy, but chunky, with the cheese and mayo, then the bacon and olives on top, this is a huge hit and it will be made again!

This turned out great, much better than I expected. I was in the mood for potatoes but not the same old baked potatoes so I tried this. I did change a couple things; left out the olives, actually forgot the bacon lol, and added lots of garlic and onion, and used half mayo/half ranch dressing. Awesome recipe though, definatly try it! Would also be good using cream of chicken soup or sour cream instead of the mayo mixture.

This is soooo good. I did 1/2 cup of Mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream and extra bacon. I used velveta for the cheese. I have used sharp shredded cheese but I did not care for that, so I went back to the milder cheese. My husband will eat two servings of this!

This dish was delicious.  I made it without the bacon because we are trying to reduce our intake of red meat. I used shredded cheddar cheese. It was just great.  I will make it again and again.  Thanks so much Tom.

I used half mayo and half ranch dressing like some of the other reviews suggested.  I also omitted the olives and used velveeta.  It was pretty good, but it was a little dry.  Next time, I'm going to peel and cube the potatoes, use more mayo and use a different cheese.  The velveeta was clumpy.

This was excellent.  My husband said we need to have it with every meal.  I did make a few changes, I didn't add the olives, instead of 1 cup of mayo I did half cup mayo, half cup sour cream, and I added green onions instead of traditional onions as I thought that would be more appropriate for a baked potato.  It was Yummy, will definitely stay in my cook book, and make many more appearances at our dinner table.

Brought this to a 4th of July picnic and everyone loved it.  I used a 1/2 c. sour cream and 1/2 c. mayo instead of all mayo.  Also used shredded cheddar cheese instead of American.  Yummy!

Pretty good. The only thing was it seemed the mayo clumped up when it cooked. But they were tasty. Even better the next day!

This was an absolutly hassle free side dish that tasted delicious to boot!!! I added the bacon bits you can get in the salad dressing isle of you grocer. I thought the mayo might be too much, but it had an awesome taste! Thanks so much!

Very good -I added some fresh chopped chives from the garden as a topper. Goes nicely with burgers or barbecue. Next time will try the sour cream suggestions for a little less dryness.

Overall the recipe was quite good, but not so delicious that I'll make too often.  It takes more time to prepare for a side dish than I prefer, so I would only make it for special occassions.

This is one of the best and easiest potatoe receipes I have found.  I omitted the olives and used cheddar cheese and extra onions.  I also used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  I cooked my potatoes too long in the water, they went to mush, but it was great anyway.  My family loved it and it is great leftover too.

This recipe is wonderful! I substituted cheddar cheese for the american cheese and the whole family loved this. I'm not real big on olives but I chopped them up real small and they added a very subtle flavor that was wonderful.

Everybody loved it!  I am not a big fan of american cheese so I changed it to add 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar cheese.  It was a VERY big hit.

I enjoyed this dish as did my guests.  The only part of the reciped I didn't care for was that it did not specify the type of potatoes to use and if they should be peeled or not.

Overall this is a quite tasty recipe and I would use it again!

This is really good, BUT...I cooked the onions first, used cheddar cheese, and didn't bake the olives.  Served them on the side with sour cream and chives, instead.  The recipe just got invited to another party...   :)

I did this a week ago and it went down well. I did it again today with the addition of cauliflower florets and left out the olives. I also prefer greek yoghurt and a little mayonnaise to just mayo and added a little paprika and cooked chicken. It's a great base recipe to vary depending on what you have available. I used Lancashire cheese today which is my fave cheese.

Loved this recipe. Had a jar of diced variety of olives in seasoned olive oil, so used about 1/2 cup of these instead of prescribed olives in recipe. A new family favorite. Easy, semi quick and very tasty. You won’t be disappointed.

Made it for a pot luck and it was gone pretty fast. I love black olives but I did omit them because so many people do not. I also used regular shredded cheddar as my cheese.

My wife loves it. The only change I made is I left out the olives and sprinkled some garlic powder and used sharp cheddar cheese, about 2 cups .  I've made it at least three times and plan on making again.   This is definitely a keeper.  Thank for submitting .

I loved this recipe! More importantly, my boys loved it. Used sour cream instead of mayo, and cheddar cheese instead of American. I make it about once a week!

Either the football crowd was really hungry or the recipe was as good as the comments I heard from them.  Instead of using fresh potatoes, I used left-over baked potatoes, sliced them, and then mixed them with the other ingredients including chopped green peppers which replaced the black olives.

Really easy and good.  I made a few changes though.  I used half mayo and half yogurt.  Also I used bacon bits and put them in with the potatoes and cheese instead of on top.

This was a hit! I didn't have alot of mayo, so I did half mayo and half sour cream. For the cheese, I shredded cheddar and pepperjack. It turned out great. My husband ate way too much! I omitted the olives since I didn't have any and added fresh scallions. Will be making again. I am all for salt and pepper, but this was great and really didn't need anything else. Perfectly delicious.

This is great.  I skipped the bacon, olives and onion. I used Mexican cheese blend because it's what I had, and subbed non fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream to cut back on fat and cholesterol.  Still came out delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

Meh. While this was OK, I'm not jumping out of my seat to make this again anytime soon. The concept is intriguing and what attracted me to this recipe to begin with, but the execution fell short. I love twice baked potatoes AND potato salad. The idea of having both in one dish seemed to be the best of both worlds. To my disappointment, this was bland, a tad dry and not at all what I was expecting. For one, unless your potatoes are raw, it's virtually impossible to mix them with the other ingredients. I consider myself a very knowledgeable cook and even before making this, I KNEW cooking the potatoes would be problematic. If you slice your potatoes thinly, they will cook thru in an hour. I suggest skipping the boiling step altogether. My casserole ended up resembling loaded (lumpy) mashed potatoes, but I was OK with that (again, it was what I expected and didn't affect the taste in the least). That aside, I pretty much stayed true to recipe with the only change being a simple substitution of chopped scallions for olives (they seemed out of place and I HATE them). :) All in all, this was interesting and seemed to go over well with my hubs and parents. It's just didn't cut it for me. Thanks anyways, Tom. :-)

I make this all the time when my fiancé is having a "guy's night"... they gobble it up! I use chicken bacon instead of regular bacon and cut it up before cooking it down a bit. Turns out delicious every time!

Yummy! I made this with turkey bacon (since I don't eat pork) and added just a bit more onion and it was so good! Like eating potato skins.

YUMMY!!  I did make a few slight changes based on what other reviewers had tried.  I used half mayo and half sour cream and left out the olives cause it just didn't seem to fit with the recipe.  I only had small red potatoes on hand so I boiled those whole with skin on and then smashed into large chunks before adding to the other ingredients.  Since I boiled the potatoes until they were soft, I was able to cut back on the amount of cooking time to 30 minutes which allowed all the ingredients to melt and heat through.  I don't think I will add any salt next time because the bacon added enough salt.  This recipe is definitely a new favorite way to make potatoes.  I am also anxious to try it as a traditional cold salad as some have suggested.

My whole family LOVE this recipe. The only things I do different is I use 16oz of sour cream and no mayo, mix all the bacon in before putting in oven, and half way through cooking I semi-mash up the mixture  and sprinkle more cheese on top.

Recipe was very good.  I made it for a crowd to accompany steaks. I was planning to grill dinner so it was alot easier than preparing baked potatoes for everyone. I followed the advice of others and used the sourcream/mayo combo and I used cheddar cheese and I used fresh scallions.  I prepared the recipe early in the day and cooked the potatoes till they were 90% done.  Then I placed everything in a disposable foil tray, so when it was time to grill, I just placed the pan on the grill for about 35 minutes. It was easy and delicious.

I was not enthralled with this recipe.  My guests did really like it but I thought it was OK. It really needed something to amke it special.  Possibly a more robust cheese would help.  I have had a dish very similar to this that was fantastic and thought this was the same recipe but obviously not.

We decided not to use mayo. I can't imagine it even tasting that well. Mayo is more of a cold food thing. Also we left the Olives out. However we did ad some potatoes from the scalloped potatoes we'd had a few nights back. Taste wonderful.

This recipe is just okay.  I was expecting more of a potato salad, but I would definitely put this in the casserole category.  I used sour cream instead of mayo and omitted the olives.  It was very thick and clumpy.  For the record, it is NOT good eaten cold--it just tastes like cold mashed potatoes when it cools.  Most of my guests enjoyed it, though.

I made this dish the other night as i had bag of red potatoes that had to be used up, i changed the recipe somewhat following other reviews. I used half cup mayo, and 1/2 cup sour cream. also i hate american cheese so i used mozzarella in its place. it really was not all that flavorful, probably wont make again.

Just plain delicious!  A great side dish for a BBQ or any meal that you want a scrumptious potato side.  I use half mayo/light sour cream, cheddar and green onions.  I recently made it for a camping potluck...we got to the table a bit late and everyone had served and seated.  But once one person got up to get some of the dish....they all jumped up to get a serving and raved about it - the dish was scraped clean!  This has become a special request side dish with our bunch!

Next time I'll just make a loaded baked potato. 

This was way too bland tasting and the mayo thing just didn't work for me. 

Won't make this again.

I made this last night with the Baked Pork Chops I from this sight. It was Very good! I used the recipe as directed but next time I will double the bacon, and put 1/2 of the bacon into the mixture. The bacon gives it a nick kick. Anyway it is a keeper! Thanks!

Delicious!  I sauted the onion before adding to the casserole, substituted sharp shredded cheddar and I mixed the mayo and sour cream as many reviewers suggested.

I love this recipe.  I use 3/4 cup mayo and 3/4 cup sour cream.  Tastes like a twice baked potato.  I also use more bacon - cuz that's how my family likes it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

How can a potato salad be delicous warm and cold!! Either way with this recipe you cant go wrong. I would use half the amount of mayo and use sour cream instead next time seeing it is a real heavy salad with the mayo. Maybe even just sour cream instead of the mayo. But a definate hit!!

I used 1/2 mayo & 1/2 sour cream and had to double the amount in the recipe for that amount of potatoes.  I felt it was too dry. My boys won't eat potato salad and this was a good alternative.  Served it hot tonight so I don't know how it tastes cold but I can't imagine it NOT tasting good cold because it sure was delicious hot! Thanks for the submission!

Every time I make this recipe, there is never a time when someone doesn't want the recipe or says how wonderful it is. Omit the shallots and just cut up finley a green onion. 1/2 sour cream is a good idea. Also, this is not a "salad" its more like twice baked potatoes. Yummy!!!!

So yummy.  I ended up sort of layering the potatoes with the cheese ala lasagna style.

I was looking for a potatoe salad to make on the fourth of July that my kids would like as well as the adults. This hit the spot & everyone enjoyed. Thanks!

Wonderful side dish!  I added sour cream as others suggested, and I think it made it just right!  Might have been too dry without it.  Enjoy this one.

I think that this recipe is good for people who like greasy food, it just wasnt for me.  I wasnt big on the american cheese with the mayo...other than that it was ok. Good flavor, bad texture. I think that this just wasnt my cup of tea, I am sure other people would enjoy though!

almost didn't make this as it was a very hot day here and didn't want to run the oven, I'm glad I did though as this was very yummy to the tummy. I used the precooked bacon that you can buy now. Also added a touch of Lowry's season salt.

I cubed the potatoes, added a couple squirts of ranch dressing, used marble cheddar and omitted the olives.  I topped the dish with half the bacon and some snipped chives.  We loved it!!

I made this recipe for a family reunion and it went so fast I didn't even get a chance to try it!  It must be super yummy though as I had people asking for the recipe months later!  Every time we have a family get together they start raving about it all over again.  Guess one of these days I'll have to break down and try it myself.

This was really very good, but not a salad at all.  This is better described as a cheesy potato side dish.  It was yummy though!!!
