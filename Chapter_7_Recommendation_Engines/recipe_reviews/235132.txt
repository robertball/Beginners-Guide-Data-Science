This was awesome, I hadn't had Shrimp Curry since childhood when Mom made it, she used a Cream of Shrimp soup version and I gotta say this beats it. Really easy to put together especially for me who shouldn't be anywhere near a kitchen. Thanks For Contributing

I made this exactly as written and it was very good! I love curry and this is an easy go to recipe. I used McCormicks medium curry powder and threw in a handful of golden raisins. Next time, I will add a few hot pepper flakes as suggested ! Great recipe, thanks!

Absolutely delicious. Not a drop left over. I did increase the curry powder to 2 TBSP. Will definitely make again.

This was great with my substitutions. I added peppers and scallions to the onion and butter mixture. I used coconut milk instead of regular milk. I used vegetable broth. I used 7 tablespoons of butter since I added peppers. I used 3 tablespoons of homemade curry powder. I had no ginger. Used 1/4 cup of flour. I precooked my shrimp lobster and scallops like 2 minute before adding to curry coconut mixture.  Next time I'll have coconut to garnish.

Yum! I added a splash of white wine, mushrooms, green onions, chick peas, dill, and cayenne. I had some extra ingredients to use up but I'm sure the original recipe is delicious as written. Great with jasmine rice. Red bell pepper would be a nice addition for more color.

I usually make things exactly the first time but I changed a couple of things that didn’t make much difference to the whole.  I added 3 celery stalks and 3 carrots diced in 3/8” dice to onion when sautéing.  Did everything else the same.  Needed more salt and almost the original amount of curry added at the end. I will DEFINITELY leave out the sugar last time .  And since we avoid rice, pasta, etc, I served it with stir fried cauliflower rice.  While eating my hubby said I needed to get more carrots because I needed to make this again later in the week.  He already has dibs on the leftovers for tomorrow ??.

Perfect combination of heat and sweet. The thickness of the curry sauce is perfect. Very wholesome, easy, and quick dinner even if uncooked shrimp are used.

Loved how easy and quick this was to make. I cut down the flour a bit, used raw shrimp, and added paprika and cayenne pepper. Good stuff!

Omit the flour and use coconut milk instead of milk/stock. Added garlic with the onions, lime instead of lemon and basil at the end! Great quick curry!!

I kept the recipe as is except I went with 2 Tbsp of curry powder.  Very tasty!  And so easy to make!  This will definitely be a staple dinner.

Looked and smelled great, but it was pretty bland.  Kids liked it though.

It was a bit one dimensional as written. Adding some red pepper flakes and fresh chopped basil help immensely.

Made it! Awesome and easy. Might want to add more shrimp - everyone always like to fish those out. Very yummy!??
