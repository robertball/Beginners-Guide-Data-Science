These are my favorite cookies to make.  They are so simple and delicious.  They're addictive really.  I make them bite size so I don't feel bad eating 4 at a time!

These are absolutely awesome cookies!  I'll be sure to double the recipe next time!  I added some finely ground coconut and partially chopped all the peanuts in a processor and skipped putting a whole nut on the top.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!
