This recipe could be a 5 star recipe w/ some modifications.  We modified the recipe after we'd eaten 1 serving, so I'm not 100% on the amount, but basically, it needed significantly more water than what the recipe called for.  It needs at least 3 1/2 cups of water.  In addition, it was rather bland, so we added an envelope of Lipton's Onion Soup mix.  These two things seemed to make a big difference!

From similar recipes, I believe the wild rice is supposed to be cooked BEFORE adding it to the casserole.

I agree with the above reviewer. This has potential for 5 stars but...way too little water. I had printed this out before anyone had reviewed and should have realized when I was making it that much more water was needed. Personally only added salt and pepper. Like the wild rice/almond/water chestnut flavors. Will make again with above recommended water.
