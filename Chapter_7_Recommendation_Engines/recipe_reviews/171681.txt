I have been making this appetizer for many many years, I absolutely love it!!  One tip, use fresh shrimp instead of the canned stuff, it is WAY better!!  Other than that, I like to use triscuits for my cracker of choice.

This made an excellent contribution to our Christmas Eve appetizer table. It's very festive and colorful thanks to the red and green peppers. Next time I might add extra shrimp. I definitely recommend adding the mozzarella and peppers - a splendid mixture of flavors when topped on a cracker.

Green onion is the only other thing I added and only because I had it and saw it mentioned in another review and we love them. This dip is excellent and I already plan on making it for our New Years gathering. I agree with other reviewers in the fact that fresh shrimp is best but you'd have to chop it up really fine so canned salad ones worked perfectly for me. Thank you for the great recipe!

I have been making the recipe for years, it was given to me by my aunt. It makes a very nice christmas presentation. I add celery, green onion and roma tomatoes to my topping. Also if I cant get fresh shrimp then I use frozen. Sociables crackers go really well. This looks very nice on an oval platter.

I made this last night for a New Year's Eve party and it was a hit.   Some people didn't realize it was shrimp.   I liked it a lot and will make again.

I have made this recpies a couple of times now and am planning on making it again at Christmas.  So delicious and everyone could not stop eating it until it was gone!  I also added some green onion and cut back on the amount of cocktail sauce.  YUMMY!

Perfect dip for the holidays and beyond! Love the color.I substituted fresh chopped shrimp for the canned and added some chopped green onion. Very tasty and totally additive. I could eat the whole dip myself! Thank you for providing this recipe and making the holiday more fun through ease of prep and tastiness.

This is a version of a family recipe we have used for years and is a favorite for Thanksgiving and Christmas while we wait for dinner.  We don't add the peppers or Mozz. Cheese, great idea!! Have to try it this year. The plate I use 2 packs of cream cheese for all the guest at my cousins and plate is always empty by the time dinner is over, everyone loves it and so do I.

Couldn't  find baby salad shrimp in the freezer section, so splurged and bought medium cooked shrimp. I pulled tails and cut in thirds. Turned out even tastier as the larger shrimp had more of a shrimp taste than the teeny baby shrimp. Lasted several days for me- just needed to drain the watery drain off around the edge of plate.
