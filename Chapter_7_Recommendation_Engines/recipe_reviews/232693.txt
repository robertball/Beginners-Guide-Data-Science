Pretty good soup.  A whole box of meatballs is too much.  Use about 1/2 the box.  I also cut my meatballs in half to make them more bite sized.  I used 2 cans of mushrooms, 1 can corn and about 1 to 1.5 cups of sliced carrots as the vegetable.  I also started the soup with a finely chopped onion and 2 cloves minced garlic cooked until translucent in about a tbsp. of oil.  Then add the rest of your ingredients.  I also added about 2 tsp hot sauce & think it could have used a bit more.  My family liked it and I would make it again.  Pretty easy to make with what you have on hand.

This is a great work-night recipe as it doesn't require much prep and still tastes great. The only change I made was to use two cans of beans, and I used cannellini and northerns I had on hand - otherwise, this recipe is great as written and filling - always important if I'm putting soup on the table!

We love this soup! The only change I will make in the future is to cut back on the number of meatballs because I found that they overwhelmed the soup in the quoted amount. Definitely going in our regular rotation!

The empty pot says it all! Happy happy people at dinner tonight. Almost polished off this big pot. One of my favorite soups ever!

Great starter recipe to use up the "little bit of this, little bit of that" you have creeping around in your fridge.

This is the second time I've made this recipe.  Great flavor, however the Italian seasoning was a little strong for me so this time I cut it down to one tsp.

Mostly great, but the frozen veggies didn't go over well with the kids -- it seemed overloaded with green beans.  I like the concept of using frozen meatballs, but I used about half of what it called for and also cut them in half to be more bite sized.  I seasoned with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.

I changed it a bit -- no beef broth, a bit of other spices (onion salt, oregano, basil, garlic) instead of Italian Seasoning, extra vegetables and meatballs, white kidney beans instead of red.  I also sauteed some of the vegetables in olive oil before adding the other ingredients. 
This is the type of recipe that you can alter to your taste.  It's so delicious!  Everyone in my family loved it and I'll be making it again for sure.

Super easy to make.  I had to make a couple alterations with what I had on hand - white kidney beans instead of red, a can of diced tomatoes instead of stewed, and a can of mixed veggies, drained, instead of frozen.  I had mini Italian meatballs so I cut back just a little on the Italian seasoning I added.  Would make again!

Good busy day recipe. Easy to put together and cook quickly. I made my own meatballs and only needed half the amount stated. Good taste and a nice hearty soup.
