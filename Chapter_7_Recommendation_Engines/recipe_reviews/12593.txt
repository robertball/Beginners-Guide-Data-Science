I just finished making this and it's delicious! I added the zest of an orange along with the soaked cranberries, I think that really added to it and made it look pretty too. The only thing that keeps it from being five stars is that it could be more "sour creamy" tasing in my opinion. I might try adding more next time.

Not quite the flavor I expected, but very good, and very rich because of the sour cream.

This was an attempted dessert for Thanksgiving.  The pie sat up very well, however, you couldn't taste the cranberries but you could taste the flour.  If I where to try this again I would exchange the flour for appropriate amount of cornstarch.  Did not get good reviews from family members either.  Not likely to make it again.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY and it didn't hold its shape at all.  Forget about cutting it, just grab a spoon!  Had a very custardy taste but was very creamy.  Tasted ok, but would prefer to eat other things.  If you're making this, be sure to add an extra cup of dried cranberries, otherwise very skimpy.

I didn't think this pie was very good at all. Maybe I made it wrong? I am not sure. I was very boring and bland and it was more of a plain cream pie than anything else. I wouldn't recommend taking to any thanksgiving day. I came home with a whole pie!

This cream filling is excellent!  It would be great with other fruit such as bananas, peaches, etc.  Very, very good.

I read the reviews and doubled the amount of cranberries and added the orange zest..... it turned out AMAZING. it was a big hit . sweet but not overly so.
