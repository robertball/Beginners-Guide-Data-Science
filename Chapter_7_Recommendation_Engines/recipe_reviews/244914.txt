I LOVE THIS. I made it for me and my mom and it was AMAZING. I also added seaweed chips to it (only one) to see how it would taste and it was awesome would definitely be making again

I've made these twice, and they were great both times.  Just took these to a party with some peanut dipping sauce and  they were super popular.  Thanks Chef John!

The video was very helpful to watch before attempting this recipe. Chef John has a lot of helpful tips. I used fried tofu and added lots of basil and cilantro - they were a hit (and were fun to make). Admittedly, homemade spring rolls are a lot of work. I did all the chopping the night before, and then assembled and rolled the day of the party. Great recipe!

Fantastic recipe. I added chopped radishes and chopped jalapenos for some extra zip.

Excellent alternative to the Vietnamese spring roll. However, I would make some changes to recipe. I peeled the carrot and half of the cucumber to reduce the toughness in each bite and that worked out well. It only took me about 3 seconds to wet my rice paper wrapper, including flipping to the opposite side. I was confused by Chef John's meaning of "baby greens," so I would rewrite that to cucumbers and carrots. I found that I already had enough in my roll without adding another layer of chicken and pepper and I ended up making 6 rolls instead of 4 and they were still huge, something to keep in mind if you're making a large quantity. As others mentioned, this is delicious with a peanut sauce and I recommend a simple one by the Minimalist Baker on the interwebs.

I am not a cook but I love cooking food and trying new food at restruants. Big fan of Asian style cooking but no experience. I like combining styles but am a bit afraid to experament.  This video gave me the basics and confidence I needed to exparament.   I added a bit of my own home made chicken stock that has parcley, onion powder, gqrlic, chili powder.  Then I added thin slices of pork spiced with my custom spice of smoked paprika, awesome.  Thank you. I'll start taking pics.
