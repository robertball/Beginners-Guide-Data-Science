This was so yummy.  I used the imitation crabmeat.  I wasn't sure what kind of red pepper the recipe really calls for, so I used part of a red bell pepper.  super easy to make, very pretty on the table,  and delicious!  Have had a lot of requests for the recipe, so I sent them to the website.  Thanks!

Everyone seemed to like this dip! Easy, too. Forgot to add shredded cheese and it was not missed, still delish.

I made this for Easter and everyone loved the spread.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly since I used crab sticks instead of the canned crab meat and I used regular cream cheese instead of the cream cheese in the tub.  It still turned out great.

I made this for a meeting at my church and it was a big success.  
Did not change the recipe.  I was asked by a lot of women to bring copies to the next meeting.  
Also made it for a trip to the beach this summer.
