The ingredients and the amounts given in this recipe are fine, but as a professional pastry chef, I don't feel that the way it is prepared is the very BEST way you can serve Creme Brulee. 
After pouring a little of the hot cream into the egg yolk mixture and whisking briskly, pour the cream/yolk mixture into the rest of the cream and whisk. There will be a lot of foam on the top. Skim this off with a strainer and throw away. The double boiler step is not necessary. 
Pour the hot mixture into individual serving dishes or ramekins and place in a baking dish. Set the dish with the ramekins in it on your oven shelf, then pour hot water in the dish so the water comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake at 375 anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes. They are done when you shake the dish gently and the brulees jiggle just slightly in the middle. The jiggle shouldn't be a liquid jiggle, but more of a gelatin-like jiggle.
Remove from oven and let the brulees cool in the water bath for about 15 minutes, then remove and put the brulees in the refrigerator to chill. Just before serving, sprinkle the tops with white granulated sugar and shake off the excess. Place under broiler til caramelized or use a propane torch to burn the tops. Serve immediately. Part of the fun of Creme Brulee comes from the crispiness of the burnt top compared to the creaminess of the custard. When you burn the top and then re-refrigerate the custards, the top will become soft again, which isn't as pleasing to t

Great recipe, when following the modifications suggested by chefpone in the earlier reviews. To stop the custard cooking again when you caramelise the sugar under the grill/broiler, pack the tray around the dishes of creme brulee with ice. This keeps the wonderful contrast in texture between the hot and crispy layer of burnt sugar, and the cool slightly wobbly creme beneath. Lovely.

I've made this creme brulee over and over for the last couple years and it's a big hit each time.  I followed the suggestions from CHEFPEON.  I do lower the temp of the oven to 350 and cook 20 mins though. turns out great!

Excellent flavor  & texture using chefpeon's suggestions. I was a first timer and it was quite simple with one exception: the sugar mathematics don't add up unless I'm completely missing something. In total there are 8T sugar, 6 white (divided) and 2 brown. The recipe says use 4T (brown & white sugar)in the egg mixture and the remaining 2T for the topping to torch. (!!!) I did graduate from college;  where are the other 2Tbsp in this recipe? Why is the 6T white sugar divided in the first place? Anyhow, enough of a rant...I added all of the sugar in the egg mixture, reserving enough to coat the tops and torch.

This was so delicious! I followed the suggestions of ChefPeon and they turned out perfectly. I also, instead of adding vanilla extract to the egg mixture, cut open a vanilla bean and threw that into the cream while it was heating. I also found that the brown sugar burned a little too much when I torched it, so maybe I will just use white sugar next time.

A little different than other versions I have, but still a winner -- I did find, however, that this did not work to a custard-like consistency, which I enjoyed very much.

This was so easy to make and delicious and a real crowd pleaser.  The only reason why I could not give this 5 stars is that a very important step is missing.  When trying this recipe, follow the review from chefpeon to make it a 5 star recipe.  This is definitely a keeper.

I have made this recipe so many times because my entire family loves it.  They can never get enough.  The only different step I make is when baking I put the custart dishes in a baking pan with water.  Turns out super creamy. It's a thumbs up!

This was a great recipe for creme brulee.  It was my first time making it so I went ahead and used CHEFPEON's suggestions and it turned out just like a restaurant dessert.  Thanks for sharing such a simple yet decadent dessert.

This is a decent creme brulee recipe, but I have 3 suggestions that I feel makes a huge difference. 
1- When I have made creme brulee in the past, I have added my hot milk to my whipped egg yolk/sugar mixture slowly. After that I add that mixture directly into my ramekins. I don't believe you need to add it back to your double boiler for the 3 mins suggested.
2- I always place my ramekins in a deep baking pan in about a half inch water. When I tried this recipe, I did some each way (with and without the water bath), and the ones in the water were lighter and fluffier. It definitely is worth the extra step.
3- Brown sugar melts differently than white on top. I noted the brown sugar actually burned before the white, which didn't give the desired hardened sugar affect and also affected taste. I have always used just white granulated sugar, and I think this works better.

Excellent creme brulee. Enjoy!

When made using the suggestions by CHEFPEON it was EXCELLENT! I've had both parents, a sister and my husband request that I make this for their special occasion desserts (birthdays, anniversarys, etc) and it's always soooo good. I highly recomend that with so few ingredients involved, use the best quality you can find. I always make using vanilla beans rather than vanilla extract and use turbinado sugar (sugar in the raw) as my topping which I carmalize using a torch. I HIGHLY recomend a torch rather than the broiler. If only rarely using you can get an inexpensive model at a kitchen supply store for about 20$ and fuel will last for quite a few batches of creme brulee.

Sometimes the simple dishes are the best dishes. This delicious dessert is elegant and easy. Used a vanilla bean instead of the extract. I used the oven and they turned out ok, but I prefer using a blow torch when I'm at home in the USA. (One thin layer of white sugar, torch, another layer of sugar and torch it again. That will get the results of an award-winning French chef.)

Just do what CHEFPEON says to do and you won't have any issues.  It's not necessary to pre-cook in a double boiler at all.   I tell people I make creme brulee and they think I am "magical" but it's a stupid simple thing to make.  Just use good ingredients and vanilla and everything will be perfect.  By the way I use vanilla PASTE and not liquid extract and IMHO it gives it a more pure vanilla taste.

This is a wonderful recipe. My Brulee came out perfect. The flavor and texture were just right. I did follow the suggestion of baking in a hot water bath. I will be making this often.

This is a good recipe. But....you really shouldn't use brown sugar on top. Powdered sugar or white sugar is best (I put my white sugar in a food processor and blitz for 30 secs). It makes a thinner and tastier crust on top. Also a tip for the water bath, if you have a tea pot, heat your water in that and pour from there.  Less sloshing and chances of spilling into the ramekins. If no kettle/tea pot, pour the hot water into a heat resistant pitcher and slowly pour.   Another tip to remember is about the eggs. Generally, no more than 3 egg yolks per pint of cream. Any more than that and it starts to turn pasty.   Just my two cents!

Cooking this way changes the texture. The flavor isn't exactly what I was hoping for but taste good. This creamed brulee recipe is a starters recipe for the new cook. When Baking custard you must always place the ramekins into a deep pan filled with water half way u the sides of the ramekins. This helps prevent curdling of the eggs in the recipe.

I followed the recipe to a T and it came out perfect!  I made it as a surprise for my fiance on our anniversary and he loved it--he's had MANY creme brulees (pretty much every time he eats out he checks the dessert menu for it) and he said that this was one of the best he's ever had.  I made creme brulee for him about four years ago and it took HOURS and honestly, it was only 'ok'.  Nothing to rave about.  This was great and SOO easy!  Thick, rich, delicious--and the sugar crust came out PERFECT!  You do really need to watch it.. just pull it out and check it every thirty seconds or so while it is broiling, because it is difficult to see with just the oven light on--you may burn it by accident.  This happened to one of mine and I just skimmed off the burnt sugar top (a bit stayed around the edges) and redid it.  Thanks for the delicious, fast, and easy recipe--I never realized making creme brulee could be so painless!

Five Stars with CHEFPEON's suggestions.  I did 6 yolks, 4 Tblsp Sugar, and 1/2 tsp Vanilla mixed in a pot...2 1/2 C Heavy Cream in a separate pan pan until just before scalded (over med heat).  Turn yolks on to med heat and slowly add in the cream, continue whisking.  I cook it for about 3-ish minutes, then strain into a large Kerr jar.  From there I pour into ramekins, use a water bath, and bake at 375 for about 25-ish minutes...until it shakes like Jello.  Cool in waterbath for 15 minutes, then refrigerate.  When ready to serve, Add regular sugar, and torch :)

I've made this several times and follow the other reviewers notes about skipping the double boiler method. I also cook mine in a water bath for about 30 mins at 375*. I never add the brown sugar. For flavor changes sometimes I add Bailey's Irish cream (about 2 TBSP) to the egg mixture or this last time I added freshly ground coffee to the cream while it was heating and a square of semi sweet chocolate chopped up just as I took it off of the stove. The mocha one was my best yet.

This creme brulee turned out great.  I followed other's advice about using a water bath, and I found I didn't need the second cooking.  I had to cook it longer, but that could be because I used a larger dish.  It made only two, not five.  It was pretty eggy though, so next time I am going to use a recipe with less eggs, and use a 4 inch dish.

I followed the process posted by the pastry chef as well.   Very easy and came out nice!  With 5" ramekins, it took 20 minutes to cook to the correct firmness.   Only one thing I would do different next time is ADD MORE vanilla.   It was not nearly enough vanilla impact in the taste.

I used these ingredients but I added 1/2 teaspoon of Triplesec. I also followed ChefPeon's instructions.
TERRIFIC!

Good recipe. I followed CHEFPEON's advice about not cooking the egg/cream mixture before baking and the custard set perfectly and was sublimely smooth and creamy. I personally would have preferred the custard a little sweeter, but the caramelized sugar did add a wonderful sweet crunch. Also, I had always thought that you had to eat the creme brulee RIGHT AWAY to avoid the sugar from dissolving, but I actually put some uneaten ones in the fridge and the caramelized sugar was still hard a couple hours later (definitely starting to dissolve the next morning, though).

So rich and so good! I made mine carb friendly by using Splenda instead of sugar. I also left the brown sugar off the top of mine, but made the rest of the fam's with and we all loved it.

I give it a two because the recipe on it's own is not good.  It lacks lacks direction.  Using the tips found here from other users made it great.  I used baker's sugar when making the custard to make it easier on myself (breakdowns much better) and standard white sugar for the crusting.  I tried brown sugar on one and did not like it at all.

I think I may have over cooked mine. Tried this recipe today but it was a little like scrambled eggs when I came to eat it. It rose up in the oven like soufflés. Don't think that is meant to happen.

I give this rating using the suggestions by CHEFPEON.  I did add an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  I used the broiler.  The whole top didn't get crunchy, but it was close enough.  So easy.

This is a great recipe but I must mention that it is imperative that you bake these in a water bath. My first time making these, I did not use a water bath and my custard curdled. The second I used the water bath and it was perfect. I only use brown sugar on top.

Ingredients are just right, taste very good! But you might want to use a torch to caramelize the sugar on the top instead of baking, and add 1-2 raspberry / blackberry / blueberry for presentation.

The taste was amazing!  I skipped the double boiler step and followed the instructions of another reviewer and just cooked it after whisking the milk and eggs together. I cooked it for 30 minutes or so.  There were no lumps, but it was a little on the soft side, so I would probably cook it for another ten minutes.  If that doesn't work, I would probably try adding another egg yolk to see what that does.  High class dessert with little work.  Love it! :)

This recipe gives you a solid foundation for a great Creme Brulee as long as you follow the suggestions by ChefPeon.   I personally think it impossible to call it Creme Brulee unless you're taken a torch to it....the broiler just doesn't cut it.

Great recipe for basic creme brulee, I followed Chefpeon's recommendations.  I did not have enough individual ramekins, so I cooked mine in a larger dish and had to extend cooking time to 35 minutes.  Delicious, I'd like to try addding different flavors next time.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars based on my results when using Chefpeon's modifications.  I served this at a small dinner party and it was a hit!  One of our guests works in the restaurant industry and is somewhat of a food snob - even she was super impressed.  I don't have a strainer so I just used a spoon and a curved spatula to skim off the foam after combining the cream/egg mixture. My ramekins are from an actual creme brulee "set" that my husband had bought for me, and they are pretty small.  I ended up filling 4 of those to the top, plus two pretty large glass ramekins.  The smaller ones took about 20 minutes in the oven, while the larger ones took about 25 mins.  I let them all sit at room temp for a while before putting in the fridge to avoid condensation.   I used only white sugar on top before torching, and they turned out perfectly.  The only downfall is that my butane torch is small (it's from the set) and it took a while to carmelize the tops.  The actual custard ended up being warmer than I would have like when I served it, but that could also be due to the shallowness of the ramkekins.  Overall - fantastic recipe, super easy, and sure to impress!

I made this today and was extremely disappointed. It tasted more like custard than creme brulee.  I have made creme brulee many times and never had it turn out with the texture this one did.  Don't know what I did wrong as I followed the chef's suggestions and skipped the double boiler and used the water bath.  The texture was way to thick. I tossed out the entire batch.  I was going off the reviews on this one but I have to say, not good.

I also followed the instructions by Chefpeon which were simpler, and I cut the recipe in half but I put it all in one ramekin which was filled up, so mine took almost an hour to cook.  It still didn't look ready when I took it out of the oven, and I didn't have time to let it cool in the water bath so I put it straight in the fridge. However it set up just fine :)  Next time I will just put it in a larger dish, and I will not sprinkle the brown sugar on top - it's too sticky, and the chunks of brown sugar burned too quickly.  Thanks for this simple recipe that is still impressive.

This is surprisingly easy, and turned out really well for my first foray into creme brulee. followed the chefpeon instructions, they turned out perfectly. be careful not to put too much sugar on top to carmelize, i ended up once with a crust so thick i had to throw it out

I followed Chef Peon's suggestions and my creme brulee came out fabulously! It is very easy to make, it's just time consuming. Heating the cream took the longest. I heated the cream at low heat for an hour and it never started to bubble! Next time, I'll turn up the temperature a bit so I don't have to wait so long again! I found that if I topped a ramekin with a thicker coat of sugar, it will be more crunchy, which is what I want!

This recipe is delicious.  The only advice we would like to make is to put two thin coatings of sugar instead of a heaping spoonful.  The candied crust will come out more uniform and the chances of burning the sugar will be less.

Like a lot of the other reviewers, I too used CHEFPEON's recommendations about the recipe. It turned out fantastic! My boyfriend loves the Creme Brulee that we get at Ruth's Criss Steakhouse, and it was just like it. So easy for such a fancy dessert...and it looks and tastes very impressive! Makes you look like a professional chef when you serve it!

Who knew creme brulee was this easy!  I almost feel bad reviewing this, as I didn't follow the preparation guidelines at all (but I did follow the ingredients exactly).  I followed the pastry chef's recommendations.  I tempered my egg yolks, skipped the double boiler, baked in individual ramekins in the water bath, chilled, and added the sugar at the last minute.  I could not get my sugar to melt properly.  That's okay, though, because now I have a reason to get one of those torches!  My rating is based on taste, which was out of this world, and WOW factor!

This is the first creme brulee recipe that has actually worked for me!  Used ingredients exactly as listed, but followed instructions of other reviewers and skipped double boiler step.  I cooked in one big baking dish at 375 degress in hot water bath for about 45 minutes and it was perfect.  The combination of brown and white sugar for the topping was good!  The only reason for not giving a five stars was I thought it could have a more intense vanilla taste.  Maybe using a vanilla bean pod would produce that as in some other recipes I've tried.  Thank you for a recipe that actually made a custard--and not a runny mess!

Great recipe and a total hit with the friends and family.  Would suggest to temper the eggs by setting them out early so as not to produce scrambled eggs when you add the hot creme mixture to your egg.

Came out great! Used Chefpeon's tips. The combined, modified recipe is here:  Tips for cosmetics:

Only thing is that we changed to topping to white sugar only (burned more evenly than the brown sugar/white sugar mix).

Easy and good, but I ultimately used additional instructions from chef review and it turned out great. Added scrapings of vanilla bean for extra flavor.

Simple, tasty and always a hit with the guests. Used ChefPeons adjustments and worked great. If you are using Ramekins, yield is going to be 4 servings.

I love this recipe! I lightly foil mine so that the tops don't burn. (The oven I use is convection.) I also use the brulee torch to pop the bubbles on the top of each ramekin before baking. I also dont refrigerate after burning the sugar since I don't want it to condensate or sog out. I love All Recipes!

Thought this was excellent..be sure to have ramekins on hand..I made this in 2 regular size bowls and it wasnt AS good because of this..also when I went to melt the sugar coating..It didn't work as well by placing it back into the oven..would work much better with a mini torch! I followed the pastry chef's suggestions and did not use a double broiler...turned out DELICIOUS!

I fell in love with the creme brulee at the Le Village buffet in Paris Las Vegas, and any creme brulee recipe I try...I always hope to mimick it. This recipe--with some alterations from chefpeon--is good by its own virtue. It's very creamy & not too sweet. However, it's just too darn creamy and custard-like while I prefer a more solid flan-like texture and that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars. If you like creamy desserts, this is probably the one to try.

very simple recipe for creme brulee. I added 4 Tbs. of Nutella for Chocolate and Hazelnut creme brulee, so it made a bit more than 5 servings. I used 5 oz. souffle dishes to make these. I highly recommend this recipe. So basic, and easy to add different ingredients to make different flavors.

I followed chefpeon's directions as well and it came out beautifully! so silky smooth, absolutley devine... very simple to do and fast... I have a brulee torch and would recommend using that... putting the custard bake under the broiler melts it and heats it up MUCH more than the torch does..

Well, I changed the extract,  I used banana. The texture was foamy, I would suggest skimming the final mixture.  I would suggest using a torch or pack the dishes in ice when broiling .

This recipe is only 5 stars if you take the chef's recommendations from several years past that everyone refers to. It makes the recipe super easy and perfect. I would add just a little more sugar though but otherwise perfect!

Terrible recipe. The consistency was more like a thick omelette, when cold. After it was broiled, it left a nice sugar shell on top but the 'custard' was runny.The taste of the egg yolk was strong in each bite.

I recently had creme brulee on a trip and so wanted to make it when I got home.  I scoured the net for what sounded like an easy recipe and finally found this one.  I took the suggestions of Chef and did not use the double boiler.  This being my first time making creme brulee I was a bit hesitant to make substitutions but to cut the calories I used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream.  It didn't compromise the texture or flavour at all - I was so pleased.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this recipe with the modifications that CHEFPEON suggested.  I am eating it right now!  SO GOOD!  I was too stingy on the cooling time.  Do let it rest and cool properly before you brulee the sugar on the top.  Would be fantastic with a very small pinch of freshly grated cinnamon.  I can't wait to try this out on friends!

Very good, but I can't give it 5 stars because, like many others, I also followed CHEFPEON's advice.  Delicious!  The only thing I disagreed with is that I actually like it better if it goes back in the fridge for a little bit after caramelizing the top.  Not too long, just long enough to cool the custard back down - maybe 20-30 minutes.  I just put a few fresh raspberries on top and it was scrumptious!

As Chefpeon says the ingredients are fine, except for the brown sugar. You never ever use brown sugar. You use white granulated sugar. The brown sugar that is made today is made by adding molasses to granulated sugar. So if you want a molasses flavor to the creme brulee, by all means use brown sugar.

My 5 star rating is based on following CHEFPEON's suggestions; I didn't try the original directions.  I skipped the double boiler and baked @ 375 for 22 minutes.  The flavor and texture were perfect!

this was sooooooooo good! I had never made creme brulee before so wasnt sure how it would turn out. I followed chef peon's advice. i jsut think i might have baked it a little too long because it was dark brown when i took it out, and then when i added the sugar and put it under the broiler it burned a little. but apart from that it was YUMMY!

Very easy and great flavor.  Most creme brulee recipes are the same and my husband was looking for just the basic creme brulee.  It was the first time I had tried to make it and it came out perfect.

Following Chef Peon's instructions, the texture was perfect, and the taste was rich, not too sweet. The only thing I changed was to infuse a whole vanilla bean in the cream as it was heating on the stove. I split it lengthwise and stirred the seeds into the cream, and threw in the pod, dicarding it after the cream heated to the correct temperature. Chef Peon's review is on the last page, since she was one of the first to review the recipe.

Awesome!  It makes enough for 8-10 people easily.... so we are going to half the recipe next time.  Also, we love sauce, so we are going to have a side of sauce on the table.  Otherwise - so easy (use the bag trick to fill the shells).  Hubby and I fixed it for Valentines Day along with a salad...perfect!

I served this for Christmas dinner (following CHEFPEON's directions) and it was a HUGE hit.  Next time I will use brownulated brown sugar (my topping clumped a bit).  The fact that most of the work was done the day before made for a simple final prep with a giant WOW factor.

I was nervous about this recipe because I know that Creme Brulee can be a delicate dessert... Unfortunately, my stab at it didn't come out so well. It had a very strong taste of the egg and like it was overcooked. I didn't have a torch to glaze it and I'm afraid putting it in the broiler might've over done it. I wish it would've been better.

Oh. My. GAWD.
If I could give more stars, I would.
If I could marry this recipe, I would.
I've always been intimidated by this, and it's my hubby's fav, so it was relegated to fancy restaurant date night...Not any more!!
Using ChefPeon's instructions, I made my husbands favorite dessert and he deemed it 'The best Creme Brulee I've ever had'.  And I can't believe how SIMPLE this was.  Came together in 10 minutes, with 4 ingredients (minus the brown sugar). This is so easy, I have it MEMORIZED. THANK YOU THANK YOU!!

I followed the advice given by other reviewers and skipped the second cooking step- no need!!! My big issue with this recipe is the size of the pan/ ramekins... the recipe doesnt say what size pans to use. I used 4oz ramekins and i found there to be too much creme brulee and not enough yummy crunchy sugar- so i will try to remake this and use a bowl with a bigger area so more sugar can be burned on top!! Also- the broiler does a very poor job of burning the sugar compared to using a small kitchen torch. I will remake this and then review again with bigger pans!

My son did a class presentation on Monaco and needed to take some type of authentic food.  Seeing as it's mostly French and extremely expensive there, we needed something that would be ooood and ahhhhhd at.  I found this recipe and with the help from good ol' Chefpeon, we had a winner!  I followed the chef's instructions to the T, except I poured mine into 17 tin and paper cupcake wrappers.  If anyone else chooses to try this, I recommend putting a wet towel over the cupcake holders prior to putting them in to broil.  This will keep them from burning.  They were very impressive little treats and every child in the class wants the recipe for their mom!  If the original recipe was Chefpeons I would have given this 5 stars.  I cant wait to make in larger portions for my own family.

This recipe is great (following th edirections of Chef Peon) , but I do not think that I properly broiled the top as it what not crispy!  I put ice water in water bath after refrigerating for an hour, but the water and creme began bubbling after about five minutes.  The top of the creme was not browning though.  I took it out at that point.  Should I have waited longer?  Should I have waited longer for the oven to heat up (I'm not as familiar with the broiling setting of the oven unfortunately)? I will turn to this recipe when I want to make creme brulee again, but I will try a few different things to brown the top next time.

I followed Chefpeons suggestions and it came out absolutely perfect. I amazed myself. I do not own a kitchen torch so i had to put it under the broiler.  The top came out crispy but it did heat it up way way too much.  In that respects it is a 4 star, but had I had a torch, it is a 5 star.  I will definately be investing in a torch for the next time around. This is my boyfriends favorite dessert and he said it tasted like it came from a fancy restaurant. I will make again.  Too bad it has to be so fattening and 'bad' for you!  Sure was delicious though!

I made this tonight and we were all surprised to find the custard creamy and rich, and not super eggy like some homemade creme brulee tastes.  We LOVED how easy this was and it really is foolproof! I didn't tent the ramekins with foil but it was fine.  Some people said they would have preferred a thicker layer of sugar on top (I used about a tablespoon and a half...dumped it on top and just tipped the ramekins until the top was covered.  It's a lot easier than trying to evenly sprinkle sugar from a spoon).  Would defintely make this again!

There was so much foam after mixing that I could not tell when the spoon was "coated" and over cooked my creme brulee.  Honestly, I don't see the need for the double boiler.  My advice is to skip that step all together.  Overall, good taste but proceedure needs to be adjusted.

My family loved this and want me to make it again.  I don't get the appeal, but it was sure in demand after I made it the first time.

I also used chefpeon's adjustments and in addition I substituted a couple of  tablespoons of the cream with grand marnier and used only granulated sugar on top. Easy and awesome. Thank you Karen.

A very smooth creme brulee.  I also followed the Chef's suggestions.  However I used all white sugar on top (not brown sugar) and used a butane torch to caramelize the sugar.  This is the tradional way and soooooo good!

I took chefpeon's advice, thank you chef, by the way.  And the recipe came out awesome!!  I had been wanting to make this for some time now.  My  boyfriend's father is somewhat hard to please in the cooking arena. So when he told me it was as good as they make in the finest restaurant's in Paris, which he'd been to, I was ecstatic to say the least!!!!!!!  Thank you to Karen for sending in the recipe.

I made this recipe and followed the tips by chefpeon.  It came out fantastic.  The only thing I would suggest is to get a mini torch to carmelize the tops.  By putting it under the broiler, you are actually cooking the custard and it looses its firmness.  Otherwise, its great!

We're not all pastry chefs and have no desire to make life that complicated. This recipe worked very well as written. Smooth, creamy, delicious!! I used my torch (a totally fun kitchen gadget) to make the sugar crust right before serving. SO EASY! SO YUMMY!!

Just add the hot cream to the eggs really slow so that they don't cook and this is a winner. I've made it several times and it never fails to impress.

crème brulee is  always a favorite dessert   of mine ,when we  go  out to eat .
 I'm  so happy I can make this  extremely easy  recipe at  home - it was  delicious. You- don't  need  a  torch, the   broiler works  great  - I had a nice crispy  sugar coating on top -- I  cut in half for 2 of us ---  will be  making this again and   again.  
 one more thing I did bake this custard in  about 1 inch of water.

This was the first time I made creme brûlée. It was easy, and turned out wonderful!! Better than most I've had at restaurants. I did add a tad bit more vanilla. ( next time I'll try a vanilla bean or 2)

This is a very good and easy way to make creme brûlée. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I combined the suggestion from CHEFPEON with this recipe, and I love the creme brûlée I made! Thank both of you and I'll make again recently! (With less brown sugar I think :) )

About how much ounces is each serving? I want to make this recipe for thirty people and serve it in 4 ounce cups but I don't know if the ingredient calculator is made for bigger servings? Thank you very much! Amazing dessert!

My husband just brought me back some amazing sweetened coconut from Hawaii and I chopped it up in my food processor and added it to the cream as it was heating and then saved some to broil along with the sugar mixture on top. It was AWESOME!!!! I also filled the chefs review and it made it so much easier. This is my favorite dessert and now I make it at home and I think it is better than a restaurant. The only thing I would change is using a vanilla bean in the cream instead of extract. But it still tastes great with the extract.

Love it, it turned out great and I didn't even need a boiler. All I did was heat up the cream to a boiling point, remove it from the stove and slowly add in the egg mixture one spoonful at a time while stirring.  And at the end I just used a blow torch on the sugar on top. For some reason the brown sugar seems to burn fast so I only use white sugar with the torch.

Although the custer was a little sweet the first time around, so the second time I only add 3 tbs to the yolk instead of 4 and it was perfect.

I used a propane torch and avoided the broiler problems. Not your little chef torches either I used my torch that I use for soldering plumbing pipes. Worked fine you just had to keep it moving and it added to the fun of our guest watching. I added berries which I also glazed with sugar and my torch after glazing the custard. Top shelf thanks.

HORRIBLE!! DON'T waste half a dozen eggs and cream on this terrible recipe. I followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out inedible. It is like a ramekin full of sweet, greasy scrambled egg. What a disappointment! I have made creme brulee before from other recipes and I have never experienced such a failure. I was a little worried since my other creme brulee recipes have been raw before going in the oven and baked in a bain marie. Should have known!!!

The worst part is this is for our dessert on Christmas Day!!! Now my poor husband is at the grocery store on Christmas Eve buying ingredients so I can make souffles instead. SUCKY! Take a look at the pic and think twice before using this recipe.

very delicious and creamy. I didn't have a propane torch and being only 13, I was a bit scared to use the broiler to  burn the sugar since I had never used it before. so to substitute the burned sugar, my sister and I tried to make caramel and put it on top of the creme brulee. my sister put 1/2 c. brown sugar and about 1/3 c. of water in a sauce pan on high. Depending on how long you cook the caramel, it will turn out more bitter the longer the time(you can also tell by the coloration) then she poured the caramel on the chilled creme brulee. we waited until the caramel was hard then we ate it. adding caramel is a perfect substitute to sweet-tooths all over

This is a wonderful recipe.  I tired it and making creme brulee for the first time - and it was easy with perfect results.  I chose to top it with warm blueberry compote (made from fresh blueberries).

Yummy, and not hard to do.  I didnt use a double boiler, and I used a water bath, baked them at 350 for 25 min worked for me.  I used the whites for angel food cake.  Both great desserts to make.

This was an excellent recipe when following the recommendations by CHEFPEON.  Not too sweet, a very nice dessert.  I used white sugar on top instead of brown and liked it very much.

Have made this several times.  Used the chef's suggestions.  It is delicious!  Have made before dinner parties, pulled out of fridge about 15 minutes before putting under broiler and it was great.

Ingredient changes: 1 tsp vanilla, 4 Tbs white sugar in brulees, 2 Tbs white fine granulated sugar for carmelizing

I gave 4 stars based on CHEFPEON’s adjustments (for which I would give 5).  It’s also rated on my second attempt.  I tried the second time because reviews said how easy and delicious it was.  My first time took forever, was disgusting and had to be thrown away.  I hope you can learn from my mistakes.  
1) I wasn’t sure what “almost boiling” was for the cream.  I heated it till I could hear a tiny noise but couldn’t see bubbles.  The cream curdled and the brulees were greasy clumpy messes.  The second time after carefully watching the pot so it didn’t make a noise, all was well.
2)  My mixer is powerful.  The beaten egg yolk mixture became froth.  Adding the curdled cream did not make it less frothy.  It was impossible to skim off the foam because it was all foam.  The second time I used a whisk instead of a beater, and rather than skimming off the top, I poured the mixture through a fine sieve into the ramekins, which seemed easier.
3)  In my second attempt I baked the brulees on the 3rd shelf down, loosely covered with a sheet of foil because the first ones had burned.  
4)  For broiling, I moved the shelf up, checking it every 30 seconds as someone suggested.  Served with fresh berries on top they were absolutely PERFECT.  My guests raved over it.  (I did too.)

recipe is easy, simple! and yummy.  I had a cooking class in making desserts so I knew how to temper the egg yolks with a few drops of warm cream and put water around the ramkins when cooking. The Creme Brulee turned out better than the brulee we made in class which called for whole eggs..just too eggy that way! I didn't worry about straining the mixture for smoothness..its just me eating them( hubby hates brulee- go figure!) but they were not lumpy!! Or maybe I gobbled them down too fast...no desserts stays too long in my kitchen!! Used blow torch on sugar....just for fun!

Wow.  I followed the directions with the modifications from Chefpeon. (thank goodness b/c I got nervous about the whole double boiler bit). I am very happy with my results!  I thought I had ruined it b/c I left it in the oven for about 25 minutes and it had begun to bubble on top a little.  But it came out delicious!  I have a little kitchen torch that I used to caramelize the sugar.  I used organic sugar, so not brown but also not white, kind of in between.  It worked really nicely. I am so excited I can make creme brulee!!

3 stars the way the recipe is posted...5 using most of CHEFPEON's suggestions.  I love Creme Brulee but was always afraid to make it.  It's easier than I thought--the hardest part is moving the water baths and not sloshign the water into the ramekins.  Here's how I do it:  Mix 6 egg yolks, 4T sugar, and 1/2t vanilla (plus a little extra).  Whisk in heated cream a little at a time so as nto to cook the yolks.  Skim off the foam and pour into ramekins (shallow ones are best!).  I bake with a foil tent as some mentioned to avoid browning the tops.  For the sugar, I just use white--I pour it on and shake it around to coat evenly (I use much mor ethan the 2T the recipe says to reserve).  I already had small propane tanks for a tabletop grill and got the torch adapter for $12 from hoem depot--much more efficient and cheaper than a fancy kitchen torch!

My ramekins were much smaller than this recipe called for apparently. So mine made 4 small servings and one small casserole dish sized one. :)

Follow Chefpeons advice, and you'll get PERFECT creme brulee!!  I find that superfine sugar is best at the end before broiling/torching.  This dessert comes out just as good as a five star restaraunt would serve!

Don't even bother with the sugar on the top. Increase the sugar slightly in the custard and enjoy it alone. So velvety and delicious and almost irresistible. But make sure and follow the recommendations by the chef and increase the temperature in the oven to 375 degrees and use a water bath (adding hot water.)

I've tried twice the other day and it came out very liquid and this is not suppose to be like that. I followed every single step and have increase the oven temperature to 400 and it still came out liquid.  I personally think this recipe is not working at all and would prefer people to browse for another recipe if you want to have a nice dessert.

Pretty easy and result is quite excellent. Do use CHEFPON's rec's. I baked them at 360 for 25 minutes but difinately start checking them at the 20 minute mark. Works well if you have the butane torch for the tops.

This is excellent, after following the chef's directions.  We made several batches, and ended up the last doubling the sugar and the vanilla.  Loved it, and we'll certainly be making this again!  BTW.....are vanilla beans always so expensive?  I looked, and the only store that carried them here had one bean for $17!  Suggestions?  Thanks!  Shannon

This recipe came out great after I made the adjustments that were recommended by the chef who commented.  I have made this recipe dozens of times and my family loves this dish.  I purchased a propane torch from Lowe's which made the sugar carmalize so nicely.  The texture of the creme did not change consistancy the way it did when I used the oven's broiler to carmalize my sugar.

The first time I made this, i used the heavy cream..was too heavy for our tastes.
So the second time I made this, I used a can of coconut milk. Was lighter and gave it great taste.
Followed the recipe with the exception of the heavy cream/coconut milk and all was good!

This was my first time making Creme Brulee.  I followed Chefpeon's instructions because I didn't like the idea of refrigerating after caramelizing the sugar topping. They turned out good, but I'll be trying different recipes to find just the right one.

I thought the recipe was great and the result was the most creamy creme brulee I have ever made.  However, I found the recipe directions to be somewhat lacking but made due on my own.  

I first whisked the eggs, vanilla, and sugar in a bowl.  I heated the cream on the stove just until boiling (probably 5-7 minutes).  I slowly added the cream to the egg mixture.  I then transferred the result to the stove and heated it another 5-7 minutes until it coated the back of my spoon.  In the meantime I had boiled water and used this to make a waterbath for my ramekins.  I used a 9 x 11 dish and placed 6 ramekins in it and added the boiling water around the ramekins so that it covered about 1/2 the side of the ramekins.  I then poured the creme brulee in the ramekins and baked for about 35 minutes.

Ingredients wise I would prefer a bit more sugar next time but they were very delicious.

I really liked this dessert. I think I am going to invest in ramekins for the next time I make this and a blow torch. I don't think I left it under the broiler long enough, but I made this just like the recipe and it tasted very good.

I made this recipe with ChefPeon's suggestions and received a lot of compliments!  Oh, and I added more sugar than the recipe called for in the custard mixture, probably an extra tablespoon or two.   Thanks for the great recipe!

A fantastic creme brulee!  I followed the advice of chefpeon, and it came out perfectly except for the caramalized topping, but that's due to my poorly heating oven and no butane torch and has nothing to do with the recipe.  I had no idea that getting restaurant quality creme brulee would be so easy!  I will definitly be making this often.

This was my first time ever making any type of custard, other than something from a box. I used my own chickens' eggs for this recipe. It turned out EXCELLENT - exactly how I'd expect creme brulee to taste! It was actually really easy to make. You don't even need a double boiler if you're careful. I sat a pot on top of a smaller pot of water instead of using a double boiler. :-)  Remember to sprinkle brown sugar on top when broiling; I tried it with just white sugar, but it wouldn't brown or crust over until I realized that I was supposed to use brown sugar. Then it was super quick to brown under the broiler - I almost burned it. :-P

I made it twice and it was delicious, even with just cinnamon on top instead of sugar. My sister can't have brown sugar though, so I tried a substitute and didn't really get that crunchy top. It was still good. I just wondered why the video showed the ceramics placed in a dry metal pan. The first time, I tried a dry pan and the custard nearly curdled. When I poured in hot water before placing in the ceramics, the creme brulee baked evenly and was smooth. Ya live and learn.

This Creme brulee is very good but only if you follow the changes that chefpeon mentioned, no double boiler needed, YES water bath, YES 375 deg 15-30 minutes (it only takes 15 min for mine), YES remove the foam.  I’ve tried several types and combinations of sugar for the top and I find that super fine white sugar (not ultra fine which is bakers or caster sugar) works best, with standard white sugar a very close second.  When using a brown sugar combo, the brown sugar needs to be dried first as the extra moisture requires too much torching.  Brown sugar is also a bit too course I find so it needs to be processed in a coffee grinder or  food processor.  I personally found no advantage to using a brown sugar combo, not even for flavor.  I also use vanilla bean paste  in place of the extract for the flecks of bean simply because I prefer it.  This needs to be made in the large, flat ramekins.  The small ones are too deep to yield a consistent pudding, i.e. too runny in the center.  Also, you do not want to get water in your custard so pour the hot water in your baking pan very carefully.

I have made it numerous times. My husband and I love this just  as it comes out of the broiler.  The first day we like it room temperature with nothing added to it.  The second day we eat it plain but cold and the third day is also eaten cold but plain.  We are elderly and don't eat as much as we did when we were younger so I divide it into six servings!  As soon as it is all eaten, my husband wants me to make it again!

Great recipe. Thank you so much. I thought it was super easy. If you don’t have a double boiler. Use a glass bowl an a pot. Easy fix for that. Thanks to google. Yayy I did it.

I made this following the recipe shown, as I didn't see ChefPeon's comment beforehand. The only problem I really found was that the brulees weren't cooked enough at the given temperature, I had mine in the oven for about 45 minutes, give or take. Aside from that, everything turned out great! I used a propane torch to caramelize the sugar on top rather than broiling it, which I advise anyone else to do with caution. I found it very easy to over-burn the sugar with the torch, even being as careful as I could

This is basically soft egg jello. 4 tablespoon of sugar only for that entire size batch of creme brulee? It literally is not sweet at all. Thank god I tasted it instead of trusting that it would be good before bringing it to my boyfriend for his birthday dessert. It's edible...but NOT a dessert. Basically just a giant egg pudding. Not good.

I  also followed chefpone's advice and agree it was perfect !  I made it in one medium sized baking dish --so it had to cook about 40 minutes before it jiggled just right.  Also  I poured a small puddle of Grand Marnier in the each individual dish when serving and then topped with a couple of fresh black berries and it was to die for.....

Good and relatively quick to make.  Will definitely make again but this time will not sneak it out of the fridge early as it was best the next day!

I've made this recipe several times using Chefpeon's review and suggestions. It is so delicious and creamy, I always get rave reviews. I have done it in the oven and it was good, but since getting a sous vide it's the only way I make it now. I double the recipe and fill 12 to14  8oz mason jars evenly. I close finger tight, put them in the water (before the water is heated), heat it to 185 and then cook an hour. I cool about 30 minutes on the counter then put in the fridge and chill until cold throughout (at least 4 hours if possible and overnight better). Before serving I add sugar on top and torch and chill another 5 minutes. So easy and there is enough for us to have dessert for several days!

Absolutely perfect and not nearly as daunting as I'd imagined. I also followed the suggestions of the first reviewer and did not double boil. Creme Brulee is my favorite dessert and I'm so glad to have found a perfect recipe.

I've made this several times now using CHEFPEON's suggestions.  The only area I have run into issues is the sugar layer.  Do NOT use dark brown sugar as it burns way too easily!  Mix the light brown sugar and white sugar until there are no clumps.  Add a thick layer sugar to the custard, shake off the excess so that it has at least a thin coating the whole surface.  Then sprinkle on a just a little more sugar and evenly distributing it with the back of the spoon.  I like to add a strawberry sliced into 8 pieces in a star pattern with a dab of whipped creme in the center.

Okay first off they did not put the fact when adding it to the oven you have to put water till its half way up the dish so that it bakes properly and so it does not come out looking dry and gross like is did in that video. It is a very important step and I have made this before and it was a better over all recipe then this one. I do not think anyone should do this and if you do make sure you do the water step or it will be nasty and basically dry on the top.

One tip i would give anyone is to add more vanilla than the recipe called for this will give it more of that creme brulee flavor.

I made it and my boyfriend absolutely loved it.  However, to me it had a very strong egg yolk taste.  I'd never had creme brulee before,  my boyfriend requested it for Valentine's day.  Is it supposed to have an eggy taste? I nailed the recipe, the texture turned out great.  I googled what it's supposed to taste like,  but didn't read anything about a strong egg presence.

Follow recommendations by CHEFPEON- made things a lot easier.  Used a torch for the crust instead of the broiler.   Definitely will make again.  Next time will use fresh vanilla bean when making the custard for a stronger vanilla flavor profile.

This is a great recipe!  It's the creamiest Creme Brulee I've ever made.  I made it as the recipe instructs.  The only modification I would make for future is to add a bit more vanilla and sugar.  The creme custard was not as flavorful as others that I have tried; seemed a bit bland.  Otherwise it was terrific!!

Well, made this but it would not set after 30 minutes like the recipe said it would. I made it twice. I ended up having to add extra yolks (3) and less cream(2cups). Also double boiler seems unnecessary, as I used the water bath technique to get the custard to set. Next time I would use probably 7 yolks and two cups of cream.

This recipe is easier to get the upscale resturant effect of the crystallized sugar topping if you have a hand held torch. Doing it on the broiler is a little tricky! I got my torch set from Amazon.

Easy recipe and came out wonderful.  In place of the vanilla extract I used a little over 2" worth of vanilla bean.  I added the vanilla bean seeds to the sauce pan with the cream to help better disperse the seeds and get the flavor infused.  The resulting custard had the perfect amount of vanilla flavor.

This is a wonderful tasting dessert. I used all the ingredients  in recipe. Made 4 servings. But. I followed Chef Peon's instructions. I baked it at 375 for 35-40 min. Reason it was so long it's because of altitude I live in. So, to fair, I couldn't give 5 stars. I didn't use the second heating, as Chef Peon said it wasn't necessary. I did t use oven I used a torch. Anyway. I enjoyed this dessert. Hope you give it a try

Oh. Muh. Gawd. This was AMAZING. I have never, I mean never, tasted a desert so perfectly rich and creamy and mmmmm. I made this as one of the deserts for my husband's father's day present from me (a 5 course meal). He had crème brulee one time in his life and has been bugging me for years to make him some. He was NOT disappointed...nor was I. As far as the ingredients go, I followed them to a T. The only thing I changed was during the broiling process. After reading reviews, I too put my ramekins in a tray filled with ice during the broiling of the sugar. It turned out PERFECT. I will be making this, I'm sure, over and over again because YUMMMMMY!!!!!!!!

This is a really good base, I have yet to try Cheffepon's recommendation cause the double boiler method did seem a little extra.

I made this with the recipient posted in the reviews and despite not knowing how to use a blowtorch, it turned out really well. Next time I think that I will add some almond flavor just to give it another level of taste, but this creme brûlée was a success!

I'm only giving 3 stars for now.  Only made once and had a good flavor but not texture.  I've never made creme brulee before it may have been user error.  Definitely worth trying again.

I made this for Valentines Day dinner.  I always assumed that this recipe would be very complicated so never tried before although I love to order it at restaurants!  So happily surprised to find it super simple to make!  And very yummy with that great texture that I love.  I used chefpeon 's review and that made it even easier.  THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE!!

This was the easiest creme brûlée recipe I've used. It came out perfect! The only thing I would add is a tiny touch of salt. I did bake this in a water bath as well.

One of my all time favorites and a very simple recipe.  I do recommend reducing the amount of brown and white sugar used on the top as the recommended amount was much too thick.

Use the suggestions from Chefpon - completely omitted the double broiler step and tempered the eggs with the cream so they didn't scramble. I used a torch, and didn't re-chill in the fridge and they came out perfect!

Divine! This is definitely a dessert to impress. But the fact that it's so simple can be your little secret. It's perfect for entertaining since you could make it in advance and allow to just chill out in the fridge. Then brulee the top in front of your guests for a dramatic finish. The texture was so smooth and creamy. And it's so fun to break through the top to the luscious custard below. This was my first time making creme brulee - I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I baked the custard in ramekins in a hot water bath. Each dish turned out perfectly and I will definitely be making these again!

The best creme brulee recipe EVER. Easy and divine. A Michelin rated restaurant would be proud to serve from this recipe. Creme was smooth as silk. I skimmed off the frothy bubbles from mixing. I didn't over-mix the creme, to reduce the froth and it turned out fabulous. I didn't use the double boiler step. It isn't necessary. I caramelized the sugar crust using white sugar and a blow torch. Awesome awesome awesome. A definite keeper.

My Creme Brûlée came out far too liquid, and I followed all the necessary steps. Otherwise, the taste was great. Also, I think the way they suggest to top it with sugar could be done more easily  by using a torch. The suggested way would over cook it. Furthermore, the oven temperature had to be raised. A few problems, but otherwise it was good.

I made this recipe couple of days ago. Followed the Cheppeon method. It came watery. Taste was ok.  I used Half & Half milk instant of heavy cream. Is this the problem that my dessert went wrong. In Canada, I cannot buy the heavy cream in grocery store.

I made this for dessert on my 10th anniversary. My wife is somewhat of a conneseur of creme brulee, and in her opinion this was the best she has tasted. Thank you for the excellent recipe! I will definitely be making it again!

The only changes I made to the recipe were to add a drop of mint and cooking it in ramekins in a deep dish with water halfway up the sides of the ramekins.  It turned out really great!  

Next time, I want to try adding a different flavor to it, like maybe Amaretto, to try that!  I've heard good things about adding Amaretto to creme brulee.

I really like it and I would give this 4.5 stars if I could.  When I have creme brulee in one of the restaurants I go to, it takes just a little bit better.  I am not sure if I need to up the vanilla or if there is a missing ingredient.

Soooo Good!
Never had this at a restaurant before, but my dad talked about how much he loves creme brulee, so I decided to try it. My whole family is hooked now. these are so creamy and good with the crunchy layer on top. wow!! just heavenly
keep a close eye when browning tops as they go from crunchy to burned in a matter of seconds.

Good recipe.
I made this with the suggestion from Chefpeon's review. I also have a propane tourch which makes the final process alot easier.
I don't use a double boiler for custard anyway, if you are careful you can get the same results using the stove hotplate on a very low heat.

LOVE the custard in this creme brulee recipe. It may even be better than most creme brulees served in restaurants. This is definitely a keeper!

I followed chefpeon's recommendations as well but instead of white sugar I use Caster Sugar and instead of the brown/white sugar mix for the topping I use Demerara Sugar only. I've done both, broil and torch, both work. However, using a torch gives me the excuse to say "Today on Iron chef!" to bug my wife. On a side note you can add some fruit spheres made with a sodium alginate bath to add to the desert if you wanna get experimental with it.

I'm a huge fan of Crème Brulee and this recipe is one of the best out there.  I was a bit skeptical because past versions I tried always used a hot water bath when cooking but this one came out just as good.  Simple, easy, and delicious!

I also followed chefpeon's recommendations. It is pretty simple and easy to make. The outcome was a smooth, creamy decedent dessert, but I would love for it to have more flavor. Next time I am going to add a tiny bit more vanilla and add some lavender flowers to the milk while it heats up, and strain the cream before mixing with the eggs.

A little eggy for me.  Had a little difficult time whipping the custard in the double broiler, took a while to thincken about ten mins and high heat.  I may have to attempt again. Still good, may need more sugar. :)

I made this for Christmas, everyone loved it. I did follow Chefpoen directions, I also tried yellow sugar from the bulk barn which worked even better then the brown and white sugar mixed together. This will be a must keep recipe, I will be making it again real soon.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned into this egg yolk egg cream thing that was thousands of taste buds away from the beautiful custard of a crème burlee but don't get me wrong the taste was still okay but not amazing

Loved it!  I did use the changes suggested by CHEFPEON and the custard was delectably smooth and rich.  Both times I have made this the sugar crust was the hardest part.  Broiling is just not the same as the torch but I don't have one.  Keep the sugar coat thin, make sure the broiler is fully pre-heated and try to leave in for only 2-3 min.  I had to leave it longer so the custard was a little warm but still yummy!

This recipe was very, very easy...and delicious. I will say that though the photo is of small side ramikins , this recipe is designed to be made in larger 4oz custard cups. I added fresh raspberries to the top and it was truly amazing! Also, the custard will hold in the fridge overnight. I had extra since I initially made it in the small cups and then had to turn up the temp on the oven for dinner with guests. The next day I risked making the leftover mix in my larger cups and it not only worked well, but the leftover baked custard (minus the sugar topping I did right before I ate them) held very well for three days (we ate it all by then!). I did find that even in the small ramikins ittooktwicethe baking timers get them done and they were perfect...not overlooked at all.

My boyfriend liked that this wasn't too sweet but i didnt like the texture. Maybe that was my fault but it wasn't as smooth as it was suppose to be but having been my first time making creme brulee, that might not be the recipes fault.

As did many others, I used Chefpeon's modifications.  I believe this ia why it came out so smooth and light.  Did have trouble with the brown sugar lumps actually burning (flaming and had to blow them out periodically) as I was torching the sugar mixture.  Probably just use white sugar only next time.   But everyone loved this creme brulee recipe!

YUM! My guests wanted to lick their bowls! I did use suggestions by chefpeon, didn't cook it before putting in oven. Once yolks and cream came together I sieved back into the bowl. Came out smooth and creamy. Took 30 min at 350. Highly recoment this and will ake it again and again. Thanks for sharing an easy and delicious recipe.

WOW...  Eggsilent.  First time making or trying Creme Brulee, won't be the last.  Very easy to make and I followed CHEFPEON's recommendations except I didn't strain the foam.  It wasn't very thick and the strainer I had didn't catch much.  In any case it turned out perfect.  Crunchy and creamy.

a great hit at our xmas party!  i always thought that creme brulee was hard to make, but this wasn't!  only thing i will say is that make sure you lay enough brown sugar on top afterwards, (right before you broil) so u get a nice crunchy layer on top afterwards..  i didn't put enough...

Excellent dessert!  I followed the chef's review and simplified the recipe.  I've made for several small dinner parties - great to prep before the guests arrive and pop in the oven, broil and serve while coffee is brewing!

I made this for my husband's birthday (it's his favorite) and I received rave reviews from him and our guests.  I gave it some added flare by sprinkling a little 151 on each creme brulee and served them flaming. I gave it 4 stars because the cooking instructions were confusig for my first time cooking creme brulee.  I instead followed the video on this website and added a 1/2 tsp more of vanilla extract.  The flavor was great.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was DELICIOUS! I gave it 4/5 starts because i didnt follow what was typed here, i modified it fitting Chef Peon's way. This video summed up Chef Peon's modifications: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_16ZZtTH_Y  . I used 5 egg yolks (because i didnt have another one) and only used about 2.25 cups of heavy cream. i did use a full teaspoon of pure vanilla extract, i think that was very important to the taste. 
Also, i dont have a torch so i set my oven to 'broil' and put the cream brulee dish on the topmost rack. it did heat the custard, unfortunately, so i had to wait a little while to let it cool down, then i ate it. also, i didnt leave it in too long because i didnt want the sugar to burn too much and i knew the custard would still become warm. either way, i did like the custard, even if it was warm. enjoyy!

just curious - has anyone ever tried using coconut milk as a substitute for the cream? I use vanilla beans scraped and caramelize pineapple and toast coconut over mine sometimes and I just wonder how taste and texture might be effected.

Made this recipe for 20 people and served it at a  Valentines Day party and it turned out perfectly!  I followed chefpeon directions and it was fool proof.  I used Turbinado sugar on the tops and it made a wonderful crystalized top. I then drizzled a raspberry glaze over the top which made for a wonderful presentation.  This recipe is definetly a keeper!

This came out great! I ended up running out of creme so i only used a little less than 2 cups, i'm sure it would have had a more creme flavor to it but everyone still loved it. I did have a little trouble with crisping the top the brown sugar and regular sugar it kept burning so i just used regular sugar, and it came out great. I also cooked it for an additional 5-10 minutes. I also left it overnight in the fridge so it was really cold and the crisp sugar on top was just wonderful.

When my mom and I eat out and creme brulee is on the dessert menu, we always order it.  I wanted to make this for her when she came to visit me this summer.  It was a huge hit!  The ingredients are perfect, just as Chefpeon says.  She really knows her stuff.  I followed her cooking instructions rather than the recipe's, and these were flawless.  I bought a torch and creme brulee set on Amazon. com because I plan to make this my go-to company dessert:)

NEEDS MORE EGG YOLK!!!  Cooked for well over an hour now and no consistency yet.  I've made creme brulee countless times over the years.  I couldn't find my old cookbook so I tried this recipe and am very disappointed.

This was a hit!!!  Followed CHEFPEON's advice except I didn't remove the froth.  Didn't seem to matter to us because the sugar helped cover that up and it still tasted fabulous. Only had 2 cups of cream so used only 5 yolks.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I followed the directions of the pastry chef reviewer and it was delicious.  I do think there must be an art to making creme brulee, though.  Mine was on the verge of being the wrong consistency.  It was easier than I thought to prepare.  It's a keeper...

Tried it - It tasted very eggy, no vanilla flavor came through.  I think the proportion of egg to creme is wrong, there's no direction of baking in a water bath and the combined sugar mixture would not melt consistently.

Can I give this more than 5 stars? I've never made it before, just finished it as a waitress. (Love torching the top!) It was a fairly simple process, just long! Good thing it is totally worth it! Do watch it closely though, I burned the top of one of mine but it still tasted yummy! My 11 year old son is begging for it again!

Tastes great! I followed Chefpeon's suggestions. Turned out perfect aside from not sprinkeling enough sugar on before putting under broiler. Easy fix! I've made this 3 times so far this year!

This was my first time making creme brulee, I have had it many times at some top resturants in the US. I thought the texture came out perfect but it wasn't too sweet and I had a little trouble with the glaze, either way it's a working progress for me, thank you for the recipe.

It was the first time I ever made it, and some of them were kind of soupy, but i feel pretty sure that if I made them again I would be able to perfect them. It's a great and easy recipe

So good! Add extract to it to make it a lemon or raspberry brulee and then garnish finsihed product with curled lemon peel or fresh raspberries. Also, I followed Chefpeon's directions for preparing the recipe.

I was a little nervous about serving this to guests since I've never tried it before.  I made this as well as an out of the box Dr. Oetker Classic Creme Brulee so that I can compare the two.  I used a torch.  

The combination of the brown sugar and white sugar from this recipe burned unevenly and too quickly.  The sugar from the packet were larger sugar crystals and turned out much nicer once torched.  Next time I'm going to try turbinado sugar (sugar in the raw) to see if I can get the same results.

Followed chefpeon's cooking instructions and original recipe's ingredients.  Turned out PERFECT!  Like many people said, just like the ones you get at pricey restuarants for $13 a pop.  Smooth custard texture and crispy carmelized sugar.  I transferred the ramekins onto a cookie pan and put them in the fridge for 10 minutes before putting them in the broiler.  The broiler was on high and I placed these in the middle rack for exactly 2 minutes.  Yummy!

CANNOT believe creme brulee is this easy. Used a torch but top was not crispy enough so next time I'll try the broiler.

Mmmm Mmmm! Oh man this was good! I made this because I had some egg yolks I needed to use up and Im glad I did! The only changes I made were that I halved the recipe and I followed Chefpeons suggestions. Turned out perfect! I ate it all by myself...well, I shared with my 2 year old...

This is really good!  I followed chef peons advice.  My husband and I had creme brulee in Vegas but I think this version was way better!

I made this and it looked perfect.  Following CHEFPEON's instructions, the custard's thickness was nice and the top crusted perfectly with sugar when placed in an ice bath under the broiler.  However, the flavor was mediocre at best and definately lacked sweetness and vanilla.  I will not be making this again.

Worked the first time. As others have said, use the Chef's recommendations for cooking technique. I thought I had overcooked (not much wobble when I took it out of the oven), but after cooling consistency was great!

This is not a bad recipe but make sure to follow CHEFPEON recommendations and you'll get your self a great creme brulee. By it self without CHEFPEON changes you will not get a good quality creme brulee.

Using the pastry chefs helpful hints, I made this recipe which came out fantastic!  I used the propane torch for the WOW factor at my dinner party!  Will make it again because it is so easy!

This was ok, but could have been better. The flavour was right on, but I think the execution could be improved. Maybe next time I will follow the reviewer below me, CHEFPEON, they seam to have it set up the way I've seen it done before. I would give it a B-.

This was my second attempt at creme brulee and I went by Chefpeon's recommendations and it was wonderful!  I loved that we could skip the double broiler.  I will treasure this recipe!

Yummy!  As per the suggestions of others, I followed the prep advice given by the pastry chef, but please note if you change the proportions (I doubled the recipe) the program doesn't adjust the amounts in the preparation instructions -I ended up only using 1/2 the sugar because of this.  Oops.  But it was still good, just thought I'd mention it so others could avoid this error.  Enjoy!
