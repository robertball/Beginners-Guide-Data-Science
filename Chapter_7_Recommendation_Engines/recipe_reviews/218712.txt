I thought this was really delicious with a couple additions.  Another review said it needed some spice so I added 3 minced garlic cloves when the onion were almost done cooking.  I also added a T. or so fresh parsley, salt (not 1 & 1/2 t.) and pepper to taste. I would probably make this again.

It was very delicous. The only thing I added was 4 cloves of garlic and I used regular white rice.

I could not bring myself to use a whole 3# bag of sweet onions for just my boyfriend and I, so I just used about half (4 large onions). I reduced the salt for fear that 1 1/2 tsps. would make it too salty. The half and half combined with the swiss cheese made for a fluffy, almost egg-like texture that I liked quite a bit. But, I found the casserole almost too sweet. The other ingredients were not savory enough to contrast the sweetness. Perhaps cooking the rice in a chicken broth and adding spices might help with that.

Recipe Group Selection:  23, March 13 ~ Loved it!  Do I think more spices could be added for extra seasoning, absolutely.   I also think more rice could be added to the dish as it seemed to get lost in 3#’s of onions.  But my DH and I did enjoy the simple taste of this dish.  I ran the onions and the Swiss cheese through the food processor to help speed up the process.  This dish makes A LOT if you make the full batch.  My 2 qt. casserole dish must not have been deep enough, as I had run-overs in the oven.  Enough spillage, that I’m thankful for the self-cleaning feature on my oven.  My parents also enjoyed this side dish.  I re-purposed the leftovers into a breakfast casserole that I was making the next night.  It worked great and added delicious flavor to ‘Slow Cooker Western Omelet’ from AR.  Thanks Bobbie for sharing your recipe, I will be making it again.

This recipe was the March 23, 2013 Recipe Group Selection.  I thought this was a nice side dish that complimented the Flat Iron Steak with Balsamic Reduction I had made.  Although I was pleased it didn’t compete with the flavors of the steak, I felt it could have had a little more jazz.  It was just a little too bland for us.

This was good, but couldve been better. It just wasnt creamy enough. we had it with a cauliflower au gratin and mixed together were fabulous. If i do decide to make it again i will make a gravy with the half and half and swiss. Try it, but make a roux with the half&half and some chicken broth/stock and then mix in the swiss then add in the onions and rice-it will be fantastic:)

Made this for Recipe Group...We thought this was very good! After reading the reviews, I decided to add a few things...I sauteed garlic w/ the onion (cooked in butter and a bit of evoo). I also used a mix of swiss, Ballyshannon and parmesan cheeses, which gave this a great flavor. I looked really 'white' while I was mixing everything together, so I threw in some parsley for a little color. This had a really nice flavor, and I would make it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Husband said we could make this again sometime.  Did add some red pepper flakes for flavor.  After in oven, I wished I would have thought to have added mustard powder as I think it would have went well with the swiss cheese flavor.  Served with grilled pork chops and broccoli.

Recipe Group selection 3/23/13.  Sorry, I am late with my reviews.  Having read the consistent comment that this was bland, I made one minor addition.  As I assembled the dish for baking I added a good amount of fresh, coarsly ground black pepper.  Somehow that showcased my (very pricy) sweet Vidalia onions.  We all liked it and will have it again.  Thanks, Bobbie.

I don’t usually comment but this was too good not to. Only modification I made was to amp up the shredded cheese because I’m a cheese fan. So I used closer to three cups. Everything else was perfect. Two of us ate half the pan in one sitting.

This was a huge hit at Easter.  I followed the suggestion to cook with rice with chicken stock and I added some sauteed red and yellow bell pepper for color.    Fabulous.  It was liked a baked - and much less time consuming - rissoto.

This had nice onion flavor. The rice wasn't very noticeable and the swiss flavor wasn't really there.  I used leftover rice so put it in frozen to prevent over cooking. This way baked in 30 minutes.  We didn't care for this as a side dish. I wasn't sure what the texture and rice onion ratio would really end up like when I started this but it seemed like just a big pile of onions. This is probably preference and I thought it might be the case so I made it with chile verde tacos. It was a nice topping for the tacos and I would make it for that use again with a couple of tweaks. Made this for recipe group  3/25/13.

Did a little crying peeling all those onions but it was well worth it.
Made recipe as is. I am thinking I will try it with some sour cream on top as I serve.

Made for recipe group 3/23/13. WE loved this. Made to go with steak and it was a great combo. I cut recipe in 1/2 and it was a perfect amount to only have just a little leftover. I was thinking some nutmeg for the next time but no changes are necessary really.
