These were a hit. I could not find the graham cracker crusts that this called for so I had to make my own. Just a suggestion if you have to make your own crust use foil cup cake liners and not paper because the butter really seeped through and was a little messy.

Oh my! The BEST! Made these tonight for my mom's bday (key lime pie is her favorite), and very very picky about her key lime pie!!! These were a HUGE hit, and I even had requests to make them for upcoming birthdays!! I omitted the lime zest, mainly because I was short of time, but I'm sure its good either way! Highly highly recommend!!! ;)

Very easy, and very tasty! I couldn't find key limes, so I used regular limes, and it still tasted good.

I have made these twice and they are wonderful and so easy! The grated zest is a nice touch. The first time, I made 6 for a small dinner party and halved the recipe. Tonight, I attended a dinner party for 15. Was able to fill 15 shells with the 12 pie recipe amounts. Topped with some raspberries and blueberries and served with mini cream puffs from another recipe on this site and chocolate covered strawberries. Made a very pretty plate with a nice assortment. Was devoured. Thanks for the recipe!

made this for teacher's birthday. The recipe is sweet with the perfect amount of tartness. Make sure you use key lime juice if possible. It makes a big difference!

I had no choice but to use regular limes and the pies were still delicious! Other than the type of lime, I followed the recipe exactly and everyone in my family loved them.

I cut the recipe in half and just made 6. I followed the recipe exactly, and they came out great! If you like your pie super limey, add more lime. I don't like an overpowering lime flavor in my key lime pie, or I feel like it starts to taste fake. This flavor was refreshing and perfect. They don't expand in the oven so go ahead and fill them all the way to the top like it says. I baked them for 6 minutes, cooled slightly, then chilled them. They were ready within an hour of being put into the fridge, but I left them overnight anyway. To fancy them up, I added some lime zest to the top along with a couple lemon balm leaves from my garden. Cute!

I made the recipe as directed, other than substituting Key Limes for Rangpur Limes (a mandarin/lemon fruit).  I used the Keebler mini-crusts from the grocery store and they turned out FANTASTIC!  Even partygoers that do not typically eat dessert had one and ate every bite.  My only wish is that I had a larger tree, since this took up almost all of my ripe fruit.  Couldn't recommend this recipe more!

My Key lime tree is going crazy so l have been squeezing and freezing juice .  I needed a quick dessert for a lunch party and found this wonderful recipe.  Whipped it up in no time and still had enough time to chill them in time for lunch.   Guests loved them!

This turned out great and was super easy. I used lime and it was fine. The sour cream cut down on the tartness. My husband loved it.

A+ I've made key lime pies for a few years.  Wanted to try a new twist... This is it!  Perfect combo, smooth, tangy and so tasty.   I like the sour cream in place of eggs.  My new key lime!

I followed the directions exactly (except I made my own graham cracker crust) and it turned out delicious! It was very easy to make and was a hit with my guest. It is very rich and creamy. I used small key limes I wouldn't recommend that because it took forever to squeeze the juice and it was hard to grate the rind. Which is a must to get the great flavor. Next time I will buy larger key limes. My husband even enjoyed this one and he doesn't like key lime pie. This one is a keeper!

Fabulous! The best I have ever had. I received the same comment from every one I made them for. Didn't change a thing and I think the sour cream is what makes these extra special. Thanks for sharing.

Half recipe made 8 little pies. Great hit!  Will make often.  Rivals the famous key lime made by one of the restaurants here!  Not sure about nutritional content..

Just made these. Halved the recipe just to try it. Used reduced fat condensed milk 14 oz can and light sour cream. Used regular limes. Omg! Omg! Delicious. Tangy with the right amount of sweet. Can't wait to make these for a family get together.

These are the best! Instead of buying the little pie plates I just used a muffin tin. I made my own crust with butter and gram crackers. I ended up having a lot left over and have enough to make mini mini key lime pies!  This is a great recipe and I have already made it multiple times! I highly recommend this recipe!
