Good recipe. Chill mixing bowl and beaters in freezer for 10 minutes before preparing. Also,can experiment with different extracts to get just the right flavor to go with that perfect recipe (rum extract,almond,banana,coconut,maple,coffee)~tried them all :)

Excellent!  I was out of powdered sugar, so used regular sugar instead and it still came out great!  Thanks :)

So simple and easy to make.  Be sure to use a metal bowl.  I usually place mine (with the wisk) in the freezer for five or ten minutes before making the cream.  Delicious!  You'll never buy ready made again!

Perfectly good whipped cream.  An easy way to get your whipped cream to stay fluffy is to bloom 1 tsp of unflavoured gelatin in 1tbsp of water.  Then just add that to your whipped cream when you add the sugar.  It will stay nice and fluffy for days!  No more making whipped cream at the last possible second.

There's nothing like homemade whipped cream! I doubled the amount of confectioners' sugar, but other than that it's a classic recipe that's perfect with pound cake and strawberries (or anything else you can think of).  Definitely make sure your bowl and beater are well chilled and you'll get perfect results every time.  You'll never go back to store bought again......

I made this recipe to put over fresh strawberries. Since a couple of the reviewers said the whipped cream was not sweet enough, I doubled the powdered sugar to 2 tablespoons.  It was delicious!  I will definitely use this as my whipped cream recipe.

This was perfect!It was also very easy.I used an electric hand mixer(low setting) and it took a few minutes to get to the soft peaks stage.I had to add a 1/2 a tbls more confectioners sugar than the recipe called for because it was not sweet enough.I served it with strawberries.I will surely make this again!!!

Needed more whipped topping for holiday pie...this one worked fine! Need to make it a few times to get the texture just right, since I've grown up with Cool Whip. Used Splenda sugar substitute to make it sugar-free.

I've never relly had home-made whipped cream before, so i found this one and it turned out delicious! I make it all the time now and it's verry easy! It comes out the best if you leave the bowl & whisk in the freezer for about 1/2 hour or so. Yummy!

This recipe is delicious, and so easy!! I made this to top a Tiramisu recipe and it really made a nice finishing touch. Add this to any recipe that needs that little something extra.

I had trouble making this at first.  I had frozen my metal mixing bowl & beaters and I even set the bowl on top of a bag of frozen veggies, but all I'd get is bubbles. After much frustration and experimentation I discovered that my bowl was too shallow for the hand-held mixer to really whip the cream.  I transferred the cream to a measuring cup and it whipped up in no time! (Just thought I'd share for anyone else who might have the same trouble.) Anyway, once I got it figured out, it was wonderful whipped cream and easy to make. I think you can add sugar if needed for different desserts, but it is good the way it is for serving with fruit.

SUPER easy! And it really did only take about 5 mins (after chilling the bowl and whisk for 10 mins) We had a "Whipped Cream Bar" for a coworker's birthday... AngelFood Cake and Pound Cake with strawberries and 6 different flavors of whipped cream. They all turned out AMAZING! Here were the flavors I made: (add in amounts are approximate, and can be increased/decreased to control for flavor intensity and texture) Regular - as stated in recipie Strawberry - mixed in about 1/2 cup of sliced and sugared strawberries Banana - add 2 tbs Banana pudding mix Chocolate - add 2 1/2 tbs Chocolate pudding mix Butterscotch - add 2 tbs Butterscotch pudding mix & 4 crushed Werther's hard candies Sweet Almond - add 2 tsp Almond extract and 1 cup slivered almonds The flavors were a HUGE hit ... I got proposed to TWICE because of it! hahahaha!

Tip for those OUT of powdered sugar:  Simply place sugar in a coffee rinder, grind until sugar is a fine powder and VIOLA...you now have powdered sugar.

Easy, delicious, perfect recipe!  (One cup = one small (1/2 pt) carton of heavy whipping cream = topping for one 9" pie. ) I didn't chill my bowl or utensils & the whipped cream still came out perfect. My whipped cream has stayed firm & perfect when kept chilled in the fridge; the reviewer who said theirs turned to liquid, probably didn't whip it long enough.  Be sure to use a good brand of heavy whipping cream, like Land O'Lakes, etc.....Update, I put the heavy whipping cream in the freezer for about 15 minutes before whipping. Chilling the utensils helps, but making sure the whipping cream is good & cold is the most important thing to get it to whip up firmly.

How silly am I?  Well, probably just inexperienced.  I've only been cooking seriously for the last year or so and have never made real whipped cream before.  I bought heavy whipping cream and just naively figured I'd beat the stuff silly and it would be ready to go in a few minutes - just in time to top my French silk pie.  I half-panicked when upon my first taste, I noticed something was obviously wrong. Was the whipping cream sour?  Didn't I whip the stuff long enough?  Hmm.  Oh, yes.  It's not SWEET enough.  Thank you to my favorite recipe site - Allrecipes.com!  In minutes, I found this recipe, modified my whipping cream with vanilla and sugar - and magically - I've got the best desert topping I've ever had.  Allrecipes, thanks for indulging us slow and half-witted neophyte cooks!

So delicious and so easy. I used an electric beater on low speed and whipped the cream for about 5 minutes until thick and then added EXTRA sugar and EXTRA vanilla. About a tablespoon and a half of more sugar and at the LEAST two teaspoons of vanilla, but I could've added more. I then beat all of this with the mixer for about another 5 minutes. Very fluffy and light, PERFECT!!! I put it on the Marbled Pumpkin Cheesecake from this site.

I caution everyone to beat the whipped cream only until combined after adding the vanilla and sugar.  The first attempt I made, I beat the mixture too long and the milk separated from the butter making a globby mess.

Yes, I will also stress the importance of ice cold, metal bowls and whipping tools. I spent many years of "whipped cream" failure and always thought it was a result of the various brands I bought. I learned that cold is the key to success...and keeping it cold! It will melt like ice cream if kept out of the fridge too long.  I still have occasional failures, though. I have always used granulated sugar (Betty Crocker's recipe) I am almost certain now that the granular sugar could cause a separation of the dairy elements & give me a runny result? Cold sugar isnt going to 'melt' like powdered will. Thanks so much for this latest tip!  One other note: I bought a container of Roberts Ultra Pasteurized Heavy Whipping Cream at Target. I then was at a different store and decided to get a bit more (I use it in my mashed potatoes : ) and the dairy section ONLY had Roberts "Fresh Whipping Cream". I looked at the ingredients. "Milk, Cream, ...." So, milk is the main ingredient? I looked at the ingredient list of the plain label heavy ultra pasteurized one right next to it...."Grade A Cream" Period. Nothing else.  hmmm. I bought the plain label one. When I got home, I looked at THAT Roberts' ingredient list..."Cream, mono-something, carageenan." Yuk?? I usually dont buy plain label, but I'm glad I did. I will start reading labels more closely. My point is that the "Whipping Cream" could also cause problems? Make sure your #1 ingredient is CREAM!   ps...I cant wait to try out the new tip!

This wasn't sweet enough and just wasn't right.  My mother made cream a lot when I was younger and I was trying to get it to taste like what I remember.  I played around with it and this is what I came up with.  3/4 c. heavy whipping cream, 2 T. granulated sugar and 1 t. vanilla.  It tasted fantastic! (yields 1-1/2 c. whipped cream)

I had to read all the reviews before I made this, because I always thought the longer u whipped the cream the lighter and fluffier it would become, so not only was this a good recipe the reviews really helped. DO NOT OVERBEAT, oh I did use 2 tbs. sugar.

I used the exact recipe but added 1/2 tbsp of meringue powder to help in the piping and to stabilize it.  For fruits and puddings and such, I use the recipe as directed.  Fabulous taste.

Great Easy recipie. I read this and had it made in 15min.  I did it in my mixer and it turned out perfect. I did add another tbsp of powdered sugar to sweeten it up a litte more just for my taste. I never new it was this easy to have great whipped cream. Make this, you wont be disapointed.

Excellent as is, but here's something we tried.  Instead of a full cup of cream we used 3/4 cup, then 1/4 cup of flavored coffee creamer.  We've used Caramel Mochiatto, French Vanilla, and Irish Cream.  Adds extra flavor, depending on what you're using it to top!  Great!

Easy and delicious. I made this to top our pumpkin pie the night before Thanksgiving and added some Pumpkin Spice and a half cup sugar vs the full cup. I'm not sweets biggest fan.

I made this recipe, and well.. It really wasn't what I expected.. It had a weird after taste, I had to add more sugar.. Easier and cheaper to just buy the real stuff.

Good whipped cream for dipping, but not for frosting. I've made whipped cream for frosting before, and I thought I'd try this recipe out instead of my usual. You don't need a stand mixer for whipped cream. In fact, it's easier to overmix with a stand mixer, use a hand mixer instead. I chill everything, including the metal bowl and the hand mixing appliance, for about 20 to 30 minutes. Used only 1/2 tsp of vanilla, as I wanted the creamy taste in the frosting to come out. Found that there was a difference in using granulated vs. powdered sugar. Despite reading that powdered sugar allowed the frosting to keep it's form after being piped, I found that the whipped cream made with powdered sugar is harder to pipe. It just did not keep the swirls I was aiming for, compared with whipped cream made with granulated sugar. I use a whipped cream frosting on triple chocolate cakes, it gives people a surprise to have the decadent cake and the delicate subtle frosting.

I'm sure why everyone likes to put in so much sugar ; it's probably the number one cause of child obesity and diabetes, which makes me sad.  This recipe is perfect, and I even put a little less sugar; the vanilla or other flavoring is what's important.
In Mexico they have desserts with whipped cream that has no sugar at all, and they taste AMAZING.  Like nothing I've ever had in the U.S..

I love this recipe, and it's so quick I'll never need to get store bought whipped cream (or Cool Whip) again.

I have to double or triple the sugar amount to achieve the desired sweetness; otherwise, a good basic recipe.  It is critical to start with cold beaters and bowl.

This is less sweet than cool whip, like others have said, but you can adjust that easily, as long as you do it near the beginning of the whip. I just wanted to mention for beginners, to really make sure not to over beat. I've never found mine to become like butter, but rather the opposite. If you miss the sweet spot for doneness and over beat, I find that it degrades and won't whip properly, and you end up with a runny result.

I doubled the sugar and it's perfect.  It's a great compliment to my home made key lime pie.  I chill my metal bowl for at least 30 minutes.

Great recipe. I was worried about the vanilla since I was putting the whipped cream on key lime pie, but the flavor was much richer with it. I wound up adding twice the sugar but that's because I like it sweeter. Thanks to those with the advice to chill the bowl and mixer. I even chilled the sugar and it worked great! Will use this as my whipped cream recipe from now on. Thanks Paula!

This is how you do it!  Comes out perfect, I leave it alone.  A little tip if you want to go a bit fancier, if you're serving with fruit, add a tablespoon of whatever fruit juice you have, it puts a hint of something that will make people wonder what is so unique about your whipped cream.  And I find it gets rid of the vanilla "bite" that can sometimes sit in the back of your throat.

Needs a bit more sugar and a little extra vanilla for that added pop of flavor, but aside from that, I love this recipe. I have used it for years now and shall stick to it (making my own adjustments, of course). Super simple too!

I didn't have a metal bowl so I used a glass bowl. I froze it for 20 minutes or so.. I also froze the whisk attachment to my handmixer so it'd be nice and cold.  I also did not use powdered sugar (didn't have any) so I used 2 packets of splenda. It came out really good (not too sweet, but that's okay because I don't like it to be too sweet).   with the electric handmixer it took less than 5 minutes to have PERFECT whipped cream.

This recipe is also excellent if instead of using confectioners' sugar, you substitute in 1 Tbl of Swiss Miss cocoa mix. It makes awesome chocolate whipped cream!

Excellent whipped cream recipe, and super easy.  

The recipe as it is is perfect for a less that supersweet, traditional German Schlage (which I personally prefer to the Reddi -Whip sweetness).  However, for topping on pumpkin pie, I tripled the powdered sugar, and it was just sweet enough.

My two year old son loves it, too - he licked the beaters clean!

This was so great! I served it with strawberry shortcake, and it was the best. A few changes I made, first I chilled the bowl and beaters for about 20 minutes before making the cream and I also doubled the amount of sugar. Also, I didn't bother with the whisk, instead I just used an electric beater. I but it on a low seating first, then increased speed to 'whip'. Turned out great! Remember to refrigerate until you are ready to serve it!!

Not quite sweet enough as is. I used twice as much sugar, next time I'll use even more as I still prefer it a little sweeter. The canned stuff is soooooooooo sweet that I think we become accustomed to whipped cream being sweeter.

Really great consistency. Tip about ice cold bowl and whisk is DEFINITELY to be followed. Perfect amount of vanilla, but next time I make it I'll probably increase the sugar. I don't want it coolwhip sweet, but maybe another half tablespoon would give it the right quality.

I usually just throw in a palmful or so of white sugar rather than messing with the powdered and it works fine. Added some cinnamon to the mix for our pumpkin pie topping.

If you have a whip cream dispenser, this recipe works wonderfully because the confectioners’ sugar dissolves so easily into the cream.  I recommend sifting the confectioners’ sugar before adding it to the cream.  The finished product isn’t very sweet, but we don’t like it overly sweet, so if you want a sweeter cream I’d add additional confectioners’ sugar.

Spot on.  Perfect balance of sugar and vanilla. I don't whip the cream before adding the vanilla and sugar, just dump it in the chilled bowl and beat with chilled beaters.  Whenever I need whipped cream, this is the go-to.

This recipe worked great.  I added a little extra vanilla and some cinnamon for extra flavor.  Used in a Watergate Salad and the crowd went wild!  I also added a little more than double the confectioners sugar.

If you don't have an electric mixer, don't give up! Using a whisk does work, give it time (about 5 minutes) of consistent beating.

So easy and very tasty!  I use this recipe anytime a recipe calls for Cool Whip (yesterday I made a peanut butter pie using this cream instead of Cool Whip and it is amazing).  It's great for strawberries fresh out of the garden.  I change the sugar quantity based on what I'm doing with the cream, but every time it comes out amazing!  Like other reviewers, I recommend sticking your bowl in the freezer for few minutes before mixing.

Ha! 5 minutes my tushy! I whipped, and whipped, and whipped in my chilled bowl and got little more than runny goop. After 20 minutes I pulled out the big guns (power tools) and it STILL didn't thicken. The runniness was delicious though. But still.. long live cool whip!

So funny how everyone's taste is different . . . I grew up with plain whipped cream - no added sugar, no flavors, just pure, delicious cream, which has it's own type of sweetness anyway.  But I was buying some for my kids, and decided I didn't like all the additives in Redi-Whip, so I made this to put on their ice cream.  I knew they'd want it sweet, so I tried this.  But I think it was way too sweet and the vanilla was too strong (and I even used a little less of both than called for).  Even my kids didn't like it that much.  Next time I think I'll cut out the vanilla altogether and cut the sugar in half.  Definitely consider your own personal taste before trying this recipe!

Super good! I was out of conf sugar so I used regular. I did increase to 2 tbls. I put my glass bowl and beaters in the freezer for 15 min. It took a good 7 minutes to come together before I added the sugar and vanilla.

Would have been 5 star if it were sweeter. I used 2 TBLS powdered sugar but wish I used 3. Very good whipped cream, I made this by hand, and now my arm is sore. Worth it. (Try adding in a little bit of cocoa powder!)

i will never get store-bought whipped cream again! i made this recently for the first time and had it not been for the fact that it was needed for my dessert for company, i would have eaten the entire bowl! i did follow some of the comments, chilling the bowl and beater, adding more sugar (i did about 2 tbsp) and adding a little vanilla extract. i'm making it again for tonight (game night with the parents) and will be adding some almond extract to top my almond-raspberry sponge cake. thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

The first time, I overbeat it by accident. The second time, it came out perfectly because I just put all the ingredients in at once, so I was able to jjust beat it once. Deeeelicious! I used it on a chocolate cream pie and a sweet potato pie.

I doubled the recipe, but found it wasn't sweet enough, so I added an additional Tbsp of 10x and it's just right for over sweet strawberries.  My bowl and beater weren't chilled, but it worked just fine that I can tell.

With the price of heavy cream, I very nearly bought a can of aerosol whipped cream but decided to go this route to avoid chemicals and preservatives.  I'm glad I did.

Always works! TIP: Stick the whipping cream in the frig with the beater and bowl for 15 minutes before you are ready.....whips up faster and taller.

A classic whipped cream recipe! I added a little more confectioner’s sugar,maybe ½ T, personal preference. I chilled my bowl and beaters about an hour before mixing everything together. The whipped cream was done in mere minutes. I used this to top,” Pumpkin Crunch Cake,” from Nora Lacroix, and also from this site. Simple, easy and delicious!

This is a pretty classic recipe but I liked using powdered sugar! It make everything all the more creamy. I made this and added some raspberry schnapps. It was fabulous on hot chocolate and my husband wanted to eat the whole bowl.

Worked perfectly for me. I used my electric hand mixer and I had to mix for a few minutes until the peaks began to form. I am using this to top my Simple Strawberry Smoothie recipe. I also make this to top off my homemade chai tea lattes at home. You can't go wrong here, it is very simple.

Perfect and easy.  It's a quick and easy way to make any dessert fabulous.  I use it frequently with strawberries and store-bought angel food cake for a dessert that is simple & elegant and everyone loves it.  You can use this to take any dessert up a notch without spending all afternoon in the kitchen.

I like this recipe, but since I've always used cool whip, I'm used to a sweeter whipped cream so I found myself adding additional confectioners after a taste test. I wasn't measuring, but I think I probably ended up doubling the confectioners for a pretty darn sweet whipped cream. Good recipe

For some reason I get a kick out of watching liquid transform into an edible cloud.  I love whipped cream and will eat it on just about any dessert.  This was very basic and simple but the measurements for this were just right.  I prefer using confectioners sugar to regular white...I guess it makes the cream seem lighter.  Thanks Paula.

Very easy and fast!  I added a bit more sugar since I have a sweet tooth.  But just add a little at a time and taste in between until you get it just right.  I will use this as my whipped cream recipe.

I made the recipe as described and really I would add a tid bit extra sugar but really is not needed. The outcome was EXCELLENT! I followed some suggestions for using the bowl and beaters cold. I put the beaters in the freezer until they had some frost on it and put the bowl in the fridge....man this came out just perfectly. My recommendation if using this to top cupcakes then also to put the featherweight bag and decorators tip in the fridge too. Will help keeping the consistency while keeping your hands from heating the whipped cream too much!

Wow, growing up we always used regular sugar in our whipping cream, so tonight I tried it with confectioners sugar (powdered sugar) it tasted the same to me. I love real whipped cream... You can't beat the REAL stuff! No pund intended!  haha

I increased the powdered sugar to just under 1/3 of a cup. I used my magic bullet to whip it thought. It was done in under 2 minutes. So fresh, creamy and delicious, no more cool whip for us,ever! There's no reason!

Perfect sweetness and the instructions were great to put the bowl & whip into the freezer.  I used my KA and it was done in about 3-4 minutes.  Perfect for my sweet potato pie and chocolate chess pie!

I doubled the sugar and it was gross. It's way too much vanilla extract . I made it again, with only a few drops of vanilla extract and it was delicious!

.thank you  Paula    5star. Recipe. Perfect whipped cream  for the top of my chocolate cream pie.  I added more powdered sugar and vanilla. Easy. Recipe.  Will never. Buy store bought again. This took about five minutes in my kitchen aid. Start whipping slow  then increase speed.  Watch closely.  I added more powdered sugar for a sweeter taste. Enjoy

Very quick, simple and good!  For easy whipping -  Make sure your bowl is metal, totally free of any oil.  I wipe the bowl with a paper towel then put the bowl and the beaters (for mixer) into the freezer for 1/2 hr or so.  Make sure the heavy whipping cream is chilled.  Start mixing on low then increase the spead.Whip till peaks are forming then add the vanilla and powdered sugar.  I added 2 T of Powdered Sugar. You can also experiment with other flavorings, a bit of peppermint is good! Keep it covered in the fridge till you need it.  Enjoy!

This was good.  Made it the first time as is. My family didn't think it had any flavor. Made it again but with 3 tsp vanilla and 3 Tbls confectioners sugar. They liked it much better.  I chilled the bowl and beaters both times.  I don't know how people are using just a hand whisk. That would take forever.  I used my electric  hand mixer.  It took several minutes to firm up but it worked great and turned out well!

I used 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and it was delicious! I SLOWLY increased the speed of the mixer as it thickened. It took a long time for the stiffness to form, but it is well worth it. The sugar had complete dissolved and was well dispersed through out the whipped cream! Fabulous!

While this is a great basic recipe for whipped cream I don't think it's sweet enough.  Double up on the sugar and definitely put your metal bowl and whisk in the freezer before using.

This is an AMAZING recipe for a creamy, sweet whipped topping! I do not own a hand mixer, so I experimented by making this in my blender (sounds silly, I know). It came out great! Think, smooth, creamy, and sweet, and it only took about 60 seconds (I used the "pulse" feature). I added two tablespoons of sugar and only a tiny splash of vanilla, and found myself licking the spatula after I spread this on a sponge cake! If you use a blender like I did, keep in mind that you will lose a bit of whipped cream because it'll be hard to get out out from under and around the blades. Great recipe!

Fabulously simple!  I did place my bowl and whisk in the freezer for at least 30 minutes before I started.  I added another tablespoon of confectioners' sugar as well.

I spread it on a Lemon Sponge pie......OMG!  You must try.  I must admit you might have to adjust the amount of sugar though; add more.

I had some heavy craem in the fridge and decided to make some whipped cream as a cookie cake topper. Loved it it was so thick and creamy. I did not use powdered sugar used 3 1/2 tablespoons of sugar. Can't wait to serve with strawberries.

Sorry this recipe turned out really runny. I am sure if I would have added more powdered sugar that it might have been a more appropriate texture. Also, I doubled the recipe and added it all together at once but I think it should still have turned out better.

I used it as a whipped cream frosting for my angel cake.  Like user "jody1," I left the mixer bowl and beaters in the freezer for at least 10 minutes until I was ready to make the whipped cream.

I beat it on high until it thickened, plus doubled up on both the sugar and vanilla extract and it was still mildly sweet.  I used regular cane sugar since I didn't have any powdered sugar on hand and it still turned out delicious.

We saw some heavy whipping cream in our fridge, so I decided to make whipped cream because I was bored. I had no idea how to make it, so I poured the rest of the cream into a bowl, and started mixing it with an electric mixer. I added a little bit of regular white sugar, and it didn't turn out so well. It was just missing something. So I went online and found a basic recipe, and found this one. Afterwards, it turned out great, for a simple whipped cream!

It was good right when I made it. Not sure If I whipped it enough or not but still tasted good. HOw do I store this, after a day in the fridge it had gotten way too liquidy and lost any stiffness to it.

Delicious whipped cream recipe, use granulated or powdered sugar for equal results. Best made the day you are going to use as it has a short shelf life. The cream starts to separate in a day or so. Also use the advice of the author and use a refrigerated bowl to help your results turn out as desired.

This is a good recipe but I believe it needs double the powdered sugar. It whips up quickly using a metal bowl and beaters placed in the freezer for 10 minutes or so before using.

There's nothing better than real whipped cream! I've referenced this recipe several times now. I like it sweeter, so I do add more sugar.

Very good and easy.  I made sure that my bowl was cold.  I just wish I'd read the other reviews who suggested doubling the sugar, as I think it could've used more sweetness.

Good base recipe.  I used 3 heaping tbsp sugar and added about 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon.  Made enough to conservatively fill and top an 8" round cake.

Good recipe. I added more sugar as it wasnt sweet enough for me. Note: It does not hold well- serve immediately. It started to get liquid-y after only 30min in the fridge.

Great basic whipped cream recipe.  I made it as stated and then added in more vanilla and more sugar for a stronger sweetness.  I think doubled both the sugar and the vanilla.  It was very simple to make in a large mixer, I just set it on high and watched whipped cream appear.  Be very careful not to let this whip past the "whipped cream" consistency though, as it can happen very quickly.

Instead of using sugar and vanilla, I used a packet of Sugar Free Instant pudding. My family especially loves the Cheesecake pudding. It makes a great frosting for cakes.

This is how I make my whipped cream. Sometimes I don't even add the powdered sugar or vanilla, because I think whipping cream has its own sweetness. I taught a friend to make this who only used cool-whip, and she couldn't quit making it. This is the real thing. Just don't over whip the cream, because it will move from whipped cream to butter. Although, homemade butter is also very good!

Wow, I couldnt believe a recipe was really needed for this...but then again I grew up with real whipped cream,  not the store  or especially not cool whip. LOL  I use more sugar, and I use regular sugar just like gram and mom did..I use about 3-4 tablespoons.  Chill your bowl and beaters in the freezer before whipping...can be any type of bowl, I have used plastic more then metal.

Wonderful!  I used a cold metal bowl and beaters and still had to whip a good 15 minutes but it turned out perfect.  I did triple the sugar as I wanted it a bit sweeter.

great recipe but was not sweet enough. I added a tbsp and half more and it was perfect! I used my magic bullet with the flat blade. It was a whole lot easier then using a hand mixer. I didn't need to make sure the bowl or mixing blading were cold. Just popped everything in the cup, attached blade and it was done in 30 seconds!

Great recipe!  Made this in a pinch 'cause I didn't realize I was out of butter for our waffles and needed SOMETHING to go with the syrup, of course.  :)  Didn't have powdered sugar on-hand, so I used 10-12 drops of Stevia concentrate instead.   Spread whipped cream across the waffles and sprinkled with blueberries.  OMG....breakfast never tasted so good!!!

I'm giving this 4 stars because it definitely needed more than 1TB. of sugar in my opinion but of course I'm a "cool whip" gal. I used about 4TB. and I had clear vanilla on hand so I used 1 1/2 tsp. of that. I didn't chill the beaters or bowl basically because I forgot but it still worked. I'll use this recipe from now on instead of buying whipped topping from the store.

I forgot to buy canned whipped cream at the store to make ice cream sundaes and had heavy cream on hand, so I gave this a try. This was my first time ever to make my own whipped cream. I never knew it was so easy, and so much better tasting too. The next time though I will add even more sugar (I doubled it as it was) and used superfine granulated instead of powdered. Both my husband and I thought it needed to be sweeter. I used a hand mixer and wished I had a stand one since it took several minutes of whipping on high to go from liquid froth to actual stiff cream. This would be a fun "science" project for home schooled kids as well. Thanks, it was very good and I'm using this again!

Very easy to make, didn't take anymore than 10min...definitely needs at least 3T of sugar. I beat it extra stiff & scooped it into a sandwich bag to pipe onto a cheesecake.

Very easy & versatile recipe. Have used fresh & frozen blueberries, canned cherries, and fresh peaches/nectarines. Baking one now with blackberries. Always add 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter.

I just finished making this whipped cream. As written, I give it four stars. It's good but, as many others have said, it's just not sweet enough. Given that I read many of the reviews prior to making this, I increased the powdered sugar to 3 Tbs right away. I tasted just a bit as I was waiting for the stiff peaks to form and it still wasn't sweet enough for me. I sifted a bit more powdered sugar into it and...it is Sooooo YUMMY!!!!!! I haven't yet tried it on my Chocolate Cream Pie but I couldn't help eating what was left in the bowl :) It made way more than I needed for my one chocolate pie but that's ok...I can take care of the leftovers ;) Absolutely 5 stars with extra sugar!!! Oh, and I stuck my bowl and whisk attachment in the freezer for about 20 minutes before beating. :)

Why 3 stars? Needs more sugar. Nasty without it. As others said, it just isn't enough. I did about 1/3 cup and it was significantly better. I forgot to chill the bowl ahead of time but it turned out just fine.

When I made this, it didn't fluff up very much, so I added a few tbsp sour cream and PERFECT! Very good. I probably made some sort of mistake, but the sour cream saved the day... so if yours falls flat, that's a good option for ya!

Quick and easy.  I use this instead of buying whipped cream now.  I found it tastes better when I use regular whipping cream (as opposed to heaving whipping cream) and 2 tbsp of powdered sugar.  I also took the advice from others to put my bowl and beaters in the freezer for a bit before use.  Makes a big difference!

Delicious and very easy to make!  Way better than the ready made kind.  Be sure to use a metal bowl and place in the freezer for ten minutes before making the whipped cream. I can't wait to experiment with different flavor extracts and different amounts of sugar.

So good! I doubled the vanilla because we buy imitation. Next time hopefully we'll get the real stuff; if not, I'll use clear because this batch came out a little golden. I might leave out the sugar next time too! Nothing beats homemade whipped cream. Nothing.

This was quite good but we ended up adding 1 additional table spoon of confectioner's sugar to the mix. Also, we used Real Vanilla Extract and it was not very "vanilla-y" at all. As suggested we used a metal mixing bowl and put it in the freezer. While mixing we had it on top of frozen veggies. Also, initially we used a wisk and my boyfriend and I relayed back and forth when our arms were tired. Eventually we realized we could use a hand mixer and it came together very quickly. Use the hand mixer if you have one...unless you just want a pre-desert work out.

You KNOW it's good when the guys eating it are asking how you made it.  Rave reviews everytime!  I grew up making is with regular sugar but the powder sugar and vanilla truly make it.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a great whipped cream recipe, though I agree that it does need at least two more teaspoons of sugar.  

I made it a coffee cream by adding three teaspons of instant coffee to it before whipping.  Excellent!

Great recipe! I used this to top off my Old Fashioned Coconut Cream Pie and it tasted awesome! I reallly wouldn't add any extra sugar like other reviewers suggested; it has a natural, not too sweet flavour.

This was quick, easy, and turned out perfectly. It's not too sweet, but you can easily add more powdered sugar if you'd like.

This was much easier than I expected.  I placed my wisk and metal bowl in the freezer for 30 minutes and then before I knew it we were eating fresh whipped cream.  I also added an extra tablespoon of sugar to make it sweet enough for our liking.

I will never buy ready made whipped cream agan!

1. I chilled my large pyrex measuring cup and beater ahead of time in freezer ~ maybe 30 minutes before 
2.  15 min before I was ready to prepare, I moved my heavy cream to freezer to get it extra chilled
3.  Prepared 1 tsp unflavored gelatin with 1 tsp water, set aside
4. Whip as directed in recipe!
5.  At sugar step, I doubled the amount of sugar and added the vanilla and gelatin
6.  Complete as instructed!!

Yum!! I experiment with different flavors, lemon, chocolate, almond, mint... this is so fun and quick, I will never buy it ready made again!

It was really pain in the butt to make wipped cream with a mixer. My shoulder hunted so much! I would say you need an electric mixer to make wipped cream.. Also I doubled the sugar after reading the previous comments saying that the cream wasn't sweet enough.

Tried to make this and realized I was out of vanilla! After moping around the kitchen for a minute, I decided to squirt in some Hershey's chocolate syrup instead. I omitted the sugar because the syrup has plenty. Since my bowl was plastic, it didn't stay cold which made this take about 10 minutes of heavy beating (which sucked, because I don't have an electric mixer).

Anyway, after ALL that, this turned out delicious!

DELICIOUS!!! I followed the change of 1/4 sour cream to 3/4 cup heavy cream.  I used granulated sugar (mostly bc I forgot I was supposed to use confectioner's). This has turned out me several times... never chilled bowls or beaters... never had any precise measurements.  This recipe is my go-to for any recipe that needs whipped cream.  For the comment about this not comparing to the store bought brands. I couldn't DISAGREE with you more. I will NEVER buy a pack of powder or frozen tub again.

I made a coffee flavored whipped cream. Simply add finely ground coffee to the cream and allow to sit in the fridge over night. It'll make a kind of iced coffee almost. Then simply follow the recipe listed. It's delicious.

I'll never buy store bought whipped cream again. This recipe is waaay too good. I love that you can play around and adjust it to your needs. Freezing your bowl and beaters makes this very easy to whip up. :)

I'm low carbing and my sweet cravings are killing me! I used stevia instead of sugar and sugar free vanilla. This turned out amazing! Even the kids loved it! This is a game changer and will definitely help cub my cravings. From one whipped cream lover-I'll never buy it again. I'm an official fan.

Awesome! Perfect to top a chocolate cream pie. I did add more powdered sugar to taste and making 1 1/2 recipe gives enough for heaping cream pie. I tried dissolving gelatin and adding to keep cream firm, but didn't work out well. The bloomed gelatin doesn't dissolve in the cream so it was just little pieces of gelatin throughout the cream.

Delicious and super easy.  I put my stand mixer bowl and whisk in the freezer for about 20 minutes.  I halved the recipe and it only took about 3 minutes.  I did add twice the sugar per other reviewers.

Only had regular sugar. Think confectioner sugar would've made it lighter. Worried about over-beating so I think I could've beat longer.

So easy to make, and tasted great. I chilled my bowl and beaters in the freezer for a few minutes before making the whipped cream, and the only change I made was using 2 Tablespoons of powdered sugar instead of just one to make it a bit sweeter. Will make this again!

This is an awesome and easy recipe! I did double the sugar and a tip if you have it, I used a teaspoon of meringue powder!

Perfect. Liked the amount of sweetness.  I learned that I need to whip on highest setting. Yum!

Absolutely delicious! I overwhipped mine, but it was still very good. If you like your whipped topping sweeter you can always add more sugar.

This is 100 times better than store-bought whipped cream! When I baked a meal for a family that was struggling with sickness, I topped the dessert with this whipped cream. They couldn't stop raving about "that amazing cream"! DON'T EVER BUY THE ARTIFICIAL KIND AGAIN!

Awesome. I made it with my 11 YO son. I didn't have a metal bowl, so I froze a ceramic one with the beaters for a hand held electric mixer. Added 2 tablespoons of sugar like some other reviewers said and the boys almost sent me to the store to get more strawberries! We just sat around the dinner table and dipped fresh strawberries until we were ready to bust.

This recipe always works really well for me. Never had any issues with it. It's simple, light and perfectly sweet without being overly so, so it makes a nice addition to really dense or rich desserts.

YUMMY!! After reading the other views I decided to add 2TBS of Powdered Sugar and 1/2 tsp of Vanilla and it is absolutely delicious! SO easy to make and much better than Redi Whip!

I made this to frost an ice cream cake. It came out perfect. I can't imagine wanting it any sweeter. Yuck. Tip: If you're out of powdered sugar, like I was, just whirl up some regular granulated sugar in a coffee grinder, food processor, or similar. Works great.

I had the ingredients and wanted to compare store bought canned whip cream to "the real thing". I used a basic single cup blender and pre-whipped the cream as suggested for a few seconds, added the recommended ingredients, turned on the blender and in a few seconds it was so firm the cream was all stuck to the top of the blender! SO EASY! As for the taste, I would probably add more sugar (as some suggested) but I really liked the texture and simplicity of this recipe, especially in the blender. 

My biggest complaint about the canned stuff is how quickly it falls. 20 minutes and this stuff is as firm as it was when I opened the blender.

This recipe really helped me make a great whipped cream for all my homemade desserts! It is pretty simple, but you can use whichever flavorings you want and add more sugar if you want a sweeter, more noticeable taste. I like mine very subtle, so I stick to the recipe. The first couple times it turned out pretty soupy, but that was only because I didn't mix long enough. The third time, I used the whisk attachment on my mixer, and it turned out perfect! It's a good starter for someone learning how to make a homemade whip cream.

I believe in rating the recipe as stated and as stated, it was not quite sweet enough.  I added an extra tablespoon of powdered sugar and that brought it up to 5 stars.

This is just like I have always made whipped cream. It's important that everything is really cold when making it. Another tip: If you have long hair, keep it tied back! I once had my hair fall into the bowl when making whipped cream and got the mixer stopped just as the beaters reached my scalp. It is a good thing that it wasn't my KitchenAid or I would have been scalped!

This was so easy! I did put my metal bowl and whisker in the freezer for 10 minutes. I used a tablespoon of sugar-free vanilla syrup(torani or davinci make great syrups) instead of the extract. I use it in place of all my vanilla recipes and usually go with the full tablespoon on most recipes. I also used a heaping tablespoon of confectioners sugar. Cooking/Baking is all about experimenting with what you like, so never be afraid to try variations of a recipe.  I did use a handmixer, and found going up the higher speeds gave me a better consistency than at a lower speed.

I've heard how easy it is to make whipped cream but had NO IDEA! now that Ive done  this - Ill never buy it again. Next time will probably pick up a fat free or light cream, however this was on the mark! Thanks Paula! My hubby is  diabetic and I was looking at making a sugar free cream cheese frosting and read a review that said using H/M whipped cream is the only way to really make the recipe SUGAR FREE. Happy I stumbled across that because now our diabetic dinner guests can have a semi guilt free dessert (its not low fat, just NO SUGAR)!

Perfectly SIMPLE recipe! Used 2TBS confectioners' sugar rather than 1TBS.

Blended in a Kitchen Aid mixer. Kept metal mixing bowl and the whisk attachment in the freezer for over an hour. Used this whipped cream as a topping for a Gluten Free Pumpkin Pie at Thanksgiving 2011.

Loved this!  Didn't change a thing.  Used it to top pumpkin pie and cheesecake.  Chill your bowl in the fridge before making this and it will make your life easier!

I don't think I care for vanilla extract in my whipped cream. Or is there a specific brand that makes this recipe better? Will likely omit the extract next time. The whipped cream was very light and fluffy. Had leftovers in the fridge. The next day I checked, it had separated into liquid and solid. Yuck. Do all whipped creams do that?

Having never made homemade whipped cream before, I was nervous.  I did chill the beaters and metal bowl prior and it came out perfectly!  Great recipe.

Perfect recipe.  I made strawberry shortcake and realized I didn't have any Cool Whip.  Luckily I had enough heavy whipping cream leftover from making ice cream last week.  This recipe came to my rescue as I quickly whipped up the topping for the shortcake.  I followed another reviewer's advice of using a hand mixer to whip it.  Started on the lowest setting, but didn't really form stiffer peaks until I increased the speed.  Then it whipped quite quickly.  I'll definitely make this again.  My husband was a huge fan of this decadent addition to our otherwise pretty simple shortcake. Thanks for posting!

Making your own whipped topping couldn't be easier! And it definitely tastes better than anything store-bought! I especially love that you can adjust the sweetness to complement what you serve it with.

I thought the vanilla had a really off-putting taste.  I am also not sure if there was enough sugar in there. 

However, the cream itself, was just delicious.

Great recipe! I also added a pinch of salt. As a lover of Coffee-Mate and a member of the Brew Crew, I usually add 1/4 cup of Coffee-Mate's Caramel Apple or Eggnog Latte liquid creamer. Freeze the whipped cream and use on hot apple pie - delicious!

Others have noted that you have to use a metal bowl for this recipe.  I am proof that you do not have to do that.  Since I lack a metal and glass bowl but I do have a plastic mixing bowl what I did was put the beaters and the bowl into the freezer to make sure they were good and cold before I beat the ingredients.  It turned out perfect for me after beating.  I will make this again!

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  I made half the amount it called for and it scaled down nicely.  My boyfriend would have preferred it sweeter, but I thought it was perfect as I liked it more creamy-flavored.  I would recommend adding more sugar if you like it really sweet.  Great recipe!

It was kinda runny, maybe I didn't beat enough but I didn't want to overbeat either!  I also had to add 2 1/2 times the amount of sugar and 2 times the vanilla (otherwise it had no flavor)  but it did turn out yummy that way!

This recipe is easy to remember and super easy to scale down or up, which means I can whip it up super quick and not have to look up the recipe.  Also, I like the sweetness level (not overly sweet), but it's easy enough to tweak.  Any leftovers go right on top of our coffee.

My husband made this to go with our pancakes and it was so delicious!  Very light and fluffy.  We didn't have confectioners sugar so he used regular white sugar and it still turn out perfect!  We both agreed we will never have to buy whipped cream again.

Excellent recipe, and I am giving you 5 stars because you didn't forget to add a simple tip (chill bowl and utensils) to help the beginning cook to be more sucessful in their cooking endeavors. Sometimes we forget our beginnings, and how many of those small cooking tips have helped us along the way. Whipped cream is very easy to make, but even the most simple recipe can fail, if we forget the little things along the way. I love making my own whipped cream because it can be varied in so many ways to enhance the flavor of any dessert, as you can see from the other reviewers. Add a little more or less sugar, different flavorings, food coloring, etc. Thank you for sharing your recipe and "little tip".

Perfect, perfect whipped cream.  It's quick and easy to make and tastes wonderful.  I paired it with Apple Pie by Grandma Ople on this site.

Works great! I put my bowl and mixer in the freezer overnight. I beat it by hand and it was ready in 5 min! I put at least 2 TBSP of sugar because it was definitely not sweet enough.

Very simply sweet.  Not overpowering.  This was the first time I made homemade whipped cream.  I was surprised at how easy it was.  And I was delighted that it was not too sweet.  It made a perfect addition to the pies I made.  I can't wait to make this again.

Nice basic recipe.  Perfect if you double the sugar and halve the vanilla.  Also, chill bowl and whisk before making.  If you don't use it all the first time, just whisk it briefly again before serving the second time.

Super simple and oh so good!  I chilled my bowl and beaters in the freezer for a good 10 minutes before mixing.  The cream came out perfectly.  Just sweet enough without being overpowering.

The secret to this is definitely the beating of the heavy cream,the more you beat the thicker it gets.I've made this a few times,1st time by the recipe which was good.I like it a little sweeter so I add more sugar and a tad bit more vanilla.This is so close to Cool Whip it's crazy.Thanks for the recipe.

If you've never made your own whipped cream you've got to try it. I usually add a tablespoon of orange liqueur as well, especially if I'll be serving it with something strawberry based.

Wow Amazing! So Simple, so few ingredients but so mouth watering. I made a double batch for some "Welcome Home" pies and added and extra teaspoon of vanilla well, because I like vanilla. I will definitely use this for my whipped cream recipe from now on. I can't wait for the boys to taste their pies! I know they'll love it too!

Great recipe! Not very sweet though, so I added about 1/4 cup of white sugar. Great topping though for cakes! Not as heavy (or fattening) as buttercream!

I've never made whipped cream from scratch, but Martha Stewart thinks it's insane not to, I now agree with her!  This recipe was super simple, I had all of the ingredients at my disposal, didn't need to make a special trip to the grocery store.  I too thought it wasn't sweet enough, added in 2 packets of Splenda to reach a good sweetness without overpowering it.  I also used Mexican 100% pure white vanilla and it was amazing! I will use this recipe again and again.

Super simple and so much better than the stuff you can buy at the store. I added a tablespoon more of sugar, as 1 tablespoon wasn't quite sweet enough for me.  Thanks for sharing!

THANK YOU! for providing this classic recipe. I've been cooking for about 25 years and had never made "homemade" whipped cream until I baked a pie over the weekend and found myself longing for a carton of frozen whipped topping...I realized I had a fresh pint of heavy cream that I'd bought for another recipe and decided to try making fresh whipped cream using this recipe. I will never buy premade whipped cream again! This is so easy and so much better than storebought. For someone raised on the popular frozen brand of whipped topping I guess I thought making homemade was a chore or required some sort of special talent, LOL. I used my electric hand mixer and it was mixed, whipped and dollop'ed on the pie in less than 10 minutes! Yay!

This would have been five-star, except that I needed about two tablespoons more powdered sugar to make it sweet enough, and it took much longer than five minutes beating to get it the right consistency - closer to 20, actually. I used a metal bowl and left both bowl and whisk in the freezer for 15 minutes before making this. Other than that though, once it DID get to the right consistency and I added the extra sugar, this was perfect - light and fluffy and very, very good. I will definitely use it again.

It was very nice when I first made it! I don't think I whipped it long enough though, I was afraid of making sugary butter out of it! I froze my (metal) bowl for a half-hour as suggested and I'm sure that helped a lot. My whipped cream became part of a trifle that had to wait about 6 hours (in a fridge) to get eaten, so it didn't hold up. I will likely only make this in the future for things that are going to be served shortly after the whipped cream is made!

I've tried a few different Whipped Cream recipes with no success.  This recipe was simple with very few ingridients.  First time I tried I thought it wasn't sweet enough so the second time around i added more sugar.  I no longer buy from the store...  Thanks for the recipe.

Extremely happy I learned this.  I had no idea it was so easy to have real, amazing whipped cream.  Unless you're just a die hard dieter there is NO reason to use cool whip ever again.

This was great! I ended up using 2 cups of cream, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 3 heaping tbsp of powdered sugar. It came out WAY better than you could ever buy at a grocery store!

Easy and delicious.  I chilled the bowl and the beaters ahead of time.  Did not have confectioners sugar, so I subbed with granulated sugar.  Great recipe!

I used about 1.5 cups of heavy cream and had to end up using 4 tablespoons of sugar to make this sweet enough for my liking. B/c I had to keep mixing it, it did end up looking very clumpy, but still tasted very smooth and yummy :) Freezing it for later use :D

Wow!! We had our first batch of Strawberry Short Cake and I forgot to get whipped cream. Luckily I had some heavy cream on hand so I figured I would give this recipe a try. I did up the sugar to 2 Tbsp, but this was great. My kids absolutely loved it, they licked the bowl clean. Will definitely use this recipe from now on instead of the store bought stuff. Thanks!

If not serving right away, you can keep the whey from separating by replacing the 10X sugar with apple jelly.

I don't have an electric mixer right now, so I did it by hand with a whisk.  (I can honestly say that this is one desert that I worked off before I ate!) I didn't have time to freeze the bowl first.  So I took one shorter, large bowl and one slightly smaller taller bowl.  I put ice cubes and water in the big bowl and then nested the smaller one in it and did the whipping in the small one once it had cooled.  This way the bowl stayed cold the entire time.  Make sure you put a towel underneath the big bowl, because as the ice cubes melt, the bowl could overflow.  I doubled the recipe and it was very good.  (But I do recommend doubling the sugar)

I'm giving this five stars with following modification: 3 T powdered sugar instead of 1 T.  This was an excellent topping for the "Banana Cream Pie I" that I made on this site.

I always eyeballed my whipped cream and never actually learned how to make it properly.  Once I prepared it this way (which is so easy), I get perfect whipped cream every time.  I don't use confectioner's sugar however, because I only use unbleached sugar, and it still comes out great.  I'm sure it makes a difference, but I prefer knowing my ingredients are natural.

Delicious, easy, and fast to prepare....not to mention much better for you than those chemicals in a tub they call Cool Whip. You can taste the difference. Make it as sweet or not sweet as you prefer by adding or subtracting the amount of sugar you use. Try different extracts for a different flavor. Also try sandwiching this between two chocolate graham crackers and sticking it in the freezer for a low-fat ice cream sandwich substitute. For even less calories, use Splenda in place of the confectioners sugar.

This was not sweet enough for me. I added 1 Tbs more sugar and 1 tsp more vanilla, it probably could have used more of both but I was afraid of over whipping.

A great technique for those of us who don't know how to make homemade whipped cream, but I don't think that I would have enjoyed the recipe as much as is.  I added 2 Tbsp. more confectioner's sugar, and another tsp. of vanilla.  Just our tastes.  Thanks for steering me in the right direction!

Much better than canned whipped cream, and pretty darn easy to whip up.  The nice vanilla-ness goes well fruit and biscuits for a light dessert.

This recipe was very nice. Much better than store bought products. However, it was not sweet enough for the particular recipe I was using it for though. Next time I will use the suggestions of other reviewers and increase the sugar amount.

I didn't think this was sweet enough, but after it's whipped it's too late to do anything about it. Next time I'll increase the sugar slightly. (It was still nice for our Thanksgiving pecan pie!)

Very good stuff, much better than the store bought stuff. I didn't follow the directions correctly, and I beat it all together at once, but it still turned out really good. I served this on top of a recipe for Favorite Hot cocoa (also on this site)and geezzeee was it good. Thank You!

Far superior to Cool Whip!!!  Should you prefer it a bit sweeter for that sweet tooth of yours...go ahead add another helping of powdered sugar, the integrity of the whipped cream will not be jeopardized, just sweeter.  Need I say that Cool Whip has lost an endorser as I have truly been converted by this quick and easy and so very luxuriant whipped topping! Heavenly!!!

I used this as the topping for the old fashioned coconut pie recipe on this site and it was so easy and delicious!!!  not too sweet, but just perfect. If you really like sweet I recommend coolwhip.  But this is PERFECt and does not overpower the dish you use it on.  Will definatley make again and again.

I love to use homemade whip cream on desserts for special holidays.  It's so easy that I never remember to save the recipe.  Thanks for posting

Awesome. Works well even if you don't have a whip attachment on your mixer - I only had beaters and, although it probably took a couple minutes longer, it turned out great. The only part on the pumpkin pie that my daughter was interested in!

I had NO idea it was this easy! I'm 41 and this is the first time I've ever even tried to make whipped cream. Like others here, I won't ever use the store-bought whipped cream again. Why would I? This is fabulous (it's going on strawberries & blueberries on pound cakes.) Yum.

One word - heaven!   I made this as the final part of a brownie sundae (it was one of those days), and it was absolutely perfect! Delicious!  Just don't make the same mistake I did and get regular whipping cream -- I was whipping forever!! Make sure you get the heavy cream.  I also added an extra table spoon of powdered sugar, although given the brownie, vanilla ice cream, and chocolae syrup I had with my dessert, I really didn't need the extra sweetness in the whipped cream!

You saved my life tonight.  Tomorrow is my 20th High School Reunion and I was volunteered to make desserts.  I made a 4 Layer Delight and thought I had all the ingredients and I forgot Cool Whip.  So I came here first because I can always find what I need here and sure enough, here you were.  This taste great, but I added more sugar to make it sweeter.  Its 3am and I had to wake my husband up to show him what I did and to taste it.  He loved it!  So Thank You so much!  We'll see if the 4 Layer Delight is a big hit tomorrow, July 3, 2005.

I'm with everyone else who said they will never use Cool Whip again. Why would you, when it's so easy to make your own? This produces a whipped cream that tastes so fresh and really makes your recipes that much better than with the pre-fab stuff. 
I like a dollop of this over fresh fruit, and you have an instant, simple dessert. A few tablespoons of softened Mascarpone cheese folded in at the end sends it over the top! Try it!

Great! Thank you. The only change I made was to add a heaping Tbls of powdered sugar instead of a true Tbls (because I didn't feel like measuring for real :-). It was the perfect amount of sweetness. We served on warm Best Brownies from Allrecipes. Thanks again.

I feel pretty cool making my own whipped cream. I used apprx 3 TBLS of powdered sugar. Sorry - I still think "Cool Whip" is top notch but this is a great sub when you have a cake waiting and none on hand. This was also good with fresh raspberries and their juice!! Thanks Paula!

I wasn’t able to watch the video, so more instruction on whipping speed would’ve been helpful. I just turned it up high and it came out great! I try not to add sugar,  so I used Splenda.

Nice easy recipe, unfortunately I needed to adjust for our liking,  I felt this recipe comes out fine, except it is tasteless.  I doubled both the Vanilla and the sugar, may triple the vanilla in the future.  Otherwise, comes out quite nice.

Perfect!  With half the sugar of most recipes, this tastes like the homemade whipped cream I grew up with.  
Best made with organic heavy cream.

This whipped cream was so quick and easy to make. I substituted Swerve confectioners sugar (0% sugar) and basically had to double the amount, but the result was fabulous!  Needed whipped cream in a hurry for mini Pavlovas that just finished cooling.  Thanks for this recipe!

Love, love, love this! After reading the other reviews, I doubled the amount of sugar and chilled the bowl and mixers beforehand in the freezer. The sugar could even be tripled, as it was still a bit on the unsweetened side for my tastes. I had all my kids taste it and they loved it too! Can't wait to try out other flavor combinations. This was also so easy, I can't believe I've never tried this before. Will use again.

I really liked this recipe! But it definitely needs more surgar!! I added 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to mine! It you don't have powdered sugar you can use regular and put it in the food processor until it is a powdery substance!

Very easy to make. It's true, don't whip it too much because it will turn lumpy. Also, in my opinion it wasn't sweet enough.

The crust amount is not enough for a pie. Recipe has to be doubled to work. When I baked the crust, the butter cane out of the crust and pooled in the top. Clearly way too much butter. I ended up using this recipe as instructed and made cupcake crusts. It made only 6 cupcakes. The butter pooled massively when baked. I took paper towels to dab away the butter and form the crust again. I then cooked the crust an additional 3 minutes since not hardened yet. Still not hard. I ended up putting banana cream filling in the cupcakes along with putting whip cream on top. I won’t be able to take out the cupcakes but will be able to eat them out of the pan. Not a good crust recipe!

I did not get the domestic gene. I am absolutely terrible at making anything that doesn’t come in a box. Shame, I know. I digress. This was pretty easy. Definitely perfect for some nilla wafers for a midnight snack. Haha

Perfect as is. Made it for key lime pie and the family loved it. Hubby was caught after dessert eating a spoonful or two right out of the stainless steel bowl. Good tips on the reviews about chilling the bowl and beaters.

First time making a key lime and I’m from Florida- shame on me.  We buy a lot of local pies that are pretty good but this was absolutely delicious and easy.  Made homemade whip cream to top off. Had friend over and they loved it too

Fun to make and funner to eat! A little went a long way. I made this using a cup and a half of the whipping cream and it was enough for strawberry shortcakes for eight of us at an office celebration.

this is wonderful, easy to make, consistence just right & tastes
delish.  Holds up well when left out. Needed something to go with the flourless chocolate cake on site which was so rich & this did the trick.

I made this whipped cream two times now and it doesn’t turn out fluffy. It was  liquidy both times. I used 35% whipping cream one cup and one cup of icing sugar and one teaspoon of vanilla extract. I did everything exactly as says but it never turned fluffy like the picture of the two glasses of fruit with fluffy whipped cream on top 
Can you tell me what went wrong? Thanks it really tasted good just want to get that fluffy whipped cream done right next time. Please respond. 
Thanks.

Perfect.  Used it on a chocolate pie.  I did add 1/2 tbsp. more sugar and I also tried the 1 tsp. gelatin plus 1 Tbsp. water that a reviewer suggested to make the whipped cream more stable.

We loved it but we added a dash more of vanilla extract and  a tablespoon more of powdered sugar and it made it better.

Based on other reviews, I decreased the heavy cream to 3/4 cups and increased the powdered sugar to 2 tablespoons. I would make this again with these changes with 10 stars. I didn’t give this 5 stars only because I changed the recipe.

Wasn’t sweet enough with just one T of sugar so I added another plus a half teaspoon of vanilla, but then it was too sweet... probably 1 1/2 T sugar and 1 1/2 t vanilla would be perfect.

Added 1/4 cup more milk and used salted butter. Not overly sweet at all, would compliment a sweeter icing nicely. I made vanilla whipped cream for this one. Light and fluffy together.

This is my go to whipped cream recipe! I took the advice of others and prepped my mixing bowl and whisk in the freezer before beginning. I also doubled the confectioner's sugar to 2T for a little more sweetness. Turned out delicious. Next time I'm going to beat it just a little longer to make the peaks slightly larger.

Good recipe. I doubled it but just realised that I used 4 T. of confectioners sugar instead of 2...oops. Surprisingly it was not too sweet so I guess it was a good mistake!  I used it in a banana cream pie and will probably make another pie for the grandkids. I will be using this recipe again as I much prefer homemade whipped cream to cool whip

It took me two attempts to make this but was perfect with a nice flavor. Not sure what I did wrong the first time but the heavy cream wouldn't thicken.  I've never made homemade whipped cream before but it was so easy once I got it that I will never buy store bought again.  I loved the hint of vanilla in it and did add 2 TBSP of powdered sugar for taste.  Just wonderful on top of pumpkin chiffon pie. I would also imagine that you could play around with different flavorings for what dessert that you are making and it would be fantastic.

I made this for the first time and after tasting it we decided to add twice as much confectioners sugar and vanilla extract as the recipe called for.  This really boosted the flavor and everyone enjoyed it. This whipped cream was gone long before the Cool Whip was.

TIP: Pour the ingredients in a mason jar, and then use your immersion blender to whip. This method only takes 1-2 minutes vs. the 5 minutes using a mixer. To avoid over whipping, start with the low setting on your immersion blender and then increase, if needed. (Mine goes up to 10, so I started on 2 and then found that 4 was the perfect setting.) 

REVIEW: The recipe may be fine as written when served with perfectly ripe fruit or a rich dessert, but I've only tested it with a new brand of pudding that I found to be bland. Served with the bland pudding, I also found this whipped cream to be bland. Next time, I will at least increase the vanilla and maybe increase the sugar.  

FOR PERSPECTIVE: I'm that person who rarely drinks soda,  usually reduces sugar by half in recipes (except when making baked goods), and thinks that putting sugar in tea is disgusting. However, I don't like dairy products except for the creamy texture that they provide. If you love dairy products and aren't a sugar fiend, you may like this recipe as written.

As many reviewers pointed out, the first time I made it, it seemed as though it needed more sugar.  Also, even though I used pure vanilla extract, there was a distinct alcohol after taste that I hated.  So, the second time I used double the sugar, and vanilla from a vanilla bean.  Now,  I'll  never use any other whipped cream as long as I live.

Made as directed except for 2tbls of icing sugar. Lost 1 star because as for me i didn't really like the icing sugar taste. Will try regular sugar and maybe honey.

If doubling the recipe, don't double the vanillia. This is an okay whipped cream recipe if you're looking for a non-sweet whipped cream.

I had to throw this away and start over.
Horrible recipe for whipped cream!!! The vanilla was right the sugar was not nearly enough. I made it again using 3 tablespoons of granulated sugar adding the sugar and vanilla before beating it it was perfect. Do not use this recipe as it is!! I have no idea who came up with this combination but they evidentially never tasted it before posting the recipe.

OMG! First, I put a glass bowl and a whisk in the freezer for about 15 minutes. Started to whip the heavy cream by hand. Minutes went by and nothing. Then I read a review where someone used a mixer so I pulled mine out. In about a minute I saw the peaks! I added almond extract and Truvia for sweetener. Mixed. Sweet but not enough. Added another packet. Mixed. The consistency changed. I think I mixed too much. But it tastes absolutely delicious! I will probably make it again tomorrow! I don't see why I can't add the extract and sweetener in the beginning. No more cans of Ready Whip! I may purchase a metal bowl at some point but I don't see how this could get any better! Will try the banana flavor one day.

Recipe turned out perfect with addition of another Tbsp of powdered sugar. It was enough to frost a 9x13 cake pan.  Thank you to the reviewers for suggestions. This recipe will be a keeper!

Turned out great!  I didn't notice that the recipe called for confectioners sugar until I was making the whipped cream.  Of course, I didn't have any.  So, I went to Google to find out how to make it.  It's super easy.  I needed two tablespoons of confectioners sugar so I put a 1/3 of a cop of regular refined sugar in the blender and blended until it was powder....maybe 3-4 minutes.

I think it could go for another dose of sugar, but I didn't do it because the ladies in my family don't care for things to be too sweet :) I made it to go with almond bread, so I used almond extract instead of vanilla too. YUM

This is tasty.  Good consistency, however could I get it more fluffier?  Making our own since the realization of carraggeenan being in our creamers,some heavy cream, & whipped aerosol cream (as a not so good ingredient) we have made our own & gotten the new coconut cream

great base to start with.  i added 2 more T spoons of sugar to sweeten it little more.  I also put the heavy whipping cream in the freezer for about 10 min or till it got a little frozen layer on the top prior to mixing.   came out nice and rich and the family loves it.  will defiantly make again

Although it would be good on/in some things, it wasn't sweet enough for the pie I was making. I just added in a bit more confectioners sugar (probably another tsp.), and about a 1/2 tsp. more of Vanilla extract.

I read most of the reviews first. I have never made whipped cream before, so I had to start from somewhere. I know my taste, so I added 3 Tbls. sugar, which was plenty for me. Putting the steel bowl and beaters in the freezer for a bit helped a lot. I could tell from the start. It didn't take long to make. Thank you for the recipe and the advice. I pat myself on the back for this one! :)

The texture was perfect. I used a glass bowl. The taste wasn't quite right. Maybe needed more than a tablespoon of sugar.

This is a standard whipped cream recipe. I  did chill the bowl but not the beaters. Pretty hard to screw up. But then again I guess you could over beat it  and then you'd end up with a sweet  vanilla flavored butter. Not so bad.

Freeze metal bowl and beaters.  I also put the cream in the freezer for 10 minutes prior to mixing.  2 1/2 tbsp. of powdered sugar is better.  used to top chocolate cream pie.

If I had any idea how easy it was to make whipped cream from scratch, I would have done it years ago!  This recipe is the perfect combination of flavors and easy enough for a beginner to make.  I now use it in my summer trifle recipe and it's delicious.

Using organic or raw confectioner sugar wasn't fine enough to blend into the whipped cream. Agave or honey might blend better.

Worked for me but I'm not patient so I used my stick beater with the whisk attachment.  I didn't stick the whisk in as deep as it would go right away.  After  mixing til I got bubbles I just slightly beat the top of the cream little by little. When it started getting slightly thick I then finished it off putting it deeper into the cream. This kept the whisk from splattering all over the place. ??  Everything was good and cold and took very little time.

I would recommend adding more than 1 TBSP of powdered sugar - maybe 2 TBSP, especially if you're used to the canned or tub version from the store. 
I also chilled the bowl and whisk in the freezer first. If you make this by hand using a whisk, use granulated sugar.

No changes made. Turned out fabulous. No matter how much easier it is to open a tub of Cool Whip, it will never compare to the real thing!

I used 1 TBL regular sugar that was ground up in the magic bullet instead of confectioners sugar.  Excellent!

I had to keep scooping confectioners sugar and I ended over beating it a little. I think it totaled to 6 tablespoons of confectioners sugar.

Consistency is spot on but in the future I will definitely add more sugar to the cream to sweeten this up.

I've made coconut cake before but this was so moist and perfect. I was worried it would be too sweet and wet, I hate wet bread but it was just moist enough to stick to the fork. It was not super sweet either. I followed the recipe and did not deviate at all. I would definitely make this again.

I didn't have heavy cream, just regular whipping cream, but it turned out fine.  I substituted maple syrup for the vanilla extract and bumped up the quantity of syrup a bit for some gingerbread cake that needed a yummy topping.

Added lemon zest. Brightened it up a little. Lime and orange crossed my mind, but can't speak to those add-ins yet ;-)

PS: deffo needs another tbsp of sugar

Followed others recommendations to put bowl and whisk in freezer before starting and added gelatin to "cheat" with the stiffness. Turned out delicious and perfect. It is very light in sweetness compared to store-bought whipped cream but that suits recipes just fine as a neutral base. I would definitely make it again.

recipe as is, is not sweet enough for my tastes. so,.....
i added more conf sugar, one tablespoon and an extra half teaspoon of vanilla.  it's getting there. next time i will just add more conf sugar and see if that makes it.  
*not sure if the extra vanilla made a difference.

This recipe is PERFECT, I chilled the whipped cream in the fridge, since it was made for later as a topping for the Berry Crisp I made (also from this website). I chilled the bowl and whisks while I was prepping the Crisp, perfect. I also found it perfectly sweet with 2 TBS :)

This is really easy to make.  The first time, I did not know how long I needed to whip it because I was using the lowest speed on my mixer and it seemed to take forever.  I wasn't sure if I should turn up the speed.  I also found it really bland.  So, the next time I made it, I whipped it on medium speed, which worked fine, and doubled the icing sugar - perfect!  Bye, bye - ready-made!  I'll use this every time now!

Delicious over Key Lime Pie VII. Upped vanilla extract to a tablespoon, which was yummy with the lime flavor and great if you want a stronger vanilla taste.

Great, easy recipe as is. It's easy enough to add more sugar if you prefer a sweeter taste. I appreciated the tip on chilling the metal bowl and beaters. This is my go-to recipe - so easy and tasty that you can never go back to store bought stuff again!

Recipe is great and so simple. Only thing I would change us adding a half tsp of vanilla extract and a half a tbsp more of the sugar because to me the vanilla flavor was to strong for such a light dish and a little more sugar made it just right! Also its important to know you can whip this by hand with a whisk, no need for the electrical mixed. Recipe didn't specify so I wasn't sure. Turned out great!  I didnt freeze the bowl i used and it turned out fine! Goes great with scones, coffee or hot chocolate! Thanks for sharing.

I made it exactly as the recipe called for (except I didn't bother chilling the bowl or whisk). It game out great, but I did need to add a little bit more sugar though because it wasn't as sweet as I wanted it.

It wasn't as sweet as I like so I added 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar. Fast easy recipe!

Overall it worked for me (I put my whisk and KA mixing bowl in the freezer for 10 mins) but I like whipped cream a little sweeter and will probably use 2 T of powdered sugar next time.

Texture and taste were very good although I felt as it did not have enough flavor. I may have over beaten but it went from being a runny cool whip to a very thick  whipped cream thicker than any others I have ever had.

The recipe as is gives a milder flavor. If you want it sweeter, add more powdered sugar. But I think it's perfect as is.

Simple to do, just make sure your equipment is pre-chilled in the freezer. You get quite a bit out of this recipe, and it tastes good to boot:)

I will never buy a can or tube again.this is so easy and simple. I didn't measure, just added to taste and i thought it wasn't sweet enough. Made strawbery short cake for my Son and his friend and they loved it. Leftover was just as good tonight.

I thought there was too much vanilla and not enough sugar.  I tried it with 1 Cup of heavy cream, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, and 2 TBS of powdered sugar and came up with exactly what I wanted.  This recipe was a good starting point though.  I just preferred my ratios.

This whipped cram was so good! It was super simple to make and tasted even better than store bought cream. I used raw sugar instead of confectioner's sugar and it worked just fine.

I first found this recipe a while back ( sorry for late review) I use it for my coconut cream pie which I also found here and thanks to Paula I've never used whipped cream from the store.  This really is the perfect whipped cream recipe. Don't be afraid to add a little more powdered sugar. It nice to adjust it to your taste buds. Thank you Paula !! It's recipes like this that make all recipes an incredible site. Real recipes from real people...

I made this recipe to go with the homemade Key Lime Pie VII and my husband really liked it.  It saves well in the fridge and tastes even better after refrigerating it.  I gave it four stars because it did need extra powdered sugar to make it sweeter. I probably put in at least another tablespoon.  

Plus, I froze a whisk and metal bowl as others recommended and it took me at least 20 minutes to get the ingredients to whip.  I gave up after 10 minutes of not getting to the first "peak" stage and threw in the other ingredients.  I also tried two whisks at once (don't have an electric beater).  I eventually got it all to whip up!  For some reason, there were little black specks in the whipped cream.  They would dissolve if I touched them.  So, I think that may have been the vanilla extract I was using (a new brand I have never used).

This was my first time making whipped cream. I really hate that stuff in the markets in the can. This recipe was so simple and easy to make, my only regret is that I hadn't made it sooner. Missed out on a lot of nights of peaches and cream as a result.

Came out great after I realized you had to whip for a VERY long time.  I do not have a hand beater and my mixer wouldn't work so had to do it by hand but it eventually turned into tasty whipped cream after quite a workout!

I found the vanilla to be a bit much and the sugar to be too little. Made a second time with two Tbs confectioner's sugar and 3/4 tsp. of vanilla and it was much better.

This was perfectly sweet for me. However, it was difficult for me to store the leftovers to use for later. The whipped cream became less fluffy, but that could have just been me not knowing how to store homemade whipped cream.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic. Not to sweet or too bland. Its a great tip to chill the bowl, because with me, the Kitchen Aid whips is up a lot faster. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

A bit too much vanilla extract for my liking. Next time I will either only use half as much or none at all. It also was not as sweet as I had anticipated.

I had never thought of making real whipped cream.  In our family it always comes from a can or tub.  But after learning how to bake pies, I decided it was time to attempt some real whipped cream. I dusted off my mixmaster and bought whisks for it.  This recipe was amazingly easy.  Guess I won't be using the can anytime soon again.  Tastes great too.  Thanks.

Absolutely delicious! I used 2Tb. of confectioner's sugar like some of the other reviewers did and thought it was perfect. And it is so quick and easy to do. Will definitely be using this from now on.

I rating this receipe a 3 rather than a 5 because the recipe as written wasn't sweet enough for me as other mentioned. But it was super easy and I will definitely be making my own whipped cream from now on.  If it was a little sweeter I would have given it five stars.

It whipped up perfectly in a pre-frozen bowl and whisk attachment, but it needed two tablespoons of regular sugar rather than 1 tablespoon of confectioner's sugar (my family said it wasn't sweet enough and they prefer regular sugar).

This is a great recipe depending on the sweetness of your dish. If you have an already sweet dish then this will compliment well. If your dish is not so sweet I would add more sugar.

I didn't chill my bowl and beaters. Started beating on low, and worked up to med-high. And it seemed like it took forever, but as soon as you have soft peaks, add your vanilla and sugar, because it goes from soft to stiff peaks very quickly. Don't overbeat!! This was my first time making homemade whipped cream, and it was a success thanks to this easy recipe!! Tastes like cool whip, except it's not too sweet! I will no longer purchase whipped cream, I will make it!

I made this tonigt for layers in an ice cream cake. Turned out GREAT. I only added a drop of vanilla, but it turned our perfect. I can't wait to have this with berries in the spring and summer!

It's delicious!  I put it on my sour cream lemon pie, so I'm sure it will taste wonderful on that.

Great basic recipe.
It's easy to make. I always put my bowl and beaters in the freezer for 10 minutes to chill before I start. I also use 2 Tbsp of sugar instead of just one to give it a little sweetness. It is important not to overbeat since that causes the cream to curd like butter.
We used this as a topping on our strawberry shortcakes.

This does not compare to store bought whip cream. Very low on the sweetness factor (and I doubled the confectioners sugar!) I've recall other recipes with  at least 1/4 cup of sugar (regular sugar) in them and they were much sweeter!

I used about 2 1/2 tbsp powdered sugar and found it to be the perfect amount of creamy sweetness! I used this to top my coconut creme pie and it held it's shape very well! One day later, the pie topping still looks scrumptious!

Love this on waffles, one change I made was to use almond extract instead of vanilla, skip the pie just grab a spoon and eat this stuff by itself.

PERFECT Whipped Cream!  I didn't freeze my bowl. My cream was cold though.  It was my first time making it.  I used more than allotted confectioners sugar.  It is perfect and easy.  Never used canned stuff again.  Nothing beats freshly made whipped cream.

This is a great base recipe.  I altered the recipe for my lemon pie by adding a little lemon juice and lemon extract.  I altered it again and put almond roca flavoring in it for my pumpkin cheesecake.

This was so quick and easy I had it made in no time! You must be careful not to over beat otherwise it turns out very lumpy!! The only I changed was the sugar. I increased it to two tablespoons. We had this has a topping to the apple pie I made. Delish!

This is the first time I have ever made whipped cream.  I did it because I was trying to avoid the corn syrup that is very prevalent in premade whipped topping.  It turned out very well.

Had some extra Heavy whipping cream left over so I came in search for a recipe! Perfect on my french toast. Didn't need to use a cooled bowl or anything however I do have a decent hand mixer with a whisk attachment that I suspect made the process a lot easier.

needs an extra Tablespoon of confectioners' sugar and yum!  I unfortunately didn't chill the bowl and beaters first, but next time I will because I feel it will make a HUGE difference in texture and stiffness.

Delicious - almost tasted like lightly whipped vanilla ice cream. I used heavy cream (not the kind that said whipping) and had to beat with hand mixer for about 5 minutes to get the stiff peaks.

I actually didn't have a metal bowl, so I used a tall plastic container and swiveled the whisk with both hands until the cream got thick.  Took a while but I stuck with it and it thickened.  I also used regular white sugar before it got too thick and no extract and it still came out good for my brownies!

Very easy and delicious.  Like other reviewers, I chill my bowl and beaters beforehand (I tried 30 minutes, but could probably get away with less).

I gave 4 stars because really this isn't as sweet as I'm used to with Cool Whip. Although it is very good. I actually used this homemade recipe with one of the pumpkin recipes on here and it turned out scrumptious. I would definitely make again, but add more sugar. Thanks for sharing.

I'm 17 and just starting to get into baking and making homemade stuff, so some thing like whipped cream is kind of daunting. This recipe came out AMAZING though, super easy and my sisters were throughly impressed with my "skillz" =)

I topped my banana cream pie with this instead of the meringue  I usually use.  It tastes wonderful .  I did have to add more powdered sugar to get it to my desired consistency.

I had to add more confectioner's sugar to get it just right.  Otherwise, it tastes just like whipped cream in the can only better because you don't get that can flavor.  I can see myself using this recipe for other delicious desserts.  My family really liked it as well.

The end result was awesome!  But I had to add almost 3 times the called for amount of confectioners sugar.  By the time I had mixed it so much it was thick, so I added a little milk.  The recipes as posted is bland, but a good base to start with.

sooooooo much better than whipped topping with 15 different ingredients you can't pronounce!!  cream and sugar - it doesn't get any better than that!!!  I cooled my bowl and mixer spoons in the fridge for a while before I started whipping.  no more store bought whipped topping for us anymore!

I always wondered what the big deal about fresh whipped cream was. Now I know! Its awesome! I used my magic bullet and it took like one minute to have fabulous creamy topping fo rmy shortcake! Not sure I will ever be able to go back to the can!

I needed a QUICK & EASY whipped cream recipe and I found it! This took minutes and was delicious! I would recommend adding 1 more tbsp of sugar and making this in a metal bowl that's been chilled for 10 minutes or so.

A very nice whipped cream.  I like that it wasn't overly sweet like store bought ones that taste mostly like sugar.  Having the bowl and whisk very cold helped a lot, I put mine in the freezer about half an hour before cooking, and it worked perfectly.

there's really nothing like making whipped cream for this first time, i wasn't completely convinced that i could create fluffy white wonderfulness from liquid cream, but the results were fantastic.

I prsonaly would have added a bit more sugar to make it sweeter but besides that the recipe was spot on. Also if u don't want to wait for your bowl and whisk to chill just run them both under very cold water and if you don't want arthritis then you should probably use a hand or stand mixer.

The consistency of this was nice, but I thought it was lacking in flavor. I even doubled the confectioners sugar and vanilla but it still tasted bland.

I don't chill my whisks or bowl but this still comes out perfect every time. My 7 yr old daughter loves to help me make it because she says it's like magic! I've made this adding different flavored extracts & it's even better.

Fantastic!  I live in the UK, so Cool Whip isn't available, but, having tried this, I'm sticking to making my own whipped topping.  So simply and delish.

I used regular sugar because I didn't have any powdered/confectioner's sugar. I also added a little extra per previous comments (3 silverware "tablespoons"- not measuring table spoons). Next time I will use less sugar and will either use powdered sugar or will grind the sugar in a coffee grinder first to make homemade "powdered" sugar. I also used "whipping cream" not "heavy cream"- because that's all they had at the store. In any case, this recipe was super easy and totally blows away store bought. You could put this with any fruit, dessert, whatever!

This works great as a base and can be slightly tweaked with different flavors of extract such as raspberry, lemon, instant expresso and of course mint!

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out just right.  I can see how some folks might want a little more sweetness, but I prefer to not overpower the cream with sugar.

This recipe is great. I made a Bundt pound cake. I sliced some fresh strawberries into the whipped cream and poured it into the center of the pound cake and everyone loved the cake and whipped cream.

I used Splenda in place of sugar in an equal amount and it was perfect! I doubled the recipe to use in ambrosia for a dinner party and everyone raved over it and said they had never tasted whipped cream that was so good. It made a great dessert. In doubling, I went with about 1 1/2 t. of vanilla. Used cold glass bowl and beaters.

This is the whip cream recipe I always use.  I first chill my bowl and beater in the freezer and it comes our perfect every time.  I don't even measure my powdered sugar I just add a little until I get the taste and consistency I want.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good recipe! I bought strawberries & the shortcake shells but forgot the whipped cream. I'm glad I found this, I can't belive how simple but tasty it turned out! I don't think I'll ever buy whipped cream again! I did use 3 TBS like other reviewers suggested.

I wasn't sure how long to whip it so I think mine turned out a little too runny.  I put a metal bowl and the beaters in the freezer for about 10 minutes and that helped.

Okay dude... I did this BY HAND.  My boyfriend and I took turns doing the 'whipping'.  I think it turned out quite yummy.  edspecially used as a dip for this sites Award Winning Chocolate Chip Cookies.  I used regular sugar and twice the amount of it and the vanilla.  I love that you can play around with this basic base. Thanks for sharing. :)

I loved this recipe.  I was looking for something to put in cream puffs.  I will use it for lots more than that now that I have tasted it.  I added quite a bit more powedred sugar than called for to get it as sweet as I wanted for the cream puffs. So easy. Thanks.

I gave it only 3 stars because to me, this needed much more sugar.  I liked it better with 3 Tbsp of sugar.  But I will definitely use this recipe as my starting point in the future for good whipped cream.

I too was all out of powdered sugar(it was two days after Christmas)so I used regular sugar. I don't think it made a bit of difference. This was an awsome recipe. It tastes better then store bought and was so easy to make. I made it to use on a coconut cream pie for my husband.

Overall I liked this recipe:  it's very easy and flavorful, and makes enough to top an entire pie.  However, I didn't think it was sweet enough for the banana cream pie I used it on.  I did add an additional 1T of powdered sugar and that helped.

Great, simple recipe.  Yes, a metal bowl is a must.  I know many reviewers suggested chilling the bowl first, which works great.  If you don't have time, it's fine if it's room temperature.  Try this recipe with 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  Yum!

It looked beautiful, and was fun to make!  I made it before dessert on Thanksgiving - I put it in the big mixer, and let the mixer do the work for me!  
I do think next time it needs a little bit more confectioner's sugar....

I was too careful not to overbeat the cream so I think I underbeat it - it was a bit thin and runny, but just a bit! I made it because I was craving something sweet and I didn't really have anything worthy at home. But this was delicious! The flavor is so good I never want to buy ready-made again! And it's easy to make, and will go with everything! I will make this many more times :-)

This recipe has good intentions, but it's too light on sweetness for my taste. If it was rewritten to include more confectioner's sugar, I'd give it a high four rating.

I doubled the confectioner's sugar. I started with a bowl and a whisk. After five minutes, I pulled out the hand mixer and let the power company do the work. I recommend that. It saves a lot of time. 

My slightly sweeter version was a hit. The kids picked it out of the bowl with their fingers, and my wife forced me to make a second batch before she'd eat the rest of my pumpkin pie.

I made this and could not get it to whip into peaks.  I accidentally added the vanilla BEFORE beating the cream.  I am not sure if this is what caused it not to thicken? I did chill my whisk and bowl about 20 minutes in the freezer before making the whipped cream.  I plan to try this recipe again - hopefully it will come out better next time.  Though I have to admit paying .99 cents for a tub of cool whip is easier!

Great recipe! I, too, added extra sugar and it turned out great. Hubby loved it! I chilled the bowl & beater bars ahead, and fixed the recipe for four. Perfect!

I think that it needs more sugar and vanilla than the recipe states.  It should also be noted in the recipe that freezing the metal bowl and beaters/wisk will give much better results.  With these modifications, it was delicious!

Very delicious whipped cream! The vanilla adds a nice touch of flavor. I loved this and thought it was perfect, but my boyfriend said it should be a little sweeter. I think I'll still make it like this. :)

Added slightly more sugar maybe 1/8th of a cup. I used it to top a strawberry short cake. Again, I chilled bowl and beaters for 10 mins in freezer. After topping cake I put it outside so that it would not melt. Everyone liked this.

Very good and light.  Simple to make.  Remember to put mixing whisks and bowl in freezer about 15 minutes before making.  Don't overbeat.  It was nice, not too sweet.

Excellent- so easy to make... instead of a whisk, I used my electric hand mixer and its whisk attachment.  This recipe puts those fake "whipped topping" products to shame! You just can't beat the freshness of homemade whipped cream!

It's sooooo good!  I made strawberry cheesecake with fresh strawberry sauce which came out really delicious by the way. It needed REAL whipped cream to make perfect and this recipe hit the spot. I could just eat the whipped cream by itself after the cake's all gone.

I am so thankful to come across this recipe.  I never knew the right amount of sugar/extract to add to whipping cream. This recipe is great. I took the advice for a cold bowl and beaters. It tasted great!

This whipped cream is super easy and yummy!  I used it on both my pecan pie and pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving.  It was fabulous.  It also keeps well a second day (if you have any left)!

I did as other instructed and I chilled my metal bowl and my beaters in the freezer for about 25 minutes prior to making this.  I also set the bowl on top of a frozen bag of veggies to keep it cold as mixing. I beat on medium speed for several minutes and it was ready! I did add about 1 1/2 tablespoons powdered sugar and I thought it was the perfect amount! Set up nice and paired well with my fruit salad!

A very good "real" whipped cream result, although I used more powder sugar as I like sweets. Deffinately place metal bowl and beaters in freezer for at least 1 hour prior to whipping. I also like to place the bowl on top of a bag of frozen veggies or a cold pack during whipping to make the process faster. Good Luck and Good Eats (thanks Alton Brown)

First time making whipped cream and it turned out perfect. My arm's still sore but it was worth it! ;) Even after putting the whisk and metal bowl in the freezer, I still wound up using a larger pot filled with ice water to help keep the temperature down. Otherwise, the recipe was perfect. I didn't have confectioner's so I used regular and it was ok. Only thing I may change was decreasing the vanilla a little bit. Maybe by half. I love vanilla but this was just a tad overkill. But I'll make this again - thanks for sharing.

Great recipe...easy to remember. I read it and five minutes later I was eating homemade whipped cream! A little too sweet, instead of a tablespoon of powdered sugar, I used 1/2 tablespoon and it tasted perfecto after that.  emiting some of the sugar, it's wonderful!

Great.  It was very "vanilla-ee" so I would use a milder vanilla or less of it next time.  Also, Trader Joe's heavy cream is the BEST!

This was a great recipe. I upped the confectioners sugar to at least 3 tablespoons and whipped longer until it was the consistency closer to butter so I could pipe it through a decorative tip onto the top of a pie. I actually noticed it tasted even better the next day after refrigeration.

I'm one of those who prefer it a bit sweeter so I add just a tad more sugar.

i definitely prefer this over the cool whip, it doesn't have that artificial taste.
you can add more sugar to make it more sweet as well.

This is the whipped cream recipe I use all the time.  Sometimes I add a little more confectioners' sugar.

Absolutely scrumptous!  Made it as topping for my sweet potato pie and it was a hit.  Agree on adding extra sugar.  Cool whip has nothing on this.

Awesome Recipe though

This was great! I made it in my KitchenAid and my freezer wasn't big enough to fit the bowl in to get it ice cold, but I filled the bowl with a buch of ice cubes, swirled them around and then let it sit for a few minutes before pouring them out and drying the bowl.  I did stick the beater in the freezer.  Thanks Paula.  The family RAVED about it.  I served it with Sweet Potatoe pie II also from this site!  What a hit.

The perfect whipped cream. My mom actually does it the same way, altho I add more powdered sugar to it, as I prefer my whipped cream to be a bit sweeter.  Less sugar = creamier, and doesn't add unneeded sweetness to some desert recipes. When I make my chocolate trifle, i tend not to sweeten it at all.  Also, you can use different flavorings, but I do prefer vanilla.

Quick, easy and delicious. Forgot the cool whip for my pumpkin pie and had whipping cream in the fridge. This was much better than cool whip! Thanks for the recipe.

I thought this recipe was really good. I used Confectioner's sugar first and it tasted powdery. So I used regular sugar and it tasted great. I think next time I'll use a little less vanilla andd use 2 tablespoons of regular sugar. This is definitely a "keeper" recipe. It is so easy to make and my husband loved it. We'll never buy Coolwhip again.

This is the recipe I've been using for years.  It's perfect not too sweet.  I sometimes use a teaspoon of almond extract or orange extract.

Fantastic!  I had never made homemade whipped cream before, and needed it for chocolate pie.  This was easy!!  Make sure you whip it long enough, until it is the consistency of cool-whip.  Never again will I use cool whip!  This is so much better.
