Excellent and impressive salad. Very easy. Break the ramen noodles into small pieces. If you don't, and you leave some larger piece, the small ones will burn/get more brown than the larger ones. Speaking from experience because I thought it would be better with a few larger pieces; don't, keep them small.
I liked the idea of sliced almonds though I didn't saute them. They're better sliced because they don't sink to the bottom. I thought the salad was a little too wet so I use more lettuce than suggested. 
You can also make the dressing ahead of time which I recommend so there isn't that gritty sugar texture.

I try not to change a recipe the first time I make it, but here are the minor changes I ended up making to this one:  1) I used pecans instead of walnuts.  2) I added some shredded carrots and sliced mushrooms.  3)I left out the green onion but that was ONLY because I forgot it!

The recipe is great and my sister and brother-in-law raved about the dressing.  It's something I will make again (and again) only next time I will:  1) use 1/4 cup of sugar in the dressing as recommended by other reviewers -- I think it will be just as tasty with less sugar.  2) toast the ramen and nuts in the oven and omit the butter to cut fat & calories.  3) remember the green onions!  

Thanks for a wonderful salad that everyone in the family loved!

I could have eaten the whole salad. I used one bag of packaged romaine lettuce, 2 green onions, same amount of broccoli and almonds instead of walnuts for a family of 4. The dressing is definitely sweet. You could prbably decrease the amount of sugar but I would start off making the original recipe first and go from there. I loved the "crunchies" for the top of the salad.

Add noodles just before serving with nuts and dressing...Was wonderful..I put the salad together before hand and the noodles lost their crunch

This is so good, I would give it more stars if I could!  I have made it several times.  I use a bag of precut romaine hearts and substitute red bell pepper cause we don't like raw broccoli...  I also double the noodles and saute them along with the walnuts in the butter (to which I add the seasoning packets).  Definitely wait until right before serving before adding the dressing and the noodles.  It is delish!!!

This salad is excellent!  Made it on the spur of the moment, didn't have the Romaine and used iceberg instead - it was crunchy and delicious.  I read the other reviews and was careful with the noodles, used almonds instead of walnuts, and it turned out divine.  I loved it, will definitely made this one again and again - thanks so much for sharing!

This salad was DELICIOUS!    I cut the amount of sugar in half, used olive oil vs. veggie oil and almonds vs. walnuts, I then only ended up using half of the dressing.  I made this salad for my family then a week later for some friends and it was gone both times.  Guests passionately raved about the salad.  Wolfgang, a carnivore, wouldn’t touch it regardless of the glowing reviews, but that is okay – more for me.

I love this recipe!  I usually make 1-1/2 times the dressing, and sometimes use a prepackaged bag of romaine. Also I like to use sliced almonds instead of the walnuts and I brown them in the butter along with the ramen noodles. Excellent!

So delicious!  This salad is made for almost all of my family's parties and it gets gobbled up each time.  I would suggest making 1/2 the amount of dressing because sometimes it can get too soggy.  Also, I am not a big onion fan, so I always skip those when I'm the one making it.

This is great, but made a few changes - used 1/4 c sugar - still plenty sweet.  Used a combo of cider vinegar and rice vinegar, and added a little sesame oil and some toasted sesame seeds to dressing. Used 1 T butter and sauteed nuts w/ noodles, using sliced almonds instead of walnuts.  Used 3 small heads of romaine, blanched the broccoli for a minute, and added 1 red bell pepper and 1 can mandarin oranges. Everyone loved it!

This is an awesome salad!  I brought it to a friend's and everyone loved it.  As others suggested, I used toasted slivered almonds, added dried cranberries and used half the sugar.  This is definitely a keeper.  I'm going to make it to go along with Easter dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

This salad was a huge hit! (even my mother-in-law complimented me). I did add some dried cranberries but I'm sure the salad would have been great without them as well.

WOW! WOW! WOW!  FINALLY!  A salad all the members of my large family liked.   It has taste, texture, color, and will be seen on our table frequently.  I did add red peppers and carrot shreds for additional color but it still would have been 5 star without those additions.  Thanks for a winner recipe!

Oh geeze,  how could anyone not love anything with fried ramen noodles?  This was fantastic, along with the dressing...I found it refreshing that it wasn't cabbage...that I love, don't get me wrong, but I love romaine too, and it was great!  Thanks for sharing.  By the way, it's versatile as well...! Yea! Oh, one more thing, I changed the recipe by adding sesame oil, which I adore.  In addition to the regular oil...it added depth, which I felt it needed.

This is a delicious recipe. I don't saute my ramen noodles or nuts in butter. I toast them in the oven. It makes them crunchy without the extra calories. Sometimes I add crazins to the recipe. My family likes this salad best when the lettuce and broccoli are chopped real small.

This turned out fantastic!  I grilled chicken and made it a main course. Used bagged coleslaw shredds. Mandarin oranges would be a great addition.

It seems there are hundreds of this type of salad recipe on this site.  I used broccolini and mixed lettuce.  Cut way back on the sugar (don't like sweet salads).  I also often leave out the noodles and for the crunch factor just add some almonds, sesame seeds and sunflower seeds...yum, just as tasty with less carbs.  I also season salad dressing with a little seasoning and celery salt.

This has, without a doubt, become our favorite salad!  I have made it countless times. I switch up the veggies but make the dressing exactly as listed...wait, I doubled the soy sauce by accident and we liked it so now I double it all the time.  I usually use only romaine but once added some leaf lettuce because I had some on hand, the leaf lettuce wilted a bit but it tasted great none the less.  The only substitution I use on a regular basis is sliced almonds instead of the walnuts--personal preference.  This salad is amazing with cauliflower instead of all or part of the broccoli; tomatoes and/or cucumbers, or whatever salad vegetables we have on hand, added in. It always gets rave reviews. I serve it with just about any meal--from pizza and sandwiches to meat and potatoes. I never make it with out doubling the recipe and have even quadrupled it and served it in a punch bowl for 10 of us with none leftover.  We never have any leftover because every loves it!  Thank you, Bissy, for this submission!

After making this recipe for the 4th time for my family and for guests, I figured I better review this for everyone else to know just how awesome this recipe is.  The dressing is perfect! However, the first time I did the noodles, I burnt them. Second time, I crushed them in the bag before opening it, made it much easier to saute them.

I have taken this salad to many potlucks and family dinners.  I use sliced almonds instead of walnuts and saute them with the noodles.  Instead of broccoli I use either shredded cabbage or shredded broccoli mix that you can buy already cut up.  Last time I used a bagged lettuce combination that had spinach, carrots, etc.  The key is the dressing.  Everywhere I serve it, I am asked for the recipe.  Have fun experimenting with it!

Camping can always mean the same food over and over.  I tossed the broccoli, lettuce and green onions and dumped it into transportable tupperware for the cooler.  Mixed the dressing in an old jar (for shaking!)  Roasted the ramen noodles at home (for flair), mixed them with the walnuts and bagged.  Then voila!  FRESH TASTY SALAD everyone raved about!!!

this is the right amount of broccoli and romaine salad.  we have been stuck on the oriental coleslaw with the pre bagged coleslaw mix.   soooo glad we tried a new recipe and now have a new favorite.  i only use 1 T of sugar and it is sweet enough. its a must to brown the noodles gives it great flavor.  try it with toasted almond slivers.  ohhh yummy

I made this last night because I find it hard to keep salads creative. The dressing was delicious. I did use splenda and added chopped red peppers, cayenne and almonds to the salad.  I'll be making this again.

This is a seriously good salad.  I followed other's advise and halved the sugar and made 1 1/2 dressing recipe. I used grape seed oil and rice vinegar and the dressing was very very good and light.  Made the salad just directed except for cooking the ramen and walnuts together.  I also threw in a handful of golden raisins just before serving.  Will be making this often.

I never write a review whether I like or dislike something.  I just never seem to find the time.  This rating is my exception.  The salad was incredible and I just felt the need to write a review.  I made it for the first time tonight and my family loved it.  I can't wait to make it for a dinner party.  It will definitely be a constant on my menu.   I used almonds instead of walnuts and I browned them with the noodles and butter.  I use some extra vegetables but it is not a necessity.  Fabulous recipe.

This was a yummy recipe. I think it would be good without changing a thing... but I just can't cook like that! I made it with broccoli slaw... was easier than chopping, and had bits of other veggies. I subbed red wine vinegar, olive oil, and coconut oil cuz it was all that I had, and I mixed the seasoning package right in. Also sauted walnuts with noodles and tossed in some sesame seeds. I think this would be great with some 5 spice added as well.

Awesome. I just made this and ate some for lunch and am taking the rest to work tonight. I always make as is the first time, so the only thing i know i will do different is too use a little less sugar, maybe try splenda as another reviewer stated and try to cut the oil a little to lessen the fat content. I did steam the broccoli for about 2m--just enough to make 'em turn a nice green. I'm not a fan of raw broccoli. Otherwise really great salad, cheap and easy too!

This is a great sweet salad to accompany savory dishes- wonderful for brunch. We served it with some chicken crepes and asparagus soup, and it was a great meal. Make sure not to dress it to early or it will get soggy.

I made this salad when we had friends over for dinner and they all loved it and wanted the recipe.  I did tweek it a little by adding shredded carrots and sliced mushrooms and a 1/4 cup of sunflower seeds.  Can't wait to make this again...it was so delicious!

I have been making this salad for 10 years and I get asked to make it again and again for every family party or event I cater.  The only thing I do differently is use 3/4 c. slivered almonds instead of walnuts and I sautee them with the noodles.  I also add one packet of the seasoning, from the ramen noodles, to the dressing!

I brought this salad to a BBQ last night and it got great reviews. I used pecans instead of walnuts and browned them with the ramen noodles, which gave them a great flavor.
I used less sugar than called for, but I think I will use only half of the sugar next time and a little less cider vinegar. I will also increase the soy sauce a bit and try using olive oil instead of canola. Even though I used only 6 green onions instead of 8 (I had doubled the recipe) it tasted like too much. 
I put the salad together at the party and served it immediately so the noodles would retain their crunch.
I will definitely make this salad again. Delish!!!

This salad was delicious!  I made it for a big family dinner and everyone liked it - wow, that's a miracle!  I added cucumber and some dried cranberries.  It was really great for something a little different than the usual plain salad!

I gave this 4 stars but it was wonderful!  I just made some changes per the other reviews on the site.  I only used 2 Tbsp sugar and used EVOO instead of vegetable.  I didn't use onions.  This was one of the only salads that was gone at our family reunion.  I overheard people talking about it!  I cooked some sliced almonds with the ramen noodles and added 1 packet of oriental seasoning from the ramen noodles in enough dressing for 4 batches.  For 3 bowls of salad, I used 4 pounds of pre-cute romain, 4 packages ramen, 2 broccoli crowns, and just multiplied everything else by 4.  I don't think you will be disappointed by this recipe, but with some small changes.

I recently served this at a family function and had to run to the computer and print off the recipe at least 4 times. Just keep your ingredients seperate untill ready to serve. I didn't use all of the dressing but my father took it home. Said it was the BEST he had ever had.

Fantastic salad - provided you make a few changes suggested by others.  Definitely cut the sugar in half.  I'm a major sweet tooth, and even this was too much.  I also toasted the ramen noodles by using PAM spray - turned out just as well as using butter.  I also thought this recipe made too much dressing, so I just doubled the salad part - PERFECT!

I also mixed romain and iceburg lettuce and substituted toasted almonds for the walnuts.  Everyone loved this salad. Next time I will add chicken or perhaps some mandarin orange segments. The only suggestion I would make is to mix the dressing in as desired, the amount needed would be based on the amount of lettuce used anyway.

I cut the sugar in half and followed another viewers suggestion to use toasted almond slivers--very good!  My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe.  I made & dressed too much salad for the two of us to eat at dinner, but was happy to discover that my salad was still crunchy for lunch the next day.

I almost regret making this because now I get requests every day to make it AGAIN! It is absolutely a fabulous salad, and a great way to eat your broccoli! I find it easy to toss the dressing ingredients in my food processor - and the dressing lasts in the fridge (if there's any left!). Do NOT leave off the ramen noodles! They add another great element - just remember to toast them slowly and thoroughly.

AWESOME! I used 2 TBSP. of "sugar/splenda Blend" instead of the 1/2 cup of sugar.  I forgot to add the soy sauce, but did not miss it.  I left out the salt & pepper and added the seasoning packet from the ramen to the dressing.  Let the dressing rest at room temp for about 45 minutes to give the flavors time to meld and thicken.  I used almonds instead of walnuts & toasted them in the skillet with the noodles, left out the butter & used butter flavor cooking spray instead.  No broccoli at the store, so left that out and added a little shredded purple cabbage and carrot instead. I did chop the romaine in small pieces to make this a "chop salad".   At the last minute I decided to toss in some craisins (yummy).  This recipe will be repeated here often!!  Thanks for sharing!

Love this! I knew I had most ingredients on hand, but did change slightly to try to reduce calories a bit.  I browned the noodles and walnuts in Pam butter flavored spray, and instead of sugar, I used two packets of Splenda.  I didn't have green onions, so used red onion.   Great recipe, and very easy! (Just watch the noodle/walnut mixture, and stir often - it'll burn fast!)

This was very good! I made it as the recipe stated but used olive oil instead of vegetable. I was hesitant about the amount of sugar, but it did not have a gritty taste to it which I was afraid of. I made my dressing a few hours ahead of time and then every now and again I would give it a good stir.I made it for my bookclub meeting and it was the first thing gone. I will definitely make again. The noodles were a nice, unusual addition.

Good salad. If your are worried that the dressing may be too sweet, make it with only 2 TBS of sugar. I found that to be perfect. You can always add more if you want it sweeter.

SOOOOO GOOD. My new favorite salad, would go great with teriyake steak, other Japanese dishes. I did everything as the recipe stated except only used 1/8 cup splenda, 1/8 cup sugar, would not have wanted it any sweeter. LOVE the ramen crunch. I could see substituting so many things for the broccoli, but I would definitely leave the rest alone.

I can't say enough good things about this salad. I followed the recipe, [because I don't know how to make alot of dressing.]and I wouldn't change a thing. I used whatever lettuce I had.[I don't even know what kind I had]It was great. Put some in my husbands lunch this morning, and picked at it, even with the not so crunchy toppings any more, it was still good. I will diffently be making again.

I've made this recipe from many years ago, originally from a church cook book but it is nearly identical except it calls for less dressing, which I saw in reviews. I've done a variety of things with it, including adding chopped celery, canned water chestnuts, and even using cabbage instead of romaine. Regardless, if you make the recipe as it is written I think you will be pleased. I always use walnuts (toasted in a dry pan), not almonds, it is a different creaminess, flavor and crunch. I made it the tonight with red romaine that I found at the grocery store which was healthier and more colorful.

Great recipe!  I cut back the sugar to 2 tbsp, used pecans instead of walnuts, and added some cooked chicken strips.  It made a very light & tasty meal!

This salad was excellent! The only changes I made was to substitute red onion for the green onion as I wanted some color, olive oil for the vegetable oil, and red wine vinegar for the cider vinegar. I took this to a friends house and there wasn't a bite left!!

We really liked this salad!  I changed two little things; first, I cut down the sugar in the dressing by a couple of tablespoons, and second, I used almonds instead of walnuts.  DELICIOUS!

Very filling salad! Can be eaten as a meal. Definitely need the romaine and broccoli  for the crunch, do not substitute either of these ingredients or you won't get the proper consistency.

Good recipe, I also thought it was to sweet--so I added hot sauce and dijon mustard to the mix. It tasted great--no one complained and the bowl was empty.

This was okay because I like salads in general.  But this particular recipe didn't "wow" me.  The dressing was lacking a kick and it was just a bit bland overall.  But certainly good for getting my vitamins and potassium.

This salad is good. I made it for a bbq potluck and it was well liked by everyone. It's pretty much like the oriental cabbage salad that's made with the raman noodles. They are so good in salad. I did leave out the walnuts, but I think it would be good with slivered almonds instead.

This salad was simple, easy to make, and tastes great. Everything that a good recipe should be, IMHO. I did do a few things differently from the original recipe though. I used whole wheat spaghetti instead of Ramen Noodles. I cooked and seasoned my spaghetti then added to the salad. Also, I used a yellow onion instead of green onions and I used extra-virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. The salad was still good though. I will definitely make this again.

This is a great and easy salad for home or sharing; easy to adjust amounts. A similar recipe (also great) calls for 1/3 c. canola/evoo, 1/4 tsp. sesame oil, 3 Tbl. cider vinegar, 1 Tbl. soy, 1 Tbl. sugar. This also called for a pkg. of ramen flavoring (oriental or chicken). For more crunch, add 1/2 c. toasted sesame seeds. DO smash the ramen noodles and DO use almonds vs. walnuts. You can substitute either coleslaw for all of the suggested greens, or use the romaine plus mixed gourmet lettuces to go with the broccoli. Enjoy!!

This was so good! I could have ate the whole bowl myself! Everyone loved it. I read some of the reviews and cut the sugar to 1/4 of a cup and it was plenty sweet. Used olive oil instead of vegetable and used sunflower seeds. I also made the dressing a few hours ahead and chilled it. Will be making this ALOT! Thank you!

Loved this salad.  Took the advice of others and halved the sugar, used olive oil instead of vegetable.  Some other tweaks....used 2 heads of romaine, 1/2 diced red bell pepper, 1 c. diced fresh mushrooms and 2 grilled chicken breasts chopped.  Then when I tossed the salad I only used about half of the dressing.  Great summmer meal!

This was a great salad!  Since others said the dressing was sweet, I couldn't resist adding Craisins and mandarin oranges to the salad, and a bit of orange juice to the dressing.  I used toasted slivered almonds and it was a huge hit.  I was lucky to get one serving before it was gone!

I halved the recipe as I was just making it for my hubby (can't eat onions) and the fixings came out fine-obviously had to use a whole ramen noodle pkg-I will make it again, but next time around I will let him add the dressing himself over the portion he is eating.  Put the walnuts right into the salad.  I always let people add their own amount of dressing.  I should have known better.

My husband hates vinegar and loved this salad and dressing.  He even licked his fork!  Made a few changes - used water instead of oil to lighten up the dressing, browned the noodles and almonds in the oven (based on other comments) and added red onion, red cabbage and shredded carrots to the salad.

Yum - I made this as a side to a frittata for dinner last night and it was really tasty!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used almonds instead of walnuts.  The only other changes I made were to omit the salt from the dressing and I used about 1/2 packet of the soup base seasoning from the noodles (I also cut the entire recipe in half).  Lastly, I steamed the broccoli for a few minutes as DH and I aren't huge fans of raw broccoli.  It still had lots of bite, but just took the 'edge' off the rawness!  The end result was really yummy...the only downside was trying to keep our hands off the noddle/nut combination until dinner could be served!!

This is the best salad ever! My mom and I have been making it ever since it was published in a local cookbook. Locally, it is the most popular salad. Inevitably, everyone brings it to a potluck, shower, etc. Even my anti-fancy-salad husband loves it! I always make one and half times the dressing because one recipe just isn't enough. It makes a very large salad, so if I make it for just us (or me!), I store the nuts/ramen noodle mix, lettuce, and broccoli & green onions separately.

Delicious, I used Pecans instead of Walnuts and half the sugar as recommended and it was perfect.

I made this for our Board Meeting. Serving 16 people and it was a HIT!  I followed the recipe as it was listed.

I love this salad! It's a perfect salad to go along with an asian-style main course. I changed it up a little by adding a (cold) can of mandarin oranges, and I used about a 1/2 cup of sliced almonds instead of the walnuts. I sauted the almonds in the butter along with the noodles.I can't wait to make it again!

This is so very good. The combo is fun, yet quite a beautiful presentation. I get the "what is that crunchy stuff?" queston all the time......lol. I never ate ramen before....but apparently I'm the only one!

Very good, I changed the amounts of the dressing ingredients but used them all. I used alfalfa sprouts instead of lettuce.  It turned out fantastic. Very easy, very tasty.  Thanks

Yummy, I servced this at an adoption party and was asked by several for the recipe. Even if I make a regular side salad, I am almost required to make the dressing. It's all enjoyed.

Great salad! I used a lot of lettuce because it looked like so much dressing. I only used about a tablespoon of sugar in the dressing itself and it seemed to taste fine.

Instead of walnuts, I substituted a cup of sliced almonds, which I tossed in with the ramen noodles and butter for toasting--delicious!

OK.  I should have used crunchier noodles than what I had in the house.

Too sweet for my taste, thought the noodles were a little odd.

Wow. I loved this dressing (as well as the salad). Great! I actually used 1/4 cup sugar and substituted the veggie oil for extra virgin olive oil. It tasted wonderful. I will be making this dressing for other salads.

Fantastic salad!  I made this for Thanksgiving without trying it first.  It was a huge hit.  Everyone loved it.  My husband keeps asking me to make more.  The toasted ramen noodles are so good I have to make more than called for because we nibble on them.  I use olive oil and/or vegetable oil, depending on what I have available.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe!  Fantastic tasting dressing!
Recipe made twice as much dressing as was needed, but that's
great because now we have a favorite everyday salad dressing
for other salads.  Will keep in my 'favorites' file!
