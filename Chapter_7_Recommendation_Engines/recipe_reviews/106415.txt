Very good flavor.  Not overly sweet, a great compromise to reduce calories.

This was fantastic!  The bread had just the right hint of lemon flavor which was complimented by the walnuts.  Wonderful taste.

Very good. Beautiful presentation, nice texture, very good taste. I expected it to be sweeter, but the flavor is very good. The lemon flavor is subtle and nice
