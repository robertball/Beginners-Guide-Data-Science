I made cupcakes out of these and they were awesome. I mixed all the ingredients except the vinegar. Stirred  it in at the last minute which is why I think it had such a nice rise. Added 1/2 c cranberries and 1/2 c of walnuts. Delicious. Also made a glaze of powdered sugar, water and almond extract with a pinch of salt . Amped the cupcakes up nicely.

I have been making this cake for years! It is the best chocolate cake ever. My vegan friend loves it and so do my children. I love that you don't need milk and eggs! Company's Coming cookbooks by Jean Pare have a similar recipe.

I was given this recipe not long after I was married.  A fabulous recipe when eggs are either not in the house due to having run out OR if there is an egg allergy.  Thank you for posting!
