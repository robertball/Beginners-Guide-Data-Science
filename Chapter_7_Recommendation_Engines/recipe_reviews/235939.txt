So good!! I have made these a few times the only thing I did different was to put 1/4 cup peanut butter into the corn syrup mixture.

These were always one of my favorite bars that my mom made when I was a kid. I was thrilled to find this recipe here, which is the exact recipe that Mom used from a church cookbook. I’ve made these a few times over the past few months, and everyone loves them. They’re the perfect combo of salty and sweet!

I tried this recipe as part of a dessert tray for a work potluck and at the end of the day there were so many left I struggled to give them away.  I thought they tasted fine, but maybe just depends on your crowd.  I lined my baking dish with parchments and I'm so glad I did because that marshmallow layer stuck to everything including me while I was trying to cut these into little squares.

I found a very similar recipe on back of peanut butter chips.  Their version used 18.25 oz cake box (which is hard to find these days - I used 2 9 oz Jiffy boxes).  It callec for 1/2 c butter and 4 c marshmallows.  Just 1 tsp valnilla.  but otherwise the same.

These are so good! I have to say I have made them several times and always get rave reviews. The only thing and I always do this, is omit the rice cereal.. I am sure it would still be good we just like them better without, no modifications needed to the recipe.
