Excellent mulled cider.  I use 1/2 the amount of honey as we don't prefer it as sweet as the recipe calls for. I also added a bit of fresh orange juice. Yummy warmer-upper!

It was a little sweet for my family so I added 2 cups of water and two Mardarine Orange Spice tea bagsand then it was perfection and a nice change from the classic apple cider. Be careful of the floating cloves in your mug!

Made this for folks to enjoy before Thanksgiving dinner. Made it in the crockpot set on low for several hours. It was wonderful and enjoyed by the adults.  Little folks turned their nosed up at the tartness.  I only used about 1/2 - 3/4 c. of honey.  Any more would have been too sweet.  Will definitely make this again!!!

This is a great cold weather treat.  I used blueberry honey because I had it on hand.  After a few hours in the crockpot, the craisins were great.  I will use a cheesecloth-type bag to hold the whole cloves when I make it again.

I love this recipe!  I have made it the past two years for Christmas and my family loves it as well.  The only thing I changed on it was I omitted the honey and maybe a little less cranberries or none at it.  It is a pretty sweet cider already, but very tasty!

Awesome!!!! The whole family loved this and ooo'd with every sip! I used tangerine zest but also juiced about 4 tangerines and put it in the mixture and used cran apple juice. I also used less honey. You could put cinnamon sticks in the serving cups as a garnish and it would be fun :)

This was a huge hit with my in-laws! I wish I had doubled it, because it went fast.

Very good and great on a cold day. I think next time I may a little less cranberries, but it is easy and very tasty!

mmmm...wonderful on a cold day.  The only changes I made was that I didn't have enough honey so I used some corn syrup to sweeten it up and I used about 1/2 cup of it.

I love cranberries in any form. I also love mulled cider and wines. This was a very nice change from the usual and so darned easy. I did have to change one thing because I didn't realize I was out of dried cranberries so I used dried cherries. Very tasty on a cold winter day. The only draw back to me is that it was VERY sweet. Next time I make it....and I will, I will cut the honey in half. Thanks so much for sharing!

I usually mull wine for the holidays but I was pregnant and couldn't drink, so I tried this instead.  It is very tasty and was a big hit at my office Christmas party.  I added honey to taste and probably ended up with a little less than the recipe calls for.  Afterward I put the leftovers back into the juice bottle and heated it up in mugs later.

My family generally likes cranberry. But no one cared for this recipe. I had to add more honey and still people didnâ€™t care for it.

Tasty but way too sweet (at least with cranapple juice) and way too many dried cranberries.  I would try it without any honey first and then add if needed...I started with half the honey.
