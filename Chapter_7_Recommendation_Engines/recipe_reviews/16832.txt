I made this last year to bring to my rabbi's seder, and have actually made it twice since Pesach. This is absolutely sinful! SO yum!

A few tips in the interest of keeping it kosher for Passover: First, use kosher for Passover wine. Anything made with grapes are very particular when it comes to the kosher certification, and of course Passover comes with its own set of extra rules. Check your hescher! Likewise with the confectioner's sugar, although unless you live in an area with a very dense Jewish population (like parts of New York), chances are good that your confectioners sugar has corn starch in it. Rather than hunting high and low and paying an outrageous cost for it, toss a cup of white sugar into a blender (more if you're planning on storing any, in which case add as many tablespoons of potato starch as you used cups of sugar to prevent clumping) and let it go until it's powdery and pour it out on to a plate or into a shallow bowl to roll the dates around in. (Or pour it into a jar for later use!)

This was delicious--but i didnt quite know what to do with them!! This would be great to put out on the table for people to pick at with dessert, but i just stored them in a cookie tin for a while (They got surprisingly better with age!) I used white Eis Wein (ice wine), because that's what i had on hand. I think you can use just about anything, even grape juice! Really delicious, sooooo smooth and yummy tasting!! A bit sticky to form into balls, though, and the confectioners sugar didn't stick properly to them because of the moistness...Still VERY good, and i will make this again!!!

I made this for Passover last year, and everyone loved it. I'm making it again this year. I actually left out the nuts because I'm allergic to them, and it still came out great.

I am sure they will taste better tomorrow. I used some grape/apple juice to substitute for part of the wine.

Used 1/4 cup maple syrup instead of sugar.  Loved it!
