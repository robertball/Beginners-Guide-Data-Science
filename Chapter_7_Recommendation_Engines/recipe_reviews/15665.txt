I made my own pie shell from crushed oreos and a little butter and pressed it into a pie dish, baked it for 8 minutes and cooled it. I used chunky peanut butter and for a richer pie, I used cold evaporated milk. Right before I stuck it in the fridge, I sprinkled chopped Reese's PB cups over the top. Very easy and used pantry/fridge ingredients I had on hand. We're on a tight budget for a bit so I've got to use what I've got--this fit the bill. I'll update my review once we've had it for dessert. NOTE: This was good but with my changes it was better. I don't think it would have been half as good had I not made my own cookie crust and added chopped Reese's on the top.

Way to rich for me! It solidified fine (I used 1 cup of PB) and after a couple hours of chilling, I sprinkled some cut up Reese Peanut Butter cups over the top.  Looked fancy and my sweet-tooth boyfriend liked it but tooooo rich for me. Although he would like to see me make this one again, I think I'll keep searching for dessert receips we BOTH enjoy.  Thanks anyways.

Next time I make it, I will use less milk.  It was too runny.  Otherwise, it was pretty good.

This is a sinful pie.  If you like chocolate and peanut butter this is the pie for you.  Very easy and not time consuming.

This was just so-so. If you love all things peanut butter, you'll really enjoy this. I LOVE chocolate and peanut butter (Reese's PB cups are one of my favorite candies), but for some reason I didn't care for the combo here. The PB taste was overpowering, IMHO. Reducing it might help, but I don't think I'll be reattempting this again to find out. As with any new recipe I try, I made a couple of changes. My biggest change was substituting a chocolate cookie crust for the graham cracker one called for (it seemed to be a more suitable match for the filling ingredients...). My other change was out of necessity. I substituted evaporated milk for regular milk because I didn't have the latter on hand. NOTE: My pie set up really well, but I did let it sit in the fridge overnight. Serving individual slices with a dollop of Cool-Whip and cut up PB cups made for a nice presentation. Thanks for sharing your idea, BUCHKO! :)

Made this tonight as a test run for house guests this weekend. It gets a green light and I will make it for my in laws. Its very rich and yummy... stays together ok enough as long as you give it a good amount of time to chill and I'm guessing don't leave it out on the counter too long or runny city?! Already had a friend request the recipe from the taste test so it can't be bad!

This pie was okay.  I am definitely a chocolate-peanut butter lover and I altered certain things so maybe the blame is on me.  I used sugar-free pudding, 1 c. of peanut butter and did not use a pie crust.  It is important for me to not consume too much sugar, because I have had gastric bypass and too much sugar makes me sick.  Even after sitting overnight, it was still the consistency of pudding, rather than a pie.  The flavor was good but I was hoping for a more peanut-buttery taste, especially since I used Reese's peanut butter!  I absolutely recommend this as a tasty, low-sugar pudding, but I'll skip on the pie.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This had a good peanut butter-chocolate flavor, but it was not as chocolatey as I had expected.

Amazingly enough, my chocolate lover husband did not care too much for this pie, and I, a definite non chocolate eater, thought it was pretty good.  It was quick and easy to make, and I may try it again with a few variations.

My 7 year old daughter wanted to make something special for Thanksgiving.  This is what she decided to make.  It was easy for her to make and was the hit of Thanksgiving.  We topped it off with whipped topping, then she had the idea to sprinkle chopped peanut butter cups on top.  It was perfect.  Thanks!

It was yummy, but I only gave 3 stars because it was more like pudding in a pie shell.  I used a chocolate crust and sprinkled Reese candies on top.  I'm not sure why it came out like pudding.  It has a great chocolate-peanutbutter taste for sure!  I'll make it again, and try Coolwhip instead of milk as others suggested.

I made this pie for a family birthday party with one change. I added half an 8 oz. container of Cool Whip.  It was a really big hit.

if you add bananas to the bottom of the pie crust makes and whipped topping to the mix its a lot better.  this is a basic recipe you will find on the back of a ready made pie crust such as keeblers

I misplaced this recipe, so I made it from memory.  I used 1 cup peanut butter and 2 cups milk.  It was already thick by the time I scooped it into the pie.  The peanut butter was a little strong.  Next time, I'll make sure to follow the recipe.  I put it in a baked graham cracker crust.
