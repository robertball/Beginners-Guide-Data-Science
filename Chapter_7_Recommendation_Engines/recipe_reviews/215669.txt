I had a lot of pumpkin puree, so I looked for some recipes.  I love how you can place everything in the crock pot and then forget about it. It has a very different taste, and plenty of spice.  We couldn't find fava beans, so I used garbanzo beans, and they tasted really good! I couldn't even taste the veggie meat, but it's healthy and was definitely in there! This tastes good on a cool fall or winter night.

This could be an awesome dish with a few tweaks.  I had trouble mixing the ingredients because there simply wasn't enough liquid - I ended up adding 8 cups of water just to get the ingredients to mix.  I couldn't find fava beans in my area so I substituted butter beans.     I didn't have pumpkin pie spice in the house so I made my own from nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger and clove, making sure to use only 1 TBS of my spice mixture.  I added double the chili powder.  In the end, the dish was terribly underflavored.   Adding salt at the table helped but wasn't enough.  Next time I make this I will quadruple the chili powder, double the black pepper and add a bit of cayenne.   I will also probably quadruple the amount of vegetable juice and add vegetable broth as well.  Additionally I will add more spinach - we like spinach.

I made this exactly as written and found it to be quite good.  I didn't think the pie spice was overwhelming, but you can definitely taste the pumpkin which I love.  It's not something I would make on a regular basis, but if you want something a little different and extremely healthy, this is a great recipe.

I think the 2 tablespoons of pumpkin spice could be reduced to one. My whole house smelled like I was baking an apple pie from the cinnamon.

This was very easy to make and turns out wonderful.  I omitted the vegetarian crumbles and okra.  Added everything else, and I even made a mistake by adding the spinach in at the start of cooking, and it turned out just fine.  Will definitely be making this one again in the future!

I prepared this for my friends annual Chili Cookoff. We did not win, but I'm still very proud of my creation. Infact, this maybe my very first creation--ever. So, yes it was that simple. And I even strayed from the recipe--another first! 
We added a can of corn, a can of black beans, nutmeg and cinnamon. 
It had amazing texture, and a great combination of sweet/spicy! Definitely making this again!

Not bad.  Definitely something that can be tweaked (and probably should).  The best part was the smell of the house!  Most of the vegetables can be swapped based on your tastes.  The one change I would definitely make for next time is to reduce to 1 tbsp pumpkin spice.  I found it fairly overwhelming and by the end of the dish I felt quite saturated by spice.  My wife seemed to enjoy it more than I did so I may make it again in the future (though she agreed...too spicy).

This was pretty good! The only change I made was using butter beans instead of fava beans, & it worked out well! I didn't think they pumpkin pie spice was overpowering at all, & in my opinion, it could have used more. I also had to salt & pepper it more at the end. I wish this had more reviews; it's a good & easy dish!

I was a bit disappointed with this. I think it has potential though.  


I adapted things a bit: I used fresh tomatoes (skins removed) instead of canned, fresh pumpkin instead of canned. I used butter beans because i couldn't find fava beans.  

I thought the pumpkin pie spice was too strong.  I was going to omit the meatless crumbles but decided to add them in hopes of taming the pie spice and salvage it.  Unfortunately I anticipated loving this and double it to freeze. It is very healthy so i gave it 4 stars.

This is good stuff.  A unique flavor combination and nutritional powerhouse of a recipe. I had my doubts, I admit, but it came together beautifully. I omitted okra because ew, and I used about 5 cups of vegetable broth instead of the veggie juice. The consistency is perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used real ground beef instead of veggie ground round, and doubled the chilli powder as per some recommendations, but other than that, I went with the recipe exactly, and I loved it. I found it had a lot of flavour, and the rest of the family did as well.

Needs much more chili powder - very bland as written.  But the concept is good and I'll make it again.

I love this recipe, my family looks forward to it every Fall.  Though I make it without including okra, zucchini and carrots.

This tasted weird, probably because it had way too much pumpkin pie spice. If I make it again, I'll only do 1 tbsp at most. Otherwise it was fine, but that ruined it for my husband and me.

I really did not like the mix of flavors with this recipe.  My husband said that it tasted better the next day, but I really had a difficult time eating it (I gave it two, instead of one star because my husband found it edible).  It looked like it had potential, but I really don't know what I would do to even doctor it up!

I wish there was a rating of negative stars.  This soup was the most horrible stuff I have ever tried to eat.  I was excited because it looked tasty and different.  Well, it's certainly different... I literally couldn't eat it, and I will usually eat stuff that turns out badly because I'm too cheap to waste food if it's edible.  This did not qualify as edible, in my opinion.
