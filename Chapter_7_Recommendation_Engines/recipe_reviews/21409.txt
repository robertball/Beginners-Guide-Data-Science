Tried it last year and liked it so much I kept the recipe, so tried it again this year - fabulous.  Cooked in a covered casserole for a while and then uncovered.  Used seasoned stuffing breadcrumbs as I didn't have the Italian ones.  I have always enjoyed stuffing as part of the Thanksgiving meal, but this is the best I can recall. Low fat, good flavor, celery was just perfect cooked this way. I'll be glad to use it more often.  Thanks for sharing.
