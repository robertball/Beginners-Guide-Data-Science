Well, they look great on a St Patrick's Day cookie platter, but, the taste is really marginal.  I never thought I would ever say this about anything chocolate.. but, they are just too chocolate- almost bitter.  Sorry, not a keeper in my recipe box.

I made these for a St. Patrick's Day dinner this year. Easy and quite good! The chocolate is more bitter, but wonderful with the Kiss chocolate on top! I used a cut corner of a plastic baggie to put on the frosting. Great looking and great tasting! We enjoyed them!

Other reviews said these cookies were bitter...I did NOT think so.  They were delicious.  I used mint chocolate kisses and used mint extract in the frosting instead of vanilla.  It was a very nice mint-chocolate flavor.  Yummy and moist!

These cookies were fantastic - my husband and I could not stop eating them! I decided to skip the hershey kisses and, instead, covered the cookies lightly with a green mint glaze - YUM!

These cookies were relatively easy to make. I made the dough a day ahead, and then baked them off the next day. I found that if you push the Kisses into the cookie, rather than just placing it on top, the cookie tends to split in half when picked up. The taste is not bad, but not outstanding either. I changed the name to "Kiss My Blarney Stone" cookies.I would keep these as a stand by, but I don't think they will be a St. Patrick's Day staple.

This is basically a chocolate refrigerator cookie all dressed up for St. Patrick's Day.  The cookies look adorable, but I think the chocolate kiss overwhelms them a bit, and would leave it off next time.  The cookie itself is delicious - could probably be adapted for Halloween with an orange glaze.

I thought this cookie tasted like an imitation of what a real chocolate cookie should taste like.  It was a very bland cookie, and the only "sweetness" that the cookie had was the hershey kiss:(

A little confused by reviews that say this cookies is bitter. Perhaps your cocoa isn't the best quality? I used Ghiardelli, mine were very nice, a little bland if anything. However these cookies are supposed to be a chocolate version of a shortbread cookie, which is traditionally not a very sweet cookie. Sometimes I think Americans are so used to their food being loaded with sugar they can't appreciate more delicate flavors...the icing on top gave it just enought sweetness for us. In fact I left off the kiss for my husband and me, only the kids wanted them. A cute little cookie for St. Patty's day!

I left the cocoa out of these because I was out of it, but I added a few chocolate chips to add chocolate flavor.  My husband liked them better than my regular chocolate chip cookies!

Not very good at all, the cookies taste like cocoa powder with a bitter after taste. The frosting makes it a little better, but not much.
