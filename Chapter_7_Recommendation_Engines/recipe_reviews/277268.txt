A great dessert. My husband said it reminded him of an apple fritter. Best right of of oven and lightly cooled.   Easy to do.

Made this Christmas morning for the grandchildren  - they loved it.  Will make again next week for our Christmas  with the great-grandchildren.  I'm sure they will enjoy it also.
Made it exactly like the recipe, very easy, quick and impressive,  but inexpensive.
