I am fairly new at cooking and I did not find this easy.  I had a hard time getting the dough right, so the finished product was ugly, but it still tasted OK!  I thought the filling tasted a little flour-y though and it's very sweet.  It's interesting, but I probably won't make it again.

This recipe needs correction!!  It states to use 6 oz of butterscotch chips, DIVIDED - but it does not state the quantities that are to be divided.  I guessed, by using approx 5-1/2 oz for the filling and approx 1/4 c for the icing.  I also did not use anywhere near the 7 teaspoons of corn syrup that were called for - I probably used a couple of teaspoons.  Also - I found it much easier to spread the filling on each triangle, roll up and then overlap with the others to form a ring onto the baking sheet.  The method as stated did not work well for me at all.  The taste was just "ok" to everyone I served them to.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Shannon Marie.

I added cinnamon and powdered sugar to the top. Also, I only used 2 teaspoons of corn syrup. Tastes great!!
