This was very good--warm and comforting and flavorful. Some changes I made: Didn't use celeriac Used dried thyme instead of fresh Didn't know how to spread all that butter in the pan, so I spread some of it in the pan, and dumped the rest into the saucepan with the liquids.

I really liked this but altered it significantly. Used yams, white potatoes, celeriac, and artichokes; took out the cream; subbed olive oil for the butter; and added garlic and black pepper. Very tasty fall side dish.

This was ok. Not spectacular. I used acorn squash instead of butternut because that's what I had around. I just didn't feel like this had as much flavor as I wanted.

I liked this because I like the veggies that went into it, but I didn't think the broth mix added much flavor. I used homemade broth and coconut milk instead of cream (my standard sub), but I found the thyme and nutmeg didn't stand out at all. I also subbed sweet potato for half of the red potato, and it really added to the dish. Thanks, but I don't plan to make this again.

This was rather good. I made it exactly as written except I used a different squash. I did find that it started to brown too quickly in my oven. The temp seemed a bit high.

This was just okay.  It smells amazing, but I found the taste almost sweet, which just isn't for me.  To be fair, I did use completely different vegetables (just what I had on hand) - turnip, parsnip, carrots and onion.  Also, I only used half and half instead of heavy cream. Probably won't make this one again.

This was delicious! Even my boyfriend, who was suspiciously eyeing me as I was cutting the celeriac, loved it. I kept the main ingredients the same but made a few changes to the sauce. I subbed coconut milk for heavy cream, added two cloves of garlic, a pinch of cayenne, about 1/2 tsp of salt,  a few shakes of crushed red pepper, and some fresh ground pepper. Oh and I also subbed the fresh thyme for dried thyme (about 1/3 tsp)

This came out really good!!  I used all the veggies suggested and split it into two smaller casseroles.  I split the sauce between them and added a little more cream since I needed more liquid.  I mixed the parmesan in with the layers.  I baked covered at first and uncovered for the second half at the lower temp and it came out perfect.   Great flavor.
