Shahi tukri(pronounced as "Shahi tukde") is the Indian version of the decadent bread pudding.It is a dish of the Mughal era.It is a hot favorite in our family.But our recipe is slightly different from the one mentioned here.The bread slices are fried in ghee(clarified butter).This gives a nice aroma to the dish.The fried pieces are dipped in sugar syrup(to which cardamom is added).Take them out and drizzle condensed milk over it lavishly.Garnish with pistachios and saffron.  The recipe stated here also turned out well :)
