I made this without the bacon and thought it was a nice healthy option.  As the submitter states, this is a dense cornbread.  Knowing baking powder is a better choice with buttermilk I used 1 tsp and omitted the soda.  The bread is nicely moist from the sweet potato.  I used an 8 inch cast iron skillet and baked at 400.  It was perfectly done in 20 min.

I subbed soymilk for the buttermilk, so used baking powder instead of baking soda.  Then I subbed smoked turkey for the bacon.  This bread is sweet without being overpowering!  This was moist enough so the bread was not crumbly! Great inspiration for a great tasting bread!  Thanks for the recipe!

I noticed before cooking this recipe, that it didn't call for any flour (which I usually use in corn breads). However, I followed the recipe exactly; except for cooking it an extra 7 minutes because the middle was still a bit mushy. I'm sure this is my error, but it didn't ever rise properly and the outside was over-cooked (but not burnt) while the inside took longer. I was careful not to over mix and I most definitely didn't leave anything out nor adapt or substitute anything. 
How do you get it to rise? And how do I keep it from cooking unevenly? I used a 12" cast iron. Maybe a smaller one?

I liked the sweet potato idea and would try it again (seems to make a nice moistness) with a few other changes, like half/half instead of buttermilk and leave out the bacon drippings.  I can taste them too much.  I like my corn bread sweeter.
This particular version might be good with peppers or something added and the bacon grease left out.

I suspect the recipe meant yams instead of sweet potatoes.  I used sweet potatoes and the bread was savory.  Basically no sweetness, and I have a pretty sensitive palate (I'm no sugar addict). Using sweet potatoes I would add sugar OR try yams instead. I'm going to make some honey butter to use on this batch.

What a wonderful spin on cornbread! My family loved it. However, after 10 minutes I had to turn my oven down considerable to prevent the cornbread from burning.

Even with the bacon it had no flavor. Very bland. Would not make this again.
