Make a double batch!  Trust me, the first one won't last long.  Here are a few tips for greater success:  Bake the crescent rolls a few minutes longer before adding the toppings; it will make the crust better.  Add the tips to the saut'e process for only a flash; it keeps them crisp and yummy.  A pizza cutter works really well to cut the squares, and last but not least, just print the recipe and take with; EVERY body wants it!

I made a few changed but the recipe is still amazing to begin with!  I used 1 package of crescent dough, a full pound of asparagus and 1/4 cup diced onion.  I omitted the butter and sauteed the onion and garlic in a bit of olive oil with some Cavender's Greek seasoning--then added the asparagus and cooked until my texture preference.  I baked the crescent crust (on a pizza stone) for 6 minutes.  I used almost 4 oz. of spinach-artichoke cream cheese as the sauce and then topped with the asparagus/onion mixture and cheese.  Back in the oven for 6 minutes, turned oven off and let sit on pizza stone an additional 4 minutes--PERFECT!!!!  Next time I will double the asparagus and maybe add some tomatoes.  A great, simple, delicious recipe!

I made these this morning planning on eating them later in the day, wrong, as I was cutting them of course I had to taste, ended up being my breakfast. Recipe is excellent as is. In my oven I baked the crust 10 min before putting the asparagus on. I would eat this as my meal or serve as an appetizer. Thanks for a great recipe Judy.

I did a prior viewers recipe with one crescent package and the greek seasoning (no cream cheese sauce) - nice taste but next time I will try adding a pinch of bacon bits in with the cheese for salt flavor.

A simple and tasty recipe. I cooked exactly as instructed, but wish I had read some other reviews about adding ingredients - they sound yummy! These are quite tasty as is and I will definitely be making them again.

This was soooo good! I made it with phyllo dough sheets sprayed with PAM and kept the asparagus whole. I added some freshly chopped basil and garlic to the asparagus as well. Delicious!

This was delicious! I made this as an appetizer a Mother's Day dinner. Went over really well and there were no leftovers. I usually don't like to make changes to posted recipes, but I confess I did use a can of refrigerated pizza crust (thin) from Pillsbury rather than cresent rolls, because I find the crescent rolls to be on the sweet side. I also used Gruy√®re cheese instead of Swiss, because I personally don't like Swiss cheese. Other than that I followed the recipe as posted and it was very good.  So good that all week I have been craving them and am making them again this weekend as part of a brunch party I'm having. Thank you for the delicious recipe!
