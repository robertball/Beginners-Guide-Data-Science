Amazing! Been making sous vide egg bites for a while now and these are our new favorite. The only thing I left out was the garlic powder 'cuz we're out, but I don't think we missed it. They were the perfect texture and the taste is out of this world. Thank you for the fabulous recipe!

This method was perfect, these came out with exactly the texture I was looking for.  I liked the flavor combination, but will change it up by adding others in the future.  My sun dried tomatoes were not the highest quality, so I imagine these would be even better with higher quality ingredients.  Thanks for this recipe!
