We liked this dish. I`ve never tried chickpeas with sweet things before. Very interesting flavor and very easy to make too. I guess it will be the easiest thing if you use canned chickpeas.

This was very good. The combination of ingredients was not familiar to me, but it ended up being a very nice weeknight meal. I made as directed in the recipe, except I used prepared shredded unsweetened coconut because I couldn't find any good fresh coconut at my grocery store.
