Where's the flavor? Great BASIC recipe, but I used slivered garlic in my clarified butter....saut√©ed chopped onions and sliced mushrooms in it to start, THEN  the sherry.....then the yolks, cream, nutmeg and cayenne!  To my taste, the sauce could have been quadrupled...(still using only 2 egg yolks) as we prefer lots of SAUCE....(served over angel hair topped with chopped parsley...!)

Made this tonight using frozen puff pastry to make it easier and this was delicious. Per the video I used tarragon instead because that's what I had as well as cognac instead of sherry because I had it on hand, both changes mentioned in the video, only other change was adding a little diced shallot when adding the congac. Awesome !!!!!!!   A few years ago I made a large bowl of this when I lived in CT a few years ago when lobster was cheaper than hot dogs for the 4th of July and poured it over a pile of pasta, it was incredible.

Like Carole, I added garlic, onions and mushrooms. Also, instead of sauteeing the lobster in the shell, I took the lobster meat out and chopped it, then added to onions to sautee briefly before adding the sherry and cream mixture. I thought there was enough sauce, as is. (I saved the shells to make seafood broth later.) I served over puff pastry... next time, I'll serve with a side of rissotto.

I made it for a dinner party and it was a big hit. I doubled the recipe for the sauce and added scallops and langastinos to the lobster and called it seafood newberg.

Wonderful. Doubled the sauce and added shallots and fresh mushrooms. Would definitely make again for a special occasion.

Very Decadent and easy to make!    I was able to find the puff pastry shells in my local grocery store's freezer section so I got to cut out a step.   I paired it with spinach and ricotta pasta with a portabella mushroom sauce!  Wonderful New Year's Eve dinner.  I didn't change the recipe at all.....it's good the way it's written.

Really good. Easy too.
Couldn't get just lobster tails, so bought 2 two pound lobsters (it's New England, you can't go 5 feet without finding a good  seafood monger)   Steamed them about 2/3 done (about 7 minutes) and then took out the meat.  Followed the recipe from there, finishing the cooking in the recipe, and used both tail meat and claws - it was delicious!

Beter to use fresh (live) Maine lobsters.  Frozen lobster tails are definitely not my thing.

I was looking for a little more flavor, the Sherry and Nutmeg just did not shine through for me on this one.
