We are huge Etouffee fans here. This recipe was very hot but not very flavorful. I changed it a bit to make it more appealing to my taste. I used chicken broth instead of water, added a dash of cajun seasoning, worcestershire and a bit of parsley and tomato paste (to give it some color). When the whole thing was cooked I thickened it a bit more with some cornstarch in white wine (gave it a nice finished touch) I ended up with a traditional tasting true New Orleans style Shrimp toufee. Delicious!

I had some crawfish etoufee while in nawlins last year and it wss incredible. so I decide to try and make some at home. my wife refused to eat crawfish which led me to this recipe. I reduced the recipe to 6 servings. I used chicken broth in place of water, added a heaping tablespoon of tomato paste, cut back on the paprika a good bit. I was astonished! this tasted perfect. this will be a regular for me.  Also as others have noted. when reduceing the recipe don't forget to cut back on the water/chicken broth and cook times will be greatly reduced as well.

I'm sure the sauce is excellent but I just have to tell you that cook in any size shrimp for 20 minutes will only give you the toughest shrimp imaginable...  Please be fair to the shrimp; put them in LAST and cook them only until they turn pink - 4 minutes at best.

Cut the recipe to 4 servings, used 1/2c water, then added 1/2c of wine and a couple healthy shakes of creole seasoning toward the end.  With 5 minutes left til done, I added 1lb of defrosted pre-cooked shrimp.  I don't know if my changes made the recipe better, but we sure did love it!

This recipe was delicious. I did not abide by the cooking times as I thought that the shrimp would get tough.....and it worked out just fine.  I did add about another tablespoon of butter in the beginning so the onions and celery would not burn.  I also added the cayenne pepper and garlic salt instead of regular salt.  My husband said to put the "on the list"! (he added that this was much better than his mom's and hers is to die for)  Thank you Ann.

I really liked this but BECAREFUL! If you scale down the recipe, it does not change the amount of H20 listed in the method.I screwed up by adding too much H20 and had to let it cook way down. My dumb fault but it didn't dawn on me until I poured it in. Otherwise, it's really good!

Great recipe! I substituted chicken broth for the water, added a can of chopped tomatoes (in sauce), and added some extra red pepper flakes to make it nice and spicy. It was SO yummy over brown rice!

Scaled down to four.  Substituted a bit of white wine for water and cajun seasoning for salt and pepper.  Lightly seasoned shrimp with seafood seasoning and added a 4 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  Very good with brown rice.  Boyfriend loved it and so did I.  Definately a keeper!  Thanks, Ann!

Be careful if you reduce the number of servings down from 20, as the text of the recipe does not reduce accordingly.  I liked this but my husband wasn't crazy about it.

This was great!! We added tomato sauce and crabmeat, also took the advice of others and added the cajun seasoning. Very highly recommended. Worth the prep time anyday.

The main dish in our traditionally non traditional xmas dinner 2012.  I was to cook this one, but the husband took over and that was fine as I was making rolls, mushrooms, and a chocolate cake.  He's an awesome cook, so there was no doubt he would do a supreme job ;)

This is a keeper for sure!  We've been to New Orlean's and have had a cajun cook make a meal for us at home as well......I think this was even better!

A little time consuming but well worth the effort since my husband loved it.  He took leftovers to work and everyone was commenting on how good it smelled.  Will make again.

So so yummy and so so healthy and so so low in calories!  I scaled this down for 2 people.  I added 2 green bell peppers to make it a little more authentic.  I also used olive oil instead of butter.  I served over brown rice cooked in low sodium chicken stock.  Another thing I did was make a quick shrimp stock to use in place of water.   I took the shrimp shells and put them in a bowl of water, microwaved for 3 minutes, and let sit until I was ready to add the water.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

Wow- so tasty!  I halved the recipe and cut down the cooking time for the shrimp a bit.  Served over brown rice.  Will definitely be making this again!

My brother brought this to our Christmas lunch.  He used about 2 lbs of shrimp and cut back on the heat because my husband doesn't do spicy. Served over rice, it was perfect!

I've made this recipe twice now, and I love it. Instead of seasoning with salt, pepper, and red pepper, I've stuck with Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning (and lots of it). His blend is a good balance of spicy, salty, and robust flavor. Also, I used a mixture of shrimp and crawfish, but the crawfish make it sort of gritty.

I have tried several etouffee recipes, but this is the most authentic and best tasting.  I have adjusted a little, including using lobster stock instead of water or chicken broth.  I also started using half shrimp and half scallops, which everyone loves.  Unfortunately crawfish is hard to find in Los Angeles.

This was good but I did change the recipe a bit based on other reviews: I used about 3 tablespoons of white wine to deglaze my pan after I added the flour, added some cayenne pepper for extra kick and worcestershire sauce for a bit more flavor!

I added alot of chopped parsley, took out the celery, and thickened it with slurry instead of flour. I also put in garlic salt, red pepper flakes, cayenne, hott sauce, a little cumin, and some onion powder. It was amazing with cornbread.

Thank you, Ann.  I have been always afraid of making shrimp etoufee, and this recipe made it so easy.  I added some thyme, rosemary and basil and 1 chopped tomato.  I also used a pinch of cayenne and dash of tabasco sauce.  It didn't thicken as much as I wanted, so I added some corn starch at the end.  I will definitely make it again.

Used chicken broth instead of 1/2 of the water to make the sauce a bit richer. Also added crabmeat just a few minutes before serving. Very tasty.

This is truly a five star recipe. The only four star rating was for Quickness, but keep in mind that this recipe isn't meant to be a quick recipe. It's worth spending all the necessary time to prepare this succulent dish the right way :) I can't wait for the next opportunity to make this dish!

not sure that the directions are correct....saute onions, celery and garlic for 45 minutes?
Not sure I would cook shrimp for 20 minutes either.

Oh my goodness. I have been craving etoufee and need to make some at 11 at night because I am pregnant and had a craving. This was so good. Thank you so much for posting this so that me, my fiance, and the baby in my stomach have a great meal. I think my fiance was just glad he did not have to find a restaurant open at 11pm that served etoufee. :)

Very good!  I didn't change too much in the recipe, but I did at some Cajun grill seasoning, for more flavor.  And, I used chicken stock instead of water, also for more flavor.  So easy and yummy, I'll definately make this again and again.  Thanks!

I scaled the quantity down to 1/4 of the original recipe.  Based on other reviewers' comments, I agreed that, as is, this dish needed some depth of flavors; so I used chicken broth rather than water, added homemade cajun seasoning (rather than just paprika, cayenne, S&P), a little worcestershire, some tomato paste, garlic powder along with the fresh, & a bit of white wine. I used a portabello mushroom & all that was available in my town was already-cooked shrimp, which I tossed in toward the end, after the sauce had simmered, to warm it through.  Served over sticky rice alongside steamed buttery broccoli.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Ann!

I had been looking at this recipe for a while and was getting all the ingredients together. So on my off day, I made this and talk about hmmm, hmmm good! I was trying to stick to the original recipe, I made it to the part where you add the shrimp, but my patience wore out and from there I deviated. Based on other reviews, I added chicken broth, a can of rotel original, tony chachere's, old bay, sliced okra, crab meat.....served it over rice with cornbread, my fiance' who's Arabic, loved it too, the gravy/sauce lingers on your tongue and you just want to keep eating until its all gone. I will serve it again. Quite adaptable, once you get the gravy right, anything else is all good....

****BAM****  Holy moly, this is PHENOMENAL.   Even if you consider yourself a GREAT cook, I think this will impress you.  I followed the recipe exactly until adding the salt...at which point, I used Zataran's creole seasoning salt (using the saltiness to guide you).  This roux was SO SMOOTHE (thanks to the butter me thinks).  It danced lightly upon every taste bud I have.  Absolutely the BEST recipe I've tasted in a long time (and I'm a cook...not just a now-and-again-er, if you know what I mean...).  MMMM-mmmm-mmmm.  HALLELUJAH say's the taste buds!   Can't thank you enough Ann!!

My husband and I had our first taste of shrimp etouffee when we finally took a trip to New Orleans about 3 years ago - and we couldn't get enough! This recipe is just as good, if not better than we remember... We served it over a long grain wild rice, and it was FABULOUS!! Still cant get enough even though we ate 'til we thought we'd burst! Don't sweat the time involved..it's well worth every minute. You cannot rush perfection!!!

A bit more time consuming than i had originally planned, but very good. I changed things a bit-adding half a can of chopped tomatoes to the onions, celery mix. Also cut the water in half and added a bit of white wine. And most importantly, instead of using butter, i used olive oil instead(about 4 tablespoons). I thought it tasted great and with a Lot less fat!

I made this for the adults at my son's birthday party a couple of weeks ago, and it was a huge hit!  I added a few pinches of cayane pepper and a fairly generous amount of the red pepper flakes too.  I left some Cajun hot sauce out for my guests to spice it a bit more, and everyone raved!  Even one of the kids loved it.  She told me that it was the best food she's ever eaten in her whole life!  I'm making it again in a couple of days for another get together.

2/15/15 - made this last night with a pound of shrimp and a pound of Tilapia filets, used 2 cups of water, added 1 tablespoon of cajun spice and 1 tablespoon of Watkins cajun spice mix plus 1 tablespoon of the paprika and a few shakes of parsley.  Served over Jasmine rice - as delicious as always!

10/?/2005 - This recipe is AWESOME!  The first time I made it, it turned out great and was delicious!  I used shrimp and worried when my onions & celery browned too fast, but by the end, it smelled and looked wonderful!  My 15-month daughter, who has never cared for shrimp, gobbled them up!  I will definitely make this again!

This was terrific!  Made it for a dinner guest and her two 10 year old boys and even they asked for seconds!  I used frozen pre-cooked shrimp thawed and chopped and it turned out terrific!  Also added more salt for flavor.  Definitely making this one again!

This was a huge success for a big family birthday dinner!  I added about 1/2 cup tomato sauce (for color) and Cajun/Creole spices. The consistency was perfect.  It was truly delicious and flavorful, but mild. Everyone enjoyed adding hot sauce from the variety we offered.

This recipe is just AWESOME!!!  I made this last night and my husband just loved it!!  The only thing I found was I didn't feel it was necessary to add any water (I think that may have been because the prawns I used had been frozen so I had to soak them in warm water and they were pretty saturated with water when I put them in).  And, I served this dish over steamed rice.... yummy!!!  This is super easy to make, just a bit time consuming.... but soooo worth it!

This recipe was well worth the time. Mine did not thicken up so I added a little flour- I guess I'll use a little less water next time (started with lowest suggested, but it's humid here...).

We both love etouffe and we both loved this!

This recipe was outstanding.  I did add a little more red pepper as my husband and I prefer our Cajun seasoning very spicy.  Would probably be a little too spicy for young kids and teens.

I have made this many times and I've changed it so much that it may be a different recipe at this point but it serves as written as a good start. I use 1 stick butter and 1/2 C olive oil.  I add a green bell pepper chopped and a can of Rotel tomatoes.  I add the water/ chicken broth and Rotels right after mixing in of the flour and let it all cook for about 15 minutes.  If it needs to be thickened I add a mixture of cornstarch and white wine. I agree with another review that the shrimp is cooked way to long.  I used chopped shrimp and crawfish tails and cook for about 6-7 minutes.  This recipe will make 6-8 good size servings.  Not even close to 20 small cup size servings.  I find it delicious.

This recipe is so yummy & versatile, I followed the suggestions by other reviewers and found them super helpful.  I've made this recipe several times and loved it but tonight I substituted stew meat, used vermouth & corn starch to thicken the broth and then used it as a filling for a Shepherds Pie. It was by far the best Shepherds Pie I have had!

This was a yummy recipe but way too much butter for my Weight Watchers program. I reduced the butter, substituted olive oil when I could and used nutritional yeast to help maintain the butter flavoring.  It turned out quite well and pretty tasty. I'd make it again for certain.

This was very good. The changes I made were minimal. I added some tomato paste, used pre-cooked shrimp, and for the fluid I used chicken broth (although white wine would've been my first choice but oddly didn't have any on hand!). I served this over brown rice. I will be making this again!

Pretty tasty and very easy to make. Didn't have celery so I used a bell pepper instead, and it was probably better than it would have been with celery. I might put some more spice in it next time and try crawfish instead of shrimp. Overall, a great recipe.

I cut down the recipe so it served 4 people or 1# shrimp. Cut down on water as others and increased mushrooms and kept the shimp whole. I added more garlic & red pepper. It was a delicious dish with pasta shells. Serve with a salad & garlic bread.

I made this with cooked shrimp since it was all I had and added them in at the end. I added more mushrooms just because I love them and plenty of hot sauce. Although this recipe is time consuming, the end result is delicous.

This recipe was awesome!!!  Not too much work and absolutely delicious.  I scaled the recipe to 10 servings and substituted chicken broth (1 1/2 cups) for water as one of the other reviewers suggested. This will be a great recipe for entertaining.  Thanks!

I took this to my Texas Holdem poker nite.  Everyone loved it.  





I made this for my Texas Holdem Poker nite.  They all loved  it.  I took some suggestions from others and I used chicken broth instead of water, less water if you halfed the recipe, cajun seasoning, doubled the mushrooms and added small can of tomatoe sauce. I used 2 lbs shrimp and pound of imitation crab meat.  Plenty of seafood!  Awesome!! Thanks Ann

I thought this was good, very spicy and flavorful. It tasted even better as leftovers. I topped it off with parmesan cheese and served it over angel hair pasta. I'll definitely make again.

This turned out great.  I used tomato sauce in lieu of tomatoes from others suggestions and also used chicken broth in lieu of water.  I used cajun seasoning also but a little too much of it.  It turned out really spicy.  So watch out how much seasoning you use!  Perhaps next time I'll try the recipe as is and see if it is better.  I hate rating recipes that i've altered!

This was so good!  I got a bit carried away with the crushed red pepper, and it was a bit too spicy for my son, but the rest of my family loved it!    I took the suggestion from other reviews and used chicken broth rather than water and had to use canned mushrooms because I didn't have fresh.

Decent! We liked it. Notice that if you lower the amount your making - the water you need is less too! & the cooking time is so much shorter. Ate on white rice & had Spinach Brownies on the side - Mmm!

Very good - I followed the other reviewer's advice, added a splash of wine, chicken broth instead of water, half a small can of tomato paste and a few dashes of cajun seasoning.  Delish!  Husband and 9 year old daughter liked it.  Have some tobasco on the table, too...MMmmmm!

Pretty easy recipe. I added about half a can of tomato paste, creole seasoning, used chicken stock instead of water, and added some cornstarch near the end. I also added half a large tomato, a green bell pepper, some worchestershire, and hot sauce. I agree that it seemed rather bland before adding the extra flavors. It was very tasty over rice!

We loved this recipe!! It ended up being fairly easy, and made me feel like a famous chef when I was done.  I used pre-cooked shrimp to cut down the cooking time (added it right at the end), substituted chicken broth for the water per the other reviews, spiced it up a bit with cajun seasoning because we like our stuff hot, and also included some Worcestershire sauce.  This is definitely a keeper!

Even though my family rated this 5, I still didn't taste anything extra-ordinary that would make want to have this again, especialy with the long cooking time. I don't know, maybe it's due to all of the changes I made- used chicken broth as recomended (and yes, I scaled it down) added 1 tbs tomato paste and used 2lb shrimps and 1/2lb scallops (which was my first time cooking scallops- and they came out delicious!) Also, as spices used , besides the ones in the recipe, cayene pepper and a lil bit of chili powder for a kick. over all was good and enjoyed it. Thank you for a very good recipe!

This was wonderful!  I used about half shrimp and about half imitation crab (which I was a little hesitant about, but it added just a hint of sweetness, which was GREAT with the spiciness).  Also, I bought a nice sauvignon blanc to drink with dinner, so I used half wine and half water at the end.  I added the wine first and let it cook down a bit before I added the water, to make sure it caught the flavor.  My husband, who generally does not like spicy food, LOVED this, and so did I.  We will definitely make it again!

During the thicking time I tasted the dish and it was pretty bland. I added my favorite cajun seasoning, Tony Chachere, and it really helped. Next time I will add about a tablespoon of it along with the paprika. I enjoyed this dish, but not sure how often I will make it due to the LONG prep/cook times.

Tasty recipe but beware, when you reduce the number of servings, the text still says to add 2-3 cups of water. I stopped before I put that much in because it didn't look right, but it was still a bit too runny because I put too much in. I added some crabmeat to it and it was a good addition.

Nice and spicy.  If you scaled down make sure to scale down the water too.  We used 2 cups but since we scaled down to 5 servings it was WAY to watery.  Will proably come out better the next time we make it and use just .5 cup of water.

I haven't made etoufee before and can only compare this to some restaurant dishes I've tried.  My husband is a big Cajun fan and when I asked him if he's like to have this again he said "again and again".  I scaled the recipe to 5 and used 1 tsp Cajun seasoning per pound of shrimp as my seasoning label recommended.  It was easy and very tasty.

This recipe was awesome! And it didn't even take as long as the instructions say. I used tomatoes instead of mushrooms (since I didn't have any mushrooms on hand) and it still came out great! I highly recommend this recipe.

A great recipe that did not take as long to make as the instructions suggest.  I do not eat shrimp but my very honest husband does.  I made it for him and he loved it!

I made this by special request for my son and a couple of his friends, scaling it down to 8 servings.  Four college kids devoured it in one sitting.  The rats didn't leave me a bite--but they assured me it was dynamite. :)

Great recipe.  I made the mistake of adding frozen shrimp, so if you do, don't add as much water.  It was a little watered down, but that was my fault.  I added a splash of white wine, and some crushed tomatoes, delicious!

Made to serve 4 and added the raw, I chopped shrimp the last few minutes of cooking. Also added can of stewed tomatoes and 1/2 cup of chopped frozen spinach (to offset the butter in my mind). Added creole season to it on my first plate, then tried it with Old Bay on the second. Both tasted really good, but the Old Bay almost won out. Thanks for the recipe, added it to my Cajun Obsession recipes!

Okay! This recipe turned out great.  Though given all the of prior comments I did a good amount of adjustments.  As with others I used chicken broth instead of water also I used olive oil in place of some of the butter.  I also added heavy cream and green peppers.  I really like the consistency of the sauce and the flavor.  I do wish it had a little more color like that in the picture.  Thanks for a good recipe!!

Really good base to start with! I made about half of the recipe. I had to use frozen, thawed shrimp, and added them at the very end to not overcook. To up the flavor pallet I used beer, vegetable stock, and chicken bullion in place of water, upped the garlic (I only had garlic powder around) and used creole seasoning for the kick. We gobbled it up over some mixed grains and barley!

I'm a very picky eater and dislike grocery shopping.  I stumbled upon this recipe one day and saw how little ingredients it required so decided I would try it. I couldn't believe how great it tasted. Since trying this recipe a month ago, I had been making it every weekend and eat them for lunch and dinner for the upcoming week.  I doubled the recipes (40 servings) and finished eating the entire thing in less than a week.  I'm addicted to this recipe.  I will continue to make it once a week until I get sick of it, which I don't think I ever will.

Few things I modified:  I add some starch for thickening and 1/2-3/4 cup of red wine.  I cook the shrimp for 15 minutes instead of the suggested 45.  Also, to save some money, I double all the ingredients except for shrimp.  

Thank you so much for sharing such an awesome recipe.  You make a picky eater like me so happy.  I have problem with keeping weight on me due to my laziness of cooking and I don't like spending money eating out, but thanks to this recipe I have been maintaining my weight since I enjoy eating this so much.

Well like a few others I of course had to cut the recipe down & make some changes.  I cut it down to a pound of shrimp (5/6 servings). I used chicken broth & white wine instead of water (a little over a cup). I also seasoned the shrimp in some old bay prior to cooking. I also did some other things to the sauce.. I used "Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning" (instead of salt) along with the paprika, a couple dashes of Whorcestershire sauce, I also added a chopped tomato for some flavor and color.  With a few changes I would give this 5 star & I will keep it and make it again!!

Wonderful recipe! I did use the suggestion of using chicken broth and a bit of white wine in place of the water but found the spices to be perfect. It's worth making again and again. Thanks for the recipe Ann! :)

Followed this very loosely. Added green onions and green bell pepper, along with an assortment of spices and sauce. Cooked the rice in the mix -- next time I'll add more water or broth so it comes out more soupy. Very excellent.

Though technically not authentic (the genuine article includes green pepper), this is still a good, basic recipe. The shrimp should be added last as they cook very quickly. 50 minutes is a very long time to cook shrimp.

Very good. I think you have to add the tomato paste as suggested by the other reviewers. I added tomato paste, a bit of worcestire sauce and chicken broth. It was very filling! Will definitely make again.

Great recipe! I did change a few things though. I used 1/2 cup butter, chicken broth instead of water, and added some creole seasoning to it. Served with garlic bread and steamed veggies. The nex day  my husband and I were arguing over who got the left overs.

Made some modifications according to my taste.  (added 1 TB Tomato paste, worschestire, and extra garlic).  I changed the servings to 8.  Also, I only added 1 cup of water in the end.  Lastly, we served this over whole wheat angel hair pasta with some parmesan.  Very Tasty!

This is good!  However, using that much butter/margarine is scary!  Next time I will try only 1/8 of a stick or canola spray.  I also want to try to add okra and stewed tomatoes.

I've made this dish several times, and everytime its wonderful! A few times I was out of paprika so I just used a seasoning salt. Plus I always add extra garlic since we love it so much! Very easy to make, and tastes awesome! Thanks!

I used a can of tomatoes w/chilis instead of some of the water and I ran out of paprika, so I put some cajun seasoning in also.  My husband loved it! Tastes great and easy to make.

Delicious! I added 1 can of Ro-Tel tomatoes, original or mild, and I used only 2 cups water. A friend used the RoTel tomatoes and 1 can cream of celery soup to replace the fresh celery,and she said it was so good. The gravy makes the shrimp and rice delicious.Fresh garlic and onions make it so good. I like alot of onions, so I increased it to 1 more onion in the recipe. Super good! I didn't cut up the shrimp, just choose the size of shrimp wanted.

EXCELLENT recipe!  I used this for company and it was RAVED over!  I used a chunky one-cup measuring cup, packed the rice tight into it and dumped it out onto each plate.  Then I served up the etoufee OVER the mound of rice, garnishing with lemon and orange slices and parsley.  PERFECT!

I gave this a four because I did some changes for tastes. If you enjoy seasoning, I suggest the following: Use chicken broth instead of water, season with McCormicks Cajun Seasoning and McCormicks Red Pepper Seasoning. I used half shrimp and half crab meat. My hubby could not believe how YUMMY it all was!!! I served this with some of my signature cornbread and it was the perfect compliment to this great dish! Thank you Ann!

We made this last night for Fat Tuesday, and it was sooo good! We only put 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper in it because we are not big on hot foods! That amount was just perfect for us! We also did not need to cook it as long as the recipe says. We really enjoyed this, and it is going in my recipe box! Thank You!

I have made a few changes to this recipe to make it work for me.  I use frozen shrimp (preferably without tails) and reduce the amount of water to 1 cup.  My family loves this dish!

I'll have to try this recipe again. I used olive oil instead of butter and cooked shrimp, which turned out chewy because I added it too early. I also used cayenne which made it way too hot. I'll have to repeat this recipe so I can give it a fair score.

I used this recipe to make a romantic dinner for my wife on our 1st Valentines day together, and we both absolutely loved it! We used chicken broth in place of water to make it thicker, and we also added 12 oz of imitation crab meat, which gave you seafood in every bite!  Wonderful recipe Ann.  I recommend it to all who love seafood and spicy food!

I have been using this recipe for about two years now.  It is excellent.  I usually do not use the pepper flakes.  This also makes a good sauce over grilled catfish.

Excellent, my husband and kids loved it.  Read other reviews first, so I added parsley, tomato paste, cajun seasoning and broth instead of water (scaled down to 10 servings, added broth 1/2 cup at a time until right consistency reached.  We also really like mushrooms, so I doubled them.  Thanks for sharing!

I scaled this recipe to serve 5.  Remember to scale the water as the computer doesn't do this for you.  For a serving of 5 use 3/4 cup water.  Otherwise, I followed this exactly.  This gets a one star because of all the work and long cooking time for something that is just ok.  Not bad, but nothing great.  It is actually a waste of time.

I liked it. I had to add bell peppers because it’s not Cajun unless you use the trinity, onions, celery, and bell peppers.

I'm a huge fan of Cajun food, so I would naturally fall in love with this etouffee recipe. After I got more and more familiar with this recipe I started making modifications to it. Like completely the Blessed Trinity with the addition of green bell pepper. I also add more paprika and include more spices like cheyenne, ancho, and (since I'm Texan) hatch peppers.

Have made it several times, and pretty much stayed with the recipe as written except used two -  2lb. packages of shrimp.  It pretty much filled a large saute pan.  Very good!

I have made this 4 times now, as written but scaled down to half. My picky family has requested this at special gatherings, so you know its good. I now feel I am at liberty to experiment with some of the other suggestions (tomato paste, green pepper, etc) I serve mine with jasmine rice cooked in coconut water, which adds a sweet touch to the dish. Thanks Ann.

I tried to do 1/5 the recipe because I only had 1lb of shrimp and there are only two of us! I took some of the reviewers' advice and used broth instead of water and added the shrimp last so it didn't over cook.

I used the shrimp shells to make a stock as water brings nothing to the party.  I made this for 6 servings instead of 20.  I did not use mushrooms and I forgot to add paprika, but all worked out well. I added some cajun andouille sausage. So I guess that would make mines Shrimp and Sausage Etoufee,

This is now in regular rotation. I did make adjustments based on other reviews- chicken stock instead of water, a 14oz can of stewed tomato when I added the stock, left the shrimp until the end to cook, and a couple shakes of cayenne during seasoning. So good.

I don't understand how someone could give this recipe any less than five stars. I followed exactly, but didn't have mushrooms on hand, so didn't use them. My whole family (ranging in ages from 1 to 30) gobbled this up and asked for more. I served over a bed of white rice. Total perfection. It's our new favorite shrimp recipe and probably one we'll be making a lot!

loved it.. honestly, I feel like this is a really great 'base' recipe. I think that if I followed this recipe exactly it might turn out a little.. bland?  Made a few revisions to accommodate my own tastes.. Chicken stock instead of water.. a small can of tomato paste.. chopped green pepper.. added cooked, brown rice at the very end to thicken it up and add some heartiness.. come chili powder & hot sauce for more kick.. Oh, and some salt to taste.  I know.. a lot of revisions!!   I'd use this recipe as a starting point again, for sure! Very yummy.

Excellent recipe. Super easy to make too. Only made a few changes by taking out mushrooms (kids hate them!) and adding about a cup of diced tomatos - had half a beefsteak tomato that I needed to use. Served over rice and it was wonderful!

Definitely scale down the liquid and use broth instead of water.  Added some worchestershire for a little depth. Really good dish over some rice.

We didn't care for this at all. I couldn't even convince the kids to eat the shrimp out of it and that's very rare. However with the addition of some soy sauce rice vinegar, sesame oil and some peas and carrots it made an edible stir-fry.

This just wasn't what I was expecting. The consistency wasn't what I was looking for. My grandfather was Cajun and my family used to make what we called shrimp stew so I was trying to find something like it on here. However, this didn't quite live up to my expectations, but that's just my personal preferences.

I made this a while ago and I dont know if it was something I did or if it is just the way an Etoufee should be but we weren't too keen on it here. But that could be personal preference rather than a reflection on the recipe.

This recipes was ok.  I'm a big fan of cajun dishes but I thought this one was a little bland.  I did add some canjun seasoning but I think if I make it again, I will follow some of the other reviews and use chicken broth instead of water.

Great base recipe.  Definitely needs more heat to be truly cajun.  I add 2 to 3 tsp. of creole seasoning when I make this.  I also use chicken or seafood stock instead of the water for more flavor.

This was great!  I didn't have any cayenne pepper and felt the only thing it needed was a little kick.  Next time, I'll make sure I have some handy because I'm sure it's perfect with it added.  I also added 2tbsp of tomato paste and added a rue to thicken at the end.

I definitely made a smaller portion of this as it was just myself and my husband.  I didn't put in the celery since my husband hates it and picks up on the taste of celery in anything.  Overall it was an excellent recipe and I will definitely be making again.

Now I realize why the author makes enough for 20 - this recipe was delicious!  For my family, I cut the recipe down to serve 5.  Thank you to everyone who warned me to cut back on the water proportionately.  I found the cooking times could be decreased as well, probably because the quantities were smaller. Anyway, I used thawed and chopped orange roughy instead of shrimp, chicken broth instead of water, a bit more garlic, and a teaspoon of cajun seasoning.  I served it over white rice and everyone loved it. I can't wait to try this again with shrimp or crab meat.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this twice since Lent started -- my husband and I are hooked!  It really isn't difficult to prepare, just takes some extra consideration for the time factor.  Worth it for sure!  I'm still experimenting with how much red pepper to add, since I don't cook with that very often.  This tastes great over brown rice cooked with broth!

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  Just added a bit of Old Bay seasoning.  Otherwise, I think it turned out perfect.  I made it with white rice, which helps if it turns out a little too spicy (red pepper).  Thanks Ann!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I was looking for something different to make during lent and this was perfect.  I used thawed frozen shrimp instead of fresh and it still tasted great.  Also, I sized the recipe down to 4 servings and that was just the perfect amount for the two of us.  Tasted great over steamed rice!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent dish and will be a regular in our home.  I did add some cajun seasoning and a bit more garlic.  We like our food a little spicy.  My husband raved!  This was the first time I've tried making etoufee from scratch and it was very easy.  No more mixes for me!

I was a little hesitant because this said "Cajun"; something I've only sampled a few times. I will definitely make this again! This was like eating out at a restaurant. It was fantastic and not that difficult to prepare. The most time consuming thing was peeling the shrimp. It was well worth it though. All three of my picky kids aged 4-10 loved it. Not an easy accomplishment.

I left out the red pepper and we all really liked this.  My 6 year old (shrimp-loving)daughter LOVED it.  Spent the rest of the evening wishing out loud that there were more left-overs.  I added the pepper to mine, and the added heat really made a positive difference (would have killed the hubby).
