Very tasty! I followed the recipe as written, but I did add some dill weed (would have used fresh if I had some). Good and easy. Yes, as many reviewers state, cream cheese would be amazing (when is it not?!), but this is more healthy and still delicious! Thanks for posting. : )

this is nice, but spreading cream cheese on the toast/bagel/focaccia to go with the salmon scramble is even nicer :)

This was a nice change from regular eggs!  I added some sauteed mushrooms and baby spinach, to get some veggies in, and served on top of multi-grain English muffins.  As others mentioned, a little cream cheese would have put this over the top!  The one down side of this was really due to my own preferences - having never had smoked salmon before, I found it to be much more salty than I thought it would be.  I'll make this again, but go easy on the  salmon next time, or maybe try a different brand.

This was so super easy and delicious. I agree that a little cream cheese on your bread adds a lot to this breakfast. Thanks for the recipe!

There shouldn't be any bones in smoked salmon:  Be sure to use smoked, not regular canned salmon!

Scrumptous! Thanks for the recipe! I used bagels instead of toast and just made a sandwich out of it. YUM.

This would never work for me, personally, as I don't like salmon, let alone the idea of fish in my scrambled eggs. Heading home today and had some things to clear out of the fridge here in Naples - salmon and some eggs being two of them. Hubs loves the stuff so I tried this out on him. Knowing how he loves his bagels and cream cheese with his salmon, I added some little cubes of it to the eggs along with the salmon.  I also added some dill.  He thought this was just okay, thinking the combination (as I had thought myself) of the salmon with the eggs just a little too odd.

Great recipe which is simple to make and has good flavor.  This was very good served with cream cheese spread on the toast, as suggested by other reviewers.

I made this more like a frittata vs a scramble since I wanted to add some veggies (spinach & red onions).  I also added some fresh dill and used a low carb tortilla vs the bread. Great breakfast.

Very simple, very good! I used toasted English muffins instead, but cut them into points, too.

Simple ingredients for a classic taste!  Quick & easy way to perk up eggs.  Both my 5 & 1 y.o. kids loved it.

I did not care for this recipe for 2 reasons.  One, I like salmon, but that's all it ended up tasting like.  It didn't have any flavor besides salmon.  Also...and this is a personal dislike in the cooking department- I hated picking out all the bones.  This recipe might be good for someone who loves salmon, but it was not for us.

I am giving the recipe, with my additions, 5 stars. I used 3 eggs, some milk, and added chopped onions and diced fresh tomatoes. I also sprinkled a little grated cheese over the eggs after I removed it from the heat. I used less than the 1/3 cup of smoked salmon that the recipe called for with only one egg.  About 1/4 c. was plenty of flavor for 3 eggs and much more economical. Instead of buttering the toast, I used cream cheese. It was fantastic!

I used 6 eggs for  2 adults and two children. The smoked salmon really added great flavor and texture to the eggs, I also added finely shredded white sharp cheddar with mixed ground peppercorns. Very tasty and the kids really enjoyed it.

I found this recipe to be very good! But then, I grew up along the Indian River where one could order fish and eggs for breakfast - and you can still get it to this day! I did add cream cheese to the toast points. However, the guys in my household found it to be "okay" - one thought the fish was ""ham..... good grief.
