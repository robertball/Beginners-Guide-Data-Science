I really liked this quick, zesty dish. I had all the ingredients in the house, whipped it together and had a healthy meal. I love that it doesn't require butter or oil to have a great flavor. I used it on a combination of salmon, pollack, and flounder. I had to sub the dijon mustard for Cleveland stadium mustard, which is on the spicier side, with good results.

I made this dish for dinner today, and it was delicious.  It was easy to prepare and cook.  I served it with steamed cauliflower and a salad of baby spinach, arugula, butter lettuce, tomato and avocado, and, of course, a glass of pinot grigio  wine.

This one went to my recipe box.

This fish was excellent but the topper was nothing special. I did not have lemon or lemon pepper.. plus I added a tablespoon of Mayonnaise because of everyone saying how overpowering the dijon was. I would have probably went up to a 4 with the addition of lemon.

My husband really liked the sauce, but I don't think any of us were crazy about the steelhead trout.  It's a very firm textured fish, and I don't think I over-cooked it, but it still seemed a bit dry.  The sauce might be really good on salmon, which we all love.  I doubled the sauce recipe since I was using 24 oz. of fish.  UPDATE 5/2/16 - Doubled sauce again, using 1.3 lbs. of fish.  Felt it was fairly heavy on the dijon mustard BUT the fish was so moist/tender this time - not at all the firm texture, or dry, as I said from last time.  Maybe I did overcook it then.  Will be trying steelhead trout again, maybe with a different recipe.

OMG! I have made this three times now and every time my husband raves about the flavor and tenderness of the fish. I have to admit that it is my favorite fish recipe too.  Maybe my favorite dinner recipe ever!  I substituted chicken broth for the wine and Mrs. Dash Original seasoning because I was out of dill. The sauce pairs well with any mild flavored fish but melds with  steelhead or salmon in an exceptional way! Two forks up!

I used a 2.25lb fillet with skin. I foiled the bottom of my pan then poured half the sauce into the pan, put the fillet down skin side up. Kind of rolled the foil so the juices would stay under ther fillet , yet left the top open. Baked it 10 min. Took it out, discarded the skin, and poured the rest of the sauce on it. Broiled another 10 min. Served over thyme and rosemary herbed rice, with a side of lemon.  Additional sides of black eyed peas and brussel sprouts sauteed with onion and turkey bacon. Thank you! This was so good.
(I didn't have the wine so I subbed it for a mix of water and white vinegar, half of each. Worked great! Also did 3Tbl of Dijon, mine was made with Chardonnay. )

I loved the simplicity of this recipe. I had everything on hand and dinner was ready in no time! I followed the recipe exactly as written. We had never tried steelhead trout before, but Aldi carries it fresh, so I thought we would give it a try. We were delighted with the fish and the recipe!

Made this tonight and followed the recipe exactly.  It was fantastic.  The tartness of the lemon and Dijon was so good with the fish.  Served it with some roasted turnips, carrots and Brussels Sprouts.  What a fantastic meal.

This was good. Very easy to make with stuff I had in the pantry. I didn't have lemon pepper but I put in fresh lemon zest and some fresh ground pepper. I made it with one large 1 lb fillet of trout. I would make it again.

Made exactly as written. Used Grey Poupon brand dijon mustard. Amazing result! I can't believe I've been drowning trout in butter all this time. Never again! This is much better.

We call it rainbow trout in Ontario, Canada.  I followed the receipe.  Interestingly my husband did not taste the mustard until I mentioned it.  He thought it was a real winner.  I agree.

Followed directions exactly and turned out perfectly. Cooked for 15 minutes. Moist and delicious. Made for a dinner party and it’s an easy, yet impressive looking and tasting dish.

The key here is: fresh steelhead.  We loved it, because we had fresh fish.

Made exactly as described. Nice change for a fish meal. We usually eat salmon but trout is also on the good fish list so this will be a keeper because I am getting tired of salmon every week.

Served to "foodie" company who loved it as much as my wife and I.  Made per recipe with two minor exceptions: cooked on grill instead of in oven and grilled on bed of lemon slices to keep skin off grill and prevent sticking.  Perfection. Delicious, simple yet impressive.  Served with roasted veggies and green salad.  Will definitely use recipe again...cheers!

Excellent!  I would not change a thing.   I doubled the recipe since I had a generous amount of trout.  If i had not been the one that prepared this, I would have sworn the sauce had butter in it or something.  So creamy and delicious and I can see using that on future seafood and poultry dishes.  Thanks for a great new favorite!!

I cook with steelhead when ever I see it on sale and I favor it over salmon.  I use lemon pepper with fish a lot, so I gave this a try and really enjoyed it.  I am a huge fan of Lemon pepper, so decide to use it as a rub and then poured the mixture minus lemon pepper.  This change was not over powering to me, but it could be to others.

Thanks for a nice quick dish with little clean-up after.

No fishy taste at all. Yes, you taste the mustard and dill; cut back a little if you don't like either one. BUT DO NOT OMIT!
I made this according to the ingredients posted. The lemon is important.  I keep dehydrated on hand with my spices; It reconstitutes with the wine.  I had it with a Caesar salad.

I would use this as a company dinner dish !!

Fabulous.  I had to use red wine and I used it on salmon instead of steelhead (they're very similar)but otherwise followed it exactly as written. We will use this frequently.
Thanks Nora!!

This was really delicious! The mustard was key. We get a lot of steelhead because both my son and my husband love to fish for them. We'll be using this delectable, simple recipe many more times! Thank you very much.

Quick and easy to make in the oven or on the bbq. I had fresh dill in the freezer and used that instead of dry. Paired with roasted parmesan cauliflower, Green beans and the dry white wine  of course!

I typically don't  make sauces for fish but this one looked interesting.  It was amazing!  I followed the advice of others and used a combination of Dijon mustard and mayonnaise.   I didn't have lemon pepper so I used pepper and grated lemon zest.  The lemon zest added a wonderful touch.  Also, I don't like dried dill and didn't have fresh on hand so I omitted. This was incredibly moist and will definitely make it again.

Not bad, I did add a little mayo like all the reviewers suggested and used chicken broth instead of wine.  Also, laid the fillets over a bed of spinach.

A bit of too much mustard for the taste. For every 2 1/2 tbsp of dijon mustard, use half of that for mayo instead

Used Olive oil instead of cooking spray, replaced lemon pepper with chilli flakes.

This was very good and extremely easy. I added it to my favorites. I had a guest who avoids alcohol so I substituted chicken stock and increased the lemon by half. Also didn't have lemon pepper, so added fresh ground pepper instead. Used full amounts of dill and Dijon. Perfect, but I'll use the wine next time I make it.

First time I didn't have lemon so used more mustard.  Still turned out well.  Second time I had everything.  We love it.  Will definitely make again and plan to try it with salmon.

It was a nice, easy recipe and my fish ended up being very tender and flavorful. I didn't have lemon black pepper, so I added normal black pepper and some coriander. I also didn't have dijon, so I used regular mustard plus honey instead. I used freeze dried dill and barely tasted it unfortunately.

In the end, for my tastes, the sauce should have been either be sweeter or spicier to be good on its own, but I paired it with beet tops sauteed with garlic, lemon, and chili pepper - which worked pretty well.

I love this recipe, it's so easy and the fish always comes out perfect. I've even subbed spicy brown mustard for the dijon before.

I was not impressed with this at all.  The dijon was too overpowering to the (to me) delicate steelhead flavor.  A waste of perfectly good steehead filets.

Sorry but we weren't impressed at all.  We love steelhead trout and normally grill it on a cedar plank but we didnt' have any planks so we tried this.  It was very bland.  Sorry not a keeper for us.
