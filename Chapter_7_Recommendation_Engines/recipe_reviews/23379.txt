Great lemon flavor paired with a delightful glaze. I made this cake for a meeting I had at work and everyone loved it! It put everyone in a great mood.

This is the first time I have baked a poppy seeded cake.  I made two and they went like hot cakes!  Excellent recipe!
Since writing the above, I have made the cake without the poppy seeds.  This is an excellent lemon cake recipe.

I hate to be the only low rating here, but this was just not what I expected.  It wasn't light, there was too much of a flour taste, and when I tried to get it out of my generously greased pan it stuck like no other.  I'm still trying to get it out of the pan two days later!  The only part that was really good was the lemon glaze, and it was the only part of this recipe I will make again.

Excellent!  Served this at a recent family gathering and it was a hit. I served it with fresh berries on the side for some added color and contrast.

Mmmmm.  Lemony.  It was moist, not too sweet, and just dense enough for a bundt cake.  The best part, though, was the super-lemony glaze.

This is a moist, delicious, lemony cake.  The flavor improves if it sits on the 
counter top for a couple of days.  I made this when I had company, and one of my
friends asked me to make it for her for her birthday cake!  It was a big hit!

Light and delicious.  I made the glaze with just 1 1/2 C confectioners sugar and the 1/4 C lemon juice, no butter or zest, and it was really nice that way.

Moist and delicious lemon cake!  The icing is yummy as well.  Next time I think I will cut down on the amount of confectioner's sugar in the icing though.  I thought it to be a little too sweet.

This was an excellant cake! Very light & the taste was awesome. Made thin Lemon drizzle icing & that just put this cake right over the top for the Rotary luncheon.

This tasted like what I expected a lemon poppy seeds cake to taste like -- it was 
very good -- and those who attended our bbq asked for the recipe

Good flavor, but a little bit dry. The icing was delicious.

I probably over-baked this by about 5 minutes, but this cake wasn't as fabulous as I had hoped it would be.  Angela
